It's up there with a really stinky cheese or certain organ meats, lutefisk, that sort of thing.

The smell of durian is like so many things but is so hard to place. It wasn't an alien smell at all, but I had never smelled it before then and really couldn't place what it reminded me of.

Usually I just did it when I was alone. Fortunately not a problem for me anymore and I have no idea what started me on that behavior or what made it go away. So for everyone who's jumping to ""Always the parents 100%"", I'd say maybe it's not as simple as you think.  Edit: After reading another person's comment, I think I know how it stopped. It was probably the ""Ah, shit"" moment when I broke my SP and knew I couldn't ask my parents for a new one because I would be in for some shit."

IdiotsFightingThings,3dhyea,DownvoterAccount,2,Fri Jul 17 00:46:45 2015 UTC,"I used to be a bit like this, especially when I was younger (I'm 20 now, see like since I was 12 till 18) I don't normally break things (except for a couple of things I'll talk about), but I used to get pissed so easily when playing videogames and other things and I hit my computer or something like that. I'm not like ""shitty things break so easily"", I'm actually embarrased of my behaviour, and even if I try my best I can't totally control my emotions.  So far I've damaged some videogame cases (a bit broken), like 4 Dualshock3 controllers (all still working but they may be slightly damaged in the sticks, or the case is a bit broken, etc. and tbh I'm quite clumsy and iirc I broke one of them by accidentaly stepping on it, others are damaged by dropping them) and a laptop hard drive (legitimately because I was pissed, total loss), all while playing FIFA (that game brings out the worst of me). I've done my best to learn from my mistakes, now I don't hit things (if anything I hit the table which won't break), and I definitely get pissed much less often.  I didn't break anything like walls (how the fuck can you punch a hole in a wall??? My bones would definitely break before that), windows, TVs or anything like that, I'm not that bad.  And for people wondering why would I play videogames to get pissed, the satisfaction I get from it definitely outweighs the bad moments."

IdiotsFightingThings,3dhyea,Rats_In_Boxes,3,Thu Jul 16 20:54:46 2015 UTC,"That's definitely true. 2 hours was an exaggeration. I'm on my way to platinum infinite these days and some areas take an hour or so of retrying. I've never wanted to throw anything though which is why it always amazing to see clips like this. At most I'd squeeze the controller tight and move my hands up and down saying ""god fucking dammit"". Apparently amusing to watch according to my siblings."
IdiotsFightingThings,3dhyea,MithSeka,2,Thu Jul 16 21:01:07 2015 UTC,"I don't play sports or racing games, so already my frustration levels are very low. The only thing that frustrates me in gaming (and always has) is when I see that the save feature is limited, as in, I can only save my game in certain in-game locations or by collecting in-game items. Japanese games feature this a lot, like an artificial means of making the game harder in a totally lazy way (looking at you, Last of Us, you filthy fuckers). I've returned games simply because the save feature is restricted. That's a broken game, IMO."

Apparently reaching into the fire to yank the nitrous line is a Good Thing because hey, cars ain't cheap!  Skin grafts, on the other hand...  Edit: it started with someone else's facepalm... Clearly the comments are spreading contagion!"
IdiotsFightingThings,3csucs,MartyMacGyver,19,Fri Jul 10 15:29:12 2015 UTC,"I mean you shouldn't have the nitrous in the engine bay. Anyone recommending yanking the line out would be a moron.  Go fill up a Styrofoam cup with water and poke a straw through the bottom. Cap the straw with your finger.  No water is coming out.  Now pull the straw out. All of the water comes shooting out.   People are stupid...  The best thing to do would have been to kill the engine, manually turn off the nitrous (which should be mounted in the cabin), and leave the hood down.  The fire retardant cover's plastic holding pins would melt, dropping it on the engine, and (hopefully) save the car. At the very least it would make it take longer to burn, perhaps letting them put it out.  Short of taking a can of gasoline to douse the fire, there was really nothing else that these idiots could have done wrong..."
IdiotsFightingThings,3csucs,AdamsHarv,3,Fri Jul 10 15:34:54 2015 UTC,"Having watched my car burn from a fuel line failure, leaving the hood down doesn't help, the fire keeps burning and often the plastic clips retaining the hood release melt meaning you can't pop the hood later when the fire brigade arrives so they open it with an axe.  Basically if you don't have a fire extinguisher to put it out early, the thing will burn."
IdiotsFightingThings,3csucs,Borngrumpy,2,Sat Jul 11 09:05:27 2015 UTC,How come none of your advice is to not modify your car with nitrous and street race it illegally in the middle of the night?
IdiotsFightingThings,3csucs,bluntmasterflash,6,Sat Jul 11 04:52:04 2015 UTC,Because there were so many other poor decisions made before haha
IdiotsFightingThings,3csucs,AdamsHarv,2,Sat Jul 11 05:12:40 2015 UTC,"Yea, they did go wrong about a thousand times in a row."
IdiotsFightingThings,3csucs,bluntmasterflash,2,Sat Jul 11 05:14:00 2015 UTC,Plus its not even illegal to have a nitrous setup in a street car. In most states it is only illegal to have it hooked up. The illegal street racing was obviously dumb but atleast they had the decency to do it in a sparsely populated area...  Better then the idiots doing it at stoplights in DC traffic...

Here's a shortcut: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fuvjwkX-v4#t=120  This is a good example of the stupidity of ""wet"" nitrous kits. The nitrous isn't what's on fire here... The disaster is because of the additional fuel line that they ran with it, which injects gasoline into the intake manifold or throttle body, which has some inherent flaws, and it's also often done in a way that's not installed well and not electronically controlled well. I've personally seen several disasters due to these setups... Fortunately, they usually just explode the intake manifold and don't always start a huge gasoline fire."
IdiotsFightingThings,3csucs,WestonP,3,Sat Jul 11 05:16:14 2015 UTC,Using a flame arrestor instead of a traditional air filter isn't a bad idea either. That is until you have the kinks worked out. Air filters are flammable and that is no bueno when it comes to containing a fire.

IdiotsFightingThings,3aur5z,Turakamu,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:39:31 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see. He's the US we're not getting out of. He's our ingroup.    Edit: no, wait. He's the people in an outgroup that can't be removed from that group. And outgroups are called handcuffs. It's simple, really."
IdiotsFightingThings,3aur5z,Quietus42,-1,Wed Jun 24 12:28:35 2015 UTC,There are techniques to easily break handcuffs.  ones commonly used in the states.  Just gotta form a nice lever and/or work the metal.  'sides they're really trivial to pick.  and I carry a handcuff key on me at all times.  so yeah i'm gettting out of 'em.
IdiotsFightingThings,3aur5z,Silverlight42,3,Wed Jun 24 12:32:04 2015 UTC,"I dunno. Manufactured things are often enough prone to defects, and the human body is surprisingly tenacious. This might jar them and leave their wrists sore, but they're probably just as fine as the handcuffs they're wearing otherwise."
IdiotsFightingThings,3aur5z,tornato7,11,Wed Jun 24 12:43:21 2015 UTC,Maybe their wrists are fine after this but I don't think you'd be able to break the handcuffs before breaking your wrist. Especially because there's no real instant of force on the cuffs here.
IdiotsFightingThings,3aur5z,6chan,4,Tue Jun 23 22:56:17 2015 UTC,"Like I said, the handcuffs are probably fine too. haha  That's absolutely not an optimal method for breaking handcuff links."

Yea we just show up sometimes, but sometimes we're asked to. But hey, when you're the worlds biggest empire, you get to do pretty much what you want. I don't agree with everything my country does around the world, but if Canada could trade places with our economic and military power, believe me, they would. Not everybody hates us. A lot of its jealousy. You know why most western European countries and Canada get a single payer system? Because we pay for it. I would love to have single payer here, but you can't have the military we have and single payer too. You can't have both. We pay for yours and western Europe's protection and that frees up your budget to spend more on social programs. Capitalism isn't evil."

For one, why are they shooting plaster dummies that occasionally, inexplicably explode in a comical fashion? Why are they testing 'medium range rifles' at point-blank ranges?  There's so much more that goes into these weapons. The AK will have better penetration of light cover, performance against armor, and reliability. The M4 is far more accurate, is capable of greater sustained fire at a higher rate, has much more manageable recoil, has far superior ironsights, and can be tricked out with doodads so you can, you know, fight at night.  A close-quarters shoot house is, like, the WORST scenario to showcase each weapons' strengths.  Also, the PSL is not a terribly accurate rifle. It's a DMR, not a sniper rifle. It might have worked at that 100m range, but push it out to 300-500 and it would struggle to keep up.  But you know, the Nork can deliver a sick karate chop so that's cool."

By all accounts, the North Koreans do not mess around, and they train on the assumption that they'll be using lower-tech stuff than the US.  The US front line troops are reliant on their support base, and haven't fought anything approaching a symmetrical war in over half a century. When it comes down to a toe-to-toe fight, you would expect at the very least that there would be very heavy casualties.  In an all-out war between the US and North Korea, the US would win an overwhelming victory. That much is fairly clear. But not because of the skill of individual soldiers. Rather, because US military technology is hands-down the best in the world. The air war would already be over just as the ground war got under way, and that would leave the US troops with all the support they'd need. North Korea wouldn't be able to do a thing against US satellite intelligence, radar, logistics, long-range weaponry and the like."

IdiotsFightingThings,38ypxo,crazyloof,19,Mon Jun 8 19:29:05 2015 UTC,"No because skinny is the default. Most people are skinny. So saying ""the skinny guy stumbling around"" would be kind of redundant"
IdiotsFightingThings,38ypxo,FatherSpliffmas710,15,Mon Jun 8 02:29:10 2015 UTC,"Well (just being an ass here) in fact the majority of people are overweight, at least in the US! Though I agree with your comment, just because you say someone is fat doesn't mean you're fat shaming or fat hating."
IdiotsFightingThings,38ypxo,BCSounds,9,Mon Jun 8 02:45:13 2015 UTC,Won't change the default. One package of human comes as skinny and then some people transform it into fat just like q-tips comes as cleaning tool as default but we put it in our ears anyway.
IdiotsFightingThings,38ypxo,AkaParazIT,-10,Mon Jun 8 06:09:51 2015 UTC,"You're right that people aren't supposed to be fat but if a majority of people are fat, then fat becomes the default at least when you are describing somebody."
IdiotsFightingThings,38ypxo,CaptainK3v,15,Mon Jun 8 07:34:00 2015 UTC,Fact becomes the norm in that situation not the default. Default is what the human body would look like under normal circumstances.
IdiotsFightingThings,38ypxo,Gibtohom,-7,Mon Jun 8 07:38:48 2015 UTC,"Depends on context though. Like in the case of describing a person in Pakistan, pakistani would be the default even though the most common demographic would be chinese or indian.   Besides the definition of ""default"" is    a preselected option adopted by a computer program or other mechanism when no alternative is specified by the user or programmer.   that wouldn't be ""what should take place barring any kind of unhealthy lifestyle chocie""  It would just be the most common, which in this case is fat."
IdiotsFightingThings,38ypxo,CaptainK3v,5,Mon Jun 8 08:53:34 2015 UTC,"Nope, that's not what default means."

IdiotsFightingThings,38ypxo,CaptainK3v,2,Mon Jun 8 17:14:31 2015 UTC,"So just say ""Just looked like a guy stumbling around"" then.  ...Tbh I'm fat myself and don't get nearly this touchy, just playing 'devil's advocate'."

IdiotsFightingThings,38ypxo,hachiko007,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:01:14 2015 UTC,"You're right, a katana actually wobbles due to its softer core when slicing.

Sure, it might seem strange to build top quality swords to hit a slab of dead pig, but then it could also be seen as strange to build top quality clubs to hit a sphere of rubber, too.  Just let these people enjoy what they're doing, they're not hurting anyone. Don't like the video? At least have a valid reason, like it's insulting, or doesn't follow the title etc. Rather than being like ""kek this guy threw a sword at a large ice-cube to entertain people who would like to see that shit because it's not really a common thing that you can do at home.

IdiotsFightingThings,38ypxo,Decyde,49,Mon Jun 8 17:06:33 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much exactly what happened to me when I threw a tomahawk at a log a few years ago, except the tomahawk hit me blade first directly in the tendons below my knee. It hit the log and bounced back seven or eight feet which I thought was a safe distance. It was not.   Thankfully I wasn't hurt, it did cut my jeans up but the jeans saved me from a trip to the emergency room and from having a new best friend walking cane for the rest of my life. Lesson was learned, don't do stupid stuff and never under estimate how far something can bounce back at you if physics really want to screw you over.   The guy in the OP is extremely lucky, he almost got seriously hurt"
IdiotsFightingThings,38ypxo,JackRayleigh,41,Mon Jun 8 15:22:09 2015 UTC,"Seven or eight feet seems super close. Now nine feet, that is a safe distance if I've ever heard of one."

We're practicing knife throwing and stand back about 7-8 feet throwing at a target built just for this.  Guy throws, knife hits oddly and rebounds nearly straight back at him.  Thankfully it dropped significantly before it reached him and he managed to react and turn away so it only got him on the calf a bit.  Funnily enough we had a surgeon who was a student as well and was there that night so the guy got checked out by him immediately.  Was still pretty damn scary."
IdiotsFightingThings,38ypxo,notapoke,2,Mon Jun 8 11:13:05 2015 UTC,Your safe distance on something like that is usually around 25 feet but can be even farther if the metal fragments. Be safe

The reason most knife or blade enthusiasts don't like Cold Steel is that they use very cheap stainless steel and then overcharge for their bandsaw made blades.

IdiotsFightingThings,37vr8m,Squishy90,2,Sun May 31 03:18:02 2015 UTC,toward the end you can tell the pole is getting kind of freaked out
IdiotsFightingThings,37vr8m,starboard_sighed,2,Sun May 31 03:19:01 2015 UTC,"Being NYC I'm sure he was just rehearing his lines on his way to theatre rehearsal of The Stoic Silent Skinny Gangster, in which he plays the part of Gangster#2 who, after learning that the Star for whom the play title describes , being played by the pole in this rehearsal rendition, has just entered the subway, desires to know from just what set the said Skinny Stoic Gangster represents.  Sadly, to get the full effect of the piece you really need to see it with both sides being portrayed by people.  Some of the more powerful  lines spoken in response to Gangster#2's inquiries include, ""Why, I don't really believe I have to tell you from which set I come."" And  ""Surely from these colorful bandanas I am wearing someone as astute as yourself can see my allegiances, rendering the majority of your questions semi-redundant."" And  ""No, I am not a pussy, though I have been known to shed a tear on occasion at the sight of puppies playing...Son."" If interested I think it still might be playing off Broadway."

IdiotsFightingThings,37aq96,kitten_based_economy,88,Tue May 26 07:19:47 2015 UTC,I would have thought trying to knock the shelves apart instead of together would have been a better choice.
IdiotsFightingThings,37aq96,spookyjohnathan,5,Tue May 26 07:30:10 2015 UTC,I think he actually is trying to knock them together. Lots of cheap all-the-assembly-required furniture recommends to use a rubber mallet to knock the pegs together.
IdiotsFightingThings,37aq96,5eraph,14,Tue May 26 15:13:02 2015 UTC,Why would he be two-hand swinging it between the shelves then?
IdiotsFightingThings,37aq96,dubblix,10,Tue May 26 17:09:53 2015 UTC,Looks like he's swinging at the top. And we already know he has bad aim.
IdiotsFightingThings,37aq96,5eraph,5,Tue May 26 17:16:20 2015 UTC,That is a fair point.
IdiotsFightingThings,37aq96,BigSwedenMan,3,Tue May 26 17:39:50 2015 UTC,"Well really, no matter what scenario we go with here, I think it's fair to assume he's an idiot. If he's trying to break it apart, he's using the wrong tool and hitting it from the wrong direction. If he's trying to assemble it, he's hitting it in the wrong spot and with the totally wrong technique. Either way you look at it he's making at least 2 mistakes."
IdiotsFightingThings,37aq96,5eraph,3,Wed May 27 00:15:46 2015 UTC,And that's certainly the important thing. He's an idiot.
IdiotsFightingThings,37aq96,spookyjohnathan,1 point,Wed May 27 00:43:59 2015 UTC,"He isn't. He's swinging at the top, the side facing us, knocking it towards the bottom. He hits it where he's supposed to. He's just using too much force. It's meant to be tapped."

IdiotsFightingThings,36frsg,Thatomeglekid,2,Tue May 19 10:12:44 2015 UTC,That doesn't make any sense. What brand did you buy exactly? I've played at several fields. Yeah they don't last for ever but they are built to take punishment. They are thick rubber. Yeah you replace or reset the anchors fairly often but that isn't the fault of the bunker. Speedball fields hold up fairly well. We had teams playing at Least once a week with the casuals wreaking havoc  the rest of the week. They all lasted at least two plus years. That's including the snake bunkers that had people diving on top of them regularly. Don't fault the overall product just because your field didn't drop the coin on the good stuff. There is always the shit version of the gold standard. You can buy ebay Speedball fields or you can spend the money and buy the psp or nppl bunkers that will last.
IdiotsFightingThings,36frsg,DanglyBitsTheFirst,5,Tue May 19 11:13:48 2015 UTC,"i don't remember the brand but they were used at World Cup that's where we bought them.

His speed isn't measured, his strength isn't measured, his mass isn't measured, and his bravery isn't measured.   He's not running very fast—he's not at full stride. He stops running through the wall—he literally stops at it and leans his way through it. I'm just not seeing anything physically impressive here. And if you really do think that this is physically impressive, you should stack up a single layer of bricks and run at them. If you bounce off and the bricks don't budge, you'll know you were right."
IdiotsFightingThings,35ilsq,vivifiction,0,Mon May 11 19:41:35 2015 UTC,Thats not even close to the same. I don't know God damn shit about rugby and I could throw my body at those bricks just as well as that guy. How is this supposed to impress the players?

Incidentally, a much less fit person could've simply walked through the stack of bricks he slammed himself through."

There are hundreds of thousands of rugby league players who could run through a pile of bricks - how many of them would do it with the same commitment if asked?  Being able to put thoughts of self-preservation aside and having that mental toughness to not give a fuck about your own health is rare. If he'll run face first into a brick wall, you can probably count on him to hit a wall of defenders real hard.   It's like asking someone to punch a cinder block as hard as they can. Even if you had money waved in front of you, most people are going to hold back because they don't want a broken hand. Or I could get 10 people and say let me punch you in the face for $1,000 but you can't flinch - I bet the majority if not all of them flinch.   I can bet that people who know a lot more about rugby league than you do have been impressed by this video.   PS. And it is a wall. Get a dictionary guys."

Heck, it's pretty much the basis for this entire subreddit.   having that mental toughness to not give a fuck about your own health is rare.   Is it all that rare amongst rugby players, or is it perhaps one of the defining characteristics of them? Also, is it the basis for this entire subreddit?   I can bet that people who know a lot more about rugby league than you do have been impressed by this video.   You shouldn't assume that someone has no knowledge of something just because they disagree with you. While I don't follow rugby anymore, I did play it for a number of years.   PS. And it is a wall. Get a dictionary guys.   Wall (from google define: wall)   a continuous vertical brick or stone structure that encloses or divides an area of land. nope a side of a building or room, typically forming part of the building's structure. nope any high vertical surface or facade, especially one that is imposing in scale. No, as it is neither high nor imposing a thing perceived as a protective or restrictive barrier. definitely not since it would have fallen down had they not held it up   So this is almost certainly not a wall, according to the dictionary."

It also makes for a stronger wall since the mortar partially fills in the holes when it's trowelled on. Most load-bearing brick walls built today are made of ""three hole"" bricks. ""Five hole"" and ""eight hole"" bricks are also used.  If you see a brick without holes in a brickyard/hardware store today, it's probably a paver and not a construction brick."

IdiotsFightingThings,353ltm,Yokogake,2,Thu May 7 00:31:56 2015 UTC,It looks like a fairly genuine fall to me. I don't know where you're getting he's leaping from. People hop like that fairly regularly when they hurt their foot/lower leg. Losing balance after that is just the next natural step for said idiot who fought the stairs.
IdiotsFightingThings,353ltm,Obscene_farmer,6,Wed May 6 21:09:40 2015 UTC,"I get that because of the way he grabbed the pole, braces, and guides himself down the stairs. There is also a pause between when he starts falling and where he checks where he needs to land.  He speeds up to start (first falling), slows down (checking where to land) and then speeds up again.  It strikes me as someone who is trying to fall in a certain place or way, not someone who is surprised that they are falling down the stairs.    If he was truly falling I think there is an incredibly powerful instinct to hold and grip onto anything to stop yourself.  Even though he got his hand on something it does not look like he attempted to grip but more slowed and braced.  I dunno, just strikes me as planned."

Idiot wants to break something (the milk jugs), succeeds, and ends up hurting himself in the process.

It's one of those posts that could be considered within the rules, but probably isn't. You also might notice that it was removed.  Remember that modding is not a full-time thing for us, AFAIK. I, personally, am near the end of a semester of college. We do our best to keep submissions within the rules. In fact, there are far more posts that you don't see while trying to come up with examples to complain that this sub ""needs better modding,"" but we're removed before you could.  The best way to actually help the sub is not to make some unhelpful post complaining about the mod team, but to report those submissions that you feel break the rules so that they're brought specifically to our attention. These reports include if you think the submission needs a flair to indicate disturbing content. Just include it in the report.

I am making my post based on the definition that ""fighting something"" is exactly that, someone attempting to fight something....  There are 9 mods that are on the list, you don't have to be the only one looking it over, and neither was that my insinuation. I just messaged the mods to get some attention on it.

IdiotsFightingThings,34ynw8,Milkywayne,7,Tue May 5 19:39:29 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. You said ""wanting to break things"" is ""fighting things.""  Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.  As someone who is an idiot who studies physical aggression, I am telling you, specifically, in idiocy, no one calls wanting to break things, ""fighting"". If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""fighting"" you're referring to the overall concept of Violence, which includes things from murder to rape to assault.  So your reasoning for calling this subreddit ""wanting to break things"" is because random people ""post plain idiots?"" Let's get blue jays and crows in here, then, too.  Also, calling something ""breaking things"" or ""fighting?"" It's not one or the other, that's not how violence works. It's both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said breaking things is fighting, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

A boy deliberately throws milk, spilling it all over the floor.   Which one of the two options listed above is a serious situation with significant implications?    A boy (3) deliberately throws a sippycup of milk from his high-chair, spilling it all over the floor. Poor mom! A boy (17) deliberately throws two unopened cartons of milk on the floor of the supermarket, and subsequently slips on it, breaking his jaw. Poor lil guy!   Context matters, doesn't it?"

The kid would also have to pay for EMS if they did come, so i don't see the issue there. another customer never did fall, so that point is invalid, but if they did, just do what everyone else would do: Sue for damages.  I don't see why you think the kid deserves to have a crippling injury for doing this.

Hell Ive made messes followed by the audible ""oops""  It was never about making things clean again, not to us, it was about who was better.

IdiotsFightingThings,34p1r7,fuckyourkitty,10,Sun May 3 15:53:17 2015 UTC,Doesn't mean it's not staged. The TV could have been broken prior but they staged it and he actually threw the controller at it anyway.
IdiotsFightingThings,34p1r7,GayFesh,9,Sun May 3 20:40:32 2015 UTC,Just because its staged doesn't mean they used a broken tv
IdiotsFightingThings,34p1r7,fuckyourkitty,5,Sun May 3 22:50:39 2015 UTC,https://youtu.be/CvrjAeVKQB8  At around 20s you can see the corner of the screen and an area of dead pixels. The screen was broken prior... not that it matters. It looks like they broke it by accident then staged the scene for shits and giggles.

IdiotsFightingThings,34p1r7,fuckyourkitty,1 point,Mon May 4 00:42:24 2015 UTC,It is around the 20 second mark maybe 21/22. In the bottom left corner of the video player you can see a small portion of the screen. When that is playing you get a glimpse of the the broken part of the screen. For a couple of frames you can see a dark area of dead pixels at an angle. I'd take a screen grab but the youtube controls displays over the top of the area whenever I try.

If I recall correctly, genetic studies have shown that 2/3 of our ancestors are women. Think about that - for every two women who successfully reproduce, there's a man who was the end of his bloodline. This also means that the average reproducing historical man has twice the influence on the gene pool as the average reproducing historical woman.  There's some evidence that men simply have a lot more variance than women do. More likely to be CEO; more likely to be homeless and/or insane. Stunts like this are probably just an example of that variance. If they fuck it up, they die. If they succeed, they make a famous TV show. But if they never try anything risky, there's an annoyingly large chance their genes die out anyway.  So, yep, risk-taking comes with the Y chromosome."

IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,free_range_human,396,Mon Apr 27 02:34:52 2015 UTC,Perfectly reasonable response to that situation.
IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,stefanmago,8,Sun Apr 26 23:32:44 2015 UTC,I think he handled it pretty well. No collateral damage. Could have smashed the door onto the grill and what not. Showed self restrain in a difficult situation. Cudos.
IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,super_awesome_jr,3,Sun Apr 26 19:39:38 2015 UTC,He did safely disengage the screen and move it away from the glass sliding doors before relieving his frustration.
IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,q9rtn,136,Mon Apr 27 07:33:32 2015 UTC,No. He was trying to fix it the wrong way. The right way to do it would have been to pull the door out (which is what happened) and then to put it back rightly (instead of smashing it and throwing it out). He quit exactly when things started to go right.
IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,awnawnamoose,62,Mon Apr 27 17:41:02 2015 UTC,"This is right. But so often I want it to be wrong. I want it to be smashing things. That's the answer. Smash them. If they don't come after gingerly tugging, put all your weight into it until you make it come free by breaking it."
IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,binary_digit,2,Sun Apr 26 22:18:25 2015 UTC,You only need to smash it once.  You'll never have to fix it again.
IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,IlllllIIlllIIllIIIII,22,Mon Apr 27 00:04:13 2015 UTC,"I've got a similar sliding door. The design is inherently faulty, and it gets even worse with any grit/dirt in the wheels or track, which is inevitable."
IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,surfnaked,11,Tue May 5 01:32:33 2015 UTC,"Yup, keeping the track clean is the answer even though the track will never stay clean more than about ten minutes. Also lube the wheels. . .which attracts dirt. Back to square one."
IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,the__duke,12,Mon Apr 27 00:44:25 2015 UTC,"I service these for a living. There are four holes in each corner to raise or lower the wheels with a Phillips screw driver.  To lubricate the track, use silicon lubricant spray. If you know what you're doing, you don't have to smash it."
IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,surfnaked,2,Mon Apr 27 04:44:51 2015 UTC,"I know all that now, and the trick is to keep them tight in the track so the door doesn't wobble.   That was from before that, and it was more fun. Those damn things can be infuriating. The other trick of course it to buy good quality doors that adjust. I did have a door that didn't. So I feel that guy."
IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,disguy2k,2,Mon Apr 27 10:54:48 2015 UTC,Use graphite powder.

IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,BloodFeastIslandMan,118,Mon Apr 27 09:42:42 2015 UTC,That'll teach the screen door a lesson.

IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,Gorgggg,4,Sun Apr 26 21:40:32 2015 UTC,Those frames are cheap unless you buy specialty ones. 70$ would be one pre-assembled.

IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,wasdy1,1 point,Sun Apr 26 23:08:18 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it all depends on measurements and the hardware on the door. Some things are sized to be propitiatory and can only been bought from the manufacturer. The thing is, we will never know from this video."

IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,hymntastic,16,Mon Apr 27 02:01:24 2015 UTC,The screens doors aren't too expensive. The difficult part is finding one that fits perfectly. As I found out the hard way there are numerous different sizes for screen doors.
IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,rit100,8,Sun Apr 26 19:37:28 2015 UTC,After trying a few of those one size fits all models at home depot I had one custom made.  Still going after ten years.  Still gets stuck sometimes too.  I feel that guy's pain.

IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,ImpossibleKintsugi,1 point,Sun Apr 26 20:24:39 2015 UTC,We had ours rethreaded for like 40 dollars. The frame also needed minor repair but it's just fine now.
IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,Gorgggg,2,Sun Apr 26 20:42:49 2015 UTC,"So ya can take these little tools that look like pizza cutters without the cutting edge, and some screen material, oh and a zipknife, and fix your screen in less than 10 minutes for far less than that all in. Unless you have one of those wrought iron patterned screens, might be worth it to pay just so you dont have to deal with all that."
IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,PopeOfMeat,6,Sun Apr 26 21:38:07 2015 UTC,"fix your screen in less than 10 minutes   Bullshit! First you rip out the old screen, then you cut the new screen to fit, then you start rollering it into place, then you realize you cut it too fucking small, then you rip it out, head back to the store for more screen, then start over, then you get to about halfway done and realize that the screen is loose as shit, then you rip it out and try again, but now your screen is all fucked because the edges have been stretched by the pizza cutter thing, so it's back to the home center again, this time you get it pulled tight and half way through the fucking pizza cutter breaks, so then your left trying to scrunch the rubber into the track with a ball-point pen, finally you get it in, but the rubber was not long enough and the bottom corner has a six inch gap, finally, several hours late you scream ""Fuck it!"" and throw the screen over the balcony edge like this guy did and just buy a flyswatter."

IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,Arquette,44,Mon Apr 27 01:11:53 2015 UTC,An easy solution for this is to rub a candlestick on the track. The wax acts like a lubricant and the door will slide like new.

IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,asyork,7,Sun Apr 26 23:09:53 2015 UTC,I'm always surprised when I am reminded of how few people even know graphite lubricant exists.

IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,s33plusplus,5,Sun Apr 26 22:49:16 2015 UTC,Really? I scribble on the teeth of keys with a pencil to fix sticky locks all the time. Same for odd jobs like the scroll wheel of my mouse. It's an incredibly underrated lubricant.
IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,antidamage,8,Sun Apr 26 23:53:48 2015 UTC,"Careful, it's also very conductive"
IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,asyork,3,Mon Apr 27 01:10:17 2015 UTC,"Is it different than WD-40? If so, I've never heard of it. I'm 30."
IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,turdovski,5,Mon Apr 27 04:09:20 2015 UTC,"WD-40 is really more of a solvent. It will clean buildup off of what you use it on, but won't lubricate it long term. It's also wet, so if you do spray it onto something particularly messy, it will just help clump all the gunk together unless you wipe it off.  Graphite lubricant is just powdered graphite. It will coat whatever you put it on and make it move more freely after you move it around a few times. It is a dry lubricant, so it won't gunk anything up or help clean anything off."
IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,chaon93,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:26:33 2015 UTC,So just draw over what you need lubricated with a pencil? Or they sell special graphite in home depot?

IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,rabidfish91,1 point,Mon Apr 27 04:02:33 2015 UTC,A pencil will do the same job for a little more effort. Powdered graphite is already in the state you want it and usually comes in a kind of puffer dispenser.
IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,JamesK852,2,Mon Apr 27 04:18:11 2015 UTC,WD-40 is not as much of a lubricant as people tend to think.  It's more about unsticking things than keeping them moving.  Incidentally it's also a great chrome polish!    Graphite is a dry lube.  Won't help get shit unstuck but will significantly reduce friction.
IdiotsFightingThings,33y4ym,bubongo,2,Mon Apr 27 04:17:52 2015 UTC,Its scary how many people don't realize that WD40 is not the same as grease

IdiotsFightingThings,33ijzu,SunrocRetori,-2,Thu Apr 23 11:52:10 2015 UTC,More adrenaline than football? But football has way more contact. Not as if we could measure. To prove either of us right anyways.
IdiotsFightingThings,33ijzu,sellyourselfshort,9,Thu Apr 23 08:00:12 2015 UTC,"Football also has constant stops though, which lets them cool down a bit. In hockey they keep playing until a goal, offside, icing, or penalty. Hell, just today in the Montreal/Ottawa game there was 7 minutes of uninterrupted play. Not too mention that while football has more contact, the hits in hockey can be much much harder. Imagine a 230 pound guy skating faster than any football player can run and slamming another guy into a wall, only for it to end with another guy coming up and punching the hitter in the face because that is totally what happens on a regular basis."
IdiotsFightingThings,33ijzu,SunrocRetori,5,Thu Apr 23 08:08:05 2015 UTC,"Adrenaline can get boosted from anticipation as well. Which football has a lot of mental aspects. As for hit power I would be interested to see numbers on that. I know american football has harder hits than rugby, so I just assumed football was the hardest hitting sport. Guess I never thought about hockeys speed."
IdiotsFightingThings,33ijzu,sellyourselfshort,4,Thu Apr 23 08:12:03 2015 UTC,"I'm sure the adrenaline is pretty even on both, I don't mean to discredit football, its just that watching hockey and seeing all the jabs, slashes, pokes with sticks, grabs and everything else players get away with, it's just the kinda shit that gets the blood boiling and really makes you want to go nuts on someone.

In an interview he admitted losing his temper for a split second when he saw the ball cross the goal line and as a result headbutted the crossbar in anger. He said it looked worse than it was and the only downside has been his teammates making fun of him.  http://www.mbl.is/sport/fotbolti/2015/04/21/vildu_meina_ad_eg_vaeri_rugladur/

Tape one end of the fishing line to the tennis ball, then the lob the ball over the branch that the plane is resting on. Then you can either shake it loose or slide the line down the branch and knock the plane loose. If the plane is in the top of a really really tall tree, you might be better off using One of those tennis ball slingshots (for playing with dogs) to get the ball up over the right branch."

IdiotsFightingThings,32yqga,a_random_username,16,Fri Apr 17 21:46:25 2015 UTC,Do we have some confirmation that he didn't die?
IdiotsFightingThings,32yqga,Bromanship,8,Sat Apr 18 01:11:25 2015 UTC,Yeah he might not have been crushed and I'm not a doctor but I think the head trauma here might have been enough to do it.
IdiotsFightingThings,32yqga,Vermonty_Python,6,Sat Apr 18 01:59:46 2015 UTC,"I dunno. The way the tree breaks, it looks like it breaks over his upper back/shoulders, not his head. And in the very last frames, you can see the guy looking to the side, and he's still on his knees.   When it happened to my friend, it was obvious immediately that he was dead. No movement. No reaction. Lots of blood. Granted, that was a bigger tree, and it's only one example.... Just sharing an anecdote, is all."

IdiotsFightingThings,32yqga,FlyMyPretty,2,Sat Apr 18 16:11:24 2015 UTC,I think the even smarter thing is to use a rope that's 2.5x longer than the tree is high.
IdiotsFightingThings,32yqga,cmubigguy,1 point,Sat Apr 18 16:44:31 2015 UTC,Pretty sure the rope he runs under was supposed to be the top of the tree when it fell over. They calculated wrong. Pretty sure he thought he was safe because he made it past the rope.

IdiotsFightingThings,32yqga,Makabaer,1 point,Fri Apr 17 22:40:50 2015 UTC,He was wearing camouflage all along. I think it's the lighting that makes it looks very dark in the beginning and lighter in the end.

Animal abuse of any kind really sets me off.  Slightly unrelated story, when I was pretty young, my sister had a pet gerbil. He had a gerbil ball, and when our parents had a party, the gerbil was being looked at by some kids (8-10yrs old). The kids decided it would be a good idea to take the gerbil out and put it in his ball, then throw it around. At that young an age, I knew that it was incredibly messed up to do that to an animal, and it makes me sick to this day."

No instructions were apparent for either the clock or the hanger doohicky in the box. So I was compelled to fuck with it a bit to make sure I was getting the gist properly before attempting to hang it. I decided it looked a bit flimsy and drove a nail into a wooden wall stud instead. Still I found apparatus  fascinating, so I was fucking with it later on.  TL;DR: Drove a blunt metal nail about 6 mm  (1/4"") under my thumbnail. Pain like a mother!

IdiotsFightingThings,3211qm,LeCrushinator,5,Fri Apr 10 16:50:58 2015 UTC,"https://youtu.be/ixfHxOnGJPI  The street lights are AC so they will be changing brightness with the current, but for the entire phase they are emitting light.  The car lights are LEDs that run off DC. A driver circuit is turning the LED on and off at a specific frequency. The reason they are pulsed is because they look just as bright, but because they are actually off for a oarge percentage of the time they use even less power and generate less heat.  So if the camera's shutter is out of sync for an AC light it will appear either bright or dim. If the camera's shutter is out of sync for a pulsed LED it will appear either on or off.  This is why the street light appears to shimmer and the LED appears to flicker.  Hope that helps."
IdiotsFightingThings,3211qm,squired,4,Fri Apr 10 20:45:50 2015 UTC,Yeah - light strobing is only really a problem in slow motion or if you have identical cycles in the camera and light and the recording and light cycles are synced perfectly wrong.
IdiotsFightingThings,3211qm,coffeetablesex,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:44:24 2015 UTC,"Actually /u/Meral_Harbes is correct. The lights are LEDs, which flicker rapidly. Depending on the shutter of the camera you will or won't see some LEDs on depending on the frame.  Take any camera and point them at any LED light and you may get a similar result."

IdiotsFightingThings,3211qm,bmwculture,1 point,Thu Apr 9 21:20:55 2015 UTC,it's probably the power cycle on the LEDs and the frame rate of the camera syncing up to make it appear that the LEDs are off longer than they actually are

IdiotsFightingThings,3211qm,ample_mammal,0,Fri Apr 10 03:08:55 2015 UTC,It is a standard safety feature. They blink when the emergency lights are turned on or during extreme braking. It reduces rear-end collisions and pileups.
IdiotsFightingThings,3211qm,afterthefire1,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:20:42 2015 UTC,"when the emergency lights are turned on   There is switch somewhere in your car that makes all lights flash (usually visually labelled as a triangle).

Because no one in the trans community was vocal enough in opposing this kind of behavior or language, you now get a stereotype.  Stereotypes exist for a reason (think white trash, black gangster, Muslim terrorist), if the majority in that community don't do enough to repudiate it, then it sticks.

Wouldn't a comment about the validity or lack thereof of a specific stereotype be more relevant if you had experience in the field at hand?  You are also confusing how they work. It is not assuming that everyone sharing a datapoint therefore follows the stereotype. But it IS appreciating clusters. And for reasons of marketing, targeted audience and pricer-range and internal communication of ""the in group"" certain types of vehicles draw more attention of certain kinds of people.  It's a bit like political affiliation. True, not every person preferring one party over the other is the epitome of the worst aspects of said party, but that doesn't mean there aren't major statistical groupings of stereotypes going on."

IdiotsFightingThings,31ppnq,dgrimm121,14,Tue Apr 7 14:49:23 2015 UTC,"The laws aren't about being fair. They are about controlling the population, and are political moves for lawmakers. Taking the drinking age from 18 to 21 made politicians look good at the time. There were a lot of drinking related accidents at the time, and politicians wanted to look like they were doing something about it.  Though it's not the drinking age that's the problem, but rather the drinking culture.    For example, if you go out drinking in America, how do you get home? Well you have to drive or take a cab. Why? Generally, there's no place to drink within walking distance. Even if there were, you'd have cops arresting you while you were walking home for public intoxication.    The problem is the culture. Or, I should say, the stick up the conservative American people's asses.  There SHOULD be a pub/taver/bar in every neighborhood. Then you could walk down to the pub, have a few beers, and walk back home when you felt like.  Also, we need to reform public intoxication laws so people don;t feel like they are going to get arrested for walking home after being in a bar.   But then people would have to admit that drinking isn;t the problem, but how we demonize it, and how we make it a taboo. That's the real problem. People seeking to rebel flock to the taboo activities, spitballing the problem. And those who want to be seen as right and just and clean sit on their high-horse and say, ""A bar? Not in my neighborhood."" or ""I don't want that near my kids""  They think they are protecting their kids, but they are really teaching them that when they are older, angsty, and want to rebel, the best way to do it is to sneak off and go out drinking.  And then since they have to get home somehow, and they're poor young adults who can't always afford a cab ride, they drive home drunk and boom! Now we have a few less young adults.   And the politicians still want to seem like they are combating the issue. So they raise fines and institute more penalties, rather than work on the root of the problem.  Oh and all the townships' get an increased revenue stream that they can use to militarize the police force. Yay!"
IdiotsFightingThings,31ppnq,brassninja,3,Tue Apr 7 17:24:02 2015 UTC,"It's not as simple as putting bars in more places, America has a very deep rooted relationship with cars and driving. This whole country is on a huge plot of land with many cities being spread out with lots of space. In America it's not only common, but practically expected that every adult has a license and a car. In the small town I grew up in the closest corner store was a 10 minute drive and the town had no public transportation.   I agree with you that America has this weird taboo about drinking which only results in a binge drinking problem. But it's gonna be a long ass road to reform."

It doesn't mean the driver SHOULD run him over, but if it's a matter of saving their life against an unstable and uncertain threat, (where quick timing and fast thinking can save or kill you).  There would be no shame in hitting him with the car to immobilize this vicious and unprovoked threat against the driver, yet if it's fight or flight, hitting him and fleeing kills two birds with one stone..! (JK) A little fight, a little flight! (Seriously tho hopefully trying not to wound fatally; just enough so he temporarily cannot move and further terrorize the people inside anymore), or driver could flee the area to escape without touching him. If they immobilized the attacker to then call the police if the driver felt it safe to stick around and give a statement / arrange for charges to be pressed / restraining order filed against this random attack by a clearly mentally-ill individual, that's just as well too.  He may have grown up in the projects, but he is not gangster.. it's sociopathic preying on those who are both unaware and defenseless for nothing more than proving he can and will, as well as putting on a show to look tough. I doubt any jail or rehabilitation can mend this damaged, raging person. He most likely had a rough up-bringing. If it wasn't the PT Cruiser he targeted, it would have been a different innocent victims car. Hope karma serves him up proper."

IdiotsFightingThings,314dd9,UnknownSense,42,Thu Apr 2 02:19:06 2015 UTC,"I tried to find some info, or a news story about this and turned up nothing.  Not sure how helpful this is, but someone said they emailed the Las Vegas police about it and that they said it was staged.     I emailed the Las Vegas Police Department with a link to the video. The response from the Office of Public Information was, in part:  ""This video WAS staged in Las Vegas on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Sahara about 8 to 10 years ago. The LVMPD was not aware of the incident until after it took place, and after an investigation, it was determined to have been staged.""   http://message.snopes.com/showpost.php?p=259543&postcount=60  That was posted in 2007, 8-10 years would put the video around 1997 and 1999.  PT Cruisers didn't exist until 2000, which could have just been a mistake by the cop.  So it could be a few things:   The police investigation was wrong, and it wasn't staged. The responding officer overshot how long ago the incident took place, but it was staged. The guy was lying and didn't contact LV PD. The guy was being truthful, and it legitimately was a hoax. Real and done for money for Bumfights which was popular around that time.   The location is correct anyway, here's the exact spot:   https://www.google.com/maps/@36.143837,-115.157349,3a,75y,5.47h,70.1t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1slQrWe4SO1SuCZcbRTxaynw!2e0!6m1!1e1  I feel pretty confident in my crackhead detection skills, and this definitely did not look like acting.. but who knows.  Conclusion:  Dunno.  My guess is Bumfights.  The music and cuts at the beginning look very ""edited for TV"".  Not staged like it's an actor, just that they paid a legit crackhead money to do something crazy."

If we have machines I would probably carefully wrap a chain around the supporting brick and tie it to the back of a bobkat (which is like a tiny bulldozer), and drive it away from the wall at a 90 degree angle. If the wall doesn't come down after that then I would get on a lift and start knocking out the top blocks one side to the other to let it fall in smaller pieces. If all we have is hand tools....there's not many safe ways to knock out the bottom. Maybe throw a sledge hammer at it or do the chain thing and get like four or five dudes to yank the brick out and hope it falls."

IdiotsFightingThings,2zojfx,stranebrain,8,Fri Mar 20 17:33:21 2015 UTC,"This is going to sound crazy but from the off, I didn't think for a second that the guy was being serious. That first movement was a left hand away from being a decent superman punch, and I think if I spun the way he did in the second I wouldn't have hit the bag.  My guess is he's a pretty athletic dude who's messing around. If anyone has the source I'm happy to be proved wrong but I think he's more legit than he's letting on.  But if not? Doesn't matter. The difference between him and someone who can fight well is the same as the difference between the average macho straight guy and someone who can fight well. The sort of people who watch a boxing or MMA match and at the end say ""why didn't he just hit him?"" are just as likely to get themselves killed in a confrontation."

IdiotsFightingThings,2yzwkc,Airazz,42,Sat Mar 14 12:56:12 2015 UTC,"When you are on a bike, physics are the supreme law of the land. It doesn't matter if you have right of way over a car. It doesn't matter what the legal system says about the situation. If the car chooses to occupy your space, physics says you are going to lose, and it will be broken bones not dented metal.  On a bike you are faster, smaller and more agile. Use it to your advantage to remove yourself from bad situations, not to continue to escalate them. Antagonizing someone while riding a bike is absolutely insane and people only get away with it because the drivers they antagonize really don't want anyone getting hurt. Anyone in a car with a mind to kill a biker damn well can, and with the number of mentally ill people in America, it's wise not to forget that.  Assholes and crazy people exist. Identify and avoid them, and your life becomes much better."
IdiotsFightingThings,2yzwkc,whothrowsitawaytoday,11,Sat Mar 14 15:34:31 2015 UTC,I was in a similar situation to this a while ago. And the messed up part is that I was actually trying to move out of the way because I saw the person coming up fast as hell behind me on a crotch rocket. Except he moved into the same lane and then proceeded to get in front of me and continuously brake check me. The whole time I'm thinking..this guy understands that if I don't brake in time that he's going to die or get severely fucked up right?
IdiotsFightingThings,2yzwkc,brandorobot,11,Sat Mar 14 17:45:58 2015 UTC,"People who brake check never understand how dangerous it is.   I've seen sports cars brake check big old trucks.   Yeah genius, a loaded down 1990  Ford Transit with drum brakes is going to have the same braking distance as your 2010 Mercedes.   The bitch about brake checking is that it's very hard to prove in court unless you've got a camera. ""Swoop and squat"" is a time honored insurance scam to make someone rear end you..."

IdiotsFightingThings,2yqm8p,NiceWeather4Leather,97,Thu Mar 12 11:35:07 2015 UTC,"The whole concept of avoiding ""triggering"" and expecting the whole world to walk on eggshells so that you don't get ""triggered"" is absolutely moronic.  I was actually raped as a child, and you know what the worst thing you can possibly do with a traumatic event like that is?  Pretend it didn't happen and avoid ever thinking about it and get upset whenever someone (usually unintentionally) ""triggers"" memories of the event.  And I've heard the same goes true for people with PTSD.  The worst thing they can do for their psyches is to try and avoid any image/sound/interaction in the world that might ""trigger"" a memory because that's a surefire way to never get past the trauma!  People need to deal with trauma.  If you are being ""triggered"" by a comment online you need to see a therapist to help you accept whatever trauma that occurred, accept what happened, and move past it."
IdiotsFightingThings,2yqm8p,Hyperdrunk,15,Thu Mar 12 06:34:13 2015 UTC,These people are more often than not putting on a show for attention. They don't do it to try and stop people from triggering them. They are doing it so all the other people who encourage their behavior swoop in to comfort them for a trauma they're not really experiencing. It's social immaturity. They should probably still see a therapist though.
IdiotsFightingThings,2yqm8p,micmea1,14,Thu Mar 12 14:26:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and it's not just that it doesn't help to enable avoidance behaviors.  The warnings are usually found on sites that make things that people are anxious about seem way worse than they are.  I think that in theory trigger warnings could make more sense than MPAA ratings on movies and more sense than things like NSFW labels on sites that you shouldn't be browsing at work to begin with... but the execution is terrible, and any use of it has kind of been turned into a ridiculous political thing that it shouldn't be.  They almost only exist on outlets that sensationalize the shit out of the kinds of things that could be considered ""triggering"", speciously parade around like they are the only voice for people that have triggers, and usually the warning comes after some kind of over the top clickbait headline followed by an ad revenue hungry article... something like this:    URBAN OUTFITTERS FACES CONTROVERSY AFTER MAKING A SHIRT THAT SAYS ""I'D RATHER BE DEAD THAN FAT""  trigger warning: eating disorders, suicide  Everyone in our society thinks it would be better if you were dead than to gain any weight, ever.  We think that's horrible but despite what we think our entire culture really despises any and all imperfection. especially yours  [American_Apparel_Ad.gif]   Sometimes when I'm worried that I'm not a good person I just remember that there are individuals who very specifically fear-monger people with anxiety issues for a living and feel really proud of it."

I'd have to deal. Whether I was at work or school I'd have to find some way of calming myself down. The world didn't just stop around me when my girlfriend had taken her life, and I shouldn't expect it to.   I know this is a somewhat older post, but really I wanted to put my personal experience with ""triggering"" onto your explanation. It's true."
IdiotsFightingThings,2yqm8p,ballsackcancer,4,Fri Apr 17 06:31:52 2015 UTC,I mean triggered can be used legitimately.

I can run, jump, swim, etc. but I can't work as hard as I used to because of a back injury -- I am disabled, because I am unable to work as much as I should be able to.  It doesn't make me a shitty human being or anything, it's just... a disability.  Same with missing a leg or being retarded.  It's a fucking disability, and that's okay.  Using a different word is almost worse than calling it what it is.  Like, oh God no, ""being disabled"" is awful and shameful... let's pretend it's a good thing instead!  Then we won't have to acknowledge the pain and suffering!  It's like putting fluffy poofy things on your toilet in an attempt to disguise the fact that you are a human and you shit.

Christ, I know every generation says this, but this type of shit is just so retarded, it blows me away how they are twisting everything they tell kids.   You'd think they learned their lesson with telling kids born in the 80s they could ""be anything"" and that turned out great when they came to employment age."
IdiotsFightingThings,2yqm8p,Legendtamer47,6,Thu Mar 12 20:56:16 2015 UTC,"How does adaptation even work as a substitute word? From an evolutionary perspective, disabilities often decrease the chances of survival and reproducing, the opposite of adaptation. The only way it could be considered adaptation is if the world was designed so that people with disabilities had an evolutionary advantage over non-disabled people."

They get money every month which allows them to live without having to work and without having to work they are allowed unlimited free time which raises their chances of finding a mate. Once they have found that mate if they are of the retard variety then they will either forget or just plain not use condoms which will cause them to have more children.

IdiotsFightingThings,2yqm8p,zynthalay,3,Thu Mar 12 17:47:22 2015 UTC,"From the wiki:   The sandboard base is much harder than a snowboard, and is built mostly out of formica or laminex with special base materials now being made for this sport. To glide in the sand, the board bottom is often waxed, usually with a paraffin-based sandboard wax, before a run. [...] Most terrain sandboards are composed of hardwood ply, while 'full-size' sandboards are a wood, fiber glass, and plastic composite. However, a snowboarding base will sometimes work on steeper dunes.   I doubt they'd use a metal sheet - because of that very reason (heat from sun + heat from friction). Touching the hood of a car on a summer day is enough for me."

A sport in which you find yourself some sand dunes, take a ""board"" of your choosing for sliding on, and riding it as if snowboarding. Or in this case, like a body board.  The hardest part is finding something that actually glides over the sand, rather than being bogged down and worn away."

IdiotsFightingThings,2yqm8p,triggeredbot,5,Thu Mar 12 09:25:09 2015 UTC,"Read this right quick; it comes from the Hitchhiker's Guide author, Douglas Adams:  Anything that thinks logically can be fooled by something else that thinks at least as logically as it does. The easiest way to fool a completely logical robot is to feed it with the same stimulus sequence over and over again so it gets locked in a loop. This was best demonstrated by the famous Herring Sandwich experiments conducted millennia ago at MISPWOSO (the MaxiMegalon Institute of Slowly and Painfully Working Out the Surprisingly Obvious).   A robot was programmed to believe that it liked herring sandwiches. This was actually the most difficult part of the whole experiment. Once the robot had been programmed to believe that it liked herring sandwiches, a herring sandwich was placed in front of it.  Where upon the robot thought to itself, Ah! A herring sandwich! I like herring sandwiches.  It would then bend over and scoop up the herring sandwich in its herring sandwich scoop, and then straighten up again.  Unfortunately for the robot, it was fashioned in such a way that the action of straightening up caused the herring sandwich to slip straight back off its herring sandwich scoop and fall on to the floor in front of the robot.   Whereupon the robot thought to itself, Ah! A herring sandwich...etc., and repeated the same action over and over again. The only thing that prevented the herring sandwich from getting bored with the whole damn business and crawling off in search of other ways of passing the time was that the herring sandwich, being just a bit of dead fish between a couple of slices of bread, was marginally less alert to what was going on than was the robot.""  -Mostly Harmless by Douglas Adams."

IdiotsFightingThings,2yqm8p,RangerSix,16,Thu Mar 12 12:00:41 2015 UTC,"I mean... as someone who has been on tumblr since 2009: most actual SJ people on tumblr are pretty much nothing like this. I've been involved in this part of tumblr for awhile and I have never seen anyone be overdramatic like this. Trolls always put in a shitload of those hype words like ""triggered"" and ""rapey"" and ""problematic"" and ""call out"" when people aren't really like that. Also most people who do actually get triggered by certain content are more reasonable, like politely asking people to tag certain content so their blacklist hides it. Plus I'm pretty sure almost any person who's been on any sort of social media platform in the past decade is aware of what a bot is. This person is trying to make fun of SJ bloggers who get angry when people harass them for blogging about SJ and repeatedly ask them to leave them alone but the harasser continues to message them (mainly the fault of tumblr's abysmal blocking system, which doesn't block messaging).  Basically, shit to look out for in telling if a tumblr blog is a troll blog:   lists their mental disorders in the sidebar says they're ""otherkin"", ""transracial"", ""transfat"", etc makes up weird pronouns or a ridiculous gender identity, such as someone claiming to be catkin saying ""my pronouns are meowself and my gender is demifeline DON'T MISGENDER ME CIS SCUM!!!"" has something like ""DO NOT FOLLOW IF UR CIS, STRAIGHT, WHITE, OR MALE"" in the sidebar loads a ton of hype words associated with SJ into one post, such as ""triggered"", ""rapey"", ""problematic"", and anything ""-phobic"" is incredibly reactive and overdramatic purposely tries to pick fights and start shit by going in the tags for things like men's rights and reblogging them and adding shit like ""FUCK U CIS MALE SCUM!!!!!!"" basically just generally using the phrase ""cis scum"" is a pretty big indicator lists off a bunch of really ridiculous triggers in the sidebar. I can confirm from personal experience that there are some incredibly specific triggers out there, but those are usually reasonable (ie, was assaulted in a car and now seeing that kind of car causes anxiety). But if the sidebar is like... ""PLS TAG MY TRIGGERS!! they are: rape, water, rainbows, bubble wrap, furniture, and babies"" then they're probably a troll.   Like, don't get me wrong, tumblr has its issues for sure but trolls really exaggerate shit and I'd say tumblr is a mostly reasonable place. It's like reddit.

IdiotsFightingThings,2yqm8p,polarbeargarden,44,Thu Mar 12 04:09:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's a completely legitimate word. My best friend has PTSD, and he uses that word to describe events that trigger his flashbacks."

It's kind of like how there actually are people with Celiac's disease who have trouble digesting gluten, but now whenever you hear someone say they can't handle gluten you assume they're just a pretentious douchebag."
IdiotsFightingThings,2yqm8p,robhol,11,Thu Mar 12 02:53:28 2015 UTC,"I have a friend with Crohn's who has the gluten intolerance issue (she can eat it but it makes her feel sick for a couple hours if she has more than a very small amount), and she's super excited about the gluten-free fad because it means that now there's money in making gluten-free food that doesn't taste like shit and is readily available most places."
IdiotsFightingThings,2yqm8p,Huwbacca,10,Thu Mar 12 03:25:47 2015 UTC,"Except according to my friend with Celiac, restaurants will say their food is gluten-free (because they didn't, like, put wheat in it) but won't follow any of the food cleanliness procedures required to make the food actually gluten-free. The result is that now she can't trust the words ""gluten-free"" to mean that the food won't make her violently ill =/"
IdiotsFightingThings,2yqm8p,Dralger,2,Thu Mar 12 05:17:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's probably way worse for Celiac patients. With Crohns a little bit is ok. I've heard of people having to explicitly tell their waitstaff that they actually have a legitimate condition to try and keep that from happening. With store-bought products it's usually less of an issue, and that's also an expanding market thanks to this."
IdiotsFightingThings,2yqm8p,DroppaMaPants,2,Thu Mar 12 08:05:30 2015 UTC,I think it's important to make sure we're not shitting on people who actually suffer just because we want to ensure ideological purity.

I've never even heard it in a group therapy setting.  It's also not exclusively PTSD.

When the truck rolled he came out in a sitting position with his arms like he was holding the wheel. He said he basically skipped along the ground on his butt, dragging his feet. His shoes stopped 80 feet before he did. He was pretty banged up but was able to hobble over to his friend and she died in his arms.   EDIT: He went to prison got out and took care of his kids and still works drywall. I was pretty shocked when he told me. it just went from Casual conversation about how life sucks and life experiences with my friend's dad to him breaking down and crying while telling the story. It was a profound confession and the sincerity and grief for his friend was very moving."

IdiotsFightingThings,2xp49b,Hoobleton,22,Tue Mar 3 04:43:38 2015 UTC,"Fucking right.  The only reason I am subbed here (and have been since the start) is to see idiots fighting things.  If I wanted standard youtube holdmybeer fodder I would sub to /r/holdmybeer.  I used to direct people here a lot, but I stopped a few months ago because the sub has turned into another shit clone of a generic subreddit full of karmawhoring crossposters subbing unrelated trash.  Idiots. Fighting. Things.  It isn't that bloody difficult."
IdiotsFightingThings,2xp49b,ruled_by_fear,3,Mon Mar 2 22:08:16 2015 UTC,Especially since we have multireddits now so it's easier for users to aggregate things on a theme themselves if they're so inclined.
IdiotsFightingThings,2xp49b,skintigh,3,Tue Mar 3 01:08:52 2015 UTC,"Yup, entirely agree with this sentiment. Subreddits exist for different things, and can be very specific. I think the specificity helps more than less content hurts.  One thing that does hurt though is seeing the same thing in tons of different subreddits. When a /r/HMB submission also makes it into /r/idiotsfightingthings and then into /r/woahdude and then /r/whatcouldgowrong and then /r/wikipedia (because it always ends up there, somehow), then there's 3-6 repeats on my frontpage, and that  is what makes me want to unsubscribe from places.  I think that's possibly more damaging than old reposts. Reposts are fine because not everybody has been in a place for the whole time. Reposts happening to often suck. Intentional reposts for upvotes suck more. Posting things claiming that it's yours when it isn't sucks most. Crossposted reposts are the worst.  So, yeah, be specific! Embrace your single focus and you'll be a bit more of a pure sub. ""If I go to /r/IdiotsFightingThings I can be entirely CERTAIN to see an idiot unreasonably fighting an inanimate object."" is the sort of statement you want people to be making.  Additionally, megaprops to the mods for even asking this question."
IdiotsFightingThings,2xp49b,BrotherChe,18,Tue Mar 3 05:44:23 2015 UTC,"Your poll question and your description seem to be two different things. I don't think you will get accurate results because you are going to get a lot of people voting ""yes"" where had they read further would have voted ""no.""  I am in favor of videos where idiots getting hurt while they fight things, but I'm against the examples you give like a non-idiot being hurt by a random shopping cart. Failed stunts don't sound like they fit, either, if the only reason they are ""idiots"" is because that attempt failed. (Personally, I don't think someone practicing something until they get it right to be an ""idiot."") Car wrecks don't sound like fights either.  Therefore, I guess that means I should vote ""no"" in your poll, even though I love the videos where idiots get hurt."

IdiotsFightingThings,2xp49b,roflmaoshizmp,3,Mon Mar 2 21:02:37 2015 UTC,"Right. I think the main issue here is the word ""fighting"" - if they happen to get hurt, then oh well. It's probably funnier. If they are not ""fighting"" something than it does not belong here."

If you want to still have both types of submissions, there is a button in the sidebar that links to /r/listentothis+listentothat, which essentially combines the subreddits for the user.

Someone getting hurt trying to use an everyday object, or falling over, isn't fighting, even if you try to title it something like ""Idiot fights gravity"" or ""idiot versus chair"".

I don't care about the specific circumstances and wether or not it literally constitutes 'idiots fighting things.' Restricting content is a great way to disallow funny videos that may be posted here and not seen otherwise.

IdiotsFightingThings,2xkhx1,sharknado-enoughsaid,33,Sun Mar 1 19:56:33 2015 UTC,I've just given up hope that this subreddit will ever be about idiots fighting things.
IdiotsFightingThings,2xkhx1,DBerwick,26,Sun Mar 1 20:27:37 2015 UTC,This change to the subreddit rules right here is why this subreddit will never be about people fighting things. Mods decided more content was better than less content even if it did not adhere to the name of the sub.
IdiotsFightingThings,2xkhx1,NoNeedForAName,8,Sun Mar 1 21:57:44 2015 UTC,It's also why I see the same videos posted here and on /r/whatcouldgowrong.
IdiotsFightingThings,2xkhx1,nordsmark,3,Sun Mar 1 23:18:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, these two subs are basically the same at this point content-wise."
IdiotsFightingThings,2xkhx1,TheExtremistModerate,2,Sun Mar 1 23:24:21 2015 UTC,"It came from a sort of ideological conundrum. When I made the sub, the idea would be that it was about people trying to break inanimate objects, and often getting hurt in the process. However, in the first few days of the sub, tons of submissions came in of people getting hurt by inanimate objects. There were people who figured this would be within the rules, because it's like the inanimate object is ""fighting"" the person.  So it really boiled down to there are two aspects of the sub: people trying to destroy or hurt objects, and people getting hurt by objects. Now, personally, I think the best submissions are the ones that have both of these. After all, that was the point of the sub, in the first place. If you look at the top of all time, you'll see that people generally agree with this, since the majority of them are people attacking an object and getting hurt in the process. But people were also posting things about people just destroying inanimate objects for no reason, which falls under the first category but not the second. However, people didn't seem to mind, and many of these posts got highly-upvoted. So I decided to allow them (I say I because this was within the first day or so of the sub, and I was the only mod at the time), because no one was really complaining about them, even though they only fell under half of the spirit of the sub.  Then people started making posts about people just getting hurt by things. Like, I think I remember someone just standing around and a shopping cart came out of nowhere and took them out. There were also things that kind of looked like someone fighting, but were actually just people slipping, or messing up a stunt, and ending up smacking something, like this. Some people seemed to like them, whereas others were posting in the comments about how they didn't fall under the sub. Technically they fell under the second part of the spirit of the sub, but not the first. But it seemed that people, in general, were okay with them, because they were upvoted pretty significantly. The other mods and I decided that, though the person wasn't fighting the things, it still sort of felt in-line with the sub, and most of the users seemed to agree, so we decided to keep them, but simply tag them differently.  Then things got even more abstract with people ""fighting gravity"" and ""fighting the ground."" That was just clearly not in-line with the sub's spirit, and things like that aren't allowed.  Trust me, if this were about ""more content,"" we'd just allow everything /r/holdmybeer and /r/whatcouldgowrong do in addition to what falls under the spirit of the sub. But me made decisions based on what it seemed like the users wanted. And when we tried, for a period of time near the start, to just allow fighting things, there was a huge outcry to allow people to post ""Idiots Getting Hurt"" content to the sub. So we reverted the decision and have allowed both ever since. That ""change"" in the subreddit rules has actually been there for over a year now (it was added about a month after we were founded in June 2013).  In any case, it's been a while since then, and this concern gets raised in tons of posts. So I'm going to talk to the mods about this, and see if we want to reconsider.  Thank you, however, for being concerned about the state of the sub. You may think that we don't care, but this is something about which we talked at length. As long as there are people like you who actually care about the spirit of the sub, I'm assured that it will never truly be lost."

IdiotsFightingThings,2xdaq2,BigSwedenMan,19,Fri Feb 27 19:47:25 2015 UTC,"I can tell you on sunday. There's two types of security around a team at nba games. One is off duty cops. They come in their uniforms but I don't think they're officially on the clock for the county/state (both officers are there). Then there are the suited security. They're hired by the team and some (like the Miami Heat) will have them travel with them. Next time you're watching a Heat game when they're on the road, look at the second row, right behind the team, farthest away from the coach. That angry looking white dude with the bald head? That's mike. He travels with them. He probably makes bank.  The other ones that sit backwards, I don't know how much they make. As much as a normal security guard make plus 20 grand, maybe? I'm going to a game Sunday, I'll ask.  Edit: I asked them. They make 18 an hour."

IdiotsFightingThings,2wqu76,PornStarJesus,5,Sun Feb 22 17:37:08 2015 UTC,"I once got hot lye on my hand from a drano bomb, I had to run about an eighth of a mile to get to water to wash it off.  When I started rinsing it under cool running water, it took forever for the slippery feeling to dissipate, as it had converted my epidermis into soap.  There was no long term effect, there were barely any short term effects, it was about like scrubbing too hard with abrasive lava soap.  This was red devil lye, if I recall correctly, we used both drano and lye for our dumbass experiments."
IdiotsFightingThings,2wqu76,GreenStrong,2,Sun Feb 22 18:17:01 2015 UTC,"Water flush is best to get the majority of the lye off, a mild vinegar solution flush can help fully neutralize whats left but straight vinegar and lye creates a exothermic reaction, not something you want happening on your skin."
IdiotsFightingThings,2wqu76,PornStarJesus,4,Sun Feb 22 19:50:28 2015 UTC,"Baking soda is alkaline, not anywhere near as alkaline as lye, but if you ever come into contact with lye, your best bet is a weak acid like vinegar or a ton of water for 15 minutes."
IdiotsFightingThings,2wqu76,ColaEuphoria,2,Sun Feb 22 22:14:14 2015 UTC,Aren't you not supposed to try and neutralize chemical burns because of the heat that is generated or something?
IdiotsFightingThings,2wqu76,rfmmiller,-5,Sun Feb 22 18:33:21 2015 UTC,Yeah... water would make this worse.
IdiotsFightingThings,2wqu76,Joeliosis,3,Sun Feb 22 18:46:10 2015 UTC,"Well, first off, water isn't meant to neutralize it. It's meant to dilute it. You're supposed to rinse with water for around 15 minutes if you are skin-exposed. If you just put a small amount of water on and let it sit, then of course that will make it worse, because water will cause the NaOH molecules to split into Na+ and OH- ions, which activates the lye.  The other guy was right too about vinegar creating much more heat. Use vinegar on a small amount of lye residue, not on a lye spill.  Source: I'm making soap at this very moment."

IdiotsFightingThings,2w9oxs,CanadianWildlifeDept,18,Wed Feb 18 11:59:02 2015 UTC,"Sounds like your average subreddit to be honest.    This is correct.

IdiotsFightingThings,2w9oxs,BlackBlarneyStone,39,Wed Feb 18 06:09:52 2015 UTC,SRS got mainstream press.  SRS had memebers that were reddit admins and got preferential treatment.  SRS is the only sub that openly doxxes users and gets away with it.

IdiotsFightingThings,2w9oxs,robotortoise,10,Wed Feb 18 04:23:06 2015 UTC,"Nah man, only when it hits the news.  /r/greatapes, /r/beatingwomen, /r/fatpeoplehate.....as long as it's not outright encouraging brigading(SRS implies it), they don't care 'till they get bad PR."
IdiotsFightingThings,2w9oxs,legitimategrapes,-4,Wed Feb 18 03:46:04 2015 UTC,"/r/beatingwomen is banned. /r/greatapes is pretty much non-existent, it has only 5 thousand subscribers and is mostly just a mockery.   Meanwhile, SRS confuses the shit out of people because 1/2 of the people there think it's real and justifiable outrage, the other half thinks it's a joke and troll there. Overall, SRS causes more rifts on Reddit than probably the vast majority of other controversial subs combined. SRS is just a festering shithole that feeds trolls, thus making this website more troll friendly. I guess, looking at it another way: what value does SRS provide to anyone? None. It's just purely harmful. At least the racist subreddits showcase how stupid racism is. I feel like it's about as useful as reddit advertising on 4chan."
IdiotsFightingThings,2w9oxs,robotortoise,2,Wed Feb 18 05:00:43 2015 UTC,I think it's more because of the obvious vote brigading rather than what they stand for.
IdiotsFightingThings,2w9oxs,robotortoise,11,Wed Feb 18 05:18:21 2015 UTC,Then why doesn't /r/bestof get banned?
IdiotsFightingThings,2w9oxs,robotortoise,-5,Wed Feb 18 03:23:50 2015 UTC,Because it's a positive subreddit rather than a negative one.
IdiotsFightingThings,2w9oxs,robotortoise,4,Wed Feb 18 04:01:08 2015 UTC,Except for when the guy who disagrees with the linked comment gets thousands of downvotes for having the wrong opinion.
IdiotsFightingThings,2w9oxs,david-me,-3,Wed Feb 18 05:45:45 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that you can't vote on a thread that you got to from bestof, of that makes any sense."
IdiotsFightingThings,2w9oxs,onlyonebread,6,Wed Feb 18 09:24:39 2015 UTC,"Linking from any subreddit is the same. If you post it with np or pay instead of www, it puts it in No Participation mode so your votes don't count. It's easily circumvented by deleting the np in the link, so it's mostly just a show of good faith (and/or a way to stop newbs who don't know how np works from brigading)"
IdiotsFightingThings,2w9oxs,Domslord,2,Wed Feb 18 04:16:40 2015 UTC,"That's actually not true: Reddit provides no mechanism to enforce np links. They do ban brigadiers, but it's mostly by inspection if the mods of a brigaded sub make a formal complaint to the admins."
IdiotsFightingThings,2w9oxs,Frostiken,-1,Wed Feb 18 04:56:01 2015 UTC,"Because there isn't any non brigade that fills that point of view.   If they held a point of view that was like the rest of reddit, they'd have all been shadowbanned off the site three times over"
IdiotsFightingThings,2w9oxs,canuck1701,-1,Wed Feb 18 06:24:15 2015 UTC,And yet /r/niggers was banned not only because it was offensive but also because they brigade. I am pretty sure it is safe to say /r/niggers had their own unique point of view that wasn't shared by the rest of reddit.
IdiotsFightingThings,2w9oxs,DaAvalon,13,Wed Feb 18 03:53:14 2015 UTC,"own unique view that wasn't shared by the rest of reddit   have you seen adviceanimals or read that ""non-PC fact"" thread? /s"
IdiotsFightingThings,2w9oxs,teuast,3,Wed Feb 18 03:55:32 2015 UTC,I wouldn't know. I haven't been subbed to /r/adviceanimals in my entire history on reddit. As soon as that shit became a default I instantly unsubbed.

IdiotsFightingThings,2w9oxs,someguysaid,2,Wed Feb 18 04:00:56 2015 UTC,I knew about /r/greatapes but not about /r/coons. But coons only has 3 posts since its creation.

As long as the engine is off though you would essentially just need a good cleaning. Engine and differentials drained, flushed, and refilled with oil should get things operational."

IdiotsFightingThings,2vqqac,Elturiel,0,Fri Feb 13 08:40:25 2015 UTC,"The fact that the guy was video taping and replied to the other guy's anger with ""is that all"" and a smartass grin shows he's a total asshole. We can make some pretty safe assumptions here."
IdiotsFightingThings,2vqqac,Bluntamaru,4,Fri Feb 13 13:37:42 2015 UTC,"You really can't, there could be any number of reasons for him video taping. For example, window puncher could have been road raging for awhile, following him flashing brights the works. He may have turned the camera on when he saw the road raging dude get out of his vehicle.   The ""is that all"" response seems more than appropriate given the context of the 15 second long video and the fact window puncher is acting in a belligerent childlike fashion.   All that being said, you cannot make any safe assumptions within the actual context provided. Any conclusion you do arrive at is likely riddled with bias and lacking any substance. Which is made obvious, by your unwillingness to recognize that window puncher could be the actual asshole in this situation. The fact that the question ""is that all?"" and a smile makes him an asshole in your eyes proves your bias. The reality is, no one in this thread knows what happened and jumping to any conclusion either way, based on the evidence at hand is an exercise in futility."

IdiotsFightingThings,2vqqac,MrKequc,6,Fri Feb 13 15:26:55 2015 UTC,"Sound logic, flip side of that coin. He may have responded with ""Is that all"" because the window puncher was acting like a belligerent child as most road raging sociopaths are prone to do. He may not have got mad about the broken window, because he has video of the man and likely his license plate number. So in the end all he has is a minor inconvenience until the window puncher inevitably pays for the replacement and deals with the criminal charges."

IdiotsFightingThings,2vkwuu,_northernlights_,59,Wed Feb 11 21:53:55 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're dealing with old or poorly designed pumps, yes. This is exactly why current pump designs feature easily detachable hoses (so as to not pull on the pumps themselves), and pumps which are very very secure."
IdiotsFightingThings,2vkwuu,ruled_by_fear,23,Wed Feb 11 22:22:34 2015 UTC,I work at a gas station.  People driving off with the pump still attached happens way more often then you might expect.  Fortunately it's not a big deal.  The hose is designed to rip off once a certain not very significant amount of tension is applied and the pump shuts down automatically when that happens.
IdiotsFightingThings,2vkwuu,AndrewCarnage,10,Thu Feb 12 02:24:06 2015 UTC,"In my country the pumps are more different. You can not pay until you take the pump and put it back. So unless you're stealing gas, you can't forget to put the pump back before leaving."

You can pump gas as much as you want, and then go inside and pay for it. But when you go inside, if your pump is not back in it's place, they won't allow you to pay. They will tell you to go out, put the pump back, and then come pay."

I've never seen or heard of someone actually driving off with the disconnected hose still attached to their car at my station.  At any rate we don't have back up hoses on site.  We have a technician come in and attach a new one.  We're a particularly busy station so I'd say it happens about twice a month."

IdiotsFightingThings,2vkwuu,AndrewCarnage,1 point,Thu Feb 12 11:19:13 2015 UTC,I've seen someone drive around with the disconnected hose attached to their car. It never ceases to amaze me how oblivious people can be.
IdiotsFightingThings,2vkwuu,schwachmach,1 point,Thu Feb 12 14:01:41 2015 UTC,"Well, we have a station with pump attendants so there's usually someone right there to yell at the person to stop.  Still, even if there wasn't someone to get you to stop I would think you would notice some sort of tugging on your car or something."
IdiotsFightingThings,2vkwuu,AndrewCarnage,1 point,Thu Feb 12 14:28:24 2015 UTC,"I did it once when I was in high school. Put the hose in, realized the crappy car I was driving needed transmission fluid, checked wallet, only enough for fluid. went inside and bought a quart and put it in. Got in the car and drove home listening to my cranked stereo and went immediately to bed as it was about 12 AM.   The next morning my mom woke me up knocking on my bedroom door and opening it to say ""did you get gas last night"" and holding up the handle of the gas pump hose. It had separated right where it connects to the hose."
IdiotsFightingThings,2vkwuu,changee_of_ways,-3,Thu Feb 12 14:11:50 2015 UTC,"When the pump says ""minimum $100 fine for driving away with hose"" or whatever. Is that straight to the gas station or is that a police ticket?"
IdiotsFightingThings,2vkwuu,Dontblameme1,4,Thu Feb 12 09:13:01 2015 UTC,We don't have any signs like that but I believe it costs the person who pulls the hose off about $500.  Their auto liability insurance can pay for it or they can pay out of pocket.  Some people decide to pay out of pocket to avoid higher insurance premiums.  The police would not be involved unless they tried to drive off without giving us their information.  It's not a crime until they try and drive off without paying for the damage just like getting in an accident isn't a crime until you try and drive off without exchanging information.
IdiotsFightingThings,2vkwuu,AndrewCarnage,3,Thu Feb 12 11:12:56 2015 UTC,Are you sure you're not confusing the sign you're seeing for hoses with the signs that say there is a fine for not paying?

IdiotsFightingThings,2vkwuu,_northernlights_,2,Thu Feb 12 15:29:22 2015 UTC,It happened in some country with poor safety standards for their gas pumps.  Obviously the hose is not designed to tear off and the pump is not secured to the ground as well as it should be.
IdiotsFightingThings,2vkwuu,AndrewCarnage,0,Thu Feb 12 15:55:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you drive off with hose still attached, I think you need to get head examined. I would imagine my own head and not drive for a week if that happened to me."

IdiotsFightingThings,2vinxp,teamramrod456,3,Thu Feb 12 02:10:39 2015 UTC,"Fellow Canadian here. I remember being parked at a 7-Eleven gas station last winter, just finished filling up on gas, when this lady in a large BMW sport utility pulls up to the gas station, obviously decides she didn't actually want gas, and tries to drive straight through the station. However, there was a two-foot drift of snow in front of the station; I'd already seen it and knew I'd have to back out after filling. She just drove nose-first into it, and then sat there angrily spinning the wheels, trying to brute force her way through it. The space behind her was all packed down and clear from the other cars coming and going, so she could've easily backed out.  After I watched her get mired further and further into the snow, I finally got out of my car, got the snow shovel out of my trunk, and walked up to her. I motioned to her to roll down her window so we could chat, but she shook her head ""no"", so I shrugged and got to work digging out from behind her wheels so that she could back up out of the snow, anyway. I went around and got all the tires completely clear so that it should've been a sure thing. I stepped back and waved my hands like a flight controller, telling her to back up.  She floored it, further forward into the snow.  I probably stood there for a second, blinking incredulously, before shouting over her revving, ""You have to back up!"" She obviously ignored me, or didn't hear me, because she doubled down and just kept the accelerator held for about a good twenty seconds, really getting good and stuck. When she finally finished, I went around her stupid SUV again, digging out behind the wheels. By this point, it should be been ABSOLUTELY CLEAR to her that she wasn't going to be able to drive forward through the obvious wall of snow she'd packed up in front of her, which was now standing about 3 feet tall from being compressed by her vehicle. Once more, I stepped to the side, and waved my hands as clearly as I could toward the back of her car, shouting as loud as I could, ""GO! BACKWARD!""  She promptly gunned the engine forward into the snow bank again, before stopping, glaring at me, and throwing her hands up in the air as if to say, ""What the fuck now, genius?""  And so, I folded up my shovel, put it into my trunk, turned on my shitty little old Corolla with worn tires, and backed out over the packed down snow.  Legend has it she's still stuck there."

You can go faster, turn corners sharper, and put the transmission into reverse while going forward at a higher rate of speed in a rented car than in any other kind. You can also park without looking, and can use the trunk as an ice chest. Another thing about a rented car is that it’s an all-terrain vehicle. Mud, snow, water, woods – you can take a rented car anywhere. True, you can’t always get it back – but that’s not your problem, is it? - P.J. O'Rourke"

There's a big pile of snow in front of him, an empty partly cleared out spot behind him, and not that much snow to his side. All he had to do was go back a foot so that when he turned he didn't crash into the snow pile and then proceed to the left normally.   If he was really stubborn for no good reason and needed to go straight he probably could have done that by rocking back and forth to build momentum since he does have clearance and 4 wheel drive.   Instead he guns it and balds up all his tires."

My SUV has had zero issues driving out of snow like this over the years and sits higher from the ground so snow can't pack up underneath the car which impedes your tires grip.   Of course the idiot slamming on the gas doesn't help matters at all though.    These are the situations where those 1 & 2 numbers on your manual transmission would come into play.  Drop it to 2 and then start to work your way out.  Its the same as starting your manual transmission in second gear.  Keeps your tires from spinning like mad when trying to drive out of the snow.
IdiotsFightingThings,2vinxp,PIG20,16,Wed Feb 11 16:29:31 2015 UTC,Yes. Because nowadays not many people actually go off roading or really need clearance with their SUVs and keep asking for vehicles that get better gas mileage. So the auto industries answer to this is a lower SUV that gets better mileage but less clearance.
IdiotsFightingThings,2vinxp,LonelyNixon,4,Wed Feb 11 18:01:42 2015 UTC,"I may only have to deal with the snow a handful of times during the year but when I do, it's an awesome feeling when I can just put the SUV in ""drive"" and get to where I need to go with no issue.

Much cheaper to build almost every car a manufacturer might make with the same chassis - the more you build, the cheaper it gets. Plus you only have to design the chassis once and make small adjustments from vehicle to vehicle, so that saves time and money.  The new Ford Explorers ride on the same chassis as the Ford Taurus and other Ford cars/crossovers.

IdiotsFightingThings,2vinxp,deadstump,7,Wed Feb 11 22:28:31 2015 UTC,"Traction control in these situations is often more of a hindrence that a help because sometimes you just have to spin a little and you get traction (not condoning the floor it method that this guy seems to be interested in).  I think that land rover has some traction control stuff that would help for this kind of thing, but most traction control is made more as a stability control when moving and will cut power to the wheels straightly.  That isn't what you want here.  My wife's Toyota mini van has traction control and I swear it is trying to kill me.  I try to go up a snow covered hill and at the first hint of wheel spin cuts the power... all it has to do is keep the wheels going and we would be fine, but now we have to come into the hill going really much faster than I would like just to have enough momentum to carry ourselves past the sections where the traction control gives up on us.  Well shit.  I have ranted for a while apparently.  Oops.  Tl;Dr:  Most traction control is stability control for when moving, and at best useless in these situations and at worst a hindrance."

IdiotsFightingThings,2uwl0b,DoctorSteve,6,Thu Feb 5 23:56:31 2015 UTC,Probably more safe in the cab of the machine.  They have roll bars and falling object protection.  So if something didn't come right through the roof and kill the guy there is still a chance he could survive.  Not sure about safety where this is but in Canada excavators and other heavy equipment must be operated with a seat belt.  And you are told if the machine starts to tip just ride it out.  Only time you gtfo and run is if you smell h2s gas or your machine is about to explode.

IdiotsFightingThings,2unql5,Aprox,5,Tue Feb 3 22:11:12 2015 UTC,"You wanna know why he looks that derpy? Because he doesn't control his gun at all. He flays it all over the place using his arms to gain momentum or just because he doesn't care too much.  This can easily kill someone standing anywhere to your right if you accidentially pull the trigger.  The other reason is that he does not care about cover at all but I guess that could be kind of acceptable if the guy just escaped out of your car without a weapon.

It's the same deal if you have a bad driving history, they raise your rates because you are costing them money. A perfect insurance customer to them is someone who never needs them and always pays on time.   These premiums that they charge young men are based on the fact that for the vast majority of the Automobiles lifetime young men drove like maniacs, they drove fast and reckless. Young men also tended to favor muscle cars and muscle cars + inexperienced drivers = accidents.   It is basically legal profiling to make a profit. Even if you don't fit the stereotype you still pay more."

Water rescue is expensive and takes up a shit-ton of resources.  My hometown has a similar law for river rescue. If the river is higher than a certain point it's illegal to be in without a permit. If you're in there without a permit and require rescue you're billed for it. Why? Because we told you fucking not to and you did it anyway.

Fun fact, one of the predominant causes of fatalities during flash flooding is automobile entrapment caused by people trying to drive through flooded areas. I don't know what happens between getting stuck in your car and dying, but I'm gonna guess it's not great.  Force, horse, and remorse: floss"
IdiotsFightingThings,2ubksj,hobdodgeries,1 point,Sun Feb 1 01:48:39 2015 UTC,"Basically, when your car gets stuck and begins filling with water, there may be more pressure against the door, making it harder to open. It doesn't take much water for you to find yourself trapped, and you basically have to let the pressure equalize or bust yourself out through the window to save yourself. Trying to let the pressure equalize is incredibly risky, since you need to be calm in order not to send your body into panic and use more oxygen in the process. Mythbusters did an episode where they tested whether letting the pressure in the cabin equalize is a good idea."

The police are usually pretty good at setting up roadblocks, but without fail there's at least one idiot every year that drives around the policeman yelling at them to stop, the police car with lights flashing, the police barricades, and into floodwater.   It's usually some idiot in a range-rover that's never driven off-road in their life and have no idea how to properly ford a stream, but assumes their over-priced luxury SUV will handle it for them. I can only imagine how they feel when the insurance company points out they aren't covered for intentionally driving into water, and the emergency services bill them for the time."

Why over look the obvious?  I agree you would have thought one brain cell would have asked the building manager for the key before all the banging took place but they squashed the door handle with that ram so that instantly rules out using a key.  LOL...I couldn't stop laughing to be honest.  I was waiting for whomever they were trying to catch inside to unlock the door and invite them in since the police knocked so politely.

We are also still evolving in many aspects especially social ones.  Crime rates are down and we are getting smarter. At least according to IQ.  IQ is always averaged at 100, if tomorrow the average was 105, 105 becomes 100 and everyone is adjusted down.  Over the last few decades we actually had to move IQ down to account that people are scoring higher, and successful generations are smarter then the last. That is of course; according to IQ.  As for us stopping to evolve due to no more natural selection that's pretty bunk. It is true people who would have died are now living; that doesn't mean natural selection ends that means our environment and species are changing. We adapt to our environment, and natural selection is not ""survival of the fittest"" but survival of the most adapted. In our world now we have had a shift, but nothing ends.  Hell even now that racism is at an all time low(Not saying there isn't racism) races are beginning again to mix rapidly which boosts immune system, get's rid of certain disease vectors, produces better offspring more adapted and fosters a better future.

IdiotsFightingThings,2tzcee,Fat_Head_Carl,9,Wed Jan 28 19:33:52 2015 UTC,Will that actually stop a chainsaw though?
IdiotsFightingThings,2tzcee,DonPoppito666,41,Wed Jan 28 19:36:54 2015 UTC,"The chainsaw ""chaps"" actually will have ""strings"" of fabric pull out of them that will <hopefully> clog the sprocket in the saw.  These strings will jam the sprocket, and make the clutch slip.  Will you escape all injury, probably not, but if it works correctly you'll be less hurt.  The helmet with face protection should stop a kickback...unless it hits you in the shoulder - this is where body position is essential.  When cutting, have the saw positioned so if it kicks straight up, it will be to your right-hand side.  Instead of cutting in front of you, where it would kick into your face/shoulder."
IdiotsFightingThings,2tzcee,Fat_Head_Carl,14,Wed Jan 28 19:40:12 2015 UTC,"I've seen demos where the pants stop the cutting before the can get through.  You might be bruised, but if you're wearing reg pants you shouldn't get cut.  And aside from kick back, which should actually be arrested by the brake anyway, the face mask will also keep most of the chips and what not out of your face. 10/10 look like a dork, 10/10 get to go home at the end of the day."

IdiotsFightingThings,2tzcee,nonSexyMexican,4,Thu Jan 29 03:49:31 2015 UTC,I think getting to keep a limb is generally better than having to buy a new saw.
IdiotsFightingThings,2tzcee,GeneralButts,4,Thu Jan 29 04:10:38 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, I was just curious if it destroys the saw."
IdiotsFightingThings,2tzcee,nonSexyMexican,1 point,Thu Jan 29 04:12:36 2015 UTC,I think you just take the blade section off and replace that (or perhaps just the chain). The base engine probably hasn't been damaged at all.
IdiotsFightingThings,2tzcee,Servuslol,3,Thu Jan 29 14:08:38 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess:  The chain should be OK, the sprocket should be OK as well....you'll have to take the bar off, and will be de-tangling the sprocket area, and yanking it off of the cutting teeth."

IdiotsFightingThings,2tzcee,banjospieler,8,Wed Jan 28 19:38:23 2015 UTC,"The chain will still spin for a bit even after you release throttle, unless you immediately hit the chain brake."
IdiotsFightingThings,2tzcee,frodevil,4,Wed Jan 28 21:45:03 2015 UTC,Yes but at that point it's just spinning with momentum and no torque behind it. I seriously doubt he would have lost a limb even if he did fall on the blade.
IdiotsFightingThings,2tzcee,fredbrobro,3,Wed Jan 28 21:50:42 2015 UTC,I didn't imagine the issue being him falling on the blade. It's while he's still losing his balance.
IdiotsFightingThings,2tzcee,kurtis1,3,Wed Jan 28 22:11:37 2015 UTC,The majority of injuries with a chainsaw happen after the throttle has been released. Usually taking a step immediately after making a cut. People have died and lost limbs while engine rpm has been winding down. Most chainsaws rev out to over 13k rpm. I could easily cut through a 2x4 with my chainsaw after I let go of the throttle.
IdiotsFightingThings,2tzcee,DontTouchMeUglyBob,2,Wed Jan 28 22:07:35 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see this. Any properly tuned saw, like what /u/frodevil said, will just run off momentum once the throttle is off. Every saw I've used pretty much instantly stops when the throttle is released and contacts wood."
IdiotsFightingThings,2tzcee,frodevil,3,Thu Jan 29 03:27:56 2015 UTC,"The only differences I could think of are maybe just the type of saw. The saws I used to chop down trees with my grandfather were usually medium-duty commercial saws, and the blades would get jammed in the wood if you let go of the throttle. Maybe heavy duty industrial timber saws would keep going long enough to chop through a tree, IDK"

Ijust finished building a huaqvarna 365 special that's bored out to 76cc's with some mild porting.   The point is that a chainsaw, even while the rpm are winding down could do enough damage to lose a limb."

Do you have a video of a chainsaw cutting something after the throttle has been released? I'm not doubting you, but it sounds like the guy has a good point. I can't visualize a chainsaw being able to cut a limb off with out the throttle."
IdiotsFightingThings,2tzcee,kurtis1,2,Thu Jan 29 05:38:15 2015 UTC,Your chain is way too tight.
IdiotsFightingThings,2tzcee,Katoptrizo,5,Thu Jan 29 03:33:04 2015 UTC,Obviously he should have been cutting from the bottom so that the bar wouldn't get pinched!

IdiotsFightingThings,2tkukz,euphoricpigeon,-39,Sun Jan 25 18:19:22 2015 UTC,"You can kind of determine the kid's history with his appearance and reaction.  Firstly, he's got a very unsightly way of speaking.  It's almost matter-of factly.  look at the way he moves his mouth, and his slight lisp.  He's not growing up in a family that keeps him to a higher standard.  He's also wearing mismatched socks, which isn't as solid evidence, but his parents likely don't care much about how he acts.  His haircut is also your typical 'young kid' hairdo.  His bed is unmade, a good sign his parents aren't very strict.  He's wearing a ring, that's a Kinect design gear-ring, judging by the width and thickness (I could be wrong.)  It's expensive, and I doubt this kid bought it himself.  He's spoiled.    The thing I have to keep pointing back to is his voice and the way he reacts to being struck.  He sobs after being struck.  The natural human reaction is not to immediately start crying after being hurt.  It normally takes a couple of moments.  He's a very dramatic human, and likely tries to manipulate his way around by guilting others or putting up a scene.  Also judging by the way he tosses away the band, he's probably got a bit of an ""I hate this because it's related to what happened."" complex.  A lot of gamers have this with their keyboards/controllers when they're losing in a videogame.    This kid is definitely spoiled, and gets so because of slightly more-lenient parents than normal, and because of a naturally spoiled nature.    Just an observation.  Not sure why I picked it apart.  But you know."

IdiotsFightingThings,2tef1b,DoctorSteve,8,Fri Jan 23 23:40:35 2015 UTC,I'm wondering the age of the car. New cars have shatter resistent glass that I don't think you could punch through.
IdiotsFightingThings,2tef1b,Silverlight42,9,Fri Jan 23 14:39:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think glass for cars has changed.  If you got a link where I can see the difference between the two i'd be interested.  you might be thinking of side windows vs windshield.  as far as I know the side windows are designed so that the glass shatters into small cubes, preventing large shards (plate glass) like house windows... so not to cause serious injury.... and windshields have some laminate or plastic or something that tries to hold the whole thing together.  Plus I think they're all tempered glass, making it more resistant to impacts."
IdiotsFightingThings,2tef1b,Sloppy_Twat,4,Fri Jan 23 15:16:28 2015 UTC,Just front windshields have safety glass. None of the othrr windows do.
IdiotsFightingThings,2tef1b,koenkamp,7,Fri Jan 23 15:41:57 2015 UTC,"You're confusing laminated glass with safety glass. The side windows of a car are most definitely safety glass, and have been for a very long time. Safety glass is glass that is treated in such a way that it will only shatter into small cube like pieces of glass. This is to avoid large broken fragments of extremely sharp glass from slicing the shit out of people in accidents. The front windshield is not made of safety glass, instead it is laminated so that when it is impacted, the windshield can maintain its integrity and stop objects from penetrating and hitting the driver/passengers."
IdiotsFightingThings,2tef1b,vankorgan,5,Fri Jan 23 16:06:21 2015 UTC,"You mean safety glass? While it is minimally harder to break, it's main benefit is that it fractures differently so that there are fewer sharp fragments."

IdiotsFightingThings,2tef1b,GeneralDisorder,1 point,Sat Jan 24 02:50:40 2015 UTC,"My buddy threw a large pipe wrench at the rear window of a 1972 Buick Electra (demo derby car) to demonstrate that shipping windows via UPS shouldn't be a problem. Yes, the windows did sell and I got positive feedback for the sale on eBay so I have to assume they made it."
IdiotsFightingThings,2tef1b,DoctorSteve,1 point,Fri Jan 23 19:14:39 2015 UTC,So the pipe wrench didn't break the glass but this guy's fist does?  I just have seen a lot of blunt objects hit glass and bounce off. That's what makes me suspicious of the ease he has breaking it. Maybe they've been tapped with a glass breaker first?
IdiotsFightingThings,2tef1b,GeneralDisorder,9,Fri Jan 23 19:16:58 2015 UTC,"It's about technique more than anything. Have you seen the news report with the guy trying to shatter a side window of a car with a hammer and failing miserably many times over?   He was just flailing the hammer.  If you put some thought and effort into it and aim for a point beyond where the impact happens you're still pushing (and hard) when the fist or hammer makes contact.   It's pretty feasible since this dude is clearly a trained martial artist. You see trained people breaking concrete, cinder block, thick boards, brick, etc with their bare hands. Glass is similar in this sense. If you push hard enough, in the right place, with enough force, the glass should break.   One time I had some concrete steps I had to get rid of (they were crumbling and also weren't high enough when we dug out 10 tons of dirt from our back yard to make a parking space). The guy in the backhoe tried to break the steps and couldn't crack it. He put the bucket down so hard it lifted the wheel off the ground. I cracked it with an 8 pound sledgehammer in one swing. I really doubt I generated much more force but the fact that I could better pinpoint it probably made all the difference."

IdiotsFightingThings,2t9rr4,nope_nic_tesla,8,Thu Jan 22 15:25:40 2015 UTC,Yeah he slapped it with his left hand. May have been a ring or something that caused it to shatter.... definitely did not seem that hard.
IdiotsFightingThings,2t9rr4,TheResPublica,7,Thu Jan 22 15:31:01 2015 UTC,"probably a carbide ring. its tempered glass, i literally threw a sledge hammer at a peice leaning up next to a dumpster and it bounced off a good 8 feet. if you tap a corner it will shatter though."
IdiotsFightingThings,2t9rr4,LocalOnThe8s,3,Thu Jan 22 17:35:20 2015 UTC,+1 on that. If you ever tried to smash a side window of a car you know how strong and durable they are and yet if you have something of a hard material with sharp edges like ceramic shards from a spark plug you can break them effortlessly.

EDIT: Nice to see the ignorance of the Reddit hive mind is in full force. Maliciously downvoting all of my posts doesn't negate any of my points."
IdiotsFightingThings,2s1mc8,sheepdog_alpha,41,Sun Jan 11 14:58:02 2015 UTC,"I doubt he was doing that to improve his aim, I'd guess he was having fun."
IdiotsFightingThings,2s1mc8,notaneggspert,20,Sun Jan 11 15:20:00 2015 UTC,It sure looks like fun. Besides the part where the tree fell on him I mean.
IdiotsFightingThings,2s1mc8,sheepdog_alpha,12,Sun Jan 11 12:29:14 2015 UTC,Edit: Oh no muh intermet points :'(   You fucking pussy
IdiotsFightingThings,2s1mc8,notaneggspert,-9,Sun Jan 11 12:38:00 2015 UTC,"By ""doesn't negate my points,"" I mean the points I'm making in my posts, not the Karma points. I don't give a fuck about the karma. It's just frustrating to have everyone blindly downvoting without telling me why they think I'm wrong, and also upvoting shit like the guy claiming the rifle looks like an AR-15, when the rifle isn't even visible. Ignorance is always irritating.   EDIT: And if I were a pussy, I'd have deleted all these posts. I'm leaving them up because I make no apologies for telling the truth, no matter how much you don't like it. Your attempt at negative feedback will not stop me. Deal with it."
IdiotsFightingThings,2s1mc8,RadialSkid,-10,Sun Jan 11 15:20:39 2015 UTC,"Try like 25 yards. This video looks fake anyway (he appears to be in front of a green screen or something), but close-range target practice is standard, and very effective, especially for civilian self-defense training.  edit - glad to see this isn't fake - gif makes it look funky."
IdiotsFightingThings,2s1mc8,sheepdog_alpha,13,Mon Jan 12 00:04:45 2015 UTC,It's not fake?
IdiotsFightingThings,2s1mc8,RadialSkid,1 point,Mon Jan 12 01:25:16 2015 UTC,Thank you for the source! This is awesome.
IdiotsFightingThings,2s1mc8,RabidMonkeyOnCrack,1 point,Sun Jan 11 14:23:32 2015 UTC,I don't think that that's the actually source there's a couple others on YouTube that all seem to be reposts.  It might have started out on another site before it was posted on YouTube or the original might have been deleted.
IdiotsFightingThings,2s1mc8,Masaharta,-23,Sun Jan 11 14:57:51 2015 UTC,"Close range pistol training with fast draws, sure. Unloading a long gun at a paper target from that close? Having had more than a little training myself, I don't see the point.  And there's no way that's 25 yards."
IdiotsFightingThings,2s1mc8,RadialSkid,13,Sun Jan 11 15:39:21 2015 UTC,There's no way that's not at least 20 yards. any target practice is practice. How could there not be a point?
IdiotsFightingThings,2s1mc8,RabidMonkeyOnCrack,-14,Sun Jan 11 21:28:47 2015 UTC,"20 yards is the equivalent of four mid-sized sedans parked bumper to bumper. He's a good deal closer than that.  EDIT: Seriously, are you guys blind? Let me put it another way - this motorhome is 30 feet long: http://www.rvcountry.com/images/new_rv_pics/classA_gas.jpg  That would be the equivalent of two of those, parked lengthwise between the shooter and the tree. Look at the .gif again and seriously tell me there's that kind of space."
IdiotsFightingThings,2s1mc8,RadialSkid,1 point,Sun Jan 11 14:56:38 2015 UTC,"Look at the height of the tree as it falls and the distance he covered by taking 4 steps. An average person's stride is about 2.5-3 feet. He moved about 10-12 feet. If you think he's not at least 20 yards away, you're delusional."
IdiotsFightingThings,2s1mc8,gsav55,1 point,Sun Jan 11 15:22:40 2015 UTC,"Hey, /u/RadialSkid is totally right! You CAN fit two RVs between the shooter and the tree. See this mock-up I did in Paint?"
IdiotsFightingThings,2s1mc8,RadialSkid,0,Sun Jan 11 15:46:50 2015 UTC,"So you think you could fit two of those RVs, bumper to bumper, in that space? Seriously?   And the shooter is not ""striding,"" he's edging forward about a foot at a time. Note that the camera doesn't follow behind him, and the distance between his elbow and the middle of his butt is the only additional part of him that enters the frame....he did not cover a great amount of distance."
IdiotsFightingThings,2s1mc8,gsav55,1 point,Mon Jan 12 20:08:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, two of those RVs can fit in that space. 25 yards, 75 feet isn't that long of a distance. People seriously underestimate distance.  He was shooting at the tree probably 6-8 feet off the ground and judging based on the tree falling down on him, if you watch the video and pause at 0:08 you c see it's at least a 50 foot tall tree. Also the camera does move with him, he has a camera man. Watch the ground, if the camera didn't move, the ground wouldn't either."
IdiotsFightingThings,2s1mc8,Animeisgoodforyou,0,Mon Jan 12 20:36:16 2015 UTC,"Admittedly, the camera does pan up slightly. However, I don't believe the shooter covers more than about six feet walking forward.   Also, let's say the target is about eight feet up on the tree. That's roughly the same amount of distance from the base of the tree to the nearer side of the darker patch of ground in front of it. I estimate there are maybe three similar lengths over the leafy ground to the shooter's final position....so 32 feet, give or take."
IdiotsFightingThings,2s1mc8,gsav55,8,Mon Jan 12 20:21:33 2015 UTC,You don't see a point in learning how to keep an assault rifle on target while maintaining fire?
IdiotsFightingThings,2s1mc8,RadialSkid,-6,Mon Jan 12 20:38:30 2015 UTC,Assault rifle? How did you make that determination? I'm not seeing full automatic or burst fire.
IdiotsFightingThings,2s1mc8,Datduckdo,3,Mon Jan 12 20:47:19 2015 UTC,Okay whatever man assault styled semi automatic rifle.  It looks like an AR-15 and regardless my point still stands so you picking apart semantics doesn't really change what I've said.  That if you're going to fire a semi automatic weapon it's important to be able to stay on target for follow up shots and to practice executing said follow up shots.
IdiotsFightingThings,2s1mc8,gsav55,5,Sun Jan 11 15:52:27 2015 UTC,"All you can see is at most 2 inches of the muzzle. There is no way to know which firearm it is or how it looks. This could easily be anything. Also ""assault style"" Stop drinking the punch."
IdiotsFightingThings,2s1mc8,RadialSkid,0,Sun Jan 11 15:53:33 2015 UTC,"What punch are you talking about?  You can't even see that muzzle, what you do see is the back side of the black synthetic stock on the butt of a semi automatic rifle. And like I said you're just arguing semantics.  Even if it's a revolver it's still a popular drill and it's important to be able to keep your weapon on target for accurate follow up shots."
IdiotsFightingThings,2s1mc8,Datduckdo,-7,Sun Jan 11 16:05:55 2015 UTC,"Given that the rifle is barely even visible, I'm not even sure how you can say it looks like an Ar-15. It could just as easily be a Mini 14.  Personally I like to time my shots so that barrel climb isn't an issue, but if you like shooting as fast as the weapon will allow, practicing to minimize it is good idea. I'm not sure why it's imperative the shooter be this close for that, though."
IdiotsFightingThings,2s1mc8,Animeisgoodforyou,-1,Mon Jan 12 01:04:35 2015 UTC,Maybe /u/gsav55 has actually shot a gun unlike you

IdiotsFightingThings,2rprch,spongemonster,8,Thu Jan 8 19:47:53 2015 UTC,It's not.
IdiotsFightingThings,2rprch,Shaggy_One,17,Thu Jan 8 20:21:43 2015 UTC,Only because they forgot to put their fingers in their ears first.
IdiotsFightingThings,2rprch,blerko,12,Thu Jan 8 21:08:35 2015 UTC,"Well, now I don't know.  The IED didn't go off in the video, so maybe the rock was effective after all."

IdiotsFightingThings,2rprch,discountedeggs,41,Thu Jan 8 17:08:40 2015 UTC,Did he point his gun at the camera man at the end? What happened after it cuts off
IdiotsFightingThings,2rprch,teddy5,64,Thu Jan 8 06:50:21 2015 UTC,Nothing happens. I think they saw someone aiming something at them and he raised his gun as a response but lowers it when he sees it's a camera.  It's typically not a good idea to point things at soldiers in a war zone.

One production company made a Bladesports knife for a few years (with an MSRP of $500 with a street price of $350) although they've discontinued it.

IdiotsFightingThings,2qdycb,Sack_to_the_Future,1 point,Fri Dec 26 18:50:55 2014 UTC,"Here in the UK, you certainly have to do a fair bit of searching before finding some more traditional schools. I generally look around and try to figure out the average age of a black belt holder, any younger than 18-25 and I'll often dismiss the club a fair bit, and if there are Dan 2+ grades younger than 30 then I won't be revisiting.   Its hard, and im lucky to have had a father that really knows his stuff with martial arts to point me in the right direction. I don't know where I'd start without him."

You don't hit with enough force, so all the energy that should have gone into breaking the board instead goes into breaking your wrist and busting your knuckles.  That being said, palm strikes are the intelligent choice for breaking boards."

IdiotsFightingThings,2pzcms,tubameister,2,Mon Dec 22 01:31:20 2014 UTC,"Revolving doors are such bullshit, especially with the problems they introduce. What's the purpose? It takes you a minimum of five seconds longer to get into and out of a building, even longer if there are people in a line, and most of the time there are regular doors right next to it anyway."
IdiotsFightingThings,2pzcms,ColaEuphoria,15,Mon Dec 22 05:54:00 2014 UTC,I think it's more a matter of climate control.  Less air moves back and forth than if you have someone holding a door open.  That's always been my assumption.

This is necessary in buildings with large volumes connected to the entrance to counteract the negative internal pressure generated by the Stack Effect, which can be strong enough to actually prevent you opening/closing doors."
IdiotsFightingThings,2pzcms,rain_wizard,2,Thu Dec 25 23:18:38 2014 UTC,Every large building also has normal doors that open (usually right next to the revolving ones) I've never had any trouble opening these doors.

IdiotsFightingThings,2pzcms,rain_wizard,0,Mon Dec 22 00:34:14 2014 UTC,So does having a normal door open into a tiny room before opening into the building.
IdiotsFightingThings,2pzcms,ColaEuphoria,3,Mon Dec 22 00:47:37 2014 UTC,"That's referred to as a vestibule or drafy-lobby. The issue with that is that a constant stream of people renders it next to useless because they hold both doors open simultaneously, so it doesn't work as well for very busy buildings like malls/shopping centres. The revolving door is always sealed."

IdiotsFightingThings,2plcj5,BamesF,7,Wed Dec 17 17:31:04 2014 UTC,Why shouldn't they be making money? They're making videos some people find entertaining that other people won't do.

The same way that jackass inspired these people, these people being successful will in turn inspire another generation of kids into doing stupid shit for money & fame. I don't normally wish for people to die, but I think that's what has to happen to one of these guys. He needs to die, his friends need to get all sad and make a PSA about it, and if we're lucky, they'll remove all of their old videos before some 13 year old decides to copy them."
IdiotsFightingThings,2plcj5,BamesF,0,Wed Dec 17 21:27:35 2014 UTC,"First of all, doing challenges that test your pain threshold =/= stupidity, I've never understood where that assumption started. People have been doing things like this forever because it's IMPRESSIVE. Not everyone has the mental fortitude to walk across hot coals, or karate chop a cactus. I certainly don't.   Second, what the hell is wrong with you?"
IdiotsFightingThings,2plcj5,BarfingBear,2,Thu Dec 18 01:05:31 2014 UTC,"Testing your pain threshold, OK.  But what's impressive about this?  It's not testing a pain threshold; it's trying to accomplish something (whatever the fuck the payoff may be) and failing because pain.  Common sense would say: of course it's going to hurt and most likely you're not going to be able to chop it in half, so what's the point?  Confirmed what everyone knows.  That's why it fits in this sub: idiots fighting things."
IdiotsFightingThings,2plcj5,BamesF,1 point,Thu Dec 18 01:23:01 2014 UTC,"We're talking about these guys in general. I suppose in this particular instance, the idea that they could possibly make it through the cactus could be considered stupid, but that's not why people are watching the videos. They're watching because these guys hurt themselves fairly badly, it induces a wince from the audience, and it therefore entertaining to some people.  Also yeah it deserves to be here in general, no one's debating that. We're just discussing if A. These guys are stupid for doing it and B. Whether or not they deserve money and Internet fame for it."

There is nothing impressive about what they're doing. Anyone can put themselves through a lot of pain, it doesn't require any special skill.  The fact that you would hurt yourself for youtube money is honestly very sad. You know who else makes money for putting themselves through pain? The homeless people in those bumfights videos. Do you really want to aspire to be that?  I don't karate chop (or dive into) cactuses because I'm not a moron."
IdiotsFightingThings,2plcj5,BamesF,1 point,Thu Dec 18 01:42:39 2014 UTC,"The example you're comparing this to is out of desperation and is entirely different, with a level of cruelty in it too. These guys obviously find the pain worth the money/rush/fame they get. Everyone has a price too. Clearly the amount they're getting is too low for you, but for them either the pain isn't too bad or what they're getting more than makes up for it. I'm still failing to see how you're viewing this as stupidity, I'm lost.  And obviously some people do find it impressive, hence their following."

I've also never heard someone call someone else stupid for doing something harmless (to others) that they enjoy besides insecure teenagers and old ladies.  You're not going to be able to convince me that you're anything but mad, unable to understand what other people enjoy, and unable to form any sort of argument, so you might as well drop it.

IdiotsFightingThings,2phsyz,deprivedchild,7,Wed Dec 17 07:47:23 2014 UTC,"I'm the she, he's the he, but that's neither here nor there.  My fiance swore the tranny was slipping.  I said it was not.  He said it was.  I said it was not.  Not wanting a big fight I said ""do whatever you want"" and he sold it to his ex boss/ our ex landlord four years ago.  Suby is still running like a champ.  It was a 2004.  He bought a 2007 Jeep as her replacement with a higher monthly payment and higher insurance, and we've had to put new tires on it TWICE in 4 years, at $900 each time, had the alternator go, the sway bar (I think), just quite a few thousand dollars in repairs over the last 4 years.  The Suby never did anything wrong, and the ex landlord said nothing has faltered since she bought it from us.  Oh well, too late now..."
IdiotsFightingThings,2phsyz,workaholic_alcoholic,2,Wed Dec 17 07:59:03 2014 UTC,"Derp! Sorry, I read fiancee somehow, oops.  As for the tires, there's just so many different things that could cause that, from diffs locking up to wrong alignment, etc. Though, honestly, the general consensus while working on other cars is that imports tend to be built differently and without fluff, though I'm limited to a lot of 90s vehicles. Or maybe we just keep working on bad automobiles--My old ass Honda surprisingly keeps track pretty well, but my moms' Expedition has always needed something; too much to list.  Should you want a Subie again, they're not asking too much on the used market anyways! If anything, the older models have a ton of parts available so you can easily get some other ones since a lot of models used similar transmissions, engines, even suspension parts. Shame that the Subie didn't just get inspected instead, I'd wager it would have been a lot cheaper."
IdiotsFightingThings,2phsyz,deprivedchild,2,Wed Dec 17 08:12:40 2014 UTC,"We've been saving up to get a second vehicle for years, but it seems as soon as we get two grand saved up for a down payment the JEEP has a major malfunction and there goes the money.  This has happened three times.  I hate that fucking Jeep.  So I'm left STILL walking to work every day, in sometimes three or four feet of snow.  The road path is plowed but would take me almost two hours to get there.  The straight path through the state park takes me 25 minutes.  If I had a car to drive it would take 8 minutes.  This Jeep has just made it financially impossible for us to get a second vehicle, and my fiance works an hour drive away from home so I'm stuck walking through snow drifts up to my chest.  Shit sucks."
IdiotsFightingThings,2phsyz,workaholic_alcoholic,1 point,Wed Dec 17 08:23:25 2014 UTC,"I don't blame you in the slightest. Parents have an 2000 Expedition that should have been sold years ago, due to numerous issues, but dads' keeping it like it's a treasure.  Front left hub chewed through at least four wheel bearings. Alignment has been needed at least 3 times, replaced tires twice due to one side having terrible alignment. Coolant leak in Cylinder #6 (or 7, can't remember), having us have to replace the damned thing I can't remember that goes before the spark plugs (not the injector, it was something else, and they were hella expensive at $60 a piece. A cousin of mine had the exact same problem as well, same year and model) due to the coolant leaking, and the fuel pump going out, water AND A/C pump, etc. small stuff included that cost us a pretty penny. The engine of that damned thing is currently sitting in our garage so we can finally fix the stupid coolant leak problem forever and all, but it's taking so long to repair. I don't think a year has gone by without the damn thing having something up with it. Shit is getting expensive.  Owned my car for three years now. Simple as balls to repair, never had a catastrophic issue and it's 21 years old, and has at least 300k miles on it. The expedition? Fucking thing failed before the 100k mile mark.

IdiotsFightingThings,2phsyz,calisto77,2,Wed Dec 17 02:09:07 2014 UTC,Bingo.
IdiotsFightingThings,2phsyz,TheyDeserveIt,-8,Wed Dec 17 16:19:19 2014 UTC,"You're not entirely wrong, having tread makes a huge difference, but AWD, at least in my experience, is excellent and will compensate for lack of tread a lot more than you may think.  I was running on virtually no tread (I kept putting off putting $900 of rubber into my car until the first snow, then I wanted to give the tire shops a chance to calm down after the first snow rush) and with no tread on all-season touring tires, I still seemed to have much better traction and control than any of the FWD or RWD vehicles I saw on the roads, and from my own experience, much better than my FWD Civic with good studded tires and proper tread.  There were only two places where the lack of tread was really noticeable, which is that stopping distance was increased significantly on polished ice, although it was still better than most vehicles I saw, and then for about a week we had thick ice which had melted where everyone drove, leaving deep ruts which you had to cross out of to change lanes.  On a few occasions my front tires would make it over but my back tires would slip back down, leaving me at a terrible angle across two lanes, which could have caused an accident had I been going too fast or over-corrected.    My point is that AWD is amazing, and while the handling of your RWD Volvo might be great with snow tires on (I know my Civic was night and day with regular tires vs. studded snow tires, and I know my brother's Blizzaks are super soft and sticky in the snow), just imagine how well a car with decent AWD would handle having the same snow tires.  However, having driven with all of these, I would still gladly take AWD and worn all-season tires (although now I have new tires but they're still all-seasons) over FWD/RWD and snow tires.  You don't have to store a spare set of tires or worry about having them switched out twice a year, you don't have to worry about whether it's not going to snow or be slick enough to warrant using your softer snow tires and therefore having them wear faster on the dry pavement.    The guy in the video is an idiot, obviously, aside from never just backing onto cleared pavement, he just kept gunning it and trying the same thing he had already tried for 5 minutes.  He also clearly either didn't have traction control, or had it disabled because no traction control should let you sit and burn your tires up like that.  If he'd even just backed up a little bit and given it steady gas instead of rage-flooring it like that, he probably would have gotten out.  I don't think you can use this as an example of AWD being pointless without snow tires.  More like any vehicle being pointless if you don't know how to drive it."

IdiotsFightingThings,2phsyz,TheyDeserveIt,-2,Wed Dec 17 01:43:26 2014 UTC,"...And I live in Idaho.  I'm totally familiar with shitty winter conditions AND driving in the hills/mountains during those shitty winter conditions.  I drive up a 4-6% grade (my estimate, and I'm not sure where I can verify that) twice a day every workday.  Staying out of a ditch is a lot lower priority than staying out of a river, and having driven both a FWD car with and without snow tires and an AWD with all-seasons, the AWD with all seasons handles way better than the FWD with studded snow tires.    I have no problems stopping, and as I said in my other reply, I never had to drive below the speed limit even when I had very worn all-seasons with the ice-ruts on the road.  The only issue I had at all, which was my back tires slipping back down the ice ruts when I changed lanes, was due to the tires being very worn.  That happened at 30mph and it was still very easy to correct quickly and without going into a spin.  I never had that issue even at ~25% tread last winter, or the previous winter at whatever the tread percentage was then, and now that I'm back on new all-seasons, it handles great.    I'm not AGAINST snow tires, they made a HUGE difference on my FWD car, and of course they'd give me even better traction in my AWD car, but my point is that it's not necessary in my AWD car because it already handles very well in winter conditions.  Because it handles better than my FWD with snow tires even when my AWD has all-seasons, if I had to choose one or the other, I would choose AWD any day.  Slippage hasn't been an issue in accelerating, stopping, or turning."
IdiotsFightingThings,2phsyz,kstorm88,2,Wed Dec 17 13:22:23 2014 UTC,"So you're saying you can stop just as well and take a corner at speed just as fast with an awd with all seasons, than a fwd with snow tires? I sure hope not. There's also a video on tire rack where they compare an awd all season vs fwd snow. They are at a ski hill and the fwd out performs the awd like night and day."
IdiotsFightingThings,2phsyz,Velocity211,2,Wed Dec 17 16:02:20 2014 UTC,"Said video, though they use summer tires in this test. Here's the tire rack video where they test all-seasons vs. winters. People don't understand how much a difference the right tires make. I plow through up to 3"" snow like nobody's business in my RWD E36 BMW w/LSD using dunlop winter sport tires.  But the main point is coming to a stop, regardless of drivetrain, winter tires will grab into the snow itself and allow the car to come to a predictable stop, unlike all-seasons even with ABS."
IdiotsFightingThings,2phsyz,Firehawkws7,3,Wed Dec 17 16:33:43 2014 UTC,Lol. AWD is nothing without traction.
IdiotsFightingThings,2phsyz,TheyDeserveIt,-3,Wed Dec 17 04:55:55 2014 UTC,"WITHOUT traction of fucking course it's not going to be much help, but that's a useless statement, we're not talking about putting racing slicks on it and putting a 55-gallon drum of ass-lube on a tarp on the ground, while you hoist the car up so the tires barely make contact with the surface, we're talking about optimal and sub-optimal traction.  More specifically, /u/sp00nix was talking about the difference between all-seasons and snow tires, suggesting that AWD with all-seasons isn't still far better than RWD with snow tires.  I mentioned the virtually bald tires that I recently had only to demonstrate that even without much of any tread, an AWD car handles surprisingly well, so if you have traction on those all-seasons, an AWD car will handle very well and snow tires become unnecessary unless perhaps you're trying to drive up a VERY steep hill on polished ice, but I drive up what I'm guessing is probably a 4-6% grade twice a day.  You have traction with virtually no tread, it's just not optimal.  As I detailed pretty extensively above, because I just had that exact experience, I still had no serious issues in 12"" of snow or on polished ice, and never had to drive below the speed limit.    So even with 25% tread left on all-seasons, which is roughly where I was at last winter, my AWD handles much better than my FWD with studded snow tires, at something like 80% tread life, did.  And, judging by everyone else on the road, much better than any of the FWD/RWD cars I saw.    Then again, that all counts for naught if you're still assuming I'm making the claim that AWD is magical and helps without traction."

Make sure your tires are properly inflated. Carry a phone charger, Keep the gas as full as you can. Keep warm cloths and a blanket as well as some non perishable food (granola bars, trail mix and so on) and water somewhere accessible (no good if you're stuck for a day and it's in your trunk). If you do get stuck out on the road with snow above your tailpipe(like Buffalo stuck which probably  won't happen) manually clear your tailpipe of snow if you're going to run your car, even with it clear,  try not to run your car unless absolutely needed, If your cold wear mittens that you've smartly packed in your bag,  and wrap yourself in a blanket.   Driving  Leave space. If you think you have enough space, leave more and it's  snowing  bad, leave even more.   Don't slam on the gas if you're stuck. Apply it smoothly with the wheels as straight as you can  get them. If you're really stuck, floor mats under the front of the wheels are a great emergency traction  aid.   Carry a small shovel.   Changing lanes on the highway in the winter, you have to navigate the build up between lanes(they suck) , maintain your speed, don't brake or accelerate , insure the lane is clear, signal, slowly start to change lanes, gradually drifting over top, you will get resistance from the snow build up, maintain the same pressure on  your steering wheel,  don't jerk the wheel, don't apply the brake while changing lanes unless it's an absolute emergency.   Slow down before the turn, your tires can't handle turning, and braking in the snow, if you try to stop while turning you will just slide. Same goes if you're trying to emergency brake (going straight, car skids in front of you,  ect.), don't panic,  apply a steady firm press on the brake (don't stab it) look at the place you want to go,  not the obstruction(target fixation) , release the brake and steer into the gap. Locked brakes don't let you steer in snow (even with abs kicking in).   Turn Into a skid.   Find an empty snowy parking  lot figure out where buried medians are (oops) and figure out how your vehicle will start,  stop,  slide in snow. Pull your ebrake while driving in the lot, while turning, while straight, see how it slides,  and try to recover it.   Don't panic, don't panic, don't panic.

I'm on mobile so I don't want to post a big long link, but just google Asian carp taste test to see some examples.   As for fishing for carp, common carp are usually used as fertilizer here.

Which, considering why that plankton problem exists in the first place will keep the carp growing.  Mass fishing them and then using them as fertilizer seems actually a pretty decent way to not introduce more artificial nitrogen into the water supply.  So the best thing we could do is stagnate the carp without further damaging the local wildlife, and to create an artificial fertilizer cycle.

You tag one with a transmitter so you can find it at a later date. During the winter months common carp congregate together in large schools, and commercial fisherman can come in with nets and remove large numbers of carp (about 26,000 fish on a Minneapolis lake last year as an example).   The same process could work with Asian carp as well, but since their numbers are still limited in my area no one will willingly release a fish into the ecosystem unless it is sterilized. The U here is currently working on research to determine the most effective method of sterilization."

Which in turn decimates the entire food chain. They can eat twice their weight in phytoplankton a day so the smaller fish can't even compete. The smaller fish (bait fish) die off and then it effects the lager predatory fish (bass, pike, walleye, perch ect..). These  Asian carp are on the brink of making it into the Great Lakes via Chicago and once they get in, the prediction is that the diverse, plentiful fish populations of the Great Lakes will also become decimated. (A billion dollar a year industry for the Great Lakes states).

You have the Young Earth Creationists, the faith healers, others who claim to have spoken with God or spoken in tongues, those who look at natural phenomenon and claim God is responsible, etc etc. It is pointless to look at one example and say ""They are not demonstrative of all religious people."" Of course they aren't, but when you combine each fringe claim into a larger pool it starts to become a bit impressive.  Also, keep in mind I never said that the majority of religious followers experience delusion regarding their faith, that is probably untrue. However, with billions of religious people there is a HIGH NUMBER of people who experience delusion even if the PERCENTAGE of people is still relatively low."
IdiotsFightingThings,2p7a3w,LordGrey,15,Sun Dec 14 04:06:04 2014 UTC,"But it really doesn't.

However, with billions of religious people there is a HIGH NUMBER of people who experience delusion even if the PERCENTAGE of people is still relatively low.

IdiotsFightingThings,2p7a3w,chiliedogg,0,Sun Dec 14 04:53:08 2014 UTC,"The majority determines the norm, and you cannot classify a group off of fringe.   I didn't say that it determines the norm, I'm saying that the high number causes a problem since even though the percentage is relatively low, the occurrences are still frequent. Take your murder example as an example of this. Murderers are a very small percentage of our population yet we all still take steps to keep ourselves safe from potential murderers even though chances are we won't be murdered. The minority doesn't define the norm, but it does affect our society.   But it really doesn't. All these people are insanely small majorities, and when you combine them into a larger pool they still are only a droplet in the ocean.   Does it? Well let's keep looking at our delusions then. If the YECs are deluded about the age of the earth, then many more Christians are deluded about their beliefs on evolution. That raises the percentage greatly. Let's look at politicians (Many of which have rather a frightening amount of support) who claim that God told them to run for office. The fact that voters aren't running from these people show that people are generally okay with this delusion even if they aren't experiencing it themselves.  Let's look at all the mutually exclusive religions. Even if a single one of them happens to be right, all of the followers of all other faiths (And even other branches of the same faith in some cases) must be deluded in their beliefs. This is more of a vanilla style of delusion but it still is delusion. So if the largest religious denomination happens to be correct about their beliefs of the universe (let's say that this is Catholic at 33% for the sake of ease), then that still leaves 67% of the entire worlds population who are incredibly incorrect. Since they've got the information about the true religion but refuse to accept what is true as fact, they are deluding themselves that Catholicism is not the true faith.  The faith healers and other such are only the extreme outliers of an over-all delusion of faith. Keep in mind, delusion does not equal mental illness (although it can), so this is not what I am talking about when I speak of delusion."

You're kinda changing your point here.   If the YECs are deluded about the age of the earth, then many more Christians are deluded about their beliefs on evolution.   That really has nothing to do with the original idea you were conveying. We were talking about beliefs in Protestantism as the way it pertained to OPs post. ""Vanilla style"" delusion is a belief, and as much as you disagree with it, it isn't harming anyone. Now extremist protestantism and televangelism is, they're scamming people of their money (especially this guy in the post above, he's a scummy fucking con artist) and that's definitely a delusion because there is a solid way to prove it to people, but they really will not listen.   Your new points aren't really relevant to what you were originally talking about.

They're tricking him because he's a bit of a douchey leader.   And it's a comedy film where he gets separated from his entourage of followers/tormenters and he realises he has no powers and it becomes a heart-warming tale of a man who had experienced being a god learning to trust others, instead of hadouken-ing all of his problems away. He learns the value of friendship and when he finally gets home, he's a better leader, and we are all a bit better for having seen the film."

They said that they were desperately sad that they weren't speaking in tongues or writhing around like the others, that it seemed god was rewarding others but not them and they so wanted to be rewarded as well. So they used to fake it just to fit in, so as to not show the others that god was not really with them and so they could fit in with everyone else who was feeling the touch of god..   It was only years later that they realised everyone else much have pretty much been doing the same thing as well."

If you were to try that shit with a real pane then it would; 1. Stop you in your tracks possibly knocking you unconscious and 2. Send huge shards of sharp pointy things raining down on your head.   Edit: just like how if you were to try to eat real glass like in the video then you better have an ambulance waiting to send you to the E.R.

IdiotsFightingThings,2o9a58,kuavi,3,Fri Dec 5 03:15:14 2014 UTC,I'm willing to bet this isn't the first time.  She's probably called the cops and by the time they finally arrived the kids were gone.  Whenever you see videos like this it's when the property owner has been pushed to the limit by little shits.
IdiotsFightingThings,2o9a58,realy,9,Fri Dec 5 11:30:01 2014 UTC,You call the cops and the kids leave only to come back whenever they feel like.
IdiotsFightingThings,2o9a58,HalfysReddit,3,Fri Dec 5 13:10:52 2014 UTC,Seriously. Where do you people live that the cops show up within 10 minutes on a non-emergency call?  Kids skateboarding? It would take them at least an hour or two around here to show up for that.   She is just protecting her property because cops aren't coming out for this.
IdiotsFightingThings,2o9a58,howstupid,1 point,Fri Dec 5 02:46:24 2014 UTC,I'm not even sure the cops would bother to show up around here for that. Then again skateboarding was never big around here. People used to skate in this one abandoned satellite dish but that's about it.
IdiotsFightingThings,2o9a58,slip_up,6,Fri Dec 5 13:05:29 2014 UTC,Well you really don't know how many times she has asked them to leave. This may not be their first visit nor did we get any context until she was already yelling. This may have been the 50th time these assholes had been trespassing.

IdiotsFightingThings,2o9a58,jego,2,Fri Dec 5 06:34:37 2014 UTC,That's a good way to put it. I did feel bad after she toppled over at the end. You could definitely see how uncomfortable she was with them.

IdiotsFightingThings,2o9a58,Krelkal,105,Thu Dec 4 21:20:26 2014 UTC,"Probably because she was lying about being the manager.  She started with ""I live here"" and then turned into the manager later.  Probably has no actual power."

Still seems suspicious that she didn't start with ""I'm the manager and I fucking told you to leave already"" after having called the police.  The fact that she the tried to steal their property, as if that would be ok in any situation, seems like further evidence of her feelings of powerlessness, which wouldn't have existed if she had any real authority."
IdiotsFightingThings,2o9a58,critically_damped,9,Fri Dec 5 16:11:37 2014 UTC,I did work at a building like that. The property manager was doing work all day long. The tenants would call him at all hours of the night and he would start at 6 in the morning.
IdiotsFightingThings,2o9a58,charlie145,3,Fri Dec 5 10:55:39 2014 UTC,There is a difference between being on call and working 24 hours a day.  One of these things is literally impossible.

IdiotsFightingThings,2o9a58,critically_damped,5,Fri Dec 5 03:34:58 2014 UTC,"Yeah, you can count all the mistakes she made.  First, escalating a conflict when there are three young men equipped with boards, and she is an old barefoot lady. Like, doesn't matter how right you are, if they were hooligans you'd be in pretty big trouble.   Second, not taking a way out of the conflict offered. ""give us the board and we leave "". Even if they're lying you will not be worse off. What are you even going to do with it?  Third, chasing them? You will hold one hostage?   Just...lady, you did not have a winning strategy there."

My guess is that she had been there asking/telling them not to skateboard on the property for a short amount of time before the recording starts and they ignored her so she took matters into her own hands.  I'd probably handle it the same way, though I wouldn't care if someone was skateboarding as long as they weren't damaging anything."

But ultimately, companies and tax payers end  up paying for repairing sex-wax covered rails, concrete protrusions, etc.  Better idea; garner local support for a skate park.  We also don't know how many times these particular guys pissed her off; maybe she's been watching this for weeks?  Still not a great way to work with them on the issue, but you can't ignore the potential damage.  Some kids start rail grinding on my front porch, I'd probably attack them too :)."

As an equally old, but apparently slightly more fun dude I'd like to encourage you in your skate park creation project.  However, you make it sound as simple as phoning the mayor and asking for it (BTW - taxpayers pay a lot more for a skate park than to fix up the odd rail or curb).  I'm not aware of all this skateboard damage of which you speak so I googled it and it didn't seem particularly heinous or widespread.  Most of the images are of anti-skateboarding fixtures.  I'd like to propose that people be willing to put up with some things in order to tolerate the way other people choose to live, so that we may in turn have our trespasses forgiven (as the old saying goes)."
IdiotsFightingThings,2o9a58,badbrownie,0,Fri Dec 5 10:56:35 2014 UTC,"Actually really surprised by the comments here. She was actually way more reasonable than many of these videos usually turn out. She didn't really raise her voice until they were encroaching in and blocking her passage. for the most part was relatively calm and logical. Sure, taking their property was was out of line, but so was their trespassing. It sounds like from the video they are repeat offenders and she's told them before.   Appropriate title: ""Kids destroy private property, get caught, harass property caretaker and complain when she does something about it.""   Liability is a bitch, property damage is a bitch, her? not so much."
IdiotsFightingThings,2o9a58,MikeLinPA,25,Fri Dec 5 06:23:39 2014 UTC,"Sure, taking their property was was out of line   you seemed to de-emphasize that to the point where it was barely noticeable."
IdiotsFightingThings,2o9a58,badbrownie,-6,Thu Dec 4 21:15:49 2014 UTC,"She wasn't 'stealing' it. She was detaining them until the police arrived the only way she could, (a citizen's arrest.) She told them they would get it back when the police arrived. Obviously, she couldn't back it up, which is why a citizen's arrest is not recommended. It is also why you don't see a lot of little old lady cops."
IdiotsFightingThings,2o9a58,MikeLinPA,7,Thu Dec 4 22:58:16 2014 UTC,A citizen's arrest feels a bit extreme for skateboarding.
IdiotsFightingThings,2o9a58,Solobear,4,Thu Dec 4 22:27:23 2014 UTC,"Agreed, but so does refusing to leave private property when asked.  Ironically, her solution to a person refusing to leave was to not let them leave. You cannot tell criminals, or obnoxious brats with skateboards, to wait for the police to arrive. It just isn't going to work. The whole thing blew way out of proportion fast, and she couldn't back it up. If she could have backed it up, she would be ""Bad-Ass Granny"", not ""The old bitch that hates skateboarders"".  Sometimes you have to use mental Jujitsu. I have had school kids fighting in front of my house. I wanted them to leave, so I told them to stay right there until the police arrived. They said, ""Fuck you, we're leaving,"" which is all I wanted the little assholes to do in the first place! Fuck those kids, they ain't smart."

I don't see any destroyed property in the video. Mind pointing it out? I'll save you some time - there isn't any. Don't see how asking for their own property back that she stole from them so they can leave is considered harassment. And yes, having your property stolen is a reason to be upset. Getting them to leave and calling the cops was her doing something. Stealing their property was over the line. She also flips off the camera, curses at them, and tries to chase them down. If anyone was harassing someone it was the lady. Compared to her the kids were quite reasonable and level headed, she acted like a stubborn psychotic nut."

So, 5% of the time you are an asshole to someone on their own property?    The video begins with the woman standing off at a distance (appears to be > 20 ft).  0:01 - Woman: Do not skateboard here.  0:10 - Woman begins walking around the walkway.  0:12 - You hear the kid drop his board down and begins skating toward the camera. This is obviously in defiance to the request, and antagonistic.  Now consider these fucking douchebags were recording the whole thing, they knew what they were doing and were intentionally antagonizing.     Being an asshole doesnt help any situation.   You're right, these kids were on someone else's private property. They were asked not to skateboard. They antagonized the property owner, and generally behaved like assholes."

That's a very childish attitude. If you're trespassing on someone's property, making noise, and potentially causing damage, you expect them to be civil with you? Next time someone is giving you attitude because you used their property as your own personal skate park without permission, how about you act like a decent human being, pick up your board, apologize sincerely, and leave peacefully."

IdiotsFightingThings,2o9a58,critically_damped,0,Fri Dec 5 03:39:00 2014 UTC,"The problem is it's always kids that don't own property or have a legitimate understanding of the ramifications of what they're doing.  They don't understand that they might cause an establishment lost sales due to noise and the fact that some little old ladies are scared of skateboarders, they don't get that all of the damage that is done to railings and whatnot has to be paid for, they don't see that their mere presence has an effect on the general public's perception of that area.  Either they're ignorant to all that, or they just don't care. Either way the answer if this is a common problem in a certain area is to build a skate park. Yea I know, little shits, deserve to be in the system, blah blah blah. But think of it this way - skateboarding, like any other sport, reduces violent crime and drug use (despite the stoner skateboarder stereotype, and in any case at least it's not painkillers). It keeps people active and healthy. And opting for the skate park instead of tougher policing keeps people as productive members of society instead of putting them into the system that only makes people's lives even worse."

On one side, I feel they would have left and apologized if they were given their board. However, the fact the lady mentions asking them  before sort of makes skate boarders seem like real assholes. After some thought, I have to side with the lady. Her anger is justified, and her actions were at a low degree. The skateboarders at one point surround her. Their intentions seem to be non-threatening, but they were somewhat intimidating. She probably got scared/nervous and lashed out as a defense mechanism. Also, the skateboarders created a potential for an accident. For example, they could run into a car and damage it, or run into a person (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDUDFxZSn6k). Finally, there is the risk of a lawsuit for the lady. Couldn't the kids sue the lady if they get hurt on her property?   She could have easily handled it better. One would be to ask one more time for them to stop, and video tape the conversation. If they refuse, she could call the cops and have evidence to back her claim. If they did decide to cooperate, they probably wouldn't show up again, and the lady gets what she wants."

IdiotsFightingThings,2o6ify,FlyingChainsaw,5,Thu Dec 4 09:16:56 2014 UTC,"I was going to try it, but I realised I'm not exactly sure how to go about doing it. Also, 6,000 lbs is a mass, not a weight. I'm guessing the pine wood breaks at 6000 lbf.  I'd say the guy is probably about 200 lbs (he looks fairly muscly). Converting pounds to kg because I have no idea how to do physics using pounds. 200lbs = 90 kg, 6000lbf = 2720 kg...f (Ok I really don't know how pounds-of-force works...)  F = ma 2720 = 90a  a = 30  So I guess the guy has to be decelerating at 30 ms-2 to break the wood. Looking at the gif, it looks like he spends almost half a second in contact with the wood, but then flips and quite a lot of his energy actually goes into rotating him/flipping him downwards and also through the beam itself - the guys holding it are pushed backwards.  I'm gonna really approximately guess that the guy still had about 1/3 of his KE when he hit the ground, 1/3 was absorbed by the people holding the beam, and only the final 1/3 was actually absorbed by the beam itself.  a = 1/3 * v/t 30 = 1/3 * v/0.5  90 = 2v  v = 45  So according to my (frankly shoddy) attempt at doing the math, I'd say the guy would've had to travel at 45 m/s or just over 100mph to break the pine beam.  Although, probably the real answer would be a hell of a lot more than that: The guys holding the beam probably have a combined mass of less than 400 lbs, and the beam itself probably only weighs maybe 10lbs or so, so instead of treating it as ""guy running into a solid wall"" it's actually a guy pushing against a 400lb mass.  (Also even then it'd probably need to be a bit faster, since the guy isn't just one single point pressing on the beam - his force is probably spread fairly evenly along the beam across the width of his chest...)"

IdiotsFightingThings,2o6ify,JimmyLegs50,2,Thu Dec 4 14:49:17 2014 UTC,"Yeah... although possibly if the guy was going at some insane speed, the plank would snap before the supporters even had a chance to move... like, if I threw a ball at a stick held up by paper supports, the supports would obviously give way before the stick did, but if I fired a bullet at the stick, then the stick would probably break, possibly without the paper supports moving.  I'm not sure whether that would be because the collision is so instantaneous that the supports wouldn't need to absorb any of the acceleration, or because the mass of the stick itself would provide enough inertia/resistance to break itself around the bullet..."

IdiotsFightingThings,2o6ify,pdrock7,3,Thu Dec 4 04:48:18 2014 UTC,I do remember from martial arts that they would bake the boards used for this kind of trick in an oven to remove the moisture.  This had the effect of making the board easier and safer to break.

Typically in these types of shows, the guy will bring out a normal board and stand on it, hit it with a sledge hammer, etc to increase the suspense and expectation.   One of two things usually happens at this point...   The performer will take the 'beat up' board, toss it aside, and call ""for a new one that has not been weakened"".  The person will give a little spiel to the audience, maybe even call for audience participation, while the crew ""sets up the stunt"". During that transition, the second board is introduced.   Of course, the second board is cut against-the-grain and kiln dried to remove all moisture...    My guess is that that they flummoxed the board change somehow OR dude saw a similar show and decided it was a grand idea."

As an example: a young, impressionable youth goes and sees a show like this and says to themselves: Being a Christian=Physical Strength (They may even see the allegory, but I sure didn't at the time). Many of these men had substance abuse problems (steroids, etc), failed marriages, money problems... The list goes on and on. That is not to say that being christian demands perfection; this would be a logical fallacy in and of itself. This is to say, if you are trying to be a role-model, have your house in order.

IdiotsFightingThings,2nt5l4,Skoop_yep,29,Sun Nov 30 20:05:18 2014 UTC,"It's not physical violence. I would never hurt another human being just because I fell off my board, or for any reason really, I agree that is incredibly idiotic.   That being said, everybody gets angry, and feelings of anger tend to flow more from hobbies you enjoy. It's natural to be upset because you fell and injured yourself, and snapping a board that's already broken anyway feels good and released the tension. It's very, very common in the skateboarding world. This guy just got really unlucky, I've never seen anything like that happen before."
IdiotsFightingThings,2nt5l4,redw04,25,Sun Nov 30 07:11:09 2014 UTC,"Hey man, it's a sport. Tennis players throw their rackets, hockey players snap their sticks, skateboarders snap their boards. Adrenaline is very high with skateboarding as it is with any other sport, and temper rises much faster than in normal, everyday situations. One thing doesn't necessarily always lead to another. I'm not saying you have any bad or irrational points, minus the slippery slope argument at the end, I'm just saying it's an incredibly common thing that isn't that big a deal.    I'm an incredibly nice person, I rarely get angry, but back when I used to skateboard I would jump on those things like they just threatened my family. Between the boards that gave out and the boards that I snapped, I'd go through about 10 a year, which is on the low side.  Edit: I saw you deleted your comment, you didn't have to do that! I can be right without you being necessarily wrong, we were just having a conversation"

Some random (actually as below; he lied to get up there) kid gets on stage, thinking he's top shit.  A lot of wrestlers, especially the hardcore fucks, will cause intentional wounds to the forehead for the blood-on-face look.  Well this kid gets dropped and a cray wrestler guy jumps on him and literally cuts into his forehead.  He goes too deep and he severs the big forehead vein/artery.  Kid is screaming in pain and pains as he's bleeding out on the wrestling area.  Eventually an ambulance is called but you can really see and hear the true terror in the kid.  Edit: it's called blading.  ""Another such incident was during an ECW house show when a young wrestler known as Mass Transit forged documents and lied to ECW Owner/Promoter Paul Heyman about his age and amount of training. He then asked his opponent, New Jack, to blade him. Jack cut through two arteries in Mass Transit's head when he bladed the young man, and fifty stitches were required to close the wound. A wrestler allowing someone else to blade him is extremely rare."" (Wikipedia)"

When I use to go to shows once a week I watched as the popularity of them grow and grow. I was always into moshing. Even moshpits are kind of ridiculous. As I got older and my musical taste matured more, I started standing further and further back at concerts. I have not gone to a concert in a couple years now.    Probably went to 300+ concerts between 2002-2010. It was a fun time for concerts in the Bay Area. I would guess that it is always a good time for converts in the bay area though..."

IdiotsFightingThings,2mf3yd,Armagetiton,44,Sun Nov 16 05:59:44 2014 UTC,A sober reminder that cops do a tough job.
IdiotsFightingThings,2mf3yd,upsidedownbackwards,28,Sun Nov 16 15:07:32 2014 UTC,"This is the one thing I give police the most respect for, dealing with PCP addicts without doing grievous harm to the addict.  You know how strong a startled fully grown man with down syndrome can be? They're walking juggernauts fueled on ridiculous amounts of adrenaline. What really throws you off is how much stronger they are then they look. Now imagine that man has been bloodlusted, and you have an enraged PCP addict on a bender."
IdiotsFightingThings,2mf3yd,JulesWinnfeild123,7,Sun Nov 16 00:51:01 2014 UTC,PCP isn't really that bad. Every time I've had it I've happily laid on the floor of my living room and just enjoyed life.  PCP is bad for people who are already on the edge of losing their shit though. That's what happens to these people.
IdiotsFightingThings,2mf3yd,alcoslushies,4,Sun Nov 16 01:24:38 2014 UTC,"No actually the problem with pcp is people dosing HUGE doses of pcp because they don't know what they are doing and they just dip a cigarette in it, then promptly have a psychotic break. If everyone that did pcp just took a reasonable dose, shit like this wouldn't happen. Period.  Also PCP or it's analogs are extremely friggin rare on the street. Nobody does it. It's a classic example of the media blowing shit up. ""Wow those cops really have a tough job they gotta deal with pcp addicts like on a daily bases."" That's bullshit, I don't doubt they deal with people experiencing schizophrenic episodes possibly caused by other drugs, but not pcp. PCP is almost exclusively found on the darknet, the problem lies not with the substance, but the unreliable methods of dosing people use because they are uneducated.   Same goes for bath salts to, media way overhyped that shit. Ain't nobody do methedrone, it's a bad drug. Remember the guy that ate someone's face? He wasn't even on any research chemicals(in this case 'bathsalts') he was on fucking WEED. He was psychotic because he had serious mental health problems and smoked weed, yet the media does they're bullshit."
IdiotsFightingThings,2mf3yd,Deadzone_,9,Sun Nov 16 05:15:18 2014 UTC,You mean to say people can enjoy drugs if they exercise self control?   Because reddit doesn't understand this.
IdiotsFightingThings,2mf3yd,upsidedownbackwards,23,Wed Nov 19 04:53:54 2014 UTC,"To be fair, some (if not all) drugs impair your judgement making it difficult to exercise self control."
IdiotsFightingThings,2mf3yd,alcoslushies,2,Sun Nov 16 06:34:32 2014 UTC,"Gotta say, doing PCP does impair self control. Personally though it gives me floor-lock.

IdiotsFightingThings,2mf3yd,Deadzone_,-2,Sun Nov 16 06:45:49 2014 UTC,Then you shouldn't be doing those drugs :)
IdiotsFightingThings,2mf3yd,alcoslushies,3,Sun Nov 16 14:05:24 2014 UTC,I blaze and drink... Both of those can impair judgement.

It just looks that way because they have very little impulse control or self-preservation - or pain response for PCP folks. Many of us are strong enough to punch through that fence - but the knowledge of what that will do to our hands keeps us from doing it, or even trying. Even learning to punch through plywood involves a lot of mental conditioning.   Not so with downs/pcp dudes - and the latter won't even feel the results for a while."

IdiotsFightingThings,2mf3yd,spankaway,4,Sun Nov 16 17:03:43 2014 UTC,"we'd see more of them in the Olympics.   Saying they're stronger than they look doesn't necessarily equate to Olympic strength.

There are no shortage of talented athletes with downs syndrome and other disabilities - but virtually no scientists.   I linked a weight lifter with Downs - and power lifting actually does require a lot of proper technique. The guy is pretty good.   Here an article about an MMA guy with Downs - and that's a sport that's extremely technique and tactics based.   http://www.disabilityscoop.com/2014/06/20/athlete-sues-right-compete/19459/  The areas of the brain that are most useful in sports aren't always as affected as those required for language and abstract thinking."

Yes he was naked as the day he was born, covered in his own blood and having a mental break from preexisting mental health issues mixed with drugs and alcohol. The cops were afraid to touch him because he busted his nose open and then smeared blood all over himself to make himself a slippery and disgusting mess of sweat, spit and blood. I think he may have also shit and pissed and rubbed that all over himself too.   If I remember the outcome right he did 18 months in a mental facility and is banned from drugs or alcohol for life(probation piss tests weekly or biweekly at random).   I guess the good thing was he got help instead of shot but this was COPS of the early - mid 90s not today's cops."

IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,underthedock,37,Sat Nov 15 00:16:09 2014 UTC,Saw a girl burn her throat at a club once.  We found out that weeks later she was still in hospital recovering.  Flaming shots are for idiots.
IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,The_Paul_Alves,77,Sat Nov 15 09:13:06 2014 UTC,Pretty sure you're supposed to blow them out before you actually take the shot...but what do I know I only drink alcohol that's not lit on fire.
IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,Always_,20,Sat Nov 15 11:09:08 2014 UTC,"Drunkenly 2 christmases ago my nan was telling me that when she was in her 20's her and her mates would all do flaming shots, and she told me a guy who was trying to impress one of them came over, and in her words ""like a fool didn't put the fucking thing out!"" laughed for a bit said ""James, you never heard me swear"" then laughed some more.  Apparently they used to use the palm of their hands to put the flame out, smother it."

IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,ClintHammer,5,Sat Nov 15 14:58:58 2014 UTC,Straws work too. That's how the bars where I used to live would do them. Then you can still enjoy watching them burn while you drink.
IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,reverendjay,19,Sat Nov 15 14:53:31 2014 UTC,So warm alcohol + molten plastic?
IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,anthony81212,5,Sat Nov 15 15:00:51 2014 UTC,metal straws are a thing
IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,eraserhill,7,Sat Nov 15 17:10:03 2014 UTC,So warm alcohol + a rapidly-heating up straw from the flame?  Unless I guess the straw is something like aluminum. that would be pretty neat!
IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,anthony81212,1 point,Sat Nov 15 19:08:53 2014 UTC,Never had a problem with that. But ideally even if it did start to melt then the melted part would be in the cup and not on you.
IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,reverendjay,8,Sat Nov 15 15:11:11 2014 UTC,"Heating up or melting plastic can release a bunch of volatile organic compounds that you don't want to breathe in though, even if it's a little amount from one straw"

IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,Locopop23,-3,Fri Nov 14 23:00:00 2014 UTC,Now I'm not an professor on alcohol but wouldn't beer also be flammable?
IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,nuke_dukem,45,Sat Nov 15 01:02:47 2014 UTC,"No. The alcohol content has to be much higher to be flammable. Bacardi 151, is just over 75% alcohol, and is flammable. Beer can be ~3% to 9% and is not."
IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,tedzeppelin93,11,Sat Nov 15 01:09:06 2014 UTC,57.14% alcohol by volume (100 proof outside of US) is the threshold.
IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,mithrandirbooga,15,Sat Nov 15 02:52:41 2014 UTC,"In fact that's where the term ""proof"" came from. Sailors in the English Navy were paid in Rum at times, but some unscrupulous captains would water it down in order to ""pay"" them less.   Sailors devised a system to ""prove"" that the Rum was genuine and not watered down. If it was able to combust, then they had their ""proof"".  Later on this scale was adopted for all alcohol, and 100 was set at the combustion level of Rum."
IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,CaptOblivious,3,Sat Nov 15 13:22:35 2014 UTC,Now THAT is useful information.  Although the US proof would be 114.28 for 57.14%
IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,Deleriant,2,Sat Nov 15 09:18:15 2014 UTC,No way. You can set fire to Galliano Sambuca and it's only ~40%.
IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,herpderpdoo,7,Sat Nov 15 05:09:37 2014 UTC,"sambuca is also full of sugar, that might have something to do with it"
IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,yoda133113,3,Sat Nov 15 05:53:15 2014 UTC,"Which is why Sambuca makes for great flaming shots, because it carmelizes that sugar and it tastes great!"
IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,made_me_laugh,1 point,Sat Nov 15 15:19:26 2014 UTC,"But rum is fermented from pure sugarcane, wouldn't it have the same effect if that were the case?"
IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,herpderpdoo,2,Sat Nov 22 21:16:47 2014 UTC,"Sambuca has unfermented sugar added after the fact in high concentrations, which is the culprit"
IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,BSnod,1 point,Sun Nov 23 04:59:04 2014 UTC,"Even 80 proof, or 40%, is flammable if heated.  Source: Bartender for 8 years"

IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,julavi,1 point,Sat Nov 15 15:03:09 2014 UTC,I though 50% was 100 proof?
IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,tedzeppelin93,1 point,Thu Dec 18 15:37:20 2014 UTC,In the US proof just means double the percentage.
IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,Socky_McPuppet,3,Thu Dec 18 19:07:47 2014 UTC,"No, there's not enough alcohol in beer for it to be flammable."
IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,Wiffernubbin,3,Sat Nov 15 01:08:26 2014 UTC,then here's a followup: would the beer actually dowse the flames?
IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,Jodah,8,Sat Nov 15 06:02:39 2014 UTC,Yes. Even strong beer would put out a flame like that. People joke that American beer is water but in truth all beer is more water than anything else.

IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,JamesBearded,120,Fri Nov 14 20:33:36 2014 UTC,My favorite part is how the guy in tank tops didn't throw his cigarette. He kept smoking it while putting the fire out of the other guy's face with a towel.
IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,Ajajane,68,Fri Nov 14 20:47:28 2014 UTC,I personally appreciated the guy who decided the carpet was more important to put out then his buddy's face.

IdiotsFightingThings,2mbb0e,ReservoirBaws,46,Fri Nov 14 20:39:51 2014 UTC,Yea I thought it was common knowledge that you blow the flame out before you drink the shot?

My truck stops maybe a few feet to her left and I can't see her daughter. I can't see her legs because the hood is impairing the view.   She looks at me like I am in the wrong. I was the one causing the problem. Whatever happen to look before you cross? I was on a one way street. I had the right of way. I was going the speed limit. Wtf was going through her head!? I could understand if she wanted to injure herself but when she grabbed her daughters hand. That...that stuck with me. Why? Why would she place her daughter in danger?!   I don't know.....

Once I get off the residential street, the speed goes up to 60 mph (95 km/h). If I take the tollway, it's 85 mph (135 km/h).

IdiotsFightingThings,2m7t0v,WentoX,2,Fri Nov 14 16:50:39 2014 UTC,I live in the Netherlands. The maximum speed on the highway varies between 130 km/h and 80 km/h (highways through cities)  Max speed in cities is 50 km/h once you enter city bounds and are not on a motorway/highway.  Max speed is generally 30 km/h in suburban zones.  Max speed of 15 km/h is normal on 'woonerven' which apparently translates to acreage.  This is very normal for the Netherlands.

But your country is tiny and many people walk, use bicycles, or public transportation. I wonder what the difference would be once you normalize the data per mile driven (or per hour in the car)? I'm sure you are still a lower death rate, but probably not by a factor of 5.  Edit: I tried to look it up but couldn't find the data for the Netherlands. In the US, there are 1.1 deaths per 100 million miles driven.  Edit2: Wikipedia to the rescue!  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate  The Netherlands traffic fatality rate is 4.9 / billion vehicle-km and the US is 7.6 / billion vehicle-km. So the US has about a 1.5 times higher death rate when you take the distance traveled into account.  The lowest country with data in that chart is Norway at 3.3 deaths per billion vehicle-km which is about 1.5 times less than the Netherlands rate.

The black SUV passes and you and you decide to make a run for it across the sidewalk. Then out of the corner of your eye you see the white hatchback coming at you and then FUCK FUCK WHACK wwooooaaahh smack hunnghhgh ouuch.  I guess the angle does somewhat fit where if she wasn't paying attention, the black SUV does block her view of the car that hit her. It also does look like she tries to turn away/slow down but she was already sprinting full speed so couldn't quite stop herself in time.   I'm not saying it wasn't her fault, but it does kinda look like it could have been an accident because she wasn't paying attention to traffic."

Do not reddit at work, and when you do, do not bitch about how you got in trouble. It is nobody's fault but your own."

Lots of people browse reddit at work, and if you're browsing a sub that's not explicitly a NSFW sub, and someone posts untagged NSFW content, then people should complain.

IdiotsFightingThings,2m7gy7,Gonzobot,-23,Fri Nov 14 01:55:13 2014 UTC,It's also an asshat move to bitch about NSFW content on a site that is entirely user generated content.

IdiotsFightingThings,2m7gy7,bamgrinus,9,Fri Nov 14 02:14:21 2014 UTC,"I don't know what it being user-generated content has to do with anything.  Reddit gives its users tools to create their own communities with their own rules, and regulate them as they see fit.  Expecting people to abide by those rules and generally not be a complete fucking asshole about things is not an unreasonable standard to hold people to.  The continued existence of people who do shitty things does not mean we lose the right to point out their shittiness and expect moderators to take action.  That's the whole point of moderation in subs.  And if moderators don't do a good job of removing things, or if a sub is just filled with a particularly large number of assholes who don't care, then the grown-ups will leave the sub and leave behind a sub filled with assholes."

That's what we're talking about here. We're talking about people going to a sub on reddit to see punks fighting street signs and losing (hopefully). My boss and my work are fine with goofy shit like that.  You are telling us that we should just accept child porn on reddit because users generate it?
IdiotsFightingThings,2m7gy7,Gonzobot,-2,Fri Nov 14 04:30:22 2014 UTC,"Not what I'm saying, so don't put words like that in my mouth. Instead, try reading what I actually said. If you're at work, don't go on reddit if you might get in trouble for doing so.  Don't complain when you do get in trouble. You don't see people hanging out on redtube to participate in comments and then getting in trouble for the porn they weren't looking at, because that's stupid as hell - same thing with reddit.

I don't know why it happened or how it happens. But I am 100% on board with making sure we get safe sites only. I never want to be exposed to that again.   Edit: I did report it.

IdiotsFightingThings,2m7gy7,AdamsHarv,21,Thu Nov 13 21:29:32 2014 UTC,Yes there is!  If you feel like finding it I know the FBI has a program for reporting it; unfortunately the link is nowhere near as easy as it used to be to find.   But here are two more foundations which are very active (teams of people online 24/7) who work to take down child pornography. Not only do they take it down but they report it to the authorities too!  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children: http://www.missingkids.com/CyberTipline Direct Link to tip form  I've heard lots of good things about NCMEC in the past. In fact if you visit the US Department of Justice webpage their protocol for reporting child pornography is NCMEC. http://www.justice.gov/criminal/ceos/report/report.html#reportcp  The Internet Watch Foundation (UK): https://www.iwf.org.uk Direct Link to tip form  I've heard very little about this group and much of it mixed. They have a broad scope (which recently has been shrunk) but their reputation for dealing with online predators is very good.  What if I don't live in the USA or UK though?! Here is a handy tool that will put you in touch with an agency/organization that deals with child pornography in your own country.
IdiotsFightingThings,2m7gy7,zman0900,4,Fri Nov 14 01:19:09 2014 UTC,"Even if you don't live in the US, might as well report it there.  History shows that the US will probably still deal with it, even if it's a foreign site."

Not only on Reddit but to the relevant authorities. I have gathered a few different links to submit reports of child pornography. I have listed below the links for users in the USA and the UK along with another link so that users can find who to report it to in their own country.  Please do not simply back out of the link and clear your browser history (spoiler alert: it isn't difficult to show you visited the site). Take the time to report it, for many of the forms it takes less then 5 minutes to fill out and you can help protect innocent children from being exploited.  People that knowingly spread child pornography, which users sometimes stumble upon as an honest mistake, deserve to be brought to justice.   The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (USA): http://www.missingkids.com/CyberTipline   The Internet Watch Foundation (UK): https://www.iwf.org.uk   Here is a handy tool that will put you in touch with an agency/organization that deals with child pornography in your own country."

If I click on one of the links and it takes me to a child porn site inadvertently without me requesting it, I report this to one of those sites up above, will I get in trouble for reporting it? It may sound a little paranoid but if one of those sites show, having little faith in the law enforcement in this country, they are just as likely to bang me up for visiting the site than they are about actually doing anything about the site being hosted?  Terrible though it sounds I am not sure I would want to draw any attention to the fact that I've seen that kind of website no matter that it is unintentional.

IdiotsFightingThings,2m2s7l,dedokta,67,Thu Nov 13 10:51:12 2014 UTC,I had an idea for a short story where aliens visit us that are totally peaceful and actually have no concept of war or death because their physiology makes it impossible for them to die. They've never heard of violence or war before and just want to explore. The fact that they can't be killed freaks us out since they'd be unstoppable in a war. The government starts secret research to find a way to kill them just in case. Scientists do figure out a method for killing the aliens and explain it to the creatures to let them know that we aren't to be trifled with. The aliens take this information back to their home world and immediately start wiping each other out over petty differences that never seemed to matter to them before they knew they could kill each other.

Imagine if FTL travel was just waiting on some dude making an accidental discovery that just made the rest of us slap our heads and yell ""Of course, fuck, why didn't I think of that?""  As for your other claim..."
IdiotsFightingThings,2m2s7l,trutommo,2,Thu Nov 13 01:43:25 2014 UTC,"Notice even in your example it includes a stove, which is another invention. Discovering useful wheels is easier if stove tech is already prevalent. Hoping someone stumbles upon some kind of ""easy"" solution is just wishful thinking. Even to just make the ship you will need countless advances to keep the occupants alive. Even if you stumble upon some kind of amazing rocket fuel or propulsion system that is still fairly useless (for space travel specifically) without all of the other components.   Note I'm only claiming it's extremely likely race that has mastered space travel will be more advanced in nearly all of their tech.  Also fozzie probably bought that car he'd never hurt anybody."
IdiotsFightingThings,2m2s7l,NyranK,1 point,Thu Nov 13 02:23:53 2014 UTC,"Well to use a possible real world example, one of the leading theories for FTL travel is the Alcubierre drive.  To boil things down to simplicity, one of the big problems with the proposal was the amount of mass energy the equations required. When first proposed, it was something like 'the mass-energy equivalent of the entire universe and them some' to travel across the galaxy. That's a problem. Later on, they refined the idea with some creative insight so it'd work with only the mass of several stars the size of our sun. Still bad, but much better. The most recent variation has it being a possibility using only 700kgs or less and that change came about, largely, by deciding to change the shape of the required warp field. Simple(ish) idea changed the whole theory from 'crazy' to 'we're gonna start small scale experiments now'.  Of course, you've still got the 'how do I stop everyone from melting due to radiation' issue and many others, but it's often the case that a series of 'simple' ideas builds upon themselves until the problem is solved and many of our great scientific advances were pretty dumb questions or realization. Isaac Newton and his apple as an example."
IdiotsFightingThings,2m2s7l,KillAllTheZombies,2,Thu Nov 13 03:26:19 2014 UTC,"For example, Cortes reached South America not just with ships but guns as well. There are no reasons to think that technological innovation would occur in one area so significantly that they could travel the stars while another area made so little progress that they would be threatened by missiles. We have every reason to assume it would be like shooting an arquebus at a tank.  Admittedly, we know nothing about alien technology. You can be totally right and I really hope you are, should we be visited and fuck up the encounter in some way or another. Or if they're just plain mean. But we have no reasons so far to think that the technological innovations of other species would follow entirely different rules than ours has. If there is even a semblance of commonality in development, then we can and should expect them to be roughly as much more powerful in force as they are in travel."

Stanislaw Lem wrote a great book, ""Fiasco,"" which is based on the Fermi Paradox (as well as a lot of game theory).  It's about a hypothetical point in the future where we actually discover intelligent life and we have advanced to the point where we can travel and make contact (they have not yet advanced to that stage, but they're sufficiently advanced for us to recognize them as sentient).  The humans have to figure out whether, and how, to make contact with a species that we barely recognize as alive, much less sentient.

You can probably tell if a world is a suitable candidate for life from very far away - we are getting there already. However it's not clear whether anybody would have come close enough to hear our radio transmissions.  The theory I think is that eukaryotes were very unlikely to occur - without those you can have lots of life on a world, but only ""boring"" stuff like algae and archaea.

Getting downvoted by people thinking ""whaaat you ignorant fuck,"" and then suddenly everyone gets in a white knight mood when some brave soul stands up for you, ""ACTUALLY, guys, it's OKAY that he doesn't know the show! We are a noble people!"" Then everyone just fucking goes along with it like the fucking lemmings we are.   When I save up some money, I'm going to experiment by gilding some seriously controversial comments to see just how far I can push this flip flopping."

Just make a few alts and upvote stuff and watch the most bullshit things soar to the top all because it was +5 when it got the most attention. It's really interesting how people upvote shit without reading it just because it was already upvoted a few times, same thing happens in the opposite direction too. It's a fascinating social dynamic that you can actively make people agree/disagree with total bullshit/empirical evidence just by having a few fake people like/dislike it first."

It's even more interesting if you subscribe to a fuckload of random sub's and watch from your frontpage. Then going into specific sub's will give you even more neat info in the comments and the voting trends.   I actually read shit before voting and some things get voted in the complete opposite of what way they should go. An example would be completely unsourced, unscientific bullshit getting voted to the top comment while the actual facts are downvoted because they go against the majority's opinion at that time of day."

IdiotsFightingThings,2m2s7l,itty53,2,Wed Nov 12 19:19:06 2014 UTC,Making a poor guy chase a laser dot around for their own amusement is a pretty solid indication of their personalities and what they're doing.

IdiotsFightingThings,2m2s7l,itty53,7,Wed Nov 12 20:54:17 2014 UTC,"/u/Keerikkadan91 is absolutely right, and I'm sorry reddit responded to him the way they have. OP's post is fuckin' terrible - this isn't an idiot fighting a thing, this is a poor child ignorant of technology because he can barely afford shoes, let alone afford to live in a world where people get to play on reddit while 'working'.   ""Was anyone hurt? What's so bad about this?""   Hypothetical: If I'm in school and a child is asked by the teacher, ""What's the capitol of California?"" and he replies ""Los Angeles"", and everyone laughs at him, then points out that he's stupid, then films him answering wrong and posts that video on the internet... does that hurt the child?   It's fucking wrong. Just like this. This is garnishing a laugh by manipulating the ignorance of a child. If it's your child, that's one thing - parents do this kinda thing all the time (with the intent of educating the child). But when kids do it to each-other in school, we call that 'bullying'. It's not fucking okay for kids to make fun of each other for being poor; it's not fucking okay for reddit to make fun of the ignorance of this poor kid.  I'm willing to bet eventually that kid heard someone laughing at him as he stumbled on that roof. I don't know about you guys but when I was in school, being 'taken for a joke' and then being laughed at for it was one of the worst feelings ever as a kid. This really is a fucked up video, and it's fucking despicable that so many people are willing to defend it as if it's 'all just in good fun'.   People are awful. Jesus."
IdiotsFightingThings,2m2s7l,itty53,3,Thu Nov 13 00:01:06 2014 UTC,"Stupid explanation. It's exactly the same thing, if you scare someone with a big cosplay robot, there are tons of videos where people are curious or scared by things they don't immediately understand, the only difference here is that the kid is poor. So instantly it's the worst thing in history to laugh at this."
IdiotsFightingThings,2m2s7l,Sutartsore,4,Thu Nov 13 13:48:46 2014 UTC,"It's very dismissive (and manipulative) of you to say sarcastically ""So instantly it's the worst thing in history to laugh at this"".   You think because it isn't the worst thing in history (of course it isn't), that the rest of your argument is subsequently validated. It is not. You're not going to find some magic excuse that says 'bullying is okay' in the idea of this not being the worst thing in history.   Bullying is not okay. Bullying based on class is even less okay. That's what's happening in this video. Defending the act of bullying based on class is about as far from 'okay' as you can get. You're a shithead."

IdiotsFightingThings,2m2s7l,itty53,-9,Wed Nov 12 21:09:16 2014 UTC,"Have you ever watched and laughed at Family Guy?  If so you have supported making fun of gays, the holocaust, racism, rape, and countless other human atrocities.  I am not saying that the prank someone pulled on this kid isn't a dick move, but it wasn't me or anyone else on reddit who did it.  The fact of the matter is that plenty of other horrible shit happens all the time and people make a living of making fun of all of it.  Laughing at something is a way to take the power away from it.  It is sometimes a crass and insensitive way to do it, but it is a fact of life."
IdiotsFightingThings,2m2s7l,theredball,11,Wed Nov 12 21:34:58 2014 UTC,"I don't know about you, but the humor Family Guy and other cartoons, especially South Park, seems to me to be making fun of the people who are the ones making fun, or performing socially unacceptable things that are accepted to an extent by our society.  The creators of Family Guy are not homophobes, anti Semitics, racists, or rapists. They make fun of those people. Dumb people just can't read into the humor."
IdiotsFightingThings,2m2s7l,itty53,6,Wed Nov 12 22:24:14 2014 UTC,"Family guy is satire. As MacFarland has said, ""We hold a mirror up to society and say 'Society, you're awful'"". If you don't understand Satire, I agree, you might think that laughing at Family Guy is exactly the same as this. But I do understand satire: Family Guy is a cartoon. This is a real kid. There's a wide difference.  ""It wasn't me, [why shouldn't I laugh at it then?]"" - because you're an insensitive, self-entitled, spoiled little prick. ""I didn't rape that girl, why can't I make fun of it?"" Yeah, same idea, but you'll probably get a little disgusted at that right? That's how you make me feel, right now. Disgusted at the lack of humanity.  ""Laughing at something is a way to take the power away from it."" - Sure, if the kid in the video were laughing. This is a true statement applied entirely out of it's context. You're right, laughing does take power from it... but that's not what's going on. Others are laughing at him and his poverty-stricken state. That is not 'taking power from poverty'. You're sitting here defending those people. You might actually be worse than them for it.  Yes, bad shit happens in the world. That's not an excuse to defend bad shit. Can you act like any more of a spoiled little brat here?"
IdiotsFightingThings,2m2s7l,theredball,-6,Wed Nov 12 22:36:31 2014 UTC,"""It wasn't me, [why shouldn't I laugh at it then?]"" - because you're an insensitive, self-entitled, spoiled little prick.

Disgusted at the lack of humanity.   trivializing rape is much better"
IdiotsFightingThings,2m2s7l,itty53,2,Thu Nov 13 01:11:02 2014 UTC,"It's only trivializing if you see it in such a way that yes, you can make fun of it because it wasn't you. It's a disgusting idea; I needed one to make a point.   If you have a point to make, make it. If not (doesn't appear so), get fucked."
IdiotsFightingThings,2m2s7l,Theonetrue,-7,Wed Nov 12 20:56:30 2014 UTC,You're saying that the same people that find some guy trying to catch a laser pointer are the same people that find rape funny.   It's pretty fucking funny that you actually think this way.
IdiotsFightingThings,2m2s7l,christgoldman,5,Wed Nov 12 21:09:55 2014 UTC,"Oh, so now it's funny, but not trivializing. Way to move those goal posts, keep up the hustle.  Snark aside, you're deliberately twisting my words. I stated that the idea of ""It wasn't me, thus, I'm allowed to make fun of it"" is wrong, no matter what 'it' is. Could be rape. Could be murder. Could be a dude getting pranked for being poor. Doesn't matter: That line of reasoning is flawed and wrong, and I simply use the universally disgusting act of rape to point that out, as it makes the point very clearly. I am not pointing to any single act of rape, or any person. I am talking about the general idea.   What I find funny is that people think that poking holes in my words means anything in the scheme of things. ""Oh, I can point out that it appears he's trivialized rape! That'll completely unravel his whole argument!"" - is that how you really see this? An argument of semantics? Or are you just focusing on something, anything you can say against me to invalidate what I've said?  Let's get back to the topic at hand: If you're laughing at this video, you're almost certainly a shithead in the rest of your life. I'm not trying to change that, I'm not trying to change this sub. I am simply pointing it out for the sake of others who might not want to be seen as a shithead as they go about their day-to-day: If you think this kind of thing is funny, you're a shitty person. Maybe you should reevaluate yourself.   So.. tell me again: what's your point?"

Now, you show them something that you know will confuse them; say, a clip of High School Musical 3. They don't know what the technology is, they don't know what the image is, they don't know what the people in the image are doing... they're confused, frightened, and questioning reality. Now you put your iPad back in its case, get on a plane, and fly home laughing at the impoverished people who were ignorant of Western technology.  In this scenario, you are a lowlife asshole of the same variety of lowlife asshole as the laser pointer guy. Sure, you didn't punch a homeless man in the face or steal his food, but you're still an asshole."

The Blackhawk Serpa has a locking retention mechanism that requires you to press a button to release the firearm, so people can't just walk up behind you and grab your gun, draw it and use it against you in a fistfight, etc.  The problem is that the release button is in a direct line of the trigger. So if you press the button, and continue to apply pressure while drawing - as people are prone to do when trying to do things quickly or in a panic - your finger will close onto the trigger. If you're running something with only a trigger safety (like the Glock), voila, you end up looking like an idiot on YouTube."
IdiotsFightingThings,2l56gv,beanmosheen,21,Mon Nov 3 14:42:38 2014 UTC,People hook their finger and point at the button instead of indexing it like you would above the trigger. That's how it goes boom.
IdiotsFightingThings,2l56gv,soloxplorer,2,Mon Nov 3 15:48:19 2014 UTC,Don't put your finger on the bang switch until you're ready to fire.
IdiotsFightingThings,2l56gv,tremens,6,Tue Nov 18 19:07:17 2014 UTC,"The problem is that the release button is in a direct line of the trigger.   At least not with my Sig 229 (or a 226 for that matter), it's right in line with the frame.  I can comfortably draw and have my finger naturally fall right on the frame above the trigger, right where you need it to be.  I think in this case, the guy was trying to go for speed and miscalculated his muzzle position before placing his finger on the trigger."
IdiotsFightingThings,2l56gv,duhblow7,34,Mon Nov 3 15:02:16 2014 UTC,"Nah. It's a really common problem that a lot of people have experienced. They're even prohibited from use by many law enforcement agencies.  It's still ultimately a failure of the shooter, but it's a very common mistake, particularly under stress, and the holster design doesn't help. I personally feel that no retention mechanism should involved the use of trigger finger, and recommend people at least consider thumb operated or tilt retention holsters."

IdiotsFightingThings,2l56gv,tremens,1 point,Tue Nov 4 08:50:58 2014 UTC,I wouldn't blame the holster. Yes it is a contributing factor.   But the real problem is lack of training. Always do drills with snap caps until you get the hang of it.   But that's just my 2 cents. Could have happened to me just as easily.  Also dude is fucking tough!

IdiotsFightingThings,2l56gv,fukitol-,1 point,Tue Nov 4 01:45:31 2014 UTC,"No need for blanks for testing. Dry fire or snap caps (dummy rounds), sure. I practice dry fire pretty often at home.   Blanks are mostly for making things go boom for effect or for use in certain tools (.22 nail drivers for instance).  They're terrible training aids for this kind of situation. First off - most automatics won't cycle blanks without custom magazines and either recoil springs or a barrel obstruction. Secondly, a blank is still very dangerous, while there's an illusion of safety that could result it people being careless.   This was an accident he was lucky to survive and he learned from it. He made a very serious mistake, but at least it happened in a controlled situation and he was able to get help.   I personally carry without a round in the chamber since my Glock is too easily fired otherwise. I mostly just keep it hidden in the truck because on foot that extra second means it won't be useful if needed."

This outward motion would put forward pressure on the trigger.  The problem here was that he had his finger on the trigger before clearing the holster."

Yes, it's an issue of the finger in the trigger before it's supposed to be, but it happens because people hook their trigger finger and press on the release and continue that pressure through the draw. As soon as the trigger becomes exposed, the finger can slip onto it, and since there's already pressure being applied, a bang happens."

IdiotsFightingThings,2l56gv,moreaccounts2,8,Mon Nov 3 17:47:04 2014 UTC,"Yup the key mistake was that he was standing to close to the target, at any other range this would not have happened."
IdiotsFightingThings,2l56gv,tripleblack,7,Mon Nov 3 20:06:55 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't call it the key mistake. Someone above linked the full video the guy posted, and in it he details exactly what caused him to have a negligent discharge. He had been using a different holster to practice his draw earlier that day, and switched to a different firearm and holster which operate differently. This led him to unwittingly disengage the safety and place his finger in a position where it could slip into the trigger guard and pull off a shot during the draw. He doesn't blame the holsters he used in the video, he blames himself for inattentiveness.  Personally, I would never trust a holster like he was using, as its retention mechanism is designed to be operated in a way that is prone to lead to negligent discharge if the user is inattentive. The latch which disengages the retention mechanism is operated with the index finger, and is placed lower than the barrel, putting the user's finger right in line with the trigger guard. All it takes is a little too much pressure, and bang. I prefer a holster with a thumb release or a strap with a snap over these types of retention holsters.  That said, I also wouldn't do a drill like that with live ammo. I see no need for any more holes in my body."

IdiotsFightingThings,2l56gv,drtylndry,2,Mon Nov 3 16:54:26 2014 UTC,"While it's fun to laugh at this guy, the reason he was so close to the target is because it's a fairly common self defense drill.  The idea is to train the way you'll need to use your firearm.  In this case it's simulating a very common interaction between criminals and victims, the criminal is face to face with the victim who must draw and retain control of the weapon, he does this by first keeping his body between his handgun and the criminal, then pushing the criminal away from him while turning and drawing the weapon.  It's actually a very good drill to practice, this guys failure was in drawing from his holster and getting his finger on the trigger too soon.  This is why convention says to start very slow, concentrate on the steps, naturally you'll get faster and faster without sacrificing safety."

IdiotsFightingThings,2l46is,fuzeebear,0,Mon Nov 3 04:11:36 2014 UTC,"Yes. If he throws a prop or maybe a bad solder on an ESC causes a motor to stop or any number of other things, the quad will come down in the crowd. Seeing that they are flying a Phantom and are obviously unskilled enough to avoid the guy jumping at the quad, they are being reckless."

Started to cuss me out and actually threatened me. ""OH YEA, YOU ONE OF THOSE COWBOY FAGGOTS?! HUH?! YOU LIKE THEM STUPID COWBOYS?! I HOPE YOU DIE.""  I said, nope, I'm outta here. Turned around and walked away as smoothly as I could, even though I was super tense and probably shaking. I was half expecting the dude to attack me while my back was turned but there was dozens of people watching the whole thing from the line, so I was hoping he wouldn't attack me in front of a bunch of people.

IdiotsFightingThings,2kuxsb,RXrenesis8,-7,Fri Oct 31 12:36:02 2014 UTC,I think its fake. The biggest piece of evidence is that old tube tv. Rich kids who can afford to tear stuff up buy nice flat panel tvs and poor kids who tear stuff up usually spend all their money on stuff like nice flat panel tvs. If those kids were sensible enough to save some money by not buying an expensive tv then they would have the sense to not tear up their house like that.   Tl;dr the old tv proves this is fake

IdiotsFightingThings,2kuxsb,Jungle2266,-2,Fri Oct 31 12:14:59 2014 UTC,Low/no income people tend to make poor financial decisions. People who are financially responsible are typically not low/no income people and they wouldn't waste money if they found themselves in a low/no income situation.   Was he leaving blood footprints or was it something that spilled from the the tables he flipped over thag had food on them?

IdiotsFightingThings,2kn3nl,AgentRG,13,Wed Oct 29 03:55:56 2014 UTC,"Fun fact, epileptic seizures range from simple, to Grand mal. Simple being brief momentary memory loss and a feeling of diplacement, grand mal being what you are thinking of, full on convulsions and swallowing your tongue business.   Experiencing a simple partial frontal lobe seizure is horrifying for me. I can't explain why, but during the seizure it is like I am dreaming, the dream is 100% real, and it happened yesterday, and it is the scariest thing ever. The ""dream"" could be something that isn't scary. I still feel great dread, decent amount of pain, and they are mentally exhausting. The worst part is I never remember what the ""dream"" was about. It is forgotten immediately, just a vague dejavu like feeling.   There are many types of epileptic seizures, and many forms of epilepsy! I understand the humor you were going for, but the more you know!"
IdiotsFightingThings,2kn3nl,InformedIgnorance,5,Wed Oct 29 06:31:01 2014 UTC,"The simple seizure you are describing is called a Petite seizure. I suffer from both Grand Mal and Petite.  I agree that the pain is there, but it is in no way decent, if feels as though your whole body is on fire. Put your hand next to a fire, thats what it feels like inside when I suffer one. What you are calling a dream is called an Aura, when a person with a seizure experiences a short term memory loss, as well as a Deja vu feeling. Lets say it is a Saturday, if I suddenly have one, I feel as though my mind was dropped back in time and I am experiencing something that has happened a few months prior, and yes, it is forgotten after like 10 minutes, followed by a misbalance as well as exhaustion, like all muscle power just dropped to 0, but I am back again on my feet like nothing happened in 10 minutes.  Between Petite and Grand Mal, I'd prefer to experience Grand Mal, at least that way I don't remember the pain. It is one of those things that you can't describe unless you experience it."

Its surprising how fast we can recognize and react to data. With games like these, it is just teaching your body and brain what to do when they see the specific symbols."
IdiotsFightingThings,2kn3nl,grantben08,5,Wed Oct 29 08:50:09 2014 UTC,"In games like that, it's almost entirely muscle memory.   All the states of the game can be enumerated and replicated relatively easily (a state being a particular subset of the buttons needing to be pressed at that time), and the trick is in how quickly and accurately you can transition from one state to the next. Those transitions require practice and eventually become muscle memory. Games of this type require great 'mechanical' skill.   Contrast that to a strategy game, let's say chess. The set of all states in that game (a state here being the current arrangement of pieces and whose turn it is) in practice can't be enumerated or replicated (in theory yes, but there are more states than there are atoms in the observable universe, so no). So instead the player must generate general rules or standards to say 'in this sort of state, move this sort of state' (maybe 'when there is an open file, try put a rook on it'). These games require great 'reasoning' skills to be able to generate rules which most often lead the best outcomes (and then calculation to see the specific results of applying that rule over-the-board).  Btw I just came up with this explanation on the spot so take it with a grain of salt."

IdiotsFightingThings,2kn3nl,kbox,5,Wed Oct 29 05:28:42 2014 UTC,"You're right that it's normal to feel frustration at failing, and you're right that some handle it better than others. The skill of constructively dealing with frustration is something that can be learned & developed.  The consequences of not being on top of rage issues are more far-reaching than one might expect. Other than the possibility of hurting yourself or others, rage also affects how people perceive you and interact with you. People are pretty tuned into emotional cues & body language, so they notice when you're raging internally even if you're trying not to express it -- even if you're not aware of it. This affects how they interact with you, their opinion of you, their desire to hang out with you. Nobody wants to be around someone who's liable to explode at any moment.  Ragers often get a kind of pleasure or release from indulging in their anger, so they rationalise their outbursts or try not to think about whether it's good/bad to indulge in it. The question is whether that's you, and whether that might be a factor in stopping you from actively working to overcome rage issues."

IdiotsFightingThings,2k0908,N0rthernLight,25,Wed Oct 22 17:04:13 2014 UTC,I honestly don't know. The car's not out of control and I don't think he's trying to hurt anyone. I'm not even sure if he's trying to get in or out. This is just incredibly stupid.

IdiotsFightingThings,2k0908,bananapeel,7,Wed Oct 22 19:52:01 2014 UTC,It looks like they're fighting by the way she's dragged by the window as he speeds off.  I'd wager it was a drunken argument and he wanted to leave in a hurry and thought he could bust through it but it turned out to be a dead end.  Why he didn't turn the car around and go through it the way he came in I don't know. I'd guess there's a tow bar/exhaust/bumper catching on the back.

IdiotsFightingThings,2jm6n3,Sycraft,2,Thu Oct 23 01:06:46 2014 UTC,"As Ze Frank would say ""That is how the consumer Taser do."" Police Tasers fire only when the trigger is down, and stop when you release. The assumption is police are trained on their usage and will incapacitate someone as long as needed. They then want to go and detain the person.  Consumer Tasers, particularly the Taser C2, fire for 30 seconds. They do so because the idea is you nail someone with it, drop it, and run. By the time it finishes you have a good head start, and it'll take the person a while to recover So you should be able to get to safety. Since they are for (presumably) untrained personel and for escape rather than for temporary incapacitition, that is how they are set up.  It is perhaps not the best idea for zapping your friend with while you make a stupid video."

I'm pretty sure we're the only species that regularly decides to just go out and do shit for no reason other than that we can.  We revel in our ability to create such a large surplus of stockpiled resources that we can spend our time doing whatever the Hell we want. We went to the fucking Moon, and why? We didn't go there to get resources or anything, we just did it because we felt like learning something new. We create beautiful, awesome works of art which, although they don't appear to have a practical purpose on the surface, allow us to explore facets of our existence of which we would never have otherwise become cognizant. And that's awesome.  I feel like this is kind of the dark side of that exact same thing that makes humanity awesome: Sometimes we do shit that doesn't make practical sense just because we feel like doing it and we have enough surplus resources to do so. Sometimes that results in people like this guy."

As someone who is an atheist who studies euphoria, I am telling you, specifically, in atheism, no one calls trilbys fedoras. If you want to be “specific” like you said, then you should too. They’re not the same thing. If you’re saying “fedora family” you’re referring to the euphoric grouping of le reddit army, which includes things from neckbearded gentlesirs to highly intelligent intellectual like myself. So your reasoning for calling a trilby a fedora is because random people “say that only neckbeards wear fedoras?” Let’s get Mountain Dew and Doritos in there, then, too"

IdiotsFightingThings,2ikjnz,Ochinosoubi,2,Tue Oct 7 21:51:53 2014 UTC,"The Darwin Awards uses the ""Desert Island"" thought experiment to determine if someone is eligible for an award.  The experiment states that if person A was alone on a desert island with one fertile member of the opposite sex B, could A reproduce with B?  Assuming this guy was rendered infertile by his actions in this gif, regardless of whether or not he has children, he would still fainl the Desert Island thought experiment, and is thus eligible for an award.  On a more scientific note, the concept of natural selection means that traits beneficial for a group of organisms in certain environments are selected for, while traits that are hazardous (such as sufficient stupidity to try to light a balloon filled with flammable gas) are not.  Natural selection says that beneficial traits are more likely to propagate through a population, while detrimental traits are more likely to die off.  Therefore, even if this person has children, this trait remains less likely to propagate, so the conditions for Darwinism are still fulfilled."

IdiotsFightingThings,2ikjnz,Patrik333,2,Tue Oct 7 23:24:54 2014 UTC,"I don't know. This looks like a pretty typical stunt like my pyro friends would have pulled in Boy Scouts if not for the watchful eye of our leaders who immediately confiscated all aerosol cans from the dumb kids and all butane lighters from anyone under 17.  They still let us get away with some stupid shit. For example my tent almost went up in smoke due to a lighter fluid incident. And... we almost set two or three other tents on fire the same way but not at the same time because we're all smart.  We put a very thick layer of lighter fluid on top of the water barrel which is meant for dousing tent fires should any occur. Then we lit the fluid and it burned for about 10 minutes. Petroleum based lighter fluid floats in case that info surprises anyone. Oh, and that has nothing to do with the tent almost burning.   When not at scout camp and left unsupervised my buddy and I were playing with a mostly empty gas can watching the fumes burn their way into the neck. One time he squeezed the sides of the can and the whole can glowed like the sun just before a jet of flame shot about 15 feet across the fire pit right next to my head and my first response was ""do it again! That was fucking awesome!"""
IdiotsFightingThings,2ikjnz,OmarDClown,2,Tue Oct 7 23:29:08 2014 UTC,What was wrong with it?   My science teacher did a similar demonstration with a hydrogen balloon and a lighted splint... obviously it didn't go so badly wrong like this one did but maybe the guy in the gif was just trying to emulate what he'd seen in class.
IdiotsFightingThings,2ikjnz,I_am_the_LION,24,Tue Oct 7 23:30:11 2014 UTC,"So my guess is your teacher filled the ballon and tied it off, cutting off the source of hydrogen. To me, it looked like this guy was still filling the balloon. When it finally ignited, the flame was either hot enough to ignite the can as well; or it traveled into the can, causing the explosion."
IdiotsFightingThings,2ikjnz,mcdrunkin,10,Tue Oct 7 18:52:32 2014 UTC,"Ohhhh okay. That's dumb.  ...Although, I can't talk - I've made mini-flamethrowers out of aerosol cans before."

Once the fuel is cut off, the fire goes out. What this guy did is collect allll of the fuel into a condensed space, and lit it at once. He made a small bomb, in other words. If you make a bomb, you're gonna have a bad time."

IdiotsFightingThings,2ikjnz,stufoor,5,Tue Oct 7 20:19:22 2014 UTC,"It can, if you point the flame downwards. If you point it up/out, you'll be fine. Aerosol burns fast, but not fast enough that it can travel into the can. Now, if you put the fuel source above the flame, then you're going to get hurt. Strike a match, and hold it upright and watch the flame die. Now strike another match and rotate it from horizontal to upside down and watch as the flame gets bigger. Same concept. Don't burn yourself with the match, please."
IdiotsFightingThings,2ikjnz,mcdrunkin,1 point,Tue Oct 7 20:45:20 2014 UTC,"It can travel back into the can, it's just relatively rare. The risk exists, but it's one of those risks that is exaggerated to deter people from doing it."

There's an awful lot of force so unless he stabbed a bomb in that toaster this is pretty fake right from that.  You can also see the flash frame where they just white everything out, then the three guys leap back from the ""force"" and then the new blown up toaster is there. That's when the replacement is dropped in. It's basically just shitty special effects but because the video looks ""amateur"" people don't really criticize it like they would a TV show."

IdiotsFightingThings,2i7h3r,Sciar,0,Sat Oct 4 00:10:43 2014 UTC,Like most things you get a tiny shock unless you really jam it in there and make on hell of an electrical connection. Also having a wooden or plastic handle would really cut down on anything being transferred. Those pure metal butter knives would probably get you the worst.  Long knife is going to be shittier for transferring electricity than the short one. When they swapped out his knife they actually made what he was doing WAY safer.

The glass is highly stressed in manufacturing to make it resistant to damage, and it's a vacuum inside. If you manage to break the glass, it can (though rare) send shards at a high enough velocity to kill you if it hits the right place."
IdiotsFightingThings,2i5yr1,Anticept,53,Fri Oct 3 06:51:17 2014 UTC,"Not to mention potentially dangerous chemicals. There can be leaded glass, cadmium, mercury, etc. depending on the age of the CRT.  Also aren't the capacitors potentially dangerous? I don't know the specifics, I just remember being told multiple times not to disassemble TVs that I found in the trash because I could die. Could be a myth."
IdiotsFightingThings,2i5yr1,bg-j38,21,Fri Oct 3 07:29:19 2014 UTC,"It's not just the capacitors. Glass exhibits a funky phenomenon where it stores electrical charges (deep charge) from use and can actually recharge back up over a few hours!  EDIT: it's called dielectric absorption. Just like a capacitor, glass stores charges too."
IdiotsFightingThings,2i5yr1,Anticept,44,Fri Oct 3 07:37:21 2014 UTC,You totally just described a capacitor.
IdiotsFightingThings,2i5yr1,BambooFingers,9,Fri Oct 3 11:04:44 2014 UTC,"Yes i know :). The actual capacitors can be removed, and the glass can still charge back up just sitting there and give you a good bite. That's what catches people off guard, you think the risk isn't there because the caps and electronics are removed, then you catch the anode wire running from the top and it gives you a nice reminder that you should have stayed in bed that morning :)"
IdiotsFightingThings,2i5yr1,Anticept,-4,Fri Oct 3 16:45:25 2014 UTC,"Yup, capacitors hold a charge for a long time. It's why they want you to be grounded when you work on computers. I've been shocked a lot my first couple times putting one together because I moved around too much. Ended up killing a few parts.  At least they were really cheap hand me downs."
IdiotsFightingThings,2i5yr1,Drudicta,25,Fri Oct 3 12:39:35 2014 UTC,"You're getting downvoted because what you're talking about isn't a capacitor discharge, it's ESD: Electrostatic Discharge.   Capacitors can be dangerous (or useful) because they can release their charge extremely quickly, which is why even a relatively small one in a TV or microwave can cause severe burns or even cardiac arrest if you get the current in the wrong place.   ESD at the level we worry about while working on computers is usually just caused by static electricity, the kind you can get from rubbing your socks on the carpet. You can easily build up a minor charge by moving around and that little shock you feel if you touch someone is enough to ruin some computer components, and that's where grounding yourself before you touch your components saves your computer, it gives that charge somewhere to go other than through the delicate electronics."

IdiotsFightingThings,2i5yr1,Torisen,5,Fri Oct 3 16:32:04 2014 UTC,"The big difference is in the amperage of the different forms of electricity, yes?"
IdiotsFightingThings,2i5yr1,surfnaked,5,Fri Oct 3 18:06:21 2014 UTC,"OK, here's where it gets muddy, technically they're the exact same thing.  When people say you should be grounded while working with electronics, what's actually happening is a moving person generates a static charge and is a better conductor for it than the surrounding material (air, etc) and becomes a capacitor to hold a static charge.  The device of a (simple) capacitor is just two charged plates with an insulating layer (called a dielectric; often air, vacuum, glass, or any non-conductive material) that separates them, and they store energy electrostatically in the electric field between the plates.  So it's the same type of energy being released, but manufactured capacitors can be physically dangerous because they store that energy much better than we do, and thus can hold much more of it to release all at once than we can by touching another person or unfortunate piece of RAM.  Lightning is also ""just"" ESD where (heavily simplified explanation) the moving air at altitude generates a static electricity charge with the air below acting as the dielectric and the ground acting as the opposite charged plate. The cloud-to-ground strike happens when the charge overcomes the insulating value of the air in between and you get the same effect of rubbing your socks on the carpet and shocking your sibling on a massive scale.  TL;DR: It's not directly different, we're capacitors too, we're just really bad ones when compared to designed capacitors.  EDIT: I realize I didn't directly answer your question, the reason ESD damages electronics is because the total current is too much for their circuitry. The more delicate the circuit, the less total energy it takes, so you might not even feel the ESD it takes to ruin your very delicate RAM, but if you took the capacitor from a TV and shorted it to the exact same place you would completely obliterate the RAM because it's the same process and release, just much more energy, there's not a fundamental difference in the process though."
IdiotsFightingThings,2i5yr1,Torisen,3,Fri Oct 3 19:53:00 2014 UTC,"Well said. Thanks. One question still: the amperage. How much difference does it make? I was under the impression that higher amperage made much lower voltage far more effective and  powerful. I mean a lightning bolt has millions of volts, but a higher amperage lower voltage charge like an electric chair has as much effect doesn't it?"
IdiotsFightingThings,2i5yr1,surfnaked,3,Fri Oct 3 20:57:46 2014 UTC,"There's not a solid answer for this one, neither one really has an effect without the other, THIS VIDEO is worth watching.  The short answer is: for danger, you need both. The reason ""amperage is the dangerous one"" is mostly (as far as I know) because we are surrounded by a lot of high voltage, low amperage electrical sources, and stepping up a relatively high voltage source by just a couple amps can easily be lethal. If you use the really simple Watts = Volts X Amps, you see that you double the total current from 1000v 1a to 1000v 2a.  There's a lot more to it than that, but that's the short-ish answer."

People HAVE DIED from supposedly safe Tazer shocks when the current runs through the heart muscle instead of skeletal muscle (arms, legs, abs, movement stuff)."

IdiotsFightingThings,2i5yr1,Pokemaniac_Ron,5,Fri Oct 3 10:21:50 2014 UTC,Prince rupert drops are a phenomenon caused by the different cooling rates and therefore different tensions levels of the surface and of the centre of the glass right? Surely that's now how they make old tv things
IdiotsFightingThings,2i5yr1,mfizzled,5,Fri Oct 3 10:59:03 2014 UTC,But the strain is more concentrated at the tail.
IdiotsFightingThings,2i5yr1,Pokemaniac_Ron,2,Fri Oct 3 16:25:51 2014 UTC,"I pointed out PRDs because it's similar stresses. Because of the vacuum inside the TV, the outside of the TV is in compressive stress. There isn't really any tensile stress like in a PRD, but there's still a lot of stress and energy waiting to be released."
IdiotsFightingThings,2i5yr1,Anticept,5,Fri Oct 3 16:52:24 2014 UTC,When I was a teenager I was asked to move old CRT TV without back cover at school electronics club.

IdiotsFightingThings,2i5yr1,Khalexus,14,Fri Oct 3 12:25:54 2014 UTC,"Some pieces do rush inwards. Other pieces get batted around and thrown outwards. The vacuum simply means that there is a lot more potential energy waiting to be released.  It doesn't always happen, but sometimes if you break them just right, the explosion is spectacular.  I used to work in a recycling plant and we were screwing around one time breaking TVs (not a good thing due to mercury and phosphorous dust in retrospect), and one sent big ass shards 50 feet. We stopped right then.  Basically, CRTs have similar stresses as prince rupert's drops"
IdiotsFightingThings,2i5yr1,Anticept,7,Fri Oct 3 06:54:38 2014 UTC,No need to be a dick.
IdiotsFightingThings,2i5yr1,Anticept,4,Fri Oct 3 07:05:46 2014 UTC,"A lot of it does rush inwards, but the thing is shattering glass is a pretty volatile, unpredictable thing, and generally stuff goes in all directions. Also, things don't shatter in perfectly symmetrical patterns, so the practical result of all that inward implosive force is going to be a lot of things maintaining momentum after they reach the middle part of what used to be the container, then continuing to fly out the other end.   Picture a circle of people pointing guns at someone in the middle, then someone gives the order to fire. All the bullets are headed inwards, yes, but that doesn't mean they'll stay that way.  Here's an explanation of the physics end of it from someone who's better at physics than I am: https://what-if.xkcd.com/6/"

IdiotsFightingThings,2i5yr1,Drudicta,2,Fri Oct 3 08:07:26 2014 UTC,"But if it's a vacuum, how can it shoot things outward?"
IdiotsFightingThings,2i5yr1,HumpingDog,2,Fri Oct 3 08:16:12 2014 UTC,"Because know kinetic energy doesn't stop when things are sucked in. If there is enough force, the glass will bounce back out."
IdiotsFightingThings,2i5yr1,Anticept,-2,Fri Oct 3 12:37:51 2014 UTC,"But on the way out, the vacuum will exert force in the opposite direction, so it should rougly balance out."
IdiotsFightingThings,2i5yr1,HumpingDog,4,Fri Oct 3 18:24:44 2014 UTC,"Air moves faster than the glass, and the initial inrush will cause an over-pressurization."
IdiotsFightingThings,2i5yr1,Anticept,2,Fri Oct 3 18:34:36 2014 UTC,"That makes sense.  So then when the glass is on its way out, there's not a vaccuum anymore.  And there might even be some air pushing out."
IdiotsFightingThings,2i5yr1,HumpingDog,2,Fri Oct 3 19:53:45 2014 UTC,"Anyways there is tension and compression forces in the glass too during manufacturing. Glass is stronger when it has a little bit of stress. If you break those stress points, it tends to fail spectacularly."

IdiotsFightingThings,2i24y9,AJRay715,-5,Thu Oct 2 17:24:00 2014 UTC,"Depends on how you see the situation. Allowing citizens to carry firearms does deter crimes. These boys, although just playing a prank, were endangering themselves and those who got involved.   Imagine if the person they tried to ""rob"" reacted more violently then a single punch.  I'm not saying they should've been shot, but the knowledge that other citizens can defend themselves in such situations may have deterred then from doing something so foolish."
IdiotsFightingThings,2i24y9,DeVitoMcCool,12,Thu Oct 2 18:19:56 2014 UTC,"Yeah it would have been better if someone else pulled a gun out, mis-fired and hit an innocent bystander. If everyone carried guns and something like that broke out everyone would start pulling their guns and it would look like a wild-west shootout, with those coming late to the game having no idea who started it."
IdiotsFightingThings,2i24y9,AJRay715,2,Thu Oct 2 20:36:13 2014 UTC,"It would not have been better if there was a shootout (which is extremely unlikely, that kind of stuff didn't even happen that often in the ""old west"").  What would be better is you have to go through formal training to get a license to carry, that way only those who've been taught how and when to use a firearm will do so.  There are safe ways to handle weapons."
IdiotsFightingThings,2i24y9,DeVitoMcCool,5,Thu Oct 2 20:42:11 2014 UTC,I absolutely agree there are safe ways to handle weapons. Unfortunately training with a weapon in a controlled environment doesn't mentally or physically prepare someone to discharge the gun when facing extreme situations. Also your argument assumes that only those who have gone through formal training have access to guns.
IdiotsFightingThings,2i24y9,AJRay715,3,Thu Oct 2 20:49:47 2014 UTC,Allowing citizens to carry firearms does deter crimes.   I would argue that it causes far more crimes than it prevents.
IdiotsFightingThings,2i24y9,404_UserNotFound,2,Thu Oct 2 18:49:06 2014 UTC,"That's an easy argument to make because you can't measure the amount if crimes that would've happened vs what actually did (although you do a comparative test; however, there's little room to account for variables).   But if I was to rob or attack someone, I'd rather do it in a place like England than a place like Texas."
IdiotsFightingThings,2i24y9,she_did_what,5,Thu Oct 2 18:54:04 2014 UTC,"Well that's fair. I just think, by looking at gun crime per capita in England vs the US to use your example, you can see that the amount of crime that could've been prevented if there was effective gun control is staggering. And I would much prefer to be robbed or attacked in England than Texas, because I'd rather not have a gun pointed at me. See, it works both ways. It is true that it's very hard to quantify the effects that the possibility of getting shot has on preventing crime, but I would guess (and I am only guessing) that it's not really that huge, and it comes at the cost of always fearing that people around you, including mentally unstable people and criminals, have guns. I don't think that it's worth it."

IdiotsFightingThings,2i24y9,AJRay715,1 point,Thu Oct 2 20:35:26 2014 UTC,.. The person they were 'robbing' was part of the of the prank - the raw footage of these pranks had the victim yelling 'it's a prank' whilst his friend be is getting bashed.  Utterly deserved it.  Doesn't deserve the attention
IdiotsFightingThings,2i24y9,razt125,1 point,Thu Oct 2 23:30:07 2014 UTC,"That I agree with, but were discussing the legality of being armed in public, not wether the robbery was real."
IdiotsFightingThings,2i24y9,AJRay715,0,Fri Oct 3 00:39:35 2014 UTC,If the thief and victim both have guns then the chance for death is really high. When no guns are involved then bystanders can get involved and break some noses. It's better if none of them have guns.
IdiotsFightingThings,2i24y9,Potato_Badger,4,Thu Oct 2 22:59:29 2014 UTC,"But do you think that thieves aren't going to have guns because the law says no? Guns will be manufactured and smuggled in just like any narcotic. The only difference is that when people who's been trained and is qualified to have gun is present, they can help take the power from the perpetrator.  Just imagine how bad a public shooting can get if no one is allowed to have guns but some psychopath was able to acquire one illegally."
IdiotsFightingThings,2i24y9,Hraesvelgr,2,Thu Oct 2 23:07:17 2014 UTC,"That's extremely uncommon in Australia at least. I've never been robbed in Australia, I feel safe walking down most of the dark streets at night. I don't feel the need to carry a weapon to defend myself just in case."
IdiotsFightingThings,2i24y9,Dragonfelx,2,Thu Oct 2 23:22:16 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately it's a little tougher in the US. Our Mexico border has a lot of criminal traffic so smuggling in weapons would be no harder than smuggling in any other illegal item or substance.  I really wish we were in a position to give up firearms.  What's interesting is that since the election of Obama, firearm sales soared. Some of this was due to nut jobs stockpiling but some of this was people realizing that prices were only going to continue to rise so it's best to invest now.  This has been accompanied by a drop in not on only crime rate overall, but firearm related homicide and suicide as shown here.  But kudos for you and Australia! I hope we can get to a point where firearms aren't necessary one day."

Personally, I would only draw my weapon, and afford them the opportunity to say ""It's just a joke man!"" I would then have him lay on the ground until the police arrive to determine if they think it is a joke or not.  But there are many out there who carry and would consider this behavior violent enough to provoke drawing and firing their weapon at the mugger. This would get you justifiably shot, and potentially killed."
IdiotsFightingThings,2i24y9,natrlselection,13,Thu Oct 2 12:29:28 2014 UTC,Getting attack and robbed at an ATM is definitely legal grounds for shooting your attacker. Also the cameras on the ATM would clearly show you being physically assaulted.

If someone is desperate enough to run up and tackle you to the ground just for money, who knows what else they're capable of. If that person is that desperate, he could easily have a knife, or any blunt force object he could beat you with.  Also this isn't just stealing. This is fucking Robbery. You know what Robbery is right?  So yes, you can defend your life. You don't want to get shot? Than don't physically assualt and rob me. It's that simple.  Second of all, crime all over the country has been steadily dropping for the past 25 years.  It's people like you who cherry pick fear mongering articles and continue to pass on bullshit."

IdiotsFightingThings,2i24y9,akashik,3,Thu Oct 2 22:23:36 2014 UTC,"I think the point Goonsrarg is trying to make is that if someone physically attacks you while demanding your money, you have no idea if they're going to pull out a knife or a gun on you whether or not you give it to them. Being mugged is a possible threat to your life, and can responded to as such."

IdiotsFightingThings,2i24y9,akashik,2,Sun Jan 4 13:19:01 2015 UTC,Here's an example of the kind of people that make citizens in the US worried about their safety.  TL/DR: a 17 year old kid beat the piss out of and nearly killed a 67 year old man for picking up the kids litter and throwing it in the trash.  People will kill you for a lot less then money.  You're living in a bubble.
IdiotsFightingThings,2i24y9,thehelios,4,Thu Oct 2 23:32:50 2014 UTC,"It's Australia so if you were to pull out a gun and point it at someone over something as harmless (though stupid) as this, you'd find yourself the one lying on the ground answering questions once the police arrived.  The crowd's reaction is what Australians do.  Help the guy getting 'pranked', and let the 'prankster' know he's a wanker without giving him the attention he wants.  Pull a gun in the middle of an Australian mall like you suggest and trust me - you'll suddenly become the wanker."

IdiotsFightingThings,2hjouy,Artemvlb,50,Fri Sep 26 22:13:18 2014 UTC,"you are allowed to use that, provided you weren't intentionally withholding from the other party (in some cases even then the judge may still allow it).  In this case it would be unreasonable for the driver not to know about his own dash-cam footage long before the case has been referred to the courts."
IdiotsFightingThings,2hjouy,cypherreddit,7,Fri Sep 26 22:27:37 2014 UTC,Ahh ok makes sense. I know that it wouldn't bode well to use obvious dash cam footage after wasting so much tax dollars in a court system. I was just curious how evidence actually worked.    So before you can even present it in court you have to present it to your suer?
IdiotsFightingThings,2hjouy,Artemvlb,7,Fri Sep 26 22:36:28 2014 UTC,"During discovery both sides request documents,/items information, and depositions of the opposing party.  When requesting documents/things the initial request is pretty standard and will always include requests for photos, videos, or written accounts of the accident.  The opposing party has a continuing obligation to produce anything responsive to the request whenever they discover it.  Edit: and if something was requested and not disclosed without good cause, it will be inadmissible.  The system is designed so that their should be no surprise at trial."
IdiotsFightingThings,2hjouy,EsquireSandwich,7,Fri Sep 26 22:41:06 2014 UTC,Well that makes the court system a bit more honest. Hmm
IdiotsFightingThings,2hjouy,Artemvlb,2,Fri Sep 26 23:15:44 2014 UTC,"Yes you are, but you still  need to present it to opposing cousel before you present it in court (not 100% sure on this one) and I believe the judge as well.  Also, if anyone finds out you withheld  evidence to aid your trial you're getting the legal ban hammer of disbarment. The case will be tossed, overturned, or be a mistrial.

IdiotsFightingThings,2h7x8x,autowikibot,16,Tue Sep 23 18:31:47 2014 UTC,"Beslan school hostage crisis:       The Beslan school hostage crisis (also referred to as the Beslan school siege or Beslan massacre)    started the first of September 2004, lasted three days and involved the capture of over 1,100 people as hostages (including 777 children),  ending with the death of 334 people. The crisis began when a group of armed Islamic terrorists, mostly Ingush and Chechen, occupied School Number One (SNO) in the town of Beslan, North Ossetia (an autonomous republic in the North Caucasus region of the Russian Federation) on 1 September 2004. The hostage-takers were the Riyadus-Salikhin Battalion, sent by the Chechen terrorist warlord Shamil Basayev, who demanded recognition of the independence of Chechnya at the UN and Russian withdrawal from Chechnya. On the third day of the standoff, Russian security forces entered the building after several explosions, using other heavy weapons.  At least 334 hostages were killed as a result of the crisis, including 186 children,   with a significant number of people injured and reported missing.

IdiotsFightingThings,2h7x8x,chadcf,5,Tue Sep 23 14:50:09 2014 UTC,I have so many more questions now... Like how would that not have killed or seriously injured hostages sitting inside the bus? And if the bus is full of hostages why would you drive up in an armored vehicle shooting at it continuously with a large caliber machine gun? And why is that machine gun still firing even while your buddies are all swarming the the thing you are shooting at? And if you have that machine gun parked RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER why not just shoot him with it rather than blowing up the bus?  AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH
IdiotsFightingThings,2h7x8x,towo,4,Tue Sep 23 15:25:26 2014 UTC,"Guys removed from the inside seem to be pretty okay.  It's more of an overpressure thing blowing the insides of the bus outward, a bit like a pipe bomb. So not that much damage to everything inside, just serious confusion.  Throwing MG bullets at the drivers means throwing MG bullets at everything behind the driver, which may include hostages. Better confuse the shit out of them and then just whack em a few times in their faces."

The old formula was easier to ignite, which was deemed a safety hazard.  So yeah, this is actually pretty damn close to being real napalm."
