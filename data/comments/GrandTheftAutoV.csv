GrandTheftAutoV,3e28wa,luk3d,8,Tue Jul 21 11:58:11 2015 UTC,"Good write up.  I do some things differently, but I understood all except the finale of pac standard.     kill a hostage. ONLY ONE. Not 0 not 2. ONE. Lester will say something like ""What did I say about killing hostages?"" but nothing happens. This is the only way you don't call N.O.O.S.E..   I've never had to kill a hostage in order to prevent from calling NOOSE.  If I want them I kill everyone, if I don't I kill no one.  That has been my experience.  Obviously you can always kill 1 without notifying them, but my point is I've never needed to."

GrandTheftAutoV,3e28wa,nondescriptwhite,2,Tue Jul 21 14:30:50 2015 UTC,Just saying for the Humane Labs Finale: The air team doesn't need to even take out the Merryweather ground forces. They can just stay high in the air and focus on the helicopters that spawn.
GrandTheftAutoV,3e28wa,AlanAttack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:55:55 2015 UTC,"The heli team can also land on the mountain to south of the Humane Labs facility, jump out and take down the attacking heli's with homing missiles or mini-guns. By the time you've cleared them out the ground team should pretty much be ready to be picked up from the beach."
GrandTheftAutoV,3e28wa,EonLover380,2,Tue Jul 21 15:36:53 2015 UTC,"On the Delivering EMP, one person can do it if they know what they are doing."
GrandTheftAutoV,3e28wa,zedie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:02:41 2015 UTC,"another General Tip.  On Heist Finale (ONLY the Finale) you don't need to rebuy ammo and armor (that you put on, NOT the spares, you can only buy spares at Ammu-Nation outside heists) they'll refill them for you for free every time you restart. Set-Ups you have to buy them every restart however.  Avi Set-Up, is also quite easy to just get up the river into the lake, get close to the town until ""Lose the Cops"" show up, and go back into the lake and avoid the helicopter cones to lose the cops. A lot easier to do than on a car.  Humane Labs, Deliver EMP, I didn't really understand what you said... but with a competent partner, you only need 2 people to do it fast and easy. Take the guards 2 at a time. 2 by the gate, snipe the guy standing above on the right, and head in, snipe the driver of the Insurgent coming out (or hide and let him pass, either works. Shooting's just faster) then go up to the broken Insurgent, shoot the 2 guards, then 2 scientists by the wall behind, wait for the 2 from the stairs to walk out and shoot them. You can also kill the lone guard a bit farther away if you want. Kill the one on the catwalk (if you want, not really necessary) and the scientist/guard by the van you use to escape with. The rest is just simply hack, deliver, and drive out."
GrandTheftAutoV,3e28wa,zedie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:47:40 2015 UTC,"There's a way straight after the gate where you go up upstairs, kill a guy and go on a ladder. When up there, you kill a who keeps walking around, go down, jump, and kill one guard and one cientist looking at the van. After this you can easily clear the other guys by inside to the outside."
GrandTheftAutoV,3e28wa,Dravarden,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:50:21 2015 UTC,"ah I see what you mean... Does that prevent the alarms from being triggered? If the ""normal"" way doesn't work, then I can see it being a safer method, but I think it would be a detour from the ""standard"" way. It's really not much harder to just shoot 2 at a time... IF it's coordinated and competent shooters (not holding the trigger to shoot all the way down alerting everyone)  I also tried going that way once, when I wasn't one of the 2 ""shooting"" nor the ""driver"" so I went on my own way from the ""back""... climbed the ladder, got lost, and had trouble getting down the ladder and landed on my face... and we failed =( I was then told to ""never do that again!""

Selling shark cards are a great way to do that.  But people need to be playing the game to be incentivised to buy  shark cards from seeing the new cars to buy around. Giving extra money for heists is a good way to get people to play who otherwise wouldn't be at that time.   It's not a conspiracy, just business."

But I convinced him to open a ticket and like 10 days later he had his refund.

GrandTheftAutoV,3dy767,KingStigg,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:26:23 2015 UTC,"Another double score week, another week of randoms asking for 20% when they didn't help with setups."

GrandTheftAutoV,3dy767,Tookin,0,Mon Jul 20 17:39:09 2015 UTC,Isn't this what the split was for? To ensure it's fair. Someone who spent 1-2 hours with setups deserves more than someone who hopped in for the finale. You should be happy with 10-15%
GrandTheftAutoV,3dy767,SleepWalkingElites,2,Mon Jul 20 19:00:17 2015 UTC,"80% of random heist runs either don't finish or takes a few restarts to finish. You as a leader of a heist can't guarantee me that you know what you're doing, I can't either, but we're both taking risks (time). And you're fucking joking when you said 10%. Right?"
GrandTheftAutoV,3dy767,Nephilius,-7,Mon Jul 20 22:16:13 2015 UTC,I'd probably play more if it 2x money was the norm.

GrandTheftAutoV,3dy1b0,MissplacedLandmine,32,Mon Jul 20 13:53:15 2015 UTC,"Ha true, I wonder if they could make the ""gate"" like the door to your apartment. Once you go through it, you're on ""your"" property, not everyone elses."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dy1b0,Lance_pearson,15,Mon Jul 20 13:56:38 2015 UTC,Hmmm interesting idea but what if someone flies over and lands in the yard ? Who's yard does he land on   (Probably no ones )   But no help pick up 😢
GrandTheftAutoV,3dy1b0,MissplacedLandmine,37,Mon Jul 20 14:28:59 2015 UTC,Yeah... You're making a very simple and good argument for why we can't have mansions. Now shut up!
GrandTheftAutoV,3dy1b0,bakaraka,9,Mon Jul 20 14:32:31 2015 UTC,"The way it should work is that the property is like a town in the elder scrolls. It doesn't load the same as the outside. It's in its own space. In the actual outside you could still go into the yard, but you wouldn't see people in the house or in the yard as they are in their own space."

GrandTheftAutoV,3dy1b0,vGraffy,2,Mon Jul 20 20:34:46 2015 UTC,Yikes that would be worse. You walk out of your gate and someone suddenly turns visible and the last thing you see is a gun barrel in your face lol

GrandTheftAutoV,3dzm8g,RPMcMikey,-8,Mon Jul 20 21:00:23 2015 UTC,They have never had a classical station in ANY Grand Theft Auto. I don't get why. Saints Row and Sleeping Dogs had them.

GrandTheftAutoV,3dzm8g,Toddler_Souffle,5,Mon Jul 20 21:30:42 2015 UTC,No not to LSRR they just added a whole new station with the songs they used for background music. Which I personally already hated. I like in GTA4 the eery silence after you waste a bunch of cops.
GrandTheftAutoV,3dzm8g,LordAnubis3,4,Mon Jul 20 21:22:13 2015 UTC,Oh I misunderstood then.  Are you talking about The Lab station?  We got that on old gen with last update but it is pretty lackluster.  Just another station that I won't listen to.
GrandTheftAutoV,3dzm8g,aaronmcnips,-1,Mon Jul 20 21:32:39 2015 UTC,Yea and that's exactly my point! Just another crappy station of the exact same music type we already had enough of.   Sweet name by the way
GrandTheftAutoV,3dzm8g,CloakedWarrior4323,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:40:16 2015 UTC,Exactly! I get that they are trying to be current and up to date with music but come on. Literally 2 rock stations and a country station.

GrandTheftAutoV,3dzm8g,aaronmcnips,9,Mon Jul 20 22:42:25 2015 UTC,I want a station that plays whatever you hsve on a flashdrive inserted in the xbox. Or metal
GrandTheftAutoV,3dzm8g,aaronmcnips,9,Mon Jul 20 20:42:45 2015 UTC,"We have that on the PC version, and man it's terrible. Whenever you have that station on, the textures and objects start disappearing, massive pop-in ensues, significant fps drop, etc. The game becomes basically unplayable.

Even if it's a paid service like XM I would be fine with it as long as it worked like any other in game radio station.  That way I can still hear engines, gunfire, and game dialogue.  Then we can all listen to anything we want."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dzm8g,Coffeemugster,2,Mon Jul 20 20:52:02 2015 UTC,Yea that'd be nice! Essentially how San Andreas on Xbox had its own radio station of the music you had on the system.
GrandTheftAutoV,3dzm8g,Testa_Inc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:54:06 2015 UTC,"Probably not gonna happen since it would hog the bandwidth too much. And R* certainly isn't going to make a station which would first test your download speed and then say ""Please connect to a faster network""."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dzm8g,A_The_Ist,3,Tue Jul 21 01:07:23 2015 UTC,I'd be cool with both. I'm not interested in any of the stations we have now. Even the talk show is way too repetitive. The one in Gta IV was much funnier. I need hard rock and metal.
GrandTheftAutoV,3dzm8g,mr_fingers,3,Tue Jul 21 00:30:19 2015 UTC,"I'd LOVE to have a Classical station, just like Leviante FM in Forza Horizon 2. In FH2 and GTA V, classical somehow fits perfectly with destruction and tearing up the off road terrain."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dzm8g,Gaminguitarist,2,Tue Jul 21 06:07:25 2015 UTC,"I wish they had classical... As it stands I have to put my own in and drop in FPS whenever I switch over to that station.

GrandTheftAutoV,3dzm8g,densestport,2,Tue Jul 21 04:24:23 2015 UTC,Yes this would be sweet. And a better Top 40 station or something. Maybe an exclusively 80s Rock or Oldies station too.
GrandTheftAutoV,3dzm8g,mr_fingers,2,Tue Jul 21 05:20:28 2015 UTC,I'd love to see both. Classical music for when you're tearing up mountain roads...

GrandTheftAutoV,3e2j17,Relsic,0,Tue Jul 21 13:59:50 2015 UTC,R* has/had an anticheat system. Modders got innocents banned by unlocking a lot of gun camos all at once for that person. It's a stupid system.

The ground team has the roughest job and my friends were having a really tough time. We failed many attempts and after hours of going at it, we finally finished it. Anyone else probably would have quit out on us.  Among all the randoms out there, this guy was nice enough to stick with us as my friends failed the finale like 9 times. At the very least, most of those times were in the prison, which is actually hard. We didn't have any parachute incidents."

GrandTheftAutoV,3dxepr,UnckyMcF-bomb,44,Mon Jul 20 13:45:52 2015 UTC,The heist setup mission where you have to deliver the emp is probably the most rage endusing mission in gta online. With randoms its one of the biggest gambles you can take. You have to aimlesly drive 10 min towards the insurgent and then drive another 5 minutes towards humane lab. From this point on you have to pray to god that you're not playing with mentally challenged individuals.   The thing that pisses me off the most is the duration it takes to travel. Because you could possibly waste 15 minutes of your life doing jack squat and then some dickhead decides to leave after 2 failed attempts. Why even start when you're not going to finish?  Making us spawn at the insurgent from the beginning would definitely ease the pain. I don't think anyone in this forum would mind.  Needless to say i'm still going to attempt playing this heist. We all could use some extra cash.

Then the guy who's on the platform a bit higher above.  Then the two guys at the Insurgent. At the same time, someone kills the driver insergent when he gets close to the gate.  Then the two scientists near the Insurgent.   Then there should be a loner at the same wall but more farther ahead. Kill him.  Go through the gate and go left to the parking lot then up the stairs to the right.  Kill the one soldier standing around  Then the two scientists near the stairs.

GrandTheftAutoV,3e0ik4,JayJayEl,5,Tue Jul 21 00:44:08 2015 UTC,"It's your network.  If you're in the same house only UPnP will work reliably.  Keep in mind port forwarding usually overrides the DMZ settings so what you think is working doesn't.  It took me weeks of messing around with different settings and configurations.  Read this for a great write up of the issue.  http://www.isolation.se/how-to-use-multiple-xbox-one-consoles-in-a-network  Everyone is slightly different based on ISP and hardware.  To fix my specific issue I took the authors advice and flashed an older router with DD-WRT and enabled the UPnP.  It's worked like a champ for the past 5 months.  There are also a couple (seriously only 2 that I know of, the Netgear Nighthawk R7000 and ASUS rt-n56u) out of the box routers I've heard work great with multiple consoles.  I tried the ASUS, but it still didn't work for me consistently.  I had an old dlink dir-825 in the closet and flashed that.  Good luck"
GrandTheftAutoV,3e0ik4,Blackknighl,2,Tue Jul 21 00:51:59 2015 UTC,"Disabling DMZ and port forwarding has taken both NATs to strict, console says it is behind a port symmetric NAT. Am I to assume that my router is just shitty with UPNP and that I should look into flashing or upgrading to a better router?

GrandTheftAutoV,3e0ik4,Blackknighl,3,Tue Jul 21 01:03:55 2015 UTC,"No worries, it's a frustrating issue.  The problem is routers don't support UPnP the same.  It should be a ""standard"", but it's not.  Each company has their flavor of UPnP support and many do it very poorly.  I would make sure both consoles are set to dynamic ip (DHCP) rather than static IP's.    Then make sure the router has all related port forwarding disabled and DMZ disabled.  Enable UPnP   Reboot everything.  That part is needed to make sure the UPnP table allocates the devices correctly.  Then cross your fingers."
GrandTheftAutoV,3e0ik4,Blackknighl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:11:17 2015 UTC,"Well, I did hard reset the consoles after doing all that, but not the router. They say strict NAT but we are able to connect to people now, so I consider it a success. Thank you!"

It spawns in helicopter spawns & has amazing speed which is essential when attempting to get special crate drops plus you can eliminate any opposition while you're at it.

GrandTheftAutoV,3e0nbe,anhydrous_echinoderm,2,Tue Jul 21 01:42:58 2015 UTC,In what missions can you use your buzzard?
GrandTheftAutoV,3e0nbe,03APR91,3,Tue Jul 21 16:23:56 2015 UTC,"If you want a helicopter, get the Savage, is better than Buzzard."

GrandTheftAutoV,3e0nbe,AMetaLunchbox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:25:23 2015 UTC,"If you want something to utilize for missions, I'd say the Savage. It has unlimited missile fire, and explosive rounds. Messing around in free roam, I'd say the Hydra."
GrandTheftAutoV,3e0nbe,Hitchhiker-42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:16:44 2015 UTC,"I have all of them, and in most cases i use...  ...the Buzzard. In fight are the Hydra or Savage maybe better armed, but based on the better maneuverability of Buzzard, you have a fair chance. But ability to put up a fight is not all. I use the Buzzard very often for transportation, if i like to go somewhere. I spawn everytime not in my apartament, but in my garage directly by the airfield. I am in my Buzzard within 20 seconds, if i order one, so i am in Sandy shores, or paleto bay, or wherever very quickly. For me is Buzzard much more pleasant to fly, then Savage or Hydra, what is important. I can easily and quickly land, wherever i want (p.e. for shopping), the Buzzard does not need much space to land. And, other than in Hydra, i can pick up my friends. So i prefer (in most cases) the Buzzard. Sorry for my bad englisch, but it is my third language and not the best one...

GrandTheftAutoV,3dvqih,beanyrowley,9,Mon Jul 20 07:09:59 2015 UTC,I think its for pseudo parkour.  in gta4 you could grab ledges to jump further - in gtav all you can do is prat-fall(?) and hope you make it.   I dont think its to show off euphoria physics because they are pretty shit in gtav - compared to other rockstar games.
GrandTheftAutoV,3dvqih,colonelniko,2,Mon Jul 20 00:49:53 2015 UTC,It's the same physics engine nothing much was changed. The only difference now is that that rockstar made GTA V more easy to ragdoll then IV because most animations in IV are from San Andreas resulting ragdolls to trigger late.
GrandTheftAutoV,3dvqih,PvTails,11,Mon Jul 20 01:34:21 2015 UTC,Its the same engine - but its dumbed down significantly.   Play max payne 3 or red dead if you have a console and tell me that its not better in those games than in gtav.
GrandTheftAutoV,3dvqih,colonelniko,2,Mon Jul 20 01:48:02 2015 UTC,"In what way is it dumbed down?  You might as well say MP3 and RDR's Euphoria is ""dumbed down"" since people don't fly off like they weigh fifteen pounds, like in GTA IV. Tumbling down something in IV is a lot different than tumbling down a hill in RDR, or going ragdoll anywhere really since they added more ""weight"" to everything.  In IV it was like you were on the moon, but they defintiely improved it in RDR and MP3.  V hasn't changed much from RDR and MP3, are you sure you're talking about Euphoria?"
GrandTheftAutoV,3dvqih,Audax2,4,Mon Jul 20 06:43:59 2015 UTC,"I think the main thing he is talking about is the lack of npc reactions to getting shot. In GTAV, nous are either alive, dead, or play an animation before dying. In gta IV npcs would react to gunshots much more realistic and have multiple states of injury. In RDR npcs would even grasp at where you shoot them, stumble about when getting shot and had many different animations and walkstyles for being injured or crippled or if they are disarmed. In GTAV, npcs don't react to gunshots, they simply fall down and get up."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dvqih,ALPB11,2,Mon Jul 20 14:04:19 2015 UTC,"GTAIV had this annoying thing though where no matter how bad you messed someone up if they were still alive they would roll over and curl up into a fetal position.  The states of injury were cool though, I hate that I can shoot someone in the leg and they can run away at full speed like nothing happened"
GrandTheftAutoV,3dvqih,angrypuppy,2,Mon Jul 20 21:08:08 2015 UTC,"I think that if you only did enough damage to take off their health bars, they still had a chance, but fire, crashes, headshots, falls, explosions and being attacked after downing will result in a kill."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dvqih,ALPB11,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:36:51 2015 UTC,"I am talking about euphoria. I honestly cant believe there is somebody who hasnt realized it yet.  The reactions and range of motion is much greater in mp3 and rdr than in gtav.  For example, shooting an npc in the leg in those games resulted in a limp, and  they also cared to the wound a little bit  right when they got shot. These are the kinds of details im talking about. All the kills felt different.   just play those games and tell me the euphoria there isnt better than gtaV's"
GrandTheftAutoV,3dvqih,colonelniko,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:00:23 2015 UTC,"Those are animations. The leg shooting thing that was in RDR was just a state to put NPCs in after shooting out their knees. Just like how NPCs in GTA V are put in a state where they lie on the ground, sit up, and fire.  In Max Payne 3 you had people writhing on the ground if you wounded them enough and they were dying, along with holding their wounds. Some of this is in GTA V, but they are separate. They're animations.  It doesn't happen with NPCs, but with enemies that are firing back at you, if you don't shoot them enough in the torso, and they are still standing, they'll become more and more injured- slouching over, struggling to keep their arm up and fire their weapon, grasping at the wounds their chest etc.  Of course, just like in MP3 you don't see it a lot because:   It only happens to enemies, not civilian NPCs that flee. Only gangs, cops, NOOSE, FIB etc. Most of the time everyone just mows down their enemies or lands a headshot, so you never have a chance to see these things."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dvqih,Audax2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:15:44 2015 UTC,Is that true? Is there any evidence of that? I've played both games a lot and I can't remember even similar animations

GrandTheftAutoV,3dvqih,Spankinator92,3,Mon Jul 20 09:26:02 2015 UTC,"Online syncing issues. Tell a friend to get on a bike and then hit something. Watch as he's suspended midair for a second and then falls forward and then hits the ground. On his screen, he flew off normally, but on your screen he bounced into the air, got stuck there for a split second and then catapulted forward. This is why there is no ragdoll mode in GTA Online. Most people know this, so you can't state that there's an unknown reason for it."

I remember picking a plane or chopper from time to time to goof around in free roam and the flight skill increased steadily. When the Flight School update came around, my flight kill filled to the max almost instantly. Like a full bar for every course. I don't know if my skills were bugged or if yours are, but it shouldn't take you so long to rise your skill. Hell, I even maxed it out fo my secondary character in a different account and I don't even do plane or helicopter races. Kinda weird. Just out of curiosity, what level are you and how long have you been playing with that character?"

GrandTheftAutoV,3dyd8s,Alion1080,2,Mon Jul 20 16:46:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I mean. My advice, mentalize yourself to be good at flying with your current skills. Practice a lot in free roam. By the time your skill bar finally fills up, you won't even need it."

I still don't like the turbulence and the overall shittiness of the vehicles, Mavericks are almost unusably bad when you're low level.  I've leveled a character to 175 already, I have no interest in starting over with 0 shortcuts. Like I said to someone else in this thread, leveling systems like this where everyone just ends up in the same place are pointless. Skill systems should be for specializing certain abilities, not just to say ""I did ____ for _____ hours"" and make that thing artificially harder until you have."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dyd8s,Dranzogger,4,Tue Jul 21 17:08:00 2015 UTC,"air races, pick up a helicopter from various heliports and just fly around, or hover at high altitude and go AFK (not sure if it counts if you aren't moving)   re-do the Flight School challenges until you get Gold. They're frustrating, but doable, and can get you pretty far.   Basically just fly any chance you have. I like flying and that's one of the first I maxed."

GrandTheftAutoV,3dyd8s,OcelotWolf,-9,Mon Jul 20 16:16:54 2015 UTC,It doesn't take that long if you're a competent pilot   1% for every ten minutes in the air is the skill increase formula for just plain flying around. I would count that as taking pretty long.
GrandTheftAutoV,3dybup,kingmunchkin,7,Mon Jul 20 15:09:58 2015 UTC,There's a dude on YouTube named Broughy1322 who tests out all the cars.  He'll give you some guidance on which cars to choose.    Definitely learn to brake.  Losing a little speed purposefully (but still maintaining control) is WAY better than crashing and coming to a complete stop.
GrandTheftAutoV,3dybup,Blackstaff,5,Mon Jul 20 17:22:39 2015 UTC,"Get to know a circuit, get to know a particular car on that circuit, preferably one that everyone says is the fastest in it's class, and run some races with you as host and turn off custom cars so you'll be on equal terms.  And yeah, you have to use those breaks! And racing line is a very big deal, outside-inside-outside on all corners"

GrandTheftAutoV,3dybup,Sn3ipen,3,Mon Jul 20 16:04:29 2015 UTC,"Release the gas sometimes instead of keeping it to the bottom. Even a gentle curve can make you lose controll if you are going to fast. You should also get a controller, since it is so much better for driving."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dybup,inlimbo57,2,Mon Jul 20 16:29:56 2015 UTC,"To start off with concentrate on getting round the track without crashing, a little too slow is better than a total wipeout. Gradually build up the speed. Keep racing even if you are far behind for the practice, don't give up like a lot of people do. Try and race clean and not ram people."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dybup,Blackknighl,3,Mon Jul 20 18:04:56 2015 UTC,"My tip is to race more, you have 44 races total...   Play more, learn more."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dybup,MyMotherWasAhampster,2,Mon Jul 20 21:36:46 2015 UTC,"450w 550L Trick in big races with lots of people, stay back at first, or try your best to get out in front asap. My strategy is wait for the first turn, always tons of carnage in the first turn. Then drive through the debris. Take corners wide to inside helps maximize your speed. When someone is trying to PIT you let off the gas this gives you more control, sometimes when timed right you can slam on your e-brake and brake and they zoom past you into a wall, but letting off the gas anytime you feel your losing controls gives your car way better handling. Also its not always about over taking another racer immediately,  wait for openings by riding behind them, wait until you know you can pass.  If you have a mic and another player by you has a mic communicate and work together (doesn't happen often) but if you find someone back in pack willing to work with you, you can easily catch up by drifting off one another and simply say ""passing on your right, or passing on your left so they can give you room. This is such a great strategy and heavily under utilize due to poor racers who will fight you early on just to get one spot ahead. Knowing tracks helps but expanding your radar to see up coming turns and if it is a sharp or long rounded turn let's  you know when to brake or let off gas. Identify aggressive racers when you try to pass. If your in the lead an going into a turn and drift is on use it to your advantage drifting into a turn is a poor decision as it usually sucks you to the outside wall where an obstacle is very likely to be in your way, other racers will generally drift when ever they can. So if they're close to you during a turn let them drift.The car you choose for each class is the biggest advantage you have from the get go look up to see which car to buy or steal for each class. My go to is zentorno for super, massacro for sports, gaunlet for muscle, and exemplar for coupes. Boat races just hold back on the left joystick to get better speed, air races flat out just suck."

I assumed this was the end and I was very excited about my pay out, especially at such a low level. While we were in the air and flying into the city I accidentally hit F on my keyboard and casually saw myself (the pilot) open the door and jump out.

GrandTheftAutoV,3dwk2s,hawlbucker,10,Mon Jul 20 11:15:58 2015 UTC,"Lamar is not good at getting solid job leads. Just about every mission of his in story mode wound up in a firefight with no pay. I mean I know Stretch was setting him and Franklin up for the Ballas, but Lamar's judgment on taking jobs wass pretty bad."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dwk2s,thecoffee,8,Mon Jul 20 09:26:45 2015 UTC,"I was just about to say, Lamar is not competent enough to be a drug leader.  And since the Online world takes place (I think they said) 6 months or more than the Story mode, Lamar and Franklin haven't even begun their journeys into the dirtier side of the crime world yet. Lamar wouldn't even be experienced or be able to do whatever this Gerald guy does, who by the way he moves and talks, sounds like the Godfather of Dope who doesn't need to talk or move much. Gerald looks like the type who sends a quick message through stare downs and short sentences."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dwk2s,ILoveRegenHealth,18,Mon Jul 20 11:41:35 2015 UTC,"In the online trailer of GTA, the narrator says that you would be introduced to new people to expand the online (mission) experience. So Gerald is one of those people, and he wants us to get drugs for him so we can get cash."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dwk2s,Fresh-Sweater,3,Mon Jul 20 03:27:24 2015 UTC,"Others have said this, but Lamar is incompetent. He's a star-reaching, tree-seeing fuck up that holds Franklin back. Lamar's character is about Franklin displacing his hood loyalty for savvy,  common sense, and survivablity. The Family's territory has been claimed by the Ballas and Lamar is just holding on to the past.  Gerald represents street savvy and the grey areas of gang relationships. Everyone down the way knows each other and the smart ones are trying to move passed the past. Lamar is stuck while Franklin is trying to look forward. Hence the need for someone like Gerald; clearly from the Family's territory and loyal to his roots (all his missions are anti-Ballas) but not tied down so hard that he won't go outside the rivalry to thrive the best he can.  TLDR; He is a plot device."

GrandTheftAutoV,3dvqkh,AquilaVI,3,Sun Jul 19 23:10:11 2015 UTC,So how should I level up and get money??
GrandTheftAutoV,3dvqkh,Spankinator92,4,Sun Jul 19 23:17:02 2015 UTC,"Taken straight from GTA V wiki about GTA V Online missions:  Difficulty Level Cash and RP Bonus   Completion on Normal difficulty earns a 25% RP and cash bonus for all participants. Completion on Hard difficulty earns a 50% RP and cash bonus for all participants.   Crew RP Bonus   Completion by at least two players in the same crew rewards a 20% RP bonus to each of those participating crew mates.   Friend RP Bonus   Completion by at least two players on each other's friends lists rewards a 10% RP bonus to each of those participating friends.   Free-Aim RP Bonus   Completion with the mission session targeting mode set to ""Free Aim"" earns a 25% RP bonus for all participants.   Multi-Player Cash and RP Bonus   Completion by at least two players in general, or a full lobby, rewards an RP bonus to all participants. Completing a mission with multiple people will earn the players bonus cash. If two players are in the mission, they will each earn 10% more cash, three players will net 20% more, and four players will net 30% more (not additive).   TL;DR - Make sure you are in a free-aim lobby. Do missions with 3 other people. Make sure all of you are in the same active crew and all of you are friends with each other. And obviously set the difficulty to hard. Do contact missions. Missions from Mandrazo and Lester are opened at higher ranks. These missions give more RP and cash. Additionally, do them within 5-16 minutes to maximise profits."

GrandTheftAutoV,3dvqkh,_Toecutter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:21:49 2015 UTC,How much do their jobs usually give you?? And can they be done solo
GrandTheftAutoV,3dvqkh,workalex,8,Sun Jul 19 23:28:08 2015 UTC,"They pay between $6000 to $15000 IIRC, and most of their jobs can be done solo."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dvqkh,Kryptohm,2,Sun Jul 19 23:47:22 2015 UTC,"Los Santos Connection and A Titan of a Job have the best payouts (as far as I've been able to tell) when playing solo. I think a solo run through los santos connection on hard will payout $20,400 plus there's about $8000 to be picked up throughout the mission."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dvqkh,my_useless_opinion,3,Mon Jul 20 14:51:09 2015 UTC,"I suggest level up. Doing missions, rank a bit more. You're a level 12. So youre not on full strenght, have not unlocked everything in the game. Suggest you do that, then people will invite you."

GrandTheftAutoV,3dvqkh,BingeWatchingBrBa,3,Sun Jul 19 22:56:34 2015 UTC,"Gerald missions are easy and well-payed for low-level players.  I actually know how it feels. I have a high level myself, but from time to time I create a second character just for fun (and for plastic surgery glitch). And yes, low-level me is kicked out from every good mission (not even heists) most of the time. And people just don't want to risk of failing the heist because someone's stats and weapons are bad.

GrandTheftAutoV,3dvqkh,BugsyQ5,3,Mon Jul 20 05:46:08 2015 UTC,/r/HeistTeams
GrandTheftAutoV,3dvqkh,surviveseven,3,Mon Jul 20 01:21:26 2015 UTC,"I once hosted a setup with a level 4, an obnoxious Mexican kid, and a third guy who spent 2 full minutes idling on the outfit selection screen.  The third guy seemed to not realize that you can, in fact, LAND a helicopter. The kid died constantly, and in times where no one else would have -- apparently he never took cover. On the other hand, the level 4 was a champ -- just a default pistol in a scenario where I was using high-end shotguns and MGs, and he had no trouble at all.  That really changed my perspective. The thing is, heists and setups have a very high failure rate compared to contact missions (since contact missions are much more forgiving about how exactly you do what you do, and are more willing to be okay with you dying). Because of this, hosts who have done heists before are trying to make reliable money off of them (this is usually very difficult if you're not playing with dedicated friends), and so they're trying to weed out people who they think will be most likely to cause the heists to fail.  To be fair, the people most likely to cause a heist to fail are first-timers. What I recommend is, if you want to make sure that your heists/setups go off without a hitch when you do start managing to stay in them, watch videos of people doing them on youtube or what have you to see what you're supposed to do and what to expect (especially when you need to ignore what the game tells you to do). Meanwhile, do contact missions and get good at those (they're eventually more reliable money anyway) and you'll become a better player. Finish story mode if you haven't already.  And eventually, buy a high-end apartment so that you can host your own heists. Can't be kicked from your own heist, after all."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dvqkh,Mr_Creeper_19,2,Mon Jul 20 01:29:32 2015 UTC,"try and level up your stats especially shooting, also make sure your outfit looks like you know what you're doing. and levelling up doing missions is not hard so try and get into the 20's and 30's."

GrandTheftAutoV,3dwcnt,_samthesloth,5,Mon Jul 20 02:06:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. It's only 50% off, and you can only sell vehicles for IIRC 1/3 of their price."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dwcnt,DyLaNzZpRo,5,Mon Jul 20 02:33:55 2015 UTC,"When selling vehicles, you receive 60% of the original purchase price if you purchased the vehicle, or 10% of the vehicles value if you acquired it off the street.   I don't know how selling a vehicle bought at a discount works though..."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dwcnt,Psychko,2,Mon Jul 20 02:47:08 2015 UTC,"Ahh, I knew it was around that but I've never really well, tested it. I mean, if that's the case it MIGHT work? I mean, I doubt Rockstar would change the resale value."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dwcnt,DyLaNzZpRo,2,Mon Jul 20 03:04:46 2015 UTC,"It might work, but I'd be inclined to think that Rockstar would take the lowered purchase price into account when selling the vehicle. But that's a hunch on my part."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dwcnt,Psychko,2,Mon Jul 20 03:20:03 2015 UTC,"Just bought a Kuruma, sells for 60% of the discounted price as of now, so we'll see."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dwcnt,DyLaNzZpRo,2,Mon Jul 20 04:41:37 2015 UTC,I would assume Rockstar has made the vehicles bought with a discount sell for less.

If you're buying it purely for racing, the Osiris doesn't slide out anywhere near as much, but the T20 can turn a lot quicker if you can handle it, whereas the Osiris tends to understeer, the Zentorno is well, IMO horrible looking, and handles a little ""floaty"", but it DOES compete."

GrandTheftAutoV,3dwb06,Psycholemons,-2,Mon Jul 20 02:01:18 2015 UTC,Adder? What happened to adder? I thought it was 250. Which is faster than zentorno
GrandTheftAutoV,3dwb06,intellectuals95,6,Mon Jul 20 03:14:44 2015 UTC,"I think the Adder still has the highest top speed, might be the T20 now, I'm not too sure, but the handling isn't what it could be. It would be better if it had a spoiler to add traction. It should have an automatic one like the T20 has, but doesn't for some reason. But in a racing situation, the Adder is not the best because of it's poor handling."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dwb06,tdogg15,3,Mon Jul 20 03:35:54 2015 UTC,Its just not a competitive car anymore. It can't turn well and doesn't have a spoiler (which does affect it's handling)

You try to use the report option, you get lagged out to the point you need to get up and restart your ps3 manually. That last part has nothing to do with police. I've noticed that there is an actual host and basically host migration just isn't up to par. But the biggest mistake was cranking up the strength on these police. The response times are a joke and they just end up spawning with each other wherever they are. I've watched one cop enter a stairway and then 4 cops come out of the stairway onto the roof. If you take off from said scenario and run to another part of the map, gameplay stays relatively smooth. But if you try to stay and fight for an hour long blood feud, you're never going to be able to get fairplay. The police have other players with different internet speed lagging all over the map so you only see them once every ten feet on their way to you. And by that time you've been gunned down by the magical never ending police force. I battle with myself every day not to snap the damn disc in half and go pc.

Do you have any idea how tedious it is find, replicate and test bugs and stuff like this? Over and over and over untill R* is convinced and guaranteed that it won't happen again? It's not worth it. It really isn't. I think you'd rather walk the extra foot, than wait for weeks (potentially months) to get one minor bug fixed? Why do you think developers don't announce beforehand (with the exception of Slightly Mad Studios) what and when they're going to fix next. I look at things like this from the developers point of view. Not from a lazy gamers point of view. There was a fantastic thread/post about how long coding actually takes to fix 1 minor bug not too long ago. If I find it, I'll send it to you. If only you knew a little more... On top of that, they have to get every single update, hotfix, item, change validated by Sony and Microsoft (no idea for PC)? Which can also take weeks (and again, potentially months). If you really are as grown up as you indirectly claim to be, then you can set priorities from one and another. This, my friend, is not one of them."

However that never did and never will make me take an anti-consumer stance. People pointing out things that suck about the product can be valuable feedback, as long as it's not abusive I'll say complain away. If nothing else it gets stuck into the bug tracker.

But, my point was earlier, it's not worth for the consumer nor the developer to get this sorted fixed. This happens what, 2 out of the 10 times? Besides, R* would have to find out why the car spawns up there, find out what's ""wrong"" in the coding and ""fix"" so the vehicle doesn't spawn at higher altitudes. I'm not sure, but on top of that, I think they have to find and ""fix"" every single spawn point on the map that's anywhere near a road where it's remotely possible for the vehiflento spawn above you somewhere.

GrandTheftAutoV,3dupwi,Air_Puffed_Sugar,5,Sun Jul 19 19:15:44 2015 UTC,"(Expanding it further) While on a 5 star level, after a few minutes, a circle could appear (like the ones for gang attacks) and as long as you don't leave the area and don't lose the wanted level:   if you kill enough cops/noose, long enough, soldiers on Mesas and Barracks show up in swarms, ala survival, bearing MG and Carabines. keep going, and a few MG shooting Buzzards, some SUV Insurgents arrive. Maybe they toss grenades as well, besides MG fire. keep going, and a Valkyrie hovers for a few minutes, and the Buzzards switch to Rockets. Ground soldiers attack in bigger numbers. keep going, and Lazer jets start doing frequent passes with their MG. A second Valkyrie joins to attack you. The turret carrying PickUp Insurgents start showing up, trying to gang up on you. keep going, and half a dozen Cargobobs fly by. Each of them deploys 9 parachuting soldiers, each enabled to shoot RPGs to you if they land alive. A couple Cargobobs are also carrying Tanks, and will try to release them at the nearest suitable spot. Regular soldiers now trying to zerg-rush you. if the tanks and everything else didn't get you, a couple nasty Savages and or Hydras arrive as your ""final bosses""   I think it would be a fun 30-45 minutes where you choose and plan where to make your stand, unlike Survivals.   Perhaps getting some fat RP reward if survived.   Maybe getting a friend or Crew member to perform the extraction afterwards and to help lose the wanted level.  I think I've just had too much caffeine."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dupwi,ze_ex_21,-4,Mon Jul 20 01:50:22 2015 UTC,"Right, and then just let someone kill the gunner and the driver, call Lester, and then they steal it for themselves to use, thus bypassing the $1.3 million price tag.   No."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dupwi,TheAsianTroll,9,Sun Jul 19 18:32:34 2015 UTC,They could just be in-accessible. This would solve your problem. I think there should be ones with and without the gun. This would be awesome to see. However I think it should be after having 5 stars for 5 minutes which would make sense as the state police panic and call for the military from Zancudo to come help or something along those lines.
GrandTheftAutoV,3dupwi,Adam123ABC,-6,Sun Jul 19 19:53:11 2015 UTC,"It's still not a good idea to allow players to obtain one of the more OP vehicles in the game for free, and with minimal effort. You can't just blow the Insurgent Pickup up, as it takes 5 explosives minimum to take out, and shooting someone out of it is unlikely because getting the driver means the gunner will just kill everyone who gets near and killing the gunner just means the driver will go to pick them up.   The MG on the Insurgent take 3 shots to kill someone, and it fires at the same rate as the AK assault rifle. Do you really want the level 13 squeaker in the lobby and his buddy to run around with one of those? At least if its a Pegasus vehicle, they had to pay for it first."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dupwi,TheAsianTroll,7,Sun Jul 19 19:58:38 2015 UTC,"Did you not read? I said nobody would be able to enter it, therefore voiding your entire argument here. Also I do not think it should be the gunner version as AI aim is OP, especially on a two hit kill auto gun."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dupwi,Adam123ABC,4,Sun Jul 19 23:03:34 2015 UTC,"You can still get a Lazer for 5K without literally any problems. To get an Insurgent you'd need to cause havoc, which could be pretty dangerous. Also, 1.3M isn't that much these days."

GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,alvik,80,Sat Jul 18 18:43:29 2015 UTC,"If they get their shit together with online and connectivity issues then maybe right up until the next one comes out.  That said, GTA IV seemed to fade away after 4-5 years for me."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,TotallyNotACop2,42,Sat Jul 18 17:04:31 2015 UTC,"GTA IV seemed to fade away after 4-5 years for me.    That's a pretty damn long lifespan for the simpler multiplayer in that game. 5 years from IV's release, we were very close to having GTA V come out."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,TheAdmiester,14,Sat Jul 18 18:16:43 2015 UTC,Yeah I definitely got a lot out of that game. Must've played the story (also TLAD and TBOGT) at least 50 times.   Party mode with a couple of friends was also really fun.
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,TotallyNotACop2,3,Sat Jul 18 19:43:39 2015 UTC,"I could play GTA V for as long as I played GTA IV honestly. For some reason despite the gameplay being mostly the same, it's always fun for me to just hop on with one of my buddies and just have fun. Yesterday we were playing King of the Hill with disabled auto aim with marksman pistols. Ton of fun."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,TheBSGamer,4,Sun Jul 19 04:07:10 2015 UTC,That game still has a multiplayer presence as well. However it's mostly modders and folks who are very good at piloting the Annihilator though.
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,Techman-,5,Sat Jul 18 20:32:17 2015 UTC,"San Andreas on the other hand is timeless. Don't get me wrong GTA IV is phenomenal, but San Andreas has that perfect 90s LA vibe."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,mooonman,7,Sat Jul 18 20:30:44 2015 UTC,Sadly the game didn't age well for me. I prefer III and Vice city.
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,PvTails,2,Sun Jul 19 03:16:49 2015 UTC,"I think part of the appeal of vice city was knowing every nook and cranny of the map. No doubt we would hate a map that small today, but sinking hundreds of hours into a map that size meant i knew every alley way."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,BfuckinA,3,Sun Jul 19 03:53:55 2015 UTC,It's not the map layout it's more like the theme of the map and time period.  I like III because it revolves around the hitman mafia theme just do the job no questions asked.  GTA Online Reminds me a lot of GTA III And would like to work more for the mafia. If they still exist after events of GTA IV.
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,PvTails,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:01:02 2015 UTC,"Oh don't get me wrong, the entire theme and time period were definitely the best part of vice city. I just think the size of the map adds to that nostalgic factor. I haven't played in almost 10 years, but if i picked it up now i would be just as familiar with it as i used to be. I used to sink hours and hours into that and III well after I finished the story line. Thats what I missed most in IV. Once you beat the story, there was no reason to play that game anymore."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,BfuckinA,6,Sun Jul 19 04:09:01 2015 UTC,"And script kiddies, don't forget the script kiddies. I've been unlucky enough to find one in pretty much every server I've tried to join. I stick to Solo Sessions now."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,IBeAPotato,5,Sat Jul 18 19:58:42 2015 UTC,"Seriously, they need to get their shit together with the server issues. I was playing with two of my friends on the XB1 with no issues last week until my third friend decided to buy the console and GTAV three days ago. We tried to invite him and almost everytime he gets kicked out. All I wanted is some of that heist money, man!"
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,luckygazelle,5,Sat Jul 18 20:06:53 2015 UTC,If they were to redo the whole online concept it would probably last longer. I have already stopped playing online because of horrible it is. Finished the single player. Don't really know what to do now.
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,Gregger90,15,Sat Jul 18 22:00:59 2015 UTC,"I've played GTA Online more than I ever played the multiplayer for GTA IV...

GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,Lord_of_the_Chickens,10,Sat Jul 18 17:23:18 2015 UTC,Until a year after gta 6 comes out
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,RockstarGTA6,5,Sat Jul 18 17:57:42 2015 UTC,"I'm waiting for the inevitable map addition. I betting that they will combine a new story branch along with an added on map as well. Like maybe an all new character or an original character (Lamar?) traveling to the new map and continuing their story from there. It could work great for online too. Just go to the airport, and walk to the icon and getting an interactive loading screen of your character boarding a plane and a short scene of your character sitting there in first person, so you can look around out the window and such. Then you land in the new area and spawn into a brand new lobby at the airport, and continue on doing new jobs there. It would be even better if the new area was an HD remake of vice city or las venturas. So many amazing options for this game, I'm really looking forward to later this year and next year."

GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,Jesoph,3,Sat Jul 18 20:25:38 2015 UTC,Why do you think they delayed? My guess is a simultaneous release across all platforms (waiting for Xbox PS4 and PC versions to launch) but you would think they would've known when those versions would release.
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,SEAN771177,2,Sat Jul 18 20:31:43 2015 UTC,Heists

GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,SEAN771177,0,Sun Jul 19 00:16:31 2015 UTC,"I haven't played many Story Mode games in my life (Turning 18 soon) except for GTA IV. I have played more of those kinds of games in the last 3-4 years but mostly I've played sports games and you don't get nostalgia from FIFA games really.  I can't even imagine me playing GTA V in like 20 years and thinking ""yoo.. i remember this"". It feels impossible to think that I'll feel nostalgic playing this.  Insanely hard to express what I mean :("
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,Lyktan,5,Sat Jul 18 19:59:24 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe R* felt that people wanted more out of GTA 4 (I did) and decided to stick all that stuff into GTA V/Online"
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,jamiepayne5,5,Sun Jul 19 21:41:05 2015 UTC,"GTA is a strange game to put a life span on, because it never really ends, at least not for me.   I was still playing GTA 4 this past winter, granted only for like 30 minutes to an hour, but I still played it to screw around in.   Hell, I played GTA SA for a bit a few months ago just to fly around the map and try to survive the low draw distance lol.   The same will happen to GTA V, I'll still pop it in and play it for a few hours here and there when I'm bored and I just want to blow crap up.  However, as far as me actually ""playing"" the game, like story missions and multiplayer modes, well I've already moved on from GTA V for the most part (especially right now, since the PC version's stuttering is out of control thanks to the latest patch)."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,TKoMEaP,34,Sat Jul 18 16:57:34 2015 UTC,"I am gonna piss off some people but I wish they would drop support of X360 and PS3 so X1,PS4 and PC can get better updates."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,HURT_BALLS,12,Sat Jul 18 19:49:23 2015 UTC,I've been saying that about pretty much every new game coming out that still supports the 360/PS3. They're over nine years old. That's absurd.  The last generation is over. It's time to move forward.

GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,ASK_ME_IF_IM_A_TRUCK,3,Sun Jul 19 13:47:41 2015 UTC,Dude. The whole reason I even bought an xbox was because GTA4 was coming out. That's it. I can't wait no damn 6 mo. - 1 year for a PC port. Fuck that. So I bought the cheap one. That's really the only reason. lol!   And you didn't tell me about the truck thing. Am I talking to a truck right now?
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,Josefus,2,Sun Jul 19 14:23:45 2015 UTC,Feel old time - 360/ps3 are older than some of the kids that play on them.

GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,SEAN771177,5,Sun Jul 19 01:36:55 2015 UTC,that would give me the incentive to finally upgrade
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,StarBoy1701,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:08:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I honestly agree. When I think about the amount of QA and troubleshooting it must take to support something like GTA Online on 5 different platforms it makes me wonder how they have time to release anything."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,DeceitFive9,-1,Sat Jul 18 18:55:02 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. X1 and PS4 has been out for almost 2 years now.. I do realize dropping $300-400 bucks at once on a Gaming Console is a good chunk of money but it isn't that bad if you save up for a month or two(I have bills too!) or trade in your old shit to lessen the cost of the new console. I see PS4's and X1's in pawnshops for ~$280.  R* is spending time and manpower giving updates to older consoles that would be better spent focusing on the new ones.   edit: And lets be honest, GTA V plays and looks a lot better on the new-generation consoles."

As it is right now, by level 120 you pretty much have everything. I got to that point a couple of months after buying the game and now - another couple of months down the line - I've barely progressed any further; there's just no incentive to continue leveling. If there were more guns, cars, clothes and stuff to unlock beyond level 120, I feel I'd be playing the game a lot more. It's fun to go on and mess around, maybe do a job or two, but I think GTA Online could do with more progression to keep players playing."

I 100% the story mode, got everything I wanted in online and over rank 150, completed all the heists and just don't see myself playing it that much anymore. I log on the odd time when a new update comes out, but even that's for a few hours and I go back off. Just don't feel that 'spark' I felt with GTA V before. Still like the game and visiting this sub, but I don't see myself coming back for more than a day unless they add something like heists content - wise."

It will last until the next GTA or there is another company that makes a better game that also supports mods.  Of course that is just for PC, for consoles, it depends if modders will eventually break through on current gen consoles, if that happens why play a game Rockstar was too meager when it came to online, which then in turn seems they spend all the effort for fluff for online to hide that, which then brings to light the horizon for the SP portion with no DLC in sight, in favor of some predatory tactics with shark cards."

I'm honestly kind of getting tired of GTA V faster than GTA IV, considering I still haven't really gotten tired of IV, and could easily see myself replaying the story again, yet I'd definitely be hard pressed to play the story of V again even though I've only played through it like three times."

GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,plusroy,0,Sat Jul 18 21:22:25 2015 UTC,"Rockstar did GTA V right and its going to be around for a while. They're one of the first games to give you ""free"" DLC. Every update comes with no new cost like on previous games, but you need to question, ""how does rockstar make their money then?"" Quick answer, how many people bought GTA V on previous gen? I know I did. Then what did I do 3 months later? Traded that in for almost no money back and bought the new one. So rockstar double dipped on GTA V. They timed their release with the release of new gen and knew that they had the best product out there and could get people to buy it twice. Thats $120 (US) per person and they sold how many millions of copies of each? They can sit back and milk GTA V for another few years before they even have to start developing another one. Awesome move on Rockstar's part financially, but the consumers are either blind or just dont care."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,theseventhcavalry,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:40:41 2015 UTC,"Their DLC doesn't really give you anything free, it adds stuff for you to buy. They know that people will be excited about the awesome new car and want it badly. People who don't have enough in hand money will just buy those overpriced shark cards, which is pure profit for Rock$tar."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,The-Irish-Potato,2,Sat Jul 18 22:12:58 2015 UTC,"Free as in I don't have to spend my real money on it. Obviously you can but ultimately thats your choice. Im making the comparison to games that force you to spend your  real money in order to obtain new upgrades, maps, etc. Rockstar gives you this stuff as part of the updates but they can do so because youve spent $120 on the game in the first place."

GrandTheftAutoV,3dqzel,Aodhyn,-3,Sat Jul 18 18:04:42 2015 UTC,"Uhm. No. You have no fucking clue what you're talking about. Millions may play it per month, not as we speak. If they had millions playing right now that would make GTA the largest game in the world second only to League of Legends.  This sub is in denial, we get maybe one or two popular posts per week these days, going from several 2-3k+ points per day. If you think the game isn't dying down rapidly you're a special kind of stupid."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,kidkolumbo,35,Sat Jul 18 15:39:10 2015 UTC,Not even during the weekenders when they were on higher rotation?
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,DustyKnackers,12,Sat Jul 18 15:41:13 2015 UTC,"I don't play during the weekends often, mostly during the week."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,elvnsword,8,Sat Jul 18 15:43:29 2015 UTC,Wait... What?!   There is a higher rotation/spawn chance on the weekends for these events?   WTF...
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,DustyKnackers,5,Sat Jul 18 17:33:45 2015 UTC,"Yup, usually these lobby events only happen once per in-game day I believe, but during event weekends when there are special items in crate drops, the spawn rate for all lobby activities is increased."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,elvnsword,4,Sat Jul 18 17:36:34 2015 UTC,"Huh, kinda blows for people like me stuck at work on Friday/Saturday..."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,geophsmith,10,Sat Jul 18 17:50:12 2015 UTC,It's not every weekend. Only EVENT Weekends.
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,IBeAPotato,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:29:03 2015 UTC,Does it include solo sessions and private lobbies?
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,DustyKnackers,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:03:08 2015 UTC,"Solos sessions, no. Private lobbies, I'm not sure. I know public sessions need at least 4 players to spawn these events."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,PlaidWaffles,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:44:49 2015 UTC,"On 4th of July weekend, spent tons of time grinding smuggler aircraft that seemed to spawn every 15 minutes. Was alone in an invite only."

GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,tking191919,8,Sat Jul 18 16:31:30 2015 UTC,I'm willing to bet it's a glitch and not intentional.
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,Clarkey101,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:39:52 2015 UTC,"But if it's a glitch, why would it work so perfectly during event weekends?  I really think Rockstar, to whatever degree, is making it as hard as they can for us to earn money.  Not that I even hate Rockstar.. They could do some things differently but it is what it is."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,123noodle,2,Sun Jul 19 08:30:06 2015 UTC,"I earned $1,500,000 since Friday from about 6 hours of gameplay. It is ridiculously easy to earn money."

GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,Bounkass,0,Sun Jul 19 10:24:54 2015 UTC,There's no way they intentionally took them out. It's such a small amount of money that they really don't have a reason to.
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,workalex,6,Sat Jul 18 22:01:57 2015 UTC,"I've seen a few lately. I hate that they sometimes spawn with such bad timing, while I'm speeding by, and then I have to backtrack and hurry to catch up to it because I know they despawn way too quickly.  I will say this, I haven't had a Lester assassination in a while. I've had the target vehicles (planes, RVs, cars) but Lester's ""KILL TARGET"" mini prompts have been rare. Which is a real shame, as those were pretty good money."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,workalex,15,Sat Jul 18 18:08:59 2015 UTC,There's a bug for current-gen where they infinitely spawn in a solo session. Go to /t/gtaglitches to find it. Not sure if it'll work for last-gen though.  Edit: Exploit. Not bug.
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,ALPB11,5,Sat Jul 18 16:28:00 2015 UTC,"On 360, haven't seen a plane or distract the cops for lester or anything for at least a week now, and i usually play invite only, solo, or crew sessions."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,cj832,3,Sat Jul 18 16:49:18 2015 UTC,"distract the cops for lester   I forgot that was a thing.  I got the initial phone call, but was never asked."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,Bounkass,3,Sat Jul 18 17:11:36 2015 UTC,"I don't even think there's phone calls for it anymore, just a little message in the top left corner and an area marked purple on the map.. Half the time I don't even realize it's happening then I see the purple and drive over and there's only like 30 seconds left."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,cj832,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:14:22 2015 UTC,"I figured, all other events wsa one call then the marker, but I don't get the purple either."

GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,_BIRDLEGS,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:15:49 2015 UTC,Something like this would happen randomly in invite only sessions back on the 360. I have no idea what triggered it but once and a while trucks would just spawn for hours
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,_BIRDLEGS,0,Sat Jul 18 21:29:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I realized that too back on the PS3. Weird, but a good cash cow."

GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,_BIRDLEGS,0,Sun Jul 19 01:03:28 2015 UTC,The more you kill the more they are worth. I'm currently at the maximum of $30.000. Easy money with the exploit.
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,Lint6,5,Sun Jul 19 08:31:14 2015 UTC,"Is it true that the seemingly useless Job Points (JP) contribute to spawning armored cars, crates, random events in freemode more often?"
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,_BIRDLEGS,4,Sat Jul 18 19:16:35 2015 UTC,"I thought so, but was heavily shot down the last time I mentioned it.  Either way, afaik it hasn't been confirmed nor denied by R*"
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,Lint6,2,Sat Jul 18 19:24:28 2015 UTC,"There is an alarming number of downvote spamming trolls and general idiots in the GTA subs and in the game itself. I think you are right, the points go down if you stay in a free mode lobby so theyre probably doing something, and thats the most logical explanation. So I'd just build up those points, do a couple quick missions or jobs and maybe that stuff will spawn more often?"
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,_BIRDLEGS,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:08:08 2015 UTC,"No, its not true.  JP has to do with playlists.  The higher your JP at the end of the playlist, the better your position is."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,TaintedLion,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:18:53 2015 UTC,Hm if thats the case its strange that they go down slowly in Free mode
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,SauronTheDestroyer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:35:21 2015 UTC,They don't.  They disappear completely when you go to a new session
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,IBeAPotato,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:29:17 2015 UTC,"I knew that, but if you stay in a session, they go down by 3-5 points every so often never noticed if it was when something happened though or not"
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqsg1,charham89,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:56:21 2015 UTC,Really?  Been playing since it launched on PS3 and I've never noticed they steadily go down

You're far better off trying out a few different muscle cars and driving the one that suits you best.   Watch this video from Broughy1322 where he tests the various muscle cars fully upgraded, his videos are always very informative. According to his tests, the three fastest are the Dominator, Dukes and Blade - oh, the Blackfin came in 4th or 5th fastest in his DLC testing too."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dtnyp,Psychko,5,Sun Jul 19 10:30:05 2015 UTC,"The Muscle class is pretty competitive, You'd do well with either a Dominator, Dukes, Blade, Blackfin and possibly the Ruiner if you're decent."

GrandTheftAutoV,3dtnyp,adsadsadsadsads,2,Sun Jul 19 17:48:00 2015 UTC,I'd say the Buffalo (S) but unfortunately the game considers it a sports car although the Dodge Charger it's based on is clearly a muscle car.
GrandTheftAutoV,3dtnyp,Preyker,3,Sun Jul 19 12:39:24 2015 UTC,Yea I think they didn't want 4 doors in the muscle class. I can see where they are comming from though.

GrandTheftAutoV,3dqv5r,luk3d,4,Sat Jul 18 18:26:29 2015 UTC,It felt the same during the heist. I'd just get a different plane if you want more than 4 seats.
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqv5r,dalllll,3,Sat Jul 18 18:51:11 2015 UTC,"Velum 5-Seater Introduced in the Heists Update, a Velum with additional features was released, with extra seats and a rear functional door. The rear interior was also glamoured up with leather seats, similar to the Luxor. The 5 Seater retains the original performance and capabilities, but can hold more people, and can provide easier access for players.  The 5-Seater was introduced for The Prison Break, as the 4 players and Rashkovsky would not fit in the original Velum, as it would only sit 4 people. During the heist, it is required to pick up the ground team and Rashkovsky and escort the latter out of the country. Rashkovsky takes the plane out of the country after he gains control after the team parachute out.   From GTA wiki"
GrandTheftAutoV,3dqv5r,luk3d,3,Sat Jul 18 18:53:31 2015 UTC,Except all 5 seats were never really used. One guy was in the Buzzard to pick the group up after parachuting.

GrandTheftAutoV,3dmsyh,coscorrodrift,2,Fri Jul 17 22:16:37 2015 UTC,"They're cheap. In every possible way. And that's a wonderful thing because you'll actually try many things if your not scared of your bike or having to work to pay off payments. They're ugly. ""Oh no! I grabbed too much front brake and crashed my Ducati! Now it's ugly until I spend a lot of money!"" KLR's come from the factory ugly. Crash em? Still ugly. Again, less fucks given, more time riding (to note, newer ones do look much better, but no one buys a KLR to get laid). They are bulletproof. What bike does the US Military use in the field? KLR. It's relatively easy to repair and parts are cheap because... They've been around forever. Easy to find cheap old ones and newer expensive ones. The range of used KLRs is a wonderful thing, as you can spend as much (or as little) money as you want and get one. Finally, the real reason. They can do everything decently. Sure, they're heavy and slow, but they move quickly enough to do some twisties. They'll take highways better than your DRZ, while soaking up the dirt much better than the touring bikes. You can weld some ammo cans to the side for panniers, or do the other KLR thing and get milk crates. They'll get you from point A to point B with a minimal of cost and fuss regardless of where point A and B are.   And that's why everyone should own one (or something similar) at least once."

GrandTheftAutoV,3dmsyh,BassheadPanda,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:27:38 2015 UTC,For an 18 year old male? hahahaha
GrandTheftAutoV,3dmsyh,Guitarknowitall,3,Fri Jul 17 19:33:05 2015 UTC,"If you're an 18-year-old male, then it will be high regardless, correct?"
GrandTheftAutoV,3dmsyh,BassheadPanda,3,Fri Jul 17 22:27:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is my point."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dmsyh,Guitarknowitall,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:35:16 2015 UTC,"Insurance isn't that bad depending on the bike you get.  If you get a 1000cc sport bike, yea it will be high.  If you get something that is classed as a tour bike, the insurance is so stupidly cheap.  My first bike was a 600cc sport bike, but for whatever reason it was classed as a sport tourer, so I got great rates.  Now if you're young and have some points on your license, you'll pay regardless."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dmsyh,HONEST_MEOWING_CAT,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:37:46 2015 UTC,"Depends on the bike you get. If you buy a super sport, you're a looking at around 140. I was gonna buy a GSXR 600, and it woulda been 126/mo with a clean driving record. I instead got a SV650s, but because it's classified as a standard, insurance is $51/mo.   And older bikes usually have lower rates. So getting a 2001 instead of a 2014 would save you a good amount."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dmsyh,Vhu,8,Fri Jul 17 19:40:06 2015 UTC,"i wish lane splitting were legal all over the country.. kind of surprising the most restrictive state in the union allows it, but NONE of the other states do."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dmsyh,shifty4321,3,Fri Jul 17 20:39:22 2015 UTC,"It's the one thing I hold on to, dearly.  I just wish they'd display on the electronic signs all over the freeway that it was legal.  I've lost count of the times cars have deliberately swerved to try to impede / hit me for ""cutting""."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dmsyh,HONEST_MEOWING_CAT,2,Fri Jul 17 19:51:20 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, drive with go pro running, and send the attempted murder evidence to the police."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dmsyh,shifty4321,2,Fri Jul 17 20:03:25 2015 UTC,"I've been running onboard cameras before GoPro was even a thing :)  I would be in court for the rest of my life if I did that for everyone.  Never made contact with me.  If I had been hit, that'd be a different story."

GrandTheftAutoV,3dmsyh,musefanpl,7,Sat Jul 18 01:39:32 2015 UTC,The attention to detail in this game is amazing.
GrandTheftAutoV,3dmsyh,SnowDog75,4,Fri Jul 17 20:44:11 2015 UTC,I've been playing GTA V since it came out and I still thought this was real for the first 2 seconds until I noticed the radar/HUD.

GrandTheftAutoV,3dsasn,turnoffthenews,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:28:17 2015 UTC,"Man, you gotta learn how to use the Rockstar Editor. There's a whole filter called ""Morpheus"" that emulates the greenish look of the Matrix movies. Plus you wouldn't have to do this digital zoom stuff.  Still, funny stuff! I enjoyed it."
GrandTheftAutoV,3dsasn,KebJeb,2,Sun Jul 19 04:49:53 2015 UTC,"Id love to use the editor, but i don't have a PC. Im on PS4. Waiting for rockstar to release it on the editor. If not, yeah def I would've made this better. Glad you liked it and thanks for the tip. Ill try it when the editor comes out"
