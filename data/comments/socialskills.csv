Saying ""How do I get in touch with you"" takes some of the pressure off because it's less direct and gives the person some options."
socialskills,3e257d,627534,9,Tue Jul 21 16:21:40 2015 UTC,Find a way to naturally flow it into whatever you're talking about if you feel weird about straight up asking.  Are you talking about a class you two share? Suggest studying and ask for their number to text for details.  Have you been talking about an interest you both have? Say you want to hit them up sometime to engage in that interest with them.

It's all to do with body language, facial expression, the rhythm in the conversation etc. Like if you do it totally out of the flow of the conversation with a straight face with strange pose, it can be weird. But this is not something to obsess about. If a person is like that, they are like that. You can never be sure how you come across. The less you care, the better it may get (no guarantees though)."

You think that they don't want to talk to you by default, so you must somehow demonstrate submission so they will throw you this bone. That's totally wrong.

socialskills,3dye4b,Smokratez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:05:39 2015 UTC,"Interesting point of view. But it's important to see that most of the advice on this list is not intended to be taken like dogma or hard rules. They are like chewing gum: you chew it take the taste and then spit it out. They are part of a journey. It's not like ""now I know this, things will be fine"". There is no recipe for happiness. And realizing that there is no recipe for happiness is also not a recipe for happiness.  In many areas of life when you try too hard, you fail. But just not-trying doesn't guarantee success, it can even lead to a worse failure. The whole point is to give up the compulsive need for guarantees. To let things flow. Give way to spontaneity.  It's very related to being attractive as a man (I don't know much of the female perspective). If you try hard, you seem desperate. Playing hard-to-get, playing being aloof is part of it. But ideally you don't play it. Instead of having to play hard-to-get you are genuinely busy with things. Instead of seeming like being respected, just be respected. But that's not in your immediate control. You can't make people love/respect you. But it still depends on your actions.  It's easy to control mechanical things, like putting a framed picture up the wall. It will stay there. It's dependable. But dealing with humans is a different game. Sure they/we are just as much a part of the world as the picture on the wall, but they have processes that are very similar to your own thinking. So when dealing with people, it's best to [[[[]]]]. No recipe."

It's like an animal finding new food sources. It can't induce this by itself. It needs to actually find new food in places that it didn't expect. If it already expected to find it, it's not a new finding.  There is no recipe in the same sense as there is no algorithm for the halting problem in computer science.  I should say: if there is a recipe, then learning the recipe makes you happy already. Since following the recipe is now a mechanical thing with known outcomes. So this would mean the recipe is to learn the recipe. The whole discussion always gets this self-referential. That's why you just let things be and be aware and go about business.

It may even be counterproductive to obsess over understanding and putting things to words. But you know, humans talk, language is part of our nature. So I babble sometimes.

Those kind of aphorisms don't take into account the possibility that other people will violate the rules.  Like the idea ""Just be awesome to everyone and your life will be great!"" which doesn't account for the fact that life is filled with people that take advantage of others and screw people over for their own ends. But apparently you're supposed to be nice to them anyhow as they're actively screwing you over.   Real life isn't that simple. A lot of the time it's about picking your battles, knowing when to call something a loss and move on, and dealing with disappointment and failure because it's impossible to live a life without some level of suffering.   Some of these are right, but some are just dumb. Most of them should more be ""Don't let social approval be your number one priority, but don't make it not a priority at all.

It's a basic economic principal because not all things are as useful for all people.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage  Like if I have two hats and you have two pairs of sunglasses, you can't use two hats or two pairs of sunglasses at once so if you make a trade so you both have one of each, you can wear a hat and sunglasses at the same time to protect yourself from the sun so there's an advantage to both parties.  You shouldn't ALWAYS ""fight for your dreams"". You should if it's reasonably possible and you're not hoping for miracles. When your own agency is a deciding factor in whether or not it's achievable. You need to know when something is a lost cause and you're better off using your time in something else. Or else knowing when to ""change strategies"". Thinking totally in ideals and not compromising isn't mature.  Same with trying to get a girl you think is ""impossible to get"". If you ask someone out and they're not interested, then invest your time in finding someone else rather than trying to get the attention of someone not interested in you. Valuing yourself and your time not feeling worthless from rejection.

We are not happy all the time and life isn't good all the time and if we have to act like it all were or if anything negative in our life were a ""challenge"" we just need to overcome we will become pretty lonely behind our happy facades.  The ""limiting beliefs"" thing is also extremely frustrating when seeking help. You gain nothing if you seek help and you have to explain endlessly why your problem exists and is not just a belief (which makes you come off as complainer, see above)  I also think a lot of our loneliness comes from not acknowledging negative things in life.You are not supposed to talk or even think about your poverty without making a grand plan how to get out of it. Sometimes the great plan doesn't exist and sometimes a person is too exhausted or sometimes there is simply no way out. Then that person will feel like the only one in the world who is such a loser and will talk to no one about how he really feels in order to not be a ""complainer"". I think in fact the self help movement with all its motivational talk and positive thinking has forced us to put on a permanent mask and made us unhappier instead of happier."

socialskills,3dye4b,joelthelion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:00:29 2015 UTC,"You need to understand that most of the Buddhist and Eastern kind of advice here is not like a fool-proof ""you need to do this and then something will happen"". They are not recipes. They are things that can shake you up, make you see and click with a new mentality, realize things on your own.  All teaching is provisional and context-dependent. Someone may be in a situation where he/she needs to hear the opposite of what is said here.  Some people need to be told that you are able to have control, don't give up, things matter. Some people may be too caught up in trying to control that they end up ineffective and crippled by it. They need to be told to let go of control.  For every person who has some problem, another may have the opposite problem. So then the second kind of people will be angry at the advice given for the first kind. These are not hard, dogmatic things.  Look at the advice, immerse yourself in it and see where it gets you. See if it pops some insight in you. Maybe the insight will be that you disagree. Everyone (including the wise people) are our peers as humans. They don't have any special thing that is unattainable to you. We are a whirlpool in this universe. What you see and experience is valid. Reality/nature doesn't ""care"" if you agree with how it is. It is absurd to congratulate nature (or to get angry at it). Your thoughts and expectations will also affect your outcomes/reality. But the outcomes/reality makes you learn, too. It's a constant back-and-forth dance. But it's all normal and part of it, just like the wind bending the trees and water waving.  One just has to get rid of the crippling deep seated feeling that something may be objectively essentially wrong deep down with the universe that needs immediate correction. This thought pattern is wrong. But striving for improvement is still good. But take it all in a form of dance or musical tune. You don't need to intellectually analyze the rhythm patterns in music to ""get"" the music. The world is a dance. For nothing else than itself. But you can dance sometimes ""as if"". Acting can be fun, too. It's not losing your self, it's just like playing hide-and-seek."

I try to think more about meta stuff like OP described:  remember who I'm talking to, observe how are they feeling and reacting, keep in mind anything I wanted to bring up or get out of the conversation.  Conversation is like riding a bike:  learning consists of entrusting things more and more to your instincts.  The most complex thing I'll try to remember during a conversation is a short list of topics that I prepared beforehand, and I almost never bother with that."

I threw my friend in the algitor pit when he was acting this way and then when out and kidnappe.... no I mean befriended a new one.  Here are some tips to solve your problem:  -Use a whip. You can buy whips for good prices on amazone that works like charm. Not only is it effective at getting your friend to talk to you, but you look badass at the same time.  -You can make him jelous by buying another friend of your's a better cage and throw accid at your new friend. That would make anyone jelous.  -You could try to give him hugs and give him compliments, but that a bit extreme and should only be done under with proffesinal help.  -Give him company. He might get lonly when your gone. You can try a human centipede thing. It's a bit costy at first, but in the long run your best friend will never be alone and you save alot on food.  -Sometimes you need more to mend a friendship than cutting and yelling. Your friend want to feel like you care about them. Try to pull some of his teeth out. I did that once and we became alot closer. You could allso try to drown him and shock him with an elecrick collor. That works like a charm.¨  Ps: Just remember not slit his throat because that get's messy realy fast."

Alternatively, you could try taking an improv class or learning mindfulness techniques -- but no guarantees, all right? It's gonna be a difficult road ahead, but you can change if you have that desire. But first you gotta realize that you're gonna have to put your trust in somebody."
socialskills,3e2exd,strangenchanted,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:42:55 2015 UTC,"It might be hard for you, but with things like this, it really just takes a leap of faith on your part. It just takes trusting that your girlfriend loves and cares for you (and if she turns out to have been manipulating you. Your friends will probably tell you that before you figure it out yourself).   If I might take this a step further for you (and put on my shrink hat). Maybe the issue isn't that you feel that you can't trust them, but that you don't feel like you're worth having a meaningful relationship with? Why should they do anything for you? You don't think you're worth it.  Well, the thing is, you ARE worth it. You are an important person to many people around you, but you just don't realize it yet. But once you see that, it won't be too hard to also see why people do what they do for you. They care about you."
socialskills,3e2exd,AaroniusH,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:23:40 2015 UTC,"I can relate heavily to this. The reason is because i was manipulated heavily by a friend in the past when i was around 16. I became very weary of him and basically saw everything he did as some sort of attempt to manipulate me to do something in some way.  As my eyes were now open to the whole concept of manipulation, i becan seeing it everywhere even in places i previously was oblivious to it. in people who i didnt think about before. i started applying it to everything. So i because very scared of being taken advantage of again like that.   I feel like it was a normal part of the growing phase. Like when you learn a new word and start using it a lot more often the necessary for a week or so before it eventually only crops up where necessary.  So as long as this doesn't last longer than 6 months or so, you are okay. you will eventually learn to apply it where it actually is. be conscious and you will be sooner better."

A video can be funny because you see it and have different expectations.  But if you go tell a friend ""OMG, you have to see it it's so funny"" now they expect something funny to happen.  Then it won't be funny to them because the context of the video is completely different."

socialskills,3e0pet,FatalTragedy,6,Tue Jul 21 01:40:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know how true this is, but my friends consider me to be a flirty type of guy. It's just the way I am, so I'll tell you how I normally converse and hopefully you'll get something out of it.  Now to start off, most of the time I don't ""flirt"" with the intent of asking the girl out. I do it because I find it fun.  Complimenting is a starting point, however I do this very sparingly, and only when it's genuine. You can compliment pretty much anything, however I would stay away from shorts/leggings/pants, unless you really want to make it blatantly obvious that you're checking them out. And you wouldn't say ""I like your leggings."" A better alternative would be ""I like the way you look in those."" Usually you'll always go something like this. ""You look really good in that blouse."" "" l like the way you did your hair."" I really like your eyes/ your eyes are mesmerizing (if you're deeply staring into someone's eyes in a moment of intimacy)"". Remember, keep this few and far between, because it's nice to be complimented once in a while, but if the same person compliments you constantly eventually it'll get old won't mean anything.  Practice winking. Winking can change the tone of something you tell someone and is very subtle if you do it right. Especially if you want to flirt ""low-key"" and not make it obvious to everyone except you and that person. You could say something like ""Wow you're looking really good today (wink)"". It adds just a hint of sexual tension while still being friendly. Again, do thus sparingly because it could quickly lose meaning. Wink responsibly.  If you want to take the above scenario a step further, you could even grab their hand and give them a little spin.  I also like to lightly poke fun at people. It's hard for me to think of a scenario right now but when you do this, you always add a smile and a light laugh. At least I always do. If you know someone just worked out, for example, ""Wow you're stinking up the room"" will be taken offensively if you say it like a fact, rather than with a smile and laughing. This may be obvious, but I'll say it just in case. Don't do this if you know the person will take offense, as different people are very self-concious of different things. You can also add a wink while you're poking fun, however remember to do it sparingly.  One last thing, and possibly the easiest to screw up, is touch. Sitting close to someone is a good starting point, however you can't do this out of the blue. Make sure the person is always comfortable whatever you do. This is a hard area for me to explain as I do it subconciously most of the time. You can also hug. Hug when you greet someone, or say bye to someone. Make these hugs tight and not half-assed if it's someone you're interested in. For me, at least, tighter hugs have more meaning, and make people feel more special and that they mean something to you. This part may sound weird, but if it's someone I'm close to I give a little inhale, just enough to be audible, or let out a little ""mm"". Not a creepy ""mm"" but the kind that let's them know you enjoy hugging them. When you start really getting the hang of touch, you'll know when you can put your arm around someone, give a light push, touch their arm or even their leg, without it being weird. Sometimes I even hold hands with people playfully.  I realize this might not be the type of flirting advice you're looking for as I'm not focusing on actually picking up girls, but hopefully you can nitpick the things you want and it'll help you out."
socialskills,3e0pet,OompaSmash,2,Tue Jul 21 05:46:58 2015 UTC,"The general disclaimer also applies here: different women like different things. I'm pretty sure some of them dislike winking. Of course all that can be pulled off if one is really sociable and can put a bit of irony in everything and just float above these formalities. It all depends on so many things. With almost any action you make some girls interested and some disinterested. If you aren't a natural charmer and flirter and winker, then you don't have to do these things. There are many people who don't do it but still have girlfriends."
socialskills,3e0pet,waterflock,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:56:30 2015 UTC,I really would not feel comfortable with a lot of this. Especially winking. The girls I'm going for are religious girls in my campus ministry. Implying anything sexual is a great way to damage my reputation.

Like I said, just nitpick at the things you want to apply."
socialskills,3e0pet,Zimmerzom,5,Tue Jul 21 20:14:42 2015 UTC,"It sort of comes naturally when you get better at talking to people in general.   Trying to think about things to say to keep the conversation going is more of a problem with conversation skills. Let's try to adress this issue - the goal of conversation is basically transfering messages from one person to another. This might sound obvious and silly but keeping that in mind can help you in the long run.  Bearing that in mind, we can think about what the goal of transfering messages is: Socializing. The creation of bonds between people in society for the purpse of some kind of mutual benefit - Trading goods, trading services, asking advice, sex, fun etc.   So... try to steer conversations towards that. Have fun and achieve your goals by conversing. Obviously I can't cover every scenario in a reddit comment but I can give you the general gist of ""This is what conversation is"", ""This is what it feels like when it succeeds"", ""This is why and how you improve in conversations"". The rest is up to your mentality and ability to analyze a situation and learn."
socialskills,3e0pet,pancakesoul,4,Tue Jul 21 04:54:45 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert in flirting. but i believe being a sincerely, friendly person will get you farther than being a clever, manipulative one. Try just showing interest in their hobbies. e.g.""wow, you like to search for bugs and look at them under a magnifying glass, that's so cool."" and try to get them to talk about their interest more like: ""where is the best place to find cool bugs?"" Really the goal is to get conversation flowing naturely. find common interests."

It's just a word we use to describe playful, enjoyable conversations, subtle touches (not necessarily deliberate or calculated), great eye contact, banter etc.  There is a fine and blurry line between having fun and flirting. It usually happens by itself if you just talk. If you're interested, just let your instincts kick in."

It's just a word we use to describe playful, enjoyable conversations   I have a hard time turning conversations playful. How can I do that? When I just meet someone, the conversation often gets boring fairly quick.   subtle touches   I'm not sure how comfortable I am with that. I've never really touched a girl except to hug her, and I don't hug girls that often either.   great eye contact   What is ""great"" eye contact?

socialskills,3e0pet,effusive_buffoonery,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:55:28 2015 UTC,"Remember that I have no recipe for this. I'm not great at it either. But anytime it happened I was relaxed and didn't particularly intend to do it.   My instincts tell me to run away and hide when talking with a cute girl   Just realize that she's on the same team as you. It's not a competition between men and women. We are peers as humans on this planet. A girl needs these things just as much as a boy. She has her doubts too. There is no final Sorcerer's stone that finally clicks everything in place and gives you magical confidence. We are part of this rocky planet in the middle of nowhere together. If you think she won't like you, then assume she will.   playful   Turning them to playful only happens if you let it. You have to be okay to not turn it that way. It's more like the art of not getting in the way of it.   touches   If not comfortable, then don't, yet. Touches can happen for example when she tells you a funny story, where she ends up in some trivial, small problem, that she playfully plays up, like it's some big thing. Then you can touch for example on the shoulder/upper arm and say something ironically in a fun way like (oh you poor thing that must've been so terrible). It's hard to describe. There can be many such things.  Playful is humor, irony and fun for all. It's exaggerations, giving opportunities for funny comebacks etc. Not that dissimilar from what one does with close friends, just turn the rudeness a bit down and turn the positivity a bit up.   great eye contact   You know, when someone is smiling, their eyes look very different. It's not an empty stare, but you see that they are having fun. The eyes meet and something happens. Now you both know something that only the two of you know. It's private and intimate. I meant that kind of eye contact."

Guys like that are incredibly insecure, and they feel the need to bring people down because they see in others what they would like to have. Don't worry about this guy's put downs reflecting badly on you and influencing others in your circle of friends; if they're mature they will recognize that he's the problem, not you. If it continues to the point where you don't think you can take it, talk to one of your mutual friends first.

Also, realise some people are introverted. so they genuinely need to settle down after a long day with people. they may just want to go home and relax a little in front of the TV with family or something.

Outdoor sports and parks can be great, as can picnics on parks and scenic locations. Or have a movie night with some cooking with friends. These would all work pretty easily for any age, and also if you have to rely on public transport or rides.   Most people, at least when they get older or have a family, have a limited amount of time or energy available. That is justsomething on the background. Even when I go out with my other half to explore a nice city or shopping or other errands or activities, it's just an unrealistic expectation that we'd have 14 hours of unlimited energy that day. Some days I get tired really fast. Some days I have schedules to keep - so even when meeting a friend is fun, I'll still have to be at that other place by the afternoon, or still catch that bus in 20 minutes.

For example, did you only smoke/drink with your friends or did you and you friends hangout during the day and  at night start gettin high or drunk? If you were the latter, then you should be fine with your existing friends because you have enough things in common to hangout with them w/o drugs/alcohol. If you were the first, then you will really have to find new friends because friends are people you have things in common with. If they only like drugs and alcohol, then you wont be able to hangout and not be indirectly pressured into drinkin/smoking.  With finding new friends/social situations that involve meeting new people, there really isn't a real tip I could give you. Just be yourself and try to be more outgoing as your sober-self because you wont be as ""loose"" as drunk-self. (Hopefully that made sense)  sidenote- I was in the same boat during high school.

I understand why you were mad and why you call your friends and yelled at them. To be honest, in the spur of the moment, I might have done the same.  However, you have to realize that it wasn't the best course of action to take. No one likes to be yelled at, and I'm all honesty these people will probably avoid you for a while, if not permanently, unless you do something about it.  Here's what I would do:  Call your friends if you don't see them throughout the day. If you do, just go up to them. Tell them you're sorry for getting pissed and that you lost your cool. However, also reiterate why you were pissed. Tell them it made you feel unwanted when they went somewhere without you even though you had asked them to hang out. Make sure they understand that you truly regret what you did though.  I can't guarantee this will fix your situation. One thing you have to realize though is that everyone makes mistakes, and that doesn't make you a bad person, or a bad friend. You can't stop being friends with someone if they make a mistake, or if you make a mistake yourself. If you really want to make friends you have to take the good and the bad, nothing is ever going to be a smooth ride.  I've been on both ends of this situation. I didn't realize that my friend would be hurt, even though it might be obvious to some people. I realized my mistake after some mutual friends talked to me about it, and I apologized. My friend didn't forgive me right away, but after some time we went back to being great friends, and many good things have come out of that.  I realize this is a long post, but I'll leave you with a phrase one of the best people I know told me, and I've taken it to heart ever since.  Always forgive, because you never know what good can come out of it."

socialskills,3dycou,thoroughaway1234,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:18:12 2015 UTC,"Dude....  That is not how you deal with that situation.    2 better ways:    1) Invite yourself.  After he told you where he was, say ""oh sweet!  Would it be cool if I came by?""  Judge how enthusiastically he answers.  Then bring cool shit with you and be sensitive to the fact that you were not invited.  You are starting at a deficit at the party and you cannot act up.  And you should probably leave early if you're not contributing to the vibe.    2) Ask them what they don't like about you.  Ask them to be brutally honest so you know what you need to work on.  Then go be alone and write and see if you agree with them about what you need to change.  Yall might just have vastly different values and you might just need to go try out other social circles."
socialskills,3dycou,AdriaaaaaaaaaN,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:11:13 2015 UTC,"OP hang in there. What I can advise is to find friends who appreciate and care for you.  A similar thing happened to me when I was 12 (story posted here somewhere), and I learnt to be more independent and not to rely others. Try to find friends who you feel safe around (I recall back in middle school I was afraid of coming to school simply because I had bad friends, worried they were going to make fun of me around people-which they did sometimes).  What I've learnt is to make NEW friends with modest and humble people, they're usually a keeper. I've learnt that social cues/popularity adds jack shit and if anything, people who initially seem more exciting on the outside are usually douchebags (analogy of a Ferrari with no engine-why they are popular/easily get friends), whilst people who are reserved in appearance is like finding a box of treasures, which gleam in opening them. They seem dull, but they are much more interesting and true friends. I've had a similar experience as well back in high school, where I hung out with 'friends' who would make fun of me behind my back. They're not worth trying to get back with. In leaving them, I met some people who were really unpopular and uninteresting, but in knowing them, they turned out to be the most interesting people I've met thus far. you can do it OP! Just ignore those jackasses and put your energy on finding new friends( you can do it by going to clubs/societies you like, and meeting new people with similar interests there!)"
socialskills,3dyzi4,Ragnus,2,Mon Jul 20 17:57:37 2015 UTC,"Based on your history, you like gaming. Find groups on meetup.com that's gaming related, and go meet people.

socialskills,3dyevd,J-Joker,2,Mon Jul 20 15:32:28 2015 UTC,"I have some advice that might be able to help you out. First let me see if I understand you.    You want to have those 2 hour long meaningful conversations on multiple topics and really get connected with that person. Keep the conversation Alive, instead of stale.  You want the conversation to be a two way conversation. You want to be able to get the other person to talk as much as you do! You want the conversation to be a more back.  To be able to talk to anyone and leave the conversation feel that you gave and received value.    Did I understand that correctly?"
socialskills,3dyevd,DaKuY,2,Mon Jul 20 17:54:31 2015 UTC,"That's it, buddy! That's exactly what I'm looking for. Thanks! 😀"
socialskills,3dyevd,DaKuY,8,Mon Jul 20 18:24:47 2015 UTC,"Sweet! You're in for a treat. I had the total opposite problem you had. Everyone would come to me to tell their story and we would be able to talk for hours on end. If you're able to combine the power of questions and stories you'll be able to talk to anyone and and the steering wheel at your fingertips. Before you know it you can command a room and work the floor like a natural. :-)  How do you have a two way meaningful conversation, keep it alive for hours and feel great afterwards? There's always that awkward moment right after you both ""run out of stuff to talk about."" When you're standing there in silence, seconds seem to slowly creep by like hours. You think in you're head, ""Cool cool.. OK ok... [blankness]"" Then comes the even more awkward, ""We'll.. Alright.. Catch ya later.""  Here's 3 simple tips on how to handle this:    Questions are powerful and can determine the quality of your conversations. For example, if I were to ask you,""Hey man, how was your weekend?"" The instant response is ""Good. How about yours?"" What a crappy, quick, lazy, and boring response. Since I can't control what you say, let me ask a different question. ""Hey man, what did you do this weekend?"" The initial thought, ""Hmm.. What did I do this weekend? Oh! I did this and that etc.."" What a totally different response!  Using child like Curiosity strategically builds and strengthens Relationships. When a child is curious what do they do? They aren't afraid to ask questions. They look at the same thing at different angles. Kids ask ""why?"" and they are truly genuinely curious about it, until we tell them to stop because we feel embarrassed that we can't answer the question. Have curiosity like a child, but use it strategically. We don't want it to be a one way conversation. Curiosity is what makes us ask the question in #1. It's also what helps us keep asking more questions. For example, if you told me you just had a bland weekend and just binged watched a new TV series you heard about, I can be curious. Here's some questions you might ask, not all at once, of course: ""What TV series? How did you find out about it? What's the story line? Who's your favorite character? Should I watch it? I'm currently watching XYZ have you heard of it?"" Remember you are asking these questions and being genuinely curious. If you're not then ask about something else you were curious about. ""Did you eat ice cream while watching the TV series? That show reminds me of something I watched last year.""  Lastly, when the conversation starts to go stale, ""go-fish!"" Not the card came! Metaphorically speaking, ""go-fish!"" Say something about yourself, what you did last weekend, what you're working on, what hobbies you have, what you're looking forward to, how you are feeling (happy as can be or terrible), and see if the other person bites the bait.    Summary: Ask quality questions to get quality conversations. Be curious like a child, but not to the point of annoyance. Hehe. Share something about yourself.   These tips helped me have meaningful and life-changing conversations with my friends, my wife, and high level Executives (like the CIO of a $5 billion company). Use it wisely because it's that powerful.   I hope this helped! If you or someone else found this helpful, PM me. I'd love to hear your thoughts and your story if you tried this out! :-)"

socialskills,3dzdv6,darklordoftech,4,Mon Jul 20 19:39:00 2015 UTC,"You're demanding specific responses while providing no background information. Some basic context always helps such as your age, how many people you are trying to invite, what kind of people (work acquaintances, close friends, blind first dates, etc.).    Some examples I can think of living in the DC Metro Area at least:   Nearby rock climbing gym Happy hour at local pub Karaoke bar Renting out a nearby campground in MD (only about 20 min away surprisingly) Hour drive to nearby winery Coffee shop for a casual first date Brunch with endless mimosas Go out to the park for a picnic Daytime visit to the museums in DC Nighttime visit to the various clubs/bars in DC   Mostly it depends on what you like to do."

socialskills,3dw16k,G0VERNMENTCHEESE,11,Mon Jul 20 00:23:24 2015 UTC,"I did this a couple of weeks ago actually. I used to be very talkative when I was younger, but I got depressed a few years back and hardly talked to anyone for about a year. I lost the ability to enunciate my words clearly, which made me feel like I was slurring my words sometimes, adding to my low self-esteem.  I found that reading aloud and exaggerating every syllable helped train my voice to be a little more clear. It was like weight lifting for your vocal chords. I recorded myself a couple of times too, which really helped. Hearing my voice and criticizing it objectively showed me what I needed to work on and gave me a confidence boost.  I was kind of hoping it would improve my ability to think on my feet during conversations, but I didn't see an improvement there."
socialskills,3dw16k,SoquidSnake,3,Mon Jul 20 01:09:25 2015 UTC,"Why have I never tried this!  I went through a long period of isolation for similar reasons. I noticed my ability to speak, string a sentence together and annunciate certain words had gotten significantly worse after a few years."

I'll definitely try this!"
socialskills,3dw16k,FAntagonist,4,Mon Jul 20 18:42:27 2015 UTC,Try talking as if your voice came from your diaphragm. It makes your voice much more resonating and clear.
socialskills,3dw16k,TheCoolGuitarist,3,Mon Jul 20 02:41:15 2015 UTC,"I used to have a stutter as a kid, the two big things that changed that for me were memorising and reciting tongue twisters and tricky poems, along with reading out loud."
socialskills,3dw16k,Shaldivar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:47:08 2015 UTC,"I found my spoken voice has improved from reading stories to my daughter almost every night for the last couple of years.  When I was in primary school one of my teachers would get me to recite poetry at some assemblies because of my memory and how well I spoke out loud. Of course, it was extremely not cool, and I stopped doing it as soon as I changed classes.  Just before my daughter was born my missus recorded me reading a couple of Hairy Mclary books. Listening to the recordings, My speech slow, stuttery and croaky, like I was in special needs class. Within a couple of months my speech had cleared up and flowed like it did back in primary school.   Sorry to prattle on, but yeah I really think reading aloud improves your speech. It's good practice, I guess."
socialskills,3dw16k,castle78,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:16:05 2015 UTC,"Go for it. Reading aloud helps. I love listening to people read aloud. I listen to people reading professional books with their own voices. It helps me a lot. English is not my frist language, so I also get a lot of benefits from hearing different kinds of speech patterns, and of listening to voices in different speeds (I do that also in a bit more pro environment) - bottom line: it helps.   If you have a cat or a dog, you could try reading with them. Pets are great listeners, and it's definitely less stressful to read aloud to your puppy than in front of a crowd of unknown people. Once Team Fido is happy, then it'll be also easier to talk comfortably with other people."

It won't capture the full range, but it's a good proxy for how you sound over the phone or in Skype.

""Hey, we should go to lunch sometime, put your number on my phone""  You then get her phone number, and on a day you are off work, text her to invite her to lunch. Not dinner (too formal/romantic).

However, he can still control the narrative by offering them a more private avenue. Some of my friends will air embarrassing things about me but, if I acknowledge their efforts and ask that they help me with them more privately, many will actually take me up on that offer.  Those who continue to do it in public, however, show that they don't respect my wishes AND may not actually be interested in toughening me up but tearing me down; however, they reveal themselves and stand alone at that point, making them much easier targets.

socialskills,3dvrrb,Swordbow,3,Mon Jul 20 18:50:49 2015 UTC,"They may not actually be real friends if they get off on making you feel embarrassed. You do need to speak up though. I'd go with ""Dude! Seriously, knock it off. That was 5 years ago. I'm over it and I'm really tired of hearing about it. How many times are you planning to keep bringing up old news?"" And then how they respond should tell you whether the friendship is worth anything. If they apologize, realize that it bugs you, and stop doing it, they are real friends. If they tell you you're a big baby and they keep doing it because they think it's funny that you're annoyed, it's time to find new friends."

Remember no one can make you feel inferior without your consent. People like to reminisce about the past, it's only natural.   In the flow of that conversation, its not about whats being said, but how people end up feeling about it. For example, it may have been embarrassing, but embarrassing stories are funny.

If you were a special needs kid she would have told you oh my gosh great job, you're such a good dancer ducks494!  But she knew that you knew that she knew that you knew etc. that you're not a great dancer, so she didn't pretend.  She made a comment that acknowledged the obvious while at the same time giving you a thumbs up and letting you know that what you were doing was reflecting well on you.  Another interpretation is that she noticed that you were making a favorable impression on one of your coworkers."

Everyone likes the guy who dances and encourages others to join in.  Is thinking about this making you feel bad/down?

Most of the time I'd answer with a simple shrug or 'I don't know'. It always lead to silence for awhile.   The way I view it is ""what's up?"" is just another way of asking someone: ""How are you?"", ""How's it been going?"", ""What's on your mind?"", or maybe even ""What is going on with you?"". Find your own definition for it or use one from one posted on here. It should be something that will work best for you.   In my past experience it's been easier to follow how I'm feeling to answer ""What's up?"". Even if it's something really random, it creates a pristine opportunity to communicate with someone.

Maybe your purpose is to get stronger in the gym, write a new chapter in a book, plan a great birthday party for your kid, or break 5,000 karma on Reddit.  Or maybe your entire day is built around enjoying a new episode of a TV show.  Whatever it is, own that shit.  Don't downplay what's important in your life.  Don't assume people aren't interested.  The whole purpose of my day might be to be as lazy as possible without being fired, but when I say, ""Just trying to recover from working my ass off last week, took it easy at work and now I'm going to chill with Netflix.  Gotta give my brain its beauty sleep,"" that's something that 1) really tells the other person what's up in my life and 2) gives them something they can understand and relate to.

I feel like you can do one of two things. Either stick up for yourself more and show them that you won't take any of their shit, or cut them out. I've had friends like this as well. We were good buddies in highschool, and chirped each other all the time as most kids do. But the chirping got worse until it wasn't really chirping anymore, but disrespect. I stuck around for a while, thinking it was my fault that I wasn't cool or witty enough to be around them, and became depressed. It wasn't until I stopped hanging around with them and smoking weed that I realized it wasn't me; they just weren't the sort of people I could be friends with.  I didn't cut them out completely, but I started hanging out with other people slowly at first, then transitioned out of their circle. I still see them from time to time and we have a laugh, but I'm wary of getting too close to them again.  Anyways, what I'm trying to say is it's probably a good idea to branch out a little bit and meet some new people. Trying finding something that makes you happy and go for it, and hopefully you'll meet people you can actually connect with."
socialskills,3dvmil,SoquidSnake,4,Mon Jul 20 01:01:00 2015 UTC,"I had friends like that in high school.  People like that are toxic, and it's a problem with them, not you.  Them saying ""It's just a joke"" just shows that they are completely blind to the way they affect you, and can't be relied on to be empathetic friends.  They are loading you up with a whole fucking pile of incorrect, hateful beliefs, to the point that you are hating yourself.  It doesn't matter why they are doing this.  Maybe they are dealing with their own self loathing, who knows.  I cut those friends out of my life, and I'm glad I did.  I decided that I was out of patience for people who treated me that way.  Whatever their reason, I wanted their presence entirely out of my life.  It was a great decision.  It opened my life up to better, kinder friends, an incredible mentor, and a happy way of living.  You are not worthless or a failure.  That's just a shitty belief someone gave you, because someone else in society gave it to them.  Do yourself a huge favor and give yourself space from people who make you feel bad about yourself."
socialskills,3dvmil,SirDucky,3,Mon Jul 20 03:02:46 2015 UTC,"I want to cut them out but then I'd be all alone.   I find female ""friendship"" terrifying.  Men are friends with people they like and do not want to hurt.  Men expect their friends to be good to them, and if they aren't then they aren't friends.  If a friend betrays you, then they aren't a friend anymore.  When there aren't any true friends around, a man should have no friends, because it is better to have no friends than to have false friends.  Why not live by this credo and be friendless for a while until you find friends who are good to you?"

socialskills,3dwyv9,WonderKnut575,2,Mon Jul 20 05:45:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure with that response. There are either one of two ways you can respond to that. The response you mentioned would work fine only if you're planning on being just college work buddies.   I assume that you like her (you mentioned you find her attractive ;) )so the response you just said seems needy and as if you're putting her up on a pedestal. Additionally, don't say that your friend says a lot about you, it kinda seems stalker-ish(you also want the conversation to be about you and her, not your friend as well)-yes but mention him, but don't talk too much about your friend)  You can perhaps write to her something cheesy (as bad as it sounds, already puts yourself as a guy who's down to earth, as well as a guy who's carefree). Perhaps start off introducing yourself casually 'heyy I'm workknut57, i haven't formally introduced myself before. I heard that we are in the same class?' THEN say something cheesy e.g. 'Are you as interesting as you look?'. She'll be taken aback. Now to her, you're not just some ordinary guy, you're one who's unpredictable and have a sense of humour. I find that most girls respond to this positively. Then go on to talk about life besides work. She'll then know you're not just some boring dude. Finally transition into meeting up to be study buddies, and meet up frequently. Keep on top of your work so that you're more ahead, and she'll look up to you. Flirt while you're at it (if you are interested in her). I assume you know what to do afterwards if you're at that stage.  Like I said, the comment you mentioned is good if you just want a casual college relationship, but if you want to really impress her (as in, being an alpha-possibly future gf)the said option above would be better-and reply to her as if she's one of your friends (be funny). So in essence, if you're going for her, be yourself but WAY MORE CONFIDENT in talking to her."

Learn a few key Chinese phrases such as 'thank you', 'please', how do you do', and 'hello'. It will make a good impression on your Chinese hosts that you have some knowledge about their culture.  Know a little something about the organization that you will be representing, what its goals are during this trip, and what your itinerary will be. This way, when your Chinese hosts ask about your organization, you have something intelligent to say.  When introduced to new people, shake their hands and greet them warmly. Repeat their names so that you will remember them, especially if the pronunciation of foreign names is a bit tricky. Don't be a shy wallflower, but try to engage another person in conversations -- do not spend your time with your face glued to your phone or tablet. Socialize! Introduce yourself and make friends. It's not that hard as long as you open yourself up to new people and new experiences.

Sometimes instead of asking for my number, a friend will ask if I have a snapchat instead (I guess it's easier?) so it lets me talk to ppl even if I don't know their phone number"
socialskills,3dukbk,canancandy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:42:39 2015 UTC,"Snapchat is pretty essential nowadays tbh. It opens a lot of doors socially, and it serves a purpose that's separate from both texting and facebook.   For example, I use it almost daily and it connects me with friends who are hundreds of miles away (home from summer) and keeps both of us current and relevant in each other's life. Like, if you have a crush or friend and they snap you a pic of them in a new restaurant, it's easy to start a convo via text or snapchat. It's helped me make better friends with people I initially barely knew.  And you don't necessarily have to make it a selfie, I snap a lot of my friends random things I encounter. In fact, I rarely selfie because I find myself pretty damn un-photogenic lol"

When they have a problem with a particular task, they may also ask you, in particular, for help.  The biggest sign is when they look into your eyes, smile and shyly look away. They may repeat this behaviour, throughout the day.   They may also watch you carry out a task and either look away or smile, when you look in their direction."

Therefore, those looks that they may give you are the predominant sign in most societies, particularly, all western societies.  Other signs I may add are kindness and generosity.

Flirting is a good sign, and you can build upon the chemistry it creates, but don't assume that it automatically means the person wants to hook up. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.

socialskills,3dtcko,dudewheresmypen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:13:33 2015 UTC,"You're giving too much priority to thinking and not enough to acting and reacting.  Thinking is great, but in an actual interaction, you have to be present for people.  Think of it as dancing:  each beat of the music arrives whether you're ready for it or not.  If you had time to think, maybe you could devise a better move, something more graceful, but the beat is coming NOW and any move correctly timed to the beat of the music is better than any move that is awkwardly timed.  You have to let your habit and instinct carry you.  Thinking about dancing is good for learning new moves, analyzing mistakes (did I really wave my arms around like that? never again!), and identifying things you did right (okay, I remember doing this... does this look good? oh hey it does) but you have to be careful about thinking while you are dancing because it might delay you and put you off the beat.  If you're a programmer or gamer, another way to think about it is keeping up the frame rate in a game.  You might know a really great general purpose algorithm for calculating something, but in a game where you need to maintain a high FPS, you can't use the best, most robust algorithm.  Instead you pick something that runs reliably in the time between frames.  Same thing in conversation:  sometimes you have to let your instincts and habits produce a quick response because if you think, you'll drop frames.  The ""freeze"" you're encountering is your thinking brain screaming ""DON'T DO ANYTHING I GOT THIS"" because it doesn't trust the other parts of you to handle a situation.  It shuts down your habits and instincts because it's scared that they won't handle the situation properly.  Well, they might not, but your thinking brain can't do the job, either.  You have to use the correct cognitive resources for each task."

This man was mocked on social media and had a huge party thrown in his honour. The actor Verne Troyer is far more vulnerable and physically weaker than you are, probably weirder looking all things considered, and he lives a good, even great, life.  My immediate reaction to the story of people being cruel to you, is disgust for them, a desire that they be shamed and punished, and pity for you. I think this would be a widespread reaction, if more people knew about your circumstances. Obviously it is better to be respected and treated with dignity, than either pitied or bullied, however you may have the option here to be pitied instead of being bullied, and that may bring you into circumstances wherein you can build towards being respected, and bring you in contact with people who will treat you with respect.  Does your dyspraxia significantly impact your ability to communicate verbally, and tell stories? I suggest that taking social courses may help you - an acting class, a comedy class, a writing class; circumstances in which you are able to engage with people in a way that gets them past your immediate offputting appearance. Would you consider getting into acting and commercials, where a weird appearance can open doors?

When I was at school, it used to be the other schoolkids doing it. AfterI left, it was the majority of the other locals wherever I was. And tonight, where I live now, I went out for a walk, went into a place where I saw a guy I rcognised, went over to say 'Howdy' and a bouncer pops up like a jack-in-the-box 'I've warned you about disturbing our customers.' To the other guy.  'Sorry, sir, was this man bothering you?' And so on.  OK so I look different.  Guilty.  And I mean facially, not in the way I dress or anything, I'm just T-shirts and trousers, not trying to make a statement or anything.  But ifyou've got a slight deformity everyone always seems to be against you becaues of it and there has to be a way PAST this.  There's gotta be more to life than being banned from places because you look odd.  Sheesh I'm banned from the pier here now and they won't tell me why.  I've got no idea why, I never broke any rules, written or unwritten. Yours repectfully  Chris"

socialskills,3ds0hg,Fucking_Sarcastic,5,Mon Jul 20 07:46:38 2015 UTC,"I'm going to tell you a story that I think may help your particular situation, and then I'm going to link you to a video of a person with a Disability who you are immediately going to like and want to get to know in spite of their disability. So, here we go, grab a chair and scoot in close. This may take a bit.   I work in retail. I have for a long time. I see hundreds of people per week and most, if not all, of them are normal, everyday folks who are important at the time but you never tend to remember when they are not in the immediate vicinity.   Now, there's something you should know about me: I grew up with two disabled parents. I'm not shitting you, both of them had Polio and by some strange coincidence they met and married and had a family and all that weird shit. Being disabled isn't something new to me. Seeing disabled people isn't new either. I am able-bodied or whatever the PC term is. I can't keep track. Moving on.   About two months ago I met a girl at work who had the unfortunate disability of being born without the lower portion of her right arm. It was just gone. The elbow and a weird little baby thumb were there, but the lower portion of the arm was just missing. In a sea of people I will never remember, was this unique girl who I can't seem to forget. I think about her often. (Not in a creepy way, in an inspiring way) Her arm wasn't even the unique part of her though. See, when she walked into the place where I work, she lit up the entire room.   It was like everything in the room was at this strange murmur and when she opened the door and marched to the counter a parade started. She laughed and joked and was gregarious and confident and waving her arms around the entire time. She was so animated that you didn't notice the arm at first. Then you did.   Man, it was incredible. She had this whole aura of confidence that made everyone in the place just want to say hello or find out who this outgoing and friendly girl was, myself included.   Two of my coworkers, bunch of assholes they were, decided to snicker and sneer after she left the counter. She popped by to ask a quick question and heard them talking about her and could have been very upset by the whole exchange. Instead, she laughed it off and began to joke with the two guys about her arm.   It was the strangest fucking thing to hear her actually saying things like ""I'm glad you guys were open, I really needed a hand with my car,"" and my favorite ""Sorry my handwriting is so messy, I was born right-handed and we can all see how that turned out.""   Now, I know what you're thinking, there's going to be some sort of twist and she's now going to be my girlfriend or something, but that's not the case. I've only seen her once since that last interaction and she was just as friendly and cool as the first time. She seems like a neat chick. She doesn't even know that she was inspiring to me.    She taught me a very important lesson. You decide what you are going to convey and how you are going to let people treat you. If you have a disability don't cower under it, embrace it, develop your personality so that you don't get upset with people's ignorance. Having a disability like CP isn't your fault, man. It's not anyone's fault. It's also not anyone's right to ignore the fact that you're a human being despite your condition.   Most people are fucking idiots, man. They don't like anything that's different. Those people suck and you don't want them as friends anyway. The people you want as friends are people who don't give a shit what you look like but instead evaluate you on the person you are inside. The people who inspire you and who you inspire. Even if you don't realize it. They're out there. I promise. You've just gotta keep sifting through until you find them.   Anyhow, I promised you a video, so here it is. This is Derek Weida. He lost a leg due to an AK-47 bullet in Afghanistan. He's a dickbag who does not give a fuck what you think about him. As you can see he is very charismatic despite his disability. He's also the kind of dude who doesn't hide behind his shit.   Watch his videos and try not to like the dude. It's almost impossible.   Anyhow, good luck, and I hope that you find the friendships and relationships that you are looking for."

It's other people who have the problem with them.  I am always willing to talk to others but, just one example, tonight I went out, saw someone I recognised, went to say 'Howdy' and a bouncer popls up 'Is that man bothering you? We've warned him about bothering customers before.  I see what you're up to, Chris...' and I'm thinking 'I wish I knew what I was up to, in your eyes, cos I sure don't!'  And I've just been banned from the Pier here, believe it or not, and I've zero idea why.  They won't tell me, they just say it's private property and they're within their rights not to let me on.  Which is prob. true, but you don't know how NOT do something wrong if nobody tells you what the wrong thing you're doing IS.   It's just I want all this stuff to stop following me around everywhere so I don't spend a whole life on frickin' benefits because nobody gives me a chance to do anything else.

socialskills,3dscy4,TheCoolGuitarist,5,Sun Jul 19 00:08:59 2015 UTC,"Novelty is important. If you text someone daily by just saying ""hey"" with no real follow up besides ""how was your day?"", it will turn people away. The novelty wears off, like in a relationship where you don't do anything with your significant other and it begins to feel like a waste of time. You bore them.   The reason this happens is people give you about 1-3 benefits of the doubt, or strikes, before they write off something as consistent behaviour. The first 3 times they'll think ""hm that was weird or made me uncomfortable/confused/bored. Maybe it's just me since I don't know them that well"" but after that they label you and say ""it's that guy again that always just texts random shit about nothing. Like watching Seinfeld but it not being funny"". Your 3 strikes usually reset in about 1-3 weeks, generally faster with dudes than with girls (few theories why, speaking from experience).   However, if when contacting someone, something always comes of it like an invitation, an idea (to meet, go somewhere), or some useful exchange of information, people appreciate that. If you have something to contribute to someone else's busy life in the narrow window of time you are allowed into their lives, they'll always accept you back for more.   Tl:dr have an interesting/unique follow up if you are contacting people daily. Else, wait until you can or shoot a random hey after a few weeks"

I think social media can really water down relationships and make you feel more in someone's life than you actually are, when in reality most people on there aren't sharing WITH you (be a part of my life), they are sharing AT you (look at my life).    When you get out of things like Facebook, you can see who actually wants to share their life with you- they'll make an effort to call, text, and communicate with you on a more personal one on one level.  Start paying no attention to these things! :)"

That's how a lot of people end up killing themselves when the lulls start happening even more. If you think about it, you have like probably 80 more years to live.  Are you seriously going to try and live EIGHTY more years like this? You're 21, you're still young, just try and improve. You can't keep running around this problem. You probably have what people call ""fat kid syndrome"" where you're still a fat kid who hates himself on the inside even when you're fit now.  You obviously want to change or this wouldn't be bothering you so much to post. I don't believe you're hopeless at all, I think you really just have to try again to mingle with people.   You may not like the feeling of needing to do any of this again because it may very well be exhausting, but clearly you're lonely. Even if you run away from it, you're still lonely. You just temporarily forgot.   Since you already play the vidya games, you might as well include that for common interest/friends. Gaming and such can be really social right now. People play together as a team or against each other; plenty of intense bromances have been forged this way before. People even meet their future wife on a game like WoW, ffs. I've been to so many ingame weddings to match the irl counterpart in so many different games, I've completely lost count.   Part of growing into a proper adult means accepting your not-so-rosy past with all its emotional baggage, but also moving on from it. You're still young af.

socialskills,3dqz9m,Severance13,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:34:18 2015 UTC,"When I first started out as a musician, it was really awkward working with other people, because I'm painfully shy when it comes to expressing my opinions [outside of the internet at least - I seem to get along just fine on here]. Eventually, I kinda talked myself into believing that I just preferred to work alone, and that's what I did for the next 5 years or so, until I got bored with it and kind of shelved the whole thing.  Later, after picking it back up again, I've been forcing myself to be more outgoing and all for a while, so I've tried again, writing with others. It's turned out to be really fun and rewarding. Sometimes it's still very awkward, but mostly it's fine.  After we're done goofing off and they go home, I can alt+tab over to some of my solo work and do the stuff that's, for me, more like therapy. Slow ambient and crap like that, or some crazy industrial hardcore on a bad day, or whatever.  So...when I want to, now I've got a few people I can call to come jam, but when I don't, you know, I still get to sit alone in my living room and be an introvert all I want.  Anyway...I just think it's easy to talk ourselves out of seeking friendship or companionship, telling ourselves that we don't even care or like it better that way, because the truth is that if we do care and still don't have it, that's just sad. But in the end, it does us a disservice. It's better to just face the way it feels and seek solutions.  It's always better to face things, to affect the present so as to change the future. Even if we fail, we learn."

Also as per the first two situations you described, you should have walked up to them within their proximity to notice you, stand and smile for a bit and say Hello (sing-songingly of course) before saying the 'excuse me' line.

I'm basically the same age as you, I'm entering college in a month, and am probably just as nervous as you are. I was a quiet guy for the majority of high school. However, I was still able to make a few very close friends and meet many other people. One thing that I've realized is that feeling like you're ""out of place"" is pointless. I've felt like that before, especially while being with a group of the more social kids at school. But I stuck through it, kept hanging out with friends and acquaintances, and over time that feeling went away.  Something important to note is that friendships take time to develop. Sure, once in a while you can meet someone who you just ""click"" with, but at least for me, those experiences have been few and far between. If you keep approaching someone and casually talking to them, eventually they'll start doing the same to you. If you've only spoken once and you feel awkward saying hi while you're walking past or something, realize it's not and keep being that friendly guy who greets everyone with a smile.  If you want to be friends with someone, do the work to make it happen. Don't wait around for them to come to you, because that moment may never come."

""He never turns down my invitations, so that means he likes spending time with me"" - is probably what she's thinking.  People forget about other people if they don't keep in contact. The amount of time will vary from person to person, but the behavior is the same.  Don't message, or answer calls. Just fade away from her life, and she will - hopefully - lead her life and start looking for another person to hang out. If even after that she still finds a way to ask about your disappearance,  and /or invite again, tell her that your personal schedule doesn't match with hers anymore - yes, ""white lies"" are valid. She doesn't have the right to know about your private life, so no fuss about not saying things clear.  You don't have to tell her that you're bored being with her, if you are really bad with confrontation. Actually it is not only a matter of avoiding confrontation, but also not being rude, since you two knew each other for such a long time.  Next time, if you meet another not that good friend, and  invites you, just tell that you're not interested, and always thanks he/she for being considerate. Since, in this case, it's a relationship in its early stages, the turn down will be accepted politelly, without fuss."

socialskills,3dpm38,QuantumHumanMyAss,-11,Sat Jul 18 12:09:24 2015 UTC,"The advice IS rude. Telling someone the truth is not a bad thing. You don't have to be mean about it.  ""Hey, so I know you like asking me to hang out but when we do, I do not get any enjoyment out of the things we are doing. If you invite me to do something I like I will come but I am not going to be coming to any more things that I would not go to on my own. I don't believe you would like doing things with me if everything I asked to do with you, you didn't like or worse, hated.""  Now if the person responds in a bad way, then the bad reaction is enough reason to bail all together. If the person says, oh, ok, I get that, then things are fine and you can move forward.  I had a girl ask me to be with her. I told her no. She said why. Most people would lie. I got out paper and told her that you both need physical and mental attraction. I told her on the physical part, there are a number of good things but some things I just was not attracted to and couldn't get past. Then on the mental side I explained how we didn't jive. I explained that we make decent friends but that the topics that relate to long term relationships, we just don't get along with. I told her she shouldn't have to change her personal opinions that can't be proven wrong just to be with someone and that I wouldn't be doing that either. She understood and then we were good friends for a couple years till she decided to do something not so good that couldn't be overcome.  Lying is rude and wrong if truth is an available option. Truth can be painful but isn't rude. It is honest and real.  In addition, lying to a long term friend isn't just rude, it is a massive disservice to that person. A person cannot improve or change something if they do not first have a signal that is telling them to change it. A person with bad breath will not know until someone tells them. That someone is the person who is the thanked one. Being selfish enough to not tell them due to a likely bad first response that might upset you or make you sound mean, is just not a good thing. It is selfish. If someone isn't your enemy there is no reason to hide something that could help them. You don't have to tell them that they have to change. Just why you are doing what you are doing. It gives them an option to do what they want. They can try or not try and both things are their choice and everyone is as happy as they could be."

I was in a similar situation as that but I think this advice to fade out only works if the other party can get those subtle signals and has other friends that they also occupy their time with, allowing that fade out to gracefully and mutually occur.   In the case of being best friends and being suddenly dropped, what would probably be more tactful is to start limiting contact little by little and if the other party is not fading out as well, then it has to be directly communicated that the friendship is ending. If the other party is not receiving the signals then being frank with them is a must.    Man, I was dumped by a good friend of mine several years back by her going overseas with no communication and when she came back just not really making an effort to talk to me again despite how much I reached out. I should have seen the signs much earlier but I was under the impression she would have been honest with me directly. Oh well.  It's all about context and feeling out the individual dynamics of a relationship. When subtle cues don't work to start out polite then the direct approach is a good back up."

There was a difference in that I enjoyed this friend but she literally wanted to one-on-one hang out ALL the time and would ask after the very next free minute in my time and if that was busy the next and if that was busy , the next.  She knew my work schedule.  If I told her I had plans, she wanted in.  I liked her, a lot actually, but you can't be with one person constantly.  I finally told her I had some need for just me alone time and it was nothing personal and set a time to hang out two weeks out.  I started doing this often.  Sometimes a week out, sometimes two or three.  (Remember I enjoyed time with her) Thing is she was a one friend, one-on-one all the time person so in the 'breaks' she started clinging to-um hanging with- a work friend ALL the time.  Your friend may be this person.  I think it is being afraid to be alone so looking for a one person solution.  Even though you are bored by this girl you might try the same.  She may even do the same and grab onto another all-the-time friend. In the end we lost touch because she really could only have one friend at a time."

socialskills,3dpm38,farkenell,5,Sat Jul 18 12:56:25 2015 UTC,"I'm shocked by the responses people are posting. I thought this subreddit was for helping people make friends, but the replies in this thread seem to suggest it is about doing whatever is convenient no matter who it hurts. Everyone seems in favor of straight up ignoring her or making wild excuses to avoid her. People are being downvoted for suggesting that you actually talk to her and tell her the truth. I guess we truly do live in a world where lying and avoiding is the acceptable way to behave rather than communicating and being honest.  Lying and ignoring is a cruel way to end a relationship. Perhaps someone would ""get the message"" if they were starting a friendship for the very first time. But after 8 years this is not just that random guy/girl you met at work or school who wants a buddy, this is someone who probably thinks of you as a good friend.  Perhaps you can reach a compromise. Tell her that you can only hang out less often, or that you are still willing to chat/text her but you aren't comfortable spending so much time together. You may feel differently in the future and want to get back together again.  Put yourself in their shoes. If someone you were good friends with just stopped talking to you one day, you wouldn't just say, ""Well, that was fun while it lasted. Who's next?"" No, you would try to find out what was going on. Eventually you would need to tell the truth, and then it would hurt more than if you just told them in the first place.  Have you considered that you may be the only friend she has? If you have plenty of friends, it may be easy to think everyone else does as well, and there should be no problem because she still has tons of people to hang out with. If she is consistently asking you to hang out and not allowing the relationship to fade away, this is probably not the case for her.  People who lie, ignore me, and/or make excuses are a huge problem for me because I do start to suspect it, but I can't tell if it's my social anxiety/paranoia getting the better of me or if they are legitimately unavailable. Making friends is enough of a struggle already without having to deal with this shit, so it's better if everyone just communicates properly."
socialskills,3dpm38,MitchellLitchi,3,Sun Jul 19 03:57:20 2015 UTC,"Every day, think of a reason why you can't spend time with her. Then, when she asks you, you're ready. Tell her you can't spend time with her because of reason.  I like to keep my schedule open so I would say things I might do, but you could make stuff up or actually plan things instead.  Can't do that, I'm doing this."
socialskills,3dpm38,FantasyDuellist,10,Sat Jul 18 12:23:33 2015 UTC,"If she always wants to hang out then you need to shut her down fast.  If you're really bad at confrontation, it's up to you to be honest and say that you don't really feel like it (to which she's going to question and you have to answer awkwardly), or lie and say that you got into a new hobby/met other people/you already set up a day with some chick/friends on the internet to play vidya games together/you got work to do.  Just remember that this is basically your chance to get better at confrontation, because this is a much needed life skill. Otherwise people are going to just push you around."

Bye (forever)""  Well i wouldn't actually phrase it quite like that but I think that is the jist of anything i'd say if the point is to be honest.  I guess i am wondering, is there any way of doing it where it won't result in her crying"
socialskills,3dpm38,NorthKoreanDictator_,7,Sat Jul 18 08:43:58 2015 UTC,"Just tell her you are busy whenever she asks to see you, and use only short replies when she messages you something.  There is no real need to outright say that you find her boring. That is kind of rude."
socialskills,3dpm38,FaKeShAdOw,5,Sat Jul 18 09:07:14 2015 UTC,"Is she really that needy that she'll start crying like that?  Yo, this girl needs some hobbies that isn't hanging out with you, seriously. Maybe you should let her know this in a tactful way, as a caring person. Even she should grab some self-awareness at some point and realize that you two don't make for good friends anyway.  There's plenty of ""mature"" ways to deal with this, including being completely completely honest about why you don't wanna hang out anymore. But mature doesn't mean that it will avoid conflict. If all of them leads into crying then there's nothing you can do about that.   Also, if she keeps texting you or facebook-chatting you up, you DON'T have to keep answering. Just don't answer so much and you need to learn how to say 'no I'm not up to hanging out today' when she corners you. Don't be a people-pleaser at all if it just makes you feel like shit. She's not in control of your physical body anyway, so just don't even leave the house if you don't feel like it, lol. That's your right. You can even say something direct like ""I don't wanna leave the house today, this is a me-day"" for like 3 months if you want, who cares.   But it's up to you to add that last bit:  ""No, I'm not up to hanging out today, IDK when I ever will be honestly, I've been feeling like shit"" or ""I'm planning on hanging out with others today""  to make some avoidant shit up like everyone else,  or  ""No I'm not up to hanging out today because I don't think we're a good match friendshipwise, I'm sorry""  or you don't even have to owe her an explanation."

socialskills,3dpm38,dbzgtfan4ever,2,Sat Jul 18 14:10:48 2015 UTC,"Seems like the general advice here is to just stop talking to her and slowly fade out of your life. I am just wondering if there might be a different tactic you can take. Have you tried to liven things up to your liking? For example, if she talks about boyfriend and you find that boring, you can try changing the topic to something you find interesting. Or you can plan different activities that you do not find boring--watching movies, mini golf, video games. 8 years is a long time to be friends with someone, so maybe consider salvaging the relationship first rather than throwing it away so quickly. Take some responsibility for having boring hangouts and try to make them fun first."

Tell her everything, if you beat around the bush you may escape the friendship but she'll still continue to be the boring type and her future relationships may suffer still.  Since you've been friends so long, you can definitely communicate freely to her. Regardless of her reaction, if she knows the problem she can work on her character when meeting new people. For an 8 year old friendship that hasn't gone south, the least you could do is set her in the direction towards being a more entertaining person. (No one wants to be boring, especially boring and not know everyone dreads their company.)  Good luck."

You also have to know who you're talking to. Could be they have absolutely no interest in what you're saying and would rather be playing Tetris on their laptop before their lunch break is over. They may be interested but know nothing about what you're saying and have no chance to ask the relevant question because you're talking a lot.
socialskills,3dpuyb,Goateey,3,Sat Jul 18 07:44:11 2015 UTC,"Do you journal? I'd recommend trying it if you have not. I believe part of what you are experiencing is having a desire to put the personal information you know, elsewhere. Journaling may give you that outlet but it will also allow you to go back and review your thoughts on a person/situation, providing a bit of objective clarity on ether you should tell a particular person something or whether something should even be shared. There are things which are personal and those which are private. Try to gauge which level certain people have earned, if any.  Generally speaking, personal things should only be shared with those you have hung out with multiple times and at least alone with once. Private things really should be kept as such until you have experienced whether to specifically trust this person. Never share anything which could be damaging to you if they betrayed your trust."

Maybe their sports team was in the news, maybe you ask how their son's doing at school.  I won't kid you, making a strong first impression is generally more effective.

Oh, I guess training kids and dogs can't be that different. 😀 ******. Hey got to go but hope to see you out walking again."" You never want to appear desperate.

We shook hands and said we would look forward to talking in the future. People want to meet people also, no one is sure how to do it.       Here's an example. Met a nice young lady (mid 30's), while I was out with a friend who was in need of some companionship. We were sitting at a crowded bar. She was with a group of girlfriends/sisters. She bumped into me while trying to order drinks. She didn't apologize just looked at me.  I could have taken it in one of two directions. I laughed and thanked her. She looked confused, so I told her it was the closest I had been to being touched by a beatiful woman in a long time, especially one who knew how to dress to accentuate her beauty. She asked what I knew about clothes. Explained I knew the Manf of numerous labels, Bijou Bijou, Ed Hardy Jeans, Blue Blood Denim, Z-Brand etc.... This piqued her interest and she started asking about how I knew them. We got to talking to the point her friends started pestering her to leave and go over to the table with them. She told them she would be over in a few minutes. I told her I didn't want to keep her from her friends and my buddy needed to talk. Told her she had made my night, thanked her and she went over to her friends. She was African-American, I'm Caucasian and about 25 years older than her. So every strike against me but as my friend said after she left. ""I can't believe you. She was rude and dissed you when she walked up but by the end she was ready to leave with you. Why didn't you ask her home?"" I told him I was out with him and this was his night. (Oh, don't worry about him, single young handsome surgeon. More women chasing him than you can shake a stick at. He was just getting over a breakup with a woman and needed a friend to commiserate with for a night.). Sorry got long winded. TL/DR: People want to meet other people. If they didn't they'd  stay home. Keep it simple, be interested in them. Keep it about how interesting they are to you."
socialskills,3dpdwb,Glassman59,2,Sat Jul 18 05:11:09 2015 UTC,"You have really good templates for conversations. I always struggle with follow up for questions after they reply that aren't just ""oh okay"" or ""nice!"". Even if it's really interesting, I sometimes can't follow up with another sentence. It just gets quiet. What do you suggest"
socialskills,3dpdwb,indirectlysubtle,2,Sun Jul 19 03:24:04 2015 UTC,"Practice in your head at off times a conversation. Give yourself different replies from the other persons perspective and how you would reply to that reply. Maybe best advice is while you really want to hear the other person's reply don't act like your hanging on their every word. Act a bit like while you think they are interesting you have a lot to bring to the game. Example: After the first sentence say about the bracelet they are wearing and they reply with a ""nice"", ""okay"", start to turn away from them while saying something along the lines of, ""I just wanted to complement you on the bracelet since it's rare to see someone who enjoys ""Art Nouveau"" jewelry."" If you don't think you can identify a piece of jewelry like that. LEARN. It isn't hard to pick something like jewelry, fashion designers, shoe designers, purses. Whatever, you don't need to learn about everything just pick a topic that a woman might be interested in and learn about it. Makes you stand out and gives you that follow up sentence you are looking for. I mean how hard is it to try and study up for the chance to meet the girl of your dreams. If she asks how you know so much about bracelets or whatever? Be truthful, tell her you studied just so you would have the chance to have something to talk about with such a pretty woman. Smile when you say it, this is the part where you show you don't take yourself too serious and that you have a sense of humor. Interacting with other people takes practice just like anything else. Good Luck."

Mostly because of videogames actually, who needs friends when you have videogames? The problem though is that friends have other uses, videogames don't teach social skills and getting a girlfriend requires some kind of social interaction.

While you're moving your thumbs, your peers are out there and developing skills/experiences that are really hard to get later in life. If you don't care for friends because of video games, it might be a coping mechanism as much as a disinterest one.  You can't trick people at these things by having a strategy. You're no cleverer than they are. If you are going out there with the intention of making people see you as ""that guy"" it's about as artificial as you can get. If you noticed that someone was trying to impress you with an act, would you want to be friends with that person? Would you want to be friends with someone who thinks they are special and interesting?.. There was a guy at my college who is an international student. He tried so hard to make people like him by showing off, telling really personal stories no one cared for, and being overly dramatic. It came off as really narcicistic and self-absorbed. Everyone got real sick of it so fast. People got the vibe that he thought he was better than everyone else, and whatever he did came across as fake an manipulative.  If you're 17, I take it you can't get into any night clubs/venues? Would you be at a schoolmates house?.. It's good to go to these things with a friend."

The best act is the one which is completely real on first place.  I live in spain, everyone above 16 or less goes regularly to those places, I'll be 18 as soon as college starts and that's more or less when I plan to start partying!

See if she's a toucher/non-toucher, and what kind of personal space she keeps around herself. If that doesn't work--ask.

If not,  then there is no reason to think they are regretting your hire.    Then there is the solution.  I would hit this on all possible fronts.  If you can afford get counselling.  They are likely to be able to give you some tools to help you feel more confident. If you can't afford counselling,  check out your local colleges. If they offer a psych degree they may have cheap counselling available.  Otherwise look into things like 12 step programs.  A place to take the garbage in your head and dump it will greatly telp how you think.  Adult children of Alcoholics changed my life.    My wife and I have recently started attending toastmasters.  This is a great place to practice public speaking.  I have found my general confidence in speaking has greatly increased.  And at least at our club,  everyone who attends is reasonably socially awkward.  That is why they are there,    Start exercising.  Hormones released when exercising will help you feel better about your self.  This can be as simple as a walk around the block before dinner each night or before work in the morning.    Start dressing better.  Start haunting /r/malefashionadvice.  This doesn't have to cost a fortune.  Start checking out thrift shops.  Mostly they are full of clapped out junk but you can learn to spot good quality stuff.  Start by going to a good quality men's store and get measured.  Once you know your size,  the rest is a lot easier.    Eat better.  Improve your diet.  There are strong correlations between poor diet and depression.  It is an easy fix.  You don't have to go full vegan.  Just remove fast food and sugar from your diet.    Join some sort of voluntary organisation.  Get passionate about making the world a better place.  That will give you interesting things to talk about.   That should be enough to keep you busy for a little while.    Oh,  and check out a podcast called ""the art of charm""  tons of guests that can assist you with your challenges."

This has worked flawlessly for me. I give it all I got for an hour or two like Im an extrovert, mingle, then I head home to recharge.  It really helps with feeling like you're not going to die because you know you'll be gone in an hour or two.  The only time I broke that rule is when I was talking to a girl at a party"
socialskills,3doksx,i_yell_things,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:16:58 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about your other coworkers as their heads will be in a different gear once they're at the party. I mean, socializing is what parties are for, right? So whether or not you'd like to socialize with them, it doesn't matter. They won't notice if ever you're uncomfortable around them.  You can, as i_yell_things said, inform the host ahead of time that you have to leave early, and that would be a good thing as it sets expectations. Also, as a follow-up, you can opt to tell the host and/or the person who invited you that you have to go ahead, and you never know, you might just get last minute conversations that will never end. At least, that's what I've experienced."
socialskills,3dowax,rednotgreen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:24:21 2015 UTC,"Try. And try again. Think of every possible interaction as a once a lifetime chance to spemd a few minutes with someone. Everyone has great lifestories - you and everyone you meet.   Sometimes it's hard to ask the first question, but just try. Pick something you could just try to find out, like ""would you know.. Where room 634/ a USPS mailbox/a bus stop is? Where I could get some lunch around here?""   Once you get started into the habit of asking random people, you can easily expand. You could e.g. ask someone for a recommendation where to find some clothes for a party (""I thought you might know where one could get some clothes for a party.."" As that implies the person has a good tadte in clothing).  You could ask someone what kind of sports they like to do (if they have an air of sportiness, good concentration skills, an open mind and confidence). Whatever sports it is, if you are unfamiliar with it but it sounds interesting, you could ask for advice for a beginner; how to get started, if ey have any tips (everyone loves feeling they are experts).  And ask the waiter, barista or the cashier too. How was your day? Any weekend plans? While you run your errands, you might get a nice 2-3 minutes of simple chitchat where neither of you have to reveal anything deeply personal to each other but can still have a nice chat that makes you feel good (and makes the next interactions with anyone else easier).  Also a tip for an easy chat: dog owners. Say hi to the friendly looking dogs ""hi puppy!""). Ask the owner if they seem friendly. Most people love their pets and are happy to talk about them for a few minutes with someone their pet likes. And pets are often easier to read than humans."

socialskills,3do8xd,sectb,2,Fri Jul 17 23:58:08 2015 UTC,"Also, there's nothing wrong about being quiet. Some people are quiet, some aren't, and that doesn't mean everyone needs to be the same.   A close friend of mine was also very quiet, like I didn't know what he was thinking, and I kept bugging him about it, but then I realized that it wasn't him who needs to be more interactive, it was me who needed to be more respective of who he is, you know?   I've also met a lot of other people who weren't ""talkative"" and they were fine. I mean, I left them alone and gave them the space that I believe they deserved, and whenever they reached out to me to talk, I just listened.  So I guess my point is, be comfortable in your being quiet. There's nothing wrong with it. People are different and some might prefer the opposite of what you tend to be but that shouldn't bother you at all. You'll find friends regardless. :)"

socialskills,3dkpfm,save_the_pigs,7,Fri Jul 17 23:48:11 2015 UTC,"I recently started working a part time retail job so I am in a similar situation to you. The thing I noticed when it came to getting to know my co-workers was that I get along with and am much more comfortable around the people that are more of the outgoing type. Meaning they say whatever is on their mind, even if it is completely random and not related to the work. Whenever they would start talking about these random topics it would make me laugh and make me feel much more relaxed. As a result of this I opened up much more easily to these people because they 'allowed' those types of conversations to happen. I could have much deeper conversations than just the typical small talk or surface level types of conversations with them.  So I started doing the same thing myself when I would meet someone new that I hadn't worked with before and it helped so much. The sooner you start talking about 'random' topics with a person, the much easier it is to relate to them and to see how they view the world. One thing to keep in mind is that you are not going to get along with everybody. A lot (not always, but definitely some) of people will not like you and won't give you the time of day. This is the case for me also, there are some people where we literally just exchange ""Hello"" and that's it. And that's ok.  I guess the TL;DR version of this is be quick at talking about random things, be the person that starts those types of conversations so people know you can have fun and talk openly about whatever it is that's on your mind."

I have a big group of friends, but some of them I am not nearly as close to as the others. One girl in particular, I really enjoyed talking to, but we just never were best buds. So her and I just said ""let's go out one day"" and we did. At first it was weird being one on one, but then it became really fun. All we did was grab sushi, but after that experience the bond strengthened and it lead to ""hey remember when we grabbed sushi and ______ happened"" Life experiences together make stronger friends. Sometimes bad times, like getting lost or being late to an event, end up being the stories that are brought up in a better light later on.   Now this girl and I are extremely close.  Another way I find to strenthen bonds is just by being open. I just started a new job a few weeks ago and the two guys I work in the same room with are very chill. It still felt weird because they knew each other longer, but I talked about myself or things that bugged me that day or personal things and cracked jokes and now we're close. We also grabbed drinks after work a few times and the dynamic of the room feels equal. We all equally enjoy talking to each other. So sometimes just being honest and open and vulnerable helps as well.  Good luck, hope this helps and keep us updated!  :)"

But I believe that this is because is it truly done over conversation. Sure asking good questions can be a great way to open up to someone but there comes a time in friendship it doesn't really matter what you say.   It is about how you make someone feel. You bond by creating good memories or by getting someone emotionally involved. Take a genuine interest in them, ask them to hangout, and most importantly take whatever you want them to feel (comfort, happiness, excitement, etc) and feel it yourself. Emotions are contagious and if you embrace a feeling and share how you feel through actions, they will feel it too."

So, about being self conscious, I would say just try to inject yourself in group conversations or make your own with some people. Maybe mention a few times that you know that your English isn't so good, that usually makes people very patient and they will also put more effort into understanding what you're trying to say.  As for vocabulary, if you feel like you can't really have everyday conversations, then try to pick up on other people's vocabulary.   If you want to develop a more personal, unconventional set if words, though, I guess you could read more books, or articles on the internet, then try to use some of the new words you learnt in conversations. You mentioned you do this, but try to focus on words you can implement in your 'regular vocab', so to speak.

There are moments when I think twice about what I'm going to say that I end up saying nothing for seconds. So much for trying to be fluent...  A thing people suggested me to do was to find someone who roughly has the accent I want and try to emulate him by recording myself talking then listen how I sound like.  But in my opinion the best approach would be to get me a Skype friend whom we share common interests and call each other daily.

socialskills,3dlef2,blankblank,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:26:32 2015 UTC,"No. What I'd suggest is just continue reading the books you are. And the more confident you get with reading the English language, challenge yourself with more difficult books.  The more proficient you become at reading the better you begin to understand the intricacies of the language, you also start to gain a greater vocabulary.  It is with those tools in your ""vocabulary arsenal"" that inserting yourself or even beginning interesting conversation becomes easier.  Social anxiety in regards to conversation skills is a whole different ball game. If you don't have those anxieties in your native language you likely won't have them in English, if you do, one thing that can help you is practice. But that may be off point."

I may add to this that don't just ask questions, but use them to get yourself involved. You'll have to take it from there, but if you are listening, rather than thinking about what to say you'll find more success.   All in all, you have to figure out WHY you have trouble relating. You clearly want to improve your social skills. The only way is to understand why you can't move forward and then decide to do something about it. Two things that I would recommend is to first, talk to your buddy who has no qualms with talking to strangers. Next go out on your own and simply start a conversation with someone you don't know. Build up your ability to simply engage new people and then when this situation comes again, you'll be much more comfortable."
socialskills,3dk49k,crispy3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:31:13 2015 UTC,"I think I´ve figured out the reason why I didn´t enter the conversation, it is because the things he was saying to them just didn´t give me much room, as I would have to say completely different things than what he was saying to participate in the conversation. I mean, he was saying things like ""do you have cigarettes? no? why can´t you feed my addiction?"" and while stuff like that made them laugh, I really couldn´t find anything interesting to say in that scenario, because that kind of interaction (flirting with the girls) was clearly not a ""team-job"".

socialskills,3di9ga,askedagirloutthrwy,102,Thu Jul 16 14:16:44 2015 UTC,"My take is this: You equate romance with relationships. But they're really not the same thing.  Romance is going on dates, having fun, and enjoying the magic of intimacy.  A relationship is a commitment to stick around, be there for each other, and ultimately integrate each other into the rest of your lives.  It's possible for a person not to be ready for a relationship, but be perfectly comfortable with romance.   My advice is just enjoy it and take things as they come. She probably just wants to take it slow with the emotional part of things. When things get more serious, then you'll eventually need to talk about what each of your expectations are."

socialskills,3di9ga,Kozio_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:02:59 2015 UTC,"I've always had a lot of trouble with this too. Case in point: more than once at the end of a date, as I'm wrestling with whether or not I should go in for a kiss (""what if I'm misreading it??""), I've had girls get concerned and say something like ""Are you okay...? You've got a really weird look on your face..."".  I've had girlfriends later tell me that they were just waiting for me to make a move the entire time, and my lack of action actually made them think they were misreading everything and maybe I actually wasn't interested at all.  Two things helped me get better at this:    A girlfriend pointed out to me that if you're already doing date stuff, one on one (especially if you called it a ""date""), and you think things are going well, then it's pretty damn likely she's interested. At the very least, it's widely understood that touching or kissing on dates is a thing people do, so she's not going to think you're creepy or there's something wrong with you if you try to hold her hand. Granted, she might not welcome it for any number of reasons, but she won't judge you for it. She will understand and just tell you she doesn't want to do that.  The other thing was a friend telling me that I was making too many assumptions about other people's boundaries. I thought they might get upset at even the littlest physical contact, to say nothing of kissing. In contrast, he told me that he always just took things as far as the other person would let him. In other words, try to hold her hand: if she reciprocates, then later go for a kiss. If she reciprocates that too, and you're comfortable with it, maybe start touching her a little more intimately. And so on, up to whatever point you yourself are cool with. In practice, he told me, every one of his girlfriends had ended up at least topless on their first date. Granted, he had plenty of dates that went nowhere at all because the two of them just didn't click. That just happens. But the point is, women are just as horny as the guys they're going out with, and the worst that will happen is they will tell you they want to wait for another date before taking things further.   tl;dr: If you're on a date and it's going well, then just keep making moves and give her the opportunity to tell you what the boundaries are."

She likes you. It's really fkn obvious she does. The ""I'm not ready"" thing is for one of two reasons.    She fighting her own desires to move faster in the relationship.  She wants you to court her. She may believe that if you're together the flirtation and tension game will stop.   Of these two, the first is the more likely.    My advice; play it cool but amp up the flirtation. Increase subtle moves like casual body contact and eye contact. (hand on the back, hand grazing across her forearm or hand, casual brushing hair out of her eyes)  The last line is probably the most important of all. ""You make me shy..."" This essentially implies she wants more but is afraid to act. She wants you to take the lead. Do so."

From my point of view, going out on a date is by no means a relationship commitment so there is no reason to be confused on that subject, I personally draw a wide line in my mind between dating and actually committing to a long term relationship but that is me.  I'm guessing that for some girls going out on a date is the same as going into a relationship and they're not ready to do that for whatever reason so in this case it is up to you to state that it is just a date and you are just having fun/getting to know each other/chillax. :)"

It's one of those really weird things that I (and I think most young people) have a hard time with as they grow up.  In highschool it's ""do you want to be my girlfriend?"" ""okay cool we're in a relationship now!""  Somewhere along the line it becomes necessary to go on a few (or more) dates before entering a relationship."
socialskills,3di9ga,willow625,3,Thu Jul 16 21:11:56 2015 UTC,"Don't think about it so much! She's giving you mixed signals because her emotions are probably giving her mixed signals. Also: dates are dates, and a relationship is an entirely different thing. Enjoy your time dating her, and a relationship might come from it. This could be after as few as 3 dates or as many as (?)...just let it happen organically.   Also, from her cues I'd say something romantic is developing between you two. I suggest you continue to show your interest in very subtle ways. Example: if you're walking down the street together and she starts turning the wrong way, let her know by brushing your hand lightly on her upper back. Don't grab her, just a light touch instead of words to communicate. I realize this is a super specific example but there are other ways like this to break that touch barrier that can lead to hand-holding or maybe even a kiss on the cheek as you two say goodbye. I suggest this because if I was interested in someone, and he did something like that before we had even held hands, I would probably get shivers and would want to take things a little further.  Best of luck! You got this buddy!"

socialskills,3di9ga,iGrind619,2,Thu Jul 16 18:23:49 2015 UTC,"Putting your arm around her might feel too possessive this early in the game, so if you feel a moment where you can hold hands then go for it. This stuff is so situational, it's hard to give very specific examples. The physical contact is more to gauge her reaction than anything. Pay attention to her body language...if she seems to tense up when you touch her, or if she turns away or shakes you off, then don't try to touch her anymore, at least for the rest of the time you're spending with her that day. If she seems okay with you touching her/holding her hand, then just keep doing that one thing, don't try to escalate it. I hope that's clearer."

socialskills,3di9ga,iGrind619,3,Thu Jul 16 16:44:27 2015 UTC,"Female here!  You may have been shy to ask her out to begin with but remember she's shy too.  The first time you asked her out you most likely caught her off guard and she said no. Once she had time to think about it, she's now said yes. You need to give her time to warm up to it, she's just processing her feelings towards you.  You had the courage to ask her out the first time. I think when you feel the time is right, you need to just straight up ask her how she feels about you.  Giving space is a good reaction however I don't want you to miss out on something that could be special. Just go for it!"
socialskills,3di9ga,Just_Like_You,3,Thu Jul 16 21:09:44 2015 UTC,"Another female here.   It sounds to me like she is shy but interested. She may have said no at first just out of a fear reaction (I know that I've done that). Or maybe she hadn't even thought about you in that way yet and was really surprised and said the first thing that came to mind (I've done that one too).  My advice would be to take it slow. Don't push too hard. It sounds like you have a good thing going with the movies. When I go to a movie with a guy I like, I will lean against his side kind of encouraging him to put his arm around me. If she does that, go ahead and put your arm around her. If not, just enjoy the movie and her presence.   Don't push her too fast, you'll just scare her off. Let her take the lead on moving to the next step until she's making it obvious that she's interested.   My guess is that in another movie or two you guys will be holding hands and kissing.

I have social phobia, and the only time I'm comfortable going out with people is when I'm 1on1 with them. So naturally, when I go out with someone, it's just me and him/her. I didn't think it to be weird, but only recently while refelcting back on my last year or two, I see, that all these girls I went out with just as ""friends"", might actually felt really differently about it. For example there was this one friend (girl) I asked out, she came once, but refused all the next ones. There was this one girl who refused for 3-4 times until finally coming out. Now I get the feeling that a girl I've been going out with as friends for the longest of time is actually into me and wanting to go out on a date or something, but I have never seen her that way... And I also used to reschedule and be super considerate with these outgoings, kind of as if it was an important impress-her date :p  But thinking about it also made me think - so what?

socialskills,3djqu6,Nosroi,3,Fri Jul 17 03:25:45 2015 UTC,"Hand holding, kissing, or similar intimate actions such as touching their knee/they touching yours. First encounter, maybe one or two after the first, may not have these things. In such cases, the line blurs between just hanging out and going on a date. The difference is the intention of both parties. Just hanging out there is no expectation that the relationship will become intimate.   They were not dates, in my opinion. I think that both parties have to agree that the get together was a date for it to be one. Even if the woman he was with thought it was a date, if he had other ideas, then it wasn't."

socialskills,3djqu6,weenli,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:40:31 2015 UTC,"""Hang out"" has begun to have dating implications, and so has asking someone's availability.  But only when it is implied that the two are a valid pairing (i.e. a straight man and women, two gay men, etc).  So because you are a male and assumed straight, they are misreading your desire to actually hang out as ""want to go on a DATE?""  And they might also be assuming you want to just make out with them all if you go deeper.  Of course, this is beside the point if you have platonic intentions.  Find a way to make that clear.  The other alternative is telling all your woman friends that you are gay, which only works... when you are gay, unfortunately."

socialskills,3dkhf4,nashman93,0,Sun Jul 19 00:36:42 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say anything, nor would I care much."
socialskills,3dkhf4,Abstruse_,0,Fri Jul 17 01:49:47 2015 UTC,"If telling them ""hey you cut in line, the back is that way"" doesn't work then I'll say it again louder and if they still don't move then I'll just even louder inform everyone within hearing distance that some asshat just cut in front of everyone and incite a revolt against that person."
socialskills,3didk3,DoubleEdgedWombat,14,Thu Jul 16 14:51:01 2015 UTC,"Talk about what you feel like talking about and ignore the inner monologue that keeps questioning whether what you're discussing is ""interesting"" or ""compelling"". Once you start naturally talking about things, even if it's just an instinctual undeveloped opinion, it will sounds interesting because you'll have even somewhat of a passion behind it. Short version: Don't think, just talk."
socialskills,3didk3,AvengeTheEve,3,Thu Jul 16 15:03:36 2015 UTC,"I bet she isn't missing the conversation itself so much as the feeling that she can relate to you as another person who is engaged with the world and curious about it.  Don't worry about boring her; worry about the fact that you're boring yourself.  Find something that interests and stimulates you, and read something or watch something about it every day.  Then your conversations will get better."
socialskills,3didk3,ElMelonTerrible,3,Thu Jul 16 19:32:27 2015 UTC,"I think you're onto something there.  Our work schedules and financial situation have been so bad lately that we really haven't done much of anything except sit around the house and play video games/go on youtube and facebook lately and I think it's getting to us.  We /want/ to do lots of stuff together - take up hunting, fishing, go camping, ride our motorcycles across the state, etc - but we lack the money to do much of anything right now.  I know I'm bored, and I'm pretty sure she is too.  I'd like to think that this is our only problem, or at least the root of everything.  Having nothing to do, I get down on myself (and she might too) and then the negative thoughts start."
socialskills,3didk3,DaKuY,2,Thu Jul 16 20:24:23 2015 UTC,"Most guys tend to just keep to themselves and continue drifting away from their wife. So first and foremost I have to say you are a good husband because #1 you noticed there might be a small communication barrier in your marriage and #2 you're trying to find a solution. You're in the right track man! :-)  Also, it's OK to be an introvert! All that means is you recharge and get energy from being alone. Don't let the title of ""introvert"" prevent you from having the marriage of your dreams.   I think I have some insights that may help you.   Last month I was in vacation with my wife and we were visiting a friend in the San Francisco Bay area. We were sitting outside of a coffee shop and I told my friend that my wife and I have been dating 8+ years and we've been married a little over a year.  My friend then asked us a question and then told us something that we will never forget because it can help us ""flip the switch"", become interesting, and bring that SPARK back to the relationship.   When you are interested you become interesting.   Here's my recommendation. This will help you when you feel like you have nothing left to say.    Have the curiosity and imagination like a child. When an adult sees toy car, all he sees is a toy car and puts it up. When a child sees a toy car, ""oh boy, it's on!"" the child sees the fastest race car in the world and pushes it along the floor,  the child sees a flying car and soars it through the air , the child sees a monster truck that smashes into walls and explodes! As an adult, When you see your wife what do you see and think? When you hear your wife talk about politics or an interesting YouTube video, what do you think about? Now, has a child's mind. How did you see your wife when you were first dating? What did you find interesting about her? What attracted you to her? When she talks about politics or science is that sexy to you?  The questions you ask determine the quality of your life. When your wife talks about politics, science, or and interesting video on YouTube ask questions and ""act as if you are interested"". Yes you might feel fake at first but your mind and body don't know that. A funny thing happens, you acutally start to become I interested. How do I do that? Good question. First, smile! Smile until you have crows feet on the outside of your eyes. Before you see your wife smile for 1 minute. Right with you see your wife, smile like you haven't seen her in a whole year. Second, repeat what she said. For example, use the word interesting, ""That's interesting honey/babe, let me see if I understand what you said. From what I understand you said...[summarize as best as you can]... Does that sound about right?"" Third, ask questions. Ask questions and have the curiosity like a child. ""Why do you think Obama said that?"" ""What are your thoughts on XYZ topic?"" ""What does [some political word] mean?"" ""What made you watch that YouTube video?""  Spend more quality time together. I recommend trying out the Five Minute Journal. As men, we don't have a lot to say until we write it down. Google the Five Minute Journal. You don't have to buy it. My wife and I just use a piece of paper and write down the questions that are in the sample. OK I have the questions or journal, what do I so now? Tell your wife that you'd like to try to spend more quality time together using this Five Minute Journal. Tell her this, ""Babe I'd like to spend more time together using that thing I heard of called the five minute journal. We each have a journal or a piece of paper and we answer three questions. After answering them we share our answers with each other. The questions are 'I am grateful for...' list 3 things, 'What would make today great?' list 3 things, and Daily affirmation. 'I'm introverted and I'm proud. I connect with my wife easily and we still have that SPARK in our marriage."" The questions I mentioned are all on their website in the same view.    Summary: If you are interested you become interesting. The questions you ask yourself determine the quality of your life. #1 be curious like a child when you see a situation, don't think ""oh here we go again."" Think like a child! ""Oh, I can make this into something new and exciting!"" #2 Smile and ask questions and act as if you were interested and you will become interested #3 Check out the 5 Minute Journal   Good luck and I hope this helps!   If this helped you or anyone else, PM me. I'd love to hear your thoughts and your story of you tries any of this out!"
socialskills,3didk3,moretequillalessjoe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:37:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe try to shake the mold a little bit.  Create a situation where you are both stimulated, like go somewhere together or share some activity you can both be engaged in.  Other than that maybe there are some personal issues that prevent you from contributing your energy towards, like being too stressed at work?  Maybe you just need a little bit of spontaneity or a little more creativity.  I guess to be interesting (not that I am haha) you need to be interested, so try to be present instead of worrying about having things go the right way."
socialskills,3didk3,ps00n,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:18:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe tell her you feel like this. Firstly, it will give you both something to talk about. Secondly, it may help break this cycle since we tend to re-enforce negative beliefs when we repeat them over and over in our mind.  Also it may not just be about talking about HER interests, she may just want to hear you be passionate about something (as /u/ElMelonTerrible said earlier she may just want to relate) so maybe share more about your own interests (your work is not always your interest!). If you don't have any interesting interests, now would be a good time to pick some. Don't go stale!"
socialskills,3didk3,drfinnn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:23:41 2015 UTC,"I don't really enjoy talking about the way I feel.  We did so last night, and no matter how much she tried to tell me she loves me and it's ok, I ended up feeling more depressed and crappy than I did when we started.  That always tends to be what happens."
socialskills,3diulo,tempusers,10,Thu Jul 16 16:57:31 2015 UTC,"Definitely invite yourself in. be a bit forward. just go ""i wouldnt mind a XX, if you have the time"" or whatever. Be friendly, open, inquisitive, and be ready to take a negative response with a smile. Its a first step, not a magical fix for everything.   Then do it again, and repeat until success."
socialskills,3diulo,jahoodunrama,5,Thu Jul 16 17:03:51 2015 UTC,Have you tried being the initiator? Nothing's stopping you from asking other people to go out to grab lunch or pick something up.
socialskills,3diulo,sagers,3,Thu Jul 16 17:57:50 2015 UTC,"This. I got left out often when I started at my new company. Partly from being new,  partly from being shy,  partly from convincing myself ""well,  if they want me to go,  they'll invite me!"" but that's a bit of an arrogant attitude to take.   Sometime people are rude,  but other times,  they might just assume you want to eat alone or done know you well enough to know if it'll fit the lunch dynamic. So invite people out with you or even be as bold as to say ""hey guys,  mind if I join?"". More often than not,  they'll say sure."
socialskills,3diulo,squirrelcartel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:08:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I talked with one the guys, and while doing so it hit me. I was being like...""Oh, I was angry today because I expected you to invite me. I expected it. My value as a team member was lessened because you weren't considerate enough to think to invite me."" He's like ""Oh, no doubt you're valued here, I can't believe you aren't where want to be yet, but what does getting food have to do with it? Aren't you on that big project? Didn't want to interrupt you from it."" Me: ""Oh, shit, what kind of precedence have I set up for myself, and the expectations of others out of me?"" edit: formatting & quotes"
socialskills,3diulo,crispy3,3,Thu Jul 16 23:53:42 2015 UTC,do you identify with these people? is this the first time theyve abandoned you? are they pleasant or courteous to you otherwise?
socialskills,3diulo,ElMelonTerrible,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:02:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, No, Yes Edit:  That is to say, I've talked to these people before and feel connected to them, they know who I am and have said hi before, but this is not the first time I've been overlooked or decided I was not one to ask for lunch. Otherwise we are courteous and nothing ill has been said before. I have decided I have a different issue, it's one of I've been portraying as ""don't ask me"" through either body language, and that my work ethic which has portrayed an attitude that says ""I'm too busy to eat lunch with you because I still have things to do."" Regardless of my intent or not, I've come across as ""pure business"" and maybe a bit antisocial."
socialskills,3diulo,Castolis,2,Fri Jul 17 11:54:18 2015 UTC,"They are probably asking people they have established friendly relations with already.  I've worked in a big office, and sometimes people sitting near each other barely know each other at all, so it doesn't make sense to randomly include nearby people.  Concentrate on getting to know the people that you have work contact with, and you'll be able to make lunch buddies.    How to get to know people:  Often there's idle chit-chat while waiting for meetings to start, which you can use to bring up personal stuff.  ""Do you know where to find the vacation request forms on the HR site?  I have to file the form today, because the trip I planned starts in exactly thirty days tomorrow.""  ""This damned meeting was supposed to start at three.  At this rate I'll have to tell my girlfriend to go to the movies without me.""  Often if you have interests at stake in an upcoming decision, you can identify people whose interests coincide with yours, and you can go talk to them about what you can do to get the decision to go your way.  That establishes you as natural allies, which will make it easier to segue into smalltalk.  Or if you frequently have to ask favors from someone, you can intentionally show up while they're busy, say, ""It's cool, I can wait,"" and sit by them until they're ready to help you.  They'll get used to having you around in a relaxed way, and you can take the time to discreetly look around their work space for conversation starters.  ""Are these your kids?""  ""Oh, cool, I love Terry Pratchett. I haven't read this one yet; is it good?""  EDIT:  Be careful not to annoy them while doing this.  Use your judgment.  A good way to start eating lunch with someone is to invite them to discuss something work-related over lunch.  This can be especially appropriate if it's something that requires discretion, like you are both trying to stop a higher-up from doing something misguided and don't want to be heard talking negatively about them.  Or if an 11am meeting starts to run past noon, say, ""I think we have a bunch more to talk about, but I don't want to skip lunch.  I don't really need my slides to explain ____; why don't we talk about it over lunch?"""

One of the girls comes in, and directly asks this woman if she wants a coffee. Completely ignores me. From that moment i took a dislike to her. I told one of my colleagues about it a while later and they were shocked. I'd feel mortified if I ever did something like exclude someone from a lunch run."
