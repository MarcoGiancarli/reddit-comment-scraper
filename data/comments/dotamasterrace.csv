You use the different reviewers excuse, but you should know what your peers have rated other games in the genre and take that into account.  Otherwise we end up with what we have here, which is HotS being higher rated than Dota 2, according to the same scale. So are you telling me that GI ratings are worthless and I shouldn't even compare two games in the same genre, rated by the same magazine?"

I always thought of you as a proponent of Dota 2, so it was surprising to see that you were the one that reviewed HotS and gave it a higher score than the GI Dota 2 review. At least you've come out and said you think Dota 2 is a 9.5, but it's still disappointing to not see that reflected in the official GI rating.

It goes like this:  0: (0% to 39%) - utterly rubbish 1: (40% to 65%) - bad, but not rubbish 2: (65% to 79%) - average 3: (80% to 89%) - good 4: (90% to 95%) - great! 5: (96% to 100%) - average, but hyped up a lot.  Indie games work on a different scale:  0: (0% to 39%) - shovelware 1: (40% to 65%) - rubbish  2: (65% to 75%) - average 3: (75% to 80%) - good 4: (80% to 85%) - great! 5: (86% to 100%) - rubbish.  I wish I was kidding with that last part, but I'm not. High-scoring indie games are nearly always games that do one thing differently and really well, but at the expense of the entire rest of the game (if it was a legitimately good idea, it could've been sold), but reviewers only care about that one ""innovation"". For example, Gamespot said ""To the Moon is a game you must play"" (actual quote) and only gave it an 80, while they gave Gone Home a 95.  Meanwhile, the actually amazing indie games, like Dwarf Fortress/Touhou/Cave Story/Nethack, never get reviewed. Ever. Ever."

dotamasterrace,3e1pzi,deaglefrenzy,4,Tue Jul 21 12:15:41 2015 UTC,Because the picks will be the same anyways. Also you don't want to double the snoozefest
dotamasterrace,3e1pzi,elitealpha,3,Tue Jul 21 08:56:39 2015 UTC,I never watch Worlds. Is Worlds grand final Bo1?
dotamasterrace,3e1pzi,GingerPow,4,Tue Jul 21 08:37:50 2015 UTC,"No, but hilariously, their world's is a single elimination (albeit BO5) tournament with one match played on each play day."

dotamasterrace,3e1pzi,a34fsd,2,Tue Jul 21 09:02:48 2015 UTC,So those 6 month groupstage decide the placement for their biggest tournament?  Lmao

dotamasterrace,3e1pzi,blazearmoru,2,Tue Jul 21 09:46:06 2015 UTC,The league format is a fucking a joke. 2 teams in the same region play 2 bo1 over an entire season before playoffs which have a bo3 then bo5 finals.

dotamasterrace,3dxmj8,erredece,3,Mon Jul 20 12:22:13 2015 UTC,well that´s a given :D which team do you think will win:)
dotamasterrace,3dxmj8,erredece,3,Mon Jul 20 12:23:10 2015 UTC,"Although Secret is the favourite and according to my compendium I'm rooting for them (I don't tend to root for teams, but instead enjoy watching good pro dota), one of the beauties of the International is, since the level is so high, any team can actually win, but only if they are the best.  Sure, there are bigger chances than others, I don't see Archon or Complexity wining precisely... but who thought that Newbee was going to win last year?"
dotamasterrace,3dxmj8,LILwhut,3,Mon Jul 20 12:28:29 2015 UTC,It's not really that difficult to think Newbee would win. They already got top 4 at TI3 (could have gotten higher if not for fountain hooking) and with Xiao8 on their team they would be even stronger. If not for fanboyism of already existing teams then these guys would have been one of the top contenders for predictions.
dotamasterrace,3dxmj8,erredece,2,Mon Jul 20 13:51:20 2015 UTC,"Very true, but people forgot that Newbee was basically TongFu, and they lacked a bit of practice against Western teams, hence their struggle on the first half of TI5."

dotamasterrace,3dxmj8,T_mpest,22,Mon Jul 20 13:33:17 2015 UTC,"Navi.   The date is June 27th 2014, and Valve have just released a statement about the Fnatic and Era incident. That's when Puppey comes up with a plan. ""If we try our hardest and win TI4 this year, there's no way we'll stand a chance in tournaments after next patch. Just look at what icefrog did to Alliance."" Puppey had tapped into the matrix and he could see how the events of TI4 and the following months would unfold. Newbee would win TI4, but xiao8 would retire, and the early game meta would be nerfed, so next year they wouldn't be as difficult to beat. DK would also disband and VG would not have enough time to form as a new cohesive unit. With these powerful eastern teams weakened after TI4 there was only one thing Puppey had to do to make sure he could win TI5. He had to make sure the Western teams were weak as well. He told the rest of Na'vi about this plan and Kuro agreed to go along with him to steal the best players from Fnatic and Alliance away from their teams. While the Dendi, XBOCT and Funn1k would steal players from Empire and other CIS teams. Puppey called his new super-squad Team Secret, though not even the other players knew why. Months later the TI5 invites come out. Team Secret have easily secured themselves an invite, while Na'Vi make it easily through the European qualifiers. ""All is going according to plan"", says Puppey. Now it is time for TI5, everyone is in Seattle. Kaci asks Puppey in an early interview what is his ""Secret""? ""Well I guess it's finally time to reveal it. The Secret is that I will be rejoining with Na'vi."" Everyone is shocked, outraged even. ""This can't be allowed"", they say, but Puppey explains how Valve states: ""When we invite a team of five players, we are in fact inviting those five players. Each of those players is allowed to control their participation in our tournament solely. To be clear, no, no one else can make the decision about participating in our event other than the player."" Everyone is upset, but there's nothing they can do, all five players for Na'vi technically had invites to TI5. In the group stages Na'vi easily take almost every game, only dropping matches to EG. Na'vi lose game 1 of the winner's bracket and fall to the losers bracket, but manage to easily beat the other teams and make it to the finals. ""Now it's time to show my real strats"", thinks Puppey. No one ever seen such drafting in the history of Dota. EG concedes each game before the horn blows. ""We just got out-drafted"", says Fear, ""gg wp"". The crowd begins to cheer, they had never seen such convincing games since the TI4 finals. They being to cheer ""USA, USA, USA."" Puppey, with a tear in his eye, accepts the Aegis of Champions and the check for 40 million dollars.   But honestly i think either vici, secret or eg would win. Could really go either way"

dotamasterrace,3dva1n,MesioticRambles,6,Mon Jul 20 00:43:55 2015 UTC,"Here's another list of excuses as to why we can't deliver on simple content with our one thousand person + staff at Riot Game.   1.The man-labor-hour is a myth. You will always lose efficiency with size. 2.Riot outsources almost nothing, while Valve outsources a lot. This leads to raw employee counts be incredibly misleading.   The list is mostly summed up by the fact supposedly 95% of those staff are working on chromas in MS Paint, 4% are working with ESports, 0.9% are making PR statements using their PhDs in Psychology, and 0.1% are 'fixing' bugs by adding more spaghetti to the boiler.   I get that you don't understand -why-, but chromas are actually harder work than you think, mostly because a bad chroma choice results in the same kinds of problems that not having a colorblind mode creates or what iBlitzcrank creates, where either some portions of the population simply can't tell what's going on or there's something legitimately abusable about the chroma that nobody will find until this one guy in Korean Challenger figures it out, makes a youtube video about it, and suddenly every buys the chroma and its happening in every game.   We can't put more prioritization on the plethora of bugs that plague every single game, quality of life changes, and especially not major game overhauls. We'll do our best to deliver minor ones at our convenience to appease you,   1.They do prioritize bugs. Remember that recall bug that just terrorized the system? Remember how Riot quickly locked down Ranked, removed MMR decay and fixed it? No? You're really really selective on your memory, man. 2.Lol, you call a major game overhaul in the HUD update a ""minor one"" just to make your point sound better. You're wrong, the HUD update, like all the other updates, comes bundled with them updating the underpinings associated with it. Let's also ignore the complete spell-missle rewrite, eh? Or the death recap fixes that have been going through, patch by patch, or all the other things I'm sure I could find if I actually bothered to open a patch notes while writing this.   but since we have no real competition anyways...   That's right. This, right here. Riot has no competition.  STILL  You say Riot's not living up to your expectations, but who is? Nobody else, that's for sure. So complain all you want that the industry leader isn't quite doing as much as you want them to, but you said it yourself, nobody else is either. At least Riot is trying.   Hah. What. He actually believes it to be true."
dotamasterrace,3dva1n,K1ngfisher,5,Sun Jul 19 23:44:16 2015 UTC,"I like how he takes everything as sarcasm until the last part about no competition. All I can imagine is a zombie saying ""no one else, only Riot"".    Yes, you always lose EFFICIENCY with size. It's the law of diminishing returns. But here's the thing, you shouldn't reach a point where adding an employee actually makes your overall production slower, if you ever reach this point, DON'T FUCKING HIRE THEM. Thus, by this logic, your 1000 employee company should still outperform Valve's 300 employee company, but it doesn't, therefore either your employees are incompetent, or your management is.  Wtf does Valve even outsource? They do all their art in-house, they do promotional stuff in-house, they make their game and technology in-house, the only thing they really outsource is stuff like voice work, motion capture, and music which is kinda how everyone does it. Also they do their physical publishing through EA.   Also, I lol'd at the stuff about Chromas. Oh no! You mean they have to sit down 15 or so colourblind-people that they'll statistically have working for them already, and then test the Chromas in like 4 different places (because the map is pretty samey in its colour scheme) to make sure the Champion is still readable, putting in like 20 minutes work per skin? What a nightmare! What do you mean the Riot culture is to spend 4-5 hours a day playing League already and they probably just do the testing in this time anyway?  As for competition, say what you like about Blizzard and HotS, but they're definitely keeping up with expectations on their client and features, their game might be ""baby's first Dota-clone"" but they're certainly doing more than the ""industry leader"" in the quality-of-life department. I don't think I even need to mention Dota with the constant fixes of even the tiny shit that's basically just petty nit-picking at this point.  Also, lol, the HUD was a ""major game overhaul"", I wasn't aware that changing position data was so difficult."
dotamasterrace,3dva1n,MesioticRambles,2,Mon Jul 20 01:47:27 2015 UTC,"Actually, for #1, there can be a point where having more staff work on a project just slow the project down. That having a team of 20 people who know what they are doing will get content out faster then a team of 200 people who are inexperienced, forcing the 20 original people to get stuck managing them rather then being productive (And a good worker does not always make a good manager).  For the outsourcing, I know they do outsource some game content (A local company here in Texas is contracted by Valve to make some TF2 content), but yeah, they do the bulk of their stuff in house."

So you're telling me you play Dota and can access voice chat and see that its just fine and the Toxic Avenger will not arrive because everything is awful?  So you play Smite, saw their incredibly amazing UI customization, and instead went with some shit tier UI skin that actually makes stats LESS accessible and isn't customizable AT ALL?  So you actually play HOTS and despite seeing a player base that enjoys leveling individual characters for rewards, decide that skin recolors are worth 5 bucks a pop, and champion mastery should have no reward?  This company is a fucking sham. They're drowning in cash and won't fix anything. It's a slap in the face to the player base, but their reaction is just to release more skins and new champions that are way overtuned until the first patch to make every dollar they possibly can. Ugh."

If you look at LoL, unlocking every character without paying would take literally thousands of hours. That's pay to win. If it takes, say, 10 hours to unlock each character in SFV i'd call that reasonable (keeping in mind the streetfighter series has far fewer characters than most MOBAs)."

dotamasterrace,3dvgak,hoppen1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:04:32 2015 UTC,"As someone who actively plays fighting games, the model itself is not necessarily a bad thing, but it's all going to come down to the specifics:  My first question is how much money characters are going to cost, both real money wise and fight money wise.  If the characters are in that $2 range that the updates in SF4 more or less worked out to, that's not too bad.  If they try and pull a HOTS and make characters cost $10 each, that doesn't work for me.  Likewise, if the fight money costs are attainable in a realistic amount of gameplay time (As in, if you keep playing you can just buy characters for fight money as they come out without grinding) this is clearly a benefit.   My second question sort of relates to the first, which would be if all characters are available in training mode, both for testing the character out pre-purchase and utilizing training mode for learning match-ups.  The bottom line is most fighting game players only main a few characters, but you DO need to be able to go in training mode and set up common situations against specific characters to learn correct punishes, how to block mixups and such.  If the prices are reasonable and training mode works as I hope it does, I'm completely ok with this model."

dotamasterrace,3dur48,Im_Heartless,2,Sun Jul 19 19:01:32 2015 UTC,"Dota teams have far more mixed member teams, though not with Koreans. Anyhow, it has a lot to do with discipline and dedication.  Skillwise, most Koreans aren't actually super far ahead of nonkoreans(though it comes with no surprise that a lot of the better mechanical players are Korean, though a large amount of the top players are Chinese).  However, if a coach tell the players to do something in game(say, pick antimage, buy nothing but wards and run around the map laughing), they will do it without question, and when the game is done tell you they thought it was terrible and then do whatever their coach tells them to try next.  This extends to listening to calls, where there is a lead shotcaller everyone listens to without question, leading to unity.  This is super beneficial and something lacking in the Chinese league scene, as well as the mess that is NA and EU. On top of that, Korean coaches are the best, easily.  Grabbing a Korean player with a Korean coach gives them somewhere to start with, and in theory, will motivate the other players to follow suit so they don't get replaced."
dotamasterrace,3dur48,Nihilisticglee,0,Sun Jul 19 19:01:00 2015 UTC,so you are saying that Koreans lack individual skill and thought. Thats exactly the things that secret for example use all the time.  Puppey may call the shots but everyone plays its own game on his own skill lvl and does what he thinks is needed.  I dont think that Arteezy and S4 always listen to the captain or that Kuro cares that much especially when on Rubick

Chinese are on par skillwise. And they have thoughts, and can articulate them clearly, which is why coaches discuss with players after games to get their thoughts.  However, there is no ""I don't like that hero, I am not going to play that hero,"" or ""I am better at this hero.""  You play the character for the comp, you play it to the best of your ability, and if the shot caller calls for something, you drop what you are doing(unless it is fighting someone 1v1 and do it). It is a more coordinated way to play, and optimizes the you is in charge of what.  Coach is in charge of strategy, shot caller in charge of tactics, players in charge of individual play."
dotamasterrace,3dur48,2dose,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:18:45 2015 UTC,"So,again,no individual thinking,they just follow the leader.  Most teams discuss together what hero they want to draft all the time.  A coach that tells players what to do seems to be pretty terrible."
dotamasterrace,3dur48,Kidday42,2,Sun Jul 19 19:28:51 2015 UTC,"It is strictly more efficient.  Rather than deal with players having to decide overall what the game plan is, and they typically decide drafts.  This keeps players focused on playing the best, and focused directly on the game. It is like in physical sports, players rarely decide on the overall game plan, that is the coach's job, while the captain decides the best overall course of action for that individual play, and the player to execute."

I would absolutely love a strong Korean DotA scene (like OGN for LoL), but Riot will probably try to hinder it from developing.

dotamasterrace,3drbwu,jaleCro,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:37:39 2015 UTC,It's not like the game is showing you what level the opponent has of a spell or how long it's on cooldown. It's literally just showing you shit you would see on a wiki.
dotamasterrace,3drbwu,NyaaFlame,25,Sun Jul 19 01:13:24 2015 UTC,This is one thing that threw me off when I tried LoL. How am I supposed to know what my opponent can do when I can't see their ability descriptions? Do I quickly alt-tab into the LoL wiki and type the champ name as fast as I can every time I see a new character? Or do they expect players to memorize the spells of every champion before they start playing?  Seeing the current cooldown and level of the abilities is unnecessary. But at least let us see their tooltips.
dotamasterrace,3drbwu,zuxtron,21,Sat Jul 18 19:04:13 2015 UTC,"The thing with LoL is, very few abilities are game changing enough to worry about. Just don't stand in the red circles and try to deal your dps efficiently, that's all the strategy you need until decently high ranks."

dotamasterrace,3drbwu,a34fsd,2,Sat Jul 18 19:47:17 2015 UTC,"One of the saving graces for me learning Dota2 from League has been being able to click on an enemy hero and be able to see what and ability it does, and the cd.   The only problem ins League would be how having such a thing would clutter the UI, but having the base information in game of an ability (mana cost, damage, cd, and what the ability does) is in no way a bad thing."

dotamasterrace,3ds3gp,Zephandrypus,28,Sat Jul 18 22:37:22 2015 UTC,"That's because they're all buying into the narrative that Riot has created saying that you can't trust that other players won't troll, say mean things or mess up your game unless features that can be abused in some way are all removed. But guess what... It's going to happen either way, somehow people will find a way to troll or be assholes if they want to do so.  This is the reason why abilities affecting your allies that can potentially be used in a bad way are sort of opt-in in League. For example Thresh has a lantern which he can throw out and allies can press to latch onto it and get pulled to his position, rather than letting him make the decision.  The community was also furious when they learned that Bard's ult(a mass eul's affecting all allies, enemies and structures) can potentially be abused. It turned out fine and now they're posting videos of how people can make amazing plays with it if used right.  Fast forward to the latest champion release, Tahm Kench, which has an ultimate that lets you go anywhere on the map and bring a team mate with you like Io. However this requires the consent of your team mate so they have to manually click you to go with you because ""there were uhh issues"" according to the Riot devs. Once again another example of Riot taking away the power to do creative things because they have to protect the players who they consider to be poor little sheep.  Today too one of the main reasonings Lyte stated that voice chat wasn't a good idea in League is that it could potentially be used for people to flame, and that when that happens the damage is already done muting would be useless.  Basically Riot's philosophy is to strip away all powers from their players because they think they are little babies who need to be protected. It sickens me."
dotamasterrace,3ds3gp,zodiaclawl,9,Sat Jul 18 23:33:11 2015 UTC,"Couldn't have said it better myself. Lyte's a hack, everyone fears potential abuse, everyone screams about voice chat ""muh toxicity "" etc.  Honestly. What a joke."
dotamasterrace,3ds3gp,weschaos,3,Sun Jul 19 01:06:27 2015 UTC,"The more I see this shit the more I wonder if it's justified. I mean, maybe the League community is legitimately just not mature enough to handle shit like voice chat or ""potentially abusable abilities"" as a whole. Look at how childishly people seem to respond to criticisms or issues, and just look at how religiously people defend Riot. For once they might actually be justified in changing a hero to fit their playerbases crippling immaturity.  I'm not even saying Dota's community is hyper mature and reasoned. They're also seemingly a bunch of cunts and dumbasses, but I've never seen a Pudge hook someone badly on purpose (they're just that bad), and I've only ever seen a void team chrono intentionally once. I'd venture to say that 985 of the time I see any ability used to troll it's by my own friends for shits and giggles, because I'll be damned if playing soccer with one of your mates as ES isn't fun."

Like, you know what also doesn't make sense? Getting gold only on last hit. I mean, lore wise in Dota, it's some king or whatever who decreed that whoever dealt the killing blow would get the spoils, but that's just to make up for a weird gameplay mechanic. The more likely idea is that gold is dropped upon death, so why is that gold only given to the guy who got the last hit, and why can't they choose to share it? Because it adds gameplay depth.  So no one really questions last hitting as a mechanic, yet somehow League peasants have a problem with getting the last hit on your own teammate or creep who were going to die anyway in order to prevent the last hit gold going to the enemy team? How does that logic even fly?"

dotamasterrace,3dqu5d,Gahron,2,Sun Jul 19 11:46:00 2015 UTC,If at the beginning of the game the pH of the chat is 5.5 they can.
dotamasterrace,3dqu5d,smaili13,5,Sat Jul 18 18:51:11 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah, Lyte to the rescue!  I like how he tries to twist the car analogy in his favor:   In your car analogy, they also introduced features like seat belts to make driving a safer experience when stuff does happen.   Well yeah. Seat belts are a reactive measure to the risks while driving. If only there was some reactive measure to deal with assholes. You know, like a mute button... The technology just isn't there yet I guess.  Also his ""driving test"" analogy, do you want players to fill out a psychological test before they will be let into the game now?  But honestly while I think Lyte believes the shit he says the real reason for stuff like this not existing is that implementing voice comms might brek recalls or some shit like that."

dotamasterrace,3dqu5d,Shaella_,5,Sat Jul 18 20:33:23 2015 UTC,Mad props to Lyte for doing a lot of PR for Dota 2 and CS:GO in that thread with his piss poor arguments. Cheers buddy.
dotamasterrace,3dqu5d,zodiaclawl,3,Sat Jul 18 20:47:56 2015 UTC,What's he even talking about. It's impossible to stop people being assholes. This whole notion of reforming players is the dumbest shit ever.
dotamasterrace,3dqu5d,webuiltthisschmidty,3,Sat Jul 18 16:17:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've ever heard someone flame in voice chat in Dota. It's always text. I think they feel voice is too personal, text feels more anonymous.  That's 3400 hours of Dota, zero voice chat flame. And mic spammers are very rare too, maybe one every 50+ games."
dotamasterrace,3dqu5d,g0kartmozart,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:08:55 2015 UTC,"To be completely fair, his primary argument is that voice chat increases flaming in text-based communication (between those who opt out and those who opt in) rather than just voice chat having more flaming."
dotamasterrace,3dqu5d,Catfish017,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:26:14 2015 UTC,"That depends on your definition of ""flame"", like for most people on the internet, if you get called an idiot now and then or whatever, you just won't actually give a fuck. You can just mute or just realize that some indirect insults by a random person on the internet really holds no value whatsoever.  But I guess quotes like ""WTF!?"" ""OMFG"" ""FUCK"" etc. Would completly hurt their feelings.  You obv can't have a context in a fucking teamgame where you fuck up and get called out for it. Thats TOXIC, duhh."
dotamasterrace,3dqu5d,xxxcancer_,3,Sun Jul 19 18:17:48 2015 UTC,"If the team has mixed communication (some players in voice, some players in chat), then the actual text chat in the game became up to 126% more toxic, and the voice chat players received up to 50% more reports even though the other players didn't necessarily know the players were in voice.   And that's why the study is completely flawed and useless for seeing how built in voice chat would turn out, because with built in voice chat everyone on the team will know and hear when someone is using voice. 3rd party voice chat splits up a team. You have the party using voice outside of game, and the party that is using chat. Obviously when both groups aren't openly communicating with each other, there's going to be subpar communication and conflict.  The statistic is also crap because all the good chat that would have been in text was probably communicated through voice instead which would skew the kind of chat left in text to be more toxic.   2) In an external study by a university, they did an experiment where a female and male voice used voice chat and said the exact same phrases; in this study they found out that the female voice received 300% more harassment than the male voice.   And why should that prevent them from adding a voice chat feature? 90% of their players are probably male anyway, and if females find themselves getting harassed, then they don't have to use voice chat. Their experience wouldn't be any different, because they don't have voice now. The only thing that would change is that the people who want to use voice chat will now be able to. It's a completely opt-in feature, so to not add it because by using it some players will get harassed makes no sense."

I mean music is really easy to see if its copyrighted or not!    and    Better hope they actually acquired the rights to use his stuff.

dotamasterrace,3dpb6m,hrsetyono,3,Sat Jul 18 04:48:21 2015 UTC,Correct me if I'm wrong but don't the organizations these teams fall under get a chunk of the money?
dotamasterrace,3dpb6m,Mr-Irrelevant-,6,Sat Jul 18 04:02:46 2015 UTC,"I understand 10% was the rumour for NewBee, I think other teams take 20%.  Other teams like Team Secret,  I am not sure they give cuts at all. They probably pay their manager a salary or a small commission, but I am sure they have a better deal for themselves than if they were with an organization, specially as the winning team they are."
dotamasterrace,3dpb6m,Gahron,4,Sat Jul 18 04:23:13 2015 UTC,yes.
dotamasterrace,3dpb6m,K1ngfisher,6,Sat Jul 18 04:13:07 2015 UTC,Valve always pays the players though. What depends on the contract happens later.
dotamasterrace,3dpb6m,Gahron,7,Sat Jul 18 04:19:21 2015 UTC,Thats a longer answer.

dotamasterrace,3drf05,dasstefan,6,Sat Jul 18 20:05:17 2015 UTC,I think it's an advertisement from Garena though who are and were in charge of League in SEA.

Riot commissioned new art for the subreddit, apparently Blizzard does the same for all their subs. 4/shady"
dotamasterrace,3drf05,OhZordan,0,Mon Jul 20 13:45:12 2015 UTC,"The only thing you stated that's propaganda is the Random 1 day old accounts.   Propaganda is information, idea's or rumours that are spread to try to either help or harm an individual, organization or country or similar.  One such example is the frequent studies that are released by Riot regarding things such as voice chat, toxicity or other such issues. There's never any sources cited, and many of the figures seem sketchy even to those they're directed at."
dotamasterrace,3drf05,Gigglybutt,3,Sat Jul 18 19:30:07 2015 UTC,Propaganda is ALSO supression of different opinions/ censorship. So that includes reddit moderation and all the tournament influences.
dotamasterrace,3drf05,_LordErebus_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:44:36 2015 UTC,"You beat me to it, thanks."
dotamasterrace,3drf05,kerbonklin,-1,Sat Jul 18 20:08:54 2015 UTC,"It's actually not, but okay.   Suppression and Censorship both have their own role to play in trying to twist the way one thinks, and can be used hand in hand with propaganda which is as I stated, Information, Idea's, or Rumours that are spread to either hurt or help organizations, individuals, countries etc.   This really isn't that difficult to look up either."
dotamasterrace,3drf05,Gigglybutt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:51:40 2015 UTC,"Actually censorship / cutting of other opinions IS part of the whole thing. And yes, i did lok it up just now to be sure.  Copying from wiki (yes idc its good enough source): ""  by presenting facts selectively (perhaps lying by omission) to encourage a particular synthesis, or using loaded messages to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information presented. "" Censorship is part of the process of presenting facts SELECTIVLY. Only wanted news get published, all other chains of thought get supressed / cut out."
dotamasterrace,3drf05,_LordErebus_,-1,Sun Jul 19 01:03:44 2015 UTC,"Using wiki as a reliable source.  mfw  I'm going by the definition, and not trying to skew it's meaning. Propaganda does not fit into any of your definitions, though like I said.. Things you've stated are often used hand in hand to achieve similar results or to supplement eachother.   Propaganda would be a Media outlet, Government, Group or Individual spreading Rumours, Information or Idea's in a direct manner to influence change  of the opinion of society on the matter at hand. A great example of this is North Korea and their 'great leader, glorious leader', their heavily modified school curriculum all aimed at enforcing a positive light on their leader, The radios put into their homes that can't be turned off, only turned down, constantly spewing praises towards their leader.    Going by Wikipedia since you like it so much, Censorship is the suppression of speech, public communication or other information which may be considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, politically incorrect or inconvenient as determined by governments, media outlets, authorities or other groups or institutions. Again, North Korea is an excellent example of this. They censor internet for those that can use it(which is like 300 people or something stupid like that), they censor outside news or viewpoints, or cultures. They censor school literature to keep people in the dark. They censor people that try to put the leader in a bad light, make them disappear to those work camps they love so much. Out of sight, out of mind.   Their main intents are different. One is actively looking to portray something in a good/bad light to help influence peoples opinions, the other is actively trying to block out something that may already be portraying something in a good/bad light.   Propaganda for instance, can be censored. So how is it that Propaganda can include censorship? Can they work together? Fuck yes. It is not part of Propaganda however."
dotamasterrace,3drf05,Gigglybutt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:16:31 2015 UTC,So far you still brabble bullshit instead of giving a better source. So far wiki will remain better then nothing. And i wont do more searching at 4 am.

dotamasterrace,3dn54e,LokiaScythe,2,Sat Jul 18 09:20:55 2015 UTC,"I think there are no turnrates as code in the game, everything just faces instantly, but if you applied the term to units, it'd be infinite… same as heroes in Dota 2 have infinite acceleration."

dotamasterrace,3dn54e,LokiaScythe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:36:31 2015 UTC,"Not sure you understood what I said. I didn't bash Riot, and neither did I bash DotA. It's questionable if an implementation of unit acceleration would add anything to the game, but turn rates do. However, if you apply the term to a game that doesn't implement them, the rates are infinite."
dotamasterrace,3dn54e,DamnThatsLaser,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:48:43 2015 UTC,"Kind of the thing. I misunderstood your comment as a joke on riot's coding, which it kind of sounded like, folowing this thread. So I tried to make that spirit obvious to you. Edit: it actually does have a practically 0 turnrate number, or does it?"
dotamasterrace,3dn54e,LokiaScythe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:32:14 2015 UTC,"A turnrate of 0 would mean units wouldn't turn at all, meaning they'd face the same direction all the time. An infinite turnrate means units turn instantly. Not having a turnrate results in units behaving like with an infinite turnrate."
dotamasterrace,3dn54e,DamnThatsLaser,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:12:53 2015 UTC,"Then, dota 2 has an insanely high number as turn rate? Because idk for sure but chimps still turn just a tinsy bit.

dotamasterrace,3dn54e,LtLabcoat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:35:55 2015 UTC,"Man, why do people here keep forgetting that game modes are level-gated in Dota?"
dotamasterrace,3dn54e,Bit-Bi-Bit,2,Sat Jul 18 01:01:29 2015 UTC,"Because All pick, the most played and most relevant public gamemode is unlocked from the second your account is created. Also because the only relevant game mode locked behind a level gate is ranked, which having locked for a short time serves a dual purpose: to make players aware of the most basic functions of the game before taking to ranked, where people take the games much more seriously since there is an inherent value to each win/loss; and to make it less convenient to make a smurf account for ranked, which is appropriate since there's very little reason for an alternative ranked account since there are no region locks."
dotamasterrace,3dn54e,Gametendo,0,Sat Jul 18 02:52:51 2015 UTC,"Possibly because those ""gated contents"" actually serve more like a tutorial so players don't jump into matched when they have no idea what they're doing.

I would recommend checking highest hits from YouTube search.  If you want to know his influence, basically everybody from EDM trends of the past 5 years or so is taking inspiration from him. He is also one of the reasons EDM and dubstep started leaking into current pop music."

dotamasterrace,3dom59,PubstarHero,0,Sun Jul 19 01:02:38 2015 UTC,"Deadmau5 has made a number of my favourite EDM tracks, but he has also made a lot that just annoy the crap out of me (""Hi Friend"" being the worst offender). I'm sitting on the fence about this one, if it's good, I'll definitely buy it. But I'm not so sure his music style will really fit that of Dota, at least not in-game, maybe in the menus.  We really need to consider that you can't just take existing music and shove it together and expect it to be a good music pack. There's an atmosphere and timing that Dota requires for a music pack to make sense. The music has to be like the music to a movie, it has to add to the scene, not be the star of the show. I just hope that Deadmau5 understands that."
dotamasterrace,3dom59,gyulababa,5,Sat Jul 18 01:18:19 2015 UTC,EDM   This abbreviation is the MOBA of music.   Electronic Dance Music?! That covers pretty much everything...
dotamasterrace,3dom59,MesioticRambles,3,Sat Jul 18 07:55:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's electronic music made to be danced to in clubs. As opposed to shit like Skrillex's  ""music"" that you can't dance to, EDM has a consistent beat, and is generally not too fast. And it's nothing like MOBA which can describe just about describe any game played online. EDM is completely different from Jazz (so descriptive), Blues (so descriptive), Reggae(so descriptive) . Hint:MOBA was a shitty term because it was being used to describe a single game when existing names were already more descriptive, not because the name wasn't inherently descriptive. I mean, fuck, RTS is a term used to describe games like Total War and Starcraft, but it could also be used to describe most competitive games played in real time, like Street Fighter and CS:GO,  they too involve strategy.   There's a point where your genre labels stop being useful and start being material for those who want to wank over how much they know about music. There will ALWAYS be more specific labels and subgenres for EVERYTHING, learn to choose which level of specificity is useful."
dotamasterrace,3dom59,gyulababa,3,Sat Jul 18 10:02:35 2015 UTC,"Skrillex's ""music"" that you can't dance you to   broseph i'm sorry but half-time 4/4 beats is the easiest thing to dance to. Skrillex literally never varies beat structure. If you wanna hate on him, hate him for misappropriating the term ""dubstep."""
dotamasterrace,3dom59,PubstarHero,2,Sat Jul 18 18:04:30 2015 UTC,"Alright, my mistake. You're right, the beat's always there, but it's the constant changing in screeches and shit that throws me off. You can dance to it, but I sure hell don't want to because it takes far more concentration than it's worth. Just let me go back to salsa.  Also yeah, I remember looking up a couple years ago what dubstep actually was in the early 00's and it wasn't too bad, cue Skrillex and it went to shit."
dotamasterrace,3dom59,tepellin_10,2,Sun Jul 19 01:27:41 2015 UTC,"EDM is the new ""Techno"".  It's used to describe anything from DnB to House music, but unlike calling everything Techno (which actually is its own genre), EDM has absolutely no description at all.  Time to break into my old elitist asshole mode.  Simple ""Major"" Genres:   Trance: Four To The Floor (FTTF - Bass drum on every beat, 4/4 time signature), usually between 120-140BPM (140BPM area is either Old Skool Hardcore or Full-On Trance territory).  Heavily driven by synths and melodies. House: FTTF Drums, 120-140 BPM, heavily driven by grooves (Bass+Drums) Techno: FTTF Drums, Any BPM really below 160 (Any higher and you start hitting weird shit like Terrorcore, Splittercore, etc.).  Driven mostly by percussion, any other instruments are secondary to the main drum groove. Breaks: 4/4 Time Signature, but NOT FTTF (Off beat kick drums).  Up to 140-160BPM.  Usually very heavy on percussion and bass. Drum 'n Bass/Jungle: Fast breaks.  Not much to say here. Hardcore:  What happens when you make Trance or House music at 170BPM+  Some weird fucks make Techno at this speed, and I have no idea how many drugs you have to be on to make it worth listening to.   EDM covers all of these genres to the layman.  Its basically like calling everything from The Beach Boys to Slayer ""Rock 'n Roll"".  Of course, if you want to know what I listen to, I can tend to be a potential ass and tell you thinks like Tech House (Dear god yes), Nu Disco, Freeform (which is fucking amazing - Psytrance at 180BPM), French House, and Schranz.  Normally I tell people I'm just into House and Hardcore.  EDM is just such a stupid thing to call electronic music that is ""Danceable"""
dotamasterrace,3dom59,MesioticRambles,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:54:33 2015 UTC,"you can't dance to   I can dance to anything with 3/4 or 4/4.   EDM is completely different from Jazz, Blues, Reggae   Yes because those are not electronic genres.   Electronic Music you can Dance to: EuroDisco ,Trance ,Dub ,Dubstep ,Drum&Bass ,Jungle ,Electroswing ,Hardstyle ,Hardcore ,Techno ,Progressive ,Nightcore  I probably missed a lot and didn't wanted to go into sub-genres but you should get the idea.   IMO EDM is too generic much like MOBA.   But they couldn't name the genre ""good old tunes recycled into club music"" much like Rito didn't want to name it Dota-clone."
dotamasterrace,3dom59,makochi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:54:45 2015 UTC,"As I said, wanking over how much you know about music genres. And yes I listed non-electronic music because you said EDM could describe ""all music"" which was clearly wrong. I wasn't trying to differentiate the genre Deadmau5 was in, I assumed that most people know who he is and what his music is like,  and if they don't, they definitely won't know the difference between techno and nightcore. These genres haven't been around for a very long time, and guess what, if you don't sit around the electronic music community talking about it, then the only music from that list that is going to make any inherent sense is electroswing,  and they'll probably have name recognition for dubstep. Most genres don't make inherent sense, so what the fuck is the point of naming specific ones if they're not going to know what it means?  Like seriously, if you want to rag on someone saying EDM once, go to a subreddit for it, this is almost like going to a knitting sub where a nice lady mentions their son's new car and posts a picture of him with it and then raging at them because it's not just a car, it's a Mitsubishi mx6 or whatever.  What I'm trying to say is, I don't give enough of a fuck to learn the specific type of music, most stuff I like is some sort of infusion anyway so what even is the point. Most people don't care about music genres in the same way they don't care about the difference between x86 and ARM CPUs, they'll just say ""processor"" and be done with it, because it doesn't matter to them and does not affect their lives."

It sure is a shame that Riot design Champions around potential abuse, instead of putting trolls in a special place around the legitimate players. Some sort of special queue for games. Make it lower priority too so that they don't take up much server time. A ""low priority queue"" if you will.

dotamasterrace,3dntx4,Shardj,2,Fri Jul 17 22:10:34 2015 UTC,Watch it...that is why this sub is here...the peasantry is strong in this video my friend.
dotamasterrace,3dntx4,Cvsen,2,Fri Jul 17 22:17:19 2015 UTC,i just paused the video at that moment to look for this comment
dotamasterrace,3dntx4,Kaggbrazze,20,Sat Jul 18 11:48:36 2015 UTC,So this is  basically a smite promotion in the end?
dotamasterrace,3dntx4,Damanos,15,Fri Jul 17 20:51:33 2015 UTC,Yes. And its fucking stupid
dotamasterrace,3dntx4,Gahron,7,Fri Jul 17 21:18:08 2015 UTC,man i don't know im prettysure after watching like 5-10 of his videos hes abit of a shill
dotamasterrace,3dntx4,LtLabcoat,5,Fri Jul 17 21:23:40 2015 UTC,"Well, they did do a rather fair debate between Dota and League. But he really does do that Extra Credits thing of featuring LoL more often than other games.  Although never as bad as EC's ""balance is a failure of the game designer"" moment."
dotamasterrace,3dntx4,MesioticRambles,13,Sat Jul 18 01:07:50 2015 UTC,"Ha, you call that debate fair? It's basically the Dota guy making points about shit that matters, and dealing like 4 damage, and the LoP guy making a fart noise and dealing 25 damage. The whole thing was contrived as fuck and was quite clearly biased to all hell."
dotamasterrace,3dntx4,Gahron,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:05:44 2015 UTC,"yes but this is a debate about Esports and i don't recall him even mentioning cs:go yet he mentions smite and LoL. CS:GO has probably the most noteworthy esports system for whats going ""right"" at the moment. Hype is fairly stable throughout the year and there isn't oversaturation. I think 2015 for dota has been alot better than mid-late 2014 in saturation as well."
dotamasterrace,3dntx4,Cvsen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:17:04 2015 UTC,"He is comparing NBA finals to Lop finals...Say what you want about Lop but the pesantry is global.Why not Fifa World Cup and Lop ?(and that's not even mentioning the troll bots riot has on its LCS matches...) This video was a dissapointment.The only way I can justify it is if he took money...from high rez...not riot...or maybe bouth:)) .HR pays the vacation ,riot the plane tickets?"
dotamasterrace,3dntx4,Gahron,4,Sat Jul 18 05:12:34 2015 UTC,"it was poorly researched tbh, or rather he didn't research enough."

dotamasterrace,3dntx4,Fishqu,7,Fri Jul 17 21:24:22 2015 UTC,"Horrible episode, but the way worst was the one in which he talked about colors in competitive games, mainly red and blue. TF2, Halo - fine, LoL - are you fucking kidding me? That was pure peasantry..."
dotamasterrace,3dntx4,Proud2bTryhard,2,Fri Jul 17 23:53:47 2015 UTC,"GT quoted studies claiming aggressive colors, especially red, would skew the win percentage up to 55-45 discrepancy in favor of the red, between equally skilled opponents. Personally I think there's a lot of confirmation bias in those studies and the samples are to small to carry any meaning."
dotamasterrace,3dntx4,MesioticRambles,5,Sat Jul 18 01:16:00 2015 UTC,"TL;DW ""Can you tell that I've got a hard on for LoL and I'm being paid by Hi-Rez to promote Smite?"".  Let's not mention the $11million prize pool for TI4 (but we will mention the LCS prize pool). Let's not mention CS:GO basically being the pinnacle of e-sports right now. Or how Dota and CS:GO together beat out the next top 98 played games combined in peak player count for that day on Steam.  But no, forget CS:GO and Dota. League of Legends and Smite are the only esports being played. Even though I have literally not heard anyone so much as mention Smite since 2012 outside of ""fuck Hi-Rez for ditching Tribes:Ascend""."

dotamasterrace,3dntx4,ActionJezus,3,Sat Jul 18 04:43:35 2015 UTC,"I don't know which video is worse. This one or the ""deadlock"" where he debate's which is better, LoP to DOTA."
dotamasterrace,3dntx4,Aelvez,2,Sat Jul 18 04:28:53 2015 UTC,"It's a popular console peasant channel. Since Smite is releasing on consoles, it is a common business practice to pay these guys to promote your game."
dotamasterrace,3dntx4,K1ngfisher,2,Fri Jul 17 23:09:01 2015 UTC,Hey! They're showing the pre 6.82 dota map
dotamasterrace,3dntx4,wooflsch,2,Sat Jul 18 02:43:34 2015 UTC,Can't stand listening to this guy talk about most things anymore. He just starts flapping his lips about LoP in every video and i just zone out. Which saddens me as i've been a loyal theorist for quite some time now.
dotamasterrace,3dntx4,Suqaa,4,Sat Jul 18 04:39:27 2015 UTC,:/ but i liked this guy :(
dotamasterrace,3dntx4,Cvsen,7,Sat Jul 18 06:28:54 2015 UTC,"Me two...we have to get over it....but the quality of this episode was lackluster... And thats even when I put aside my D-pride.Nba finals were a joke choosing the 2-3rd final with heats when people allready hated them.I think he compared nba finals to lol world?Nba is mostly american sorry...I am pretty sore world cup football(soccer) finals is way more watched than nba final...since people watch lop finals globally. Pc shittalk was lame...with bouth whats inside better rigs and playing with friends and comparison to consoles...I could go on and on...And not even...ugh...mention the ""other dotalikes"" or the comments..."
dotamasterrace,3dntx4,Suqaa,-1,Fri Jul 17 21:40:11 2015 UTC,"he fanboyed LoL totally. I like smite so i dont have a problem against that but it wont be a REALLY big esports i think. he didnt even mention TI and he said ""and your dotas"". agreed this episode had NO content at all.

Was playing Kogmaw (core) mid, but I was buying magic armor pen instead of AP (raw damage), so I was building off-meta. After the game, we had a small argument, recorded the last part. Activate subtitles.  I don't really understand how people can get this mad over a simple game. It's pretty crazy.."
dotamasterrace,3dqp7h,barrettfc,3,Sat Jul 18 15:09:30 2015 UTC,"It's the mentality they have. Winning is everything. If they're not winning the game isn't fun. Then they have to try to find a scapegoat to blame and vent on for them not having fun.  I'd much rather have fun in the game regardless of winning or not. It's good enough to be in a close back and forth game, but the problem with League is that these are almost non-existent because of the balance of the game. Normally whoever is up 10% gold at 10 minutes wins 80% of the time. It's less about skill or plays, and more about sheer stats, especially thanks to those stat sticks. DotA has substantially more back and forth, which is why I feel people are less butthurt about losing, so long as the game was enjoyable, and it has many chances to be enjoyable compared to League, which normally turns into a stomp, and then frustration."
dotamasterrace,3dqp7h,DamnThatsLaser,3,Sat Jul 18 15:13:05 2015 UTC,Well there is no way to have fun in that game so i guess winning is the only thing to do unless you like losing.
dotamasterrace,3dqp7h,barrettfc,2,Sat Jul 18 16:45:59 2015 UTC,Winning IS everything. Except in league there is only 1 way to win. It's why I don't play that game.
dotamasterrace,3dqp7h,DamnThatsLaser,2,Sat Jul 18 15:32:23 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I catch myself in that mindset, and it's actually wrong.  Trying everything to win is actually everything. Sometimes you do and sometimes it just doesn't cut it. Maybe your opponent is better, maybe your mates jinxed it, maybe you screwed up. But I have also had losses where I thought I played pretty well and if you learned from that game, you should view it as a good game.  Implying that a game you lose is a bad game would mean 50% of all games played are bad."
dotamasterrace,3dqp7h,K1ngfisher,2,Sat Jul 18 20:59:48 2015 UTC,Any game you play without the intent to win is a bad game.
