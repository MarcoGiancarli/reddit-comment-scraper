If he was with HER for 9 years, he wouldn't have the butterflies either.  My husband and I have been together coming up on 9 years. When I see him, I don't get giddy. I don't get butterflies and my heart doesn't leap into my throat. I DO see my best friend in the world. The one I can tell anything to. The one I trust and love with every fiber of my being. The one I share my happiness and sadness with and that is so much better than new love flutters.  I feel like you have a really good outlook on this. Not so many others would be understanding. I second what stln00b says about him cutting off contact with her and you two starting couple's therapy and hopefully rekindling the relationship.  I wish you two the very best!"

relationship_advice,3e2owa,Bab2385,24,Tue Jul 21 21:46:11 2015 UTC,"I think this is an important observation. Love doesn't mean that butterflies need to stay. I've always found they're there as an excitement and thrill in the beginning, but I much prefer the comfort and love and... its like a warmth that comes with time."
relationship_advice,3e2owa,Bibbityboo,26,Tue Jul 21 20:32:11 2015 UTC,"Couples Therapy.   Even if you don't change a thing immediately, get to a therapist and work on building this great communication breakthrough into a habit. While the news is terrible, it's a big deal that he opened up and you two could be honest.   He's feeling something called New Relationship Energy.   It's a high. Eventually it'll end. Have him look it up and understand that. It may not save your marriage, but he needs to understand that even this other woman is going to normalize. A relationship is what begins after the NRE wears off.  I wish you both the best and a life of happiness, the next phase is going to be a little rough but you can get through it."
relationship_advice,3e2owa,GotnoVoodoo,8,Tue Jul 21 16:02:32 2015 UTC,I want to give you something to think about.   I am willing to bet he did not start feeling dissatisfied with your marriage UNTIL he met the new girl. Now he is looking for an excuse.
relationship_advice,3e2owa,notevenapro,10,Tue Jul 21 16:32:47 2015 UTC,"I am so sorry. This just suck in all ways. I've been with my husband for 14 years this October. The butterflies come and go. It happens with the natural progression of the relationship. I hate that society through music and movies really only tells the story of how to get together and not how to stay together though the years. Very few stories or songs talk about what to do when the butterflies are gone but you still love each other. I wish there were more. I think there would be less ""excitement chasers"" and more people who really understood the longevity of true love. Again, I'm sorry. He screwed up big time and he's not seeing clearly. Yes, I would stay at my parents for awhile if I were in your shoes and get some perspective. He certainly needs it whether you do or not. But you  need to have some space and time to figure out how you want to proceed regardless of what he wants."
relationship_advice,3e2owa,smileycat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:01:53 2015 UTC,"Hooray for another classic case of grasd is greener syndrome.   To expect to constantly feel those butterflies 9 years on is frankly, naive of him. The brain chemistry involved just doesn't produce those addictive chemicals after a while. Usually people deal with this in the first year.  Counselling and therapy is probably a good idea. Is he really going to throw his life away, 9 years of shared experience, because he doesn't get butterflies? Hopefully he comes to his senses and puts the effort into dating you again. In a steady relationship those butterfly feelings are supposed to fluctuate, as the deeper bonds and love really take over. Unfortunately some people find the transition scary and end up infatuated with someone new."

I stopped feeling that way a long time ago, and it took a while, but I got passed it. But he met someone on 9Chat in May and started talking to her, and really likes her. She gives him that feeling that I no longer do. He loves me, and he really likes her. I know that she lives in Maine (not at all local).   Seems pretty clear to me."
relationship_advice,3e2owa,stln00b,5,Tue Jul 21 16:57:57 2015 UTC,(not at all local).   Seems pretty clear to me it is more of a forbidden fantasy kind of thing than an actual 'checking out'.

He is finding out that feelings for your life partner will go through stages. Let him know you understand and can identify. I guess all you can ask him to do is to stay honest and not to cross the line, whatever rules you have concerning other people. I suggest getting back to dating. If he wants to work it, which will include stopping this fantasy ride he is on and stop what he is doing. ..... Good luck!"
relationship_advice,3e2owa,daddydearest_1,9,Tue Jul 21 15:39:24 2015 UTC,"You have a much more mature outlook on marriage.

Commitment in times when those feelings somewhat fade is the key, like the rising and falling of the waves, you two should be able to ride it together."
relationship_advice,3e2xqo,loosingmymindfast,95,Tue Jul 21 15:33:40 2015 UTC,OK OK OK.  I was reading this and thinking to myself that you could work this through even if she wanted so much dick that was not yours. I mean you could have an open relationship or whatever.   Then I got to the physical abuse and you could hear the tires screech to a halt.   Your marriage is 100% over and you need help. This is far above our pay grade here. You are an abused spouse that thinks they still want to be with their abuser. You need professional therapy stat.
relationship_advice,3e2xqo,notevenapro,19,Tue Jul 21 16:06:11 2015 UTC,"This! I am non monogamous and was mentally wording a kind response to help the husband understand the situation and suddenly there are pills involved and punches are being thrown.   OP there are two very different things going on:   -Your wife cannot cope with the disability of your child. At all. You guys need help - ideally yesterday. She needs therapy and you need to see if there is a service that can take some of the stress from you.   -Your wife is cheating. Possibly as a mini holiday from her life she can not cope with, possibly because she isn't monogamous at heart. You need to find out which one it is.   However before you even begin dealing with this, you need to realise she assaulted you. She attacked you. She got violent. Yes, she is under extreme stress, but this should never be the answer. If this is completely out of character it might even be worth checking she hasn't had a psychotic break with a doctor. Until then though she needs to be away from the children and you."

relationship_advice,3e2xqo,Newmie,18,Tue Jul 21 16:56:28 2015 UTC,"But the reality is she isn't just a nice person. She is also selfish and a cheater. She is someone who willingly broke her promise and demands you to not.   It doesn't matter that she is amazing to other people. She physically abused you while you were vulnerable, cheated on you,  then told you she will not stop.  She's pretty terrible to you and not stellar to the children she promised to be a mother too.   Her coping skills suck.  And don't think I'm saying this  condescendingly. I have terrible coping skills and have reacted to stress by fucking everything in sight even while getting regular sex by a partner.  She chose to do that.  She chose to hit you.  She chooses to neglect her other kids.    I hope the sex is worth that."

Even if it was an act of attempted suicide or a cry for help, it was an extremely selfish one. She is violent and also doesnt care about your marriage boundaries even though you're actually okay with occasional extramarital activities! She is not an amazing person. You're just amazingly blind to it."

You can't save her, and ending the relationship will harm the children even more. So either call a lawyer, or take care of you and the kids and let her go, by living your own life too. I know people that do this, it stops the big mess divorce makes."
relationship_advice,3e2xqo,king1124,8,Tue Jul 21 15:47:41 2015 UTC,"I appreciate that.  When I said in marriage counseling that I could no longer make a promise to my wife to be faithful, as a way to cope with the situation, my wife said she could not accept that and would leave me if I did not still promise to be faithful. To be clear, I was not telling her I was going to cheat, I was just retracting my promise. Marriage counselor told her straight up that was the craziest thing she ever heard.  I know how fucked up that is.  Also, despite how fucked up things are now she is an amazing person, and beautiful, and has an amazing body and sexual appetite.  Any woman would be a downgrade in my opinion."

I say call her bluff. If she wants to continue outside sex, then you will too... At least you will know which way to go. If she relents, then you have her back, if she agrees to split, then you also know. Time to call her bluff"
relationship_advice,3e2xqo,link_luster,6,Tue Jul 21 16:07:26 2015 UTC,Wtf?!?! Any woman would be a downgrade?  Are you fucking serious?  She's not amazing.  Quit lying to yourself.

relationship_advice,3e2xqo,RevisedThoughts,-1,Tue Jul 21 20:30:58 2015 UTC,"I have been hanging out this sub too long. Mostly because I have relationship problems of my own so, in a way, it almost felt cathartic.   I am coming to some conclusions about marriage that are not good at all. I am finding that it doesn't matter how well you are matched (you can pretty much forget about it if you are not) initially...It doesn't matter what you go through with another person (the trips, the experiences, the children, the pets, the homes et.c), in the end because we humans change with the years, just like everything else, there is always the potential for 'the end of things' and there is nothing that can stop it.   We can try to adjust to the changes-you with our 3 somes (just a disaster waiting to happen) so that she can remain fulfilled with you because you are no longer 'enough', others with their adjustments to their own wants/needs so their spouses won't leave etc. In the end the details don't matter anymore and what is happening NOW is the only thing that is relevant.   She is not being a partner right now, she is having sex with other people (STDs are another problem for you that could affect  your life), she is being abusive to you physically, she is not coping well (or even trying to) with your child who needs a lot of help...Where in this do you find a solution that includes you and her remaining married?  Marriages CANNOT remain in tact when both people are not feeding the dream--it is a social construct that requires the people involved (not to mention society) to believe in it. She does not, at least not now and that is what is the operative word here.   Go get help for yourself, for your child and support for your other children who are no doubt feeling the immense weight of this death of sorts.   No one says to go an get the papers signed now,just take care of things so your life is at least not getting ripped at the seams. FORGET ABOUT HER as the main theme in this right now, for goodness sake, for your all of your children's sakes. Just because your idiotic wife has shirked her responsibilities doesn't mean you have to."
relationship_advice,3e2xqo,RevisedThoughts,2,Tue Jul 21 18:36:34 2015 UTC,I have always believed that marriage being forever is a ridiculous stipulation that reduces the possibility of it being true.

relationship_advice,3e2xqo,Arcades,4,Tue Jul 21 19:08:15 2015 UTC,Definitely a good idea.
relationship_advice,3e2xqo,The-Ban-Hammer,-3,Tue Jul 21 19:15:17 2015 UTC,"I suggest you might want to move your focus. It sounds like she is overwhelmed and staring to check out of her family responsibilities. Cheating may be one of many failing coping strategies she is adopting. If you think it is worth trying to be part of her building better strategies, you might decide to go to therapy together. But that may be a long and exhausting road, so it might not help you or her I'm the short or medium term.   In the short term you can only define boundaries which are healthy for you and enable you to meet your goals. And if you look at it this way, you might feel you want to stop the sex while she might be playing away too, to protect yourself from any diseases and possibly to regain some dignity if you do not feel you consent to this arrangement. Not as a punishment or out of petulance, but just basic self-respect.   You can also focus on your children. Not only the one with ADHD but the others too who also have to deal with their sibling, and the lack of adult attention given they are so many and there are so many other things distracting their parents. Make sure they are insulated as much as possible from your wife deciding she can't cope with things, whetting drunk instead etc etc. that is a worthwhile project. Again it may feel thankless and you may resent your wife not pulling her weight, but you say she has a very attractive personality and it sounds like you can see enough of her good sides to give her space to work things out in therapy."
relationship_advice,3e2xqo,The-Ban-Hammer,3,Tue Jul 21 16:08:49 2015 UTC,"Wow, that is very helpful to hear.  It makes me feel somewhat sane.  I did convince her to start therapy three months ago.  She resisted for a long time out of fear.  We have also been seeing a marriage counselor together and separately.  Me, her, the therapist and the counselor all agree that her overwhelming situation is a major contributing factor to her falling apart.  I have not described the severity of my son's issues but will say that the thing he was doing to her in the first couple of years are things people should only have nightmares about.  It was severe.  He have seen countless professionals to help deal with that, both for him and us.  We have discussed STD safety, and when she finally came to being honest was clear about the precautions she has taken.  She's having a lot of trouble, and recognizes that, but she is not stupid.  She has used protection and also made sure he was tested - saw the results personally.  Stopping sex between me her would almost certainly make things worse.  It is a strong and bonding connection, as well as a stress reliever for both of us.  Your comments about the kids is constantly on my mind.  The older two are expressing frustration with how completely distracted she is.  She feels they are treating her with disrespect, and I do my best to bring her to understanding, but she's in a bad place.  I take care to compensate as best I can, and spend time taking them to work/camps/sports etc (and my wife does to) as well as reading, hiking, playing in the yard.  I could do more, and really will think about what you say about insulating them.  I think that is valuable feedback.   Much of what you say encourages me I am taking action to do what I can to make things better.  I just wish it felt like it was getting better.  I don't know how it can as long as she says she can't promise to stop seeing that person.  That's what I am struggling to cope with most right now.  Thank you."
relationship_advice,3e2xqo,Thefisher2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:32:09 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you could make some kind of deal in counselling. Like you each share the one thing the other person can do to make the biggest difference to each of you. You might say it is for her to stop playing away. She might say something horrifically difficult for you.   This might help cope even of you don't make the deal - because it either gives you awareness it is partly your choice she has sex with another if you reject the deal, or gives you a little leverage if she rejects the deal. You have something she wants. But you need to be strong enough not to give that to her without her doing her side of the deal. See this as a replacement to refusing to sleep with her as a means of maintaining your self-respect in the relationship that your deepest feelings also matter and you will not let them be trampled on without consequence. It may sound like punishment, but I really mean it should be a personal boundary to avoid the relationship becoming one where your needs are invisible. That is unsustainable.   Glad that reddit is helping you feel sane. You sound like you are doing all the most important things, and facing realities rather than trying to bury them. In the long run this is probably the least risky path which at least gives your children the message they matter."

relationship_advice,3e2xqo,zanpher717,3,Tue Jul 21 17:59:30 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I dated a girl that sounds kinda similar. Smart, very kind on good days, insanely beautiful, and a crazy sex drive. The thing is all the good was heavily outweighed by her clear knack for warping things to her point of view, to the extent she could justify almost everything she did in her head, regardless of how bad it was. She would even remember events transpiring differently to enforce her point of view.   I got out of it pretty quick, because I know what it means to be really respected, but I could just imagine her completely destroying somebody with lower self-respect and more self-doubt, and them accepting it based on her good qualities. It's really easy to convince yourself that things are good when you're lying in bed after several hours of mindblowing sex and intimacy, but sex is just sex. It's only a small part of the relationship. You have to see it for what it is.  Once I broke up with her and the sexual aspects were taken away, all the nastiness of her became even more clear. Her ego was such that she couldn't even accept the fact she had been broken up with, as beautiful and smart as she was, and told her friends it was her that had broken up with me. Of course this outward ego was just a mask to hide the extremely complex insecurities that lead her to act in the way she did, constantly needing validation.  She wouldn't happen to be eastern european would she?"
relationship_advice,3e2xqo,spunduckywo0wo0,0,Tue Jul 21 20:00:59 2015 UTC,"Google ""signs of an abusive relationship"" because that is unequivocally what you are in. Your relationship hits nearly every one of the signs in the very first result (and all the other results). She is not only abusing you, but your children as well. Children learn by imitation. Is this the kind of treatment you want to teach them to accept in their relationships?  I can see that you have become so codependent that talking about your own needs probably won't register with you at all. Try to consider the possibility that you are just as valuable as she is, and your needs matter just as much as hers do. However, the needs of your children to be protected and safe come way before any of that.  Stop lying to your therapist, friends and family about this. Stop covering for her, as so many abuse victims do. Get help for yourself, because your kids desperately need you to take care of them right now. They are depending on you and you alone to get your shit together and make this situation safe for them."

relationship_advice,3e2xqo,Exener,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:58:48 2015 UTC,How do you not see the massive risk to your children given her destructive behavior (to you and to herself)?  I can't judge your tolerance of the cheating -- that's entirely up to you.  But you are a FATHER and this woman behaves dangerously.  What happens when she hits her limit with your 5 year old?  What happens when she drives them to an extracurricular activity while she's high on pills or drunk?

Four of the boxes were composed of similar items that she had packed and moved with her last time and had not opened in over 4 years. She also had a box full of plastic tupperware that she never used after replacing it with nicer tupperware and pyrex, some very broken (smashed) electronics, and a box of empty CD jewel cases. She didn't even have the CDs any more--she had been moving the box of empty cases with her since 1999.   When I told her about it several months later, she laughed and said she'd wondered where the trash went, but that she was glad it was gone. Her new home is kept pretty clean and the 13+ boxes of trash aren't cluttering up her space and stressing her out. It was a win/win.

If that is done take a day and scrub down the house. When I go out of town for work my husband cleans the house - first, vacuum, laundry, changes the sheets, picks up the stupid crap you keep meaning to do. He tops it of with some flowers and maybe a bottle of wine (both of which can be inexpensive). It makes me the happiest because I can come home and relax.   Last idea is maybe a small project that you know she wants done. My husband installed these fancy new light switches the other day for me.

I hate that stuff and when my Husband takes that chore off my hands I adore it! you have a new house, there are going to be so many little things that need to be taken care of. I'd work together with her and come up with an ongoing list of those little things that both of you will work on (new switch cover in the bathroom, touch up paint in bedroom, put together shelves in garage) and as you have time in your schedule make sure to get some of them accomplished. Nothing builds resentment more than having to become a nag."
relationship_advice,3e1mml,ReceptionistMouse,7,Tue Jul 21 12:55:41 2015 UTC,"As a wife who has done things like your wife has, nothing makes me feel more alone in my marriage than when I do something like that to help our family and it goes unappreciated. My husband did that once and it led to a serious come to Jesus conversation. I had also packed our entire apartment to move into our new house in December, and then did Christmas cards, cookies, and shopping/wrapping for both families (his massive family + mine = 32 presents every year) plus a million other things while also working full time and in an evening grad program. Not only was he not appreciative, he was impatient with me as I frantically tried to get everything done. On the 8 hour drive to spend a week with his family, I broke down. After I told him that I felt alone in our marriage, he finally understood that for shit to be nice, someone has to do it. There's no moving and Christmas fairy. Up until that point it had just been me. Since then, he's very conscientious about showing appreciation for all that I do and he also helps out a lot more. He even learned how to make bows last year. They are terrible, but so what?  Show your wife how much you appreciate her. Something like:  ""Pookie, thank you so much for handling the entire move. You did a better job than I ever could. It means a lot to me that you will go the extra mile for our family. It's important that we have each other's backs, and I appreciate all that you do. I love you so much.""  Write down how you feel, use your petname of choice, and leave her that note in a place she'll find it after you leave. Maybe on her pillow or something. If you can swing the logistics, leave her a small present. A inexpensive bouquet of flowers from the grocery store (no lilies if you have cats, they are toxic), a pot of succulents, her favorite candy or treat--just something small that will brighten her day. Once, my husband left me a sweet note with one of those silly vending machine stick on mustaches next to it because it's ridiculous and it made me laugh.   Your appreciation and thanks and then taking the time to write that note and get her a small present is all she needs from you. We do things for our spouses because we love them and we cover for them when they need it because we love them and all we ever want in return is their happiness. Show her how meaningful her actions were for you, I promise she'll be as happy as if you'd bought her diamonds. I have a Kit Kat wrapper in my memento box along with a sweet note and I'd part with my wedding set before I'd part with anything in my memento box. My wedding rings are just things, they don't compare to the sentiment of the other stuff. My marriage would survive without wedding rings, it would not survive without things like that Kit Kat wrapper.   Also, on your way home from work, occasionally stop off somewhere and get her a coffee or something. My husband has given me big, expensive gifts and taken me out to fancy restaurants, but nothing makes me love him more than when he gets home from work and he brings me a Diet Coke from McDonalds or a shake from Sonic."

I love you."" and giving me a hug and a kiss, or telling me to lay down and then go to town on lightly tickling my back heh.

She's not wrong to not want anymore babies. Having a baby is incredibly hard, painful, and stressful. More so if there are any complications. Having an infant is incredibly hard and stressful and exhausting as well.   You are also not wrong to want more babies. Everyone has their preferences and desires and this is yours and you're totally well within your rights to want that.  The problem is that this is a huge thing to disagree on and one of you (likely you) is going to become miserable with resentment. That's not healthy for you, your wife, or your daughter.  I can't give advice on the situation except to be totally honest with her about your feelings and ask her to try to be more sensitive to them. But I really think a counselor would be really beneficial in figuring out where you go from this."

Instead I opted to get off at ""we're still young"" station before realizing the no more baby train is supposed to be an express run to the end of the line.  Isn't it funny how our feelings and attitudes can be so malleable and fluid in some situations and so rigid and unwavering in others? I just ... I couldn't box up that hope ... and now that she's aging out of child-bearing years, I have to and kinda don't want to?    Basically, I need to just get past this, and you're right about the strength of counseling ... wife's pretty anti-counseling though.

The overwrought protestations are so hurtful, but meanwhile she probably thinks she's ""heading it off at the pass"" by continually reminding you of her position, rather than rubbing salt in the wound, which she's totally doing.  Counselling would be of such a help to you, I truly think so. I credit marriage counselling with a large part of my day to day happiness. You two are not communicating and she is not honouring your feelings - for whatever reason, like she thinks backing down at all will represent a lapse in her ""armour"" on the topic, perhaps - but in doing so, she is continually hurting you and it's not fair.   Your feelings are valid and you deserve to have them validated by the person who is supposed to love you the most, and I can totally see how it won't be possible to find acceptance without that validation.  This is a big one. I hope you are honest about how much it's hurting you, and get help, not to change her mind or yours, but to come to terms with the situation you're in without actively hurting each other any more."
relationship_advice,3e3lfe,tillwehavefaces,5,Tue Jul 21 20:02:00 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but sounds like she made a decision and you kept your mouth shut and went along with it. Without the intent to change her mind, you need to let her know of your opinion.   Say something like ""While I respect your decision, if it were up to me, I would have more. When you say things like that, it is like rubbing salt into the wound. I am working on being okay with not having more children, and I need you to give me time to do that."" Just like you are respecting her decision, she needs to give you time to grieve the lost hope of another child."
relationship_advice,3e3lfe,premedonna,3,Tue Jul 21 20:25:31 2015 UTC,"When the change in her mind came, there was little to do other than keep my mouth shut and go along with it. First it was about the pain of childbirth, then the frustrations of infancy. Hard to argue it's not painful, taxing and stressful. In fact, when our child was younger I even agreed with her that I was happy not to have to deal with crying babies, soiled diapers and the like.  There were tons of parts of infancy and toddlerhood that I was and am glad not to deal with ... but I'd trade all of them in. Of course I don't have to carry something inside me and have it latched at my boob large portions of the day for a couple years.  Regardless, it's not like this is something you change someone else's mind about, and she was well aware that while I respected her decision, that my own hopes hadn't changed.  In truth, I figured her position would moderate as our child grew and she approached the point of no return. It didn't. In fact she became more resolute.  I like the idea of thinking about it as grieving a loss. I think that makes it a lot more more manageable than suffering through a difference in something so fundamental to the family unit. It's like the college you got accepted to and couldn't afford or the awesome job you lost because of a shitty boss. You move on because there isn't a choice. Like ... what if she had been rendered infertile with the first, or I had some disease that rendered me infertile. I'd still be dealing with a lot of the same issues ... I don't know maybe not ... maybe the choice factor makes it harder to grieve because it is so easy to still hold out hope.  I mean, I still have two or three decades! Of course her window is closing faster every month.  I think I will say something next time she makes a point to remind me how glad she is she decided not to have any more kids. I keep my mouth shut about it a lot, and it is perfectly reasonable to request she do the same. You're right, it does feel like she's rubbing salt in the wound. I know she does it thoughtlessly and not maliciously."
relationship_advice,3e3lfe,Exener,6,Tue Jul 21 21:06:02 2015 UTC,Lol you don't have 2 or 3 decades unless you want to be a geriatric father who won't live to see his grandkids or have the siblings be in a parent/child relationship rather than a playmate situation. That being said you can't force her to have more children and with her risk of PPD it really may not be in the best interest of your wife. Think of it as her health and the family's overall happiness over another baby. Now you should go to counseling and discuss adopting. Because your need to have another child is very important and you should not take her half ass attempt to keep it on the table. Really discuss it deeply in front of a counselor. You have the right to that discussion as your needs are equally important.

I'm not sure it works as well when you have a partner with a low sex drive - then they start to dread it as it approaches.   I've found that, for me, I have to get myself in the mood first on my own, minus any foreplay with a partner. It's too easy for me to get distracted with someone else, so I get busy and invite my partner in after I'm revved up. Not ideal, but better than nothing."
relationship_advice,3e2rlf,Shikario,2,Tue Jul 21 19:14:01 2015 UTC,"Personally, scheduling sex has been a bad move for me and my other half. It usually means one of us just isn't into it and feel like it isn't as good as when you're both into it and it just happens. I just let it happen when it wants to happen. Scheduling is almost forcing it rather than letting you both get heated with each other when the time comes."

Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe that it will ""just happen"". I'm being told that there is literally no sex drive, so I don't know that I'm left with any other choice.

Try asking her about how she feels about you giving her oral, maybe ask her if you can both have a day just to yourselves. Candles, wine, all that stuff. Treat her like royalty and maybe the sex drive will come back. But be sneaky about it. Don't just go and buy her something and expect her to want to have sex with you. Do a lot of little things which will make her adore you even more than she probably does.   EDIT: When was the last time you made her orgasm? Making her orgasm again could get her in the mood as she might have forgotten how good it was."

Send her flowers at work just because.   When we do have sex she orgasms every time, multiple times. We had sex like 3.5 weeks ago. That's why it's so confusing to me that she doesn't want that to happen more in life.   I'm hoping that I can be more romantic and thoughtful for her throughout the week in a non sexual way. Maybe it will give her more reason to want to have sex with me."

I, on the other hand always wanted a child   that's it.  there is nothing else to discuss.  you want a baby, he does not.  its a fundamental difference.  He is well into adulthood and will not change his mind.    you have to move on from him.  even if you stay with him, you'll eventually resent giving up your future child for him.    learn the lesson.  spot the deal breakers early on, and listen to them."

relationship_advice,3e2ct4,restatic,8,Tue Jul 21 14:24:11 2015 UTC,"you'll eventually resent giving up your future child for him   The only reason I don't 100% agree is that she said she isn't even sure she wants kids, she just wants to do it because it is what one does in adulthood. Also at 30 there is absolutely no guarantee that she will meet marry and procreate in time (biologically speaking). The love of your life is hard to give up for the possibility that she may want children with the added possibility that she may not find someone else."
relationship_advice,3e2ct4,missmisfit,20,Tue Jul 21 16:06:22 2015 UTC,"fair.  but she is 30.  she is well into adulthood and should know what she wants.  my spidey sense is that the only reason she is not sure is because she wants to stay with this man.  in 10 years she will probably feel regret.  she wants to convince herself she doesn't want kids so she doesn't have to date again, but if that was the case she wouldn't even be posting this."

I have been single for most of my adult life.  it takes some getting used to, but really, its not that bad.  people who base their happiness in someone else make me terrified to date.  as a single person, I don't have to compromise shit.  but OP wants to give up a huge thing just to have someone to sleep next to.  yikes."

That's what jumped out at me.   She wants to create a biological mini-me that she thinks will HAVE to be in her life just because she's it's parent.   All because she's afraid of being alone and not willing to stretch herself to build relationships with others."

relationship_advice,3e2ct4,notevenapro,10,Tue Jul 21 16:40:56 2015 UTC,"Move on. I see no end game where you will be happy here.  I've seen many friends of mine hang on with guys that didn't want children hoping that they'd change their minds. One guy did, the others did not. The rest ended bitterly. The guys were all up front from the beginning too but none of my friend listened to what they were being told.  If the prospect of being single/looking for love terrifies you now in your 30s, imagine dating this guy/marrying him & then discovering that you absolutely want kids. Try dating in your late 30s & 40s. Most of the guys aren't looking for kids or possibly already have kids from a previous marriage & aren't interested in having more.   This guy sounds single-minded & pretty adamant about not having children. He has given you his very sound reasons for not wanting a child - the biggest one being he does not want to put in the effort that it takes to raise a child. You can think to yourself ""I will change the diapers & I will do all of the work"" but it's not possible. There is always spillover & there is always there & then you will have a resentful partner - and even worse, a child that is growing up with a parent that resents him/her. He is not the father of your future children. If by some miracle, he changes his mind, tell him to call you."

relationship_advice,3e2ct4,Congzilla,8,Tue Jul 21 14:12:35 2015 UTC,"It's a dealbreaker issue.  If you want children you have to move on.

OP, this decision must be incredibly difficult for you. Do you want to remain with this guy and give up on having kids, or do you want to give up on this guy and look for another man who does want them? But whatever you do, don't allow yourself to hope that this guy will change his mind or that you can somehow make it work if you get pregnant against his will. That would be unfair and unwise."

relationship_advice,3e2ct4,amundsenkalmah,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:36:17 2015 UTC,Disingenious and slanted comparison.
relationship_advice,3e2ct4,Quetzie,2,Tue Jul 21 17:06:18 2015 UTC,It's a legitimate question.
relationship_advice,3e2ct4,Thornnuminous,0,Tue Jul 21 17:09:55 2015 UTC,Are you sure? Because to me it reads like one of the stereotypical /r/nokidsever cliché-lines that aren't intended as a genuine question but more as a leading question with an already defined 'proper' answer that is used to bait OP.   I don't see how this little propaganda piece is of any use to the actual question at hand.
relationship_advice,3e2ct4,Quetzie,8,Tue Jul 21 17:40:20 2015 UTC,"This is why it is a legitimate question:  There are no guarantees in life. The OP has herself said she really loves the man she's with and they have a good life together.  That is a fact.  She thinks she will be happier if she has children.   That is speculation.  It behooves the OP to seriously examine her current life, and research the pros and cons of having a child, plus give a realistic assessment to the probabilities of   A) finding someone else who wants to have kids with her   B) that she can have kids (what if she turns out to be infertile?)   C) what will she do if the child in question turns out to be special needs (it's amazing how many people don't seriously think through this potential future)   D) What will happen if she has a child with someone else and he leaves her or dies  E) Seriously examine her motives (having a child because you're afraid of being alone in your old age is seriously fucked up)  then she needs to balance all this against the living, breathing relationship she has right now with someone who actually exists, actually loves her, and actually improves her life.  To put it simply, is the risk of a child (who does not now, or might not ever exist) worth sacrificing her current relationship with a man who does exist, does love her, whom she loves, and who materially improves her life?  THAT is why it is a legitimate question.   NOW, it is possible the answer for the OP is yes, it's worth the sacrifice.   But that doesn't change the fact that the question must be considered."
relationship_advice,3e2ct4,Thornnuminous,0,Tue Jul 21 17:46:06 2015 UTC,"I personally think it is the most logical thing to assume that what OP says is true.   She wants kids. Her husband doesn't. She was in the wrong for assuming her husband would change his mind. In the same vein I think you are wrong for assuming she might change her mind.   Those are the facts as we know them, and OP should decide based on that. Not on some, as I've said earlier, disinginious and slanted comparison intended to evoke a purely emotional response."
relationship_advice,3e2ct4,Quetzie,3,Tue Jul 21 18:22:32 2015 UTC,"They aren't married. I am not saying she would, should, or even could change her mind. I am saying that as he was always honest with her from day one, she needs to be the same now, especially to herself. Still not slanted. Still not disingenuous. It's a legitimate question that she has failed to ask. Instead, she came here asking for advice on how how to change HIS mind.    The mind that needs to be dealt with is her own."
relationship_advice,3e2ct4,Thornnuminous,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:26:21 2015 UTC,The mind that needs to be dealt with is her own.   Surely there are better ways of doing this than asking leading questions?
relationship_advice,3e2ct4,Quetzie,2,Tue Jul 21 18:28:48 2015 UTC,"We'll have to agree to disagree.  I think that asking her to balance a live, healthy, current relationship over her desire for a potential, possibly never to be realized one (especially at the sacrifice of the current, actual relationship) is a caring and responsible thing to point out."
relationship_advice,3e2ct4,Thornnuminous,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:32:25 2015 UTC,"caring and responsible thing to point    I don't necessarily disagree with that part at all, I just think it is detrimental to pose this question in a non-caring and manipulative way.   Which is my whole point from the beginning.  You seem to think that raising the issue is more important than raising it in a respectfull manner, that's where we seem to disagree."
relationship_advice,3e2ct4,Quetzie,3,Tue Jul 21 18:48:11 2015 UTC,He is about to retire at 39 and most likely wants that freedom to enjoy life with himself and a partner. You need to think very hard about what you want in your life because you may be on separate paths.   He doesn't want children and will resent you for having them one day. You want children and will resent him / regret not having them one day.  Time to make a major life decision my dear. Good luck.

Moving in with a partner can be very difficult and trying on the relationship. It sounds like he isn't willing to risk the relationship just so he can find a place to stay. This sounds more like he is putting the relationship first, he just didn't vocalize that to you when he made that decision."
relationship_advice,3e3859,StopStalkingMeB,4,Tue Jul 21 17:07:10 2015 UTC,"I've been with a girl and she wanted to move in together badly. I had my doubts about the relationship in general so I didn't agree to the moving in together at all, and didn't put much communication into it. And just said I didn't want to live together until being engaged, and welp, that never happened.  With the next girl, we moved in together within 7 months of dating. Everything has been bliss. I did know, in the back of my mind that I wanted to live with my GF before getting married, to whomever it was.   You may be able to compromise on something - you sign the lease, and find one you'd be comfortable making payments on pending the relationship went south, and that he'd pay you month to month. Put it in writing. This would be the same situation as he's in now, assuming he's not signing a lease or sublease.   Regading the ""not ready"" comment, well that's your call. Have there been any signs about that? How long does he need to date before wanting to live with someone, or get engaged? From my perspective, the thought of moving in with a significant other, that you're crazy about, shouldn't be a scary deal. Maybe a little scary but it's mutual. Doesn't sound like you're on the same time/page between the two of you.   2 years is a good amount of time."
relationship_advice,3e3859,Lazy_IT_guy,2,Tue Jul 21 17:53:34 2015 UTC,"Firstly, if it's impractical financially for you two to live together, then what's the issue? Secondly, at least he's honest.  Maybe he's worried that you will not be able to tolerate him in such high amounts. Whatever the case is, you need to approach it like an adult. If you can't afford to live together, then don't. It doesn't mean your relationship is going nowhere. It means you just don't have the means financially, and in his case, maturity-wise right now. Guys don't mature as fast as women."
relationship_advice,3e3859,Uggs_are_ugly,2,Tue Jul 21 17:09:19 2015 UTC,"Your question depends on what you're actually looking for out of the relationship and what your timetable is more than anyone elses perception of normality.  Even if you don't know specifically what you want or don't have a timetable it needs to be considered even if just to say 'I really don't know what I want beyond to be happy in the moment and I don't care about time right now'.    If you know that you proactively want this relationship to last permanently then it stands to reason that you might want to live together with your boyfriend at some point, but perhaps not right now.  If that's the case then you can afford wait until the time is right for both of you.   On the other hand, if you are not so sure if you want this relationship to last permanently but you know you want to be in some relationship that will last permanently then you have to consult your desired timetable for when you want to be in that relationship by and plan and act accordingly.    With respect to your boyfriend there's no guarantee he will ever want more than what your relationship is right now, no one can predict the future.  He may or he may not feel differently in the future, but if he's happy with the status quo now it doesn't really tell you anything about what he may be thinking (or not thinking) about the future.  That said, if you want a guy who knows he wants to be living with someone and on the course to permanent life bonding within two years of dating them there are guys out there want that.  I can't guarantee how many there are, or that you'll meet any of them or that you'll like any of them that you meet, but they exist."

I have been with my current gf for 6 years now and we have not moved in together, we have lived together for a few months, but that was it.  I understand where he is coming from as I have many reasons not to move in yet.  First would be I would not want to facilitate a serious serious relationship as I am still not what I believe to be mature enough to properly live with her.  I also do not want to harm our relationship yet as living together before marriage can sometimes harm the relationship more than not.  With all of that, I still would like to experience new things with friends and move in at the right time for the both of us.  We have talked about moving in before and both now agree after a year of desiring it that it was the best move to not do so.  I hope this helps, I would try to listen him more to why he does not want to, and understand yourself more as to why you want to so badly; remember moving in does not constitute a good relationship in any way."

relationship_advice,3e3859,reloadfreak,-1,Tue Jul 21 21:03:32 2015 UTC,"It doesn't necessarily mean that he specifically ""doesn't see a future with you"", per se, as much as it may mean he doesn't really have a solid plan for a future at all.  For himself or anything else.  Guys at his age are often not thinking of the future in the same way that women your age are.  He's enjoying your time together and you being his girlfriend, but isn't getting the urge to lock it down and put a ring on it at this point.  I think it deserves a lot more discussion, especially from your end, to get a clear picture of where you two are.  At this point, it seems like you're looking to be in a relationship that steadily progresses towards marriage and kids, or some such longterm commitment.  It's wise of you to figure out if this is going to be a man who has that sort of potential, and if not, cut loose before too much more of your twenties pass."

I don't think it's unusual to appreciate other people you find attractive, assuming you're not actually looking at them as viable relationships that you could have if you were ""free."" If you are happier going home every night with this girl than you know you would be with someone else, don't stress about it.

The Mature man thing is, you keep your word. You do not overly flirt, you act in public, the way you would want your girlfriend to act.

If she feels loved by physical closeness, then that's what you offer. Maybe she feels loved from deeds, so you help clean, or cook, or fix the roof. Maybe she feels loved by words, so you tell her how pretty she is. Everyone FEELS love differently... Love is absolutely a VERB."

Also, the fact that she would tell you that her friends want her to break up with you is A) juvenile and B) means she must be complaining about you. What other grounds would her friends have to say something so drastic, if it wasn't following some kind of story she shared with them about your relationship? She is basically 'over sharing' which is exactly what she got mad at you for doing (though, I don't think what you said is classified as over sharing by any means)."

Ask pointedly what harm had been done regarding not mentioning the third interview, agreed you should have told her about it, but if she wants you to be open about such things, she also has to be able to handle it maturely. And laugh out the suggestion that talking to a friend about her in this context could be construed as infidelity.   You did not. You appear to want to listen to and validate her point of view before expressing yours. And expecting to be treated with a similar level of respect and courtesy. This is very healthy with the right person. But it is not in this case. She seems to be using your good nature as a license to trample over you (going by your telling of events).   On the other side, her behavior of snooping, sulking, attacking, making no apologies, twisting things and blowing them out of proportion, making inappropriate comparisons to reframe innocent behavior as somehow treacherous, and doing so - I am imagining - in an angry and possibly demeaning manner (given that she does not in your telling admit her actions were entitled and disrespectful to begin with) ... All add up to manipulative behavior. Consciously or unconsciously. She is crossing your boundaries unapologetically to berate you for perfectly reasonable behavior, so you feel on guard, worried how she will interpret anything you do, scared to say things to your friends that might conceivably relate to her or your feelings being trampled by her. It all adds up to her not wanting you to feel free and trusted to be you.   Maybe this was a one-time mental breakdown. Out of character and one for which she is voluntarily going to apologise for in great shame and seek help for. In that case, I am sure you can be the perfect partner to help her rebuild her mental health. Otherwise your accommodating nature may be putting you at risk of succumbing to an abusive relationship. She may not want to be abusive. She may want someone who will stand up to her bad behavior and quickly put a stop to it by not validating any of her accusations and holding her accountable for aggressing boundaries. Don't force yourself to be that person if it does not come naturally to you.   Your job in life is not to be her ideal man. It is to be your ideal you. If she wants you for you, and you want her for her, that is great. But it isn't a good idea to go into a relationship wanting to change the other person, unless you are both honest about it and consent and make reasonable boundaries which you respect. I have a feeling that is not going to happen here.   Good luck, and hope you can get out of these dynamics before your circuits of compassion get worn out."
relationship_advice,3e2ije,RevisedThoughts,3,Tue Jul 21 15:41:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks, Revised. It's pretty hard coming to terms with this seed thats been sitting in my brain for a little while now. She is by far the most beautiful girl i've ever dated, shes sweet, and her family is just amazing. The kind of family I've always wanted to be a part of. That said, my rationalizations for her bouts of jealous anger has become more and more difficult. I have so many more examples that I wont list.   I guess I know what I need to do. Thanks so much for the help, to you and everyone"
relationship_advice,3e2ije,Missus_Black,5,Tue Jul 21 17:11:56 2015 UTC,"I'm just wondering what prompted her to snoop like that... That definitely shows a lack of trust and respect of your privacy, I believe.  Honestly, to me, she sounds kind of insecure.  It doesn't sound like she was trying to be malicious by logging into your account; it sounds like she may be a little immature and she's definitely insecure, and so she handled those emotions totally wrong by invading your personal conversations with your friends. Which is definitely not alright.  Anyway, You kind of are now in a place where you have to decide if you want to forgive her for her invasion of your privacy and her policing of your conversations, or you can dump her.  Maybe you should try talking to her in a calm setting and explain to her that you feel like this behaviour is inappropriate, and she really can't be breaking your trust like that and expect you to be ok with it.  I think what you said to your friends is irrelevant at this point; the problem is she's clearly dealing with some negative emotions right now, and she's coping with that in a way that is negatively impacting your relationship.  Good luck!"
relationship_advice,3e2ije,Warpfrenzy,10,Tue Jul 21 18:09:01 2015 UTC,So she is mad because you talk to your friends about things going on in your life? It sounds like she was hoping to catch u cheating and only found this. So she is using the only information she has to start shit.  Dump her.

There's no way she's going to do the right thing and say, ""I admit what I did was wrong and it was fruitless and found nothing, I want to apologize and try to make it up to you.""  In her mind, her snooping was justified by what she found.  Ball's in your court."

relationship_advice,3e3e9x,Smithdog1983,3,Tue Jul 21 17:36:35 2015 UTC,"My heart goes out to you both in this genuine moral predicament. Philosophically, there is no moral imperative in an amoral situation - in other words - there is no 'right' outcome here; it sucks, its unfair, but she has the disease and that's a constant, wether you are in the picture or not. Because her life goes that way, either way. That technically means there's no need to beat yourself up should you decide to walk away. Then again, we're humans and not robots ...    Goes without saying, it's your decision. These are just my personal thoughts: You care enough to write a post, and be genuinely wrestling with this. Could it be from more than the guilt? Was the plan LTR before she told you? Do you feel like caring for her and all the things you mentioned would rob you of a happy life? And not enjoy one with her? You really need to dig deep and find out how you feel. Do some thinking.    Don't spend years doing something out of guilt. That said, don't leave something if you think it's worth it.    Best, X"
relationship_advice,3e3e9x,commentatorX,2,Tue Jul 21 18:51:01 2015 UTC,"That is tough and you have my sympathy. I'd say you're doing her a favor if you get out now. She deserves to be with someone who can truly look past her MS and is up for the challenge later in life. You also deserve to be in a relationship where you don't feel horrible feeling this way.   With that being said, I think it would be hard for anyone to know if they would be up for this ""one day"". Who knows how they would feel a decade in the future about someone after four months of dating? There's also a chance that the further along you got in a relationship with her, the more your feelings and devotion would grow, and you'd have no doubt that you would be up for it.   But if you're already this unsure now, maybe the safe bet would be to end it here. That's a tough one though. Good luck."

The obvious advice, and best advice, would be to walk away. This isn't the healthy relationship you are making it out to be. The love isn't as strong from his side if he is willing to cheat on you after having your baby.   Still, the right advice is rarely listened to around here. So that being said, if you want this to even have a chance at working, he needs to leave that job as soon as possible and put as much distance between himself and that other girl. He also needs to put your feelings into consideration about ogling other girls.   If he can't or won't do both of those things then your relationship is already over."

Stay with him for your own reasons or don't, but there is no ""getting over this"" other than you simply telling yourself the benefits he provides outweigh the pain and suffering he causes you.  He's selfish.  He doesn't love you.  He doesn't respect you, but (I guess) he supports you.  If that's enough for you, then so be it.  This is your life, after all."

relationship_advice,3e37jq,monopolizeme,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:00:41 2015 UTC,"how do you know he actually loves you? because his actions are definitely not indicative of that.  He couldn't even keep it in his pants with such a young baby at home to look after? instead of trying to finish things up and head home early to be with his family and to help you out, he chose to spend extra time outside just to have fun fucking someone else? If those are actions of someone who loves you, I would hate to see what someone who doesn't give a shit about you would do. I honestly cannot believe you are not more furious about this. not only that he cheated but he did so just a few months after his own child was born? seriously?  Also, tbh when you described all the things you ""had to"" put up with, all I could think is how can you say this is worth it? You didn't have to put up with anything. It's not like he was the last man alive. For whatever reason, you decided he was the best you could do and chose to live with him treating you like crap. Were you expecting some sort of reward? Just because you deal with someone's shortcomings doesn't make them any more inclined to stick around and be faithful. I don't understand why people do that- they act as if the only way to have a good relationship is by putting up with a load of crap like this. I know not everyone is perfect and any guy you find later will have his own flaws but you can definitely find someone much, much better than him. Your thought process seems to be either that since you put up with all his shit, he is more likely to ""stay with you forever""- and you're wrong. He's definitely inclined to keep walking all over you though, and it seems like you'd be willing to let him. Please respect yourself. Love is about having someone else who holds you up even at your weakest, not about having that very same person kick you when you're already down."

She's definitely not over him. I think that the probability is that she still loves him and you are a rebound.   She got into a relationship too soon and has not really healed. That sucks for you and wasn't fair for her to do.   I think the right thing to do is to end the relationship - she's not really in love with you, you are a place holder, essentially.

From what you said, she does sound like she's using you as a placeholder. It sucks, I know, I've been there myself. I also understand that you have deep feelings for this girl, so she claims she does for you as well. You might want to distance from her for a while. Maybe a week, a month, hopefully not too long.   No matter how many times I've been given the same advice, and been through it, the only thing that is absolute is time. You have to give each other space and time for both of you to figure things out. It WILL hurt. A LOT. Having a break from each other will allow both of you to figure some things out. Do not contact her for a few days, she's got more on her plate than you do.   By the sounds of this, you are quite young, and don't have much experience in relationships. This will add to the pain and confusion. The good thing is that you've only been together for four months, and it's not going to be as painful than someone whose been together for a year or more. In the meanwhile, contact your friends, they're the ones that can help you the most. Tell them about your situation and ask them to take you out and have some fun. Good luck, cheers!"

After a breakup, there is always a void and many people would rather quickly fill it up with a new relationship, rather than deal with being alone for the first time in a long time. You deserve to be a priority, not an option. Her feelings won't subside if her and her ex are still in contact. It's nice of her to tell you the truth, but this is definitely a huge reason to end things and find someone who deserves your love."

You are isolating yourself from your peer group.  You should be more active in your college.  Join a club, take up a sport - stay busy with life outside of your boyfriend so YOU can be the best YOU that YOU can be.  You may age out of his range in a year or two, he might get hit by a bus, you never know what the future holds, so you need to be prepared for life with or without him.

Everyone bickers, argues, gets annoyed, etc. It's healthy and what you need to work on is realizing that it doesn't mean you love each other any less. Now, if the annoyance stems from something deeper but it's the only way to react, than you need to figure out how to communicate what the issue is and find a solution. My SO and I have been in therapy for a year and it's the best thing that we have done. We are so strong and it helps to reaffirm our commitment and helps us communicate the things we wouldn't be able to say in our everyday life. One thing I learned is that just because we have a few successful sessions, it doesn't mean we are perfect or will never fight. Something will come up a few weeks later and going to therapy reassures us that we have the space to discuss it and move on. I think this would really benefit you. I don't know of any therapists in Chicago but I would definitely rely on Yelp, as those are people who have tried a therapist and will give their honest opinion. We found our attorney through Yelp and she's amazing!"

relationship_advice,3e1dn7,LyssaBrisby,23,Tue Jul 21 06:03:40 2015 UTC,"You are 24 and dating. The whole point of dating is to establish physical and emotional compatibility.  Physical:   I have realized that it's impossible to force physical attraction.   Emotional:   She's extremely short-tempered, insecure, and is often needy and outright controlling.   I mean... case closed?  Just because you started a relationship with someone does not mean you are obligated to remain in that relationship forever, and I think you know that. I wonder, in fact, how much straight-up fear of the unknown is what is holding you back. Are you really avoiding feeling like a shallow prick... or is there some secret part of you that wonders, ""is this the best I can do""?"
relationship_advice,3e1dn7,LyssaBrisby,4,Tue Jul 21 06:12:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with those points. I am very afraid of the unknown. She is the first person I've made a deep connection with. I guess I'm just feeling so selfish by hurting another person deeply because of what basically boils down to my desire for someone more attractive.

She'll eat her feelings into another 100 pounds because she knows, deep in her heart, that you don't want to be there. It'll be great!  ...Of course, there's no medal. There's just your life. Your one life. Do you want to spend it with someone you don't even like because of some obsession with how your actions weigh on the ""shallow"" or ""deep"" scale? Who is measuring?"
relationship_advice,3e1dn7,Claclink,3,Tue Jul 21 06:25:53 2015 UTC,"Most times I do feel like a martyr, which is probably a remnant of my anxiety and low self-worth in the past. I tend to feel bad for things I shouldn't feel bad about, and I tend to sacrifice my own happiness or desires if I feel that others will benefit from whatever it is I'm doing. It's pretty shitty, honestly."
relationship_advice,3e1dn7,BigAngryDinosaur,5,Tue Jul 21 06:33:31 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're recognizing what a destructive habit it is. At first, self-sacrifice has tempting rewards -- you feel like such a good person! People pat you on the back for it! -- but if you take the martyr/people-pleaser lifestyle to its extreme, all you are is making yourself a doormat, and doormats are meant to be walked on. Confident and happy people will avoid you; you can't earn respect when you don't respect yourself. And worse, you'll attract the kind of people who will expoit you and use your generosity until you're drained dry.  This experience -- standing up for your own wants and needs for no other reason but that they're yours, and that's enough -- might be an important step in moderating that self-sacrifice with self-respect. You can be a kind, generous person without setting yourself on fire to keep other people warm."

relationship_advice,3e1dn7,haereeh,3,Tue Jul 21 07:50:24 2015 UTC,"There is another option too.  You can both confront your issues head on. You calmly talk about the issues in the relationship that are bothering you both, from physical to emotional and then talk about the things that you enjoy with her and want to maintain and preserve. You then decide together if you're both willing to make changes to make the relationship work.  Is she willing to try to change her habits? Are you willing to accept that even if she changes habits and loses some weight, can you accept that she may never have that porn-fantasy body you might be dreaming of? Can you help her and support her if she wants to make this choice, and If she changes the way she handles her emotions and attitude to make the emotional side of the relationship more pleasant, will you be willing to change yours as well to make her struggles easier? Will you be able to work on your own self-confidence and not become codependent on her moods? You both have to answer these questions honestly. It might become clear in asking these questions that you aren't right for each other, but at least you can say you tried and thought about it together.  None of this easy. But every relationship requires it to some degree. It means a total change to your dynamic and habits together. It's a painful, serious and dramatic conversation to have.   But the alternatives have already been highlighted by the other posters here."
relationship_advice,3e1dn7,Throwawayway6789,2,Tue Jul 21 11:08:16 2015 UTC,"We've done that already actually. Until quite recently, she was honestly somewhat emotionally abusive and very quick to get angry. I told her I wouldn't stand for it anymore, and to my surprise, she has actually come a long way. She started on medication to address depression and anxiety, and is generally less irritable.  The thing is, I think the damage is already done. I spent months getting yelled at, swore at, put down, all while excusing her behavior - attributing it to her abusive past. We're talking psycho level shit here. I once got screamed at for not wanting to eat a piece of toast that fell on her mother's disgustingly filthy countertop (think hoarders-level of clutter and filth). The vacation we took a few months ago was ruined when she decided to run her mouth to her drunk, scumbag brother in law which led to a physical altercation and cops being called. I'm not gonna deal with this shit forever, and I feel like no matter how much she tries, this angry person will always be there. I've suggested therapy to no avail.  I think maybe if her treatment of me in the past was more like what you would expect from a SO, I wouldn't have the desires I have."
relationship_advice,3e1dn7,Creepella_the_third,2,Tue Jul 21 12:47:40 2015 UTC,I think you just answered your own question - you know you won't be happy with her. A break-up + no contact is the right thing to do.

relationship_advice,3e35c9,Warpfrenzy,3,Tue Jul 21 19:00:32 2015 UTC,"Best advice is to take a breath and let whatever happens happen. You'll enjoy your time more if you're not worried about where it'll end up. If a crisis happens where one of you chooses to go in a different direction or that you two come to a crossroads where a decision needs to be made, work through it then. If that means not being involved anymore, that's ok too. Seems like a level-headed guy; if it ends, I can't imagine it couldn't end amicably. But enjoy your time until that point if it comes."

relationship_advice,3e35c9,ithinkchaos,2,Tue Jul 21 19:00:38 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Honestly, the turning point for me was this one week during the summer of my sophomore year in highschool. I was so focused on trying to hook up with someone that it was keeping my from enjoying my week at summer camp. Of course nothing happened, and so after that week I decided to stop trying so hard, because there was no way it wouldn't happen. I don't mean not trying to meet people and make connections, I mean not focusing so much on the end goal of sexual interaction. Within about a month after that, I'd become involved with two different people.   I know that reads as a red-pill cure-all for getting the girl, but I attribute it more to just being at ease with the idea that things will happen when they happen, and to enjoy your time until they do."

relationship_advice,3e479d,panda852,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:46:23 2015 UTC,"The worst thing you can do is stress about it. Realize that you can't control what other people do. By stressing about it too much and trying to control the situation you may end up being the cause of problems rather than avoiding them. Nobody wants to be with someone that is needy and insecure all the time, so just take a deep breath and relax. That is the healthiest thing you can do for your relationship.  If it fails, and statistically most relationships fail at some point, you learn from it and try to apply the things you learned in your next relationship. The relationship either lasts or fails. If it lasts, great! Hopefully it will. If it doesn't last, it won't be the end of the world and it's not a reflection on you or your worth."
relationship_advice,3dylni,Borganore,168,Mon Jul 20 16:21:12 2015 UTC,"Did I make the right decision?   100% you did. You gave her a chance to re-gain your trust, and she blew it. You don't need and you shouldn't want to be with a liar. You're better off.    How can I get over this pain?   There's no quick fix and no easy way out. You've heard the drill: 1) delete her from Facebook/Instagram...delete anyone that might post pictures with her. You don't need to see her. 2) hit the gym. You'll think of her less, find new ways to occupy your time, and the workouts will help you feel better just because of the exercise. You can take out all your pain and frustrations on the weights and the treadmill or whatever you want, and as you feel better, you might start looking better, and your confidence will go up. Make her jealous of the next girl that gets to be with you.   Everyone that's been here before knows one thing: it's going to be hard. You'll think about her and you'll cry. Then you'll feel better for a while. Then, out of nowhere you'll break down again. Nights will be lonely. Days will seem bleak. You'll get angry and wonder what you did wrong. You'll wake up and think about her constantly until you finally fall asleep that night, the whole time wondering when the pain will end. Just keep on doing you and find new things to experience that make this world beautiful...go on walks to clear your head, meditate, listen to new music, watch funny movies, invite friends out to events in your city. Just do something. Do anything. Then one day you'll wake up and go about your morning routine, thinking about nothing in particular except maybe what you want for dinner or how much work or school is going to suck that day, and a few hours later you'll notice that she wasn't the first thing on your mind. And at that point, you'll know you made it. At that point, it only gets easier.   That's when you know you're moving on. That's when you know you're going to be ok. As the days go on you'll find other things start to occupy your thoughts more and more, and she fades from your mind. A few days later she might not even cross your mind at all, and before you know it, she's nothing but a lesson that you learned, nothing but someone that made you stronger, nothing more than someone that you used to know. And you're better off now.   Love is hard. If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. The hard is what makes it great. Don't give up."

Nobody deserves to be with somebody who is going to tip toe around them and lie to their face.  In the end we can't help who we're attracted to but we have the power to not hurt others involved.

A lot of people don't have the strength to do what's right for them even though it's painful.  Unfortunately for you this is a learning experience she needed. She's obviously not as mature as you are especially concerning relationships. This was a hard lesson to learn for her but if she's going to ever deal with her lack of trust she needs to start with herself.

She then betrayed that trust the very same day. That means it wasn't even that she was confused or conflicted about anything, she made a very conscious decision to lie to your face.

What it means is, that people tend to think that we all think exactly like they do. A thief is always looking for something to steal... so he's also worried that others are doing the same.  Your girl... she had a wandering eye, before she met this guy. She thought that since she was having those feelings... then you must have been having feelings like that too, hence the worry.  What I've described here is not always the case. There are other reasons for people to be concerned or worried, but I think in this instance, the thought process here fits the situation."

You made the right choice, there's really no going back. Now as to how you'll get over this: it's gonna take time along with what everyone else said. There'll be good days where you won't think about it as much, then there'll be bad days where it's just about all you're thinking about. However over time, there will be less bad days and more good days. Then there'll be only good days, then there will be great days where you won't think of it really at all.

relationship_advice,3dylni,fuber,2,Mon Jul 20 20:23:17 2015 UTC,"You completely made the right decision in my opinion. If she is willing to sneak text behind your back and tell him to cool it for a while, that means there was intent to go back to him. You are young, its not the end of the world. Cheer up and move on, I had a similar situation happen to me at your age and it turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me. Not only that but she came begging back, just like I am sure your now ex will. Try doing things that she wouldn't do with you. That way you will not have any memories of her while you are enjoying yourself. Good luck."

Ending a relationship because you're not on the same page, or because they've broken your trust, even though you're the one still in love; It's one of the hardest things you will ever have to do, and likely you will have to do it multiple times throughout your life.   You do get over a broken heart eventually, and you do move on eventually. My suggestion is just to keep yourself busy, so that your mind is occupied on other things, and you don't sit around feeling sorry for yourself and driving all your friends crazy.   Just don't get back together, because it will never be the same again (thanks Mel B). Even though your feelings might not have changed, hers definitely have, and likely any choice of pursuing you again is going to be because her risk didn't pan out and she needs security of what she knows. It's a horrible cycle of rinse and repeat after that."

relationship_advice,3dylni,adamdesautel,2,Mon Jul 20 22:34:18 2015 UTC,"Don't take it personally. I know that is difficult, but when my eyes started to wander in my relationship it was because I was young and craved attention from men to make me feel better about myself and bring some excitement into my life. It had nothing to do with my bf. Shes young and she gave into her ego, that guy was probably sweet talking her, she got excited and decided to have some fun hoping you would never find out and it could all go away neatly. You will get over this if you believe you will. My first breakup went horribly because I felt sorry for myself and clinged on for dear life. Tell yourself you can do this and believe it. You will find someone you love again, stay positive no matter what. You can stay positive even tho you are sad. the crying will go away after a few days and then it becomes more of a choice. I am going through a break up right now and I'm busy all day long. I'm actually happier now than I was in the relationship and its hard to admit but its because I'm putting way more effort into nurturing myself. Which is very important for you too right now."

When you forgive them, you enable them. They begin to think that it's acceptable behavior, to sneak and cheat, lie,  and cover up. In fact my last ex said that the sneaking was what he enjoyed the most. Don't ever forgive cheating. Once a cheater, always a cheater.   It's going to hurt so badly. It will hurt for a long time, but trust me, when you forgive her and she cheats again, it will do so much more damage."
relationship_advice,3dylni,ButtHurtsMcGee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:03:50 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else, I think you made the right decision because she lied to you. Not only that, but right before you go to college isn't the time to be in a long term relationship, even if it had been going well.  But something that's super important for you to learn is that having feelings for someone else is totally normal and expected. When we enter an agreement to be monogamous with someone else, it doesn't mean all our wiring turns off, and that we can't be attracted to or even fall in love/lust with other people. The only question is whether you act on it.   So as you get older and have more relationships, just remember that's normal and natural to feel things for people other than your SO, and that the right thing to do is abide by whatever agreement you have with them, or openly and honestly renegotiate the agreement."

relationship_advice,3dylni,FLASHY_GREEN_ARROW,5,Mon Jul 20 20:43:23 2015 UTC,"But that depends on how you define crush.  Sure, I found other girls attractive, but I would never have thought about pursuing them in any way.  She was starting something emotional with him, and was wanting to make those feelings grow.

I was in a LDR for a year and a half. My SO is American and I am Canadian. We had to live seperately until we could figure out how to be together. Our relationship worked because of two reasons. We have absolute trust in each other and we communicate well. These two features are important for all relationships but are needed WAY more in a LDR. You will not be able to attend events together, meet each others friends or just enjoy lazy Sundays together for a long time. You can't let this get you down. You must be positive. You must set aside time for eachother and skype dates. Texting your plans and days events also helps as it makes you feel more connected.  Something that will make the LDR more bearable is having an end date. This means either your SO comes back or you move to the new country. Moving to a new country is not easy! Make sure you research how and if it can be done. Having said this, some people can do well in LDRs without an end date. It can be done! But you need to know what you want.  LDRs are not ideal but sometimes they are worth it if a person is worth waiting for. If you and your SO are people who will put in the effort for a strong LDR, your relationship can become stronger for it. LDRs can also be very romantic. Trips to see eachother are incredibly exciting and fun. Your communication skills are likely to get better. Your trust will grow and your love will increase for each other. This will happen if you do the LDR right and it is a wondeful experience.  For more info check out r/longdistan e. A good subreddit for people who are in long distance relationships."

In this case, she's right. You'll see in time that you dodged a bullet here.  This was out of the blue for you, but she'd been thinking about this for a long time now. When two people are on such different pages, it means someone wasn't communicating.  In this case, she'd been unhappy for probably months, while leading you to believe everything's fine. Doesn't that sort of make you angry? How are you supposed to correct a problem if you don't know about it? You can't.   Her reasoning is ""make shit up"" territory, and makes me wonder if she's been seeing another guy on the side who is buying her stuff and finally decided to let you go.  This isn't a failure on your part as a boyfriend. This was a failure on her part as a romantic partner to communicate problems to you.

As /u/drunkenmonkey89 and /u/lob5t3r said, document everything, take pictures of the stuff he sends you if you can't keep it. Let your family know whats happening as well, don't stay quiet about it, that could be a recipe for disaster. Be careful and wary. I know being paranoid isn't a good state to be in, but stay calm. If you're freaked out, take deep breaths and try to keep a level head about you, it'll help you in a dangerous situation, which god forbid, hopefully never arises.  Stay safe!"

relationship_advice,3e3u35,rsj4,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:15:43 2015 UTC,"Anger is a funny thing, depending on the real root of your anger it can take time or it can be short, some people take anger management courses which are not that long, it can help but it doesnt always get to the source.   For me nothing kills a relationship quicker than anger, especially out of control, anger, a temper etc because communication is derailed and bad things happen.  I think you need to get it under control or at least on a good path where you can see there will be a light at the end of the tunnel. So dont go out dating others but I wouldnt get right back in it until you are able to manage your anger."
relationship_advice,3e3u35,kc1328,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:21:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. My anger issues caused an ABSURD amount of miscommunication, trying to take things back, etc. and I think that really caused the ultimate downfall.

Keep any and all contact as short as possible.   You might also want to consider selecting better times to hang out with people he is friends with. Just like cutting contact means putting in efforts to not see them, hear about them, or speak to them, you need to put in the effort to avoid these situations if you are still bitter."

A deeply emotionally connected couple can work out these issues and make each other feel confident towards a future together. I think you're just so used to each other and have a physical history that you're both mistaking it for something more than it is.  We're humans, we bond easily. Nature made it that way. That's nobody's fault. But you have to ask yourself if the bond you find yourself in is a smart one, if it has the ingredients that are going to make you happy.  Otherwise, your loss of sex drive and weight gain may be related. You should see a doctor and check hormone levels and other conditions that may effecting you."

She brought up when I was whacked out on amphetamines sexting that girl. The thing is tho I really have wanted to be a good man for her since then. I'm sure at times I've slacked off and not put enough effort into our relationship over the years but the past few months I've really gone out of my way to make her feel special and it has felt like its gone unnoticed.

That's the soft lie you get.  2) Why do all these cheating threads always try to excuse the cheater with but they have depression and depression is fixed by sucking strange semen.  Every thread about cheaters includes the cheater being depressed.  Who gives a shit?  That's not an excuse to cheat.

It will hurt terribly for some time, but you will get over it. The other option is to live in fear and be hurt over a much longer time and eventually having to break up with her in the end anyway.

relationship_advice,3e1h1h,Smithdog1983,2,Tue Jul 21 13:15:41 2015 UTC,"I had a bipolar ex girlfriend that cheated on me in a similar twist of events.   I tried to make it work because I was delusional,  naive,  and we were in ""love"". The situation was toxic and filled with resentment.   Remaining with her only kept the wounds fresh and prohibited any recovery. There is this notion of the trickle truth that I can attest to.   From my experience I can say that your knowledge of the events is like an iceberg wherein you only see the tip.   Meanwhile there is a whole metric tonne of shit below the surface you are oblivious to.   You will never know the true extent of what went on and it will only drive you to unhealthy places and insanity trying to discover it.   There are plenty of good and honest people in the world for you to discover.   Don't subject yourself to an unrelenting road of suffering."

relationship_advice,3e1h1h,Sitral,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:04:18 2015 UTC,"That is an interesting question that I didn't really have an answer to.   Here is reflection on my situation.   It was good until it was bad.   What I mean by this is that from all perspectives she seemed like a genuine,  honest person.   It wasn't until the situation exploded in my face that I began to realize the true nature. The only way I can describe it is that she was missing something.  Perhaps empathy,  sympathy,  or lack of introspection.   She could twist and invent scenarios that would cause me to question my own memory and sanity.   She could twist elaborate lies without flinching.   This is something I was completely oblivious to until after the situation exploded.   She threatened to commit suicide.   At some point after about a year of trying to make it work I emotionally unplugged,  disengaged and disconnected.  I met and slept with a wonderful girl that taught me self-respect as well as self-worth.   I then hit the eject button and I have never been happier."

It may fail, but it can't even happen if you don't ask for a relationship. Don't settle for ""What if??"" when you can know.   Never marry for money.    Make very sound decisions concerning your money. Get a prenup because that's smart. Also understand that you don't know what life is going to bring you. Find someone who is going to be happy with you when you are dirt poor and filthy rich.  tl;dr: My ex-wife was only happy when we had money.   I spent almost 20 years doubling my income multiple times and ended up with a HUGE FUCKING PILE OF MONEY. It was never enough for her.   I realized that money can't make a relationship.

Now to say it was how it really was or if she let me see only the stuff she wanted me to see, i wouldnt be able to answer that. I hadnt put that kind of thought into it back then"
relationship_advice,3e3gld,jons_throwaway,2,Tue Jul 21 18:16:48 2015 UTC,Leave. She is trash. Wipe your feet and move on.
relationship_advice,3e3gld,StopStalkingMeB,2,Tue Jul 21 18:27:59 2015 UTC,"When i met her, she was in an abusive relationship. Her ex would treat her like shit and cheat on her with other girls.   She is still in an abusive relationship, only this time she is the abuser. It makes you really question the sincerity of the problems she was telling you about with her ex.  I think her breaking up with you is the best thing she could have possibly done for you. She is a cheater and doesn't respect or care about you enough to change that.   You might be a bit insecure, but she is giving you every reason to be. I think you need to cut contact with her and focus at moving on and finding someone willing to respect you the way everyone deserves. She definitely is not that person.   While you're at it, I would try to figure out what has stopped you from leaving her prior to this? It seems like you might lack esteem or confidence, and that should be something you work on."
relationship_advice,3e3gld,Stayinghereforreal,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:55:48 2015 UTC,"I didnt leave because i still loved her. As cheesy as it may sound... in my heart i really loved her, even though my head was telling me something else. I really wanted to believe her, but i could never brush off that thought that she'd cheat again.  I know i have issues like that, low selfesteem / confidence.. but whether it's because of what i've gone true and being lied to, or something i had before..i wouldnt be able to tell for sure. probably a bit of both, what happened definitely didnt help working on it."
relationship_advice,3e3gld,StopStalkingMeB,2,Tue Jul 21 18:06:57 2015 UTC,"tl;dr: simper simper simper  There will be plenty of people in life who treat you like crap, and will also claim to have your best interests as their concern.  We call these people assholes, and most people eject them from their lives.    Not you, apparently.  Quit it with the whole Hamlet soliloquy crap about low self esteem, confidence, blah blah blah.  Start owning your choices.  What you claim to be luuuuuuv is way more simple, mi amigo.  You like getting laid by her, and either you like, or you are willing to put up with, the emotional self-mortification that comes with it.  So yeah, if cuckolding and drama are your thing, go with this relationship, and quit pretending to yourself you are NOT into cuckolding and drama.  Maybe own up to your desire to be humiliated and cheated upon as part of what you want from a woman.    But if cuckolding and humiliation are NOT your thing, break up with the woman immediately, because she is apparently into putting you into that sort of role.  In either case, stop pretending you are not wholly and entirely creating the circumstances in which you live.  You are.  Every day you keep talking to this woman, it is 100% on you, since you know all you need to about her and what is going on."

relationship_advice,3e2jjj,DetectiveShaft,2,Tue Jul 21 13:41:12 2015 UTC,"You need to talk with her about it. Ask her to go out with you on what is definately precieved as a date. See how she reacts. Make it known that you have feelings developing for her and that you'd like to know how she feels. If you are honest with her, you should get honesty back!  Worst case senario, she does not feel the same way about you and you will have to work through whether you can deal with that or not.  Best case senario, she does have feelings for you and anything could happen!"

relationship_advice,3e2jjj,Timh37,2,Tue Jul 21 13:58:07 2015 UTC,"Ask yourself, how genuine would be your friendship if you continue without saying anything about your feelings concerning this matter? Would you be able to continue like there is nothing going on? I doubt it, I think it would influence your friendship with this girl, since you can't change how you feel and will develop certain expectations.   I would suggest to talk with her about this, or make a move. If it  turns out to be one-sided, that is bad luck and will probably change your friendship. However it is already altered by your feelings anyway, even if they are not spoken yet. Up to you what situation you prefer."

We both are pretty good at picking up on things like that, and I don't think I have done a very good job of hiding it from her :P I think I am going to go sit her down and tell her whats going on and just go from there.

relationship_advice,3e2ihg,outofcreddit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:31:59 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry that this happened to you.  You don't seem to be asking any questions, so I'll just tell you what I think about what you've said in the hopes of giving you some insight that may lessen your pain by providing you with some clarity about what just happened.     Our relationship has only been for 3 months   Have you heard of the honeymoon period?  Basically, for the first 6 months to a year of a relationship (or less, it's a different length of time for different people and different relationships), you're essentially dating who you want the other person to be.  It's easy to hide bad habits from the other person and be the best version of yourself, too.  Your brain is flooded with hormones that make you feel good when you're around them.  Then, this state wears off.  The hormones stop flooding your brain.  You can't hide your negative qualities and bad habits from the other person.  You suddenly see exactly who you are dating, and they aren't like the perfect version of them that had been in your head, where they were able to meet 100% of your needs.  You had a whirlwind romance, and it was just that - a whirlwind.  You both experienced extreme infatuation with one another that you mistook for love.  You committed way too quickly, visiting families, spending every day together, planning your lives together.  And that is crazy, because neither of you even knew the other person.  Love isn't a whirlwind.  Love is caring for the other person, even though they annoy you when they chew with their mouth open, and even though they leave their dirty socks on the floor, and even though they tend to shut down when they're stressed out.  You guys were nowhere near the reality of one another and therefore you were nowhere near love.  You had deep infatuation.  The trouble with infatuation is that it can disappear as suddenly as it began.  And so that is what you see here.  He had other options presented to him when he was away from you, and it made him question his relationship with you.  Once he started questioning, all the speedy commitments that the two of you made started to make him feel stifled and tied down in a way that made him feel uncomfortable.    I'm sorry this happened to you.  Let it be a lesson to slooooooooow down in the future.  I know the speed that the two of you moved felt good, but it wasn't healthy.  Now you see why.  Relationships that begin at the speed of light tend to end just as quickly.   I am absolutely lost without him!   You aren't lost without him.  You don't know him.  What you are attached to is the version of him that you created in your head, the one that you allowed to let you feel complete, and the two of you were going to be blissfully in love forever and ever.  That never existed.  And you also haven't realized that you're complete on your own, and that you've always been complete.   You don't need him.   And besides, you're getting glimpses of the real him - impulsive, somewhat selfish, wants what he wants when he wants it and once it becomes inconvenient he walks away from it.  His ego reigns supreme.  That is not a person who is a wise choice to tie yourself to because he is not a good prospect for commitment.    Even if he comes back to you, he's already expressed doubts and those aren't just going to disappear.  So even if he stays with you, he's going to have a foot out the door and will leave quickly again.  He has devalued you and your relationship in his mind, and it is not wise to stay with someone who has done this, because you will get very hurt.   At the time I was just coming out of a relationship   And one last word - you were just coming out of a relationship and you weren't in any shape to start a new one.  But you did, and in doing so, you projected all of your hopes and dreams onto the new guy.  Every need that wasn't met by your ex was going to be met by the new guy.  He was perfect and the answer to your prayers.  In other words, you rebounded, pretty hard.  Rebounds are all about illusions and projections."

relationship_advice,3e2ihg,Chees_a_saurus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:29:14 2015 UTC,"No, you should not try to work on the relationship.  He has expressed doubts, so if this is to be fixed, 95% of the effort must come from him.  He knows how you feel; there is nothing to be proved to him.  In my experience, with your situation, returning to happy commitment happens very rarely.  And even if it happens, with an impulsive person like him, it is likely to be temporary and driven by fears of being alone, rather than being driven by a commitment to make it work in the long term.    Be very careful and prioritize protecting yourself, because you are on the line to get your heart broken more than it already is.  It has nothing to do with how lovable a person you are, it has to do with timing and the person you are dealing with."

You didn't spend long in the Uncertainty/getting to know you stage, so it's not entirely surprising that some uncertainty (feeling smothered, rethinking life goals, etc) is coming to light now. You can try talking to him when he comes back and say you could try backing up and slowing it down A LOT and see how it goes."

relationship_advice,3e3c0w,miss_miggeli,7,Tue Jul 21 17:13:26 2015 UTC,His relationship with his girlfriend is crap if he hooked up with you.   His potential relationship with you would be crap because he has already proven that he is willing and able to cheat and will likely do the same to you.   It sounds like this was him getting lucky on the side and you falling too hard for a hookup.

I don't know if I want to be in a monogamous relationship myself and thats not just since I met him. Thats not the thing I'm worried about at the moment.

I wouldn't bring your feelings up with this guy. I would start looking for someone that is excited to be with you before and after sex.

relationship_advice,3dyaqu,Aggie219,43,Mon Jul 20 15:01:47 2015 UTC,"Yikes.  I would say that if you don't divorce, you two have a lot of work to do.  You'll have to address the lack of sex, and whether that can be resolved.  If he is going to resent you for wanting a sex life, then this isn't going to work.  You're obviously miserable without intimacy.  Then, you need to discuss the fact that he feels as if you raped him.  Even if you don't feel like this was the case, these are his feelings and they have to be addressed.  Let him know you never intended to force him into anything, but you do need intimacy.  You don't want to beg for it every time.  You want to feel desired.  Finally, you have to talk about the cheating.  It's up to your husband to determine whether you were right or wrong.  My opinion doesn't matter.  If he can't ever forgive you for this, then the marriage isn't going to work.  If he can truly forgive you, then maybe it can be salvaged.  It seems your relationship has some communication issues as well.  That's something else to acknowledge.  Ask him how he wants you to bring an issue to his attention.  You may think you're trying everything but he knows what he will respond best to.  Talk about how you argue, and what you both need to resolve arguments.  You have to both be on the same page on ALL of these issues.  If you don't agree on one of them, then you both would be happier in the long run if you went ahead and got divorced.  I know you love him, but you can't continue to be miserable."
relationship_advice,3dyaqu,Aggie219,7,Mon Jul 20 15:54:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this. He has a counseling appointment tomorrow afternoon and I hope that will help him decide how and what to do with the things I told him.   Oh, and I've definitely tried to approach him about the feelings of rape. As someone who has been assaulted in the past, I know those are feelings that are always valid and touchy to work around. I respect he feels that way and I am not trying to downplay it at all. My only issue was the fact that he dropped that bomb and then acted like it wasn't a big deal to have said."
relationship_advice,3dyaqu,Crushinated,4,Mon Jul 20 15:59:07 2015 UTC,"You're welcome!  I know you mentioned money was an issue, but I would really recommend couples counseling as soon as possible for both of you to work things out.

You wanted (needed) some stability and calm in your life-you married him. As you can see-it DOESN'T WORK.  Anyway, he's going to be much happier with someone who is more his speed. You are too. Do it while you are still  young, and weirdly enough, while  your kids are still young as well. I am a product of divorce and I would have been better off as a kid if my parents had done it earlier-that is my true opinion.

Maybe the personality change is associated with that.  It's a MAJOR stretch, but that might be worth checking out.  And if it is, then treatment and counseling.  Though at this point divorce seems likely."
relationship_advice,3dyaqu,LastArmistice,19,Mon Jul 20 19:16:21 2015 UTC,"Low T can definitely destroy sex drive.  But from what I've witnessed in my studies about reproductive health and therapies, men who develop Low T are often very disturbed by the diminishing libido and other symptoms.  His high and mighty, monk-like moral superiority about it suggests more of a psychological basis or even a coming to grips with an asexual-leaning sexual orientation, which is not significantly influenced by hormonal imbalances in most cases."
relationship_advice,3dyaqu,katorulestheworld,4,Mon Jul 20 23:36:21 2015 UTC,Yeah generally men with Low T or ED or other health issues miss sex and sexual desire on an intellectual level and want to get it back.

Seems to me, he's pretty much asexual and proud and his idea of compromise is never to have sex again. They could have a open relationship, with pre-set boundaries but the description of him crying like a lost child would suggest he's not able to handle the idea of his wife getting gratification somewhere else"

I'm just going to comment on this, since it's far better for you to talk to a professional rather than random people online.  You definitely should try to get to couples therapy. If he's still in the military, you can try the non-medical counseling offered to services members and their families. Some people have a great experience with it, others not so much. But regardless, it's a good first step, and will help you figure out what works for you and what doesn't in terms of therapy styles."
relationship_advice,3dyaqu,DexterMorgan21,88,Mon Jul 20 19:14:10 2015 UTC,"But he won't have sex with me and won't let me have sex with anyone else. He literally expects me to be okay with a sexless marriage because he's too insecure and is afraid I'll fall in love with someone else.   What I'm going to say doesn't fit for everyone, but it certainly seems to fit for you and I: A relationship without sex is a friendship.    Your husband can certainly be celibate his entire life (I'd ask him to get his testosterone checked), but you didn't sign up for that when you married him. You signed up for sexual exclusivity, not abstinence.    Tell him he has the following choices:  Divorce  Open relationship   He goes to the doctor and gets checked out and/or starts participating in sex. You will not accept 'duty sex' from him. If that's all he can provide, then he needs to be okay with you seeking it elsewhere or divorce."
relationship_advice,3dyaqu,raider_vader,12,Mon Jul 20 17:36:41 2015 UTC,"This is the best answer in this thread. You are not being remotely unreasonable with your needs, and your husband needs to understand that. Especially after all you did to 'change' for him to make yourself more attractive to him. If he isn't willing to change for you, than maybe it is time to start thinking of other options. If your husband is truly asexual, than an open relationship is an option. Don't give up, but know when to say when. This is your life and if you want to provide your son with a good life as well, you need to be happy."

My wife is also the kind of person to just sweep problems under the rug, forget about them and hope they go away. You I both know though, that OUR needs are just as important as theirs.   Meatros is right, it is time for him to be given options. If he chooses one, then great, go with that one. If he DOESN'T choose an option, you choose the option that best suits you and your needs."

The thing is, I expect monogamy from him so I can't expect to not put out.  If he asks, I give. It's a lesson my daddy taught me (not in a creepy way, we have a good relationship). Never say no to sex from your partner of you want the relationship to last."

relationship_advice,3dyaqu,tidderor,9,Mon Jul 20 18:58:27 2015 UTC,"There's enough red flags in this post to send an airplane down a runway.  He's got some screwy fucking ideas about sexuality that he should, if he wants to be healthy... work on. Even if he does, it's not going to go smooth or quickly.  You'll need to decide if you want to try to wait on him or not. He'll need counseling.  On that note... please remember that counselors are just like anyone else, just like any other profession. It's as hard to find a good counselor/therapist as it is to find a good auto mechanic. If you've ver needed to search for one of those, you know that you have to go through a few before you find a good one... or even one that you can trust.  So ""Shop"" for a therapist and don't feel bad about firing the ones that aren't helping. That's not to say you should ditch them just because they say something you don't like... be careful of that, but definitely spend some time 'choosing' a therapist.  Red flag #1  ""He's the type to eat his feelings and never speak a word. ""Ignore it until it goes away"" is his M.O.""  Red flag #2  ""He has told me before that he feels like he's calmed down my sex drive--like he was proud of it.""  Red (giant) flag #3  ""Another year forward and my husband admits to me that he doesn't masturbate, doesn't even think about sex (not even with other women!), and feels like he is superior to other people for not wanting sex. He told me, straight up, that he feels sorry for me for being such a slave to the orgasm.""  Red flag #4 (This is about him, not you, but it's a real problem if he's telling the truth here.)  ""He sat me down and said he feels like the only control he has in his life is sex and that the last couple times I asked him for some lovin, that he feels like I coerced him and raped him.""  This one... damn, I dunno.   ""But he won't have sex with me and won't let me have sex with anyone else. He literally expects me to be okay with a sexless marriage because he's too insecure and is afraid I'll fall in love with someone else.""  You shouldn't expect to be allowed to have ex with someone else, but sex is something that's important to you and is normal for most folks... It's unreasonable for him to expect you to go without and it's not right that he use sex to control you... these things he's said are pretty miserable.  Hope my little rant here helps in some way. You have some thinking to do and some decisions to make."

relationship_advice,3dyaqu,teknoise,3,Mon Jul 20 19:25:57 2015 UTC,"Step 1:  Learn how to communicate with your husband.  You may have no filter on the message, but it's clearly not getting through to him, nor are you able to get him to open up to you.  You are just as much an ostrich about his problem as him in a literal sense and then you followed it up by cheating, instead of letting him know it was at that point.  In many, many marriages between young people (of which I was one), they have NO CLUE what life is all about.  So they have no clue how to talk about real issues because they don't even know what the issues that they will have to confront.  Then, as they muddle through it, the issues get confused with the frustration and despair, which makes it harder to talk about.  Communication is not just saying what's on your mind, but getting through to the person you're addressing.  Some people need an emotional connection to communicate.  Others prefer strict rational concepts and there's a whole spectrum in between.  Sexual compatibility is definitely an issue here, but on his side of things, based on your description, he has almost a callous disregard for your needs.  On your side of things, you seem selfish and immature in problem solving.  If you want to save your marriage, you have to figure out how to get through to your husband and how he can get through to you.  Also, the 2 sentence lip service you pay your cheating in your post doesn't sound very remorseful and then you used it as a hammer on your husband?  That's going to be a whole separate discussion and I sure hope you have more to say than it's his fault for leaving you sexually frustrated.  YOU always had the option to get out when it became too much, but you went the coward's route instead.  And, just so you don't think I'm purposely trying to hurt you -- I was in your shoes and had a 2 week emotional affair -- I was a coward too."

You are either sexually compatible or you aren't. He's not suddenly going to magically get a sex drive. All the counselling in the world isn't likely going to match those 2 vastly different sex drives.  Life is shorter than you realize and you can spend it sexless, or put this all behind you and find someone compatible while you still have the rest of your 20s ahead of you.  Besides the lack of a sex drive, you're husband is a selfish asshole."
relationship_advice,3dyaqu,therealbighairy,2,Mon Jul 20 20:00:26 2015 UTC,"Well, you laid it out pretty plainly.  I think the next step is making a distinction in your mind between the reality of who he is and the idealized version of him that you're in love with.  You're in love with a physically attractive many who could make you feel loved, wanted, cherished, attractive, and satisfied, but chooses not to.  You're in love with what could be if he was basically different in very significant ways.  The man you're married to is far from that idealization, and you know it.  That's why you cheated and that's why you're finally doing the right thing and asking for a divorce.  He's not going to magically become the guy who makes you happy in your fantasies.  Look, these are fan-fucking-tastic reasons to divorce.  People divorce for much less, and they're not bad people for doing so.  If you're not happy, then asking for a divorce is okay.  Even if you, deep down, still hold a shred of hope that your partner will change in the massive ways they'd need to change in order for you to be happy in the marriage.   Once the papers are served and things are under way, they'll work themselves out eventually.  You have to get the ball rolling, and that's scary.  It'll be ugly.  Hardly any divorces are smooth and amicable.  Focus on keeping yourself together for your son's sake and make sure you keep your nose very fucking clean from here on out until the divorce is final."
relationship_advice,3dyaqu,loco_coco,4,Mon Jul 20 23:32:23 2015 UTC,"I was in a sexless marriage for about eight years.  I lost my entire sense of self, all my self esteem, and my family (not due to sex, but other issues my then wife had to do with habitual lying).  The only fix was for me to get out.  I only stayed for my daughter, and for all that I still cared about my wife, there was no love there.  I can't remember if I ever actually loved her anymore, because of all those years of hurt.  He can't change his sex drive, only his holier-than-thou attitude to sex.  If you stay in this relationship, then you are both going to end up hurting, because you have a need that he isn't willing to fulfil.  It is a basic human need.  For the sake of yourself, you need to leave him.  For the sake of your son, you need to leave your husband, before you start to resent them.    Loving him only goes so far, if he isn't willing to love you the way that you need to be loved."

relationship_advice,3dyaqu,notevenapro,2,Mon Jul 20 16:44:57 2015 UTC,"I would most certainly think he was either depressed or had some issues with anxiety. To say that the sex was the only thing he had control over in his life is anxiety. Similar to eating disorders.  I've suffered from both anxiety and depression in my past. My anxiety was so bad that it caused me to (unknowingly)  isolate myself and become depressed.   That could also explain why he feels good to be able to control his sexual desire and is projecting it onto you and you ""not being able to control"" your sex drive.   Hopefully his therapist will be able to get him to open up enough to get to the root of the problem. Especially if he is feeling like the well-being of his family as a unit is completely financially dependent on him. Not that it's a bad thing, but he could have, without realizing it, put so much pressure on himself as far as work and providing for the family goes that's is spiraled. And he may not even be aware that that's what he did.   I wouldn't beat yourself up too much about cheating. There are definitely some deep issues at hand and once those are dealt with then you can worry about the cheating and tackle that issue. Really it's just a symptom of the broken relationship. It will all come in time, hopefully. Good luck!"
relationship_advice,3dyaqu,hukkit,0,Mon Jul 20 20:39:16 2015 UTC,My advice is going to be harsh and to the point.   Get a divorce. Your husband cannot stand you but cannot bring himself to tell you. You killed the sex life because you are a shitty person. You know you are. I read between the lines. I see the anger and attitude that makes you 100% unattractive.  You marriage is 100% over. Get a divorce so this poor guy can move on and find someone he can be happy with.   I am blown away that you are getting support in this thread when you are the problem.

relationship_advice,3dyaqu,dylang92,0,Mon Jul 20 18:40:42 2015 UTC,"Desire is the root cause of all suffering. Wether we want to experience pleasure or avoid pain. It's natural and healthy to want to experience pleasure. But we must have self control to be happy. Pleasure isn't happiness. They are different things. If you enjoy something so much that of you don't get it your feel bad that aren't happy, than that desire is causing you to suffer. If you are interested in finding a balance I would suggest dietary modifications,  practicing yoga for glandular(hormonal) balance, our another exercise. Craving for intensity... I can feel you have a lot of Fire in your constitution. If you would like more help you can pm me for ways to balance yourself more. But the whole point is that we have to master our mind. As it is most of us are slaves to our mind, through the sense organs and their external objects. But we all have the potential to be kings and queens... because Id rather be happy than get temporary pleasure sometimes. I'm not saying you can't have pleasure if it comes. If it doesn't come then I would rather be content. Yes, it sounds like it would help you to have more sex also. I think you would benefit from talking with your husband honestly, once you aren't under the influence of strong emotions (which are the cause of most relationship problems). I really think you will benefit from some intense yoga. You will feel blissful i am sure. What is your lifestyle/ job like? Diet? How often do you exercise and what kind?

With him in the military, you'll easily get child custody - possibly sole custody.  You'll collect child support for the next 15-18 years guaranteed.  There's a good chance you'll get 5+ years of alimony as well.  You can have all the benefits you're currently getting out of the marriage (financial support so you can be with your child and not work) while being free to bang all the guys you want.  The only reason to not get divorced now is that you'll get more alimony the longer you are married.

See, if she has half a brain, when she calms down she will probably realize, although maybe not admitting it to you, that there is really nothing you said or did that can be held against you.  Then again, she is emotionally very involved in this situation, and her emotions ran rampant. If she does not see the huge value of you keeping your cool in this situation after she calms down, that is really on her.  Give it some time. Be a reliable rock. Chances are she will come around big time once she realizes that maybe she could have handled this differently.  The above of course presuming she is able to self-reflect.

I don't think her and I will be continuing this relationship, even if she does contact me and apologize.  Unfortunately, this situation was a major red flag and ultimately a deal breaker.  The unresolved issues she has with her ex is not something I, or anyone else, can magically solve for her.  She needs to do some self reflection and figure out where she wants to be and who she wants to be there with.  I also believe that she should try to figure out her role in all of this.  Whether it's her actions in our relationship, or how she ended up having a child with a man she claims she never really loved, she rarely accepts responsibility for her own actions.  It's always someone else's fault, or somebody is not doing enough for her.  I think the biggest problem throughout our entire relationship was her lack of personal responsibility and accountability.  Now, she's run of people to point the finger at.  She turned against me, because I was the last person she could blame for her problems and her current situation.    I can only hope that she figures out her role in all of this, and is able to come to peaceful terms with it.

You shouldn't have to wonder when he'll trust you enough to give you emotional support again. A relationship is half independence and half co-dependence. Mental illness or not, emotional support should always be available to a partner. You have come so far in picking yourself up and focusing on self care of the mind and body, and he should be supportive of and recognize those efforts. I don't want to be crazy and jump the gun and suggest breaking up, but it will be hard if you don't feel that he is emotionally supportive or if you now fear going to him for support. LDR are also generally hard, especially if one partner is dealing with mental illness. Maybe lay it all out for him straight forwardly. Tell him that you feel like you've really picked yourself up and have relied on him less, and when he reacted the way he did to the one instance of you leaning on him for support, you lost faith in him as support. In all honesty though, you shouldn't have to do anything to ""earn"" his emotional support. You deserve emotional support from your partner and this (imo) should be something flowing freely between partners in a relationship."

What's more likely is that your partner gave her signals, whether it's outright telling her or something less direct, that he was going to get rid of you and be with her.   This is probably a case of your partner saying whatever he's got to say to keep both women in his life. And that's exactly what he's doing now, too: Saying what he's got to say to keep you around.  You have so much invested in this guy emotionally, but he's probably just trying to make sure you don't leave -- which isn't the same thing as wanting you to be happy.

We all have different opinions on what a relationship should entail. Personally, I would've been out as soon as the other girl came to me. But you stuck with it for some reason.  I'm not going to define that he cheated. if it was my relationship he definitely did. But if you outlined that was cheating or accepted his actions, then who are we to tell you to leave him. But then again you posted on RA. Nothing you said about this guy was positive.    I know I sound as if I am the stupidest person on earth   I wouldn't say that, but you have zero self respect. You're letting this guy walk all over you. To me, he cheated, had a baby (serves him right), got arrested for whatever crazy they did, she lives in the same neighborhood.   I'd move, not tell him, and block his number or change my number. You don't owe this guy a break up. Do what makes you happy. This guy doesn't have any respect for you.

My gf (22) is also depressed and on meds. Myself (M30) have been on meds now for 3 months. Its changed my life. The way we deal with depression and anxiety is to be very open about it, but also a bit harsh on each other. This helps to  sort of shake you out of it. Communication is key. And yes its possible for someone to love you even if you dont. Get a routine where you wake up stand in the mirror and say positive things to yourself."

The things he points out about you aren't ""mistakes"" on your part. These are things that he has cued into to use as a manipulation tactic. You are honestly in an abusive relationship. He is chipping away at your self worth with his comments. He has complete disregard for your feelings and comfort (forcing you to watch violent, disturbing videos, and saying that you embarrassed him by fainting). In a healthy relationship, your partner would be concerned about the fact that you did not eat all day and would worry. Being embarrassed should be the last thing on his mind. The fact that he never lets you pay for your meals together is likely his twisted way of building up your dependency and reliance on him. It seems like he is trying to make it so that you end up so emotionally and physically dependent on him that you will be unable to leave. It is also emotional manipulation. He is masking this as a kind deed. If you bring it up, it is likely he will call you ungrateful and paint himself as a generous gentleman. He is also trying to tie you down to him by trying to convince you to stay in the city, marry him and have his kids. By that point, it will be much, much more difficult to escape this situation. Has he ever asked whether you want to stay in the city? Where you want to live? If you want to get married? I'm willing to bet probably not. You owe him no apology, you owe it to yourself to leave. You are too beautiful and intelligent a woman to settle for an abusive man. There are so many men who are kind and truly generous, free from this emotional abuse and manipulation bs, and also bomb as fuck in the sack. Why settle? Set yoursef free and be emotionally and physically fulfilled! Don't be concerned about whether he hates you or not after this, just be glad that you will be free."

At first I didn't think it was intentional but the more I read about relationships and emotional/mental abuse the more I suspected it. I still don't think it's intentional, just that he can't see that he's doing it. I just didn't think he would ever be capable of any of this so I think I'm defending him still.

relationship_advice,3e1ej1,katorulestheworld,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:10:58 2015 UTC,"The dynamic you've created is that which is based on conditioned love. The situation is a little messy at the moment.   You see, if we strip it down to basics. He has 2 girls he talks to and cares for (friend or romantic). One of them is being difficult and the other is open. It's like physics, gravity moves in the direction it moves. It takes a conscious man to see what is happening and make conscious choices, but this isn't the case when we become overly emotional.  The truth of the matter is that this has nothing to do with winning, being competitive, manipulating him into liking you more, etc... True and Honest Loving is to wish the other to thrive even if it means they move on. Maybe that's the case, maybe not. Don't focus on the part.   What will free you from all of the mental and emotional torment is to pause, breathe, and surrender for a bit. Allow everything to come as it comes, stay as it stays, and go as it goes. Not trying to engage or change anything. Take a second to let yourself have a biological moment.   Understand that it is easy for our minds to fictionize a story, exaggerate what is really the case, and instead of meeting life directly as it actually is, we put it through filters and only see a small part of a grander story.  I'll tell you about a woman that I loved. I had struggled thinking that developing crushes and having attraction to other women was a bad thing. My culture told me so, and I felt dishonest. But she loved me anyways. When I couldn't take the internal struggle anymore, I told her everything I had been feeling and thinking. And she loved me anyways. And that made me love her more. When we had conflict and I had talked with another girl to sort out my stuff, she chose not to be jealous, but chose to be understanding. And that made me love her more. For whatever came up, love, not possession, was the priority. And we thrived together. She never tried to win me, or be better than another girl I had admired.  We naturally are repelled by people that compete and try to win over us or win us for self worth. We are naturally attracted to those who will love us, even when we don't.  Don't compete, don't try and win him or win against him. Be there for him, with him, and move together through this experience. That's what you do when you are bonded with someone. No matter what happens, no matter the circumstance or the story, you move through it together as partners. And if you two split up. You still move forward with a whole lot of care and love for one's self and with a deep resolve to be happy and thriving.  That's really the secret to being a winner at life, is to chose to be happy. And choosing to do as a happy person would. Role models are so important to us because it helps us to wonder what they would do, and it gets us out of our small little mental box we were in.  I encourage you to be more conscious of your words, your intent in which you use them from, and for what purpose you are using them. Ask questions. What is needed for the highest good? What needs to be said? What needs to be dropped? What actions would I do from a loving place? What wisdom will I remind myself of when conflict arises? What is needed from me to love this person more? Is it possible to love more? How easy would it be to express happiness and joy? I wonder what great treasures will come out of this experience?  Blessings, best of luck"

EDIT:  don't think those 1 in 5 people are the smuts you stay away from.  Herpes effects all races and classes pretty indiscriminately.  Second of all, what type is it?  HSV1 is pretty common now and much less severe than HSV2.  If she is on maintenance meds the female to male risk of transmission is pretty low.    Thirdly, it's really not a big deal.  You might already have it and not know.  That's how mild it is in a lot of people and why it spreads so easily.  Fourthly, this girl was straight up and told you.  She didn't have to.  That says a lot about her character and the type of person she is.  I'd say read up on it.  If you like this girl and see a future don't let it scare you away.

relationship_advice,3dyb4p,givoly,17,Mon Jul 20 22:14:14 2015 UTC,"It's important to keep things in perspective.  About 15-25% of the population has genital herpes and about 50% has oral herpes (which can cause genital herpes).  In total about 60% of the population has some form of herpes.  In essence, herpes is very prevalent.  In addition, for most people herpes is more of an annoyance than an actual health issue.  Sure, there are some risks involved but they can be managed.  If she is on antivirals, the female to male transmission risk is 2%.  That means that if 100 infected women on antivirals had unprotected sex with 100 uninfected men that only 2 out 100 men would get herpes in a year.  Condoms reduce the risk another 30-50%.  In addition, you're more likely to get herpes from someone who doesn't know they have it than from someone who does.  80% of people with herpes don't know they have it.  You need to decide for yourself whether she is worth it.  Don't let other people tell you she is or isn't worth it - they don't know your relationship.  You need to think about both your goals, her character, your risk tolerance, and whether you see a life together with her.

relationship_advice,3dyb4p,baller_unicorn,7,Mon Jul 20 15:31:24 2015 UTC,"It's just herpes. The only reason herpes is so feared is because of the stigma against it. The worst part is that if you get it, you will also have to tell your future sexual partners and it is very possible that you will get turned down because of it. A lot of people have the virus but don't even know because they don't have symptoms and a lot of people have one outbreak but never get symptoms again (if they are treated on the first outbreak). And even if you do have symptoms there is a medication that works really well to control them. Also it is not life threatening, nor are the symptoms even that bad. Also there is medication that can prevent transmission of the virus.   Honestly I don't even know if I would call it a ""lifelong disease"" do you say that people who get cold sores on their lips occasionally have a lifelong disease?  I would definitely be careful and talk to your doctor about how to prevent transmission and for now take steps to prevent it until you are sure you want to have a long term relationship with her. But I wouldn't let it stop you from having a normal relationship with her. She did nothing wrong, and in fact it shows a lot of character and honesty to tell you.

relationship_advice,3dyb4p,your_what_hurts,5,Mon Jul 20 15:43:48 2015 UTC,Having herpes and having children is a safe process.  It's just a round of acyclovir during the last trimester.  People who don't know they have herpes and aren't treated are at risk of causing severe I'll was in their newborns.

I was just throwing out there that any step for a healthy happy relationship would be wise if it's something he truly wants. Love is love and it's a beautiful thing. I just hope all works out for the best."

relationship_advice,3dyb4p,morganlafaye,5,Mon Jul 20 18:12:46 2015 UTC,"A few things: 1) I think it would benefit you to do some research on Herpes this handbook is an amazing resource about transmission rates, getting tested and how to prevent contraction. It also may put Herpes into perspective for you, it really isn't that big of deal to most people.   2) If you haven't had this conversation you need need to, to find out if she has HSV 1 or HSV 2 and where it presents (mouth or genitalia). Also if she's on antivirals and how often she has outbreaks. If she can answer your questions and is willing to engage in that sort of conversation I'd say that's a great sign of not only her maturity but also that she's responsible about her condition. If she can't, well I'd worry because her not knowing her condition means you are far more likely to be exposed and contract.  Either way, be kind to her though, she's in a very vulnerable place right now, don't make her feel dirty or wrong!  3) If you havent had a herpes blood test you should get one. 70% of sexually active adults in America are already carriers of HSV1 or 2, if you already have the antibodies for 1 or 2, and you have the same one she has, then have all the sex you want with her, worry free. If you are a carrier and haven't had an outbreak, being sexual with her isn't going to change that. (Also most doctors don't do blood tests for herpes routinely so even if you've had STD testing don't count on it that they also tested you for HSV.)  4) Ultimately Herpes is just a cold sore, it isn't life threatening and at most a minor inconvenience. If you really like this woman, just use condoms and don't have sex when she's having an outbreak until you're really sure about her."

relationship_advice,3dyb4p,copsgonnacop,2,Mon Jul 20 20:54:02 2015 UTC,herpes. I really do like her and her personality but I have so much time ahead of me I'm wondering whether it's worth dealing with the difficulties that are involved   There are no difficulties involved.
relationship_advice,3dyb4p,rachmw,0,Mon Jul 20 18:06:11 2015 UTC,"I think you should go with your heart. Yeah I know that sounds cheesy. Can you truly see yourself being with her for the rest of your life? Does she have a great personality? Could you see yourself marrying her one day? Could you see yourself having kids with this woman on down the line if you want them? If you answered no to any of these questions, I would not do it.   Me personally, I would not chance it. I am a 32 year old female and never had a STD. It's not like your 50 years old. You still have your whole life ahead of you. What if it doesn't work out and you get the herps and you meet someone down the line that won't be with you because of that? It's risky so you do what you feel is right. Also look up pictures of herpes and read stories. Trust me, that's something you do not want. I know a girl who has been with two guys and her last boyfriend of 5 years cheated on her. She is beautiful, but has herpes and she was telling me how hard it is to find a man. She has had two outbreaks and she said it itched, hurt, and burned so bad that she wanted to die. She has paid out a lot of money for her medicine and has to live a life with a disease she got from a man who cheated on her and she never once saw a sore on him when they had sex.  Me personally, I would never chance it being that young. This is your choice man. I am sure it is hard if you're kinda falling for her but there are so many other girls out there. Then again, you could get with one instead of her and get a STD."

Her having herpes doesn't give you a 100% chance of getting it. If she is on medication and you use protection, the risk of you getting it is extremely low. If you guys want kids down the road, there's always insemination. And who knows, maybe by the time it matters, a cure will be around. If she has a good personality and you really are happy around her, give her a chance. Don't listen to the fuckheads who comment no without giving any explanation. It's likely they are just shallow assholes."

I did found information about certain people being more prone to visible outbreaks due to their genes but this doesn't mean that they are the only ones that have visible outbreaks. If you have any sources that say only people with specific genes experience outbreaks that would be great! :)   Hence the reason I have never given any of my partners cold sores   Just because someone doesn't have outbreaks or possibly isn't genetically prone to visible outbreaks doesn't mean they don't shed the virus asymptomatically. Asymptomatic viral shedding is enough to infect others."

relationship_advice,3dywch,Thecardinal74,8,Mon Jul 20 23:09:09 2015 UTC,"With a lot of what you wrote, I just think 'well, she is his best friend'.  Then I get to this:   Then, the same thing happened - we were supposed to be spending the day together, and she took over, this time not inviting me (she hates me now oops).    No, she's overstepping her boundaries. She's making him choose between her and you.     I don't want my boyfriend feeling like I'm dictating who he can/can't be friends with, but I also really don't get a good vibe from her.    It's odd that she is essentially a dictator to him, yet you feel bad being one to him. I'm not saying this is bad on your part, btw - it just struck me as odd.     What should I do/Did I do the right thing?   Well, she's clearly overstepping her bounds. I don't think you have to worry about the typical things (ex. cheating) with their relationship, but she does overstep, IMO.  The most important person in his life - especially if you get married - should be you. She seems to repeatedly want to test that. I would not be comfortable with that dynamic.  I'm not sure how the conversation went down with you and her. She probably has tremendously hurt feelings because of you - you caused her to lose her best friend.  Did you try to talk to her before hand? Tell her to cut the shit with ruining the plans you had with your BF? Or did you go to the nuclear option first?"
relationship_advice,3dywch,Meatros,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:44:32 2015 UTC,I went nuclear first hahahaha probably not the best idea...
relationship_advice,3dywch,Meatros,2,Mon Jul 20 17:46:57 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay.  That is kind of on you then. You should have reached out to her with your concerns first. I think you need to attempt to mend bridges - my guess is that she was really not kind to you on your first attempt. So make another. Let her vent and apologize. Tell her that you realize that you handled things badly and that you should have come to her first and told her that you didn't appreciate her getting in between your boyfriend and you when she disrupted the plans you two had made. That she was putting herself into situations where your BF had to choose between you two. That wasn't fair on her part."
relationship_advice,3dywch,bum_stabber,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:51:13 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day it was his choice. You didn't get along with her and you felt he was bad for her, so you ask him to choose. If there is absolutely no way the two of you can ever get along and you made a good-faith effort to try, then you presented it to him and gave him a choice. If he wants to continue to have a friendship with her and you really don't think it will work, then you should definitely break up with him. I think the worst thing you could do is to keep him in the middle trying to make you both happy."

You asked him to choose, and he did. He should have told you no. So yeah, she's going to resent you, because she sees this guy as totally weak-willed and therefore all the blame rests with you for putting the idea in his head. In reality, she should resent him because it was his decision to make. He doesn't seem willing to say ""no"" to either of you; whether it's inviting his best friend along on dates or severing long-standing friendships because you suggest it. So maybe he is rather weak-willed... but the situation can be mended. Give them their space to hang out without getting insecure about those ""bad vibes"", and insist that you get the same in return: When you're spending time with your boyfriend, the third wheel isn't invited. You'll still see her at family holidays, or in passing, and yes there will be passive aggressive tensions, but so long as nothing else comes to the point of ultimatum things should go smoothly."

relationship_advice,3dywch,Warpfrenzy,0,Mon Jul 20 19:58:05 2015 UTC,Your BF should have set better boundaries. He didn't so she continued to overstep them. You come into the picture and aren't comfortable with this. That all makes sense.  I guess the problem here is how your BF decided to step away from this girl. He didn't need to cut ties just set up some ground rules. So that one is on you. I understand why she is upset with you.   Fast forward a year and now you are in the same place since he still hasn't learned to set boundaries. He needs to talk to her and fix that part.  Random thoughts   (she hates me now oops)  makes it seem like you don't care that someone your BF trusts like family is part of his life Your BF needs to grow a backbone and stand up for himself to you and this BFF. You are jealous of what they have. Which is a good friendship and nothing more. It would have gotten to more if it was going to.
relationship_advice,3dywch,makethatnoise,0,Mon Jul 20 19:52:55 2015 UTC,"To me, ""bitchy"" doesn't matter at all. You were honest with your boyfriend about being uncomfortable, which is the right thing to do! Couples communicate. If he agreed to cut ties with her to focus on the relationship you two share, he was obviously very invested in the relationship.  I would talk to him again. Ask him why he feels the need to spend time with her, she's probably an important friend and important to him. Then I would suggest the three of you talk together. He can tell her he wants to be her friens, but express your importance to him. Then the three of you can talk, she can say she was hurt and you can apoligize. You three can get everything on the table and have a clear way of friendship in the future.  She's hurt and youre upset. If you all don't talk nothing will get fixed and the situation could escalatE further and that's stupid."

relationship_advice,3e1qsl,Christina_Rose,3,Tue Jul 21 08:32:21 2015 UTC,"It's a harmless thing to you. You already took notice how others perceive your behavior. This will always be hurtful to her, because she feels like she can't give you enough. Humans are suckers for looking for someone responsible and the first one to be there is themselves. She feels like she isn't the way she would need to be for you to truly be hers. To her it feels like her love for you is not good enough.   Moreover, you will not change her mind. Looking at the norms in our society, the behavioral guideline that the majority follows, your behavior is wrong and the majority of the people around her will tell her that she is right to be upset (I think so as well, just to be clear). Either you seek out a relationship with someone who is also looking for a relationship with loose boundaries or you'll try to change.  I think you already made good progress in identifying a potential reason for your behavior. If you want to change this behavior, try to explore the issues you have with the relationship (i.e. never had a sex with a different woman) with your girlfriend. You're not abnormal for having this issue. Lots of people who stay with the same person they lost their virginity to over a long time are prone to want to experience something new. My girlfriend is insecure about my state as well, since she is also my first everything. However, there is a better way to deal with this. When you think about this, maybe you get to the conclusion that you want to meet more women and it's ok if you want to, just end your current relationship before you end it. You may also get to the conclusion that your urges are not as important as your girlfriend, then you need to work on not letting it affect you as much, preferably together with your girlfriend (maybe in the form of roleplay etc.)"

Whispering in some guy's ear seems flirty, and it's hard to believe it was innocent, even if nothing happened. What you did isn't a big deal, but it isn't nothing, either.  Is he overreacting? I think so, if everything you've said is accurate.   But ask yourself, how would you feel if you were in his shoes? If you saw him whispering in some woman's ear, would you think it was innocent and ok? Probably not. And being drunk doesn't make you do things you don't want, it just lowers your ability to not do things you know you shouldn't.  He shouldn't hold it against you, and it shouldn't ""strain"" things for long. If it does, he's being too possessive and jealous. Although, one final thought to consider: how much of the strain is him being angry/jealous/whatever, and how much of it is feelings of guilt you might not be admitting to?"

I believe the right thing to do here is to simply talk to K. Ask her how she feels about it. If she disapproves ask her the reason behind so? Maybe what bothers K is the fact that you and M simply just hook up and maybe she fears one of you might get hurt? Tell her that your feelings for M are more than just that. It seems like efficient communication is going to be key here. Talk to K in a neutral setting and be honest with her. Good luck.

relationship_advice,3dyl69,bomberboy7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:37:34 2015 UTC,I must have misread. Talking to M first would definitely be the wisest choice. And if she shares the same feelings as you then the next best step would to be to talk to K.
relationship_advice,3dyl69,accidentproned,2,Tue Jul 21 21:35:19 2015 UTC,"Why would it have to get awkward? Awkwardness is temporary, and if you just let your feelings build up it can cause more damage than just laying them out on the open. I'm especially confused as to how ""fooling around"" is easy to bounce back from, but saying you're starting to like her might be a bit much.  Look bro. I'm going to lay it out for you honestly. You and K sound like you have a good friendship going. You said she was there for you, and you said she was a little bit upset when you and M fooled around. I won't say that was jealousy, cause I don't know her thought process, but I will say that was likely the feelings of a friend who felt like you went a little behind her back to get to her sister.  You said K is a good friend who's been there for you. Pull her aside and talk to her 1 on 1, and let her know you want it to be a personal conversation, not to leave the two of you. And just lay it out for her. Tell her you like her sister. Tell her you want to act on it. You, of course, don't need her permission. But this way she'll feel less like you're going behind her back, and she might even be able to help since it sounds like K and M are close (if M is still into you, of course).  Best of luck to you mate."

Marriage isn't Til Sexual Fantasies Do Us Part. You owe it to him and yourself, to at least try and make it work after that sort of emotional investment/commitment.  I would try a few things with your husband before giving up. Communicate with him more, try doing romantic things for him, and see about spicing things up in the bedroom. Maybe you just need something different, maybe roleplay could fulfill your needs.  I know it's hard, but it wouldn't really be much of a commitment if it was always easy."

I feel like you have a strong enough of a relationship that it won't be hurtful if you explained it to him. Have you ever considered swinging? Or a threesome? Or having your husband and you try roleplay? Like the cuckold fetish.

It seems she has body image/self esteem issues that could have existed before her rape, as a result of her rape, or maybe even as a result of having birthed two children. In addition to counseling, try to work in casual, daily remarks that lift up her image of herself (not just her physical image, but her overall perception of herself). ""Honey, you look beautiful in that outfit today!"" ""You're a wonderful wife because ..."" ""I love when you cook..."""

Definitely doing some of that first thing in the morning (with some coffee of course). I should also mention that we also recently joined a gym, which she rarely uses. I know she would feel better physically and emotionally if she got more physical exercise. Need to figure out a way to rope her into more activities too!  Also to clarify, she's not enormous or hideous to look at. We are both not incredibly fit, but definitely not morbidly obese by any means :-) I do tell her that I find her attractive, but I don't think she feels sexy anymore. Probably goes back to the therapy..."

The hardest part is getting into the gym clothes to go, but once you are there you don't regret it. Also, some gyms are not very friendly for self-conscious people. I like a particular planet fitness because it is quite open and hardly have many people around me, maybe make sure she's in one that she is comfortable with. Some towns even have gyms for only women so that might be an option too.  Also, to get the sexy feeling back, have a date night. A formal date night. You get dressed up, she gets dressed up. Let her do her hair, makeup, wear the high heels she probably hasn't touched in a while. This actually does wonders on a girl's self esteem just making yourself look pretty. Go somewhere a little fancier than usual. :)"

She often emphasizes how important it is to her for us to be active together.   I think in a lot of ways my support and intentionality behind being active/proactive is way more beneficial than my words of affirmation. I know it's hard, we have a 15 mo. old, but if you can find ways to integrate the kids and make it a family affair, maybe that would move things in the right direction?

relationship_advice,3dwhlw,Femplay,15,Mon Jul 20 17:44:24 2015 UTC,"Like many women, after having children we don't always feel like we are still an attractive and sexy woman. Even if our husbands or lovers are telling us that they still think we are. This can unfortunately last for a number of years. This can still happen even when we know we are looking after ourselves with exercising and diet. It can just be our mental state after a big change in our bodies. The best thing is to reassure her of how you feel about her. Tell her you love her and that you love her body, bumps and all. Reminder her that she gave you 2 precious children and that you feel in love with her more for doing so. If she isn't exercising ask her to go for a walk with you and your children to the local park. This will not make her think that you believe she has a weight issue, it is just another way to bring some romance back into your lives and including the children reminds her what a beautiful gift that she has given to you all by making you a family."

Something tangible that you can commit to, like maybe find a local charity 5k to sign up for in a couple months, and then start doing C25K (you can do it either outside with a timer or in the gym on treadmills by time or distance!). If she's a redditor, send her to /r/xxfitness and /r/brogress (search ""F/"" there to bring up progress posts by women to show her), and you could try some free weights together.

""Honey, I've been thinking a lot about our discussion the other day. You know I think you're the sexiest woman alive, but I want us to BOTH feel good, and feel like we look good, and set an example of health and fitness for our children. I've been doing some research, and I found a running/free weight program that we could ease into that other couples have used to lose weight and get stronger, I think we should try it, and I think we should make a promise to ourselves right now to both get healthier.""

I don't think it has anything to do with the rape from before she met you. If anything all that great sex you had, likely helped her out! Showed her that things can be good again.  I would say just give her time. Make her feel like you love her body no matter what. She will come around."
relationship_advice,3dwhlw,beingtortured,7,Mon Jul 20 08:10:05 2015 UTC,"A 3 year old and a 10 month old! And she works! Honestly I think she may just be exhausted.   I'm going to make some big generalizations here, they may or may not apply. Women do go through big physical and emotional changes after having kids, but the hardest to cope with is just trying to take care of everything. No matter how hands on a father is, there is an oppressive sense of responsibility for every little thing felt by mothers. Working mothers also feel worse because they have to make compromises and this provokes an oppressive sense of guilt.   It is hard after baby 1, but baby 2 can be crazy emotionally and physically draining. On top of that, many parents don't figure out how to get babies to sleep until baby is a year+. Which means that in an emotional crucible, they are tired, making thinking your way through things that much harder.   All of this combines to make many women, tense and exhausted - a complete libido killer. Many women need to relax before they can feel like sex is even a possibility. (Many men seem to use sex in order to relax and don't understand). Plus, I guarantee that she knows how you feel and it is another layer of guilt. She is possibly seeing it as another aspect of taking care of another person and the list is full.   My advice: 1) Give her some time. 2) Do more around the house than asked even if you are already doing an equal share. 3) Get her some extra sleep (read a pop science study that for every additional hour of sleep per night for women leads to an 20% increase in sexual activity - I swear it's true). 4) Don't worry too much about her body image stuff. It is pretty normal at 10 mos post partum to feel a weird disconnect with one's body. Taking care of 1-3 will give her space to figure it out."
relationship_advice,3dwhlw,J-Bru,2,Mon Jul 20 12:59:00 2015 UTC,"Hey OP. Firstly I empathize with your situation. I was previously engaged to a woman who was a victim of rape, and i know how difficult it can be dealing with someone whos emotionally disconnected from themselves in certain aspects of communication. The thing is, u are a mature individual and have the tools to perfectly deal with the situaion, ie your wife still loves u. Imho, i think the solutions are not always as simple as words or actions, but that doesnt mean you shouldnt try them. This is an emotional and mental issue she is struggling with and problems of the mind arent something that antibiotics can easily remedy. It takes commitment, patience and love. you must be willing to understand that in times of tension and great frustration that u must, as a husband maintain resolve and continue to push through and understand what needs to be done. Affection in its purest form. Dont only tell her how beautiful she is, but show it. Randomly bring her flowers, hug her from behind, caress her hair, kiss her forehead. Remind her how soft her skin feels, tell her how warm her love is. this is going to be a tremendous feat of commitment on your part but its time for your vows to kick in; sickness and in health. I trust u are a great man who loves your wife otherwise you wouldnt have come to us seeking advice. I would encourage couples therapy if the initial affection doesnt work because sometimes a professional is needed in dealing with these deep seeded emotions, someone who objectively will not take any aggression as something personal, because that is the inherent dangers of dealing with these individuals. You begin to think u are part of the problem.  Good luck my friend. I wish u and your wife many happy years of marriage. Ill keep u in my prayers."

Find a Cognitive Behavioral Therapist, plus, try to open up the realm of sex and closeness try new types of foreplay, read sexy novels together, watch sexy silly funny anime porn. Show her sex doesn't have to be at all like the movies. Normal people of all shapes and sizes do it everyday and women are often far more stimulated by erotic reading/the build up and teasing that lead to sex. It's all about the mentality.  Addressing weight, depression, other life issues, this is where it's a bandaid when feeling low.  Sometimes, when I am at my worst and don't feel like cleaning because I'm depressed and totally without energy, I watch shows about hoarding. This not only makes me feel like, well, on the grand scale I'm actually doing just fine, plus, it gives me incentive to get up and finish just one project that's been cluttering the dining room table. Or just admit it's on hold and put clutter away (clean/organize) until I'm really ready to work on things.  This isn't to say she'll have the same reaction, but it doesn't hurt sometimes to embrace the fact that many of us are incredibly lucky compared to people down the street or around the world. Our favorite shows generally feature the very trim, pretty and well off members of society and we have very high standards as far as life development, money goals, just, everything. It's okay to say, I'm not Oprah or Elon Musk, I'll just never have that much energy. Likewise, it doesn't hurt to watch some shows that remind us, most of us aren't pretty and it takes a lot of effort to sometimes just be what we see as average and forgive yourself for not changing the world in a highly visible way."

If she's saying that she's too fat and ugly - that is definitely NOT the problem.  It would be a problem if she thought that YOU were too fat and ugly.   They call it the 7-year itch for a reason.  She doesn't want to have sex with you for whatever reason and it isn't your fault.   She's saying that she's a bad wife because she is actively being a bad wife and knows that she's doing it and continues to do it.    Counseling?  That's not going to do anything.   You're not having communications problems.  Prepare yourself for the worst because when she won't sleep with you anymore, technically - you're just ""friends"" that happen to have kids together.    She'll want sex again and if she doesn't want it with you, she will have it with someone else.   You can do everything right in a marriage and still have it fall apart.    Don't do something stupid because she's gone all wacky."
relationship_advice,3dwhlw,amenamen501,-12,Tue Jul 21 03:26:19 2015 UTC,"Women are more likely than men to be religious, and almost all radical feminists are women. Women are very likely to hold beliefs which are inconsistent with reality.   In this case, your wife possesses the belief that she's too ugly for sex, which, as evidenced by your desire to have sex with her, is only a delusion.  To dispel her delusion, simply point out the obvious: ""If you're too ugly for sex, why do I want to have sex with you? If you were ugly, wouldn't I have no desire?""  It's also possible that your wife is simply dishonest. (Women are just as dishonest as they are delusional.) It's possible that she believes she more than sufficiently attractive for sex and that you yourself are so repulsive that she had no desire to let you fuck her."

What the kindest way to tell a man you don't want to have sex with him anymore?  I love you I'm just not IN LOVE with you.   Have and open marriage.  Divorce only leads to her shacking up with gutter trash who molest your kids.  Marriage is a business the product being children for the war and profits machines.  Second marriages lead to divorce at a higher rate.  So you let her do her thing, you do your thing, and when you both die your kids will get your stuff instead of whoever in line had sex with you both last."

I was getting concerned comments from friends when I was dating someone in their early twenties when I was seventeen, but thirty-five?   I too, am from Canada, but that doesn't make it any less creepy. It's very, very, very rare that a seventeen year old isn't in some way being taken advantage of when their partner is over a decade their senior.   I would say something. It might boil down to your friend not being able to appeal to women closer to his age, and he just needs someone to talk to about it."

""What do you think about [insert_name_here]'s concerns about your girlfriend?"" How they respond to said friend is a good way to test the waters.   I'm assuming he has an ex of some sort if he's already got a daughter. That's another good not-too-obvious way to start the topic. ""So, has [ex] meet [current_GF] yet? They getting along?""   If I could flip a switch in my head and be fine with this, I would for sake of peace and ease.   That's tough. I'm still a teen-aged girl, and the men who are ~7+ years older than me, but approach me anyways (with romantic or sexual intents) are usually not the best people. Typically, very predatory, almost abusive, or just incredibly depressed. Now, I don't know your friend, and I'm not accusing them of being a messed up person, but I understand why it's so hard to be okay with this.

How old is too old for him? Because she will always be about 20 years his junior. And if in x years, when he is 35+x, he wants to date another 17 year old, that will be even creepier than it is now.   A good standby is the xkcd comic that explains creepiness of dating too young: your age / 2 + 7. So, for him 35/2 +7 = 19.5 + 7 = 26.5 is the minimum age he should be dating for it not to be creepy. This goes up by half a year for every year your age increases. So, it would still be creepy for him to be dating this girl until 19 years from now, when he's 54 and she's 36. Inversely, at 17, the oldest for you to be dating to avoid creepiness is 20."

relationship_advice,3dy7wr,hecknotechno1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:01:20 2015 UTC,"This definitely sounds like something my boyfriend would say about me, specifically the feelings building up to anger. I get that way when I try explain how I feel but I'm not getting the sense that he's understanding me the way I want him to. I always try to tell him more bluntly how I feel, so maybe if you don't mind her doing that, ask her to be completely honest and not to sugarcoat anything. As for the sexual appetite, I do try to not think about myself when we are intimate, as I don't have a strong sex drive. Tbh I would just tell her exactly how you feel and suggest something that you'd like to do with her."
relationship_advice,3dy7wr,kaelpepper,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:57:53 2015 UTC,"Whomp, whomp, this is a major red flag. You're not a selfish asshole, this is important. One of the most important aspects of a relationship is being able to open up and communicate with each other about anything and everything, including the scary stuff.   She's only 19, but that's still no excuse to act like such a petulant child. The way you work out problems in a relationship is talk them out. If she can't even do that, be ready to break up, because that is a failure to even aknowlege there is a problem. Respect yourself and understand that she's replaceable, and you can find someone who will treat you good and talk to you. If she won't, find someone who will."

relationship_advice,3e0ogn,somnodoc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:47:46 2015 UTC,"She claimed to be divorced on the singles sites. The sites only held history for 60 days and thats as far back as the winks and messages went.   I did talk to her about it. She said she felt as if I had been neglecting her. I could see that as I travel 2 to 3 days a week for work. But I always call her 3 times a day at least to see how she is doing. But I put forth more effort to let her know I love her and show her more physical affection. We have been apart for 2 weeks and she is already browsing for ""friends"""
relationship_advice,3e0ogn,somnodoc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:11:05 2015 UTC,"I'd say this is a deeper issue that 2 weeks. You need to go see your wife, get your MIL to watch the kids and take her out for an intimate dinner. Afterwards, take her for a walk and have a heart to heart where she can tell you what she feels is actually missing and how she feels it can be fixed. Remember, this is compromise, but you need a jumping off point and what she feels is missing is a good place."

Call 911 to respond to the suicide threat, and when he gets out of hospitalization, when he asks for advice gently remind him that the proper source of advice for him right now is a qualified psychotherapist. He has deeper issues than you can fix."

He used to go go therapy and he was on medication, but after he turned 18 he quit therapy and took himself off his medication.  His older sister is saying he needs to be admitted somewhere since he is threatening suicide and everyone is saying he needs therapy. I suggested it to him, saying it may help him. He got very defensive and said, ""I'm not going to no damn therapy.""   So with that idk. However, I agree about calling 911 to respond to the suicide threat."

You two have some serious communication issues that need to be addressed.  You should only get married when you are certain, right down to your toes, that this is the person you want next to you for the rest of your life."
relationship_advice,3e13a5,Lordica,2,Tue Jul 21 03:42:08 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to see a, to me-disturbing trend on this subreddit of guys freaking the hell out at the first sight of a partner who yelled at them, or kind of freaked out on them.  I know, we are all supposed to have civil conversations but shit happens. And, yes, there are exceptions--I just responded to a guy whose crazy girlfriend wants him to attend a party with her baby -daddy and she wasn't even invited.   Anyway, set aside wacko situations and consider the big picture...this is the first time this has happened (yeah 2x lately) but the first instance in 2.5 years...You really think she has been 'pretending' to be a sane person until now?   Look, here's the skinny...We women are seeping hormones left and right...some of us respond better than others--we all seep them at different times, rates and we all have different coping skills.   Sometimes the hormone monster is creeping when we are in the midst of these things...In your case, you are getting married--that is crazy making time--I've been there. I seriously almost had a nervous break-down-lots to do and so many considerations-plus there's normal life to deal with too.   Give her a darn break and give yourself one too. Sounds like you are getting a bit of cold-feet-totally normal. I really do think you are blowing this out of proportion."
relationship_advice,3e13a5,1fuathyro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:55:23 2015 UTC,"You may be right about giving her a break and giving myself a break for sure. Thank you for your comment . But I just want to clarify that this isn't about the fights so much as it is my determination to have a peaceful happy life. And the thing is as much as I want to have a family I have so much more I know I can have in my life to fill it, but I don't feel like I have to be married to be happy which is my dilemma. I'm not saying at all I don't want to get married or I disagree with marriage it's just that it's not essential to my survival or happiness and I wonder if I would be more happy not being married if being married means having these confusing illogical blow up type fights. I mean there's no end game to the fights they serve no purpose but the cause  multiple hours of agony. Nothing was achieved by them. I'm a very even-tempered soft-spoken calm kind of person I don't go looking for conflict I don't like conflict and yes arguments happen completely understand and I'm okay with that but I believe you treat everyone as you want to be treated and when she is in a bad mood even if it's not about me I also feel that wrath. I don't really think that's fair and maybe did hormones are to blame but I don't know how I feel about that being a reason that I should just put up with that kind of stuff. I hope I don't sound harsh like I said I do love her, and I'm probably even being selfish but i just I'm scared that I will not be happy.  I know some people might say WAH WAH get over it that's marriage. But I have trouble accepting that I'm out I'm an analyst by nature I rely on logic and to logically choose to be in situations that make you unhappy realtor it makes no sense it makes my head hurt. Even for the love of somebody else should you give up your own happiness? Even only temporarily? I tend to think it depends on what are the good outweighs the bad. But for me the bad put a giant knot in my stomach and the good seems to maintain a calm happy that I feel like I already have  I guess I think I'll be happy with or without a relationship, maybe it's just me that needs counseling.  PS - I'm not trying to shoot down your comment at all I really appreciate the feedback, I'm just trying to relay my inner turmoil or turmoils"
relationship_advice,3e13a5,1fuathyro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:41:00 2015 UTC,"Look, you are right-no marriage, no fights. Oh and while you are at it. No swimming in the ocean, no possible shark bites. Oh and no job, no possible issues with co-workers, clients, or jerk bosses. And you might as well stop driving because, you know, you could get into an accident.  Life is rife with pitfalls...THAT'S life. Even the most seemingly sheltered people deal with strife.   If you don't want to get married, then don't but going on about your life being more 'peaceful' without it is ridiculous, at best.   You seriously need to see a therapist because I suspect you have anxiety and it's not just about marriage."
relationship_advice,3dxp79,cteavin,27,Mon Jul 20 11:51:57 2015 UTC,"I can't really be of much help with the forgiveness aspect. I can only treat your situation as if it's my own and speak in that manner. Why would you have to forgive? First I don't see how it's her fault. She came to the company for work. They gave her the position. Should she of said no? No, right? Forgiving your company is an entirely other matter. And why forgive? They apparently back stabbed you. Just remember you're there for a pay check. Clearly you can't move up based on length of experience. So collect your pay checks and if you want advancement, I assume you're in good standing, look for another job and use them as a reference once you find another. You don't have to go around forgiving everyone in life. The demotion I assume means a drop in salary. That's money out of your pocket and less food on the table. Forgive those who deserve it and don't blame people who don't deserve it. But forgiving those who F'd you over doesn't matter. Use that as an engine to motivate you to either seek a better job or to treat work there as work and just get paid each week.  At least that's how I see it. Good luck to you."
relationship_advice,3dxp79,Jobcv314,-2,Mon Jul 20 12:15:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response and different pov. Actually, I do blame her for accepting. She'd actually been lobbying for the position behind my back. As for pay, there's no drop in salary except the extra overtime. Not having it isn't an issue for me. That resentment I feel is.   Cheers,"
relationship_advice,3dxp79,tossy_mctosserson,15,Mon Jul 20 14:41:53 2015 UTC,"This now makes no sense, so there's either something you are leaving out or that you do not know.   It would by far be in their best interest to tell you the overtime stops or they'll have to find someone who can do the work in the allotted time.   My take is that you're slow, and that you've already had that conversation with management, so they've proceeded to plan B.   Be prepared to be let go entirely soon, FYI."
relationship_advice,3dxp79,Jobcv314,4,Mon Jul 20 15:50:02 2015 UTC,"The only missing piece is that this is Japan and we're both Americans in an American company here. I've been here since university, so I'm more or less Japanese in attitude and thought, and she's fresh off the boat. I expected we were in what's called a senpai/kohei relationship (think mentorship) and she saw it her being my replacement.    When I was on holiday for two weeks, she made a big deal of how irresponsible it is (in Japan). The amount of overtime is the same, whoever does the job, so she made a cost analysis sheet while I was away and lobbied for the position. The Japanese half of the management conceded because, after all, we do work for an American company."
relationship_advice,3dxp79,Jobcv314,5,Mon Jul 20 21:45:06 2015 UTC,"Many many years ago when I was a kid, a relative of mine worked at a very well known and large company. Growing up he seemed to do pretty well. Fancy car, huge house. Years later he was traveling every other year for training. He had a degree in electrical and mechanical engineering an was a pretty smart guy. I came to realize once he got past age 50 his company was hiring 20 + year old fresh graduates and the new trend became to make work harder for those who've been there the longest. They basically wanted turn over. They could replace my relative and pay the new person 1/3 less. Do that with a lot of people and they're saving money. The person in your story is a class-A jerk no doubt. And it'll happen to her one day. I wouldn't become best friends with her, but holding a grudge will only make going to work that much worse. If you see her screwing up, you can always point it out. Although it may just look as if you're trying to get her back. If it was me I'd work on getting out of there. Work sucks, but who wants to goto a job where you know people above you didn't appreciate the years you put in and back stabbed you. You just need to make sure where ever you go, you're careful. Hiring you at age 40 may be difficult, but if you're going to get settled into a new job one day might as well look now. It's hardly to find a good paying job at age 50. I'd suggest leave or stay, but whatever decision you make do so in the next year. Good luck to you bro, you have my empathy."
relationship_advice,3dxp79,dandar4600,3,Mon Jul 20 15:21:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the story and support.   I'm still looking for that 'how' in how to forgive. I'm not inclined to be outwardly bitchy, so I wouldn't -- and haven't -- pointed out her mistakes or made a fuss. Inwardly, however. . ."
relationship_advice,3dxp79,Claclink,3,Tue Jul 21 09:02:05 2015 UTC,"You're welcome. I hope everything works out for you. If it's any consolation, your years working overseas may make you stand out quite a bit back in the States. Although using my relatives story as an example, the backstabbing happens here too. And a lot of States are Employee At Will, so it's probably easier to be fired. Being so knowledgable about the both cultures and I'm sure you picked up some of the language there, you're probably an attractive candidate for some companies in Japan. Maybe finding a new job at a new company wouldn't be so difficult. Just food for thought. I'd take it slowly though but if I were you, I'd every now an then keep an eye open for other options. Good luck bro. If you're ever in Philly we'll have a beer, I'm buying."
relationship_advice,3dxp79,Claclink,25,Tue Jul 21 09:22:56 2015 UTC,"Start looking for a new job. It's a dog eat dog world and she advanced at your cost. Not really her fault. You can't blame her for wanting more money and if you want to get technical it's the company that advanced her at your cost. Your beef is with your employer, not her."
relationship_advice,3dxp79,chrrie,0,Mon Jul 20 12:47:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, kinda. She lobbied for the position. Can I blame her? One thing I left out is that I'm in Japan. This kind of thing is just not done. It's a break in protocol, harmony, respect. It's an American company with deep Japanese roots. The core of this problem is that I'm Japanized (been here since university) and she's typically American. It will bite her in the ### one day."
relationship_advice,3dxp79,bathyscaaf,8,Mon Jul 20 15:00:52 2015 UTC,I think you are being selfish.  The company decided they wanted her in that position.  She wanted that position.  Why should you get the position exactly?  You earn the position by showing the company it is in their best interest to put you there.  Unless she is hooking up with the boss or something no one did anything wrong.
relationship_advice,3dxp79,RevisedThoughts,2,Mon Jul 20 18:48:02 2015 UTC,"Not getting the position? I had the position. Why should I keep it? Well, my performance is the top in the company.    The reason I had been training her, I was told, was so those extra bits of paperwork that require overtime could be done by her. I was to keep my position in sales and training. After all was said and done, they still expected me to continue with sales, just without my title.    But the point of this thread wasn't to throw blame. The point was to find out how to forgive. The most interesting thing I've gotten from reading comments is that's overlooked and the ""how"", well, not many seem to know how."
relationship_advice,3dxp79,kc1328,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:58:25 2015 UTC,"See I dont think she did anything wrong, and I think the majority of people agree with me.  So if she didn't do anything wrong, it is kind of hard to give advice on ""how"" to forgive her.  I think you should realize she has her own career to worry about.  If you performance is #1 in the company, there is something else you do that caused you to be demoted.  I don't know you, or know how you do your job, but from the little information I do know, you handled the situation very unprofessionally. You should never blow up publically in front of all your coworkers.  It doesn't prove your point, it doesn't help your career, and now you have a reputation as the crazy dude in the office.  If you have ever acted similarly to this in the past, I can almost guarantee this is why you were demoted.  If you have been nothing but a perfect employee before this one incident the only person you can be upset with is your boss.  If you are upset with your boss, you talk to them.  If the problem isn't fixed, you consider getting another job."
relationship_advice,3dxp79,mattdan79,2,Tue Jul 21 09:08:08 2015 UTC,"I didn't blow up. I realize that I worded the original post in a way that makes it sound like I did. My intention in that phrasing was to eliminate any suggestion of talking it out.    What I did do is tell both management and this person that I thought it was unfair and got HR involved.    The key point is money. It was said again and again and again. I earn about double what she does and the over-time was a drag on the company. That I understood. When I agreed to train her it was so that she could do all the busywork that comes with the position but as you said, she was looking out for number one and wanted more. She felt it was unfair that she would be getting second fiddle, so to speak.    The best solution would have been to divide the position into two so that I keep my title (important for the ol' resume) and she gets a title with responsibilities, but ""co-coordinator"" wasn't good enough for her resume. I did get HR involved and came to find out they are there to for the company, not the employee.   So I disagree with you. She was being selfish and didn't consider me. The manager thought I would concede and continue doing sales even without my title and continue on with training. Nope. Those two things are part of the responsibility of that position, so I cut my hours to pt and took another pt job with a different company which will offer me a ft position next year if I can prove my performance -- and I can."
relationship_advice,3dxp79,mattdan79,6,Tue Jul 21 10:03:58 2015 UTC,"I think this is the kind of attitude you need to try to change. You're placing a lot of blame of this poor girl who didn't do anything wrong except that she was willing to do your job faster and for less money. Being eager and pointing out opportunities to increase efficiency isn't going to ""bite her in the ###"", it will get her promoted throughout her career.  Not to mention it's the management at your company that is responsible for the move, not some nefarious coup that she expertly hatched while you were away on vacation. Someone who is consistently working overtime on something is a huge red flag that improvements need to be made which they addressed by bringing in help for you in the first place. If this girl then expressed that she could do it all herself it's a no-brainer for management to pursue that. It's not personal, it's business.   Anyway, just because something has always been done a certain way doesn't mean it was the right way. It's not about maintaing harmony and respecting tradition, it's about making the right business decision, which usually involves cutting costs."
relationship_advice,3dxp79,zeporscheguy,2,Mon Jul 20 19:08:49 2015 UTC,"The amount of overtime is the same, whoever does the job, so she made a cost analysis sheet while I was away and lobbied for the position.   So actually she only does this for less money, not because she is faster or does it better.  Because she is new and hasn't earned the raises OP accrued over time.  So as a reward for the OP's service and loyalty he gets demoted and now earns less because he has been at the company longer.  OP should be pissed, and his company has shown him how they value their employees -- work hard and long enough and we'll reward you with demotion."
relationship_advice,3dxp79,zeporscheguy,2,Tue Jul 21 00:25:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I agree with that assessment.    Still, I dislike that I've held onto the resentment this long. I have been proactive in getting a p-t job which will lead to a f-t position next year, but I don't want to be bitter."
relationship_advice,3dxp79,zorilla24,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:43:56 2015 UTC,"You made a lot of assumptions which were wrong. She was willing -- and has been -- taking that extra work home to do because she's not yet skilled. So in addition the overtime she's doing in the office she's finishing up at home. They're getting a gradually tiring employee who will slip up.    My success rate is one of the highest in the company: 80%. The data isn't fully in but she's batting way, way, way below what I can do. And to be clear, our management would still like me to share in those tasks, but I've politely declined so she can ""gain the experience"". This means they wanted the best of both worlds. Perhaps I'm an ass for saying no, but the cost paid for disrupting the harmony.  As for harmony, employee satisfaction is a clear benchmark of a good company. When a company plays favorites or makes financial decisions that disrupt that harmony they send a clear message which does affect employee retention, work performance, and loyalty.    It's unfortunate that you don't seem to recognize the reciprocal relationship between a place of work and the people who work there."
relationship_advice,3dxp79,wildeep_MacSound,5,Tue Jul 21 08:54:07 2015 UTC,"This ""forgiveness"" thing is hard to get your head around when you are hurting. You have to protect yourself from being hurt again, and bitterness can help you do that, by not trusting and following people who hurt you in the past, just because they act friendly now.   But when you feel safer, letting go can become easier. You can let go of anger and hurt which no longer serves you, but only brings you down. If you believe those people have not changed (and there is no sign you have given that they have tried to make amends) then forgiveness means letting go of the desire to change them, to make them see the unfairness or consequences of their actions, or even to get comeuppance.   You still need to protect yourself from their machinations, and so you do not need to trust or like these people, so you have to forgive them for being who they are: more selfish than fair, perhaps. Short-termist and prejudiced perhaps? Unable to trust you or be accountable for how they treat you perhaps?  And with whatever positive attributes they may have as well - surface courtesy, reliability in doing their job tasks, whatever.   This is the closest to forgiveness I can aim for in irreparable relationships, where I have tried communication, kindness and changing myself to no avail. Then you have to accept people are how they are, minimise the space they take up into head, and focus on something else which you can have a better effect on and which has a better effect on you. It is one stage in moving on. Letting go of trying to change the past, or get people to see things they do not want to see or to treat you in ways they do not want to treat you. Learn what you can from it and let go of the rest, including the hurt."

relationship_advice,3dxp79,1fuathyro,5,Tue Jul 21 09:02:56 2015 UTC,"I worked at a high tech company years ago, they hired a guy in a fairly low level support position but he had very esoteric skills but the company had to have him for their product, so they paid him more than double of  his peers.  That guy moved around, got promoted to some degree and had been at the company for 5 years (which was an eternity there) he was in line for promotion, the director asked managers who worked with him if he was good candidate, they said sure, good guy, solid. The director didnt promote him, he fired the guy, why ? because this guy was paid too much and should be a Rockstar by now. So in the 5 years he was there his being paid so well haunted him the whole time, he never got a raise and got fired in the end. I think its ridiculous but it was business in their eyes, I ended up getting the job, it was not my fault in anyway it was the managers decision.  Oh and I learned allot from the guy who was fired, he was a great guy and the manger was the biggest douche I ever met. And the irony is that we all left and found jobs that paid double, that company was cheap despite year over year record breaking profits.   I suggest you look for a job that challenges you and may very well pay you more than if you had been promoted. And dont resent the person doing your job, its not her fault. Moving on and succeeding will ease the burn of this."

When I found peace a job popped out of nowhere.   This happened 3 years ago and although I'm not 100% over it I don't even think about it all to often (might pop into my head once a month).   Sorry to hear what happened it sucks but keep looking for new ways on letting it go. It must be awful going into work and being reminded of this every day. A change of scenery might be the way to go.  Can you move your career forward a different way?

It's like if you got ditched for something newer and have to be reminded of it daily, rubbed in your face.  I'd honestly distance yourself from the company by looking for something better. That would turn the initial situation into a positive motivator and get you out of there.   If you have no other options you'll unfortubately have to stay strong or try therapy to process it until it doesn't bother you as much.

There's only so much that condoms and regular screenings can account for, as herpes and HPV can be spread even with vigilant prophylactic measures. Since these are health concerns for anyone with whom you have sexual contact, there's an ethical imperative to clear communication.   If you're hooking up with the girl under pretenses of exclusivity then it's an even better idea to let them know you're seeing other folks.   Otherwise, no, you're not a shit person, this is all typical and natural behavior for your age and situation, just communicate clearly and be fully informed about proper protection. Your health and your partners' health depends on it. Remember oral sex can spread STI's and alcohol can lead to shitty communication and unsafe sex."

You have to learn to be good at it, but it's probably not your kink if it doesn't immediately turn you on.  Read the book ""Women Who Love Too Much."" You didn't grow up being treated as a girl, so you didn't get the warnings girls get about these relationships with someone who refuses to be faithful to you or to even give you their love, and you're so addicted to them that you don't even recognize that you have needs when you're in the relationship.

relationship_advice,3dyqws,xxthrowout,2,Tue Jul 21 01:55:56 2015 UTC,"(21F here) I've only been with one guy, and he outright suggested that I shave my region. I was of course embarrassed- the first guy I had been naked with telling me to shave, but I was glad he told me it bothered him. Your girlfriend was just being a jerk. If it was bothering her that much, she should have told you, and if it wasn't a big deal she should've just let it be (which it seems like she did). I think she was just trying to find any way to insult you that she could.  That said, you shouldn't feel like you have to change for your partner. It's whatever your comfortable with. For example, I had kind of always wanted to shave but I was taught growing up not to, so when my SO wanted me to I was happy to oblige since I secretly wanted to. It's all about compromise.  If it makes you feel more confident to trim it, then do that. Think if you were the girl, would you want to go down there in it's current state? Some girls dig it, some don't, so do what you want, and if it's an issue, she (should) woman up and communicate about it. This shouldn't make or break a relationship, it's just hair. If it does, I would question the foundation of your relationship.   Best of Luck!"

She struggled to insult my characteristics or personality so unfortunately targeted physical features instead:/   I've always found it really sexy when a girl makes an effort and shaves for you, it makes the guy feel quite special and doesn't go unnoticed!

Every woman has a prefernce, ask the ones you are with and cater to them.   If no, shit man get a shower! :)   High level grooming never hurts!  You know that bush in the yard that grows constantly in the summer? You have to trim it just to keep things looking nice, but you don't cut it out at the root right?   Same thing in your personal zones. It's never bad to do a high level clipping and keep the area shaped and orderly. No blades have to reach the skin to do this.  Consider the Mouth...  If you like receiving oral, consider that the people giving it probably don't want a mouth full of hair. Putting a razor to the shaft and balls will make that a far better experience for anyone going down on you. It's not mandatory, but hey it shows that you are a guy who cares...  That girls a snot, ignore her.  At your ages she's feeling the need to valildate herself and her decisions by bringing you down. She's the playground bully, with tits. Just ignore her and laugh when people spread rumors. At most say ""She never complained to me!"" and that's it.  I go with the focus on the mouth. Every morning in the shower I put a simple blade to the shaft and sack and carefully groom. It keeps my bits smooth for the ladies and that's that. I trim down the rest (a two inch pubic hair just... no) and call it good.  Same for my armpits. Nobody wants to be able to braid them. I keep them cut but not shaven. Welcome to the new masculinity. Use a nice, scentless, alcohol free lotion when you are done and dry. Keep that skin tender :P"

And oh god, she was one of those stereotypical 'bitchy' girls who wore a bit too much make-up and quite liked making a scene and so on, I don't think she meant it, she never ever brought it up when we were together, but it gets in your head man!  Cheers bro, peace out!-^"

I dont know what you STD is, but im assuming it isn't as serious as HIV based on your tone, but you have proof in the text message that he knew about the STD for a long time and did nothing about it.  As for your divorce, im not sure how that works either or if it is worth the effort.  i think you should talk to a lawyer, most lawyers do free consultations and they can tell you what your options are."

We just don't really care enough to plan it and pay for it and whatnot. What is concerning is that you seem afraid to talk to him about it. Maybe you'd feel good if you guys had a long engagement? Get engaged now but don't actually get married until after school? Or maybe he thinks you want a big wedding and wants to wait until you can afford it. Either way, just talk to him about it."

relationship_advice,3dy5ti,Lazy_IT_guy,2,Mon Jul 20 19:55:00 2015 UTC,"A relationship is compromise. After 8 years with the love of my life, I would never imagine thinking about ending it just because our relationship is written on paper (marriage). Yes, I want to get married, he wants to but just isn't in a hurry, we're taking care of other things before we start having to file taxes together. Honestly, if you guys haven't even lived together at this point, do that for a couple years before considering marriage. Living with someone is a different ball game, and the first year, you'll probably fight more than you have the past 6 years. After that, then you should consider marriage and have open communications about your wants/desires and find out why he's not in a hurry to walk down the isle."

I think that's a fair point from his perspective. How soon do you want to get married? You mentioned your friends getting engaged, but half will probably result in divorce within 5 years.   Frankly I don't see what will change much besides a ring on your fingers. Sure, waiting until after college makes sense so you don't have to plan and can save money but you said going to the courthouse is fine too. You may want to say you can't wait another x years.   How much money, what year, where you live - it doesn't really matter. If it's for better or for worse, well, I don't think you're in the ""worse"" category one bit, if you got married in a year or two."

My best friend has a 10/10 personality, but only 6/10 attractiveness.    Giving her ""out of ten"" ratings only compounds that problem.   Should I try to date her?   No. If you aren't attracted to her enough to be sure you want to now, when she's 23, you aren't going to be attracted to her enough later. You really seem to put appearance first (""even my friends agree that everyone I have dated in the past has been much better looking""), and it doesn't sound like that's going to change.   At best, you're likely to have a relationship that makes neither of you happy, and causes a lot of heartache. More likely, she isn't interested and your friendship will be strained because of it."

What will you do if you get married in the future and your wife is now 60 and has wrinkles and grey hair? Is she no longer attractive and it's time to move on to get yourself the next young, hot thing?? What happens if you marry and your poor wife endures having her friggin vagina split open birthing your children, and you no longer find her attractive because she's got cellulite and stretch marks? Is it time for you to move on then? And why are you even comparing her to your previous relationships? What is the point? Is it to justify to yourself, ""Oh, well I've only ever dated 8-10s in the past, I can't possibly be settling for a 6."" Tbh, maybe you guys are wonderful friends, but I wouldn't subject her to being in a relationship with someone who doesn't see her as an amazingly beautiful person.

relationship_advice,3dysxw,Newtealsharpie,5,Mon Jul 20 17:28:02 2015 UTC,"I agree with the above statement. I think the reason that  cheating has such a stigma around it is because it is something hard (if not impossible) to come back from. It's a breach of trust, for sure. But also, it will hang over you for the duration of your relationship. You will always wonder ""what if"". Additionally, he is essentially blaming his friends for HIS mistake, by withdrawing from them since the incident. He hasn't fully acknowledged that it was a decision HE made. And on top of that, he is saying he still lacks self control if he thinks that the only way he can avoid cheating again is by cutting ties with his friends."

Really?) it sounds like he told you more to alleviate his own guilt more than anything else. I personally don't feel it was that courageous and if I were you I would end the relationship. You're too young to settle for this nonsense.  But, if you do decide that you have to stay with this guy because he's just that special, there's no real rules about how to go about it. I've had a partner that engaged in some low-level infidelity that I didn't feel was a relationship-ender but I was still super pissed about. He let me blow up at him when I was angry. A few (6 maybe) months on, I was mostly over it. We split up for unrelated reasons about a year after that."

Personally im not friends with any of my ex fwbs or exes in general. Firstly im of the opinion that being friends with someone ive slept with would be hugely disrespectful to my current relationship. Secondly and i cant stress this enough all of my exes either turned out to be shitty people or i never liked them as people to begin with.   This might make me come off as an asshole but i tend to compartmentalize my relationships. Romantic and platonic. For example i have ""friends"" i will gladly have a chat with on fb but id never actually go out for drinks with them or whatever. So for me fwb type relationships i had tended to be with people i had no interest in. Platonically or romantically.   The only issue i see with you keeping contact or staying friends with this guy is that some potential boyfriend might take that as a huge red flag. If i were dating someone and they told me they are still friends with an ex fuck buddy and the only reason they werent together was because he didnt want a relationship well id be noping the fuck out of there."

It is weird for me because for many of my friends (of all genders) I am very good at having them open up to me and also being able to know what to say to cheer them up or put a smile on their face.  We do have fun together when we see each other, but if she's tired or sad I don't have that touch or words to make things better for her on a reliable basis, when there is no one else I'd rather do that for.

What she did was a serious breach of trust (hence why you are afraid to be backstabbed). You don't trust her by your own words (and rightfully so) break up it's not worth it.
relationship_advice,3dxzc2,mattdan79,8,Mon Jul 20 14:23:13 2015 UTC,Break up with her.
relationship_advice,3dxzc2,Embarrassinghuman,4,Mon Jul 20 13:53:10 2015 UTC,If she will cheat with you she will cheat on you.
relationship_advice,3dxzc2,your_what_hurts,2,Mon Jul 20 15:43:49 2015 UTC,"she deserves more than that   Cheaters deserve more than what now?  At this point, she deserves nothing. One could say she's earned a nice break up.  For one month straight she played the two of you like fiddles. She is too weak-willed to make up her mind, and that is a personality trait that will only go away with maturation. She lied while cheating, and for two months she hid that lie (which is essentially lying through omission).   But also I'm concerned about being back-stabbed and being left with a big wound.   Hint: You've already been backstabbed. It's up to you to decide to risk it again."
relationship_advice,3dxzc2,TheGhostofWoodyAllen,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:04:19 2015 UTC,"I'm with 100%. Everything you said makes perfect sense. But breaking up with her is too easy. Generally speaking, it's a quitter's choice. However, in this case, I think it's more of the smart gambler's choice. I'm looking for something beneath the surface. Something that will give me a reason to think she has changed. *edit: as ridiculous and pathetic that sounds, I could have broke with her a long time ago. But again, I'm trying to reach out to see if there's any way I can gamble on this one, smartly."
relationship_advice,3dxzc2,TheGhostofWoodyAllen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:18:00 2015 UTC,"Not to sound cliched, but you sound like you're placing her on a pedestal. People are not what they say but what they do. She told you about the cheating three months ago, yet here you find yourself today asking anonymous strangers for advice.  Are you someone who deserves to be cheated on? If yes, then forward ho. If no, then you have to realize you've already been cheated on once. How many times do you need to be undeservedly cheated on before it's too many times?  Is she going to cheat again? It's been 5 months since cheating incident one. How do things look now? As I mentioned before, you've been in this state for three months, yet here you are asking about it. Have there been warning signs? Are you just tired of psyching yourself out about it?  Do you trust her? If you do, that's on you. Again, a person is what they do. If you feel her actions show real remorse (which her explanation of cheating, according to you, seems to be lacking in; all those details about not being attracted physically but still fucking him? What's that about?), then by all means, trust her. If you feel she's earned it and built it up to a place where you trust her enough to keep moving forward with the relationship, go ahead. Couples really can overcome cheating and be stronger and better for it. Other times (maybe more often) it doesn't work out at all and simply prolongs the inevitable.  Also, don't forget the Concorde Fallacy. It's not ""a quitter's choice"" to quit while you're ahead. Just because you've poured 6 months of time and effort into this woman doesn't mean it's worth it to continue pouring time and effort into it, especially if you're going to end up with nothing to show for it whether you quit now or later.  This is on you to weigh and decide. We only know what you've told us, and you can see how the hivemind sees it. But only you see what you see. Is this making you happy? Will this be a longterm relationship? Is it built on mutual trust and respect? Can you move forward with her?  Good luck."

Um, so if he comes around again, she's, what, not going to be able to tell him that she doesn't want to sleep with him?   If she has done it before, what makes tells me she won't do it again? Not to say she is gonna or not gonna. But is it even worth a shot?    This is something only you can answer. Personally, I would have a problem with someone being so callous as to completely disregard me during the first month of the relationship. Either she has a problem with empathy or she didn't really view me as serious partner.  You don't have to act in any way you don't feel like.  She cheated on you and didn't come clean immediately. Both of these speak to her character. I'd find out if she's cheated before, that is, is this a pattern or was this the first time?   IF you think you can get pas this, then she needs to be totally transparent - access to emails/texts/etc. If she won't do that, then next her."

relationship_advice,3e0aje,oling27,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:34:22 2015 UTC,"Get yourself some bomb ass lingerie. It will help uplift you and might help with getting him in the mood.  Try incorporating new and exciting things in your sex life? Get a kama sutra book? Try food play? Blindfolds? I think part of it also starts with you. If you try to see yourself in a more positive light, your newfound confidence will probably be incredibly sexy to him. Self-care helps some people with confidence. Zone in on the parts of you that you love. Turn the parts of you that you aren't so pleased with into a goal you can work on, don't just sit on thinking negatively and passively about those things. If you don't like your hair, get a haircut or dye it some fun color you've always wanted to try. Experiment with makeup. Displeased with your weight? Try a variety of fitness activities. 20 minutes of yoga one day, a half hr jog another day, etc. Get some new clothes that make you feel beautiful! Read that book you've always been meaning to. Start that hobby you never had time for. You'd be surprised how effective tuning in and reflecting on what exactly you don't like can be. Refreshing myself and giving extra attention to self care (or both the mind and body) helped me so much during my depression. These seem like such simple, everyday things to do, but I needed a nudge to pay more attention to self care then, and maybe so do you!"

First, make it a rule to take what people say at face value.  ""What do you think about my new hair style?"" just means ""What do you think about my new hair style?""  Commit to a lifestyle.

In fact, he seems so comfortable acting this way with you, it is likely that he is growing into it. I assure you when guys or girls bullshit with each other as friends, it does not look like this situation. He's not negative or nitpicky and the things he says are not jokes. He is simply an emotionally abusive and manipulative guy. The fact that he can be supporting and loving and hard working does not cut it. There are plenty of guys out there who are supporting and loving and hard working without all the emotional manipulation bs.

When I asked him the first time we had a discussion about the sexual intimacy he requires and I was struggling to fulfill that. It led to a very awkward time for both of us especially since we were having sex constantly and I still wasn't able to get him off. I don't think it's unreasonable for him to hesitate until he's sure that he's compatible with me in that realm since he's a very sexual person.  I'm not really sure how to ask without making it awkward. I'm trying not to seem needy, but I know by asking I am. He's a go-with-the-flow kind of guy when it comes to relationships, I'm a bit more formal about asking questions.  He's really great overall. We vibe well, we have similar taste in humor, we enjoy each other's company. He's told me that he likes me a lot etc etc.  shrug I just don't want to mess it up by asking, but by not asking it's nibbling at me a bit. How do I ask him in a very casual or playful way?

It's that lack of distinction that bothers me. I think we've passed the ""just dating"" portion since we're bangin', right?  I guess you're right though.

(played whit Sulfuric acid i believe her, she has a part time job at a place that works whit stuff like that.)   My question to you now is...  Should i proceed to invite her out.  Or should i lay low for some time, wailing on her to contact me?   (and no. I have no idea about what I'm doing. I have only been in one other relationship, that has ruined the knowledge on how to interact with the opposite gender.)"

Great guy, we'd been dating for four years up until a couple of days ago. We started dating when I was 19, I'm now almost 23. I just...I don't know. I can't commit. That sounds silly, seeing as we're four years in, but I don't feel comfortable not having had some time in my 20's to focus on developing myself as a person. I really, really love this guy. He's been my best friend since we met. We do everything together.   We're currently broken up right now, I'm living with him for the next month. It's really hard. We've caved a few times by cuddling and still acting like a couple, which is totally expected and understandable, but you really need to set hard boundaries if you want the breakup to stick. It's not going to be easy, especially if you are broken up but still living together. You're going to have to stand your ground.   To me, it's really important to learn to be self-sufficient and independent. I need to know that I can do it, and knowing you can do it by doing it NOW will make you much more confident later in life.   I have no savings, no car, and I have a dog. (I love my dog, but be grateful you don't have a pup, it makes it a lot harder finding somewhere to stay) By mid-August, I have to find my own apartment, buy a car, and move all of my things out of our house, and start my own life.  The apartment and car are financial situations, which is different for everyone (but not easy by any means), but to me the hardest part is picking apart the pieces of our intertwined lives and making them separate again. It's like trying to separate the chocolate from the milk...you're going to start rooting through everything you guys built together, deciding who gets what, and it's going to be hard. Really, really hard. You're going to look through pictures and things you bought together, and doubt yourself and wonder if you made the right choice, and can't we just work it out?  No. That's your mind telling you to take the easy route, telling you to hit the snooze button on living your life. There's no good being done by living with him and staying with him out of convenience. It's not fair to you, and it's not fair to him to mislead him into thinking that it's working.  Do whatever you have to do. Take the bus to work. Pick up a weekend job. Pay your friends to stay on their couch for a week or two, or stay with family if you can. It might be pretty uncomfortable for a while, and you're going to have to call in all the favors you've got, but you'll be proud of yourself. Think of the end goal: standing in your new apartment, with your own car in the driveway, and nobody to hold you back.  You need to have a firm, sit-down conversation with him. Tell him that you're moving out, and that your decision is final on that. Have a plan for how long you're going to stay there, when you're going to get your own place, and don't back down.  The important thing is to be 100% confident that this is the right choice for you, which it sounds like it is.   I'm just as scared as you are. PM me, and feel free to talk anytime."

But doing so can be incredibly enriching and fulfilling.  Being able to travel for work (or school) is a pretty neat way to travel on a budget, while furthering your career.    You can still move in together and build a future, a 6-8 week trip will in no way impede that.  Don't try and prevent her from going, I can guarantee you that it will cause resentments down the road.    I've traveled a fair bit since my boyfriend and I started dating.  I did 6 weeks in Asia, a couple weeks in europe, and several week long trips around the US.  I miss him while I'm gone, but he doesn't really have the time to travel now, and he is so supportive of me doing it on my own."

Don't start talking to other girls to 'test the water'.  Don't do the slow fade and start ignoring her and acting distant and telling her 'nothing' when she senses something is wrong.  Be an adult and be a decent human being.  Tell her you are not sure you want to continue this relationship.  It's ok to feel this way and it's ok to want to end something.

relationship_advice,3dzmuo,cubanmasterchef7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:42:21 2015 UTC,"Don't get down on yourself - over four years is a long time.  Think about what kind of miserable, shallow individual would say such an awful comment (the dad thing) and then realize how absolutely useless her opinion is.  Next, the ex - yikes, she sounds pretty selfish too.  Good thing you moved on.  It would probably be very helpful to build out a support system that does not include your ex.  Also, have you updated your clothing?  Kept in shape? etc.  These may be areas to start.  Your self confidence needs a boost.  People that cheat and or say stupid comments have low self esteem and put down others to try and make themselves feel better.  Recognize that you are better than that and have a lot more to offer - that's a start.  List your positive qualities and keep those in your head - quiet the negative thoughts.  Have friends set you up or flirt with a co-worker.  Start small until you get to feeling better.  For now, focus on yourself, your friends, your family, your job, new hobbies and you will begin to feel a lot better.  Leave the ex alone.  You will meet someone in time, but you want to ensure you are attracting the right someone.  This can only be done when you feel good about you.  Make sense?"
relationship_advice,3dzmuo,Createdthisforyou123,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:55:12 2015 UTC,"Similar thing happened to me actually. It was a few years ago, I was 31 also. GF of 5 or so years broke up with me because she met someone else. I'm fairly certain she cheated on me, but rather than admit to cheating she just said she fell out of love.  I met a few people on okCupid, but I wasn't really feeling it. I wound up running into my ex at a bar when I was out with a friend and we talked. Things didn't work out for her and she essentially regretted what leaving me. We started hooking back up for a bit. But after a week of that, I just was feeling like I couldn't really get back to where I was. I didn't really trust her, and many of my friends pressured me, saying it was a mistake to get back together, so I put an end to it.  Decided to focus on me and do some things I never really did while I was in my relationship. Self improvement things, like learning to cook, and picked up some hobbies, both personal and social. I think this is key when it comes to dating honestly, because if you have a lot of things that are interesting about you, you have stuff to talk about and you come off as an interesting person when you start dating. It's not a race, so don't feel pressured to jump right back into the dating scene. Get your confidence back first and give yourself some time.  As far as online dating, I found my current gf of 3 years on okcupid. I'd say the service was successful and once I found my groove, I was meeting quite a few people. Advice I would give is, make sure you have some good clear photos on there. Photos that show you doing stuff and make it seem like you're a fun person, not bathroom selfies or any type of selfies for that matter. You've also got to have a good profile, open and honest to a fault seems to be the best approach, imho. It also helps to make changes every day, doesn't have to be major changes, but little updates, etc. Not only does this bump your profile up in visibility, but as people message you about talking points in your profile, you get an idea of what people find interesting and what might not be working for you.  Also, I wouldn't waste too much time messaging anyone. Online dating is pretty lopsided and I think a lot of women get spammed with messages. I'd message someone, never hear anything, and then two weeks later get a message from them where it was obvious they didn't realize I had previously messaged them. My message got buried somewhere. Not messaging cuts down on conversations that don't go anywhere. You never quite know where someone is in their online dating life, they might be just starting a budding relationship, but still talking to you on the off chance that it doesn't work out. I feel like someone who takes the initiative to contact you, is less likely to have already found someone they're interested in.  Don't give up, and be patient with it. I wasn't having much response when I first started. I deleted my profile and started over completely and right away was getting an lot of responses. It could be as simple as that. Also keep in mind that sites like okcupid do some rank structuring, where if you get a lot of negative response to your profile, it's shown less. You're are displayed to what they consider their ""less desirable"" profiles, which usually means incomplete ones, or barely active ones. This could happen because when you first opened your profile you didn't put any pictures on right away and so people clicked not interested and now your rank is so low, it's killing your visibility.  Whatever you do though, don't take your girlfriend back because you're having a hard time dating. That's the biggest cop out. Let her do what she's going to do. Worst thing that could happen is you get back with her for the weekend and find out she's pregnant. Close that chapter and move on."
relationship_advice,3dzmuo,krunchytacos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:34:03 2015 UTC,"So basically, what you're saying is you are depressed and jealous because your girlfriend is a whore and was able to continue whoring around after you broke up with her and got more action than you?  If you want to beat her at this game, you've got to be a bigger slut than her. Try going after college girls, many of whom have daddy issues and may be attracted to older men. It will especially helpful to target women who are under 21, since if you buy them alcohol they will often repay you with sexual favors. Also try targeting older women and housewives who are sexually neglected by their partners. The best place to meet these types of women are bridge clubs, yoga studios, and super markets.

Unfortunately, IMO, it boils down to this:  He thinks you cheated on him and have made up the rape story as ""cover"".  You think you were raped and did nothing wrong.  One of you is clearly right in your assessment and the other is clearly wrong.  We have no idea which is which, but either way, I don't see how this is salvageable unless the two of you agree on what happened.  If he's right and you cheated on him and are using the rape allegation as cover, then the relationship is over because he can't trust you to not cheat on him.  Especially when you've been drinking - which you have been unable to keep your word on stopping.  If you're right and you were raped, then the relationship is over because he's not going to support you in your one true moment of need.  And, even worse, he is going to make the experience even more traumatic for you by calling your rape cheating - even if he only says that in his own mind.  I just don't see how you get over that."
relationship_advice,3dz5hp,freebutnotfree,2,Mon Jul 20 18:38:45 2015 UTC,1) You can date without actively looking for a new relationship. It might help just to show you that he was not the end-all be-all of men.   2) I think being in contact with your ex is keeping you from healing. Maybe ask for a break from contact for awhile. If he really wants to be friends then he'll understand and give you space.

If you feel like because you want that you can just get it then go for it...  although, I'd say no one really needs to be with someone to get past negativity. There's always negativity.

I do have a pool, and have a pool guy so I don't have to really on other people when I go out of town. I once dated a guy with 2 cats, he wanted me to check on them while he went out of town. I think cats are pretty self sufficient, so checked on them twice which I truly thought was plenty. He wasn't too happy when he came home either. Honestly, I thought I did a good job, esp considering he knows I am allergic to cats. This is what pet sitters and pool people are for."

relationship_advice,3dv5dp,RevisedThoughts,-1,Mon Jul 20 04:41:22 2015 UTC,"Technically, no you are not a bad son for encouraging your mother to be taken care of by the state/federal government (that's what fund welfare and disability). I mean she probably paid into the system at one time (maybe-if she didn't work she didn't), and certainly your dad has, and you probably have/do as well.  But I do find these types of situations interesting from a sociology/anthropological standpoint. I think our modern society values independence and it contradicts with many of the (for lack of better words) more 'natural' ways in which we may have dealt with family members who were unable to take care of themselves either because of some disability, or some other reason, in our human history.  For example, there might have been a time when if your parent couldn't live alone for whatever reason, they came to live with 'the family'. I remember my grandmother living with us for a short while. In my case, she died young, but it had been a real joy having her around and having a wise being in our  house.   I know that your mom does not bring warm fuzzy feelings-mine didn't either, that's probably why I probably treasured my grandma being around so much, for the short time we had her but I do wonder if your sister seems fine with her if she can just tell  your mom ""Look, you can stay with me but we need a more sustainable environment--I'm going and if you want to come-you are welcome to.""  I just think, if you CAN help why not?  If you can't due to your feelings and stuff (I get that) that's okay but your sister seems not to have the resentment towards your mom that you do, and if she wants to help, why not?  Oh and just some insight for you, maybe...I dunno. I think your dad helped your mom out more than she deserved even because he realized something that you have not (and that's okay too-just an observation) that there was something 'not right' about her (my dad did the same thing sort of).   Anyway, I know it is not easy to see a parent in need of your help when they were never a 'real parent' to you and I can totally understand  your feelings on this."
relationship_advice,3dv5dp,1fuathyro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:55:10 2015 UTC,"It's more about the children. My mother is too irresponsible and stubborn to get income, and my sister doesn't want to see her lose the kids. My sister has talked to her about it non being something she can afford to sustain, trying to find solutions. Get a job? Mom won't get a job. Go on Welfare/disability? She won't do that either. Get rid of the horses? No. Move and sell the house? No. My sister gets told off and told to mind her own business whenever she tells mom that she needs to change something or she's going to lose everything.  It totally sucks to think that my little brothers and sister might end up in foster care because of this. I can help but I won't. If I start helping now, it will never end until the kids are all 18. I don't want to sign my life away paying for my moms continued mistakes and inaction over her own stubbornness, and neither does my father.  I'd probably let some of the kids live with me if it comes down to it, but my mom is also psychotic and won't let her kids visit me, because she thinks I'm going to molest them off of no basis."

relationship_advice,3dvw6r,DeepakThrowaway,13,Sun Jul 19 23:39:57 2015 UTC,"Well, don't tell people that identify strongly with a group you want to distance yourself from that you see yourself as having moved beyond the group and needing ""better, more adult"" friends. That may not be how you meant it, but that's clearly how they received it, so take that as feedback about how other people in this group are also likely to perceive this if you share your thoughts with them. Put yourself in their shoes: Would you like to hear from someone you enjoy spending time with that a group you love to hang with is just too immature for their grown-ass self? Especially if you don't really think of that person as more mature than you?  That being said, I've gone through this and almost everyone else in the world has done the same. Just start being busy more often when they invite you out, and don't extend invitations of your own in response. They'll get the picture that you're drifting away. Focus on other friends.   BUT, keep in mind that you don't really get to pick and choose friends to pluck out of an established group and keep close. If the group is close and you leave, you probably won't take the people you do like with you."

We have come and gone from each others lives as we see fit.  When I was in my early 20's I left the group for about 4 years.  Came back, and because they are my friends and love me, after giving me some shit, all was well. Others have done the same.  Whoever is the glue of your friend group, stay in contact with if you believe you will want to come back to them.  Everyone grows differently.  It's just a part of life."

I know it can suck, but I grew away from my childhood friends as well because we had less and less in common as the years went by.  This might sound to many Redditors really childish and I guess immature, but just stop texting and calling them. You don't need to have a ""talk"" or anything like that. From what I've read (since they haven't been inviting you to everything), they might feel the same as you do. Sometimes adults (not bashing them for doing what they love) grow apart. It happens. You like doing some things, and they like doing other things.  Just stop initiating contact with them. If they want you to hang out, they'll call or text you - and don't feel obligated to attend everything they ask. Be sure not to call or text them to initiate. Eventually, you and them are going to stop talking. No feelings are going to get hurt. Eventually, they'll be like, ""meh, he ain't responding/he's not l33t enough to game"" and the contact will drop off eventually.  Sounds like you already have another group of friends to fall back on, so no worries. This sort of thing happens to everyone."

relationship_advice,3dvw6r,Branfip81,2,Mon Jul 20 04:57:48 2015 UTC,"I think that your friend feels hurt. Growing older, it's really natural to grow apart from certain friends. Your life is short, you should not be spending time with people that do not make you as happy as you could be. However, it's kind of like you telling your friend, ""hey, I just don't want to hang out with you guys anymore"". He probably feels kind of hurt and like you're getting ""too good"" for them. You don't see it that way, and that's good, because to be honest, people drift apart, and that's okay!    I'm not saying that you should keep no friends from your youth. I have a best friend of about a decade now and I love her to smithereens. I text her daily although we live approximately 400 miles apart and this is because I genuinely enjoy her company and self so much. When you grow up, you really have to work hard to maintain those relationships you once had. When you were going to school with them very early on, it was really easy! You saw them every day and every single day produced chances to connect with them. However, when you went to college, I'm sure it got harder. You actually had to make time for them and to carve out when you were going to see them. Now, you're even busier with your job. (Congratulations by the way! Getting a good job right out of college isn't the easiest thing in the world these days.) Being busy with your job means you're really providing for yourself and growing in to a fine member of society. You get to decide who you want to be in your life. Don't allow your friend's tantrum deter you from said decisions.    Your time is valuable. If you don't want to spend it getting wasted, that is okay. You will find new friends, and the old ones that stay with you will only get better!"

This is only a problem because I'd be the only one there for her and I don't want it to be weird for her so I'd have to devote most of my time to her (That was a lot of hers lol). She's pretty shy so that doesn't help much either. After I introduce her to everyone, she will still most likely latch on my arm and chill with me the whole time, pulling me away from my friends.

Are you a supermodel looking guy? Pull yoursef back down to earth. She has plenty of free time to invest as she wishes, not as you wish her to. If she wants to spend that free time dieting and exercising, she will. If she doesn't want to, she doesn't have to. She doesn't maintain a certain look for you. She looks the way she does for herself, to make herself happy, not to please you. You are young and stupid. Chubby girls will not want to settle for you. Skinny girls will not want to settle for you. They will all find someone who isn't a misogynistic pos and will treat them well and appreciate them. You will probably find yourself with no one to ""settle"" with in the future. Have you ever considered maybe she gained those 18 lbs from being depressed and in a relationship with someone like you? If you expect her to lose weight for you, maybe you should go to therapy and fix your thinking for her. You probably won't end up marrying perod. You're a total tit man? Well great for you. Some of us women are just as shallow and vapid as you and are only into giant porn cock. Do you see how stupid this kind of thinking is?

Where was the discussion, the agreement? Its pretty normal to have sex with your partner, afterall thats the difference between a partner and a friend.  If she wont even discuss it, then thats a bigger red flag. Shes made the decision, now you shut up and do as she says. Is that fair? no. Is that a good sign for the future? fuck no"

relationship_advice,3dwm4a,J-Bru,-2,Mon Jul 20 05:22:01 2015 UTC,"Relationships are like rental cars. Temporary as is everything in life. Someone drove it before you and someone will drive it after you. That's why you should never get married. Alimony, child support, loss of assets. There's no reward for the family man. Women today are looking for the tall tat'd bad boys. Oh sure they'll take a time out from them with a safe bet sucker of a guy long enough for the kids to hit school full time and then it's off to divorce court for them to redistribute YOUR income and assets as they see fit, and then it's back to the bad boys.  Relationships fizzle. Why ? (from dictionary.com) FAMILIARITY BREEDS CONTEMPT The better we know people, the more likely we are to find fault with them. Long experience of someone or something can make one so aware of the faults as to be scornful. For example, Ten years at the same job and now he hates it familiarity breeds contempt . The idea is much older, but the first recorded use of this expression was in Chaucer's Tale of Melibee (c. 1386). So divorce happens.  Concentrate on your career or trade. I tell young men stay with your parents, growing up is overrated. Where do you think relationships go if they do last? Next minute her family is pressuring your for marriage. Then you got kids on the way. then you're stuck in some job you hate. It's game over dude. Don't think you're missing out on something. Don't cave into peer pressure. Talk to men in their 50's, broke, on third and 4th wives, child support back owed. Many are thrown into jail for non payment of child support."

Does she mind if you look at their texts?  Also unfriending on social media isnt really necessary- you must not ask her to do this directly atleast. If you have some insecurities- sit down with her and have a chat about your insecurities. Insecurities among men sometimes become cute and the girl might be able to see you as more trustworthy and eventually might not even find time for ex.  For now just relax and enjoy your relationship"

If she's been with you for so long, she clearly sees something in you. However, I think you two should sit down and have a serious talk around the question, ""Would you be okay giving up that side of you for the rest of your life?"" I know that seems like a huge question, but that's the reality. If you two keep dating, eventually, you will move on to marriage (unless of course, you two don't want to get married, and that's okay too! Whatever floats your boat!) However, if this is what it does lead to, will she be okay living like this for the rest of her life? Will she always feel unsatisfied?    It is okay if she does. It does, though, mean that you two have to either decide that you or her are okay with change, or that you should split up. It's a very difficult thing, I know. If you've been together for so long, clearly there's a lot of love, but in life, there's quite a lot more to the equation.     Edit: Best of luck to you both."

Go ahead and ask him; don't let it stew and become something bigger than it is. Express your interest in meeting them so you can learn more about what he likes to do outside of couples stuff. It'll give you a broader picture of him.  If he still won't let you meet them (that is, he never wants you to be part of that social circle), then there's an issue. But first, see if he's willing at all for you to meet them."

Something like ""Hey, I want to know more about you, but I don't want to intrude...could you set up something so I can meet your friends some time? We could all go (insert activity here, like a movie or amusement park) and have some fun!""  Watch how he reacts to that. You're giving him the keys to the whole thing in that case, and he'll either lock you out or leave the door open, as it were. If he isn't letting you in, express your displeasure. Dude needs to learn that relationships are a two-way street in that case.  Good luck! I hope it ends positively for you."

I didn't meet my boyfriend's best friend until after a year of dating- and it turned out that it was just my boyfriend being overly worried we wouldn't get along (both of us so important to him) and that his friend has very bad social anxiety and is very uncomfortable meeting people or carrying on a conversation with new people. The first meeting was awkward, but that's ok. We've been dating 3.5 years now, and it's all good. Some people just take longer to consolidate their ""world"" than others.

I get why he would hesitate to introduce you before you guys were official. Now that you ARE official, there's no reason for you NOT to be there.  Okay, there are two reasons, both of which should worry you: 1) The friends don't know you two are official yet, or 2) The friends don't know you exist at all  I would ask your BF why he doesn't want you there, and how much his friends know about you.   Really, the party would be the perfect time to introduce you to them now that you're official. If you guys are together 5-6 days a week, then they must know he's dating someone.

Life has to move forward, and it is your choice whether or not you want to be in an unhappy relationship while it does. Going to that hotel with him will suck. All you'll be able to think about is your intentions and probably feel guilt. And in regards to his autistic sister, provide your deepest apologies. Let them be genuine and the mother will find no fault if she is a reasonable adult. She cannot force you to do this. She will understand that it did not work out between you and her son.

Often times dating in your mid-30s is not as goofy.  Which brings up the main issue of how much of a difference there must be between you.  You're going to continue being insecure a lot because you can't possibly come close to measuring up to him financially, in employment, in possessions, etc at this stage of your life when he is at another stage entirely.    What should I change?   Bottom line is I guess I'd say I would change boyfriends.  Or in general just change your dating model to find people in your stage of life.   If you were dating a 21 year old guy, you guys probably just would have laughed about his mom being into crack and gone off on a whole fun tangent.     I date like crazy, most of my friends think I have it all figured out.   Also let me tell you this:  if you're ""dating like crazy"", you've not really figured anything out!"

Whether There is hanky-panky going on with Dave or not, it sounds like Ann is distracted from you, right now.  There seems like there's distance from you, on her end. She may say otherwise, but her actions prove differently. I can't imagine not checking on my boyfriend if he was having a medical procedure done, no matter how minor that procedure may be. (And for the record, I would question her about her relationship with Dave. The fact she didn't tell you he would be there partying with them initially just sets off some small alarms, in my opinion.)  But that's all I've got, man.

relationship_advice,3du0hw,feralcat3,6,Mon Jul 20 15:18:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly, man, she hasn't given you enough to head for the hills, but now might be the time to have a conversation about more frequent and thorough communication. Several things are possible. Best case scenario, you could be completely misreading everything and she isn't doing anything inappropriate. Mid-case scenario, David is giving her the kind of attention she craves, he flirts and it makes her feel pretty, but her commitment to you is keeping her (for the time being) from reciprocating in any damning sort of way. Worse case scenario, she's fucking the dude. But I don't think that's very likely.  Here's the danger of dating somebody with low self esteem: positive attention from anybody is very alluring to them. Even if she already has a boyfriend, a third party batting their eyelashes at her, telling her she's beautiful, etc., etc., is very affirming. But if this kind of attention from one person (I.E., you) isn't enough for her she needs to figure her shit out. I'm not saying break up, just maybe sit down and talk about whether she's being emotionally intimate with other guys, and telling her that you're beginning to feel like she's hiding things from you.  This middle case scenario, I think, is pretty likely. I've seen it a lot. It's this sort of weird situation where the person isn't outright cheating on their SO, but they're having deep bonding emotional intimate talks with another person in this sort of inappropriate-but-not-damning on-the-edge-of-cheating danger zone. The sort of situation where, if you broke up with her, she'd be shacked up with him that very same night. I will tell you that it's likely he would be the first shoulder she cried on.  So talk to her, don't trust Dave, and I hope that everything works out."
relationship_advice,3du0hw,zeporscheguy,2,Sun Jul 19 16:00:12 2015 UTC,hit the nail on the head.
relationship_advice,3du0hw,feralcat3,5,Sun Jul 19 16:40:25 2015 UTC,"Just talk to her in person. Ask her if there is something going on with Dave. Does she have feelings for him. Tell her that here is her chance to come clean. Even if nothing is going on, she seems like a lousy girlfriend who doesn't put much effort or consideration into your relationship. Or shes just stupid. Regardless of Dave, I might be inclined to break up anyway."
relationship_advice,3du0hw,Gyissan,2,Sun Jul 19 15:59:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know that she's cheating on you or planning to, but it does sound like Dave's into her and she may not have set the best boundaries (or likes the attention). Couple that with her history of body image issues/ depression, and it sounds like she still might be getting her self esteem through other people.  it's not insecure to say what you need in a relationship (for example, friends of the other sex but with boundaries). It's hard to walk the line between trusting your partner and being walked all over/cheated on, and you may need to say that you dont have a problem with her being friends with Dave, but she needs to be transparent about it (like if she's hanging out with him, don't hide it), and have better boundaries (not sleeping in the same bed as a straight guy ""friend,"" telling Dave and others that she has a bf, etc).  You say it would be easier if you left. I did the same thing; broke up with my bf when he was acting shady, because he wasnt making me feel safe about his close friendship with another girl.  I wish I had put my foot down sooner and stated my boundaries/what I need in a relationship. It was ridiculous to break up over speculation, but it made me feel really terrible all the time, and the girl did end up having feelings for him.  I wouldn't break up with her immediately (seems too hasty), but I'd tell her that these are non-negotiable things if she wants to be in a relationship with you.  Now about the surgery...unless you downplayed it ( said you just had to stop into the doctor, and told her it was no big deal), I think she's being pretty cold."
relationship_advice,3du0hw,Gyissan,2,Sun Jul 19 15:15:04 2015 UTC,"Dude, she definitely has something going on with Dave. You should have realized it after she messaged Dave asking where he was and if he was close by for no fucking reason."

relationship_advice,3du0hw,dewarsmaduro,13,Mon Jul 20 15:32:42 2015 UTC,"I would be very suspicious about it too. I think there's something going on here, I have no proof but that's how it feels. So no, I think you are not over reacting.   Just don't confront her, and see where its going (while focusing on yourself and improving yourself, AFAIK she is in her own world now) confrontng her will only accomplish her hiding it better (in the case something is on).  The fact that there was Dave and she didnt mentioned it is also a red flag coupled with the intention to not inviting you to the party.  My 2 cents."
relationship_advice,3du0hw,Profdiddy,4,Sun Jul 19 14:56:00 2015 UTC,"Your 2 cents are extremely helpful, unfortunetely I have already confronted her about what happened last week, both her and Dave will be at a party I'll be at next week and this time many of my own loyal friends will be there so if something is sketchy there perhaps I'll get some more insight from my own friends."
relationship_advice,3du0hw,Profdiddy,10,Sun Jul 19 15:09:23 2015 UTC,"If I was out with friends and my SO went to the ER with an injury, I would sure as hell find a way to go to the hospital to make sure he was ok and to be with him.  Fooling around aside, she didn't seem too concerned about you at all, especially after saying she would pick you up from surgery in the morning then not even contacting you until the next afternoon. There is no excuse for that, that's just shitty.  Whether she is doing shady things with another dude, you have reason to be pissed just based on how selfish and thoughtless her actions were."
relationship_advice,3du0hw,abcocktail,5,Sun Jul 19 15:39:31 2015 UTC,"It is my opinion that this has a ""full-shady"" vibe. I do not think you are over reacting. I would be making plans to remove myself from this scenario in the very near futures."
relationship_advice,3du0hw,sjf4n,4,Sun Jul 19 15:38:39 2015 UTC,"Walk away now. She is most likely cheating. All of the signs are there. The panicked looks, the fb messages, the late nights, neglecting in a medical emergency. Most importantly,  her self esteem issues. Do you think she will not seek others for validation in the future? Her emotional response to your encouraging words has refractory impact over time. It is only a matter of time before she strays, save yourself the heartache."

I mean that your girlfriend may not even be aware that you are feeling this way.  In fact, she may have no idea that her actions are leaving you feeling suspicion, neglect, and worry.  Your girlfriend reached out by texting to check if everything is okay with you. Take this opportunity to the next level and engage with her in a conversation about the way you are feeling inside.   Maybe she is feeling similarly.  Hope things turn out the way you want them to."

Of course, none of this matters on Tinder because I'm not David Beckham. That's just the way it goes man, you need to be attractive for tinder to work."
relationship_advice,3dudr8,alphawolf29,4,Sun Jul 19 18:00:38 2015 UTC,I think the reason for this is that there is so little emphasis on personality built into the tinder platform. Them's the brokes.
relationship_advice,3dudr8,themoderation,18,Sun Jul 19 20:34:36 2015 UTC,"It's more important to some people than to others. And obviously attractiveness is subjective.   It's hard to change the way your face looks, but you can do things to improve your appearance. No one wants to date a slob. Dress nicely, work out.   But remember, looks are shallow, and don't last. It's personality that matters way more. At the end of the day, we want to be with the one who makes us laugh, makes us feel special, makes us feel safe."
relationship_advice,3dudr8,Mimsy-Porpington,6,Sun Jul 19 16:00:53 2015 UTC,"But on tinder, where a majority of people just look at the fist few photos and don't look at the description area much (if at all), looks matter first.   I've got a powerlifting body. My friend is a classically good looking italian guy. Who do you think got more tinder likes? Who do you think got propositioned for sex more?  In real life both matter for long term relationshipsuccess. On tinder and one night stands, looks matter more."
relationship_advice,3dudr8,MIL215,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:48:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's true that Tinder is shallower than some of the others. And it highly depends on if you're looking for a relationship or a hookup. I was answering from the standpoint of looking for a relationship, because he mentioned girlfriends.   But as a girl, when I was on Tinder, I can tell you that no matter how good looking you were, if you had nothing in your profile, you got swiped left. Those of us who are worth the trouble care about looks way less than we care about what's in your noggin'."
relationship_advice,3dudr8,Mimsy-Porpington,5,Sun Jul 19 17:39:54 2015 UTC,Also true. I was answering from a Tinder perspective. My perspective on tinder for a girl and a guy are drastically different like most dating sites. Girls descriminate up front. Guys say yes to as many girls that he finds attractive as possible and then discriminates the mutual right swipes.

relationship_advice,3dudr8,TomSawyer83,2,Sun Jul 19 19:19:47 2015 UTC,"This is in context of a dating app based on physical looks. The app is a poor representation of sexuality in any form, as it is bases first impressions entirely on viewing your picture first then your profile's personality. Under this context, Tinder as a dating platform to find a relationship is poor. Given those guidelines, there are better platforms to find a relationship."
relationship_advice,3dudr8,Love_and_Beer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:40:15 2015 UTC,"That is true. But you'd be surprised.

There are many things that can make someone attractive.   Also, you cannot only consider one of the individuals. Attraction is based on the wants/desires of one individual and the ability of the second individual to satisfy those wants/desires. You must consider both individuals in the dyad to understand why an attraction does or does not exist."

relationship_advice,3dudr8,meinsamr,3,Sun Jul 19 23:48:19 2015 UTC,"When I was in high school I have seen a lot of average looking guys get girlfriends when they themselves were not all that great looking. So do people really want you to be attractive?   When girls know guys' personalities, they can be attracted to the guys who are confident over looks.  This can also make otherwise good looking guys unattractive if they lack confidence.  High school forces people to get to know each other in a way that won't happen after.    Attractive men do better on sites where women only have their pictures to go on.  If you're not attractive, you will probably have more luck letting girls get to know you before you date them."
relationship_advice,3dudr8,TheAntiPedantic,3,Sun Jul 19 17:18:17 2015 UTC,"Because of the way Tinder is set up you make a snap decision based on their looks, swipe left, swipe right, sure there is profile info you can go to but few do until they swipe right and many profiles have next to nothing, some literally have no information. So it is superficial and based on looks so the better looking you are the more swipe rights you will get.  OKcupid, match.com and even POF have full profiles, sure looks count in terms of physical attraction but I tend to look at the whole profile anyway. I like OKCUpid especially the questions which most women love to answer."

I will show my friends a picture of a guy whom I think is the cutest thing ever, and they'll be completely indifferent, or vice versa. Plus, people like dating someone who seems to be about the same level as attractiveness as them.

relationship_advice,3dwtwh,Sitral,-13,Mon Jul 20 04:54:42 2015 UTC,well they have a monogamous relationship. if I was with her I wouldn't have it be monogamous if that's what she needed. idk. as long as she communicated it with me I would be okay with it but she had never communicated that to her fiancee.
relationship_advice,3dwtwh,Sitral,14,Mon Jul 20 04:57:59 2015 UTC,"That still makes her a liar and an incredibly selfish, disrespectful person.

relationship_advice,3dwtwh,Bobwayne17,8,Mon Jul 20 05:02:21 2015 UTC,"I don't really think you want advice when you say ""this is messed up but I don't care."" and ""yeah I know but logic doesn't apply here"".   Really, let's be honest, what you wanted was to vent about being a party of a totally fucked situation and wanted some type of validation that this ""situation"" is somehow salvageable.   To all outsiders, the situation is not salvageable and you should have cut your losses at ""engaged"", but you didn't and now you find yourself in this. Literally no good can come from this - the person you're ""involved"" with is a terrible person that obviously completely disregards the feelings of others.   If you put aside your feelings for like, meh ten seconds, you would be able to see that this is a super unhealthy situation and you need to cut and run while you still can.   If you don't, I can literally GUARANTEE this will end even worse than you think. Never in the history of relationships has something like this worked out. You never hear ""well my wife cheated on her ex-husband with me and now we have a super healthy and successful relationship"" because it doesn't ever happen. You're in a totally fucked situation - leave. That's the best advice you can get. Leave."

It's harder when you can't go to school everyday and meet people in class. You need to find someone who can be committed to YOU now, not someone who is already committed to someone else. That person can become your NEW best friend, and they (hopefully) won't try and hurt you like this.   There's no advice for this situation that can fix it for you, that's the hardest part. This is a life lesson that you need to internalize and make sure you don't repeat. Adding romantic qualities to friendships usually end in some type of titanic-esque failure in my experience."

She is manipulating the both of you and using both of you.   Clearly this whole situation is bothering you, I am also going to assume that you are not supper happy about the relationship the two of you have.

relationship_advice,3dxjdz,doodlebop12486,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:25:16 2015 UTC,Solid advice.  You can and will get over him.  It just takes more time.  This probably isnt the advice you were hoping for but it is the truth.
relationship_advice,3dw84g,amikkrazyy,4,Mon Jul 20 01:26:12 2015 UTC,"Spending this amount of time together is not unreasonable at all to the average person, but I understand his feelings because I am very introverted like this too. Spending Friday night, Saturday, and Sunday with someone I am new to dating would be extremely draining on me. So no, you are definitely not being unreasonable, but unfortunately neither is he. I'm sure people are going to jump on the fact that he's unemployed and plays video games, but that doesn't really have anything to do with the issue here. It might just come down to a case of incompatibility.  Spacing out the time you spend together would probably be the best solution here, but I know you are very busy during the week. So it might be tough."
relationship_advice,3dw84g,JessPlays,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:23:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. I like spending time alone, and spending all that time with someone whom I've only been dating for a few months would drain me."
relationship_advice,3dw84g,AlenaBrolxFlami,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:36:53 2015 UTC,"I think he just doesn't like you anymore, I mean, read what you just wrote pretending someone else described this situation to you and asked you for advice... Doesn't it sound like employed girl could do better than unemployed guy who lets her sit at his house with nothing to do while he plays video games and then asks her to leave?!? You say you are 26 and 27 but this reads like you guys are 13/14... I think you need to break up with him and keep dating until you find someone who is as invested in your relationship as you are. It says a lot about your self esteem that you are going to adjust your expectations and schedule and give this another try even though it is an arrangement you aren't happy with.  Are you afraid nobody else will treat you any better?"
relationship_advice,3dw84g,sometimesineedhelp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:30:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly? Thomas is acting like a scrub. This combination of unemployed, spending his days playing video games and chilling, not respecting that you make time out of a busy schedule to be with him, and not being able to put himself in your shoes. It sounds like he doesn't respect the time you do give him, and isn't putting in much effort? I'm just reading into your post, but his actions seem to say that he just wants someone to call a gf but doesn't want to put in the work that comes along with having a gf. Voice this concern with him. If he insists that he wants a day-a-week gf and you don't want that, you're both looking for something different in a relationship."
relationship_advice,3dw84g,oling27,0,Mon Jul 20 01:45:02 2015 UTC,"I can understand him wanting one day/ afternoon of the whole weekend to himself. I think you should honor his request and leave in the morning of Sunday. It will also give you time to work on a hobby/ hike/ read/hang with friends as you work so hard during the week.  The issue I see is his lack of job and video game playing at all hours. This just might not be the right guy for you. If it feels off, listen to your gut and rethink this relationship."
relationship_advice,3dweuy,hermanfelker,5,Mon Jul 20 02:26:17 2015 UTC,She doesn't want to.  Stop trying to force it on her.
relationship_advice,3dweuy,Congzilla,4,Mon Jul 20 02:42:46 2015 UTC,"As a music teacher I have to say that since she hasn't shown interest the worst thing you can do is make her learn an instrument. People who are forced to make music don't generally enjoy the experience and as you and I both know, making music is about the emotion. If she ever wants to, she'll tell you. Until then, make music for her! My SO doesn't play but he loves listening to me play! And I like sharing my music with him."
relationship_advice,3dx0lc,lovely-daisy,3,Mon Jul 20 06:07:03 2015 UTC,"For Guy A:   I am confused about his intentions.    He makes sexual remarks to you on facebook, and he sent you a picture of his crotch. He wants to hook up.   For Guy B:   I am so confused about this guy and whether he only considers me as a friend.   This is more tough. Maybe he's testing the waters with you. Maybe he thinks you're close enough friends to where you guys can go to the movies together without any ulterior motives.   Ask him out on a coffee date? If he reacts poorly to it being refereed to as a date, you can always back it up;   ""A date between friends. Y'know, like the movies, not an actual date!""  If he reacts positively, then hopefully you'll have a good date."

relationship_advice,3dx0lc,epictorturebeard,3,Mon Jul 20 09:38:08 2015 UTC,"For guy A, like u/That_Kitty_Cat says, he's definitely looking to hook up.  Guy B seems to like you. If it felt like a date then, it was probably his intention for it to be a date. It was probably his way to see how he felt about you before moving to a new city. If you have feelings for him and actually could see him as more than just a friend, then maybe try  showing him... just responding to his texts positively doesn't mean to him that you like him, he's probably wanting you to initiate some of the conversations. As a guy, I know that if I initiate conversation with a girl that I like 3-4 consecutive times without her ever initiating, no matter how nice the responses are, I automatically assume that she only sees me as a friend, and I lose interest real quick. I'm not sure how far away he is or how often he comes by the city you live in, but maybe he hasn't had any opportunity to really ask you out, or is worried about long distance, or is worried that you still only see him as a friend. My advice is that guy b probably does like you, take the initiative to engage in conversations without waiting for him to be the only one to start talking. If he responds positively, mention that you liked going to the movies with him before he left and you wish you could do more things like that with him. Hopefully this helps a bit, good luck!"
relationship_advice,3dx0lc,epictorturebeard,2,Mon Jul 20 08:45:13 2015 UTC,Hi /u/epictorturebeard :D thank you so much for your in-depth and thoughtful reply. Your perspective as a guy means a lot. I am not very good at initiating conversation because I'm afraid the guy would see me as desperate and needy :( I'll try and initiate a conversation right now :)

relationship_advice,3dvrab,kc1328,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:23:01 2015 UTC,Thank you for your reply. I don't really know how to find a girlfriend. I've tried for a very long time. I don't really go out much other than school. It's just that she's everything I've ever wanted in a girl. It's hard to distance myself from them I want to see her so badly. But the more I see her the more it hurts. I guess I'm a glutton for punishment.

relationship_advice,3dvqjm,Randomthrowaway32123,2,Sun Jul 19 22:51:10 2015 UTC,"The best thing you can do for her right now is work on yourself. Of course, maybe do something nice for her like cook her dinner and run a hot bubble bath for her and give her a massage to help relieve her stress. But what will make her TRULY happy is to see you making an effort to squash these insecurities.     For example, look into therapy or self help books. Tell her over the dinner you make her ""babe, this weekend really shook me and opened my eyes to how unfair I was being to you. So I ordered this book off amazon to help me work through my problems. If you want, Id enjoy it if you read it with me so we can tackle this as a team. I want this to make us closer and stronger."" Or ""I've been shopping for a therapist to talk to to help me get to the bottom of this and come out on top.""     Of course these things will take work and effort on your part. But it is WORTH IT. You will kill one of your weaknesses and strengthen your relationship. It's extremely important to follow through here. If you don't, she might have problems trusting you to be true to your word, and you will still have problems trusting her for no reason at all.     Good luck!  EDIT:// I also wanted to point out how awesome it is for you to have the humility to admit your weaknesses, and how in turn it becomes your strength. If you are able to see where you are falling short, and you recognize that it is indeed a problem, that puts you on the path towards growth and healing. Be thankful for this and use it to your advantage."

relationship_advice,3dvqjm,oling27,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:21:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe get to know her friends.

relationship_advice,3dvalj,derrdic3,6,Sun Jul 19 20:36:22 2015 UTC,"If you are suffering from depression you need to see your doctor. That is on you. Being with the person of your dreams does not cure depression or anxiety (I would know).  As for her, she is married. Trying to win her away from her husband is beneath you, because you are a man with integrity. If you are unable to spend time with her without destroying your own sense of integrity and honor, then tell her the truth. But don't go into it hoping she'll through herself in your arms and commit adultery. Go into it knowing that you need to heal yourself and be whole without her. And sometimes the only way to do that is with no contact."

I guess the fact that she was right in front of me the whole time and I am now hitting the maturity level that I don't want a trophy girl or someone to show off to my family and friends, I just want a best friend.  Maybe I'm misreading ALL the queues and I actually know nothing about women but it strongly feels like there's always been that undertone of more then a friendship"

relationship_advice,3dw7ox,Sgtsilly,3,Mon Jul 20 01:22:18 2015 UTC,"It might not be a phobia.....she could have possibly been a victim of rape, or a physically abusive ex. She just isn't comfortable with touch and physical intimacy at this point, no reasons really needed. As for the FB official thing, some people just don't like to put a label on relationships whether it's because they fear it will ruin a good thing, or they are afraid of commitment. Her comment about being tempted to have sex with you if it's FB official makes me think she has some commitment issues? You seem like a lovely guy from your post, but if you're struggling with her barriers and the need to understand where you stand in her life, maybe it's time to move on? Maybe voice your concerns again and see how she responds?"
relationship_advice,3dw7ox,oling27,2,Mon Jul 20 01:56:48 2015 UTC,"Well i know for a fact that she has had a boyfriend who tried to kill her. I also have my suspicions that there could be something more too like rape. However I think I have been proving myself and reassuring her that I am by no means an ordinary guy. She trusted me enough to get really drunk, and I took care of her. Even as I was tucking her in bed, she said that I could lay in bed with her. But considering how much her sober side hates even the slightest bit of intimacy, I decided that could be a horrible idea and that the couch was the best place for me. So I just hate how I've been trying to get close to her and yet I don't feel like I'm getting any closer to the relationship I want with her. I am a cuddler and I love to give back massages, and if she isn't capable of letting me close enough to do that, then I dont think this will work, as much as I hate to say that. I have voiced my concerns and she usually dismisses them or doesn't give me a answer to what I'm looking for. I asked her if she had remembered our conversation about what I thought being in a relationship meant, and I reinforced the thought that I think she may be worth waiting for. Then I asked her if she had any other comments to which she replied ""I think I'm worth waiting for."" that is not the reply I was wanting. I was looking for anything that would give me an idea of hope for this or that I'm doing the right thing. Idk... I just feel really disappointed and don't really know what else I can do. I think my next tactic will be to distance myself and see if she will try to draw me back in."
relationship_advice,3dw7ox,oling27,2,Mon Jul 20 02:45:26 2015 UTC,"I think with an ex who tried to kill her and being a possible victim of rape, your efforts, although wonderful, might not ever be enough to ""prove"" yourself to her. Touch seems to be a big part of relationships for you, and with her situation, it's not a sure thing of when or if touch will ever be comfortable, especially if she refuses/avoids talking about it. You don't know how long you might have to wait. Another month? A year? A few years? The whole distancing yourself game doesn't really seem worth it. What happens if she does draw you back in but still isn't comfortable with touch (which may very well be the case)?"
relationship_advice,3dw7ox,RankInsubordination,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:04:07 2015 UTC,"That's a very good point. So distancing would be useless. I really hate this. I really do like her, but I'm just not happy. Especially the thing that I love so much to be able to touch her in a passionate gently way is repulsive to her. She is going away for a week soon. I think I might give her until that time when she gets back to make me an actual part of her life with a title. As far as the touching goes next opportunity I have I might bring up how uncomfortable to me that is and ask her if she ever believes she can work past it. I hate that the only time I can get affection from her is when she is drunk. I know she has a past, but she has to see by now I'm not like anyone she has ever dated in the past."

I think that's fair; make it less about your judgment of who he's openly dating, and more about the fact that it's happening in your shared house.  Why can't he go over to the girl's house, for example?  I agree that this could get messy for you (will likely create drama); the bf is not going to be pleased that you're reporting back to her or seeming to dictate what he does, and the gf might be upset to find out how physically and emotionally intimate he is with this other girl (maybe, depending on how OK she is with the whole poly thing), but I think the gf deserves to know that the arrangement is bothering the other roommates and isn't respectful.   edit: also, wow, they've already dated 7 years and they are only 22/23? I was picturing late 20s/early 30s."
relationship_advice,3dukcf,feralcat3,0,Sun Jul 19 17:28:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's the only relationship they have ever been in... She deserves so much better but she doesn't know any different. That is a whole other issue, though!"
relationship_advice,3dukcf,feralcat3,3,Sun Jul 19 17:36:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, don't make it about the bf being slimy (even if you think that, it's best for her to come to her own conclusions). But as roommates, it's fair to have ground rules about repeat overnight guests, since he's bringing a stranger into your home and making you uncomfortable."
relationship_advice,3dukcf,tinybear,2,Sun Jul 19 17:42:56 2015 UTC,"If you're uncomfortable, talk to the BF first. Say ""hey, I know you and the GF have an open relationship, and who else you date is not my business, but your PDA is really excessive and making all the housemates uneasy. It's not appropriate to have someone over every day who isn't paying rent, and your constant PDA in public places really decreases our ability to use and enjoy this space.""  From there, see what his reaction is. Be can tell you to fuck off and mind your own business, at which point I'd stop living with a roommate who is disrespectful and rude. Or he can curb his behavior and you can get over it.   If you know this will ruin your friend's trip, then save it till she's home. ""Yeah, we had to have a talk with whats-his-name because he had this one girl over all the time. I know that your arrangement was open, but homegirl was here ALL the time, so we talked about it and he was kind of a dick about it. I'm considering finding someplace else to live when our lease is up.""  Also, if she is unhappy with the unequal way their open relationship works out, then she really should not be in an open relationship. Those relationships only work with great respect, communication and support, all of which seem to be missing here."

Yes, if she likes you, she will be upset, but that's better than continuing in a relationship that is essentially one sided. Besides, it's not your concern that she is happy, only that you are.  Take this all with a grain of salt, as like I said, I'm not really experienced with these kinds of scenarios, I'm merely commenting based on what I've seen and heard others go through."

relationship_advice,3dwfaj,1fuathyro,0,Mon Jul 20 07:37:08 2015 UTC,"she has 4 children which are now in foster care due to a domestic violence abuse case with her ex-husband   I'm curious: Why are the kids in foster care now, and not in her care? Am I missing some legal thing here, or is she unable to provide for those kids? Will she be able to regain custody of those kids? If she's a basket case and couldn't care for her kids, that would change the risk calculation for you.  This is really complicated stuff, so there's no way to tell how ""dangerous"" the situation is for you. If the husband is determined enough to get to her, a restraining order sure as hell won't stop him -- but I feel like it can't be THAT easy for a guy fresh out of prison to get across the Canadian border.  I can't guess her feelings towards the guy either, and that makes a big difference especially in abuse cases. It's a good sign that she broke the cycle of abuse and sent him to prison though.   If you're going to pursue this, I would take things really slowly for the first several (even 6+) months until you get a feel for how ready she is to move on with a new man. Chances are you'll get a vibe one way or another after a few more months."
relationship_advice,3dwfaj,griminald,0,Mon Jul 20 03:14:07 2015 UTC,thank you so much for your words  the foster care people came to take the children away because of a dangerous household situation.  when the police came to take her husband away she said she was in a wreck and tried to run away.  im not sure if this makes any sense but i think she was really depressed and unable to take care of them.  in fact there is a custody battle going on right now and the court date is coming soon.  it is to decide whether she is allowed to take full custody or if her parents gain the custody.  but to be honest its still early and i feel like i do not know the full extent.    you are right though to takes things very slowly and with a lot of caution.

I have dysthymia (constant, underlying depression) and often normal depression on top of that, and never realized it wasn't normal to feel like that all the time. You say he's ""analytical, deep, thinks a lot"", which are all terms that fit with a person with dysthymia. I'd strongly recommend he try taking some tests online and go see a counselor or therapist. I'm not qualified to diagnose someone, but I'd be very surprised if he wasn't suffering from depression, at the least, or dysthymia.

Which the dynamic with him is important, it should not be a focus at this point in the relationship. You can't bond with her if she's not capable/willing to invest in you personally.  Her bringing the kid into this is not a wise idea, IMHO. Kids develop relationship attachments very easily and should this thing fail the kid is going to suffer because his mother is not appropriately managing this relationship and what her son is exposed to."

They have been broken up over four years and he lives with a woman so I don't think it's jealousy.   After we drop him off we are going to spend three days in a city a couple hours away.  Just the two of us.   I'm not nervous about meeting the dad. Don't really care about that.  im nervous but can't pinpoint why.

Hopefully my advice will still be helpful, even though it is a little generic.  First and foremost, check to see if your town or a local town has an active reddit community. I live in Dallas. Ours is extremely active. I've met tons of people and I've gotten a few relationships out of it. I cannot emphasize enough how successful this can be when it comes to befriending others. I've met people from other major cities who claim their subs are also active. The ages ranges and so do the occupations, so you should be able to find someone with similar interests to yourself. I did skim a bit and noticed the race thing. That hasn't been an issue so far as I can tell with the Dallas group, though there will be people with their tired jokes, but they're few and usually well-meaning.  Meetup.com! The site is dedicated to getting people to meetup who share some stated similar interest. It's fairly active, I know people who use the site successfully, and I've run into a couple by random myself.  Co-ed sports leagues, like kickball. They're generally friendly and they like to drink.  Hobbies like indoor climbing. I don't do this and never have, but friends tell me that people are really talkative and open to strangers at these places."

First, I just pretend like I'm already friends with them. I'll be as friendly and outgoing as I would with a friend I've had for years. This is half so they'll think I'm nice and half so they see how stupid goofy I am up front.     Next, I usually start out with small plans. ""Hey, want to do lunch today? I hear Chipotle is doing a buy one get on free deal!"" Don't make a big deal out of it, and if they say no that's ok. I usually either do lunch, coffee, or find something that either the person or I need help on. A project for work, DIY, whatever.     After a couple of times hanging out like that, I usually feel comfortable enough to see if they want to do a game night, go for drinks, etc etc. Sometimes people just aren't interested in being friends. Other times it will seem like they don't, but they are genuinely busy with stuff.    I've heard that doing small favors is a good way to start up a friendship. Nothing too big, or they might feel awkward and indebted to you. Just a small little something to open the door.    Hopefully this helps a bit. Making friends, especially as an adult, can be difficult and frustrating. Best of luck to you!"

He might just be shy about that, not know what to say in response, or be worried about someone stealing and posting your nudes. You have to push a little (but nicely!).

It doesn't matter that you (or I ) are triggered-it is more just to learn what starts it so you can look out for the signs and stop the behavior (yelling) before it even starts, so to speak.   I have vowed to stop the behavior...I'v been pretty good. I have to keep reminding myself that it is not okay and that I have to learn to communicate without raising my voice, even when I'm upset. It's not easy but it can be done! This is for the next time...let this guy go...if you seriously only yelled at him this one time and he left then he doesn't care about you all that much to not even give you a chance to fix it. If you did this all the time and he was done with it-then this is a sign you have to work on yourself."

Do you honestly think that someone would go through the trouble of getting to know you and asking for your number, only to lose interest because she had to wait a few hours for an initial text back? Nah, son!  Just chit chat. Talk to her. You talked to her at camp, so why would it be difficult now?   No idea about that transportation thing. I mean, if she understands or is in a similar situation, you two could talk about where to go and what to do that loosely agrees with the bus schedule."
relationship_advice,3dwqqk,naked_avenger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:21:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think you messed anything up! She seems okay. Just initiate conversation somehow. ""How was your day?"" Or maybe make a joke out of it. ""I brought my phone with me this time so my reply won't take six hours lol."" Or jump straight to it, ""I'm so glad I met you at blahblah camp and that we kept in contact. I'm thinking about checking out this movie/restaurant/cool tech event/etc. on blahblah date. Would you like to join me?"" As for the long distance thing, public transportation can be a hassle (running late/not reliable) but you could still make this work. Try and meet in between your towns, or alternate traveling to each others' towns. Make it so that one person isn't always doing the legwork. Also make sure to keep the person updated if transport is running late. Letting a person know ""The bus is running behind schedule. I'll likely be 10 minutes late."" and then updating again maybe, ""I'm just a few minutes away now"" puts a person at ease and makes that time pass by quicker."

Either you're just not that important to him at all, or someone else (his real GF) is and you're the bit on the side.  You were a teen when you started dating him, now you are a young adult.  Move into young adulthood by ditching him and finding a guy who wants you in his life and shares his life with you by allowing you to be his FB friend, meet his IRL friends and family."

I'm not close to my parents either (I speak to them much less often than he sounds like he speaks to his) yet I told my parents about my partner pretty soon so it doesn't sound like the real reason. The second Facebook thing is very sketchy. I'd say it's make or break time, he's hiding you for a reason and you have a right to know what that reason is."

A broken nose should be a wakeup call but apparently not.  What you have here is an alcoholic of the type known as a binge alcoholic, weekend alcoholic etc. Lets not forget the damage she could be doing to her body, her liver especially.  Its not controlling to not want to be involved with someone like this or not want to live with someone like this. Do you really want to be waiting at home all the time wondering if she will make it ? Do you want to take her to parties and be that embarassing drunk ?  You can tell her she can do what she wants but you dont want to be a part of it, I wouldnt call that controlling."

Usually when we are socially drinking together she curbs herself more, and when I'm around after work she comes straight or(rarely) will go out for one drink.  I feel she has slowed down considerably since we started going out, so from her point of view she probably sees that as proof of there not being a problem. I'm going to have see if she is willing to stop drinking liquor."
relationship_advice,3dv5en,tookmyname,-2,Sun Jul 19 20:16:03 2015 UTC,"More than 90% of binge drinkers are not in fact alcoholics. We don't know enough of her dependence to know. Sounds like she should avoid drinking either way, but that doesn't make her an alcoholic in the real or defined sense.   http://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2014/14_0329.htm  That's said, the fact that she has no shame or concern afterwards is more concerning than the fact that she poorly gauges her drinking g to begin with. If she spent time soul searching and making at least some changes and adjustment etc after an apparent blackout or incident, or taking a break from drinking to reestablish her relationship with alcohol, etc there would be more hope for this woman."
relationship_advice,3dv5en,Love_and_Beer,-1,Sun Jul 19 21:36:54 2015 UTC,I'm pretty certain that she is not an alcoholic in the defined sense. But I'm worried that's all the justification she needs to not regret or change her drinking habits. Kind of a mental catch 22.
relationship_advice,3dv5en,tookmyname,0,Sun Jul 19 21:53:48 2015 UTC,"She abuses it when she drinks to the point where she blacks out. She's an alcoholic. She cannot assert control when she drinks and clearly has impulses she cannot handle on her own. Drinking till you blackout is something you do in college, not after you're 30 fucking years old. She needs to shit and get off the pot, because it's time to grow the fuck up.   You need to sternly tell her that this isn't acceptable behavior and it needs to stop. For her health. For your relationship. You cannot trust someone who can't handle something as simple as limit control.   Whatever you do, DO NOT MARRY THIS WOMAN. Demand from her that she get help to deal with her addiction. I've walked down this path before brother, this isn't something you want to tolerate. Not at your age."
relationship_advice,3dv5en,Love_and_Beer,0,Mon Jul 20 00:45:27 2015 UTC,"Technically nothing we have been told makes her 100% sure to be an alcoholic though. Let's use the terms properly or you dilute it's meaning. Irresponsible binge drinker with lack of control does not always = alcoholic. There's plenty of people who simply should not drink who are not alcoholics. I know it's easy to throw words around to drive the point, but it's simply inaccurate. The AA cult culture is at odds with science and they've won the hearts of those who see the danger of alcohol, epically those who it's affected directly(you), but that doesn't make it accurate."

Among other problems, at that point in your life you should have learned your limit. What she's doing now is something I would expect out of someone in their early 20s, not a seasoned adult."

And the times she does get wasted are always a result of afterwork socializing that just seems to be a breeding ground for alcohol related debauchery.

The parents already know he has a troubled childhood but don't know the effects of it on his behavior towards her. They just know he needs family support and does come over often just to help clean, cook, work in the yard because he doesn't like being at his current home. The parents will I'm sure worry about him since he won't come around after she tells them the truth, but it is necessary.  I am standing by her to help her through this and give her all the support she needs. But I'm leaving the responsibility of telling her parents the truth all on her.

I think it can happen with anyone throughout patches of their relationship. I'm always curious when I meet elderly couples who have been married 40+ years. I always ask questions. They all say there are dry patches. But who but you can tell if your losing attraction or just in a dry patch? Put in some extra effort right now and see if things improve. Remember what attracted you to her to begin with. Ask yourself what you want in a lifelong partner and evaluate if your having grass is greener syndrome... Good luck!
relationship_advice,3dushr,Reek138,3,Sun Jul 19 19:42:32 2015 UTC,"I've also wondered about elderly couples like that. I'd probably be okay with my relationship becoming ""comfortable"" instead of ""interesting and fun"" down the line, but after only 4 years seems way too early.  I think this might be a good plan for now, thank you.  I also might try and document my feelings over the next few weeks, that should help me see if this is getting better or not."
relationship_advice,3dushr,macimom,2,Sun Jul 19 20:05:29 2015 UTC,You have to work to get out of the dry patch-otherwise you do lose attraction.  How do you work to get out of the dry patch-one of the best things is to do completely NEW things together.  Or do things that require thinking-like read the same book and then talk about it. Take a class together. Do a DIY project together that is new to both of you.
relationship_advice,3dushr,FuzzFeis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:02:18 2015 UTC,"Well I'm not sure I'm the best advice giver but I want to help. It could be just a phase in the relationship, not just you. Ask her if she's been feeling like it's ""not like the old days"" or something, nothing too aggressive or out there to begin with. Plus I think the fact you realize this and seek help pretty much stands for ""yes you love her"". Instead of ignoring this and letting it get worse, props to you. Also what the other comment said, you two could've grown each other out, meaning that you mature as people but in different directions, which is okay, but an ""official"" standpoint between you two has to be established. I don't know if it made much sense, but key to resolving most problems is simply talking. Sorry if I didn't help. Keep us posted man and good luck."

relationship_advice,3dumzt,a2freema,2,Sun Jul 19 17:28:03 2015 UTC,"Situations like yours boil down to how you feel and not about a rational weighting of pros and cons.  It sounds like you want to be with your boyfriend. So go with him and be a team. LA has plenty of opportunities for acting work if you're willing to work and stick it out. Just be sure to get your media reel together and seek representation. You made a plan for NY so make a plan for LA.   You're 18 which means you've got flexibility in the choices you make. You can make a bad choice and still recover while you have enough spirit and physical strength to do so. Besides, it's a little cheaper to live in LA. The weather is great. It's the center of the entertainment universe. Oh, but you will need a car. Ideally, both of you should have a car."

She's not the girl of my dreams, I don't see myself marrying her, but I still love her. I want to be with her for as long as we're both happy together.    You love her, but you aren't in love with her.   Look, you've only been together for 5 months. The newness of the relationship is starting to wear off and you're at the point where you are coming to terms with your compatibility.   Anyway, people speak different love languages. The key is to figure out how she wants to be shown affection. A good indicator is how she shows affection to you. Google love languages and learn. But don't do it for selfish reasons. She may be looking for a lifelong partner, and if you don't want to be that to her then don't waste her time."

I Googled love languages and I have a much better understanding of how these differences have come up.  From her words and my score, I can tell there is a difference in affection.  I'll work on trying to speak hers!  Question: Should I show this to her and ask her to take it?  And then maybe start discussing our how I can meet her love language better?  I can tell it's definitely acts of service and little gifts, but if she wants a break I don't want to disrespect that.  No, 5 months isn't an anniversary, but we wanted to celebrate now since I'll be gone for our 6 month next month.  Not too logical, but I still thought ""why not?"" and enjoyed it.   You love her, but you aren't in love with her.   Does this make me a bad person?  I'm scared that it does, because I don't want to hurt her, but I don't want to lead her along either.   She may be looking for a lifelong partner, and if you don't want to be that to her then don't waste her time.   Would it also be unwise to discuss that when the time comes?  I think it would hurt her if we broke, maybe even if I admitted that.  I don't want to let her down, or be another emotional hurt in her life.  I guess I'm just scared it might be my first breakup."

She needs something that you don't know how to give her because you don't ""speak the same language"" there is nothing wrong with the either of you and you definitely shouldn't change yourself for anyone or ask anyone to change for you.   You are both young, first relationships are a bit of a mother fucker too, all these emotions and feelings are coming up that your brain is only learning to process because its never had to before.   take your break, but realistically, you two should break up."

relationship_advice,3dtd7e,cheddardumpling,26,Sun Jul 19 07:03:18 2015 UTC,"If his communication is vague, then you need to seek clarification. Ask questions like ""what do you mean by be sexier"", and ""what kind of things do you find sexy"", is it the way you dress, is it your level of aggression (or lack of it), is it a lack of involving a kink of his? Really these are all things you should be discussing with him. We can't really help what is a lack of communication between you two without actual dyadic communication going on.    I don't have the ""sexy gene"" and only the ""nice girl gene"".    Bullshit. It's a cultivation and expression of the self. Sexiness come from confidence, trust, passion, and desire.  If he wants to have a better sex life with you, he needs to put in the work. He needs to invest the time to communicate with you, create a dialogue about what your needs and wants both her and how you can fufill them together. He needs to put the emotional investment in you that makes you feel safe, comfortable, and sexy so that you are free to explore your sexuality with him.  This whole ""figure it out"" business is incredibly lazy and selfish. You are not there to perform for his pleasure, and his lack of effort and lack of empathy to me would be a massive red flag that is going to show outside the bedroom at some point."
relationship_advice,3dtd7e,sinscriven,19,Sun Jul 19 08:14:54 2015 UTC,"Hi. I think I actually know where you're coming from because of one of my previous relationships.    I think that, at the core, ultimately, sexiness comes from three things: confidence, being comfortable with your partner, and being comfortable with yourself. The standard idea of sexiness is generally what makes your skin crawl, your breath heavy, and your hands want to wander. I am writing all of this based on this definition, because it is the definition of what sexiness is to me.    I think it's really important to remember that both guys and girls can be sexy! Of course, every person has their own opinions of what they find to be sexy, but for everyone, something gets their pulse racing. Maybe it's when he's dominant, or maybe it's when he give you that certain look, but I hope you think that your significant other is sexy. Many people find that feeling wanted by their partner is a huge turn on. It kind if gives them the ""wow he/she wants me"" kind of feel. That feel is awesome.     All of that being said, I think that the act of him asking you to learn to be more sexy is hindering it. You might be naturally timid. I'm not entirely sure, because I don't know you, but I know that I was this way. I found my ex boyfriend extraordinarily attractive-- and thus: sexy. However, at the time, I was pretty inexperienced and nervous to try new things. In fact, me getting on top wasn't even an option because it made me so nervous. This prompted him to ask me something along the lines of what your boyfriend ask you. When someone who is already timid is asked to be /more sexy/ they are often times further deterred. They may feel as if what they are doing is not good enough for their partner. In turn, this sacrifices the comfortability with your partner that I mentioned earlier. How are you supposed to be ecstatic to try new things if you're too busy thinking, ""will he like this?""     Being confident / being comfortable with yourself really tie together. You have to be comfortable with yourself to be adventurous. Plus, confidence is super sexy.    On another note, I think it's super inconsiderate that he told you to ""figure it out"". With intimacy, the two partners should be able to talk openly about their communication and their needs being met. While I do think this, I actually see where he is coming from. He might just not feel wanted during sex. He might feel as if the connection is lacking. He might not know any better way to express his feelings. I feel that his asking like this is rude, but is it possible that he's having a difficult time expressing his emotions on the matter?    Okay. I am sorry if this makes very little sense. It is rather late and the memories and feelings I'm trying to describe are rather difficult to explain."

relationship_advice,3dtd7e,zodiak01,11,Sun Jul 19 12:31:14 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd be pissed if my partner said this to me on several levels.  1) The sexy gene/nice girl gene reeks of the Madonna/Whore complex. That's wrong and sexist and unfair, so fuck that noise.  2) The request (order?) to ""be sexier"" (for him) implies that my role is to provide him with entertainment, when it's not. I""m a human adult with needs and wants of my own; sex means sharing, not serving.   3) It's vague and doesn't tell you what he actually means, so it comes off as demeaning and immature.  At best, it's unhelpful.  He needs to learn how to communicate clearly what he wants, or he's never going to get it.  If, as another commenter suggested, he means what women do in porn, he'll likely get burned throughout his lifetime by unrealistic expectations."
relationship_advice,3dtd7e,mandym347,16,Sun Jul 19 08:52:49 2015 UTC,"These young men can be such fools.  I can understand him making the -ahem- request, but then giving no guidance as to what makes his motor run, well, that's just rude, and a couple of other not-genteel things.  I would be angry at his pompous attitude. He's the one asking for ""more"", he could at least make some suggestions.  Fool, if he makes the suggestions the right way, he can compliment you from head to toe, give you some ideas and possibly turn both of you on at the (now gone forever) moment.  Did I pick up on every opportunity in my life? Nope.  But I never once asked a woman to do something for me sexually without making her feel as good as I could about the idea and herself.  Most guys don't get it, and some never do, that if she loves you, she will do all this stuff for you.  Because it makes her happy to see you all turned on and revved up. She may feel silly putting on that much makeup (this poster's thing), or the really high heels, or whatever. But she'll do it more than willingly if you are kind and make her feel more highly valued for doing this, whatever. It becomes a good kind of ""vicious cycle"", where you both keep ""upping the ante"".  I know this can be done.  Everyone ""plateaus"" for a while, but then you try something a little different and boom you're off to the races again.  TL:DR. OP should be angry with bf's cavalier attitude. If it were me I'd shut him off until he asks what's going on, then tell him to ""figure it out"".  Then give him 48 hours to see if he realizes he made a mistake along the way, but as with most guys, he won't know what it is.

As an admitted ""late bloomer"" I can sympathize with the young man under discussion, even empathize. But facts are facts.  It is known that in adolescence, almost all input to the brain is processed through the Prefrontal Cortex.   'The prefrontal cortex, located near the front of the head, is involved in decision making in response to emotions. The Canadian Institutes of Health Research states that the prefrontal cortex controls what decision a person makes when faced with an emotional reaction, and also regulates anxiety"".*   *Source.  This is a function of youth. It is why, for example, when a teen drunk driver loses control of the car he's driving, resulting in the death of his best friend, we sometimes (I have heard young people say it in two different instances) hear one of their friends say, ""He didn't mean to do it, so (he shouldn't be subject to any legal proceedings)"". This is a purely emotional statement, said in all sincerity.  And it has all the validity of a bad fart. When you are issued your license you know the rules of the road, and that speed kills. But kids still die.  It is this lack of experience that trips up the hasty and the unwary.  To get back on topic, when you start a ""situation"" (he makes vague demand for ""more sexy"") off on a false pretense (he and she know what he's talking about with ""more sexy""), you end up in arguments that make no sense whatsoever.   His next move should be ""I'm sorry I was insulting and insensitive. You're plenty sexy for me, I guess I was asking for a change of pace, maybe some hot lingerie, IDK.

That can be really hard to do without coming off like an asshole. It sounds like hes inexperienced in relationships, or at least this subject in general. It doesnt seem like he realizes that EVERYTHING in a relationship is a 2 way street, so if you work on sex he has to work on sex too. This is something you guys can legitimately have fun with. How comfortable are you guys with each other?  By the way, be sure and tell him how you feel. Mention its not fair for him to ask something of you if you dont know what he wants! Psh, girl, you could come up to him with ANY form of spicing things up, what if he doesnt like it? People are very particular about what they want going on in the bedroom. How do you know if he wants a bit of karma sutra or some hardcore toys? Yall need that discussion! Maybe it can be a sexy one. Hell, why dont yall go through a sex position book or sex store together? If he does this he does have to be fair to you, and encouraging.

I don't know what your relationship is like, but basically ours was hitting the 1.5 year mark and we were both reaching a slight lull in the relationship. Like you, I was completely confused and didn't know where to even begin; like your boyfriend, mine couldn't really clarify much about what he meant other than to say that I'm super sweet but just don't really act sexy.   What ended up happening is that I took it as an opportunity to stop being as shy and try to express my sexuality. Bought some new lingerie, was more proactive about telling him when I want him, sent him some flirty texts during the work day, tried to use slightly dirtier language while in the moment. I figured that since he didn't elaborate, I could just do what I want. Long story short he really appreciated my effort and we're doing awesome :)  Was I a little annoyed that he didn't think I wasn't acting sexy enough? Yup.

relationship_advice,3dtd7e,SandJA1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:13:26 2015 UTC,"ask him which porn star he wants you to emulate lmao  seriously, if he wants to make vague demands to be sexier you should ask the same of him. he can't even tell you what he wants. if he wants to spice up the bedroom, that's something you both work on together, not something you alone have to fix. try to figure out exactly what it is he wants and then decide what you want to do from there. cuz ""be sexier"" can mean a lot of different things."

relationship_advice,3dupm6,hopbunnyhop93,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:38:52 2015 UTC,He sounds like a coward. He waited until he was miles away to break up with you. Find a roommate for your new place and be done with him.
relationship_advice,3dupm6,a2freema,2,Sun Jul 19 17:47:07 2015 UTC,"What you should do is move all his stuff into a self-storage, and pay for the first month's rent.  Then you find yourself a roommate, and hug your pets because you know you have them settled.  The next time you talk you him, you tell him that you've already found yourself a roommate, and since he doesn't want to be your boyfriend he can find someplace else to live.  Advise him that all his stuff is in storage and that it's paid up until whatever date.  He's been living out of his suitcase for a couple of months now, so whatever he really need will already be with him.  The good news is that you've had some time by yourself and you know that you can get by perfectly well without him.  I'm sorry, and I know that it hurts hurts hurts.  It will take some time before you're able to be relieved that he's out of your life, but it will happen."

relationship_advice,3dupm6,bladedada,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:52:40 2015 UTC,"I understand your disbelief whilst reading the comments, but they're right, he's a coward. Of course we don't have that lense breaking down the situation for us, so we're woking with what we got. Take some time away from him, and I mean it, literally do that. Deal with your problems, take care of the pets. Then have a conversation with him, make him promise to be completely honest, if he confirms your worries- end it on the spot. If he's still unsure-the best thing would be to end it, but honestly that wouldn't be fair to you, you'd end up feeling like a liability and you two would just grow annoyed at eachother. But if you two get past this phase common to most LDRs, make it work and last. Sorry if I couldn't help. It all comes down to your feelings. Keep us/me posted and best of luck!"

And I'm not going to lie, it's possible he's fallen for someone else, which is a dick move. It's like one of my personal nightmares aswell and it has happened to me, btw. Just make him be honest and tell you the truth and let him know how you feel, don't hide it in the hopes he'll think you're strong enough. Just a simple conversation before coming to conclusions.

The thing about online dating is that people get caught up in it, I call them ""catalogue shoppers"" they talk, meet but just keep on shopping because there is always someone else and so they move on to someone else without really giving you a shot. The grass is always greener on line and it becomes a compulsion.  I notice some switching and delaying etc he could be juggling others, heck  he could have a GF.  He was probably interested but just luke warm about it, I got caught in that as well, if I felt someone was wishy washy luke warm, not into it, not initiating anything I would just stop initiating and almost all the time that would be the end, I would just move on."

You only have one body to carry you through this lifetime. Boyfriends are plentiful. They will come and go, but what use is a boyfriend if your body is deteriorated?

I've always thought he is a good person, but not adhering to treatment is like putting a gun to my temple, and it would be just a matter of probability and time.  Whenever I ask him to make an effort and change, he does it, so we can be good, but what if he only arrives halfway?. I guess that should't be enough.   Thanks a lot.

(I would highly recommend going further than an associate's degree tho because the competition in this field is huge)  Anyway, as you said, commercials are a biggy. There are also: billboards magazines websites (anything on the internet really) product labels and so on.  One that's much more discrete that you may not have noticed is in a movie or TV show. Take the popular TV show family guy for instance, they advertise products all the time. Remember when stewie found his future self? walking down the street perched on his shoulders he said ""it smells like head and shoulders, but you dont have dandruff"" and he replied ""exactly"" ... Well that was marketing.  Ever seen a Macintosh computer in a movie? more marketing  I'm sure there are MANY more obvious and more discrete forms that i'm missing, but as I said, this job market is nearly endless in opportunity"

He is assuming his pace and ignoring yours. Did you put your foot down at all when around his friends? Do you think he planned on putting you on the spot like that? Like you won't say anything because maybe it would be a bad first impression. Maybe he needs to slow down and pay attention to what you are saying.

relationship_advice,3ds9a8,PurplePlurple,14,Sat Jul 18 23:39:04 2015 UTC,Yeah I felt like I've made it really clear that I'm not comfortable. I think his friends could tell I was uncomfortable and confused. Afterwards I explained to him in the car for like 40 min that I haven't been in a relationship in a while and I'm not used to all the attention and it's a lot to handle in three days.. And he just wasn't getting it. And was taking it personally. But my thing is I don't really want to give up on something so quickly just because I'm uncomfortable. I'm not a romantic and I don't believe in love at first sight and he's the opposite of that. So idk. I just feel conflicted.
relationship_advice,3ds9a8,adamdesautel,35,Sat Jul 18 23:47:02 2015 UTC,"What do you like about him? I can't see a single reason you've given as to why you feel you are compatible with this complete nut job. He has serious attachment issues, doesn't respect your boundaries, clearly wants to show you off to his friends, moves way faster than anyone should be, and hasn't told you about something extremely important (the divorce).  At best, he has issues he needs to work on with a therapist. At worst, he's rebounding from his divorce, and is going to latch on to you and never let go, begging you and guilting you into staying with him forever.  Unfortunately, you seem like you aren't that confident in yourself. You list all these red flags in your post, and you still question your own judgement of the situation. You're exactly the type of person who these types of guys can convince to be with him, and I'm not really sure why. I don't mean that as an insult, at all."

Yeah sorry but he's shooting red flags in your direction like a machine gunner. You HAVE to end this because if he's this clingy after 3 days imagine what a real commitment to him is going to feel like. These are the kinds of guys who absolutely GEEK if you hang out with a male friend in a public place or go to the club with the girls.  I would just... I would break it to him but be pretty honest so maybe he has a chance to get his shit together with the next girl. ""Yo, you're moving to fast and it's freaking me out. We barely know each other"".  Brook no room for argument or cajoling. Break it to him via text and go nc if he wants to argue about."
relationship_advice,3ds9a8,PurplePlurple,7,Sun Jul 19 06:09:30 2015 UTC,"It's just because you are uncomfortable, it is because of why you are uncomfortable. Maybe he is just excited, but this is flag worthy behavior - I think you should have an explicit conversation, maybe he is just misunderstanding or maybe he knows you are asking him to back off a little  but he is not respecting that. Him taking it personally could be indicative of a selfish mindset - does he think paying for drinks and being a gentleman entitles him to something with you? I think you should pay attention to where he is coming from.  I can understand being romantic, I fall in love easily and am no stranger to it, but it is really important to have respect. He may be ready to take it to the next level but if he isn't willing to accomodate for how you feel and want you want, if there can't be a balance between the differences in what you two want, then he should consider moving along if it is so important to be this close and this fast - because not everyone is going to want to do that! My second date with my partner, we were down to our underwear and she realized she wanted to wait.  If this guy can't be cool with you then he needs to check his butthurt and accept incompatibility if that's present. Hopefully he can have a genuine and considerate conversation about this and hopefully he's not just thinking of himself! If you are so special, he should be able to put you before him, IMHO, not be a possession. You aren't certain where he stands in all that and I think it adds to your conflicted feeling. I hope you have conviction if he ends up a disrespectful prig! Hopefully he can check himself and own this mistake he is currently making."

He seems to have no idea that you're a person and your wishes matter, so it could be extrapolated that you're being viewed as a tool for his life.   Also, he is keeping his divorce a secret from you.  This has rebound written all over it.

There's way too many red flags here in any case. I'd be straight with him and tell him he came on way too strong, he blew it."
relationship_advice,3ds9a8,candyuniverse,4,Sun Jul 19 06:07:16 2015 UTC,"Am I wrong that he's doing it all too much too soon?   If this is really your only question, the answer is no, you are not wrong. He is crazytown, and you do not want any part of this. Even if it were excusable to be this forward so quickly, and with no reciprocation from you, you repeatedly told him to slow down, and he ignored your wishes. That shows a complete lack of respect for your boundaries, as does several other things you mentioned in your post.  Your instincts are correct; trust them."
relationship_advice,3ds9a8,yourhouseitssideways,4,Sun Jul 19 00:18:42 2015 UTC,Honestly this seems really sketchy.  Did he start messaging you on fb? He's trying to woo you. He had a divorce he hasn't mentioned. His friends noticed you were uneasy and they didn't say anything. Maybe you're not the first girl he has done this with and they are just used to it or don't want to get in the way. This sounds like he is after you for some reason and its not in your best interest. He sounds like a emotional vampire. He is planning on using you for something. Losing him will be better than what ever he will wreck you with.

relationship_advice,3ds9a8,vazbloke,5,Sun Jul 19 04:27:27 2015 UTC,"So many red flags!  My real advice is to end this. You don't ""owe"" him an explanation as to why.   If you really thought that some over possessive, pushy man two months out of a marriage is worth giving a chance, you could tell him, firmly ""I am not YOURS. Furthermore, we have known each other a total of three days, and have spent __ hours together. We need to act accordingly. Things have been moving too fast for me, and if you don't take a huge step back and slow things down, I am not interested in anything more with you"""
relationship_advice,3ds9a8,CoachJMcGuirk,3,Sun Jul 19 01:52:31 2015 UTC,"Oh man. Seems like this guy is desperately trying to fill the hole that his ex-wife left. The fact that he's moving so fast and has just assumed that you were on board is a little disconcerting, plus this:   texts me that he just want me to be ""his.""   My sister recently broke up with someone who said this to her, and he acted just like your dude (except he got out of a long-term relationship instead of a marriage). One month into knowing her, he told her he loved her. Two months later, he asked if she could talk to her counselor about graduating early so she could ""start their life together"" in the town that he lived in.  Long story short, he cheated on her and when she tried to break up with him, he said all these things about how he ""didn't like to lose"" and basically equated her to a possession or ""trophy."" Plus a ton of other manipulative things, including guilt-tripping her for paying for all of her meals and drinks when they went out on dates.  I'm not saying this guy will cheat on you or treat you like a trophy, but the rate at which he's moving shows that he's not completely grounded in reality. Usually, there's some sort of conversation about where you're at in a relationship. Sometimes, you and the person you're dating just know it implicitly, but definitely not after 3 days. He's probably just used to acting like this because he was married and maybe he doesn't quite remember how to act in the beginning of a relationship, but it's still weird to me that he's ignoring your request of taking things slow."

You are paying for the emotional baggage he is carrying around. Maybe his ex told him he wasn't affectionate enough and he is now taking that to extremes. He is probably having some real abandonment issues and over-compensating for that as well.   There are just so many red flags for me here: not telling you about the recent divorce, showing you off in a very public way to his friends, pushing for so much so fast, that I would be extremely wary of continuing with him at all. He is clearly still in a really emotionally needy place, and I feel like you are becoming his ""in your face"" response to his ex."

Or you did something off putting afterwards.   BTW - there is no such thing as a friend zone. Someone is into you, or they aren't, but they still like you. No one owes you a sexual relationship just because they like you as a person. You can accept her friendship or you can reject it, the same way as she can accept your advances or not.   Or you could just be an adult and ask her if she's interested in you like that, instead of reading into every single thing you're hearing from 3rd parties."

Too bad, not your choice. When it DOES become friend zoning is when she knows you like her but tries to be your friend. You have to advocate for yourself. You need to be straight up with your intentions and feelings, or it is like a never ending chess game where you loose no matter what in the end. She begged her friend to come with? Maybe she is socially awkward because she likes you, or maybe it is because she thinks you are creepy but she doesn't want to blow you off.

Does he show you in other ways? Do you at least feel loved? My boyfriend has trouble saying it, because he's admitted that he's bad at expressing emotion-- but he makes sure I feel loved.  If having him say 'I love you' to you, before you guys get engaged, is something you need and is really important to you (and it's totally valid! Some people need that verbal affirmation of love), then that's something you need to express to him. He might not realize how much you need to hear that, or that him holding back his feelings is hurting you.  Have you guys talked about getting engaged?

He shows that he loves me in every tiny action...which is so much more important in the long run. But I am craving the verbal affirmation of it and I am not used to this feeling of needing to hear it. If he doesn't want to actually say those words...then you would think we could compromise to us having a code word. I just want more verbal recognition of his feelings. I absolutely see him as a part of my future and marrying him. We discuss the future quite a bit and make subtle hints about it all the time in conversation...even in front of each other's families.

I sure as shit would not agree to marry someone who never admitted they loved me.

relationship_advice,3duicg,my_tamagotchi_died,4,Sun Jul 19 17:21:32 2015 UTC,"Run the risks of your nudes being leaked, it doesn't matter as much as your safety and wellbeing. Publicize his actions and let public pressure crush him. Its normal for a couple to exchange erotic content, most couples have that phase and it should be understandable. If you come clear on every angle (including nudes, any promiscuity that happened in the relationship, basically anything that might make you look bad) you will be able to stay one step ahead.  The key point is being one step ahead- yes it might be hard to announce your wrongdoings to the world (if theres anything more than the photos) but its the approach that matters, ill use this example post. ""x has pushed me too far, yes I've given him x and y and have done x and y and I really regret doing it but its come too far, and ill risk his threats of x and y to get away from his abuse""  This requires careful orchestration to protect your reputation whilst defending from probable attacks on your character from your x, its crucial that you think ahead of what he is thinking and create a buffer for it, example: Nudes? announce beforehand that he's pressuring you with blackmail and threats. Slander? predict absolutely everything he could possibly say and sincerely apologize beforehand (people can pick up on fake apologies so I'm talking really sincere), Threats? Document everything alongside blackmail.  As far as the execution goes there are many variables but its good to start thinking about it now. Check to see if you have enough evidence of blackmail to charge him and if not, document everything he says. Stay clear away from him and do not approach him during the execution because he will retaliate.   lastly, document document document everything. DO NOT instigate anything, stay nice and frosty and if he looses his cook and drops scary threats, don't worry, document document document, and if your lucky enough to get him to actually react, call the cops and throw him in a holding cell for the night. you got this."

relationship_advice,3duicg,zanzabaarr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:57:57 2015 UTC,"its alright, this seems more serious than i thought and you seem like your desperate to leave. Be professional with this, and don't give in.   Every single text, letter, video, audio of everything he does should be documented. Your responses should be carefully coordinated to protect yourself and control the situation. Think business like, respond professionally. If your going to give text evidence you must be careful about your responses.  Do not under any circumstances initiate the separation with-ought having a plan that covers every angle. If you initiate the plan with him, out and about or not in a relatively secure area. You might be wondering why i want to help you so much and its because I've helped a close friend with a similar scenario except she got too exited and told her ex out of spite what she was going to do and it got bad fast, regardless shes with someone safer.  After your in have a safe place, and your prepared to tell everyone what your going to do (a simple breakup really) and your sure that theres no way he can get near you for the next couple days then you can start, but that doesn't mean its over. The probability of him retaliating is almost guaranteed.  This is where a professional attitude is crucial. Most likely he will text you like crazy and call you like crazy and he could even pursue you. From that point onward document every single text that arrives from him- and i literally mean take screenshots from your phone of the whole conversation as it develops. Your duty is to respond as little as possible and wait for his inevitable mistakes.  What your looking for is (if he doesn't back down of course) is threats of any kind, any incriminating evidence and any sort of stalker-like surveillance to document. This can be used to support you and if it comes to a climax will assist you with getting a restraining order."

You can get caught in a trap of catering to him, trying to fill a bottomless pit. But he’s not so much needy as entitled, so no matter how much you give him, it will never be enough. He will just keep coming up with more demands because he believes his needs are your responsibility, until you feel drained down to nothing.""  ""Changing his moods abruptly and frequently, so that you find it difficult to tell who he is or how he feels, keeping you constantly off balance. His feelings toward you are especially changeable.""  ""Denying the obvious about what he is doing or feeling. He’ll speak to you with his voice trembling with anger, or he’ll blame a difficulty on you, or he’ll sulk for two hours, and then deny it to your face. You know what he did— and so does he— but he refuses to admit it, which can drive you crazy with frustration. Then he may call you irrational for getting so upset by his denial.""  ""Control is exercised through wearing the woman down with constant low-level complaints.""  ""It is important not to underestimate the impact of these kinds of day-to-day decisions. Your happiness in a relationship depends greatly on your ability to get your needs heard and taken seriously. If these decisions are taken over by an abusive or controlling partner, you experience disappointment after disappointment, the constant sacrificing of your needs. He, on the other hand, enjoys the luxury of a relationship where he rarely has to compromise, gets to do the things he enjoys, and skips the rest. He shows off his generosity when the stakes are low, so that friends will see what a swell guy he is. The abuser ends up with the benefits of being in an intimate relationship without the sacrifices that normally come with the territory. That’s a pretty privileged lifestyle.""

His behavior is absolutely irrational and unacceptable, and he either needs to seek help in correcting it, or you need to seek a new boyfriend.   I mean, come on. It's not going to get better on its own. It'll only get worse. He'll get angry and twist your perfectly innocent interactions with people more often and to greater degrees. Think about how awful and frustrating this situation was. Do you want to keep going through that day after day after day?  You know that even if you manage to completely stop even acknowledging that other men exist - no talking, smiling, or even looking at them - it won't even matter, as he'll accuse you of flirting with them anyways?  Do you want to live the rest of your life like that?  Because that is what it will come down to if you just try to ""deal with it"" on your own. It's impossible."

If you're not happy in this relationship because of these issues, have voiced your unhappiness to her and asked her to work on it, and she continues to make you feel like crap when this happens, that's a major problem.  Plus. Let's be honest. You've been together for 3 years since she was 19 and you were 22. You've been on again/off again. She moved in not because you really wanted her to, but because she needed to. Maybe not the best of ideas, but you did it because you care for her.   Well maybe it's time to put yourself first again? Tell her - 'hey, look. We've talked about this before. I can't keep dealing with it. I know I have issues too, but this particular thing is something that I have major problems with. If it continues, I can't keep living with you..'.

See here is the thing, you feel love for her and hey maybe in some way she loves you but my friend what you are getting are scraps of love at a cost of a huge amount of pain and destruction.  I would not hold your breath waiting for an apology, is she even that self-aware to belive she did anything wrong ?  So of course you feel love for her and it would be tough, it sounds to me like your stuck in a hole being tormented and just cant get the energy together to push yourself out of the hole. That is no excuse, your not going to make your life better just by sitting around grumbling on Reddit.  And of course there will be drama and she will freak out like some wild cat freaking out clawing at you but once you get her out the door and close it you will undoubtedly be sad, grieve for a while but you will have peace and calm in your life and will be relieved."

But let's say you guys work it all out. What's the point? Where do you think it will lead? Kids? Marriage? 5 kids from 3 baby daddies that what happens here in the US. What incentive do women have to be with just one man when she can collect a check from each of you? More and more government benefits and food stamps for each child? And now counties are tacking the cost of those benefits onto the male in addition to the child support you owe.  I tell my sons find a woman who's in her 30's 40's alimony and child support coming in from the ex(s), just wants to have fun and won't pressure you into children and marriage like the young ones do until it's game over for you, the threat of jail time if you can't pay your child support. But yeah, a woman with her tubes tied bro is a major bonus. Puberty is the beginning of the end. Stay with your parents and forget about growing up. It's overrated. There's no reward for the family man. It's a life of slavery. So I ask you. Do you really want this relationship to carry on?"

If she assumes you mean that she's dumb simply by disagreeing on a topic, that makes me think she's prone to feeling ""dumb"" in comparison to others. If you decide to stay with her, that might be something you could work on together. Tell her that intelligent people have different opinions all the time, that you like hearing her opinions, and that it's interesting to have a friendly debate. If it turns out that isn't something she enjoys at all and it is something you enjoy that could be a dealbreaker too, though."

relationship_advice,3dutx5,a2freema,2,Sun Jul 19 19:26:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think she's crazy, but it definitely sounds like she is a very insecure person. Getting upset when you don't text back right away, not being okay with not seeing you for a day, etc. are not signs of a healthy relationship.  However, you've only been together for 2 months and perhaps it's her first relationship too. I would say: Just give it some time and see if she starts to feel more confident in the relationship. But do communicate with her about needing some alone time. It sounds cliche, but set your boundaries now. Let her know you want to be able to discuss these things like adults."

relationship_advice,3dutx5,ilikeno,4,Sun Jul 19 19:02:24 2015 UTC,"Different people need different things from relationships. This seems simple, but it's hard to learn.  You've got limited time. You're working, you're out of school, you've got responsibilities. It should be obvious to her that you care about her because you spend so much time with her. Instead all she sees is the time when you're not with her.  If she can't let you have time to yourself, to get things done, then how will this relationship continue? Do you text her at work? You might want to try to stop encouraging that so much. Maybe try to wean her off so to speak.  She seems very dependant on you for validation. A well adjusted person doesn't get so upset if they don't receive a reply every 15 minutes.  Try talking with her, if she doesn't work on it, then you should probably break up."

And he chose to leave, and punctuated it by severing social connections with you. Non-verbal communication is still communication. If he wanted to do a formal declaration of ""it's over"", then he had the opportunity to express that but he chose the passive-aggressive route instead. Not you problem.  As for the stuff, is there anything you reaaaally need from him? If it's not important and irreplacable it may be best to write those off. Maybe give it a month for him to cool down and see if he wants to exchange things, and if he still is NC with you then ship his stuff to Goodwill or something."

I was a special Ed preschool teacher and he was a sports guy who loved kids. I had been seeing someone else for about a year (who was better off as a friend and we were just putting off breaking up until I moved away from the state, but once I realized I was staying, we almost immediately broke up) so Jack wasn't really on my radar until that ended. Near the end of the season we joked about having a coaches night out at a new beer garden - but the 3rd coach bailed so it was just the two of us. About halfway through that night I realized that this guy was funnier and cuter than I had realized, and it kinda felt like a date.   We started hanging out several times a week. After only a few weeks of this, I find out that he's driving up to CT to see his family and move more of his belongings down. I joke that I have friends in CT and a week to kill between jobs and, in an act of blind faith, decide to book a flight up to CT to meet him to drive back. We spend 3 days with his family, stop in VA and spend 2 days with my sisters (and my parents for a few hours), and make it back to FL without killing each other (in all honesty it was 95% a wonderful trip).   We spent the next two months hanging out at the beach, our houses, meeting new and old friends, talking about anything and everything, and laughing constantly. He flew up to VA with me for my childhood friend's wedding, which was kind of lame, but we made our own fun and had a great time. He also got along reallyywell with my dad. Then reality starts to set in. Jack is supposed to start grad school on the other coast of FL in mid-August. We have been seeing each other less than 3 months but it has been so wonderful and we are so compatible.   I am usually an EXTREMELY indecisive person, weighing the pros and cons of something until my head hurts, and often doubting my decision even after I've made it. Trying to maximize my actions for ultimate happiness (taking into consideration logic/reason) for all those involved. My plan for the coming year was to take prerequisite classes at the local college to apply for a Physical Therapy degree, and find a shitty job to pay the bills in the meantime. I went back and forth in my head and then decided - FUCK IT, I can do those things anywhere. I am a highly educated, wildly independent and self sufficient woman, and I want to take a chance on this man I could see myself with for the rest of my life.   I have already registered for classes in the fall and we are currently apartment hunting. My relationship is great :)"

relationship_advice,3dty2t,l0veandwar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:27:26 2015 UTC,"I just recently ended a long distance relationship. We had one more month to go before I went back but even back in the US we would be in a minor long distance. Here is a post explaining the details.  Anyway, he recently messaged me and kept asking me all kinds of questions. He seemed to take it smoothly and said he understood when I dumped him on skype. But I guess this is part of him trying to process the breakup. It's really bothering me though because I just want to close that chapter and I thought we did it effortlessly. He wanted to get lunch with me after I get back but I told him we can do coffee but I won't change my mind. I prefer not seeing him at all and I would told him that he shouldn't be talking to me because all I want for him is to move on. We were only together for 7 months and out of those 4 months were minor long distance.  I just want a clean slate. Is this cruel?"

relationship_advice,3dty2t,CollegeKidWithQs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:29:09 2015 UTC,"So here's the deal- I am currently 20 years old and my boyfriend is 22. We met last year at the same university, started dating, and almost a year later we are still madly in love with each other- I think. We had to do long distance for the first two months of the summer, but it has made our relationship even stronger than ever. We got in a really big fight and ended up working through it and are in an even better place than I could've ever imagined. If we can get through a fight and come out stronger than before even when we are 2,000 miles apart, I don't take that lightly. We are also both very open and honest with each other and absolutely do not believe in cheating. We agreed that if we ever want other things or feel that we are no longer right for each other, we will break up before we cheat. Obviously, things can happen. I am extremely conflicted because I have contemplated cheating. Not with just anyone, but I have contemplated taking part in a ""sugar baby/sugar daddy arrangement."" I have never cheated on anyone and do not condone it for any reason. I never thought I would ever contemplate, but I am. Let me explain before you condemn me to hell. I am a struggling college student. My father (the breadwinner) died a few years ago and ever since then my mother, older brother, and I have really been struggling. We make ends meet and I have worked multiple jobs to take the stress off of my mother, but sometimes it just is not enough. My boyfriend comes from a very wealthy family and frankly it is really difficult for me to accept him constantly paying for me. He graduated this past year and got a pretty good job that makes around $50,000/yr. When my father was alive, you could say we were very wealthy. He made around $250,000 a year, but my mother only made about 50. The problem is, they never saved and spent the money very recklessly. Instead of investing in college, my brother and I would be at Nordstrom every weekend. I was raised to never speak about money because that came off as tacky and rude, so my boyfriend doesn't know how bad it really is. He assumes that because I dress really well, I somehow afford my sorority, and never complain about money that everything is fine. Meanwhile it really is not, my mom can barely pay for my monthly expenses and all of the money I make from my jobs is not enough to pay my apartment rent, utilities, student loans, groceries, etc. I am drowning in student loans because the university I currently go to is about $30,000 a year (in-state). Of course, I had to take out just about the full amount the past three years because FAFSA says that my mom's salary is sufficient enough to pay for school. I am nowhere near living in a cardboard box- but I also am far from living the life I want to live. I am in a sorority and it is extremely difficult to see my best friends drive brand new Range Rovers and buy a new David Yurman ring on a whim. I know I will be making my own money next year but I have seriously contemplated getting a sugar daddy in order to pay off my school bills and then some. Here is where I am completely confused. There are times when I really think that my boyfriend is the love of my life. Seriously. We both hooked up with other people in college prior to meeting, however, we are both each other's first serious relationship- and we both always talk about how we want it to be our last. I was never one to date around and really only ever took part in a drunken hookup with a frat boy I had been flirting with that were few and far between. When I started dating my current boyfriend, I had some doubts because I thought it was too good to be true. He is everything I have ever wanted in a man, and then some. He treats me like a princess and I truly trust him too. We are wildly attracted to each other, have a great sex life, but are also best friends. I feel like every aspect in our relationship is extremely rare to have to the extent that we have it, but I just don't know if he is actually the one. How could I even fathom taking part in a secret most-likely sex for money scenario if I truly love this man and want to spend the rest of my life with him. I have even signed up for seekingarrangement.com just to see what the deal was. I get moments where I think about it again and literally become terrified at the thought of having sex with a stranger but some of these men have offered to pay me upwards of $4,000 a month to go on a few dates and have a mutually beneficial relationship a few times a month. The thing is I only want the money so I can use it to get rid of my student debt so if I ever get married to my current boyfriend it is not a burden on our bills or if we want to have a big wedding, etc. I also want to be able to buy him gifts and take him out to dinner and give him everything that he deserves. I really need advice because I am at the point of wondering whether I am just the most ungrateful disgusting human being out there that is capable of cheating on her perfect boyfriend for money, or whatever the other option is. Is contemplating something like this a sign that he is not the one? What does thinking about doing something so desperate like that for money say about me? I'm just kind of lost and would appreciate some feedback."

relationship_advice,3dwhob,oling27,15,Mon Jul 20 03:10:24 2015 UTC,"Why should you convince her not to get assault charges filed against you? What you did to her was assault. These charges should be filed against you. As for your original question, you don't need to apologize to her. You need to stay away from her."
relationship_advice,3dwhob,crazylostunreal,15,Mon Jul 20 03:21:11 2015 UTC,"Dude, seriously? You cheated on her, called her a slut because she says you drink too much, hit her, and now you want to apologize and make everything better? Not gonna happen. Don't talk to her, and since you did assault her, you definitely shouldn't even consider talking to her, let alone trying to convince her not to file assault charges on you. Jfc."
relationship_advice,3dwhob,Congzilla,7,Mon Jul 20 03:37:43 2015 UTC,Sure if you want to catch another charge for intimidating a witness.  Most likely you will have a warrant out for you by the end of the day if she pressed charges yesterday.  Even if she didn't the DA can anyway if they think there is enough evidence.  It just takes a few more days for the warrant to go out.

Now I think in this situation not to read into it, some people are just really bad at knowing how to help in this situation. In fact this was nearly word for word how I dealt with my partners mothers death.   I didn't see him during the period at all and all communication was over the phone. I said 'that sucks ' because everything else sounded trite and fake. I didn't initiate conversations because I didn't want to make such a difficult time about me. I stopped answering during conversations because I honestly had no idea how to frame a reply.  The part he didn't see? Me sat at home clutching my phone running through every conversation in my head unable to find the 'perfect' thing to say. Me hurting desperately for him and sobbing because I felt so useless. Chances are he doesn't initiate anything because he don't want to push you in any way. Talk to him, tell him what you need. And not via text, at least a phone call."

relationship_advice,3dt7f9,PreviouslySaydrah,2,Tue Jul 21 11:35:10 2015 UTC,"I am going to be real with you because I am a son who owes his being alive to his mother. My mother is the reason why I am who I am today. I can relate to you in your grief in so many ways. I too would feel as if my world was crumbling if my mother died. If you need someone to talk to I am more then willing.   To be honest I can relate to your emotions on such a deep level I am having issues with giving you advice about your boyfriend. The advice is very simple, but I feel your emotional distress is more important. So to get that part of my advice out of the way, here we go. Your boyfriend is not connected to you on similar emotional levels as it relates to how close you are with your family. If you have explained this to him and he still does not care, that is a red flag. I do not know very much about him, but I would personally handle the situation completely differently. Family is the one thing you can't replace in life.  Onto what I think is more important. Your mental and emotional state are making me think you may be in a form of shock. I know I would be. I would highly suggest you find a friend or someone you can confide in to help you deal with this insurmountable amount of new stress you are dealing with. If you are able to, find a psychiatrist. You NEED to find someone to talk to. I can understand how you feeling as ""the rock"" of your family prevents you from wanting to talk to them.   I commend you for coming on here despite your grief and seeking advice. I want to help you with all my heart and hope some of my advice has done just that. And please know that I am willing to sit and talk with you IF you are comfortable with it. There are thankfully ways to Privately converse on these forums, so don't hesitate to message me.  I will be praying for you.  Kind regards,  Justin Dunkin"
relationship_advice,3dt7f9,Baial,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:17:43 2015 UTC,"Hi Justin,  Thank you SO MUCH for your kind message. It honestly means a lot when a stranger tells me that I can talk to them because I haven't been able to find comfort in any of my friends. I am not sure why I don't feel able to share any of my grief with them. I feel like I am completely unable to process anything that has happened. My brain feels like it has shut down any emotional side. Right now all I can think of is what to do next to help my family. So when my friends ask me how I'm feeling, I say ""fine"" and the conversation moves on. I appreciate your reply so much. I'll definitely reach out if I feel unable to cope."
relationship_advice,3dt7f9,griffincorg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:41:04 2015 UTC,"Most people suck at dealing with death & dealing with how when others are experiencing a death, their whole world for a little while is consumed by grief. As much as most people understand intellectually that when you lose a parent you can't just ""get over it,"" when they are not grieving themselves, they find it draining and uncomfortable to interact with your grief.   Being good at dealing with others' grief requires: Either a personality predisposed to this skill naturally, or professional training and a support system of one's own to avoid being vicariously traumatized. It sounds like he has neither of these.   You have a choice to make here--you could accept that the partner you have is not good at dealing with grief, and seek your support from friends and a grief counselor/support group for those who've lost a parent. Or, you could decide this is a dealbreaker and end the relationship and seek a partner who does have this skill either naturally or as a learned thing. But don't think of it as a personality flaw in him, just think of it as a skill you feel your partner should have that he doesn't have.  You might find the order of the good death helpful in dealing with the burial, by the way. Caitlin Dougherty, a licensed mortician, has set up a whole website and online community around the idea that it is best when dealing with death that the family care for the unembalmed body before burial or cremation, as people did for thousands of years before embalming became possible. There are many stories on the website about people who have gotten through this experience and found it helped to start the healing process."

I agree with the website that you sent but I think I just wasn't strong enough to take part in any of the ritualistic cremation activities.

relationship_advice,3dt7f9,Reek138,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:00:55 2015 UTC,"Hi OP,  First off, I want to say I'm deeply sorry for what you are going through. My condolences to you and your family.  As the other people have pointed out, sometimes there are people who do not know how to handle with these death situations. My suggestion would be to talk to your bf face to face and let him know that you don't feel like he is being emotionally supportive. Not to go off on a tangent, but when my grandfather passed away, I admit that I was not there for his funeral because the thought of seeing my grandpa (who I didn't get to see often since he lived in another country) in a coffin just freaked me out. My younger cousin stopped by the US couple of years later and we were drinking and he asked me why I didn't show up for the funeral. I explained to him my reasoning and that it also helped to make me think that my grandpa was still around even though he really isn't..I really didn't know how I would be able to handle it.  My father also passed away really recently (about 3-4 months ago). Most of my friends and girlfriend also don't know how to really console me even though the wounds are still really fresh. The first month or so, they were supportive, but after a while, they just go back to living their lives and they don't really understand what you are going through on a daily basis. The truth is, the world keeps moving even though it feels like your world is crumbling.  Definitely confront him and tell him what you are going through. Tell him what you need during this rough time..whether you just need someone to talk to, someone to listen, someone to help out with the funeral etc. Tell him exactly and clearly why you felt bothered by his responses and see how he answers and where his priorities are."
relationship_advice,3dt7f9,Branfip81,2,Sun Jul 19 15:47:33 2015 UTC,Hi.. I want you to know that the time you spent answering a stranger's plea was very very appreciated. Your message helped me through one of the most difficult days of my life. I could especially relate to what you said because I refused to see my mom once she passed away. It was the exact same reasoning as yours. Just seeing her like that was something that was too much for me to emotionally handle and it would maybe allow me to not wholly realize that she is no more.
relationship_advice,3dt7f9,PreviouslySaydrah,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:13:49 2015 UTC,"OP, I know even though we are strangers, please do not hesitate to ask for any advice or just even feel free to vent. It is truly a struggle, I understand and empathize with you. Though I do not realize the extent of the Hindu culture with handling funerals, I do believe it is best to be there with you and your family (especially if you have other siblings) and to get to speak your final words to your mother. It will help a lot spiritually..plus, you do not want to regret later on with words you did not get to say to her before her body is laid to rest. I had my father cremated and still speak to him from time to time when I visit his grave, but speaking at the wake/funeral relieved my burden a lot more.  I don't know if your mother had a job and had a will etc. but these things can be handled later on. Please do take things a step at a time and be strong for your dad. :)  Talk to him from time to time since he is the most vulnerable right now (he lost his life partner). Sending you hugs and support."

The good news is, you already know the answer to the latter:   My fiancé always tells me he loves my body the way it is and that he thinks I'm beautiful no matter what I weigh.    which leaves the former. You had a baby 5 months ago. Dude, cut yourself some slack - when my baby was 5 months old I struggled to put my pants on some days, ever mind go jogging. Start changing the way you eat and when you have some time/energy, increase your exercise to go along with that.    I feel like I have to do anything I can to drastically to lose this weight just so I don't need to worry about the way he thinks of me.   Drastic isn't healthy, and you owe it to yourself and your baby to be healthy. You know what he thinks of you. Is he a liar? Has he given you any reason to believe he's not telling you the truth when he says he thinks you're beautiful? If not, then stop putting this on him, and accept it's about how you feel about you.   So, you can make this a team thing. Tell your dude you want to start eating healthier - start cooking new things together.

I simply wanted to hang out alone for a bit before bed and he wanted to go to sleep together. It's a big deal for him and was for me in my first relationship but not so much anymore.  Our major conflicts essentially all stem from either of us drinking. I'd say all our issues outside of disagreements while drinking are resolved fine.   The biggest thing that comes up with either of us drinks is I have a tendency to be extremely calloused because I don't want to deal with the argument. He has a tendency to become emotional and feel distanced or rejected if he drinks. Put one of us drinking and it pretty much implies something to disagree over.   So I've decided to work on my moderation and it worked out last night. He on the other hand compensated by getting drunk.  Aside from the issues that stem from drinking our relationship is good in other regards. So while I was frustrated at the disagreement last night when I posted, I'm feeling we can work this out as long as we set some hard rules about what we can and can't do while drunk. We've already established no sex after drinking and no disagreements after drinking, and if they arise to talk about it sober.  He's coming over tonight to talk about it and he did apologize. So I feel better about it today. I know I set a bad example in the recent past so I'm trying to remedy that. But him doing this doesn't help the situation.   The whole irony to this situation is I was him in my first relationship. I can definitely see that now and am taking steps to remedy that. But otherwise I still love him and want to work at it. I don't think it's to the point we need to a see a professional. We get along and are able to remedy our disagreements sober."

I wonder if your applying too much logic here, your headline was curious ""is a break up necessary"" as if that is a logical outcome ? Also I disagree with the ""any attempt to fix it will only result in being more hurt than we are now"" it is faultly logic to begin with and really just giving up too quickly, it sounds like something a logical person would say.  A break up is not neccessary, you can always ask for another chance. A break up is not a logical descsion, I can tell that you are trying to be logical about this and yet for you this is really not done, you dont feel it in your heart. I personally have had this habit of giving it a second shot, most of the time it did not work out but there are two reasons its was a good idea, firstly it mostly did not work out and yet on one occasion it did work out and it was great. The second thing is that they were serious relationships and deserve the preserverence to work it out and perhaps the most important thing is that when the second chances did not work out I truly knew in my heart that it was over and I felt good that I did everything I could to make it work.  Of course you can suggest a second chance but  he/she may say no anyway.  Also I have to say it sounds to me that ""any attempt to try and fix it will eventually result in one of us being hurt more than we are now"" sounds like something said by someone who has already completely made up their mind and is saying this idiotic statement to close things off, it short circuits the process."

What I always think when I hear someone being so logical in these kinds of situations is that they have made the emotional decision and have then moved to being logical.  What I find often happens is that you have an awkward and difficult  discussion when discussing getting back together but then when you say yes there is a sudden good, positive emotion caused by relief of getting back together, this is often followed by ""make up sex"" where the passions and emotions are intense. Unless you have resolved some issues in the discussion in getting back together you still have to face the issues to deal with, this is the difficult part. But I would assume there is a willingness to work at these issues and resolve them.  I think you said you are boyfriend and GirlFriend but if you have been together for a while and your serious about your relationship you can go to a marriage counsellor (you dont have to be married to go to one) it can be very helpful in terms of resolving communication issues and its also a constructive step you can take.  Often people will say they will work on the relationship or they will change but just fall back into their old ways quickly. I might also add that you can learn allot about yourself and so going to a counsellor may help you in future relationships if this one does not work out.  The last thing I would say is that there needs to be a willingness in both parties to work on your relationship. Personally in one situation I have broken up with someone, they begged me to come back, I outlined what I felt was wrong and what I needed from them, they said ok but when we did get back together they blamed me for all the issues and never respected any of my requests.  Actuallly in another case when i broke up with them I had issues with them and I had huge regrets so I was the one that begged to come back. But when we reconciled it was much worse because they did nothing and blamed me for the breakup and never forgave me for it so it was far worse so I had no choice but to leave for good and I had no regrets because I tried.  I hope that helps"

Yeah she drank alcohol but that doesn't make her the bad guy here. Sure she got into a cab with a guy she may have not have really known, but that doesn't mean she was asking for anything. The bad guy is the ass hole who was probably more sober than her and still trying to push his nasty self on her and the ass hole of a cab driver that didn't kick his sorry ass to the curb.   Second, you seem to be complaining about her telling you a few hours after the event happened. Do you realize how much courage it probably took her to say anything to you? Yet here you are seeming put off by that and by the fact that she does not want to relive that experience with police officers and go through another trauma?   Her sexual assault is not a red flag, but your lack of support is."

You would feel so humiliated and less of a man. Why dont you support her? Go to some classes with her? I hope she realizes what an ass you are and leaves you. No sympathy at all. Just because you go out drinking doesn't mean you deserve that. Just because she doesn't want to go to the cops doesn't mean squat either. Do you think she wants to relive this over and over? Go to trial and tell 12 strangers about what happened if it went that far. And her boyfriend can't even be supportive. He thinks she deserved it because she was drinking? I feel so sorry for her, I hope you let her move on and find somebody who would support her 100%"

They pretend to go through the motions until they are married, and then stop doing it at all. If you have tried repeatedly to help her and talk to her and response is a resounding ""I don't care"" you need to start hearing what she is actually saying. Personally I wouldn't want to marry someone who has so little interest in me or being with me."
relationship_advice,3dtgg2,katorulestheworld,2,Sun Jul 19 11:38:01 2015 UTC,"Well she's a mess of self-esteem and control issues, and you guys have fairly poor communication dynamics it looks like. But the problem mainly lies in her court. She needs to address her own emotional issues so she can be functional in a relationship, which probably feed into the sex issues too.  But if she's withdrawn and disengaged from working on herself or the relationship you're kind of at a dead end. It is emotionally draining to constantly play partner and therapist just like you expressed in your post, and unless she bites the bullet and goes to couples and/or personal therapy this is going to be a very miserable life for you.  I personally would not consider marrying into such a troubled relationship, that ring is only going to make things worse --never better."

But i understand the stress that she feels ( she needs to get a scholarship as her family is not that well off ; they can afford it but she'd rather they not have to pay for it ) and i remind myself this every night.  I've been controlling my 'desires' quite well for months so i just wanna know if there's a way or i could wait 3 more months!   Thanks for your advice though i will keep them in mind :)

It's wise to be careful of morbid jokes if you aren't certain that you're not around someone who gets especially wounded by them.   If you're ruling out ending the relationship over this, give him a couple days and then just say, ""Look, we need to talk about what happened when Rob was over. My impression of what happened is that I made a morbid joke about myself and Rob called me a name and walked out, then the two of you gave me the silent treatment.

relationship_advice,3dr8dd,premedonna,2,Sun Jul 19 01:17:15 2015 UTC,I can talk to you too! I have had experiences like this. You are so young and so many nice guys are out there. Don't settle for an asshole. You really deserve better.
relationship_advice,3dr8dd,premedonna,2,Sun Jul 19 01:18:08 2015 UTC,"He disrespected your agreement to stay away from D and J. He has blocked you on IG so he doesn't get shit from you that's he's smoking a lot even though he said he'd ""maybe"" smoke a little. He has a secret kik account and wants to engage in dirty convo with girls and wanted to hit on some religious girls. He gets furious at you for a picture of you in an oversized shirt and assumes the worst of you... Where's the trust? You say he hasn't cheated on you but with the way his behavior is going it's only a matter of time.   It seems to me that he's keeping you around as an option until he finds someone else. I know you want to salvage this relationship but it looks like you're the only one willing to do so and I think you deserve better than that."
relationship_advice,3dr8dd,yourhouseitssideways,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:41:47 2015 UTC,He waited 2+ years before we finally got together so it's kind of hard to believe he'd just keep me around waiting for another girl to come along. I really hate him for all of this. Sometimes he tries to be great and then other times it's just like he doesn't give a crap. This is the latter.

relationship_advice,3dq99u,01ninas,114,Sat Jul 18 11:50:49 2015 UTC,"As another respondent pointed out to you, he's not your boyfriend, he's your ex.  The fact that you can't even bring yourself to use that terminology means that you're in denial.  That's okay, it's the first step in the grief cycle, but you do need to recognize what you're doing and start moving on from it because that is what is best for you.  Secondly, talking to your ex is hurting you.  It is allowing you to deny the reality that you are broken up, and while I know it feels better than the reality, it's something you have to stop.  Also, knowing so many details about his post-breakup life is hurting you.  Why are you doing this to yourself?  Why do you need to know how many women he's slept with?  It's time for boundaries.  As for attributing his behavior to a suspected mental illness (true or not), that's another way for you to stay in denial.  Truth is, it doesn't matter why he broke up with you and is acting like he is, just that he did it.  Even if he does have a mental illness, that's not your problem anymore.  You are broken up, and it's time to care more for yourself than you do for him.  Take care of you and stop trying to take care of him.    You may not admit it, but your caretaking here is being done in the hopes that he sees how much you love him and comes to his senses.  This is very common, and it's a mistake each and every time, because the person is in so much pain that they fail to understand that respect is a crucial component of love.    Someone who comes back to you after hurting you because they see how much you care for them would be using you for that love.  They don't love you, they love how you love them.  You'll be left again, because they have no respect for you after watching you take the garbage they throw your way and hanging in there.  Someone who hurts you, and knows that they've hurt you, is absolutely flabbergasted if they see you making excuses to keep them in your life.  It builds up their ego and wears you down to a shell of who you used to be, both in their eyes and your own.  This is the path you're headed down, and you need to get off of it.  I've been around the block a few times, and I've seen breakups, and I've been a part of them.  The only way to have a true second shot that will last is to show that you care enough about yourself to walk away after someone leaves you.  That demonstrates self-respect, and often times it can cause an ""uh oh"" reaction in an ex.  (Even then, if they try to come back in just a few short months, know that nothing has changed other than their fear to be alone.  They don't want to lose you as an option.)  If they still want to try again and it's been six or more months, then you should consider it after hanging back from diving in with both feet so they can explain what's changed.     So choose to respect yourself and walk away.  The bonus of this approach is that even if you never hear from them again, you grieve and move on so you can love someone else someday.  It's a true win/win, but most brokenhearted people run like hell from it because it means that they have to stop clinging on to an ex.  It takes strength to let go and it will hurt. There's no avoiding that; it's the reality of life after a breakup.   I don't know whether to contact his family or just to leave it since we have broken up?   Leave it.  Stop talking to him.  If you have a reason in the future to fear for his safety (which you shouldn't because you shouldn't be in touch), you should contact one member of his family and let that person know what he's said to you.  Then drop it.  Of course, if he's making suicide threats and you feel like he is in imminent danger, call an ambulance for him.  Who cares if he gets mad?  It's not up to you decide whether it's a real threat or it's a way to manipulate you.  All you know is he threatened it so he needs medical attention.   I just know he has alot of abandonment issues   Girl, what?  Are you seriously worried about how he'll feel if you abandon him after he abandoned you?  You do realize that's ridiculous, right?  Standing by a man who is being deliberately hurtful to you by telling you details he knows will hurt you after he breaks up with you is not the decision making of an emotionally healthy woman.  Listen, no one likes being broken up with.  It sucks.  It hurts.  It's scary to let go.  But you're using your fear about letting go as an excuse not to, as if this is a completely unique feeling and no other person who has been broken up with has felt it.  No, everyone does.  But they suck it up and let go, because they have to.  You have to do this, too.   because despite all this before it happened he was so lovely and the best boyfriend i could have wished for.   I know it feels this way, but you've been together for a year.    It's possible the sheen of the honeymoon period has worn off and now you get to see the real him, and he saw the real you.  It sounds like a massive compatibility issue, and the man you were in love with was presenting the best version of himself to you.  That's what we all do in the honeymoon period, and that's why it's not wise to live together if you've been together less than a year.  You don't really know that person, even though you feel like you do.  The person you know is the perfect version of them that lives in your head.    I'm getting some pretty big codependent vibes from you, and I think it would do you good to do some research on codependency.  It is never a good sign when someone cares more for the other person than they do their own well being.  That isn't love.  Love is caring for yourself and also being able to care for someone else, but not putting that other person's needs above your own unless it's simply a rough patch in the relationship.  This isn't that.  This is a breakup, and it's time to start caring about yourself above everyone else.  You need time to grieve and heal."

relationship_advice,3dq99u,Pulp_Ficti0n,5,Sat Jul 18 18:59:32 2015 UTC,"First, he is not the best boyfriend you could ever have had.  There are many others out there.  Trust me on that.  Try okcupid or match or something.  But not tinder. Secondly, if he threatens to commit suicide, tell him you are worried and will call 911 for an ambulance.  That is best practice for a suicidal person.  Not to let them hold you ransom. Thirdly, while you were with your sister and he stayed at his place, he got horny and found someone on tinder.  I guarantee it.  He proceeded to attempt a breakup, but blamed it on you for fake reasons because he felt guilty and of course nothing is his fault /s.   Then that micro relationship tanked, so he slept around and then tried to get back with you. I do not like this fellow.  Move on!  What would you tell a daughter if she was dating a guy like this? Do that."
relationship_advice,3dq99u,keeblercobbler,2,Sat Jul 18 16:25:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Listen to this person.   Everyone thinks the grass is always greener on the other side--it RARELY is, at least not when what you leave is nothing better than what you leave to."
relationship_advice,3dq99u,1fuathyro,2,Sat Jul 18 21:33:26 2015 UTC,"You have not abandoned him, you are not responsible for his happiness, and you are certainly not responsible for keeping him from suicide.  You will be better off getting over this guy, no matter how much you care about him. He has demonstrated indifference to your feelings at best and a desire to hurt you at worst, in breaking up with you via phone and by immediately sleeping with many other women and in not meeting you as agreed. He has shown he has poor communication skills by breaking up with you instead of expressing his concerns in a mature manner (""When you talked about jobs in other countries, I felt like you were planning on leaving me. Could you clarify what your intentions are in the next few years?""). Add to this the emotional blackmail of threatening suicide and you have plenty of red flags that should be telling you to stay away from him.  You can advise him to seek medical help and to get in touch with a suicide assistance hotline, but you cannot make him do either, unless he is so extreme in his behaviour that it's medically justified to do this against his will. This is probably not the case, if he's meeting other women and hooking up with them he's not coming across as requiring mental evaluation."
relationship_advice,3dq99u,Veilofgears,3,Sat Jul 18 14:53:20 2015 UTC,Just because he says he slept with four girls since you broke up doesn't mean it's true.

This guy is being manipulative and TRYING to hurt your feelings. Being depressed is not a catch all excuse for being completely shitty to someone else.
relationship_advice,3dq99u,LaughingTrees,2,Sat Jul 18 14:50:58 2015 UTC,"He is her ex. I think she's overly attached to something that's done. He's not her boyfriend and yet this is how she refers to him.... My boyfriend broke up with me....  Him being cruel was him saying he didn't want to be with her anymore.  That isn't cruel, it's his reason, she thinks it's cruel cos she doesn't wish to let go.  She needs to.  Case closed.  From her biased descriptions of things I'm going to be a bit suspect of her claims of his illness he needs help for, cos clearly she thinks him sick because he's left her."

relationship_advice,3dq99u,Xiola_Blue,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:19:03 2015 UTC,"What if you constantly checking on him, talking to him, etc. is making things worse? After reading this I would guess at a minimum it is not helping him, likely it is a constant reminder you two are not together anymore.   My advice,  coupled with much of the others here: go offline,  radio silence, give him (and yourself) space. You both need to work through your post - breakup feelings and that can only happen with space.   If you are truly worried about him harming himself,  let his parents know and then step back. They should be there keeping tabs on him if that is a concern, but you are not his mom, keeper, or girlfriend.    Easier said than done I realize, but having been through something similar trust me, the random person on the interwebz, and give it a try."

relationship_advice,3drk6v,bshbshbsh,10,Sat Jul 18 19:44:34 2015 UTC,"I would apologize for the miscommunication, as that seems to be the crux of it. Then I would thank him for the help he provided. Not just a generic thank you, but a detailed rundown of how your project would not have been as successful without such-and-such input. Tell him some of the things you've learned from him. Then explain that while he was gone, you found you needed a little more hands-on guidance as you were moving through the project. That this project helped you gain a lot of experience, but that when you got to the middle of it, you needed someone to help guide you through it a little more consistently than he was able to do. You knew he was busy and didn't want to bother him by sending a bunch of emails. And Professor2 spent a lot of time and effort with you on this. Basically, ""it's not you, it was me"", sort of a thing. Again, I would apologize for the miscommunication. He might be thinking you blew him off because he didn't answer your questions in March and May. Or he might be one of those professors who is very sink-or-swim where his students are concerned. He also may think that he invested time and energy on you, and he is getting cheated out of the credit for the mentoring relationship. If it's the latter, then there isn't much you can do other than try to clear the air a bit. But he's most likely just kind of confused. Regardless, it can't hurt to tell him that you were floundering a bit in his absence and Professor2 was kind enough to start helping you mid-way through. That way you are taking the responsibility for the fact that you went to Professor2, and letting him know that it isn't because you thought he was falling down on the mentoring job or anything like that. I wouldn't come out and say that last part, but that's basically the information you want to convey. Along with an apology for not making him aware of your new mentor.   I wouldn't feel too bad about it, on the personal level. You did what you needed to do in order to be academically successful here. You just want to make sure it doesn't damage your future relationship with him.  Finally, I'd do this in an email, if he's kind of imposing in person. That way you can get the tone and the words right. You want to sincerely tell him how much he's helped you without it coming off as flattery, and that can be easier in something you can edit!"
relationship_advice,3drk6v,A_mellifera,2,Sat Jul 18 20:26:36 2015 UTC,"I have a draft, but I only have the apology. I'll have to see him really soon, for my presentation.   Should I justify the change while apologizing? Like, telling him that he was too busy and professor2 was there for me?"
relationship_advice,3drk6v,A_mellifera,3,Sat Jul 18 22:44:12 2015 UTC,"Two questions: are you undergrad? I'm kind of assuming undergrad because a grad thesis adviser should be a documented relationship. Second, how soon are we talking here?  For one thing, I would only apologize for your failure to let him know that someone else was helping you. You don't need to apologize for making the switch, because you've done nothing wrong there. So, I don't think you need to justify it to him, but it might be nice for you to explain to him what happened. I don't know the guy, but I think it would be a very bad idea to say something like he was too busy and professor2 was there for me (possibly implying when he wasn't there for you, depending on how he might take it). I mean, you can convey that information, but try to put the onus on yourself.  ""Professor,  I'd like to sincerely apologize for failing to communicate with you that Professor2 had become my thesis adviser. I didn't realize that you were unaware of the change, but I now realize that I had never spoken to you directly. And for that, I am very sorry.  I'd also like to thank you for your input and help in my project. Your guidance on xxx was invaluable to both the project and my education in the field. Your willingness to meet with me, go over my research, and the encouragement you've given me is something I truly value. Thank you for all of your help.  After you had left campus, I ran into some concerns. I've learned a lot through completing this thesis, but I found myself in a position in which I needed more daily guidance in order for the project to stay on task. I knew you were very busy, and I didn't want to inundate you with emails asking for help in this. Professor2 was kind enough to meet with me during this period of time and has devoted a lot of time and effort in helping me with my thesis. He was also instrumental in helping me obtain GrantX, and I completed my internship under him. It was during this period that he became my thesis adviser.   I now realize that I should have spoken to you about this when we met in March. And again, thank you for all of the time and effort you have given to help me with this project. The quality of my work would not have been possible without your help, and I truly appreciate everything you have done for me. I sincerely hope I haven't damaged our working relationship with this, because I have a lot of respect for you.""  I mean, put it into your own tone, but something along those lines. Then - when you see him - you can reference the email and again say that you are sorry for the way it was handled. Then you can take your cues from him. If he's still being huffy, then that will kind of be on him. But it wouldn't hurt to see if you can get the conversation moved towards the topic of your presentation."

I bet that if you genuinely said you are sorry he will understand. He himself is busy, and he must know how busy your work is. He may be upset for a bit, but most professors come around. They are usually very understanding people. It is just part of being an academic.  On a side note congratulations with your grant! That is awesome! I hope your weekend kicks ass as well.

If you explain the situation and why you made your decision I believe, given professor 1's background as an academic, that they can understand your thought process. I would mention that in the future you will work on updating people, shooting them emails, etc(I do not know the mode of contact you have with your professors. For me it is via email or visiting them on campus during office hours.) Essentially you are admitting your mistake and showing you have a plan to not make it again in the future. In essence you are learning from your experience.  I hope your weekend has been wonderful so far!  Kind regards,  Justin Dunkin"

I stayed together with her (in hindsight, I shouldn't have).   So don't tolerate it like I did, put your foot down and move on and find someone better.

There are exactly 2 things that are required for a successful relationship.  1.  Respect; and 2. Trust.  By the time a person is checking their S.O.'s phone or checking up on stated whereabouts, it's pretty obvious that the 2nd one of these critical items is shot.  It's not that you're wrong for checking up on her or that she's wrong for lying about where she was.  Take your morality out of the situation and just look at it pragmatically - there is no trust.  And honestly, if a person has no problem lying to your face, you have to wonder how much respect they have for you, but I'm going to focus on the trust.  So I guess you could try some of the advice people are giving you about confronting her, or maybe you could be distracted by the pinheads accusing you of stalking her, but why does it matter?  The trust has either left, or it never got a chance to fully develop, and that's pretty murky ground upon which to form a solid relationship.  Trust is very difficult to earn.  As they say, it takes a lifetime to earn, but it only takes a minute to lose.  And I personally think that every loss of trust does more than set you back to ground zero - it regresses further than that.  Once trust has been lost, it takes a long time just to get back to the level you had when you first met her.  I'm not telling you to trust her or not follow her or breakup with her or stay with her.  Just recognize what you're dealing with."
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,floor-pi,5,Sat Jul 18 21:52:38 2015 UTC,"Don't mind these idiots in the thread. You didn't make her lie about where she was. But the fact is that you don't trust her, and you have a good reason to not trust her (because she's texting guys and sleeping in somebody else's house).  It wont get better just because you confront her in a good way, just end it."
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,dandar4600,7,Sat Jul 18 17:22:18 2015 UTC,"She texted a guy I'll be there in an hour, stayed the night at his place and you're not sure what to do? Keep her as friend with benefits but under no circumstances make her into your girlfriend. At best she's a liar, at worst a liar and a cheater."
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,snarfu,25,Sat Jul 18 17:40:49 2015 UTC,"My lady wanted some space and clearly lied to get out of there because I was acting pretty clingy, so I decided to drive past her house approximately a half dozen times in the next few hours.   Translation filter applied."
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,matts2,26,Sat Jul 18 16:06:51 2015 UTC,And yet the point is that she lied. Not that she wanted something that might have been innocuous.
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,snarfu,-11,Sat Jul 18 16:33:58 2015 UTC,And yet we have one side of the story.  She could've been attempting to leave all night and OP was either oblivious or resistant.
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,matts2,19,Sat Jul 18 17:04:59 2015 UTC,She still lied and still did not go home.
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,snarfu,-9,Sat Jul 18 17:14:53 2015 UTC,Please explain how this excuses OP's stalkeresque behavior.
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,matts2,10,Sat Jul 18 17:22:21 2015 UTC,So following your GF who you think is cheating is now stalking?
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,snarfu,4,Sat Jul 18 17:31:39 2015 UTC,Where did cheating come from?  We have a new relationship where she's with this kid 24/7.  She leaves and his immediate reaction is....  better go drive past her house at nearly 1am  How was this justified?
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,matts2,5,Sat Jul 18 18:47:31 2015 UTC,"Read on, he also said she was busy texting and hiding it from him."
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,snarfu,-2,Sat Jul 18 19:34:16 2015 UTC,Which could simply also be...   She was texting with someone else and I didn't read the messages.   Not the same as    I stole her phone when so got up to use the restroom and there were dick pics aplenty!
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,Claclink,6,Sat Jul 18 20:05:38 2015 UTC,"Read OPs comment.  He saw her texting a guy ""be there in 1hour"" and then spent the night.  I am having trouble thinking of a possible scenario where she isn't cheating."
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,snarfu,-9,Sat Jul 18 19:03:32 2015 UTC,So she was texting with a member of the opposite sex.  Guess what?  That's half the people on the planet.
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,Claclink,12,Sat Jul 18 20:11:02 2015 UTC,"And then slept over, and lied about it."

relationship_advice,3dqnrd,triffid_boy,-1,Sat Jul 18 17:49:20 2015 UTC,Because there was no real reason to drive over to her house in the first place.

relationship_advice,3dqnrd,Gambit791,7,Sat Jul 18 19:43:11 2015 UTC,I mean she's lied and spent the night somewhere not at home without remotely mentioning it to OP. She's obviously up to something.  If she just wanted space she'd have no doubt said that and actually gone home.
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,snarfu,-7,Sat Jul 18 21:02:42 2015 UTC,"We have no idea if she did attempt to get space from OP in another way.  We don't have the benefit of a second viewpoint here.  But this is when you talk to your partner, not drive past their house over and over again."
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,Justagreewithme,4,Sat Jul 18 21:04:18 2015 UTC,"I guess you think there is a justification for lying.  Personally, I don't.  Different people have different ethical standards, I guess."
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,snarfu,-3,Sat Jul 18 21:43:52 2015 UTC,"No, I think there's two sides to this story and the way that OP describes his relationship, he seems clingy as hell.  I wouldn't blame this girl for needing to circumvent his emotional responses to GTFO of his house."
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,Claclink,2,Sat Jul 18 23:10:12 2015 UTC,So it is okay to lie and cheat on people if they act insecure?
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,jintak5,7,Sat Jul 18 23:40:53 2015 UTC,oh.. come on.. How is this hateful shit even upvoted ?
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,hamster_sword,-4,Sat Jul 18 22:30:26 2015 UTC,I think translation filter should be applied more often around here.

If I were her I would mistrust you because shit like that leads to some mega controlling behavior.   Why are you with her if you are so incredibly mistrustful that you have to stalk her for something so little? Is there more to this? Do you have a reason to think she is cheating? Her past is not enough to think that alone.   Also ""good morning"" does not equal ""im home"""
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,charliebeanz,14,Sat Jul 18 15:37:02 2015 UTC,"Before she left we were sitting on my couch watching tv and she kept getting text messages.  She kept turning away from me to text back, and eventually she didn't move far enough away and I saw her phone and she was texting ""I'll be there in an hour"" to somebody, it was a guys name."
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,ageekyninja,4,Sat Jul 18 15:51:13 2015 UTC,You should have put that part in the OP. You know good and well that she spent the night with this guy.
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,ageekyninja,-6,Sun Jul 19 03:10:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah but if you are clinging so hard then of course shes going to lie. My best guy friend always had to lie about us hanging out because he kept choosing clingy women and they would flip shit. If you dont want someone to cheat on you then dont give them a reason to want to cheat, that way if they up and DO cheat then you KNOW its all on them and not because of anything you did. You can walk away from that situation calling the other girl an asshole and be guilt free. If she is cheating she is still very in the wrong, but do you get what I am saying? Both of yall seem wrong here. Why are you still with her if this has gone so far?"
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,kittenTakeover,11,Sat Jul 18 16:16:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah man i get what your saying. I don't think I'm being that clingy, but I totally understand what you mean by saying not to give her a reason.  I'm not trying to force her to be with me all the time, most of the time it's her wanting to be with me.  I just hate lying and don't understand why people lie to people they care about."
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,ageekyninja,5,Sat Jul 18 16:34:55 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I would definitely ask her whats going on. It will probably turn into a fight, but thats what you have to do. In the future, I would not wait so long to call someone out. If it seems like someone is lying, call them out immediately. If you see someone texting a guy and think something of it it is WAY simpler to point to the phone and say ""whos that"" than it is to say ""who was that guy you were texting 3 days ago?""."

If you're doing it because your partner reacts badly when you hang out with other people, then you need to confont that issue. Lying is not the solution, and if the person isn't being clingy or is, lying is still just going to damage the relationship. Now he can't be sure what happened. It's like 50/50 that she cheated on him, which is a really shitty place to put your SO."

relationship_advice,3dqnrd,Falkner92,2,Sat Jul 18 20:45:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think her lying about going home is justified.  Regardless of her reason, she should not do it.  Maybe he was being clingy but two wrongs don't make a right.  How hard is it to be honest?  ""You're being clingy-I have guy friends and you are going to have to deal with that.""  Bam.  Done.  Now he can deal with it or not, it's up to him.  If he can't, then they aren't a compatible couple and the relationship will end as it should."

Your best option here would be to tell her that you know that she wasn't home. How do you know she wasn't home? Well you can either be honest with her that you stalked her, or make up some kind of creative story how maybe you felt bad like you were concerned and went to check up on her and she wasn't there..etc etc. Your pick."
relationship_advice,3dqnrd,Claclink,2,Sat Jul 18 17:03:18 2015 UTC,He trusted his gut and drove over to see if his girlfriend was telling the truth. That's far from stalking.

relationship_advice,3dqnrd,MTknowsit,2,Sun Jul 19 00:33:43 2015 UTC,"You invaded her privacy, but I think you had good reason to.  She was being sketchy and your hunch was right.  She texted a guy I'll be there in an hour, and then slept over and lied about it.  Pretty obvious what is going on.  Are you guys official?  I know you call her your girlfriend, but a lot of couples haven't had the exclusive talk after 3 months.  If she has agreed to be exclusive and this has already happened in the first 3 months, this relationship is over.  There is no way you will be able to trust her again.  I think you sit her down and come clean.  Here is how I would do it.  Have her sit down next to you and say you need to talk.  Tell her you know she lied about going home last night, she went over to guys house last night and she slept over and it is over.  If she continues to lie, don't even engage her in conversation and tell her to leave."

Someone drove it before you and someone will drive it after you. That's why you should never get married. Alimony, child support, loss of assets. There's no reward for the family man. Women today are looking for the tall tat'd bad boys. Oh sure they'll take a time out from them with a safe bet sucker of a guy long enough for the kids to hit school full time and then it's off to divorce court for them to redistribute YOUR income and assets as they see fit, and then it's back to the bad boys. I say, let them have'm. I'd rather migrate to Asia so I never have to deal with the family court system again. You know. Where they destroy families with their meddling.  I tell my sons find a woman who's in her 30's 40's alimony and child support coming in from the ex(s), just wants to have fun and won't pressure you into children and marriage like the young ones do until it's game over for you, the threat of jail time if you can't pay your child support. But yeah, a woman with her tubes tied bro is a major bonus. Puberty is the beginning of the end. Stay with your parents and forget about growing up. It's overrated. There's no reward for the family man. It's a life of slavery.  Check out the marriagestrike and divorce subreddits for what your future is."

Try to avoid her as much as possible at work, this is not something you talk about at work. When you get home apologize and tell her what you did.

relationship_advice,3dtggb,jakucumber,3,Sun Jul 19 07:58:32 2015 UTC,"Seems like they arent into you. I wouldnt pursue further. What are some deeper details? Got any example conversations you can copy/paste?   I dont know for sure but it sounds like you are not picking up on hints. Maybe not even in normal conversations. Honestly, every guy I have ever dated has not pursued me. Not at first anyway. They were just doing their own thing. This way, I got to know them as them and not just that guy who was into me. They stood out in their own special ways. If you become ""that guy whos into this girl"" and thats all you are, thats not very special or memorable. Its not even all that genuine. You just want a girlfriend. How do they even know if you like them for who they actually are? What most people, lots of ladies included, is someone with a personality that naturally meshes with theirs. If you meet someone purely with the intent for courtship...well, it can still work out, but its less natural. You are more likely to match whoever they want you to be. Personally, when I know this, I get skeptical of the other person. Anyway this is pure speculation.  If someone wants to hang with you they will make time, even if they have to schedule way ahead. The 3 trys rule is always good to abide by. No response at all after 3 messages? Message no more. No date after 3 tries? No more date plans. Both happened? Cut contact, they arent interested."

relationship_advice,3dtggb,ageekyninja,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:08:55 2015 UTC,"I never really went after them but after a couple of conversations i felt some sort of attraction to them. Amy seemed like she was interested in me and after a couple of conversations we started texting. We'd usually text about ourselves and we'd get to know each other better. i never really say lets go out on a date but when i tried to put something together for just the two of us, she seemed pretty keen. We couldn't find a day to settle on so i just said another time and after that she slowly started ignoring me. She'd start replying late, then start ignoring my first text, the second and so on. After a close friend told me that i should probably be careful about her, i figured she had probably found another guy.  Natalie also approached me  and after having a few conversations, i again, was interested in her. After i added her on Facebook she immediately sent me a message. We started to get to know each other and a little later we we're talking about going into the city (living in the suburbs). She said i should hit her up if i planned on going and needed someone to go with. I said that sounds good and we checked our schedules for any free days but unfortunately, nothing. We continued to talk, she told one of my friends at work that we were going to go out to the city sometime. She had an assignment that needed to be done so we didn't talk for a half a week. She messaged me back, i replied, she's seen it. We just got out of work together and we talked but it wasn't like before, she seemed a lot less talkative, only to me."

relationship_advice,3dtggb,Tisguy,3,Sun Jul 19 09:18:22 2015 UTC,"Im saying you should go with the flow, and dont try so hard :) in relationships, things always fall into place in the weirdest of ways. When you are constantly thinking about relationships, one will nearly always seem out of reach. This is because a lot of luck is involved in ending up in one- and of course this is the case! Out of everyone around you you have to happen upon one who you are compatible with emotionally, physically, spiritually, sexually, and intellectually. THEN your life has to align with theirs just right. Thats a lot of luck! People can really discourage themselves and end up doing a bunch of unnatural shit trying to speed up the process of getting lucky...but thats too much stress. Its healthier to make yourself into the best man you can, in a sense where you are your version of a man (not anyone elses), and focus on your goals. Youre gonna meet a lot of good people along the way. Especially if you are doing hobby related things"
relationship_advice,3dtc7t,NoWeCan,4,Sun Jul 19 06:48:33 2015 UTC,"I wonder if this whole talk of food is a diversionary tactic, to avoid dealing or talking about something. These aren't idle thoughts, she wouldn't get so defensive over them if they were and she wouldn't be quick to try and invalidate and discomform your valid feelings about them.  I think the issue is bigger than you'll be able to solve on your own, especially if she's not willing to talk. She's spun it around on you enough that you're invalidating your own feelings, and that's really bad news."
relationship_advice,3dtc7t,sinscriven,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:03:57 2015 UTC,"Well I just want to check myself. I get why she was upset about it, it is especially embarrassing and upsetting to talk about a sensitive issue (like food) while you're naked.   In this comment I talk a little more about it, but she has weird feelings and behaviors about some other things too. She grew up very poor, and it does manifest itself in some other ways too. She's aware of this, and she had been to therapy in the past to deal with some of these issues. She also is going to go back to therapy for a tune up kind of thing, to deal more with some of these issues.   In general, I don't think how she reacted came from malice or trying to be manipulative or anything. A portion of her attitude about food comes from how she grew up, and that's the root of what makes me uncomfortable.   Also it's not out of the question that maybe I was just being an ass lol. That's what I wanted to check about. I didn't think that I was being unfair, but sometimes you're not your best judge you know?   Anyway, we talked about it a little more this morning and we've apologized to each other. She apologized for getting defensive and being a jerk about what I was trying to say, and I apologized for bringing it up while we're naked. Talking about eating and attitudes towards food can always be embarrassing or make one feel weird, so I see why she got so defensive about it at that time."
relationship_advice,3dtc7t,iamtomie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:05:35 2015 UTC,"Have you thought that maybe she has a type of binge eating disorder or even EDNOS? Eating when you're not hungry tends to be linked to emotions, trying to make insecurities or bad feelings 'better' by eating and over-eating is very common. I have anorexia, and although I'm now in the 'management' stage where it's no longer in control of my entire life I recall being 17 and talking constantly about food to sexual partners, thinking about it obsessively, eroticising it purely to make it acceptable to think about food even in a sexual context. I don't do it any more as I've been working on my mental health and channelling my negative feelings into my career rather than using food to control them. It might be helpful you and your girlfriend to think about where to begin helping her manage her (possible) disorder and developing coping mechanisms to overcome her compulsion to eat."
relationship_advice,3dtc7t,iamtomie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:21:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you read any of my other comments, but she grew up very poor and definitely has some weird attitudes towards food. She's going to be going back to therapy to deal with some issues that are cropping up because of her upbringing.  How should I start to talk about something like this? I mean I don't know that it's disordered eating, but I feel like there's not a boundary about food. Her behavior about it sounds similar to what you're talking about.   As I described elsewhere, I also really like food and know about it. We'll critique meals that we have at restaurants and stuff. But there's just some borderline where it starts to be uncomfortable for me, like when she'll eat so much food that she'll feel sick.   I think ""compulsion to eat"" sounds closer to what's happening."
relationship_advice,3dtc7t,iamtomie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:11:37 2015 UTC,"That's what I mean- I know a lot of people who've grown up poor develop an obsession with food, but that can spiral. Your girlfriend may have been having therapy but I think she needs a specialised type- you may have to look into being referred to an Eating Disorder specialist as they will take her step-by-step from the origins of her compulsion to eat to how to manage it. They might offer her CBT, which would help as it might break down her feelings a lot. At the moment she's having an overwhelming 'I NEED TO EAT' thought process, but therapists will get to address that by questioning it, then offering alternatives. 'I need food' may translate to 'I need reassurance that I'm okay and that I'm good enough but don't know how to ask' (just an example)."
relationship_advice,3dtc7t,Branfip81,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:20:31 2015 UTC,"How do I address this with her?   I don't know that it's necessarily at the level of an eating disorder, but I feel like there's definitely some obsessive behavior about food that I think she should talk about when she goes back to therapy."
relationship_advice,3dtc7t,Branfip81,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:23:56 2015 UTC,"Eating disorders come in many different forms and levels- she definitely binges going by your description of the party incident. And even if what's going on isn't exactly a disorder, specialists who are knowledgable about food obsessions and compulsions can still help her. Personally I'd bring up the food thing one evening when you're both relaxed and say you're wondering if it's a kind of emotional eating, and whether she'd be willing to look into Eating Disorder therapy simply to cover all bases. If you try it and figure that's not what's going on then at least you've crossed off one possible explanation, and that's progress in itself!"

relationship_advice,3dtauy,HairyCockroach,10,Sun Jul 19 06:28:07 2015 UTC,She is more capable of taking care of his affairs should something have happened to him.  It makes sense that he would go scurrying back to her in the face of a medical emergency. He freaked out and was realistic about who would be taking care of his crippled old ass into eternity if shit got real at the hospital.   He doesn't want his wife knowing about you and he isn't planning to leave her. Its really that simple. Please understand that even if this all works out and he does leave her he will probably cheat on you. It already seems like chances are good that you aren't the only side chick since he has cheated on his wife many times.
relationship_advice,3dtauy,Sixdeer,2,Sun Jul 19 07:57:12 2015 UTC,"I don't believe he is currently cheating or is planning to. He has been separated from his wife and living by himself before we ever met. Only by law could you say he's cheating on his wife. He is not in a relationship with her. He just hasn't filed for divorce.   But he also hasn't shown a real interest to either. I had to beg and pester him for weeks before he even printed the forms out. This was a year ago and, obviously, he never filled them out or turned them in."

I agree with you though. The real issue here is whether he is truly down for a divorce or not. Granted, I was the child (sorta) in a similar situation. It took my parents 3 years. Financial troubles. So it's not impossible for them to be in the same situation if they are under financial distress"
relationship_advice,3dtauy,Damazein,2,Sun Jul 19 21:12:39 2015 UTC,"Faithfulness, for me, is about more then just sexual monogamy. Its about being open, honest, fair and treating people with respect. I dont think he is doing that with her or his family.  If he's so poor, then a divorce should be easy because there is no property, cash, investments, assets or pensions to divide. He just needs to agree terms with his wife. And if she is the first person he calls when he goes to hospital - then something tells me she doesnt know anything about this other woman.  If he loved OP he would be sharing his life with her. He isnt. He's keeping everything nice and separate. Thats why I say she has no reason to trust him - because he;s not being trustworthy"
relationship_advice,3dtauy,Damazein,-1,Sun Jul 19 21:17:26 2015 UTC,"When he and his wife divorced, she moved out of his house and they agreed that if he helped her back on her feet, she wouldn't file to take half of everything of his.  So he put a down payment on a new house for her, bought her the furniture she'd have to replace from what he was taking, giving her time to set up her own medical insurances and everything else she needed to get done. He didn't want to kick her out and leave her stranded by herself.  He ended up having to sell his own house after moving his wife because he couldn't keep up with the payments and there was no family to fill it.   So technically he owns his wife's house.. The divorce would take a little more time for them to give ownership of the house to her and taking names off certain bank accounts, etc.   All this has left his credit is horrible shape and he's paying off credit cards, car payments, and practically paying for all of my expenses. We are stupidly poor right now and had to settle for a shit hole (yet expensive) apartment because we couldn't afford anywhere else."

relationship_advice,3dtauy,AlenaBrolxFlami,5,Sun Jul 19 12:26:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know which is worse; the fact it started off with a 36 year old man dating a 16 yr old girl, you know he's hidden other women from the woman he's STILL married to or the fact you think you honestly think he's going to get divorced for you.  If he really has been saying he wants to get divorced since long before he met you, then what exactly has stopped him? Money? I wouldn't have money either if i was having numerous relationships behind my wifes back. Maybe he should stop dating so many people and actually get a divorce and stop playing people.  And if all this got out, how do you think his family and friends will react when they find out he was dating a 16yr old when he was 36 while married? Do you think they're going to be over joyed? Do you honestly think they're going to be happy with him? I can't imagine they'll be too damn impressed.  Quite frankly you need to cut you loses and run, and if he's serious about getting divorced he should worry about that first before he starts starting relationships with other people."

Instead he's decided to have a string of relationships while he's still married. He sorts her out with a house, he looks after her, when he ends up in hospital she is the one who comes to look after him while you're kicked out before anyone comes over.  You're nothing but his side piece. You will ALWAYS be his side piece until either he gets tired of you or you finally get tired of his lies and bullshit and finally leave him.

relationship_advice,3dt973,MelloChocolate,4,Sun Jul 19 06:04:00 2015 UTC,From her point of view she is probably thinking why a 25 year old is interested in an 18 year old and it's ringing alarm bells in her head. Maybe she thinks he'll take advantage of you in terms of sex and because your going to college she's probably worried your grades will slip because of a boy.   I would reassure her that you are mature enough and ask her why she's so worried. Remember not to scream or have a tantrum because that just makes you look like a child in her eyes.

I think that you should sit them down and tell them you are open to talking about every single one of their concerns. They, as your parents, have every right to them. Show them how mature you are. Show them you can think and fend for yourself.  I hope that my advice was helpful, and I hope that your parents come around. If they do not at first, you may have to try and be patient. I would not try and be rash and ignore their wishes if they state they do not want you to date him. Pose the question if they are okay with you getting to know him better.

They are not being critical of her in any malicious fashion. In fact it is indicative that they care greatly for her. They probably love her to death and are very proud of her.

relationship_advice,3dt4jb,Sixdeer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:23:23 2015 UTC,Gee whiz Hun. Maybe drinking alone isn't the best idea. I'm sure you know that making someone you're entire world isn't healthy. What do you like to do? Do you have any hobbies? Why don't you use the time to relax and reflect? Read a book? Treat yourself? Visit a friend! Family! Try a new recipe.   You sound like your happiness depends solely on him and his proximity. .... that's a sign you're not happy with yourself. Take some time tonight and think about it.
relationship_advice,3drv2e,Dipsqueeze,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:20:48 2015 UTC,"I gather she has not responded as of yet. If she does not, leave it alone. If she does I may suggest that you were saying a quick hello, keep it sterile and short and then leave it alone. I know it is difficult but it appears that you have your life well on track and moving forward. Do your best to keep it that way."
relationship_advice,3drv2e,dewarsmaduro,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:02:13 2015 UTC,She replied almost immediately and said she would meet me yesterday morning. She called it off because her boyfriend said he doesn't trust me. Which makes me think he's not trusting of her to handle it herself. But she continued to text me throughout the day and said that it was really good to hear from me. She said she'll have the meeting with me but she said to give her a couple days first. Her boyfriend leaves for oregon tomorrow and I told her I don't want to impose on their last weekend together because I want her to be happy. So I'm going to text her again tomorrow evening and see if she'll meet me on monday.
relationship_advice,3drv2e,dewarsmaduro,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:15:33 2015 UTC,I would gather that her boyfriend (good or bad) is correct. I think that your desire to meet has less to do with her happiness and more to do with your pain (understandable). Now she will meet with you after her boyfriend leaves town. I honestly wish you the best but many years of experience tell me it would be best for you to stay on your current path and allow her to take her own.
relationship_advice,3drv2e,dewarsmaduro,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:24:03 2015 UTC,I appreciate the advice. I'm still going to take the risk because I'll never know what could have been if I dont.
relationship_advice,3dt15i,HashtagYas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:22:09 2015 UTC,"Your complaints make no sense.    I am the mutual friend to both girls. I made plans with F22 and she NEGLECTED to tell me that F19 was joining in with us. I didn't feel good that day so I bailed, but I wasn't asked for a confirmation of my arrival (which is okay I guess. Thats my MO, but not theirs I guess).   So you were going to hang out with 22 but bailed on her and you're upset that 22 ended up hanging out with 19?  You're the one who bailed, so I have no idea why you're upset.  You'd rather 22 be left hanging if you're not available?   F22 and I went to the pride parade and said we would hang out more often since I usually hangout with F19 since we're in the same sorority.    So you hung out with 22 and spend a lot of time hanging out with 19 -- what's the problem?"
relationship_advice,3dt15i,MsAnthropic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:47:25 2015 UTC,"They've been distant.  And with the experience I've had with missing events, the people that go end up getting closer while I get alienated from the group. This has happened to  me on several occasions. That's why I'm complaining. I know its my fault I didn't go. I'm not saying for the world to stop because I'm not there, I'm acknowledging the fact that life isn't like that.   And you may say, its just one event, but it's not. They've been making plans on the fly and I can't join them because of prior engagements."
relationship_advice,3dt15i,MsAnthropic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:54:06 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're jealous of not being everyone's #1 best friend.  While I don't think that it's a particularly unusual emotion, it's typically a fleeting thing -- focusing on it is unhealthy.  People who hang out more typically become closer friends.  If you want to maintain a close friendship with them, you need to proactively make plans to spend time with them.  You being unavailable to hang out is frankly not their problem."
relationship_advice,3dt15i,MsAnthropic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:08:04 2015 UTC,I know it's not their problem...

More people than you think can relate to your question: ""Am I making the right choice?""  You’re right to not want to settle for “comfortable.”  Personally in a situation like this, I would recommend starting with Dr. Stephen Covey’s first virtue: be proactive.   You and your girlfriend are a team, in the most intimate sense. Begin the emotional repair together by asking her to join you in a crucial conversation. Share with her why you have been feeling the way you’ve been feeling, and then listen to what she has to say.  I believe that after having a constructive discussion with one another, you and your girlfriend will be one step closer toward reaching a clearer vision of the past, present, and future.  Good luck."
relationship_advice,3dqe5v,BassTune,26,Sat Jul 18 13:00:06 2015 UTC,"Feelings of boredom are normal. As with all feelings you are responsible for understanding if they are rational or not, and what action is necessary - if any.   Some people take the easy way out, and repeat the pattern over and over for the rest of their life, or they learn at some point to see their own actions and expectations for what they are and how they are contributing to their experience.   No one can say if this relationship is what you should build on any further but you. If you include her in discussing your wants, needs, fears and insecurities you are likely to find some guidance.   Statically speaking, you aren't very likely to find your life long partner at 16 and you shouldn't feel pressured that this experience is all there will ever be."

Thank you for this response though."
relationship_advice,3dqe5v,ageekyninja,5,Sun Jul 19 00:57:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its really common. In fact, it is inevitable. When you kiss, hold hands, have sex, or are attracted to someone (etc) your body releases chemicals that make you feel really good and excite you. It is literally and medically exactly the same as doing drugs. But when your body experiences these chemicals too much (like when you are repeatedly doing these things for 3 years), it gets used to the chemicals. Its drug tolerance. Then you dont feel much of anything at all anymore. That doesnt mean you dont like the person though. Whether you like someone or not is actually separate from the chemicals. A lot of people just dont know that. You can figure out if you like your girlfriend by spending some time apart from her. You dont have to go on break or anything, just have a week or so to yourself. Find some excuse or something to do. See if you miss her. See if you want to talk to her. Maybe youll see something that reminds you of her that you have to talk about. Those are signs that its a stage and youll get over it. If you are looking at other women the whole time though and wishing you were with them then the relationship has run its course."

relationship_advice,3dqe5v,Thecardinal74,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:46:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed your feelings are normal. Grass always seems greener on the other side of the fence. It's up to you to decide if it really is or not.  That said, you started dating when you were 16. You are an adult now and aren't the same person you were then, nor are you the person you will be at 22. Nor is she.  It's certainly possible that as you grow and mature into adulthood your interests and desires change. You simply might be losing interest in the relationship, not just getting bored.  Spend some time thinking about who you are, what you want in life, what you are interested in, and what you want from a partner. Then see if she fits into this. If so, dismiss these thoughts and work on making the relationship more interesting.  If she doesn't, then maybe take the brave step of moving on to the next adventure in your life"
relationship_advice,3dqe5v,erpujeeh,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:30:05 2015 UTC,There are two opposing sides to consider here. 1) You might be too young to know what is out there and need to experience more of yourself and the world before knowing who is a good match for you. 2) There will always be something new and shiny to chase.  Always.  If you chase the new and shiny forever you will end up alone.  Finding the perfect partner is a matter of balancing the two and knowing that the person and the timing is right before committing long term.

Secondly, you push physically despite her being uncomfortable. thirdly, when these two tactics don't work you send a deliberately passive aggressive text message and then finally tell her you're only interested in her sexually and her friendship is pretty meaningless to her.  None of these actions make you seem particularly great - and to be honest if someone displayed these behaviors/tactics to me, I would move on."

I told her our friendship meant a lot, but we are unable to interact without being extremely flirtatious.

relationship_advice,3dsw1b,TexasBlu3,2,Sun Jul 19 03:26:34 2015 UTC,"Before I give you advice I will give a brief background on the people I date so you can understand why I am never jealous when it comes to a significant other and how she(or he) interacts around other males(I am bi so you can apply it to all mixtures of relationships). I am a person who places honesty above all else in a relationship, and I can respect and trust any person I am in a lasting relationship with. This comes from how I choose who to date. If they are not honest I will not date them.  Onto answering your questions. I am open to allowing my significant partner have sexual intercourse with another person if they have higher sexual needs then me. Maybe they have a fetish they want to try. I can trust that person because of how honest they are with me, and me with them. For some people sex is nothing above lust, and making love is something they separate from just having sex. Making love is seen as something you only do with your significant other. It is more intimate; a lot more emotional.  I answered the question above; I hope it was helpful in answering your question. If you have questions about how to approach the topic you are more then welcome to ask away. I will provide you with how I personally would approach the situation.

To me its a question of trust and maturity, if you really have that, you feel it in your gut that they wont go too far. There is a certain reality that no matter the context (work, church, a bar, at the bus stop) men and women can be attracted to one another and even flirt but thats where I draw the line. I personally flirt and on a few occasions ive gone drinking with coworkers, flirting happened, even dancing but that was it. I almost kissed someone good night but changed my mind at the last second. Ive been around the block a few times and no matter how hot or heck even how nice and how attracted I am to the other person I know better than to put it all on the line for one flirtation."

relationship_advice,3drigu,YourFirstPubicHair,4,Sat Jul 18 19:29:23 2015 UTC,"I think you have a somewhat idolised image of what your optimal partner should be like. Though communication is good and necessary in a relationship, depression is a mental illness where your brain do not operate normally and discussing the darker side of your mind is best done with a professional.   He should definitely be aware of your mood and how your depression is affecting you, but don't go too deep or expect him to bring any clarity to thoughts or behaviours you probably find confusing yourself. Awareness is the key, and if he shows compassion towards your symptoms you know that this is something you can overcome or learn to deal with along the way.   People who haven't experienced depression or any kind of therapy are often reluctant to see how past experiences affect them and have an impact in their behaviour and actions. You need to accept that as 'normal' too and maybe ease him into the subject a little.   Perhaps he will never come to understand the full meaning of everything affecting you (or him - but who does ever, really) and you need to decide at what level a little ignorance is actually a prosperous thing or when it becomes an obstacle in your relationship."

I just go off by myself until I'm over it.   Is it better to share those moments with him? I just wonder if it's normal or healthy getting married and only displaying my happy side. (Which I am a genuinely happy person so it's not forced it hard to show) It's just if I'm sad he never knows but if it's been working so far should I continue keeping it to myself?

What she needs is for you to be supportive and help reduce her stress. You could do that by listening to her talk about the problems she's having. Don't try to solve the problem, just listen. Maybe do something nice for her, like bring her food or a small token item to show you are thinking of her.

relationship_advice,3dq87k,Lone_Phantom,2,Sat Jul 18 18:39:49 2015 UTC,"Isn't it possible to go and buy food and diapers for the cousin without giving the cousin money?  I think that you can research and give her advice. One thing I would research would be local drug rehab centers and legal guardianship of minors. You'd want to bring as many options to the table as possible, because I think more options will help her feel like she has more control and gives her more support.  I think that's going to show her you care. Talking to her and letting her feelings out will help, but you may have done that or started that already. Tell her you're there for her.  In my opinion, the more info she gives, the more she'll accept help she receives.   Depression can be temporary and it can also be long-term. Your gf can definitely be back to how she was if her situation gets better. And it sounds like your gf doesn't like her cousin."

Just have fun, be pleasant, and be a gentleman. Treat this woman as you would want a man to treat a woman you love and care for. Show her the respect she deserves and she will take note of it. Dating is an extremely fun thing to do if you are willing to just be loose and open and honest with her. If you are having confidence issues try and fight against the fear that is walling you in. I commend you for coming on here and asking for advice. I wish I had because my first dates were abysmal.  I hope your date goes well and you have a long, healthy, lasting relationship with the woman you are taking out. Have a great time.  Kind regards,  Justin Dunkin"

relationship_advice,3dssys,JustinDunk1n,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:17:33 2015 UTC,"Let me reword what I said above. Go with the flow. You seem smart. I have complete confidence in your ability to impress this girl. You clearly are very excited to go on a date, and that is awesome. Your worries are completely natural for anybody new to dating. In time you will realize that dates tend to follow a certain ebb and flow. The key is not to overthink them. Try and just have as much fun as possible while still sticking to your morals. Do what feels right to you.  On a side note you coming on here and asking for advice is proof that you have the potential to be a very healthy, mature dater. You are showing early signs of maturity by taking dating seriously. That is something to be commended for.  I hope your date goes well and that I was able to potentially help you.  Kind regards,  Justin Dunkin"
relationship_advice,3dssys,Tisguy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:05:40 2015 UTC,"If she gets along well with her family, ask about them, but not in a creepy way. Girls love talking about her family.  'So you have a brother or a sister?  'Yeah a bro he is a doctor'   'Really? That's kinda awesome. Why you never considered being a doctor?'  'Yeah he's such a dork, he's like 3 years older than me and' bla bla bla. You won't even haven to think the next question.  Ask about pets. 'Omg I had this little chihuahua that would bark all day, that little thing had the lungs of a lion I swear'  Etc. when you're asking about likes and dont likes, focus a lot on what she likes. That will come handy in future dates. Just listen. Don't try to take the convo where you would like, take it where she seems to wanna go. And did I say listen? Listen."

I don't necessarily see anything in this post that indicates her interest towards you. I'm not saying she isn't, I'm just saying that I have no reason to believe she is looking for a date. If you want to gauge where her mind is, I would just say something like ""Hey. I had a good time with you at dinner the other night. Would you like to do dinner again sometime?""  And let her answer. If she says yes, cool. Take it from there. If she says no, do not:   Freak out and be mad. Take it as a personal affront-- she may be seeing someone or not interested. It happens.   Just be calm about it. Best of luck!"

relationship_advice,3ds4ca,iShakeBabyOtters,4,Sat Jul 18 22:46:09 2015 UTC,"You should talk to a therapist. You both started dating when you were 17, and maybe when you got engaged she realized it wasn't what she wanted.   She ended it and saved you both from a miserable marriage. Who she dates and where she goes with her SO is none of your business. She can go wherever she wants to, and you should not feel like it's s personal attack on you.   You need to leave her alone, break all communication if that's what you need to do to move on. Drinking is not going to help, but talking to a therapist might."

Maybe see a therapist if that's your thing.  However,...  Whenever I see you kids in your adult prime having a non committal relationship going south, remember the good parts and move on.    Try being 50 and your SO of 25 years just divorced you.  Try being a single parent at 35 and your kid has Cerebral Palsy and your ex-spouse is an ass and offers no support.  You have no baggage so go tour the world and take a bite out of life.  There is nothing holding you back.  You will look back at this time and laugh at how narrow minded you were.  Good times man.

If she really wants you back, she would be groveling and acting like it was a mistake.  But she isn't. It sounds like you know what she's doing-- which is using you as a safety net. Don't do that to yourself. You are worth way more than that.  If you're being offered a job out of state, and it's one you want...dude, take it! Don't stick around for her. Live your life for you, not her. She chose to remove herself from your life...so there is no reason for you to live for her.  My advice...take her off facebook/phone/social media, take that job if it's one you want! Keep up the good work on your therapy and kick that smoking habit. Be strong.   I know it may feel like she was your sea...but there are other fish out there. Right now, you are what should matter most to yourself."
relationship_advice,3drpoq,iratemercenary,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:05:43 2015 UTC,You want things to improve? stop doing what you are doing which is being desperate to get things to work.

I know this will hurt but believe me when you get into being more independent she will follow you.
relationship_advice,3drpoq,reloadfreak,-2,Sun Jul 19 03:40:09 2015 UTC,"Don't grovel man. He who cares the least in the relationship controls the relationship.  You're letting her wrap you around her little finger.  Take that job out of state! Your career should come first!! That's a no-brainer!!! OMG!!! Man!!!  Relationships fizzle. Why ? (from dictionary.com) FAMILIARITY BREEDS CONTEMPT The better we know people, the more likely we are to find fault with them. Long experience of someone or something can make one so aware of the faults as to be scornful. For example, Ten years at the same job and now he hates it familiarity breeds contempt . The idea is much older, but the first recorded use of this expression was in Chaucer's Tale of Melibee (c. 1386). So divorce happens. Never get married!!  But let's say you guys work it all out. What's the point? Where do you think it will lead? Kids? Marriage? 5 kids from 3 baby daddies that what happens here in the US. What incentive do women have to be with just one man when she can collect a check from each of you? More and more government benefits and food stamps for each child. And now counties are tacking the cost of those benefits onto the male in addition to the child support you owe.  I tell my sons find a woman who's in her 30's 40's alimony and child support coming in from the ex(s), just wants to have fun and won't pressure you into children and marriage like the young ones do until it's game over for you, the threat of jail time if you can't pay your child support. But yeah, a woman with her tubes tied bro is a major bonus. Puberty is the beginning of the end. Stay with your parents and forget about growing up. It's overrated. There's no reward for the family man. It's a life of slavery. So I ask you. Do you really want this relationship to carry on?"

Itwent away with time and I didn't realise it was back till 2 weeks ago. She left me because iv had short burst of anger several times in the relationship . But didn't know st the time why. So I started therapy  and found out why. I have catastrophic  thinking due to the major loss 8 years ago. But it and the anxiety  only came back when I gave her my heart. Now I'm medicated  lightly for the anxiety  so no more angry outburst.  I also lied about quiting smoking for 6 months . I quit cold turkey  3 weeks ago. Now that my mistakes are out there . Don't let the picture be painted yet. I have treated this woman like gold. We are great together and truly  in love.  My devotion ,loyalty , and commitment  has been second to none . She knows with the issue's  fixed she couldn't ask for a better man. But here comes the rest . Now there are new reasons my In security crushed her freedom and now that I can give her the freedom without the insecurity  . She keeps saying more time the insecurity  is from the loss. And anxiety n. Now fixed. In the mean time she has drank everynight since we broke up  post picture  on Facebook  with a smile that's only skin deep .she tells me she still lives me but . Post things on face book about the future and not looking back. And it's been done . When I ask her she says it wasn't about me. Damn it I'm so confused. Does she just want her cake and eat it to?

relationship_advice,3dsnkk,GataB,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:57:09 2015 UTC,"Hey OP. [26/m] Im sorry you are going through this. I have many friends who are women and they are stuck in abusive relationships. One has been mentally physically and emotionally abused and she keeps going back to this guy no matter how much i try to tell her that love is respecting and loving oneself. The thing is, i would tell u to communicate with your partner but from the sounds of it, u are also stuck in an abusive relationship. I empathize with u. Everyone deserves to love and be loved like u said, but in order for that to happen, a primary goal for each partner must be, to want one another. U both need to want to make it work. Letting go is terrifying. Its extremely hard and u will question yourself to no end, but that is just your mind leaning on a self fulfilling prophecy of your boyfriends words. Lingering on if he was right will cause u to act accordingly. Truth is, there is love out there, and its all for you. he tells u negative things about yourself because hes tryin to control u, make u stick, basically turn him into a glorified messiah of your love life. Dont let him. U believe what he says because u think lowly of yourself. Love yourself first before u can love another. Its the best i have to offer u at this current moment, but i do wish u the strength to get out of this mind trap. Its debilitating not to mention degrading to your life goals. You are meant to be happy. Recognize this and achieve it through confidence and meditation.   Good luck"

relationship_advice,3dsnf3,skjay91,3,Sun Jul 19 01:55:34 2015 UTC,"The way you're describing your pattern it's sounding as though you don't have much attachment to people. As long as they're useful and serve some purpose to you (fill your time, marry you, etc) you make space for them but once you find something else that interests you more you move on.  I see that especially in what you said about your mostly male friends. You mentioned, for no relevant reason, that none of them are ""hott"" otherwise you probably would have dated them. Are any of them nice? Do you share interests/morals/values? Being good looking is so superficial to the success of a relationship. It may begin an attraction, but it doesn't maintain a relationship forever on its own.  I don't think it's necessary to hang out with people you don't want to. But if you care about the affect your actions have on others, you may want to think about how it feels to be used. Because that's what it sounds like you're doing."

My best guy friend is very similar to me and was always my rock.   I've been used by people more than you know and I have trust issues with people, ptsd and I have a shrink. The thing is I always felt that maybe it's weird that I can't focus on more than one person at a time. I don't have many female friends (neither does my older sister) because I can't relate to most girls. I'm weird.. eccentric and I've never been normal and grew to accept it. I have a sense of humor of a guy and I can be an offensive person, so I generally get along with dudes.  Also I notice when I'm friends with girls they treat me like I'm their boyfriend and always want to complain and vent to me about stupid stuff.

Just because anonymous strangers on the Internet say something happened doesn't mean it did.  As far as the information that's been laid out, it was just a kiss and if you can decide for yourself that that is enough of an icebreaker to let this relationship expire, then that's it. If you feel like you can get past it, then definitely set some ground rules. If you find yourself questioning everything (her plans, her motives, her friends, etc.) definitely communicate with her. You don't have to break up with her now if you're feeling unsure about it. If there comes a point where you can't take it anymore, then do it.   Personally, this sounds like a horrible, stupid mistake rather than a calculated preplanned thing. I would try hard to forgive her, but if you can't then you're completely justified and you don't really owe her anything really anyway."

I think you have approached this situation in a very mature and well thought out manner and I commend you for your maturity. I think that trust can always be rebuilt, but it takes two to tango. I think your skepticism is completely justified given the information provided. Her initial reaction to lie is worrisome; may predict guilt or fear of hurting you. I don't know. Regardless I think that you clearly care for her. I hope your relationship ends happily and if she really did stop him then I think it will.  Have a great day friend.  Kind regards,  Justin Dunkin"

relationship_advice,3dr8fi,JustinDunk1n,2,Sat Jul 18 18:33:52 2015 UTC,"The simplest thing you can do is sit her down and be honest. Say that you are willing to give her another shot regardless of the fact that her first reaction was to lie to you. Explain how you have lost a bit in trust in her. Just be honest about how you feel inside. I think honesty and good morals are the foundation of every healthy relationship. Respecting each other's boundaries. She knew she crossed over a boundary if she lied to you.  If you give her another shot explain some new boundaries(this is reasonable. Set boundaries that do not rely on her being honest to catch her in a lie. Test her honesty. It is very important that you date someone who is honest with you. In the long run your relationship will die without it.)  On the other hand, if you do not trust her and feel(or know) there are additional lies that are detrimental to your relationship you should bring those up.   I personally have been in a very similar situation and I had to cut ties so I can relate to you a lot. You have to have enough self respect to understand that this person just may not be the one and that there is someone else out there waiting for you who is honest and will not cross boundaries and follow it up with a lie. Liars are very tricky people because you never know how deep their lies go.  Don't overthink the situation; go with your instincts. You seem very mature when it comes to relationships.  I genuinely hope you find a solution to your issue.  Kind regards,  Justin Dunkin"

relationship_advice,3dr5u0,asdasFASFACasdasx,3,Sat Jul 18 17:41:46 2015 UTC,"Okay this is the classic catfish scenario. If you do not know what that is, go watch the show. This person shows all of the signs. They are using you for attention or amusement. I would cut ties with them and move on. I am sorry if you are vulnerable in terms of relationships, but I do not have any light way of giving you advice except for bluntness. This is a MAJOR issue you will be affected by in future relationships if you continue to talk to this person. The fact that they do not respect you, while in a ""relationship"", is a big red flag. I could go on and on pointing out every bit that points to them being a catfish, but that would be redundant. You seem like an intelligent person and you wouldn't be here unless you were worried about the situation at hand. Follow your instincts. Most importantly realize that dating over the internet is a very, very bad idea these days. It is the new form of long distance relationships.  I wish you the best of days and good luck in finding the advice you are searching for.  Kind regards,  Justin Dunkin"
relationship_advice,3dr5u0,JustinDunk1n,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:47:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it seems possible, but unlikely for just a few reasons. 1. Being that I did reverse search every image shes sent me, which has been multiple and I couldn't find anything. This being on every reverse image site I could find. 2. She has a fairly uncommon name I wouldn't expect someone to just come with, but it's possible. Not really a solid point. 3. I did find out her IP once because like you, I was worried about this possibility, and her ip is geographically where she told me she is from. 4. I do have a friend she has spoke to on the mic before, a little ways back. 5. She said that she would be willing to use cam/mic in the future. And she genuinely does have bad internet and it's not hard to see that from my perspective. Besides this I don't think any of it is DEFINITE proof, and it's not like I met her on a dating site. OF course it's still a possibility that what you say is correct, but I definitely think if that was the scenario I should wait it out a bit longer and see, rather than jump to conclusions and permanently damage the relationship by asking for proof, or even end it. I don't lose much by waiting it out. Edit: one smaller but decently sized thing I forgot to mention. She sold her original account on the game I met her, presumably for me. That's what I mean by she got some money to come and see me sometime later. And she definitely did sell this account, because I saw it up on the website and also that person has played on it when she was playing another things like that. Edit#2: This on top of her story always being consistent, except for literally the birthday thing. That's the only discrepancy this entire time I could find. Again, nothing is definitive proof, except for literally camming/hearing her voice and stuff, which I'm still not sure will never happen."
relationship_advice,3dr5u0,JustinDunk1n,2,Sat Jul 18 18:00:17 2015 UTC,"I see you are stubborn or set on the idea of dating this person. It probably stems from the fact that it is your first relationship and that you are trying to make it the ideal one you always dreamed of(subconsciously people do this. There are studies if you are interested that support this fact. It is how most people learn to interact intimately with a significant other initially. Think of a scientific experiment. You pose a question, create a hypothesis, and asses what you were right/wrong about based on the results.). This is natural and a perfect reason why most first relationships(usually in middle school, but in your case at a later age) do not work. Instead of going piece by piece how your comment reinforced my argument, I will pick out one key fact that is impossible to argue with.  ""... rather than jump to conclusions and permanently damage the relationship by asking for proof,...""   This above statement is indicative of how unhealthy and fragile your current relationship is. If you are unable to make an honest request because you fear she will shun you, WTF are you doing dating this person? Relationships are built on a foundation of trust, honesty, and connection. Without those things you will never be able to truly connect. I am sorry if I came off as blunt but teenagers are very stubborn.   I hope that whatever decision you make, ends in happiness.

But thing is I haven't really explicitly asked for proof yet, and I think it'd be wrong to just end it without at least asking first. The only thing I really meant by that though, is I'm not sure right now is the appropriate time to ask about it, so I was thinking on waiting til things where better.

His feelings for her are only going to grow if this continues. Being possessive isn't always a bad thing. She's your girlfriend. Not his. That means she should respect you and your wishes to remain exclusive by not hanging out alone with a guy she knows likes her. It's unfair to you. It's also pretty easy for her to make a mistake in this situation. It sounds dangerous.

My bf is fron a neighboring country with a quite similar culture as mine but still he is home sick a lot. You shouldn't underestimate how great a connection to your home/culture is. But it sounds like she focusing on that guy a little too much. So talk to her abd ask her why she is spending so much time with him.
relationship_advice,3dqwz4,JustinDunk1n,-4,Sun Jul 19 15:23:37 2015 UTC,"I don't see her actions yet as anything worrisome. She found someone who is similar to her culturally and they might make great friends. I think that, unless she has done untrustworthy things in the past, you are overthinking the situation. If she genuinely cares for you she will not do anything besides do exactly what she has said: Show him around. He probably feels like he has been put into a whole new world and she may relate to that. Stay calm, don't overthink it, and wait until she gets back. If you believe that this is a serious problem sit down with her and be honest about your feelings. That is a great exercise in maturing how you date. A lot of people are afraid to be honest because they fear conflict. In most cases honesty is the most healthy thing couples can do in this situation. Try and be as gentle and open as you can; don't be rude or blunt to her. Don't let your paranoia affect your judgement or your emotions.  I hope you have a great day friend.

Ha !  You can love someone but can you live with them ? are you both able to deal with adversity in the same way ? can you resolve the ""which way does the toilet paper go on the holder"" argument without losing your mind ? I didnt live with my first and I was your age, what a nightmare, we were incompatible sexually (I didnt know how low her libido was before we married because we were never able to have sex on a regular basis) nit picky and obsessive over every little thing and had a million pet peeves that took about a year into marriage to surface. Not to mention our different taste in furniture. We eventually divorced.  I never repeated that and I was headed towards marriage a second time but I derailed it because I was miserable living with her. Although I am easy to live with and have done so for the past 20 years with the same person.  Unless you guys are fundamentalist christians living together is does not have the stigma used to have, its very common these days.  And why is she so concerned about what others think ?  I would stick to your guns because living with someone you cant get along with is hell and divorce is an even bigger hell.

You have your entire life ahead of you, and you're in an awesome position to bring someone into it.   Put yourself out there and continue to better yourself.

relationship_advice,3ds9p5,Diplomatum,2,Sun Jul 19 00:10:23 2015 UTC,"Hi, good on you that leaving her is not an option. My advice to you would be to maybe sit her down and talk about it, toddler out of the house, just the two of you, over a bottle of wine or something like that. More than likely, there is a reason why she is demotivated and lacks energy. This sounds like the following to me:    Immaturity on her part; You're older so naturally you're more mature and see red alerts where she does not. You guys need to plan your future together and she needs to realize that as parents, life is going to be different, like it or not.  Possible depression. Could it be that her lazyness is a catalyst for a lingering depression? It's quite common when having to grow up as fast as she has to, being only 22 y/o. Her single friends are out dating tinderguys and partying all night long while she has to stay at home and be an adult. Could be she feels she is missing out on a part of her life.  It's hurting the relationship. You need to make her understand that this is an issue for you. She needs to be more involved.  Bad habit inheritance. How is her parents house? Could this be something she has inherited from her parents, thinking ""It's ok, it's just how it is supposed to be""?    That's all i can think of for now. Wish you best of luck in working this out!"
relationship_advice,3ds9p5,bladedada,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:51:49 2015 UTC,"Thank You for the great response. You're probably right, a sit down in the house without a toddler would probably be a good scenario.  The toddler is definitely a distraction or subject-changer when we talk.   If I assume it's immaturity, which I suspect it is in part, I don't know how to confront it without backlash. ""You think you're more mature than me!?""  I am concerned that depression could be a cause. I didn't know if I was being dramatic to think of it.  I hear that after a woman has a child many get depressed. Her parents were definitely like this.  Mother was far more aggressive but did nothing.  Father did everything and upon his recent passing, the house was in shambles.  Her mother didn't know how to cook or mow the lawn.  It seems obvious now that you mention that she may be stuck in that mentality but I never even made that connection."

relationship_advice,3ds9ew,Diplomatum,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:34:48 2015 UTC,"You only briefly mentioned it, but it seems like the reason you're afraid to leave suddenly is that you own things together, and you want to break up while hopefully keeping the apartment, or the dog, or half of the stuff you two co-own, and stuff like that?  Go into more detail about that stuff. Why are you reluctant to break up with her?  (If she really is extremely manipulative, and you don't have a good reason to stay, then leave. You don't need a good reason to leave, and you don't have to prove it to her like you're on an episode of Judge Judy. It's your life.)"

Well, I'm reluctant to do it because of my past experiences where I've always ended up being ""the bad guy"" by the other party. I guess what I'm looking for is insights by others who have had better experiences when breaking up.   You see, for her, everything is all peaches, but for me it is not. However, she is unaware of this, so when i lay this on her it's going to come as a big surprise. When surprises come, so do the questions, and when they come, I need to know how to treat this the right way to avoid defaulting to the ""nice guy""-mode, brush it all away and give her a 95th chance.."
relationship_advice,3ds9ew,adamdesautel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:38:44 2015 UTC,"When surprises come, so do the questions [...]   If you want to break up with her, that is your choice, and your right as a human being. Cue dramatic music. You don't owe her any questions, especially if she's manipulative, doesn't put effort in the relationship, and is just overall an unpleasant human being.  Sure, you can give her that closure, but do that after the breakup if you're worried about being able to stand up for yourself in the moment. Break up with her, she'll start in with the questions, and just tell her you don't want to talk about it yet. Get all your stuff, move out, yada yada, and then once you're free and clear of any control she could have over you, then meet her for coffee and tell her why you broke up with her (as in, past tense broke up).  This is not the advice I would normally give; usually you should just be completely upfront and honest, address her concerns and emotions, and stand your ground if the person tries to argue their way back into a relationship. If you're concerned about your overall passiveness, especially in the heat of the moment, then break up first, and have the break up discussion afterward.   I've always ended up being ""the bad guy"" by the other party.   I'm going to say this as bluntly as I can: Who gives a fuck. In a perfect world, everyone would love you and accept everything you do. No matter what decisions you make in life, you can't please everyone. Especially ex-girlfriends.  If your overall question in your original post is something like, ""How do I break up in a respectful way to not hurt her feelings?"" then that is a completely legitimate question, and you are a good person for considering her feelings in all of this.  But it doesn't sound like that's the case. It seems like you're more concerned about her opinion of you, post-breakup. That's an issue for you and your therapist; probably something to do with mommy issues (I have them) or your self worth being rooted in what others think of you (I have that problem too).  Plus, she does not seem to give you any consideration within the relationship, so I don't feel she really deserves your respect and soft-padding-landing during the breakup. She'll get upset; so what?"

I don't even know if I want a friendship with him right now, but I feel like he's pushing it on me.   From your title I though he also wanted the sex but if it's just the friendship then that means he still values you as a friend and a person but he just doesn't harbor romantic or sexual feelings for you.  The breakup likely has nothing to do with you so  A) stop beating yourself up about it.  B) Decide if you can or cannot be friends with him, maybe ask him for some time apart to settle your feelings a bit before you decide."

If you don't want a friendship, then that's the end of the discussion. You don't need to justify anything, or prove yourself to anyone. You were broken up with; whatever you are feeling is valid, and you don't need to give a reason why you don't want to be friends, other than you just don't feel it.   I'm scared that there's something wrong with me, I'm scared that I'm going to be unable to meet someone new.   I don't know you, or your personality, or what you look like, but this is very likely untrue. The ""plenty of fish in the sea"" cliche really is true. Yes, you absolutely will meet someone new. Source: Every time I've broken up with someone, I've had this exact feeling you're describing, and every time, I have found someone new.  Although I know that after a breakup, someone telling me I'll find someone just as good or better... doesn't really help, because I still feel the same way."

relationship_advice,3ds8rz,sumg,2,Sun Jul 19 09:44:29 2015 UTC,"Friendship is not a unilateral decision.  He's not wrong for wanting to maintain the friendship, but you aren't wrong either for wanting a bit of space.  Don't feel bad about doing what you need to do to get back on your feet.  One point frequently gets understated when a relationship ends like this.  There is a significant difference between the person who ends the relationship and the person who has the relationship end.  In your case, you mention that he told you that he had been 'faking it' for months.  This means he had plenty of time to come to the decision to end the relationship and make peace with it.  I'd wager he thought about this decision for at least weeks and possibly months.  You had this decision sprung on you without that same luxury (maybe not out of nowhere, but not ready for it either).  It shouldn't be surprising that you need a bit more time than him before being friendly."

relationship_advice,3dr4io,dating-bastard,2,Sat Jul 18 17:30:11 2015 UTC,"I feel for you. I have experienced my fair share of this situation. Humans set up walls in their mind from things that affect them negatively. Her brain probably subconsciously did this to protect it from the negative feelings she was feeling from the emotional trauma she experienced as a  young woman. Sadly this leads to other issues such as dating people who cause similar emotional trauma(I think it is a subconscious wish to fix the problem you faced as a younger adult. To break down that wall because at some point they in some way become aware it exists.)  If you love this woman I would sit her down and explain to her your feelings. Tell her you understand her fear and that you will not hurt her like the previous people did.  THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART: She needs therapy. If it is a touchy subject, think of a way to lightly bring it up. If she gets defensive tell her that you care for her and that is the only reason you brought it up.   IF SHE IS INTERESTED/WILLING TO GO TO THERAPY: State that you are willing to sit with her through therapy sessions if she needs emotional support. This has two big impacts: It shows your dedication and it might reduce the stress she feels. Some people have fear of therapy, and it is perfectly natural.  If you think the relationship is not repairable I am sorry. On the other hand you still have every right to approach her as a friend to try and support her. Make it completely clear to her that regardless of whether you are in an intimate relationship you will always be there to support her.  I hope you both have a wonderful day and good luck!

This has two big impacts: It shows your dedication and it might reduce the stress she feels. Some people have fear of therapy, and it is perfectly natural.   She goes to therapy (only started opening up about what she talks about with the therapist last week), I have considered asking her if she is open to let me in with her.  I doubt she will be ok with that, but who knows?  She knows I am dedicated, the main problem is that she's kind of given up on life (to a degree).  Not in the suicidal way, but in the not wanting to commit to anything she can't control.  And I get that 100%.  I am divorced too, and I was fucked over really badly.    I guess I'm slowly coming to the realization that this is relationship has probably run it's course.  If she's not able to do the personal development for herself and want to do it for herself (and me tangentially) then this is not the type of person I would want to have children with.  I hope we stay friends for the rest of our lives, but I need someone very strong and independent and loving if we were to have children.  I always ask myself the question: what if I die?  Is she going to be able to be a great mom and dad to our kids if that happens?  I think that I would be good at both and would put the needs of my family ahead of my own needs which is the type of person I need if I am ever going to have children.  This girl is so great though that I've considered never having children.  That's how much I value our companionship."

My inability to commit to relationships destroyed the best one I've ever had with the most amazing woman I've ever known.  She does need to speak to someone.  This isn't an issue with your relationship, it's an issue with her personally.  Until she addresses the underlying cause she will likely never commit to you the way you want her to.  Worse, if she does commit in this current state, she has a significant possibility of bailing out in a crisis.  I'm speaking from experience.  It's not hard to overcome but she has to make the conscious decision to do it and put in the effort to follow through."

I am concerned/saddened by how she's let her ex-husband and depression completely give up on the what life could be.  Anyway, we're taking it slow, I convinced her that in order to stay friends we should take time to gradually break up.  The same way we gradually grew together.  I can still be a part of her life and stand by her if she wants but at least I'm not held back by her lack of personal development.  I have to move forward and she understands that."

Since that one incident where you basically don't trust your girlfriends accounting of events, nothing has happened. She has even stopped going out as much for you.  The fact she is limiting her drinks and makes sure to call you on nights out completely contradicts your opinion that she has no control - she is literally making sure she says in control of herself for you.

She may have some insecurities regarding her physical attractiveness. My advice is to sit her down and explain to her that you find her to be the most beautiful person in the world. Explain to her how you feel about her. You never know she may think you are not physically interested in her or are cheating? These kinds of responses stem from a numerous amount of anomalies from both people in the relationship. Just be honest with each other.

Thats totally chiche, but I would describe it to be like the relationship you have with your parents, siblings, best friend in the world, or grandparents . You couldnt really imagine being without them, can you? and you dread the day you lose them. This person becomes an obsession and a way of life. They also give you butterflies, there is SO much sexual attraction (this is more of a personal thing. just remember to find someone who matches your sexual needs), and you would sacrifice your own happiness to make them happy. Even when the butterflies go away, you still enjoy your time with them. Remember that love is when you have 2 INDIVIDUAL people come together to form something greater than themselves. The 2 can still have separate lives. They just are moving about life together, as partners.  The only way you will ever know a girl is into you is if you ask, but you must put effort forth if you want a girlfriend. You have to find your confidence, personal strengths, and style. Everyone has those things, and everyone has to find those things. Basically that requires knowing who you are"
relationship_advice,3dqw4d,ageekyninja,2,Sat Jul 18 16:40:14 2015 UTC,"Dating a girl and moving it into a relationship. This is not so simple but also not a science. First things first it is hard to date someone in your ""friend group"" it can be a success, but it can be awkward if it doesn't work out. Keep that in mind.  The beginning takes effort. I got to college and decided to put more effort into becoming friendly with the ladies. Through this I would keep my eye out for people who piqued my interest.   Making friends was easy, but trying to move things further than that was downright embarrassing in the beginning. But that's the beauty, for every failed move you gain experience. Slowly I got better at interacting as more than friends.  The best way to move along with this is to ask the girls you have interest in to just hang out. My girlfriend and I started off by just rock climbing together, we slowly realized we enjoyed each other company. This moved into dates, which then moved into our steady relationship.  If you want a girlfriend you need to be able to accept a no. After that you need to make friends. Then move into just having the balls to ask them out. If things move well then you can go for the strike. You're still young so the issue of meeting people isn't there for you yet. Good luck with your endeavors."

But now I have found someone who I truly love.  And to tell you its the greatest thing in the world would be an understatement.  Love is the most beautiful and yet some times frustrating thing in this world.  It's hard to give someone that much of yourself because it makes you feel venerable but once you completely give 100% of yourself to the right person it is amazing.  I feel that finding someone to love is the meaning of life.  It is simply amazing.  I had all but given up on finding someone, I mean I was 24 and never had a relationship.  I thought I was doomed to spend my life alone but then it all of a sudden just happened I didn't plan on it happening I didn't try to make it happen it just did.  There are two types of guys in this world, aggressive type who can go out and get any girl whenever they want because they have a certain kind of confidence that makes it easy for them to approach women.  Then there are the shy guys who don't have this confidence and for them they require a women who isn't afraid to make the first move.  I did make the first move with my current gf but only because she was sending me such strong signals that she wanted me she wasn't playing games she was just very obvious about it and that made it easy for me to make my move.  Sometime it takes time to find someone but it will happen.  Some women are very obvious with what they want and make it easy for you to tell they want you others like to play games and make it hard for a guy to figure it out.  But I'll tell you when you find that one special person you will know.  Every time I look into my girlfriends eyes I just feel like a warm blanket is wrapping around the two of us its a comforting feeling knowing someone loves you back as much as you love them.

That is a completely healthy emotion to feel. I would not worry about it, and I commend you for coming here to ask for advice.  Onto the questions you asked!   Am I kind of cheating? Cheating, at least in my opinion, is physical contact you are aware would be detrimental to your relationship. The answer, given the information, is no. You seem curious. And guess what? Humans are very curious creatures. Teenagers are often more curious then other age groups(hormones and puberty, brain development, etc affect this). Ex: You and your significant other explained boundaries. You know you are encroaching upon those boundaries but you disregard them for your personal wants. Be it attention, sex, etc.  Is this actually ok? I am guessing ""this"" refers to finding them attractive. Yes. Finding other women attractive is a healthy sign. You not active on it says you have good morals, and you should be proud of it. Are my feelings for my gf not strong? I am not sure. I have not been give enough examples of your relationship. I would say that if I had to guess it would be that you DO care a lot for your girlfriend. My logic surrounds your being here asking for advice and the fact that while other girls are attractive and seem interesting you do not act on your curiosity or lust.   You have a bright future in dating. Be honest with your girlfriend about what you are feeling if you think she is open minded and mature enough to understand how you are feeling. This is to produce a system of honesty between you and to prove to her your loyalty to your relationship. It also, if she is mature in terms of dating(doubtful due to your age, but this is an EXCELLENT exercise for you both) she will understand all of this.  I hope you both have a long, healthy, and loving relationship.  Kind regards,  Justin Dunkin"

Monogamy doesn't mean you aren't interested, it means you don't act on that interest.   So: Unless your girlfriend doesn't mind, don't flirt.

Or are you projecting your idea of getting back together onto the situation? You mention wanting to get back together. However, you should understand that the reason for the breakup (Distance) hasn't changed. If you started dating tomorrow, chances are good that it would remain a problem.  I feel you should not text her. It seems like you are still reeling from the break up, and any conversation would be subconsciously motivated by the fact you want to date again. I'd give it more time and then attempt contact when I was in a better frame of mind.   Best of luck!"

relationship_advice,3dq7aq,boba-boba,3,Sat Jul 18 11:15:56 2015 UTC,"yesterday a client vomited in our bathroom and left a mess. Nobody was willing to clean it up, and I really had to pee and was already having the absolute worst day of my life, so I did it.   Where was your manager during all this? Why didn't he/she just assign someone to clean up the mess? A manager should have also made sure he/she didn't lose three people because two of them decided to heckle the one cleaning.  Secondly, while joking about you cleaning up vomit is stupid and juvenile and pointless, this looks like a situation where you're upset more because of the ""crippling fear of vomit"" you have than about the heckling. Their jokes weren't funny, but it was insulting more because of feelings they weren't aware of.   she went on to say ... I only care about it right now because I've sat at home and thought about it for so long   Her statement's not wrong. What she's getting at is, wondering why you waited until that evening to talk to everyone -- and do it through text -- if it bothered you so much.   If you're going to ask for an apology, which means you're about to have a serious conversation about feelings, it should be done in person, not through text. It's too easy to take your text and just read what they want to read. Via text there's too much time to twist words, apply different context, etc.   If I were you, I'd start a talk in person about this tomorrow, and offer an apology for being hyper-sensitive for a reason she wasn't aware of. But also, tell her that you didn't find the joking funny, and next time there's body fluid in the bathroom, she can clean it herself."
relationship_advice,3dq7aq,griminald,2,Sat Jul 18 12:24:15 2015 UTC,"First of all, stop gossiping about the incident with other coworkers. It looks unprofessional and honestly it will make A's position stronger. Even if they're also your friends, you need to be aware of the fact that there is a workplace dynamic involved. You are also putting all of them in the very uncomfortable situation of having to choose sides.   Secondly, be polite to A at work but stand your ground in halting the friendship. Even if she does apologize, this sounds like a toxic person who will stab you in the back later. The friendship is over, but maintain a civil working environment. If A is rude at work and you are calm and polite, she will be the one ruining her reputation, not you.  Since I doubt a vet clinic has an HR, talk to whomever is in charge of the workers. Office manager, head vet, whatever. Let this person know about the heckling in a calm, non-emotional, and factual statement and ask for some kind of policy going forward on who is responsible for cleaning bathrooms, etc."

relationship_advice,3dpxfp,altshubi,3,Sat Jul 18 08:24:12 2015 UTC,"Well I hope your not homophobic or threatened or feel insulted by his confession  ? The first thing I would do is say you are very flattered but your sorry to say that your not gay and dont feel the same way about him. I would then continue on as normal (and even say you hope we can contunue being friends as you have been) , go to the movie, go to the party and stay at his place. If he is a half decent person which he sounds like he is then he will be polite and respectful, its unlkely he will try to force the issue.  If he has a hard time with this and becomes difficult to deal with then think about discontinuing these social interactions for his sake.  Sure he could be attracted to you physically but he may also be attracted to you because your there, your nice to him, your a good friend and you care. It may be more like infatuation than actual real love.  Of course there is an overall question that in light of all this new information from his confession do you still want to be friends with this guy ? I mean its one thing being friends, perhaps you dont feel as good a friend to him as he feels about you  ? All that drama could be too much coming from someone you regard as a casual friend ? If you dont feel that close of a friend and dont want to be his friend then because he he is going through a very tough time so I would suggest backing away from him slowly.  Over all what I am suggesting is be kind to him, be his friend if he still wants to be and you still want to be. If you dont want to be friends with him any longer then be kind and withdraw slowly. If you really really dont want to be friends then dont let your self be trapped in this friendship out of guilt but be kind and slowly withdraw."

If you're in the UK, your GP will be your first port of call  Step 2. Your doctor will take a history, do some examination and request some investigations, including those looking at reversible causes of cognitive impairment. They can also formally assess his cognition or refer him onwards to a specialist for this.   Step 1.2. You and your mother need to make other arrangements so your father doesn't drive anymore."

I don't think staying with him because he stepped up to the plate to help you is a reason he would want you to stay.  The thought of the work needed to get a college degree, especially when you are working full time can feel like it's never going to happen. That is how it was for me. My wife convinced me to just take one class. I found it pretty easy once I got started, so the following semester I took two. Once I got going it seemed much more realistic to finish, but it was really hard to start. It might be easier to tackle things with him by breaking it down into smaller steps. Don't think about getting a degree three years from now, just think about finishing one class. Maybe ask him to just update his resume and don't really think about the work in finding a new job."
relationship_advice,3dosbg,werewolf35,9,Sat Jul 18 02:53:23 2015 UTC,"Your post is written clearly, so I think I get the gist of the situation. The real problem seems to be you sensing his discontent. You say if he was happy where he's at, you may not mind. But he's clearly not. I think this sort of initiative has to come from within. Maybe just let him know that when he finds out what he wants to do to make a big change in his life, you'll be there to support him 100%. Maybe feeling that you have his back will help him be brave and make some decisions about his future. Good luck."

relationship_advice,3dosbg,shana_nigans,5,Sat Jul 18 14:36:44 2015 UTC,"I feel you. I am in a somewhat similar situation except my SO is disabled and lacks ambition. Disability aside the lack of ambition thing is already frustrating and sometimes I feel like his parent which I hate. Add in the disability it's a whole layer of trouble with shifting power dynamics and feelings of guilt. I am still with my SO and love him very much, and lately he HAS improved. What worked in my case were a series of deep heart to heart talks with some drinks to lower both our inhibitions and me laying my heart out on the table. Basically I outlined why his lack of ambition bothered me in ways that weren't confrontational but not condescending. A lot of ""what if 5 years you had a degree and maybe we can buy a house?"" Basically tangible goals that we can strive for together. Again, this took place over MONTHS...and my SO has also been neater around the apartment. I think a large part of his messiness was due to depression. anyways, that's my experience with the matter. pm me if you want to talk."
relationship_advice,3dosbg,Qikdraw,2,Sat Jul 18 02:21:59 2015 UTC,"I feel like he is depressed, which I can understand completely. He just leaves me in the dark as to how I can help and anything I try is met with resistance.   A genuine thank you for the response though. I understand where you are coming from, and appreciate the work you seem to put into the relationship. (Not to mention being able to hear from a person WITH an SO with a disability. As the person with the disability, I know I'm not the only one going through this and thank my SO every step of the way.)   I would hug you if I could. Thank you."
relationship_advice,3dosbg,tonylee0707,3,Sat Jul 18 02:30:48 2015 UTC,"I can relate. A lot of times I can tell he's not happy with his lot in life. Especially in terms of career/jobs. I try to be supportive but there only so much you can do. I'm not super ambitious but I have changed jobs 3 times in the last 3 years and have doubled my income. I can't help but feel that if only he applied himself more things would get better. And, like you, I can see so much potential in him! But I realize that true change can only come when he is driven by internal desire. A lot of my attempts at helping with suggestions are met with exasperated sighs...I think he feels insecure about it and shrugs it off...but in the last few months he's made more of an effort. In my case I think the catalyst was moving to a different town where he could be more independent. Maybe you can ask him what his dream job is and try to figure out the steps needed to get there. It's a bit overwhelming and he probably thinks it's hopeless and defaults to doing nothing. I also recommend The Power of Habit. It's an interesting book and motivated both of us to change our daily habits and examine our bad habits."

relationship_advice,3dosbg,Qikdraw,4,Sat Jul 18 02:51:58 2015 UTC,"Wow, two MBAs! That is amazing, go you! And I'm sure you still have a lot to bring to a relationship, look at how willing you are to try to look at things from multiple perspectives? That's a big part of a relationship right there, and a good thing to have.  You two started dating at a pretty young age, when a lot of things can change about a person. When you're 17 or 19 you have different outlooks and goals in life than in mid to late 20s. Life priorities shift. Maybe they have shifted for you, but they haven't for him yet. Maybe they never will with him, but the tough part is only you can really decide if you can accept that or not.  I think you might have to think a little objectively about this. It's honestly impossible to be with someone expecting or hoping that they change, instead of accepting them for who they are. He's accepted you, it sounds. What if this is who he is? Can you think of times when he has shown motivation and dedication in achieving goals? Has that changed over the years? Does he live on his own, and take pretty good care of his own responsibilities? Could you accept him if he didn't make an effort to be motivated in the future? If he has stepped up in helping you so much with your MS, why do you only think he'll help minimally (as a shoulder to cry on) in the future?  To me, while it isn't good to rush marriage, you've been together for 8 years. Not seeing marriage as an eventual end result (on his side) seems a bit weird. But maybe he is feeling that way because he isn't picturing that far ahead in life at all.   Please don't sell yourself short for being in a wheelchair, whether you had this disability or not, it sounds as if you two have different mind sets as you are very driven whereas he has a different way of handling things. Trying to change him will only end up being stressful, if he wants to pursue his own goals it will have to come from within him, not from you. You can encourage him but.. He has to be the one to decide. And it's up to you whether you can accept that. I've learned this from experience and it can suck. :( I hope you find the answers you're looking for, OP."
relationship_advice,3dosbg,Qikdraw,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:23:17 2015 UTC,"Wow! I love your post!   I'm not out to change this guy, but I want him to follow his passions as much as HE says he wants to. It's funny that you ask if I can remember a time where he has shown motivation, and no. I can't. He just recently moved out so learning to take care of his own responsibilities is also a new thing.   I don't know if I could accept that this is the way he is, even though that's what it seems to be. He talks about wanting different stuff. And with my MS ge gas stepped up but I think he will only be a shoulder to cry on because that's all he's ever done. When he feels he has hit a wall, he kid of throws up his hands and stops trying. If my health gets worse, I think that wall will come. (Funny now that I've typed that all out. He doesn't accept help or learn from experience, and then goes on to complain about where he is in life and wants better.)  I agree with the not thinking about marriage because he probably doesn't think that far ahead in the future. That's kind of related to what I'm having a problem with. There are some underlying issues other people here have picked up on and I'm trying what I know to help.   And that last paragraph made me tear up a little. I agree with all of it.   Thank you for your input. I genuinely appreciate it. :)"
relationship_advice,3dosbg,Jooana,2,Sat Jul 18 15:40:51 2015 UTC,"I mean, what the hell am I bringing to the table? I'm in a wheelchair.    This is really sad for me to read. And honestly gets me a little hot under the collar. Why? 'I' am disabled. No I am not in a wheelchair, but I've lived with severe scoliosis all my life. Now 33 years after surgery to straighten my spine I am in constant pain. I take a bunch of pills, call out sick at work, not because I'm sick, but because its another day I am just in too much pain. But you know what? I've been married 15 years and I am the sole breadwinner in my family right now. My wife who used to be a lawyer is extremely smart and coming off 10 years of being a writer she is trying to get back into the working world, which doesn't take well to absences of work like that. I work as hard as I can, I bring a lot not only to my relationship but to my company. I am not the best employee, but I am by far not the worst.   OP, you saying what you said I feel belittles not only yourself, but every other disabled person out there, that we aren't good enough. That we are a burden. That no one could love us because of a disability. NEVER and I mean NEVER think of yourself like that. You bring a fuckton of a lot to the table! Working on two MBAs? Extremely driven? Good god woman! Do you know how many companies would love to have people like that? How many people would love to have you as a partner? You are NOT a burden, and please, don't ever think of yourself like that ever.  As for your boyfriend? Well I was him at one point. In my early 20s (44 now). And oddly enough had a girlfriend who was extremely ambitious. She's now a VP of a health insurance company and one day will probably become CEO. After five years together we broke it off, the last two years we both knew it was over, but kept on because both of us were scared to be alone. We bit the bullet and while it hit me harder than it hit her, it was the right decision for us. Her decision had more to do with me not being a 'professional'. Not working in an office or not in a career field. I worked in kitchens, retail and working QA in a video game company, and no, not the greatest jobs but jobs that paid the bills and allowed me to save a bit of money. And honestly, yes that was enough for me at the time. In the end this is why she wanted to end it with me, which hurt me as I had helped her a lot in her personal growth, but it was the right thing to do. We simply were not compatible long term. If we had gotten married we would have been divorced a long time ago. I think you guys are in the same position. You need to think about your future and where you want to be, and if he is the partner you want long term, or if you want someone with drive like you. Stop looking at the things he has done for you, stop looking at if this would hurt him, look at where YOU want to be in five years and ask yourself if being married to him at that point makes you happy or sad.  I'm sorry about the wall of text. I started writing and I kind of just vomited all the words out. Sorry bout that. I hope you find your center with who you are and how you are an awesome person, because of your life's struggles and what those difficulties in life have taught you. They have made you the person you are today, which IS an awesome person. Don't forget that."

I would NEVER put down a disabled person and I am sorry that what I said implies anything about someone else. I think no less of someone else for a disability, I think less of me.  Where this comes from is that MS is unpredictable, so I fear I will decline to a point of being helpless. I am angry with myself for being disabled and fear I will contribute nothing. It's a fear, and it's cowardly. I know a disabled person has worth.   What I admire about you is the fact that you are not like me, you didn't seem to let your disability get in the way or define you. Your post gave me a swift kick in the rear that I needed.

This is a valid fear, I can understand that. My fear is that I won't have made a difference, that I will not be remembered. That nothing I have done will matter. I don't want to be famous I just want to have been remembered by a few people. But you have to put those fears behind you and just be the best you that you can be. You are worth something and you do have a lot to contribute. Intellectually you know this, but its the emotions that hold sway.   Are you doing any therapy? Not for your body, but for your head. You may want to look into that and see if it will help. Talking with people does help. What helped me a lot was that I found an online group of people with scoliosis, and just talking with them helped out immensely. They understood where I came from, they understand the pain and frustrations. No one I know in person has scoliosis, not even my wife can understand. Just like I cannot understand what pains she gets. Maybe try finding an online forum of people like you. I think that may help you.   What I admire about you is the fact that you are not like me, you didn't seem to let your disability get in the way or define you   The thing is I was born with this. It didn't happen to me later in life, like how scoliosis normally happens. I didn't have to adapt to a new way my body wanted to behave. So, I have always been making allowances for what I can and cannot do. You had a lot of years where you were fine, so its completely understandable that you have times where you just hate it and it start hitting your mental reserves and you get into a funk. I do not know how I would be if I didn't have my whole childhood to prepare for limitations in adulthood. With the drive you have and the education you're working on you are doing very very well! No bullshit. You are, you just need to believe it.   Thank you. Thank you so much!   You're welcome, and if you ever need to, please PM me. I'll be more than willing to chat at any time.

relationship_advice,3dosbg,shana_nigans,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:52:51 2015 UTC,"I want to give you advice but without much life experience myself, man, its hard.  When I had my first panic attack on Nov 2014, it cleaved my life into a clear before and after. Before, I thought people with anxiety were just whining people who choose to worry. After, I finally learned that many don't choose to worry. I am a very confident person who never worries about anything. After the panic attack, I worried about everything and anything. I came to learn that it was all because my panic attack depleted a chemical in my brain called serotonin. It is responsible for sleep, sex drive, appetite and the bodily sensation and feeling of assurance and optimism (opposite of being worried). Once I took medication that replenished my serotonin, my worrying stopped.  There is also another chemical called dopamine. It is responsible for our reward system (in other words, our motivation). When one is in love or having a manic episode, their dopamine level is high which explains why people in love seem to do obsessive things that normally wouldnt.  Your SO's lack of motivation could be a lack of dopamine but sometimes, someone's lack of motivation cannot be explained simply by lack of dopamine. It could just be that he who he is. It could just be that he is content and satisfied with what he has now. Or it could be that he does have those plan, but now is not the right time to do it.   It reminds me that I have always wanting to quit smoking but much like your SO, I have been postponing it to tomorrow for about 10 years, waiting for a miracle day which I would have heaps of motivation. Nothing short of a life changing event would have made me quit. And what do you know? I quit the next day after my panic attack."

relationship_advice,3dosbg,starlounging,2,Sat Jul 18 14:32:05 2015 UTC,"I think the best way for you to help is either understand that may not be a motivated type of person full stop and accept him the way he is or be patient and wait for that one day he may turn around as a result of some life changing event.  I say this because it sounds like no matter how hard you try, it is not going to work. And if that is the case, might as well accept it.  Of course, that is easy for me to say...

It was so VERY tiring for him to dump ALL of his sadness on me. I had to express this to him a few times, and it did help. He never fully stopped, but OP I think this is worth you trying. Its always good to help, but it sucks when it gets to the point where you feel obligated to and it's starts to lose it's genuine nature. These are deep issues and you are not equipped to handle them since you aren't a professional. It'd be good to say something along the lines of ""I'm glad to help you but some of this stuff really is beyond me. Have you tried talking to a therapist?"". I'm sure there's a better way to word that, but you get what I'm saying.  If you don't want to directly address her suicide attempt, just redirect the conversation. You could say ""I'm glad you're ok"" and seek the next opportunity to change the subject. You don't have to do it in a rude way. You could talk about something you know would cheer her up so both of you benefit"
relationship_advice,3dpvd2,ageekyninja,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:13:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying.  Where she is there is no therapist she can access.  She is homeless in a ""developing nation"".  Sometimes there are community members I can access but recently the family that was letting her stay in their shed moved.  It's not really a matter of I can't handle all the sadness.  She's disabled, was kept locked up for most of her childhood, is highly dysfunctional...but making real progress.   She's family and I have experienced the family that dumped her.  My lack of professional training doesn't matter...we just keep moving forward because we have to.  I definitely will move to lighter subjects in direct reply to her email but I am seeking advice re a few concrete things I can ask her to implement when she is troubled.  She does respond.  If we pretty much drill something over several months she learns it and adapts.  I just don't know what.  Thanks again for replying."
relationship_advice,3dpvd2,cotiyote,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:34:22 2015 UTC,"This sounds like a very difficult situation. I think it's very encouraging that she is maintaining contact with you. If she were depressed to the point of successful suicide, I think in that case then she would probably withdraw. It's good to have her focus on what you want he to do, rather than on what you don't want her to do. For example; if she does something self-injurious, then instead of telling her how much you didn't want her to do that, instead express how happy you are that she is okay. Focusing on positive language and avoiding negative expressions are helpful, I think, in putting her thought stream on a better path. And encouraging her to seek professional help is good, though I don't know how available that will be in a developing country. Still, if there are hospitals, there might be a social worker or a psychiatrist/psychologist or counselor who can help her. I hope this was helpful somehow. You seem a very decent person who is doing the right thing to the best of your ability. I hope it works out for your family member."

What is your area of responsibility is who you choose to associate with. If you have such disrespect for her behavior, do you want to keep living with her and socializing with her? You may want to consider replacing yourself in the house by finding her another housemate and moving out. You can't change other people, so don't think you can stay there and just explain to her that she needs to behave more morally around you.

I would try and come off as honest as you can with him if you do decide to tell him. Be genuine, humane, and try to explain why you told him. Most people are reasonable and have great respect for honesty. Honesty can sometimes be hard. Given your situation? Dang. Either way I commend you for being here. You already are on a good path.  And don't beat yourself up. Humans get horny, we make mistakes, and that's how life works.

relationship_advice,3dmypz,oof11123,97,Fri Jul 17 16:09:04 2015 UTC,"No, that is not warranted or normal AT ALL. I don't think any couple splits every single thing 50/50. That's not possible--one person will always end up doing a little more, or paying a little more, or whatever. That's fine. But his insistence that you ""make up for"" your lower income by doing more chores is just insulting. He doesn't value your contribution to the marriage because you make less money (and clearly, money is very important to him), so he forces you to do all the household chores to increase your value. Not okay, IMO. If you both work full time outside the home, you should at least be trying to split housework somewhat evenly. If it were YOUR choice to do all the cooking/cleaning, that's okay, but you shouldn't be forced to take on the majority of chores when you also work full-time.  Honestly, it sounds like you two have different values when it comes to money, work, and gender roles. I'm not really sure how to approach issues like that except to talk it out with a counselor.  My situation: My husband makes a lot more money than I do, but we both work. Typically, he does most of the cooking and I do most of the cleaning. When he is extra busy at work, I do more of the household chores. When I'm extra busy at work, he does more of the household chores. We're a team and our incomes don't factor into that at all."

It doesn't entitle him to make financial decisions by himself either. It's his excuse to be lazy and try to enforce traditional gender roles on you. I don't understand why women marry these men in the first place. I don't believe that they just flipped a switch after getting married and suddenly can't be bothered to cook or do dishes. I'd make a list and split the chores. If he doesn't like that I would say fine, I'll go talk to a divorce attorney. He is treating her like his slave labor and that is not an equitable, or happy marriage  for someone to be in.   Edit - WAIT WAIT WAIT. He bought a car without asking you??? Oh no, that is a red flag and you need to call him on that bullshit. You are married and your financial responsibilities are intertwined. Screw his expensive tastes, he needs to ask first. It may be his money more than yours, but in the eyes of the law your entire income is split 50/50. If he loses that job and creditors come knocking they will ruin both your credit, not just his.

I would talk with him and explain that to denounce the stress you feel and then go so far as to say ""his job is more stressful simply because he makes more money"" is a load of horse crap. If he is not able to deal with the stress he should get a counselor before your marriage because a cliche ""woman takes care of the house. Man comes home from ""stressful"" job and disregards wife's feeling because society says he can."" He is honestly the epitome of how past gender roles have clouded the minds of many people. Making them consciously or subconsciously sexist and very repugnant with understanding the opposite sex.  TLDR:   I would say he has a lack of respect. Him not even giving credence to your stress is very worrisome. If he honestly will not help out with simple chores that is very disappointing. He is also projecting a very shallow ideal onto you: that somehow material things are synonymous with being successful in life. Don't let this prick do this to you."

I made less money, but I was still expected to do all of the housework.    I tried everything I could think of to help him understand that I was absolutely exhausted from not having a free moment.

A lot of people honestly think that they make more money then somebody else that they have a right to not do as much ""physical"" labor. They can also think they are entitled to not have to worry about as many everyday things because they are bringing in more money. It stems from a belief that bringing home money is the single most important part of a household. They get caught up on this superficial ideal and preach it like a religious bigot. I have witnessed this my entire life with my father. I have seen all of my friend's fathers(except one who's dad is altruistic and a better dad then most.) and the men and some women I am now peer to in college resign themselves to such ideals. It is sad but that is how our culture is evolving. In the future the trend might change, but for my generation and  the next it is akin to cancer."

Let me share MsAnthropic's Rules of Budgeting in a Relationship:   you need to live within the lower earner's budget. if the higher earner wants to live outside that budget but the lower earner doesn't, the higher earner should foot the difference. if both parties want to upgrade, the cost should be split proportional to income.   Him buying an Audi and making you foot the bill is ridiculous.  Chores.  Just because he makes more doesn't mean that you have to do all the work when you guys work the same hours.

relationship_advice,3dmypz,Nihilistic-Fishstick,27,Fri Jul 17 16:56:59 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, my boyfriend and I (been living together for 2.5 years) split everything proportionately.  Bills are paid proportionately to our incomes, and chores are done proportionately to our workload.  Money and time are independent and we do not let the two categories influence eachother. In this way we are both able to give the same percentage of ourselves to the relationship, and have an equal partnership.  We have a shared checking account where we both put a certain (predetermined) percentage of our paycheck in each week. We use this account to pay bills, go out to dinner, take trips, etc. The rest of our money is for us to do whatever we want.  For example, since you make half of what he makes, you would end up paying 1/3 of the bills and he would pay 2/3 (you would both put the same percentage of your paychecks into the account, and it would end up that ""your"" money would be 1/3 of the account and ""his"" would be 2/3).  Since you both work 40hrs/week, you would both do equal shares of the housework.  This model works really well for us, so it might be worth a try.  Good luck!"

As in, dishes is your job and garbage is his.  Instead view all the work that needs to be done as things you need to do as a team.  When there is stuff to do, have a conversation and discuss what you think if fair. As in, ""Babe, if I go grocery shopping, would you be able to load the dishwasher and clean the bathroom?""  Or,  ""while you cut the grass I am going to fold the laundry and vacuum!""  Also, try to thank eachother for doing what you do. ""Aw the grass looks awesome, good job!!"" or ""I noticed you unloaded the dishwasher already, thank you!""  :)  EDIT:  While I am at it, I will share my favorite article on lasting long term relationships.  It might help you two with how you talk to eachother and communicate.   Also, since he sees the way you bring things to him as an attack, maybe you can adjust your approach.

You are going to highlight your contributions and diminish his, that is human nature.  So, since you both think that you are doing the most work and that isn't possible, then this just simply boils down to a communication problem.    That is why I suggested more open communication about what is being done and appreciation for what the other has done.

Neither of you is blameless, and you both need to make changes and grow if you want this marriage to last.   I think you two can get through it though with some open conversation."

relationship_advice,3dmypz,Feeling_Of_Knowing,4,Fri Jul 17 22:11:02 2015 UTC,"Do NOT let him get away with that kind of talk.  He's being a manipulative ass.  You are not crazy.  You are not hormonal.  You have it on paper that he's not contributing.  You know the ""yaaardwork"" is bullshit.  Not to be a reddit cliche, but is the rest of your relationship pleasant?  Are you sure you want to spend your life with this guy?"

My God, do you realize you live with a raging sexist that thinks he should be able to steamroll right over you since he is the male? I can't believe guys like this even find girlfriends, let alone someone to marry them. My brother is just like this. Sits on his ass all day, doesn't work, doesn't do shit. The wife works, teaching, all day. Comes home and 3 out of 4 times has to cook for him, feed the dogs, and do laundry. All I can determine he does is sleep, eat, sleep some more and then spend the 4 or 5 hours she is home and awake talking about how bad teachers suck and are ruining our kids. Oh and instead of walking the trash 30 feet outside, he plays a game to see how high he can stack it and just how bad of a smell people will tolerate before whining the entire time that he has to take it out. He won't even do yard work. I caught him hiring a guy to do it and telling her he did it. Mind you, they struggle financially because he won't work. She is a pretty devout Christian that thinks people like the Duggars are great with their traditional roles so he runs all over her. If she left him, he would be homeless. Ok rant over. This post is just so eerily familiar to me. Oh plus he goes to pain management for his back and has a healthy addiction to opiates that has ruined his life. He is a Master's level EE too. It's friggin sad."
relationship_advice,3dmypz,2bass,13,Sat Jul 18 07:35:29 2015 UTC,Lack of respect definitely. You are married. You are supposed to be partners. Your husband/wife is the person you should trust most. The person who has your back and who you are best friends with. Does this describe how you feel?   If he goes out and buys expensive things and expects you to help pay for them something is terribly wrong. Either he is just a lazy guy or he wants to have you under his thumb. This whole post made me a bit sad. Back up and take care of yourself.
relationship_advice,3dmypz,pm_me_ur_idiocy,10,Fri Jul 17 21:18:40 2015 UTC,"Money shouldn't come into the house workload except in 3 situations :    one of the partner work less hours the partner who gain more use it to hire help the physical and mental stress of the job is highly different, and you absolutely can't do anything about it (changing the job would put the relationship in a very difficult position, etc).   What worked for us (10 years old couple, we both worked very different hours, different stress-level job, different earning,...) :   Discuss the budget : there should be no resentment from both part. Write down the number of theoretical hours worked, and effective hour worked (transport, work at home, etc) Calculate the difference (35h/w, 18h/w : the difference is 17h, it means that 2nd person work for 34% for the couple, and the other 66% for the couple). The task should be divided accordingly, with a corrected factor defined with what ""feel"" fair (34/66, 45/55, etc) You have to rate the perceived arduousness of each tasks, and the effective workload associated (for example, cooking can be easy for you, you like it, you rate it 4/10, but it take time, 1h/d ; for him, cooking is harder, he rate it 7/10, and it take the same time). Once you have done it with every task, you add every hour needed (20h/w for example), you divide it with your previous factor (you have for example 7h/13h).  You then calculate individually your average perceived arduousness by hour, and the average arduousness of the selected tasks by hour. You calculate the difference.    Example of global factor : cooking for you : 4x15+ washing the cloth 6x2 + ironing 5x1 = 77/18h = 4.2  Example of selected factor : you decided to take 5/9 of the cooking, 4x8.33 and all the washing : 6x2 = 45,32/10.33h = 4,38  You do the same thing for him   If the difference between the global factor and the selected task (meaning, the average for you of every task, pondered by the time) is lower for both of you, good. If this is not the case, you calculate the proportionate difference from the mean, and you determine if it is quite similar for both of you. If it isn't, the one that has the higher positive difference from the mean should give some work to the other one. Now, the money can enter into play. You calculate the difference in your earning (he earn twice what you have? 33%/66%). You addition every things you have to use (electricity, rent, food,...), and suppress it from the addition of both of your salaries. You use the previous percentage and observe what is left. If you consider some things aren't fair (he choose a very expensive place, so you both have less money because of his decision ; the % of hour worked is very different...), you modulate this percentage accordingly.  With the money left, you can both use it to reduce your working load : you can pay for a gardener, a house cleaner, meal, etc.   Done !   Now, a little advice : imagine what your life will be with children? It's important that you act now, because it will only become worse.  Best of luck (and sorry, I'm not a native English speaker, I think I made many mistakes, don't hesitate to tell me where they are, or ask me to explain some part/give you precise example!)"

He's being kind of an ass by lording his bigger paycheck over you. Compensation is not necessarily a reflection of stress, or difficulty of a job ... often it is as much a result of chance and good decision making during major-choosing time as anything else  The thing a lot of married couples don't really get is that the mixed money thing ... the equitable division of labor thing ... it's because you'll both get old. Retirement is very long and healthcare can become quite costly. Who's to say who will be laid up in a hospital bed for years on end while the other is caregiving.  I know splitting money and splitting bills works in a lot of families. I just don't understand it.  When kids come around ... will he be fair about childcare responsibilities, or will his bigger paycheck justify being an absentee dad?  You might want to get into a couple's therapist to talk about this with him because it will be hard to find a lead on common ground without an outside unbiased voice."

The point of marriage is to merge your lives, that should include finances, for exactly the reasons you stated.  OP, your husband is disrespectful bordering on emotionally abusive. It is not at all normal for a grown man to literally prefer to go hungry to prove a point, rather than get off his ass and make himself something. Automatically shutting you down and telling you you're being hormonal when you try to discuss the inequality is not even a little bit okay. Complaining and yelling at you for not doing the chores fast enough is NOT OKAY. You're a human being and you deserve respect, and that level of respect should not be tied to your income. At the very least you need couples counseling, but if it were me and this were an ongoing thing (which from your comments it sounds like it is, and his shitty attitude towards you isn't exclusive to the chore issue) I'd really take the time to reevaluate my relationship."

This guy is living in the stone age, and he needs to face the fact that he doesn't have a stay at home spouse. His spouse works outside the home too, she is tired after her day's work too, and he is being a lazy, selfish ass.  I've been a bit in OP's position, only I was earning more than my SO.  It wasn't easy, but once I made it an issue and stood my ground, things got better fast. Of course my partner was understanding, she was just oblivious to how far the imbalance had gotten until I laid it out clearly. It wasn't easy, but it was well worth the initial turbulence to feel like a teammate instead of a servant."

My ex would blow through his and start putting stuff on our credit card, and I was responsible for paying all of the bills, leading to a huge amount of resentment on my part.   My SO and I have been together for seven years. Our paychecks go into our individual accounts, and we transfer money each month into a joint account that is only for bills.   Not only does this avoid any ""you spent too much"" arguments, but I make more and have more expenses than he does because of a hobby I have. Bills are divided proportionally (he pays less because he makes less) and we take turns paying when we go out, go grocery shopping, etc (I pay about twice for every one time he pays.) It's a great arrangement and works well for us, and whenever we get around to getting married, we don't plan to change things."

When preggers with my third and hormonal I broke down in sobs after that happened (and the dog barfed on the floor I washed).    My husband didn't understand quite why I was so upset.

relationship_advice,3dmypz,macimom,6,Fri Jul 17 16:20:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're overreacting. Marriage is a partnership. While not every partnership looks the same, you should feel like you are an equal in your partnership--however that looks.   I am just finishing law school. My BF and I live together. He has a good job, I have loans that pay for my portion of things. He tends to contribute more to our monthly budget, so, while I pay half of our rent/utilities, he tends to put more money in for fun outings as well as groceries. However, he would NEVER tell me that I needed to take on more of the housework/chores because I have less money right now.   We split chores about evenly. I do most of the dishes and cleaning, except he always does the bathrooms and takes out the garbage. We alternate cooking. It works for us and works out to be about even in terms of work. We actually had a conversation when we first moved in together (about 2 years ago) regarding which household chores we really didn't like to do. He hates doing laundry and frankly I don't trust him to do my laundry, so I just do all of it. I hate cleaning toilets, so he does that. We work together to make sure that there are no feelings of resentment.   When we first moved for me to attend law school, my BF was out of work for about 30-40 days (we had to move to a different state and he had to look for a job). During this time I paid the rent with my loans and we had some savings too. I DEFINITELY didn't expect him to ""make this up to me"" by doing all or most of the housework.   In the end, it's more important for me to have a healthy, happy relationship with my BF. I know that either one of us being expected to do all/most of the chores would build resentment. Neither of us want that.   In the end your H needs to decide what is most important to him. It sounds like he is taking you for granted. You should feel like an equal partner in this relationship. An individual brings more than just money into a relationship--it doesn't sound like your H realizes that."

No its not warranted.  While you were dating how did he behave?  Because he is just so disrespectful and a bully to boot.  Its hard to believe that he was a mature, loving man who looked like a good partner who would respect, support and share both money and burdens with you and you got married and he did a 180.  Regardless, its time you had a serious talk with him. Dont be deflected by him guilting you (manipulating you and bullying you. Tell him , I am happy to discuss finances with you AFTER we discuss the division of labor around the home-and AFTER we discuss what we value in a mate.  Make a list of your top 5 values in a mate-pick from Honesty, loyalty, sense of humor, good communicator, shares burdens, provides financially, kind, want to go out and have fun and so on.  Have him make the same list. Talk about where you each fall on the other person's list-would you get a one star or a five star-see how you guys can improve your ratings.

If he actually does work a job that is more demanding physically and/or mentally, it would make sense that you would do a larger portion of the chores. From what you're telling us, he's taking this to an unhealthy and disrespectful degree. You don't have to be the slave. Of course, it may make sense for you to consider cutting your hours at work so you can do some chores (or he could), but he'd still need to change his attitude.  Example: Molly and John work 40 hours a week. Molly does construction and John works at library. Molly makes twice as much as John. Molly is physically exhausted at the end of each day and works under constant time pressures. John, on the other hand, has a workplace that is laid back. Molly is far less happy at work, but keeps at it for the money so that her and John can live a comfortable life. In exchange for working the physically and mentally demanding job, Molly expects John to do the majority of the house work, but she still does the majority of the cooking. If this wasn't the case, why wouldn't Molly quit her job and do something less satisfying that paid less? It's not far to Molly that John gets all the benefits of Molly's hard job without putting in any extra effort."

relationship_advice,3dmypz,chelly56,3,Sat Jul 18 00:18:47 2015 UTC,I would say if anything he uses the money as a way of controlling you. He not only uses it as a free pass to get out of doing everything he dislikes doing he then spends money on what he wants without considering your opinion and to add to further insult rubs it in because he spends more than what you are comfortable spending. He chooses to buy high priced items and lord it over you because you have less money.  I see divorce in your future because at some point his behaviour will cause enough resentment for you to want to split due to his antics and he will be oblivious to why you left him because he has his head lodged up his arse.    You husband is a jerk.
relationship_advice,3dmypz,GinervaPotter,3,Sat Jul 18 01:18:39 2015 UTC,"Another perspective- my husband makes more than twice what I do. I definitely do more of the household chores/childcare for a couple of reasons. My workload is less than his. He works longer hours and never gets to ""turn off"" the way I do. He is paid well, but is expected to be available if issues come up, even if it means accommodating international time zones, traveling a lot etc. As for childcare. My son is 14 months old and more often than not insists on mom rather than dad. My husband is a great father.   Financially we split things proportionately. He pays for more things than I do because he has more money. But ultimately it's our money, as a family unit. We actually don't have our main bank accounts jointly, but we've been living together for 6-7 years and it hasn't been an issue.   He's happier in life because I have a job that allows me to turn off and be a present mother to our son. I'm happier because I'm not worried about money. It works for us. Neither of us would ever downplay or devalue the role that the other plays in our life. Actually he tells me pretty much every day what a wonderful wife and mother I am and always tell him how much I appreciate his hard work for our family.   Your husband does not value you the same way. He doesn't think that your contribution to the relationship is as valid as his. Truthfully, I think you married too young, that won't help you now but it might make someone else have a second thought about a young marriage if they are reading this.   I really think you need counselling. An outside party who can tell him how ridiculous he's being. He should want to help with chores so you can maximize your free time together to do fun things. Would he rather play his video games or go out with you?   I really hope you can work this out but right now you are not being appreciated and he is holding you to an unfair division of labour. I really hope that the comments here spur you to some action. This is not the way you want to live the rest of your life."

Keeping score on who brings in the most money who does this and who does that is a way to doom the relationship plain and simple. In a marriage you BOTH need to give 110%.

That's obvious. What few people here are pointing out is that your husband doesn't respect you at all. You say he yells at you if you don't do enough chores fast enough.   You have bigger problems than chore splitting here. You need a marriage counselor at the very least, because this isn't really about the chores. This is about a lack of respect for you both as his wife and as a person with feelings and needs. If he really, truly cared about you and respected you as his wife, he'd pull more weight.   My SO has 2 jobs and makes quite a bit more than I do, but he still does the few chores I ask of him, and cooks his own food if I'm tired or not feeling well. I do end up doing more around the house, but I have more time than he does. Even still, he respects me as his future wife and as a person that gets tired, or stressed, and understands that I can't do everything, and he is happy to help me if I say I need it because he cares about me and my feelings.   I think you and your husband have much deeper issues than him not helping around the house."

relationship_advice,3dmypz,EDMK,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:26:43 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. It is about how many hours you work outside the home, not how much money you bring in. Both of you deserve an equal amount of leisure time. (Presumably you might also like to spend some of it together, which won't be possible if you have to spend all your time doing household chores.)  My partner and I both think that housework is unpleasant and because of that neither person should ever be obligated to do it all. We've both gone through periods of unemployment, during which the unemployed person took on about 90% of the housework, leaving the other person with some small chores like washing dishes or folding laundry. When we're both employed full-time we hire someone to do the cleaning and split the small chores 50-50.  By 50-50 I don't mean that we have to alternate chores and do the exact same chores. Obviously there are preferences. For instance, I enjoy cooking and don't mind washing dishes but loathe grocery shopping, whereas he hates washing dishes but doesn't mind drying them and is neutral about shopping. So it makes sense for me to do most of the cooking and dish-washing, while he does the dish-drying and grocery shopping. I think dish-washing is roughly equal to dish drying in terms of effort and time commitment, and cooking and grocery shopping are also similar."

relationship_advice,3dmypz,Altnob,2,Fri Jul 17 19:00:58 2015 UTC,"If he truly has a seriously more taxing job, then certainly, I'd expect you to take up the reigns on chores a big more. I work more hours than my fiance and go to university full time, so I expect him to be kind enough to pick up on that end to relieve my stress if he can. If you guys are pretty evenly matched with hours and stress, the chores should be evenly matched too - regardless of how much is made."

Women make less money than men for identical positions frequently.  He needs to get the government to make laws to ensure you get pay equally through lots and lots of lobbying - not try and make you do more chores because money is the only thing that means anything to his lazy video game playing ass.

That being said, just because he has a stressful job doesn't mean he doesn't have to do anything at home. If you are working the same amount of hours and picking up all his slack I would tell him maybe he should quit his job because he obviously can't handle it."

I would say he has a point if you have part time work.  But you don't.  You work full time.  He works full time.  So, while it is nice that his career lets him bring home more cash, he isn't actually working any more or ""harder"" than you are....which implies to me that the home life work (the chores) ought to be split somehow (50/50 exactly seldom works but it ought to be pretty close).    I particularly don't get the cooking thing because my mate and I either alternate cooking (sometimes one us has just ""had it"" and needs a night off and the other will dive in and take over the meal prep) or, more often, we prepare dinner together because we both love cooking and we love doing it together (to the point that I got us a pair of nice chef knives so we can both chop stuff at the same time).  Ditto on the cleanup - we both work in the kitchen together putting stuff away and washing up until the decks are cleared and ready to go for the next meal.  Its nice to have the together time after work.  That's us though - nevertheless a more equitable division of labor should be the order of the day.  Using you as his servant and lording it over you because your career doesn't pay as well is just shitty behavior - I wouldn't put up with it."

All the posts so far, including my prior one, are saying how morally justified your thoughts are but when it comes down to it your only real choice is to either suck it up and live your life like this, divorce, or get your husband into counseling.  Now is probably the time to make the hard decision that you can not live your life with these conditions and do something about it.  You don't mention kids so I presume you have none.  You are still very young so starting over without him would be much easier now than years down the road and if you have kids in the future then changing the situation will be way more difficult.  I'm surely no expert, but it seems that you have to confront your husband on these issues with the goal of getting into marriage counseling.  He will not, and probably cannot, change on his own and you cannot change him but joint counseling might help.  If he refuses or makes false promises about changing (even if he is sincere) but will not do counseling then your choice gets narrowed down to sucking it up for the rest of your married life with him or ending the marriage now."

He lies about it because he has known he is different from an early age, and different in a way that has emotional and legal consequences in our society. He understands perfectly well that if he is honest about himself, he will be excluded socially and will be viewed as a monster, so he lies to make himself look better.  The reason he is so good at lying is that like any other skill, it gets better with practice. He has probably has known for at least five or six years that he's attracted to vulnerable minors. He has been hiding this from everyone around him, and the best way to do that effectively is to act so normal that nobody would ever believe this of him.  Maybe one or two percent of sexual predators come off as a sexual predator when interacting with them. The rest are exactly like your boyfriend, everyone around them thinks they'd be the very last person to do something like that.

relationship_advice,3dptnv,whatapickleiamin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:23:29 2015 UTC,"I think you guys should get tipsy and talk about it. Drink/game night, what do you think? Please don't get shitfaced XD that'd be a bad idea.  Anywho, I was in your situation for 2 years and this is how my current boyfriend and best friend FINALLY admitted he liked me. Under the influence haha. If all goes wrong, well, maybe it'll never get mentioned again. After all, you were being tipsy. That is is the easy route. You could also just have a serious conversation with him.  Think about it this way too: if feelings develop too much you'll lose him anyway because friendship won't be enough forever. Or maybe the feelings will go away and it won't be a problem anymore. Those are the 2 outcomes If you don't say anything"
relationship_advice,3dptnv,ageekyninja,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:28:56 2015 UTC,"Hmm. That is a good point about the outcomes. As for the getting drunk bit, I just am not a drink (God, I'm lame...). I don't think I could do that no matter how hard I tried. Could I ask you something? What would have been your exit strategy if he had not had feelings for you? What I mean is, how would you try to make it not awkward? I just want to have a backup plan so it doesn't end up like that other time I asked a guy if he had feelings."
relationship_advice,3dptnv,ageekyninja,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:26:16 2015 UTC,"Well, when he staggerdly told me his feelings I was also drinking. I admitted mine too. But it wasn't because of the alcohol. It was for 3 reasons. The first reason was simply because the moment and opportunity to talk about it finally presented itself. We were extremely close. Our friends and family were ALWAYS talking about me and him dating. His girlfriends were always talking about us dating too. The jealousy was real. I would have never tried to take him out from under a relationship, but his exes/gfs always thought I was the enemy lol. It caused a lot of turmoil in his relationships. But if an ultimatum was placed he'd always pick me because he'd known me longer. The subject tended to stay on mind. We'd call the girls crazy, but the question was never answered, DID we have feelings for one another? WAS something there? Something was there for me.  The second reason was because I knew I could talk to him about anything and we'd probably be ok. At worst it'd be awkward for a while..and it was! A little. For 6 months we remained friends after we knew we had feelings. But this is due to complicated reasons. He wanted to discuss his feelings while he was in a relationship and I recklessly went through with it expecting to be told he felt nothing special because I wanted an answer so bad. You probably won't get this complication. My boyfriend was caught between a girl and me. He wound up choosing me, but not until I damn near (and very vocally) walked out of his life because I refused to be option #2 and I thought the whole thing was getting silly. We WERE still friends. Yet the longer I went without fully being able to express my feelings, the greater a rift grew between us,   which brings me to reason 3.  I loved him. I did. I loved him for years. I don't know if you feel this way about your friend. Being his best friend only hurt. He was always talking to me about girls and I was always helping him. I wanted so much more than what we had, even though what we had was great. The problem was I just could never fully express myself knowing that I loved him while always pretending I didn't. It was like I was lying to him all the time. Putting up a front. I wasn't able to be me, so the friendship by itself, while precious, was losing what made it a friendship. The honesty. The part where we could tell each other everything . Since my first exit strategy (lose feelings and keep this awesome friend) did not work, I went with the second and was fully ready to take my dignity and walk away. Never lose your dignity in a situation like this. Don't let him use your feelings, even if its unintentional, IF he doesn't like you back. My decision lasted less than a minute  lol he quickly dumped his gf a week later once he figured out how (who was treating him like crap anyway) and ran straight to me. He gave me that endearing look friends give and told me if I wanted to be with him all along, even if it meant more or less asking him to leave his girlfriend, I should have said so a LONG time ago because he would have, and did, in a heartbeat. Of course I didn't do that until I felt it was appropriate (fish or cut bait buddy! I'm not gonna be your ""other woman""). A week later he explained his reasoning for that: he loved me all along and thought my feelings weren't as strong. He was struggling just like me at the possibility of losing me as friend . basically girl, I could have avoided ALL that drama if I had just bloody spit it out while we were both single haha. We were both waiting on each other. That's why it took two years! Hope you got something out of my long winded story. Waiting too long can cause a lot of problems. I guess I wouldn't take anything back though, since we've been together for nearly 8 months now."
relationship_advice,3dptnv,ageekyninja,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:32:13 2015 UTC,"Crap, that is beautiful. And congrats on the 8 months. Your advise is really good and I will update with tips I have read so anyone else struggling with a similar situation can see them. Now in my case, I wouldn't say I love him. However, I would be okay with going on a date with him, which is something I have never pleasured the thought of. Like I had mentioned earlier, I never though of myself and relationship. The thought was alien to me, so I guess that willingness to try a relationship is my form of interest. Could I ask you one more question? Would you describe your boyfriend as very shy? I am just worried that if I ask him, he might get embarrassed (even if he does have feelings) and feel uncomfortable. Would it be best to wait for the shy person to ask so it is more comfortable for them?"
relationship_advice,3dptnv,ageekyninja,2,Sun Jul 19 02:13:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would. Only when he really likes someone though. We are cuddled up constantly now. But back then there was always a foot of space between us haha. If I inched closer he would inch back. When I was all made up he couldnt maintain eye contact for long. I really thought he didnt like me. If you wait for the shy person you will be waiting forever (2 years!! All that time spent pacing and crying and hoping and wondering). Timing is super important though. You have to wait until its just right. Maybe an intimate mood is already set. Actually, it would help to have someone egg you guys on. Got any mutual friends who can play this role so you can gauge his reaction? I warn you, he may SWEAR he doesnt like you. That might not be true. It wasnt in my case OR my boyfriends. We told everyone there was nothing there when it honestly seemed like we were both lying all the time haha. It wasnt until we had the discussion TOGETHER, ALONE, and a little drunk that the truth came out. So I would use said buddy as an excuse to start the conversation"

You seem to understand that you built this up in your mind, yet expect him to know somehow.  It is on you that you are feeling like shit, and now your vague explanation of your reaction is what is making him confused and feeling like shit too.   You have to talk about your expectations, how you got fixed to this idea and location. How you realise that it was dilerious and wrong of you to build up your expectations without involving him. You need to drop your hurt ego and have the talk you should have had prior your trip: the idea of marriage."
relationship_advice,3dqf9b,LateStar,3,Sat Jul 18 14:14:35 2015 UTC,"Oh geez. You just set a standard for how romantic a proposal you are looking for pretty high and yep you definitely put a whole lot of pressure on him. Maybe take some time to let him know that he didn't mess up anything by taking you on such a romantic trip and not proposing. You got your own hopes up for no reason what so ever, not even a hint that it was a possibility just a thought that happened to pass through your head. Most guys won't think of these things without some sort of conversation before hand (as you stated). From the sounds of it you two hadn't even talked about marriage before? Instead of being angry because he's a guy and the fact that he took you on this amazing trip that he knew you wanted to do so bad and didn't propose maybe be happy that you have an amazing man who took you there just to make you happy. Most girls would kill to be as fortunate as you. But now he knows you want to get married maybe have a good heart to heart and let him know you'll love whatever he chooses to do and that he doesn't have to rush anything, take his time. Maybe from now on drop a few hints here and there. He'll pick up on these things and hopefully he'll do something romantic and think it's all his idea. Good luck!"
relationship_advice,3dqf9b,FroggerMustDie,0,Sat Jul 18 13:46:44 2015 UTC,"See, the problem is we have spoken about marriage and getting married hundreds of times. We even have a list of who would an would not be invited, the kind of flower arrangements, we even looked at a venue somewhere. So its not like this weddin thing is a delusion. He knows about it as much as i do.  Also, he did drop a few hints before coming here and while we were here. For instance i said i wasnt looking forward to going back home, and he said oh im sure youll have a lot to think about and plan, like other futurw trips and our future in genereral"" an he gave me like a coy smile. Knowing him, that was a hint.  Does it make more sense now that im kinda confused..?"
relationship_advice,3dqf9b,FroggerMustDie,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:27:51 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, this makes much more sense why you are confused! In that case I think maybe you guys were just sending the wrong signals to each other. He is just a man after all and its been proven time and time again women tend to read way more into things and men are actually as simple as they seem. In his head he probably though he was getting some huge brownie points by just taking you on your dream trip. But now that it's out in the open that this is what you wanted as well hopefully he'll get on it sooner rather than later. I still think it's a good idea for you two to talk it out and make sure he knows he still did a amazing job by taking you on such an amazing trip and no pressure on how and when he proposes. My hubby and I were together for over 5 years before he proposed, talking about marriage lots till finally it got to a point were I pretty much said now or never kinda thing, a month later while I was packing clothes to go camping he proposed. Nothing romantic but I was over the moon. Monday is our 2 year anniversary. So sometimes spelling it out isn't a bad thing. Again, good luck."

relationship_advice,3dqf9b,ageekyninja,2,Sat Jul 18 16:06:37 2015 UTC,"i have just taken a trip abroad to a place he knew ive always wanted to see. He knows this trip means a lot to me and that it was so speciAl that i finally got to come here.  Everything in our relationship is great and we're best friends.  I've always spoken about the place and couldnt wait to be there. When we got there it was breathtaking. Romantic, perfect atmosphere, etc.  im not the type of girl who needs dinner in a fancy restaurant to be romantic, i believe romance can be found anywhere.  just rugged nature and us.  There have been other instances where it was just as romantic and beautiful or meangifull  i cried.   Girl, what are you doing? You've got a real prince charming here! You should enjoy it! These moments are supposed to be special! Go with the flow, alright? :) I understand us ladies can sometimes get really excited about marriage, but what you have now is really, really precious too. All KINDS of people get married. Lots of times its not to very good people, and yet you have this guy! Marriage is separate from happiness and companionship. Its also separate from love. You very well could have all of the above, so dont rush it. I am fairly sure a proposal will happen. Its just a matter of time. If you wait just long enough for him to surprise you, it will be all the more special. Just dont constantly expect it to happen tomorrow or else this will happen again.  I would just discuss with him that you feel really bad, and that it was an over reaction. It would be good to look back and appreciate the great things you saw and express gratitude. The goal should be to make sure he doesnt feel bad for doing a good thing. Its ok for you to outright say ""I really dont want you to feel bad about this and I really didnt mean to put pressure on you. Im sorry. Lets make this special. How do you feel about us getting married? Before you were under pressure while telling me. I didnt know if you were just trying to make me happy"" If he is wanting to still get married you can say something along the lines of ""Ok, you time it how you think is right, ok? I will be ok with whatever you do, just please do/dont..."" THEN you set expectations. I mean, dont be unreasonable. I wouldnt really set a time limit."

You can say he's ready all you want but I don't see a ring on your finger, and if he genuinely was ready he would have been thinking about it as much as you.      Yes, you just guilted him into it, yes now he is going to feel pressured to ask you and yes you could have avoided the entire thing if you didn't just decide in your head without any supporting evidence that he was going to ask you. You set yourself up to fail and now you've put strain on your relationship. Good job."

relationship_advice,3dpr7w,LykDisIfUcryerrytime,4,Sat Jul 18 06:47:37 2015 UTC,"I would start the conversation by asking her how she feels now about your money situation. She may still feel less secure than you. If she says she is uncomfortable about it still because of your financial priorities, then you need to stand up for yourself, while validating her right to be concerned.   So yes, you both need to have shared goals and talk to each other about significant purchased. But for small things, you both need to feel trusted as adults.  But just because you sometimes have different priorities it does not mean either your or her priorities are wrong. As long as neither of you threatens the security of the family.   I would frame the allowance as a method to protect the finances from any threat she perceives from your spending. You will have a set limit, as she can too. And neither of you will interfere with that. Everything else needs to be discussed. It sounds very fair, reasonable, healthy to organize your finances this way."

Reread that over and over until you realize how bad it sounds and ask yourself how you ended up becoming the kind of person who has to ask permission or an allowance to spend his own money.   Is she your wife or your master? Are you two partners or are you just her financial slave that must do whatever she wants without question?   Get yourself together man.

Since you seem to think the money thing is a sham and there may be something else going on it may be worth it to discuss it. Otherwise from your tone, you may let this stew and build up to cause problems later. He may just be afraid to tell you the truth. Maybe he just realized he does not want to do it all over again. At 44 having small children is hard.

Its TWICE as much work (really more since they fight with each other and always have conflicting schedules etc). Small children are hard and when you have two toddlers together its harder. Her husband has every right to change his mind. Maybe having the other child made him realize he did not want anymore? Maybe he thought two children meant the one from his previous marriage? Regardless, wife has no right to force him into it but she should be able to talk to him about it honestly."
relationship_advice,3dnx2e,peanutgallerie,7,Fri Jul 17 21:45:10 2015 UTC,I never said he didn't have a right to change his mind or that I should or could force him to have a child if he doesn't want one.

You're being resentful with him for doing the reasonable thing, he didn't wrong your or is acting selfishly, he is just listening to his brain and looking after his real family best interests (not the hypothetical one that doesn't even exist). That's what rational, ethical beings should do. You can ignore reason and act as bitter as you wish but the same way you can resent him for not ignoring his brain and giving you what you want, he could also resent you for suddenly feeling he is stuck with an unreasonable woman."

Stepparents feel...cheated for lack of a better word...out of a lot of things.  It is what it is-stepparents give up a lot.

The only bad part of the whole thing for me was dealing with his x wife because she was/is a nutjob. I am sure each situation is different but I find it a bit disturbing how people in this thread are saying step children ""don't really count"". No they are not your biological children but they are or should be a huge part of your life. He obviously had a child before they got together, it was not a surprise.  Of course you don't have the same exact relationships with step children as you do biological ones because there is another parent in the picture. You don't have the say you would or the control but you are there to help shape their lives just like you would a biological child.   I keep stating she needs to speak with him frankly about why he has changed his mind. But sitting there saying she would resent him forever is a bit dramatic. I am sure he would resent her if he was forced into having children he did not want. Life isn't a spreadsheet or a project plan. Things change and you need to learn how to navigate through the changes while trying to stay as happy and fulfilled as possible.   Do you love him or the prospect of having children? You can love both but then you must be understanding to both things."

Ss is always treated well when he visits but I don't do any of the parenting stuff with him, that's by husband's choice.   I really do think I would carry the resentment with me if we didn't have another child. Or rather, if we didn't at least try for one. I'm under no illusions that it may not happen even if we try. It would be like being asked to give up the opportunity to try for any big dream you might have. Sure, life goes on, but you carry the regret with you."
relationship_advice,3dnx2e,your_what_hurts,14,Sat Jul 18 00:39:08 2015 UTC,"That's tough but I don't see how this can be resolved to your liking if he says no. The same could be said if it was the other way around (and you didn't want kids etc.).  I think it's one of those things where you have to think of the big picture and you have to 'go there' to see what the outcome could be. If you simply can't live with that-you could break up and get inseminated but then you would have a kid without a father. Where will you be then? Now another scenario--let's say you can convince him. At your kids college graduation you will be 60 + and he's be 65 +.  Just when you are retiring your kids will have college debt, have the expense of a wedding, need help with other things that come up in their lives etc...  In my heart of hears I think having kids this late is for people who are rich and can keep their health great, have help (with the kids/home etc.) and have the money to pay off college, save for retirement and help young adults with their new lives. For the rest of us, too tough and kind of unfair to the kids in one way or another.  Another thing-you are 39, at 35 the chances of you have a down syndrome child is quite high so every year adds more worry. Yeah, there are tests and all that but I don't know, man I think you have two great kids and many people don't even get to have one. I say count your ""blessings"" and be happy with  your family and your husband."

I don't think it's really an age concern for him as much as a financial one. But as I said in the original post, we are not poor.   And yes, I do know there are risks involved. There were risks when we had our daughter at 37. We did all available testing and things turned out fine. And yes, of course I count my blessings for the family I have.

relationship_advice,3dnx2e,safescience,7,Sat Jul 18 01:56:24 2015 UTC,"Sure, no worries. It's okay to feel sadness. Every time you feel sadness you can feel some good when you think of all the stress on this already over burdened earth.   I personally don't think it's a good idea to have a family bigger than 2 kids. For anybody. I know that sounds about far-fetched but I promise you that it isn't when we are 8 billion and counting on this earth. Other animals don't get to 'consciously' mate but humans have no excuse. 2 is fine per family, ya know, and although one is not 'yours' biologically-that's the other conscious thing humans can do is bring into their fold humans they can care about  who are not biologically theirs. You are a good person for making sure that kid has two mothers who care (assuming the kid still has his/her other mother-if not-then you are even extra important in his/her life)."

The biological urge for children is NOT something step kids can ever fill.  I'm so sorry.  Give it some time to cool off and come back to it.  Make sure you are not attacking him though.

When you said you wanted to try for a second child, he knew it was biological. Maybe it is that he is 44. Maybe it is that he just now finally feels the debt is gone...but ya'll need to talk. Unfortunately, both of you have to be on board with another child. If not, all is lost."

relationship_advice,3dnx2e,premedonna,4,Sat Jul 18 07:02:11 2015 UTC,"I don't see how they conflict at all. The presence of debt doesn't automatically mean you're not well off. I know some people have the idea that all debt must be paid off as soon as humanly possible, but there's nothing wrong with making steady, regular payments on debt that don't break your budget rather than living on beans and rice to get it paid off immediately. Maybe it's worth it to them to pay more in interest over the long run to have flexibility in their budget now.  Also, they are paying child support, not receiving it, and that bill has recently gone down according to OP, freeing up more money.   Finally, I do not at all see how it is responsible to know for years that your wife wants a second child, only at the last minute to refuse to have one. Yes, it is his choice, and yes, she has no option other than tl respect that, but he made a unilateral decision about their lives that gives OP no recourse. That's not how a partnership should work. Now if he laid out the budget and said, ""I'm concerned about finances, let's have a talk and see how or if we could make this work,"" ok."

He claimed that would turn him on lol Also he thought it would be hot if I went on those amateur live porn sites (not that he was 100% serious).

And this is his fantasy, like S&M, D&S there are two sides to this relationship and it has to be both parties fantasies. A common fetish is exbitionism, does it turn you on to be looked at ?

It's not super rare but it's not ubiquitous, either.   I don't even know what I feel about it.   Then you probably want to tell him that you don't know how you feel about it and will have to decide how you feel about it.  And as long as he doesn't try to pressure you into doing something you're uncomfortable with or force your hand, you should be good.   By normal I meant if guys generally ask that.   No.  Men who ask their girlfriends to post nudes and stripteases and the like online are not in the majority.  Men who want to ask their SOs that but don't probably don't make that into a majority either.   Is it a common fetish?   I'd say it's not super common, but it's more towards the mid-range of uncommon."

My two cents to the conversation is that the fact that you're posting this question on reddit seeking advice suggests that you're uncomfortable with the idea, and if that's the case, I don't think you should post the pics.  If you were 100% into the idea and wanted to do it, you wouldn't asking if this was normal in the first place.  I'm not telling you to break up with you're bf or get in a fight or anything like that.  But these are pics of YOUR body, and only YOU should decide what to do with them -- don't let anyone else try and convince you otherwise ;)"

Maybe he likes the ""power"" that comes with having an attractive partner, or maybe he might like sharing you with others in a Hotwife kind of way.

relationship_advice,3dnvfh,Branfip81,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:20:15 2015 UTC,"Hey so I can actually tell you about what happens if you decide to do this (having done it myself). It sounds (to me) like you don't mind the posting of those pictures but aren't sure what it will do to your relationship. It's a reasonable concern, and it really depends on being clear with your boyfriend about what is and isn't acceptable and trusting each other with all of this.  I set some ground rules (I am fine with X but not fine with Y. Z would turn me on as well). My boyfriend of the time talked with me about his desires, and we found a middle ground that worked for both of us. It honestly improved our sex life because I was really turned on as a result of all of it. He liked getting me to pose for pictures (in some cases that meant spanking me until my ass was bright red, which he seemed to really enjoy). In my case I was the one who originally wanted to post pictures, but the outcome could be similar for you.  You need to have a serious conversation with your boyfriend about expectations, boundaries, etc. before you even think about doing this. If you both are comfortable with it (and also if you are both turned on by it) then it can be enjoyable. Ease into it though. Do something that is well within both of your comfort zones before venturing into the more adventurous types of online exhibitionism.  It doesn't really matter if it's normal or not. Protect yourself in terms of being aware that what you post/do online can't be taken back. At the same time, if you do decide to do it, have fun with it. You should do it because it adds more than it takes away in terms of your sex life. If it's something that you're comfortable with or willing to do because you think it'll make sex more fun, then go for it. Don't worry about what everyone else is doing."

That said, people are hard-wired to be sympathetic.  If you walk into a room and see a bunch of people with mysteriously frightened expressions on their faces, you will start to be frightened, even if you don't know the cause of their fear.  The same thing is true with art: if you hear a song you like, you probably want to tell someone else about it.  The reason for this is that it deepens your pleasure of the artwork if you can imagine another person also experiencing pleasure in it.  In addition to to sympathizing with other men you want to have sex with you, your boyfriend may also enjoy imagining you as a sexual person with desires of your own.  I'm actually really turned off by women who say they can't imagine being attracted to anyone other than their partner: they seem sexually stunted."

If you had taken it and made a bunch of expensive calls then forgot to give it back before she went away on holiday then yea sure, that's fine to be annoyed. But that's just weird. Is there more detail to that part of the story? Because it just sits out as being very strange.  Anyway, I think that living together can put a lot of strain on a relationship. You're with each other a lot more all of a sudden and sharing private space when you used to be able to use the bathroom and not worry if your lover can hear you and whatever else might be awkward. So in a way I can see how tensions might be high. That said, if this has been going on for a while now, I think she is being unreasonable. Maybe you could ask her about how she feels about living together and if maybe you guys should get your own places for a while to see if it works better. Let her know you've noticed the tension and you're not sure why you feel as though you've done something bad so much of the time. Perhaps she does have a number of things she is not comfortable sharing with you (yet) and feeling as though she can't get away from you is too much. Hence the silent treatment, blocking you out to feel some 'alone time' (as stupid as it is in reality).  I'm not really sure, I just feel it is important to try get a bit of a feeling for what she might be experiencing before jumping up and saying she's the worst. Not being able to say 'I forgive you' etc is fairly common and it's to do with self-esteem and all that, so there are possibly things she needs to work on as a person and the best thing you can do is allow her to do that, maybe that means getting your own places, I dunno. But I hope this gives you a few ideas."

I would recommend trying couples counseling if you REALLY want it to work, otherwise get used to it, and talk about things when you two have actually calmed down, or get on with your life.

If you like her, which it's evident you do, contact her! Maybe joke around and say ""hey stranger"". You guys definitely need to talk. You should ask her why she hasn't spoken to you in a while. You ought to say you like her and were waiting for her to contact you but when she didn't you thought she lost interest. Then, if she's still interested, reassure her- especially reassure her it's not about sex if it's brought up. I assume a relationship with this girl would require a lot of reassuring."

Sounds like this one could go either way: either toward a relationship, or just maintain a good friendship. If I were you, I would anticipate feeling at least a little further apart from him when he comes back, and to try to get close to him again since that seems to be what you want. Once he and you are close again, just approach him and say ""[Name], since you've been away, I've had a few moments to really think about what our friendship has been and how it has developed over the years, and I was hoping you might be willing to tell me if you have ever wanted more than what we've had as friends. I don't need you to answer that question today or even soon, but I just wanted to ask, and I still want to be your close friend regardless of your answer. And I'm glad to have you back. :)"" This gives you an out because it's open-ended so you don't have to get hurt if he doesn't feel there's more than friends, and gives him an out so he can either tell you he likes you, or he can take time to think about it, or to tell you he's just looking for friends at least for now.  Sidenote: As a college guy myself, I can say that there's almost no woman in the world right now that I would want to be in relationship with, simply because I'm just not in the dating ""season"" for me right now; I'm in the school season and not looking to take on more. So if this is a big transformational time for him, or if he has other things going on, be prepared for the fact that he might not want a relationship anytime soon, and that might have nothing at all to do with him liking you and wanting something with you. Then again, it might be a great time for him, and he might say to himself ""I don't want to lose this chance."" You'll never know unless you step out a little and take that chance to find out too. Just my $0.02."
relationship_advice,3dpo2g,JustHere4SomeKisses,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:02:22 2015 UTC,"No one can tell you what this guys intentions are without guessing.   I was raised very religious and I can sure tell you there are a lot of confusing things that happen with guy girl friendships and church.   Firstly when a  Christian says they love someone does it mean romantically or is it ""innocent"" answer is it can be a mixture of one or both.  And it really boils down to you just can't know unless you talk. If you have feelings for this guy it really is past time to speak up (3 years).  Personally I really had a difficult time breaking the ice (romantically) in my particular brand of religion.  There was a lot of shame in seeing someone through a romantic lens and yes sexually.  Additionally I bet you probably believe the man needs to take the lead and ask the girl but I think it's been 3 years i think you are allowed to bring it up at this point.   Finally if you find that you are having romantic feelings for your friend I think it is time to be honest with yourself (you don't see him as just a friend). You obviously feel something or you wouldn't have written this.  When he comes back broach the subject with him. Tell him that your feelings toward him have changed and that you'd like to explore bring more than just friends. If he if interested take it slow and see how it goes. If things don't work out give yourself some time and space this is the way relationships work in my experience."

The problem isnt that she hates you, its the opposite, she is probably torn between you and this risk.  I would leave her alone, give her some more time, maybe a week or two at most because then she would just be shutting you out, you deserve to know what she is doing at some point but let her work this through.

I think she's reconsidering her relationship with you. Was kind of in her place at one point. My SO had herpes and stayed with him for a few months as overall he was an amazing guy. We never had sex and while he never pressured me, I knew it bothered him, and when we were nearing a year I realized that I'd just never be comfortable having sex with him.  Intimacy is important in most relationships and I felt awful for making him feel like he was gross, however I knew I'd just never be able to take that step no matter if we took all the  precautions. It was a hard breakup just cause it was really no one's fault. Still feel like a huge bitch.   Really, I don't think she's mad at you. Her reaction was probably more out of fear. I do think she's debating whether she can actually handle the fact that sleeping with you will always be a risks to her. She's handling it poorly,  but it's understandable. Give her her space. I'd say after another week, try to contact her again.    Good luck, best wishes to you."

relationship_advice,3dpg5t,getthehellofmylawn2,3,Sat Jul 18 04:36:01 2015 UTC,"Her mother has a history of depression and she is doing Molly? Those things do not mix well, your friend is predisposed to chemical imbalance and is taking a drug that purposefully overloads the brain with serotonin  (in the simplest description, serotonin is a chemical which makes you feel ""happy"" or ""good""). The result (I have first hand experience with this so FUCKING LISTEN TO IT) is that she may end up unable to produce enough serotonin at some point to get herself out of bed in the morning, eventually leading her down a path of suicidal idealizations or even attempts until it ultimately results in her death or her prolonged hospitalization. I was in the hospital for a week for a depressive episode that was more than likely caused by doing molly twice in a period of 3 days, and i will never take that drug again. The risk is too big for a person predisposed to clinical depression or bi-polar depression/mania, and that should be your greatest concern.    She will probably come off as defensive to any suggestions you have, so if I were you rather than telling her ""drugs are bad mmmkay?"" Ask her if she has done her own personal research on the fallout of taking a drug like MDMA. If she hasnt, ask her why not, and then provide her with places that you've found information on it (yes do your own research beforehand as well). You should keep in mind that in this process you are not attacking her or her lifestyle or her choices, you are simply a concerned friend who wants to know if she is fully aware of what she is getting into. Hard drugs can be lots of fun when used responsibly, yes, but they should be researched to a MAXIMUM EXTENT before doing a new one for the first time. While the high feels good, there could be side effects that you don't find out about until it is too late."

Although subtle at first, these effects may develop into major deficits over the lifetime of an otherwise healthy individual.""  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1071023/  Here's a thorough and neutral layman's version of the science around MDMA and neurotoxicity: https://dancesafe.org/drug-information/is-mdma-neurotoxic/  There's nothing wrong with using it every once in a while, but done that close together, your brain doesn't have enough time to recover and produce serotonin normally again.

It seems like there are two problems, first you don't meet enough girls and second you can't talk to them.   It sucks that you go to an all boys school, but there are other ways to meet girls. Can you do coed extra curriculars? Or start taking college courses? Or maybe a part time job with a big social scene? If you've a group of male friends then aim to find a group of girls you can all socialise together regularly. Most 18 year olds want to meet the opposite sex so everyone would be happy with this.   Alternatively try tinder or okc. If you have the right attitude it can be pretty fun and gives you the opportunity to develop dating skills.   The second problem is what to talk about. Girls are not so different to boys. Talk about movies, music, school, summer plans, family, college, hopes and dreams for the future etc etc. ask lots of questions and listen to and remember the answer, then next time you can refer to things she's told you before. Make occasional sincere compliments. Tell jokes and laugh at her jokes.   It's hard at 18 but doing as many interesting things as possible helps in both meeting people and having something to talk about. The most interesting boys in high school are the ones who do something interesting - play in a band, rock climbing, skateboarding, volunteer work etc etc.   If you can get a summer job working at a camp or similar, there should be lots more girls than boys there so the odds will be on your side.   Lastly, although they don't show it most teenage girls are just as keen to have a boyfriend as you are to have a girlfriend.   Good luck and report back!"

relationship_advice,3dn2yb,Supportbot13,2,Fri Jul 17 19:27:19 2015 UTC,"Explain that her passive aggressive behavior makes you question her maturity and your future together.   I think this is a very bad idea as it is insulting and just asking for a fight. Plus, you know what they say about ultimatums (even implied). They're poison to relationships.  If you want this to work you should focus more on exploring her feelings while focusing on your needs. Maybe she'll have an epiphany about how immature she's being and grow up. Maybe she won't. But there is some serious communication to be had. Also, sometimes you will have to just let her pout while you go do what you do. She might get over it or get used to you being away. Some people need extra time before they can rationalize a silly situation.  If all else fails don't keep wasting your time."

I love her dearly but sometimes the feelings you have cannot change a person's behavior.  There are biological and life-long environmental influences at play.  I encourage you to look objectively at how she behaves and ask yourself if you 1. approve and 2. can live the rest of your life dealing with it.  If the answer to either of those points is ""no"".  Cut the emotional aspect and split as fast as you can.  Clingy/Needy/Controlling escalates very quickly and WILL break out into hysterics."

relationship_advice,3dn2yb,Far_Awayy,3,Fri Jul 17 19:03:33 2015 UTC,"No offense but moving in with someone because it is convenient is a horrible reason in my experience. You should move in together because you're ready for it, excited, and feel like your lifestyles would compliment each other. You're both super young and to be honest, her behavior is reflective of her age. She's being selfish, controlling, immature, and resorting to emotional manipulation by trying to guilt you into doing what she thinks is correct. This is unhealthy and to be honest you won't last long in a relationship with dynamics like those.  You need to be firm (not aggressive) with what you're doing - you don't need to ask for permission to fix your motorcycle or spend time to yourself but you do need to let her know if she needs to make other transportation arrangements, which it sounds like you've covered. If you can't sit her down and explain calmly why you need time to yourself and how you feel she's acting irrational without her being a child about it then you need to get out of that relationship because she'll likely never understand. Stop being a doormat, stand up for yourself. There's so much life ahead of you to waste it being under someone's thumb, be smart."

Next time the opportunity opens up just tell her how good of a friend she is (but not right after she claims to be a terrible friend).

You can do so by doing what /u/Thefisher2 has mentioned - try to always have her know that you appreciate her being your friend and that you find her to be a great friend. If you want to monitor how she's doing, how about you try reading her body language/the way she talks after a period of time?

And even if she says you're wrong (which if she's anything like my friend which mentioned before she probably will say you're wrong) then don't get discouraged because she's still heard that opinion and even though she doesn't necessarily show it, you're still giving her that confidence.

You do not, should not, and absolutely can not treat the people that you love and share your life with, like this.   He just called....he said that he fell asleep again after drinking all day with co-workers and this friend.   I honestly don't know if I can even believe him.

relationship_advice,3dpfrl,Branfip81,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:29:43 2015 UTC,There are a couple of things going on here. You haven't told your parents you are gay BUT you think your friend's mom can tell just by looking at a picture (my guess is you are wrong that her mom thinks you are a lesbian or your parents already know). In either case you are both adults and it's 2015 you can see whomever you want.   I guess my question is why lie to your parents?  Why can't you tell them what's going on?  Secondly starting a relationship LDR is just a bad idea IMO it is really hard to actually get to know the real person. Can't you try OKCupid and limit your search to your local area?  I think your feeling morally wrong because of the lying. I highly suggest you find out a way to come out to your parents. I know it must be difficult but aren't you just deleting the inevitable?  I personally value my parents support but I know they don't always approve of my decisions.
relationship_advice,3dnk06,k00porative,14,Fri Jul 17 18:47:43 2015 UTC,"Apologies if this sounds harsh but this is my give-it-to-you-straight interpretation. It sounds like you guys were good together, had a lovely relationship and you love each other dearly but unfortunately it has come to an end. It sounds like he is curious about being alone and independent for whatever reasons could be to see if be finds his feet etc. The problem is where he loves you he is technically telling the truth right now about not wanting to break up with you for good. The issue comes when you give him this break and then he realises he does not want to be with you and his feelings haven't come back. Then there is the awkward situation where you've waited for him to come back but then he doesn't and ultimately you end up all heartbroken. I know its hard and horrific but...if you can find strength, just let him go and move on yourself. Make it all or nothing. He either commits whole heartedly or you both go your separate ways. It will help you overcome your social anxieties and depression because although it's sad and painful at first, you'll be forced to stand on your own two feet and you'll feel empowered for doing so. You want to be with someone who is head over heels in love with you. You will find someone else eventually who you can share the same experiences with. Try not to dwell on the fact it's him and him only you want right now to hug and kiss etc. It's very unlikely his feelings will return. But you can handle this. I know you feel a mess but use this time to focus on yourself. See friends, read, have a bath, walk outside and get better and stay healthy. Best case be returns after realising he made a silly mistake, worst case he does not return. Either way, you're healthy and alive and you had the wonderful experience of being with him :) good luck and feel better soon. Get outside your room and clear your head"

relationship_advice,3dnk06,LyssaBrisby,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:50:07 2015 UTC,"Centering your whole life around your boyfriend and depending too much on him is probably one of the reasons why he needs to get away. You need to be a whole, complete, happy person on your own before you are going to be a good partner. Otherwise instead of being a romantic dynamic, it's like a parent/child dynamic - where he feels he has to take care of you, instead of having a solid partner, to depend on and go forward with.  So turn back to yourself, your relationships with your friends, your goals, your hobbies, your interests. Apply energy there and improve yourself. Think of it this way - if you get out, socialize, reinvest in yourself and make yourself the best ""you"" you can be, that's the only chance you actually have of catching his eye again. And if he doesn't come back, all that work you've put into yourself is to the good anyway. Heck, you might find you outgrow him!"
relationship_advice,3dnk06,Lazy_IT_guy,6,Sat Jul 18 03:57:38 2015 UTC,"There are cute sayings like - a break is just an appetizer for a break-up.   I'm glad you're on the positive end and becoming more secure. But I still hear you relying on him for happiness, but I could be wrong. This won't mean much now, because you're in the situation, but you have to build up your own life, your own happiness your own friends, etc, to the point where a breakup, well, isn't as rough.   Let's say you just got a new job, making double the money, you are going to a concert next week with friends (front row, omg) you have a vacation planned in a month, you are going to yoga classes twice a week, you have to go get a dress for a friend's wedding 2 days before the vacation, and you may paint your room/house a different color. When a bad thing happens, you have so much to be thankful for. I'm sure you do, but you may have lost sight. You're so busy that while it does suck and you may cry during lunchtime at work in front of your boss, it'll all work out.   You have to find a guy that fits into your life. And give it your all for someone to look past the negative. Sure it may have been a negative time, and that may have been his reason. Or maybe he just wants a change. For whatever reason, he still wants a break. For me, I'd rather dump than to be dumped. I've been through breaks before, and I realized I have more self respect and more confidence when I ditch the person then and there. But I also believe you should see things through.   The only way he'll come back to you is if you honor the break, play your cards right, and plan for the worst/hope for the best. And those are - 100% do not reach out to him, do not call, text, email, FB, no cutesy photos or anything that you want to show him because it reminded you of him. Nothing. Let him miss you. if he texts you ""just want to make sure you're doing okay."" Wait a day or two, and say - I'm good :) or At my family's house. Leave it at that. No questions. Nothing. You need to focus on your new goals, short term and long term.   Overall, if he wanted to be with you, he would be. A break after 3 years - well, it doesn't matter what the excuse is, it's an excuse. But you absolutely need to compromise on what the terms of the break are - No Sex or No Comment. Will there be dating? Is there someone else? Don't ask ""well when will you know?"" - it's not a try out or a role call. Don't force it. if there's someone else, or if he wants to date around - maybe break it off there, or just leave him hanging after the break. Sorry, but you shouldn't be second best.    I just cried, and screamed into a pillow, and punched the pillow, and had trouble breathing, I basically had an anxiety attack a hundred times in a row.    Then what would be so bad about a breakup? You did everything someone who may have been dumped, experienced. The number one thing is to have self respect. This is your break too. From him. I'm sure he's not perfect, but anyways, he sure isn't now. I'm never a fan of breaks. I either don't respond to them anymore, making it easier for everyone. If he wants to be with you, he'd come see you, and beg for you back. He wants the easy way out. I recommend you don't take him back, and let him hunt you down. He'll be thinking - how am I going to break it off with her for good, for the next 1 week to 1-2 months, and if he can't get a hold of you - then he'll begin to wonder. I recommend getting your stuff back together, and maybe try tinder."

relationship_advice,3dnk06,Artful_Dodger_42,2,Fri Jul 17 20:38:30 2015 UTC,"Good!  We've all been there. And this will only make you stronger. In a sick sense, you need to go through a breakup. You need to know the template it takes to get back on your feet. And I recommend getting out of the house. Going out with old friends. Go hang out with your family for dinners or on Sat/Sunday. Don't be afraid to go to the movies by yourself. You can't talk to anyone anyway - Going to the movies has helped me a few times. For online dating or whatever, just meet up for coffee and a bagel. It can be 30 minutes or end up spending time walking around the park with someone.   You'll be so much closer to finding out if this guy is right for you, and you'll have even more to offer in your next relationship. Maybe your BF just needed alone time, and felt he couldn't help you in that way, and just needed a breather. But there may be that someone out there that just got dumped today or cheated on, wonder who (you) will be his next GF. Cheers."

relationship_advice,3dons9,showersinger123,4,Sat Jul 18 00:05:33 2015 UTC,"I had an ex do this; he cheated, I caught him, we split up, then he hounded me for three years.  I got into another relationship, he kept calling.  I stopped answering, he kept calling.  When my other relationship ended, I thought, ""I might as well give him another shot, he's been apologizing and begging me back for three years; if I don't, I'll always wonder about him.""  We got back together, he cheated on me within a couple of months.  You've already seen who this guy is, don't let him confuse you about it.  Go no contact.  I blocked my ex on everything, changed my number, still couldn't get rid of him, so if this helps at all:  how I finally got him to leave me alone was by appealing to his ego.  I told him I was having an impossible time getting over him because he kept turning up, and could he please stop contacting me so that I could move on.  It had been about six years at that point, but for some reason, that worked."

It could be two things, first you could be just another iron in the fire, I see allot of one-itis on this board but most guys just try to get their foot in the door any chance they get and they have their foot in a ton of doors, one of them will open eventually, maybe it will be yours.  The other thing is that he could just be desperately needy, Men ad women can be deep empty pits of need that can never be filled. So he may really want you, you could be the best thing that has ever happened to him and yet its not enough.  Tell him your not interested, we had our day, time to move on, I have moved on."

relationship_advice,3dpran,modkillafirefux,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:10:41 2015 UTC,"She sounds more like a narcissist than anything just judging by how she criticizes your appearance and demands to be taken somewhere ""nicer"". The whole rocking and crying over you not returning an ""I love you"" after two months is incredibly concerning. That looks the most like BPD out of all of your examples, but without more background it's hard to tell.  Regardless, I think it's best you move on. However, some sage wisdom - if you keep finding yourself in the same situations and wonder ""why does this keep happening to me?"", chances are that you're reason. You're the common link. Either you just pick the wrong women, or you're doing something that causes the women you're with to have meltdowns. I would go with the former and try to find a different type of woman than you usually go for."
relationship_advice,3doy86,Random_throaway789,3,Sat Jul 18 01:42:35 2015 UTC,"She has to come to terms with this, I mean its probably fair by this time to say that she will not pass this hurdle, its time to call it .   I am probably asking the obvious but will her current scores prevent her from any school ? or does she have her heart set on certain schools ? I assume she would have set her sights lower if it were possible.  But she needs to come to terms with this in her own way, she already resents you so she will definately shoot the messenger if you start talking to her about moving on to new life goals.  This could also be the beginning of the end for the two of you, you can see she is not going to make it and you have made it handily, its not right that she resents you for being smart enough for this not to mention she seems to be blaming you for a number of things that you dont deserve. Of course this is eating her up but it may not stop, she could become bitter and resentful of you and life.  Your life paths are already going in different directions and they will continue to do so."

I assume she would have set her sights lower if it were possible.   Umm, her current scores may actually be enough. It's hard to say because 1.)she hasn't done a proper diagnostic test in years, so don't really know what her likely score is. 2.) she may be able to apply under a favorable category (Indigenous person), which can lower the requirements fairly substantially. It's unclear if she would or wouldn't qualify for that, though.   I just don't think she will ever actually write the test since the anxiety keeps getting worse  Thanks for your advice. sucks feeling like you're stuck between a rock and a hard place."

relationship_advice,3doy86,1fuathyro,3,Sat Jul 18 05:21:54 2015 UTC,"I can see why one would feel 3 years is too long to try for something . I didn't even take the GRE and gave up the major that required it (medical as well) because I just didn't think I could be competitive enough with my score and the college I would have been applying to actually based the majority of the entrance acceptance on the GRE score.   That's NOT giving up, it's being practical. Now, having said that-I am considerably older than your GF so I kind of jumped on that band wagon wayyy too late.   Maybe she can keep trying? OR maybe she can switch her major to something medical related but just not ""medical school"" per se. I was going to major in Occupational Therapy(OT)...not sure if the MCAT is worse than the GRE (probably not) but tell her to take a gander at that. She's probably already satisfied the pre-reqs for the OT and look it up -the job prospects are GOOD and the pay is less than a doctor but nothing to sneeze at. And EVERYONE who I have ever known who did OT loved their job. It's rewarding and it pays well-what more can  you ask for?"

OR maybe she can switch her major to something medical related but just not ""medical school"" per se.   I feel that the depression that flows from her constant wrestling w/the MCAT has kind of sabotaged other opportunities that she had. For instance, after she finished her undergrad she got accepted into a very selective grad program that (IMO, at least) could have gotten her basically the career she said she wanted. She attended for two months then dropped out. During those two months she routinely had mental breakdowns over not being able to do the MCAT and not being where she wanted to be.   Now she's in a different graduate program but, again, it feels kinda half hearted on her part. She's not happy there because it's not med school. I feel like the depression and self doubt she feels as a result of the test kind of prevents her from doing the normal kind exploration and personal development people our age are supposed to and you suggest.   My upset doesn't stem so much from the fact that she's tried for x years, it's more that that trying has lead to x years of pretty serious depression and anxiety that I think has spilt over into other parts of our lives."

relationship_advice,3doy86,trueriptide,3,Sat Jul 18 06:35:32 2015 UTC,"If she has legitimate, documented anxiety, she can get extended time and other accommodations on the MCAT.

Throw in your past history with a cheating SO and it makes the trust even harder to maintain.   Your ex didn't just cheat on you, but did so with your best friend. Cheating is hard enough to recover from and this would make it harder.  While we try to not let past relationship issues come up in new relationships, your gf must realize how sketchy she is seeming and that with your past ultimate betrayal, she is hurting herself as well as you.   It's been 8 months. Do you see yourself spending the rest of your life with this woman? It seems like a lot of damage has already occurred. And while you were still early in your relationship when she cheated on you, she created that doubt in your mind from the beginning. If she can't be open and honest at this stage, while understanding where you're coming from, it doesn't seem there is a long and happy future ahead of you.   Sorry for all your situations. While the cheating is hard to get past, you will eventually with the right person. Your happiness is the most important. Don't forget to take care of yourself."

And I don't know how long after her break up it was before you two kids got together but it's a possibility that she's ""taking it out on you"" (not wittingly, not even maliciously, but all the same it's hurting you and unfair.)

You're not married; Just tell her you don't like the way you feel in this relationship and leave. Who cares whether she's sleeping with him or not?

relationship_advice,3dppfo,MasonDeane,2,Sat Jul 18 06:23:53 2015 UTC,"If partying like that is worst nightmare, isn't it fortunate that she has friends who will party with her so you don't have to?  People can have multiple interests, enjoy spending time doing multiple different types of things.  Just because she enjoys partying with a friend does not mean that she finds what you two do together boring or inadequate.   I'm not exactly sure what you would want to confront her with when she gets back. It sounds like you're feeling insecure but she hasn't done anything wrong, and making her feel bad/guilty about doing something she enjoys with a friend when she knows you would hate it, will absolutely make you seem needy and a little petty. If anything, you can ask her to make sure she's enjoying activities you two do together and if there's anything she'd like for the two of you to do during your time together, but anything more will come across as if you are jealous and that she's not allowed to have a good time without you."

Every time we had any sort of disagreement she would get very defensive or just straight say that she didn't want to talk about it anymore because it was too hard or making her anxious. Most if not all of our problems never got taken care of because she refused to even have a discussion.  She left just about a month ago with no explanation and cut all contact with me. We were together for almost ten years and lived together the entire time. Take from that what you will.

Not only have i been a depressed, bitter, cynic for as long as I can remember this hasn't done much to change my mind. I was with her since i was sixteen and didn't see an end in sight, especially in the way it ended so abruptly. I don't think I could be in a relationship right now my trust, ego, and confidence took quite a serious blow.

relationship_advice,3dn2ro,sinscriven,5,Sat Jul 18 07:24:10 2015 UTC,"I think there are a couple ways to think about this. My BF and I have had similar issues, but slightly different. I'm like you in that I really enjoy debating issues and having deep conversations about certain topics (I'm just finishing law school...). I usually have opinions on things. My BF, on the other hand, does not really enjoy having these types of conversations, or at least, on the topics that I enjoy discussing.   I readily admit that part of that is my tendency to have strong opinions about things, and I tend to stubbornly defend them. However--that's something that I've been working on and, it appears, that he has almost endless amounts of patience. He actually really makes me think about different perspectives on topics I have always felt so ""sure"" about.  HOWEVER, sometimes I just have to talk to other people. I'm not really interesting in finding the end of BF's patience, so I sometimes find other people to discuss certain topics with.   What I'm getting at is--maybe this is something she can overcome, with patience on your part. But she's not going to overcome it unless she comes to the realization that she's just being stubborn (like I did). If you tell her this- it will not get the desired effect. It will probably make her feel more defensive, and maybe also hurt her feelings (although I'm assuming you wouldn't raise the schooling issues with her if you talked to her about it).   Maybe if there are certain topics she just doesn't want to talk about - you can find other people to discuss them with. However, this isn't really a solution, especially if any of the topics involve issues you need to be able to communicate about for your daily lives or future. If this is the case--you two might consider some sort of counseling for communication issues.   If it's just a more ""recreational"" type of conversation, well in that case you might just have to recognize that not everyone enjoys doing the same things--and these types of conversations just might not interest her. Partners don't have to share interest in every activity, you then have to decide what's more important to you: being able to share this interest with her, or being with her."

relationship_advice,3dn2ro,ViolitD,3,Fri Jul 17 22:51:40 2015 UTC,"It is possible that her intellectual insecurities are fueling her really defensive attitude towards you trying to have stimulating conversation with her, but that won't solve the bigger problem.  You indicated you're a guy that needs intellectual chemistry for your relational satisfaction, and your girlfriend does not seem capable of fulfilling your needs. She does not seem to value education or even knowledge itself. Any disagreement to her is not an opportunity to explore and empathize but a battle she must win or she bolts when she can't deal with it.  Even if you set aside political/philosophical conflict, what happens when you need to start talking about big relationship things like long-term savings plans, IRAs, 401Ks, Stocks, etc etc. Is she going to lose her marbles at all the acronyms and nebulous financial concepts and run out the door and leave you having to figure it all out on your own?  If she has your children and refuses to vaccinate then, what are you going to do?  By now the relationship is already taking damage because you two are unable to resolve conflict. Any opportunity to connect with her on an intellectual level is met with another nasty conflict that causes you to resort to deflection and avoidance tactics, laying another brick on the wall between you and her and hurting your happiness with the relationship even more.  Both of you need to work on your communications skills and marriage shouldn't even be in the deck right now if you can't manage something as simple as a conversation about science without damaging your relationship; However, I think long-term, you need to ask yourself if intellectual chemistry is this imporatnt to you, then perhaps you need to find a partner with compatible ideals and desire for that level of communication with you. I feel that this isn't ever really going to get better because you can't teach your girlfriend how to not be ignorant and to value knowledge and casual debate."

Whenever we disagree about serious topics she becomes extremely defensive and refuses to listen to reason.  This is also the main reason why she's been in over 15 relationships in the last 3 years.  I still consider her one of my closest friends, but there's no way in hell I'd ever consider being in a relationship with her.   Talk to her about this.  If you can find out why she becomes so defensive, you could probably work through it together (in my friend's case it was because her family would never support her decisions).  If not, it'll just get worse for both of you in the future."

I'd be willing to bet 90+% of those couple never follow through with it. If there wasn't a kid involved, I'd say agree to her plan for the sake of low drama and then live your life like you'd never be with her again, as that's probably the case.   But you have a kid. So at some level, you're going to be connected for the next 14.5 years. You should tell her you agree with each of you going your own way but that you think you should see where life takes both of you before talking about your future together. But you need to focus on your daughter and how this is going to work with her. Is your gf taking her when she moves? Are you doing a joint custody thing? You need to focus on the issues related to your kid, not what could potentially happen years from now with your gf."

If you guys end up back together that's fine, but she shouldn't count on it. My partner and I dated all through high school but broke up shortly after, we ended up reconnecting 4 years later and have been together for almost 3 years now. For us it worked out, we both go to do what we wanted, we both were briefly engaged (to other people), basically ""sowed our wild oats"".

If she wants to be a single mother that's her choice, let her know she can be a single mother with co-parenting shit with you and nothing more. Or ask her what she wants to do with custody and pursue a custodial agreement which should be done.   Just be upfront.  Her immaturity would sway me away from a relationship too."

Where as I feel like my girlfriend feels like our daughter is just mostly something that we have to deal with in our lives. Don't get me wrong, my gf is a good mother and plays with our daughter, but she just doesn't see her in the same way that I see our daughter. I had hoped when she was born, that would cause my gf to mature a little bit but I can honestly say that she hasn't changed much at all in the past 3+years."
relationship_advice,3dpdkh,kc1328,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:32:20 2015 UTC,"Wow, you guys are young, so she was 17 when she had the baby, wow. It seems to be rare that a teen couple with a baby stays together or even gets together in the first place so that shows allot of maturity and you seem mature beyond your years.  This is a tough situation because you both basically cut your teen years short by having the baby. So she feels the pull of being single and free of responsibilites, im sure she must be envious of her peers who are single and she wants the same thing,  The first question I have is what will happen to your daughter  if she does move ? My sense she is leaving her behind, she didnt say she wants to live the single Mom life ? If so are you ready to take your daughter on fulltime ?  Considering your history I would view this as a breakup and really I would not hang on to the idea of getting back together. You will have to keep in touch if your both going to be involved in raising your daughter.  So she does her thing, you do yours and who knows perhaps she will tire of being single and want to get back sooner when she gets it out of her system or she could really just move on, college is a big change, she could end up in another relationship etc In a sense its her opinion that you will both get back together, you are going your own ways and really who knows where you will be in 2,4,5 years when you are supposedly going to get back together and really you have a choice and can you really say what your choice will be 2,4,5 years down the road ?  It looks like you agree with her but she doesnt seem to be leaving with you much of choice anyway. So go out live your life and perhaps one day you will be drawn back together but I wouldnt be losing any sleep over it."

We both graduated on time and things were pretty good with us. I feel like she thinks she's missing out on certain aspects of her life and she wants to experience those. I, however, don't really care about those kind of things and mostly just focus on taking care of things around the house and our daughter. I'm pretty much convinced that if she does move away, I don't want to continue our relationship. But, even if she decides she wants to stay, I'm not entirely sure what I want anymore either.

Some girls are bad at making moves and some girls are bad at reading signals and too often those girls end up in the same drunken cab. But I digress...   If you want to turn this into a potential LDR thing, you probably have a chance. It sounds like you connected on a level beyond casual hookup. That's super hard to assume at this point though. Some people really do put in that much effort just for a bang and you missed that boat. I don't think that's it though.   Just keep talking to her as a friend, maybe flirting here and there. The distance is going to force things to move a little slowly, especially at first. I think you'll find out pretty quickly whether she's into you in that way and/or willing to take the time and effort to continue something remotely."

Cos I'm sure if someone went off on a guy about that you'd see an interesting reaction from some particular groups around reddit.   Why is saying dicks before chicks okay but not hos before bros.   Both seem to imply that opposite gender somehow has less rights to the backing of the other.

Its perfectly normal, albeit sad, for her to pull away after being called out. Your gf's only other option was to continue to pay this tool's bills and watch her best friend fuck up. I've been through something similar and even if you know you had no alternative it is still really sad. Losing a best friend is a huge loss. We all talk about how much it hurts to lose a SO but we rarely talk about how much it hurts to have a friend break up. Instead of telling her over and over again that she did the only thing she could do, tell her its okay to be sad, to mourn her lost friendship. Then maybe try some more group activities and things like that, hopefully she can forge a new close friendship. Like any pain this will lessen over time."

Some people literally do not realize they're wrong,  and find the approach, such as from his girlfriend,  to be a direct offensive,  because clearly they have something against something she sees no problem with.   Objectively she's being wrong.   Subjectively  to the sister, his girlfriend is.   So I much doubt this is a case of prideful denial,  and much more so a bit of deluded thinking toward the boyfriend."
relationship_advice,3dn462,SlimJay,22,Fri Jul 17 16:50:46 2015 UTC,I would bust out the phone and record him while he has his outbursts. Then when he is off the game for a while and calm show him. Tell him how it makes you feel.

My solution to calm  him is to go and hug him (whenever he is dead ofc, no idea what game your bf  playes but if its CS:GO , yea) just do the right timing with the hugs and he will get calm ^ .. for a while at least its not perminant so multiple hugs are included in his gaming time :3 good luck ^"

Telling someone to calm down won't work. People have to learn to be self reflective and realize how their making other people feel. Have an honest conversation with him some time when he's not playing video games and talk to him about how it makes you feel and how you're worried the neighbors will react."

You can't know a persons personality based on this brief discription.      Just have an honest normal conversation about the behaviour at a time when he's not raging out.

If he were my roommate I'd tell him he can either calm the hell down or search for a new place.  How to calm him down? If the video recording doesn't work, try tapping him on the shoulder every time he does that. I imagine you've already tried persuasion, right?"
relationship_advice,3dn462,Chriah,2,Sat Jul 18 06:46:10 2015 UTC,Okay so my girlfriend corrects me often for yelling and slamming my fists on the table. What she does Is she looks at me and says my name then tells me to calm down. Not in a demanding/stern way at all just out of concern. She smiles and thinks it's funny but doesn't want me to disturb anyone. Sometimes she just comes and rubs my shoulders or hugs me or kisses me and that makes me pretty damn happy. I don't see yelling or cheering while playing games any different then if someone was playing a physical sport. And to me it's just part of the fun. Don't force him to be a mindless zombie. If I was him I would try to limit my outbursts to one word and maybe one good fist pound double arm swing on the sofa armrest or something soft like that. Remember video games might be his outlet for stress. All these people saying that it's not normal or that he is gonna beat you based on this tidbit of information alone are crazy.  Do not:  -tap him on the shoulder that is incredibly annoying and makes me cringe thinking about if someone did that to me. -Pull the plug Don't control him. You are not his parent. -play a different game Obviously he likes this game. Otherwise he wouldn't be playing it and be invested enough to get upset. -show the recording of his angry outbursts to anyone but him. Obviously he feels comfortable yelling at a video game when you are around. Don't betray that comfort! He knows how stupid and silly it looks but who cares with its your loving girl who sees you acting the fool.   Edit: I've seen some more comments here. And I am so glad you have to sense to ignore  them. So anyways if one word outbursts or one good fist to object bash isn't okay then a different solution needs to be found. He needs to express himself physically/verbally. That much is clear. So find some way to allow him to do that without upsetting the neighbors.   If the anger ever transfers from the video games to you That's when the problem starts. Everything I said is how my girlfriend deals with my childish ways and how I would feel if some of the presented solutions were attempted on me. It feels great to pound on the desk once or twice and to yell a few choice words but I have never let that anger transfer to anyone/anything else. It actually is a great stress reliever and makes me feel better about other things.  If the problem persists and the police get called perhaps that will be the solution. I know you said you own and mentioned it being an old house so perhaps a remodel adding some sound proofing would help. I know you shouldn't have to sound proof to fix this problem but It's a nice thing to have no matter what.

You don't just talk to someone once and then end the relationship. That's not advice. Anyone can figure out that ending the relationship or giving an ultimatum is an option. They're looking for people who have similar experiences or different approaches to the problem. The people who have neither are the ones saying to just walk away.   Also the person who gets dumped because they are crazy jealous, controlling, abusive (physical, verbal or mental) or a cheater does learn a lesson.   That's fine, but we're a) not agreed that the people not represented in these threads are crazy jealous, controlling, abusive, or cheating people, and b) we're not here to help those people, we're here to help OPs who want to improve their relationships. They're coming here because they want a more nuanced answer than 'just end it' unless they specifically ask 'is now the time to end it.'"

They're looking for people who have similar experiences or different approaches to the problem.   I have experiences with people getting angry and throwing temper tantrums like a 2 year old.

I'm not anywhere close to consider ending the relationship over the fact that he is being loud/angry while playing videogames.   Maybe I was unclear in OP that we have a very happy relationship, he is very kind and caring, but gets very involved and dedicated in things he does (such as videogames, which may make him quite angry if his friends on the other line of TS is subpar)."
relationship_advice,3dn462,deskclerk,4,Fri Jul 17 19:53:24 2015 UTC,"Whenever anyone is aggressive or upset or fuming, as he seems to be quite frequently, telling him to calm down is never going to work. It'll only make him more upset.    The real issue here is that he's an angry person. He hides it well for a time, but when he doesn't get his way it explodes during video games. He WILL behave like that in other aspects of his life after some time. People who slam fists and scream and shout at video games don't limit that behaviour to video games. It is going to invade into his relationship with you.    The answer is not in how to calm him down. You can't control him. But you can control you. Every time he does this, you could leave the house and tell him why. ""I'm leaving for a few hours because I will not be around someone who gets so angry at video games."" That way he will be paying for his anger by missing out on you. He will only have himself to blame. Good luck."

I rage at games (MW3 only really). My girl got me to settle down by telling me how stupid I sounded AFTER I was done with my session and had calmed down. It made me think of this video of a freak out  Main thing to do is talk, preferably before gaming for the day. If you can't have a conversation about what things upset you, there is something very wrong."

If you don't value her presence then the relationship isn't going to last. There must be a boundary set when he's exhibiting this immature behaviour.
relationship_advice,3dn462,MonsoonAndStone,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:03:29 2015 UTC,"I had this problem with my husband for a while.  What worked for us was a combination of two factors:  first the hugs suggested elsewhere in the comments.  When he'd get loud or angry, I'd just walk over and bear-hug him from behind.  No words - ""calm down"" or ""it's just a game"" are sure-fire ways to set someone off.  The second was the escalation of that.  If after warning hug he continued to get louder/angrier, the power was pulled.  for the same reason as you - we lived in an apartment, with thin walls and a pushy landlord and obnoxious neighbors.  NEVER START WITH THE YANKING OF THE POWER CORD.  Not only can that damage electronics, it will piss off the gamer.  That was the ""shut up or the cops will be called"" move.  I only had to threaten to do it once or twice - just walking over, grabbing the cord in one hand, and giving him a significant look was enough to at least get him to lower his voice.  There was also a LOT of talking.  Like, lots and lots of talking.  About how the noise was bad, about solutions for staying quiet, about how his anger made me feel.  No matter what you do, everything needs to be talked about and agreed on."

Respecting the trust of a friend and keeping your mouth shut.   What should you do? Tell your friend that while you love her to death, you do not appreciate that she's put you in a position where you must either violate her trust or violate your morals by not telling her GF.  Then tell her you can't have her in your life and close the door. It seems severe, but cancerous people are bad for your life. Why not find someone who does not push your limits like this?  Or, if your friend solves it on her own, within days, keep the freindship but make clear you are not a confidant if that requires violating your own morality. You are't here to judge her, but you want no part or knowlege in/of cheating."

You can encourage her to tell her gf and encourage her to possibly go to therapy to figure out why she has this incessant need to cheat on her significant others, but other than that, there's not much else to do.  If you go directly to her gf you risk ruining your friendship."

I have a friend who is a bit similar except her cheating is on partners who cheat themselves/aren't in the relationship seriously either.

It will help you, too; ""Why Does He Do That?"" by Lundy Bancroft. Grab it off of Amazon but don't let him see you reading it. He doesn't love you, he loves controlling you.  ""An abusive man expects catering, and the more positive attention he receives, the more he demands. He never reaches a point where he is satisfied, where he has been given enough. Rather, he gets used to the luxurious treatment he is receiving and soon escalates his demands.  Your happiness in a relationship depends greatly on your ability to get your needs heard and taken seriously. If these decisions are taken over by an abusive or controlling partner, you experience disappointment after disappointment, the constant sacrificing of your needs. He, on the other hand, enjoys the luxury of a relationship where he rarely has to compromise, gets to do the things he enjoys, and skips the rest. He shows off his generosity when the stakes are low, so that friends will see what a swell guy he is. The abuser ends up with the benefits of being in an intimate relationship without the sacrifices that normally come with the territory. That’s a pretty privileged lifestyle.""  The book explains everything you need and will open your eyes. It also gives detailed information on how to get out safely!  Good luck!"

relationship_advice,3doom0,quizzical,-4,Sat Jul 18 08:36:57 2015 UTC,"Let's say you guys work it all out. What's the point? Where do you think it will lead? Kids? Marriage? 5 kids from 3 baby daddies? Child support coming in from each one of you? What incentive do women have to be with just one man when she can collect a check from each one of you? More and more government benefits and food stamps for each child if she decides to be a stay at home mom?  And now counties are tacking the cost of those benefits onto the male in addition to the child support you owe. So I ask you. Do you really want this relationship to carry on? Do you want any relationship to lead to marriage and children?  I tell my sons find a woman who's in her 30's 40's alimony and child support coming in from the ex(s), just wants to have fun and won't pressure you into children and marriage like the young ones do until it's game over for you, the threat of jail time if you can't pay your child support. But yeah, a woman with her tubes tied bro is a major bonus. Puberty is the beginning of the end. Stay with your parents and forget about growing up. It's overrated. There's no reward for the family man. It's a life of slavery.  Find yourself someone local.  LTR's are foolish. No matter how hideous you are, there's always a fish in the sea."

relationship_advice,3don79,1fuathyro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:51:09 2015 UTC,"I don't know how you feel about this but perhaps she can cut her hours down and with the extra hours do some volunteer work at places doing what she likes. Like working at an animal hospital, or a human hospital, or doing flower arranging, or at a shelter, or at a non-profit (where they help people with disabilities, for example) etc....whatever she ""likes""...she may find her calling?  Also, if you could pay for her to see a therapist (if she can't) that would help tremendously. Seeing someone weekly that can help her process her feelings (including the ones when you are away, for exmaple) will not only help her but you too, inadvertently. ;)  Also, I'd like to say that you are awesome for wanting to help her but just remember that she has to be active in her own life too. Suggest the above...getting her connected to mental health services (for the therapist) may be the best thing to do first then she can transition into the volunteering...just in case the reason she's being 'this way' is maybe do to developing an issue with depression etc.   Anyway, good luck and let us know how it goes!"
relationship_advice,3don79,1fuathyro,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:28:47 2015 UTC,"I would totally be for her cutting down her work hours.  I guess there's 2 reasons why it's not so easy.  1) She feels she needs to work as much as she can.  2) Due to the nature of her work, if she started turning down shifts she might get offered less in future.  Personally, I'm not too bothered.  I want her to be happy, but it is a double edged sword.  If she works a lot she is unhappy about her job.  If she doesn't work a lot she is unhappy because she feels useless and is more reliant on me (personally I would have no problem paying all the rent etc, but I understand her willingness to be independent in those regards).  It's a tricky situation.  That all being said, the volunteer work sounds good.  She previously worked as a live in support worker for people with disabilities, and now does similar kind of work although part time and paid.  So don't think the human support is an option for volunteering, but animals or something else is definitely an option.  I had thought about the therapist thing, but only really considered it a bit to myself.  Will think about it and discuss it with her soon I think, might wait to see how the holiday goes (currently we are only worried about the fact that we are totally unprepared for the trip :p)  Thanks for comments and advice, really appreciated.

Life isn't like the movies, people don't usually make peace with loved ones they've fucked over just because they're dying.

relationship_advice,3do2fq,Iamnotanasshole1234,4,Fri Jul 17 21:07:29 2015 UTC,It is extremely inappropriate of your mother to lay this on you. You are not responsible for their relationship nor the mental health issues of your father. They are in a crisis and must seek professional help. You can not be included in this process and must leave it for them to sort out.   You are not equipped to deal with this and you should limit your support to engouraging them to seek help.

And she does not love you either.   Even if her family has a history of ""long relationships"" (whatever that means), that still pits the odds against you.   You're both immature and you sound really clingy and honestly you're probably making her really uncomfortable.  She's almost certainly telling you she loves you out of obligation.    Telling someone you love them while not being certain of it is really sad.   Calm down and don't take this high school relationship so serious. You're going insane over nothing. Have fun, enjoy it and maybe there is a teeny tiny chance you'll end up together forever (very teeny tiny chance!). You'll scare her off with this behavior though."

Would you stick with her no matter what? You know you're in love if, when that love feeling isn't there, you still stick with her.   You're probably not. Heck, I consider myself in love with my SO, but if it came down to it, who knows how committed I'd really be?  I say have fun and don't stress. As the other guy said, it's high school. You don't have to be in love yet."

You will meet someone new in the future.   However, once you dump her, you WILL have a period of time,  probably at least a few months, where you'll be single.  Not alone -- single. It'll take time to readjust to the single life, even if you hate her, but it happens to everyone who breaks up.  Just think though... being single HAS to be better than being around company that makes you feel like shit.

It may seem scary or harsh, but think about it. He always has to have his way; now it's just where you go on dates. In a few years if you guys get closer or more serious, he could be this way about financial decisions or other big issues. You don't want to be stuck with someone like that.   You sound like an awesome girlfriend who is giving him way more than he deserves. Maybe you should try telling him what you told us. If he doesn't change, then he's probably not worth your time.   Also on a side note, boys who like to stay inside all the time are the worst. If all your dates are make out sessions (idk if that's what's going on with the ""video games"" here) then he's probably just using you."
relationship_advice,3dmlzk,illreadthisreally,5,Fri Jul 17 14:28:41 2015 UTC,"I really hate to be that person, but you're a woman among men. I honestly don't know what the dynamic is in the group, nor your level of education, but the guy that talks over you and questions you? I feel like hey may do that because you're a woman. It's actually a pretty classic move, even subconsciously, I saw it in classrooms all the time. Women apologizing before they ask a question, guys speaking over me when I am trying to make a point, it's a societal gender thing I think. You're not being an asshole, you're being assertive. He's being disrespectful of you and your opinion. From the outside looking in, I could be terribly wrong, but that's what I have experienced in the past.  I too struggle with credit where credit is due. Instead of e-mailing him the material you have found, bring a hard copy to present to him instead during the group. It may throw things off, but if you feel like he's ignoring you, he can't possibly then. That's the beauty of face to face interaction, people are often forced to acknowledge things, even if they verbally try to avoid the issue. Not only will he see it, but others will as well. They may ask you why you did that after, just explain that you have been sending stuff to him previously that he wasn't acknowledging and take the credit for what he's sent out before. There is nothing wrong with tooting your own horn, where people don't recognize you, you must recognize yourself."

relationship_advice,3dmlzk,headphonez,2,Fri Jul 17 23:12:09 2015 UTC,"If you're not telling your friend that you want credit for the submissions, he can't possibly know.  It would be nice of him to say, ""illreadthisreally sent this in"" before sharing it with the group, but if you're not going to ask him to do that, don't be hurt that he doesn't.  He might think you're just helping him out.  You're becoming the guy (gal) behind the guy.  Your tldr says it:  you want to be seen as smart, and like you're contributing.  So do it; contribute on your own.  Sometimes, that one dude will be snide about it.  Big deal, you've already dealt with that.    I think I understand your thinking (I love being the guy behind the guy):  you can contribute whatever you want and see how it plays out, without suffering any embarrassment for the things that don't go well.  You also get no glory when your idea is a success, though, and that gets old.  I think, with the speaking over the guy that interrupts you, you're becoming more assertive on your own within this group, so just keep letting that happen.  Next time you find some document you know the group will be interested in, you submit it, not to your friend.  You've already seen and dealt with the negative side of this group, you can handle it.  You have to handle it to get the positive stuff, and it's worth it."

relationship_advice,3do7gx,Sinjun13,3,Fri Jul 17 22:31:02 2015 UTC,"This is totally, 100% normal.  Having a boyfriend (or girlfriend or husband, wife, partner, whatever) doesn't preclude noticing and feeling attraction for other people.  It also doesn't make you a bad person.  Acting on those feelings would. You didn't do anything wrong. It was just fleeting moment of attraction.  What you should do is... nothing.  Telling your boyfriend about it is pretty pointless, considering there isn't any wrongdoing.  It'll only serve to make him feel insecure.  Just keep it private.  It's going to happen again and again over the course of your life, so just understand now that it's part of being human and one of the things that actually makes monogamy and fidelity so special.  Letting the feelings happen without acting on them, and channelling that into your relationship with your partner will strengthen your bond with your partner.  Unless, of course, you find that you're so strongly attracted to someone else that you are unable to properly be a good partner.  In those cases, it's time to break up and move on.  Not fair to anyone involved. Losing interest in and attraction to partners is natural and normal too.  It happens.  Just because you've been with someone for a certain period of time doesn't mean you're obligated to stay forever.  Be a decent human being and recognize whether or not it's time to move on when those times come.  Otherwise, just don't worry about it so much!"

See what he says. It could be a segue to an amicable breakup, but maybe if he's having some problems he'll feel like opening up to you. I'm with a few others here-for me it would seem like he's planning on cheating if not actively cheating. It's not necessary to update your dating profile regularly as the main thing that changes is one's relationship status. Good luck."

When you feel sad and lonely remind yourself that she cared so little about you that she lied to you, cheated on you, and waited until she had moved away to break up with you like a coward.

It happens, and that could be all that is going on here; neither of you know how to deal with the situation and are trying to find reasons for something that is naturally occuring.  Nevertheless, she is responsible for her wellbeing - not you. Accept that your view on her life and what actions she should take are just one's opinion. Not that you necessarily are wrong in that those things would be benificiary for her, but it is her life, her descision and you just have to accept that she is lacking motivation.   Sometimes it helps to drag the person along when you partake in any of those activities. Don't expect her to be enthusiastic or have thoughts of salvation; just be glad you managed to activate them for a moment and hopeful you will see change in their mood with time.   If not, just accept that they are not you. Try to be as compassionate as you can, but also refrain from getting too involved; they need to find the motivation them selves. That is the key."

Don't shake her hand, shaking hands is a way of showing that you're setting boundaries, you shake hands with aquantences and with colleagues.   Go for the hug if after saying hi she seems like she is looking for more, generally I avoid it first date.  Establish some physical contact, whether hand holding or putting your arm around her, at some point during the date. The earlier the more memorable, and the stronger and more assertive you will seem, but she has to be ready for it.  A kiss before the end of the date is a good thing but don't push it."

What works for me is trying to stay focused on having a good time and getting to know your lady interest. I've gone on a lot of first dates and I can honestly tell you most of them don't work out (we both didn't click for whatever reason). The point is you both are interested at this point a successful first date is one where you can relax and get to know someone. Ask them questions about there family, what they do for work if they have any hobbies, where they went to school, ect. Remember you both decide if you are  still interested a day out two after the date. Think about how you feel after the date were you energized or was it just bla or worse.    Try to not sweat it and just try to concentrate on having fun and getting to know each other.   Oh and yes always start the date of with a hug and end with a hug.   In my experience it to many dates for things to finally click. It just takes time and effort and learning that you either click or you don't it's nothing personal."

Every though and emotion rolls by and we just have to have courage to let it go and let it be.   The whole future is written as we go along. Whatever mistakes you've made in the past doesn't have to be what you experience in the future. Change what you did wrong and let people think what they do."

relationship_advice,3dloah,GabrielD23,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:47:26 2015 UTC,"Does he really have control over her mouth. I would say not. It's something she has to choose to stop doing. Just in my experience you can keep fighting and lose energy pointing out the wrongs, but usually stops when you display a good example, let go of the wrongs, and focus on the right things people are doing. I know it doesn't make sense to you, but when you focus on what you want instead of what you don't want it really does work. Society teaches us to focus on all the negatives about a person. Fight and someone has to win. Then you just learn to be the bigger person put your energy where it is needed in your own actions and behaviors. When you're treating people with love, respect, set boundaries, and allow people the time to mature and grow, it does wonders. At least it has worked that way in my case. If it doesn't work, usually mean the other person has to many issues and thinking of their ego. And the question then becomes are they really worth your time and energy if they can't choose to do what is the right thing versus the wrong. Sounds kind of cruel to cut out negative people, but you are who you hang around, and I suppose if you want a healthy relationship, you have to be a healthy person, and hang out with healthy people."
relationship_advice,3dloah,Mattiemae,2,Sun Jul 19 08:21:33 2015 UTC,"Talking about your issues behind your back, especially to mutual friends, is a deal breaker. That said, she is also very young and immature. Situations like these are exactly how young people learn what works and what doesn't and what consequences they earn from that type of behavior. You are certainly well within your rights to end this. If you were in your 20's or 30's it's be obvious you should dump her. But you're not and neither is she. If this is the first time you've had to deal with this particular issue than I would have a long discussion about it and really get her to see how painful this is for you. Not only did she use her moment of weakness and anger to rant angrily about you to mutual friends, but those comments and the stain they make are not going to go away. Not only do you have to deal with the awkwardness around those people but, on the other side of it, now that she's ""over it"" and you guys have moved on, any nice thing she has to say about you to those people will be ignored. They're going to see you as this ""slimy dick"" and no matter what she says they are going to think she is stupid for staying with you. It makes BOTH of you look bad in the long run. I've been on the other side of this and listened to friends talk shit about their SO and when the fight is over and she's like ""he's so sweeeeet now"" in my mind I'm rolling my eyes over how dumb this girl is and if her SO is as controlling as she made him out to be she's even stupider for being continuously under his spell. Make her see that by talking badly about her partner, it also reflects on her in the long run. You guys are supposed to be a team, you against the other guys, and if she is unable to be mature enough to make your ""team"" successful than you need a new partner. If you feel the conversation leads to a reasonable resolution and you can continue a relationship you are also well within your rights to forgive her and continue. Just so long as she really does learn from this mistake."

Talk to her and express that it hurts you and try to find out what was said exactly and why she branded you as controlling  to her friends. You might think you not controling but she might see it diffrently so talk to her have a sit down and you both should talk about the things that bother you and cause issues and try to work on solutions to make them better if you can't come to an agreement than maybe it is time to move on but not before you tried things to make it work. I know you hurt , pissed off and upset but talk to her calmly try to avoid fighting and approach this in a calm , mature manner. If it turns into a fight just walk off and leave the issue until things clam down and try again these sort of issues need to be sorted without fights as anger clouds judgement."

relationship_advice,3djf8c,1fuathyro,14,Thu Jul 16 20:29:05 2015 UTC,People who want out of a marriage doesn't necessarily mean that the spouse is at fault. I think asking if his mom is a bad wife is really just blaming the wife for the bad behavior of her husband. If a husband does not like how his partner treats him-his 'excuse' shouldn't prompt him to cheat but to figure out what is happening in the marriage and engage his supposed 'wife' so that things can get better.   If you don't care about a person for any reason the thing to do is to leave and then do your crap. If you DO care about the person then you give them the opportunity to change.

Your dad is an adult. Relationships are about trust, love, communication, etc. If your dad is having a side line affair with another woman, I definitely think your mom should know. Because maybe there will be a chance to mend and correct the problem before it becomes too big of a burden for your family. Don't hold a grudge against your dad for his actions. Since you'll be alone with him for a week, I would casually mention something about your concern. Don't bombard him with accusations, as that will just put him on the defensive side and would cause a bigger stir.  And, even then, the relationship between your mom and dad is what would be at risk. It shouldn't change your/your sister's relationship with either parent.

Perhaps they are already separated and just trying to sort out how to tell the world of the coming divorce - and starting the search for new partners in the meantime? Perhaps a million things.  I know this is kinda scary and unsettling to think, but it's between your parents. Not you two and your parents. That's just escalating the number of drama points.

If that means talking to your dad, then go ahead. If it means ignoring it, that's fine too. If your dad is cheating he knows what he is risking and it's not your job to figure out how to make things right. it is his job to make sure you're safe and happy."

You might have an age gap but you are not on the same level and yes you're holding him back with your codependent behaviour.   So time to stop it right now. He needs space you're actually pushing him away.    I can tell he filters what he says to me like many husbands do to their wives and I don't like it   Not people who feel comfortable in their relationship he feels like he has to walk on eggshells around you.    I want him to be upfront to me and be honest all of the time.    And if you tried to talk to someone who reacts how you do, do you not think you'd clam up to?  He has a different sex drive, masturbation and sex are not the same, he doesn't want to have sex because you're probably turning him off significantly goading him into it when he doesn't want to. Twin that with all of the other issues. God I'm drying up picturing that.  So we have mismatched libidos. Communication issues, emotional manipulation, codependency issues, Trust issues. The list is endless.   And you're getting married? Jesus I'm downgrading this relationship maturity level to 16 year olds.   My guess is counselling, for you singular and couples. But if he refuses to go chances are he's not set on fixing this.   If you get married without spending at least a year or two on this, you'll be getting annulled a month later."

It's just hard stopping my behaviours of pushyness and controllingness, I suppose. And giving it time. How the fuck do I go on from that? I guess this weekend of him going away is one of my first steps in trying to give him space and give us time. It's just so hard for me to accept that he needs it, and he needs his space.  I can tell he loves me and cares about me and he pulls me in close all of the time. He doesn't feel like he is pushing me away, but I can definitely see it happening in the far future."

You do a majority of finding out who you are from ages 18 - 25, which includes a massive amount of emotional growth.

relationship_advice,3dm976,AngryPolarisBear,2,Fri Jul 17 14:37:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe you are projecting your own insecurity/anxiety onto your fiance. No one wants to be pressured (including you) and get drained by a relationship because that defeats the whole purpose of finding someone you love and enjoy spending time with.  I feel like you need some alone time (i.e. being single) before you can be mentally prepared. Not just a romantic relationship, but social interaction in general - maybe try being more polite and considerate/changing pov as if you would with a coworker. Just because two people are intimate, does not invalidate the need to be respectful."

You can absolutely change your behaviors. Keep moving in the direction of the person you want to become. That means choosing better behavior, and if it's too difficult on your own, gather the help you need to get it done.  I'm sorry it's so tough right now, but take time to celebrate that you've worked this hard :)"
relationship_advice,3dm976,macimom,15,Fri Jul 17 14:44:13 2015 UTC,yaaa- a mature 25 year old doesn't pitch a fit if her SO does stuff without her-she encourages it bc she realizes it is healthy for the relationship for each partner to enjoy their won friendships and activities as well as to share many friendships and activities.  A woman mature enough to get married would realize that its counterproductive to push someone to have sex with you.  You are SO not ready to get married that I almost think this post is a joke
relationship_advice,3dm976,crazyeddie123,6,Fri Jul 17 15:01:31 2015 UTC,"You know what?  Chilling by yourself sometimes is awesome.  You can do pretty much whatever the fuck you want without worrying about other people judging you (whether they actually would or not).  Instead of worrying about what he's up to, you need to learn to enjoy this downtime and make the most of it.   although he doesn't lie about big things, he still has issues with white lies (which he doesn't know I catch him in constantly).   That's a pretty common reaction to someone who gets angry and cries when no one is actually doing anything wrong.   Speaking of sex, I want it significantly more than he does. I want it everyday, and he probably wants it once or twice a week. I keep pushing him to have sex with me and then I realizing I am pushing him too hard and try to stop. I am masturbating like crazy and I don't even think about him at all when I masturbate anymore. I know he masturbates sometimes (one of his white lies, come on dear, I find the kleenexes!) and I have no idea why he won't just have sex with me.   Once or twice a week is pretty normal when you've been together for a while.  If you want him to want it more, you need to be sexy, not pushy.  Sexy is enticing, pushy triggers a completely different part of the brain that says ""No sex now, I've got to deal with this person making demands at me"".  And he masturbates sometimes because (a) people do that sometimes even when sex is available and (b) porn is always sexy and never, ever pushy."
relationship_advice,3dm976,LatteLaughter,7,Fri Jul 17 16:04:12 2015 UTC,"You may very well feel older than your age, but you aren't acting like it. A 25 year old woman does not throw tantrums and cry every time her BF wants to go out with his friends. In fact, when my (26F) BF (37M) wants to go out with his friends, I crack open the wine and pull out a Jane Austen novel and have a lovely night in alone (I'm rarely alone with a live-in BF, and you learn to enjoy alone time when you can get it!).   My point is that adults in adult relationships help build each other up, not tear each other down. You have to learn to support your BF and trust him. You're not close to being there yet- it sounds like the issues are more your own than anything he's done. You are SO young. Spend some serious time on yourself before you commit to spending the rest of your life with someone else."
relationship_advice,3dm976,PleaseDontStalkMe,-4,Fri Jul 17 16:07:59 2015 UTC,"I don't throw tantrums when he wants to go out with friends. I just like to be invited and join in on the fun. So I feel left out and jealous. The only time I actually got really upset was because this one friend of his wanted to go out for wings with him and a few other people. I kept asking my fiance to ask if I can go which he wouldn't. Eventually he did because he was getting so angry at me about it and I was welcome to come in the end, and I went and it was fun.  I get having our alone time, I have mine when he is at work and he has his when I am at work. I love being alone. I've lived with him over a year and so I know this feeling as well.   The problem with people keep telling me to spend time by myself first before committing to him is that I don't want to take a break from him and lose him. I can't just tell him that I need to be single for a while and that I don't want him to have sex or a relationship with anyone else while I do that. I can't lose him. I love him, we have built so much into our relationship and we live together. Not that if things were bad that I wouldn't leave him, it's just they aren't as bad as it seems from my post. I wrote that while angry and upset. Although the issues are still there, and I am going to work on them, I am not going to leave my fiance."

Back off and focus on yourself. It doesn't mean you have to break up.   ""I can't lose him."" This says it all. Look up co-dependency. You need to be your own self sufficient person before you can have a meaningful relationship and it appears you are not."

Stop being so attached don't you have friends and family you can do stuff with instead of trying to control him and force him to integrate you into his group ? Let him have his space just because you in a relationship doesn't mean he has to have you everywhere he goes it's still nice to have hobbies and events that people can do without their other half breathing down their neck all day long if you continue this jealous , controlling and dependant behaviour you will push him away being so dependant is not sexy how about find stuff you like to do alone ? find hobbies and see more of your friends or something ?"

I don't know how to help him understand that I am just jealous and I want to be included. ... I just hate feeling like I can't be ""one of the guys"".

And, no, you are not mature -- much less ready for marriage -- and frankly sound immensely irritating.  To be honest, I'm also questioning the maturity and judgment of your SO as well.

Six months in, completely unexpectedly, he proposed.  Said I was what he was looking for his whole life but had always gone for the stereotypical arm candy type women (which is what I thought he really wanted) and he always ended up hating them.

It sounds like we have something in common. My BF is also 11 years older than me (I'm 26F he's 37M). We've been dating for 3 years now. Pretty early on in the relationship (maybe 6 months in), he voiced some concerns that sound akin to what you're saying now. Basically he asked me why I was with him. He had similar points to the ones you're making: basically that I'm what's considered conventionally attractive, I'm very social, and I'm a lawyer (then law student). I honestly couldn't believe he even had those concerns! I told him, quite honestly, that I was the lucky one. He's smart, funny and the most patient man I've ever known (something I very much value in a partner, as I know I can try anyone's patience at times). I also find him incredibly attractive.   These insecurities he had caught me completely off guard, but we talked through it and both of us came to realize just how highly the other valued our relationship. Neither of us have ever raised the issue again.  What I'm saying is-- he's into you! Unless you're not sharing the fact that he treats you poorly or disrespectfully (doesn't seem like that's the case), then just recognize that you are worth valuing, and for more than just your age! You are bringing some thing(s) to the table that he values and wants in a partner- in the same way that he is for you.   Don't mess the relationship up just because you're self-conscious about some aspect of yourself. You seem to have found a great guy :)"

relationship_advice,3dlu61,JiuJitsuJustin,4,Fri Jul 17 09:00:57 2015 UTC,"There really seem to be two types of people, whose who react strongly and see any kind of herpes as a deal breaker and those who just shrug and say, well it's very common. You won't know until you let her know.  Now I'm far from a player, but I told my previous and current partner that I get cold sores and they didn't have any issues with it. Turns out my now wife, like most people with HSV-1, is asymptomatic HSV-1. Either she didn't know that when we got together or I gave it to her, either way she doesn't care, she's just happy that she's got no symptoms.  Unfortunately both  /u/Solemn_Communist and /u/Mimsy-Porpington underestimate how common genital HSV-1 is. There have been recent studies that indicate that genital HSV-1 is on the rise and is estimated to account for up to half of genital infections in younger people and around 30% in older people (edit: apparently new infections, not existing ones). One of the reason that is being theorised is that it's become less common for children to get oral HSV-1, therefore a larger population of sexually active youngsters don't have the protection of established antibodies that a latent infection gives. A visible blister is not necessary for transmission but it does increase the risk greatly so if she doesn't have HSV-1 you should of course avoid contact with your lips if you have a blister. The good thing though is that HSV-1 on the genitals is milder than on the lips, it's also milder than HSV-2 would be on the genitalia and is not likely to cause recurrence.  To put it all into perspective, for a 20 year old the probability of that person having HSV-1 is around 40% but can be as high as 65% in some ethnic minority groups. The same probability of that person having HSV-2 is about 5% (10% in some ethic minority groups).  Though I haven't seen any studies discussing oral to genital HSV-1 transmission risk, you could at least get some idea from the difference in prevalence between oral and genital HSV-1. Also remember that someone who already has oral HSV-1 has reduced risk or acquiring genital HSV-1. Again I don't know how much but I keep reading the word ""unlikely"" when someone asks how likely it is to get genital HSV-1 when you already have oral HSV-1"

You're making it sound like you need to reveal to her that you have an STD. It's not that serous. It's cold sores. As long as you don't make out or go down on her when you're having an outbreak, you'll be fine. Don't stress over it."

Whenever you feel one coming in - which, if you've had them for this long like I have you know almost instantly - just tell her you get em occasionally.

You're making it sound like you need to reveal to her that you have an STD.   HSV1 is sexually transmitted.  HSV1 is very prevalent.  About 54% of the US population age 14 to 49 has it, and about 65% has it by age 30.  However some people do have concerns about it."

It doesn't matter if he's sad that SpongeBob doesn't live in his sea, or if it's going to rain this weekend. It was an excuse. The following regarding the moving out one, is rather bullshit. Anyone can still date while they live at home. So far there are 3 excuses.   You're right it does stack up, but generally there are problems with just moving away and all parties have to be committed. As of now, there's nothing, and there's nothing but excuses from his end. They don't add up. The brutal truth to dating is - if they want to, they will. Those excuses rather suck, they are from all different directions. Logistic, timeliness, work?  Does he call/text you to go out or hang out? Does he invite you places? Does he initiate conversations first?  The big questions to ask him are, why can't he date anyone because he's living at home? What difference does that make? Do you live at home as well? Do his parents not let him date? Is his job moving him?  People have to meet you halfway. And generally it's when you kiss, and tell them your feelings. You need to let them reciprocate as well. Datings is all about reading between the lines. Sure there may be a chance, but the ball is in his court. You told him how you felt. Any guy that's worth it, wouldn't give you excuses. They'd be super happy to hear that from you and put some effort into it. I wouldn't reply to his texts right away. Don't always be available to him. Self respect."

Thanks, I have thought about that; that even if things did work out at this point, it would be a rocky relationship having started with excuses and bullshit.  He often does initiate conversation and invite me places first most of the time. I don't bother texting him because he works a ton and he'll reach out when his shift is done. But I think I'll ask him about why he's unable to date because he's living at home. I just assumed it was because he's always out of his house and wants to invite me over but can't, but I'm actually not certain.  Thank you very much, your advice has really helped me a ton.

She didnt lead you on. I can appreciate that. If she does want more now, I would let her make that move. You already put yourself out there. If she led you on, and you did it again, and she said no again, I would be PISSED. Maybe take things slow and see how things progress a little longer. If a month from now, you are not getting anywhere, just try to be friends only, BUT seek someone else. Also, if you havent, maybe grab a beer with her some time, just the two of you, and let it turn into a few beers. Make it a point to not drink too much on your part, so that you can observe her. Pay attention to her. With a couple drinks in her, maybe she opens up a bit. DO NOT try to get her drunk and take advantage of her. Just see if a little alcohol loosens her up enough to tell you where she is at. My advice."

Maybe I should ask to come around on the weekends to hers (a place where she feels most comfortable) and give her the chance to?   The hardest thing for me in the situation is that she is giving alot of the telltale signs that she is into me. Like laughing at my jokes that aren't even funny, slight nervousness/tension, complimenting my mannerisms and quotes, eye contact etc... But she also gives alot of the telltale signs of being 'just friends', like there's a lack of any type of breaking the touch barrier, Inviting me with her group of friends (which she acts very different when with her friends, but that might just be the change of the scenario)."

I don't know if I have much advice for you, but your fiancee sounds awful. She sounds completely obsessed with drama, and just plain nasty. If anyone, let alone my fiancee went on rants saying ""fuck your family, they're a waste of life"" they'd be out of my life so fast they're head would spin. Is that the kind of person you want to spend the rest of your life with? Because it's likely not going to get any better, it sounds like that's just the kind of person she is.

Reading this I'm absolutely floored at how your fiancee treats you and your family, but to you it's fine because it's only 5% of the time. To me, that's still unacceptable. I suppose you need to decide if this behaviour is a dealbreaker to you or not, how much is too much for you? Have you thought about couples or pre-marriage counseling at all? It may help voice some of your concerns and see what her reaction is.

Take your calendar for the next year and randomly pick days, maybe 1 per month, and schedule gifts or surprises for these days. Also schedule yourself a daily reminder for a random time to text her. After a while you won't need the reminders, you'll just automatically think of texting her when she crosses your mind. (I can say that because my boyfriend is big on affectionate texts and it isn't something that I thought of before I realized how much it meant to him, and now I remember most days.)  People respond to different types of details in a relationship. Some need physical touch, others need verbal reassurances, others like surprise gifts. People are different, you presumably prefer a different way or ways of showing affection or you wouldn't struggle with this. Fortunately it is not too much effort to teach yourself to express your affection in a way your girlfriend appreciates."

If you meet up with her at work or she meets up with you at work, pull her in and kiss her like she is about to leave on a plane, kiss her hard and passionately and don't pull away. Give her a rose, or even better, leave it somewhere that she will find it on her own with a card. Call her sexy and beautiful in public. Do these things at random times. Like if you are just going for a walk, hanging out at the mall, etc., stop her, stop walking and pull her in and tell her she is sexy, beautiful, the most amazing thing to ever have happen to you.  Other gift ideas other than a rose or roses, jewelry, get matching rings with your names engraved on them, candy, surprise dates. Make an effort to remember anniversaries."

How is this a decision - you are already with someone else.   I spent a lot of time trying to get over my ex and a lot of the feelings are gone but there are definitely some residual feelings and I think if he actually has gotten over his fear of commitment we could really make it work. But I really like my current BF and it's too early to tell what could happen with us and I kind of want to give it a chance. I really don't want to lose either of them but it's unfair to them that way. Any advice?   Apparently you don't really care all that much for your current boyfriend if it just takes one phone call from the a-hole ex to sway you.    the ex bought a ring and is ready to get married so I am 99 percent sure he is sincere in being ready to commit    Just be sure to update us when he dumps you again.
relationship_advice,3dmea6,Meatros,5,Fri Jul 17 13:56:31 2015 UTC,"exes are exes for a reason. He must've had a string of failed rebounds or something and is having a moment of weakness and panic. Usually when you go back to an ex, the relationship will pick up where it left off and sooner or later those same old issues will resurface again. you'll regret having gone through the pain of getting over them just to be sucked back into the same old probs. Moving backwards isn't progress. The ex will need to find the strength to be alone, having you as a crutch to fall back on will not fix his life."

relationship_advice,3dmea6,belousugar,0,Fri Jul 17 13:33:16 2015 UTC,"I guess I think it's still easy to do things like buying ""presents"" (engagement ring isn't really a present, but is a purchased item) and saying ""I've changed"" and all that, but it takes a lot more work and commitment to actually put those thoughts into action. If you really do think he could do it, not just say it, give him a chance and start seeing him again. But PLEASE do not move in with him or agree to marry him. Take it slow and let him prove things are different before moving forward into anything more serious.  I also think someone who does a complete 180 and wants to blast forward with moving in ""as soon as possible"" and get engaged might be trying to make up for something as opposed to wanting to be in a healthy, stable, patient, long term relationship...  Just my opinion though, I hope it goes well dear :)"

If you aren't on the same page about how much contact you have between each other during the semester it is going to be different when you come back and feel like you have different lives. It could also be stressful if you don't leave on the same page and you don't really know what she is doing when she is busy and not texting you back etc. If she is the right girl for you, you guys will keep in touch and could definitely make things work. That being said if she is hesitant right now about visiting each other it doesn't sound like she intends to keep you as close as you'd like to be so I would be prepared for the worst and just go into your freshman year with an open mind.

relationship_advice,3dj87u,riledredditer,17,Thu Jul 16 18:54:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's as simple a decision as everyone else here seems to be promoting. I think you should think long and hard about whether this is the right choice for you - and whether or not you are willing to face the potential consequences of having a kid with someone you haven't built up a long term relationship with.   There is the possibility that you two are truly incredibly compatible and you will live happily ever after, and you have to consider this option and even hope for this option as it is the best case scenario. Still, if you walk down this road you need to be 100% prepared to care for the baby on your own and you have to contemplate whether you are in a position to be able to provide and guide a new person into this life on your own, if things turn sour.   I know that in the honeymoon stage of a relationship these types of considerations are not something you want to have in your head-space, but I think it would be incredibly irresponsible for you to make a decision without looking at all angles. The last thing you want is to end up resenting your child due to your built-up hopes and dreams of living happily ever after crumble to dust after reality starts to kick in (if it does! it's not certain either way!).   That's all I really want to say, I could go on but I just think that a lot of the advice in this thread so far has made light of the committment you would be making and the potential hardships you might face if you follow-through.   If you choose to have the baby, I think that is a great and phenomenal thing, and I wish you the best of luck in your future life, but I do encourage you to think about this until you are 100% committed and are prepared for anything to happen, even if it doesn't fit into an ideal world that you paint (which is natural to do! everyone should have a chance at that kind of happiness! but life is messy so I think it's important to be prepared for all possibilities.).  Best of luck!"

I know, however, that I barely know this person and he barely knows me, which is why I posted this. I don't know what to expect in the future but I, myself, and 100% positive I can provide for this baby with or without him.   We have had some long conversations since we found out and the takeaway from those has always been that we both admire and respect each other and will do whatever is best for the baby (abortion is not an option, adoption could be, however).  He is a solid guy with a good background and this is totally unexpected but also, in a weird way, welcome. I appreciate your reply a lot, you have given me things to think about. Thank you!"
relationship_advice,3dj87u,manicpoohbear,2,Thu Jul 16 20:27:27 2015 UTC,"I just want to put this out there: I'm not commentating from the perspective of someone who has been in your situation, but rather I am the product of people in your situation.   My parents tried dating for a bit after having me and then ended up not getting married - they decided to raise me as best they could and be partners in that endeavor, but still pursue their own lives separately (they were also younger than you, 24/25).  I respect the hell out of my parents choice to have me and their ability to navigate such murky waters while still doing the best they could for me. I think I respect it even more because I realize now (at age 25), exactly how unwilling I would be to make the same sacrifices. But ultimately there is no one out there who dictates how a ""successful"" life is led - the only thing you have control over is how you react to and accommodate what life throws at you. As long as you maintain your dignity and pride, which you can do by continuing to look forward and tackling whatever comes at you as best you can, you can define your own route through this messy world we live in.   Be prepared for all eventualities you can think of, and then prepare yourself for all the ones you can't by accepting that the world is not beholden to your wants and desires. Still, I think you have to strive for your dreams, knowing and believing that you have the ability to keep moving towards them despite any trials that come down the road.   Lastly, no matter what happens between yourself and your babies father, if you choose to take responsibility as a mother, please communicate with your child as if he were an adult. Perhaps your kid won't know fully what you are talking about in the moment, but I can speak from experience that it is really hard to hide things from kids.   My parents took their own path, and I think they did an amazing job given the odds stacked against them at the start, but they tried to shield me from a lot of the more difficult consequences of being raised in the fashion I was - and were limited in their success in that regards. I have a step-mom, an ex-step-dad, and two amazing half-sisters with 10-16 years between us. I was a source of tension for both my parents spouses, and I've developed a bit of a more passive personality because I was raised being passed between my mom and my dad (and I never would give input bc I never wanted to imply having any favoritism).  Long story short: walk into this with eyes wide open and try to accept all the consequences resulting from your ultimate choice. You will never be alone though - we are all just making up the rules as we go along."

I won't get too into my childhood, but it was littered with an alcoholic and womanizing biological dad, a messy divorce, a step-dad that I once hated and now love more than anyone, a half sister, two step brothers, and a terrible family secret that I just now found out about a few years ago.   I know that based on my past experiences, I want to do essentially the opposite of my parents, and I know this guy to be a genuine, hard working, caring person. We may or may not get married but I know he will be there every step of way.   Actually, I know nothing. The best laid plans of mice and men, you know?

I think that's the most important thing for you to be comfortable with.

I have a preference.  I like tall strong dark haired, dark eyed men.  My boyfriend is slim, shorter with blonde hair and blue eyes.  He asked me my type once and I said ""I don't have a type"" because what is the point of telling him this?  I fell in love with him because of who he is, not his hair color.  Wear a red wig if you want to please him and make it exciting. But ultimately, you should just be you because that's who he fell in love with."

We get old, we get wrinkles, we lose our hair or it goes grey.    You are thinking only of things that are superficial.  These things do not matter at the end of the day.

relationship_advice,3djm2y,themoderation,17,Thu Jul 16 22:21:30 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're extremely insecure and irrational, and as a result extremely insecurely and irrationally controlling. However, your boyfriend isn't perfect either, and frankly his behavior during the convention sounds assholeish based on your account.   Regardless, the problem isn't with gingers. The problem isn't with your boyfriend preferring gingers. The problem is with your interpretation of what your boyfriend preferring gingers means. You haven't stated it outright, but it looks like you believe that it means he will break up with you if he finds a ginger to date. Therefore, the real problem is that your relationship lacks trust. He needs to act in a way that allows you to trust him (not being an asshole), and you need to act in a way that allows you to trust him (not being extremely insecure and irrational and controlling).  So work on trust. And you get there by communication. And if he can't communicate in a way that inspires trust in you at times that you truly believe you're being rational and openminded, then you need to find someone else who does.  ps: you will never be in a happy relationship if you're trying to convince your boyfriend not to have a preference and even not to fap"
relationship_advice,3djm2y,PM_Me_Annie_Drawings,8,Thu Jul 16 21:49:57 2015 UTC,"You need to grow up a little bit about this. Your boyfriend can't help his preference for women. He shouldn't be flirting with other women if it makes you uncomfortable,  but I think it's unreasonable to ask him to stop masturbating because you don't look like the women he's masturbating to. He's with you for a reason,  despite his preference for red hair, so he obviously cares more about you than fucking someone with red hair. If that's not good enough for you,  that's because of your insecurities. This is a problem you need to fix on your own, because your self esteem should never rely on someone else. It needs to be built on you."

relationship_advice,3djm2y,HighUnicorn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:48:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a dismissible ""preference"" when he has acted inappropriately on it. I don't think this is solely your problem. He can't help he finds redheads attractive, but if you're his girlfriend and thus more important than his redhead fetish, he should fucking act like it. Your insecurities aren't baseless, you have every reason to question your place in him specially when he seems way more enthusiastic about people he doesn't share an emotional connection with than you solely because of their appearance. Physical appearance in a lot of cases has been reason enough to cheat, and it's a concurring one; while it's a shallow reason to do it, it is nevertheless a reason and it acquires significance to the partner that way specially if they're prone to anxiety. Dismissing your worries as ""petty insecurities"" is not doing justice to how complex his little ""preference"" is and everything it could imply. Even though you shouldn't hold anyone responsible for your happiness and self appreciation, you definitely shouldn't be involved romantically with someone who feeds your insecurities instead of making them better. Hell, you shouldn't sexually be with someone who makes you feel any less of a sex goddess. There are definitely some things you have to work hard on that are entirely your responsibility, but if there's anything an SO should be is supportive of that process, not perjudicial. My SO wasn't my ideal type back when we started dating, and now I can't even masturbate to other people without imagining him a little. I just don't see why would you be with a person you're not insanely attracted to on a long-term relationship? I'm not saying he shouldn't fap to redheads, or that he should stop being attracted to redheads, but he shouldn't make you feel any less attractive for it. When I'm with someone, I'm with them because for me they're the #1 everything and I sure as hell make sure they never doubt it."

I've known her for 3 years as of now and eventually, we started texting a ton. I, again, had feelings for her and a few weeks ago at 3:00 in the morning, we were still up texting. Anyway, she confessed she had feelings for me and I told her I had feelings for her as well. However, about a week later we decided to not have a relationship to not risk ruining our friendship, and our friendship isn't broken. What I'm trying to say is, you should tell her. I mean, bad things could happen, but if she doesn't have feelings for you, I doubt she will just stop being friends with you, as long as you have been friends with her for 9 years like you. At least she knows how you feel. If you need more advice, you can message me if you want, I'll be happy to help, especially since this situation is one similar to mine."

Your mind is throwing you thoughts of conspiracy and betrayals - that is fine - it is natural given your experiences; but you get to decide if a thought is rational or not. You are seperate from your mind. Just because you think it does not make it so. You get to decide if your thoughts are valid or not, if you should give them any attention or if any action is required.   Try to restrain from instant reaction mode by simply telling your mind; ""thanks for the warning mind, I do not think I have to give it any consideration at this time. I'll get back to you later"".   Repeat as many times as necessary or till you find any real reasons of distrust or shady behaviour.

Is your goal to ask her to quit drinking altogether? Do you drink?"

I don't know if her family has an alcoholism problem but her family does drink very heavily. Sad to say, she has been known to drive during those times.  My goal is to get her to be not so angry. I wouldn't care if she drank the same amount and was happy/cheerful or even just dazed. I don't drink as often as her and no where near her limit (half a beer or cider is my limit)."

What is the result when you bring this up with her when she is sober? You say she apologizes, does she express the desire to cut back, so she is less angry? My family drinks too, but not heavily. Social drinking is perfectly fine in and of itself but some people cannot handle their emotions very well when tipsy or drunk. I get feisty when wine drunk, maybe it affects her in a similar way?

Be very stern and nonchallaunt. He who cares the least in the relationship controls the relationship.  Be prepared to really part ways.  If she cares she'll beg you to stay and will vow to stop drinking.  If not well then you know she didn't care much anyway.

relationship_advice,3dkemw,premedonna,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:39:03 2015 UTC,"You're not overreacting. As a girl with a lot of guy friends myself, I can -partially- understand what she means about being friends with girls. The problem is that the ""friends"" she is meeting are probably indeed flirting with her. None of my male best friends have ever approached me to ask for my number. We met in different (less flirtatious ways), for example at school, or a friend of a friend... When a stranger asks for my number and later asks me to come to his house, I know he definitely wants more than to be ""just friends"".  I think she's being either naive or not taking your relationship serious. If she enjoys other guys watching her because that makes her feel pretty, I think she doesn't value you (and your opinion) enough. Also, she needs to get her confidence elsewhere than from guys looking at her. She should learn to feel pretty and good without guys staring at her.  During the past year I have made more girl friends and have started the value those friendships more and more. She just has to find the right girl friends with whom she has a lot in common. I'm not really a 'girly' girl (either?), but there's things you can talk about with girls you can't talk about with guys (makeup stuff, intimate stuff).  To the point: I understand that you don't want to break up with her over this, but she really needs to take this as serious as you do. If my partner would mention other people checking him/her out as a good thing, I would be really pissed (and yes, jealous!). (Have you tried to tell her to put herself in your shoes?) It should have to be enough for her that YOU think she's pretty. Your opinion should be the only one that 'really' matters in that aspect.  I would tell her to reach out more to her female friends. Maybe try to introduce her to some of your female friends? I met one of my best female friends through my ex..."

I know what men want and I don't like you hanging around with them. So let's break up and you're free, well, my mind is free of you and what you do.  And be prepared to end it.    I tell my sons find a woman who's in her 30's 40's alimony and child support coming in from the ex(s), just wants to have fun and won't pressure you into children and marriage like the young ones do until it's game over for you, the threat of jail time if you can't pay your child support.

Oh we're just friends? Maybe the girl thinks so because she may  not be interested in them sexually.  But men have been known to have sex with farm animals.  They rape each other in jail. Puberty is our doom.  Women also ignore the fact that in second marriages it's likely their second husbands or boyfriends fantasize about the woman's teenage daughters.  Broken homes are the leading cause of child molestation which is why I call the family courts a cancer on American society.

I think the difficulty comes from saying not to be fulfilled by another person, but the topic is sex. How can OP feel fulfilled and connected to her partner through sex and simultaneously fulfill her own needs without his participation? This sounds like trying to tango alone, pointless. In sex, sure we can 'just do it' and 'get off' and orgasm and be done, I believe you even recommended topics to OP about personal sexuality/spirituality, but she wants connection with her lover, not in spite of him.  She has a need that only her partner can help her with, but he isn't. She is experiencing a decrease in quality of life due to feeling neglected by her lover. Yes, she would benefit from becoming more self-fulfilled and that would change her situation, but then wouldn't she just be realizing she doesn't need a guy in her life who isn't eager to connect with her sexually? She doesn't want to end her marriage, she wants her man to act differently than he is now.  So that may be why you're being down voted... Idk. Have a nice day (:"

We generally only ever hear the one side, not really much we're going to do about it so I just move on. Or are you like Smoke in Bleak Seasons and your soul is going to fuck my mind with a witnessing of some history here?"

relationship_advice,3dkx7x,StopStalkingMeB,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:18:04 2015 UTC,"What do I do?   Have you talked to her about Charlie? I mean, IMO it sounds like you took the initiative to welcome that cat into your life, and by extension hers. She's confident in pulling this off because maybe the cat is in neither of your names, so how can you report it as stolen? If this is truly an amicable breakup, I would put your foot down about Charlie. Then again, these cats have also bonded to each other too.   Your ex says that she will go nuts without the cats.... but having your past with addiction, maybe it would be good for you to have something to help keep you anchored after the inevitable pain of missing someone and moving on. You both are going to go nuts regardless of the cats or not. But I think you have a better argument for your case, as long as you were really the one who took Charlie in.  I have two cats. We. I have two cats with my girlfriend. I have agreed with her that she should get the first if we should ever separate. He is under my name, but I wouldn't have been searching for a cat and she is the one who found him. We loved him immediately and his is the most gorgeous fucking tiger that you will ever meet, encapsulated in a giant domesticated cat. His orange coat is why the sun exists. I am going to be the saddest sonuvabitch the day that cat dies, man. I hope you and Charlie can stay with each other... though separating the cats gives me pause. Your talking about his belly rubs reminded me of my little one, our second cat, the cutest tornado you will ever meet. Melts my heart man."

relationship_advice,3dis96,your_what_hurts,6,Thu Jul 16 19:33:25 2015 UTC,I don't think you can.  My husband and I are very conservative-we wouldn't hang out with members of the opposite sex alone.  It just feels wrong to us.  Some people think that is OK and are fine with it in a relationship.  The issue is that you both have to be OK with it.  He isn't going to change.  No offense but I think he needs a more conservative girl to be secure.

relationship_advice,3dis96,Justin_T_Credible,2,Fri Jul 17 15:40:06 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I am the guy in this situation, my partner told me she made this post so I had a read through and do not agree with a lot of it, or think so much is out of context that it really makes me look like a monster. I want to put some things straight or in context and then ask your genuine opinion. Needless to say we are going through a rough patch so would appreciate no name-calling as we are both here for genuine advice. We are talking about proper counselling too. Firstly – I have never ever said no, or told my partner she cannot do something, ever. Yes I have made it VERY clear about things that I am not happy about , or go into a mood when it happens but have never explicitly said “you cannot do that” etc etc  So to talk about the points my partner raised, the thing about visiting male friends. Everything she said above is correct. Although they are usually single male friends and it involves staying at their place, just the 2 of them. I don’t think this scenario ever would present itself with male friends that are not single but that is beside the point. Anyway, I am genuinely uncomfortable with this. I know they are friends and have been for a long time but what can I do? It really makes me uncomfortable. I think it is not an appropriate thing to do in a commited relationship and I think it is wrong of the male friend to expect it when she is in a relationship. I know this has a polarised opinion based on the other thread from yesterday.  The nude modelling – I have not asked her to not do it. I did say I think it would be really weird and awkward if it happened with people I know but we were getting on ok with that issue. I did not know she did that before we met. This is more of a hobby that she enjoys than anything else so to say I am making her unemployed is not a fair assessment. She has a professional modelling career as well as a proper more stable job. In fact I have helped her so much with her career, willing to take a bank loan to finance a project she is thinking of. The photo on the friends page. I thought that was really weird. A guy I know on facebook, has a naked picture of my girlfriend oh his facebook page. I felt it was inappropriate and really strange. I did tell her how I felt and asked if she would request it be taken down. After a discussion I accepted I was wrong about it as he had every right to have the picture there as he himself was in it, I still felt it was really weird. The concert tickets? The band is question is a huge rock band. I am very very anti-drugs and was reluctant to go hang out with a band if that was happening. I also know what guys are like in these type of bands so did not feel comfortable about my girlfriend going alone to hang backstage with a band. I am in a band myself and have seen how they gather attractive girls to go backstage. Anyway, they are my reasons for being so unhappy about it – turns out I was completely wrong about the band, they were really nice. The facebook status , I did not cry, she maintains that I did but I don’t remember. Why would I cry? That’s really embarrassing, anyway – she is a model and very attractive and constantly gets male guys adding, messaging her etc.. Her status said “single” she is not single. The male guys propositioning her did bother me, what can I say – I do not like it. I felt if she put “in a relationship” it would stop the guys thinking she is single and harassing her. Because she is in a relationship. The music video shoot. She met the 4 guys THAT DAY and was willing to go and stay at their house or one of their houses (as it took it from the text messages received). Alarm bells rang, that is not safe in any way so yes we had a big argument over it via text messages as I was not in the country at the time and she did not talk to me for a few days. I think its wrong and dangerous to stay at someones house if you don’t know them, obviously she says she can make her own decisions here. Fair enough. Turns out she stayed at one of the bands house, with him and his wife. I did not know that at the time. The argument this week about the photo shoot. My friend constantly gets attention from girls. My argument was – you asked about him before considering me? I accept here I was a little out of order and jealous. In the back of my mind I also thought what is this becomes a future thing, that there is potential he will also be in those nude photo shoots? and I didn't ""storm out"", I had 6 minutes to catch my bus for work. Yes – I was insecure and stupid here. This was a small argument I thought, nothing big. So – that’s my side to the above. I hope you don’t think I am the monster that the original post made me be, and if I still do, well then I guess I’m screwed. Apart from these issues things really have been good."

Your bf's concern about you sleeping at another man's house (unless it's family) is completely justified. Let's be real, these seemingly harmless male friends/acquaintances are in it for only one thing...That said it's kinda weird you've been with someone for 2 years yet still list yourself as 'single' on Facebook?  IMO you crave male attention and are unwilling to abstain from any of your 'attention centers' even at the expense of your relationship. Some of the crap he bitches about is kinda petty but overall I think he is justified."

We met years earlier through a theatre exchange he has visited my home previously and stayed for a week in my home and Ive been back and forth to Italy since for work and we have always made an effort to meet, he has and had a girlfriend at the time as I was with my boyfriend, I was living in a one room apartment and we slept in different beds as I was hardly going to send him back to florence late at night, I was working in a tiny town with no hotels nearby and would have felt odd considering we've stayed over in each others homes many times to tell him he wasn't welcome to stay. The other time I was visiting a friend from college (I studied film in College and was the only girl on my course-all the others were guys), he works in France for most of the year and was home after 6 months and invited me and some others from the course for a bbq as he is home for the summer, I hadn't seen him for well over 6 months and accepted the invitation, when a couple of others couldn't make it, we agreed to meet anyway, he has a big house shared with his parents who were also there, my brother had recently been staying at my house so there wasn't a place to offer him to stay (again a 4 hour hour drive to his home from mine) I did propose to my bf that he come over to his and they meet, but this was shot down straight away and I was made feel guilty and like it was obscene behavior to drive and catch up with a friend for one night after he'd been working in France for several months."

Guys like this get worse the longer you are together, because they have more to lose with each passing day.

relationship_advice,3dis96,cathline,3,Thu Jul 16 18:43:47 2015 UTC,"But he would say all of these requests are reasonable, staying in another guys house is not something you do in a relationship, a guy having a photo of you on his facebook page is not normal, that he is trying to support me in my goals, that the modeling doesn't pay that much and therefore is not that important. I mean its not like Id be unemployed if I stopped doing it, I do have another job. I just want some perspective here because we both disagree fundamentally on most of the things I have mentioned."

relationship_advice,3dis96,Phorella,-2,Thu Jul 16 19:24:56 2015 UTC,"His requests are not reasonable. He wants you to leave your job, one that is highly desired by a great number of people. It may not be a huge money maker but there is a lot more to life than money.   You aren't allowed to be tagged in a Facebook photo by any guy you have ever known past, present or future? You cannot control that nor should you try to. The request is childish and over possessive.   Crashing at a friend's is fine too.  My mom has been in a relationship like this for 25 years. She has no friends left, her family talks behind her back about how bad it  is. And she's too stuck to leave. I've been with my BF for 15 years and he has never even seen my Facebook page, as he doesn't have one. He came to visit me when I was away at college and met the only friends  I had made who were all male, and came and hung out at my job where I waitressed which was a strip club. I waitressed in hot pants and the plungiest neckline you've ever seen, in a skuzzy ass club. He never said boo to me about any of it. One of my very best friends was in love with me when we were teens (love poems, songs, all that shit) and my BF doesn't blink an eye if I want to go out just him and me for tacos and margaritas. And when his ex-gf needed someone to come get her because she was stranded I didn't come along for the ride to watch him, because if he wanted her he could have her but he's with me. I understand he and I are on the far other side of the spectrum, your BF is not acting normal. He wants to take away all that you are and replace it with what he wants you to be. You should never give yourself up like that, never."

relationship_advice,3dkdp4,Cheesymash,2,Thu Jul 16 23:48:27 2015 UTC,"He shouldn't feel guilty if you choose him. Maybe you want to give it a chance and are willing to monogamous, he's not stealing anything when you choose what you want to try in life. You are poly but maybe you can do this. It's not like you are getting married, and maybe you just can't not be poly, eh. You feel bad because you have this emotional bond to your first partner and it sounds like you are keeping him in the dark. Don't let this hit him like a hammer in the dark. Maybe your best friend can still be your best friend while you try monogamy with this dude.  You are 20 and may change greatly in the next 8 years, I say follow your heart if you really want to give in to that pull. But be honest with your old mate too. Maybe you call it poly but you have a unique or lacking definition. You will feel sad that he will hurt but you will feel worse if your relationship is saturated in regret and lies. The whole 'shitty person' thing is you self-deprecating to give yourself a reason for rushing into sex under emotional intensity. You need to own your lack of control so this kind of 'shit' doesn't blindside you. You were confused by all the butterflies, are missing something in your current relationship, and you got excited of the possibilities. If you do not understand where you slipped you are prone to do it again. Open up and give yourself some time."

Thank you for the reply by the way, I was just talking to my SO about the whole situation again, because as much as I say he knows fully whats happening, I just want to double check so he's not in the dark about anything."
relationship_advice,3dkdp4,PurplePlurple,2,Fri Jul 17 17:49:06 2015 UTC,"How would you be despicable?  When it's from butthurt or missing you, I mean break ups are never really enjoyable even when amicable, you know? I have been in a mutually abusive relationship,  and I am betting I despise my ex way more than S ever reasonably could despise you. I mean, it is your life and sometimes you make a tough decision and sometimes it hurts others - not because you want to, but because it just hurts in general when you have to say goodbye to something. Your interest just isn't comfortable outside of monogamy, he has told you what will work for him and you are so into the moment that it's worth taking the chance perhaps! My partner asked me early on if I would want an open relationship, not that she had anyone in mind but because she had never been in a serious relationship. I liked the idea but it didn't jive with how I work, I fall in love easily and just can't be that casual about relationships with other people. A couple months later, an open relationship was the last thing she wanted.   You are not despicable if you are honest about your feelings and let your partner/s know what is up, IMHO that is showing respect and I wish my ex would have given me that. If anyone tells you that you are despicable, they are merely projecting their own pain and trying to make you feel it so that they can continue to avoid having to get over it. It's a tough decision but maybe you want this. You are young and you are not married, but now you have a reason to try out monogamy because of how into this dude you are. You met him while poly, it's not like you cheated on agreed boundaries! Or maybe you did? It sounds like you are being transparent with your best mate, though."
relationship_advice,3dkdp4,PurplePlurple,2,Fri Jul 17 21:14:20 2015 UTC,"I am being completely transparent. Absolute honesty (bordering to being rudely blunt sometimes) is absolutely necessary for our relationship, and thats why we were able to be poly for 2 years.   Thank you so much for replying to me, and for reassuring me that I'm not a despicable person, aha. I think I just have this negative connotation that if I were to pursue something (or someone) that I want, and it were to hurt someone else, that's in the same level as disregarding their feelings, and being a selfish individual.   Never cheated on S, I actually had to text and double check with him before I even stepped inside N's place."

Ultimately if he legitimately no longer wants kids and/or marriage (and you do) then it's over.  If he's just saying those things out of fear or a backlash from his mother's infidelity then he needs to be in counseling to sort out why he is treating your relationship so poorly.  You're right, you don't want to fight to get him to commit to you.  And you can't keep the relationship going by yourself if he no longer wants to be a good partner in it.    You need to sit him down and have a very serious talk.  Find out if he means it that he is no longer willing to get married and start a family.  Let him know that those are still your goals and while you want that life for both of you, if he no longer shares those goals then you can't be in a relationship with him anymore.   If he does want that future with you, then he needs to take steps towards repairing your relationship - starting with acknowledging that it exists.  Try not to be accusatory or blame him, because you won't get anywhere if he feels trapped and defensive.  You want him to open up and listen to you, not retreat and shut down.  If he's changed his mind, or if he won't discuss this with you, then end it.  You don't deserve to be put through the wringer just because he's feeling insecure."

He's an avoider in general. He can just pretend issues don't exist.  I'm not huge on marriage so I've just given reasons to get married (celebration, practical, respectful to family etc.). It's more what his reluctance symbolises. When he randomly said he didn't want kids, I'll be honest, I blew up. He knows having children is a huge priority for me (my purpose in life) and I sort of just went ""then break up with me because I'm having kids with or without you"". He retreated and said he didn't mean it. He was just thinking out loud. But I don't want to be with someone whose doing this just because he's been given an ultimatum.  I'm going to seek couples counselling. I think the frustration and resentment I hold will make it almost impossible to discuss this without accusing him. Especially because he's reluctant to discuss any problems."

He just doesn't seem interested. Yet he says he loves me. I don't think we could be friends if we broke up.... I love him too much. We have a core group too.  I'm really stuck if I should continue this too, so don't ask me for advice. But you're not alone."
relationship_advice,3dis41,MelloD,3,Thu Jul 16 17:42:31 2015 UTC,"You already know where to go from here, judging the case that you just set out.  Instead, you're here because you don't want to feel guilty about where you're going to go.  Breaking up with someone is never easy.  It's always nerve wracking, it's always makes you feel guilty, it is hardly ever a ""yes, I am 100% certain I am making the right choice"" scenario.    So, if I can lessen your guilt and give you some perspective, here we go:   She is an adult and she is responsible for her own happiness.  Instead she looks to you to create it for her.  That isn't fair.  It isn't loving, it's dependency.  You are 21 years old.  If your relationship isn't making you happy a majority of the time (everyone has issues here and there), then you are well within your right to leave the relationship. Romantic commitments prior to marriage are a serious of compatibility checks.  You meet someone you like, so you go on a date to see if you're compatible.  If you're compatible, you date some more.  If you're still compatible, you get into a relationship.  If that works, you get into a serious relationship and you say ""I love you"".  If that works, you move in together.   Etc.  So here you are, in a relationship/serious relationship, and you're discovering incompatibilities that are causing you not to enjoy the relationship.  What do you do?  If you cannot solve them (and I don't think you can, because it sounds like she needs to work on herself, which is on her.  And she won't do if she can use you as a crutch) then you leave and eventually start the series of compatibility checks with someone new.   I'm older than you and exactly zero people I know are still with the person they were dating when they were 21.  Your twenties are your time to getting to know yourself.  There is no reason to keep a relationship going if you feel like it's causing you to stall in your own growth.  To me, it seems like you've outgrown this one.   I want her to be a friend but the prior almost break up was her saying she doesn't think she could just be my friend.    You've been together for only 6 months and you've already almost broken up once before?  Dude.  The first six months to a year are supposed to be the honeymoon period of the relationship.  If you're having problems then, then you aren't compatible.    This is another fact about breaking up - when you decide to break up, chances are that you forfeit the friendship you had.  This is especially hard when you were friends before you got together, which is why dating a friend is something that shouldn't be entered into lightly.    Some exes manage to remain friends, but as the person ending the relationship, know that even if you want friendship, she may not be able to handle it.  It's your right to end the relationship, and it's her right not to want to downgrade to friendship.  This may be temporary (until she's over it) or it may be permanent."

It can only help"
relationship_advice,3dlc9k,lizzy_pop,2,Fri Jul 17 06:49:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm a girl who has done this way too many times. Both of my last two serious relationships started because I made the first move, but that's because I made it at the right time. Timing is everything, go for it if you have nothing to lose but remember sometimes the rejection will sting hard. You have to know if you can handle it. After a couple of guys rejecting me it affected my confidence a lot. Now I've reeled it back in, and in the pit of your stomach you usually know what's going to happen, you can usually tell how they will react but you're in denial. Kissed my friend of 7 years last night. Do I regret it? No. Did he reject me? Not exactly. I think he was just in shock. Was it good timing? No. Certainly not."
relationship_advice,3dlc9k,teacup55,2,Fri Jul 17 16:41:36 2015 UTC,Every relationship I've been in started when the woman was direct about her feelings.   If a potential partner doesn't feel comfortable enough to express their feelings we are either not close enough for it to be appropriate or they are not communicative and direct enough for me.  If you do ask you're signaling you want an honest and direct relationship and that is completely the best kind.  Ask if you feel it.

They spend ridiculous amounts of energy on socializing and degenerating themselves via drinking, smoking, or whatever other excuse they use. They sit on their computers all day in an attempt to escape from reality. They are so caught up in their ""infallible"" bubble of reality that they are incapable of being progressive. If you try and even talk about anything outside of this ""bubble"" they turn to mush. It is extremely repulsive and I do not connect with these people. And you just redefined sapiosexuality. An attraction to intelligence regardless of gender. So thank you for reinforcing my point.  edit:  Obviously I would not verbally tell someone I think they are ""normal"".

I have literally no say in how anybody should live their life. I am only talking about my personal experience and the opinions I have crafted from those experiences. I even went so far as to do research behind my opinions to see if they have any educational sources that reinforce my findings. It turns out there are a lot more reinforcing topics then I have been able to read in multiple months. Topics from associations such a TED, articles from ""prestigious"" and non-prestigious colleges with brilliant professors who have studied topics similar to my thoughts. Instead of trying to put up walls and denounce my beliefs because they do not coincide with the world around me, I have decided to be honest with who I am. To not let society dictate who I am, how I live my life, or how I treat others. If you think think this small aspect of sexuality makes me a horrible person so be it.

People get defensive, flame(only thing they can do), and ignore my questions. What you are stating I have heard reiterated over and over and over. It is obnoxiously redundant. I do not use sapiosexuality as a label, I used it as a word that is closest to defining my needs in terms of relationships. Just as with* every kind of sexuality there are levels.  The thing most people don't understand is that it is very difficult to socialize with something that is extremely stressful. Bringing up nonsensical topics constantly: Drugs, alcohol, money, all the things I have, etc. Things that tie to materialism and a mental image they have created about themselves in order to feel an underlying sense of control in their life by fitting into the society that engulfs them. It is very sad how our species has evolved due to the media and how easily people are to manipulate simply by giving them the notion of control.  I am physically disabled as well. Did you even read what I posted above? I am barely able to get out of bed to get on my computer to research things. It is a miracle if I can muster up the energy to shower and not* have tears appear in my eyes from moving. That is very stressful. The inability to prevent yourself from being stabbed by what feels like a cold knife. I have dealt with this for almost 6 years. I am well aware of my current limitations when it comes to adding more stress.  edit: made a couple typos and put * next to them. I need to work on my quick-typing. Typing too hard."

You clearly don’t want to hear it.  When all of society is socializing in a way that you don't understand it's not societies obligation to conform to you it is your obligation to learn how to manage.  No one is going want to engage with someone who starting point is ‘society is too unintelligent for me to relate to.’  You can't call people stupid and expect them to want to get close to you.  Physical disability does not preclude you from being a douche.  It’s really quite simple, treat others the way you want to be treated.  You don’t want other people to think of you as unintelligent, right?  Why do you think it’s ok to treat others with such disdain?"

I have met ""down to earth"" people but unfortunately they either were still showing signs of things I do not believe in or they showed lack of mental maturity. I am not going to lead them on in the relationship in the vain hope that they will someday magically change. I can understand people thinking what I am doing is wrong, but I am here looking for answers to a minute part of what I look for in a relationship: sexual attractiveness. It is the most difficult part for me personally to understand why I am this way. And I believe in the long run with relationships it is something I need to understand so that when the time comes and I do find my significant other I can explain to them the way I think about sexuality."
relationship_advice,3dmz2m,murderousbudgie,5,Fri Jul 17 17:18:35 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you’re looking for some profoundly deep connection with someone without putting in the effort to get to know them first.  You're judging people superficially and counting them out before getting to the part where you have those deep satisfying conversations.  The thing about cultivating healthy relationships is that it's a good thing to surround yourself with people who see things differently than you do.  It's not really interesting to interact with people who have all of the same viewpoints as you.  Try actually getting to know people who you perceive as different from you, ask questions put yourself in another’s shoes.  By learning how other's see the world and how other's see you, you can evolve past your navel gazing and really live.  There are so many options and opportunities out there that you are stubbornly ignoring.  The world is a wide and wondrous place, surround yourself with as much diversity as possible"
relationship_advice,3dmz2m,murderousbudgie,-8,Fri Jul 17 18:27:21 2015 UTC,"No, I do not look at such shallow needs as sexuality when I first meet someone. I look to see if they are honest, have good morals, and ethics. I look to see what their goals are in life and what they wish out of it. I get to know them because I feel that there is no point in dating someone you do not know or connect with. If there is no connection I tell them and explain that friendship is an option, but intimacy is not. I feel that there are other things such as my education and maintaining my health once my procedure is over that are more important at this moment in time then a relationship. I am not someone who has ""friends with benefits"" because I think that sex can become an escape and I want to stay as aware and surrounded by my world as possible. I want to better understand my world, and through how I view it better understand myself."
relationship_advice,3dmz2m,TURBOKEY,7,Fri Jul 17 18:40:13 2015 UTC,"You're missing my point completely, I didn't say anything about friends with benefits or sex at all.   You need to create the opportunity for a sexual relationship by getting to know people.  The point of dating it to get to know people to see of that connection can exist.  People don't just connect magically, life is not a disney movie"
relationship_advice,3dmz2m,C1awed,-6,Fri Jul 17 18:47:06 2015 UTC,"No I understand your point. I am very patient in relationships. I believe that a sense of connection or the realization that you have the potential to connect with someone is noticed within at most 4-5 dates. This would assume you have been going out for around a month. If I do not feel connected with someone within a month I am not going to want to date them anymore. I have other things that I have put above my wants of an intimate relationship. Education, personal health, my sick sister I watch over. Things that produce additional forms of stress that I have to be aware of before I jump into a relationship. Some people know what they want in a relationship, others know what they need. Most are a combination of both. Intelligence is something I want, but I am trying to figure out in the long run if it is something I need. My belief is that yes I need a person to be above a certain level of intelligence if I am going to have a long term relationship(marriage, for example) with them. I am one of those people who will not date someone if I do not see the chance of a long term relationship. I can not be interested in another person if I am hitched to someone else because of my personal beliefs in how someone should act in a relationship. I can go deeper and deeper into what I have learned about myself but that would be recanting months of personal research and countless hours spent assessing my own reactions. I am not sure I am comfortable to put that much about me in one single place. I enjoy my privacy."
relationship_advice,3dmz2m,ThrowingMyslfOutther,6,Fri Jul 17 18:54:29 2015 UTC,"Dude, you are way overthinking this.    seriously.    You are correct, if you've dated someone for a month and there is no connection you break up and move on.  That is perfectly normal operating procedure for most people.  Yes, you should always be cultivating your own interest... work, education, hobbies, etc.  That's what most people do.  That is normal and healthy  Keep dating, keep meeting new people until you find your match, that person who stimulated you both intellectually and physically.  Again, this is perfectly normal and how most people operate.  It's not that complicated. It's nowhere near as complicated as you're making it out to be.  Go outside and look at the sky, get out of your own head"

I believe that when it comes to aspects of your own personality there is no such thing as overthinking until you have a general understanding of the subject at hand. I have found the constructive criticism I was looking for in this post. I have found answers to the question I have asked. But I think ""overthinking"" something that could greatly affect your future isn't possible. This isn't even complex thought. This is just applying/reiterating things you can find in the majority of relationship books. Anyways I hope you have a great day. Thank you friend for your thoughts :]"

I have merely explained a very small part of my sexuality and what I aim to achieve in a close and/or sexual relationship with another human. In an ideal world I would find someone who thinks exactly like me, but life is rarely ideal. I am quite aware of this. I am honestly just looking for answers for anyone with experience with sapiosexuality. It is the closest word to how I become attracted to someone. I believe that people see the word and instantly think it synonymous with calling other people inferior or below you. I think sapiosexuals will never agree to this. They, like me, will realize that every human has their biological assets. Humans all have what they find attractive in people in order to find a connection. In my case it is intelligence. I can't change that. That doesn't mean I am going to be an asshole to people that don't think like me."

If you don't have an answer that is fine. I have only seen one person on here thus far who has taken what others have said and shown they are able to take a small amount of information and judge just that. They then went on to make assumptions, but that is very common on the internet. I have already explored the other parts of my personality. I started with what matters most and worked my way down. My goal is not to prove that I am smart to the people in this damn forum. I could honestly not care less about the opinions of others on the internet when it pertains to me intelligence. I am not here to even debate my intelligence. If you think I am dumb, that is fine. That is your opinion and you are welcome to it. I am curious to think what others have to say about my questions based on the limited information I have given them. In some lucky cases they will even explain their thought process."

You don't need to spend three paragraphs worth of $5 words telling me you think I'm wrong: two words will suffice. By ""explore other aspects of your personality"" I didn't say don't try to date smart people, I meant that you should think of ways you could make yourself attractive to the type of person you want to date. Learn to cook well, for example. Demonstrate your willingness to keep house and give them their space and free time to have deep discussions with people on their level. I think you could be a great partner to a highly intelligent person if you work at what you can realistically bring to that relationship."
relationship_advice,3dmz2m,miloohmy,-6,Fri Jul 17 17:53:35 2015 UTC,"Oh, I forgot to clarify. I have already gone over those subjects. I have no problem getting people to date me. I am an introvert, but I am not socially awkward. I dealt with those aspects of myself a long time ago. They were some of the first subject I started asking questions about on online forums. I am just stuck waiting 4 more weeks for my procedure and as I have checked off the majority of actual serious parts of my personality I decided to take a shot in the dark at something I honestly am trying to figure out before the problem arises. I know myself well enough to know that if I fall in love with someone, and marry them, then meet someone who I connect with better I will probably get a divorce and want to get to know that second person better. I would not want to put my significant other through that and I am trying to find answers to a question at the root of the problem. Sorry about using 5$ words, I read a lot and whenever I don't know a word I look it up and then it becomes part of my vocabulary. I find that words like that are better at explaining my point, although I try my best to not use them as much on a forum such as Reddit. There are less people who understand the words on here yet. You never know someone might be like me and love learning new words :]  And I really appreciate your comments. You are a very nice person."

But that is the topic of this board for me. I am trying to get answers about this part of my sexuality as it pertains to the relationships I form with others around me. Saying I am ""bisexually attracted to smart people"" is the same as stating I am ""sapiosexual"" in the context of this board. Would I say that I follow this ideology to its roots? Hell no. There are things that I value far above my sexuality in a relationship. In fact my sexuality does not have much pull at all when I meet someone because there are traits humans have that I value above all others.  Honesty and integrity are key for me in a relationship. I am here merely trying to get answers to the questions above as they pertain to my sexuality. Do people think that given that part of my personality that I should date other people? Or should I just be patient and let life take me on my path? I think a lot of people take small things like sexuality and equate it to how someone is in real life. That is a very radical and ridiculous notion. Then again I have seen a lot of people in the media who are branded by their sexuality. I don't know. It is a very complex question I am asking if you take all the pieces of the puzzle.

relationship_advice,3dmz2m,tacoman202,4,Fri Jul 17 17:25:19 2015 UTC,"Fine.  No, given the information you have presented about yourself here, you should not try to date other people.   Your post and responses have shown you to be pedantic and stubborn, and while you insist upon repeating the notion that you do not ""look down upon"" normal people, your clear and demonstrated inability here to interact with ""normal people"" in a meaningful way indicates, to me at least, that you will at best be frustrated in attempting to maintain a normal relationship, and at worst will find yourself given over to anger and rudeness in an attempt to meaningfully connect with someone whom you deem to have a lesser intelligence.  Your eschewing of physical attractiveness as a meaningful part of a sexual connection also means that while you may attract someone to be friends with, by the time you have come to ""love their mind"" they are likely to have placed you in the mythical ""friend-zone"".  People are quick to judge; nobody likes to be led on and you present yourself as an asexual intellectual type.  That initial impression is very difficult to shake.  Just from our short interaction here I have an image of you as insufferable and unwilling to actually engage in meaningful discourse, no matter how much you tout your ability and inclination to do so; you seem to mistake meaningful discourse for beating someone over the head with your opinions and ideas and demonstrate a refusal to entertain or envision a different point of view other than your own.  I personally do not believe that this is a true sexuality you are displaying.  I think that you are deceiving yourself about your disdain for ""normal"" members of society, perhaps to cover social ineptitude or narcissism.  Certainly your abject refusal to even entertain the thought that you may actually be in the wrong indicates the latter condition.  I also think that you are mistaking education for intelligence, and rejecting emotional intelligence and maturity in favor of ""knowledge-hoarding"", a decision I feel you will come to regret later in life, if you do not now, as it will render you incapable of meaningful human connection at all, and render you inable to enjoy the 'simple' joys of life, which you have rejected as material and shallow."

relationship_advice,3djtjb,Kaylas-91,11,Thu Jul 16 21:10:42 2015 UTC,"Not marrying you does not equate to him just wanting you for sex. You need to realise right now that some people just do not believe in marriage or they may see it as a hassle, but that doesn't mean that they don't want to be with someone long-term. You however like the idea of marriage, so you need to find someone similar to you.  As for staying with him until you find someone who wants marriage, I think you're wrong. You shouldn't stay with someone, just waiting for someone better. That's unfair to him and if you definitely need marriage, you need to tell him and split up. It's not fair to either of you to keep going if you know it's going to end badly.  You also need to bring up these discussions better. Asking him at a time when he has specified that he cannot deal with it is pretty wrong of you. Just calmly discuss it when things are good and just say that you need to know if you're on the same page or not. If he freaks out, then you shouldn't want to be with him anyway as communication is a necessity in any relationship. Hopefully he at least discusses it with you and you can figure out if this will work long-term or not."

You never went into detail about the scummy mannerisms, or her public acts, so I'm not really sure how they tie in. I will say that there is nothing wrong with dreaming about your future.   My suggestion is to talk to her about this. Try to get her back to reality by letting her know that it is too early for you to be planning those things. Especially since you've only been dating a few months. Ask her to slow down, assuming that is what you want. The thing is, clearly define what slowing down means to you.

Otherwise, please know that I have truly enjoyed our time together, that I'm sad to see it end, and that I genuinely wish you the best for a happy life.""  It's firm but fair and won't be what she expects to hear from you at all.  She's expecting you to protest, beg, plead, get defensive and be a jerk, or whatever.  I guarantee that she's not expecting you to call her on her own behavior (in a way that's firm but still gentlemanly) and stand up for your own honor and dignity. She's sure as shit not expecting you to say you want to end it because of HER behavior.  And something like this would almost certainly make her sit up and take notice.   I don't know if it will change the outcome, but it wouldn't surprise me if it did.  (And then you need to think about whether you want to take her back.  I get that it would be upsetting to hear something like that, but her reaction is about as classless as you can get).    If you do end up getting back together, she will be coming back to you with way more respect for you than she would have if you just beg and beg until you finally wear her down.

We saw a movie then drank beers at a craft brew joint nearby.

We talked the entire time, and it felt nice and comfortable. :) Really great company, really hit it off! So whether or not it was a date, I did enjoy his company a lot.

Still, we seem to be hitting it off and I do find her attractive so I'll take it slow and see how it goes.   And then the next day I am going on a date with someone a bit younger than me, but still within the ""(Your Age/2) + 7"" formula, but just barely. I'm not sure if she's just not that interested, but I am having to initiate most conversations. She's new to the state, so we'll see how that goes too.  And, of course, both of these dates are from OKC, and the first date, so I am really not trying to impress.

That being said, the back of a car isn't as trashy as you might think ;-)   Seriously though, you might really want to consider what it is that you're doing. You guys are going to be breaking up with one another, and trust me, I can kind of understand why. My fiance lives in Scotland for vet school, and long distance is the hardest thing I've had to do in my life. Right now, you guys are acting on impulse to conform to this expectation that the first time is going to be some wonderful, magical, life-altering thing.   It won't be.   Its going to be awkward, clumsy, painful to one if not both parties, messy, confusing, and overall just a really shitty time, if you're like probably 90% of the other people on this planet. And that's exactly how it should be. That being said, however, if you guys have been together for a while and truly care for each other, it can have a surprising emotional impact on both parties, one that you might want to give a second thought to before you lose it to each other and then leave each other. Consider whether or not either of you are capable of performing something so intimate, then immediately leaving each other. I know from personal experience that doing so can greatly cheapen a relationship, or at least the memories that you shared with the other person."

When my ex-wife and I separated and I watched her drive off into the literal sunset... there were about fifteen seconds of shock and then this non-euphoric sense of relief.  There was a shit ton of nasty divorce to happen, but I was no longer responsible for making her happy and trying to fix something that just couldn't be fixed. That felt so much... better. One burden was gone.  You are already hurting her if she's desperately hanging on. The act of cutting it will hurt as well... but then she's free. She can let go (start to), and she can start her own internal grief and recovery process.  If you want to do her any favors at that point, there are two easy options (that both can be done). 1. Keep away and don't confuse her about you meaning it's over. 2. Make sure someone is there for her. A friend that she can trust who you can simply message and say ""Wife and I just split. I am sad for us both and know that I can't be there to comfort her. Please check in and do what I can't?""  Mostly though #1. Get out of the way of her grief and let it happen.

She didn't improve her grades and now it is impossible for us to attend the same college now. She is afraid that I am going to leave her before college.

I think she looks beautiful pregnant and she gets compliments all the time, but it won't stop her from feeling that way unfortunately. So, I just keep telling her she's beautiful and to not talk about my wife that way. This is just something you might have to accept has a little bit from column a (your hormones) and a little b from column b (his fuckup). Now to address him, while I won't deny he is being fucked up by rubbing it in your face and maybe that's something you need to address with him ""bro, do you really need to be looking at porn in front of me, i know i'm preggos and we can't just fuck freely like we used to and believe me i'm frustrated too but can't you just rub one out when i'm not around like any other decent person?"" Maybe he's just expressing his sexual frustration and doesn't realize how fucked up it is. It also may not hurt to mention how he'd feel if you were sitting around all day looking at half naked pictures of liam helmsworth or chris pratt or tom hardy. Either way it sounds like something that should blow over once the baby comes so I wouldn't invest too much thought into being upset over it (it's not good for the baby anyway).

Follow ALL of the advice that these professionals give you, but don't be afraid to ask for other opinions, especially from other professionals, one lawyer may approach your situation differently than another, same as a doctor may have a different treatment for a condition or a therapist may have a different treatment plan for psychological issues.

Know what a good picture is and how to take one, or get a professional one taken that doesn't look so highschool yearbookish.  After that, it's about conversation. If you are matching with someone and chatting, frankly you have to sort it out on your own. You have to know how to build a good conversation, keep it going, and hopefully be yourself.

I wouldn't recommend visiting it as it will leave you utterly depressed.  I will, however, give you the key headline: she isn't going to change.  I'm sorry man. But this is just how she is, she has a lower libido than you and the early excitement of being in a new relationship has gone. If you have a child with her, things will not get better.   You simply have to decide whether you can continue in a relationship with little sex/affection. Be honest with yourself - don't try and pretend that sex isn't important because those of us with a higher libido know that it absolutely is. If you can't, then you should end it now.  I understand that you'll feel some guilt, but that is not a reason to stay with someone. The best thing you can do is be honest with her and yourself."

Never have a kid to fix a problem.  The problem will still be there, but with the added complication of having a child with that person.  If her views on sex don't mesh well with yours now, pregnancy and marriage with a child isn't likely to change that unless she changes, and to do that, she needs to see a need to change and want to do it.  If you both really want different things, then in order to be happy, that's got to be with different people."

Perhaps hormone replacement therapy is an option, assuming something is out of whack and not treatable naturally.  ii. I very recently heard about a medication currently being developed that is supposed to increase libido in women. It isn't like Viagra, where it aids in the physical manifestation once you've already become sufficiently stimulated emotionally. It will actually increase the sex drive itself. It's in trials right now. There may be unforseen side effects that stop it from being released, but I'd say it's still worth keeping an eye on.  I'd at least see if she's up for getting her hormones checked. If there's nothing that can be done there, you may want to make a decision about all of this sooner than when that medication finally comes out. You'll just have to see where your head is when that time comes."

I also have a younger sister (23) who my mom had when she was 37. There is plenty of time for you to have kids if that's what you want. Further, there is still time for you GF. Her biological ability to have kids has nothing to do with you. And, as little as men like to hear it, we (women) don't actually need a man to have kids--true we need something men provide, but many women get sperm in ways other than through sex with a monogamous partner.  Adoption, fostering, etc are also wonderful options for parenthood (taking care of the unwanted kids who are already in the world and all that).   Bottom line- you need to find a way to make yourself happy. Whether that's through a new relationship or whatever. Because having kids with this woman is not the answer that you're looking for and (spoiler) kids know when they're parents are unhappy."

I would maybe try therapy or something see what a professional thinks? If that does not work i'd leave you still young and there is a lot ahead of you still and spending your life with someone just because you scared you might not find someone better is silly.... you won't now if you find something better until you let go of what's holding you down right now which is the sex less relationship.... sex should be fun and exciting for both parties not a chore that you get it over with.

If you're not ready then she needs to find someone who is (and probably at a similar age).  You also should not sign in blood on a relationship that has been decimated in quality to your happiness. The sex is only the canary in the mineshaft for a host of other relational problems.

There is a whole subreddit about married (your LTR is like marriage) sexual strategy for men so that their wives or girlfriends keep getting them laid. Between November and February of this year I got laid 4 times. Since discovering that sub I can't count the number of times I've gotten laid or got a blowjob and I used to get those on my birthday if I got lucky.   That subreddit's name is Married Red Pill. It's not about tricking women or emotionally abusing them. It's also focused more on nurturing your LTR than the red pill is. It's about changing yourself to become someone women and by proxy your wife or girlfriend will want to have sex with. I can't argue with the results it has given me. My life took a complete 180 since then both in the amount of sex I'm getting and the respect with which my wife is treating me.  At this point you have nothing to lose. You implement it and your girlfriend starts fucking you or you implement it she is still cold and then you're in a great position to leave her. Either way it's better than to accept what others here are telling you which is to just leave her and wallow in your misery, find another girl and find yourself in exactly the same situation a few years later."

relationship_advice,3dksjk,20per10flat,2,Fri Jul 17 01:58:22 2015 UTC,"You need to be careful about depending on one person too much, not that you shouldn't get support from her at all or anything, but it is important that you are finding independence at the same time. You are still young, things might change as you get older. It can be difficult to tackle the picture when you are within the frame, but try to take a step back and take things in when you can.  I know it is not easy. Bouts of anything can be surreal and overwhelming, it can be draining. Especially if your home is one of the things that is dragging you down. You might find your depression significantly improves. Do you think it would? I am not sure if you avoid detail to be brief or if you are afraid to talk about it.   Open up in a diary or even to a stranger (like how you can find willing, and even kind people, here, depending) - just getting the thoughts out somewhere can help you process it. Instead of saturating yourself in the dominating misery of that darkness, you take it and channel it into something else. Exercise (dancing, whatever) or creating art (choose your form) are two examples of outlets. We are all different and it may take time to find something. You have to pick it up into routine and see if things change on the long term - what kind of consistency do you see and are there positive results?  There are professionals that work on a sliding scale and some services you can also find for free, it depends, sometimes you find it in a church and depending on the church it depends on the quality and if it suits you. Even a counselor in general might not jive with you (although it can happen where one resists transparency or anything that might rehabilitate their situation or condition, and some things we have to separate ourselves from) - it's work on a personal level and finding someone who can work with you on it.  Eventually you are going to talk to her, I say give it time. Or if you have contacted each other already, just ask if you can talk about it. Will it bug her if you get it off your chest some? Maybe she won't be in the mood or maybe during vacation just in not a good time. You are worried that it will bother her, so put that first and see if she is available. I always reassure people they don't have to do something just to be nice, to reinforce that I want to respect their feelings at the time - I mean, you know, it can just be a lot to ask. What's a good outlet and alternative for you here? A positive one, hopefully! Maybe it will do the same for you as talking does :)"

I talk to her A LOT about it when she is here and she is super understanding and helpful.   I dunno, I just feel like I drag her down or bum her out all the time, and I definitely don't want that, and I figure I should at least give her her vacation time to not have to deal with me anymore?  My brevity is primarily a function of the fact that there are people who have it so much worse than me, I don't feel right going into detail about a narcissist father (who is never physically abusive) or a little bit of depression (I've never seriously considered suicide, not self harmed, It's just this dragging feeling of despair and hopelessness, like there's no real reason for me to move or do anything.)

That seems very up and down emotionally - I don't know if that's a plan for the long term. What you need is a balance. You could just be depressed and telling yourself these things, which is why you can only know if you talk to her. My partner and I both love psychology, she had a life growing up with a therapist in her life and I didn't, and I occasionally lean on her. She's pretty assertive about when she doesn't have any more energy! All couples do this, sometimes it's just stress instead of depression, or whatever, and everyone reaches a point where they need to take a step back. You might have to work on what balance is good.  There is a sub for people with narcissistic parents, if you were not aware! /r/raisedbynarcissists if you do not know. No physical abuse is awesome, but his verbal escalation... maybe he's verbally abusive. He's negative enough to be an influence on your mental health, perhaps, so while his behavior not being physical is a positive thing, there is still that toxicity. You should have to feel like fuuuuuuuuuuuuck. And oh man can that hole ever go deeper. Good luck!"

I'd suggest just saying that, and then allowing your parents to make their choice. If they bring the cats, so be it - they have fewer guests.  That does not have to be hostile for it to be reality. They can make an informed decision and then life can do it's thing.  It's all simple the way I paint it, I do realize that. But it's your choice for it to be anything more.  ""Son, we'd love to see you two at the lake house, why aren't you coming?""  ""Well parents, I told you that WIFE UNIT 00001 is severely allergic to cats and asked that you keep them out of the lake house. You brought them, knowing that, and now I can't bring the unit around.

Really, once you give an adult a clear understanding of their ability to choose and the known outcomes for each choice discussed... you kinda have to let them choose and live with the results.  I.e. You and WIFE UNIT 00001 never go to the lake house or their house.  They visit you, or you meet elsewhere. It definitely sucks but then you embrace that and let it go."

relationship_advice,3djvp4,xxramboamboxx,3,Thu Jul 16 21:59:24 2015 UTC,"Feels like if you do give in to an ultimatum, you basically let the other person dictate the value of the relationship and kind of submit to them (and will probably be bitter about it). And if you don't give in, you are basically the one responsible for the breakup... both alternatives are crappy, so no matter what the outcome is you kind of end up losing.  The silly part is that it wasn't even a difficult situation in my case. It would have been something really easy to just talk about and fix. It was basically just about being more open with family, which had been mentioned in the past but never really brought up as a problem or seriously talked about.  I could understand an ultimatum if it was about some ongoing major problem that had been previously talked about and wasn't getting fixed... but for something like this it just seemed so weird."

My problem is that rather than just talking with me, I ended up getting this ultimatum instead, which is what seemed so inappropriate.  I guess I'm trying to figure out if I'm blowing this out of proportion, or if I am right to be offended by the way my partner handled the situation by throwing down an ultimatum (which also feels like it cheapens the relationship) rather than just properly communicating with me to handle the problem together."

Here is the update in very abbreviated point form:  -Explained why I'm not okay with ultimatums and explained how our communication likely needs work  -Partner agreed ultimatum was a mistake and agreed communication needs work  -Discussed things more in depth and determined that partner was internalizing some things that were not properly expressed and leading to misunderstandings and assumptions  -Laid out a plan for improved future communication and identified areas for us both to work on improving moving forward  Overall went pretty well. Discussed some things that probably needed to be addressed. Hopefully this avoids other problems in the future or at least gives us a better platform to work from. Thanks again for everyone's help.

relationship_advice,3dkly4,JM_URBSA,2,Fri Jul 17 00:59:59 2015 UTC,"She wants to break up because she still has feelings for someone else.  That's... a really valid reason to break up with someone.  Being able to actually date him is a moot point.  Trust me, you don't want to date someone who's in love with someone else, it always ends badly.  Bigger picture:  nobody needs a reason to break up with anyone.  Reasons are nice but unnecessary.  You're not going to get back together with her just because you don't like her reason for breaking up."

When she finds another guy who makes her happy, reality really hits and you know for sure she's not ""yours"" anymore. It's really quite normal to feel some jealousy in this kind of situation, but you have to think about what you have now, and why you're with your current girlfriend instead of your ex.   Also, in general, other people's successes can be a trigger of jealousy, because we tend to compare our lives with theirs.

relationship_advice,3dids3,theocrattt,2,Thu Jul 16 14:52:47 2015 UTC,"I know someone else said what you are experiencing is not real ""attachment"" but I'm going to use the word anyway.   I used to be very much like you.  I would start dating or talking to a gal and next thing I know I'm falling for them (in a matter of days or weeks). Most times I lived in fantasy land as I was very shy but occasionally things would work out and we would start dating.   What I would find was I would be over head over heels in no time. The problem was 90% of the time they were crazy and by the time I found I was already too wrapped up.   So what did I learn?  I get attached really fast not much  I can do to change that (consequently it is a lot better than not being able to emotionally bond at all).  BUT I have to accept that reality and be VERY careful to LIMIT my contact with people that I can't have a healthy relationship with.   I will not allow myself to carry on with:  Someone who already has a boyfriend / husband.  Is not emotionally available  Smokes  Isn't within my age range.  Doesn't have a car  Doesn't have a career or a going to school (has to at least have a job).   One night stands are toxic for someone like me I really have a hard time getting physical without developing feelings. So really casual sex should be off the table for you too (I swear this messes up more guys like us getting into relationships we would never want to be in) you shouldn't be lured into a relationship purely for sex.   Isn't emotionally healthy.   Isn't capable of saying she was wrong ever.   Of course on the pro side:  Someone you feel great with having spent an hour of your time with   Someone drama free  Someone fun (life is just too short to be spending your time who isn't happy around you)  One of my friends girlfriends added someone you can be around in silence without it being awkward.   You should verify all of this before you get physical. Don't settle for less OP it is much better to be single and happy then to settle with crazy."

To me it's plain as day that he's giving you some cop-out with the hurt excuse. ""i've been hurt before by girls who didn't want a relationships so now I'm just not going to have one with this really cool girl who wants one with me because it feels better to remain single and lonely and to put myself out there to get rejected some more"" there's something fishy with that logic.

I told my boyfriend and he obviously didn't care.  The second was after a party at my place, a male friend who is also an ex slept there due to unforeseen circumstances. Same empty house, different rooms. I told my boyfriend the next day and he didn't give a shit, even seemed surprised I would feel the need to tell him.  The third was after a party, I was supposed to sleep at a female friend's place but she ended up leaving very early and the same male friend offered me to ask his parents to stay at his instead, as his sibling was out of town. We slept in the same room but separate beds. It didn't come up in conversation with my boyfriend and I didn't feel the need to mention it since it seemed so similar to the 2nd scenario to me.  A few years later, my partner and I were discussing boundaries and he mentioned that he thought it was not OK to sleep in the same house alone or the same room even if there are other people in the house. I brought up those past events and he said there was a caveat where it was OK for him when it was after a party that had taken place in the same place the sleeping happened, which made event 2 OK but event 3 not OK (event 1 is a no-brainer because the alternative was sleeping on the street). He admitted this was a bit irrational but nonetheless, that's how he feels.  This is getting really long-winded but what I am getting at is that I agreed to not do it again in the future. Even if I don't see anything wrong with it myself (my boundary is not in the same  bed), it makes him uncomfortable and it is a very reasonable request and doesn't cost me much to not do it so I just said I wouldn't and that was the end of that. He also didn't blame me for having done it because we hadn't discussed it beforehand, nor was it obvious. His caveat is highly specific and hard to intuit.  You'll also note that the three times, it was a last minute thing and nothing happened.   Tl;Dr: Talk to her. I don't see an issue with it, an ex did it while we were together and I did it while with my partner but once he told me he was uncomfortable with that, I agreed to stop and he agreed I wasn't to blame for actions I didn't know were an issue. It's not inherently wrong in my book but that's a reasonable boundary to have."

Once was alone in a male friends house having dinner, another was a male friend staying at her one room apartment when she was working out of the country. She can't understand why I feel this way, I can't understand why she would do it in the first place. When you are single, fair enough but nearing 2 years into a relationship with a future. When it happens, or I think it about it happening I fell terrible. I still believe there is nothing untowards happening, I do trust her. The guys? I don't know them so maybe can't trust them?

The first one might make sense if she was drinking and couldn't drive/get back - if she had a way to get back home it's weirder to me.  She might just see them super platonically and think you are being paranoid. I think you're just coming from different perspectives - you're seeing them as potential threats, she's seeing it as 'well it's only joe, of course nothing would ever go on with him'. She probably doesn't see why you're seeing them sexually (as potential sexual encounters) when she sees them so platonically. That said, if you tell her not to do it because it makes you uncomfortable and she does it anyway that's an issue in itself."

Doesn't matter what she thinks, it's what you think and your comfort levels."
relationship_advice,3dhlht,your_what_hurts,2,Thu Jul 16 13:58:31 2015 UTC,"I have the same mindset as you. But there are more things to consider. You can't judge an entire relationship based on one happening or situation. Was she stranded and you contacted the friend to help and logistically it was better for her to get some shuteye at his place?  But sleeping in the same bed, yes would bother me even if the scenario was platonic on paper, sharing the same bed should still be off limits. The way I see it, it's no different if you were to call up a friend and stay at her place....in her bed, with her in it. So it shouldn't matter the excuse, reason, or situation. To me, it's not hard to say either one would sleep on the couch, or hell, on the hardwood floor with pillows and blankets and just have 1 miserable night, for sake of the bad situation. The significant other shouldn't have to listen to excuses or the scenario of leading events. It's a simple, play with fire expect to be burned - situation. Things do happen, and things do go too far.   You weren't there, but you shouldn't have to be there in order to trust her. Hearing ""omg I had to sleep on the floor with the dog"" would've improved the trust that is already there. Or you didn't give your significant other the chance to drive 1-4 hours to come get you. Why couldn't the girl stay at a hotel? Was the saving of $50-100 for one night worth this awkward scenario?  If this was just a one-off, then I think it's best to move forward, but to communicate things heavily. Show your perspective, and communicate that you don't like it. And all steps should be taken to not be in that situation. Each scenario is different and you just have to go with your gut on this. If she was traveling and if you think she could be in this situation in the future, and if tiny annoyances question your trust, well, you shouldn't have to put up with that. You shouldn't have to say - don't wear such revealing clothes, wear a bra, don't wink at the cute guy at the bar, don't touch his butt, don't sleep with another man in the same bed. Or saying things like - reconsider your actions as if I were there with you, in person. Would you still do it?  What happened? What's the story or situation???"
relationship_advice,3dhlht,OneGirlArmy,2,Thu Jul 16 13:55:04 2015 UTC,"In his bedroom (not bed - maybe a spare bed), or just alone in the house for the night. Maybe a spare room.   If he only has one room that belongs just to him, I'd accept sharing a room.  I would raise an eyebrow at sharing a room in a multiroom place where there are no roommates.  I'd be wigged out at them sharing a bed.  I've slept over at a guy friend's place, but we were in separate rooms.  MrAnthropic was fine with it, but he's very non-jealous.  He's gone on trips where his ex was there & I wasn't, but he didn't stay with his ex.  We've been happily together over 15 years.    That said, what's ok for us may not be ok for you."

relationship_advice,3dhlht,OneGirlArmy,-1,Thu Jul 16 16:53:43 2015 UTC,"I think you are projecting your own relationship experiences onto me.  We have already been through amazingly difficult things (innapropriate contact by his ex, infertility, miscarriage, murdered family dog).  These things have brought us closer and made us realize that the two of us are really all that we have in this world.  There is no closer relationship than that with your spouse.  There is no fear as there is no judgement.  We can come to each other with anything, no matter how horrible it sounds or makes us feel.  Like you said-all relationships work differently."

I'm not projecting anything, my relationship is entirely different from yours and I like it that way. I have a strong marriage just as you do. I just don't see how you could say there is 100% honest communication and no judgement when you would reevaluate the relationship based on one statement made by your husband."
relationship_advice,3dhlht,reloadfreak,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:04:59 2015 UTC,"Read the original statement.  If he spent the night with another woman, yes I would divorce him.  He would do the same for me.  It breaks a trust boundary and is a very slippery slope.  If he suggested he sleep in an unrelated woman's room, based on the morals we have set in our marriage, I wouldn't divorce him but it would warrant a serious conversation on integrity.  These conversations on boundaries came up pre-marriage.  If he all of a sudden wanted to change them of course it should set off red flags as it WOULD be a reevaluation of our morals (per him, set off by his request).  Especially because hotel rooms are pretty cheap and there are few instances, actually none I can think of, that one wouldn't make sense in that situation.  Different strokes for different folks.  We are both good looking people and enjoy the attention that brings but neither wants to make the other needlessly jealous."

I guess what it comes down to is:  if you aren't comfortable with it, she should want to respect that.    But, that said, I would have a very hard time accepting this attitude from a boyfriend; I'd think he didn't trust me and I'd probably start thinking about ending the relationship.  My husband would never be bothered by this, maybe not even if I shared a bed with the guy, depending on who it was.  I've always had male (and female) close friends, grew up with guys, had sleepovers -- this thread is making me realize that's not necessarily the norm.  For me, it was; maybe your girlfriend is similar.  I have some male friends that my husband wouldn't want me to share a room with, but I know who they are and he'd never need to ""remind me"" about them; it wouldn't come up.  There are so many where it genuinely just wouldn't be an issue, though.  If these friends of hers are former fuck buddies or boyfriends, or she knows they want to sleep with her or something, she shouldn't create a situation where she's staying the night at their house.  If not though, if you're just bothered by ""the principle of the thing,"" some people (like me) are going to be dumbfounded by that.  It's archaic and irrational."

If he is ONLY her friend and she just wants to play sleep over-then no-its not appropriate.

I think it would be inappropriate if they have a history together, if either have a questionable history or there is excessive drug use, alcohol use. I could see someone being uncomfortable if they didn't know the male friend.  I once had a male friend (who was a dear friend's boyfriend of like 10+ years) come visit me while I had a bf. It was supposed to be dinner but he drank too much and it was late so he stayed over instead of driving 4+ hours. My bf hadn't met him at this point, told him my friend was visiting but didn't tell him until after my friend left that he stayed over. My bf was not jealous at all... those guys are now friends.   This is why it is important to understand each other's boundaries in relationships. It would have been reasonable if my bf was uncomfortable with the situation.

The physical violence against objects and constant deflecting of blame onto you are red flags for an abusive relationship. You should strongly consider if you want to continue this relationship and tolerating this behavior before you start being conditioned to accept it.

He knows much more on the subject than me so it's already hard to talk about or give my advice and opinions as he knocks them all down.  I've tried to stop advising and just be positive but this isn't enough for him. This is one of the common anger/violence inducing issues where he feels he can't win eating healthy or strict dieting and slamming/shouting/picking at other relationship areas comes into play. This is where id like to support him most but again I'm struggling what I can do to support if not cook and advise and offer to see dietitians with him... Thanks guys

relationship_advice,3dfxoe,PreviouslySaydrah,120,Thu Jul 16 06:20:01 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm a former victim advocate with over 2,000 hours volunteered mostly working on domestic violence and sexual assault cases.  Listen, the decision is yours and you can't let anyone take that away from you. However, do not make it based on concern for him. There are a few reasons that feeling badly for him isn't a good reason to decline to file a police report:   You did not make the choice to commit domestic violence for him; therefore you are not getting him in trouble. He got himself in trouble when he committed a serious crime. If this is a first offense, he will likely be offered an option to get anger management counseling, substance abuse treatment, and comply with probation, with no jail time. If it is not a first offense, then he has a serious problem and should be facing more serious consequences. About his job: If he loses his job, that means his employer cares about the other employees' safety enough not to employ someone to work alongside them who has a history of unprovoked violent assault. And realistically, you would be very surprised at how many men with a record of misdemeanor domestic violence are employed in good, lucrative jobs. If they complied with treatment and finished their probation and haven't had an incident since, many employers give the benefit of the doubt. This isn't as true for felons, but I don't see a felony here unless he's a serious repeat offender. Would you want your little sister to work in a place where the colleague at the next desk is a savage, unprovoked woman-beater who hasn't faced any consequences for his actions and assumes he can hit women and get out of it by making them feel badly for him?   Here are some things you should consider:   Reporting a domestic assault isn't fun--the investigation is invasive and can be aggressive. You may feel like you are the one being treated like a criminal. This is because law enforcement doesn't file charges without feeling fairly sure a prosecutor will pursue a case against the perpetrator, and the prosecutor needs to have some indication from the responding officers that the victim's story won't fall apart when the perpetrator gets an attorney. Restraining orders don't reliably keep a DV perpetrator away from you. RO violations are common and sometimes an RO will just make the perpetrator incensed enough to attack again. Depending on where you live, you may have to testify in court, in his presence, about the assault. This won't happen if he takes a plea deal (which most offenders do for a first offense misdemeanor DV charge) but it may if he demands a jury trial as is his right under the law. He may have his friends and family harass and bully you for ""trying to ruin his life.""   That being said, here are a few factors on the ""Do Report"" side:   He attacked you savagely without provocation. This is very dangerous behavior and statistically, it tends to continue in subsequent relationships and tends to escalate in severity. The next woman is likely to have even worse injuries than you do. Abusing intimate partners correlates strongly with abusing children and pets, too. In all likelihood, this behavior is something that makes him a very unhappy person and that he feels he can't control. He is wrong - he can control it! But he needs professional intervention to teach him how. If he doesn't get it, he may end up spending the rest of his life with the knowledge that he killed his girlfriend or wife in a fit of rage. If you want to see the most miserable person in the world, meet someone who is in jail for killing a spouse that they felt they loved. It's a hell of a lot harder on someone than losing a job. You have a fundamental right to be safe from violence in your intimate relationships. He has violated that fundamental human right, and it is justified, not cruel, to take action on that basis to ensure that he faces the legal consequences society has assigned to violent assault of an intimate partner. You can mitigate many of the risks associated with reporting domestic violence. For instance, you can ask for a Victim Advocate and get help making a personal safety plan to deal with the risk he will violate your protective order. You may be eligible for victim's compensation to help you with costs like medical bills and changing locks on your home to keep you safe. You need to heal from this emotionally as well as physically. After a domestic violence incident, women often end up in a pattern where they date violent men over and over again. This is normal and an expected response to trauma, but you can prevent it by seeking therapy. Reporting the incident can help you access referrals to qualified therapists, and there may be help available with the cost.   And lastly, once again, this is your decision and something you should choose based on what will help you sleep best at night and heal from this trauma. The first step toward healing is to take back control of your life - this means that you get to make this choice. You can seek advice, but it is best for your healing process that you ultimately sit with yourself and make the decision.  If you are going to report, however, please do it quickly while the injuries are still as photographable as they are now!"
relationship_advice,3dfxoe,irradiant1,9,Thu Jul 16 02:03:01 2015 UTC,"Agree this is excellent.  My (now ex) wife of 2 years attacked me.  I had ""minor"" injuries (huge claw marks down the back of my neck were the most notable).  I called the cops that night which was the best move I could have made in hindsight.  She pleaded with me to drop the RO, so I did rescind that if she agreed to avoid me - which was a stupid move on my part.    She is taking a plea bargain.  Aside from having to hire an attorney, it doesn't appear to be causing her too much trouble.  I have since found out that she had assaulted 2 former boyfriends (some compelling evidence).  Had they stepped up and filed charges I might have been spared this mess - who knows.    Your choice, but if someone assaults you I'd recommend police being called ASAP.  Oh, so when she figured out that I called the cops, she attempted to choke herself.  Her plan was to have a viable reason to explain attacking me.  She has fantastic pictures of bruises the next day.  Trouble is the cops were able to determine they were self inflicted that night.  Had I waited a day it would have been more a he said/she said ordeal.  Even with that, she is still telling friends her ""story"".  If you attack anyone (even beyond a loved one) you are wack in the head."
relationship_advice,3dfxoe,PreviouslySaydrah,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:34:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing that--I think a lot of people assume it's much easier to trick trained police officers than it really is. Unless you have reason to believe your local PD is undertrained in domestic violence, which is increasingly rare since VAWA has been around a long time now, there's a very good chance that they will accurately determine the primary aggressor in a domestic assault."

relationship_advice,3dfxoe,PreviouslySaydrah,3,Thu Jul 16 08:09:29 2015 UTC,"This reads like trolling/satire, but I'll respond on the assumption that you're a real person in pain choosing this as the place to express it.  While harassing you for money is annoying and can certainly make life harder, it's not a crime against you. You do not have access to the services that are available to victims of violent crimes such as OP.   You should probably consider seeking counseling privately. Many insurance plans cover it and your workplace may offer an Employee Assistance Plan (EAP) that offers free therapy. It sounds like the divorce has been very traumatic to you and has caused problematic, toxic habits in how you think and how you interact with others. You could certainly benefit from therapy, but remember that change is hard work and therapists aren't miracle workers.  You should also be aware that you've endowed yourself with a self-fulfilling prophecy. Most smart, kind, loving, and loyal woman who want a male life partner would never dream of going on even one date with someone who said something like:   There's no reward for the family man because it seems women leave us nice guys for the thugs that either hit them or cheat on them.   This is a foolish, misogynist, and just plain stupid thing to say, and most women are aware that they can attract better than fools, misogynists, and stupid people. You will only have access to date or marry women who will treat you badly, as you've predicted, because you are not conducting yourself in a way that is attractive to anything but people who themselves are so wounded that they're willing to subject themselves to a relationship with someone who sees women in this way.  And, of course, as you continue to attract women who think as little of you as you think of them, you will continue to be treated the way that you've predicted, and this will confirm your belief that ""women are bad.""   There's nothing wrong with choosing to live your life as a single person and avoiding dating because you don't find that you have success in relationships. It's a perfectly valid choice. But please don't traumatize your sons and convince them they have no chance at happiness just because their father is in pain and suffering after the trauma of divorce."

relationship_advice,3dfxoe,chocolatesaltyballs4,64,Thu Jul 16 16:14:23 2015 UTC,I was not expecting that when I clicked your pics. THIS IS NOT MINOR BRUISING. A guy did that to you and you feel sorry for HIM? I don't give a fuck if he's an engineer or the president of the United States. It doesn't give him a free pass to beat women and get away with it. He knows better and now he can face the consequences. You need to stop worrying about what will happen to him if you file a police report. That is not your problem!!
relationship_advice,3dfxoe,Artful_Dodger_42,22,Thu Jul 16 17:12:27 2015 UTC,"And if you hadn't been able to get away, what do you think would have happened? This guy has something bad inside him if he is casually assaulting women with no provocation. At the very least, this will put him on notice in his future relationships.  Likely, nothing will come out of the police report. Its a matter of he said, she said. But, it will serve as a red flag to the police in the future if he pops up on their radar again. A police report will not preclude him from a job."
relationship_advice,3dfxoe,Lydious,62,Thu Jul 16 17:16:06 2015 UTC,"I don't feel right about filing a police report that could lead to charges against him sending him to jail and possibly cost him his job and make finding future employment difficult for him.   Why? It won't be your fault if these things happen. He attacked you unprovoked. If he faces some harsh consequences for it it's HIS fault. He assaulted you out of nowhere for no reason, he deserves anything he gets. If you hadn't gotten away, this ""minor bruising"" could have been some ""minor"" broken bones. This is probably not the first time he's hit his girlfriend, you're probably just the first one to actually do anything about it. You pressing charges & him suffering some consequences might finally teach him a lesson.  Please don't take this as an insult or anything, but I would also suggest working your self-esteem and maybe getting some therapy to get to the root of why you feel so guilty for this guy reaping the consequences of his actions. Your guilt over this is about 1000 miles away from coming anywhere close to healthy. If a guy did this to me, I would be angrier than an entire nest of hornets. I wouldn't be feeling sorry for him because he might lose his job as a consequence of violently attacking me. I would gleefully press every charge I could and I'd do everything to make sure that he DID lose his job and suffer every last consequence possible."

Empathy is a wonderful, admirable quality to have, and I actually understand how you feel right now cause I had the same problem with overactive empathy for a long time. I put up with a lot of abuse because I was afraid of hurting anyone's feelings by standing up for myself, but you just gotta stay strong and save your empathy for those who deserve it, not those who deliberately inflict harm. It's hard, but you can do it. Following through with legal action on this dirtbag is a great place to start."

relationship_advice,3dfxoe,MemeInBlack,3,Wed Jul 15 23:51:36 2015 UTC,"Would it help if you tried to think about and shift your empathy from him to his other victims, including future ones?

If he doesn't want repercussions in his own like he must STOP ASSAULTING PEOPLE. Any consequences to him are NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY; they are HIS. You wouldn't be in a position to report him in the first place if he had not gone randomly apeshit on you. He chose to run up behind you and slap your face. He chose to climb on top of you and continue to press his attack. He chose to assault you.   Now you get to choose. Are you going to protect yourself, or are you going to cower down and let him do this to somebody else, worse, in the future, because you don't want him to LOSE HIS JOB? Honey, why do you care unless you're planning on making him into your sugar daddy or husband?"
relationship_advice,3dfxoe,Hooty__McBoob,18,Thu Jul 16 09:43:50 2015 UTC,"As a police officer I can tell you that more than likely the police won't be able to do anything. In my state, this is second degree assault and is only arrest able if we witness it. Filing a police report won't be a quick fix. What it will do is document his actions, they can take picture of your bruises, and they will have this report for the next time he does something like this. In my opinion just file the report it won't hurt anything and will definitely come in handy for the next poor girl.   Also it won't ruin his life. These records won't be public, and he won't get arrested or anything. It's literally straight documentation. However a restraining order would more than likely show up on a background check.

I've been in a similar situation and I made a mistake of not pressing charges so that the attacker doesn't have problems getting education, a job, etc (we were teenagers). And guess what? That person didn't change a bit, continued to be violent and to bully people.  Filing report is fair and it's the only way for people to learn some kind of lesson, not to mention that it's the only way to be safe.  I've experienced another situation. My roommate's boyfriend got violent and I called the police. The boyfriend left. The police said they can't do much unless there's visible bruises, harm to property, etc. Only then a restraining order could be obtained. And boy how I wished later to have a restraining order! The boyfriend started stalking my roommate (trying to look into windows from outside, following a car, etc.) and behaving crazy. The system is pretty messed up because if you're in that situation you can't do much, you have to live in fear and wait to be ""harmed"".  Please get a restraining order while you can!"

BIG MISTAKE.   after he realized i didn't report him, he was instructed by his brother to go to the police and lie and file a fraudulent report against me. the reason for this is, whoever gets to the police first is often viewed as the most credible. it becomes difficult to paint yourself as the victim when you've stayed quiet and allowed yourself to be painted as the attacker. if you wait to report him, and he's reported you first, it looks like you are retaliating for him turning you in.   long story short, i was caught up in legal issues for over a year and he manipulated the legal system to harass me...all because i was concerned about ruining my attackers life. now there are public records that paint a terrible picture of me despite the fact that i was the one physically attacked and just trying to do the right thing by all involved. (i've still not recovered from all this mentally or financially and it's a struggle to get up each day and this was a few years ago).  better safe than sorry. good luck to you no matter what you decide."

My attacker went on to violently rape a 13 year old (among other violent crimes) and it could have ended with me. I live with that every day and it eats me alive. Don't let yourself have to feel like you could have stopped something. People like this never only do this once.

If it isn't a pattern, maybe it's a one time thing, at least you did your due diligence and everyone is aware. If it is an ongoing thing (methinks it is) then you're potentially saving some lives and protecting yourself from nightmares and harm down the road.  If you're really thinking it's overkill, just think about what he did to you for no reason, out of the blue. I'd say that was overkill.

Do you think he won't do this again to someone else? Your decision is yours. But from an outside perspective, I think you need to go to the police ASAP, if not for yourself, then for all the people he may already have harmed and the people who may come next."
relationship_advice,3dfxoe,cheesezombie,3,Thu Jul 16 05:26:37 2015 UTC,This is a serious attack. Don't even slightly hesitate. He is a violent and dangerous predator.
relationship_advice,3dfxoe,soleilazure,3,Thu Jul 16 05:39:09 2015 UTC,"Christ, OP. ""Just bruising""?? To hit hard enough to cause the discoloration on your face, the seedling ... I know it's hard to do something you feel will impact him negatively but he made his choice when he hit you.  If over empathy is an issue for you, focus on the other women he will hit that you can help prevent by reporting this to police. The scared, terrified women he will abuse that will never know about his violence because there wasn't a paper trail to prove it.  He may have issues keeping employment, but he made that choice. That's not on you. He chose to risk everything when he decided violence was something he wanted to commit. Everyone should have the chance to now know what kind of person they're employing, dating, etc.  If you feel too much empathy to do it for you, do it for the future yous he'll meet and wait in the shadows to strike as he did you.   And please take time to heal for you. Rest, heal up and feel free to talk to someone. You are incredibly strong and I'm so floored you scared and immediately cut him off - that's so incredible."

Maybe a bricklayer should have police involved, but certainly not an O&Whateverhtefuck engineer!?!

I want to put his violence on record in case this happens again in the future, but I don't want to send someone to jail, potentially cost them their job, and future opportunities for employment over this. It doesn't seem like a fair tradeoff to me to ruin his livelihood just because I have to walk around with some bruises on my face for a few weeks.

Or if another girl already has a restraining order on him a judge would notice a pattern and you're just the final straw or boiling point.   Those photos. Ugh. I do agree with the restraining order. And you should file for assault. Like anything he can pay his way out of it, if he has enough money, but he beat up your face. He doesn't deserve luxuries in life. You have bruises, basically it's on a silver platter to take things as far as possible. If you didn't get away, it could've been far worse. His intentions and actions were lining up for something worse.   You shouldn't give two craps about a guy like this. Restraining order, pepper spray, police report. But you should go for way more."

Otherwise, he's going to spend the rest of your marriage bothered by the fact that you got to sleep with someone else and he didn't.  What's your objection? You did it. Why shouldn't he?  I kind of know how he feels. For years, half the time my girlfriend said anything to me, what I really heard was ""Ha ha I cheated on you and totally got away with it. Ha ha I cheated on you and totally got away with it. ...""  Here's the thing though: even if he does sleep with someone else, it probably won't help the marriage. If the two of you haven't gotten into couple's therapy, you need to."

You had a prolonged affair with someone else, what did you really expect? Obviously you didn't really care for your husband. That being the case, I'm not entirely sure why you are so upset with his request.  That said, I think your marriage is over. He can't get over your cheating - he's trying to make it right by cheating himself, but that's not how relationships work.   Divorce now."

If it was fine for you to have an affair and expect your marriage to weather your selfishness, why wouldn't it be okay for him to assume the same?  Reconciliation is a gift the innocent spouse gives to the cheater (that's you, the cheater), so really you owe him pretty majorly.  At least he is taking to you about it, to be honest he should've just gone out and had an affair and then told you after fully expecting forgiveness - that would make you square, Even Steven."

How do you close that chapter and feel even and on track again? well, nobody knows.   For some people, it is the 180º, that is, independence and emotional distance, and doing the kind of things that instill dread to the cheating partner. For other people, it may be a hall pass. And most times, things can't be fixed.  So, of course you are feeling emotional about this and it feels wrong. There is a component of retribution in asking for a hall pass, he wants you to feel the same he has been feeling about this, and if you are not willing, then you are not making a good argument for him to work it out.  What you have to get out of this is that you had an affair, you are not in a position to negotiate out of this. You give him a hall pass and you stand a chance that he forgives you and you renew your broken vows, or you hire a lawyer."

Your husband has obviously not gotten over it. You need to figure out if he's curious about other people or just trying to hurt you back. If it's the first one, maybe you should start reading about how to have a healthy open marriage. I think couples therapy could really benefit you guys though. Obviously you were not happy so you cheated. You need to evaluate why you had sex with someone else, and why he wants to too."

relationship_advice,3dhou5,jons_throwaway,0,Mon Jul 20 10:43:43 2015 UTC,"Well he didn't forgive you. And he's using it against you. Not to mention how would you know if he did it a second time, with the same person or someone else. If he's up 2 -1 is that totally unacceptable? You don't have much ground to stand on.   But if he truly did forgive you, he wouldn't want to do this to you. He's still angry at you, which is fine, but he can't drag you down just because you drug him down. If this is his standpoint, it's not healthy. You should be with someone that accepts your mistakes, rather than retaliating and wanting to hurt you in the same way.   I like @mainegreen's response about the Jeep. Communicate to your husband that you can't accept the cheating but you can accept him getting that new computer or new phone once a year, and/or taking that extra vacation, or buying him a boat or two jet skis. Or that Mercedez Benz he's always wanted. Or season tickets to his favorite team. Good seats too. I know it shouldn't come to that, but it's all about compromise. I don't think he wants to be in this situation, but if you're happy and he's not, he sees you and resents you. His forgiving was a lot harder than your begging for forgiveness. But he hasn't truly forgiven you yet. His saying he was may have been the attempt to get things on track but it's going to be a work in progress.   You need to communicate a compromise. And communicate you want to make it up to him but you can't agree to him sleeping with someone else. And you want to work past this, instead of accepting to be hurt as well. Because it doesn't move things forward. But you want to know if there's any chance of progress or if whenever he's upset if you'll be in this same situation once a year. I understand it's difficult, but you shouldn't have to serve a life sentence because of one mistake. It wouldn't be worth the relationship if you have to go down this road in the next year of 20 years.   He has every right to feel he deserves that and you should agree to his emotions and feelings but try and compromise. I'd say a leased Benz or Audi would sway him back to normalcy. And you just have to put up with an expensive car. But there must be no jokes about how he got it. This is all pending your financial stance. Not the best idea as it may be just as unhealthy but it's a way to work around his feelings now. But then again he could use the car to pick up trashy chicks."

Counseling immediately to discuss the fallout.  What we tell children is that two wrong don't make it right. You screw someone and then he screws someone doesn't make it any better. What he's doing is self destructive and is probably more to do with hurting you back if nothing else.  You have to go see someone if you want to change the course of your relationship.   You aren't a terrible person. You made a bad choice but hopefully he won't make a bad one too based on your mistakes.

relationship_advice,3dhou5,KnowbodyYouKnow,-4,Thu Jul 16 16:09:52 2015 UTC,I think cheated relationships can be salvaged but it's rare and in my opinion you both need to have atleast a 2 year break invoking a new relationship with new people and if you get back together after that maybe it can be salvaged.
relationship_advice,3dhou5,Pm_me_boooobs,-4,Thu Jul 16 12:20:55 2015 UTC,"Ok sorry I guess I should clairify some more. While I absolutely make no excuses for what I did and I take all blame, you had to be living in my situation to understand why I did what I did. My husband was severely depressed and I had asked him for multiple years to get help even offered to go to counseling with him and he refused. I felt like he didn't care anymore about me or life in general. Before I let anything go to to any level with the person I cheated with, I begged my husband to ""date"" me, to show any attention to basically care again and he literally laughed in my face. That doesn't mean what I did was right by any means but it wasn't as if I never voiced what I was feeling. It took my husband finding out to get him the help he needed and he was diagnosed with PTSD and long term depression. He's now on medication and counseling and it has helped a lot. I understand where he is coming from when he thinks because I did it he should be able to have a one night stand. BUT I do go back to the ""two wrongs don't make a right"" saying. I just am having a hard time not feeling upset about it. I know everyone is saying it should be over but we are committed to working this out. We have been together for 11 years and while yes I made a HUGE mistake, we don't want to throw those years away. Thanks everyone for responding."
relationship_advice,3dhou5,jons_throwaway,8,Thu Jul 16 16:17:53 2015 UTC,Still not a valid excuse.  All you did right there is try to shift the blame. It's sad and pathetic.  Edit. Should have just left.
relationship_advice,3dhou5,Meatros,5,Thu Jul 16 16:41:02 2015 UTC,"My husband was severely depressed and I had asked him for multiple years to get help even offered to go to counseling with him and he refused.    I'm not sure how this factors into it - did you think you were helping his depression by cheating on him?   Before I let anything go to to any level with the person I cheated with, I begged my husband to ""date"" me, to show any attention to basically care again and he literally laughed in my face.    Did you actually tell him that it got so bad you were thinking of cheating on him?  For one thing, this is a jump - you were just talking about how your husband was severely depressed, now it's about getting attention for yourself? Was it ever about him and his depression in the first place or is that just an excuse?   That doesn't mean what I did was right by any means but it wasn't as if I never voiced what I was feeling.    So you did or didn't tell him it was so bad you were thinking of cheating? Because if you didn't, then you can't honestly say you voiced what you were feeling.   It took my husband finding out to get him the help he needed and he was diagnosed with PTSD and long term depression.   Oh, I see, so you are a hero now? I don't suppose just telling him you were thinking of cheating would have had the same results?   I understand where he is coming from when he thinks because I did it he should be able to have a one night stand. BUT I do go back to the ""two wrongs don't make a right""    Actually him having a one night stand is substantially different then what you did. You had an affair, a whole other relationship. If he has a ONS, it's not a one on one thing - it's one wrong on his behalf and a shit load of wrongs on your behalf.  Be grateful he's only saying he's going to have a ONS instead of a prolonged affair.  Crap, you are practically getting a deal on that. All he wants is sex with another person - once. How many times did you screw your affair partner?  You might want to take him up on that.   We have been together for 11 years and while yes I made a HUGE mistake, we don't want to throw those years away.   Honestly I still think you are all about yourself here. You started the affair because you wanted more attention. When he found out you probably blamed the affair on him because of how he was treating you."

relationship_advice,3di6tt,cfsdgf1,3,Thu Jul 16 13:55:32 2015 UTC,"One sided relationships are not worth it. I'm going to give you some advice from too many years of experience being in one sided relationships and hope it helps.   Do not sacrifice your well being to be in an unhealthy relationship. You both are very young and have a TON of learning to do on how to be in a relationship.   One of the best things that you could do for both of you is to break up with him. What a breakup does is it will liberate you of the obligation and stress of what you're dealing with and allow you to grow. What it will do for him is give him a reason to get his shit together and do the same.   What will come from that is immense growth because its not an easy thing to do. So at the end of the tunnel you may find yourselves in better shape after talking again when the dust settles, or you may find yourself wanting something else (and him the same).   It's very important to give yourself opportunities to grow on your own. Being in an unhealthy relationship will do the exact opposite."
relationship_advice,3di6tt,kwnull,2,Thu Jul 16 14:56:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice. I really care about him, so this is hard for me to hear. Honestly, I'm really attached to this relationship despite the pain it's been bringing me recently.  Still, I messaged him today saying that I wanted to have a talk tomorrow, so now I am thinking about how to handle that talk.  When I broke up with my last serious boyfriend, I kind of blindsided him. I tend to avoid conflict, so from his point of view it looked like I dumped him out of the blue for unclear reasons, which it made it hard for him to move on and grow as a person afterwards. We did manage to stay friends (and I'm glad we did) but we had a very rocky friendship for a year.  If I do break up with my boyfriend now I want to make sure that I do it properly this time, and make all my thoughts and feelings abundantly clear to him before making my final decision. I think that given that we've never really had a serious conflict as a couple before, the reasonable thing to do is to give him an opportunity to respond. He happily surprises me sometimes, and I'm definitely hoping that he will surprise me tomorrow by responding to this situation with a high level of emotional maturity.  I'm still not totally sure what I should actually try to say. What I'm tempted to say is something structured along the lines of, ""I have been realising recently that I have certain expectations from a relationship. These are my expectations. These are the areas in which this relationship isn't meeting those expectations. Either something has to change, or we are going to have to end this quite soon."" My fear is that it will sound too much like an ultimatum, and that it will doom things for sure.  I'd really appreciate some input. Thanks again."
relationship_advice,3di6tt,kwnull,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:30:40 2015 UTC,"I think if you say those things but you ask him what he thinks first before giving your opinion that it'll be more effective and confirming on how you feel.   So at least get his perspective first before giving yours because his perspective might bring confirmation in a negative way or a positive way for you.   But yeah, saying something like, ""Ideally this is what I think is going to work for me and if that doesn't work for you then I think we need to end the relationship so that we can both grow and then find what we're looking for."""

Your relationship with him isn't going to go anywhere anymore.   You need to leave him and focus on your relationship with yourself.

relationship_advice,3dht6e,Gizmo-Duck,2,Thu Jul 16 18:09:57 2015 UTC,"wow. there has got to be a billion books about this, but let me just pull out what is in my had now.   most women like it when the man has a plan. if you see her every day and just ""hang out"" it will seem like you have nothing else going on in your life. that's boring, unhealthy, and not very attractive.   Instead of ""wanna hang out?"" plan something. ""Let's go for a walk in the park."" ""I wanted to see the movie, would you like to come with me?"" ""Let's go to my favorite restaurant! I really hope you like it.""  make decisions but don't be controlling. If you ask her what she wants to do/where she wants to eat/what she wants to see/etc. and she says ""I don't know/care"" then jump in with an answer. don't worry if she will hate the answer. she probably won't, but if she does she will tell you and you will have learned something about her. Always good! Nothing is attractive about a guy who is afraid to make a decision. Same with a guy who just doesn't care about anything.   Frequency of your dates really depends on the situation... Just starting out, I'd say keep it to twice a week. As I said before, you don't want to make it seem like you have nothing else going on in your life. That can increase as you get to know each other better and start integrating each other into the other aspects of your lives.   One last thought. Listen to her! Pay attention to what she says.   That's all I got right now.   Also, don't smoke, drink too much, or use bad language. Until she does (not the smoking part, never do that)."

Why settle for anything less?  You can't force someone to love you.  She's 15, she wants her freedom and that's understandable at her age.    Ask her if she wants to continue the relationship or just part as friends.  If she chooses friendship, take the time to find happiness on your own again.  What you are feeling now, this ""I can't find this with anyone else"" will pass.  You will find it again but it will be 1000 times more amazing when that person feels the same for you and it's not just one sided."

The taker is usually the one who takes all the love and then takes you for granted after a while.  Have you tried talking to her about how you feel on the ex issue? One thing that could help is that you two sit down and have a talk. Communication is key in a relationship, and hopefully she is mature enough to identify your worries.  But then again she's only 15. You may be viewing this relationship seriously but she may just be treating this as a fling. She could well be using the ex to taunt/ make you jealous. I don't know you nor her to come to a concrete judgement, but like how you pointed out that she takes you for granted and basically steps all over you...  If she doesn't respect your wishes or refuses to talk it out, then she really wouldn't be your ideal partner. Anyone can be so sweet and angelic in the early days. Don't let it blind you, OP."
relationship_advice,3dgyzr,Jeremyiswin,9,Thu Jul 16 04:51:57 2015 UTC,"This resonates with me all to well. 30/f, recovering alcoholic. I, too, would steal money out of my live-in BF's wallet to feed my addiction.  I was delusional enough to think that he didn't notice that nor the bottles I had hidden around the house.  It was a dark, dark time, and I have since made my amends and we are still together,  expecting our first child (any day now!!).   The thing is, she won't see the situation clearly until she hits her ""bottom"" and decides she has had enough.  There is not much that you can do, sadly. Al-Anon helps with this. If I were in your shoes,  I would approach her family about staging an intervention (something sober me wishes my family would have done), and give her an ultimatum; get help or get out immediately. If you're set on wanting her out, still go the intervention route, and hope family will take her in.   Let the chips fall where they may. Good luck...it's an awful situation to be in."

relationship_advice,3dgyzr,argos913,5,Thu Jul 16 05:01:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with this other poster. Her family and friends, whoever you trust, should get involved. Which means you need to get them involved, because I doubt she will. I don't want to give you any more advice, because I've never been in a similar situation, nor do I have experience with alcoholics. Nor do I know your situation the way you do. But it sounds like you feel alone with the problem, and that I'd advise you to change."
relationship_advice,3dgyzr,flavorsandwich,3,Thu Jul 16 05:21:48 2015 UTC,"So, the thing is, you are not helping her by letting her stay past her welcome.  Even if by staying there she is delaying her own consequences, it is not helping her to get sober, which is after all the thing that she really needs to do.  You cannot help her with that at all, I am afraid.  And while having a roof and someone to steal from may be delaying consequences for her, it is not solving her problems.    That said, coming from a long line of alcoholics, I do know how hard it is sometimes to make these kinds of choices because a part of you feels responsible for what happens once you turn your back on an alcoholic.  You think, ""if I say no and refuse to give them this money, what will they do?  What if they end up hurt or dead or in jail?""  This exact reason is why there are so many enablers in the world.  At the end of the day, turning your back is the right thing to do, in my opinion, because she is harming you while not helping herself.  Basically, no good is coming from her being there other than keeping you from feeling guilty.  I mean, are you going to let her stay forever?  Because this problem does not go away - in fact it only gets worse.  So the solution is to find her some alternatives so that you do not have to feel guilty anyway!  Find her: a treatment facility, half-way house, willing family member, shelter or some other situation like that.  It does not have to cost money.  Sit her down, tell her she can't stay, and tell her that you have found the following places that are free for her to go to.  Then ask her which one she wants to go to and take her there.  If she will not make a choice, then you take her to the one you want to take her to and what she does from there is up to her. (or put her in a paid-for cab, whatever gets it done.)  EDIT:  But prepare yourself for screaming, crying, begging and promises that she will quit all of which you must ignore and stay the course regardless."
relationship_advice,3dgyzr,flavorsandwich,2,Thu Jul 16 05:25:49 2015 UTC,"What if they end up hurt or dead or in jail?""   That is a lot of it.

I know that this is not my responsibility, but I also know I would feel responsible for it. Stupid brain making me feel things."
relationship_advice,3dgyzr,MsAnthropic,2,Thu Jul 16 14:57:39 2015 UTC,"I know.  I have a sister that has been pulling shit for 25 years.  TWENTY FIVE.  So I know those feels.  All you can do is provide her with an alternative or two and that's more than enough.  You did not cause this problem for her and you cannot fix it.  She has some rough times ahead, but just like with my sister, she is choosing it.  You have to take care of you.  Besides, enabling a drunk only helps them stay drunk.  Consequences are the only thing that ever make someone want to get sober.  Sometimes the consequences are big, but it's not your fault.  You can accept that this is your life for next couple of decades or you can just internalize the message now and skip the twenty years.  Either way, you will end up here.    One other suggestion if you aren't ready to cut her off - go to an Al-Anon meeting.  They are extremely easy to attend and you do not have to talk.  But other people will and you can hear them talk about the addicts in their lives and sometimes that is enough to see what you need to see about your own relationship.  Also, it is entirely free.  But there may be hand-holding at the end of the meeting.  cringe  Edit:  And yes, she will get black out drunk and do some dumb shit.  It's a guarantee, because that's how she copes with everything, right?  But honestly, what most drunks do is pair up with other drunks and be drunk in teams.  It's a shitty life, but they choose it because to them it's better than being sober.  Most of them work it out (surviving, that is), but it's best not to see how they do it."
relationship_advice,3dgyzr,doodlebop12486,2,Thu Jul 16 15:55:44 2015 UTC,"You can sit her down and tell her that you're breaking up with her and she has X days to move out.  You will no longer be covering her costs.  I think this is a perfect time for an ultimatum if you're interesting in salvaging the relationship. You can say that unless she quits drinking and joins AA by Y date, you will not change your mind.  FWIW, I'd lock up all my valuables and change all passwords before doing this.  Take her off any joint cards/accounts/etc.   Do I just cut ties and let her fend for her self?    Yes.  You tell her that you're no longer paying for all the non-necessities for her.  She wants fast food?  Tough luck, there's food in the fridge.  She wants some new clothes?  Tough luck, she needs to buy her own stuff.   Should I give her longer time frame to move out?    Look up tenancy laws for your area.  You probably have to give her 30 days to move out.   What if she cannot make arrangements and will be basically homeless?   It's an awful thing, but it's not your problem.  Other posters have covered how you need to not take up this burden on her behalf."

The saying is true, sometimes people just need to hit rock bottom before they can make the changes they need to make."
relationship_advice,3dgyzr,tidderor,2,Thu Jul 16 15:26:32 2015 UTC,"Many members of my family are alcoholics, even my mom who recently passed away from alcohol related sicknesses. Once I started learning about alcoholism and how to treat someone who is addicted in your life, the #1 lesson I learned is that you can't take care of someone in that position, they need to take care of themselves. When you help them to the point that you're doing, it just makes it easier for them to keep drinking. It sounds really harsh, but the best thing to do is to tell them you don't want to be with them while they're drinking, but that you'll be here for them when they decide to stop. Then do not let them live with you, buy them things, pay their bills or anything else. She needs to want to stop drinking, and as long as she has someone taking care of her she has no reason to.  Separate from her, if her family has disowned her due to alcoholism it'll just give her one more reason to get straight."
relationship_advice,3dgyzr,darkhorse3,2,Thu Jul 16 15:59:09 2015 UTC,"I knew someone in a similar situation with an economically dependent partner that handled this in a way I thought was very smart.    He told her that he was very concerned about their relationship problems and hadn't decided what to do yet, but that what he did know was that he was troubled by how much her financial dependency was weighing on him as he was processing this.  And that the one thing he was sure of was that if there was any chance of them staying together, it could not be because of a sense of guilt or obligation.  He said whether they stayed together or not, he needed to know that she would be OK and able to manage her own affairs if the relationship did need to come to an end.  So he told her that if she had any desire to stay together, she had a couple of days to come up with a firm plan as to how she would manage things if they were to break up.  And she did exactly that.  And once that roadmap was in place, he felt free to break it off.  It helped her out as much as it did him, because she had a roadmap in place for what to do rather than having to try to sort it out herself after the fact."

But you can surely act upon it and hope she just leaves.   She stole from you, she doesn't contribute to rent, food, etc. Truth is, there is never a good time to break up with someone. You can't wait around for her to change and to wean herself out of the relationship or apartment.   Part of it you should put yourself in her shoes. She doesn't have much saved. She is addicted. She's desperate. You may want to think of communicating that you want to break up. And it's best she start paying you half of the rent/bills in the meantime as she's looking for a place.

You have boundaries and he can't respect them.  That's on him, not you.  Knowing that he doesn't respect these boundaries, what are you willing to do with that information?  Is it a deal breaker?  You definitely owe it to your child to show them what a healthy and happy relationship looks like.  Settling for what your husband is dishing out right now, isn't that.

You have a right to feel any way you feel. You don't have the right to take it out on him or treat him like he was the bad guy, because he wasn't. That doesn't mean your hurt isn't real or that you shouldn't feel your feelings.   stop thinking that they'll break up at some point and then I can swoop in   You don't want to swoop in. You don't want this guy. He doesn't want you. You want a guy who's actually in the same place you are. Cut off contact, at least for the time being. You can say he didn't do anything wrong, but that you just can't handle it right now and you need to not be in contact for your own mental health."
relationship_advice,3dhkb4,astrolic,5,Thu Jul 16 09:29:49 2015 UTC,"No, 25 isn't too old to be single.   If you don't see a future with this girl, end it. Breakups are hard. Being lonely is hard. But you eventually move on. That temporary pain is far more ideal than being in a relationship that you don't want to be in."
relationship_advice,3dhkb4,StopStalkingMeB,2,Thu Jul 16 09:42:39 2015 UTC,"It's never too old to be single. You owe it to yourself to be happy. It's okay to be selfish. But dragging out a relationship because you're afraid of loneliness is rather silly.   You need to make new friends. Why do you work in two different countries? Can you move overseas to get a fresh start? People are still friends whether you see them once a week or once a year. With technology you can still text and Skype with friends. Else, are they really your friends?  You aren't happy in this relationship, but being in this permanently restricts you from meeting someone else, having one night stands, meeting other girls and taking it to the next level.   25 is so young. Sure I have many friends that have bought a house, dog, children, but they are, from what I see, a slave to their own belongings. They now have to mow the grass get someone to watch the dog, they can't just hop on a flight and go places for the weekend.   The break up sound inevitable. being single will completely suck the first week. But get on online dating sites or tinder. Ask out or talk to the girls at the coffee shop or hang out with a work buddy and go to a sporting event. Something. Stay buys. Most importantly have goals, short term and long. Change is mostly good. The best decisions in life are always the hardest. Sometimes people need to be single and watch an entire series on Netflix and to eat mac n cheese 5 nights in a row. And go on a few horrible dates. I promise you there are girls out there that meet all of your wants and needs in a woman or relationship.   Maybe you could move to France permanently and use that as an excuse. Maybe she'd visit after a few months of being away and you can decide before she flies over. May get messy with money but still. Or you can use it as an excuse. Not the best advice of course."

Politely tell the girlfriend that you need to leave the relationship to do some soul searching. It'll be sad and you'll cry, but like... whatever. Then go drink a bottle of bordeaux while sitting along the Seine with a petite French babe who smokes.   How much better does that sound compared to this ""I want kids but not with her"" angst you're into? The way you describe it, it feels like you're trapped in a really bad acid trip.

There is never a good time to break up with someone. If you aren't going to see her for a long time, it's best to do it now. Instead of making her wait even longer and counting down the days and hours until you see each other. And you can always mention you can meet up if she'd want to, or to give each other belongs back.

Your value as a human being really is not based on how many people you have kissed. And your self-worth should not be based on this either.  It will happen, and it will feel right. And it will be wonderful. I still think back on my first kiss from time to time. The nice part about being older is getting to really remember it.  Having said all that, I know that, at 18 it feels like everything revolves around girls and relationships, and that's not bad. But there's just nothing you can do. Real relationships are never forced, and always just kind of happen.  Sorry I can't give you those ""surprising three steps that will make every woman obsess over you,"" but (spoiler alert) they don't exist.  You sound like a fine person to me. Just keep being the finest you can be, and when your first kiss happens, it'll be with a girl who was totally worth it!"

relationship_advice,3dh1fl,Claclink,2,Thu Jul 16 21:51:36 2015 UTC,"I've been in basically the same boat as you. I'm 18 now, and didn't get my first kiss until the last half of me being 17, only having been on single dates with 2 other girls beforehand who it just didn't click with. Honestly, it's not a big deal. In my case things didn't work out with other girls because I knew what I was looking for (to a certain degree) and I knew when things weren't right. I never had a girlfriend until my first kiss who I have been with for the better part of 9 months now, and we're just perfect for each other.  While that seems braggy, what I'm trying to say is that the number of girls you date has nothing to do with whether or not you will eventually find a good relationship. You not just being in a relationship with any girl actually means you are more likely to find it. Having been in your position, just stick it out man. I promise there's someone out there who things will just work with, whether that be in a few months or years. Don't make your happiness depend on it, try to enjoy all the other little things about life until you find that person.  Tl;dr: Not dating now isn't the worst thing, find happiness in other things until you find a relationship."

relationship_advice,3dgv7x,dont_want_2_offend,35,Thu Jul 16 04:14:15 2015 UTC,"She, however, feels they are wrong and so will not seek treatment.   This would, and should, be a deal breaker. She is allowing her problems to affect her relationship and you. It even sounds like she may be using this issue she has as an excuse to manipulate you into doing what she wants.   Here's the thing. She is making the choice to refuse treatment. That makes her look like the asshole who should be ashamed, not you. You need to do what is best for you because clearly she only has herself in mind.   If you want to make one last attempt, I suggest taking a day or two to write out every issue this ""illness"" is causing and that you are giving her the ultimatum to seek help or lose you. Either way, you need to stop being a doormat for her illness, real or not."
relationship_advice,3dgv7x,StopStalkingMeB,10,Thu Jul 16 04:33:01 2015 UTC,"You don't have to question her about whether her illness is real, you have to question her about why she demonstrates so little care for herself and your relationship by not seeking treatment for a life-threatening illness."

relationship_advice,3dgv7x,giantsandlions,2,Fri Jul 17 01:00:54 2015 UTC,"Coming from someone who has epilepsy, it's very easy to get completely depressed about your condition. I've had epilepsy for over 10 years and it's still not under control. I think it's possible that her disability may be affecting her mental stability, not the other way around. I definitely think she needs your support, but not to the extent where you drop everything for her. In emergencies okay, but the best way to live with disability is to conquer it as much as possible. Maybe ask her what she thinks would make her happier and enjoy life more? And tell her to find an epilepsy specialist. I just got mine last year and he has legitimately changed my life."
relationship_advice,3dgv7x,tdring16,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:15:03 2015 UTC,So I think her mindset is wrong buy I don't think it is really her fault Depending on when and for how long she was in the relationship she might think she can take care of herself because she never has (parents or abusive partner always did)  The other possibility is that she has given up and thinks there is no hope for improvement for her disability which is even scarier (it took a 6 month stint of depression for me to get over this with my cerebral palsy)  No matter what you need to sit her down and talk to her about it   If you dislike the result the relationship will fail eventually
relationship_advice,3dgv7x,xxramboamboxx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:48:21 2015 UTC,"Well and what do you mean a condition similar to epilepsy? Does she have seizures? And what type? And what is she refusing treatment for? The epilepsy or the issues she had in her last relationship? If it's her seizures then that is super dangerous. Not having some sort of treatment can be really damaging not only to her brain, but also to her body. I know I have fallen and hurt my shoulders and damaged my face and had to get stitches and I'm on medication. On the flip side, one of my greatest fears is that someone would not accept me because I have a seizure disorder. That they would view it as a large burden. Yes we want to be respected as a ""normal"" person and not just seen as a disability but understand there are things you don't go through. Ways you could never be affected. Of course this is life for me, and I don't know anything about your gf. I've always had a job even after I came out of an abusive relationship."

Don't even bother listing the reasons. Just say something along the lines of ""I'm sorry but I'm just not interested in doing this any longer and need to end it.""  After that, move on. She won't be able to start to accept it and get over you if you half step it down out of fear off hurting her. You can't avoid hurting someone in breakup. It's just how it goes.

But when you do break things off, don't bring up the reasons as you mentioned, just say you aren't feeling it anymore and don't love her anymore. Not living - isn't a list of things one can change. It's the experience really.   There's never a good time to do it. Many people say you should do it in person blah blah, but I've done it over the phone and through Skype and it goes the same way to be honest. You can still see each other to give stuff back and/or meet up for coffee or lunch or just talk when you see each other. Nobody thinks clearly while breaking up or while being broken up with.   There are dating ""rules"" that society created but comparing a phone call to in person, regarding a break-up, is rather silly. Not to mention the way she acts during things, and behaves when things don't go her way, the odds are she's going to cut your nuts off.   However you decide to do it, respect her craziness to a certain extent. Let her yell, cry scream, just stay calm. Don't be surprised when she acts that way. Be slow to respond for every question. Give yourself time. Don't list out everything that you found wrong with her. You're not in love with her anymore, and can't explain it. But don't kick her anymore while she's down.   The sooner you do it, the better. Breakups are never easy. Don't play into her craziness."

Try not to let it become a discussion where emotions run high.  This will just make you feel worse and she could end up convincing you to give it another try.  She'll ask why, and you can tell her that you love her, but you're just not happy and you don't think the two of you are compatible anymore.  Don't let it go any further than that though.

relationship_advice,3dj3si,Aggie219,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:29:07 2015 UTC,"There are two kinds of pain that come from a break up.  And one of those I think you can do a lot about.   One is the pain of withdrawal - you lose the positive experiences of sharing time with that person.  That one you can't do anything about.  She just has to go through it and get used to being without you.  The second is the pain that comes from the rejection itself.  It's a blow to the ego, and that kind of pain can be far worse than the pain of withdrawal.  And this is where I think you can make a big difference.  The breakups where you come away feeling like you got dumped because your ex sized you up as unworthy are much worse than those where you don't have those issues.  There's something so awful about thinking that a person you were intimate with has decided that you're unattractive, annoying, off-putting, or whatever else you fear might be going on.    So, how do you get out of this with the least amount of damage to her ego possible? How can you express this decision in a way that doesn't convey the message of ""I've decided you're not worthy of me?""  Think carefully about that as you make your breakup plan.  You know her best and should come up with words that have truth behind them and that you can say sincerely.  But here are some suggestions that might help you frame the conversation.    Begin the conversation by telling her all the things that you think are wonderful.  Be specific, give details, and make it sincere.  Then, segue with something like ""And that's why it's been so difficult for me to accept that as wonderful as you are, the two of us are not meant to be together.""    You then need to offer her some context as to why you aren't meant to be together (otherwise she'll just feel confused), but in a way that isn't critical and doesn't place blame on her.  So, she's not ""emotionally unstable,"" but the two of you just have ""drastically different communication styles"" or ""fundamentally different ways that we view life and process emotions.""  She's not ""manipulative and over-reactive"" by jumping down your throat for working late, the two of you have ""different expectations of what it means to be a good partner to one another.""   Spin everything in the direction of she's great but you're just different people and you've decided that the differences are significant enough that you're not the right fit for each other.    Be prepared for her to try to get you to go back on your decision.  Stay firm but kind and know what you're going to say.  Maybe you say that because she's so wonderful, you struggled long and hard with it but after countless hours of soul-searching you've reached a point of certainty that this is not only the right thing to do, but actually the most loving thing to do as well.  You know in your heart that this is right for the both of you.  She deserves someone that connects with her in just the right way, and that you wish you were that guy, but you just aren't.  And you love her too much to let her spend years with the wrong person.  Tell her you have no doubt she'll find that person and that he'll be one very lucky guy.  No matter what you do, she almost certainly won't like your decision, and she'll be hurt.  But maybe she won't be feeling like you rejected her because you've determined her to be unworthy, undesirable, etc.  If you can manage to end this without her feeling like it's a reflection on her worthiness as a partner, you'll definitely minimize the pain she goes through.   Best of luck and it's kind of you to care so much about protecting her feelings."

I end up paying less because housing in the bay area, California is ridiculously expensive. Any money that's left over goes into a joint savings account. We plan to dump that money into my loans around tax time.  We pay extra on my loan every month. Instead of the minimum payment of $350/month, I pay $1000/month. We should have my loan paid off in about 5 years. We'll then start saving for a house.  We are still learning how to budget but overall we're doing well. I think it helps that we agreed that any money we have is our money, not my money and his money."
relationship_advice,3de663,kbiering,2,Wed Jul 15 18:25:06 2015 UTC,"Seems like you guys are doing everything right, but I might suggest you think about taking a little bit of that money you are throwing at your loans right now and starting to save it for your house down-payment.   Renting is a total waste of money, and the longer you spend paying rent the longer it will take you to build up enough of a nest egg to put down a down-payment. Mortgage payments are a lot better because every payment you are either building equity, or getting to deduct the interest off your income taxes.   Just a suggestion, but if you took $250 of that $1000 you are throwing at your loans and put it into a down-payment fund, in 7 years you would have $21,000 towards a downpayment. Not a ton, but it should help you get into a house sooner, instead of waiting to totally pay off your loan and start then."

relationship_advice,3de663,shinsmax12,7,Thu Jul 16 14:23:41 2015 UTC,"especially with her spending habits (sometimes not very good)   I would worry about this more than the 80k debt (which isn't that much for a graduate degree).  If her financial responsibility is poor, that could drag down a lot more than her ability to repay her student loans.  Since you've been together 3 years, this is a fair topic for conversation.  You have a few options to consider:  1)  You devise a financial system that treats her student loan debt as a separate obligation that she pays on top of the joint expenses.  Let's say you jointly have $5,000 in expenses per month and her monthly loan repayment is $600.  She would be responsible for both $2,500 and $600 for a total of $3,100, while you would be responsible for $2,500.  She would have to take a job that accounts for at least that much expense -- be it the museum or otherwise.  Sometimes, when people go to graduate school, they don't factor in that it will pigeon hole them into a certain earning requirement later on.  This is a good time to bring that up.  2)  Relax about the debt and her starting salary and take a longer view of things.  Ask her what her earning potential is 5 or 10 years down the road at this museum or whether she anticipates being able to parlay the museum job into something greater.  What is her career plan and what is her earning potential long term?  3)  Decide that disposable income isn't the end all be all and that as long as she can get her spending under control, you can make enough money to live a comfortable life with enough savings to take a nice trip now and then or buy a new toy now and then.  4)  Consider what YOU are doing for a career and maybe YOU have to step up your game to have everything you want (this woman included).  Committed relationships and marriages are as much business partnerships as they are loving relationships and anyone who tells you otherwise is naive.  You're right to consider the impact this will have on you, but no one can tell you what to do (I'm just laying out some general directions/considerations).  Lastly, if the depression issue is really the big topic, then all you can do is decide if her trying to get help is enough of an effort to make this relationship worth it to you.  Perhaps the debt issue is you looking for a more ""palatable"" reason to exit.  Good luck sorting through your thoughts!"

Wow, thanks for those comments, they really hit home. I think we will get through the moving in, we just see things financially different.  For example: She is discussing what furniture to buy, how to decorate the house, etc.. while I am thinking that we don't need anything since we both already have furniture! But I understand where she is coming from. We will buy a new couch and stuff, but not go crazy.  The long term idea is also important - good point. I am not sure, although the prospects don't seem to pay very well. Then again, as an artist, she isn't really shooting to become rich (I think)."

I know what you mean.  I'm frugal and my SO always has another idea of how to make the house nicer.  It's a never ending balance and you will have to compromise from time to time.  But, one day you will look around at the walls full of color and the furnished home and think, ""This is a nice play to live, she did a great job"" and it will be worth it.  You can't live at either extreme and hopefully you two balance each other out.   I am not sure, although the prospects don't seem to pay very well. Then again, as an artist, she isn't really shooting to become rich (I think).   Don't guess.  Don't think.  Ask her.  If she doesn't have a plan, then she needs to give it some serious thought.  The goal is to work through issues, but ""I don't know"" isn't a fair answer.  ""I need some time to think about it"" might be a fair answer for today or tomorrow, but eventually she needs to have a plan -- particularly if marriage and kids are part of the plan.  Don't feel guilty about asking the tough questions.  But, I'm assuming you have an answer if she asks the same ones in return.  Part of my initial reply was harping on that point.  You can ask her to change certain things, but you can't lose sight of the fact that there's likely plenty you could change to improve things, too."

relationship_advice,3de663,plantstand,2,Thu Jul 16 01:04:47 2015 UTC,"It's not just the last point /u/Arcades made that's great.  Reading over your comments, I get the sense that you are trying to be receptive to feedback while still wanting to look at your girlfriend while wearing rose-tinted glasses and not wanting to push her too hard. But here's the thing: If you guys can't get aligned on how to think about these important issues now, you surely won't be able to do so after marriage and kids. You need to make sure she has the right attitude to be part of the crew and not part of the cargo on the ship that is your relationship, or you will live to regret it.  For example: If the museum job doesn't work out, could she see herself letting you be the sole provider? Could you see yourself providing for her, or would you want to see her working a minimum wage job if need be while she hustles to land something better? If the thought of having this discussion with her now makes you squirm, that's a big red flag right there. Don't ignore it."
relationship_advice,3de663,Meatros,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:29:25 2015 UTC,"Um, I think you need to have some serious talks now. It doesn't sound like she has the money to put towards designer furnishings. Or even anything above thrift store-grade. And you might not want to. Are furnishings more important than other financial goals?        And you should have shared financial goals. If kids are part of them, that changes the picture too."

How much should I let this affect my outlook on our relationship? Right now, it has me pretty down since I feel like I will be pulling the financial weight for us for a long time to come.   It depends on what you two can afford. If paying back her debt (which she should do as soon as possible) consumes her entire paycheck and you can float the both of you and you are okay with this, then go for it.   If it's going to be a struggle, then you need to really think about it.   especially with her spending habits (sometimes not very good)   What does this mean? Is she incurring more debt? Or does she spend and not have money for additional entertainment?   Am I being a douche by letting this affect my decisions with her?   No, this could effect the rest of your life."

I'm a graphic designer who went to an art school and I make a really good salary and own my own business. Art doesn't always mean broke. She just has to be smart about it. The spending habits are another story though.
relationship_advice,3de663,OneGirlArmy,3,Wed Jul 15 21:37:31 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I agree with you - you can make good money. Shoot, even if it's a passion degree, she could do something with it to make a lot of money. I ask because I've seen A LOT of people (anecdotal, yes) with BA/MA in the arts who aren't really planning to do anything with it.  Shit, one friend of mine has a Photography degree, he takes beautiful pictures, and i'm sure he could get a job, that's how talented he is.  I was talking with him, I asked him why he (at 35) worked part time at a retail store. He said that he initially got a job that was in his degree field but felt like he was being used/giving up his passion/making it ""work""...."
relationship_advice,3de663,Meatros,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:23:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thats the thing. Many artists think they are ""selling themselves"" once they get to work. Isn't that the point though? You sell your skills. It's so idealistic to just think you're going to take pretty pictures and make a living without being under the constraints of a company or brand. If you can't adapt to conditions, you aren't as talented as you think you are. It's possible to walk the line between career and passion—it just takes effort to do so."

I'm like, okay, we have these positions here that pay X amount. He won't take them because he's 'burnt out' and he asks for an entry level job that makes that same X amount. I said it doesn't work that way... He's happy living with his parents working part time...   My other friend has a masters in art and uses it to work at a state university. He does his own art on the side and goes to shows and stuff. I wish he had more success with it - he's really talented - but he's making a living with his 'day job' and pursuing is dreams.  I can't (and don't) fault him for that. In my mind, that's what you are supposed to do."

She just paid off her credit cards, so is not incurring more debt, BUT she also isn't really saving anything. I just wish she wouldn't eat out so much, buy sodas everywhere ($2 a pop adds up super fast).   Thanks for the feedback, I have a bit to think about.

You can be very qualified, have the right credentials and degree, and still not find a job (like a museum job) simply because there are far more qualified people than there are positions available.  Say she's in the top 10% of art majors out there. That puts her in competition with 1 million other art majors (making up numbers here). Of that 1 million art majors in the top 10%, 600,000 of them are interested in a job at a museum. Where it becomes tough is, there are only 60,000 museum jobs available. So she may be extremely driven and well qualified, but she still only has a 1/10 chance of finding a job simply because of the numbers involved.  I'm not saying it's hopeless, just that it's hard and you'll both need to be very realistic about it. My solution was to move from fine arts into web design, a profession which has much more job placement and much higher pay. I learned pretty quickly that I enjoyed the design industry far more than I ever enjoyed the fine arts industry, so it worked out well for me. She might be able to do something similar."

You can apply for deferments to get a savings built up, or you could apply for income-based repayment which will not kill your budget with monthly payments. If she's working in some kind of public service (university, possibly a museum depending on what museum) they also have programs that will forgive debt after 10-15 years.

Hubby and I try to cook together so it's not a chore and feels like we get time together. He's the better cook so often I'm cleaning up behind him or prepping things. Regardless, it's kind of a nice routine now. We try to cook extra and at the end we pack it up as lunches. Spmetimes we overeat and won't have lunch so we might have a splurge day but we are getting better at that.   For things like pops or treats do you know what the drive is? Do you guys just like to get out of the office, or is it the actual treat? Buying a six pack of pop, especially on sale is cheaper than a fountain drink, for example. If it's getting away from the desk, maybe take the packed lunch to the park or go for walks.   Managing our eating out etc was a huge money saver for us."

It isn't really unexpected,  depending on the school as well.  I mean if she's going to some backwoods university,  I'd have to wonder why.    That said, the debt is to be expected (within bounds) and shouldn't dissuade you from moving in together.  Once she graduates and begins work,  if she's making the payments on her debt well,  and keeping her own bills together,  you're good to go."

Yes, she will have to pay it back shortly but there are safeguards in play so that she can put off the debt for a little bit while she finds a job that can fit in that loan payment.   If you are that worried about the financial part start with separate bank accounts from the start. Have her contribute her part into a joint account where you guys pay bills and bunch up 'recreation funds' so you can still enjoy your life together.

relationship_advice,3de663,pngnk,5,Wed Jul 15 22:41:39 2015 UTC,"Warning: detailed reply incoming.   I feel like I will be pulling the financial weight for us for a long time to come.    If you do, that's your choice. If she can't pay her own half of the bills while paying down her loan on her own, you are under no obligation to do those things for her.   If we get married in the next few years (possibility) it will become my debt.   Wrong. Unless you live in a country where this is the case. Even in the US in community property states, debt incurred prior to marriage is not considered marital debt.   Am I being a douche by letting this affect my decisions with her?   No. Where money and love overlap, problems/tension will happen. You are right to see the red flags in advance and consider them thoroughly.   Has anyone else been in a similar situation?   Yep. I met my wife my senior year of college, graduated with $20k in debt and we moved in together a year later. We lived very modestly and our bills were split 50/50. She made way more money and didn't have debt so her bank account got fatter and fatter while mine stayed at 0 but I was adamant that she never had to support me. Since she always had more money, she would suggest fun things and I often had to say no since I couldn't afford it. If she wanted to enough, she would make it her treat. She was saving so much of her take home by living cheaply with me that she didn't mind.   She did have to ""support me"" for 3 months when I was unemployed but that never involved paying my bills. I had a tiny emergency fund that I ate through for that. But she did buy me food sometimes so I wouldn't be eating ramen and treated me to nights out so I could leave the house once every 14 days for something other than an interview. I am forever grateful for that. People who expect their significant other to cover their ass are disrespecting both themselves and their partner. (It also just enables them to remain dependent!)  With due diligence and sacrifice I paid off my student loan in 2 years and have remained debt free since. We are married now and due to both of us having proved our financial integrity in the past, had no problem comingling our finances after marriage.  Tl;dr: don't agree to support her financially AT ALL. If you weren't around she would find a way to do it so make her find that way anyway. It will teach her to budget in a way that you being her sugar daddy or parachute can not. If she can manage this, you will never have to worry about the financial side of your potential marriage.  (If you both agreed ahead of time that she would incur this debt and you would support paying it off, that's different. I am working on the assumption you did not agree to this sort of arrangement. Which would be more common in a marriage when one spouse goes back to school for example.)"
relationship_advice,3de663,SilentEcho13,3,Wed Jul 15 19:18:14 2015 UTC,"Would be shocked if you actually became responsible for her debt, since you aren't a cosigner and it's pre-marriage. Even during marriage, a lot of debt isn't shared, although it probably varies by local law.  You are perfectly reasonable setting boundaries for yourself on acceptable financial responsibility etc. It's one of the responsibilities that comes with being an adult, and something that bears consideration when choosing a partner.  You also can keep your finances separate. It's perfectly reasonable to have separate bank accounts, credit cards, etc. As long as she pulls her weight as a roommate (food, rent, etc), the rest is her money, her business. If and when you talk about marriage with her, then you can iron out status of debt repayment yadda yadda, but for now, leave it be until there is actually a problem (e.g. she can't pay rent).   You can always split costs on some stuff or take her out to eat. Just maintain boundaries that make you feel comfortable, and let her worry about anything past rent and utilities."

relationship_advice,3de663,1wf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:01:58 2015 UTC,"You could always maintain separate bank accounts. I don't have a ton of debt, so that wasn't a factor in our decision, but that's what my boyfriend are doing and plan to continue after marriage. I think people are more financially conscious and responsible with separate bank accounts, and it makes gifts and any kind of financial assistance more special and more valued.   Additionally, maintaining separate accounts can help take away the financial tensions many couples go through. If he wants to spend his extra money on frivolous things, he can, because it's his money. I don't feel any anger or worry over his financial decisions, because they do not effect me. That is not to say that they can't effect me, but assuming we are both watching our finances, they shouldn't.   Of course, if you plan to have children, shared finances may be an easier route, but I know several couples who have managed to keep separate bank accounts while having one, shared ""family account"" for bills, food, and things for their kids. I can understand why this would not be everyone's preference, but it's one possible solution."
relationship_advice,3de663,OneGirlArmy,2,Wed Jul 15 23:18:55 2015 UTC,"We plan on separate bank accounts for a while to come, at least until after marriage.   Children - agreed, we join at that point. I like the separate money though."
relationship_advice,3de663,supreme313,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:24:04 2015 UTC,"I think the answer depends on your relationship. Before considering marriage I felt that my boyfriends debt was his debt alone. We would have separate bank accounts and one joint account where we deposit a % of our pay check for bills. However, as my debt decreased and my income increased, I realized I was in a situation to help him pay down his debt. Finances seem to be a major issue in many relationships so you should have a deep conversation about how you both feel about money, what each of you consider suitable payments, suitable savings, and purchasing decisions for the future. If you have stark differences it might be best to not get married."

I'm not a lawyer, but in nearly all states, debt incurred by one person before the marriage does not legally become joint debt after the marriage. Her credit score will potentially affect yours when you get married, but if she is paying her loans on time that shouldn't be too big an issue.  Does she expect you to pay for her student loan debt if you marry her? Talk to her about this, if you haven't already."
relationship_advice,3de663,supreme313,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:43:23 2015 UTC,"What you're asking about is completely budget related. Where as your actual debt amount isn't irrelevant, it's largely simply a question of where your money is going. Setting a budget and a financial plan will let you have your cake and eat it too.   On the subject of her debt, I strongly feel that it's her debt, and her responsibility to pay off while still contributing bills. You didn't pick a degree with 80k debt, it's not fair for her to expect you to pay it off for her, even with marriage. I'd sit down and outline finances, and even if she is short cash this is where you come in, but it's still hers."

But imagine years upon years of not being with your girlfriend ever. It depends how serious you are about her and how much you're willing to sacrifice. When time comes to determine ""is this relationship the long term type"", you'll both want to think about how the debt will impact you two.  If she can get a good paying job and you both make decent income, you can still have a great life. Not saying it won't still be there, but you're not doomed. It's definitely something to consider the implications of and should you decide you'd rather trade in the relationship for debt-free freedom, that's totally your prerogative.  My now-husband and I have fucking awful student loans - but I would not trade a penny of it in for a life without him. To me, it became a clear choice where yep, we deal with the student loans for years to come, but I love being with him and It's worth it. We still have fun, go out, do fun things.  So deliberate on the debt - it's not to be ignored or tossed aside; it does have long term implications. But if you both are hard workers who can work together, you can absolutely overcome it."

In the handful of states with ""community property"" rules, most debts incurred by one spouse during the marriage are owed by both spouses. But in states that follow ""common law"" property rules, debts incurred by one spouse are usually that spouse's debts alone, unless the debt was for a family necessity, such as food or shelter for the family or tuition for the kids.

That's what my mind jumped to when OP described her spending habits. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle, but may still be a valid concern for OP, as an extra 2$ pop and 10$ meal out a day adds up. Assuming a normal meal costs 5$, that's 200$ a month, and 2400$ a year that could be used to pay down debt."

Relationships are built on trust. If you're checking to see if he's lying, you don't trust him.   Look, you can't stop someone from cheating on you. Facebook and email passwords don't go that far -especially when there's a million anonymous apps out there. All you can do is trust them, intrinsically. And you should also respect them enough to give them their own spaces and privacy. You're not his mom. You're not his caretaker. You don't trust him - so why are you with him?"
relationship_advice,3dhm0s,notevenapro,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:14:41 2015 UTC,as i mentioned he has his own space he can do what he wants as can I.  I don't chain him to a chair and tell him to stay put because im paranoid he will do something lol. I do trust him for the most part but not a 100% to be fair i don't accuse him of cheating he hasn't done anything similar in over a year and yes those are my own demons i'm trying to deal with it but it's not easy when you trusted someone a 1000% before i found out i'd believe anything he said with no why's or buts and i got burned on that badly so to battle my own demons i check.... and no i don't ask him to show me his text messages i'm slowly observing that lies have short legs at the end of the day i know if he cheats i'll find out eventually . I'm with him because i do love him it's hard to trust someone who burned you like that. So for my own sanity and to put those stupid voices that tell me that he isn't telling the truth is checking his fb so bad? He has access to my fb equally as well so he can go on it and do whatever he wants by the way.
relationship_advice,3dhm0s,notevenapro,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:03:07 2015 UTC,"Access to FB Doesn't change the issue.   Neither of you should even have access to each other's personal accounts.   You've been hurt before and you're not over it. You're looking for problems because you still expect problems. Why? It's been over a year - any reasonable person would say that's a fair amount of time to earn back someone's respect.   Yes, these are your own demons. You need to face them and play your part. You still have him on a leash whether or not you believe it.   You want a healthier relationship? Start by asking him to change his passwords. Tell him you don't want to know what they are and tell him you trust him.   Then, talk to a therapist. A few sessions, probably won't need much more. You have trust issues and reddit doesn't have the resources to help you resolve it."

relationship_advice,3dhqlz,Osricthebastard,6,Thu Jul 16 15:19:40 2015 UTC,"""Nice guy"" is a sort of borderline co-dependent manipulation technique. It's a bit like the ex's I've had who acted super sweet and loving early in the relationship then within months turned into bitchy verbally abusive monsters. It's intentionally misrepresenting yourself to get what you want then pulling the rug out later when you think you've secured your prize.  And beyond that it's putting women on a pedestal. These guys go out of their way to treat women like fragile little princesses then inevitably cannot keep up the effort without beginning to feel used or bitter. It's a great way to end up in a relationship with a girl who wants to take advantage of you, ergo all the bitterness towards women they experience later in life."

Though honestly, I tend to think these things are on a sliding scale. When I dress up for a date, it's because I want the guy to like me (I don't usually wear make up or dress up in my day to day life); when a guy buys flowers for me it's because he wants me to like him. The list goes on.   The line between doing things to get someone to like you and manipulating them into liking you is quite thin I think."

relationship_advice,3dhqlz,Osricthebastard,6,Thu Jul 16 11:12:59 2015 UTC,"""Nice Guys"" (note the quotes) are the type who spout endless flattery and favors for a girl in the hopes of getting her affection. They differ from normal nice people who are trying to court someone by constantly doing these things and desperately clinging to someone who isn't interested. Also, the niceness is typically a facade, at least a little bit. It's used by socially stunted people who think the only requirement to get along with people and have them genuinely like you as a person is to do superficially ""nice"" things (completely ignoring that being nice is basic, you need an actual personality to get anywhere). It's common to hear of these ""Nice Guys"" turning into asshats when the object of their affection (and I do mean object here, they put a person on a pedestal and shower them with praise but never treat them like a human capable of flaws or thinking impure things) doesn't want to date them.   OP, have a sit down with him. Tell him you notice he's doing some things that (maybe) you did when you were having a hard time before, and you want to give him some advice. Then lay it on him.   Tell him if he wants something out of his life, he needs to act like his true self and also ask for what he wants. By that I of course mean communicating interest by asking someone out for a date instead of following them around like a lost puppy hoping they'll notice.   He probably has some anxiety about talking to women. Just remind him that they're really not all that different from men, and you can talk to them like you would anyone else. Rejection is almost always a lot worse in your head than it could ever be in real life, and once you have a couple of them it won't be a thing. It's not even personal (i mean it kind of is but they're not saying they hate you, just that they aren't attracted to you in that way. unless they say they hate you in which case you  may still be in elementary)  As you probably know it takes time. Just put some stuff out there and give advice on his actions when they happen."

Nice guys – guys who were taught from an early age that if you're good to women, they'll be good to you.    Physical end game:  Sex.    Emotional end game:  Relationship/marriage.    ""Nice guys"" – (note the quotes) per feminists, these are guys who say nice things to get into a woman's pants.  There's no perception that these guys are actually nice, but are considered deceitful.  More times than not, they're no different  than the first group of nice guys I mentioned but, if you add an agenda to the ""nice guy,"" you can then justify not having sex by suggesting the nice guy is fake.  Physical end game:  Sex.    Emotional end game:  Relationship/marriage.    Player/asshole – A guy who may in fact spout endless flattery and send flowers.  Doesn't even matter if the flowers have the wrong name on them (after the amazing sex has been had – I base this on a TRUE story, sadly).  These guys don't hide what they want and don't care that they're not willing to commit.  The women who accuse the ""nice guys"" group of being deceitful will willingly give themselves to the player/asshole group because ""they are honest about what they want, even if commitment isn't in the list.""  Physical end game:  Sex.  Emotional end game:  None.  Women want more of him, and he keeps them at arm's length, which keeps them giving more of the physical."

My wife and I were in the same situation. I am usually good at putting my thoughts into words and have a confident and even intimidating personality. So I've been told.   My wife is more timid and absolutely hates confrontation. She tends to give up rather than push a point because that is just her personality. Unfortunately, this caused her to be less ""equal"" in some of the decision making for our relationship. In other words, she didn't have a voice.   We realized this when it got to a point where I felt like everything was my decision. Like she was putting the stress of every decision on my shoulders. Once we realized what was happening, we had to find a way to fix it.   For us, this meant putting our words in writing. We would write emails to each other for serious topics or she would write a letter and read it to me. This gave her time to prepare her words in the best way possible. Obviously this was a temporary measure, but it helped her practice having a voice. Eventually she got more comfortable and confident in her communication, and was able to leave the writing aside.  Currently, we are doing date nights once a week where we each take turns discussing things that are bothering us, or on our minds, or even goals and aspirations.   I suggest looking into ""effective communication"" and ""smart goals""."

I'm afraid that because he does not see the problem himself yet, that he will just think that I am overexaggerating.

Perhaps a convenience to ""play the field"" or someone in particular without the guilt of feeling like he cheated. All of that while still having you sitting idly by waiting for him to come back.   I get that you've been together for a long time, but everyone deserves to be in a relationship with someone that knows they want to be with you. Security is one of the fundamental building blocks of any relationship, and he has literally stripped you of that.   My suggestion, talk to him and get him to clarify what he wants. More specifically, what he would change about his life if he weren't with you. See if there is a way he can meet those aspirations without hurting you or the relationship in the process. I personally would never settle for a break 11 years into a relationship. I wouldn't even humor the idea of a break at any point. If you can't work through problems together, then there really isn't any reason to continue being together. Obviously that means you've tried every way first, but a break means you've decided to just give up and have a soft breakup. A guilt free testing of what it would be like to be single. It rarely works out after a break."

You won't ever forget the people you have relationships over the course of your life.   It's still fresh which is why its uncomfortable. With time those feelings will become less intense and easier to deal with. The thing to take from relationships that don't work out is to learn from them. You're learning how to emotionally cope with this, this is called emotional growth.   Also, you have free will. So you have the ability to choose who you want to be with. You're not going to be magically forced to be with him by a supernatural being in the sky.   Just relax and have fun."

Wanting to be with someone on an intimate level and caring about them are two completely different things.   The feelings will definitely leave. Especially if you keep yourself busy. You're also allowed to take moments and just get it all out of your system. Put some music on and recall stuff you did fondly. Go on a walk and do some thinking. It'll work itself out in time.

relationship_advice,3di8nn,stacy98mcd,0,Thu Jul 16 15:12:09 2015 UTC,Thank you for saying this. Without my boyfriend in my life I swear I'd be going crazy right now. Basically what everyone is telling me is my heart hasn't had the time to heal completely because it was the first time we were face to face since the break up. But I get the gut feeling of you don't want this with him when I think about him. I don't ever see us getting back together. I only potentially see a future with my current boyfriend. He's also my best friend and we want the same job and everything. My family didn't like my first boyfriend but everyone absolutely loves my guy now and I do too. Losing him would be awful.
relationship_advice,3di8nn,newnewBrad,2,Thu Jul 16 15:16:27 2015 UTC,"You can't forget someone like that. It was a formative moment in your life and they'll always be a part of your memory. Even though the memory will never leave, the aching does over time as long as you keep on with your life.  I think your problem may be that you are so obsessed with NOT thinking about your ex, that your mind is subconsciously fixating on it. Just remember the past is the past, and this moment is all there really is."

I still treasure the time we spent together, but have moved on, realizing now that I had to learn the hard way.  I'm glad you're doing well, and that you feel safe and happy in your current relationship. It is completely normal to think about the times you've shared with previous relationships. It is important to remember however, that everything happens for a reason in this world. Your relationship with your first love has it's reason for ending, even if the reason may not be clear to you (and you may even realize the reasons now, which if so is an important step in moving on). And you are in your current relationship for a reason too, which is a beautiful thing about this world. By going through relationships, we learn and grow as people.  Forgetting is the hardest thing of all to learn, and most of the time you can't, at least not now. Time however is a mysterious thing. There will be weeks, and even months where you will not go a day without thinking of your first love. There will come a time though, when you will finally be able to live away from them in your mind."
relationship_advice,3di8nn,raptor6c,0,Thu Jul 16 16:02:08 2015 UTC,I never thought about him until about a month ago when we ran into each other. I just felt weird about seeing him because he moved back to my hometown. He doesn't go to my school anymore though. I know time will make it heal. But what was getting to me was the fact of what if I love him. Because I didn't want him. I want my current boyfriend. With my current boyfriend I'm always happy calm and feel protected. There's serious moments and fun ones. With my first it was kinda childish and goofy never real serious. We never actually went on dates or anything. Honestly I hope God put my current boyfriend in my life forever. He wants to be a firefighter and all guys in my family are firemen. In my future I want to be a paramedic and firefighter. He treats my little siblings so well and they love him so much. But my first love never really wanted anything to do with them. My current partner and I have been through so much together and I don't want my head to get the best of me with bad thoughts. He is truly someone I would spend the rest of my life with and be happy. Now can I say that about any other relationships I've had? Eh maybe but I wouldn't be happy. My boyfriend just fits perfectly into my lifestyle. I really do love him. People say love at young ages don't last but I really want this one too.

relationship_advice,3dgjr7,StopStalkingMeB,3,Thu Jul 16 04:21:49 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how you could like so much about a person, recognize that they are good-looking, and still not be attracted to them.   You don't need to understand it - you just need to accept it.  It happens.  I've been in similar situations on both sides of the equation.  'You're not my type' is a real thing.  It doesn't mean you're unattractive or that there's something wrong with you; it just means you're a Beethoven symphony and he's looking for someone more like Bob Dylan.   I knew pretty much from the start that he wasn't attracted to me, or at least that he wasn't to the extent that I was to him.   It sounds like you expected to be able to change his preferences, you didn't change his preferences, and now you feel shitty because of it.  Don't feel shitty.  You can't make people change.  Going into a relationship with the expectation that you'll be able to change the things you don't like about the other person is always, always, always a mistake.  You shouldn't feel bad because his preferences didn't change.  Would you expect to be able to make him like, say, broccoli?  Would you beat yourself up because he doesn't want to eat broccoli no matter how well you cook it?  Of course not.  So don't beat yourself up over his preferences in physical appearance.  They aren't your fault, and it doesn't reflect on your appearance.  The only kind of silly thing you did is expecting him to fall for you physically once he got to know you.  It works like that for you, but it doesn't work like that for many people."
relationship_advice,3dgjr7,aescolanus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:26:18 2015 UTC,"One concept that might be helpful to you from a self-esteem/ego standpoint is that whether or not he's attracted to you might truly have nothing to do with YOU at all.  We meet thousands of eligible single people in our lives but there are very, very few of those that really flip all our switches.  Sure, some of those people may be objectively ugly, or have off-putting personalities.  But probably at least hundreds of people that we meet but didn't turn us on are attractive, intelligent, and have decent personalities...and yet we're not attracted anyway.    But doesn't that say more about us than it does about them?  It signifies that our internal ""picker"" is seeking something other than objective qualities of attractiveness, intelligence, and personality, and is honing in on something more specific.  Something else is happening at a subconscious level that we're not even aware of.  So why didn't you flip all his switches while someone else might? One interesting theory I've read was in a book by Harville Hendrix called Getting the Love You Want.    He basically advances the notion that our attraction to people is highly influenced by our childhood experiences.  We soak up everything we see about relationships as young children (primarily observing our parents' relationships) and we build sort of a framework from those experiences that we unconsciously use to evaluate potential partners.  And that much of what draws or repels us has to do with how it compares to what we learned from those childhood experiences.  And often we end up being heavily drawn to people who share characteristics of people like our parents - even the bad characteristics - because our subconscious seeks out what's familiar.   So it could actually be that what is really going on is that you're awesome, but you're just not enough like his mother!    Or if not that, something else that is equally unrelated to your worth as a partner.     The fact that he thought highly enough of you to try to get his picker pointing in your direction tells you that you're objectively not the problem.  There's just something in his wiring that pulls him toward something that's just different than you.  And that probably has everything to do with his own personal construct that's been shaped from all his life experiences, and that nothing at all to do with you not being awesome."

relationship_advice,3dgsn2,katorulestheworld,2,Thu Jul 16 04:00:54 2015 UTC,"I think it is very effective to schedule a date/time to have this conversation. Make it very clear what you will be covering. Then give him a little time to prepare for it. He likely feels pressured when you bring things up because he doesn't know how to respond and doesn't want to lose whatever impression he thinks you have of him.   I also think a marriage counselor would be a smart decision at this point. It is a fast track method of improving the communication.   I always suggest writing things down and then setting the mood for the conversation. Making it relaxing and make sure both people know that they need to remain relaxed and calm. If it gets heated, take a small break and then start where you left off.   When you write things down, write the problem. A clear description of the problem. How it makes you feel. Most importantly include possible solutions. Then discuss it together and work out a solution that you are both happy with. Keep these conversations to 2-3 problems at a time, maximum. Don't overwhelm each other.   I also suggest looking up SMART goals to help make the plan."

I write down what I want to discuss, what my feeling about it are (yes i want white blinds, no i'm not in favor of indian for dinner), and what action items I would like to come to a firm decision on. We've have varying success with that, but mostly he'll just use them to skip the conversation and either go ahead and make decisions without me, or totally ignore as if I never sent the email.  We have discussed speaking with a marriage counselor. He was vehemently opposed to it when I brought it up a year+ ago, but seemed open to the idea last month. At the very least I know we both acknowledge there is a problem and care enough about one another to try and fix it.   I'll try giving him a smaller list of things, hopefully that will be less overwhelming."

My point is, you seem very reluctant to do something that your girlfriend asked you to and requires literally zero effort on your part. If anything, I think that is a much bigger problem than her possibly being slightly needy in this respect.   I guess another way to look at it is if you aren't willing to put in this very tiny amount of effort she is asking for, she could very likely find someone who will.

The worst thing you could do is punish her for that by ignoring it or saying it even less.  You could tell her how you feel like saying it every day makes it less important, and you want to save it for 'special' occasions, but I think if you actually care about her and want to make her happy, then saying she's beautiful more often is the way to go.  Finding out what a girl wants is a huuuge pain in the ass, so her opening up and telling you is a pretty big and mature gift."

There are 5 based on the theory- one being words of affirmation. (Another is touch and I forget the 5th)  You can be in a relationship with someone of a different love language, so long as you are somewhat aware that is what they need. For instance, I don't really appreciate someone doing a task for me beyond them taking their time- my sister does though. After reading about the 5 love languages, I tried doing things like taking out her trash when I visit (which I don't think to do bc I don't value it). I'm not exaggerating when I say it has opened the door for us to be friends.   (Mine is words, too, but more so in praising how I've been there for them or....for taking out the trash. I feel all warm inside when someone calls be a good friend or nice person)  EDIT: the fifth is quality time."

Probably low self esteem etc.  You've probably helped his life out a lot just being his friend and getting him into clubs and stuff like that.  I think the best route is just to hang out with him, but try to introduce him to people.  I think he wants to get out there but hes scared and he is kind of dependent on you.  I know he seems annoying, but try to focus on the compassionate side of things.  He's doing the best he can, and from his genetics and environment he has become this way.  He's obviously still in the scared of college phase that you were in at first."

He asks almost every day if I want to do some activity: go to the store, go throw a football, etc. I never want to do any of that with him. It’s not enjoyable for me. This has gone on for so long that I don't even want to see him. It feels like work, even if I only do it once in a while. I wish I didn't feel like this, but I do. He asks all the time.  Also, what can I say when I turn him down and hang out with someone else? If I was completely honest, I would say, ""No thanks, I don't want to hang out with you."" That would be the truth.  For example, he asks almost every day if I want to go eat dinner. I usually turn him down by either saying, ""No, I would rather eat by myself today."" Or, ""No thanks, I am going to go at a later time."" I say this so I don't hurt his feelings. I actually would like to eat with someone and/or go at the same time he would like to go, but I just don't want to eat with him.  To be perfectly truthful, I hate hanging out with him. I hate it. I feel like a teddy bear; I am someone he wants to take everywhere so he doesn't feel alone. All of my friends think I'm being a jerk for shunning him because he's super nice to me and everyone else. Never speaks an ill word about anyone. He's a good guy but I can no longer stand talking to him or hanging out. We have nothing to talk about. His interests are Survivor and celebrities and TV. Mine are baseball and physics and reading. All our conversations are just small talk about the weather and stuff. The only thing that keeps it somewhat interesting is that we both know what the other finds funny. There's value in that, but there is otherwise zero fuel left in this friendship, but he keeps trying to keep it alive. That's why I feel like a teddy bear. I want to get out of this as fast as possible. I don't want to spend another day holding someone else's hand. I feel like I've helped him all that I can.  I've had this happen with many friends before, when we just outgrew each other and we both just went our separate ways, no hard feelings. We still got along but just didn't hang out as much. It feels like this is happening here, except he will not let go.  I just wanted to vent. What can I do? I don't think he will latch on to anyone else as long as I keep giving him attention. What can I say when he wants to hang out but I want to spend my time with other people and not include him just because I feel sorry for him?"
relationship_advice,3dgyd7,macteague,2,Thu Jul 16 23:56:07 2015 UTC,"hmm definitely sounds like a lot of resentment has built up.  Resentment is the ultimate relationship killer whether platonic or romantic.  I see only two choices.  One: Keep going as you are going, hang out with him because you feel bad.  Ignore the annoyances or any other draining things about the relationship and keep going.  Or two: just be real with him.  Tell him your honest feelings about how boring things have gotten and how you don't want to hang out anymore because of etc. etc. etc.  Just be honest but also compassionate, because as annoying as he might be, he really is doing the best he can from what he knows both genetically and how he grew up (his environment and experiences).  Yeah number two might cause some backlash from your friends.  Worst case scenario they get mad at you and tell you that they don't want to hang out with you anymore because they don't like what you did.   It will be hard for them to understand because they dont have the same relationship with him that you have.  But then again, if you are expecting him to go out of his comfort zone and make a new best friend, then you also must be ready to possibly leave your comfort zone and make new friends.  Sorry, I know there's probably a lot of details I don't know, but I tried my best to give my perspective from my own experiences with my relationships.  Good luck man."

Frankly, I would limit the amount you even contact him back. It sounds like he's using you for emotional support but not giving you any in return. This will last until he finds someone else to use in this way.   His native language isn't English so I know I'm going to have to help him with stuff.   You're not his mom. You don't have to help him with anything.   But if I'm lonely and by myself in a new city, I don't know how strong I'm going to be.

relationship_advice,3dgije,hopeless93,3,Thu Jul 16 02:20:52 2015 UTC,"Allow me to offer my input: You are not his mother. I understand that college can be very trying, and it's a shame that he did not do good during a semester, but, the thing is, part of college is recognizing mistakes, owning up to them, and improving yourself based off of the experience. You cannot assist him in this. You can offer support, and be there for him, but nothing more can be done. It is HIS job to keep his nose down and improve his studies. You cannot keep him busy/productive; he has to do that, and he should want to do that. If you are being forced to motivate your boyfriend, it is clear that he lacks ambition.  Understand that your role as his SO is to be supportive of what he wants to do. If he doesn't want to do anything, that is is own battle to wage. You cannot be an abutment of something that doesn't exist."
relationship_advice,3dgije,DippinThatSawce,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:33:04 2015 UTC,"I get what your saying. I guess I've always felt a little more responsible for him because he doesn't really have anyone here.   I would not say I'm being forced to motivate him. He already completed the first obvious steps of contacting the school and the reality is really sinking in now that they told him there is no way around this.   He has asked for me to help him develop a plan of action. (I'm extremely into planning/organization, him not so much) He definitely doesn't want to just sit around because he says that will remind him of his failure. I would say this was the kick in the ass he needed to wake up and stop trying to ""cruise"" through college. He even took the steps to tell his parents the truth which really surprised me. I was proud of him for having the courage to do that. (His parents speak no English, live overseas and would have never known if he hadn't chosen to tell them)   I realize I will just have to let go and see what other steps he can take on his own and offer him help and support where he needs it. I guess part of it is me feeling so hopeless and wishing I could do more, but like you said this is his battle.   Thanks!"
relationship_advice,3dgqd0,dwtbad,5,Thu Jul 16 03:29:33 2015 UTC,"The reasons that I don't think this is normal: - You state: I want to be in a relationship with other people - She's madly in love with you but you don't use the word madly when you describe your love for her - You think you were more attracted to being in a relationship than being in one with her           Therefore I think you should recognize the error and fix it as soon as possible. Since you're living together, it would be polite to give her 30 days to find a new situation for living and insurance. It's doubtful that extending your time with her will make things better; there is a chance but it is slim."
relationship_advice,3dgqd0,alongstrangetrip,3,Thu Jul 16 03:35:27 2015 UTC,"Let's summarize:  -dating a 19 year old for five months.   -life is ""so entwined"" - doubtful after only five months. More like it'd be a few hours of work to untangle things.  -""she's moved in with me/ has no where else to go"" - terrible idea. You've been dating five months. Fortunately it sounds like she's not officially moved in.   ""is on my auto insurance"" - also a terrible idea seeing as you've been together five months. But this is an easily fixed problem.   -you want to see other people.    Summary of solution:  -break up now before she moves in officially. This breakup appears to be inevitable. Ending it asap is best for both of you.  -it's going to hurt her feelings but it's way better than being in a relationship you don't want to be in because you don't want to hurt her feeling now. You're going to hurt her more when you inevitably breakup and she finds out you've been wanting to do it for awhile.  -don't get back together  -don't move this fast in future relationships"
relationship_advice,3dgqd0,bentleyk9,2,Thu Jul 16 05:37:08 2015 UTC,"Letting her move in with you and putting her on your auto insurance was a bad idea this early on. And yes, it is normal for the honeymoon period to fade away around 6 months -1 yr. Why would entangle your life with someone in such a complicated way before you have had time to really assess whether you want to be with this person long term?   I also think it is normal to question whether you want to stay with someone throughout a relationship but if those thoughts are constant and persistant then maybe they are important to pay attention to.  If I were you I would tell her that you feel like things are moving too fast and you want to slow it down, tell her you want her to find her own place within x- amount of time. You don't have to break up with her yet, just get her to find her own place so you have enough space to re-evaluate if you really want to be with her. Also if you break up with her now you will have to live with her until she finds a place which is going to suck. If you wait til she finds her own place it might make things easier for both of you."
relationship_advice,3dgqd0,baller_unicorn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:23:51 2015 UTC,"This is about the time the honeymoon phase ends.  Ask yourself, if you date someone else will you just repeat this process thereby wasting someone else's time and hurting them too?  Personally, I think breakups are really sad.  If you can find a way to love her and be with her, then do everything you can to do that."

Secondly, it does not sound like you two are compatible because this seems like a one-sided relationship judging by what you wrote  I also work a **** ton of hours, anywhere from 60-80, and I still see my gf about 4 times a week"
relationship_advice,3dfwou,SandyJ8,2,Thu Jul 16 00:12:13 2015 UTC,"Wow. It literally felt like my old self wrote this.   I feel for you man. I was with a girl for two years and it was EXACTLY like this, seriously... It's scary how much is the same in your scenario. So I understand this can drive you crazy.  That's what happened to me. It drove me crazy. When her and I hung out, it was absolutely amazing. We laughed, listened to music, watched Bobs Burgers, Archer, smoke, drink, and just have an amazing time.   She lived about 20 minutes away from me, and we rarely saw each-other during the week. We always kept in contact through the week with texting as well as a phone call here and there.   Our schedule was mostly shed spend the night on Friday night, getting to my house about 5, then we'd spend Saturday together and she'd go home early Sunday morning. And it wasn't even every weekend. She loved to be alone at home, reading, etc. She also had other friends she liked to see also.   It began to make me think she didn't love me. I became not as confident in my self, started thinking she was cheating (when there was no signs of it at all, just what I made up in my head.), and it just generally drove me crazy. I was constantly begging her to see me, to tell me she loved me, to promise she wasn't gonna leave me, blah blah blah. I smothered her and it eventually broke her. She couldn't take it.   She ended up leaving me a year ago and it was really rough for me. But I had an eye opening experience months later after reflecting on it all. Her and I are great friends now and hang out! Probably about once a week lol! But seriously, you're not crazy for feeling the way you feel. But sometimes people are different and like being alone and or personal space. Not everyone has to be like us and want love and affection 24:7. It doesn't make them weird, less loving, rude, or anything else negative. They are just different from us like we are from them.   But it can workout if you love them and trust them. I know 100% my ex and I would work if we ever got back together because I caused all the instability by lack of trust and becoming angry at what she liked to enjoy.   If she assures you she loves you. And you love her, don't sweat it. Worrying will do nothing but cause problems. Love her the best you can and be happy she's in your life when she is! Just my opinion friend! Hope all goes well."

relationship_advice,3dfwou,paralloyd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:19:15 2015 UTC,"I'm all about space, but when I've loved a man, I've wanted to spend time with him more than once a week. I find it odd that your girlfriend doesn't, if she has the time and if she truly loves you.  What does she spend her time doing instead?  When you are together, what do you do together and how loving and affectionate is she toward you?  If you were to break up with her, is there anything she would lose besides your company?"
relationship_advice,3dfwou,Horny_GoatWeed,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:33:37 2015 UTC,"She works a lot, meaning she's mostly free nights, but she usually spends her time at home by herself. Occasionally she'll ditch me to hang out with friends. It's not entirely fair for me to say she has free time all week, since she works full time and usually nights, but the time is there, just not utilized.   We usually hang out and watch Netflix or tv shows together. Because we see each other so little, and I never know when we'll be hanging out, it's hard to set up dates or things for us to do. We also go out with friends a lot due to a mutual friend group. When her and I are together she seems very affectionate, however when we're out with friends she's a bit more distanced.   If we were to break up? I'm not sure, I try to be as supportive and understanding as possible, even when she cancels plans or tells me she can't hang out. So I guess my company and support."

relationship_advice,3dhink,ItsHammerTime93,0,Thu Jul 16 09:06:42 2015 UTC,"I feel for you, man. You don't know how much I know how you feel. I understand your situation deeply. #nohomo but man I wish I could give you a hug.  A ""just friends"" relationship between a man and a woman can never exist, simply because men and women are different. Women are actually capable of feeling nothing sexual for their male friends. But we guys are different. We can't... Or at least I can't, and no guy I have ever known can. If you go into the internet and read some articles authored by psychologists, there will always be a bias. Articles written by male psychologists always conclude that the ""just friends"" crap is crap. Articles written by female psychologists will conclude the opposite, that it is possible.  What I am trying to tell you is that chances are the guy will make moves for your girlfriend. BUT, if you trust your girl and if she truly loves you she will NOT respond to those advances.  Next.  ""Talking with somebody with no emotions at all"". This line. Have you asked her if she still loves you? Do you think she means it? 4 Months is not a long ways off, but if she has changed and no longer feels the same about you it will be difficult. No longer being distanced may help a lot, but the relationship has to survive up to that point.  What I would do is give her a little space. I know, I have been there, being controlling with her is just a natural response to the apparent competition you see on that other dude. But think about it, does trying to control her would really make a difference? You're not there, you can't stop shit from happening if it's going to happen. I know it is harsh, but it is the truth, and once you realize this, you will feel a little more at peace. The only thing you can do is trust your girlfriend and try to have lots of open communication about everything you are feeling. Meet the guy when you are there. Be NICE to him, and try to figure out his intentions but DO NOT go and try to ""mark your territory"". If you do this, the only thing you're doing is letting him KNOW that you are insecure and threatened by him, and you would also COMFIRM to him that you are acknowledging him as competition, putting you AT THE SAME LEVEL with him. Never do this. Always be nice to him even if he's not. Always take an attitude of ""you are here, I am here, I am fine and relaxed, you are of no real concern to me, I am my girlfriend's boyfriend and you are his friend, that is all there is and that is all that will be"".   I really hope everything goes for the best. I sincerely wish you a happy relationship and that all turns out for the better. Good luck."

I'm sure you love her but your very going and it might be better to keep your mind and options open. Don't put all your eggs in one basket to be crushed.

After that we went on to have an awesome time. Yes, we had sex, we kissed, we did everything a loving couple does. When we saw each other again on March, the same, everything was fine. Sex, kissing, intimacy. From January to March, the no-skype-sex symptom had already begun, but that was all and I dismissed it as she didn't want to have skype sex anymore and only real sex."

Sex online does wear out it did for me and my current bf but we see each other every weekend if she with holds sex in real life when you see her that is an issue there is no explanation for with holding intimacy and affection. It is expected at the start or if she had intimacy issues they would usually happen at the start I'm saying keep your eye out if she with holds sex from you when she sees you next there is something seriously wrong if people have to wait months for their other half they usually have tons of sex if she with holds it there is something up."

Its a natural boy-girl interaction and, when kept to a healthy small amount, is probably a healthy thing for self-esteem.  To that end, I can't say for sure that this conversation was over the line or not (and everyone has a slightly different line).    The one thing I would say for sure is that, if she is going to be joking around with a guy, he should absolutely know she is in a relationship, and it should come up kind of frequently since I would imagine you should be the focus of her social life."

I would be grateful to her for coming forward with this and let her know that it does make you a little uncomfortable, but you should reiterate that you are not offended. Ask if he is aware that she is in a relationship with you, and if not let her know that you would appreciate it if she made that clear to him.   Just remember that open communication is the key to a healthy relationship. Let her know how you feel in an open and honest fashion that does not come off as accusatory or hostile."

Well i told her, that i'm happy that she has told me of her ""flirting"" and that I see that she cares about our relationship but now she is kinda angry at me for implying that she would not care about our relationship.

I'd wait for something more substantial before worrying.  There should be some trust there after two years?  I understand you feeling a moment of being upset - but I would let it go - as jealously or lack of trust can quickly undermine a relationship.  I say, see whom she actually moves in with and so forth.  I think the guy was joking about ""date"" and it would have been odd for her to say ""I have a boyfriend"" - if that makes sense?  Also, if she were to live with the guy - he will know she has a boyfriend - you.  And as Gambit791 said - maybe he's a creep - in which case she will meet him and will NOT want to live with him...Anyways....2 years is a solid, steady relationship (in my book) and unless there are other problems of this kind -  I would say don't worry for now...."

My suggestion is that you aren't ready for a friendship, let alone a relationship. You need to work on yourself in a serious way to overcome your boundary violation issues.

relationship_advice,3dhfao,StopStalkingMeB,-1,Thu Jul 16 09:43:08 2015 UTC,I asked how to talk to my girlfriend about it not what your personal belief on what I did and how I sholudnt have a girlfriend also if you read what I wrote to Altaccountfor you would know why I hacked his account.
relationship_advice,3dhfao,StopStalkingMeB,3,Thu Jul 16 09:47:47 2015 UTC,"It's not my personal belief, it's a fact.   I offered you the advice you need. Talking to your girlfriend will be a lot easier when you deal with that first. There is a logical order to things, resolving your own issues is required before any conversation with your girlfriend will mean anything. I didn't realize I had to spell it out for you."
relationship_advice,3dhfao,StopStalkingMeB,-1,Thu Jul 16 10:17:26 2015 UTC,"again you must have not read my previous comment to altaccountfor there was no boundary issue because he request I did it I didnt hack it because I suspected it having pictures. and the suggestions were to talk to her about it not what I need to do to talk about it, and you said I was a bad boyfriend how does asking for help on to her approach her about it so we can communicate and talk about what was happening second of all we are very open about our pasts and are honest to each other and I became frustrated because I have to question if shes been lying to me just because it was the past doesn't changed that there was dishonesty and ive made it clear to her no matter what her past was I would still love her because I love her for her not the mistakes or what she has done  I believed shes honest but when one of the reasons why you love some one is put into question its upsetting"
relationship_advice,3dhfao,Altaccountfor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:38:38 2015 UTC,"Sure he did. If he requested you to go into his account, there would be absolutely no qualm about telling him you went into his account.   Either way, you clearly aren't capable of following simple advice. Good luck and lay off the drugs. It can negatively impact your brain, your ability to comprehend, and your ability to reason. As you are proving."
relationship_advice,3dhfao,Altaccountfor,-1,Thu Jul 16 11:00:04 2015 UTC,"your advice was circumstantial, in that if I had boundary issues and that I need to fix my issues before I talk to her. what other issues would I need to fix then? if there was no boundary issue"

relationship_advice,3dhfao,teddybearsx,0,Thu Jul 16 11:11:02 2015 UTC,"My suggestion is that you aren't ready for a friendship, let alone a relationship. You need to work on yourself in a serious way to overcome your boundary violation issues. Until you fix your own issues, you aren't being a good friend or boyfriend. If you can't be a good boyfriend, then you shouldn't be with her  what did I miss then you state my issue was boundary"
relationship_advice,3dhfao,teddybearsx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:17:52 2015 UTC,"Which is more important to you, your friendship or your girl? Because your only options are: 1.) To keep quiet about the whole thing so that no one finds out you hacked your friend. 2.) Confront your girl and have everyone know what you did.  If you choose #1, you will feel horrible every time you look at your girl's face. The curiosity and doubt will haunt you always UNLESS you decide ""whatever she did before being my girlfriend is none of my concern"". You have to have a lot of strength in order to go down this path.  If you choose #2 you may or may not lose your friend, but chances are you will know the truth. Are you sure you want to know the truth?  Putting aside the cold calculations, here is what I would do, as a rational but also emotional human being.  I would ask her again about the pictures. I would hope to all the gods I don't believe in that she tells me the truth. If she lies, my trust in her will be considerably diminished. If she's willing to lie about stuff that happened years ago before you two were even together, chances are she would be MORE than willing to lie about more important stuff happening NOW that actually concerns the relationship and you. Finally, if she lies, I would confront her and tell her that there were more pictures but I would REFUSE to tell her how I know unless absolutely necessary. I would proceed to actually question her loyalty and honesty and well, yeah. There's not really much else to do."
relationship_advice,3dhfao,teddybearsx,-1,Thu Jul 16 09:13:13 2015 UTC,I came up with the exact same choices its been a month since I stumbled upon the photos and I cant really look at her with out feeling horrible  and the hacking of the dropbox was cause he said he lost his password and said he might need me to get it for him just incase I tested the login and that's how I discovered it because it was the first album so I think he would understand why I know about them
relationship_advice,3dhfao,teddybearsx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:35:18 2015 UTC,"Do you think that maybe he wanted you to see them? I can't really think of any other reason why he would give you access to the password of a place he STILL keeps pictures of YOUR girlfriend.  EDIT: Even if he legit needed you to recover the account, why not move the pictures somewhere you wouldn't have access to?"
relationship_advice,3dhfao,teddybearsx,-1,Thu Jul 16 10:02:14 2015 UTC,Exactly. so this weekend I'm going over and hopefully I can get the courage to talk to her about it and hopefully the truth is told because if not I need to cut both of them out my friend for the pictures he still keeps and her just because I cant always have to worry about loyalty and honesty. ive been 100% honest with her and its becoming too much we don't keep passwords on our phones because we trust each other and recently a guy who I know likes her keeps trying to talk to her she makes it clear that hes just a friend and I try hard to believe it but she entertains it and I don't even want to go on her phone cause I'm not trying to see something that gets me mad
relationship_advice,3dggq3,Witwee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:05:40 2015 UTC,"First of all, you are entering a mutually inclusive living arrangement with someone, you need to find a way to be more outspoken when things don't appeal to you or you will have constant and unnecessary drama.  As for dealing with the situation, just tell her (ideally face-to-face) that you both need to sit down and work it all out. Tell her what you already have for the place, and then together make a list of what is needed immediately to live.   Then make an agreement on purchasing these items. My suggestion would be to go together and buy these items and split the cost evenly. My college roommate and I spent an entire day at IKEA and did it this way. So much less drama.   We purchased some cheap stuff, so it didn't matter who kept it in the end. If you are buying better stuff, then decide who gets it and put it in writing.  Anyways, you are an adult now. This means you need to stop allowing people to pressure you into things you aren't comfortable with. Use this as a practice so that when a real problem arises you are more prepared and capable to handle it."

When our sex life lulls, we talk about it. When we feel far apart emotionally, we talk about it. We aren't scared to be open with each other about how we are feeling.   Fight Fair. It took my SO and I a little while to get this one... we would say nasty things and break up every fight. We grew up and now we know that one disagreement is not the end. We started to speak calmly during disagreements and say things like ""I'm so sorry  you're upset- I do not want to fight""  The desire to keep it going. THIS. This is everything for me. Even when my SO and I were at our darkest times, we both wanted to fight for the relationship. We both felt like it was worth it. I never feel like I'm the only one pulling for us- which makes it easier to put in the work.... feeling a 100% sure that he has my back.   BE A TEAM. my SO and I are mid thirties and no desire to get married. we refer to each other as teammates. It isn't MY relationship or HIS relationship... it's OUR relationship.

She would give you very different tips because we're very different and we fight even for the smallest thing but we like to spend time with each other. Take time to know the person you're going to date. Go out, have fun; make activities you like and some she likes; travel together and see how you and her behave. Traveling shows the true colors of a person. Take several weeks to know the person, a couple of months if you're truly interested. Go ahead and make your move, stay as boyfriend/girlfriend for at least a year before you decide to live together. Spend at least two years living together before you decide to go ahead and ask the question. My most precious tip for you: little things count a lot. You hate your SO leaves wet towels on the bed or littering the bedroom with clothes? Go ahead and do the job for him/her, but talk about it and ask for something him/her hates from you and exchange hated tasks. Also, these little thing tend to accumulate during the years, try to forget them or talk assertively about them."

My advice is dont have the expectation that it will feel the same after a year, 2, or 3, as it did in your honeymoon phase. Make sure you do have things in common, not making compromises to please the other.   If you the things you commonly do together are not things you both enjoy, instead as a result of compromises, it will eventually get tedious and maybe determental to the relationship. Especially if the compromises are one sided in anyway.   If you dont have commong hobbies, work on developing one! And make sure that both of you are completely honest about how much you enjoy it.

In a way, she's going to show you what she wants, and you should show her the same. I respect and secretly enjoy your situation because I've been there a few times, and generally my experience went well for me. She's giving you all the clues, and body language but she did put up the friendship wall.   Should you have kissed her, maybe. Could it have backfired, absolutely. And even if things went all the way one night, doesn't mean she wouldn't bring up the friendship-crap again. It's kind of an ""itoldyouso"" leaving you really wanting more than you already do. Which may be worse if you experience all of her, and then she gives you the justfriends fistbump. That would suck.  In my experience, I recommend respecting her friendship wall. But your actions need to change. Don't always be there for her. You're friends, doesn't mean you have to be there like a BF right? Right. So don't always respond to her messages. Let some texts go most of the day. Don't always say ""sorry, work has been busy, yada yada"" but something along those lines once in a while. She's playing the friendship card, but you need to play the shit out of it. If she asks you what you're doing this weekend, either say your'e going to visit family or have to pick a friend up from the airport. Something. The goal is, you want her to miss you. You want her to think - hey maybe I shouldn't have told him I just wanted to be friends.   You already kissed her, and then she told you she wanted to be friends. You should respect that, with your actions that hopefully change her mind. Same way she should respect that it's just a friendship. For now. Hopefully. In that if she ever texts ""what's wrong with you, is something up, did I uspet you?"" - that's the time in which you tell her that her feelings don't match yours, but you're still friends.  Less is more. Pretty much states you're still there if she were interested but your'e not sharing if you're seeing someone else. but you being busy and not responding to her right away or being busy on Friday or Saturday nights, shows you really are a catch, and other girls are highly interested - ...they do exist.   You need to ease up on the hanging out or communicating. Respond to a few right away but then let the last one go or respond later at night, when the conversation expired, if you know what I mean. Don't hang out with her all the time, but maybe see her once every 2 weeks, or once a month. Almost to the point of - let's catch up. It may be best to let her do most of the work. In which you can decline or cancel plans, or say your'e busy or have a date.   It may not work, but everyone wants what they can't have. And you're kinda showing her the only way she can be with you, is if it's romantically. You don't want to be the guy always going for a kiss and always being rejected or Tom from the movie 500 days of summer. She told you she wanted friendship but your heart is brutally broken, due to your own fault. Most of it has to do with self respect, and turning her friendship stance against her, because her actions show otherwise.   Good luck."

If it hurts this much and he hasn't even slept with the other girl, why do you think it won't hurt once it's happened?  He can't right your wrong.  Neither of you can, ever.

I do not think that's about making it right ""for him,"" I think you're trying to make yourself feel better by getting him to hurt you.  I don't think that's malicious (no attack here), I understand your motivation, I just don't think it has a chance of working out the way you're hoping.  If he carries any guilt over what he's about to do, that supremely unfair.  If he has any guilt about it now, going into it, you should stop him.  All you can do is apologise and bear this guilt on your own; don't try to get him to share it.  I think that will make you both feel worse in the long run.  And remember how crappy this feels, so you never put yourself through it again.  Not worth it."

He feels the need to ""get back at you"".  This isn't forgiveness, it's revenge, which is not conducive to a healthy relationship.  All this will do is put more distance between you and your partner.  I know it may be too late for this, but my suggestion would be to tell him how you're feeling.  Let him know you're sorry for what you've done, but that you think this is going to cause you more pain than anything.    That may mean this is the end of your relationship, but this is better than being in a relationship with no trust.  I know it's hard, OP, but you'll get through it.  Just learn from your mistakes."

You SHOULD feel about about emotional cheating but that doesn't mean you should accept this arrangement, which reeks of blackmail. I'm guessing the guy isn't really that into you anyway.

Why in the world would you think that would make it better?  Nothing makes it 'better', you both just have to work together to move past it. All this will do is add another problem on top of the old one. You don't intentionally hurt someone you love because they hurt you, that's ridiculously toxic.  Please don't let him go through with this. Sit down and really explain the reason you wanted to but that you were wrong, it wont fix anything just break your side of the relationship too. Then figure out what you two need to do together to fix it. If he was ok with this at all...I'd suggest counseling.   You aren't insane, you're just acting out of panic and aren't thinking clearly. If you want to mend it, this isn't the way. If you think the relationship is doomed no matter what, split up without all this extra drama. This will only make it harder on you both."

Our relationship seems all fcked up I know.   It's not a moral issue, it's that these kinds of things don't generally fix relationship problems. He's pissed off and hurt because you betrayed him and in his grief he wants you to feel the same. The problem is that it's more than likely not going to make him feel any better and it's going to make you feel worse.

If you've been together for two years this shouldn't be that big of a deal. If she makes it out to be then she may be looking for a reason to break it off with you. If that's the case then it's better now than later. If she accepts your apology and doesn't blow up about it then she more than likely isn't seeing her ex and you're good to go. Just stop invading her privacy and have some respect.
relationship_advice,3dg9on,Lydious,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:07:43 2015 UTC,"The best advice I can give is to step back and rationally look at it when you have a clear head. You are obviously going to be angry at first and be paranoid but she could have just not told you because she didnt want you to be freaking out like you are. She told him she was seeing you and it has been two years, if she didnt want to be with you and wanted to be with him then she would so just be happy that she chose you over him. I would just let it go and not confront her becuase she will think you dont trust her and just keep an eye on her. If she starts pulling away or being distant you might have more to worry about but for now no more checking her phone and just trust her."

It's called love.    Any advice on how to deal with her wanting space and what I do to make sure shes actually thinking about us and not trying to get over me?   You respect that request and give her space and time. She ended the relationship and you need to accept that. She is already in the process of getting over you. That is why she is writing about ""perfect day"" and you are feeling sick.   Breakups hurt, especially when you are the person who didn't want it. But you have to move on and stop holding onto false hope. Cut contact so you aren't seeing her quicker progression of getting over you, and focus at getting over her. You won't be able to do that while you are checking on her updates daily and trying to talk to her and get back with her."

relationship_advice,3dg9m9,paralloyd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:34:24 2015 UTC,"She will never come back to you. It's over. I'm sorry.  Your girlfriend doesn't know herself what the problem in your relationship was, so she made up a bullshit reason about not feeling desired. Here's the real reason: You stopped being exciting and challenging because you made it all too clear that you were only too happy to be with her. Women want to feel like we have to work to deserve to be with our man. We don't want to feel like he's our puppy, wagging his tail every time we pay him the slightest bit of attention. That's boring, and it makes us wonder if we couldn't get someone better.  Next time you get a girlfriend, be a little more mysterious. Take note of the intensity of her affection toward you, and when she turns it down a notch, withdraw from her until she turns it back up. Make sure to keep her on her toes and always feeling like she has to be at her best in order to keep you around. That's how you get a woman to ardently desire to marry you. Good luck!"

You're best bet when she brought this up was for you to agree and show little emotion. This would get her questioning why you were so ready to drop the relationship.  You need to get out and go on dates, she sure will and the low chance she tries to get back with you, don't just jump at the opportunity.

relationship_advice,3ddhc9,murderousbudgie,5,Wed Jul 15 12:39:29 2015 UTC,"Probably right, but also to be be fair, you have to expect that talking about a very abusive relationship, and asking probing questions (if even meant to help), has a fair chance of bringing up negative emotions.  Its not like she got pissed while you guys were talking about your favorite movies."
relationship_advice,3ddhc9,zorilla24,11,Wed Jul 15 13:15:08 2015 UTC,"True. Also, OP, it looks like you're blaming her for what was done to her (""I was just asking her about why she let him do the stuff he did to her."" emphasis mine) and that is bound to cause defensiveness and make her feel unsafe. I'm sure you didn't mean any harm by it, but for future reference, this is not a good way to go about addressing someone else's past trauma. Which is, again, why she needs to get through this in a supportive environment, not one where she's being interrogated about why she let things happen that were not her fault."
relationship_advice,3ddhc9,murderousbudgie,9,Wed Jul 15 13:30:40 2015 UTC,"Wow sometimes I hate the advice given here.   She needs to see a professional. Therapy can be very helpful in moving past traumatic and unhealthy relationships.   She also probably felt like a huge failure and disappointment to you when you asked why she let him abuse her. That's not how abuse works, and she probably already felt like it was her fault, so it makes sense that she would feel defensive and like shit after hearing that you think she didn't do enough to stop it. Even if that's not what you think, the phrasing delivers that message.   When you guys talk, consider the way you're presenting your comments before you say them. I'm not at all insinuating that this is all you and not her at all, just recommending that you have a solid idea of what message you're conveying with your words so you know if she's overly defensive or if your words don't always convey the meaning you're intending.   IMO, it is immature to say ""whatever I'll talk to you in two weeks"" and not work out the problem. If you want to, I would suggest sending her a message that just says ""I want to fix what is happening right now, and I'm willing to have a conversation about it, but I feel like ignoring each other for two weeks will do more harm to our relationship."" Using statements about the way you feel helps keep the conversation from turning into a ""you always do this"" type of issue. Things like ""I feel frustrated and hurt when I can't talk to you without it upsetting you even though I think I've said something kind and my intentions are to be nice"" typically works better than ""you always get upset when I'm just being nice,"" in my opinion.   Long post, sorry about that. Relationships take work, and if it becomes something that makes you miserable, walk away. But until then, good luck :)"
relationship_advice,3ddhc9,claireashley31,5,Wed Jul 15 17:18:38 2015 UTC,"Its her personality. If you don't want to spend the rest of your life in this exact scenario than move on.

relationship_advice,3ddhc9,smileycat,4,Wed Jul 15 15:57:11 2015 UTC,"i put up with this type of shit for over 2 years with a similar personality. the pattern emerged very early on that i had to base my words and actions primarily around not making her upset for fear of the ensuing emotional shit storm. the longer i went along with it, the deeper it got entrenched and when i finally broke up with her it was all the more difficult. i'm not necessarily saying get out, but put your foot down and establish your boundaries right now. if she can't handle it, y'all will break up but it'll be easier early on then if it drags on for months/years."
relationship_advice,3ddhc9,KnowWhatAmeen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:01:42 2015 UTC,"Please don't ever ask someone why they ""let"" someone abuse them.  From the outside looking in, it's easy to say ""why is she staying with him, he treats her terribly"", but it's much more complex than that. Abuse victims are often caught in a web of deceit. They enter a relationship that appears healthy and good for them, then they are slowly conditioned to doubt themselves, to accept mistreatment, and even to feel that they deserve to be mistreated or punished. She needs reassurance from you that you will treat her well simply for being her, not fear that you will become like him. That fear pops up when you indicate (even unintentionally) that the abuse was her fault or choice. Once you have been abused and get out, you feel incredibly stupid for how blind you were to it. You feel responsible, used, insecure.   It sounds like you want to communicate more effectively with her, so I would recommend looking up online resources on communicating with people who have been in abusive relationships. It's likely you are unknowingly triggering negative responses and emotions in her when you are saying things that would not bother her had she not previously been abused. She may not recognize them as triggers and therefore would not be able to tell you what is happening. She simply shuts down, assumes she was wrong to feel the way she did, and apologizes. That may be how she has been conditioned to react in situations like that.   I'm speaking from my own experience, so not all of this may match her situation perfectly. But I'm only recognizing many triggers I have now, several years after a line of abusive relationships. Previously I assumed I was behaving badly, having an outburst for some reason, or simply not understanding my SO. I've come to realize that very innocent, simple things trigger negative responses from me. The more I identify them, the more power I have to overcome them and learn to communicate more effectively."
relationship_advice,3ddhc9,cacciatore_love,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:16:39 2015 UTC,"I see a lot of me in your girlfriend. Honestly, I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder & I'm seeing a therapist for it.   It sounds like she might have similar issues & the only thing that is going to help / change her is herself. It took me forever to realize that not everyone was out to get me. I often spent my time analyzing things boyfriends said to me, searching for any indication that they were thinking about leaving or insulting me in any way....   Once I started going to therapy I've realized that not everything is an attack, and the world doesn't revolve around me. I also am starting to realize that my words actually do have an affect on other people.   You should read up on the condition, it may help you understand her more (if she's really similar to me, and suffering with similar issues).   She may have said that comment to try and bait you into talking to her, validating that you aren't abandoning her. So if I were you I'd reach out to her before then."

It's fine to over react sometimes but she can't just block out your opinion and then not give a justification otherwise how are either of you going to move on from it like you say. She needs some perspective and needs the realisation that the world doesn't revolve around her, no one gives a shit and she needs to deal with her issues instead of blocking them out. Sit her down and tell her what you just told us and how it makes you feel. Try draw comparisons so she can understand if the shoe was on the other foot how it would make her feel. She sounds like a diva tbh and you shouldn't have to treat on eggshells. Once my boyfriend told me this I got my shit together because I don't want him to feel that way. Sounds like she doesn't care and is self absorbed. She doesn't need to be soothed and you need to ask yourself if this is what you really want? How petty to say she is done talking to you?! No regard for how you feel at all. I wouldn't message her at all if I were you, gives her a chance to realise you won't be pining after her ever need"

Stop the conversation.  Tell her, OK have fun with that...and go find other people to hang out with or something to do.  In relationships we test and train what are partner is going to be and mean to us. Don't try to fix her. Don't be her emotional tampon. IE. don't let her train you into being that. If she can't just have you as a boyfriend and not that, then let her seek a new one.

Also, how do I approach her about slowing down her texting other guys all the time?   You probably don't want to hear this but you can't control someone else's actions.  It is possible that if you have a conversation with her, she will respect you and stop (honestly a mature woman would know when to cool it), or she could immediately go to your friend and paint you out to be the bad guy.    I used to have issues with this with my ex's.  Then I found a guy who didn't text women in excess....problem solved.  Sometimes you have to do things that will make you feel more secure, and sometimes that means removing yourself from the situations that make you feel bad. This is your life-don't waste time putting yourself in positions that make you feel uneasy.    So, break up or let it go.  Or talk to her and hope that she doesn't tell your guy friend and make you look bad."

relationship_advice,3de78x,rainbowLena,2,Wed Jul 15 17:45:28 2015 UTC,"If you trust her and you know you shouldn't be controlling and you know she hasn't done anything wrong then don't do anything. Simple. Work on your own issues of jealousy, ask yourself continuously of you really want to be a controlling jealous boyfriend over something so silly. Don't let your ex affect your current relationship. Choose to be the kind of person you want to be."

Maybe even try to be romantic, have a nice dinner, light a candle or something and say ""I really love how much we keep in contact.  I love when we text and makes me feel awesome.  Sometimes I get a little jealous when I see how much you text instertguysnamehere.  I know it's not a big deal but I would feel more comfortable if perhaps you texted less""  or something like that?  This way she should be non confrontational and more conversational.  Thoughts?  Edit to clarify my last sentence lol"

However, trust issues are something that you will have to work on for yourself. What is it exactly that makes you upset when you know she's texting your best friend? You've said you feel deeply that neither would do anything to hurt you, but something still makes you uncomfortable. Are you worried she'll like him more? That they'll talk about you? Or things they don't talk about with you? None of this? If you can identify the part that is upsetting, you might be able to work on eliminating that thought process when your SO interacts with other guys."

relationship_advice,3de78x,rainbowLena,3,Wed Jul 15 17:56:25 2015 UTC,"Losing her to what? To him specifically? Would it matter if it were someone you didn't know? Just losing her in general?   If it's the last one, then you're probably feeling pretty low in the self esteem department. Dude, she's already dating you. She likes you. She wants to be with you. Think of all the great times you've had together- you were part of that! Be confident in the fact that you're worth dating and she sees that! If she wanted to date someone else, she would be doing it, but she's not because she wants to date you!   You gotta let go of the shit that happened in the past. I just graduated college, and I literally talk to none of my exes from high school, and I can hardly remember the stupid shit they did to hurt me. I know it messed me up and hurt a lot at the time, but now I'm happy and in love with someone wonderful, and nothing that anyone did in the past can touch that. The same will be true for you! We aren't all the same, history won't repeat itself if you don't let it. If anything, use the shit that hurt you to make you a better person- you know what it's like, so you would never put anyone else through that."

relationship_advice,3dg5pn,Parrottwithopinions,2,Thu Jul 16 00:33:21 2015 UTC,"It sounds like there is some dependency on her part. Fortunately, I don't think it is anything serious at this point, but it still should be worked out.   You two need to have a conversation about this. She needs to clearly outline what she is looking for from you, and you need to clearly outline what it is that you want to have the time and ability to do. Make an agreement that works for both of you, this way there are no hard feelings when you stick to the agreement.   Just be realistic about where your priorities are. If I was traveling for a few weeks and got home, my first stop would be to visit my wife. Even if that meant I skipped the gym that night. The gym isn't going anywhere so I would rather show my girlfriend how much I missed her. Likewise, if going to the gym was important to me, I would let my wife know that it was part of my schedule so that she didn't get upset when I refused plans because of it."
relationship_advice,3dg5pn,StopStalkingMeB,2,Thu Jul 16 01:15:12 2015 UTC,"it sounds like she is feeling like something is wrong, and she's talking about it. This is good! I would suggest having a serious sit down with her and figuring out how much time she is expecting, because if she wants 24/7, and that's not realistic for you, then she needs to back off. On the other hand, if you're only giving her 50% attention a few hours a week, then it's time for you to adjust.   The first rule of relationships is to communicate. Often and seriously"
relationship_advice,3ddebv,Richardfoster366,3,Wed Jul 15 11:52:20 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar sitation quite recently. I developed feelings for my best friend of 3 years. In my eyes, she was perfect. About 3 months ago I tell her how I feel and she said she doesn't feel the same way at the time. I was devastated, and we lost contact for about a month. We didn't talk every day anymore, but in a month it was all over and we were back to being best friends. I still had feelings for her, but I locked them away knowing that she doesn't feel the same way. Now, she is affectionate. If you didn't know her well you would think she was flirting with every guy, so when I told her how I felt I thought she felt the same way based on how she acted with me. Well, 1 week ago she called me and told me that she has liked me for a 3 years now, she was just confused about how she felt towards her feelings as she was scared if commitment. We have been going out ever since that night.   Your story will be different. What I learned is that you just have to take risks in life. Go hang out with her and tell her how you feel. Tell her everything. She may feel the same way. Every girl is different. Honestly, if you really have feelings for her then tell her. You will feel better. Be prepared to give her time and space though. I mean, even if she felt the same way she needs to think this through. If she doesn't feel the same way then you should distance yourself for a little bit. Seriously, i did this and even though it hurt that I couldn't talk with her it allowed me to think it through. Remember, everything happens for a reason. If you a best friends than no matter how she reacts you will always be best friends, trust me. It will be tough. You have to work for true love. Sorry for the last post. Listen to your heart."

She soon started joking about it as well, and soon after that i started getting a little physical, hugging her and stuff, going slow with it. See her reaction, does she respond well? Soon after this i started kissing her on her cheeks and it finally led to the kiss. We are since in a loving relationship together.  Good luck."

I think it really depends on the time of girl tbh. Sorry to put it the hard way but if this girl doesn't want to talk to you because you have some feelings for her, she's not worth your time in the first place. What I would do is give her some time to decide how she feels, then tell her how you feel but don't put any pressure to date or anything unless she responds positively. And if you guys are still friends afterwards, it should be alot less awkward or anxious because your not trying to hide anything.  Good luck mate"

It'd feel better if you be truthful to her and yourself.  I was in sort of a similar situation as you 3 years ago with my current girlfriend. She was my best female friend for 2 years. She had a crush on another guy, and I have liked her for months. We were out one day when she asked me whether i had feelings for anyone. I lied to her and said that i had a crush on another girl that wasn't her.   I couldn't live with myself and it wasn't until months later when we went on a school trip together that i confessed to her and turns out she had feelings for me too.  I was really lucky ( the guy was sort of an asshole and she realised it ) but i know the feeling and regardless on whether you tell her the truth or not, things will never be the same because you would start to distance yourself from her, being afraid that you would ruin her relationship. ( at least for me )   So my advice would be to do it and do update us :)   All the best!   P.S. It could be good to ease into it ( try to find out how much she likes the guy etc )"
relationship_advice,3de36w,stoofsisnotgreat,2,Wed Jul 15 15:33:01 2015 UTC,"If he is gay, they're probably not sleeping together. But, that doesn't mean that you have to be comfortable with the behaviour you've seen. Tell him/her it makes you uncomfortable in a calm, adult manner, and that you'd like him to respect your relationship. As far as you thinking that she is cheating on you- you either trust her or you don't. If you think she is lying to you about who she meant to send the picture to, then you don't trust her and shouldn't be dating anyway. It could be that she just decided that because SnapChat is considered less risky than sending a MMS (even though it's not and doesn't actually always go away), it would be okay, since she stated she didn't want you to have saved pictures of her. IMO, that's irrelevant, because you don't seem like you trust her regardless, which doesn't bode well for your relationship, especially while you're apart. Good luck."
relationship_advice,3de36w,claireashley31,2,Wed Jul 15 17:00:26 2015 UTC,I think i'm just overreacting to be perfectly honest because this is my first love and I really don't want to lose her. I have spoken to her about and she has agreed to ask him to tone it down which is good for me as I tend to get a bit defensive around her. I will speak to her again tomorrow and keep you updated.
relationship_advice,3de36w,PleaseDontStalkMe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:25:01 2015 UTC,"I could speculate about the situation, but that would be worthless. What I will say is you should begin to learn now to have very frank and honest discussions with the people you're in relationships with. Get her face to face or on the phone and tell her about your concerns and ask her if it was meant for you. If you're convinced by her response, move on. If you're not, break up with her. The main problem is that you don't trust her and if you still can't trust her after you ask her directly, you might as well end it there. The thing is, if she's cheating on you there is nothing you can do to stop it, nor would you really want to. You don't want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with you. Be an adult and talk this through, otherwise it's just all paranoia."

My ex was my love and I miss him every second of the day. I decided to enforce no contact to protect myself from being drug back into pleading and bargining to save the relationship (which I always do). With that, however I cannot stop thinking that he has probably already tried to move on and that kills me. SO to combat the loneliness and feeling that I will never meet anyone again, I started to briefly look at online dating. Also I am looking at the same activities we did and he did because of course it is too soon and really what I am looking for is a clone of my ex because I miss him so much. I bet your ex is heartbroken and looking for anything that can make him feel better (ie. finding you again.) Its not the right way to do it but it might be the only thing that can make him feel a tiny bit better. But it doesn't work rather just makes you miss your ex even more."

The best advice I can give you then is to befriend a man in real life who is somewhat near your age and who is good at dating. Confide in this friend and ask him to mentor you.  edit: Also, confidence is universally attractive. Practice being confident by not being emotionally attched to an expected outcome. If  You are out to have a good time and stay positive; no matter how women react to you. That is the attitude to have. Try to dress and cut/style your hair in a way that most women in your country would find attractive and make sure you have excellent hygiene. Smell good but do not over do it on cologne."
relationship_advice,3de4hf,DelousedBeagles,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:08:54 2015 UTC,"Here's the deal: It all comes down to physical attraction and playing the odds. Not everyone is going to find you attractive, but plenty of people will.   For the girls who don't find you attractive: There is nothing you can say or do to change their mind. However for the girls that do find you attractive: They will make it very easy for you to talk to them.  Now, how do you apply this advice? Talk to everyone you share space with more than a few minutes. Get into a habit of striking up conversations with strangers. Then when you socialize with a girl you find attractive, ask her out. If she turns you down, move onto the next. Repeat as necessary.  It'll take some time and a lot of failure, but eventually you'll find someone.   In the mean time if you want to improve your odds, you'd be wise to optimize your appearance. Always look and smell your best, get plenty of exercise, and make sure you have a high opinion of yourself (insecurity is unattractive).   Also there are plenty of guides to flirting around the internet if you do a quick google search. Good luck."
relationship_advice,3de4hf,philosarapter,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:10:05 2015 UTC,"Woman here. If another of my kind doesn't respond to any conversation, asking of her name or general talk, she is telling you that she is uninterested. Do not take that to heart! Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and likes. It's not the end of the world to move on.  With that out of the way, one liners aren't really the way to go. Unless you are in High school, or a really crappy romantic comedy. They feel too fabricated -- which they are -- and don't show the woman anything about your personality, other than you are just trying to get at them with a sad line.  That being said, being genuine, honest, and remembering to smile, you can find someone who will talk back! It's all about finding the small line between creeper in the store trying to talk to her, and a decent person who they can talk to. Always remember to smile and use your best features to your advantage. Introspect what you think are your best qualities and make those shine.  Use what human beings inherently want, like being complimented. But don't be the overdone person who comments on how cute their dress is. Pinpoint things that are less complimented, like great skin.   All in all, it's the way that you present yourself to the world, both in appearance and demeanor. Remain upbeat, positive, friendly, and smile! Life is a grand adventure, and women want to meet someone who is ready to live life."

I would suggest telling your roommates you are leaving and offer to pay 2 months rent.  that will leave them with time to find a new roommate before they worry about the rent.  but bottom line, your name is not on the lease and you are not responsible for the apartment.  your roommates should have made the smart choice to have everyone on the lease.  if you have to go back to your parents for a few months to get your shit together, that's ok.  you don't have to have it all perfectly lined up before you make a move.  go home, get your mind right.  you can make some life decisions about school, work, where you want to live, whatever."

Look on rent.com or other rental websites to find a room, not an apartment, a room to share with someone.    OR!  I just read the bit about travel - look into teaching English overseas.  They will pay you to go overseas and give you money.  You have a degree, so you should be good.   OR!  Look into the WOOF program - Workers On Organic Farms. - You can travel around, live and work at a farm for a few months, then move on to the next.   Another good cheap way to travel.  After a couple of years of travel, apply for graduate school.  You will be older and have more experience and be more desirable because of your travels.     Make it happen!

relationship_advice,3dfuuw,paralloyd,2,Wed Jul 15 23:13:26 2015 UTC,"Good question for thought.  If Mickey goes:   + Chance at continuing the relationship with Mickey, since the trip is very important to him based on past events  - Mickey will make my old friend feel like a third wheel - I will further damage my friendships with Pluto and Donald - Since Mickey is not in good physical shape for the trip, I will have to curtail what activities I do to protect his feelings - Donald and Pluto will cancel, and I will feel guilty that I caused them to waste their time and money   If Donald goes and Mickey does not:   + Help rebuild friendships with Pluto and Donald + Donald and Pluto will treat my old friend well and no one will feel like a third wheel - Mickey and his friend will have to cancel their tickets and I will feel guilty that I caused them to waste their time and money - Except for how he treats my friends, I would prefer Mickey as a companion on a trip - I'm not sure I want to sacrifice a chance for continuing a relationship with Mickey - Donald is still hurt and may not be very civil to me   I guess i'm not asking to be told what to do, just for some objective thought on the matter, from an uninvolved third party.   Now that I look at this, it does seem to boil down to a choice that I knew I would have to face---do I value these several friendships more, or do I value a chance with a relationship with Mickey more?"

relationship_advice,3dfsw5,defiancy,0,Wed Jul 15 22:59:06 2015 UTC,A few months into marriage and counseling seems to be needed :/ I'm stumped on this one. I was hoping that maybe I just missed something.
relationship_advice,3dfsw5,eliza-jay,3,Wed Jul 15 23:22:59 2015 UTC,"Oh you definitely missed something here... This is not a normal reaction, so either he mentally unbalanced (not likely since you don't mention any other ""red flag"" behavior) or there's more to this story/fight than he's ready to share.    My suggestion would be to write him a letter or email, start off by being the bigger person and apologizing for your part in the fight (not for not swimming, just for allowing the fight to get this big) and ask him if there's a larger issue that you're not aware of.   Suggest that you meet and talk about it, or if it would make him more comfortable, you could each meet with a counselor separately and then together, to work through it.   Clearly whatever is bothering him is too large or scary for him to want to tackle it with you, so maybe offering some outside support might help him feel more comfortable.   It's not your fault that things are like this, but sometimes you have to be the first to give in if you want to make progress and get past this, because clearly something (real or imagined) is preventing him from doing it."
relationship_advice,3dfsw5,eliza-jay,2,Wed Jul 15 23:47:23 2015 UTC,"I sent him a message and called him, no response.

relationship_advice,3dfsw5,eliza-jay,2,Thu Jul 16 00:33:54 2015 UTC,"I agree, but at this point, you really have no choice but to wait until he's ready to give you that opportunity.   I'm honestly wondering if he's reacting this way in a hopes that he makes you so angry that you want to leave and end the marriage; it's passive aggressive behavior to the extreme if that's the case, but I really can't see any other reason to let such a dumb fight go on for so long and to absolutely REFUSE contact like this."

The best thing they do is teach you how to communicate with each other...seems obvious but it often isn't.  Also-the first year of marriage just SUCKS.  It does for a lot of people.

That's a pretty big danger sign. I totally agree with what others are suggsesting - consider counseling as a couple. There is absolutely nothing wrong with your husband having negative emotions from a fight, but his expression offers you (both) nothing to build and improve on.  My hope is that a counselor can teach him how destructive his running away from trouble is, while giving him new tools to communicate what's inside him safely.  That, and that you are given the same tools and both learn how to let the other partner express themselves safely. Understanding and empathy do a lot to build a relationship. Even when there is no agreement."

Someone who doesn't give any thought or effort into what affects you does not respect you. Here is what you do: tell him that it's over, because you refuse to be in a relationship that makes you feel like shit literally 24/7. Ask him not to contact you anymore. Delete his number from your phone. Block him on all social media. Inform your family. Inform your immediate friends. Don't fucking talk to him. My guess is he will try to convince you not to break up with him, because he's had it pretty fucking good for the last several months with someone doing everything for him with no effort on his part. He's full of crap and you deserve better.   I know it's hard, I did this kind of thing for two god damn years. It took a completely clean break for me to see how really miserable I was. You can do it. It's gonna suck and you're gonna do what I did (sit in the shower drinking wine straight from the bottle, then watch the South Park movie because it's stupid) and then you're gonna go work out, and then go out with your friends, and then you're gonna get better.

relationship_advice,3dfpks,GREENShouse,2,Wed Jul 15 22:25:53 2015 UTC,Sounds like an abusive or at the very least unbalanced relationship to me. Have you considered getting a therapist with whom to talk through your feelings and help you get a grasp on how to handle things?
relationship_advice,3dfpks,paralloyd,2,Wed Jul 15 22:31:19 2015 UTC,"I see the signs of emotional abuse but he feels so slighted because of all the wonderful things he does too. It's like Jekyll and Hyde. If I even mention he is out of line, he gets so offended. But he has been open to counseling. Unfortunately the last 5 were all terrible. One didn't offer one speck of feedback (just uh-huhs and ohs), one said ""let's go through Love Languages"", one went on about birth order, one was okay but he focused more on PTSD and how I could improve myself and be less sensitive. anywho, I'm determined to keep looking for a good one. Maybe I just need one for me at first and then add him in??"
relationship_advice,3dfpks,paralloyd,2,Wed Jul 15 22:44:09 2015 UTC,"Good to hear that he's been open to counseling! And what a terrible run of luck you've had with those therapists! I've done some shopping for therapists myself, and it's definitely disheartening, but I promise you that finding a good therapist is totally worth the effort. Have you tried asking around on a local forum for recommendations on a good one?  It sounds like a good idea to get one just for you first, if you feel the need to sort out your own emotions. If you feel like you are sane and emotionally aware, and your husband is the one with the problem, then it might be better to continue looking for one together. The downside to bringing him to your own individual therapist for couples' sessions later on is that he might feel like it's two against one, whereas the playing field is more level if the therapist is equally his.  Good luck!"
relationship_advice,3dfpks,paralloyd,2,Wed Jul 15 22:49:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much. I am spending a few days away to self-reflect. Ive been reading on emotional abuse and it hasn't been leaving me with any optimism. I still can't get him to understand that my body is mine. Its either I give it up, or there is a fight which only perpetuates the cycle of me not wanting to be intimate with him. I feel like a shell of a person with no real identity. I know I sound really naive when I say that he does have good qualities its just those qualities are less and less endearing. Well, today I am writing everything out and trying to put into words my feelings - which I suck at, ha. But maybe I can somehow shed some light..... thank you again"
relationship_advice,3dfpks,procrastirater,2,Fri Jul 17 19:41:11 2015 UTC,"You asked before about individual vs. couples counseling, and it sounds like you could really benefit from individual therapy. Feeling reduced to a shell of a person with no real identity is not a healthy state of mind at all. Good for you for wanting to stand up for yourself and to seek a more respectful and loving relationship. I think it's a good sign that he's been open to going to counseling with you. Maybe he's the kind who can easily fall into a pattern of abusing someone who lets themselves be abused (similar to how you might be the kind who can easily fall into a pattern of letting themselves be abused) but can grow if required to do so by a partner who demands respect. I hope the best for you both!"

relationship_advice,3dcop2,katorulestheworld,7,Wed Jul 15 18:58:40 2015 UTC,"Using the word 'crush' makes it sound so innocent. She's a 20-something married woman who tried to make a move on her friend's husband in private.

Before this, Amy had specifically instructed OP's husband to delete the texts between them and to not tell anyone about it (did you even read OP's post in full?). This all shows any of Amy's post-confession to Amy's husband or to OP has been out of desperation and a sociopathic need to still be respected by people she doesn't actually care about.    she *never acted on it""   Amy sending the message was acting on it. It was the first step and something she would have gladly continued had the husband reciprocated.   This isn't ""slut shaming"". This is just ""bad people shaming""."
relationship_advice,3dcop2,DuckGoesQuackMoo,-3,Wed Jul 15 19:11:50 2015 UTC,"You;re reading a lot into that. You would ask someone to delete the messages, that doesnt mean anything came of it, or would have come of it. Sometimes just confessing these things makes them go away.  If the husband really thought she was trying something on, he would have been clearer about that I think. Also he wouldnt be cool hanging around with her.  Not sure what your professional diagnosis of sociopathy is based on. Its pretty normal to respect, value and care about your friends (assuming you have any, if you dont I guess you cant relate).  Also not sure where you get the ""she would gladly continued"" from. There is nothing to indicate that at all. Also OP clearly states she didnt act on them, its your opinion that sending a message is acting on it - unless you know something OP doesnt it?  Assuming she's trying to wreck her best mate's marriages is assuming she's a cock hungry monster. Other then your own prejudices I just dont see the evidence for that."

The other day a friend confused (to my husband and didn't want me or her husband to know) that she was attracted to him. I seen the messages and naturally told my husband I seen it. As him and I don't keep secrets. We are very open to each other. And since I knew she told her husband.    +   I am very concerned about how she acted. She made it a huge deal when telling my husband. The whole ""I've got something to tell you but I don't want to tell you"" she had my husband begging her to tell her.

B) That bringing up these sort of feelings is taboo C) That the husband had an opportunity to tell his wife and did not  My wife and I receive each others' facebook messages regularly due to how our phones are set up. She also gets my emails. I wouldn't have an opportunity to tell her about such a message before she found out.     Edit: formatting
relationship_advice,3dcop2,confuciousdragon,5,Wed Jul 15 14:31:03 2015 UTC,"What motive could you have in telling someone about the crush? There is only one j to test the waters. You don't get rid of a crush by secretly talking to the person you're crushing on. That's just basic common sense.   It is taboo if you're in a monogamous relationship, talking to someone else who also is. I think we can safely assume that considering that the op posted in here in the first place.  The last point you have me on. In my opinion, if I received a text like that, I'd forward it directly to my husband and be like 'look what just happened'. I don't know the circumstances around what actually happened, so maybe he just didn't have a chance to tell her.  Edited - spelling mistakes, sorry!"

B) It is! Look at the problems caused by people expressing their attraction to unavailable but disloyal attached people. She brought it up to the least appropriate of the other 3 people involved. You'd think she'd tell her husband first, if she had to share it at all.  C) he didn't!"

relationship_advice,3dcop2,Gambit791,10,Wed Jul 15 13:06:51 2015 UTC,"Her confessing to your husband without you or her husband finding out was her way of acting on her feelings, basically testing the waters to see if your husband was willing to reciprocate or not. Now that she knows your husband doesn't share the same feelings and everybody knows what she did, she is drowning in guilt. Honestly don't know why you are being so cool, in her case the right thing to do would have been tell you and her husband first about how she was feeling or keeping silent on the whole topic till the feelings passed over, rather then approaching your husband and informing him of her feelings behind everybody's back. She acted very inappropriately imo, you should be concerned on how she acted, rather then making her feel better."
relationship_advice,3dcop2,Desi_Wolverine,4,Wed Jul 15 13:47:13 2015 UTC,"I am very concerned about how she acted. She made it a huge deal when telling my husband.

And the only way she would tell him was when he ""promised"" not to tell me or her husband, and that he would delete the messages between them. That is when a red flag went up for me. And I got Pissed.  And hurt. And felt so betrayed.  Her and her husband, and even mine keep telling me that her ""distance"" and not wanting to hang out last night and what not is her way of ""dealing"" with it. And that we need to give her her space. And I'm just like... Fuck that! If it's just a small attraction then she should be able to face us all at the same time. It feels like it was more then that to her and that is why she feels guilty and is hiding and it makes me more angry. Like I said. I'm more upset about the hiding then her telling him."
relationship_advice,3dcop2,Desi_Wolverine,2,Wed Jul 15 17:07:35 2015 UTC,"Be straight forward, that you have no intention of hanging out with her until she apologizes first and she promises to deal with it like an adult, you know by communicating properly rather then doing what she did. Also tell your husband in a clear cut manner how much this has hurt you and it may cost you a friendship, he needs to be more supportive of you. Tell him what if a friend of his hit on you behind his back, how would that make him feel. This is very serious, this should be taken seriously.

She texted him privately about it. She may be embarrassed OR it may be affecting her relationship and she doesn't want to be distracted anymore.

We all (my husband, her husband, and myself) seen it as a harmless little thing.  Her and her husband are going threw some hard financial problems and have been for most of the year, where as my husband and I have always made sure our money things where sorted out. My husband always tries to lend a hand when  we are around them. Like asking her if she needs help cleaning up after supper or giving her a hand with her baby. When he husband seems to just go sit down.   So in a way I can get why she would feel some sort of an attraction to him. He is a great man.   Even if she was just testing the waters, my husband was not into it. And her running and hiding was just the last straw for me. That and acting like she is the victim in all of it. That's just like... making me wanna punch a wall lol.    I know things will work out... Either we work pass it and save our friendship or we don't.  At this point in time I have asked for my space and will decide what I want to do.  Makes a person rethink their friendships. I mean. I thought she was my best friend.

relationship_advice,3dcop2,spotH3D,4,Wed Jul 15 17:24:05 2015 UTC,"Probably easiest way to execute that is to have your husband tell her he will not be having direct communications via phone, email, text anymore due to the weirdness out of respect for both of your relationships.  As far as face to face, no more one on one type for the same reasons.  That is called propriety, its old fashioned and it works to avoid infidelity both real and perceived.  From there you dial back them being together in groups as prudent.  Remember, she is the one who broke the group dynamic.    By the way, its fucked up if your husband hasn't already started doing the things in the first 2 paragraphs."

Thank you for the advice.  :)
relationship_advice,3dcop2,StopStalkingMeB,3,Wed Jul 15 17:57:53 2015 UTC,"I would completely stop hanging out with her and her husband, immediately.  Maybe you'll become friends again down the road.  Right now, she's made that impossible.  If your husband continues talking to her or hanging out with her, you should ask him why he thinks that's a good idea, and tell him it's not.  He shouldn't need this explained to him.  Let him know that being a ""softy"" and basking in this attention is causing serious problems in your marriage.  Ask him if maintaining a friendship with this girl who wants more from him is worth risking your happiness.  He needs to cut her out.  You need to tell him that has to happen.  Sucks most for the girl's husband, I guess, he lost two friends and whatever trust he had in his wife.  You can't pretend nothing happened.  If your husband fights you about hanging out with her, you have a problem."

relationship_advice,3dc2qo,KnowbodyYouKnow,3,Wed Jul 15 04:37:55 2015 UTC,"A little bit more background, please. Do you see this person once a day, twice a day, once a week? Are you on the bus for 15 minutes or an hour? Are your ages the same? Why do you have a crush? What's the attraction?  Edit: details and spelling."
relationship_advice,3dc2qo,KnowbodyYouKnow,9,Wed Jul 15 03:12:11 2015 UTC,"I've seen the person four times a week (Mon - Thurs), every week since around early June. I'm on the bus for about 20 - 30 minutes at a time. I've estimated his age between 25 and 35.  I do believe I have a crush, but the crush thing is all very recent. The first day I saw him and for a few weeks following, I actually thought he was a rather strict and inconsiderate bus driver. He got moody when an old woman with a walker got a free ride and then requested the loading ramp at the front only a stop later.  He also sets off the ""this is a fare paid zone"" alert whenever someone's electronic fare card is rejected, but walks on anyway. And I know it's actually him setting it off, since my grandmother's card is often rejected, and I've never heard that alert with her before (on a different bus).  From the beginning, I thought he was physically attractive, but I wasn't interested due to his personality. I don't know what changed recently, but these days he smiles at me when I get on, he remembers what stop I get off at, and he tries to press the button to open the back doors before I get the chance to press the door bars.  I just really want to get to know him better before he gets transferred to a different bus route."
relationship_advice,3dc2qo,Mister_Lady_C,4,Wed Jul 15 03:34:38 2015 UTC,"Hey, from a Bus driver to you, his attitude might not be generally bad... He probably deals with a lot of people that give him shit on a daily basis. He's got pet peeves (we ALL do) and it sounds like he's getting frustrated when people push those buttons... Again, we ALL do. Take some time talking to him a little bit. A nice hello and ask how he is. Start conversation with him... It gets lonely up in that seat. As you get to know a little more start asking about the bus stuff (example: scheduling often only last for three months before thins change around and the driver gets a new route... Find out if that's going to happen and when) and use that as an excuse eventually to give him your number to keep in touch or something."

I thought he was a jerk just because he wasn't nice like other bus drivers, but as time went on I realized it wasn't because he was a strict kind of guy or anything. I don't hold it against him. He's been nice, just in a different way I didn't notice before.  edit: basically I just stopped comparing him to my previous drivers and just saw him for him."

In a day or two you'll probably get a good idea of his situation. If he is married/dating, has kids, hobbies, free time, etc.   After a week or so just ask him he wants to get together.

She has no ambition or drive to improve herself, and you are looking for someone who does.  Coupled with the lack of good communication, it's no wonder you are having problems.

He has actually come a long way.... he also suffers PTSD and has been sober for 2 years now. We want this to work, we are not always ready to put all the hard work in to fixing it but I am confident that we will. The only thing is, is that for anything to be fixed it has to be first recognized as a problem (super difficult) and then hard work has to be put in to see a change. If she doesn't see a problem and doesn't want the relationship to improve, then I would say move on. Easier said than done, but you also need to be happy in life. I am in the same boat(ish) ....

On the other hand, your parents have a right to determine what goes on under their own roof and parents can be surprisingly conservative.  My best friend and her long term live in BF are in their late 30s and her parents still make them sleep in different rooms when they go to visit.  I say just ask your parents ""how would you feel about Jake and I sharing a room while he's here?"".  If they aren't cool with it, the key is to react like its no big deal that they want him in a different room.  If my theoretical late-teen daughter had any kind of dramatic reaction to me telling her I'd rather she and her SO were in different rooms, it would tell me for sure that she lacked the personal maturity to be in an intimate relationship."

relationship_advice,3dagu0,tawnirux,75,Tue Jul 14 23:43:35 2015 UTC,You're in an abusive relationship and you needed to get out of it 6 years ago. You're an adult and you don't have to do all of these things she wants you to do. Start recording and call the police if she ever becomes violent with you again. That will give you some time to move out while she's in jail where she belongs.  Apply for welfare and housing assistance and get yourself a job. Stay in a homeless shelter temporarily if you have to. Anything is better than where you're living now.  Do NOT give her any more money.
relationship_advice,3dagu0,Requi3m,21,Tue Jul 14 20:07:19 2015 UTC,"do you have any money saved up at all?  if not, first I'd look to getting a friend and asking them if you can stay at their place until you can get a job and move out. try to get a job as fast as possible - maybe 2 since it seems you don't have a college degree.   Being a waiter can get you some nice tips that you can save. Financially speaking, only take out the loans once you can start making payments - you don't want to ruin your credit by non-payment. it causes so many other shitty problems that you don't need.   but yes, if you are forced to take out the 3k loan, take it for yourself."
relationship_advice,3dagu0,orphan26,28,Tue Jul 14 20:07:43 2015 UTC,"Waiting tables is a great idea because you start getting paid right away. Not to be bleak but have you considered taking a bus, walking, anything to the nearest big town and just getting a bed? Yes I actually suggested spending a couple of weeks sleeping in a shelter, but fuck how could it be worse than this? I also will reiterate that you should not take that loan BUT if you do you should run with it (as you are unemployed I assume you will be immediately refused).  If you let this go on it will only get worse and it will be harder to leave every day."

Plenty of monsters make their way and rarely have to pay, maybe this is a little trolly but there is all kinds of weird shit out there. Even if this dude wasn't real, my heart still goes out. I come here just as much for drama and the joy of empathy as I do come to try and help someone. What's better is to question what gives you doubts, maybe something there.  Keep in mind that OP could have been raised by this woman, likely has been influenced, learned things about the world and how to act, from her. We can only question what their relationship is like in fine detail, and it can be difficult to have to hear that he might have to end up abandoning the woman to save himself. It's painful in many ways. He is 24 but he is also wrapped around this woman's finger, to an extent."

Change phone number. Create new email and use that to register for things in new city.  Make sure to take birth certificate with you. This will be hard but your mother is not acting like a mother.

You can not continue your life like this, otherwise all this destructiveness will eventually get you to the core. She is even willing to place debt in your name, this is criminal shit if I am not mistaken. There is something very wrong going on with your mother and she has encapsulated you in it.   You should check out the book In Sheep's Clothing: Understanding and Dealing  with Manipulative People by George Simon. Her screaming and all that, maybe this is behavior that has been enabled since she was a child and she gradually spiralled down into this set of 'tools' now; she at the least has some serious issues with delusion and I can only wonder what the source of her problem is. But you will have to not give in to her crap - is she going to retaliate and escalate things, like attack you? Is it safer to say nothing and leave her to be sick, so you can get out safe, or is there room to put your foot down and call her out on her shit before you eventually go?   Read that book! It is written by a doctor, meant for both professional and laypeople, it is knowledge which is practical because it is about behavior that even quite tamer people will attempt to use. My guess is that it will help open your eyes on some things or at the least help you gain some more conviction amd momentum for dealing with all your mother is throwing at you."
relationship_advice,3dagu0,PurplePlurple,3,Tue Jul 14 22:53:11 2015 UTC,1) Don't take out the loan under any circumstances  2) do you have any other relatives you can contact and talk to about this  3) Find a way to get a job-go to your local craigslist and see if there are any postings but be smart and be safe.

relationship_advice,3dagu0,supreme313,4,Tue Jul 14 19:44:42 2015 UTC,"From my perspective, you can get a college/student loan to pay for college classes, books, living expenses, etc. And not have to start paying until a certain date pending graduation.   You should definitely go to college, and look for housing and such. You need to look out for yourself, even if it means $10-50k in student loan debt. This isn't a cycle you want to be in. You're 24, and this won't get any better. Getting a salary 40k-90k and being able to pay off those loans within 2-4 years - is what 80% of the population does. School debt isn't that bad.   This means you can move out. You don't have to answer to her. You may want to consider getting a loan for a car through the same loan if possible. Make sure to live frugally as you do have to pay things back eventually. Maybe get a roommate to lessen the expenses. Try to get an internship in the field you're going for as they pay, and you can work part time. Even if it's helpdesk or customer service for a big company you'd want to work for.   Ge the heck out of that house. Don't tell her where you live. Change your phone number. Under no circumstances should you tell her where you live, or what school you attend. May as well make it in a state that you enjoy or that has good public transportation subways or buslines."

When I moved out it was like I'd never actually lived before. I didn't have someone telling me when to go to bed or how much of a bitch I am. The constant screaming and verbal abuse made me have panic attacks and in return believe you can only solve things by screaming louder. Now, I get to have calm rational discussions. I can go wherever the hell I want when I want without a 9pm curfew at the age of 24. Take that 3,000, get an efficiency apartment and do you. You have no idea how amazing you will feel. My mother still does a few things that bother me, but we can now have a conversation without getting into it. If I don't like how she treats me, I hang up the phone and ignore her.

relationship_advice,3dagu0,Arya_5tark,2,Tue Jul 14 21:44:02 2015 UTC,"You may need to get somebody near you who you can explain your situation to who will temporarily provide a helping hand. Perhaps a minister or community leader (and I'm not religious in the slightest bit - but a religious leader may be just what you need to get your life on track) who will listen to what you have to say and help you fix your life. I know everybody is saying take the $3000 and get an apartment and get a job, but it's not really that simple. I mean, you can't just rent an apartment just like that, they will ask for history and credit, etc. Not saying you wouldn't qualify but this would all slow you down. Any attempt for a quick escape would be foiled by paperwork. Another thing to consider, it's not like you can just rent an apartment and it automatically solves your mom problem. What's going to stop her from going to your next place of work and sabotaging you again? You could definitely get out, but you want to get out and get in a sustainable situation and not have to end up going backwards again. If you have somebody in your community, who understands your situation, and can help you out, that would be great.  Edit: or relatives"

relationship_advice,3dg0lp,Bobbyjoe27,2,Wed Jul 15 23:52:26 2015 UTC,"The good news is you're still young enough that your brain isn't fully developed and you have time to change. The bad news is that you suffer from a delusion common in men. You believe that when a woman isn't interested in you, then you just have to guess some sort of courtship password that will make her interested in you and you're home free.  Here are the rules, and the sooner you learn to live by them, the sooner you will be able to date much more easily by being a kind, decent and respectful human being, which is what people worth dating are attracted to:   When you express attraction to someone, do it clearly and in no uncertain terms, once, face-to-face, not in a letter. A good way to phrase it is, ""I'd like to take you out on a date."" Use the D-word so you can't be mistaken for trying to start a friendship. If you are rejected, you take it gracefully, with a smile and a nod. Act like the kind of guy who has so many other options that this doesn't sting at all, even if you don't feel it. (This does NOT mean say stupid cocky shit like ""I have a lot of other women so that's fine."" It means smile, tell her no hard feelings, and disengage.) Once rejected, do not in any way attempt to un-reject yourself. You cannot make someone be interested in you who is not interested in you. Maybe over time their feelings will change, but pursuing them aggressively after they've told you they're not interested will not help that happen. Most likely, they will never be interested in you. Upon being rejected by someone, don't attempt to maintain another kind of relationship (aside from a cordial ""Hi nice to see you"" acquaintance) until you are over them and in control of your wits around them. Take women at their word and don't try to guess what's really going on with them. This is a fruitless endeavor and just serves to torture you, while encouraging you to be a bad listener, which will damage any relationship you do start. Yes, sometimes people don't tell you everything! That's okay. People don't owe you a full and transparent accounting of their personal lives and thoughts just because you're attracted to them. Don't sweat it.   As for the current situation, download Tinder and look to meet other women. The best way to get over someone at your age is to get under someone else."

Ah, the ole classic ""it's not you it's me"" line.  He just said that because he's trying to be nice while breaking up with you but at the end of the day, he's just not that into you.    I'd suggest moving on with your life.  If he figures his stuff out later and you guys end up together that's great but you don't want to be waiting around for a guy to figure his life out while you miss out on your own."

relationship_advice,3dcq3f,Notarealname5,3,Wed Jul 15 06:22:51 2015 UTC,"While this hasn't happened to me, I suggest looking at it in this way;  each of you -could- divorce, go separate ways, and eventually find someone to share love with. The difference now is that you have history - baggage, memories, pain.   We don't hold strangers as accountable because we don't have a collection of stuff to judge them by. If you could each love strangers, you could love each other.    Like your therapist said, your wife was seriously hurt and might not be able to get past the historical 'stuff' between you.     She didn't leave you when you were pushing her away.   You can still love her - but you might not feel it back.   Perhaps she felt this way all that time.   Start by making the promise that you'll love her unconditionally, keep up on meds/therapy and whatever you need to, and you won't leave or ask for divorce...for at least the 5 years she gave to you.     That should sound damn scary.   You could be doing all this and still watch her walk away after that.  This is just a taste of what she might be feeling.   Your condition could make you unavailable at any point.     As someone also in treatment (depression, PTSD, anxiety...),  I'm mindful of how hard it can be.   I'm amazed that my wife put up with all my crap, but she did.   I know I can't control things around me...I can barely predict how much I control me.   I can try to look from the other person's eyes, and what my beliefs are.     Good luck...with all of it."

Dealing with the Bipolar symptoms has been very hard, but at least now I have a proper diagnosis and the right meds.  They don't cure me, but they help a whole lot.  I am still hopeful that she can see the benefit of staying with me and trying to work things out, but I think she still has that ""anywhere is better than here"" mentality.    To make things worse, she came to me this morning and informed me she had contradicted HPV, the kind that causes cancer.  As she was tested last summer (negative) and the only other person she has been with is the guy she cheated on me with it means she caught it from him. As she was still sexually active with me, I most likely have it as well.  Unfortunately, while she can get tested, there is no test for men and the type she contracted causes no outward symptoms, only cancer. SOOOOO, like you said. Baggage."

Either you got drunk and made out with a stranger while in a blackout state of your own making, or you're lying and you got drunk and made out with a stranger while still cognizant of what you were doing.

You called and owned up to it and told him right away. The best thing you can do now is wait until he chooses to contact you. Give it time for him to miss you. If you give him space he will come back if you had a loving relationship. You get big points for stepping up and telling him. Others will stand up for that. So give it time.

relationship_advice,3dejy7,datthrowaway87,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:34:15 2015 UTC,"Sorry, OP.  This sounds like a terrible situation.  How long have you guys been together?  It honestly sounds like she is using you, hence why she gets so mad when you can't afford to do fun things.  If she's in enough pain that she can't work, she sure as hell shouldn't be going out and having fun.  Playing hooky for a day or two is one thing, but a month and a half is irresponsible.  Maybe she really is in pain.  If the issue is that she is required to move around too much at work, then her employer should be able to make accommodations if it's not absolutely necessary for the job.  If she's a waitress or nurse, etc., then she needs to be looking for  a job she can perform.  Sitting at a desk all day requires not much more effort than laying on the couch all day. AND you get a paycheck.  If I were taking medical leave and asking my SO to support me, I would be very frugal with our spending habits.  Maybe use my time at home to coupon for groceries or look for small jobs I can do from home.  (Although if you're on medical leave, I don't think the employer wants you working for someone else while you're home.)  I would do whatever I could to help.  Tell her in the kindest way possible that although you love her and you want her to get better, it's not your responsibility to support her.  This is not something you agreed to do for an extended period of time.  If she wants to go out and have fun, she needs to find a way to fund it because you're already sacrificing a lot for her.  If she's too sick to work and take care of the house, then she's definitely too sick to go out.  And finally, if she is not actively looking for a job, then you're not going to support her other than the bare minimum.  (Unless you want to kick her out.)  I've been in your situation before with a SO who worked part-time by choice because ""he wanted more free time"".  Then spent his entire paycheck before I could use it to help with bills.  He would also get angry if I said ""no"" to any purchases.  It was childish and I ended up in thousands of credit card debt because of him.  I wish I had realized this early on and taken action."
relationship_advice,3dejy7,Aggie219,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:58:03 2015 UTC,"We have been together for a year and a half and have been living together for the past 7 months. My main issue is that i have little self-confidence and i do have a hard time standing up for myself. She said she'd help pay the bills next month because she's going to have money and i do believe her. The only thing i'm supporting is our bills, i don't mind if i have to pay the bills for a month or two, i have plenty of cash in the bank, but i am not A bank.   I can't endure someone who works part time to have more free time so i completely understand you. She had a mononucleosis last year and asked to work 4 days a week, which i find fine for someone recovering. But after this if she goes back to 4 days a week i'll call bullshit.  i'm starting to feel like moving out with her was a bad move, but this is the first actual issue we're having ever since we moved in. The only other argument we got into was over a year ago. So either i'm easy to manipulate, or our couple is one of those ""everything goes amazing but our fights are huge"".  One of the other things that really annoys me is i hate my job, i'm actively searching for a new one. i get frustrated everyday at work and it is affecting my mood. But i go. Every single day. Because i want a house, and i want to be able to pay the bills while not completely giving up my hobbies. I mean i have the mentality of ""i do what i have to do"". Of course i'm a slacker here and there, and i'm not the most proactive guy. But atleast I try.  How long were you with Mr. Part-time? How did you know it was time to break-up?"

It sounds like you might have started to lose respect for your GF...and then the resentment sets in (or it already has).

Moving in before you've even been together a year is really soon.   i'm starting to feel like moving out with her was a bad move, but this is the first actual issue we're having ever since we moved in.   Money is one of the biggest issues in relationships.  If you can't talk it out and come to an agreement now, it will only get worse.  Obviously you are frustrated and it isn't fair to be holding all of the weight right now.   But i go. Every single day. Because i want a house, and i want to be able to pay the bills while not completely giving up my hobbies.   This is what grown ups do.  You're being a responsible adult by understanding you have obligations.  You are actively looking for a job, but you're not going to quit showing up to your current one just because you hate it.   How long were you with Mr. Part-time? How did you know it was time to break-up?   We were together 3 years and moved in after 10 months.  (A huge mistake.)  His dad kicked him out (we were young) and I knew he would just end up staying at my place all the time anyhow.  I figured I might as well let him move in and help out with the bills. He eventually got a full-time job making more money than me, but I would constantly have to give him money or remind him to pay the bills because he was so irresponsible with his money.  We had a multitude of issues in our relationship that led to the breakup, but money was certainly one of them.   If you're okay with shouldering the burden for a few months until she gets back on her feet, then go for it.  As long as you believe this is going to be the end of it.  Like I said, she may be in pain, but it really sounds like a way to get out of working because she knows you're responsible and won't stop paying the bills.  But if she goes back to work and this happens again later on, I would end it."

It was the SAME guy that she cheated on me with (he is married) and they had been talking off and on, sending pictures, etc.... since she told me last time. So obviously she hasn't changed and I left her. Yes I am still angry but I am not trying to punish her, I want to get her into counseling so that maybe, just maybe, she can salvage and not have a revolving door of men in her life and my son's life.

I would follow the no-contact rules - in the sidebar. As soon as you reply to anything from her, no matter what she says, it begins the cycle over and over. No calls, no emails, no texts, no emails, no FB, no twitter, etc. Even if she wants you back, the only way you should talk to her is if she comes to your place. Which then you shouldn't damn answer the door.   She's dating someone else.

Right so if he's going to keep breaking up you need to stay broken up and you need to find another source of comfort. It isn't him, no contact or enjoy the train of emotional baggage.  If he can't get past it that sucks but he needs to make a decision himself, that's on him.   So no contact if you both can't stop back and forthing.    I'm not sure if his breaking up is irrational, or something he truly wants   In this case no it's not irrational, he just can't make his mind up.   It's over, it was over when you cheated and he couldn't get past it. This is only flogging the dead horse further.    I don't know how I can reassure him I've learned my lesson and cheating won't be an issue later on.   You can't, because he won't trust you and you still went there. I wouldn't be able to move past it no matter how much my SO proved his trust."
relationship_advice,3dd1jx,Captain_Corelli,2,Wed Jul 15 09:44:21 2015 UTC,"The fact that he created a fake profile to bait you into cheating instead of just confronting you like an adult about seeing your picture posted (on a dating app that he was on too...) leads me to believe that drama and manipulation are his tools. If you're breaking up, break up. Move on. Learn from what has and hasn't worked and apply that knowledge to be your best self in other relationships. If you want to work it out, go see a professional, together, and work out the issues that are affecting the way you treat each other.   Good luck! I hope it all works out for you both."

relationship_advice,3ddhgg,trowway1212121211111,2,Wed Jul 15 12:26:02 2015 UTC,"Dan Savage just discussed this type of situation on his podcast. You may want to listen to that.   Basically some guys are creepers and some don't know they are creepers and some do and don't give a shit.   Your girlfriend does need to shut him down and you can back her up, if she wants you too. Don't ride in like a knight saving a damsel in distress as that disrespects your girlfriends ability to deal with it.   However if she agrees you may want to tell the creeper he is being a shite and not only is he hurting women by treating them like this but he is also going to alienate himself because no one wants to hang out with a creeper.   Also ensure that you always look for enthusiastic consent. Meh does not mean yes and meh usually leads to meh sexy times."
relationship_advice,3ddhgg,Aucurrant,2,Wed Jul 15 17:36:56 2015 UTC,"what you have described does not sound like sexual assault.  A person can kiss another person without consent, and so long as they stop when it's made clear the other person does not consent, no assault occurs."
relationship_advice,3ddhgg,dandar4600,5,Wed Jul 15 19:02:15 2015 UTC,"Wait, your girlfriend went to a guy's place to hang one on one with and started kissing her and stopped after she finally told him to stop and you're calling it sexual assault because she did not actively consent?    In the real world you don't put up with a girlfriend that goes to hang one on one with another dude in his place. Don't try to make excuses for her shitty behavior. She chose to go with him and gave him IOIs that lead to him kissing her. He stopped when she told him to stop so it's not a sexual assault. Stop buying into feminist bullshit propaganda. Yes means yes doesn't exist in post-college world."
relationship_advice,3ddhgg,claireashley31,4,Wed Jul 15 12:44:01 2015 UTC,"So I agree that she fucked up and he stopped when she told him to, but I would like to say that not saying no is not a form of consent. Sure, you often know when someone is consenting (oh, you're actively making out with me and took off your own pants? Awesome you clearly want to do this), but there are instances where someone is afraid to fight/say no/scream etc., and so if you (the collective you, not you personally) are having sex with someone and they are not acting like they are into it, I highly recommend asking if they are okay/want to stop. While this likely doesn't apply to many situations where people are not trying to force themselves on others, it's still a good idea to remember that active consent is the best consent. That's not bullshit feminist propaganda, that's caring enough about the person you're having sex with to make sure it's mutual."

I think everyone can agree with that. According to Yes Mean Yes you are supposed to stop and ask for consent before holding hands, goin to first to second to third base and so on and so forth. That's not how human relations go. What you described is completely rational. We can tell when someone is into it or not. What op described is that the guy started kissing her before asking for permission. Now be honest, did any of your past or current boyfriends ever ask you for permissions before they first kissed you? I didn't think so."

relationship_advice,3ddhgg,Mysecretpassphrase,2,Wed Jul 15 14:01:16 2015 UTC,"This, PLUS you don't fight your gf's battles. It is HER job to deal with situations like this. In the real world of today there are tons of things in place to help women with harrassment of this type IF SHE WANTS. (hint, hint). All she has to do is pick up the phone and call the cops. She knows this, everyone knows this. She hasn't done so because she doesn't really feel threatened, she's just doing it to get you jealous.  If you go to the guy, you risk reprisal, getting physical, harrassment of your own. He could press charges on you for assault. Heck, you may even get shot, it happens. Not worth it, fight your own battles. Chicks today want equality - give it to her.  Tell her to put her big girl panties on and deal with it, OR LEAVE her, as you should because she was trying to cheat on you...dummy."

At first I thought you said he started kissing her, stopped and then raped her. I had to reread because I was trying to figure out why you were being so chill about it and not talking about going to the police. The title is a very misleading.  I don't think this guy gave any indication that hes a rapist, nor would I consider this sexual assault. They were hanging out together alone at her house and she never told him she has a BF. I don't think it's unreasonable that he thought she was interested and he went in for the kiss. I'm not sure what ""managed to get him to stop"" includes but I get the impression that when he realized she didn't want to continue, he dropped it. That describes how courtship works. I've never actually stopped and said ""is it ok if  I kiss you"". Typically it starts with some body language, and other physical contact and then it just progresses. Unless I'm missing something, I don't see any real threat here."

relationship_advice,3de4bs,Congzilla,2,Wed Jul 15 16:12:11 2015 UTC,Having any sort of contact with an ex as part of a relationship is not good. The fact that he deleted the messages says that he doesn't want to hurt you with what was said. And you did not over react  with him kissing his ex. You've been with this person for 4 years and have plans for the future so you asking him not to talk to his ex is well justified. It's time you tell him he makes a decision to be with you and respect your concerns or goes.

relationship_advice,3dbqp2,maqaddict,14,Wed Jul 15 01:06:40 2015 UTC,Seems like he was more concerned with having sex with someone than developing an actual relationship from the start. Take what you want from it but just don't expect to anything different from the first time around if you decide to get back together. I'd say just keep it purely sexual.

He's moving 130 miles away this Sunday and wants a 'goodbye' fling, then plans to boo us a hotel everytime he visits his family. Im very conflicted but im not sure if it will do more bad than good.

relationship_advice,3dbqp2,rainbowLena,4,Wed Jul 15 01:13:49 2015 UTC,"Do NOT agree to anything. You don't get out of a relationship to get into a FWB agreement. The point is, he let you down and you have reasons to not want to still be committed to him to stick by that. Let him now that you're focussing on moving forward and there will be no strings or future expectations attached to anything that happens. Otherwise you will end up having to essentially break up with him a second time. Now if you want to have sex with him for your own reasons and desires and not because of pity or duty or anything then go for it. Things didn't end badly and I assume you are both good at pleasing each other so why not. BUT make it clear to him that any instance should be considered a one off and there is no agreement or guarantee. If he is in town sometime he can message you and if you are both free you can meet up. If not, then it doesn't happen. Don't organise in advance."

He wants everything from you without having to give you anything in return.  It is super difficult (usually impossible) to be friends with exes, especially days/a couple weeks after a breakup.    He will keep stringing you along with the ""FWB"" thing, you won't move on with your life and seek out fulfilling relationships with people that will treat you well.  You'll just keep fucking him.  Edit: That's what breaking up is. You stop having sex. You don't talk to each other. You move on with your lives, improve yourselves and date other people.  Think of it this way: he's basically asking for a long, protracted even more painful breakup by continuing to be involved with you."

You will end up right back where you started with him, except worse, because you will have demonstrated he doesn't need to improve to keep you. Don't be weak because you miss him right now. Be strong! If you REALLY want to be friends, you need to go no contact. Not for a day. Not for a week. Not for two weeks.

The kid has guts.  And for the exact reason you said. Not only did he have the nerve to ask, but she entertained the thought. People in their 20's need to lighten up a little bit and just have some fun. You've got all of your 30's to regret it."
relationship_advice,3dbqp2,Eveningangel,2,Wed Jul 15 05:46:26 2015 UTC,"He doesnt have guts. He's either a complete piece of shit or fundamentally lacks the ability to see her as a human being or treat her with respect.  I dont think its ""entertaining"" that one person thinks its okay to use someone like this, or that anouther person thinks its okay to be treated like this. I think its sad, firstly because these people are probably representative of a large number of others and secondly there is no one in their lives who could have showed them how to treat others with kindness and respect. Sex is wonderfull and Im all for it, but you dont treat someone like a toy to be used and discarded like shit. I think its sad that young people are growing up thinking this is whats it like.  I think your ""entertainment"" comes from seeing a young woman being treated like she's less then human, especially as you seem to think the man is some kind of hero when he's really just an emotionally retarded cunt, and to be honest I think that stems largely from the fact that you're probably not getting any, and instead get some kind of thrill from seeing a young woman humiliated like this."

relationship_advice,3dabuu,MitziHunterston,13,Tue Jul 14 19:08:43 2015 UTC,"I agree. This sounds hormonal or possibly about the opposite sex, have you ever explored your sexuality beyond just having sex with men?   I am not assuming anything I am just offering up any advice I can think of.   There was a time in my life where i was not sexual for a while and I think it was the stress of college and life itself that took my mind to a place where I could not get ""into"" it. I DO get turned on just by looking at my fiance and always have but not all guys turn me on that way either! For me it's the emotional bond.   However, one relationship of mine started and ended the same way. Started out fun and I lost the attraction. Sex was still good but I was NOT interested. I ended it because he wasn't the right person."
relationship_advice,3dabuu,MissIpsaLoquitur,25,Tue Jul 14 21:20:20 2015 UTC,"It has come down to the stereotypical problem of him wanting it 3+ times a week, but I usually only give in once every month or two.    Woah, that's a mismatched drive if I've ever seen one.   I never get turned on or horny. I would be perfectly fine without ever having to have sex. It just doesn't interest me at all. It's too much work and I find there to be no point in it.    What has the doctor said when you went to them about this?  Was it always like this?   Now, don't get me wrong. This guy is an incredible lover and is super attractive.    Yeah, you might believe this, but I can almost assure you that he doesn't believe you think this about him. He probably has a low self esteem and feels repulsive.    You know how guys can get erect just from looking at a girl? I've always just assumed it doesn't work like that for girls. I've never gotten turned on by just looking at an attractive guy. In all honesty, I have no idea what turns me on or how to get to that point anymore. I've tried watching porn or reading racy novels (as others suggest) but I don't get turned on by them.    Um, it doesn't always work that way for guys. Some guys, as well as girls, are responsive. That means that it's only after fooling around a bit that they get into the mood. That's what it sounds like is the case with you.  You love the sex you are having, you just don't look forward to it. My advice would be to give in to him more - but then again, I can't figure out the disconnect between saying you are having orgasms and it feels great and you never wanting to have sex again.   Now days, I know this is really affecting him. He gets really sad about it when we kiss for a long time and goes to grab my butt and I flinch just a bit. He tells me that I get this look on my face, like, ""uh oh, I don't like this"". And that it makes him feel bad for offending me.    As I said, he probably feels repulsive and unloved. If his partner doesn't find him sexy enough to want him, who would?"
relationship_advice,3dabuu,Meatros,6,Tue Jul 14 19:37:12 2015 UTC,"I know that is the case: He has told me that it makes him feel unloved or unwanted. I try to do my best to reassure him that he is gorgeous and that I love every part of him. He knows my favorite thing is for him to lean over me (shirtless ;) ) when he kisses me because I can see his eyes and jaw and neck and shoulders. I love it! And I love touching his skin because its always warm and muscular. But none of that actually makes me want sex. It only makes me want him closer and to hug me. I like to kiss his neck. but it never crosses my mind to actually want sex. To me, kissing and touching are great, but are completely different than sex. Sex ruins the moment.  I know that no matter what I say, he won't feel any better until I can match my actions with my words. And I wish I could. I just don't like sex.  Also, I haven't talked to a doctor yet, but im going to soon. I've made an appointment.   And about the disconnect: to me, even though I do orgasm and sex feels great when we do have it, Its almost shameful in a way. I'm not saying that sex or orgasms should be shamed, but when admitting that I have orgasms, I think, ""Okay, yep, I had one. Lets move on please. Thanks.""....  Its not something that I care to take pleasure in. And I honestly don't know why. If he were to come up and say, ""tonight is going to be all about you. I want you to lay down and relax. I'll do all the work so you can enjoy yourself,"" I would rather not. I would much rather leave the house and avoid the situation all together. Just please, no."
relationship_advice,3dabuu,Meatros,20,Tue Jul 14 19:57:10 2015 UTC,"I know that is the case: He has told me that it makes him feel unloved or unwanted. I try to do my best to reassure him that he is gorgeous and that I love every part of him. He knows my favorite thing is for him to lean over me (shirtless ;) ) when he kisses me because I can see his eyes and jaw and neck and shoulders. I love it! And I love touching his skin because its always warm and muscular. But none of that actually makes me want sex. It only makes me want him closer and to hug me. I like to kiss his neck. but it never crosses my mind to actually want sex. To me, kissing and touching are great, but are completely different than sex. Sex ruins the moment.   Imagine if he never wanted to lean over and kiss you, to touch your skin, to look into your eyes. That he didn't feel anything when he did those things and they felt unnatural and forced.  How would you feel? Because that's what he's feeling in response to your feelings about sex. What you get from his affection he's getting from sex with you. When you withhold sex from him it's the equivalent of him withholding that affection from you.   I know that no matter what I say, he won't feel any better until I can match my actions with my words. And I wish I could. I just don't like sex.   Well, right, because words without actions are fairly meaningless. I'm not even sure what you mean when you say you find him sexy since you clearly don't want to have sex with him.   Also, I haven't talked to a doctor yet, but im going to soon. I've made an appointment.    You've been with him 4.5 years, gone through it for this long, and only now you are going to go to a doctor/and or sex therapist?  That's gotta hurt.   And about the disconnect: to me, even though I do orgasm and sex feels great when we do have it, Its almost shameful in a way. I'm not saying that sex or orgasms should be shamed, but when admitting that I have orgasms, I think, ""Okay, yep, I had one. Lets move on please. Thanks.""....   That's very curious, if the doctor can't pinpoint something, you should see a sex therapist because you shouldn't feel shameful. You should be proud of your orgasm because I sure as shit believe he's proud he's gotten you off. For guys (well, the ones that care, that is) it's better than getting off ourselves to a large degree.    Its not something that I care to take pleasure in.   The way you phrased this is interesting to me. Why not? I mean, I interpret you to be saying something akin to this (so please, correct me if I'm wrong):  Every time I eat Sushi it's the best stuff on the planet. That said, I really don't ever want to eat it. I'd be happy with never eating it again. I'm a bit embarrassed that I like eating Sushi as much as I do, I'd rather have tacos, even though tacos aren't as good as Sushi.  That's how I interpret what you've said. What are your thoughts?   And I honestly don't know why. If he were to come up and say, ""tonight is going to be all about you. I want you to lay down and relax. I'll do all the work so you can enjoy yourself,"" I would rather not. I would much rather leave the house and avoid the situation all together. Just please, no.   I'm puzzled by this and if I were him I would be very disappointed, maybe even hurt.  Let's just hypothesize for a minute: Let's suppose he did exactly this and you allowed him to. So he lays you down and it's all about you for as long as your body will physically allow. How do you think you'd feel?"
relationship_advice,3dabuu,BigAngryDinosaur,3,Tue Jul 14 20:32:50 2015 UTC,"It's kind of thin, but can you expand on the feelings of shame?  I'm not sure how religious your upbringing was, but were you exposed to any type of sex-negative culture as a child?  Is it possible that your hormonal horniness overcame some pretty serious shame that was ingrained, and now that you're past the young honeymoon phase of the relationship (and you're not a teenage anymore) the hormones are no longer overriding?  Also I haven't seen it asked yet, but are you on hormonal birth control?  If so, can you medically cut them out after your next period and give it another 1-3 months to see if that improves things?  If you search you'll find literally tens of thousands of stories of women whose sex drives disappear while on BC."
relationship_advice,3dabuu,Randomredditacnt,4,Wed Jul 15 02:56:21 2015 UTC,"Doctor. Check hormones, medical issues, if you're medications that may be effecting you, or if you should be on a medication. Therapist. Check under the hood. See if you have a psychological issue that's a barrier to your enjoyment of sex. Acceptance. If all the above checks out, then you're just not wired for sex the same way as some others. You have to accept this about yourself and forgive yourself for it. If you can't change it, you can't change it. It's not your fault. Some of us are born with big feet, some of us have taste buds that make Brussels sprouts taste revolting. (look it up.) Point is, there are sometimes things about yourself that are uniquely you and not likely to change.   Your big problem though is going to be your boyfriend and your relationships in the future. You're going to either: feel massively guilty and make yourself suffer to make your BF happy, leading to you becoming unhappy, and him developing horrible hang-ups about sex which may damage his attitude towards healthy sex, because you cannot hide your displeasure no matter how hard you try, and he'll never know the pleasure of being desired in that way.  Alternatively, you're going to feel massively guilty if you decide to break up because of it. There's no real winning strategy here if you're asexual or somewhere on that spectrum. Whatever happens will hurt for both of you because you both are possibly wired to want different things. But it's also not fair for either of you to suffer on and on in a situation that is making you both unhappy with no prospect of change in the future. You need to talk it over like adults if there's no medical solution. It will hurt but it doesn't have to be the worst thing ever, and once it's on the table, once you can both talk about it and accept that separation might be best for both of you, without animosity or anger, then it becomes easier to consider and deal with."

Some people, like myself, absolutely must have some amount of mutually desired sex in a relationship or I'll basically assume it's a friendship and nothing more, and then I'll get turned off to the entire relationship."
relationship_advice,3dabuu,Meatros,6,Wed Jul 15 00:49:42 2015 UTC,"Have you considered talking to a sex therapist about this?  You begin your story by talking about how completely disinterested in sex you are, which would argue for asexuality, but then you talk about experiencing sexual attraction, and how good in bed he is, and you actually do enjoy the sex. But the language you use in describing the aftermath is of pure avulsion and you need to run away from this situation as fast as possible.   IMHO, that sounds more like negative conditioning on sexuality than asexuality, such as trauma or a very sex-negative conservative upbringing. The latter might explain the indulgence-guilt-flight cycle."

I'm a little embarrassed about these, so i'm going to make it short: Not my family, but I personally have always wanted to wait until marriage or until I found the person I want to be with forever. Those were my strictly held morals as a child. I've always stuck to those Ideals until early high school. I met a boy that was 17 at the time we dated for 4 romantic months until he pressured me into doing it for him. The next 1.5 years we did it nearly every day (though I was unwilling) because I was too afraid to say no or to get help. I asked him one day what he would do if I said I didn't want to have sex for a little while. He said he would ""dump my ass"". So while he was out of town, I called him and broke up. I haven't seen him since. My current boyfriend (just a friend at the time) asked me what was wrong in school the next day. And now he is my soul mate.   My bf knows all of this and we have gone through a lot of trouble together. But I feel as though I've gotten over a lot. I feel safe around my bf and he has NEVER pressured me into anything. I want to give him the world and make him feel just as loved as he makes me feel. But now I just have a distaste for sex altogether and need this to stop"

The problem that we are trying to fix is why I don't want it, ever. Even when we do have sex, it doesn't seem to fix our problem.   Its quite easy to just do it. We get naked, he inserts, I wait until he's done, we get dressed and move on with our lives. That's what it's like if I ""just do it"". It's plain awful.

relationship_advice,3dbh8j,schizomother,17,Tue Jul 14 23:53:35 2015 UTC,"Psychotherapist here - I am assuming you are in the US for this. You have 4 basic options, and they all have their downsides:   Attempt to contact the physician that prescribes her psych meds and fill them in on the situation. This assumes that they will even talk to you (which they can technically refuse to do for confidentiality reasons). Get your mother to a hospital ER somehow. Unfortunately, she has to agree to go under her own volition, and even if you are able to get her there for a psychiatric eval, if she's 'on her best behavior' during the eval, the clinician may not have sufficient reason for an involuntary admission. You and at least one other witness would have to file a petition in probate court. This can take time, money and a judge that agrees that your mom is incapable of caring for herself or a danger to self or others. Get out of the house. Unfortunately, sometimes the only way to force an unstable person to destabilize enough to become enough of a risk so that law enforcement MUST become involved is to remove the support system. In a sense, your presence is enabling your mom's craziness, since she's protected from the natural consequences of her behavior.   There are no easy answers here. My biggest suggestion to you is to find some friends and family immediately that can be a support system for you as you are deciding how to proceed."

As sad as it is, it's better to let her crash and burn and to then help her pick up the pieces. She will still trust you and will be open to medication after she's hit rock bottom.  Sorry OP I'm going through the exact thing currently and have been in cycles with my mom's mental health for 28 years. They never seem to really stick with the meds.

The other best thing, and they're not mutually exclusive, is for you to LEAVE NOW. Get out of the house and get yourself therapy, even if you don't think you need it. You probably feel responsible for your mother, but you aren't. If anyone is responsible, it's your dad. He shouldn't be trying to push that off on you. He is talking about putting drugs in her drinks because he's desperate and irresponsible. If you feel up to it, have one final talk with him about how he needs to stand up and be an adult.

Think about your mother's health. You are a great source of support for her, but you're also enabling her to carry on as she is when you know for sure she needs to be on her medication, and that doesn't help her in the long run. Right now, you know for a fact that she isn't well. She's saying she'll never talk to you again for authorizing a compulsory hospitalization. Don't take what she's saying seriously right now because she's obviously not in the right state of mind. Keeping her happy isn't the same as keeping her sane/healthy. Which one is your main priority?  That compulsory hospitalization is the best thing for you to do for her because it's an actual step in the right direction health-wise. Once she's better, she will understand that it was for the best and probably be very grateful that you helped her."

If that is to join you on the trip, tell her. If that is to remain together while you are away, tell her. Then ask her what she wants. Tell her that your freedom isn't dependent on being with her. You can do the things you want without hooking up. Tell her that is not what you are interested in. Reassure her that you only want her.

If you aren't satisfied, and talking to him about it in a serious way to try to work out some type of compromise that makes you both happy doesn't work, then maybe this just wasn't meant to be. It all depends on what value you put on a healthy sexual relationship. Just don't feel bad if sex is very important to you, because it is to a lot of people."
relationship_advice,3dckr3,StopStalkingMeB,3,Wed Jul 15 06:13:23 2015 UTC,Sex is a major part of any intimate relationship.  So now you know you have mismatched libidos.  The question is are there other things that you are mismatched in that being in a LDR masked.  Living with someone you sometimes find out things you really didn't want to know.  Are you staying in the relationship because every thing but sex is great or is there a litany of things that bug  you but sex is the one that's bugging you now.    So maybe it's time to have that sit down talk about whether you should be staying together.  Because everyone has a limit to the number of things they compromise on or should compromise on to stay in a relationship.

I know this may be hard to actually know, but some people develop an unhealthy relationship with porn that can effect their sex drive with their partner. Might be an explanation?   Apart from that all I can say is never feel stupid for what you feel or need from a partner, sex is very important to a relationship, some more than others but if it is to you then it's worth pushing for too discus more. If he doesn't budge or listen to your concern seriously there is always couples counciling or sadly maybe he's not right for you."

relationship_advice,3dckr3,MissIpsaLoquitur,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:00:46 2015 UTC,"If you really are looking for honest advice and not people telling you to cheat on your boyfriend, since I think it's no laughing matter and it obviously means a lot to you, I would suggest reading the book, ""Venus on Fire, Mars on Ice."" LINK HERE: http://www.amazon.com/Venus-Fire-Mars-Ice-Hormonal/dp/0978279735 and I would get the kindle version and have iphone read it aloud to you when you have alone time if you don't like reading. It's a Mars/Venus book from the writer of Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus.   I learned a hell of a lot from this book. I would suggest learning more about your man. Yes, I am sure you know more about him than anyone else, but many times we know ""things"" about people but we don't really KNOW people. Even in a long term relationship I was almost clueless about how a man's mind works and how different we are.   I am not assuming anything here okay, so please don't take it the wrong way but sometimes men get bored, and women get bored too. He may need something more to look at. Do you change up your look often? I change mine at least once every 6-12 months and have had several long term relationships, none of which ever ended due to boredom in a Dead Bedroom. You could change your hair, get highlights, go to MAC and get your makeup redone and buy all the products to do it yourself. Change something. Anything. It arouses curiosity and brings new-ness to the relationship.   You may be thinking ""why is this ALL ABOUT HIM!!"" he's the one with the problem and that may be true ""right now"" but everyone has different ways to get their buttons pushed. You want to push his right so he pushes yours :)   Do you experiment in the bedroom? have you ever talked about your sexual desires? Do you text him dirty things during the day to get him going. I do all this with my man and let me tell you, it works. It's almost necessary in a long term relationship.   Adding kinkiness, outfits, sex toys and changing your look is exciting. It gives a man some incentive to get to work. Watch some porn and get some new moves down to try on him. Surprise him with something you would not normally do and make him feel like he is with a new women.   We are creatures of habit. Break it.   Let him come to you too, and he will. If you read that book, concentrate on understanding him more and changing things about yourself, you can start making him crazy for you. I tried this and it worked. I would dress sexier than usual, just in a tight, short skirt on a normal work night and high heels... it caught his attention, he asked where I was going and I said, no where. I said ""I just thought I would wear something a little sexier tonight.""   Then, instead of telling him I WANT SEX, I would flirt, remember those days? When I walked near him I would gently touch his arm or his waist, when I went to grab something (on purpose). I would bend over seductively and I would dick tease him.   I would not pursue him, instead I would touch him lightly here and there and sit and walk and stand in a sexy way. Going out is even better because you can play this game ALL NIGHT and he will be horny and ready to give it to you when you get him aroused with all the teasing. Then when the time comes, go slow... touch him in the places you may not usually take your time on. Talk dirty.. and make it all about him but of course.. you will be enjoying yourself as well.   It works wonders."

You just have no idea.  There's no pre-strategy to this.  And they're going to feel awkward too.    I think it's okay if you tell your girlfriend that you don't want to be seeing people who knew about her affair and didn't tell you.

I guess you know what those people think of you: someone who can be treated with deceit, and no one owes you the courtesy of a heads up.  I would treat all those people as people who care nothing about you, because that is what they demonstrated with their lack of action in regards to the prior infidelity.  You think they don't owe you loyalty, and apparently neither does your GF, but what you are really talking about is the simple courtesy of not letting someone you know well (after 10 years, I assume they knew you well) get treated like crap.  I would never think of them as friends or family again.  At best, they are like coworkers who once stabbed you in the back, but with whom you have to continue working due to life circumstances.  Don't trust them.  Don't feign friendliness. Don't provide much in the way of of social outreach.  They are just people you know.  That is what they did to you, and until they make real amends (not some half-assed explanation or short apology), you can be damn sure they will do it again.  You should also seriously reconsider whether you should date a woman who broadcasts her infidelity to others, but didn't bother to let you know that third party sex was now on the menu...at least for her.

So, if they were witnessing something bad, they wouldn't just let it happen.  To put it in another context; if your GF was robbing you everyday and they knew about it, just scolding her is obviously not enough. They are practically complicit if they don't tell you.

She had steadily been growing closer with her coworker and he made her feel special and at some time earlier this year she ""crossed the boarder"" of just friendship and something more. She says that the feelings popped up and wouldn't go away.  I accept what she said as truth because it felt like in our conversations about the affair/our possible future, she was 100% honest, that she hated what she did and that she didn't understand why she did it.

My wife and I have a mutual friend we hang with occasionally, and when we make plans, the friend just deals with one of us, not both, so signals don't get crossed.  If your fiance is actually accepting this invite and going out alone, then he's the jerk -- you two are a unit, it should always be assumed that when one's invited, the other is too.   The original friends here are not the 3 of them, it's just the men. Your fiance only knows the wife through the husband. Same way the husband knows you.

If you were going to say no, why make such a big fuss about it?  Bottom line, you guys need to sit down and have a serious discussion as opposed to what you guys are doing here, which isn't solving anything. Communication is key in any relationship, and it's seriously lacking in yours, which can only lead to bigger problems."

I stopped asking a while ago bc the answer was always no. This time (a rarity) we're going to see a band my friend and his wife both enjoy so they are going together.   Fiance doesn't give two shits until she finds out the wife is going then says ""So, I'm not invited?""  I respond by saying ""I didn't think you were a bandweregoingtoseetonight fan""  She says she isn't a fan, but thinks its weird that i am going with another couple without her.   Not sure why that is weird so I then ask if she wants to go... she declines.  Not sure why this is such a big deal..."

relationship_advice,3da85d,sparklefades,15,Wed Jul 15 01:56:00 2015 UTC,"While I get your point of view, the fact that his wife was going does change the dynamic of that get-together.   To you, going out was about a band. But for her, she could have wanted to go, even if she didn't like the band, just because of the group dynamic.   It's not ""crazy"", it's just a different way of evaluating a social outing.   If you and your fiancée invited your friend out, in an instance where it's almost always just you, maybe his wife declines to come, but chances are he would ask her first because the situation changed."
relationship_advice,3da85d,MsAnthropic,15,Tue Jul 14 23:47:42 2015 UTC,"The fact that your fiancée is hurt enough to be reaching out to internet strangers about dynamic in your relationship that is making her feel excluded and hurting her feelings and THIS is your response is pretty troubling. The fact that you think this is about your fiancée liking or disliking a band is troubling.   ""Not sure why this is such a big deal...."" REALLY?   You just one hundred percent dismissed and invalidated your FUTURE WIFE'S feelings. Being treated like this would make me feel like garbage and you definitely need to work on your communication and conflict resolution skills.   I second pre-marriage counseling. Yesterday."

You're dismissing her.   I get that you would stop asking if the answer is always no, but I also see her side that if she knew that it wasn't just dude's night, she might want to go because she might have more fun."

relationship_advice,3da85d,missmisfit,2,Wed Jul 15 14:01:26 2015 UTC,"I have been in the exact situation as you with my bf and a good friend of his and his partner. I wasn't always included and when we were all together, it was quite obvious that they were not as interested in me or anything I had to say. It was a subtle thing, just not as interested or inquired any deeper into a conversation with me. There were also 'in' jokes which I felt left out of. It went on for months whilst my bf would continue giving explanations and reasons much like everything else said here.   One night after few drinks I decided to go to bed early while they stayed up drinking. At one stage a woke up and went to the toilet and over heard the partner of my bf's friends telling him that 'he could do much better' and I should add at this time that he was very very good looking. He also mentioned that they had someone they wanted him to meet. Of course the realisation of what had been happening was devastating because I really loved my bf.   The reason I mention it here is that if your bf and his friend were good long term friends, it very conceivable that they've had a similar discussion about you. It would explain the things that are happening with you?   How did my story end? Well our relationship ended when he went o/s for an extended period. We kept in touch via mail but his friend and partner never made any suggestion that they would keep in touch with me even though we lived in the same city. I know we shouldn't jump to conclusions but there's a lot of similarity in your situation. Best wishes."

Do you want to see if he and 'wife' want to hang out this week?"" and the response is usually vague or just, ""Eh, maybe.""  I have also asked if this particular couple doesn't like me, because I get along great with the rest of his friends, and they always invite both of us to various events/parties.  I have no idea why this only happens with them, or why there is no explanation as to why I am excluded when both members of the other couple are going to be there."
relationship_advice,3da85d,1wf,3,Tue Jul 14 19:32:47 2015 UTC,I would straight up call them and invite them to dinner. Bypass your boyfriend so you can figure out where the issue is.   Invite them twice and if they don't reciprocate then let it go.
relationship_advice,3dcq38,juuuunkacct,6,Wed Jul 15 06:22:49 2015 UTC,You are both wrong.   F shouldn't have made promises she wasn't willing to keep. M shouldn't have allowed his insecurities manipulate F into not drinking.   F needs to learn how to drink responsibly and prove every time that she is capable of doing so. M needs to stop trying to be so controlling about what F does.   M and F need to work together to learn how to resolve problems rather than causing them to escalate with empty promises and insecurity based manipulation. They need to talk about relationship boundaries and come to an agreement on what is and is not acceptable. The only way that will work is if both people are honest and happy with the final solution.

We had serious talks about it when things needed to change, but the important thing was that we analyzed the situation and set limits for ourselves that would work for us. It would not have worked if either of us had tried to set rules for the other. We had to be honest with ourselves because while it's easiest to say ""I just won't drink"", it sucks and is not very realistic. It's like starving yourself to lose weight instead of eating healthy. You may start out fine, but your gonna crash and burn. I also found that I needed a concrete number because as I drank, I wanted to drink more. I set my limit at 3 until I learned to drink responsibly.  I do occasionally get wasted and do something stupid, but things are much better than they used to be."

When my SO was out of state for a year, I hated talking on the phone, in fact I hated any communication because it made me sad. We came to the agreement that we would text each day and call when we where on the way to see each other.   I would tell your gf that you will talk each day for 30mins, tell each other about your days and any plans you have, when the conversation goes quiet, you can text each other.  As for the sleeping patterns, make sure she (at least thinks) is the last and first person you message before and after rest. Tell her anything more is liable to make your grumpy and you can not be held accountable for things you might say if you don't get your 2-9 each day.  Plan a special thing for her, maybe a Skype night. Or send her some flowers at random. The cupcake phase may be over but you can still be romantic and make her feel special. Hope it helps!"

She honestly is the first and last person I message every day, Its just that I prefer messages because im more comfortable with it. Id be content with giving her my every hour free if it meant we weren't sitting silently over an awkward phone call.  I think out of all the problems we have, the phone calls are probably the smallest of them. Its really the last point I made about persistent brawls that worry me the most. Im going to try the suggestion you made, about putting in extra effort to be more romantic. Maybe if I do that she'll have a more favorable attitude. (Did that last line come off as offensive? It wasnt meant to just in case)"

I'm willing to bet she was upset because you told her you didn't want a relationship with her and then you're wanting to be with this other girl, so now she feels like you were using her and she probably feels like a piece of shit since you specifically said you didn't want to be with her. She probably had some feelings for you, and thought you meant you just didn't want a relationship. But now that you've displayed how much you want to be with your One, she feels like crap because she thought you at least liked her a little bit.

She might have thought if she waited and gave you her body long enough you would figure out you want her too. She was in a relationship that you weren't it. You basically just broke up with her and you didn't even know you were dating. She will get over it. You did right OP, you couldn't go out with this other girl and keep your fwb.

I would never, ever do that either – reasons you've already expressed aside, some people consider that to be a pretty personal question, and he could interpret that as a sign of bad judgment on your part. At the very least, that kind of directness can be off-putting. But if he's a cool guy and you'd be happy to be friends with him regardless, why not just work on letting a friendship develop for the time being? Once you've spent some more time around each other, he'll probably feel more comfortable talking about himself (and perhaps his romantic life), which could give you some clues.

relationship_advice,3dcbur,smak7462,12,Wed Jul 15 03:58:36 2015 UTC,"what do I do now?   Continue apologizing and proving to both your fiance and his sister that you made a mistake, learned from it, and will never even consider doing anything so thoughtless again. Then you work on yourself. This means figuring out why you felt the need to write a message to his sister with tones of superiority and make it from him. Then fix it.   What should I expect?   You should expect them to think you are untrustworthy and incapable of making intelligent decisions. That is why you need to prove to them every chance you get that you can.   I would add, that if my fiance started writing rude notes to my family pretending to be me, she wouldn't be my fiance any longer. So there is always that possibility as well.   What will my Sister In Law think of me?   Same as above. She won't think highly of you because you've proven to her that she shouldn't. Now you need to put in serious efforts to change that view she will have of you.   A part of me wants to say my fiancé shouldn't have told his sister because I can apologize and correct matters with my fiancé but not as easily with my sister in law.    You should figure out what part of you that is and cut it off because your fiance has absolutely no blame in this. You should figure out why you feel entitled to blame your bad decisions on him because if you don't resolve the part of you that is causing that, your future isn't going to be very good.   What should I expect now?   You should expect to put a lot of effort into rebuilding the relationship with your fiance and his sister. Proving that you are trustworthy. And most definitely a lot of self-reflection on this immature decision."

I cannot imagine the breach of trust if my SO did anything like that. You don't really seem to grasp the severity of it. It's not just bitchy, you actively did something that was destructive to both your relationship with your fiancé, with his family and his relationship with your sister in law. Not a great way to start a marriage.  If I were you I would talk to the sister in law in person, and hear how she feels about it all. It might be hurtful, but it would give you the best chance to know how it effected her and thus how you can work on making it up with her. Good luck."
relationship_advice,3dcbur,spikypsyche,2,Wed Jul 15 09:14:24 2015 UTC,"Apologies mean nothing until the party they are offer to understand that you are honest and understanding of the wrongness of your action. Until they believe you are, you aren't done apologising. It is on them to accept your apology.   From what you write you show no knowledge or understanding of why you did what you did; you just got caught and feel bad for it. If you understand why, you need to inform them as well as show acceptance over your shortcomings in acting the way you did. It is not what ever part they played in setting up this situation - you can not justify your actions - but showing responsibility and understanding of your flawed reasoning.   Only then can they forgive your actions when they genuinely believe you will not go anywhere near acting the same way again."

I can see you doing something like that within a 'funny context', which would still be immature but at least not offensive.   You seriously lack good decision making skills and if you think this won't spill onto other parts of your life, you are mistaken. I suggest you talk about this in therapy because the fact that you even think your fiance shouldn't have told his sister what you did shows that you are not truly sorry and you are blaming him...again, another example of your poor thinking.   How to think better...THINK before you act on your thoughts. If you are not sure what you are doing is right, ask someone who makes good decisions first."

GTFO and find a better relationship for yourself. If you aren't a lifer, then avoid serious relationships until you are out of the service. Trust me, I learned how fucked military wives can be in Iraq. I called home often and it seemed like every third time I went into the trailer where the phones were, I would find a soldier hunched over in their booth crying, pleading for their family. Some asked, ""how could you?"" after being betrayed. I've known a few men who went through really messy situations. Damn good, faithful men, every one of them. It was a bitter pill to swallow, but I knew for me, I couldn't raise a family in the Army and I couldn't have a serious GF until I got out."

I don't know why you've stayed this long.  You deserve to be treated better than this, but you have to stand up for yourself.  You're getting hurt over and over, and she's not going to stop doing it, and she's not going to pity you and give you an out.  You have to make things better for yourself.    There's really no reason for her to stop cheating, man.  You have shown her you'll put up with it.  I would break up and cut all contact with her.  I'd talk to the best friend and give him a chance to explain himself, but if you don't feel good about what he has to say, cut him out, too.  It doesn't have to be dramatic fireworks; it's amazingly easy to subtly phase someone out of your life.  Surround yourself with better people, instead of waiting for these to become better on their own.  It might not seem like it, but there are so many people in the world that you could be attracted to and fall in love with.  You can definitely do way better than what you currently have.

It will hurt him, even if he's strong enough to stick around and accept that you were apart and he could do what he wanted.  So it's unnecessary hurt.  He said he didn't want to know.  If he wants to know later in your relationship, and you seem to be in a good place, ask him why he's changed his mind.  Get to the bottom of that before saying you hooked up.  You say yourself that you don't even know the details.  He won't believe that and will assume the worst.

I tried to reason with my stepmom how ridiculous it is to respond with anger to honest mistakes and just downright forgetfulness. It's not like I intentionally forgot to do something just to fuck with her (which is what she kept telling me I was doing). I would be going about my day and she would come in out of nowhere with nastiness over something like closing the toothpaste. Sometimes I had the energy to argue back, other times I would just zone out and say ""okay, it was an honest mistake"" then leave the room, or I would just flat out ignore her. What I realized over the years is that this woman is the way she is and the most important thing in these situations is my own peace of mind and healthy mentality.  When these situations do happen now I do not let it get to me and stay calm. So take a deep breath, say what you need to say such as ""look I forgot, sometimes these things happen"" then walk away because you sure as hell do not have to be a part of this person's crazy bantering."

relationship_advice,3dbmeo,maqaddict,3,Wed Jul 15 01:26:27 2015 UTC,"Loneliness is a bummer for sure. My two cents is this- She made the mistake, not you. She chose to leave without you and that really stinks. I don't think I'd get too hung up on calling her out. You had a right to do that. It seems like more than being stuck on this girl you are in a spot where you put yourself out there and were vulnerable and got hosed and now are scared to try again. So, you blame yourself and idolize someone that doesnt really deserve it so that you can justify not really trying. Been there done that. 10 years is long enough to know that this approach isnt working. Why not put yourself out there again and see what happens? I doubt youll be worse off than you are now and would be willing to bet that you'll feel better. Hope this helps."
relationship_advice,3dbmeo,ahhpuddingcontrol,2,Wed Jul 15 01:52:45 2015 UTC,"At the behest of friends I've tried to put myself out there, but it's a mix trust issues and not wanting to put someone through getting close to me and leaving them when she comes back to town.   I feel like she was my last best home for a normal life and I squandered it. I honestly don't know what I could have done different though. What I do know is that she doesn't get to walk into someone's life, make them care, and then check out. Of that I'm certain.   I just found out she's living back in the states again, granted on the other side of the country. I saw her a few years ago, back where we're from...she just happened to walk into the bar we used to go to where I was having a beer. I had a full blown panic attack when I saw her. I just don't know what to do to get rid of this.   I made her a promise 4 years ago that I would leave her alone, and I've kept that promise, but I really just want to talk this out with her and I've been waiting for her to communicate. The ball is in her court. I just love her too much to let go. I dunno, maybe I'm just lame."
relationship_advice,3dbmeo,ahhpuddingcontrol,2,Wed Jul 15 02:00:12 2015 UTC,"Man this sounds tough. I think I get that you had a lot invested in her and probably had some really great plans for the future. It just doesn't seem like she shared your vision. That doesnt make you bad or damaged but it means you are two different people and you went two different directions. You know I don't know you or this girl but it just seems like if she really cared about you she wouldnt put you through the ringer like this. And it also seems like you have to have more self worth than to think that this is the best you can do. I think that you should get to have a life and have fun and if she comes back someday you can deal with it then but right now you are just putting everything on hold for a what if with someone that has already hurt you. Accepting reality can be really tough when it comes to love but we have to do it. Otherwise, we end up waiting our lives and missing the people that could have really loved us and also truly deserved our love."

That shit hurts night and day, man. And for her to write on my car the night she left...what's that all about? The mixed signals are hell."

I think slowly I am training them to have more follow through, slow baby steps, but we might be getting there. I also make sure I have back up plans  With a friend, its okay. With a SO, not so great.

You went out of your way and spent money to have your passport taken care of in a rushed fashion just to go on a trip that she suggested. Does she do this often? It actually sounds a bit ""manic"" and I would not be surprised if she had a little bit of mental health issues she should be looking at.   Granted, if she travels a lot for work, maybe she does not see traveling as a luxury like many of us do. Maybe that is why, to HER it may seem like it's not a big deal. Her lack of attention to details and lack of communication with you is the real concern. I would have a sit down about this. I would not make her feel like you are angry, I would approach it in a way that expresses your feelings and excitement that only turned to disappointment.

relationship_advice,3db2kx,MissIpsaLoquitur,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:34:30 2015 UTC,We're supposed to talk about it tonight. We had some big relationship hurdles before this - this incident was just kind of the icing on the cake and enough to put me over the edge enough to end things. So I asked if we could talk tonight and briefly told her what I'm feeling/concerned about. My plan was to break up with her but if we can address some of our other issues and get them worked out then I will be happy to try a bit longer and see where this goes.  She definitely sees travel as a luxury - and knew that I was excited to spend a week with her in another country (we saw each other only 4 days last month...)  My biggest concern is her lack of empathy for me. Her ability to forget I exist long enough to book a flight without me to somewhere she invited me to.
relationship_advice,3db2kx,MissIpsaLoquitur,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:56:28 2015 UTC,"I would be concerned about that too. However, the only reason I brought up the mental health subject is because although nothing too serious I have had an experience in the past where a boyfriend of mine had an diagnosed issue that was affecting us.   He seemed very selfish and inconsiderate but on the inside and the person I knew he was, just did not align. It turned out he had an anxiety issue and once recognized and understood and TREATED, we had a very awesome relationship going forward that ended many yrs later for other reasons.   She could be exhibiting behaviors that are a part of an underlying issue and not who she is as a person. You had many good things to say about her but in the long run, what matters is how your lives align and seeing her only 4 days out of a month (for me would not work at all) would not always work for many people."

I don't like other people to know I am stressed ( I don't want them to feel burdened ) so instead I take it out in different ways.   I still think she needs to be aware that she can't hurt others because of whatever it is (work, travel, life)."

The traits or qualities that she possesses that rationalize her actions in her mind will be the same traits or values that rationalize other issues that she ""won't think is a big deal"".  I'd be interested in her justification for assuming you weren't going and in thinking it's okay to make the plans and then change them as she sees fit.

Getting irrationally angry at you and sitting on the couch all day, gaining weight, neglecting to shave - these all sound like depression to me. I think reddit loves to jump on feminism; if someone is a feminist, every bad behavior or undesirable trait is suddenly because of feminism. She can be a feminist who is also depressed. Talk to her and see if she's been feeling down lately. Maybe there's a whole other issue going on."

That said, you can't be afraid to fight. Don't let her control you with the threat of being called sexist, you know your not, so buckle down and get ready for a temper tantrum.

relationship_advice,3d8ysm,Drmrfreckles,22,Tue Jul 14 14:56:38 2015 UTC,"Thirded. This sounds like a situation that needs a level-headed calm discussion (or series of such discussions).   It seems like two issues have come up:   A relatively rapid influx of a strain of argumentative, militant feminism; A disinclination toward putting effort into the relationship, including household chores, general appearance, and desire to communicate.   These are likely interrelated, though I don't have enough information to be certain. There are four possible answers:   The two are unrelated to one another; The newfound interest in militant feminism is driving an idealistic unwillingness to contribute to what have traditionally been viewed as female roles; The lack of motivation to cook, clean, and maintain her body is driving an  opportunistic claim of feminism; There is an omitted antecedent cause that is driving both;   My money's on number 4, though I would have to know more about the relationship before finalizing that diagnosis. How have things been, apart from the recent behavioral changes? Had you noticed an increase of arguing or tension? Have either of you been more snippy or stressed as of late?  The prescription is the same for all four - talk to her. Sit down and talk. Tell her that you notice that communication has really broken down, and you want to figure out how to get back to a healthier place. Ask her what's going on with her, and really listen to what she has to say. Ask her whether she's happy with the relationship, and what you could do to improve things. Tell her that you're hoping that she might make some changes as well. It's perfectly possible to stick up for yourself while acknowledging her needs and wants.  She'll likely get angry at first. That's okay. Just remain calm, direct, and focused. Don't let it become a rehashing of past arguments. Remain calm, and reassure her throughout the conversation that you just want to make things better.  *edit - I should mention that I consider myself to be a radical feminist, and relatively well educated on the subject. It's my opinion that most people who approach gender relations from a knowledge-perspective instead of an activist-perspective tend to allow for much greater nuance in debates. Perhaps she might benefit from some general feminist readers? There are some good ones on Amazon."
relationship_advice,3d8ysm,Lapland_Lapin,6,Tue Jul 14 15:48:02 2015 UTC,"^ All of this.  It seems like she's found a new thing to fall in with and, having been a student in the humanities and now an outspoken atheist, there's a transition phase. When you get into X or Y cause you want to do good, but often you immediately slam into the wall of dumb/sexism/homophobia/racism/fucking-whatever that you're rallying against. Which can cause some serious disenfranchisement with the human condition.  When I first started doing the atheist thing I was frequently irritated to distraction whenever I encountered some hypocritical jackass going on about ""traditional marriage"" while his third wife hands out flyers. And I let them know it, often with the same language I just used or worse. I drove off a few X-tian friends, which I regret, and more than once acted a damned obstinate fool, raving like an enraged lunatic at the married ills of religion. And like Walter, I wasn't wrong, but I was an asshole.  Now, this kind of crap still bothers the hell out of me. And there's plenty more where that comes from. But you learn that it's not ""all of them"" and as you read more about your cause (that is, actually read published books by real authors and not vanity published screeds or tumblr ravings) you become more informed, your arguments become more nuanced and in the end it's easier to see the forrest through the trees. As many prominent atheists like Peter Boghossian would say, it's about sincerity and compassion. No one puts a fire with more fire (and yes, I know you can blow out and oil file... work with me one this one ok).  It sounds like, along with the contents of a few other suggestions, it might behoove you to read up on feminism. Actual feminism, not the tumblr shit she's clearly using to fuel her 'cause-rage'. Then, the next time you talk about feminism within the context of your own home, you can engage her on her own ground. Ask her why, in the pursuit of equality within the relationship, you're doing all the cooking and cleaning. Ask her what goal her lack of hygiene is moving towards. Is about taking a visible stance against the patriarchally imposed societal norm of feminine appearance, or is it a great excuse for being a lazy gross-face full of undirected rage and bon-bons — and on the off chance it's the former, ask her exactly how what she's doing helps.  If she wants to have the feminism discussion, go for it. Go all in. Because feminism doesn't support her being a lazy, selfish, passive aggressive blow hard who pushes everything off on her husband."

It is her choice, but she is now on notice that there are consequences to being an obnoxious, slothful, overweight glutton.  One of those consequences is OP is not longer in a relationship with her.  He is not entitled to tell her what to do.  But she is not entitled to a relationship.  He can withdraw that commitment on his own terms for any reason he thinks is valid.

relationship_advice,3d8ysm,jiminyxmas,19,Tue Jul 14 13:19:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how familiar you are with Reddit OP, but I don't think this is the best place for you to be getting advice on this issue. There is a major anti-feminist sentiment on Reddit, and also a great deal of the community who generally hate people with weight problems. There's also a good deal of the opposite side of that spectrum on reddit as well, who might put the fault on you.  I'm by no means saying you're in the wrong or that the comments here are all going to be bad, I'm just saying that you're essentially asking Fox News what to do about your liberal wife. You may get a good, logical answer but you're probably going to get a lot of ""fat feminazi tumblr asshole"" responses (there are already a few here).  I'd suggest trying a marriage counselor. Most counselors should have a pretty neutral viewpoint and should be able to help you communicate. It's not unreasonable to what your partner to do her part (cooking, etc) and to want your partner to be healthy. Maybe a counselor can help you get to the bottom of why she's behaving this way and help the two of you work it out."
relationship_advice,3d8ysm,geoman2k,13,Tue Jul 14 18:06:21 2015 UTC,"Allow me to play devil's advocate...   Appearance to me is not an issue but health is.   Ok, I'm asking you to please reevaluate the sincerity of this comment. ""Leg hair"" has nothing to do with health. If she is letting herself go, and it bothers you that you don't find her as attractive, you don't have to be ashamed of that. Just be honest with yourself about it. I'm sure you do care about her health, but I suspect you also care about her attractiveness.   We split house hold responsibilities and have rule whomever is home first does the cooking. This has been the rule since we've moved in together.   If she is getting home before you more often than not, that doesn't sound like a fair rule.  I can't say really if it is fair or not because I don't know how the rest of the housework is split. Perhaps you need to take a closer look at this. My apologies, I misread your examples, and thought that she was getting home earlier than you both weeks.  With regard to the debates on women's issues in the news, perhaps you need to take the focus off the actual issues for a while, and focus more on empathy. Talk to her about it, but avoid discussing the details of the news. Echo her emotions -- ""This is really upsetting for you"" ""You really care about what these women are going through"" etc. Even if you don't agree with her conclusions, you can still empathize with her. If she is reassured that you are hearing her, she may be more open to hearing you. Maybe it isn't fair that you should have to make that gesture first, but if she understands that you are considering her side, she might be more open to considering your side. This just sounds like both sides are getting entrenched in being heard, and perhaps not trying to hear the other.  I'm also wondering if this recent passion is because of an underlying issue that she has bottled up. Could there be a deeper motivation for her argumentativeness on this issue? Maybe ask her why this is really important to her."
relationship_advice,3d8ysm,istril,-2,Tue Jul 14 17:47:06 2015 UTC,"As far as the health thing goes, the health issue at hand wasn't hairy legs, but the ""significant"" weight gain his wife has already undergone.  As he pointed out, one can gain weight without it coming from junk food - it's not strictly true that someone who is normally 150 lbs would be healthier at 140lbs and less healthy at 160lbs.  But what is generally true is someone who gains weight by eating junk food has become less healthy."
relationship_advice,3d8ysm,tangerinelion,8,Wed Jul 15 04:09:37 2015 UTC,"It sounds like a lot of your issues can be solved by working on your communication.   1) Talk with her, make sure she's ok. It sounds like a lot of this behavior is new. Has something changed recently that could be impacting her behavior? You just got married 6 months ago. Was she (/were you two) planning the wedding for a long time? Once big events like that are over, sometimes it can leave feelings of depression. You're building up to and planning something for so long, it becomes part of your life to look forward to that. Suddenly it's gone, and you're left looking for something else to look forward to. (Full disclosure- I've never been married, but I've seen a few friends go through something similar).  2) She's stopped cooking and cleaning. After making sure she's ok, talk to her about this. If these are tasks that you usually share equally (it sounds like that's the case with cooking at least, I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt that you don't just expect her to do all the cleaning. Even if she is home more than you or whatever) tell her that you understand she might be working through some things, and you've happily picked up some of the extra work around the home, but it's starting to wear you out and can you two come up with another regular system for chores.  3) DON'T bring up weight gain or shaving. Partially because it's absolutely a woman's choice whether to shave or not shave, it's her body and you don't get a say in that. Also, she might be very self conscious about her weight gain (even if it doesn't appear so- a common defense mechanism for this type of thing is to appear uncaring). If she is going through something personal, that might be a contributing factor. Talking through it with a therapist or someone she feels comfortable with might help.  It seems like most of your problems can be solved with communication. You mentioned in your post that you haven't spoken with her about her lack of contribution to household chores. If you haven't spoken with her, you can't expect her to know you're upset. Even if she's deviating from your ""norm"", she can't read your mind. Tell her how you feel, but make sure you're telling her with ""I"" statements instead of ""you"" statements (so that she doesn't feel attacked). For example, ""Honey, I am feeling a little overwhelmed with the amount of chores around the home lately, can we talk about a better way to divide up some of the household work?"" instead of ""Why have you been slacking on your share of the work around the home lately?"".   If having a healthy conversation about these issues keeps turning into a fight, perhaps you should consider some sort of couples counseling to work on your communication issues."
relationship_advice,3d8ysm,LatteLaughter,2,Tue Jul 14 16:25:45 2015 UTC,"I can't say what you should do here. I've not had a similar experience from which to draw advice.  But I can say this: you sound like a reasonable fucking guy, and you are not in the wrong. You're handling this maturely and intelligently, and you clearly love and respect your partner. Don't let anyone, including her, tell you otherwise.  I have had the experience, personally and through watching it engulf my friends, of seeing what internet radical feminism does to otherwise intelligent people, and I'm here to tell you there's hope. People with any semblance of a conscience eventually realize that you can't live life that way, and settle in to a point where they are aware of these issues but don't have the intense anger and indignation.   If I had to say what you should do here, it's to stay out of her way as far as gender issues. She will work them out to a point of reasonableness eventually. I can't say it won't engulf your relationship - depending on how far off the deep end she falls, she may decide to end it with you if you're not completely jumping off with her, but I assure you, if you survive, she will eventually come back from it.  But buckle up, because it might be a rough ride.  Especially since it appears to affecting other aspects of your relationship. I'd encourage you to explain to her, speaking in terms of your feelings and how they are affected by her actions. Explain what you want from her in the context of your established roles in a loving partnership, not the context of society and its gender roles.   Good luck."

relationship_advice,3d8ysm,Gizmo-Duck,2,Tue Jul 14 19:39:47 2015 UTC,"You have 2 problems here, and feminism is not one of them. I am a feminist woman who is married to a man who identifies as a feminist and we're both very committed to this cause. We'd both like to see some significant social changes. However, that doesn't mean that he personally has to pay for the sins of previous generations by being my housekeeper. It means that we divide our household tasks based on our individual strengths and available free time.   The problem with your wife is that she is bad at arguing--a black and white worldview is a sign of immaturity and while she may have been able to comprehend that at one time, something has changed and she can no longer see that. Either she is not the person you thought she was, or she is experiencing some sort of mental health issue.   The lack of caring about her personal appearance and contribution to the household is the second problem. Again, she may not be the person you thought she was or she may be dealing poorly with something like clinical depression.   Try to get her to see a counselor, with or without you. If she refuses, you should see one on your own. A counselor can help you make the decisions that are best for you, whether you decide to accept the situation as it is or decide you need to exit the relationship. No one can make that choice for you, but you need some help figuring it out."
relationship_advice,3d8ysm,kornberg,4,Tue Jul 14 21:21:59 2015 UTC,"As others said, she's not happy.  That is the main part.  I suggest sitting down with her and asking her whats wrong.  Keep at it askig for followups. Why, this. Why do you feel that.  Try to at least pretend to understand and agree.  This is not the time to argue. See if she will tell you whats really bothering her.  Chances are she doesn't even know, but she will feel more cared for by you asking and listening and agreeing with her.  Important though, don't make any promises here that you can't keep.  The next thing to do is to try to get her to go on walks with you.  Tell her you want more time together and you feel better when you walk and talk.  This will get her ass off the couch, give some physical exercise and will show her attention that you care for her.  Try to incorporate some things that she likes into it.  Bonus points if you can make it her idea from the beginning."

relationship_advice,3d8ysm,Warpfrenzy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:19:30 2015 UTC,"If she's getting super-defensive, argumentative, and becoming less and less functional then I would worry she's got some major issues she's not dealing with, possibly depression or unresolved conflict that is festering.  At this point it doesn't seem possible for you two to figure it out on your own. She's going to use her ""feminist"" perspective as a cudgel to beat on anything that will force her to take responsibility for herself and the relationship so it would be wise to consult a relationship therapist to have an unbiased third person perspective that she can't dismiss as easily."

Sadly, there's a subset of women who believe that being fat and unattractive is necessary to support women's rights. As an older woman myself who fought passionately for women's rights, I'm not sure how this message got so distorted. It's really not necessary to be grossly flabby in order to support other women.  As for your relationship, it's best to start speaking up now. Your silence is being interpreted as support, and I feel this is only the beginning of her railroading you. And for god's sake, use contraception. The last you need is to add a child to this mix."

If I were you I would try talking to her now, seeing as the marriage is fairly new, rather than let it fester and grow into something that ends in divorce.  If she brought up mattress girl, then yea, she's kind of leaning towards third wave feminism in my opinion. Anyone who looks at that evidence from an objective standpoint can see that the whole thing is a travesty, and I get pretty confused as to why anyone would use her as an example of why we need feminism in this country, more the opposite in my opinion.  You need to ask yourself an honest question: Is my wife the kind of woman who can handle having an argument objectively?  If the answer is no, you're in for a lot of shit, friend."
relationship_advice,3d8ysm,R50cent,0,Tue Jul 14 16:02:41 2015 UTC,"She's going through a ""thing"". She's been bit by the 'cause' bug-a thing that sometimes is a phase, or sometimes it encompasses who the person is at the core and changes everything.  The only way you will survive is if you separate her new found feminism from the 'issues' (cleaning, cooking chores, sex, appearance) at hand. I know that it will seem impossible now within this context (of he new found feminism) but you are just going to have to trust me on this.  Everyone who joins a partnership goes into it with written and sometimes non-written rules and when people stop following these rules they have to be addressed-period-feminism, or no feminism--I don't care what the 'ism' is.   This is not a 'gender' issue so much as a partner issue. Keep pressing on that. And what you want for your partnership is negotiable but it is reasonable to expect what you were 'sold'(for lack of better word) initially too. For example, If at one point she exercised and watched what she ate and that is what you were signing up for-then you have a right to bring it up. If she doesn't want to do that anymore for whatever reason then that's her prerogative and it's your prerogative to be ok-or not be ok with it.  Also, if you don't mind me saying, you are walking on egg shells when stuff comes up and you need to stop waiting until things get worse to say something. Like the day she didn't make dinner-if the deal was whoever is home first makes dinner you should have asked why she didn't make dinner instead of just making it yourself. Then she can address it--""I didn't feel like it, or I was really tired, or I had cramps etc."" that way you know what's going on and not making assumptions.  Also, about the week off thing...I am a slob and if I had a week off I would NOT spend it doing stuff around the apartment. That's reasonable to me because that was HER vacation. Now, normal people take care of business whether they are on vacation, have a day off, sick or whatever. I personally would give her slack on that one but it's your choice--I would mention the cooking thing though, because-again, the deal was if you are home first, you cook.   Anyway, good luck-let us know how it went."

Shes an asshole. Leave her and tumblr behind.    She also seems to be letting herself go.    Gross.

relationship_advice,3d8ysm,1wf,-2,Tue Jul 14 15:09:09 2015 UTC,Another one infected by the disease that is feminism. You can do way better than her. At the very least threaten her with divorce. Dread game sometimes makes these feminist types straighten up because they know they will never be able to do better than you when they're letting themselves go like that. She's doing this because you're allowing her to. Time to start acting like a man and set some rules. Women like this need you to act like an alpha male or they will walk all over you. She's likely unhappy with your relationship because you're not acting man enough and just letting her walk all over you. That's a major turn off for women.  As far as discussions on feminist issues go the only way to win that game is not to play. They have no ability to use logic and even though you may be right she just wants to have a fight.  To better understand why your wife is acting this way I suggest doing some reading over at /r/theredpill. This is a very common problem after marriage and a woman thinks she has you locked down and she thinks she can start doing whatever she wants. There are many strategies on that subreddit to help you fix this problem.

I can't blame them; we have been and continue to be very fucked up in the way we as a society deal with women. Regarding your situation, I think first you need to be a little patient (sounds like you ARE being patient, but kind of at your wit's end, I know). Many of your wife's reactions are likely temporary. With respect to the cooking and health issues, it sounds like you're approaching them from the right direction: ""We split duties and this was our agreement,"" and ""I'm concerned about your health."" You're going to have to have that discussion, and if she tries to make it about something bigger, just bring it back to that simple statement.

Many claims that feminists use a basis for their actions (gender pay gap, 1 in 4 women raped, rape culture, etc) are at least misleading and at most simply lies. When confronted about these, they become defensive and usually resort to personal insults. That's what happening when there is a discussion about personal beliefs, not facts.  So, it's a cult to her.

I'll offer an alternative view: That only works if it's a real surprise, and she picked up on the idea that you sent her flowers in an effort to spur communication.  It's like bringing flowers on a first date: What feels romantic to the giver, is instead an effort to manipulate a response out of the receiver.

A SO who doesn't really care about gifts would just appreciate the effort you go to. How long have you been dating?  EDIT: Don't worry about the letter.

relationship_advice,3daan9,Lazy_IT_guy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:45:48 2015 UTC,"Dude,  she was so immature. Here's what went down right when we first became a couple over a year ago. First, we had fights over the fact that I couldn't go to a couple bars in her college town because her ex-bf would be there, and she didn't want to make him mad.   She posted a pic of her and her EX-BF on her instagram but refused to post a picture of us. Fight ensued.  Then we had a fight because she wanted to sleep on her Ex-BF's couch in Washington DC when she went to visit another friend.  Then we had a fight because she gave her number to a guy at a bar on her birthday and was texting with him that night about what bars she was going to etc etc (they didn't actually hang out but he was clearly trying to get in with her). She said she just wanted alot of people to come party with her.   Then we had a fight because she was texting and facebook messaging with a frat guy she previously hooked up with. She didn't seem to have salacious intentions at all, but she didn't understand why it was inappropriate.   We got in a fight because she wanted to go to her college town and when I asked where she was going to sleep she said a couch at a frat house, I said that was totally inappropriate.  We got in a fight because she gave her number to a guy in a bar she apparently used to know or be friends with, in front of me, without first introducing me."
relationship_advice,3daan9,Gizmo-Duck,2,Wed Jul 15 17:58:27 2015 UTC,"After reading all of that, it definitely seems like you two aren't compatible. Above all, it seems like she refuses to respect you in the relationship. Some of the things you mentioned above weren't as serious as others, like inviting a guy to party with her on her birthday, but others were insane. Posting pics of her ex? Intending to sleep over at his house? That's way out of line.  I can tell from your other posts that you've broken up with her, and I congratulate you on that. You've recognized the ways she's wronged you and decided to end it - not many people would have the courage to do that. These next few months may be difficult, but just stay strong. I wish the best for you, man."
relationship_advice,3daan9,Birthdaybird,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:58:33 2015 UTC,hey man I really appreciate your kind words. It was REALLY hard to break up with her. She was very exotic looking and incredibly beautiful and intelligent. Unfortunately she used the latter to manipulate me and emotionally abuse me.  I didn't have the courage to break up with her to til the very end and backed down multiple times.

relationship_advice,3daan9,zeporscheguy,2,Wed Jul 15 18:03:48 2015 UTC,"Regarding the ""it's her time"" when you were on vacation. I been on both perspectives. If you're calling her all the time, or once a day, it can be rather difficult to listen to your plans, on a daily basis, or to feel like she needs to talk to you. Some ""I miss you"" time isn't all that bad. Were you calling her because you were bored? Too much of anything, isn't good.   Does she even like those gifts, and the girly items, or do you think she'd like it just because it's a gift? If she's not into it, and doesn't use it, then why force her to wear it. If she got you an Ed Hardy shirt because she thought you'd like it, would you bother wearing it much, or would you give it to your Ed Hardy loving friends?  I wouldn't worry about the love letter behind her bed.   Communicate about you getting her things - does she like them, what would she prefer if you do get her stuff? Does she think the gestures are too much? When she says ""me time"" what does she mean? Does she not want to talk for those days when you're on vacation? What about a call every 3 days? Does she just not like phone calls? How does conversation go when you're with her, or when you're at different places when you aren't on vacation?  Seems you can get to the bottom of this fairly quickly by asking her those question. If she's irritated and such about it, you may need to ask questions outside of the gifts and vacation communication schedule."

You have done too much, and you have tried too hard. Now she takes you for granted, doesn't miss you, doesn't respect you, and doesn't care about your heartfelt expressions.  Stop trying so damn hard. Relationships are hard enough when TWO people are busting their asses to make it work, and they're doomed to failure when just one is committed. You need to step back, and quit trying to win her love. Start living your own life, and doing your own thing. Start hanging out with friends (men and women). If she cares, she'll start making an effort. If she doesn't, delete gym and hit the Facebook."

relationship_advice,3daan9,zeporscheguy,9,Tue Jul 14 18:55:07 2015 UTC,"No, certain girls like some of that stuff. A lot don't, as your girlfriend seems to be one of those types. You're operating on a sterotypical idea of what you think women like and value here.  Flowers can be seen as useless non-functional things that remind you that love eventually dies. High-end personal care products are intensely personal purchases that are always kinda risky, and some women might even prefer to make their personal care stuff themselves. And while love letters are sweet, some women just aren't that into that kind of level of romantic gesture.   I feel that you may have a problem in not paying enough attention to or connecting with what her love langauge is. You need to know how she best feels like she's loved. Some women will want this kind of stuff yes, but others like to simply be told I love you, or they like that you invest your time and energy into them, or that you do acts of service for them, or to simply be touched. Equally, you need to communicate how you also best feel love so that you don't feel burned like you do right now and hopefully you two can collaborate into something that makes you both happy.  Also sounds like you two need a talk about personal boundaries and when one needs personal time. That way, if it's simply a thing where she just needs some ""me"" time, it won't be a cause for panic because you misperceive she's distancing herself."

relationship_advice,3dbmmf,earthpeacesteph,2,Wed Jul 15 00:35:01 2015 UTC,"My preference is to text and/or talk daily.  My bf is not big on the phone for talking or texting.   Him not wanting to text daily doesn't mean he doesn't care about me, it just means he dislikes the phone.  He talks plenty in person.   So, I guess I would ask, does your bf communicate well in person?  Also you say you are LD, how often do you get to see each other?  In my case, I see my bf once, sometimes twice a week, and 95% of our limited communication between dates is making plans.  If you don't get to see your bf very frequently I can see where more texting/talking on the phone would be very important."

It could be that, if open about it, you could experience a sexual experience with a woman with your boyfriend's blessing. Otherwise, you are making a decision to cheat or not.

Of course I wouldn't cheat on him because a)he did it to me once at the very start of the relationship and I have never felt so hurt and b) because from when he did, i would obviously not expect him to do that again. We didnt really come to a conclusion just the acceptance that I wouldn't cheat on him with a woman or man."

I'm confused, what should I do?"" - You're in a relationship, which means you've made a decision to be exclusive with your bf. The fact that you're into other people (regardless of their gender), means little. Either a. You approach your bf with the intent of having sex with other people and he accepts, b. You drop the issue, c. You cheat in which case you're a horrible person, or d. You split up. That's the extent of your choices. Once again, the gender part has little to do with this."

You'll never have her. All the pain you would feel if dating her doesn't work out, plus way more, will be stretched out over the years as you waste your romantic life pining after her.  Or you can ask her out. The worst that happens is she says no, and then you can recognize that it's not going to work out, be sad and upset for a while, and then cut contact, get over her, and go find someone who's interested in you.  Long-term, you'll have far less pain if you ask her out."

Ouch. Yeah, total BS.  As for the rest, my sense is you are still too focused on her. She does not want to have sex with you, and you are obsessing about why and how you can affect it.  You are pulling out your relationship slide rule and micrometers, trying to figure out if this or that particular word or phrase is making her more or less interested in you.  Stop doing that.  Stop paying attention at all to her libido level (which kind of sounds like it is beneath measurable levels, but I am just assuming that).  Oh, I know, you are married, and there were vows.  Etc.  But those vows do not turn her on, and neither do you, it appears. So rather than fall back onto societal cliches and nostrums, face the circumstances as they really are: she is not interested.  Stop thinking that you are going to change that for her via one more confrontation, accommodation, or whatever.    Instead, focus on doing things that you value or enjoy, for reasons you think are worthwhile.  Stop focusing on her and what she may or may not find sexy.    You do not obsess about other women who do not want to have sex with you.  The reason is because you have no expectation that they would or should.  You need to apply that same set of zero expectations to your spouse, in order to start thinking more clearly.  Right now you are a rat in the maze, desperately trying to find the cheese.   There is no cheese.  Stop being a rat. Decide if you want to leave the maze or stay in a cheeseless maze."

And it just adds fuel to the fire when he tells me he's going to the ball field tonight to watch a game and drink beer.  My work hours are unrealistic, and I shouldn't hold anyone to my standard, but it really just sucks sometimes.  I suppose I could try to restrict my spending and maybe give myself four nights off a week at my part time job, instead of two.  I'm just not sure if I will financially be able to cut it.  I like being able to buy pretty much whatever I want.  Maybe it's a sacrifice I'll have to consider making if I want things to work.  I do feel bad for resenting him.  Thanks for your thoughts."
relationship_advice,3dapr9,1wf,2,Tue Jul 14 21:16:56 2015 UTC,I think I would get bored if I didn't work my second job. But I think part of my resents him for having it so easy.   If he doesn't have problems paying bills then what are you worried about.
relationship_advice,3dapr9,supreme313,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:36:03 2015 UTC,"Is it valid to think that this will make or break us?   Yes, in some cases.  It could be jealousy, or perhaps you have lost respect for him?   From the way he talks, he doesn't have any intentions of moving out of his parents for a while.   And why would he leave when he has it so easy?  Now you have to ask yourself if you see this relationship moving forward or not.    FWIW:  My BF is well off and does not have to work.  I do have to work, but, I have a career that I love and would not trade it for anything.  I was a tad jealous when I left for work this morning (I'm 32 he's 36) and he was playing GTA...would've loved to join him.  However, I'm jealous in a good way.  I'm happy that  he is happy, and he shops/cooks dinners/takes care of my dog so he's not just a dead beat.  He also does not live at home with mom and dad."

Maybe stop texting back so much, she needs to learn to live without you and vice versa. If you truly want to move on I would suggest killing off the communication a bit, I mean don't be a dick and ignore her but how can you move on when you constantly talk to this girl you still love you know?

relationship_advice,3d9krg,Beachgirl01,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:52:47 2015 UTC,"TL;DR version: Ignore your therapist.  Calm down. Enjoy your marriage even more by figuring out what foot fetish stuff your husband wants to do with you.  Then do those things.  Watch him turn into the happiest husband in the world. Everyone wins.  Okay, let me give you the longer version:   I ... saw that he has been watching porn. Yes I know all men do    Correct.   but it was a shock to me,    Why? Because you thought he had not just a Y chromosome, but some others as well?  Have a laugh at yourself for being that way, and enjoy your husband for the man he is, not the idealized version he never was.  No one is a bad person here.   so in turn I started looking a his history to find out how addicted [he] was    Boy, that escalated quickly.  Addiction?  Really?   Now that the dogs are gone and kids are in college I guess I'm more aware of what is going on in my [husband's] life and I'm having a very hard time with it.    Sounds like you previously did not bother to get into your husband's sexual interests much. Now you are bothering to do so, partly because of your lack of other places to put your interest.  When his sexual interests did not conform to YOUR previous expectations, you took that personally.  You should not have.  It is your information level, anxiety, and relative interest level that changed, NOT HIM and not his sexual interests.  Given that, isn't this is on you, not him?  He is still the same dude doing the same things.  (And no, looking at porn is not ""cheating"", anymore than that rom-com movie you have watched 20 times is cheating, so any internet scolds saying so should be ignored.)   She feels he has an addiction and would like group therapy.    Yeah...given the fact that she concluded this without talking to him, I would expect your husband to be pretty disinterested in going to receive his sentence, er, ""diagnosis"" and ""treatment"" from her.  If my s/o suggested something like that, my reaction would be to opt instead for golfing or knitting classes.  (I hate golf and never knit anything.)  My further guess is a male therapist might be less likely to label looking at foot fetish sites an addiction, because life experience.   He admits he is obsessed and is addicted   Is he?  Is he really, or are you making this a big deal, with him saying all sorts of things to calm you down?  My guess is the latter, not the former.  My guess is he holds a job, has friends, and moves about in a full, happy life on a daily basis, with the occasional stop on a foot fetish site when he has a spare 30-60 minutes to kill.  He prefers doing that to watching TV or reading a book.  None of which impacts you negatively, it seems, or him.  That is not an addiction, it is something he likes to do.  Kind of like that rom com movie or bodice-ripper book club you like so much.  Just because YOU suddenly got aware of his interests, and you are feeling insecure about your life, does not make it an addiction."

relationship_advice,3d9krg,notevenapro,-1,Tue Jul 14 17:32:17 2015 UTC,"You are right. This has made me very insecure. Before how this I was a very secure person. I guess not knowing his long history, having the foot surgery and having to be comfortable with all of this."

relationship_advice,3d9krg,Im_atornado,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:02:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with ""is not about you"". It's just something he wants in his own time. He loves you for you. My husband likes certain porn, he doesn't want to do those things with me. He's actually way more vanilla in bed than his porn choices. Your husband doesn't  think of you as ""feet"". He thinks of you as his wife and probably loves all of you. Just because he jerks off to feet doesn't mean that he will find you unattractive if your feet are not ""porn beautiful"".   Isn't there something you're attracted to that your husband doesn't necessarily have? I'm sure that your husband doesn't fill everything you desire 100% of the time. Right? I would love to be able to fulfill my husband all of the time, but... I can't be mom, Wife, sexy maid, slutty stripper, sex slave and naked pizza delivery girl... (you get the point) all of the time. I just can't.    I wish I could be of more help. I'm kind of going through the same thing.  The thing that helps me the most is to remember that my husband couldn't possibly fulfill my every desire. And neither can yours. And I can't EXPECT that he would feel any different about me. We are human, sometimes we like weird things. Even if it makes no sense to someone else.   As long as he isn't sexualizing everyone in public and making people uncomfortable or you uncomfortable because of comments he makes or the way he behaves, you shouldn't let it define him as the person you think he is (or thought he was). He's still that person you knew before you found his fetish."
relationship_advice,3d9krg,Im_atornado,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:42:12 2015 UTC,"I hear you. I'm sure I'm not all his desire, but I do try. To be true he is 100% my desire all the time, no kidding. I have been with him for 28 years and I love him more then ever. That is why this is so hard for me."
relationship_advice,3d9krg,Im_atornado,2,Tue Jul 14 23:59:42 2015 UTC,"I try too. But somehow that's not how it works for most people. I wish I was the only thing, woman, vagina my husband is interested in.  But I'm not. So I am weird and don't understand. Buuut... You've loved your husband before you knew this right? Is it weird to you? Hell yes. To you. He always been this way. Shaming him and making him feel like a weirdo will push him away.    I still love my husband and I thought I knew so much about him and it's hard to process a part of him I never knew. And the part I never knew...honestly, I don't really like.  But it doesn't make me love him less. The last thing I want to do is make him feel shitty about a part of himself.  So if I can give you anything, please don't make him feel bad for being the way he is. You basically learned about his deepest, darkest secret. If you've been married as long as you have been and he hasn't told you, most likely, he's already ashamed of his habit.  And that's why he never told you.  Just keep an open mind.  Sure, it's a kick to the self esteem. Sure, you'll probably look at him different. But do you still love him? If you do then this is worth looking past."

Sometimes I don't even feel like being intimate because of all this bullshit. But if I did that, it would just make things worse.  And you know, even though there are people saying it's not a big deal....It's ok if it's a big deal to you.  You are allowed to feel that way.  He can't tell you, you are wrong. The internet can't tell you, you are wrong.  If it's too big of a deal for you to handle, you don't have to.   I honestly never thought I would be in a position where something would lessen my attraction to my husband. Let alone my trust and security. But yet, here I am.  So, I just deal with it day by day.  I can't change him.  He can't change me.  It's kind of like we are at a stand still and the only person who is going to compromise is me.  So that sucks. But I don't really know what else to do. What would I do? Leave him in hopes that some day I may possibly find someone who thinks more like me.  Nah.  So the only thing I can do is, well, just deal with it. Try not to take it personally and try not to treat him any different than the day I married him."
relationship_advice,3d9krg,Aucurrant,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:37:38 2015 UTC,It's so true what you say about if you are not feeling intimate it just makes it worse. During all the fighting over this I think my husband was just having sex with me when I knew he just masturbated just to make me not depressed. How sad? I feel the same about that I'm the one that need to compromise. And yes that sucks. Hope all goes well for you. I'm sure it will with time. It's been 9 months for me now and he knows how I feel and I think he is trying to respect me as much as he is capable.

I guess the good about it all is at least my husband isn't a jerk about it.  He's not throwing it in my face or flaunting it in front of me.  He's genuinely trying to be courteous about it.

If she refuses to acknowledge your feelings on the matter and tries to deflect by turning it around on you being controlling, then your girlfriend is too immature to be in a relationship.   My suggestion, sit her down and talk to her about this. Remain calm, and ask her to do the same. Tell her it bothers you and is ruining the time you two have together. Ask her to compromise with you. My suggestion would be to ask her to put her phone down between X and Y times every evening. Then listen to her compromise and then work together to find something that works for both of you. If she won't compromise, then she is putting her phone ahead of the relationship and there really isn't anything else you can do besides move on."

Very short term separation from an addiction can already provide some valuable insights: ""I don't need that phone to enjoy myself"", ""I didn't mis out on anything valuable on what went on 'on the internet'"". Right now part of her identity hinges on that smartphone (if you're honest, all of or identities hinge on some material objects (house, car, salary,.. . We should still have something left once all that is gone.). taking it away will make her feel naked. Try to fill the void with some good stuff, hopefully her nice personality will do the rest.  Expect some serious protesting, but bite the bullet. State the absence of cellphones as the only requirement to go on the weekend trip."

Ideas:  Ice skating (where I live no phones or cameras are allowed on the ice)  Camping somewhere with no service. This is my favorite idea because you'll see if she's really able to disconnect and enjoy herself.  Swimming/water park--you have to put your things in a locker for the slides and rides. Similarly amusement parks don't allow phones on the rides but obviously you'll have them in between.  Can't think of any more off the top of my head but I'm sure you could brainstorm more!"

No wonder why she doesn't take more valid criticisms seriously. You've told her it bothers you. There's nothing else you can do now.

relationship_advice,3d7y9z,grasshopperonacid,2,Tue Jul 14 12:00:19 2015 UTC,"As a phone addict myself, a lot of it is the control/social validation factor. You can see if someone's opened a snap and not a text. You can show them your face, you can open new dialogues and conversation threads on insta/twitter quickly and effectively. Phones are more portable and intuitive.  Everyone has bad habits. She's probably not going to change because phones make her happy. It's a sign she feels comfortable around you, that she doesn't feel the need to put away her phone to look social. Really depends if it's so annoying to you you want to break up with her over. It seems like a pretty dumb reason to break up to me, but maybe you two just have different lifestyles and are totally incompatible that way. I like to stay up and watch movies, and if someone told me to go to sleep to wake up early for work tomorrow I'd get pissed at them for acting like my mum when I'd already made my priorities clear.   I think everyone saying ""she's too immature to be in a relationship"" is being drastic. She probably just doesn't want to sacrifice her hobbies/interests and change for someone else, which is a sign of a self-confident, strong personality. How long have you two been together? If it's not long, maybe she's afraid of over investing in you when you have problems with her and is using it as a crutch to assert her own independence. Or on the other side of the court, she might be getting bored with other things in the relationship-- when's the last time you went to a fancy dinner, etc? And feels like she needs to entertain herself. If she is working a lot she might feel stressed, and need to be amused."
relationship_advice,3d7y9z,kayla56,2,Tue Jul 14 15:14:23 2015 UTC,"I agree with this, maybe learn how to snap so you two can snap back and fourth during the day, even while your in the same place. Its neat and It would bring you closer together. I love my phone and my SO and I have come to a good balance on the matter recently after issues like yours. You come off as needy and nagging if you do things like you are mentioning. Its ok to live together and not be up each others butts all the time."

The problem is she gets really difficult to deal with and acts really childish when she is tired. That is the main reason I want her to go to sleep early, so she is not too tired the next day/night to do anything.   Yes, I am being selfish here, because I don't like dealing with her when she is tired and childish. Am I being unreasonable though?  We did a 2-week backpacking trip in Europe one month ago, had a fancy dinner and watched Aladdin on broadway for her birthday, and have recently been apartment hunting for a new place, so I hope the relationship is not too boring."

If someone hands you a breakup on a silver platter, then you accept it. You shouldn't have to wait until things get worse, or have to bring up that her cellphone usage is stupid. You don't have to slosh through the mud with girls like this. The sooner you have the guts to pull the plug with girls like this, the better.   Some people mentioned about addiction classes and whatnot, but you're way too young to go through that. 22 is old enough to realize if it's too much.   The number 1 thing in any relationship is compromise. She didn't bother to compromise with you on something so damn simple. What makes you think she'd listen to you at all if you got married or had children or planned a wedding, or where you're going for vacation, etc.  I'm all for being a nice guy, but knowing what you did in this situation, years from now, won't matter one bit. Text her ""since this is the only way you'd hear me, I decided to text you. I don't want to be in a relationship where we don't go outside and have fun. Or with someone who just wants to stare at their lifeless phone. So, consider this me breaking up with you since you can barely lift your eyes above your snapchat, FB, twitter or whatever.

Your GF is addicted to her phone.  This is becoming pretty common that some people pay so much attention to electronic social media that they actually ignore real life face to face social interaction to devote themselves to their electronic social world.  You must realize that you cannot change her. This is not likely to get better although it will morph as technology changes.    This addiction is not to different from alcohol, drug, or gambling addiction and she will not change until she realises she must change and takes steps to do so.  So you have to decide if you can live like this or if you want to spend years, or a lifetime, nagging her as she ignores you while communicating to the electronic media.      If you want to try to talk to her about this try texting or something else that runs from your phone to hers.  Then maybe she'll pay attention to you.     Leaving her might also make her realize that she has a problem.  On the other hand she might be relieved you're not there to nag her about it anymore."

Seriously though, I feel bad for younger people growing up with the amount of intrusive technology we have. I'd give anything to go back to a world with no cell phones or Facebook. I turn my phone off at work because it's just considered unprofessional to have it going off while we are working. I don't think I could date someone that needs me to look at her snapchats. I get pissed when someone texts me more than 3 times when they could just call and spit it out."

I don't think there's anything wrong with Facebook or cell phones inherently. It's combining mobile notifications with social networking that becomes obnoxious, and Snapchat just combines the worst features of both.  I'd like to try to get her to see a counselor about this, but first I need to get her to admit that it is a problem. I don't understand how she thinks it isn't when apparently both her boyfriend and her mother agree.  when we started dating I didn't have snapchat; I installed it at some point later partly out of curiosity.   Also her iPhone addiction is not as bad outside; it's only recently become an issue for me after we've been living together for some time."

I've noticed more and more people that will be out together, but staring at their phones. I think the worst part about dating now is people feel ok with texting so much. I am just a busy person and feelings always seem to get hurt when you don't reply. Just don't have the time or patience. If someone got pissy over snapchat i would think they were highly immature and probably never speak to them again. Again, it's not an issue with technology or not liking it as I am highly proficient in its use. It just bothers me that with all the advancements we have, the thing most on the mind of a young girl is that a boy didn't like her snapchats. FFS."

Last night was one of the hardest nights of my life. I ended up having to call the police when Steph finally answered the phone. She told me she had taken some pills and hung up saying goodbye.  I met the police at her place and the door ended up having to be forced open. She was rushed to hospital for an OD and had her stomach pumped.   She is stable now but resting and I just got out of my second meeting with the police, the first being filling out a report. I told them everything. This morning they had me back with them to read over the report to make sure there wasn't anything else that was needed.   Now I'm sitting here in my apartment having contacted her Mother who is with her at the hospital. She apologized to me deeply and begged me to drop any charges which I have. The police on the other had will be back to me with information if they plan to press charges against her for hitting me.   I feel hollow, confused, sad and scared. I called my own Mom who is on her way now to come pick me up. I also called work first thing this morning to tell them what was happening and I have been given a weeks paid leave.   I want to thank everyone who has ever talked to me on Reddit. It's nice to know there is a community out there beyond the trolls and the hurtful comments who want to truly help people in my situation.   I don't really know how to feel right now it's still really raw I guess. Thanks to everyone for your support and advice and just everything that you all have done for me.   To some people being alone is a frightening thing but Reddit really has made it easier for me and I cannot put into words how much I appreciate all of it.   -Mia"

And she said she is not meeting with him, but she thinks it´s unfair that I met with my ex but I´m not ok with her meeting him.  So I don´t think she´s actually gonna have him come over, but honestly the fact that to her it´s an issue at all baffles me and makes me suspicious.  Another fact that I wasn´t sure whether to include or not - when I met her friends recently I discovered she cheated on her then bf when they were in school. At the time I didn´t really care about that - youthful mistake and all that - but in this current context it does make me worry."
relationship_advice,3daliz,fack_yo_couch,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:26:26 2015 UTC,"Sir, I would consider it a glaring red flag that she would even consider inviting him over. The fact that she has a track record of cheating is especially alarming. What reasonable assurance do you have that she's changed? I mean, people do change, but their nature tends to stay the same. Anyway, in my experience (anecdotal, I know), people who say, ""trust me"" tend to be the least trustworthy people. Trustworthy people act trustworthy are usually beyond question. She is strawmanning you with the meeting with your ex because you were not alone, and not at her place I'm assuming. She wants to pull a double standard argument when none exists.  Your best recourse is to do nothing. I would step down my commitment to the relationship and keep her around as a FWB and a diversion until you find someone more trustworthy. I wouldn't even bring this up during a breakup. I'd just feed her a line like ""It's not you, it's me"" or ""I'm just not feeling it"" and pull the fade into greener pastures."

I mean, wtf?  As for the cheating thing - I was giving her the benefit of the doubt until this situation came up.

She would make things up about the guy to make him seem like this monster. I felt like I could help her so I began to flirt back, but I wouldn't do anything with her in a relationship. Eventually they broke up, she was looking for an excuse basically. Long story short we ended up dating for 6 months and she went back to the other guy and dated him for like 4 months. Tip of of advice, avoid ANY relationship like this, do not flirt back. You may start to see a trend where she trash talks her boyfriend all the time.

relationship_advice,3dazie,myliobatis,2,Wed Jul 15 01:35:38 2015 UTC,"I know how you feel in that therapists not helping. Truth is, they can't give you answers. They can get you to see things in a different light, but other than when, where, why, who, how, there's not much they do. I got over things by writing things down via a journal and typing out my feelings.   In the end, nobody will care as much as you will. In a way ""they don't see it from their house"", when they get off of work. Yes they may be helpful but you seem to be beyond that stage, in which you need to look deeper at what would make you the happiest.   I do't recommend medication but getting some helpers like Xanax or something to calm you down, may help. Or something to keep you focused. Try to stay away from the AntiDeps if you aren't on them. But your goal should be to help you, but you need to do most of the work.   Instead of looking for someone to solve your problems, look internally. What do you want? Go get it. Nothing will happen overnight. Get a routine. get involved in something that makes you happy. Change jobs. Make more money. Take a vacation. Get into a class at the gym. Staying busy and doing 1 hour of yoga or a spin class, will help clear your mind, at least for 1-2 hours. Burning calories and sweating it out, is much better than  sitting on a couch and exposing your life to someone that doesn't do much more than sit there like a brick wall. (Or at least how I felt.) Going home and getting in the shower after sweating and feeling neutral after a workout is much better than coming home crying wondering what happened in the therapy session.   The biggest point is that nobody has any answers, but being busy and having goals and looking forward to something, is what it's all about. get short term and long term goals. Like running 1 mile or 5 miles. Get recruiters to find a new job for you. If you aren't making changes, don't expect any changes to happen. You have to meet things halfway and overall making positive changes, you will definitely see results. More results than a therapist ever will.   Everyone has a past. But everyone also has a future as well. Get new goals. Get back into that sport that you play, or sign up for something. Go to concerts, or take up an instrument. Go to classes. Go back to school Whatever it is, but sign up for happiness in your life. Nobody will care as much as you will. Make changes that you want to see happen. Go with your gut on what's right for your relationships. Better yourself so you don't have to rely on others. This takes time but start making changes. Good luck."

relationship_advice,3dazie,Tempts,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:32:20 2015 UTC,"Good =D  So to your question: so, I am a therapist. And I have been in therapy off and on since I was 14. And it's very much like dating. You have to find a therapist that you click with. What helps is if you know what kind of things you are looking for. Or, what you specifically are not looking for. For example, I want nothing to do with therapists that counsel from their bible. So I steer clear of faith based counsellors. I know I like a therapist that has an open and accepting view of sex so someone who is sex positive is important to me. I also want someone who is very comfortable with cognitive behavioral therapy. And finally, I want a person who doesn't think they are the expert. I want therapy to be collaborative. So when I'm looking for a therapist I call and ask questions designed to find out if the person is all of those things. Then I go see them to see if I think it will work out. Only after that initial meeting do I get into heavier stuff if I'm comfortable.   You should totally be willing to do a similar thing with therapists in your area. And if any of them aren't willing to ""play ball"" with that getting to know you thing, to hell with them. They are too stuffy and uptight anyway. It's part of our business. We know their has to be a good fit. And not everyone matches up well. You have the right to try to make sure the therapist you trust is the right one for you.   I hope this helps."

relationship_advice,3dazie,1fuathyro,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:25:54 2015 UTC,"You have to sort of 'interview' a therapist depending on what you expect to get out of the therapy. But it's important that  you realize that all therapists do their business differently and may have their own individual goals when it comes to their clients.   For example, some therapist will only see you for so long, some will see you for years-depending on what their practice is like etc.   Also, why you want to see a therapist is just as important as going to go see one. Are  you expecting a replacement of your life coach because if you are, not sure if this is the place to go. Life coaches, in my experience are more available, less fixed in their 'techniques', for lack of better words etc.   Back to your therapy goals. Personally, I think a lot of people need to ask if the therapist knows any techniques that help with coping with bad habits/thoughts.  For example, you mentioned you have anxiety--that may cause you to over think negative events, CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) is a technique that may help someone to stop negative thoughts when they start. Yeah, you can get insight on this type of thing just by talking to a therapist but I'm a ""solve the problem"" type of person. I like to use 'tools' to get me through.  Don't get me wrong I do value psychoanalytic work--I've gotten a lot of help with that for my own life but I could have used a good  CBT therapist on some of my repetitive thinking (when something goes awry)...I cope with it okay but not without some damaging over thinking which just leaves me in knots for a bit.   Also, I think it would be a good idea for you to be open minded to what a therapist has to say. The reason I say that is that you mentioned red flags about  your husband that wasn't really what was the issue to begin with (and then became one). You need to understand that the way you perceive your issues is different than how an outside observer views things and that is not necessarily a bad thing.  If you react badly to what you do not want to hear, or didn't expect to hear, you could be missing some important observations from an unbiased 3rd party. Stay open minded. And don't be defensive. Own up to it when you are doing this-it doesn't help you if you don't.   One last thing, I've never met anyone who had a perfect therapist...In fact, when they are just ""too good to be true"" that's when I start questioning some kind of transference (ie the therapist is too chumy with you and may not be seeing you as a client but a friend which is not good), so maybe not having that perfect connection is not necessarily a bad thing-a therapist is not your friend, nor are they a life coach (in my view totally different-a job coach has a different role but even then there are limits), they are, for lack of better words, a guide to your own decisions-the ones that ultimately you will make (good or bad).   Lastly, remember to have confidence in your assessments in life--a therapist (or a coach) is not a replacement for your own judgement."

My (current?) therapist Google'd me, added me on LinkedIn and found my blog. This not only freaked me out, but she then raved during my next session how ""successful"" I am -- at that moment, I was no longer her client. I'm well educated and professionally successful, so you're right -- I didn't quite become her friend, but I became her peer. As a result, her ""advice"" became more more personal -- instead of asking ""what's really going on"" it was like we were having cocktails for an hour and she was over-protective of me as in a social way -- not as her client."
relationship_advice,3dazie,ahhpuddingcontrol,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:35:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had a therapist get all giddy when I mentioned I had just started dating a guy, kind of like a girlfriend would trying to get the  details of the new guy  in your life. The problem in this case is that part of the reason I went to therapy was to process a break up from someone who I had been with since the age of 16 and we had only been broken up a handful of months (and I was already dating). I expected more of a ""whoah there"", instead of a ""that a girl!."" I went to one more session and stopped going.   Now whether these therapists crossed any lines or just bordered on 'inappropriate' and just not a smart, I suppose is besides the point but the cool thing is that we both instinctively realized that is not what we 'needed' in someone who was to be our 'guide', so to speak.   I ended up seeing someone who was a bit stand-offish but she was perfect for me. She was smart, intuitive and gave me some bits of wisdom that have stuck with me to this day. I would give her your name if I could remember it! It's been ages since I've seen her.   Anyway, good luck with your search. You will know when you find the right person. Just ask the right questions and don't give up on them too soon (unless they immediately show signs that they are not the one, as you discovered already)."

You control what you say to her and she's responsible for her own reaction. If the thought of traveling with her at this time fills you with dread rather than excitement, then clearly you should not go. There's only so many ways to say that to a person. How will your relationship improve by you caving in, spending money you don't have and resenting your girlfriend for pressuring you and not listening to you?"

relationship_advice,3dabyo,Lazy_IT_guy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:55:44 2015 UTC,"Compromise is huge, and it's good that you offered to go for 2 weeks, given your perspective on money and college. You need to say the words ""I'm willing to compromise on this, and hoping you can see things from my side.""  Are you okay with her going for longer, and you meeting up with her during 2 weeks? Would that be a problem?  If you were blowing though your savings and don't have much saved since last vacation, it's not the smartest. As you'd want money to pay rent or for college or whatever comes up with life's woes.   I think it's rather awesome to consider going for a shorter amount of time. You need to make it clear that you want to go, and love traveling with her. And you're trying to compromise by going for those 2 weeks. And maybe tell her how little money you have and how much of a financial stress it may cause. You don't have a job (I assume), and the student debt will continue to grow if you live life like you do have an income.  The compromise, and the entire damn point of it, is for people to be flexible and for everyone to get what they want. It's not just her relationship or her trip.  The compromise is the problem, not the length of trip. What happens when she wants to live in the fancy town and you want to live closer to both of your offices for work? Or where your child goes to school. Or how much she wants to spend on the wedding, or dogs, or what kind of cars you look at, or whatnot.   To me, the hanging up on you when you are trying to work with her, is rather childish. She may have ulterior motives to this argument. Have you argued or has she been this upset about other trivial matters?"

It's nothing she should have asked your permission for IMO.  However, if it bothers you, I would think that you could mention it in a non confrontational way.

How did you come across this information? You did say she did not tell you directly, but did you find out this information in a way that you were not expected to find out? If so, that may be some cause for concern regarding the levels of disclosure and trust in the relationship; but if it's something that you would normally have access to otherwise then maybe that's something you can talk about and get the story straight."

relationship_advice,3daeok,erthrrs,2,Tue Jul 14 19:28:16 2015 UTC,I think it's understandable that you felt uneasy. Still a relatively new relationship and you're still trying to negotiate and understand a whole new communication dynamic than you've been used to. But as long as you keep your head on your shoulders and keep working on communicating and negotiating between the two of you that'll eventually smooth things out and you'll feel much more comfortable.

relationship_advice,3d7jtj,Justagreewithme,8,Tue Jul 14 11:58:50 2015 UTC,"Sex operates on a lot of sliding scales. Frequency, intensity, desire, etc. People experience natural ebbs and flows to their desire and propensity to engage in intimate behavior. It is, to me, very significant that an anti-depressant is involved. I have experienced the steep drop in sexual desire and drive firsthand at varying levels on different medications, and have plenty of firsthand accounts from other people of this same effect, which is very common among serotonin production-based meds. Sex for a woman can be very uncomfortable if she isn't aroused thanks to vaginal dryness and other factors. It is imperative that you not initiate sex until her sexual dysfunction, if it turns out to be that, is resolved. You presumably masturbated while she was away. Get reacquainted with Palmela Handerson.  Regarding the idea that she would have experienced these symptoms all along if the meds were at fault, that simply isn't the case. An increase in dosage or moving from one medication to another can cause significant sexual dysfunction symptoms. Also, symptoms may present essentially with no provocation other than continued use. Your brain - hopefully - adjusts to having the correct amount of serotonin (or norepinephrine, etc. depending on the type of med), and medication effectiveness can even wane because of this. The effects of even the most well-researched depression meds are not completely understood, and outcomes and symptoms vary greatly case by case. Anyway, the point is, your girlfriend seems to be indicating that it's the medication, and not knowing the situation intimately, that appears to be the most likely explanation.  Regarding the idea of seeking out a libido boost for her, right now there is basically zilch for women. There's a drug being reviewed by the FDA right now, but it'll be a while before it's available (if it becomes available). Things like peppermint oil gels and lotions can provide a small bump because of the pleasing sensation they give, but that's a bandage. If she has never used a high-intensity vibrator such as a Hitachi Magic Wand before, that could be of some benefit. Speaking from experience, a good vibrator can turn a woman's sex life around. If she doesn't experience the desire to use it, don't push the subject.  Regarding not having much sensation, she may be experiencing anorgasmia, the inability to orgasm. This is common among people of all sexes taking depression meds, and I've had it. It is truly rage-inducing. The state of having an extremely low sex drive to the point of being medically or psychologically significant is called hypoactive sexual desire disorder (note: hypo, not hyper, which means the opposite). If this is causing your girlfriend personal distress, she can seek out help from her psychiatrist, who will be familiar with this disorder and able to treat her or refer her to a specialist. Remember: I am not a doctor and this is not a diagnosis. This is something for your girlfriend, if she chooses to, discuss with her health care professional. I am noting the many commonalities that I have experienced with my story and those of many other people who have had these and similar issues, though, and it would behoove her health to explore this with a doctor.  Regarding her seeming lack of desire to change, I can't say anything specific about that. Other people on here will read into that and tell you stupid things like she doesn't love you or she is into someone else. Ignore that. It's highly unlikely. She has stayed with you over a long distance, which at your age is usually relationship ending. Depression, by its very nature, makes you want to curl up into a ball and stay in your room and do nothing. Without knowing the two of you, I can't ascribe her seeming acceptance of the circumstances to any particular motivation or lack thereof. It would be irresponsible. I'll merely say that depression inhibits your ability to seek out happiness in many different ways. It's only through talk therapy in conjunction with medication, if necessary, that strides can be made to understanding one's particular brand of depression and the way it manifests itself. You can be her greatest ally if you choose to act lovingly and patiently and help her through this. That you took the time to seek and read advice indicates that you will make that effort. It will help to shape you as a man, regardless of the outcome.  P.S. What's absolutely crucial is that you always maintain the agreed upon fidelity in your relationship, both sexual and emotional. You didn't express a desire to change your relationship format to include additional partners, so I'm guessing you're not interested in that and neither is she. Both partners must be rigorously emotionally prepared for open relationships to work, and most fail because the participants are not equally invested in the idea. Don't open your relationship solely as a solution to this problem.  Go out and make your own luck."

I am sorry to hear about the situation you are in, but it looks like your SO is unwilling to cope with you or attempt in making a mutual action towards something (be it trying suggestions, or stating something completely different).  While being hotheaded and opinionated can come off as annoying, I find that being passive is even more detrimental (and more mentally taxing by making someone doubt oneself).  You already received good and objective (while critical) feedback so I hope you can make a good decision based on the advice! Good luck."
relationship_advice,3d7jtj,DukeCounter,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:02:41 2015 UTC,"Sometimes we should ask different questions.  you ask why isn't she sleeping with me?, but maybe you should ask what I am doing that is making her not want to sleep with me?  But that's really for your future relationships when you're older. I really hate giving good people bad news, but given the age of both of you, chances are she has found someone else.    I have been on anti-depressants for nearly two years, if anything, my sex drive has increased, so I wouldn't count those chickens yet.   It really sounds like you've done everything you can reasonably do.  If you really want her, run dread game, that's about the only hope you have, but even that is a relationship based on dishonesty, which is never good.    If she isn't interested in having sex with you anymore and its important to you, then perhaps you should find someone who is."

If she isn't willing on figuring out what is going on and trying to fix it (my guess is the antidepressant) then you need to decide if that is a deal breaker.   Talk to her let her know this may be a deal breaker.   Personally it would be a deal breaker for me.

She actually had a pretty bad ending with one guy who she never even talks to (actually she avoids him like the plague) but we got a chance to talk over things - both casually and seriously - and we never got too emotional or heated in these conversations.

relationship_advice,3d8zhp,hope_youll_join_us,3,Tue Jul 14 19:56:19 2015 UTC,"Most simple, basic answer: Totally inappropriate.   If you say anything along those lines all you're doing is tipping your hand. Best case scenario is she pretends you didn't say anything and doesn't tell her boyfriend. Worst case she feels like you don't respect her relationship, cuts you out of her life, and tells her bf (who might not take kindly to the implication that you want to get lucky with his girlfriend).

I even tell her I will attend church once a month with her to make her happy.  She continues to ""have hope for me"". She says she doesn't know if she should stay with a non-believer, or if she should divorce me (because both are sins). She has been ""on the fence"" about this for 3 years.

relationship_advice,3dabsy,LateStar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:26:06 2015 UTC,"I've briefly looked up various opinions on what the difference is, and am still unclear. I've always liked this bodytype over others, though the few past partners I've had weren't chubby - but I didn't choose them by looks, met through forums over initially being interesting in how they think. My life is in flux right now and I value my independence and career goals so currently FWB is a better fit, therefore I placed more emphasis on looking for who I'd be hot for appearance-wise over other compatibility aspects. I don't know, but I AM hoping that someone I'm in a srs relationship with would be on the heavier/pudgy side and have a beard (though this means we would have to compromise on the a/c temperature since I'm always cold. LOL yes I've thought this part through just in case.) Beard is just, well, I cant help it. I can dream."
relationship_advice,3dabsy,Happilymarriedman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:14:36 2015 UTC,"My bad, not pudgy...rather heavier than pudgy. Looked that up, english not first language and didnt know what body it is commonly used to describe. Thought it was same as chubby."
relationship_advice,3dabsy,Happilymarriedman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:56:15 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid of being judged or openly disclosing my preferences since apparently this isn't too common, and might make me sound shallow   The shallowness is on them - not you - and if by disclosing means you are uncomfortable or fear of being judged by being seen with your date 'type' in public then that is an insecurity you just have to learn to overcome.   If disclosing means you do not want to tell anyone of what your preference is then you need to accept that it is your prerogative to do so. It is your business - not theirs. If you just say 'no thank you' with compassion no one will see you as a bitch.   Don't strive for finding someone who appreciates you for your body type. Find someone who appreciates you. It will last much longer."

relationship_advice,3d8ggu,Miabutterfly,2,Tue Jul 14 09:16:35 2015 UTC,"That's an awful situation, and I'm sorry that you're in it.   Personally, I was in that kind of a situation with an ex about 5 months ago. I realized that the relationship was toxic when I saw how much happier my friends were than I was. The way I ended things was I just left. I told her I didn't want to see her anymore and I moved back in with my parents for a short time - they were very supportive, if not happy that I was moving on with my life, and provided a safe haven from my ex.   I'm a 21 M, and I was being abused by this girl - I had some significant bruising, enough that I was being asked about it at work. Shortly after ending things with the ex, I came clean at work. Now, mind you, I work part time at a tax firm, but my boss is an amazing man. He gave me the week off paid (which, wtf, I'm part time! Awesome) and told me that if there was anything I needed I could come to him.   I get that that's unique, and I'm not saying you should tell everyone at work what was going on, but I believe that you should really look at the options that are open to you. Maybe reporting her to the police is the right course of action (probably is), or maybe you should just tell her things are over and distance yourself from her as much as you possibly can. I don't really know exactly the entire situation, so I don't know how much more help I can be - if I was of any help.  tl;dr, look at the options available to you and pursue the one you believe to end in the best possible fashion."
relationship_advice,3d8ggu,Jungleoboe,6,Tue Jul 14 11:02:49 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for your support. I think I'm going to text her and leave her stuff outside in a box with a letter and try not to be here when she comes to pick it up.   I'm scared she will try to come in or something.

Please wish me luck because this is the first time I'm dealing with something like this alone.

relationship_advice,3da33e,SandyJ8,0,Tue Jul 14 19:00:27 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from. This behavior has been new, and I was really starting to fall for him. But maybe you're right."
relationship_advice,3da33e,LateStar,3,Wed Jul 15 19:11:03 2015 UTC,"First, don't attempt to have a meaningful conversation with someone under the influence of anything - they probably will not remember it at all or they will remember something very different from you. It is pointless.   Talk to him when he is sober and in a calm submissive way.   Second, don't fall for their rhetoric. ""Nobody loves me"" should not be seen as an opportunity to manifest your love for them; saying ""but I love you"" is pointless. It is not about that. Instead ask him to describe why he feels that way, what he thinks needs to be done for the feeling to change and offer support in the actions he needs to take.   In short: what of his actions has made this situation, and how can he change to prevent it from happening again.   He is in a downward spiral and his situation is tough. That is something he must accept and be willing to change. Going out drunk on a daily basis isn't the solution. Is he willing to see that? Is he willing to change? Those questions must be answered with a yes for this relationship to have a prosperous outcome.   That is the discussion you need to have - and if you are afraid of your wellbeing you should simply remove yourself from him so he can self destruct on his own. Some people need to hit the bottom before they get moving upwards again and to what extent you are willing to be there is up to you."
relationship_advice,3da33e,shrewgoddess,0,Tue Jul 14 19:09:11 2015 UTC,"Yes! I know this, good advice. I haven't tried to speak to him about it yet.   I mentioned that I wanted to talk to him, and he of course denied anything was going on. So I'm going to try and bring it up again in person.   And you're right. That makes me feel better that I didn't tell him I loved and cared about him when he was saying that. If he says something like that again I'll say what you suggested.   He sees that it's not a solution, but I don't think he's willing to change right now.   I think he might move back home next month. So maybe that will be for the best for both of us."
relationship_advice,3da33e,shrewgoddess,3,Wed Jul 15 19:22:41 2015 UTC,"This is an incredibly difficult position to be in. I'm sure most people will say that you should just dump him, because it's only been seven months and so it should be easy.   You should, but it won't necessarily be easy. Here's the thing about dating someone who is an alcoholic - it's hard. Hard doesn't even cover it, really. It can be done, but it's not really a healthy relationship and it doesn't really go the way a good relationship should go. Here's a few things to keep in mind:  You can't help him unless he's willing to help himself. You can stand by him as he makes the effort to get sober and clean, but that all has to come from him and that's the worst part. If he were trying, and honestly wanted to be, sober and clean, then you could help him if that was your desire. Without that, though, he will always be drunk and high.  It will get harder for you as time goes on. You may stay with him, thinking that if you can just find the one magic phrase that will make him want to be clean. You won't. And in the meantime, you will care for him more and more and you will become more desperate to save him. Eventually, something will happen and you'll have to end the relationship, and it will be worse than it would be if you just do it now.  He will promise you that he'll stop drinking and snorting coke. He will be lying.   You are afraid for your own safety. There are times when it's appropriate to care more for someone else's safety than your own - your children, your elderly parents, for example. NOT your seven month boyfriend. And DEFINITELY NOT when the danger comes from said seven month boyfriend.  My suggestion would be to end things with him, then cut contact. After that, you may want to seek some therapy if this is a pattern for you. Good luck."
relationship_advice,3da33e,shrewgoddess,0,Tue Jul 14 19:29:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice.  I don't think he's willing to help himself, and I'm feeling really tired of trying to help him while he makes little to no effort on his own. I can't do that.   Thank you fro pointing out that it's not about me. There is nothing I can do or say. He needs to get better on his own.   He went out drinking last night and was still drunk when I spoke to him today. I don't have the ability to help him through this.   I'm in therapy now, as it's been a pattern of mine to see people who don't have their shit together based on relationships I've dealt with growing up. I was hoping this would be different, but I think maybe I'm just repeating another pattern.   I know if I stick with it, I'll just end of leaving broken and drained.   Thank you for the kind words. I hope that he can pull himself out of this. I really do care, I just can't sacrifice my life for his."

I'm sure your therapist has told you this, but I've found it to be true - wait at least a year before getting into another relationship. You'll figure out how to be alone, which makes it easier to leave this stuff behind. You'll also learn that being alone is better than being with someone else and miserable.   It will get easier with time and, eventually, you may be able to be friends with him. But above all, you have to value yourself, too. You are worth it. :) Good luck."

relationship_advice,3d5mpz,eddiecollins,55,Mon Jul 13 18:38:00 2015 UTC,"Hey man.  I'm sorry you have to go through this.  Having been through a divorce myself, I'll offer you a little advice.  First thing you need to do is find an attorney who specializes in family law - even better if they specialize in father's rights.  Google is your friend and fine one in your state and even your county as laws around divorce can change even from county to county.  If you have any MALE friends who have had a divorce, ask them for recommendations.  Request a free consultation.  Go in, tell them EVERYTHING and leave nothing out.  They will tell you what to do.  You do everything that they tell you to do.  I know you said you don't want to fuck her over, but remember there is a difference between protecting yourself and hurting her.  Only give her the legal minimum for your state and county in child support and alimony and request shared custody.  I'd consider that generous for what she has done.  Do not move out until your attorney tells you its okay to do so.  Do not discuss what you are doing with your wife.  If possible, put on a face like nothing is wrong, but do not give in to her physical advances.  You suddenly have a case of migraines.  You are a rock now and you let your attorney steer what you do.    Here's the thing about all divorces.  They suck.  They are hard, they hurt, and you will go through depression.  When I went through mine, I lived by one rule.  Everything I did, everything I said, was in the best interest of my daughter.  Shit is going to get stirred up.  Don't get sucked into it.  NEVER say anything bad about your ex in front of your children and do not let your friends or family badmouth her in front of your kids.  She may be a lying cheat, but she is still their mother and those kids have a right to love their mother even if you do not.  And if she tries to hold your kids hostage (as mine did), you take it to your attorney because you can get a temporary visitation order declared.  Your entire world is going to be torn apart.  It is not going to be fun.  Having little ones involved is going to be hard.  After a while though, you start to see the light at the end of the tunnel.  You find a new life without the cheating ex.  You can find happiness with your kids.  Good luck brother.  Stay strong and focus on those girls."

Go to /r/deadbedrooms.  You may get some perspective on things there.   she met this guy recently, and they went hiking. When they were done - they stopped by the apartment, she took a shower, he had a drink, and according to her - this was it. ... I asked her how she is communicating with him - she said it's by texts, and she deletes those texts.   Yeah, she is having sex with that guy.  I would not bother thinking about her bullshit story at all.  She is having sex with him.  You should go to /r/survivinginfidelity to get some perspective.

Don't be angry (of course you are for good reasons), don't say anything about phone records or the car. Just tell her straight up, that you're really not into this bullshit and that she needs to be straight with you right now. And then give her a chance to talk. If she replies with one liners, tell her that you really thought you could talk to each other. Go and leave and tell her that she can call you when she's ready to be honest. And don't even start arguing with her if she gives you the ""I'm alone in this relationship""-crap. That's absurd."

Doesn't matter really.  Her stories are very very fishy to boot.  If you have any friends who have gotten a divorce, ask them who they used and if they liked them.  Otherwise google ""best family law attorney in <your city>"".  Pay them a visit.  Someone else here said ""tell them everything"".  I disagree with this.  If you are in a no fault state (google to find that out), you want to tell the attorney what you want.  If you want to blab about how it sucks to be cuckholded, hire a therapist to vent on.  An attorney is going to only care about getting what you want.  You don't want to screw her over?  Thats fine.  Tell the attroney what you think is a fair deal and ask how realistic it is to obtain.  Don't settle.  Your wife WILL fuck you over (she already is doing that cheating on you).  She will try to tug the hell out of any heartstring she can manipulate to get you to soften up... be ready."

So these are the people respected (and feared) by their piers.  Before I knew about that site, the way I found a divorce lawyer was asking another lawyer for a recommendation. The person told me ""Oh this is the guy I hate to fight in court.."" (He was an ex-Marine from Alabama.) That's the guy I went with, and he was great.  You want a family law lawyer. Do NOT get a generalist. It's a very specific kind of law. This person isn't your therapist, they bill in 6 minute increments, so be all business. Get ALL your financials together. Play along with the cheating wife. Let her think you're a chump, and get those papers together and evidence if you're in a fault state.   Do NOT reveal your hand. She sounds like a serial cheater.

relationship_advice,3d5mpz,pointofinformation,4,Sun Jul 19 14:43:35 2015 UTC,"I'm going to take a contrary position here. So your wife probably has a sexual relationship with another guy... does this have to be the end of the story?  Would it be possible to simply approach her and ask, 'OK I think you're sleeping with someone else. I understand our relationship has suffered in the past... do you think we can work this out and improve our intimacy and everything else?  This could be a new beginning. I know plenty of people (like say, half my male friends) who have had extramarital affairs. Some realize they did it because they hadn't worked through issues in their marriage. Others simply weren't aware of problems, and acted out. Ask yourself about the root causes... the sex with other people is a side issue. Getting hung up on infidelity for its own sake is not productive."
relationship_advice,3d5mpz,chumplady,2,Tue Jul 14 03:39:18 2015 UTC,"It seems too late for that approach, though. This was clearly emotional infidelity, the sex was just a byproduct of that. Once a person breaks the emotional fidelity of a relationship, it's nearly impossible to recover. From what I have gotten from others, you can't really unpop the cork of distrust. There is a permanent malaise of skepticism that just seeps into every small detail of daily life, and most of us can't turn the other cheek that many times per week. The long period of sexual disinterest and the communication behavior is textbook. This marriage is long over, but for the paperwork. The future is the thing that needs to take shape."
relationship_advice,3d5mpz,MochiMochiMochi,2,Tue Jul 14 08:28:20 2015 UTC,"A side issue? What about the staggering disrespect? Making unilateral decisions about his health? Risking his family's home life? Lying to his face?  Open relationships are discussed openly, at the beginning of a relationship. She got busted for cheating. The secrecy and getting over on him is part of the high. That's a character issue not a monogamy issue.   Poly people can be cheated on too. All it takes is any kind of rule, and cheaters can break them."
relationship_advice,3d5mpz,SandyJ8,0,Tue Jul 14 10:51:18 2015 UTC,"True, but we're seeing all this after the fact. OP has clearly stated that his wife wasn't feeling romantic towards him, and the intimacy suffered until it reached /r/deadbedroom status.  OP may be doing something serious to cause this situation. We just don't know. And in that kind of tense atmosphere, expecting OP's wife to start an open relationships discussion is unlikely. Most people just aren't that reasonable. I'd say the lying and disrespect are likely fatal to the relationship, but it's only OP who knows if there could be seeds of reconciliation that lead to a true romantic partnership."

You guys have too much history to throw it all away over some fling that may not even mean anything to her.  The fact that you didn't know about this guy means that she is bored and looking for attention. The big red flag is that she didn't tell you about him. Why not? If you aren't best friends and you don't know everything about each other, then I'd say you should see a marriage counselor and try to work out some of the walls that may have been built up between you and your lover over the years.

You are 25yo.  In theory, the age gap is too large to be workable.  But there is theory and then there is real life.  How this works out depends upon how compatible the two of you are, so while you could probably expect there to be issue arise because of the age gap there is nothing to say that you can't work through them and have a good life together.  Heck, my sister-in-law is married with kids to a guy ten years younger than her - and they are just fine together.  There are plenty of relationships out there where the guy is older and the girl younger, it's not uncommon.    It's all about working out what the two of you want.  Having kids will be a significant factor that is likely to crop up early on in all this too.  In all seriousness, assuming this relationship goes somewhere, if he doesn't want to leave having kids until he's quite old, you are likely going to have to think about pregnancy and kids in the next few years.  How does that sit with you personally and professionally?"

relationship_advice,3d7uef,LeMachina,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:20:58 2015 UTC,"You probably need to get up the courage to tell him that you've enjoyed spending your time with him, and that you'd like to exclusively date him and won't be seeing other people while with him.  Tell him that you'd think it was great if he felt the same way.    It doesn't feel much more evolved than what we did at High School when we first start dating - but it's the same principle after-all.  It's about slowly turning a casual uncertain thing into something more reliable and certain that makes you feel comfortable with whatever it is that you have.  There is going to have to be a certain amount of tentative probing and risk-taking to progress things.  And yeah, it is difficult to say what he might or might not want out of all this.  The professional gap is harder to deal with because you haven't given much information about it, about what you do, or your feelings about mixing relationships and business."

relationship_advice,3d7uef,hopda-dada,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:50:11 2015 UTC,There is a rule ;-) The youngest you are allowed to date is half your age plus seven. 35 /2 = 17.5 + 7 = 24.5. You are 25yo.   I am 49 so I can date someone who is 32? 49/2 = 24.5+7= 31.5  I can date someone 17 years my junior but the 36 y/o guy cannot date a 25 y/o?  Where did you get this formula? And what is the basis of it?
relationship_advice,3d7uef,notevenapro,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:57:38 2015 UTC,"Where did you get this formula?   I thought that everyone knew this.   And what is the basis of it?    The basis is that it is a way of figuring out if you're getting creepy - or not.  Date someone too young and it gets a) awkward, b) a little creepy.  It's a joke.  It's humour.  Having said that, I've known about this ""rule"" since I was at high school, and it's not entirely inaccurate."

relationship_advice,3d83or,anonymous189,7,Tue Jul 14 06:29:29 2015 UTC,"It's actually none of your business. It really is that simple. Imagine if you had never found out or your dad decided to tell you at some later point? Everybody keeps secrets from one another, it is all part of their need to assert their self-autonomy. Are there not things about yourself that you like to keep private because that is just you and your instinct about it is quite arbitrary? It could be that this development is quite recent and it might not go any further. Would you tell everyone if you had just started off in a new relationship or would you maybe hold back about it until you felt more certain about it?  Bottom line, take a figurative step back and think some of these possibilities through and ask yourself whether it would be wise to get involved or to make any unwarranted assumptions about it."
relationship_advice,3d83or,Vu70n0m0v5,3,Tue Jul 14 09:04:44 2015 UTC,You should discretely let your dad know that it is okay if he dates someone and that you will be there to listen to and support him if he does. Then let him make the next move on whether or not he tells you. His keeping it from you might just be his delusional idea of protecting you and your mothers memory.  Talk to your dad about it. Go to counseling. Start trying to understand why it upsets you so much and then try to find a way to resolve those issues. Talking to your dad is a good place to start.

That you feel sad is normal. You are not immature. You still have to cope with loss. Dealing with those feelings, however, is what makes you and mature adult.  It seems as if this is not a fling but a serious relationship (pictures etc.) - so you should ask, not ""confront"" your father that you found those things and are confused why he is hiding her from you.  It could be an awesome opportunity to get to know your father better and hear his side of the story.  You should tell your dad how you feel, and also if you need time to cope with.  I think he wanted to be considerate and not confront you with his new life situation, as you did not have a pretty close relationship anyway.  Give him a chance."

You're an adult and you know what adult relationships should be like and he shouldn't be alone.  Adult relationships differ from parental relationships. Some good parents are bad partners and some great partners are horrible parents.

He doesn't want to risk that now that you've finally started to heal, even though these are completely different circumstances. And as you can see, he was probably right to do so because you are reacting irrationally.  Here are your options: 1) if you can get over your immature reaction, tell him that you're glad he's doing good and you hope he's happy with the relationship, but he doesn't have to justify or explain anything to you.  2) If you can't do that, say nothing."

With that being said I think it may have freaked her out a bit.  I'm not sure what you said verbatim but if you told her you were insecure she may have been a little deterred by that.  This girl sounds like she has had some experience and like a hands on, assertive physical relationship.  Typically insecurity does not fall into that equation.    I would suggest (if you really like the girl and not just trying to get laid) putting the insecurities aside if you will.  Fake it til' you make it type thing.  I don't know if she wants to ""be with you"" but she sounds like she was having some fun with you for a little while.  Try not to focus too much on where you are lacking and focus more on what you can bring to the table.  Stay confident."

You may be deeper than you think... her thinking you're ""lazy"" may have less to do with the couch and more to do with outward signs you're showing of your depression. Regardless of what's happening in your marriage, you need to be on top of your own mental health.   She says she'll make it hell for me and refuse to sign the papers.    If she's trying to say she loves you and wants to fight the divorce, that's one thing, but it sounds more just like revenge? Have you tried asking her questions and letting her talk?

relationship_advice,3d4rl6,riffdex,0,Tue Jul 14 13:53:35 2015 UTC,"Divorces generally work like this in 99% of first world countries where marriages aren't glorified arrangements for selling women as sex slaves:  You serve her the papers. She signs affirmative that she also wants a divorce. Proceed to divorce.  You serve her the papers. She signs negative in wanting the divorce. This just means extra legal proceedings but the divorce is going through just the same.  You serve her the papers. She refuses to sign them at all. You engage in some legal process that acknowledges you've officially served her and wait a pre-determined amount of time (to give her a chance). The court takes her unwillingness to either affirm or deny a divorce as a no contest and you get the divorce anyway with her fighting from a much less advantageous position now.  Nobody can force someone else to stay married in the first world. It's a common misconception that ""refusing to sign"" means the courts won't grant the divorce. They will in 100% of cases.

Find a good lawyer and listen to their advice. Take a day off work and move your stuff and take your dog. Meet her at home when she's off work and tell her you're filing for divorce. All communication can go through your lawyer. She can't not get a divroce. It may take a little longer but someone can't stop a divorce from happening. Stop having sex now pregnancy would ruin everything. Don't do any of this until she gets her next period. Know for sure she isn't pregnant and mark the date.

Things I was yelled at for recently:  -falling asleep on a plane, and being groggy when woken up to look at some magazine article  -getting sand on the GoPro (which was safely in its protective case) at the beach  -getting sand on her at the beach  -getting sand on myself at the beach  -taking a shower at 10:30am, because someone was sleeping in the next room  -going to sleep before taking a shower despite showering 8 hours prior  -asking that embarassing pictures of myself be deleted from her phone   -making too much noise while making her pancakes.  She didn't mention she was going to be on phone the whole time I was cooking for her.  -not cleaning enough after making her pancakes, how to clean a kitchen without making noise so as not to disturb her calls... No win here  -buying her a gift for no reason that she liked, then getting shamed because it was not very expensive  -buying her several gifts, getting yelled at because she didn't like one of them  -not shutting off my car engine while waiting for her to come out so I could give her a ride, despite her being late  -showing up at her apartment when she asked me to, because she was flirting with another guy ""in order to get him to rent the place from her""  -being a sober cab for her drunk friends, one of which was so fucked up that he was creating a dangerous situation in traffic.  I should have been nicer, apparently.  This was all in the past two weeks or so.  Didn't mean to rant so much, but it sounded familiar.  It sounds like she's just trying to push you away man, that's how it was for me anyway.  I endured it for awhile, longer than she thought it would I guess, until she snapped and said she'd never speak to me again over something trivial.  You need to get out of this, but you should plan a ahead.  Do you have a good friend who can take your dog for awhile?  Tell her you gave it away, give it a couple weeks, then file for divorce.

relationship_advice,3d4rl6,idhavetocharge,7,Mon Jul 13 17:33:07 2015 UTC,"That's horrible advice.  Either the dog belongs to the OP and it's not an issue or it's marital property and subject to the divorce proceedings.  If the OP does what you're suggesting and it comes out in the divorce proceedings (and if it gets as bad as the wife is threatening, it will come out), the OP risks losing the dog, getting stuck with penalties by the judge, and is in a much weaker position in the divorce."

Unless OP has a microchip in the dog or for some bizarre reason has had DNA tests performed on the dog or the dog has some really obvious unique markings like surgery scars from a trip to the vet there's really not much she can do to go after the dog after the fact.

I missed the old guy so much I went out and got another one that reminded me of him.""  /case  He can even arrange for a friend to ""sell"" him the dog later and exchange paperwork and everything for the sale of the ""new dog"" (who just happens to be the same breed).

I would have fought tooth and nail and may have resorted to any and every last dirty trick if was forced to go to court over my dog.   What should he do? Make ridiculous demands and force her to give up the dog before he drops them? Offer her something she can't resist?   Just as a hypothetical I'm curious what would be a lawyers advice."
relationship_advice,3d4rl6,stealthgerbil,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:52:49 2015 UTC,"Well, I can't speak to specific cases, but the key would be establishing ownership of the pet.  It varies which is why anyone in this situation needs to talk to a lawyer ASAP and make sure the lawyer knows upfront that keeping the dog is one of your biggest priorities.    But generally, to keep a pet in a divorce, you want to establish ownership early on, which basically means act as though it's your dog.  A few examples:  *Make sure all paperwork is in your name.  Adoption, microchip registration, training classes, the account at the vet, the account at the groomer's, the registration.  Basically, make sure that anything that involves a name has your name and your name only.  *Take care of the dog.  Buy the dog food and other supplies yourself.  Feed the dog.  Take care of the water.  Take it outside.  Walk it.  Play with it.  Don't ask your spouse to take them out or walk them.    *Be the face people see when they deal with your dog.  Make sure your number is the contact number.  Take your dog to the vet.  Take it to the groomers, trainer classes, whatever.  If you haven't already done this, then the best approach is to take over as much care as possible and get as much stuff in your name.  Beyond that, the lawyer can put pressure on the other party and also offer concessions."
relationship_advice,3d4rl6,Qikdraw,-2,Tue Jul 14 01:16:44 2015 UTC,"i honestly dont see how it will come out, unless your friend is incompetent.  what is the judge going to do? force you to find a dog who ran away? how is she going to prove that you took the dog away?   in fact, you can even go as far as say, i offered x amount for my missing dog, have looked around for x weeks, you can do alot of things to not arouse suspicion.   also remember i said only do this if you know 100% you MIGHT lose the dog to your spiteful wife.  ive been in this situation countless of times, i hid dogs for my friends and they came back a week/month later and it never was found out because they obviously dont live together anymore so she has no way to find out.   EDIT: you seem to be missing my point, i said only do this if hes NOT sure he can get the dog.  if i was in his shoes and i couldn't prove the dogs mine (even though it is), like i lost the papers or something, or i got the dog from my relatives so it didn't come with papers, hiding it was my only solution."
relationship_advice,3d4rl6,tsukinon,0,Mon Jul 13 22:37:24 2015 UTC,"ONo, you presented it as the best option.  To quote your post:   OR or you can do the tedious paper work thing and prove the dog is yours, but she might pull the ""our son loves the dog, i want him with us"" so i would go with the hide the dog part.   From what the OP said, it seems that he would have a very easy time proving ownership of the dog. Instead, you're suggesting that he go through this big, elaborate scheme because it worked for your friends.  From a legal standpoint, I can tell you this stunt has the potential to cost him a lot of money and possibly the dog.  It's also a very good way to get fired by your divorce lawyer.  If a client pulled did something this stupid and lied to me about it, if I found out, he would be looking for a new lawyer.  Also, ownership papers aren't the only way of proving ownership.  If the OP has taken care of the dog, walked and fed him, taken the dog to all vet appointments and has the account in his name, he's almost certainly going to be able to get the dog, especially if his wife if threatening to make the divorce harder because of spite.  Your suggestion has the potential to undermine that.  But we're both random people on the Internet and who knows?  Maybe we're lying about our experiences and both of us are giving totally fake and bad advice.  This is why the OP needs to talk to a lawyer ASAP (preferably before mentioning divorce to his wife) and find the appropriate way to proceed."

relationship_advice,3d4rl6,daddydearest_1,2,Mon Jul 13 18:02:11 2015 UTC,"Regarding her making it a living hell if you divorce. Get a lawyer. Call your state BAR association, they'll ask what type of lawyer you need and give you a number to call. This is not shopping through the yellow pages looking for the biggest ad. Usually the BAR will only give out good references. The $3k I paid for an immigration issue was well worth the money we spent.  If she is not willing to change, then you need to protect yourself and get out of that situation.  I would also suggest that anything that is yours, that you want to keep safe, you get out of your place so she cannot sell or damage anything. You can ask the lawyer if there is any way to put a stop to sales or giving away of any property owned singly or joined until the divorce is complete. I have no idea if you can, but it is something to ask. Make sure you tell him you want the dog no matter what.  Glad you are getting therapy. That will help. You need to get out of this situation, you really do. You will be much happier without her around."
relationship_advice,3d4rl6,spotH3D,3,Mon Jul 13 18:51:26 2015 UTC,"Actually, as a lawyer, I can tell you that calling the state bar for a recommendation is virtually the same as looking in the yellow pages.  The bar will just give a list of lawyers in good standing (paid their dues, up on CLE, and currently licensed to practice law).  The bar is certainly a good starting point, but it's not a guarantee of quality.  Do some research, ask friends and family who've gone through a divorce, even go through a lawyer you've dealt with previously and ask for a referral.  But don't just take whatever names the bar gives you.  ETA: Also, if you're even slightly considering a divorce, it's still a good idea to see the lawyer now and find out what your options are.  When you're in a situation like this, you will get a lot of well-intentioned advice and some of it will not only be wrong, but also illegal, and it could land you in hot water or complicate the proceedings.  Talking to a lawyer will give you a clear path to follow if you choose divorce and it will let you know where you stand even if you don't choose divorce."

Once you're moved away from her, this big black cloud will slowly move away from your life, and your depression will improve, I'm positive that your marriage is a huge contributor to your depression.

I would also suggest renting a storage unit and slowly moving your personal effects into the unit in the days leading up the announcement - stuff she may not notice right away, but may be at risk of being damaged/destroyed in the fallout of your announcement.    Not sure if your wife works, but take a day off the day you plan to tell her and arrange to have any larger belongings that you don't necessarily need to live on a daily basis, into storage.  For any joint assets, let her know that you will leave them in storage until separation of assets is worked out, but this way they don't get wrecked in the meantime.  If you share bank accounts, make sure you open your own accounts, preferably at a different bank than your joint accounts, and transfer half the money from the joint account into your own personal account in advance of the announcement.  Don't be the one to leave first unless you want to give her the house.  And last, but not least.  Document everything! record any discussions about the divorce, assets, etc, reduce everything agreed on to writing, and assume that she will be recording everything you say, even if you know she isn't."

Initially, the thought of not growing old with someone was very depressing to me...I'm over that part now.  Back to you, so why wouldn't you want a divorce from someone who makes you uncomfortable in your own home. You are relatively young, you seem reasonable (well, we only have your side but) and you are absolutely right there is no way in heck sex ever 3rd month is ridiculous.   I don't know where you are from but divorce is much more amicable these days and judges don't  give out windfalls all willy nilly.

Try to separate the expression of ""I Love You"" from the intent of the phrase, and that being tired of the expression doesn't mean you disagree with the intent. One example:  ""I appreciate the attention, but for me, if I say it all the time it starts to feel like a habit, like a Bless You after a sneeze, instead of an expression of love. When that happens, I have to stop saying it for a while. You really don't need to keep saying it all the time, and if I don't respond, it doesn't mean I don't love you.

relationship_advice,3d5uv7,anakmoon,0,Tue Jul 14 20:53:49 2015 UTC,"Oh, sure, I didn't mean it is intentional or a conscious thing. More like he feels a certain way (insecure about the relationship), and this is the manifested behavior. And, like you said, it's just my best guess based on the small amount of info."
relationship_advice,3d5uv7,Ferinex,0,Tue Jul 14 22:30:38 2015 UTC,"I think you should bring this up sometime and have a conversation about it. Tell him you do love him but you feel the phrase is special and saying it all the time makes you feel that it is less special. At the same time recognize that he needs words to make him feel special. Make a conscious effort to say I love you more and other phrases that express your love. I miss you, I can't wait to see you, You're mine etc... Maybe start using Love as a pet name like Honey or Bae. Hey Love, what do you want for dinner. Hi my love. Have a good day Love."

I eventually told him the more you say it, the less I want too. Not because I didn't mean it, but because the meaning of it was slowly dying out.   I would talk to him and tell him how you feel about it."

relationship_advice,3d77er,throwawaymigrane,3,Tue Jul 14 01:37:52 2015 UTC,"It sounds like this unresolved issue is beginning to cause further issues. The only way to stop this from continuing is to resolve that. How you go about that is up to you and your family dynamic, but I assume it would involve having a very blunt conversation with him the step father and your mother. I think your therapist would be more helpful in building a solution to this.   As for the wedding, I understand that it feels like she is taking sides, and she may be. However, this problem isn't resolved and she doesn't want to be in the middle of it until you and her father have made your decisions on how to handle it. Really, that is a mature view on her part because she wasn't there and doesn't know the truth. I wouldn't punish her for wanting to distance herself from the situation at this stage. I think that is a normal reaction. It also doesn't mean you are obligated to be in her wedding. My only suggestion is to look into the longevity and effect of this decision you are making."

relationship_advice,3d79tr,GotnoVoodoo,2,Tue Jul 14 01:58:07 2015 UTC,"I think you have went above and beyond to help him, but if he is slowly killing himself, then your presence is only enabling his decisions. He knows that he can continue to make bad choices and still have you by his side to try to help him whenever he is ready.   My suggestion would be to have one final and definitive talk with him about changing his habits/addictions. Let him know that he either starts this second, or you leave. If that isn't enough to get him going, then you know with certainty that you are a lower priority for him and should move on."

You appear to be really kind and helpful in doing these things, but the problem is that these are not good things. Well, they're good, but they're misguided. You're becoming responsible for his issue with alcohol. He has to change for him. Not for you. Until HE makes that decision, no progress can be made. You could stand on your head for 12 years straight and if he doesn't want it, it won't happen. Leave, and let him know why. I'm leaving because you won't stop drinking. I won't be with someone who drinks as much as you do. He will have to learn to accept responsibility for his actions.

His brother is 13, you are an adult. There is nothing to be embarrassed about. Sex is not, or should not be, embarrassing for an adult. If his little brother asks, then you or your boyfriend sit him down and tell him that those are private things between you two that he should not have seen. Now that he has, he needs to keep them private.  Also, you are an adult. His parents cannot force you two to get married."

relationship_advice,3d7qod,Fly4221,2,Tue Jul 14 04:15:14 2015 UTC,"Personally, I wouldn't sit in relationship limbo for more than a month. If she doesn't know, after 3-4 months, that she wants to be with you, then she doesn't want to be with you. At least not enough for you to stick around and invest a lot of time, energy, and money into making this work.   I would make it clear to her that you are tired of waiting around and need an answer and a commitment. If she can't give you that, I would focus on moving on and distancing yourself from her until you are over her."

relationship_advice,3d7qk8,jrob62290,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:14:12 2015 UTC,"A few notes from what you've written.   First is that your relationship is over. It sounds like you are clear on that, so no need for me to get into it.  Second, it sounds like she is still in the confused state that is often associated with breaking up. That's why no contact is often recommended. It sounds like neither of you are making a strong enough effort to cut contact. My biggest guess is that you are not putting serious efforts into cutting contact because you are holding on to hope. She, on the other hand, is likely not putting in the efforts of cutting contact because she wants to keep you as a fallback plan if she is unable to find someone else. Either way, your relationship has ran its course.  I think at this time you need to clarify that line between you both. The relationship is over and you both need to accept it. Cut contact and if she makes contact, remind her that you are no longer a couple and that she needs to move on. Then block her. As hard as it may be, it is the only way you both will get out of this confusing cycle."

He does say that he has no feelings for her its just the lack of respect from his friends"
relationship_advice,3d7dxf,StopStalkingMeB,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:23:23 2015 UTC,"The moment I stopped caring who my ex slept with was the same moment I was over her. Even bro code okays sleeping with a friends ex after 4-5 years. Even within the first year there are exceptions to the rules.  I'm not saying he hasn't moved on, but there is something strange about him being this upset after being broken up for 4-5 years. My guess is because he is just realizing that he isn't the only guy she wants. Maybe that ruined plans for him that evening, or at least hurt his fragile ego.   Maybe he is using an outdated copy of brocode, but a long standing set of rules that apply are:  Bro code only works if the relationship was longer than 1 year.   It is acceptable to date and/or have sex with a bro's ex if:   The original couple were together less time than they have been broken up. Or; The original couple has been broken up more than 1 year. Or; The original couple have been broken up for more than 6 months, but less than a year. However, the bro who originally dated her is allowed to remind his friend of the time she did that thing to her thing.    My point is, your boyfriend getting upset at his friends after dating you for three years and having been broken up with his ex for 4-5 years is extremely suspicious. No matter if that suspicion turns out to be his unresolved feelings for the ex, or his envy of his friends success, it is his issue. His friends, nor his ex, have done anything wrong. Instead of supporting his unhealthy stance on the subject, you should be asking him why he cares so much. Point out how you don't care who your ex's sleep with as an example - assuming you don't."

I forgot to note of that, but this was just where the line was drawn. We can't even hang out with his friends because they are seriously BFF with every EX-Gf that he has had, and they hang out quite frequently. He has even said that he can't control who his exes want to hang out with but he finds it odd that all of his friends just love talking to them. I seriously wish that we could all just be one big happy familia of friends but it's just stupid that it cant be considering that their all one big friend-f*n orgy group. It's so sick."

From the limited information you gave us, this is a somewhat likely.   Furthermore, it's a good guess that he hasn't outright broken up with you because you are plan B.

All I did was ask him about it and explain my feelings and listen to his reasons (which made no sense)   This is called deflecting. He is putting the focus on you so that he can justify his poor decisions and keep focus off of them.   Honestly, I think the other user is right. He wants to keep you away and it seems very unlikely it is because it is a guys trip. I would consider this extremely suspicious, and his response to asking him about it even more so.   If the next time you talk to him about this he isn't any more clear or fair in how he responds, I would consider his sneakiness a deal breaker."

It's a hedonistic free for all. If he doesn't want to take his girlfriend with him to something that wild/awesome then you aren't his girlfriend.   Also, he is being evasive, blaming you for starting a fight when all you want is reassurance and clarification of boundaries. If he can't even be bothered to take you to festival or at least clarify boundaries of what will take place at the event, you aren't in a real adult relationship.   I would pick up some tickets and go with a friend. If nothing more than to go see what a festival is all about and have the time of your life.

relationship_advice,3d6gh0,LoveHelp01,11,Mon Jul 13 22:07:19 2015 UTC,"I feel like someone needs to tell you that getting a date and building a relationship are different things. From what you described, you're a homebody, with not a lot of interests, an unwillingness to spend money to do things, and no social circle. A girl wants a SO who adds value to their life. There's plenty of ""nice guys"" out there. Building a life of abundance and substance will create more dating opportunity than you know what to do with."
relationship_advice,3d6gh0,tramplemestilsken,2,Tue Jul 14 01:39:18 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is the fundamental disconnect in this thinking. People don't come on here asking ""how can I bring value to someone else's life in such a way that they want to continue spending time with me?' - which is the real question you need to think about. It's 'how do I get a girlfriend - I'm lonely and I want one.' In this second scenario, the girlfriend is a toy to be acquired which reduces loneliness.  It's kind of a bummer because it's hard to explain this as advice - you have to realign your whole thinking pattern on relationships and remove a lot of the selfishness from the equation.  OP - stop thinking about what a girlfriend is going to do for you when you find one. Concentrate on being an interesting person whose company is desired by other people."

relationship_advice,3d6gh0,perortico,3,Mon Jul 13 22:13:16 2015 UTC,"Go out places! Meet people, develop a group of friends, join a club or develop a hobby. Most importantly, don't go LOOKING for a girlfriend. I hate it when I meet a guy and can tell immediately the only reason he's talking to me is to see if he can date me. Confidence is VERY attractive. The best way to get a girlfriend, is to stop looking for a girlfriend, and just meet people, and enjoy yourself. Eventually you'll meet someone you have a lot in common with, and enjoy spending time with, and that you're attracted to. Don't fight it, just get out there and let it happen. :) Good luck!"

relationship_advice,3d5q4v,hatethewhy,8,Mon Jul 13 22:56:33 2015 UTC,"I tried finding the article where I first learned of the concept (which actually helped me work through a lot to get over my ex), but it's lost forever in the vast depths of the internet.  Basically, the article explained how the mental obsession is your brain's response to a perceived threat or danger. The more of a threat something is, the more it sits in the forefront of your thoughts because your brain is extra alert and sensitive to the perceived danger. In this case, you were hurt (presumably) by the end of the relationship, and the repeat failures didn't help. Now, your brain has rewired itself to associate your ex with danger (threat of emotional pain).  In my case, she broke up with me both times, with about a two year gap in between. After I moved and started dating again, I realized I didn't actually love her anymore like I thought I had for so many years. I had just been so mentally fixated on her that I'm still trying to undo the damage that was done another two years since we split. I'm now with someone new whom I love immensely (more than I ever loved in my life), but my ex still comes to mind every so often. It's annoying, but they're like echoes. The repeats get weaker as time goes on."

As a previously shy girl, now married to my HS sweetheart, it was the mystery that got me.  He to is shy and quiet, more so than I.  But he would say/do things that I found unusual and would make me think about him and trying to figure it out.  which of course resulted in me thinking about him more and more, try to get the puzzle together.  Then one day I just realized I liked him.  We had a lot in common but were also very different.  Like yin/yang.   I guess a good way for you two to really start, is to find common interests.  Inquire about such thing and yet leave a bit of mystery to yourself. basically make her talk about herself a lot while you reply with short, moderately puzzling answers to the questions thrown at you.    edited for words"

You are obviously recognizing it's an ""unnecessary risk to yourself"" whatever that means, and yet you keep doing it. Instead of asking how to fix things with your gf, why not ask how you can become a better person for your gf? She moved across the country to be with you and you have cheated on her and continue to abuse substances she's clearly stated her opinions toward. DO you value your relationship and her wishes (even if it means a compromise) more than you do using these substances or being selfish and doing what YOU want to do?"

relationship_advice,3d5q1b,imsogroovy,9,Mon Jul 13 22:10:58 2015 UTC,"Legally she can't keep his kids from him. I assume he pays child support, which is another reason why she has no right to tell him he can't see them. I would let him know that the law states she can't do that. What he does with that knowledge is up to him but if he just doesn't care, maybe it's for the best he doesn't see them. Is that someone you want to spend your life with?"
relationship_advice,3d5q1b,icecreamknuckles,6,Mon Jul 13 21:24:17 2015 UTC,"She has full custody so you don't know the situation enough to say he pays child support or has any rights to the kids. Being a veteran diagnosed with PTSD he may only be allowed supervised visits for all we know. Visits may be at the discretion of the mother. Not enough details here. I would not let my 4 kids be alone with a parent wih ptsd and suicidal thoughts. That is not safe. 3 times in my 21 year career as a paramedic I responded to calls where men in very similar situations killed their kids and themselves on an unsupervised visitation. I am not trying to be mean but there are sometimes reasons why people have full custody of their kids over the other parent. This guy doesn't sound very stable right now and my concern would be getting him some help. Too often we throw veterans, who have seen some bad shit in combat, under the bus and it ends up bad."
relationship_advice,3d5q1b,LeftShark69,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:15:11 2015 UTC,"True, I do not know the whole story but given that the ex-wife denies him the right to see his kids simply because he said he didn't want to get back together with her and that her comment was that he would never see his kids while he was with his gf CLEARLY points she is keeping him from them for that reason alone. Sorry, but coming from parents who did that to me I think I know a thing or two about what's legal and what's not legal in that aspect. Nowhere in this does it state he has PTSD or that he flipped out or did anything besides tell her he's not getting back with her. My mom pulled the same BS and my dad took her to court and let me tell you, the judge was NOT happy and threatened to throw my mom in jail again if she tried to keep me from my dad."
relationship_advice,3d5q1b,icecreamknuckles,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:47:27 2015 UTC,"You need to stop typing and reread it then because it says he has a history of ptsd and suicidal ideations very clearly. I don't care what happened to you and it has zilch to do with the legal system. Being affected by it as a child does not make you an expert on family law. The ONLY thing that matters is what the judges orders say. So without more information you have no idea if she is denying him visitation he has a legal right to, or if she has no obligation to let him see them but was doing it for whatever motive she had and decided to stop. I agree it's certainly not right, but without details you can't say with any kind of certainty that you are right ""because it happened to you"". That's just ridiculous. It clearly said he is a veteran with ptsd and has been talking about killing himself. I don't know a judge that would not issue an emergency order stopping unsupervised visitation if that is the case."
relationship_advice,3d5q1b,LeftShark69,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:27:29 2015 UTC,"Oh ya right at the bottom. If this was about his PTSD than the ex-wife would have stated that as being an issue and OP would be seeking advice on how her bf can see his kids when he struggles with PTSD and suicidal thoughts. Instead the issue OP is having is that her bf's ex-wife wanted to get back together, he said no, ex-wife said he can't see his kids again until he leaves his gf. NO WHERE does this state he isn't safe around his kids. I suffer from anxiety and depression, but it doesn't mean I can't or shouldn't have kids or be around kids. There are certain levels of PTSD, and not all result in that person walking around shooting up military bases."
relationship_advice,3d5q1b,icecreamknuckles,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:40:57 2015 UTC,"Sorry, don't agree with you. I am not leaving children alone with a person that directly made a suicidal threat to his girlfriend. It's right there in the post. That's not safe and 10/10 times CPS would remove the children from that situation. I used to thnk that was so shitty, until I ran a call that sounded exactly like this guy. He shot all 5 of his kids in the head, including a baby, and then killed himself. One kid survived, and dragged herself, shot in the head, to the neighbors for help. Sure, not everyone will do something like that. But you tell me, how do we know which one will and which one won't? She even said this is not the first time he has threatened suicide. You can rely on emotions and conjecture, I'm going with what is safest for everyone. Frankly I can't believe a 22 year old woman would even deal with this mess, but she is and she asked opinions."
relationship_advice,3d5q1b,LeftShark69,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:02:28 2015 UTC,"Oh don't get me wrong I can agree with most you say. I'm not focusing on the kids living with him or staying with him (clearly thats not even the case). PTSD or not she can't legally tell him he can't see his kids unless he has physically or mentally hurt them, which as far as this post goes he has not done that to his own children. With him having PTSD he may or may not be supervised but she has no right to tell him he can't see his kids, that's up to the judge to determine. It may suck to think that he or anyone could harm their own children, but she's doing harm to them herself by denying him to right to see them. I wouldn't be surprised if she talks bad about him to them.  Just because someone has seen or heard bad things about those with PTSD doesn't mean they should be treated like them and denied the right to live a normal life and see their kids. Sadly unless he actually hurt them or killed them, the law is the law and she can't tell him he can't see his kids. Only after something were to happen will the courts decide. She is way too young to deal with all of this. Shitty situation =/ The law is messed up and I'm sure there is way more to this story about him then OP may lead on to, even more so about the mother."
relationship_advice,3d5q1b,icecreamknuckles,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:22:50 2015 UTC,"Like I said, you and I don't know if he does or does not have visitation rights until the OP tells us. If he does, then he needs to stand up for himself and take her back to court if she withholds them. And no you don't have to have hurt them to lose visitation, that is just completely false. Go ask an attorney. I do agree, there is way more to this. And again, I am NOT saying all people with PTSD are dangerous, but in the post she makes it clear he has made suicidal threats in the past, and did so again after the ex pulled this. That is far more than enough reason for a judge to suspend visitation if the ex wanted to pursue it. It's a judgment call."
relationship_advice,3d5q1b,LeftShark69,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:54:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed, if he has visitation rights he should stand up for himself.  The ex wouldn't get very far in court except get the judge to rule that he only be allowed to see his kids supervised until he can get the proper help for his condition. No judge wants to or is willing to just take someone's kids away from them. It takes a hell of a lot. My cousins mom is a drug addict and left her in a corn field at 4 years old at 2am and her own father couldn't even get custody of her until 4 years ago and she's 17 now. That wasn't the first time she was in that situation either. Courts don't like to break families apart and don't particularly think it's right for a child to be without a mother figure or father figure. It's just the way the system works."

From the sound of it he doesn't mean it, but the court has to take it seriously. I guess lucky for him it  seems the ex isn't interested in burning him like that since she wants him back. And please don't get me wrong, I am not hating on him. I think we do a piss poor job taking care of our veteran's mental health. But I have also been on those nasty calls and had more than one vet with ptsd point a gun at me while threatening suicide so I am wary of those situations. But that is just from my experience. Those calls were terrible and I will never forget them."

As I stated before, only cases of abuse and drug use (which require proof) are you allowed to keep a child from the mother or father.   http://www.womansdivorce.com/supervised-visitation.html and this states supervised visitation in cases of one parent threatening suicide, it does not state that they will not be allowed to see their kids."
relationship_advice,3d5q1b,icecreamknuckles,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:02:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah I specifically mentioned supervised visits in one of these comments and the rest I referred to as unsupervised for that same reason. My sister is a family law attorney. The one thing I have been meaning to ask her is if you don't pay your child support, can they be kept away. I would think not because that is basically ransom, but they will throw you in jail in my state for not paying pretty quick."
relationship_advice,3d5q1b,LeftShark69,3,Tue Jul 14 18:21:20 2015 UTC,"This is in no way your fault. It sounds like he's not completely over this relationship and there are aspects of their relationship that he hasn't told you about. He had FOUR kids with her. FOUR. This is a man that was invested so it sounds like this is just a temporary spat and he will eventually go back to her. I would break it off just because it isn't fair to you that you are caught in the middle. He needs to resolve this before he gets into another relationship. He needs to get a court order so she can't threaten him. I would break it off and see what he does with that. Will he go back to his ex? If yes, then there you go. It was never really over to begin with. If not, then he can get his shit together and then you guys can make it work once this is no longer an obstacle. I'm sorry. Being in a relationship with someone that has kids with a bitter ex is really tough. My SO has a kid from his ex and it's awful. She's really crazy. They have an ironclad court order where he has 80% custody. She's not allowed to text him or call. She has to contact him through an email address that I have access to. We also go to therapy to deal with all of this. If those three things weren't in order, we would have no chance and I would never have agreed to continue a relationship. He was willing to do anything and everything he could to get her out of his life and be with me. Your guy needs to do the same thing. If he can't or is unwilling, you have your answer. He's not willing to completely end things with his ex because he still sees her as a possibility, even if they are momentarily ""fighting."" I would be very careful with this one. Unless there is no possibility of going back, they will always go back to the baby momma."

His ex took all rights from him from his first son, I use to think I messed up everyone's life by having a son with him, I felt so guilty because I felt as it was my fault he was going through that situation and he wouldn't be able to see his son. Eventually he gave up too and started saying he was starting a new life. However the guilty killed me, but honestly it has nothing to do with you, clearly she isn't mature enough using his kids against him, it's quite childish. But don't let him give up, I keep encouraging my boyfriend to see his son every week and I buy toys for his son for him to give him to show him support and give him reasons to see him.

relationship_advice,3d5q1b,MTknowsit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:01:29 2015 UTC,"A lack of health treatment is the number one killer of veterans. Regardless of the rest of the situation and the relationship questions, he needs immediate help that only you and a few other people can provide. He will probably resist you. If you have the information of guys that were in his unit that he was close to, especially a CO, reach out to them. Nobody knows veterans better than other veterans. The VA is a shitstorm, so you need to get on the phone as soon as possible to your local psychiatric services center. You can find your local VA medical facilities here: http://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/gethelp.asp  You can, right now, 24/7/365, call the free Military Crisis Line, 1-(800) 273-8255 or chat online on their website with a counselor (http://www.veteranscrisisline.net/) It's for DoD/VA and their loved ones, too. They can help you in the short term. There are very simple, but specific things that you need to do and say (and not say). I'm saying this from experience: depression is extremely powerful. It will make him want to not get help. It will make him fight against therapy and especially medication, which is often the biggest help of all. If he has been raised to believe that men should be ""tough"" and act a certain way, that will also be an obstacle. But you have to look at it this way: If he had diabetes, would anybody judge him for taking his insulin? No. Medication for depression/PTSD is like insulin for your brain chemistry instead of your organ chemistry. Things are out of whack and they need to be fixed. It's not a personal failing and it's not the person's fault.  You and your roommates and his friends and family and fellow vets are your support network now, and you all have to fight for him, because he might not be able to for a while. If he is religious or spiritual, outreach to a religious authority (deacon, priest, etc.) can also benefit a person in a time of crisis. If you are unfamiliar with suicide and what warning signs look like, read all the pages under the ""About Suicide"" tab here: http://www.suicideoutreach.org/About-Suicide/warning-signs.htm  The absolute first step that you should do right after reading this is to identify if he has access to any firearms. If so, you need to get them out of the house and/or put a gun lock on them and keep the key. If you don't have a lock/safe, you can get one at a sporting goods store or gun dealer tomorrow. Remember: you need to ask him, in no uncertain terms, ""Do you have plans to kill yourself?"" If he says yes, call 911. Yes, it is extremely serious. Most places require a mandatory 72 hours of hospitalization and observation. After a person is committed, they usually can't own firearms anymore, for obvious reasons. It's very serious, but the situation is very serious. It guarantees that he will have immediate access to psychiatric care.  You have the power to help him take control of his mental health, but you can't do it by yourself, and he can't do it by himself. Even if you're never romantically involved again, you can help."

I'm sure you're not meaning to make me feel this way, but I just wanted to tell you how this is affecting me, since we care about each other and want to help each other out. I would really appreciate it if you would wait until we're in private to voice your concerns about things, and I would also appreciate the chance to handle things on my own- I know you're here to help, so I'll definitely come to you if I feel like I'm in over my head.""

Maybe she feels that she is inadequate and must make others feel this way as well to feel like she isn't alone? Just a theory.  I understand how it feels to not want to hurt your family members but at the same time they need to back off. I just tell my sister (she is 27, I am 21) when she does that shit to me to back off, or ""I'm not up to listening to your considerations"". Sometimes the best thing to do is to just walk away from the issue as well.   In all reality it might be hard to avoid confrontation in this situation, however I also don't know her or you in person.

Personally, if I was in your situation, I'd basically do what i advised, and never talk to her again, because you have to look at it as she doesn't deserve any of your time. If you do, ensure it is on YOUR terms that you meet, and discuss, and let her know that while you will be willing to hear her side, it doesn't change things and you don't want her back.

Why would you even be attracted to a person that doesn't respect you? That should be the number 1 thing you are looking for in a relationship.  Mutual respect.  If she doesn't give you that, what do you love about her?  I think you just love being in a relationship.  The sooner you realize this and are able to separate your emotional connection to your logical connection to this girl, the sooner you will be able to have healthy relationships.  Your mindset is really dangerous, it is what keeps millions of people in abusive relationships.  ""He hit me last night, but he is really sorry, and we really love each other and I know he is the love of my life"" or ""i caught her lying for third time when she was texting her ex-boyfriend.

relationship_advice,3d41ti,niroby,14,Mon Jul 13 11:24:42 2015 UTC,Would refrain from using derogatory comments about the ex... Counter libel / slander (not sure what texting is since its both...?) or defamation of character lawsuits would be expensive to defend.

This is two Junkies doing what junkies do -- live fucked up dramatic lives.  For all we know he's trying to stage an intervention. She certainly hasn't said anything else specific.  What do you think is going one here? How has your imagination filled in the blanks?  Let's go extreme as say he said -- I'm going to expose your drug use to the world unless you remain my girlfriend... do you think that's illegal? What about I'm going to expose your drug use to the world unless you go into rehab.... is that illegal? How about I'm going to leave you and expose your drug use to the world unless you stop bad mouthing me to your friends and family... is that illegal?  How about I'm going to pout and cry and make your life really miserable unless you do the dishes.... is that illegal?  The only illegal thing happening here for sure is the OP's drug use (and purchasing) and whatever the hell else she's involved in.  Blackmail is a very specific type of crime requiring a very specific circumstance adjudicated under a very specific statute ----- the cultural idea (popularized by TV dramas) that blackmail is even an everyday crime (per say) that is prosecutable is bullshit.  Telling someone you will tell their mom and dad they are a junkie unless the tow the line in a relationship is not a crime anymore than telling your kid he wont get a trip to Disneyland unless he cleans his room... There is no illegal act here. (unless the OP comes in and say otherwise).

What amazes me is that there were people here who started insisting that the OP was raped and had drugs forced on her without even understanding what the OP wrote.  She said nothing of the kind. To reiterate -0 she basically said (paraphrase) I was wacked out on drunks climbing up the walls and rolling around the bedroom and my ex video taped me and is threatening to expose my drug use and addiction to friends and family --- No rape, no nudity, no forced drug taking, no blackmail -- just a junkie who's about to be exposed (for whatever bullshit drug reason could exist between the two fo them).  Respondents in this thread are completely irresponsible to offer or proffer any advice --- the ones that did didn't even seek clarification and totally misread and got confused about the details.

It is, however, a very real condition which is often caused by spiking your blood alcohol (drinking quickly) and/or other stupid behavior like not eating before drinking.   As these were some of my specialties up until about 30, let me tell you some blackout stories that are not nightmares, to illustrate. The day I found out my dad had a heart attack, and he would either die or be fine, so everyone just said ""wait until tomorrow to by a ticket home,"" I drank everything I could drink. I don't remember how I got home but I 'woke up' having sex (we were living together, so it wasn't just some random) and apparently it was the 2nd time, and I don't remember the first at all. Ironically, it was pretty good for someone who wasn't coherent when the whole thing started.   Another time I went to a club with some girl I'd been talking to, apparently drank so much she felt bad leaving me there. I woke up on her couch, puked in her bathroom for like 30 minutes, then went home and we never talked ever again. I have no idea what went on, but I feel like I remember her cooking eggs.  One time I was day drinking with friends and ended up going home. My roommate ended up calling me 6 hours later to say he had forgotten how to use his phone until just now and had no idea where he was. It talked him through how to get home, and when he got back, he was covered in blood. He had no injuries, and had no idea who's blood was on him. The next day out other friend was missing 2 teeth and also had no idea why. This one is my favorite.   Dude, I could go on and on. The amount of times I've had to ask ""Did I do anything I should apologize for?"" Is more than I can count on two hands. But nothing bad ever happened and I'm really lucky. It could have, and then I'd be one of those nightmare stories.  Instead, my stories are generally funny. Like the time I went to the bathroom at a club, came right back, but had apparently been gone for at least an hour. Apparently I just walked up to girls and asked if they wanted to make out the rest of the evening.   Look, just because you've never experienced it doesn't mean it doesn't happen. You wouldn't tell people that racism doesn't exist because you've never heard someone get called a racial slur. Or that there's no such thing as dyslexia because you can read just fine.   Blackouts happen. They are usually just fine, but sometimes really bad stuff happens. Don't discount the bad stuff just because you haven't experienced a blackout. That's absurdly self-involved."
relationship_advice,3d41ti,TheBestWifesHusband,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:58:58 2015 UTC,"Hi there, I black out semi regularly, and a lot of the stories arent horror stories, a few are pretty bad though. blacking out is a real thing! Heres how you can experience this sometimes glorious, sometimes awful time you wont remember:  You have to drink more harder. Just try harder, for like a week. first off, having a generally belligerent attitude going into it helps a lot. Also, alcohol is pretty dense in calories so dont eat dinner before you drink. Shots are a definite yes, every time. Stuff like concerts are great for this, or strip clubs. just start doing and buying shots with people. friends, people you just meet, the bartenders, etc. Do not just do shots- have a drink in your hands at all times. drink half of it before you leave the bar. when you return to the bar, shot, drink half the drink, and continue. Repeat this on a nightly basis. On nights you arent out just get drunk with a friend or spouse. not like split a bottle of wine drunk, like drink four bottles of wine drunk. I guarantee eventually you will black out.  Just some helpful advice from someone who might be an alcoholic."

This isn't lack of experience, not by a long shot.  I think it's Bullshit still. I've been blacked out on combinations of drugs, but that was clearly an unconscious situation, which is different to this magical, awake, but conveniently not responsible for ones actions situation that young folks seem to think absolves them of any shit they do."

relationship_advice,3d5bb1,kubigjay,6,Mon Jul 13 17:38:09 2015 UTC,"I had a few people (not just exes) message me this year to apologize for being a dick. It's like everyone decided 2015 was the ""apologize to Enralis"" year LOL  Anyways, go for it if you think he has also moved on. Shouldn't be too bad of an idea. Even if I still don't like/have forgiven them, I have mad respect for how they grew the balls to speak up and apologize.   Makes me wanna go apologize to all the people I was a bitch to, actually. Good luck!"
relationship_advice,3d5bb1,Enralis,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:37:20 2015 UTC,"People will say it's more for yourself so you shouldn't do it. I'd say just go for it if you feel right. The apology is more like a once and for all thing, and you'd never know how he / she will really feel. You'd probably not have a reply.  Just be mature and concise. Rather than opening the wounds, just give an apology. He/she's gonna feel difficult at first, but the apology will mean a lot over the years to come."
relationship_advice,3d5bb1,rokie7,11,Tue Jul 14 03:14:56 2015 UTC,"I had a moment where I tried this. All I did was reopen her old wounds and get raked over the coals.  That taught me that sometimes the most caring thing you can do is to avoid reminding someone of a pain you inflicted on them in the past. We can't go back and fix our mistakes, but we can deliberately aovid reminding the people we hurt about them.  If you two happen to fall back into a similar social circle, sure that may be a good way to make it easier to be around each other again; but if you aren't in his life, I'd stay that way."
relationship_advice,3d5bb1,GotnoVoodoo,6,Mon Jul 13 17:53:51 2015 UTC,"In situations like this, I think that the reason you want to apologize is more for yourself (because you feel guilty) than it is for him. I'm of the opinion that you only really owe someone an apology if they're still in your life or you might see them around. Rather than an out of the blue apology from people who've hurt me, I'd rather them learn and grow from it and treat future people better while letting me keep living my life without being reminded of the things they put me through. Maybe I like the idea of them feeling guilty. Maybe I enjoy resenting them because it keeps me from missing them. The very last thing I want is someone I had romantic feelings for that hurt me that I've finally gotten over to come back and show me that while they used to be a shitty person that didn't want to be with me, now they're a mature and reasonable person that still doesn't want to date me.   If you run into him, apologize. If you never see him again, leave him alone."

My ex of 4 years cheated on me (really bad situation HE put himself into, the girl he was having the affair with was a psycho). Anyways. That was 2011. He literally just hit me back up on the 8 of July . It said ""hey ""name"" how have you been?"" I didn't reply. He sent me another one asking how I was. Idk why he hit me up but honestly just reading that made me mad at him again for what he did to me. I never responded back.  I don't think you should even contact him. Let him be."

She apologized a bunch and s written with a lot of empathy and kindness. I didn't know how to react so I just got super drunk.

I apologized and it was incredibly life-giving and helpful, but only because we were both in a space where we could admit our wrongs and forgive the other for theirs. If either of us were not able to do this, it would have been awful. So, if you think he would be receptive to this, I'd say go for it.    The key is to not cause any undue harm on him; make sure doing this won't cause damage. It's difficult to discern, but can produce great results if done correctly and maturely."

Do you want to be friends with him?  or do you want to date him?  If you want to date him, tell him that.  If you don't want to date him, you don't really have to say anything.   a lot of people get into these unnamed relationships and they can be confusing.  do not be afraid to be direct.  he is a 32 year old man, not a deer in the road.  try using the words ""date"" and ""friendship""."

Very negative all the time, which is very unlike myself.  In my case, my negativity came from built-up resentment and insecurities.  I wasn't in love anymore and I hadn't been in a long time.  If you're numb, that's a huge red flag.  It's not healthy to feel this way about your partner, especially for a long period of time.  It seems to me that what it comes down to is not simply that she's negative all the time, but that you don't feel for her anymore.  That's where the problem lies, and you both deserve to be away from that."
relationship_advice,3d5kh0,clownbabyyy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:02:42 2015 UTC,"If you haven't talked with her about how you feel when she gets into these negativistic moods, then you should probably do that first. Same for the no sex -- you both have to be proactive in this department. I also recommend learning how to talk to emotional people in a supportive and validating way as it sounds like you are tuning it all out, which will make things worse down the road (changing the words you use and how you use them can change what could have been a major meltdown into something very minor).  I've also been in a similar situation where I didn't bring things up or break things off fast enough and it was a mistake. Also, you don't need to worry about destroying her emotionally or some how hurting her future in city office -- that is not your responsibility. She is her own person, and if she isn't emotionally mature enough to handle a break up, that is as good a reason as any to break up with her."

relationship_advice,3d5kh0,PartGuyPartShark,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:22:05 2015 UTC,Talked to a therapist for a few hours about it. She asked a lot of good probing questions that I had never considered. There is definitely issues on both sides of the fence for this.  We talked about a lot of different things and she thinks there are some underlying conditions that need to be addressed that may take years to fully resolve if they can be.  Lack of any female friends was one issue that came up. Things she has told me about growing up were others. ...Don't want to delve into the rest of the conversation.  In the end the conversation ended up being I am happy being a b student and she requires everyone to be an a student for her to be happy and being happy is what a relationship should be about.  A couple other questions ran along the lines of separating out feelings for her to just feelings for having someone that came home everyday.
relationship_advice,3d4up1,chargingkoala,59,Mon Jul 13 15:17:17 2015 UTC,"Put on your helmet, son, this might sting a bit: You need to realize that you just got dumped.  She thinks she can do better, and she is going to go try her luck.   You are an option to her, and she is no longer exercising her option in regards to dating you.  Now, yes, she might go out there, have sex with other men, and then realize, ""Holy crap, did I make a huge mistake!  Chargingkoala was a perfect guy, and I dropped him for a chance to date and have sex with morons.  I need to call up Chargingkoala, fast, before he finds someone who appreciates him for the awesome guy that he is!""  That is the point where you do not take her back, because, Chargingkoala, it will never, ever, ever be the same again between you and her: she has revealed to you a level of indifference and ambivalence about you that you will never, ever forget.  So I strongly urge you to drop this, ""How do I get her baaaaaaaaack?"" mindset, and instead recognize that what the two of you had is forever gone, and may not have really existed, except in your heart.  She is forever from now on the gal who tossed you aside to see what else is out there, and broke your heart in the process.  You are still dealing with the heartache, and want to deny what happened, but in time you will see it more clearly."

There is a chance she'll realize you were the most amazing thing ever and come back to you, but in reality it's unlikely. She has decided she can and wants to live without you. It sucks, but just remember you don't want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with you, so she's doing you a favor."

It was kind of hard to read this seriously every time I read Chargingkoala hehe.. But I went through the same thing, OP.. and Stayinghereforreal is on point with everything. My ex for example wanted to see what else was out there and meet people but its been about a year since we were together and he's upset that it hasn't worked out the way he wanted to after our break up. I was his first real relationship and wanted to see what else is out there to know the difference. .  The grass, he thought, was greener on the other side. Now he's telling me he know understands the ""you don't know what you had until its gone"". You'll meet people who want to date you and make you feel like a catch. Point of the matter is, I made the mistake of making myself an option and tried an open relationship after that fact. I began and still see my ex in a different way and haven't been able to feel these deep feelings the way I used to. So my advice, having been there and done that.. (24f here btw), you're young.. go out there. Spend time with friends, make new friends, meet people, focus on yourself, do things you've wanted to do. Those good vibes will attract a great someone. You deserve that. Be fair to yourself. Down the road if you two decide to try again, by all means if you both are willing! but as of right now.. do you."

I was her first real boyfriend. She loves or at least loved me at one point, and she'll forever have our awesome relationship as a sort of comparison for everything new in her life.   Look I know I'm being dumb by saying I want to wait, but fuck I want to wait. I'll go do my thing- I have to finish school and I'll talk to girls but they aren't my main goal- and she can do her thing.

I'll tell you this much- it became a game where I was there, waiting, available, and I thought I was in love. He slept with other girls, I pretended I didn't know he'd cheated on me before, and I spent months wondering why he couldn't fucking see how dedicated and loving I was. I really thought that one day it would click for him, and that he would appreciate all that he'd put me through. I lived for the moments I thought he might love me and recognise everything I was for him.   It won't happen. Even if you get back together or have moments together, it will always be because you were available and waited around until she didn't feel like there were better options out there. You deserve to have your own better option, someone who wants you, and doesn't need you to wait around being faithful to them while they have sex with other people to figure it out."

She knows exactly who she wants to fuck and is ready to jump into bed with him and did the right thing by breaking up with you first. (Or maybe already rode him and feels guilty about cheating and is breaking up because that is the right thing)

Only in the movies is it romantic when one side has to convince the other to be in love. In reality, a lasting relationship means that both sides need to want to be with each other and feel they are lucky to have each other.  I know you feel this girl is perfect for you, but just remember, you want to be the perfect man for that girl too."

She's dumped you, and she's been all wishy-washy about it to keep you on a string so that if she can't find a better replacement, you'll be a backup.  It's a callous, mean and vicious thing to do to someone who you're supposed to care about, but unfortunately a lot of women, a lot of people in general, are selfish cunts only looking out for themselves.  She's the kind of woman who dates someone whilst it's convenient, and unfortunately this behaviour suggests she never saw you guys as a permanent thing. That really sucks, it's awful to realize that someone we love isn't the person we thought they were, and that in actuality they've been lying to your face and don't really give a shit, but that's life.  The best thing for you to do now is improve your own life. Diet, get to the gym, and get dating new women. Don't contact her, and if she contacts you, make it very obvious your life is so much better without her in it."

relationship_advice,3d4up1,KillerSquid,13,Mon Jul 13 19:00:20 2015 UTC,"Everyone is saying to move on, but I can't just do that. I'm convinced that she is the love of my life and I'll never meet anyone that I can care about as much as her.  I know how this feels. She'll always kind of be that to you, but you will find someone who is willing to not treat your affection half-heartedly.  I recently went through the most painful break-up of my life, in which the woman I loved basically just disappeared into thin air and refused to acknowledge any attempt I made to contact her. Not a clue as to why. All the years we spent loving each other and finally finding our way into a relationship, and I didn't even get a goodbye. That was the worst part, and it remains as the cruellest thing anyone has ever done to me, and only now have I realised that this woman is really not worth the time and effort I put into trying to work out why she suddenly, after a declaration of love only a few days before, vanished.  It'll hurt for a long time, my friend, but eventually (and trust me, if I was you, I wouldn't want to believe me right now) you will realise that she is really not worth it. You will survive, and you will be stronger without her. Essentially, she has given you a choice: wait around for her to come back and use you all over again, or branch off and forget about her (eventually).  I'm so sorry that you went through all this, and I really do hope things get better for you."

relationship_advice,3d4up1,PleaseDontStalkMe,6,Mon Jul 13 15:55:08 2015 UTC,"If it was so great (for her) she wouldn't be wanting a break.  If she wanted to ""try and fix what has been so great"" she wouldn't be wanting a break.  People are telling you to move on because LOTS of people have been in your exact situation.  It hurts.  A lot.  But the only thing that helped them move on and develop as people is to learn from this experience and move on to the next.  When you meet the next girl you'll wonder why you even entertained the notion of waiting around for her.  Don't wait around for this girl, not worth it."

I just think trying to fix it will make you hurt more in the long run. If she decides to come back, it's up to you whether you want to try again.  Sorry I can't offer anything stronger than that, but I just think if you try to win her back, you'll end up getting more hurt. It's not a fun feeling, and I wouldn't wish it on anyone."
relationship_advice,3d4up1,moltenrock,2,Mon Jul 13 19:41:27 2015 UTC,"Because from your perspective it seems fixed. You'll think everything is just like it was, and everything is back to normal. but from her perspective she's settling with her last good option, always wondering if getting back with you was the best she could do. Women who wonder this only wonder because they know that you'll hang on to any thread of hope to be with them. Which gives them the option to step all over you, while ""exploring"" potential options. So they manipulate the situation making the odds in their favor. This leaves an opportunity to go ""experience"" something else and never worry that they will ever be alone. Meanwhile you, with your big heart, and misguided hope will hold on. You'll stay until the end to prove you really love her, but what you end up getting in the end is loneliness, heartbreak, and misery. And for what? Unfortunately we are in the same river, but my boat is a little further along. From up here I can tell you she still hasn't made up her mind, she still doesn't talk to me in less it's convenient for her, she is still exploring her options, and she still keeps me hanging on to hope. Me and you are a couple of idiots. Cheers to our misguided, unfruitful decisions."

Yes I want to get back with her. Yes that is my goal and we'll be pretty much the only thing I can think about in regards to this situation. But that doesn't mean waiting is all I'll be doing. I've got goals of my own to accomplish. I've got to finish school. I want to work on myself to be better. I need to fix some things about myself before she and I can ever be together again anyway, so it's fine. We will both go our separate ways and learn new things. Hopefully when we get a chance we can try again"

Unfortunately, man, you're now the one holding the bag while your now-ex (that's what she is) makes a clean getaway. You got dumped. That sucks, and I feel for you, but it seems like you're now in denial as to how it's going to play out.   Your ex isn't going to be pining over you... she ended it. This sucks, and I'm sorry for being blunt, but you'll never be able to obtain the same relationship you once had. She left you because she A.) thought she could do better, or B.) wanted to go bang other dudes. Either of those options leaves you heartbroken and in the dust, but she left you because she wasn't finding the relationship as perfect as you were.   It's time to stop thinking about what once was or what might be in regards to the two of you. The two of you are now a thing of the past. It's time to focus on the ""you"" of that statement, and simply work on bettering yourself. Not for her benefit, but for your own."

Relationships in your early 20's are where you learn about love and what being in relationships mean... It's also where you learn about loss.  Ever watch Ralph Macchio in Crossroads? He only learned the blues when his woman walked out on him in the rain.... She did him a favour. He learned about loss - embraced the experience with depth and was able to beat the devil as a man not a boy. Be a man.

relationship_advice,3d4up1,Requi3m,4,Mon Jul 13 17:28:08 2015 UTC,"Been there done that, happened to me. As a matter of fact you can read all about it. I talked about it I mean a few hours ago in detail http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3d3vrd/how_did_your_first_serious_relationship_break_up/ct1jvw3  My advice though is let her have space. This happens sometimes. One person in the relationship feels they don't know what other people may be like. They KNOW if they stay, it may lead to marriage. And they wonder if it could be as good or better with someone else. What will probably happen is she'll date a few people, and whatever else happens too (not going to sugar coat it, stuff happens). And because you both spent so much time together she WILL think of you. In most relationship even bad ones, as time passes we tend to forget most of the bad an remember mostly the good. When a guy acts like a jerk, she'll remember you never did etc. Never be Whiny or pushy, that just turns her off an pushes her away. I know it'll hurt, but don't ask and don't get involved in her personal life. We both know you don't want to know about any other guys. Let her date or whatever. She's going to do it whether you like it or not. Let her see that guys just talk her up an make moves. Trust me after a couple years she's not some cheap date. She just wants to know if she had it as good as she thought. Stay in touch but keep it brief. Don't constantly call. Just a text once or twice a month to say hi. Keep it short. Don't turn her off. When a guy acts like a jerk, she'll remember your last text and turn to you eventually to talk. She'll be back. And if I'm wrong, this'll give you time to move on. Which you'll have to do anyway if she never changes her mind. But my thinking is eventually she will. Just as long as you don't push her away."
relationship_advice,3d4up1,SandyJ8,2,Mon Jul 13 15:51:11 2015 UTC,This is really my hope. To let her do whatever she needs to do while remaining a relevant option in her life.

What I mean is, give her the space she wants for now. She's going to get it whether you like it or not. And if she's packing bags to move in with her folks (if I remember that's 2+ hours away) then she's going to get time away from you whether you like it or not. So let her do her thing and stay in touch. You can't be with someone for a couple years and not at least miss them a little. Stay in touch but don't call daily. She'll start to miss you being around and there for her. Most guys just want one thing and can be jerks. She'll compare anyone else with what she had with you trust me."

If she works there just go back an visit and mKe a quick ""HEY! How ya been?"" And ask for her number when you're done talking.   Two. I'm assuming though it wasn't her work because you'd of thought of that already (right?). So... Either forget it... Or message that friend you both know. Say something like ""hey, you know so-an-so right?"". ""I bumped into her the other day and really wished I had asked for her number. Wanted to text her later. But she seemed busy an I didn't know how to break the ice... Can you send her a text an ask if it'd be ok?""  Worst case scenario, she says no. And the friend who you're not really friends with anyway knows you got turned down. Big whoop. But best case scenario, there's no confusion, you're basically saying you want to get to know her, and you're going to some effort, so it may seem cute. She may say ok just out of curiosity.

She's also very accomplished (a licensed professional with 2 graduate degrees). It may be an ego thing, from what I can tell.  I'm just trying to explain why she reacts the way she does when you try and suggest that she needs to work on things.  I think it's important that your reply be non-condescending, even when she is acting childish. Like instead of 'giving her a time out' like someone else suggested (I personally think that will only make things worse), react to it in an honest way...something like this:  ""Wow, I was not saying you are a messy jerk. I'm really concerned about why what I said was interpreted that way? Please, help me understand. I want us to communicate well. How would you have wanted me to word that?""  She then might give you a better response and basically tell you how you could better approach her. If that doesn't work, have a heart to heart. My other sibling told her straight out--""Your ego is ginormous and you have problem with authority, which is why you have issues with supervisors who are critical of you.""

Big adjustment, either way, could be a huge source of stress.  How much of the housework is she responsible for, or the child care?  How often does she get real time away from the baby, on her own or with friends?    Is it possible she's just royally stressed out, or was she like this before the baby?"

relationship_advice,3d6ia0,mfwicummed,3,Mon Jul 13 22:20:20 2015 UTC,"Every person prefers a certain kind of gratification that helps them feel loved.  Some people feel loved by having things done for them, or show love by doing things for their s/o. Some people need to get or give kind words. Some people, like you, feel loved with touching, cuddling, and show love by cuddling (and are perhaps willing to show love in a different way than you like to receive.)  I like to show love with physical (not necessarily sexual) touching, and like to receive the same. My husband prefers vocal love, and I am willing to give him that.  You should find someone who is willing to give you the type of affection you need. Wanting to cuddle doesn't make you Clingy, it means she doesn't like the kind of affection you have to offer and doesn't want to give you what you need.  It would be best if you moved on."

Physical affection-wise you are not compatible, and you will find other girls who are just like you. If you still want to keep her, just back off. Do not initiate any physical contact and make sure that you don't buy her any gifts or pay for her for the next couple of weeks while you decide if you want to keep her or hold on to her  I am not a relationship expert of any kind, but I do not think this will work out"

There may be a specific reason why she doesn't love you, but it may just be that she doesn't feel chemistry. She probably liked you as a friend which was why she hung out with you. It is fine to have crushes but it isn't good to obsess about one person... and yes if you are obsessing over her. Distract yourself with school, sports or other activities."

Ijust dont understand why all girls feel shy when i talk to them and they stare at me everywhere! Just why, i wanna know why!"
relationship_advice,3d6i1q,nocumcum,2,Mon Jul 13 22:18:33 2015 UTC,Because shes 18 and doesnt want to be tied down. shes probably bored and i hate to tell you this but has prob been getting attention from other guys and has been having wandering eyes. Shes not a bad person shes just young and wants to have fun and experience other things. at least she had the decency to break up with you and be clear and firm instead of playing games or worse cheating. My suggestion is to not try rushing back into a friendship it will be hard to be her friend and watch her have fun and date other guys. Take as much time as you need to not feel broken up about her before pursuing any kind of friendship. Good luck

relationship_advice,3d6wyx,simalimap,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:14:34 2015 UTC,"Well people tend to become very discouraged when the person they are trying to start a relationship with is continuing to go on dates. Regardless of the reason behind those dates, it is still something that tends to rub people the wrong way.   From my personal experience, I dated a girl who continued to date.  At least that is what she told me at the time. Turns out she was trying to make me impress her more by making me jealously compete over her. Instead it just made me realize that I deserve someone who is going to focus her attention on just me. I slowed down our relationship pretty significantly and got back into dating myself. I eventually found someone else I wanted to make a go of it with and ended what we had officially.  Regardless, there are many reasons this guy could be backing off. Ask him. If his answer doesn't provide complete and undeniable reasoning, then consider it over and focus at moving on. To do that, you need to cut contact and block in im FB so you don't continue FB stalking him."

This man doesn't make you wonder ""what if"".  If that's your mindset, any man would leave you feeling that way because you're choosing 1 out of a million possible futures and sacrificing the other 999,999 possible futures.  What if?  Who knows?  You just have to commit to one future that you think will be great and make it as awesome as you possibly can!"
relationship_advice,3d6aoc,zorilla24,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:36:43 2015 UTC,"I'll be the contrast. I had that same feeling and 18 years later had a terrible divorce. Marriage is not to be taken lightly. If you can't do it with conviction, despite the risks, don't.  You could hurt him more by going along with it and then making him a miserable divorced man vs. setting him free now after you decide. It's not love to marry out of obligation, it's a prison cell he does not see coming.  Introspect, decide if this is just a freak out or not. Then act on your decision. He may be the wrong one, or the one who got away, you have to pick and accept that decision at some point."
relationship_advice,3d7jos,devcoder,8,Tue Jul 14 03:16:01 2015 UTC,"First of all, you invited everyone who felt they were fit enough to do the hike. She thinks she is fit enough, and she knows herself far better than you do. So telling her ""no"" at this point would be a pretty dickhead move on your part. Likewise, you have no responsibility for her well being. There are others who I will certainly guarantee would have more compassion for her if things went wrong, but wouldn't just assume the worst of her from the beginning like you have.  If you want to say no nicely, tell her that you are a judgmental jerk who thinks you know her body and what she is capable of better than she does. That because of that, you've deemed her incapable of making the long and strenuous hike. As a result, you've decided to shut down the public access of hiking mount Fuji just for her. Everyone else is still allowed to go."

As the leader of the hike, I am responsible for the well being of those who are on the hike - I operate strictly under the motto of 'leave no [wo]man behind' when leading outdoor activities.   You aren't responsible actually. These are ADULTS making adult decisions on what they are doing. They are responsible for themselves.    Any individual's inability would force the end of the excursion.   Well then trust that she isn't unable to complete the hike. Next time be more decisive on who you want to invite. It's too late this time."
relationship_advice,3d7jos,Sarahhhhhhhh8,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:03:52 2015 UTC,"It is not, though. It's now his responsibility to say no as the hike leader. He has to use HIS best judgement, and is not obligated to bring someone along who seems to be mistaken about her own abilities. Leading summit pushes like this is very serious, and any guide is well within their rights to pass judgement on the fitness of others, if those people want to join in THEIR climb."
relationship_advice,3d7jos,StopStalkingMeB,0,Tue Jul 14 17:32:41 2015 UTC,"You are formalizing something that is not formalized. This was a request from one person to a large group of people. He is not the group leader, he is the organizer. The difference being is that with an organizer everyone is going on their own accord and responsible for themselves. A group leader assumes that responsibility.   Fact of the matter is he made a very vague request for people to join him, and this girl feels she meets the criteria he has set out to be amongst the group he is organizing.   At this point he can suggest she doesn't go, but he can't stop her. He has no authority over the group, or her, or the mountain. He is simply the person who decided the time and let people know. Restricting her at this point can, and most likely will, make him look like a complete prick to her and quite possibly others in that group. Especially if they understood that his reasoning for asking her not to come along was based on ignorant assumptions.   He can tell her whatever he wants at this point, but that doesn't stop her from walking along side of other people in the group. It just alienates her from himself. If that is his goal, then his plan is solid. However, if his plan is to avoid her health concerns, it is immaturely thought out."

relationship_advice,3d7jos,StopStalkingMeB,0,Wed Jul 15 02:07:17 2015 UTC,"I hiked mount fuji, and many other summits actually. Mount fuji is a moderate hike if anything. A 70 year old out of shape woman I met at the top can vouch for that.   Again, you are calling him a group leader when he is not. He is a group ORGANIZER. She is making the call for herself. All he can do is ask her if she is absolutely certain she is ready for such a task. He did, and she said yes by agreeing to go."

relationship_advice,3d7jos,Hurrem_Hurrem,2,Tue Jul 14 03:34:28 2015 UTC,"After reading your comments, your concerns seem very reasonable to me. Yes, she's an adult, but she may not understand the demands required of a 9+ hour hike/summit.  How did you make the invite? If it was via Facebook or email, I would post/send a message to the group reiterating that they need to be absolutely sure they are fit for the hike - for the health, safety, and enjoyment of themselves and the group as a whole. Outline what is involved in a 9+ hour hike/summit, and possible complications and highlighting the strenuous nature of the hike."
relationship_advice,3d7jos,antepenelope,2,Tue Jul 14 07:14:15 2015 UTC,"I also want to add that my above advice might not be effective, but it's worth a shot. Speaking as someone who struggled with anorexia as a teenager/young adult and if she is indeed eating disordered, she's probably very much excited about the possibility of pushing her body to exhaustion. If that's the case, you might have to have a very uncomfortable conversation with her or just let her come along and deal with the potential consequences."

I really don't want to have to call in a medievac... It's a Facebook event, and I do have a message on there saying that it's going to be extremely demanding. I'm just looking to avoid having to tell her outright that I'm not comfortable with her joining because of her apparent eating disorder."
relationship_advice,3d7jos,randogarbothrowaway,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:01:19 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand where some other answerers are coming from on this. I understand your concerns as I have done a lot of hikes and know how stressful it is to have to account for someone who is too weak to keep up with the group. It can endanger both the weaker individual and the group. Also, from my experience with eating disorders, both as a sufferer and as a friend of sufferers, I know that they are often linked with selfishness and denial of reality. So I disagree that it is a certainty that she knows best how much she can handle, and I think that you are justified in wanting to tell her no if you think she is not strong enough. I don't think you can approach her about the eating disorder, I agree that this is too touchy a subject. If it were me I would come up with a white lie which wouldn't hurt her feelings too much; maybe tell her you have decided to take a higher-difficulty hike so only very experienced hikers can come along, or something. It's dishonest, I know, but it's all I can come up with."

I really want to avoid the eating disorder conversation for reasons you mentioned among others"
relationship_advice,3d4kyv,kindaAngry,5,Mon Jul 13 13:57:55 2015 UTC,"I think there are two things that you can do to avoid a nuclear fallout with her while still enjoying your circle of friends.  First, when she insists on being right, you can simply say, ""It's obvious that we disagree. Let's drop it and find something we agree on."" If she won't drop it, just stay firm and friendly. ""Again, it sounds like we disagree. Let's move on.""  Second, when she speaks poorly of your friend, you can say, ""She is a friend of mine, and I would appreciate if you wouldn't speak of her like that while I'm around."" If she persists, simply reiterate it. ""I'd really appreciate if you didn't trash my friends while I'm here. You're entitled to your opinion, but she's a good friend of mine, and I'd ask you to keep your opinion to yourself.""  Stay positive, friendly, and firm. Don't cause a scene or issue any ultimatums. Simply stand your ground politely."

I would tell her again, the next time she calls to ask you a favor: ""Look [bitchface's name], it seems like you only call me for favors, and when you do, you talk shit on [friend's name]. I've told you before I don't like that. I am willing to give things another shot for the sake of all of us being able to hang out and get along, but I'm going to have to feel less used and you're gonna have to stop dogging other people for that to happen"". Point blank honesty is the best policy for those kind of people."

Get little insides into each other the fun way. I would also try and spend a least one date a week together without having sex just to chat and do fun things.

I know you didn't ask, but my advice on the situation? Walk away. It's going to be difficult, but if you don't give each other a chance to miss one another, you'll never get out of relationship limbo.

However, people looking on her end could go ""Wow, he treats her like a child. Does he even let her decide what to wear? Doesn't she have self respect?"" It's a mutual thing, and while you are upset (and have every right to be), you might have a more successful conversation if you can understand her point of view some.  As long as you 1) describe exactly what happened from your point of view (you were drinking so its important you guys recall similar things), 2) say how it made you feel, and 3) assert what changes you'd like to see, you should be good to go.

Yea, she shouldn't have spit on you but, you shouldn't have snatched her cig from her and put it out. That's a controlling and humiliating thing to do and she obviously won't be having it from you. If I were her and you pulled that shit, I would no longer feel the need to quit smoking my occasional bummed light because I'd want to have that say and power back.  Let it be known OP, you started this fight. She responded poorly but you provoked her and did a disrespectful and rude thing FIRST."

relationship_advice,3d7665,Lebrobro_James,9,Tue Jul 14 02:45:01 2015 UTC,You should break up. You don't belong together. You're a controlling jerk and she spat in your face. This relationship is toxic and should end.
relationship_advice,3d7665,pancake_ice,3,Tue Jul 14 02:37:56 2015 UTC,"Her spitting was disgusting. Your attempt to control her smoking was also pretty seriously immature. You both have a lot of growing up to do.  Personally, I think your relationship is in serious trouble because neither of you have even a slight amount of maturity. If you decide to stay together - which I disagree with - then you both owe each other an apology. You need to understand that you can't control her the way you are, and she needs to learn how to respond better to bad situations. Together, you need to learn how to not put each other in those situations."
relationship_advice,3d7665,pancake_ice,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:43:10 2015 UTC,"ya, like most people, when there is a lot of drinking then there is a lot of immaturity.  Apologies will be coming from both sides i am sure, whether we stay together or not."
relationship_advice,3d7665,JellySausage,3,Tue Jul 14 02:50:57 2015 UTC,You acted like her mom right in front of her friends... and she spit in your face. No offense but you two are not emotionally ready to continue in a relationship.
relationship_advice,3d7665,katorulestheworld,4,Tue Jul 14 05:20:10 2015 UTC,"You are both in the wrong and childish. First of all... why did you feel it was right to grab the cigarette from her hand in front of her friends? That was disrespectful and embarrassing for her. Granted she was just as bad for spitting in your face... that is incredibly disrespectful. Good for you for trying to deescalate things after that.   If this is representative of your relationship, I don't think it is a good one. If not, you two need to sit down and have a long talk. Start by apologizing for grabbing the cigarette. Tell her your reasoning and say it won't happen again. If she doesn't apologize for spitting then you need to make it clear that is not ok. Then talk about how to respect each other and use your words instead of acting like you are children."
relationship_advice,3d7665,lambda26,-3,Tue Jul 14 02:35:12 2015 UTC,"I grabbed the cigarette because she is not a smoker but does occasionally smoke when drinking and she wants to quit smoking them, so i was trying to help her by getting rid of the cigarette.   I don't think this is representative of our relationship. More of a one time isolated incident. We do need to sit down and have a long talk, but i am still mad about the whole thing and would like a day to think about everything (thats why i am here asking for redditors opinions on the situation.) She has apologized over text and voice mail for spitting, but i have not said much and now realize i should have gone about the cig situation differently.  thanks"
relationship_advice,3d7665,lordfeint32,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:40:09 2015 UTC,"Send her a text saying you would like to discuss how you both can improve the relationship by being respectful. Then make a time to get together or say you need a few days to cool off.  If you could go back in time and were walking over to your girlfriend holding a cigarette, how would you handle it differently?"

I'm the scum of the fucking Earth. I hate myself. I don't deserve her or anyone. I can feel the collective anger and disgust of every woman on the planet everywhere I look.   Y'know - this sort of thing, where you do something hurtful to your girlfriend then turn it around and make it all about your feelings? Playing up how ""awful you are"" and how you ""hate yourself"" and all that fluff so in addition to her own hurt feelings your girlfriend now feels obligate to comfort you?"
relationship_advice,3d5sfp,crystanow,-6,Mon Jul 13 20:34:34 2015 UTC,"No, I let her know how terrible I feel over what I said in an attempt to validate her feelings. Unless showing remorse is manipulative."
relationship_advice,3d5sfp,holyostrich,12,Mon Jul 13 20:52:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you validated her insecurities first. You'd think a 30 year old man would have more control about what he says. She's 23 and although she's insecure, she probably understand she's at her prime. I don't blame her for not wanting to be intimate with you because now when she gets undressed (if she does again), she'll start to wonder WHAT ELSE you'd like her to change about herself."

relationship_advice,3d5sfp,Mimsy-Porpington,5,Mon Jul 13 22:48:50 2015 UTC,"Give her some time. And while you're doing that, plan something amazing to show her you're not the biggest asshole on the planet. Something special that takes a lot of effort to plan and execute."
relationship_advice,3d5sfp,Warpfrenzy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:23:32 2015 UTC,Why did you even say that?  As the other person said give her time. In that time realize she may never forgive you. If that is the case you have to be ready to accept that.
relationship_advice,3d5sfp,ValiantAbyss,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:28:29 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I could see myself asking this. To me, it doesn't imply that he thinks she should or that she needs one, only if she's ever considered it. Like, why does that seem to be so taboo?  But my advice for the OP would be the same. She took it offensively and it's going to be hard to prove you meant nothing by it, even if you literally meant nothing by it. I would give it time and instead of just telling her ""I think your beautiful"" a million times (which I promise doesn't work) try to make her feel that way by showing how much you love her."
relationship_advice,3d5sfp,elbruce,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:57:15 2015 UTC,"I think all you can do is explain that you're a complete idiot.  Not a bad person, not ""unworthy,"" just a moron who sometimes says completely stupid things, and that's all that was.  It can happen to the best of us from time to time.  If she can't get past one pants-on-head stupid comment, then she probably shouldn't be with you (and vice versa).   she can't ever see herself wanting to have sex with me or be intimate with me in any way. She doesn't want to break up either...   I'm not sure exactly what she expects your relationship to be then.  You should probably get some clarification on that.  But without the physical part, there's probably no point in continuing for either of you."
relationship_advice,3d5sfp,randogarbothrowaway,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:42:28 2015 UTC,"Eek, kind of a toughie here. Best you can do is apologize, let her know your alligator mouth just started goin before you could stop it and that what you meant as a joke tumbled out as something worse. Not much you can do other than apologize and reassure her of your attraction to her (and hope she's able to see how you actually feel about her and take your actions over this 1 time poor joke choice). If she's a member of the IBTC tell her how much you love how they fit perfect in your hands and that you wouldn't want her to ever change them. you just let your filter down for a sec and that happens. give her the space she needs and be there to tell her how much you appreciate and care for her and that you're deeply sorry for making her feel bad about her wonderful self."

relationship_advice,3d5sfp,Mettephysics,0,Mon Jul 13 20:05:20 2015 UTC,She needs to be seeing a therapist. That level of insecurity is not something you are going to be able to tip toe around. Yes it was an insensitive question. This is a pretty extreme level if reaction though which doesn't Madge her feelings invalid. They are very valid and very real. It's concerning though that those are the feelings she jumps to. hugs for you both....  Tl;dr Therapy
relationship_advice,3d5sfp,griminald,-5,Mon Jul 13 20:35:39 2015 UTC,You made a joke.  It wasn't funny.  That should have been the end of it.  She's being ridiculously sensitive.
relationship_advice,3d5sfp,13goingon30,0,Mon Jul 13 19:43:43 2015 UTC,"Sure, it wasn't nearly as funny as you thought it was, but this shouldn't be something to dump you over, either. I think ""I can't be intimate with you"" is a bit of an overreaction since you didn't actually ask her to get a boob job.  Give this some time to breathe and see where it goes. Unless this is part of a bigger issue between the two of you, it shouldn't be game-ending."
relationship_advice,3d5sfp,HazelEyedCryBaby,0,Mon Jul 13 19:57:51 2015 UTC,"Just imagine, he is going to have to put up with this level of overreaction EVERY time he makes an accidental stupid joke or something even remotely related to her looks comes up from ANYONE.  It's not worth the hassle, this chick has got to go."
relationship_advice,3d5sfp,burnouttt,-3,Mon Jul 13 20:30:04 2015 UTC,"Awwww. I wouldn't be so hard on yourself. Especially if it was a joke. With every woman ever getting a boob job, it's such a common question. I would talk to her and clarify that you meant it as a question, not as a reference to the fact you think she needs one. It would be different if you said, ""Have you considered a boob job?"" Now THAT has implication that could be taken the wrong way. I like what the other 2 commenters said about giving her time. I don't think this is a make or break situation. Just talk with her and tell her you're sorry and that you'll be more sensitive and aware of her feelings when you say stupid shit. :)"
relationship_advice,3d5sfp,HazelEyedCryBaby,0,Mon Jul 13 19:53:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks to you and everyone else who've replied.  Believe me I have told her repeatedly that it was just a stupid joke/thing-that-was-not-at-all serious but she doesn't believe me. Probably because the way that I said it was closer to how you've phrased it, and she believes wholeheartedly that it was suffused with innuendo and subtext. That is that I really truly feel like she should get one (which I don't).  This really is not a silly ""idiot boyfriend says something stupid"" situation that she should just shrug off. She is deeply and seriously hurt by this to the point where she feels she will never be able to forget this. She's been explicit and stringent (for lack of a better word) about how she doesn't think she can be physically intimate with me anymore...I seriously doubt this is going to just be shrugged off..."
relationship_advice,3d5sfp,13goingon30,4,Mon Jul 13 20:01:55 2015 UTC,Why did you say it?? Have you thought about her having bigger breast?? Is it something you want?? Or are you happy with her body the way it is??
relationship_advice,3d5sfp,charlie6969,0,Mon Jul 13 20:13:43 2015 UTC,"I said it because I'm an idiot. We were joking around about body parts and things of that nature - it's hard to give context but it doesn't matter. It was a stupid, not funny, terrible thing to try to make into a joke.  And no I have not thought about that, it's not what I want or care about. I'm not ""happy"" with her body in the sense that I'm not entitled to think of it that way, that sounds creepy and possessive to me. I love her body as it is."

relationship_advice,3d34tc,glowpear31,78,Mon Jul 13 03:38:31 2015 UTC,That is full blown autism not aspergers.
relationship_advice,3d34tc,Requi3m,14,Mon Jul 13 11:28:48 2015 UTC,"Yup. People with aspergers can often get through life without a diagnosis and just seem incredibly ""weird"" or anti-social. I'm pretty disgusted with OPs parents for allowing their child to be in this state for so long and also with the school for not doing anything about her obvious disability."
relationship_advice,3d34tc,eeo11,7,Mon Jul 13 15:21:47 2015 UTC,"Don't blame the school. They are not allowed/able to give students a test to see if they have any  learning disabilities without the parents consent. If they have no official diagnosis then the school is also not allowed to give the student access to programs and help they may need. As a teacher, it is a frustrating position to be in."
relationship_advice,3d34tc,jigglejigglegiggle,3,Mon Jul 13 17:59:56 2015 UTC,"It sounded to me like OP had to convince her parents of it as though no one had ever brought up the idea to them before, but yes. It is incredibly frustrating when parents refuse to listen."
relationship_advice,3d34tc,eeo11,9,Mon Jul 13 18:50:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think you're right. From talking to my mom, it sounds like she downplayed a TON of stuff when Sam went in for her test, and she was diagnosed with a ""very mild case of Aspergers"", which seems plain inaccurate to me. Sam can blend in, but only if you don't see her around her peers.  Sam's very short and is easy to mistake for being around 12, not 18, and I feel like many adults don't see the problems due to this. I didn't recognize her problems for a long time because, in my head, she'd never aged past 12, and I think other adults make the same mistake. I only really recognized something was wrong when I met a friend of hers and was astonished by how she seemed lightyears ahead of Sam.  Her school had a conference on ""what's next"" for Sam, and several adults that watched her grow up came to discuss her potential. Three of the people there said she - and they - were more of the ""artistic types"" which ""just tend to be weird"". Of course, they didn't know she has been diagnosed with Aspergers and are unaware of all of her issues save for her lack of social skills.   I was pretty furious about that meeting. Sam isn't ""just weird"", she's completely incapable of living on her own or getting a job. But since my parents refused to tell the school and the adults that know her about her issues, they have no frame of reference to understand the bigger issue at hand."
relationship_advice,3d34tc,EyeHamKnotYew,12,Mon Jul 13 18:34:36 2015 UTC,"Aspbergers isn't a diagnosis anymore anyways, it's all ASD."
relationship_advice,3d34tc,FortheThorns,56,Mon Jul 13 13:45:06 2015 UTC,"Your parents need some good life insurance. That money could pay for your sister's care after they pass.  That doesn't really help in the meantime, but it'll be there later.  Is your sister signed up for all the state/federal social services that apply to her? Even if she refuses to use them, her being in the system can help her access more in depth services over time . (And as her caregivers figure out who to talk to.)  Ultimately she'll probably end up in a group home for adults with similar issues.   Does your sister have a social worker involved at the moment?"
relationship_advice,3d34tc,FortheThorns,5,Mon Jul 13 03:46:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your advice. I'll speak to them about life insurance.   As far as I know, she's not signed up for anything. In high school, they identified her as having a learning disorder, so she got extra help with that, but I don't believe the Aspergers diagnosis has gone past my immediate family and the one counselor Sam is seeing. That sounds like something she needs, though.   She has a counselor, but no social worker is involved. Apologies for my ignorance, but I associate social workers with abuse. Are they also there to help kids with issues like Sam?  I also want to ask whether you know how these services could help Sam, should our parents pass away. If I can get her into the system, will the state take care of her once this happens? And who would those costs fall on?"
relationship_advice,3d34tc,hesapmakinesi,3,Mon Jul 13 18:45:17 2015 UTC,"As to what services are available to your sister/she is eligible for really depends on your location. Some areas have much more extensive services than others.  Where I am, developmentally adults have a social worker to over see and co ordinate their care. Make sure their housing is safe, care givers are appropriate and they are not being taken advantage of.  They are like the gate keepers for a whole bunch of different services.  You should push to get your sister formally diagnosed. Many services are only available with that documentation.  Where I am, she would also be able to apply for disability payments, as she is unable to work. Its not a great deal of money. But it could help."
relationship_advice,3d34tc,hesapmakinesi,36,Mon Jul 13 19:11:46 2015 UTC,"She's living like this and only recently diagnosed? This reeks of neglect to me. Your parents need to take responsibility for their kid and ensure proper care for her.  I would research about care homes or other solutions for her, but not take action myself. Instead, use this information and push the parents to find appropriate care and education for her."
relationship_advice,3d34tc,theriverrat,2,Mon Jul 13 11:39:12 2015 UTC,"I agree that they need to take responsibility for her whole-heartedly, however I don't think it is intentional neglect. Sam is short, looks young, and doesn't wear makeup. In my mind, she's never aged past 10, maybe 12 years old. She looks like a little kid, so it's easy to mistake her mannerisms as normal.   I only realized there was an issue when I dropped her off at a friend's birthday party 3 years ago. The friend opened the door for us, said hello to me, asked questions about my work, and wished me a nice day when I left. I was...astounded. This girl was lightyears ahead of my sister, yet they were the same age. That was when I realized it was more than Sam just being a kid. It was the first time I realized that, at her age (16 at the time), she should've been a person with feelings and reactions and interests.   My parents haven't had the same experience to show them something's wrong, and when you add into that their apparent fear of her having issues, you get two people who honestly think (or have convinced themselves) she's normal. My dad thinks she's just going through that rough period growing up when kids refuse to shower or listen to anything they're told. My mom is more aware that there's an issue, but she denies it's serious.   The big issue is that, since they continue to think of Sam as a little kid, they don't expect what should be expected of her and let her act in inappropriate ways without punishment. I know they aren't trying to neglect her, but their inability/refusal to see the problem for what it is means that Sam has no one forcing her to change and take responsibility for herself. It's frustrating."
relationship_advice,3d34tc,Zhylaw,2,Tue Jul 14 21:59:11 2015 UTC,"My heart goes for both of you. I understand your parents mean well but can't deal with the situation.  I have Apserger's as well, but luckily for me I am functional enough to keep a job, even had a girlfriend in the past.   My family considers one a child until they have children of their own(yeah, I find it a bit weird). Although my parents had the best intentions for me and supported me anyway they can, they also made it harder for me to mature.  I am 31 for fuck's sake. I only felt I could grow as a person after moving 2000km away from home, living on my own having a regular therapist.  I understand living alone is not an option for Sam, my point stands that she needs proper care/counseling/education and your parents are not being helpful despite their good intentions. They need to wake up and help their daughter reach her potential as a person."
relationship_advice,3d34tc,HelloPepperKitty,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:23:34 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. Part of the problem, I think, is that my parents' concern has led them to spoiling her. She expects them to provide her with everything and anything, including housing, transportation, and money so she doesn't have to work or get a car, and it's not doing her any good because she's never had to face consequences for the things she refuses to do/learn. When my parents pass away, I think it will come as a complete shock to her, and there is no way she will survive unless she has the proper care and counseling to teach her to be independent and responsible.   I talked to my mom about putting Sam in a school that works with people with Aspergers and helps them to form basic life skills (something recommended by a woman with Aspergers I spoke to on Reddit), and I think she'd do this but it's far too expensive. Part of the issue is also that my parents, being older, don't have the energy to keep after my sister 24/7, and I'm not sure what could help that given that she shows no desire to change herself."
relationship_advice,3d34tc,HelloPepperKitty,16,Thu Jul 16 19:31:46 2015 UTC,"Well, from your description, she does not sound like typical Aspie, but I suspect there are other (more serious) issues at play.  In any case, just repeat that you won't take care of her whenever the topic comes up.  She probably needs to live in a group home, at this stage of her life, and will probably need to do that after your parents pass away."

Does she have a particular skill that she likes doing or feels comfortable with?"
relationship_advice,3d34tc,Zigzagbeer,2,Mon Jul 13 06:45:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know what to think. She was actually diagnosed to have a ""mild case"" of Aspergers, but I believe this is due to my mom passing along ""toned down"" information about Sam. Whenever I speak to her, my mom says things like, ""She's got some issues, but there's nothing wrong with her"".   From talking to other people with Aspergers on reddit, it sounds like she has, at least, a severe case of Aspergers, perhaps worse. Most people I've spoken with have said that the challenges she presents aren't necessarily off the Aspergers scale, though. One woman in particular said she was just like my sister, but her parents got her help as a kid and she was essentially ""taught"" what was and was not socially acceptable.   She is very good with music, and plays around 20 instruments. She's definitely got talent, but I don't know how far it will get her without help with the Aspergers and motivation to grow up. Whenever you talk to her about ""moving forwards"" in life, she snorts and shakes her head like it's some big joke. I honestly think that's how she sees it."
relationship_advice,3d34tc,TacoGoat,3,Mon Jul 13 18:55:16 2015 UTC,"Well coddling makes spoiled brats in kids without autism as well, so it is definitely going to be a challenge.   I dated a guy in high school (whom I'd known since like 4th grade) with Aspergers.  He was immensely (although sometimes creepily) artistic.  He could recreate anything with any medium and it was spectacular.  He however can't cook, keep many friendships or any relationships, drive (bikes are okay) or do a lot of the traditional things most of us can.  He got kicked out of three colleges.  But his parents kept telling him he has to try.. So now he's 26 and has a job at an art gallery and bikes to work and has a dog and can tell you all the nodes in any craft beer but he still lives with someone (his brother) while remaining mostly self sufficient.  I think what helped him the most was being around other people like him (group therapy) and being told over and over again that he needed to keep trying and using the skill he was good at (in your sisters case, music)"
relationship_advice,3d34tc,Lenovo21,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:40:30 2015 UTC,"That's a great story to hear. I think that's what she needs to hear. No one is telling her that she has to try. I keep saying to my parents that she needs to get a job, no matter what it might be, and has to get her learner's permit. Without these two things, she has no means to get anywhere in life – both literally and figuratively. No one has ever pushed her to do the necessary things, and they refuse to allow her inaction to punish her (i.e. Refuse to get a job? We won't supply you with funds for that thing you want. Or, Refuse to drive? We'll only drive you to work or school, nothing more). It will be a hard dose of reality the day she finds that there are consequences to the decisions she's making."
relationship_advice,3d34tc,lordfeint32,3,Tue Jul 14 22:07:55 2015 UTC,"I know what you're going through. My 22-year old brother who is deaf also has had aspergers all of his life. A child in the body of an adult. A very big one at that, who is tough to communicate with, despite knowing some sign language. He's had boundary issues his entire life. He never knows how to leave anyone alone and never showers/brushes teeth unless told to do so by my very sick mother.  He is quite a hard person to deal with and quite frankly my main motivation of moving out. I worry that my family expects me to take care of him when they pass (mom, g-ma, g-pa). It isn't happening. He's too much of a goddamn mess. I may help them find an agency to take him in when they feel the time is right, but it won't be me. I just hope they look at the facts one day and stop putting every bit of faith in just ""god"". I wish the very best for you and hope you conquer everything that comes your way."
relationship_advice,3d34tc,triforce721,5,Mon Jul 13 16:27:48 2015 UTC,"You sound so tired. It's incredibly difficult to know that someone in your family is not being taken care of. Luckily it's not all your responsibility.  It sounds like your parents are lost and possibly grieving for their youngest. No parent wants a child with a disability. Unfortunately playing ostrich isn't helping the situation. Things you can do: call an advocate. I'm sure that there is a special Olympics, or other type of group for people with disabilities in your area. Tell them the situation and see if someone will come talk with your parents. Find info online about care homes, schools etc for people with your sisters diagnosis and take it to your parents. Hopefully some of this will spur them into action.  Please believe you won't be burdened with all of her care when they pass. This is a crappy situation to stick you in but it's not the end of the world. For those that are saying you should have more compassionate etc, ignore them. You spent years with your family and I'm sure you weren't evil to her or them. You have a basic human right to live your life your way. And if that doesn't include being a caregiver for the rest of your life that's your right. (Recently had a similar conversation with my parents about their son. Luckily they just wanted reassuring that I'll take him to dinner once in awhile once they die)"
relationship_advice,3d34tc,MayDay13,2,Mon Jul 13 15:30:53 2015 UTC,How did your sister make it through school to graduation and no one in the school system noticed? It seems really bizarre because autism is so much more diagnosed and known about these days.
relationship_advice,3d34tc,hateboresme,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:12:13 2015 UTC,"I think the school system assumed she was younger than she is. Her school system places 5th through 12th grade in the same building, with many of the same teachers. Sam acts young and looks around 12, and I don't think they've been comparing her with her peers, who are all on an immensely higher level than her. Additionally, she has a learning disorder so her classes likely include lots of slower children of many age levels, which I doubt has helped."
relationship_advice,3d34tc,MayDay13,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:14:05 2015 UTC,I would most definitely go to a social services or child services and report your parents - I hope you're not dependent on them at all because holy shit that is serious neglect.

So, I have a few suggestions and it is only for that sweet girls benefit.   I hope your sister doesn't get stuck with YOU for her sake, so make sure your parents get a darn good insurance policy. Also, there are homes and people who have dedicated their life to help people like her and that would actually give her the time of day and a chance at a fulfilling life. Might also help if you tell your parents that you are going to be selfish and you don't have the time of day to deal with that sweet girl, that might help.

And you need to be less of a selfish prick. You only have one family and to flat out brush them off and refuse to help your own mentally ill sister is just wrong. Don't expect them to help her when you won't either. Maybe that's where you got the mentality.

relationship_advice,3d34tc,MayDay13,-21,Mon Jul 13 12:42:27 2015 UTC,What happened to just being kind and loving? I care for my mentally ill sister AND brother in law and cared for my sick father before he died. I didn't make the choice to have my sister or bring my brother in law into my family or for my dad to get sick but I love them and want to know they are okay and well taken care of.   She complains about the job her parents are doing (which I agree is crappy) but won't do anything herself. Then shut your mouth and stay away from them completely. You're either in or out. There is no half assing your family.

Appropriate boundaries are the only thing that keep some families together.    The OP is under no obligation to care for her sister for the rest of her life.  That doesn't mean that she wants nothing to do with her family, just that she is unequipped to deal with her sister's issues.  She wouldn't be doing anyone any favors by trying to take on care of her sister when she has no training, ability or inclination to do so."

Other people are not that kind of person.  Not everyone has the same moral values as you. Just because you would or would not do something does not mean that it should be expected of others.   I took care of my mother when she was dying. I did so out of love, not out of familial obligation. I would not do the same for my siblings.   Edit: In short, you shouldn't impose your moral values on others."

relationship_advice,3d34tc,marshmallowhug,2,Mon Jul 13 16:52:03 2015 UTC,"I wasn't planning on responding to any of these posts, but I respect your position and figured I'd share where I'm coming from. Apologies - I've never been good at brief responses.  My closest friend is very similar to you. Her family are her closest friends, and they invest lots in each other. My family is not like that. We don't do things together, talk, or see each other. I see my family a maximum of twice a year, and often go a couple years without seeing them at all.   The difference is in what you call family, I think. What you're identifying as ""family"" comes across to me as ""friends"". For my friends and boyfriend, I'd do just about anything. I'm the person people call at 4am when there's a problem.  But that's irrelevant. It's a shitty situation for my sister, and it would be far better to have people in her life that cared for her, but I'm not going to pretend to be one of those people just to make myself look good. I cared about her enough to insist she had a problem until my mom finally got her tested, and I care enough to help her find a home. But it ends there. In my defense, it's very hard to care for someone you never see and who has no apparent personality and no interest in you, but that doesn't really matter.   Am I being selfish? Of course. My happiness matters more to me than hers, and that doesn't scare me. I could judge myself on others' opinions of me and allow myself to be guilted into a project that is not my responsibility and would be a very poor decision for me in particular (and quite likely my sister, as well), but I put myself first.   My dad's side of the family has a long history of depression and we've had 4 suicides in the past 3 years because people have it in their heads that it's valiant to give up their happiness for the happiness of others. I had the same issues, and I attempted to take my life a few years back after sacrificing everything to help someone.  After years of counseling and self-strengthening, I am ok with who I am. Whether I'm selfish or bitchy doesn't matter; I need to take care of myself first. It's great that you can do such things without it harming you mentally, but I'm not like that. I have no misconception of myself as some valiant knight coming in to save the day. I'll do what I can, but I will not sacrifice myself playing savior."

It could just be your phrasing, but it sounds as though you're blaming your sister for being the way she is.   I'm also not sure why you included the list of examples of traits of her disorder.... I can't imagine you'd do the same for someone diagnosed with any other illness or disorder. Are you trying to allow everyone to visualise how difficult she is to justify your lack of care?   I don't mean to be harsh, but once they die, she's on her own.   So what's the problem? Your parents die and the State will look after your sister because you refuse to."
relationship_advice,3d34tc,Waterbellycrest,12,Mon Jul 13 14:00:08 2015 UTC,I think OPs issue is with her parents lack of care and planning for her sister's future.
relationship_advice,3d34tc,Lenovo21,-5,Mon Jul 13 15:22:52 2015 UTC,"I took it a different way - OP wants to know what to do to ensure she's not left looking after her sister, as a result of her parents lack of planning."
relationship_advice,3d34tc,Lenovo21,8,Mon Jul 13 15:31:53 2015 UTC,"I'm also not sure why you included the list of examples of traits of her disorder.... I can't imagine you'd do the same for someone diagnosed with any other illness or disorder.   Actually, I feel like this comes up a lot when people want specific advice on how to help someone or care for someone. For example, if someone posted about a family member who had recently undergone surgery and had mobility issues and wanted advice on how best to help them. I would definitely expect to see at least a vague description of the type of injury and the person's limitations regarding mobility (ex. can they walk easily? can they take stairs? can they drive?), and in fact, I've seen threads exactly like this.  OP is trying to establish that her sister is actually unable to live on her own, which is not immediately clear from the diagnosis alone (since many people with similar diagnoses can take care of themselves). She's asking for advice based on her sister's situation and it's not necessarily a bad thing that she's giving more in-depth advice on what exactly her sisters limitations are. Maybe there are too many details, but I don't think OP was wrong to include any details at all. They give a better idea of the situation.   So what's the problem? Your parents die and the State will look after your sister because you refuse to.   There are two extremes here. Either OP takes complete responsibility for her sister, or (as you suggest) she refuses all responsibility and this occurs. However, there are also more moderate approaches and middle ground. Also, one of the things that OP may want more advice about is her relationship with her parents and how best to approach this situation (and end-of-life planning in general)."

You didn't make a good decision but her actions don't fit the notion of her being either mature or kind-hearted.    I would break it off, and be the martyr.  Tell her you really feel guilty about your mistake and you just can't put her through this going forward.  Apologize and say you're broken up.  This will minimize the very real potential of her doing something vindictive and cruel to you and  your reputation.    Then learn about the qualities in yourself that you must change to be a better future partner.

He is deliberately ignoring your objections to his touching you sexually, just because he wants to do it. That's seriously assault. If someone random grabbed you and said ""sorry, can't help it,"" that wouldn't be acceptable, so why does he think it's acceptable when he is supposed to care for you? He is physically hurting you. He is emotionally hurting you. The ""in his sleep"" stuff seems sketchy, but the biggest issue I have is when he is full on awake and knows you are in pain and not okay with it (this is non consent), he still gropes you because he wants to. That's not okay.   Ps. If the 'rule' you refer to is him telling you that you can't wear clothes to bed, because he wants to play with you when you don't want him to, that's another huge red flag.

I did this with my first boyfriend and nothing changed after the many years together. He was 4 years older than I was but I always felt like the adult in the relationship. I finally broke it off (after too many years) and to this day (I heard through the grape vine) he is in the same boat as when I left him over a decade ago.   There are some people in life who never grow up and behind those people are usually enabling parents, girlfriends/boyfriends, wives/husbands.   One thing that causes me to end it was that I just hadn't resolved to support my partner for all our lives-I did everything and if I didn't do it, it didn't get done-period (which included every single thing you can think of).   We were really young when we got together and I was still working things out for myself. I could barely do things for myself, ya know-working-going to college at night, I just couldn't keep taking on someone who was dependent on me to keep things together.   When I broke up with him it was hard, I cried for weeks but shortly after that it felt like a  huge weight had been lifted. In my mind, having a partner in life is about helping each other out when times are tough but I think there have to be clear distinctions about what each of you bring to the table and the burdens should never fall only on one person."

relationship_advice,3d55ax,accidentproned,6,Mon Jul 13 19:22:33 2015 UTC,"This situation is ridiculous, for many reasons. You're helping her cheat on her boyfriend. I don't care if the boyfriend is okay with this; it's cheating. Relationships are made intimate because of the exclusivity of them. When you remove the exclusivity and allow someone to cuddle and spoon with someone else, it destroys the intimacy. You're driving a wedge between their relationship (Which is already bad to begin with, evidenced by his reading every single one of the texts you send her).    Get out. Now. Stop treating someone else's girlfriend like they're your girlfriend. It's not fair to her boyfriend. Plus, she's not worth having as a girlfriend because if she cheated with you, she'll cheat on you. How would you feel if she was your girlfriend and was cuddling and spooning with other guys?"
relationship_advice,3d55ax,TurtleSmile1,2,Mon Jul 13 17:48:25 2015 UTC,"My advice is to cut it out. Not only are you disrespecting this other guy, but she's showing that she's really a crappy person. Her boyfriend is uncomfortable and not happy with this, and she doesn't care? She told you she likes you when shes in a committed and obviously not open relationship with someone else? Her boyfriend should break it off with her and find someone who actually respects him."

relationship_advice,3d55ax,hpliferaft,2,Tue Jul 14 00:11:00 2015 UTC,Yes. Stop now. How do you think her boyfriend would feel were he to find out?
relationship_advice,3d55ax,pierrotte,2,Mon Jul 13 16:49:31 2015 UTC,"I mean, you didn't agree to exclusively date someone and then go cuddle with someone else, so you're not technically doing anything wrong (it's not your job to make sure that your friend doesn't cheat on her boyfriend), but she is cheating on him emotionally and a little bit physically, even if you aren't having sex.   I think it's ridiculous that he's asking you to back off as it's not really your business what kind of arrangement they have. He should be having it out with her and making her prioritize.   That said,  I'm super uncomfortable with doing anything that might be perceived as flirting let alone full on cuddling with a girl that I know has a girlfriend, so I wont let it go there. I also find it rather off putting that someone that is in a monogamous relationship with someone would flirt with someone else. It reeks of all sorts of dishonest tendencies, attention seeking, and low self-esteem. It starts to cancel out any attraction I had really quickly and then I have no desire to get close to them.  That dread you feel is guilt. Or perhaps some sort of vague discomfort with the situation. Stop cuddling and flirting with your friend and find a girl that's single and/or poly and have a non-relationship with her. In a way, you're giving your friend signals that say you'd like to date her and if she breaks up with her boyfriend she may try to get you to make good on your flirting. Don't lead her on like that."

Great morals there.   My philosophy is don't intentionally hurt other people. Technically OP is helping someone else hurt someone, which I'm also not okay with, but OP's behavior isn't bad in and of itself. OP isn't the one actively hurting the boyfriend, OP is just living his life and enjoying himself. He is not the one breaking someone else's trust.  But really we both think that he should stop doing what he's doing, so why does it even matter if I'm not morally outraged by the whole thing?"

But trust me through all of this I consider his feelings and I know that I cannot just play with his emotions of true and deep love for me, just because I want to sample what having meaningless sex with strangers feels like, as opposed to meaningful love in bed with this man Ive known for years and love and trust wholly.

Sex with strangers is terrible 90% of the time, you will not feel better if you go on a strange sex bender.   My brother was a ""cool"" guy in many ways. Did and sold a lot of drugs in high school, had the ladies lining up. It ruined the girl who he dated when he was 18-19, she felt like she could not hold up to these (in her eyes)thinner prettier girls he had been with in the past and she let it unravel her into craziness. The woman he is married to was quiet as a mouse, had a big ol butt, and was, arguably not the ""best"" he could do in the looks and life experience categories. But she is who he has chosen to spend the rest of his life with. If your BF wanted to be with the very best looking girl he could find, he probably could be. But he's with you, because he wants to be. Because you have what he is looking for. I'm sure he really appreciates that you know how to make good decisions and haven't made the same mistakes he has. And even if you are not super model pretty, who cares, you are what he wants, right now, just as you are. If you change to be like his ex girlfriends, you will no longer be you, the person he wants.   Your options are to let this ruin you or to bask in the affections of this guy that you seem really into. Jealousy is relationship poison, don't be jealous of those he has chosen to leave behind."

It wasn't fair not logical for me torture myself by thinking well I've never gotten fucked up on x and y drugs and he has. Honestly, who cares? I don't even like drugs so if going back and looking at the chances I was given to do so I would still say no and remained inexperienced in that area because it's simply not my thing. As for the hot girlfriends thing, I know it sounds immature, but if it makes you feel better and you don't put others down, it will help if you think about what you got that they don't.

And as a 25 yo woman who has a lot of drug/ partying/ sexual experience, I would be willing to sacrifice all of it if I had found someone like the guy you seemed to have found. He's apparently smart, charming, good looking, etc, etc, and above all else, he is crazy about you.   If I were you, I would start sharing experiences with him. Try psychedelics with him and spend a day hiking. Try new stuff in bed that you haven't done before. Having sex with a lot of guys isn't nearly as fulfilling then having sex with someone you're in love with in my opinion.   In closing, just make sure you're not about to make a really selfish decision you'll regret for a long time. There are other options. Good luck !"

The money is pretty much gone now. Maybe your bf can borrow money from his parents come textbook time or help them with odd jobs for cash. He should definitely talk to them about he feels.  You however should stay out of this unless they owe you money directly. Family and finances are a bad enough mix. You're going to end up on someone's bad side and it will be very easy to play this as your personal greed driving a wedge between family members.

relationship_advice,3d42qa,Carboi,3,Mon Jul 13 10:35:53 2015 UTC,"I have had one extremely unsuccessful relationship with someone who dealt with issues of anxiety and depression that sounds similar to yours, so maybe I can offer some insight. First and foremost:   The last 5 years of my life has been punctuated with periods of depression stemming from this anxiety. At one time or another these periods have been accompanied by alcohol abuse, marijuana abuse, self harm, and suicidal thoughts (all often induced by high-stress times in my life, i.e. not during the summer (right now) as I am a student) often in combinations and to varying degrees.   At no point whatsoever in your post do you discuss either medication or therapy. This would be a major red flag to me in terms of a romantic relationship. I would not ever consider being in a relationship with someone who has long-term mental issues and reoccurring episodes who was not actively managing them with therapy (and medication if deemed appropriate by a doctor).    I know from previous experience that sometimes I treat people I love very poorly during these times.   You need to be in control enough not to treat people you care about ""very poorly"". It would be totally fine if, when you feel an episode coming on, you could articulate something like: ""I know I react badly when I'm like this, so in order to avoid doing that to you, I need space"" or some other coping mechanism, but it's not okay to treat people badly whatever the reasoning behind it. Inadvertent abuse (if the behavior is extreme enough) is still abuse, no matter why it happens. I'm not saying you're abusive, but just trying to highlight that this aspect of your illness needs to be under good control for healthy romantic relationships.    At what point in a relationship (both in terms of progression of the relationship and in terms of time) is it reasonable to have a discussion about my history and what realistically may arise again?   I would not only have this conversation early (in the first few weeks or when becoming exclusive) but also offer educational materials on what it's like living with someone who struggles with mental illnesses. It can be extremely draining and difficult during a ""bad"" period to try and support both your partner and yourself, so they should have a good idea of what to expect.   How does one feel out exactly what the boundaries are and how to not cross the line?   This is something that would have to be negotiated person-by-person. For me, I'm comfortable proving a high level of support (reassurance, comfort, etc) and a high level of let's say ""effort"" (encouraging someone to complete tasks, stick with a program, be healthy, etc). I am also comfortable with periods in which a partner would need a lot of space from me, and I am comfortable being the person who receives less ""care"" in the relationship in terms of attention, effort, or what have you. What I am absolutely not comfortable with (as I'm sure you noticed!) is being treated in a cold, mean, or bad way by my partner.  I would go to the ends of the earth for a partner suffering from these issues, but I would not tolerate being treated poorly in return.   However, every person will have different boundaries. Some people could handle more bad treatment but be less willing to offer support. You'll only know what those boundaries are and how not to cross them by having lots of open communication with your partner."

relationship_advice,3d3ew4,UnclePaul50,10,Mon Jul 13 05:59:31 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna share a little cautionary tale with you that will hopefully sway your decision.  My coworker Robin met her husband about fifteen years ago. At the time, she was a young, fiercely independent new teacher who loved punk rock and pasta. Her husband was Indian. Now he swore he loved her because she was different from all the Indian women he dated. Less demure and timid. And everything was fine until the kids came around.   Pretty much immediately, her husband changed. Started expecting her to behave differently. Expected her to raise her children the way Indian parents do, which couldn't be more different from her natural parenting style of letting kids be themselves.   Fast forward to now. Robin isn't ""allowed"" to wear black because her husband doesn't like it. She isn't ""allowed"" to go out with her friends because he doesn't think taking care of the kids is his responsibility. She is expected to have dinner prepared every night to his standards (no gluten or dairy, because robin has gotten fat and that is not okay). He is constantly tattling on her to his mother, who has no issues intervening in their lives. I have heard her use the word ""allowed"" way more times than any adult woman should. She never calls her husband by name. I think I've heard his name twice in three years.  She just calls him ""my husband"", like he owns her.   TL;DR: don't marry the Islamic dude. No matter what he says now he will revert to his upbringing. His family will hate you and make your life a living hell, and you will lose control of your children."

I was born and raised in a Muslim family with not so strict parents. I don't practice Islam as much as I should but that's my choice. I live with my girlfriend, a Christian, who is also not serious about it.   Eversince I've told my parents about her and my plans to marry her, they've been very finicky about converting her first. The funny thing is that they, themselves, aren't too serious about being Muslim either. My mom and dad usually only pray during Ramadan and stay away from pork and that's all.   They also tell me things like how I'll be heading straight to heaven if I convert just one person while I'm alive...  So after reading your post, I have a some perspective on how to handle my own situation. Thanks !"

Its in the hands of the police and soon the courts.  I would continue trying to be a good friend as usual, but offer little to no advice and have little to no discussion about this with either of them.  If they insist, tell them you only know the two conflicting things they each said to you, and you will tell the police those two stories and let them figure out the situation."

Apparently a very contrite one with a conscience who hopefully will never drink again but a rapist nonetheless.   In a perfect world he would be sent to prison for proper education and rehabilitation, come out in a few years and be a better man. In reality prison is about retribution and even if he comes out unscathed the sex offender brand will effectively ruin the rest of his life.    I don't blame Meghan at all in this, she is the victim. I just wish our justice system had more then two settings, complete freedom and total ruination for criminals."
relationship_advice,3d5aus,mamaingrouchland,3,Mon Jul 13 19:56:55 2015 UTC,"I realize that you are writing this at a confusing time, but his story as you present it (she was coming on to me, we kissed, and I tried to have sex with her until she said no) is a description of a rape. He had sex with her without obtaining consent. That is rape. Whether she said no before he penetrated her is not relevant. You can't just stick your dick in somebody and then if they say no pull it out, and then say it's not rape because they hadn't said no yet.   I understand that he might feel bad and be concerned how she is doing, because he is a nice guy who never wanted to hurt anybody, but thought he could just help himself to sex. It is still rape.   Since you just met her three weeks ago, I would hope that she will have others in her life that she will go to for support rather than you. One thing that you can do is do your best to facilitate any financial or legal complications that will result from her wanting to find a new place to live. If she is on the lease, help find someone to take her place.   Also, write down your memories of the evening and what was said by both so you won't forget if you have to testify in court. Don't let anyone's words distort your memories."

Drunkenly trying to hook up is not rape. Frankly you dont know what happened. Its purely he said she said. Leave it to the court and abstain from judgment. Also dont blame yourself for shit you didnt do, you're not a police officer and as you said it looked completely typical when you left so there's really no way for you to have suspected anything (assuming shes not lying)   Trying to be a nice guy doesn't absolve him of what did happen.   But thats the thing, you dont know what happened. You really trying to tell me you're impartial? You have no evidence and already picked a side. She had a rape kit done and they found no evidence which is why he was released. As to being a ""good guy to absolve him of what happened"", wasnt he normally a nice guy?

I'm generally quite inclined to agree with you.... my statement, ""it's still rape"" is premature.  The only side I've taken is the one that puts them both in the best light...which is really more to help me interact with them both normally, it's not really my own judgement on the situation. My point is that being a 'nice guy' isn't enough to say he didn't do something....just because I have a good impression of him previously or that he is concerned after the fact isn't really evidence towards anything. You're right, I won't talk to them about the events any more.  Rape kits and the other exams conducted take time to evaluate. It hasn't come back clean, because it hasn't come back at all yet."

It should be the other way around. And stop making excuses for her terrible, selfish behavior. I am pig-headed and know that I would end things with her, period.

Regarding the relationship:  Never forgive a cheater, especially cheating of this magnitude.  By forgiving, you only encourage the behavior.  Her level of cheating is unforgiveable.  Note:  I'm not a teenager :)  I'm not an immigration attorney, but if you can honestly get a work visa in NAC1 as you suggest moving towards a permanent resident card and eventual citizenship, I would do it.  It will be good for your overall mental health, money and inconvenience notwithstanding, to completely separate your life from this horrible person.  That said, I've never had to deal with citizenship and immigration issues myself, although my wife got her permanent resident status years before we met, and... well...  I think if asked, she would say she was proud to have come on a proper visa and done everything the right way through her professional credentials rather than a sham relationship.  Please consider all advice besides mine, and good luck."

Regardless of how nice she is, how much time goes by, how much she tries to make it up to you, no matter how transparent she becomes, you will never ever trust her again the way you once did. Never.

There won't ever be any trust and you'll always have resentment. Go with option 2, stay married on paper, but separate physically. Start your life over again.

Second, at the very least you need to go with option 2, but it sounds like option 3 shouldn't be off the table because you have the right mindset (accepting some responsibility for your part in an unhappy relationship) and people can and do recover from adultery as a stronger couple quite often, but I don't know anyone who has managed that without the help of a professional couples counselor.   If you believe that she truly feels remorse and that she wants to make things work, and you really feel that she is the best woman you've ever known, I think you should try to save the marriage. You guys had so many outside stresses to your early marriage that it would be a shame for two people who love each other to completely call it quits without trying sincerely to work it out with a professional for a couple months."

The fact is most younger people and teenagers are sad and insecure and want to be in a relationship so badly that they'll stick it out.  I would say the average ADULT advice is:  ""Don't be a pathetic teenager.  You are a capable adult who is better off alone than with a cheater.""

relationship_advice,3d3qfr,jg1124,5,Mon Jul 13 07:37:32 2015 UTC,"First,  figure out where you stand on marriage.   Do you want to get married?   Why?   Is it because of the symbolism of commitment,  the tax breaks,  the insurance eligibility,  etc.?   Do you want a wedding?   Would a courthouse marriage be okay?   Could you stay with him without resentment if you never got married or didn't have a wedding?   Once you have your answers,  talk to him and get clarification about his: does he think marriage is unnecessary,  or that weddings are unnecessary?   How would you two compensate for the benefits marriage would provide?  (for example,  if he can't get on your insurance policy,  could he afford one equally as good?)  Would he get married if he could skip the wedding bit?   Would he get married if he could better protect himself with a prenup?  What is driving his opinion -  wedding costs,  social pressure,  baggage from his divorce?   Once you see where he stands on things,  work on a compromise.   You show him how his concerns would be managed if you two got married in your ideal way.   He shows you how he can meet your needs without having a marriage/wedding.   If legal marriage is a no-go for him,  could you two have a commitment ceremony to reaffirm your love for each other?   Could you two get rings as a symbol without making a formal engagement or ever having a wedding?   Work together and meet somewhere in the middle.   If there's something neither of you can compromise on,  then escalate to couples counseling or the unfortunate possibility of separation."

Once the relationship reaches a certain length, (protip here: Its a bit shorter than 5 years) without an honest proposal or planning, its never going to happen.  Especially since he's 37.

Go to a book store and do some reading, focus really hard on not getting distracted and paying attention to the story.  It is impossible to know what is going in your boyfriends head, or where he's at; It is time to watch out now for yourself, and focus on moving on in a positive way (even if things aren't over for sure at this point).  If he does finally contact you, keep in mind that what he's done to you isn't something that is fair to you, especially after you've worked really hard to give him his space.  You need to watch out for you at this point, make sure you aren't going to get damaged any further emotionally or mentally.  Time to watch out for number one; And if he does want to get back together, make sure you watch out for yourself, make sure you aren't going to get hurt any further, don't blindly just jump back in with an ""all is forgiven"" attitude, make sure your interests are addressed (being emotionally and mentally safe and healthy).

If she's been on this same medication since you two started dating and the sex used to be more frequent, then it's likely this is just an excuse and what you're experience now is that the honeymoon period is over and this is her natural libido (unless there's some other issue in your relationship that she has not brought up).  Still, if she was receptive to this solution it would show she cares about improving things between you two and would take away her excuse.  At the end of the day, if sexual compatibility is important to you, this might simply be a deal breaker -- travel schedule or not.  These things never change on their own, so you have to be proactive in either addressing the situation or moving on from it.  Also, there's nothing to say you two can't remain really good friends.

Don't put the focus on them, focus on how the situation makes you feel and what you can do together to remedy that."
relationship_advice,3d17wm,iconogasm,5,Sun Jul 12 18:10:34 2015 UTC,I have briefly mentioned it before but she seems to think it is not worth mentioning because you can't ever change anyone's mind. Its her belief that people just do not change how they feel about things so there is no point in trying.
relationship_advice,3d17wm,iconogasm,15,Sun Jul 12 19:14:59 2015 UTC,"Well I don't mean talking to her about changing their minds. I mean talking to her about what you two are going to do about how it makes you feel to be subjected to it. You could decide to talk to them about it together, that it makes uncomfortable and ask them to make an effort not to discuss when you're around. Or you could decide that you're not going to be around them anymore and make sure she's okay with that. But she needs be supportive of an option that helps you with this and actively work with you on it."
relationship_advice,3d17wm,iconogasm,3,Sun Jul 12 19:46:50 2015 UTC,Thanks. I think talking to her seriously about it is a good start :)

relationship_advice,3d17wm,babblueyed5,5,Sun Jul 12 20:38:07 2015 UTC,I know right. I couldn't disagree more with her. i feel people's capacity to change is pretty strong overall. i think it might have more to do with her not wanting to ruffle feathers. People not changing may just be an excuse
relationship_advice,3d17wm,sometimesineedhelp,2,Sun Jul 12 21:16:20 2015 UTC,"I have a pretty racist, bigoted mother. I share none of her views and I know it's impossible for me to change the way she feels on these issues. She's too steadfast in her faith and what God thinks is right and wrong. She grew up with these views and I have no doubt she'll die with then as well. Yeah some people change, but I think it's too late for others. My mom also makes me life hell if I try to argue with her about this, so I usually let it go. Your gf might be in a similar situation, or it might not be such a big issue if you don't have to interact with the family too often."
relationship_advice,3d17wm,sadsappysucker,7,Mon Jul 13 02:06:52 2015 UTC,"So I am a lot like your girlfriend. I grew up in a very rural area of Indiana that's racist. That includes my family to varying degrees. Both my dad and little brother have been known to say really stupid things when in public or around my boyfriend (who has a fairly liberal and educated family). I left at 18 for college and never went back. I went from being around people who think Rush Limbaugh is some sort of Demi God to having my own political opinions based on education and my world around me. This, I guess to say, means that I may not be correct in the assessment of the world either. So, I'm progressive liberal, family tea party republican. I still love them. I still want to spend time with them. If every time I got near them I corrected their politically incorrect statements it would be no fun and they would rightfully stop wanting to spend time with me. We all ignore most things, but I know I'm not going to change their opinions and they aren't going to change mine.   So, my boyfriend has been warned about my family behavior. I apologize for blatant things that happen, even though I don't have to. I always give him the option of not spending time with them, but they actually get along really well when not talking politics. Try talking to your girlfriend... You and her may have similar feelings on the subject, but she just doesn't want to ruin family time by calling out all the bullshit."
relationship_advice,3d17wm,DL55,5,Mon Jul 13 00:26:43 2015 UTC,"I'm considering either not being around her family anymore unless she is willing to call them out.   Why does SHE have to do it?  I'm in a similar situation with my boyfriend and his shitty family and reading your post just now gave me a minor epiphany. All this time I've been thinking it's not my place to say anything and have been keeping quiet while at the same time I'm getting really really angry and resentful at my boyfriend (who I know HATES the way they are) just letting their bullshit slide.   It's not JUST racism though, it is relentless bullying of other family members as well as non-stop completely hateful and out of touch political statements... (plus racism of course)    I just decided that it bothers me enough to call them out next time I see it myself. I call co-workers, friends, strangers on reddit, and my own family out when they are mindbogglingly wrong about stuff, why do I let these assholes get a free pass? I haven't done it yet, but I have a feeling that once I do, I'll stop being so resentful that my boyfriend doesn't say anything about it because just giving myself the permission right now to treat them the same way I treat everyone else already makes me feel less annoyed about the situation."
relationship_advice,3d17wm,kc1328,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:58:33 2015 UTC,I know she would get very upset at me if I did call them out. I almost feel like she has to be the one to make that call. I'm gonna have a conversation with her about it and see where she stands.
relationship_advice,3d17wm,HemingwaysBush,2,Mon Jul 13 12:19:31 2015 UTC,"Am in your GF's situation. Family has always been ultra conservative bigots. Recently, in the wake of Ferguson, confederate flag, etc, we decided to set some boundaries together. We're fine with political disagreements if they can use polite language, but whenever the racial slurs get dropped, we simply leave the room, very abruptly. If we are on the phone, I just say ""Well, I gotta go. I can't support that language.""  My dad is learning not to talk that way around me, and just the other day decided he's going to try to stop acting so racist!"
relationship_advice,3d17wm,Teeklin,2,Mon Jul 13 12:17:02 2015 UTC,"Ok. You post and all the comments amused me. I get this, I'm from the south as are my SO's folks.  My family was used to my outspoken ways. My SOs family had an unspoken rule that no one should outright disagree with his father. I told him early on that I would respect that rule but not if it directly affected me personally ( keep the peace in general conversation). This went on for sometime until my fil made a direct observation (negative) about something I was doing. I told him to fuck off, that I have been respectful of his hateful comments and that he would be respectful about my decisions. 20 years later we have had many great conversations, he has become much more enlightened and when I really want to crack him up I say ""so let's talk politics""."
relationship_advice,3d17wm,plastic_venus,5,Wed Jul 15 21:02:29 2015 UTC,"after having a number of relationships where the GF got offended at my family (for assorted reasons) and creating a very awkward situation which in two cases undermined our relationship. So after those debacles I promsed my self if the roles were reversed I would not create an awkward situation for my Partner, I would discuss it with her but they are her family and so you could put her in the middle. So discuss it with her, tell her how you really feel and gauge her reaction, see what she wants to do.  On this specific topic the whole thing about the battle flag is tied to their identity and its been challenged, its really just blown up in the past few months so its on everyones mind. Really most southerners are good people who basically like the rebel aspect and disassociate the racist aspect of their history. When they say white people are being attacked it sounds funny to northerners (im from Canada so it sounds even weirder) but really they are just talking about their identity.  And race relations are complicated so its not going to go away over night, I think it will take an entire generation or more before this will ever go away. When I was with my black GF I would never think of driving through the deep south together even today but it appears you live it, so you cant fight everyone.  Dont forget it was 25 years after the civil war when the reconstruction ended and the south rose again with the red shirts and the KKK, Jim Crow laws etc. Dixie is a very powerful symbol and deep history so this has and will be a very long game so just from a general perspective you need to play it especially to support your GF.  So unless they challenge you directly then I would say bite your tongue, get along to go along. You dont have to be best buds but be polite to support your Girlfriend. We have all walked into some situation like being a democrat or liberal and walk into a room of republicans, your out gunned and are not going to fight the whole room or family. Ive tried a few times and got no where.  You sound like a likeable guy so I imagine if your polite and they like you at first, your actual views will get out one way or another and so if they know you as a person they too may be polite in return."
relationship_advice,3d17wm,Teeklin,0,Sun Jul 12 19:44:02 2015 UTC,You are right about the southern identity running deep around here. I am sort of a military history enthusiast and I love the Civil War. Sometimes I feel that I could bring a different perspective to the conversation if only I had the nerve to speak up. I just feel guilty sitting there quietly sometimes because I feel through my silence that I'm just enabling.  I have considered going ahead and hiding her family on Facebook so I don't have to see anything they post. Unfriending them would be understandably harsh from her perspective.
relationship_advice,3d17wm,plastic_venus,7,Sun Jul 12 20:25:44 2015 UTC,"I do this. My sister is dating, well they've been together for two years, so maybe more than casually dating this guy.   His ideas are insufferable (racially, morally, politically) to me, but he is important to my sister, and we are close. I can't change him, or say a lot of negative things about him to my sister just because of my personal beliefs and ideas.  I've learned to just unfollow his posts on Facebook and it got better."
relationship_advice,3d17wm,Teeklin,-1,Sun Jul 12 22:24:20 2015 UTC,Don't let your sister marry an asshole because you are too afraid and polite to create conflict. There is no place in this world for decent people to sit silently by and let racism and bigotry go unopposed.

relationship_advice,3d17wm,kc1328,0,Mon Jul 13 09:23:49 2015 UTC,"It is so beyond foreign to me to think about the whole scenario.  If my little sister brings home an asshole who says asshole things I'm going to call him out on being an asshole, and make sure to do it loudly and consistently every time he acts like an asshole.  If she still continues to see him, despite all that, then she would be choosing him over her family which I guess is fine...but at least it wouldn't be tacitly approving of the guy's behavior through silence and giving her the impression that he is welcome around the family.  When someone does or says something that goes against your moral convictions or common decency or both, you don't just sit there and keep your mouth shut to be polite or avoid conflict.  That's how awful ideas are circulated and how terrible groups start in the first place."

I just think you're oversimplifying a very difficult issue.   I mean, coming from a family full of casual racists with a girlfriend who has dated some scumbags, trust me when I say I know how complicated it can be.  Still never stopped me from calling any of them out on it.  Sure it leads to some family members that I'm no longer very close with, but I'm okay with that because they're kind of assholes anyway.  And it definitely altered my sister's opinion of the jackasses she was dating when they were no longer able to spout their bullshit with impunity like they were used to doing and instead had to stand there and look like a moron when someone actually called them on their shit.  I get the feeling that both of those guys had never had a single person in a room with them step up and say, ""Whoa, watch your fucking mouth"" when they casually dropped the N-word.  They seemed SHOCKED that someone would actually say something, and when they tried to defend their use of the word it was just embarrassing for them.  It's this weird line you walk in the north/south border states where there are a TON of racists but also a ton of decent people, and most of the polite/civilized people are so non-confrontational that they don't want to call any of the racists out on their shit.  It is INFURIATING to watch sometimes.  And it doesn't mean that you have to be a dick to your family to stand up for decency, it just means that you can't let shit slide without providing counterpoints.  They're still going to believe what they believe and they're still going to say stupid shit, but if you don't provide them with an echo chamber to bounce bad ideas around in then at least you can say you tried.  And at least other people around you who share your views no longer have to feel cowed or ashamed or sit back quietly and agree, they have someone else on their side who they can back up."
relationship_advice,3d17wm,kaista,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:13:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly, that's what I thought for a long time. I thought it was my duty as a sister to tell her what's up.  I did tell her what I think of him many times. But you can't control other people. She's the one who is making that mistake. I can't make her not love him. I can only love and support her, even when she is making a decision that I think is ultimately wrong.  And it's not like he's a murder or criminal, his ideas don't match with mine. Like for example he doesn't think global warming is real, that college is a waste of money, or that racial tensions still exist, etc. He's a young guy with stupid ideas.  If he was beating her or shit like that it's a totally different thing. If he was calling my sister and my family slur's I wouldn't stand for that. I agree with you on that."

It just wasn't worth the fight for them, especially since they knew it'd be temporary.  If you only see them occasionally, picking your battles is an option. I'm absolutely not condoning her family's behavior, but she might still feel family obligations to them regardless of their ridiculous views and thus feel obligated to see them every once in a while. You guys could scale the visits back, though. Maybe knowing she thinks they're ridiculous too will help.

Protect yourself more than trying to protect his feelings.

In your other post you said your fiance has made it clear that if it came to you or his friend he would pick his friend. You haven't really said what exactly the friend has done, but it doesn't really matter. If that's the attitude your future husband has, that is a major red flag.

relationship_advice,3d3lut,futuremrsf,9,Mon Jul 13 13:57:30 2015 UTC,"So, I just realized that I've seen a few of your posts.  So let's do a recap of the information you've shared about your FH throughout:  1) He has said he'd choose his groomsman over you.  2) He hasn't touched you for months.  3) You and him have been fighting alot, and not necessarily making up after it quickly either.  4) He has shown possibly unreasonable expectations of you.  5) He ""supports"" you but that doesn't necessarily last.  6) He's taken out his failings on you.  7) He's abandoned you places.  8) You've questioned whether he actually wants to marry you.  In each of the threads, people have said not to necessarily sweat it, because it could just be stress and worked through, and normally I'd agree that it's possible - but put it all together, and it takes on a  whole other view entirely then just wedding stress.  He's not prioritizing you, he isn't supporting you, he is expecting you to be wonder woman but doesn't reciprocate - what does this tell you?  Only you know the true context of the situations you've posted about on reddit - but looking at all of them, what does that make you think or feel?"
relationship_advice,3d3lut,BadLuckNovelist,3,Mon Jul 13 15:40:27 2015 UTC,"OP, please think about this. Often times when we have a fight or situation where our SO makes us feel unworthy, we block it from our mind afterward. So when the next one happens we too often tell ourselves ""but it's just this once, so I'll let it slide"" because we worked so hard to suppress past events and feelings. Please think back about just the few things you've shared recently - and I say ""few"" because I tend to believe that for every story shared there's one that is still hidden. Perhaps on their own, each of the above points could be mended and moved on from. (Except 1, IMO.) But looking at all these events together, that have happened over a very short period of time, you need to step back and ask yourself if moving ahead with this marriage is right for you."
relationship_advice,3d3lut,Prairiegirl4,6,Mon Jul 13 17:47:11 2015 UTC,Going off of your posts in the weddingplanning subreddit about your situation I would postpone the wedding at the very least.   Only two of your relatives are coming. Is this because all your relatives or shitty or are they trying to avoid your FH/don't support your relationship?  Your FH is upset you don't like his groomsman/would choose him over you. Now this isn't right no matter how you slice it. You guys are supposed to be a team. Unless you don't like his friend for no reason or are somehow controlling over who he is friends with in general there is no need for this behavior from your fiancé.   Have you guys done any premarital counseling?? You sound super stressed and don't seem to be getting any support from your family OR fiancé. Please take care of yourself.

My current boyfriend and I took things really slow, I think he was trying to go slow because he saw a lot of potential in this relationship, and he didn't want to begin things over something dumb like getting drunk and hooking up or something. We hung out a few times in situations like this, bonding and getting close, and without making ""the move"" and the butterflies were dancing. After those few times of hangouts, I will always remember he sent me this text he sent me ""your self-respect is appealing"" and I knew he meant that in reference to us taking things slow.

Every time she throws one of these tantrums (and they are tantrums, she acts extraordinarily like a child), she tells me, my father and my siblings how much she hates us, and repeats over and over she wants a divorce.   As soon as she's calmed down, she acts like nothing has happened. She'll go back to going the household chores. She'll act perfectly normal and healthy with us. Until something else sets her off, and the cycle begins again.   Obviously there's more to my mother than that, and she has many positive attributes too. We do worry that her outbursts are due to some form of mental illness and we've talked to her about it, but she refuses to acknowledge anything about it. So this is my first bit of advice: ask your mother if she'll acknowledge what she's doing, and if she's wiling to try and change it. You mentioned you think she might be bipolar, in which case there's plenty of help she can get! The key thing is, it has to come from her though.   As for supporting your father... Just be there for him, it sounds like you're already doing a great job. But make sure you look after yourself too! Keep on reminding each other that it's not either of your faults, and you're going to be there for each other no matter what happens with your mum.   Feel free to PM me if you'd like to chat about this some more. I'm here for you <3"

While your father should seek someone professional to teach him how to cope with crisis and not burden his children to this extend, your mother certainly has to get some help.  It seems as if she needs change (thus new interior...) and feels unhappy in the marriage (thus threatening to leave, drawing attention to her not-loving-your-father etc.) ... I do not think she means that.  She kind of wants attention, but cannot deal with her emotions somehow. You should help her get counseling before your father has a nervous breakdown."
relationship_advice,3d44zy,ThrowawayTwinLover,2,Mon Jul 13 11:06:49 2015 UTC,"I think you should sort out things with the girl before you tell your best friend you are in love with her. Have you gone on dates yet to really get to know her?   You can also ask your friend for ""permission"" before you ask her out, but that would get awkward if she refuses.  What do you think?"
relationship_advice,3d44zy,strange_people,2,Mon Jul 13 11:49:43 2015 UTC,"I was definitely thinking the latter as he's the type to want that. It certainly doesn't help that a couple months ago he went out with/ shortly dated one of his sister's closest friends, it didn't end well but they seem to be friends again now. Thanks again!"
relationship_advice,3d44zy,Jobcv314,2,Tue Jul 14 10:34:46 2015 UTC,"Make sure you consider the friendship too. My rule is, unless it leads to marriage it'll end eventually. You're only 18. Chances are you'll see several more people before you find the one. Is this important enough to you that if/when there's a disagreement or argument that your friend may end up being in the middle? He'll have to try an stay neutral, and that may be difficult depending in what the problem is. Are you willing to risk the friendship over something that may not last? And assuming it ends one day, it may be hard to pick up where you left off with your friend. My philosophy is never do business with friends or relatives, and never become romantically involved with a friends-anything. Meaning a friends friend (close friend that is), or anyone related to them. Because I'm unwilling to trade what I have now to get something that may have a shelf life. If I were in your shoes I'd look elsewhere. There's several billion people on the planet, but a good friendship isn't easy to find. Good luck in whatever you decide to do. I hope everything works out for you."
relationship_advice,3d44zy,Jobcv314,2,Mon Jul 13 15:07:12 2015 UTC,"Wow, that makes a ton of sense and I'm taking it under consideration. As I mentioned in my other comment there was a similar situation a couple months ago wherein my friend began to see one of his sister's closest friends, it ended up ending badly and the sister and her friend didn't really speak for a few weeks (mostly out of respect for her brother) however, now they act as if nothing happened so it's definitely confusing. Thanks so much for your advice, it's greatly appreciated."

I'm an unrepentant slovenly ass, but I'm nice to my girl (which is actually better than being nice overall; it makes her feel special since I'm only nice to her). I completely understand how at a loss you must feel, but the matter really is as simple as I said.  You know this girl, simply by virtue of being her boyfriend. And if you don't know her that well, then the first step is figuring out what would make her happy. The generic favors (dinners, dates, impersonal gifts) are good starters, but favors that show you know and understand her are the real winners.   The important thing at this stage is to show you care. Then you can move on to showing that you understand."

relationship_advice,3d3cur,Hurrem_Hurrem,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:26:54 2015 UTC,"I think the important thing is to not get caught up in the idea of big romantic gestures, but to actively try to think of little things throughout the day/week that would please her.  When you drop by the store for toilet paper, pick her up her favorite snack just because. When you see she's super busy/stressed out, think about what you can do to help - maybe that means giving her a back massage, or doing a chore for her, or just providing an ear for her to vent. And it's okay to say, ""Babe, you've got a lot going on right now. What can I do to help?"" Show her affection - kisses on the forehead, hugs from behind. Give her sincere compliments - when she does something thoughtful for you, let her know how much you appreciate her; if she looks particularly pretty one day, tell her how beautiful she is. Does she have a particular hobby/interest? Depending on what it is, try to learn about it. Send a text message to her every now and then just to say you're thinking of her and love her.  Point being, big romantic gestures are nice, but showing your significant other your love should be an active, daily process."
relationship_advice,3d4282,MudGutsGlory,10,Mon Jul 13 10:28:25 2015 UTC,"I think it's probably a case of the grass being greener syndrome. 6 years is a pretty long time to be in a relationship, and a good relationship takes work to maintain. I think you've been caught up in the excitement of flirting with a new girl, and it's making you forget the reason that you got with your fiancée in the first place. The spark between you both may have faded over the years, but are you doing anything to help light it up again? Try to look at your fiancée through new eyes, and see what you find.  At the very least, you should probably limit contact, flirty or otherwise, with the new girl. It's just muddying the waters. Think about what you want from life and a spouse, communicate with your fiancée, and I'm sure you'll work out what the right decision for you both is."

We've been trying to do more stuff together lately and be a bit more attentive to each other's needs but I'm finding it a bit hard. How do you go about approaching something with new eyes? Any trick to it?"
relationship_advice,3d4282,CallaMillie,2,Mon Jul 13 11:54:19 2015 UTC,"Well, when my SO gives me the strops and I feel like it's not worth it, for whatever reason, or I see a cute boy and get a tummy flutter and plan our life together, I honestly just take a step back and think about what kind of person I want to be. I love my SO, but that didn't come overnight, and I'm also not constantly thinking of how great he is.   I'd say that by trying to spend more time together and do things is a really good step, but is it quality time? IE is it just sitting around on phones while in each others company, or is it actually engaging with each other? It's summer in the northern hemisphere at the moment, I hope you're taking advantage of it!  I guess as a final note, just try to remember as love matures, it changes. It's not always going to be skipping through a field of roses, but if you work on your relationship, it will evolve with you both. Don't throw away a good thing for a few months of excitement, or you might end up with years of regret."
relationship_advice,3d4282,strange_people,4,Mon Jul 13 21:46:38 2015 UTC,Cherish what you have and do not look on the other side of the meadow.   I also think it is not a nice move that you flirt behind your fiancée's back - so that the other girl asks you out for a date even when she knows you are engaged. Maybe she gets a kick out of it - but what the heck are YOU doing there?   Your GF should reconsider getting married to you.

Nobody can tell you what to do and how to feel etc.  But please break up with your girlfriend - she does not deserve to be with a(n emotional) cheater out of narcissism.  You are searching for vanity - and unless you do not fill yourself with something meaningful, you will always have the feeling ""something is missing"" in your life."

relationship_advice,3d4282,pdvdw,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:39:42 2015 UTC,"Please trust me, and talk to other folks who are married about it, issues like this are WAY more difficult when married. Even the most well intentioned people fall into this - once married you don't work as hard. No one wants to admit this but it is true. The thing is - you really need to work even harder once married for the relationship than when single, but people slack off. Things are the best they are ever going to be right now, the excitement of being engaged, the promise of a future together, all that should have you swooning. If you are not, you would be well advised to consider this strongly."

If you date people/marry before having the love of God in your life you will never be satisfied. That is why so many people divorce today.   You are trying to get something from your partner that she can't give you. You were designed to have a relationship with the Creator of the universe, and He loves and cares for  you more than your girlfriend ever could.   I will probably get downvoted but I'm telling you the truth out of love. The truth will set you free.   So if you'd like to challenge what I'm saying, sincerely ask God to reveal Himself to you. There's a verse in the Bible that says if you seek Me with your whole heart you will find Me. He wasn't kidding.   I'm talking as if you don't have relationship with Him, excuse me if you do, in that case, focus on Him first and then the rest will be added on to you.   Blessings brother :)"

Your kid is your problem.    Talk to a lawyer and see what you need to do to get her suicide threats and anger issues documented so that you can get primary custody.  She isn't stable, and that is not a good environment for your child.  You are so focused on enabling her and meeting her needs (you're not even in a relationship with her, for pete's sake) that you forget that your primary responsibilities are to yourself and your child.     now, I will have to put on this charade for months!

You don't need to have any sort of relationship with her to be a good father to your son, other than co-parenting decision making (if that is how custody plays out.)  P.S. I don't know where you live and what her immigration status is, but if there is any chance at all that she or her parents will try to leave with your kid, you need to be protected.

The fits he throws guilt trip me like no other~ i did tell him we were over once and he just sat outside my house crying and waitting untill i let him in.

Hate to say it, but I think you need to tell him in no uncertain terms that it's over and that you will call the cops if he pulls the wait-outside thing. I know he's probably harmless, but because you took him back the last time, he'll think he can do the same nonsense again."

His parents divorced and he loves both equally and his family went from basically millionares to bankrupt. He is not really used to the middle class life style. I am trying to take that into consideration as well, but its also another reason why we are very different. I was rased in a ghetto and with basically no proper family. It is kind of hard to sympathise with him, but i know it took a signifacnt toll on him. Should i wait till he is doing better at home and school?"

relationship_advice,3d3hpj,seekingsecretadvice,2,Mon Jul 13 05:45:38 2015 UTC,"I was in her shoes recently.  My ex went about it in a very bad way and I am going to give you a few suggestions based on my experience:   Just do it.  Don't make it seem like a break or there is a possibility for something down the road.  She will cling on to this. Dont try to let her down easy.  For example - saying lots of nice things about her, you will find someone great its just not me, etc.  This was said to me and it did not help. Cut contact.  Wanting to remain friends may seem appealing but I don't see that working out well for her.   I say all of these because I would bet they will give your gf false hope the relationship can be rekindled.  If you really feel this way and do not see a future there is nothing wrong with that.  I was on the other end of this and while I was confused in the beginning, things are much clearer once time passes.  Even if your gf disagrees with your decision, it doesnt matter.  She needs to accept that and move on.  And with time she will."

I just truly love her still and even though I am going to be breaking up with her, it will be just as much a loss for me as it is for her. I so wish we could still be friends somehow, she is such a good person and didn't do anything horribly wrong, I just know deep down that in the long run, things wouldn't work out well. I just feel like this will be the worst thing I have ever had to do. I want to be selfish and wait it out some more because I don't want to leave her and also I want to give her a bit of warning maybe. Should I give her warning? I feel like I am figuratively waiting around around corner with a baseball bat about to give her a sucker punch like swing to the face that she is just not expecting at all.

Even if she wants to remain friends it sounds like that might mess with you a little bit as well.  The last thing you want is to think to yourself - 'man why did I ever break up with her' only to get back together and instantly realize why you did that in the first place.  I would not give a warning.  I just do not see a scenario where that makes things easier for her.  Just meet with her in person and talk to her like an adult about how you feel.  She may never fully understand your thought process.  This is just a hard part about relationships.  If you want to find that person who you do see a future with later, then you have to do this now.  Unfortunately thats just the way it is : /"

Especially if its destructive to you to be with them. I think its a good move. In terms of your extended family I think the best approach is to say either them or me and let them decide, no hard feelings, perhaps they will alternate, perhaps who ever runs the event takes a side and never invites you, I think this is a consequence of your choice to estrange yourself from your Mother.  Lastly you need to forgive your Mother for your own sake, this is not a contradiction to what I said above. It sounds like you are good with your choice but to really be good with it I think you need to understand that your Mother is a human being and this is how she is and forgive her for it so you can truly let it go.

Because if you already have open communication around the issue, you have every right to say that it makes you uncomfortable and ask that he not be in touch with her. Not that I believe she's a threat in any way, but their relationship is rife with sexual tension and if you wanted to make that demand you could. On the other hand, if you got that information by looking into his email / texts while he was out of the room... that's not cool, and would (rightfully) scare off just about anyone.

As easy as i can put it, having been married before and now, soon to be divorced, this guy doesnt/cant love again anytime soon, and thats just being upfront. Loving after being separated is something emotionally taxing and takes time to develop. If he said he doesnt love u, it means he just doesnt. What is love to begin with? He was married and now hes getting divorced. He thought he was in love then? right? We all dont know what love is, and we cant control another person, we all hope that we end up with someone we all spend the rest of our lives with.

relationship_advice,3d3wnp,Bellaxati,3,Mon Jul 13 10:02:37 2015 UTC,"Why are you trying to 'interpret' what he said, or ask for the meaning behind it?  He's being very direct, upfront and honest. He said exactly what he means.    You are dating a guy.  You don't say how long you've been dating him.  You told him you love him.  You asked him if he loves you.  He was honest and said No, that he wouldn't call it love, he can see himself being with you for a while and that you are like a lover or a partner.  THIS IS WHAT HE MEANS.  No more.  No less.    he said no.  He continued by saying that while he wouldn't call it love, he could see himself being with me for a while and that I was like a lover or a partner.   What a great guy not to lead you on.  What honesty.  What integrity.  How awesome to find a person to date and be lovers with who can tell you exactly what they feel and what they are thinking.  You don't have to guess.  He gave you the answer.  But you aren't hearing the answer.   The reason that you want to try to figure out 'what it means', is NOT him.  It is you.  You are blocking his answer.  You are failing to take him at his word, and listen and hear what he is saying.  You don't want honesty and you don't want the truth.  You would rather he lie to you, just to make you feel better.  So instead of taking EXACTLY what he said at face value, instead of seeing how he was honest and direct, instead of BELIEVING HIM, you want to try to make it be different.  You want to 'talk to him about it' and 'see what it means'.  IT means exactly what he said: he cares about you and wants to be with you.  He sees you as his lover and his partner and sees being with you a long time.  But he doesn't love you, at least not enough to marry you or make a commitment of forever.    Why can't you believe the words he says?  It's not a secret message.  It's not a foreign language.  He's not playing a game where you have to figure out 'what it means'.  HEAR HIS WORDS, listen to HIM instead of your insecurities, hear exactly HIS words...no more and no less.    AND WHY DO YOU THINK THIS WILL END?  He's TOLD you -in exact words- in his own words, full up front, honestly and directly, with no games, that he sees himself being with you for a while, that you are his lover and his partner.    So it's not going to end, let alone end 'badly'....after all...he's told you clearly he means to be with you a long while, so it's not going to end.......  ..... unless YOU try to pressure him into saying something he doesn't mean that you want to hear...unless you show him you don't like his answer, and you want to change it...unless you start having 'talks about us' and 'where this is going' and 'what he means'...unless you start feeling he should tell you he loves you when he doesn't want to go the married route again for a long damn time...it's not going to end unless you play these headgames with yourself and try to 'figure it out', when there is NOTHING to figure out....it's not going to end unless you drive him away because you want more than he can give...it's not going to end unless you start sulking because he didn't say the L word...and it's not going to end unless he feels like you are demanding that he love you and starting to push him into a corner.   He's fine.  He's answered with honesty and integrity.  What happens next, including if it 'ends'... is all on you."

I grew up with an alcoholic father and wouldn't put up with behaviour like that from my husband.   This women needs to really reflect on what she drank and the timeframe. For someone who doesn't drink that much to have 10 beers in the course of an evening (so what 4-5 hours) is a lot. Not being able to control your body is pretty significant and for it to be at a work function that's embarrassing. OP needs to have an honest conversation with her husband and be prepared to give up alcohol as he seems pretty set in his expectations of a partner."

Though if you notice this thread is heavily resting on the idea that alcohol is a problem for her.  Second I am seeing a load of bias towards alcohol even if that factor is disregarded.     Consider this  Woman says she does X, husband says he doesn't want her to do X again because of some past Y related to X from childhood.  Woman agrees, by later does X. Husband questions marriage.  I can give tons of X Y values that would result in the husband being chastised as an asshole.  Said it is silly.  Alcohol is not one of them.  Marijuana would find a split argument. ""Not having sex"" in any form of regularity would similarly result in a lot focusing on the husband's demanding of her being beyond proper.    Removing the bias and paying only attention to the demand made (he did not ask, he demanded) the typical result of a demand resulting in appeasing response, rather than argue, and then the repeated event, but one that is very uncommon and was done in a responsible manner up to as responsible as one can be (she didn't drive, chat up other men, blackout  and so on).  I only see it as the real problem her is that she agreed to a demand she didn't actually agree with, and that the husband is allowing a past trauma to affect his relationship with his wife, which in any other case you would find people telling him to seek therapy...  ""I was molested as a child by a babysitter. I feel uncomfortable having sex with my wife..."" Seek therapy, you can't expect your wife to be happy when you're not meeting her sexual needs/wants.

Is it any wonder people don't think this behavior is okay?"
relationship_advice,3d022k,beautifulmess7,12,Sun Jul 12 15:51:19 2015 UTC,"Jeez, it really depends where you work and/or live then, because at my company that wouldn't be anywhere near excessive, and nobody would cast aspersions because of it."
relationship_advice,3d022k,radient,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:07:51 2015 UTC,"Same here. I live in a country that has a huge binge drinking culture, no one bats an eyelid if you get sloppy at a work event. That being said, if I had promised my SO that I wouldn't do it, then that's that. Everyone else's rules or expectations become irrelevant."
relationship_advice,3d022k,penguindisco,5,Sun Jul 19 09:04:47 2015 UTC,"If you're there 5 or 6 hours, 1.5 to 2 drinks per hour is nothing and not binge drinking.  What the hell is up with this puritanism in the subreddit today, fuck man."
relationship_advice,3d022k,robeph,12,Sun Jul 12 17:55:17 2015 UTC,"Having 10 drinks at one party, a corporate one at that, is pretty much the definition of binge drinking. For women it's defined as 4 or more drinks.  Getting so drunk you have trouble standing is definitely within that realm. And what office party lasts for 6 hours?   I'm no puritan. I drink regularly. If not daily, then pretty close. My husband and I routinely have a bottle of wine a night between the two of us. Even on a heavy drinking night I don't have 10 drinks, though. She had almost an entire 12 pack by herself. At an office gathering. When she promised not to get hammered. That's pretty rough."

Drinking excessively is par for the course where I live, and in many other countries. My office Christmas party last year went from 6pm to after midnight.  The only factor that really needs to be addressed is the fact that OP broke a promise, not whatever expectations you personally have about how much people should drink and how they should behave in their corporate/social lives."

relationship_advice,3d022k,LondonChap86,8,Sun Jul 12 14:23:59 2015 UTC,"A few questions for you - does your husband hate drinking altogether or was it only what you consumed the two times you got drunk? What is the understanding on alcohol consumption between you two? Does he drink and if so, how much / has he ever gotten inebriated? How often do you drink and have their been any other problems with your drinking before?  It sounds odd that you'd promise to never get drunk again and odd he's questioning your entire marriage over these two instances. I feel like we might be missing some back story here; normally I'd say the fact you got drunk once two months ago and once now is a bit excessive, but there is clearly some underlying bit discord on this coupled with the tidbit about his dad being an alcoholic.  ""Different definitions of fun"" is something you two absolutely need to talk over. Assuming you aren't an alcoholic or on your way, his expectation of not ever ever getting drunk seems a bit outrageous. You two need to have an honest conversation on expectations and mutual agreement on excessive alcohol consumption. You shouldn't pay for his father's disease. The whole marriage shouldn't come into question over an infrequent night of partying too hard and if it is, there's a huge communication breakdown.  That being said, you need to examine your own words and actions. If you're going to promise ""never to get drunk again"", you need to be cautious with your actions and communicate with your husband if this is not actually an expectation you want to have to abide by or if you choose to directly break that expectation.  Additionally (and quite honestly) I'm not sure how you drank ten beers in the course of many hours and ""everything was fine"", ""you drank no more than others"", had no trouble speaking but had issues simply standing. Unless you drank this over a course of say 8-12 hours, that's a LOT. Usually folks who drink to the point where standing is a problem are the ones who are super wasted and hard to understand and don't interact well due to being wasted."

It's no different than your significant other asking you not to go to the strip club and get lap dances and you do.  Edit. She didnt respect his wishes. If she wanted to drink and not respect his wishes she should have told him instead of telling him that she wouldn't do it again.

If she tended to drive every time she got drunk or do other problematic things, this makes sense as the purpose of the request makes sense.    In this case she is an adult, he needs to grow up and realize his experience as a child with his father does not relate to her in any way except him making demands of her which he shouldn't be ."

Her husband is questioning their whole relationship over demands that he placed on her, based on his own shitty dad drinking.   Should she have promised not to do it again, and then got drunk? No. And she should apologise for that.   But they need to work together to manage his unreasonable expectations of her."

Eventually people have to realize that high school is over, and getting shitfaced is not cool, because you no longer have the ability to pawn it off as being young and naive. You are your own ambassador.   The OP's husband isn't telling her to stop drinking, he's telling her to stop getting so drunk, especially in front of her colleagues. Very different.  Not saying that getting really drunk can't happen as you get older, but a company party should certainly not be your choice spot. At this point everyone has been drinking for about a decade.

relationship_advice,3d022k,LondonChap86,6,Sun Jul 12 16:07:37 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter what anyone else at the party thinks is a crime or how drunk they were. It matters what you and your SO have talked about and how he feels about the situation. You promised two months ago that you would not get very drunk, cause it clearly upsets him and then you did it again. You know why it is an issue for him (and in my opinion, it is a valid reason) but still you decided to not really stick to the deal.  I don't think drinking is wrong, and you shouldn't stop altogether, and you're allowed to have a good night out and have some drinks. But you do sound like you're making excuses (long night, not drunker than anyone else, fully aware of things, etc..) which makes me think that you know you've been in the wrong.   When he says different definitions of fun, does that mean that you need that amount of alcohol to have fun? If not, you could tone it down a little? It'll make him happy and you still get to drink and have a good night out.   I would definitely apologize and try to keep the alcohol limited (switching with water used to do the trick for me.) You could also try some of those things like eating a big meal or some yeast before drinking or something. In that case if you do (unintentionally) drink a bit too much, you won't be as drunk or less visibly so (since it seems like the actual issue is not the drinking, but the you being drunk and reminding him of a bad past.)"
relationship_advice,3d022k,Fat_Raccoon,17,Sun Jul 12 14:57:51 2015 UTC,"There are a couple of dynamics going on here. First, the fact that you are unable to keep a promise to remain sober should scare the crap out of you. No, getting drunk is not a crime. Unable to control your alcohol intake? That's called addiction.  Codendency has its own set of things. Child of an alcoholic? Most likely.  So, the relationship ends up being completely about addiction and codependency. Want to fix the relationship? Fix the addiction and codependency. A good first stab might be AA for you and al anon for him if you ever become convinced you are addicted."
relationship_advice,3d022k,20150601,-4,Sun Jul 12 13:09:27 2015 UTC,"It sounds like she has control.  From all she includes in the story it sounds like she has experienced a couple of instances of substance abuse but otherwise maintains a proper level of use.  She said the party lasted hours.  It is very easy to consume 1 to two drinks an hour over a 5 to 6 hour period and get the ten drinks in.  She never said she gulped down 10 in the first 15m, which I'd be concerned with at that point."
relationship_advice,3d022k,robeph,6,Sun Jul 12 18:05:14 2015 UTC,"So, instead of being unable to keep the promise to remain sober, you believe she was in control and deliberately chose to break the promise and is just a lying sucky person. I disagree. But you're intitled to your opinion.  Edit: Removed extra words"
relationship_advice,3d022k,20150601,32,Mon Jul 13 00:23:46 2015 UTC,"i was fully aware of everything that was going on , but i was having a little trouble standing.   Having trouble standing is more than a little drunk.  It's reaching a state where you cannot take care of yourself, and it's obnoxious to the person who has to take care of you, which is your husband.     two months ago we went to another work party and i got too drunk and i promised him i wouldnt get so drunk again. but last night i thought it was okay.   Why would it be okay?  You'd promised you wouldn't, and then when you were around alcohol, your promise went out the window.  This is classic alcoholic behavior.   i didnt actually do anything wrong   Um, yes, you did ""actually do something wrong"".  You broke a promise to your husband.  That's a big deal.     but my husband has painful memories of his father who was an alcoholic.   Well, he's got some thinking to do, because it's look like he's attached himself to someone who has issues with alcohol.  You guys got married young, and it's likely he didn't know himself very well yet, or had learned to avoid people with addiction issues.  Here he is.  He's got some choices to make.     i normally have maybe 1 beer at night after work. sometimes i have a drink with dinner and this is never a problem.   Reconsider that it's never a problem.  If you have a problem with binge drinking, which it is clear you do, you should not be drinking alcohol daily.  You probably look forward to that after work drink.  Alcohol, in your mind, is how you feel better.  This is a dangerous pattern to be setting.  So, rather than ""never a problem"", it's more of a significant contributor to your dysfunctional relationship with alcohol.     i feel like a piece of shit. i am ashamed of my actions because it upset him...    No, you're not.  You are ashamed because you're being forced to confront your actions, rather than your preferred mode of brushing your choices aside as ""no big deal.""     even though i dont think anyone else at the party would consider just getting drunk a crime.   Ah, yes, the alcoholic rationalization.    I don't know where you work, but it is rare that getting so drunk that you can't stand at a work function will not damage your reputation.  Drinking at work parties is appropriate for people who have healthy relationships with alcohol, and who choose to stop at one or two drinks.  You do not have a healthy relationship with alcohol, because you cannot stop yourself at one or two drinks.  Instead, you keep going, throwing away promises you made to people who love you.  Your story is that of a person who has a problem with alcohol.  You need to face that and choose your next steps wisely, because your marriage is at stake (as it should be.)  And you need to want to change FOR YOU, with a hopeful side effect that it may strengthen your marriage and your husband's ability to trust you..    All it takes is stopping your defensive rationalizations and taking a good hard look at the impact of your choices.     i just dont know what to do. i hope he will forgive me. should i stop drinking altogether?   Yes.  Choose to prioritize your marriage over your dependency on alcohol.  Make a promise to yourself and to your husband, and keep it.  He will need to see action from you, because your verbal promises are empty and now he knows that.  Attend AA meetings and go cold turkey.  No more after work beer.  No more drinks with dinner.  If you attend a work function where drinks are present, drink club sodas.  You can't handle doing anything other than this and it is time to accept that.  After years of having changed your ways, perhaps, with your husband's agreement, you can start having a drink on a special occasion to see if you can handle it."
relationship_advice,3d022k,Chees_a_saurus,5,Sun Jul 12 15:01:55 2015 UTC,"Getting drunk where I'm from is a pretty normal thing, which normal people do all the time.  OP's husband is asking her to refrain from normal social behaviour. Why?  Because HE has a problem with it?  She isn't under any obligation to cater to his abnormal social standards.  If she wants to humour him and not get drunk, that's great.  If she doesn't, that's her prerogative.   You aren't a terrible person, OP.  Yes, you make a promise not to drink, which you broke... but in my books it isn't a fair thing to ask of you anyway."

A lot of people are giving you shit on here for drinking at a work party, but i know a lot of work places that wouldn't care or encourage you to get drunk at these events, cause they are fun. Only you know if your work is a place like this and if you were definitely the drunk girl at the party, or just another employee having fun.   But if wasn't that uptight of a party, i don't see anything you did wrong. Usually these stories are like i got drunk at a party and did x,y and z. But your story is just you got drunk and stumbled a bit? And your husband is questioning your marriage? Something else is going on here. I can see him being upset that you broke your promise, but most couple I know in their 20s don't have to avoid getting drunk to continue their marriage. Grow up."

It's like a switch goes off in her head that usually warns a person when they are getting too intoxicated. So she has to be very careful, and often uses me as a sounding board. I know that sounds horribly dependent, but it's better than having to stop drinking entirely. So she asks me, ""Can I have another drink? Is it too much?"" This works for us. I think you should try to find a system that works for you, because it sounds like you have a similar issue. Tell your husband not to be a dick about it though (questioning your marriage??

I completely get the comments here that say ""hey you didn't do anything crazy, he's overreacting"" - listen, I get it and you're kind of right. But when you grow up with an alcoholic parent shit like this just really gets to you. I get EXTREMELY uncomfortable around really drunk people (I do drink once in a while, myself, and the handful of times I've gotten really drunk, it really makes me feel like shit).   Sounds to me like your husband has: a) told you about his horrible experiences and painful memories of growing up with an alcoholic parent, b) had this experience with you before and expressed his discomfort and pain then, leading you to promise to not do it again and then now he's questioning why you would outright break a promise, perhaps even questioning whether you might have an alcohol problem (an inability to control your intake) and therefore questioning the marriage.   It may be overreacting to many, but if this was me, I'd do the exact same thing, just out of self-preservation. If your drunkenness causes him actual pain and suffering, it'd be in his best interest to remove himself from it."

But we can all have too many sometimes so if it was out of your character I wouldn't worry too much. The problem is that you made a promise not to get drunk anymore. Is this something you actually want to do? Is this a reasonable request? It's up to you. You should revisit the chat with your husband and see if you can come to an agreement together."
relationship_advice,3d022k,princessunicornfairy,2,Sun Jul 12 18:45:24 2015 UTC,"I hate it when my wife drinks too much but that's because she becomes an unbearable companion that I have to deal with. It's embarrassing and socially painful. However I would not threaten the basis of our marriage because of that. Also it's natural to feel down when your hungover. Give it a day or two and when you feel better carry on. Try not to get too wasted around him. Keep it to seven, not ten beers."

I mean, if I were him I would be alarmed that you are having 1-2 drinks every night. Now maybe that's a reasonable amount to drink, maybe it's not. But the son of an alcoholic is going to be a lot more sensitive to potential red flags than others. Then you got wasted twice in a month? At company events? After you promised you wouldn't? That would be a HUGE red flag for me. I'm only 23 but I consider myself past the age where its okay to get so drunk I can't stand. That's college level shit. I would be MORTIFIED if I got that drunk at a work event. Time to grow up and start drinking responsibly."

I totally get where you're coming from and you have a point but remember there are functioning alcoholics out there who are able to control their intake when they absolutely have to (such as on weekdays) and then get absolutely fucking shitfaced every weekend, are unable to control their intake to the point of hospitalisation / losing control of bodily functions, do horrible shit to their friends and family, get violent, belligerent and just outright crazy. As a person who grew up with that sort of alcoholic I just wanna throw that in here, since the belief that alcoholism must always involve binge drinking and inability to control once one drink is in their system is pretty widespread but not really 100% true. Not saying that OP is an alcoholic though, although breaking promises regarding drinking and an inability to control intake are red flags that personally I could not deal with in a relationship having grown up as a child of an alcoholic."

relationship_advice,3d022k,emk2203,3,Sun Jul 12 18:32:41 2015 UTC,"Addiction, not alcoholism alone, is denoted by a necessitated use.  Uses that include abuse (improper usage. Rx meds for example, taking two antianxiety meds instead of the one directed, or alcohol usage that exceeds amounts that are within a healthy bound, 1 to 2 drinks in a day.) are not necessarily indicative of addiction.  Addiction requires that the usage, even if not abuse in the dosage and usage quantifier, that the usage is one which effects negatively (not a individual effects but a state of regular outcomes from the usage) ones life, whether health, social, financial, or otherwise, as well as including the inability to distance oneself from such a negatively influencing usage, also called dependency.  Lastly dependency can is primarily psychological in addiction, physical dependency does not necessarily infer addiction as we see this commonly in proper usage of many drugs, benzodiazapines, opiates, antidepressants, and antiseizure meds.    Nothing the OP has suggested infers addiction.  She may be, but assuming that goes outside the facts we have and becomes a purely speculative assumption and not one that is likely from her given information.    Substance abuse is a problem if regularly occurring. This is often seen in college students with binge drinking, even though this is not necessarily an addiction as the improper usage is a result of a regular association and environment lending to such usage, while given he need the student could distance themselves from usages wih no psychological impact, beyond the assumed social impact.   In her case it appears she properly consumes alcohol regularly.  Not a problem. On occasion she enjoys the usage of alcohol beyond recommendation, the though improper it seems she does so in as responsible manner as could be. She does not drive, does not act on impulsive behaviors resulting in relationship trouble (sleeping around etc), she is not abusive, and she otherwise is just drunk.  She is acting in a manner that no one  would consider abnormal, even if occasionally in limited amounts, excessive.  Her husband's view is burdened by his past trauma.  This itself is a problem and she could consider being a bit more considerate of this, at the same time if such a minor line exists in their relationship due to this, I feel he would profit more from addressing the why he feels this way than the extreme request for his wife."

You can help him to realise that you're not like his father, you're not an alcoholic and that you want to have the freedom to occasionally drink a bit more than usual."

I've been in somewhat similar circumstances with my wife, she doesn't drink and I do. But I've kept the promises I've made regarding drinking.  But I didn't make the promises she asked for, I enjoyed drinking and intend to continue to enjoy drinking. She would like me to simply stop drinking completely, but I know that won't happen. However I did make promises about my behavior when I'm drinking... Like I'll stop at two with dinner when we go out, and I'll give up drinking completely if I ever become emotionally hostile or physically abusive while intoxicated.  Understand his fears and work to find something in the middle that you can both agree will work. Don't make promises you can't/won't keep. I'm guessing a lot of his issues with drinking revolve around broken trust, at least that always seems to be part of it. So stop breaking his trust, you're just making it worse."

So just to make this clear to you, your husband isn't rethinking your marriage because you got drunk. Your husband is rethinking your marriage because you got drunk as hell, after only two month prior promising not to, to a guy who's dad was a drunk and probably made the same promises and excuses (see select text above).  Now to the bolded part. It doesn't fucking matter that no one else thought you were overboard. You aren't married to any of them and you didn't make a promise not to do this to any of them.  You don't have to give up drinking. But if I were you, I would for at least the foreseeable future.  Your marriage is more important to you than the bottle. Right?"

Stop thinking about who is right and who is wrong and realize that your actions affect your husband. He may consciously understand that there is nothing wrong with a little bit of partying and drinking but it makes him uncomfortable nonetheless. If you take away all the details it boils down to you putting your desires ahead of your husband's feelings and your relationship.

Finally, the CDC's guidance on diagnosing a drinking problem is straightforward and immediately applicable here:   How do I know if I have a drinking problem?

Otherwise, I don't think the drinking is a problem except for the fact that you made a promise to your husband. I'm wondering how it is that you are married, and yet this incompatibility about views on drinking never came up?"

What makes you think ever getting close to the point of not being able to stand at a work function (party or not) would be okay? That shows a complete lack of judgement on your part. One drink an hour from now on, okay?  Your husband is having a bad reaction to you not only lying to him and yourself, but you are touching on a dangerous nerve to him that you know is difficult with him growing up with an alcoholic father. Ignoring the fact the ridiculous location you got drunk at, you still got drunk. Consider this: is that alcohol more important than your husband? Because it sure sounds to me like you're making it quite the priority. A beer every evening at 26 is pretty ridiculous. How about maybe only after an extremely rough day or only on the weekends as a first step of your reduction. Ideally you should reduce it to less often then that, to perhaps only to nights dedicated to being able to get slushed out on the town (so no work parties and get a cab, m'kay?). I don't blame your husband at all for being angry. I grew up with an alcoholic father and the last thing I would want is to grow old and have a family with an alcoholic. Both I and my future children deserve better!"

Not being able to stand properly is more than a little drunk.  Plus, being in denial of how drunk you are, and putting your alcohol above your husband and your workplace (you were 10 drinks deep at a company function)... you may have a few more alcohol problems than you'd care to admit.  I'll also give a +1 to all the people saying that getting drunk isn't necessarily the problem, the problem is that you broke a promise, and also forced your husband into a situation where he had to look after you because you were too drunk to stand.  I'm not gonna tell you how to drink your alcohol, but I think you should examine its influence in your life, and what influence you want it to have."

I think you're going to be more comfortable if you switch back to condoms for now. I wouldn't think of it as an if/then. No matter what her habits are, even if you guys had a big talk about the importance of taking the pill on time every time (which, yeah, I would find a bit patronizing myself...ugh, wouldn't you?) the fact is, you'd be living with some uncertainty about it, and the uncertainty doesn't work for you.  I'd think about bringing it up this way.  After giving the pill a try as a method, you've found it ain't totally working for you. Relying on the pill, it's stressing you out. It's a distraction during sex, whether you like it or not.  It's not about her personal behavior necessarily. No matter how responsible she is, it can be stressful to have such a high-stakes part of your life in someone else's hands. And so if condoms are something you're both comfortable with, you'd like to switch back to it for now.   Another thing you should keep in mind, of course, is that condoms aren't perfect either. Do you know what her feelings are about the morning after pill? That's important to know too in case of emergency.   The thing about pills is, even in the hands of the most like-clockwork person ever, they're not the strongest option on the market. Pills have sort of been the cultural norm in the US for various reasons, but from what I understand, in countries with cheaper access to IUDs and other methods, people are really starting to move away from making the Pill the go-to choice.

Please protect yourself and your girlfriend and remember you can make an appointment with a doctor to discuss birth control in its many forms just so you are as knowledgeable on the subject.

(They're also not 100% effective when they don't break, as we all hopefully know, just like the pill isn't 100% even with perfect use.) But the main advantage of a condom breaking over a pill being missed is that you know right away, where you don't with a pill. The not-knowing is a source of stress for OP.   If the condom breaks and she is OK with using Plan B, then that instant knowlege is useful information.

Probably because she met this guy at a bar and he was trying to fuck her.  If she met him like bowling or something it wouldn't feel so creepy. I guess this comes down to trust. Do you trust her? If you do let it go. You can also always do the spiteful thing and find a girl to hang out with. See her reaction.

Plus, I've tried talking to her about it and telling her that I know what goes on in most guys' heads. Those aren't feelings/thoughts that typically go away.   I do trust her, but it also bothers me to have my thoughts kind of discarded. She will listen and we'll talk about it, but like I said, she says it just goes around and around with no progress.  I know I shouldn't consider this anymore, but I went through a very similar situation with an ex: new friend -> good friend -> side dick -> replacement boyfriend.

It's very normal and healthy for people to look at porn/other people, and the fact that he is open about his interest in pornography is a very healthy trait, and is a good sign that he should be open about other aspects of his life with you.  Jealousy and insecurity are also normal, but if there's no indication that your partner is cheating on you, or that he's losing interest in you, then there's no need to worry about it.

relationship_advice,3d332y,13goingon30,0,Mon Jul 13 05:11:29 2015 UTC,"This is completely normal. The fact that he's being honest is a great thing. The worst thing you can do is make him feel bad for doing this or forbid him to look because that's just going to make him do it more. I think what attracts him is not necessarily how attractive these women are but how confident they are to post something so bold. I would work on your confidence so that you feel better. Think about all the guys that look at you and you don't even know it. If he wants to cheat, he's going to cheat but don't push him towards that by being jealous and controlling."
relationship_advice,3d180o,crispyfresh21,17,Sun Jul 12 18:00:14 2015 UTC,"At the risk of being too reductionist ...  It sounds like he's just not the type of guy you're interested in romantically or sexually anymore. He's gained a lot of weight, doesn't have a lot of professional aspirations, doesn't seem to do much else with his life.  Honestly, I think you've just outgrown the relationship. I'd venture a guess that you want someone who seems headed toward some sort of bright future. Someone with career aspirations and the makings of a good husband/father. A pot-head couch-potato just doesn't satisfy those criteria.  Sure, the SSRIs might be suppressing your sexual libido, but it doesn't sound like you're completely asexual. It sounds like your boyfriend in particular just isn't attractive to you anymore.  There's nothing wrong with admitting that he's no longer the person you want to be with. You're still a young adult, and you're learning what you do and don't want."
relationship_advice,3d180o,Lapland_Lapin,3,Sun Jul 12 20:09:01 2015 UTC,"This is a good point, OP. Maybe his long-term goals aren't coming together with your own. Believe it or not, in my experience, I find that similar, or even just exciting, aspirations kind of add to sexual energy, like being on the ""same page"" basically.  It isn't always about looks.   Address his unhealthy habits and see if he wants to get more physically active. Mention that you don't necessarily care about him smoking pot, but you feel like it's affecting his lifestyle and affecting the way you see him. If you are upfront with him about it, maybe he'll see that he is being a lazy-butt and needs to ramp it up a little.  If he's willing to change his lifestyle, he might start being more active in general after seeing the benefits of maintaining his physical fitness.   And if not - then hey, he isn't for you."
relationship_advice,3d180o,saladthrowawayy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:23:56 2015 UTC,"I came here to say exactly this. OP, heed this advice or at least really consider if the type of person your Bf is is the type of person you really love and want to be with or if he is the type of person you USED to love and want to be wit but you've outgrown it."
relationship_advice,3d180o,rusty_blumpkin,3,Mon Jul 13 02:41:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe his lethargy is making him seem less attractive to you. I mean, I'm on SSRIs and have problems with my ovaries, so I know the frustration of having a low libido. I do find my boyfriend quite attractive though, so I know when I have energy, I fondle him and try to initiate sex - but he understands when some times I'm just not in the mood.   I think maybe you two should start working out together. Maybe seeing him try to take better care of his body will spark something with you, and you won't feel so distracted by the idea of threesomes or whatever. I think it's natural/normal to be attracted to other people than your partner while in a relationship, but you also have to acknowledge how attracted you are to your partner.   Again, I think addressing his behavior and seeing if he's willing to make some changes along with you might help spark that flame. You seem to really love him."
relationship_advice,3d180o,saladthrowawayy,3,Sun Jul 12 18:48:46 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar situation. I loved him and wanted to get married but I had such a low libido due to my birth control that I never wanted to have sex with him. I ended up going off of birth control and moving to a different state, therefore breaking up. I found that I wasn't sexually attracted to him anymore once I started meeting other guys. My sex drive is a lot higher now that I'm off of birth control and I'm dating the most attractive guy ever and we have sex at least every day. I don't have advice, but if you find other men attractive, then maybe my story might be of use."
relationship_advice,3d180o,miss_engineer,4,Sun Jul 12 21:19:27 2015 UTC,Why are you dating someone you aren't attracted to? That seems really selfish and unfair. Not only are you not sexually compatible but you aren't even attracted to him. Leave him for his own good. Imagine being in his shoes.
relationship_advice,3d180o,ApricoteGinger,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:28:11 2015 UTC,"While I completely see where you are coming from, he and I used to be very sexually compatible for the first 2 years of our relationship. It wasn't until I started taking the SSRI's that things got weird and then he gained a lot of weight -- and well, we're in a long term relationship.   The question then becomes -- ""How do we get back on sync sexually?""  Maybe that should have been my title"
relationship_advice,3d180o,saladthrowawayy,6,Sun Jul 12 18:41:44 2015 UTC,"I think you should really encourage him to lose some weight. When people let themselves go, they do run the risk of their partners finding them less attractive - it's just how our brains work.   But I think if you encourage him to lose weight, work out together, maybe get high and go hiking(because that shit is just so fun), your old feelings of attraction for him will come back because you'll be seeing all the things that made you fall for him in the first place."
relationship_advice,3d180o,ApricoteGinger,2,Sun Jul 12 19:08:49 2015 UTC,"Seems pretty obvious but people tend to make excuses.   Get off SSRI, weening with the help of a professional.  Get on a non hormonal bc Let him know his weight is causing you to feel unattractive to him.  Exercise, eat right, get good sleep, cut down on depressants like alcohol and drugs.   You are young and it is very possible you outgrew each other. It happens all the time. Your 20'd are a time of constant change. You seem to have a lot of issues and need professional help. I'd focus my energies there first. Not everyone is healthy enough for a serious long term relationship, and trying to maintain one when you aren't mentally healthy is kind of impossible sometimes.  5."

Maybe you could ask your GP if theres anything that will help with that?   I also think you need to relax and stop putting pressure on yourself to have sex. That will only make you feel worse.   Swinging seems a bit drastic, maybe try find a new kink or fetish you can explore?"
relationship_advice,3d180o,saladthrowawayy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:25:52 2015 UTC,I also think you need to relax and stop putting pressure on yourself to have sex. That will only make you feel worse.   Not to mention that any pressure or stress you put on yourself can affect your libido or diminish any enjoyment you get from sex. It is normal to go through dry spells with intimacy when you've been together a long time.

You didn't mention if he initiated sex or if he finds you attractive, but it sounds like your sex life is dead. Guy just wants to smoke weed and live in nature, doesn't need to have his gf not having sex with him and secretly hating him for it.

relationship_advice,3d2ydc,InvalidKoalas,5,Mon Jul 13 02:41:54 2015 UTC,"Hi! The honeymoon phase is awesome. Everything is new and sweet and you always have a story to talk about. However, there will be a point where the honeymoon phase ends. Not everything is new anymore. She can't tell you her favorite color twice, because you already know it. You can't tell her how much you love to do that one thing that you love, because she already knows.    This just means your relationship is growing. You're ready to become something different. You're young right now, so this might not be fore you. You have to realize that you are falling in to the relationship where you are simply comfortable with one another. Seeing each other daily becomes a regular thing. Instead of being excited and pumped to see them, it becomes a ""it feels good to be home"" feeling."
relationship_advice,3d2ydc,stormynightss,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:23:02 2015 UTC,"For me, the ""past the honeymoon"" stage is always  hard since sometimes it's the ""make it or break it"".    My advice is to compromise and work together on fixing the relationship. Sit down and have a heart felt conversation with your partner.  For me,  the best places to talk about the relationship is in a neutral place. In other words, don't have the conversation at her place or your place.  My ideal spots to talk about the relationship is at a park or a restaurant.      What helped me prior to the conversation, would be to list down the things that bothered me.  This helped organize all my thoughts and analyzed what's may be wrong with  the relationship.  It also helps with forming what you need to say since with this type of conversations, things will be emotional and sometimes things might be misunderstood.      In the conversation, I like to say "" I feel that.... (Insert feelings) "" besides "" You're always doing this or that "". Also, always be open for feedback "" What can I do to make you happier? ""  Things will get better as long as each person in the relationship makes the effort.   Although, going 'past the honeymoon"" is the worst feeling, after the phase is great because the relationship feels stronger and solidified.  It's truly these phases that makes a couple stronger.   How to liven it up and stay strong?  I think that's something that will come to you and your partner organically once the phase is over.  It's best not to think about it and just let it happen.  Focus on fixing the relationship.   Hope this helps, good luck, and remember no matter what happens you'll be fine.  Remember to take care of yourself because at the end of the day, your happiness is most important."

I've only had three real relationships but each lasted a few years. And they're a genuine friend too. So we kind of connect well. I'm single currently. My last ended due to distance issues but again that lasted several years. There's times when it's not exciting because life, work, etc. but eventually you realize this and make special time to do stuff together that's exciting. I think a lot of it is just immaturity.

Ask her if this makes any sense for her to go off with a 40+ yo customer who flashes his money and lifestyle to be alone with her for a weekend. It's a F date. Let's be honest. She cancels and gets a clue or you break up. It's that simple.

I tell my younger sons find a woman who's in her 30's 40's alimony and child support coming in from the ex(s), just wants to have fun and won't pressure you into children and marriage like the young ones do until it's game over for you, the threat of jail time if you can't pay your child support.

Get her out of your place, delete her number from your phone, unfriend her on Facebook, everything. Start working out. Hang out with friends more than you used to, and if she's a major part of your social circle, begin making new friends.   You're gonna be hurting for a long time, but you can work through this.

Obvious what was going on, no?   i begged for her to come home...   First mistake.   i just followed her like a lost puppy    Second mistake.   ...that everything the past 2 years has been shit, that ive been shit, that I hold her back and am not the fun spontaneous person she says she fell in love with.

This is a lousy situation you're in.  If you were to pretend that it was a buddy of yours going through all of this with his girlfriend, what advice would you tell them? Would you tell your friend she just doesn't love you anymore? If you were to look impassionately at her reactions and what she's doing could you not conclude that she's cheating on you and is in fact a terrible person that you should not be with?   Have I overstepped my bounderies? should I have given her more space? Am I crazy to want to believe that nothing is going on between my friend and my girlfriend? I dont know what to do my world is falling appart.   You haven't overstepped your boundaries. Indeed you should give her all the space in the world – by breaking up with her. You're not crazy for wanting to believe. It's a perfectly natural reaction when faced with such a horrible truth.  At this point in time you feel that your world is coming apart.

It feels like you're just guessing and sounding out how to spell every word as you write it because you haven't been able to memorize the accepted spelling. If you have a learning delay like dyslexia or something similar, adulthood is not too late to get help with it, and you will really have a much easier time in any career you choose to pursue if you learn to use the tools available for free online to check your spelling and write intelligibly. Dyslexia is very common, nothing to be embarrassed about, and in fact correlates with a lot of gifted traits like high creativity.  Regarding your girlfriend, I'll tell you the same thing I tell every guy who asks this question: Your choices are to get over it or to let her go to someone who won't hold a completely normal past against her. You are the one who has a problem here, not her, so don't make it her issue. If she wanted to be with them now, she would be. She's a grown woman and knows her options."

I'm not exactly sure what the question is. If she does not want to talk or meet with her exes, she should tell them so and forget about it. If you are upset about her having exes, you are going to have work to get over it. People have baggage; we all have a past that affects who we are. Living well is the best revenge. You two should just keep getting to know each other. If you trust her, then trust her and stop worrying about them.  I'm not sure how your culture works but in mine, if you were to ask my parents for a sleepover for me at 18, you'd be barred from the house pretty quickly.

If you like her and want something to come if it then you should bring up your feelings to her. Don't make it a big thing, just be honest with her, hear what she has to say and then decide if it's what you want. Maybe she just needs time but it's best to get your feelings out in the open asap.

Are the two of you close emotionally? Confide in eachother, know eachother incredibly well, etc? You lay out your current relationship such that the two of you sound like romantic partners who lack a sex life.  If you would like to take the relationship to a sexual level, you'll have to escape the friendzone (believe or not, that's where you are as of right now).   You'll have to have a conversation about it sooner or later, since the two of you sound very close. Maybe she enjoys the emotional/social bond you both share, but just doesn't find you sexually attractive, or she forsees a better mate coming along and doesn't want to be tied down if/when it happens.   If your emotional closeness is on the level of a romantic couple, then a serious, mature conversation about getting down to business may be in order. I don't know if either of you want a long-term relationship, or what either of your ideal relationships would look like, but maybe the two of you could find something that would make you both happy.  Or she's just not that into you and you'll be just friends for the rest of time."
relationship_advice,3d0go8,VinWeasel94,7,Sun Jul 12 13:39:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know about salvaging things with the current gf.    Keep in mind she's 19 and if her previous relationships were with flaky guys, she might be trained to think that female friends are actually ""more"".  I know that I struggled with the concept of purely platonic relationships until I had one for myself (around early 22 years old).  Going forward with this, I've seen it work out best with my friends' marriages and relationships when there's an attempt to have this platonic friend meet and be present around both of you.  This isn't about permission or your gf and pf (platonic friend) being besties.  It's about association.  When your gf thinks about your pf, what comes to mind?  If there are positive memories where your gf can see you acting in a respectful and platonic way with pf, then she's probably less likely to be suspicious about little things like ""I love you"" or one on one contact."

Especially if you tell your friends you love them. That is something that is going to raise questions from any partner you will ever have. However, it was wrong of your gf to snoop on your phone, and it was wrong of her from preventing your from seeing your platonic friend and assuming you were cheating with her.  Now you have to decide if you are going to try and save your relationship with her (which I think is most definitely possible) or if you're going to move on. I think this is a good test of your relationship and I would do your best to help her understand that you are not cheating. If she is being completely close minded when you talk to her, then it shows she is too immature and I would move on. Some people have posted good suggestions in this thread about how you could go about fixing this, I would suggest maybe getting your friend and gf together and having them talk? Idk that might go terribly, who knows. You could also try to sit down and have a meaningful talk with her and explain that you aren't cheating, but she might not believe you. If she doesn't trust you, maybe that's another sign that this relationship isn't working out, because trust is the foundation to any solid relationship. Either way, good luck and I hope this helps"

As someone who has been unemployed for a significant amount of time in the past, telling him he plays too much league of Legends or that you think he is addicted to constant stimulation will not solve anything. For all you know this is a mask for a much bigger issue (anxiety, depression etc.), and if that's the case he needs to deal with that on his own terms. If there is something bigger going on here you siting him down to tell him how much he's wasting his life will in no way motivate him to change, it may make it worse.

Keep talking to your ex and see where it leads--but don't hang on her every word.

But you also need to be decent to your current girlfriend, and level with her before you do anything with your ex.   Ultimately, it sounds like you have unresolved feelings toward your ex, and I think that for your own sanity you should be honest with your ex and tell her that you want to explore these feelings with her.

I'd probably also say you feel as though you're not in the right place for a relationship right now and that you're very sorry if she felt misled. That's a pretty good generic way to do it.

You don't own the rights to keep him as an exclusive friend for ever and ever. You are all adults which means your friends are going to be change all the time and you're developing new interests and responsibilities. So what if he has had a long day and doesn't want to hangout, or wants to study alone or does in fact have something else better to do? Of course he only hangs out when he wants to or when it's convenient. Why on earth would you spend time with someone when you don't want to?

He's expanded his social circle and hangs out with other people.  You said yourself that he doesn't treat you any different when hanging out -- your only objection is the frequency.     I would value your opinion on this. Do you think that Jay's behavior is rude/uncalled for?    While it isn't abnormal to be a bit hurt at the lack of closeness, calling him ""rude"" because of it strikes me as a bit too self-centered and childish.    He doesn't owe you any explanation.

You are still a kid yourself but you're acting the way a 6 year old reacts when they find out. Another sibling in your life might be something you can choose but the way you look at it is.

relationship_advice,3d2w8w,stormynightss,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:03:11 2015 UTC,"Hello friend. I want you to know that my father and his little brother are 13 years apart. It is three years smaller than your age difference, but my dad is now 46. That makes his brother 33. They live in different countries, but they talk all the time. His younger brother stayed with their parents until he was ready to come of age just like with other kids. The important thing is not to let the difference get to you. They are your siblings no matter what.    My boyfriend is 19 now and his little sister is 3 years old. They are half siblings and he loves her more than anything in the world. He is at college right now, so it's a little harder for them to communicate, but he makes sure to see her once a week at least. She loves him and they have a fantastic relationship. His little sister will remain with their mother until she comes of age.    If there comes a stage where you have to step up to the plate when your parents get a little older, then I hope you're going to be okay with that. Siblings love each other. Siblings take care of each other. Hopefully up to that point, your mother and father will be able to take care of them, but I hope that at that point, you are doing well enough to help out. If you are not, they are your siblings. They will understand their own situations.    Life has a funny way of working itself out. For now, love your siblings. Build a relationship as best you can."
relationship_advice,3d23v2,zeldafan25,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:19:32 2015 UTC,"Sorry you're going through this, OP. Trying to ""act less insecure"" is like ""don't think of an elelphant!""   I'm wondering what kind of insecurity you mean in this case. Is it not feeling secure about yourself, not feeling confident in your abilities or your awesomeness? Or is it insecurity about your relationship--not feeling confident about his faithfulness or his interest?   BTW, he doesn't sound like a real charmer so far so he's on thin ice with me. :)"
relationship_advice,3d23v2,agavebee,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:55:15 2015 UTC,"I'm insecure about myself in general, and I have insecurity about romantic relationships.  I haven't had any worries that he is unfaithful or anything, it's more so that I feel like I am easily disposable, and I wait for him to get tired of me and leave me."
relationship_advice,3d23v2,randombanananleaf,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:02:18 2015 UTC,"Insecurity in relationships is something I really really struggle with as well OP. Although it's not up to your partner to solve the problem for you (and, indeed, at the end of the day, no matter what they do your insecurities will always find a way to question them - so even if they wanted to, they can't fix you either), I do find that having a partner who understands really does help. Kudos to your bf for being honest, but I think he could have phrased it in a better and more supportive way.  That aside, there are several things you can do. Therapy is one, depending on where you are and how easily accessible it is. Personally this didn't help me, but has helped a lot of people in your position. Finding the right therapist can be a challenge, but the earlier you start, the better it is.  The thing I find most helpful is doing things. And yes, when you're feeling shit and insecure and lacking confidence, going out and doing stuff is the last thing you want to do. But seriously. It has a 2-fold effect: Firstly, it keeps you busy so your brain has less time to focus on the things that trigger your insecurity (it also keeps you busy so you're not hanging around waiting for your bf to get in contact with you); and secondly, if you're doing something productive (whether it be a sport, art class, charity work or a job - whatever it is!), that will help boost your self esteem. Because insecurities arise when you don't feel 'good enough' - you lack self confidence. Tackling that will help you feel more secure. And if you get a new hobby, or develop an old one, that can really help because you'll start feeling more successful and that feeds into other areas of your life (i.e. self confidence in relationships).  So my suggestion would be to start small - maybe have 1 or 2 evenings/days a week which are dedicated to this hobby. Make yourself do it. In some ways that can be the hardest part. Also, if possible, (and yea, I know it can be a drag) try to have a hobby that involves others. Sports or charity work or something. Because then you're socialising with people who aren't your bf, which will help as well.   NB: charity work is great for yourself. It's amazing how good it makes you feel."
relationship_advice,3d2rpr,spacewaitresss,7,Mon Jul 13 01:43:18 2015 UTC,I think the time has past for not hurting him...  it's better to do it now and get it over with but there will be lots of questions and this is where you might be able to make up on some of the hurt feelings.

There is not a good day in his calendar in the next two weeks, there is no way not to hurt his feelings... you realize, oh yeah, that means I can do it tonight.

It's great that you appreciate his good qualities.   However, I'll say flatly that 31 and 22 is a pretty big age difference. The fact that he's been giving you expensive gifts with this frequency, this early into a relationship sounds like they come partly out of an agenda that's not all about what's in your best interest. It sounds a bit like he's trying to lock you into something that he shouldn't feel at all rushed about himself. The fact that he ""stoops"" to hang out in dive bars you like isn't because dive bars are bad, it just reflects the fact that you guys aren't on the same page."

Some people have a really hard time about talking in person about wanting to step away so that's why she is avoiding the talk. She is going with the ""If I ignore him, he will stop trying"" strategy. I think you should step away for a while as well."

relationship_advice,3d1e5v,iMrDot,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:48:46 2015 UTC,"My boyfriend and I met on Twitter. He was a mutual friend of a girl I went to high school with, and he followed me first. I followed back, and we played the same game as you. Favoriting and mentioning each other until he asked for (at this time) my BBM pin. From there, we chatted on BBM and got to know each other and began dating not long after. Three and a half years later, I couldn't be happier.   The point of my story is that I think she's interested but is too shy or believes that the man should make the first move and that it worked for my relationship. And if you do DM her and she's not interested, no harm no foul. But you never know unless you make a move because she may never! Just DM her and ask about her day or something, don't come off too strong to begin with obviously, and you should be good to go! Good luck :)"

I mean, I get that she cheated and it sucks ass to pay her phone bill, but I think it would be wise to keep her line connected just so that she can text him (him being OP). Texts are proof of what's been said. Then when they go to court and deal with custody, potential alimony, etc. etc. he can pull out a record of the things she's said to help make his case. Cut off whatever else you want, but leave the dang phone line."

I have no doubt I will get back on the horse and ride again. I just need some time from having my heart ripped out.

But you think everyone is stupid and will buy your bullshit, but you can't be honest with what you're doing because it just ""sounds"" like you're a cunt but really you're just misunderstood.  At this moment you can't believe anything that's coming out of her mouth. It's all a lie. She will rationalize treating you like garbage because she didn't get what she wanted in the relationship and didn't have the courage to break up with you.

Keep records of how much was in there and of what goes on going forward. Also, get a checkbook. If she needs money for your daughter, write a check. There may be digital means of doing this, but I am not aware of how well they hold up in court as proof you gave the money.   Friend of mine had his accounts drained by the ex, but they were still married, so the judge told him there was nothing he could do. Make sure to destroy any checks of current accounts. Also, alert the back to possible fraud on the account. I have had other friends pay thousands in the run up to the divorce, only for the judge to not count the money as going towards the child, because the ex lied.   Going forward, keep track of every penny, and do not try to hide anything from the court."

Why? Because if she wants to take you to court over child custody, letting her to live in your house while trying to reconsider things would've helped your cas. However, this is only an opinion.  On the other hand, if your really consider yourself a good father, make your child a priority, talk to a lawyer and don't let her take your kid away. Being a weekend parent sucks and, as I see from your previous post, you love her a lot, then don't let a person whom you loved, take away your chance of having a fulfilling life."

Find out for sure how this would play out in a divorce. Divorce happens 6 in 10 marriage anyway.  So it's just a matter of time.  The odds are against you.  Maybe she's just suffering from post pardom depression.  Maybe she's just stressed out over the rape case.  It takes two to argue so just let her vent on you and realize you're kind of screwed by being married to her.  When handed lemons make lemonade.  And of course in the back of my mind I'm thinking, hmmm, you work 3rd shift and she got pregnant (rape?) by an old friend.  Hmmm. Ok.  I'd want to know what the circumstances are if I were you.

She flirted so much with me, told her friend to tell me I was sexy, bought me drinks, and held my hand when I walked her home. It was only then that she told me she had a bf who was gone that weekend. If she hadn't waited until I was 9 drinks in and on her doorstep to tell me, I know I would've acted differently. Not trying to take the blame off me, but several of my female friends told me that I shouldn't feel so bad about it (citing that girls shouldn't be treated like they're helpless from acting in these situations)."
relationship_advice,3d14lo,Cliffy73,0,Mon Jul 13 00:02:46 2015 UTC,Some day you will be the guy whose girl is out making out with one of your buddies.  As they say all is fair in love and war. So long as you're cool with it and don't try to beat up your buddy.  No sense in hurting him and ending up having to pay a lawyer to get you out of jail.  This is why you can't get emotionally and financially invested in a relationship.  People cheat.  Never marry.  It's job security for divorce lawyers.
relationship_advice,3d0zr7,mechrock,2,Sun Jul 12 16:51:53 2015 UTC,I think you should go for it. You're pretty young so there's a good chance she won't be the one you'll spend the rest of your life with considering the Diabetic thing that freaks you out a little.

Don't get married and don't have children in the USA.  Do you know how many men are sitting in jail for not paying child support on kids not their own let alone his own?

But, we wanted to wait for her to finish school due to some internal conflicts with her parents not uh ""accepting"" white foreigners. Yay racism lol  But, yeah.. Guess I should also add to the dialogue up there that shes been in other relationships. But, nothing as long term as this and lived a very sheltered life. She has ""crazy"" Indian parents which lends a bit to her actions I think."
relationship_advice,3czvlh,jtwh4000,18,Sun Jul 12 08:18:54 2015 UTC,No. Best you cut this off now while you're not even married yet. If she can do this to you now what makes you think she'll change once she's married to you? A ring isn't going to magically change someone.
relationship_advice,3czvlh,jtwh4000,-6,Sun Jul 12 08:42:46 2015 UTC,Never said it would. Was just explaining in case someone figured oh hey why would you be with some for so long if you weren't going to commit type thing.

Also kind of been in this relationship with the marriage midset and it's not that I don't believe in divorce. But, I think people should work d**n hard to keep a relationship together before they split.

Silly to have two netflix, hulu, amazon prime accounts since you can stream on multiple devices and groceries because well... I like buying women things? I mean it's the proper thing to do isn't it? Well till they stab you in the back anyway.  The cable well were close enough that with my IT skills and desire to have my own cable box/router and not Comcast crap. She can sorta use my wifi to log in. Get's horrible signal IMO but usable for non gaming or HD netflix streaming.

I mean d*mn I'm a sucker and fall quick when I was dating back in the day but really? That fast? Do you really feel like showing her what it was like before wouldn't help?  We haven't been doing as much lately since she was so busy at her first uh ""block"" of classes this semester. She has a different class every month and this month is pretty lax. So I was thinking now that she has free time we could do some things together. Kind of remind her in case she forgot type thing. I think she kind of takes some things for granted since I've pretty much always given her whatever she wants. IE: First or second Christmas together can't even remember I bought her a new laptop since the one her parents gave her was half dead or when are in a store and she wants something I buy it for her.

Then go no-contact and quietly cut off everything you pay for.   Though I worry that would just make her resent me more   So fucking what? More than you resent her? I doubt it.

The probability of him being some rich Tony Stark playboy is highly unlikely. So I doubt he will pay for anything. But, either way yeah I guess you/everyone else is right. Like I said before I was hoping I was being crazy and there was some way to salvage this. =/   And when it's all said and done I still care for her and I hate to see her get taken advantage of. She's incredibly ""book smart"" 24 y/o speaks  3 languages understands another 2 and is working on learning another. Has 2 undergrad degrees and is one year away from finishing her PhD.

I digress the point is like I mentioned in another reply  just now. I'm pretty sure the dude just sees her as a green card.   I mean sure if you prescribe to love at first sight sure one person. But, both people are madly in love with each other after 5 days and a week or two of texting. What is this a Disney movie? Something sounds fishy to me that's all I'll say and leave it at that. I'll cut her off completely once it's all said and done.  EDIT: Also let me add according to her he knows about me and I quote from him to her ""I respect that your in a relationship and I don't wan't to make you change your mind about him"" What a load of crock if you ask me.

Just listen to him at this point and then ask for some time to think about it. don't leave him hanging for months on end, but do take at least a week to figure out your emotions and how you feel about what he said.  you're frustrated right now so don't make any rash decisions"
relationship_advice,3d089q,orphan26,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:56:10 2015 UTC,You didn't mention his age so I'm guessing you're about the same age. Normally when there's a break up I say never go back. Once you get past the healing phase it would be difficult to allow that person the ability to potentially hurt you again. In this case two months isn't a lot tbh. If it was six months or a year I'd say no. Two months and he probably realized what he gave up. He learned a lesson. And he didn't take a year of dating everyone in town to achieve it. Unless you had a bad relationship I'd give it another shot. Just my two cents though. Others may have a different point of view.

Not now, and not when she starts having babies.  I don't know where you are but in the US, 5 kids from 3 baby daddies is becoming all the rage.  A girl gets a child support check from each one of them.  One can't pay? He goes to jail and the others keep on paying.  You just can't get emotionally invested in any relationship.

""i saw a nude pic of her , we get into a fight he says she is just crazy "" um okay what? you're together for a year, you are living together, and okay you're not a jelous type. but it seems to me, you're not okay with him having nude pictures of other on his phone so you don't have that kind of open relationship; so why didn't he tell you about it and why did he keep it, if you are in a loving relationship you should be able to communicate everything; also if they are such good friends, why is he calling her crazy? i had one similar expririence once, with my ex  - we were fooling around with his phone and accidentally i saw some texts from his ex, whom he didnt have a nice opinion of, and he just grabed his phone and panickly deleted everything, and we fought and i cried and it was awful and he never really explained that, so i could never really let it go, and there we're always some moments with this ex of his, that made me feel uncomfortable, even tho i met her and i really like her, and we had disscusions about her and all that...it just, something was there that made me feel uncomfortable and before that i always tought i wasn't a jealous type...so if you can really forgive and feel good about this and let it go okay. i couldn't.  ""him teling her things would be diffrent if that happend a few months back (before we started dating)"" well from this it seems to me, that she is not just a friend to him, and that like he has some regret, but thats just one person's opinion, but you should probably disscus this with him. Another red flag for relationship - it is about trust right? so if you feel the need to violate his privcy rather than having a feeling that you can talk to him about it, not a good thing and everyone deserves better. And if things he says to her aren't true and he doesn't mean it, why does he say them anyway? so he is lying to her, does that make him any better? Anyway, sounds like you really care for him and that you are feeling really horrible right now, so i really hope this comment doesnt make stuff even worse for you, i'm just venting out my opinions, as i made my hard decision not that long ago; even tho i know my ex never cheated on me, i never really trusted him and i was always afraid that someday it may happen; and you shouldn't be afraid and sad and in doubts about the person you are with right? You should smile and be happy and all the good things and everyone deserves like this really good relationship(s)!"

In other words, when he is 25 is he still dating girls this age or are they constantly 4-5 years younger than him (at this point they would be 20-21). This seems reasonable.

relationship_advice,3cyzp9,calamityjo,10,Sun Jul 12 06:21:01 2015 UTC,"Problem solved thanks guys for the help.   Uh, what? No, this actually means you have a pretty big problem. With her, not you. Seeing a text to your mom and immediately jumping to the conclusion that it's a contact for another girl and you're cheating on her is NOT a normal reaction.  This is a pretty big red flag, and I guarantee this won't be the last time you'll have an argument like this. She'll have you on a leash before you know it.  I mean, think about it - you didn't know what her problem was, but you already assumed it was because of an innocent text you sent to another girl. I guess this isn't the first time she has been pissy at you for just having a small chat with a girl? This is extremely unhealthy and will drag you down very fast at some point.  A normal relationship shouldn't have you afraid of having conversations with other girls."

I don't ask a girl out normally. Girls hardly make the first move with guys and especially with me. But I can say every girl I've gone out with has asked me out and each time it's become something that lasted a couple years. If you leave your number while at bar or club some guys just think it's a pick up or you may do it all the time. In your situation, a very normal situation, most guys will just be flattered. Worst case scenario he doesn't text you. But then who cares right? No hurt feelings then. There's very little risk by just leaving a simple nite an number and by reminding him who you are you're telling him indirectly that it's not a pickup. Because he actually stood out and made a good impression. That's why you remember so much. Also I can tell you most guys don't ask a girl out while working if they care about their job. He might of got the signals wrong and then you or one of your parents may complain. Plus he'd be embarrassed. All the focus on your table I don't believe was just to juice up the tip at he end of dinner. All he has to do is be polite because it's a numbers game. Handle enough tables promptly and be polite and he'll get a decent tip. I think the vibe you think you were getting is correct. Go for it. And thank you for being a girl who doesn't just wait for some random guy to make the first move. I love that. :0)"

relationship_advice,3cz47d,Taroe,8,Sun Jul 12 02:27:59 2015 UTC,"I think you need to talk to your manager again and explain your concerns. It's really unfair that this person that was supposed to watch you do the protocol was directly undermining your training by telling you the steps. This person was literally setting you back in training.   Because the vibe in the office is casual, joking comraderie, you tried handling your concerns this way, directly with the person, before going to management. You didn't mean to offend, but your job is on the line. Then ask your manager how you should handle someone infringing on your training in the future.    This shows that you care about your job, you tried to address the situation on your own and you're willing to correct mistakes.   Though, I don't think you made a mistake. I may not have said anything the first day they overstepped either, but the next day I would have said ""I won't pass if I don't do this myself, right?"" to the one training me. If they didn't stop, I would have played dumb to the manager, saying the same thing. When she answered with no, I would say ""well I'm confused because whatsherface keeps walking me through the steps even though I know them and am not asking for help and I'm worried this will make me fail the protocol.""   Sorry, my long-winded point is that being nice and liked in your office is great, but you need to advocate for and stand up for yourself in a respectful manner as well."
relationship_advice,3cz47d,sparklefades,2,Sun Jul 12 06:43:58 2015 UTC,"Adjusting to life in an office environment is tough. It can take a while to feel out the politics of the place. It sounds like your boss didn't reprimand you very harshly. Most people understand it takes a while for a new employee to learn the ropes. Just look at this as a teachable moment.   When performing work related functions, like the training you were undergoing, take your cues for the tenor of your conversation from the superior you're interacting with. You may joke in conversation about non-work topics, but this setting is more serious. Some people also may not participate as fully in this casual corporate culture than the rest of the staff, that's okay, just respect it. The best way to say what you wanted to say probably would have been something like ""You've been really helpful training me, and I feel like I've got this down. I'd like to try it without instruction like I'll have to when this is over. Is that cool?""   If you still feel bad about offending this person, just apologize. They will either appreciate the apology and respect you, or act like they don't know what you're talking about. But something like, ""Sorry if I offended you the other day. I'm still adjusting to the whole corporate culture thing. I only meant that you'd trained me well and wanted to see if I could do that without instruction"" should square things away. Most people will appreciate that, but if it doesn't work, some people just won't like you, and that's okay. Just remember to treat them politely and respectfully.   It sucks that your coworker complained through management or HR about your comment instead of directly to you, but that's just how corporate life goes sometimes. It tells you more about the complainer than you. If you have a best work friend in the office, or get close enough with someone there over time, you may be able to tell them about what happened and as about the person. They may be known to act differently than a lot of the people there. Just remember to be respectful while doing it.   Everyone makes gaffes when they start a new job. You will probably remember it much longer than anyone else."

So your boss or senior worker can make orgasm jokes but no one wants to hear about fanny jokes from you. Sucks but that's how it is. Some consultant has made millions by telling the bosses they need to be able to ""relate to the drones"".  As a general rule as well, older people don't like being spoken to like they are 20 year olds. There's a different set of social codes, Im not saying you have to call this dude ""sir"" from now on. But being too familiar, even saying real concerns in a familiar way will likely insult him. Of course he will probably feels he has some ""fatherly"" responsibility for you, in which case you can thank him for his concern but say your boss has it covered."

Sleeping with her HS boyfriend was something you considered a screw up?  But why?  And was she cheating on her boyfriends at the time?  Because I also don't understand why her having been active suddenly means she has a propensity to cheat.  Plenty of women have active sex lives with many different people and are able to be completely monogamous without cheating.  Her past is in the past and she is presumably happily married to you now, full stop.  I know it seems jarring that she wasn't completely honest with you, it probably wouldn't hurt to do a couple of couples counseling sessions to find out why she felt like she needed to keep it from you in the first place.  That would probably help open up your lines of communication to avoid any other skeletons popping out to surprise you later on."

This is why when we were dating and she said it was a 1 time mistake, i was okay with it. Idk she lied until now to tell me that she couldn't even count the times. To me, the lying that is painful and there's been other stuff (she's gone on my computer to check my email, monitor my cell phone messages, and really any outgoing communication). At first I didn't really notice it until family pointed it out. All of this kinda stuff makes me feel like there's a game afoot, somewhere, somehow."

More certain, sure and careful decision making that's led me to deep faith in God. I'm just really kinda floored that she dropped this one on me. We actually are seeing a counselor for other things (other breakdowns in trust).   I do appreciate the honesty, but I'd point out 1) She first described her past sex life as ""one boyfriend, one time, one mistake"" and 2) Then all of THIS which leads me to think 3) what else has there been, and should I expect more?

I completely understand that this is throwing you for a loop and I really do understand why.  That's why I think continuing the counseling and bringing this up in the context of those counseling sessions will be so important.  I am guessing she felt like she needed to lie about it because I'm sure she was ashamed based on your mutual background, however, that does not excuse the breach of trust here. I get what you are saying, you feel like you're waiting for the other shoe to drop and for her to be like ""oh and btw etc etc"" which leaves you feeling uneasy.  The only way to get past this is to rebuild your trust with her and it sounds like you guys are on the right track.    I stand by my statement that I don't think you should jump straight to cheating in your mind though.  You just need to keep communicating with her and keep on going to counseling.  All of this just points to the two of you having a breakdown in trust and communication somewhere but you can work through that if you both want to--and I am guessing you do.  It might be beneficial for you to each schedule some individual counseling sessions too just to get everything on the table, so to speak.  Good luck!"

I still think that the main issue here is her not being honest with you (it also sounds like she might be a bit insecure when you talk about her going through your phone, e-mail, etc). You two definitely need to have a discussion about the nature of your marriage, why she felt the need to lie, why she feels the need to go through your stuff, and any issues she might be feeling towards you (this is important to touch on, perhaps something you do is causing her to be anxious unbeknownst to you). Obviously the sexual partners thing is a shock to you, but you have to remember it's in the past and nobody can change that - the best we can do is learn from it and try to better ourselves in the future.

You sound kinda paranoid so it is hard to take you seriously.   He often orders for me, not always though.   If you don't like this, tell him! There are some guys who order for women because they are controlling and sexists, but I also know a few women who are very shy and ask their SO to order for them.   Whenever I look around the room, he will see what I'm looking at and seem annoyed and especially if I happen to look at another man, he will widen his shoulders.   This could go either way, but it seems like you are going as far out of your way as possible to see him as abusive. Has he actually said anything? Or do you just judge him by where his eyes are and is breathing? You could be projecting, he could be controlling, or he could be annoyed that his date isn't really paying attention.

After she went on a trip in 2013, she xame back with a completely different mood and was acting a LOT more.. playful. So i have suspicioions on that too.. if she just had a good time with her friends and him being there, or other things went down.. knowing if all that time she was with him, or in fact she was being honest with me by telling me she broke up with him way before me and her started talking.

relationship_advice,3d0eko,jujolina,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:03:33 2015 UTC,"and a reason I have a problem with her sometimes is that, we used to always be joking together and pmayful in general... flirting and just having fun, but it bothers me that when I try to do it now it wont happen. She has told me she wants to keep it as joking and friendly, but whenever I try to play with her, she is kinda stale. She doesnt respond at all like she used to and sometimes completely kills a conversation. Its even hard to have an average conversation with her at times because just one words or hardly responds..."
relationship_advice,3d0eko,jujolina,2,Sun Jul 12 14:08:36 2015 UTC,"When we develop an intimacy and relationship with someone, there is a totally natural expectation that develops with it. This expectation is that we're ""owed"" certain things by this person, and that we in turn owe them. The things we believe are owed vary from person to person, but include things like honesty, respect, and closure.  The problem is that this reciprocal relationship only works when both people accept these expectations and acknowledge what is owed to the other person. The girl you're talking about neither accepts or acknowledges that she owes you anything, which breaks that relationship, and results in the uncomfortable fact that, since the relationship you thought existed between you two doesn't exist, neither does the expectation.  In other words, as natural as it is for you to want closure and honesty from her, she doesn't owe it to you and you won't get it.   The best thing you can do is remove her from your life, come to terms with what you two had and its ending, and try to be more careful in who you develop relationships with in the future."

I know that probably sounds morbid to you at first look, but it really is the smart thing to do. Look, you can't force her to lose weight; you can stop enabling her; but you can't force her to change.      This weight has nothing to do with giving birth to you or your brother (women burn more calories during breastfeeding btw), it isn't a stress issue either. It's a series of poor life decisions surrounding food, and may also include an addiction to some types of food. She has to want to change for it to work and no calorie restrictive diet is going to help long term, it has to be a complete lifestyle change that includes personal outlook.      With that in mind, it's important to note then that if she hasn't decided this for herself after all these years and health problems she is honestly unlikely to make that decision now, at least until it's way too late. I see it every week and as disheartening as it may be to think beyond the point of her morality my advice is that you don't want to be caught unprepared financially and have to deal with that stress during your grief as well."

relationship_advice,3cz665,kc1328,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:00:51 2015 UTC,"He is pulling you down. Can't you see that? I know it feels like its just how things are. It's what you've been doing for so long it feels normal. But it isn't. It isn't right.   Many relationships work with only one partner working. But it only works when both agree and work with each other to MAKE it work. It doesn't work at all when one of you is scared to bring up a problem for fear of a blowup. It is not normal to break things to get your way. I willing to bet you something. If you look back on every time he has broken something, its not his stuff getting busted up is it? I bet it's your stuff, things that mean something to you, or if it IS his stuff, its things you gave him and feel hurt he has just tossed away like trash.   You are in an abusive relationship. This is aside from money, but money is a part. He is controlling you, I bet he loves that you are cut off from family and friends. He probably encouraged it to happen and talks shit about them.   Tell me how many things I'm right about, and if I am, let me tell you that I know all this stuff because it may as well be a script.  This is classic, textbook, and common ways someone is controlled and used by an abuser.   He doesn't like your opinion. So he threatens to break stuff to shut you up. And you do because you can't afford to replace those things, you don't want the drama, you wish he would just stop.   But he won't. People like this use you, and use these tactics to gain control. If its not one argument its another.  Let me ask you this too. Can you see the fights coming? Maybe for days before you know it's going to happen. You can see the look in his eyes or hear that sound in his voice. Maybe he snaps a little over petty crap until you know he's looking for any reason to explode. And it doesn't matter how hard you try, you can dodge all the major things you know will set him off. But it always happens even if it makes no sense that you are having a fight about fucking semantics.   How many times have you had a fight and he blows up. You end up apologizing, and after its over you don't even know how the fuck it turned into a fight in the first place?   Maybe I'm just taking a wild guess here. Maybe it's my own past experience coloring my ranty comment here now. But the way you put things and the baffled tone to your post sets off all too familiar and troubling alarms in my mind.   I went through this type of thing. The fights sometimes made sense, as to why the fight happened. But nearly always I never could understand just how everything became my fault.   This is so familiar to me. Right down to him saying I should leave him and putting down every effort I made to do something for me, us, or our home or life. What'so horrible about putting up shelves and pictures aside from the fact that it will give him more targets when he goes on a spree of destruction? People usually decorate. But I stopped.   I still, years later, have never decorated. My walls are bare. I'm almost afraid to put things away because years of dealing with this kind of guy taught me that those things I spent so much time and effort on will just end up a broken mess after one of his nonsense rage outs.   I hope this isn't your life. I hope if it is you will do what you need to and get him out of it. I hope I'm wrong.  If I'm not though, pm me. I can give you some good advice, it may be hard to take but I will do everything I can to tell you how to get out of this in the safest way possible. And it will be dangerous, but it will be worth it when you get your sanity and life back. I know because I left and I am happy now. Still just a touch messed up, but that first week was proof of how miserable I was when he was around."

The guy cheated on her twice before she finally moved out for a second time.   My advice to you? If you love the guy keep him as your house pet like we men do.  House pet, house wife whatever you want to call him.  I'm all for being a kept man.  I just have to find a woman who doesn't have kids, cats, or crazy.  I wouldn't be depressed about that at all."

The support she filed on me won't go through since I have a pending case right now. She also can't afford a lawyer either.   I don't take what you said wrong.

I find that I am pretty depressed and suffer quite a lot of social anxiety that generally means I am not my full self in a large group. I am not sure how you are with this but my friends still make an effort to do stuff with me occasionally because, they are friends. I know it hurts to be left out of stuff but you can't be picked for every team, and I understand this; so when my friends actually do stuff with me, I just try to have a good time and they generally feel the same way. Friendships don't necessarily have to die, but as you are growing you should realise that they are never going to be as strong as when you were a small child and did everything together.  I tend to do the fifth wheel thing and I end up feeling awkward and upset because of it; but it is all a mental disposition and even though I assume no one likes me, it is actually the opposite. Don't go cold turkey on the friendship, but take the opportunity to branch out and make more friendships. I assume you are coming towards your final years of schooling and soon you will realise that any grudges you ever held or mutual dislikes of people are completely petty and there is so much more out there for you to experience if you breach your current comfort zones and branch out.

Nevertheless, he needs to get a hobby.

You're going to have to learn how to converse with your father as an adult. Pop tall and start now.

Pretend he's a child having a hissy fit (cause he is) in the middle of the grocery store. Do you coddle the child? Do you give it what it wants to make it stop? No, you move forward and eventually the child will realize it's being left behind and change its behavior.   Explain your expectations and wants for the relationship with him and if he has a hissy fit then go no contact until he apologizes.   Say your peace and move forward. Again I refer back to... you're going to have to learn how to talk to your Dad like an adult and if he responds like a child then continue living your life until he does.

The very extreme mood swings and strong feelings sounds a lot like the manic/ depressive cycle.   I know there's a stigma attached to mental illness but it truly is a disease/ disorder just like anything else. People close to me have gotten treatment for their disorder and gone on to live perfectly normal, happy lives. At any rate, going to a therapist or psychiatrist couldn't hurt considering the drinking issues; this could just be his form of a cry for help.   Best of luck."

relationship_advice,3cxegr,ariarie,0,Sat Jul 11 23:45:21 2015 UTC,"Maybe that's your experience, but I've seen a lot of people really band together when their loved ones are diagnosed. Unfortunately, it does not have the same automatic support that a disease like cancer gets but the attitude is slowly changing. One day, the general public will become more educated about the disorder but until then I hope families and friends are willing to take on the burden of support that comes with trying to be there for someone who has a mental illness. I also hope that one day people with mental illness won't have to deal with the stigma and will be able to easily get treatment so that they don't have to feel so burdened themselves.   Also, I would like to add that maybe treatment seems like the only plausible choice, and in the majority of cases it is, but treatment comes with a whole bunch of side effects (including fatal liver damage) so it's not unthinkable to waiver on treatment options. Medication, in my opinion, is the best option but it's good to know what you're getting yourself into with treatment - there's really no perfect cure."
relationship_advice,3cxegr,1fuathyro,2,Sun Jul 12 00:38:52 2015 UTC,"You can band together all you like with any issue (bi-polar, alcoholism, drug addiction etc.) but if the person doesn't get help it does no body any good.   Bi-polar people (those with mania) are difficult because there is an aspect of their ""disorder"" that makes them like feeling the way they do (ie the mania might give them a high etc.) which is why when they are put on drugs to help them regulate their moods they don't feel as 'creative' or (fill in the blank)...SO, the result is they don't take the help.  Yeah, I feel you regarding the meds and side-affects but just like any other disease you treat there are always side-affects (ie Aids meds have side affects and affect the liver/kidneys etc but if the people don't take the meds they will die anyway) but it really depends on how badly the disorder is affecting  your life. If you cannot get along with friends/family/work mates etc. then seriously what other avenue do you have?"

I was trying to say that I could understand any wavering that a bipolar person had.   It's genetic. So, I guess the point of my reply was to say while I agree with the main theme of your comments, I do think the people who are having to make these choices deserve to be cut a little slack. I grew up watching the way society treats people with bipolar disorder. Most people with mental illness are treated horribly for an illness that they had no hand in creating. It's not bad health habits like coronary heart disease or environmental causes like asbestos causing cancer, it's genetics. It's a bad draw of the cards and it sucks."
relationship_advice,3cxegr,DaikonAndMash,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:12:14 2015 UTC,"I have worked with people with mental illness for many years and there were a couple things i noticed. One, that many are strong, resilient and they are 'survivors'...and there is a lot of stigma with mental illness but just like with any other disorder there are complications that make it something difficult for all parties involved to handle so I have empathy on both sides.   To be clear cancer and heart disease have their own part to play in genetics (it's not just nurture/environment) but I get what you are saying nonetheless. Again,  all parties should be active in their wellness not just for their own sake but the sake of  the people around them as well because illness, regardless what it is affects everyone involved."

Could it be he's struggling with loneliness / isolation / depression. ..and here comes this new person who is family, except without all the weight of the baggage that comes from a long history - mistakes made, words said, things done...so he feels like hes got a chance to connect with someone with whom there isn't the weight of the past anchoring the relationship?  My dad and my brother's wife get along like mad. Partly, she's just a really warm, outgoing person who joined our family at a time when things were particularly rough for my dad and she reached out to him. Partly it's because we have a really disfunctional family dynamic - too many secrets and lies and scars to look at eachother steadily.   I was actually pretty jealous to find out he talks to her much more often and more openly than he ever did with me, his only daughter. He treats her like I bitterly wish he'd have treated me. But I think the point is she's NOT me. He gets to pretend to have a new daughter - one he has never let down, one with whom things can be fun, not complex. He gets to pretend like hes an awesome father with a loving daughter when they text and call every day.  Meanwhile i haven't spoken to him in a year.   It's possible this is about an attraction to her, but could your dad be seeing her as a way to fill the void with something uncomplicated by his own fuck ups?   Either way it's an innapropriate and dysfunctional relationship for him to seek out, but figuring out his motivations might help you understand how to get it to stop."

If he chooses to 'turn sour' or, more accurately, act like an asshole, then you can both do a final text-  ""This isn't really our texting style and it feels forced bc you are demanding we respond in a certain why.  We are not going to do that so if it angers you its best that we don't text at all.  I'll give yo a call in a few weeks and maybe we can do lunch and catch up""  Then enforce that."

I do think that she had no right to read anything that is addressed to you.

When she read what your GF said she felt as if she is trying to drive you two apart, you are the most important thing to her. She is your mother. She is afraid that your GF will make you realize that you don't need your Mum anymore, also a big fear in every mother.   You're a big boy, so take care of it like a big boy and tell her that you aren't going to break up with your GF all because she got offended. You also make it noted that you aren't going anywhere and that you will be there for her no matter what because she is still your mother, but she can't control who you date. Let her know that card wasn't for her and that she is being over dramatic and that your GF didn't mean anything by it, that it was supposed to be uplifting not negative towards you in any way.   Let her know that no one can come between you two, and that you love her and that you will always be her son and she will always be your mom.  It might help if your GF apologized also. I know that she doesn't know, but maybe an apology would help."
relationship_advice,3cwcwq,Lenovo21,3,Sat Jul 11 21:06:32 2015 UTC,"This is a very immature response from your mother. She may not listen, but the best thing you can do is respond in a more mature way. Tell her what you've put in this post. Explain that you vent to your girlfriend when things get tough, and that your girlfriend did nothing wrong by commenting privately on your mother's unreasonable behaviour and supporting you. It's ultimately part of the job of a good partner. Explain that you understand she has had a stressful time, but that doesn't give her free reign to act however she wants without being called out on it. Stand up for your girlfriend and your relationship - you can express regret for the hurt caused, of course, but if she effectively eavesdrops on a private conversation and then gets offended by what she hears, that's her own fault."
relationship_advice,3cwcwq,imahippocampus,4,Sat Jul 11 15:45:33 2015 UTC,"So your mother is cancerous in health and in personality.   Illness is not an excuse. I can understand being sick and being irritable but that doesn't translate into being cruel, controlling or otherwise malicious. While it's good to support your mother during a time when her health is at risk she is over-reacting to the card. In fact, she is probably trying to cast your girlfriend out because both of you are aware that your mom is treating you like shit. She probably sees it that you will choose your GF over your mother, so if your mother can get you to split with your GF she wins be sapping even more happiness from your life.  Sorry, but illness is no excuse to treat people poorly and if your mother uses cancer as an excuse to treat you bad, she is manipulative and is actually not a good person."
relationship_advice,3cwcwq,SmallOrange,6,Sat Jul 11 12:19:38 2015 UTC,"I would honestly like to offer another perspective of this situation. The behaviour of your mother isn't right. She shouldn't have read the birthday card in the first place but she did. After that she should have been more mature and handle the situation differently. Maybe she should have tried to talk to you and ask about her behaviour in the past and how she hurt you (probably without the intention to do so). But please also consider that she has/had cancer. Cancer is a bitch. Even if she is healthy now (and i really hope so and wish her the best) she suffered during the time when she got the diagnosis and had to undergo the treatment. Cancer also affects your mind, your thinking. When you get the diagnosis you suddenly aren't healthy anymore. You are afraid. You don't know how bad it is or if it also could kill you. She has a child, a life and suddenly had to face the possibility that she might lose all of that.   During the last years in which I grew up and became an adult I had to learn something important about my parents. They did things wrong, believe me. But they never had the intention to hurt me on purpose. They just weren't capable of realizing how their actions affected me. I want you to consider just for a moment her point of view. After going through the fear of such a diagnosis she found herself confronted with the fact that she apperently also behaved like a bitch and that you are disappointed by her. How she reacted wasn't fair and mature but it was the reaction of a human being that got hurt. Maybe one with many flaws and mistakes but just maybe you could try to give her the benefit of the doubt that she didn't do it on purpose.  Try to talk to her. Try to tell her that you understand that her Situation was bad but that you needed someone to talk to when her stress and behaviour affected you and that your girflriend was there for you in this time. Because as I see it you also tried to do your best and by ranting about your mum with your girlfriend you tried to keep your frustration away from your sick mother. Maybe she could understand that.  I don't want to tell you that you are wrong. I made a lot of assumptions in this post and they could all be wrong, so if you feel like I am completely out of line with what I said please just ignore it and don't take it personally. I don't know your whole situation and can in no way know how bad the behaviour of your mother was in the past. I don't want to take her side without knowing what she did to you before all this happened so please don't take this as an offense if your mother turns out to be a bad person after all. But maybe you can try to be the bigger person in this story =)"

Narcissists fear being alone but do not have empathy so instead of being kind and loving so you enjoy their company, they emotionally manipulate you, making you doubt yourself constantly and have a hard time knowing what to feel anymore and keeping you emotionally off-balance. This often leads to their kids having bad anxiety also.  If this sounds familiar at all, visit /r/raisedbynarcissists. You're an adult, you don't need your mother involved in your personal life anymore. If you allow it to continue, she'll only learn that she can do these things any time to manipulate you.  Despite what anyone else is saying, it doesn't have a fucking thing to do with cancer. There are plenty of cancer patients who know how hard it is for their family as well as themselves and won't create drama and conflict and petty acts of possessiveness."
relationship_advice,3cwcwq,BigAngryDinosaur,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:18:25 2015 UTC,"I feel like a lot of the advice here is coming from people who have not experienced what cancer does to a person. Chemo fucks you up. Fear of death fucks you up. Being worried about your children and what they'll do without you fucks you up. Being betrayed by your body fucks you up. There's more, but that's some of what I saw.   Not everyone who gets fucked up by cancer gets fucked up in a likeable, sympathetic way, either. So if this is out of character for your mom in general, I think a softer, gentler approach may work better. The card is private, you're an adult. You love your mother and will always be there for her but you will still complain about her sometimes because she is your mom and that's what you do."

You may never have a healthy relationship with your mom, and you may have to start planning for adulthood without her.

The only problem is that you've kept your feelings secret, so no matter what she's going to get blind-sided. The other difficult thing for her will be that by breaking up you will be indirectly telling her that she's not good enough for you, and she's completely powerless to change that.  If you break up with her, you should do it somewhere she won't be able to do anything drastic and you should inform her parents immediately after you get a chance so that they can be there to support her if she does try to self-harm.   Lastly, don't rely on any cliches to break up. They make it feel easier for you to break up with her but on her side she'll think you're not being honest with her and the real reason you're breaking up with her is because she's not good enough. It would be better going into the situation without the intent to break up, and instead discuss your feelings and ask her how she's feeling about the relationship. What's good? What's bad? Right now you're focusing on that you don't want to be there with her and the pressure of what a breakup will mean. I think you need to refocus on the positive aspects of what you really want in life so that when you tell her what you want to do in your life now and in the future, it's not simply a rejection of her."

I would have to move back to Chattanooga and stay with a family member while walking or riding a bike back and forth from work until I got on my feet. So I could not take the baby."
relationship_advice,3czu8f,Everyonesacritic12,2,Sun Jul 12 07:37:34 2015 UTC,"Yes it's normal, and you should get over it because it's still irrational."
relationship_advice,3czu8f,juandh,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:52:09 2015 UTC,"You need to get over her. Look at yourself, look at her, look at your friend. There are good and bad parts of each of you but the only person you control is you.  So work on the bad parts of yourself and learn to be happy with yourself.  Once you're happy with yourself you'll have more positive energy to spend on others."

relationship_advice,3d04hr,KohGEE,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:38:45 2015 UTC,"The name for this is called being a ""cuckold"" or ""cuckoldry"". I assume it's something you enjoy although you didn't say you enjoyed it explicitly. Otherwise, I can't imagine why you would allow your wife to behave like a spoiled 17 year old high schooler who exploits you financially and emotionally, all the while she neglects her child and your needs while sucking the cock of a random club dj in his car.   I mean, I would tell you to get a divorce, custody and maybe even restraining order against her but you're probably too dumb to know how to use Google to find yourself a lawyer. I know it's hard for you, but please, at least try not to be such a fucking tool."
relationship_advice,3d04hr,lagernuts1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:28:03 2015 UTC,You really enjoy trolling? I mean thanks adding some new terms to my arsenal. You honestly don't know how to give advice.
relationship_advice,3d04hr,lagernuts1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:53:57 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry man, but sometimes I can't believe the things I read here on Reddit and today this was just another one. I don't really mean to be so offensive to you or hurt your feelings but your attitude here is more than a little unacceptable.   Your supporting an irresponsible wife who is openly dis-respecting you. You should not give her one penny biweekly or otherwise nor be encouraging her to go work in a bar. I also don't understand who recommended you have a child with the first person you got into a relationship with when she's had multiple partners before you. I'm telling you, she is not benignly just going to a club, sipping orange juice and avoiding guys. You're exceptionally naive and you should never allow the mother of your child anywhere near such a place.   Whatever suffering you endure it's because you are enabling it and encouraging it by not putting your foot down and establishing boundaries. She's walking all over you and laughing in your face because of it. I recommend you look through some ""The Rational Male"" articles: http://therationalmale.com/2011/08/19/the-cardinal-rule-of-relationships/ or from Chateau Heartise: https://heartiste.wordpress.com/the-sixteen-commandments-of-poon/"
relationship_advice,3cyuqv,PherMumbles,5,Sun Jul 12 00:53:58 2015 UTC,"The only winning move is not to play.  She's not rational or sane, she's got serious emotional issues that she's taking out on her daughter, so unless she's got an escape plan and is ready to nuke her relationship with her mother there's not a whole lot you could or should do.  Most home kitchens wouldn't pass health inspection, and that's not so much an insult to home cooks but rather how stringent local laws are on food safety, but you can't predict reactions from crazy people like her mother which is why it's dangerous to even try and work it out at this point. Hopefully your GF can get out of that house soon."
relationship_advice,3cyuqv,sinscriven,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:36:51 2015 UTC,So I'm just supposed to move on and cut ties because of this? I don't think I'm ready to do that.
relationship_advice,3cyuqv,csmithers,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:37:19 2015 UTC,"Just keep in mind that your desire not to cut ties with her should not mean that you should get in over your head. You don't want her to cut ties with her mother or get in the middle of any ordeals with child services. You also may not want her to move in with you and then if you and her don't work out, she has no where to go after.   The best thing you can do is ask her what she wants to do and respect her choices she makes for herself. If you want to make this work realistically the only way is for her to sneak around and avoid being tracked, but that's not necessarily up to you either."
relationship_advice,3cyuqv,Branfip81,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:58:05 2015 UTC,She moved out but her mom wakes her up?
relationship_advice,3cyuqv,kujhawk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:24:56 2015 UTC,"So I feel like there is more to the backstory than you know yet. I couldn't really determine from your post, if the mom was upset that you were of age and her daughter wasn't. Because if so, that would play a major role into why you're having this issue. But I also agree with the other people who say you shouldn't really do anything at this point because the girl is so young. So my advice is to give it time, relationships aren't sprints they're marathons. So when she is of age, things will change and hopefully get better."
relationship_advice,3cyuqv,downvotedkingoftruth,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:04:27 2015 UTC,"The age difference has never been in issue. Further in my state the age of consent is 16, so that's also not an issue.  Giving it time is a smart move, it just sucks to be in this situation and not have any good recourse, having no real time frame on it also doesn't help much."
relationship_advice,3czg3t,southerngal425,4,Sun Jul 12 04:32:51 2015 UTC,Go with it. Don't overthink things.
relationship_advice,3czg3t,Atomicdupont,2,Sun Jul 12 04:38:25 2015 UTC,In regards to this relationship what does being southern at heart mean? I've got an idea but I'm probably wrong so I'd like some clarification before I comment. I'm also from the North but have  lived in Alabama and Georgia so I might have some insight here.
relationship_advice,3czg3t,rxcowboy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:19:29 2015 UTC,Just enjoy it!
relationship_advice,3czqjf,throwaway32no10,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:42:11 2015 UTC,Talk to him. Ask him. Don't jump to conclusions. Communicate!   He seems to be responsive to you so try talking to him about it and see what comes out of it.   Good luck!
relationship_advice,3czq4x,Princessfishstick,4,Sun Jul 12 06:36:26 2015 UTC,Why doesn't he spend time with his daughter? His ex is doing the right thing by giving the grandparents access
relationship_advice,3czq4x,Branfip81,2,Sun Jul 12 13:44:57 2015 UTC,"Even if she finds someone she wants to spend her life with, she is likely always going to be involved with your boyfriends family. Her daughter is apart of their family! You need to put your insecurities aside and realize a child is involved here.   You can be close to his family as well. Take the time to get to know them. Just because they are close with her doesn't mean they can't be close with you.  Don't forget, dating someone with a child means the child is number 1 always. He should have a healthy relationship with the mother of his child. If you two get serious, no matter if she's single forever or in a relationship with someone else, she will be highly involved in your life due to the daughter."

relationship_advice,3czq4x,1wf,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:52:41 2015 UTC,"If his family is close to the mother of his child, he doesn't have to be with her to be with his child."
relationship_advice,3cxqgh,confused13434356,14,Sat Jul 11 18:47:53 2015 UTC,"Ok. Couple of things.   If this relationship doesn't work out, never have the ""number discussion"" in future relationships. It almost always leads to one person feeling like this. But you did and its done, so, here we are.   You should not ""confront her"" there is nothing to confront, she's done nothing wrong. What you could do is have an honest, vulnerable conversation with her about your feelings. You need to own up that you know they're unfair, but its how you feel and you're dealing with it. And then... deal with it. Sorry to just be so blunt and without detail, but I don't know how else to say it. Get over it.   I think few women would consider their SO special because of the sex. That may be a part of your relationship, but you are special to her because of your personality, your relationship, the way you treat each other. None of those things are affected by how many partners she's had.    normally I would have thought nothing about partying seperately... Now all I can think of is that hooking up with somebody seems to be a normal part of partying to her and that it might affect her behaviour in the relationship as well.   you need to cut that crap right now! Having sex with many people before you enter into a relationship does not in any way indicate she will be unfaithful while in a relationship. You need to get that in your head quickly."
relationship_advice,3cxqgh,redditgrlfriend,4,Sat Jul 11 18:58:36 2015 UTC,"Never ask someone how many people you slept with...the numbers(s) will never make anyone happy. She didnt do anything wrong, this was her past and you need to get over it, she chose you and cant change her past."
relationship_advice,3cxqgh,Deathbecomezher,4,Sat Jul 11 19:11:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I tend to shut down any conversation that heads in that direction and we do fine. I think OP should do this. Even though some damage has been done, it is important they never delve into details."

In fact you would claim her to be the ""lucky one"" you picked her! Get over yourself quickly or you might loose a good girl who might have a few sexual tricks up her sleeve."
relationship_advice,3cxqgh,matsercaboose,-3,Sat Jul 11 23:54:08 2015 UTC,"Confront her about what?  The shit she did before she even knew you were a human being, much less one she would end up adding to her, albeit lengthy, list of guys she's fucked?  You're one of those guys that needs to find some fucking 13-year old farm girl from Thailand and marry that."
relationship_advice,3cxqgh,lordfeint32,-5,Sun Jul 12 00:51:50 2015 UTC,"it's a lot easier for women to have a higher number count than man. i think if it was as easy for men, they'd jump at the opportunity too. maybe you can try and be happy that she has probably learned some tricks in that time and you are the one who reaps the benefits."
relationship_advice,3cxqgh,rhaeeh,-5,Sat Jul 11 23:10:40 2015 UTC,"She is worth more than the number of dicks that has been inside of her.  She is a human being, full of thoughts, emotions, hopes, dreams, and love that she gives freely to you of all people on this planet. So treat her as the valuable thing she is instead of treating her like you found a Fleshlight at a used goods/second-hand thrift store."
relationship_advice,3cxqgh,sinscriven,-12,Sun Jul 12 00:19:40 2015 UTC,"Relationships are like rental cars. Temporary as is everything in life. Someone drove it before you and someone will drive it after you. That's why you should never get married. Alimony, child support, loss of assets. There's no reward for the family man. Women today are looking for the tall tat'd bad boys. Oh sure they'll take a time out from them with a safe bet sucker of a guy long enough for the kids to hit school full time and then it's off to divorce court for them to redistribute YOUR income and assets as they see fit, and then it's back to the bad boys."

Depending on just how high that number is, maybe you guys are not right for each other. I'm not saying that someone who sleeps with a lot of people is a bad person for it, but for me that would be a huge dealbreaker. If you're talking like 15-20 vs you're 1-3, I could totally understand you being uncomfortable, if she's >50 I honestly commend you for even giving her a chance."
relationship_advice,3cxqgh,the_tardy_tardis,6,Sat Jul 11 21:47:11 2015 UTC,"Wow, what a completely unfair assessment of a total stranger.   This chick banged some people when she was single. Which is fine. Because she slept with people while single, it doesn't mean she's going to cheat on OP.   I've slept with several people while single. I'm currently in a 2 year committed relationship and have never even considered for one second anyone but my boyfriend.  Sleeping with people while single doesn't make her a cheater while in a relationship."
relationship_advice,3cxqgh,LipGlossary,-14,Sat Jul 11 23:50:38 2015 UTC,"If there have been 25 before you, and you are 26, why stress?  Most likely, she will eventually be on to number 27, and you two will be done with each other.    Until then, enjoy your time together, and don't invest too much, since odds are there will be 27th.  And when that time comes--whether it is you or her breaking up--wish her the best, and move on.  No hard feelings."
relationship_advice,3cxqgh,Stayinghereforreal,-8,Sun Jul 12 00:55:48 2015 UTC,"One ex of my friend had sex with his then-best-friend while dating him not yet exclusively, and while that made him hesitate, he still proceeded to date her and they were together for three years.  She confessed that while being with her previous boyfriend, he had slept with more than 100 men during the absence year of her ex (he had to go study abroad for one year), before she slept with my friend's then-best-friend and getting together with my friend - to prove she ""has it"" to her boyfriend then.  While I have never met another person M/F who has slept around with that many people over a span of 12 months, I think it is up to you if it bugs you or not.  In general, numbers don't matter - at all."
