Lets do this guys!!!   I am glad I went through this streak as it taught me that human beings are incredibly resilient. There were times where I had 2 hours of sleep and so much studying to do with lovesickness and depression and all the other crap from withdrawal symptoms. I wanted to give in so badly, but i literally bullied myself into being stubborn and unmoving.  There is hope out there guys. For you lot aways failing after 2 weeks. You are easily capable of this. You just need to want it more. And now I want success for my Lord even more, my psyche won't let me fail next time."

This can be the day we are defeated by our own hands, the day the shaytan that have been shackled in hell-fire, awaiting the day of ramadan to be over, to tempt us, to whisper to us, to let us be defeated by our own hands. Or ya akhi and akout, Ya brothers and sisters in the righteous religion, this can be the day we make our stand in the fight against bettering ourself, in the fight against impressing Allah Subhana wa Tala! This can be the day we move forward in our lives, and work towards becoming more confident, more prestigious, towards for ever being closer to the Almighty and securing our home in eternal Paradise.

Check the wiki of this page to change it.  Additional things to do that helped me stay away:-   1- I got myself really really busy from work to another freelance work  2- don't let other failures make you do this habit because it will make things worst and this is where I usually lose to it, unfortunately. So, I'll better be have a plan and a strategy to tackle that.  3- Avoid or stop everything that affects your lust. Ex: movies, series, TV. Also, we have a common problem within us as Muslims where we lower our gaze outside, but when it comes to TV or PC we don't which is a silent poison that has got into our houses and needs to be used in a proper way.  4- having a real intention and goal to leave this habit will help you reduce it a lot if not at all.  5- plan and make strategies based on your failures and or assumed scenarios to be ready to deal with it.  6- when you want to do it, open up a note or your diary and read how did you feel in your last relapse.  7- renew the intention and will to leave this habit daily when you wake up while you are looking at the mirror and say it out loud "" I don't want to fail to this habit and make it a reason for me to be in hell fire. Instead I want to get closer to Allah"".  8- Being in this community alone means you really have the intention to leave it but you need to renew and get yourself stronger.  9- pray night prayers.  10- avoid being alone with nothing to do.  11- don't leave the laptop or PC in bedrooms and move them to living room  12- organize your life and set goals and aim to achieve them.  13- Fasting: changes your thoughts from Sexuality to hunger and keeps you busy if you read Quran and get closer to Allah.  14- come up with new ideas and things that will help you to overcome it. Ex: change your phone background to something that reminds you of Allah or something that keeps you away from doing this sin.  15- go to sleep when you are dead sleepy.  16- don't leave any trace of anything that makes you fail. Ex: uninstall all programs or apps that makes you relapse and install apps that keep you away.  17- Failing to this habit doesn't mean you are weak, it means you have a gap you need to fill by replacing this time with something beneficial for you.  18- pray for me."

People have done that, and you too can conquer your urges.  Rule #1 Most important rule is to avoid any possible trigger, Movies, TVs, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or reddit, any thing that can trigger you just completely avoid that. Don't spend your idle time on internet. Do something else. THIS is the most important rule that MUST be followed at least in the start when your internal resistance is weak.   Secondary Rules are to just involve yourself in productive work, read success stories. just do things that you love or need to do. Adopt good physical or spiritual habits as you move on.   Its simple as that for me. Recently i have been violating RULE no 1 and I am facing so strong urges that despite of such long streaks I feel i am at day number 1 in terms of urges i feel, so never ever relax always stay vigilant and keep moving forward."

Also, you need to commit to NoFap a 120%, for me I promised I would never again M, and asked Allah to help me in keeping the promise, back in April (I'm 17, turning 18 this year, so it took about a year or so to reach this point, this is my longest streak yet), you need to actively prevent yourself fromM.

I used to be like that, but then I realized, all I needed was a mindset change.  Set small goals for yourself, 3 days, 10 days, 15 days, 25 days, 30 days, etc.   Believe that you can do it, and you'll be able to, insha Allah with Allah's help, and do make Dua, it helps a lot!

MuslimNoFap,3ducr7,nycBeardThrowaway,3,Sun Jul 19 15:43:58 2015 UTC,The desire to fap may lessen temporarily.   In my experience it really only increases my desires more and more since I keep chasing a high.  Wanting to do mutah shows that you want to be with a woman just to satisfy your desires and that's not the way a good marriage is.   It's a whole package.  If you got her pregnant and then had to marry her permanently with the original premise just being for desires you may be miserable.   Increasing your imaan along with no fap can lead you to a pure life more fit to enter marriage for the right reasons.
MuslimNoFap,3ducr7,gentleservant9,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:38:10 2015 UTC,"Lol, that's the reason why I mentioned mutah. That was the whole point of Mutah during the Prophet's time... And there is no such thing as permanent marriage... I'm not Catholic,  there is divorce in Islam. From what I've seen, marriage out of desire is a lot better than an arranged marriage."
MuslimNoFap,3ducr7,gentleservant9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:33:23 2015 UTC,"Well it was assumed that divorce is possible.   I meant a committed marriage not one with an expiration date.

MuslimNoFap,3ducr7,_Azrael,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:08:09 2015 UTC,Yeah No Fap really is the perfect exercise you can do to help you with picking up women. Being successful with No Fap you naturally go for women more. Really depends if your Imaan is higher than the desire to commit Zina. If you are looking for permission from a Muslim to do it I can definitely provide you with that although its plainly wrong Islamically. I don't think its the end of the world if you do as long as you make Salah 5 times or more a day plus eat Halal 100% of the time. Go to the Masjid a lot. If you stay strong on the Deen eventually you will give up Zina imo. Zina is an Imaan problem.

I work 80+ hours a week and have other commitments, so going to a ""masjid a lot"" isn't really going to happen.  And I'm pretty sure every sin is an ""Imaan problem"""
MuslimNoFap,3dtnej,toomanyca,2,Sun Jul 19 10:06:32 2015 UTC,"I will tell you my story. It all started two years ago. When I first discovered nofap . I also discovered found Allah. I prayed for 40 days in a row and I would always try to cry in salah as I heard that  Dua+Being Emotion= Dua Accepted. I went a week without fapping  first time in my life.( Masturbated Daily). I order to make myself cry consciously I would think that I was being dragged to hell and I was shouting ""Allah forgive me!! Forgive me!! :( "" . Then I dont know what happened. My nafs + Devil fooled me and I promised Allah that I would come back to you after I have defeated this PMO beast on my own and for past 2 years I did everything in my power to beat this PMO devil. I tried everything Herbs, supplement,Fasting and read many books on self improvement .......Nothing Worked nothing and since I wasnt praying,reading Quran and did nothing for my imaan....I lost faith in Allah. Yes..I lost faith. Islam felt like an Alien religion. Two years is a long time bro. In that period of time nothing improved. Even if it did improved it took a lot and lot of effort and I would eventually collapse in the end. I thought Allah hated me so whats the use  Then it happened 3 months ago. I thought to myself Man I have tried everything in my power to beat this addiction and yet I failed and I then admitted that this addiction cannot be controlled by me .Its too powerful. So I read christian stories of people who were addicted to porn or masturbation and they prayed to Allah so much that he gave them guidance and sometimes would just take away their desire for masturbation. Some people would pray so much day and night that Allah would instantly heal them in a day. I even read read stories of people who were homosexual and prayed to Allah to heal them of this mental sickness and they would be healed in an instant and some would heal slowly. The reason I was reading these christian stories was because I wasnt able to find stories like from muslim people but since its Allah who does all this therefore I kept on reading them....I then realised how powerful Allah is.   I then started praying 5 times daily and in Soojood I would Ask Allah to free me of masturbation. I relapsed so many time.My nafs and devil would say that ""Stop praying!! Cause u are still relapsing"" and if I relapse I would still pray(It was hard). I relapsed in ramadaan also many times.(How bad is that)..10 days ago while I was in bed and I became emotional and asked Allah to help me get rid of this addiction and I felt something click idk what ""inside me' something  small and I went 8 days  without fapping. This was like a miracle for me...I crossed 8 days so easily. Also in this period of time I took supplement which I was taking 6 months ago but wernt working for me. Instead of decreasing my cravings,These supplements magnified them 10 fold and I relapsed Like HELL!! But this time,Idk what Allah did to my brain and soul I am taking them eveyday and I have a lot less craving to fap.  I what I have learned is that in last 2 years is that ""FAITH WITHOUT WORK IS USELESS"" and ""WORK WITHOUT FAITH IS USELESS.  I did everything a nofapper does to stop an addiction but all work was in-vain cause I had no faith.  ""When you have no faith. Everything you do/every work you do/every step you take in life goes against you.""  Dont get me wrong brother. I am not saying that you dont have enough faith. Mashallah You read Quran(I cant) and pray 5 times daily(I miss sometimes) infact you do much more ibadah than me. But brother you must increase ur faith somehow. Idk how Go in sojood and be in sojood and keep on asking Allah to increase ur imaan. The more powerful ur addiction is the more powerful ur imaan will be if u leave it. So Ask Allah to Increase Imaan. You have internet in ur hands google and find ways to increase imaaan. Focus on increasing ur Imaan..."

Understand the harms of PMO like P induced erectile dysfunction and even the physical harm of MO.   It can ruin the intimacy we are allowed to enjoy with our spouses.  It's totally not worth it.

Ramadan was like my protection against fapping, since the fasting killed a lot of the urges, and it was also the time where I could tell myself that fapping would ruin my fast (the whole whispering of shaytan thing too) However, use the fact that you have to meet people to your advantage! Trust me, if you prevent yourself from staying alone, you'll have a lower chance of getting bored, which also means that you wouldn't get urges as much!"

It can make you vulnerable to many addictions. It can also lower the amount of pleasure you feel in your everyday life. It can also make your intellectual faculties weaker.

MuslimNoFap,3dg622,pazifex,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:11:42 2015 UTC,"i agree with what this brother has said the best way to stop this addiction is to increase your iman since you will become a stronger believer who wants to please allah in every way possible and fear him enough to stay away from evil. You do this by praying on time and praying all the fard prayers and as many sunnah prayers as you can, and learning more and more about our deen by either reading the quran or watching informative videos.  As a league of legends player myself i would say that it might not be the best way to keep yourself occupied since you expose yourself to a toxic community that may affect you in a negative way instead of positive but if it doesn't affect you its a good way to keep yourself occupied."

It's perfectly normal bodily function. Body is producing sperm and sometimes an overproduction of it causes some to secrete.   But yeah it sure does suck to have to ghusl once you wake up for Fajr.

Easiest way to do it? Be grateful. Be grateful for your health, your eyes, ears, family, friends, anyone whom Allah SWT has placed in your good company, anything and anything. Remember, all good is from Allah SWT. Also, ask Allah for the akhirah AND the dunya, and I mean really, REALLY ask. You'll be amazed with the results. I assure you.  Build a strong God-Consciousness. The best way to do this is to constantly remind yourself that you are being watched by God at all times. Not only that, but you are also being watched by the angels that are appointed over you to record your deeds. You wouldn't fap in front of humans would you? It's a lot more difficult to fap once you've convinced yourself beyond a doubt that you're being watched.  Still having problems? Analyze your behavior. Try not to stay alone.    May Allah SWT help as all and forgive us all and grant us new found strength and meaning in our lives. Ameen."
MuslimNoFap,3da6n0,sonyxperiaftw,5,Tue Jul 14 20:25:48 2015 UTC,"keep yourself busy, lower your gaze at all times, even by looking at pictures of girls online who are not even nude, thats how it starts, your nafs will be like one more second, then your jaw will drop, and you will cave for more and slowly slowly you will end up failing so : / be careful"
MuslimNoFap,3da6n0,badr911,4,Wed Jul 15 03:49:36 2015 UTC,"Assalam Brother.  First of all I pray that Allah gives you strength to continue your fight against yourself and that he blesses you for your dedication to self-discipline.  Now, let me tell you the truth. The Hard truth. This addiction will not be broken over night. It will not be broken within a week. Not even within a Month. It will be a daily struggle that will fight you with every inch of your being. It's easy to change a light bulb. A bit harder to change your daily schedule. Even harder to change a habit. But you see, it is nearly impossible to change yourself.  It will be hard lethal at first, I'd be surprised if you can go more than 1 week on your first try. If you've been doing this long enough that it is now hard coded into your brain, then you will soon realize that cravings are nothing to play with. They will literally drive you to the brink of insanity.  But there is a light at the end of the tunnel. First you will struggle to get past 3 days. But soon you will see that 3 days become 4. And then soon after 5. And so on.  Porn is not classified as an addiction by many medical doctors, but I tell you, it is. If you cannot go for a week without viewing it, than you've been caught in its net. You're going to have to climb out, 1 step, 1 tangle at a time. Each day another battle.  The best thing to do I find is to remove access to it. Put your computer in your living room or kitchen so you will never be alone. Don't play around with ""let me just check Facebook real quick at 2 am in the morning"". Go travel, or immerse yourself into a new environment.  This next part is crucial. YOU NEED TO WRITE STUFF DOWN. You will find that after 3,4,5, or even 8 or 9 days into your journey, you will start to forget why you started. Your Brain will play tricks on you. You will LITERALY HEAR the whispers of Shaitan. ""You cant focus without it"". ""It will help you fall asleep"". ""You've done alot of work and need to de-stress, you've earned it"". It will be so hard to remember the feeling of motivation that was there on day 1. It will be so hard to remember the pain of relapse that was there right after. That is what addiction does to your brain.  Now, I've told you a lot, but there is so much more. I could probably write a book with advice. In any case, I'll leave you with the last and most important piece of advice:  Allah is the most forgiving, the most merciful. If you struggle in his path, then he will reward you. God will not judge you based on your outcomes or ""results"". God will judge based on how you spent your time. If you struggle everyday trying to memorize Quran, but after 1 month have only memorized 1 verse, then you will still be rewarded based on the mountain of effort that you put in. In fact you will rewarded infinitely more than someone who can memorize simply by hearing, because for him he does not need to strive, but you do. At the end of the day, ask yourself ""Am I trying hard enough?"", and you will know the answer in your heart.  And always remember: Greatness is not about where you stand, It is about the direction you are facing. And like Imam al Ghazali said ""Desires make Slaves out of Kings, and Patience makes Kings out of Slaves"".  Inshallah we will all succeed.  Edit: Words and clarification"

MuslimNoFap,3cxxzg,sulaymanf,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:34:16 2015 UTC,"I think there is a better (softer) way to say this. When Allah loves someone, He gives them tests. We are all individually tested, each in a way that's customized to be specifically hard for us personally. Some of us are tested with oppression, others with poverty, others with wealth, and others with addiction. Allah knows you better than you know yourself, and knows what your breaking point is, and will not test you beyond that.  Stay strong. This isn't a simple test where you do it once for a short term and you're good. Avoiding fitnah and temptation is like a marathon. Ask anyone who gave up alcohol or drugs; the temptation doesnt get easier, but you DO get better at it."

Its Good that you can use willpower to overcome  urges for 20 days. But brother rrmember willpower is like a muscle and it can get exhausted.  The key to break free from any addiction is to make new and helthy habits. I did the same mistake for about 2 years thinking that just avoiding the urges and not doing anything will do the job.

On /r/nofap, the majority of people would say that edging is equivalent to a reset because it is still masturbating without the orgasm. However, there is another school of thought that states that this idea might be counter-intuitive (because you might as well finish the job you started). It is for this reason that the official position of /r/nofap is that you get to be the judge based on what you feel is appropriate. Hope this helps."

I used to do the same thing you did. I always let my mind go on auto-pilot and then I keep searching for any stimuli. Not necessary something explicit but it gave me a dopamine rush.   Understand your addiction, your cravings to porn is your addiction not stumbling upon it. In other words, if you kept searching for porn or any similar stimuli ""consciously"" then you are feeding your addiction. On the other hand, if you stumbled upon porn while you were surfing the internet and then closed it immediately, this doesn't feed your addiction because it's something you didn't do willingly.   I did the same mistake 4 or 5 times during my streak and guess what, when I reached day 68 the cravings were very hard for me. Though I was supposedly now in control of my urges.   I totally understand that this happens, but try not to do it again during this streak. If you did, then you are slowing down your recovery brother.   watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSFKKpwcGc0  and congratulations on your progress! 25 days are not easy to obtain!"

Brother, An analogy i like to think of is that PMO is a repeating cycle, which, whenever you do it, spins faster. It's like each PMO is a push to the turning wheel. My wheel has been at its highest speed ATM and when you realise you need to stop, it's not just a case of putting the brakes on and stopping.... It's taken years for porn to create pathways in your brain and it will take at least a fraction of that time to rid it  Just keep moving forward brother and do not try to look back. Each time you resist the urge, it is a push to the wheel in the opposite direction... But it needs many more pushes before the cycle stops completely but with the help of Allah, Inshallah you and all our Muslim brothers and also non Muslim individuals stuck in the cycle shall gain freedom   Just as a last note, I encourage you to go and check out the Fortify programme. The link is on the sidebar of this subreddit, its a brilliant and effective Program.  May Allah help us in our fight Inshallah  --Brother Scooby"

I was walking around at my old college campus during spring semester and it was so tough.   If you end up having to talk to a girl avoid lengthy eye contact by looking away every now and then.   And don't check out her body while you are talking to her!  Lol.   Lowering the gaze is a struggle but it makes things so much easier when you get into a habit of it since you reduce the triggers.  May Allah SWT make it easy for you and all of us.   Ameen.
MuslimNoFap,3ca9d7,tezraftar,2,Mon Jul 6 13:21:09 2015 UTC,"Just know that the first gaze in halal if you immediately look away. Physically turn your eyes away. If you eyes don't turn away, turn your face away. If your face doesn't turn away, turn your entire body away. Then in your mind say ""Oh Allah, I have turned away and not looked for your sake. Please accept this from me and help me succeed in becoming what you want me to become"". Do that each and every single time. InshAllah you will get better and better.   Edit: Also, if you do find yourself staring at a girl, stare and then STOP. Meaning don't continue thinking about her in your head. Once she's out of your sight, don't start fantasizing anything. Also, when there are no girls around, don't create imagine (fantasizing) either."

Look I know it is easy to focus on your faults,  but none of us are perfect,  we all make mistakes.  So maybe this year you relapse 5 times during Ramadan.  Then maybe next year it's only 3 times.

MuslimNoFap,3c5mh7,syfqhyaakob,2,Sun Jul 5 03:41:15 2015 UTC,"Removing anything that might trigger you from your surrounding would be a proper way to start. When you start getting triggered, go and do something else. Run, play a game, do something that will keep you busy from thinking about it. Find any way, any way at all to keep yourself occupied during the hours when you are prone to sinning. Work out if you have to, in the middle of the night, if you have to. If there is a family member of yours that is awake when you are triggered, go and sit with him/her so that you won't be alone which will only encourage you to do it. You need to be stronger in fighting this. Don't be all by yourself because according to you, even the thought of Allah watching you is not enough to keep you from sinning. Stay with someone all the time. Help around the house to keep yourself occupied. Find a hobby that takes a lot of time to be learnt so that you'll forget about doing it. What is important is staying away from anything that might trigger you, not being all by yourself at any time and keeping yourself occupied at all times. Good luck, brother! I don't suffer the same addiction as yours but doing those things keep me away from my problem. Keep us updated! Be strong! Ask for help from Allah but it is also important for you to work on yourself, too. Allah give rewards for our hard work so work harder on it, brother!"

Then a family crisis and losing someone I love so much made me feel like I'm useless and that no matter how much I pray, I'm still not a good person. So I stopped. My heart breaks everyday even though I still smile and laugh. I wonder when I will ever feel whole again because I've been feeling empty this whole time. I lost someone I loved, lost the affection of my parents and I feel so alone. Allah used to be my one and only place to talk to but after losing everyone I care about, I kind of just wanted to run away from everything. I'm so heartbroken. Half of Ramadhan has passed and I have not prayed once at all. I don't know what to do.

I just haven't been talking to anyone about this problem of mine bc I am too embarassed to talk about it since I used to go to the mosque everyday before. People don't expect a person who goes to the mosque daily to just stop praying all of a sudden. I only discussed this matter with a non-Muslim friend of mine who still encouraged me to stay close to Allah but I'm just sorely disappointed at the time.

MuslimNoFap,3bp34d,nofapthrowaway87,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:09:03 2015 UTC,"Brother, I love you for the sake of Allah and I feel your pain! I know it's difficult... but you must do it. You must fight through this. You can do it. We all believe in you, but more important Allah believes in you:  لَا يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْسًا إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا “Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear…” (Qur’an, 2:286).  Meaning Allah is only putting you through this because he KNOWS you can succeed. He saw the potential in you and so he's testing you.   If you turn to Allah in this month, you can attain a clean slate, just as if you were a new born baby. I was also drowned in sin at one point, but by Allah's permission, I was able to turn my life around. You can too! Allah will accept your repentance if you are sincere.   ""Allah says, 'I am as my servant expects Me to be, and I am with him when he remembers me. If he thinks of Me, I think of him. If he mentions Me in company, I mention him in an even better company. When he comes closer to Me by a handspan, I come closer to him an arm's length. If he draws closer to Me by an arm's length, I draw closer by a distance of two outstretched arms nearer to him. If my servant comes to Me walking, I go to him running."" (Al-Bukhari)"

We like to think we are curious and it is true, but the real thing motive is really to find a distraction. Some interesting article that I can skim read really quick or a cute cat gif. When addicts are recovering, they have to somehow fill the void of dopamine they are now experiencing and they fill it with various things until they find themselves back where they started. This is first and foremost for myself as I am extremely addicted to the internet as well. I come home and my habit is to get on my computer first thing, even if I don't have any reason to do so. I end up wasting precious time and hurting myself even more (even when I'm not PMOing). I realizing it's not just PMO that hurts me, it's me trying to escape reality."

For a lot of bros, this is where they come for support, to get some words of motivation, to feel like they're not alone even if they are irl. I think you said something quite good though   'Yes everyone can feel down and you can express it but in a way that benefit the reader '  I agree, I think if you are going to post something depressing, try and find something optimistic, or end the post in a hopeful way at least. Help us find the hope through the sorrow.  You can normally tell if the post is going to be depressing in the first couple of lines. We don't have to read them. I often skip some of the posts that look like they're going to be a downer. Or I might not read the whole thing and just post some advice after the first couple of lines. Even reading the other people's advice without reading the OP can be quite beneficial.  May Allah keep us all motivated so that we can be free from this sin :D"

If you relapse now, then it will be very difficult when Ramadan is over. Make sure you are not simply waiting without a purpose. Whatever you are doing, make sure there is a specific purpose. Don't let your mind wander around."
MuslimNoFap,3bdwxk,theGoodKindOfChange,4,Sun Jun 28 08:24:00 2015 UTC,"Brother I  have only one advice. Make Good Habits. Focus All your energy on making good habits. The thing with this addiction is that we have alot of free time. Free to fantasise,Free time to watch porn. Time is like a drug The more you have it,The more it kills you.  My younger brother when he was 12 I told him to never masturbate and watch porn and haram stuff and what I have seen is that he is always busy. Busy in learning new stuff,Busy going to college and performing good in class,busy in spending time.  He is a living proof for me.That stay busy in making good habits. I have Allhumdulilah started praying 5 daily prayer. It was hard at first but now is somewhat easy.I even pray if I relapse.  Try to make one good habit at a time.It is said that it takes 40 days to make a new habit. I guess its been around 50 days since I started praying. Now my next habit is to make sure I go to college regularly. I used to skip classes and avoided going to college.  So just stay busy in task and move forward in life. Abstainance is not the cure...."

MuslimNoFap,3bdwxk,alienz225,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:28:42 2015 UTC,"Well I go to sleep pretty late, usually after relapsing. Then I wake up for Suhoor, do ghusul and pray. I then go back to sleep, and wake up at around 12pm. Then I just do nothing the whole day, netflix, video games. Nothing much for me to do. Like I said, I'm only 16, so I don't really have anywhere to go. I do try to pray 5 times a day."
MuslimNoFap,3bdwxk,alienz225,3,Mon Jun 29 13:08:14 2015 UTC,"There's your issue right there. You're 16- an age where you can move mountains and you've locked yourself inside your house with the chains of entertainment.   If it's summer break, you need to get out and do stuff. Don't just stay in your house and play video games all day. This is a recipe for disaster. I was like you too when I was that age and you need to have sort of challenging activity. Join a cause, volunteer at the closest library or even the Masjid. DO SOMETHING! But it's clear why you're relapsing in this blessed month.   Your entire life revolves around satisfying your nafs: Video games, netflix, internet, etc. These are things you need to limit, especially netflix and internet. You can do it if you only concentrate. If you can't get out, try learning something via the internet. The world is in your hands. Watch Islamic lecture by Ustadh Nouman Ali Khan, learn programming (how to code a website, java, python, etc from youtube). There's so much you can be doing but you're wasting your life on entertainment.   Edit: http://i.imgur.com/QeaQfmO.jpg"

I'm always bored. I wonder if it's too late to do any good in this Ramadan. I feel like I already wasted it. Sidenote question: What's good software to block pornography, that isn't k9. K9 gives me internet problems the 4 or 5 times I've tried it. And when does NoFap just become easier? Or like, when will the urges just go away."

MuslimNoFap,3b9x9c,fappingconvert,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:41:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with that  but also, beginning before ramadan is better. Last year I started before ramadan even though I had one relapse in ramadan but I made my longest streak back then which was 40 days as I remember and that was before I knew this subreddit.   Having the mindset of ""If not in Ramadan then I can never do it"" is very risky. Just take your time, learn from your relapses, understand what triggers you and what leads you to relapse. Those are the most important points you should consider whether in Ramadan or not.  May Allah bless you and help us get rid of this filthy sin brother."
MuslimNoFap,3b9x9c,WillOfFire2015,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:39:49 2015 UTC,I don't think I understood your point about it being risky. If you can't manage to stop fapping when Satanic forces are bound then how do you think you'll manage when they're let loose?

MuslimNoFap,3b9ug6,Borscho,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:52:03 2015 UTC,I used to make oaths but then I kept breaking them thinking that I would do the kaffarah eventually.  I think I have over the past 6 years about 300 broken oaths. That's an overestimate but I need to overestimate to make sure I do the kaffarah for all of them.  I wish I had never started making oaths regarding this addiction.

Not only does it control the desire, it piles on the good deeds. Remember though that this is the limit and you cannot fast any more often than this.  Another great benefit to remember is that voluntary fasts can be broken at any time so there is no harm in aiming for it. If on a particular day you are incredible busy or tired and can't get through the fast, break it and just fast another day to make up for it to be safe. This difference from Ramadan fasts might not be known to some people."

Find some sort of activity which you know there are NO triggers. I mean absolutely 0% chance you will see anything the slightest it haram. It's not hard to do when you commit yourself to it. There are plenty of halal alternatives to having fun/entertainment. You have no excuse for if you're watch TV.

Every time you get stressed pray 2 rakat nafil and make dua. If you are still stressed take deel breaths and say astaghfar.    The key component that us Muslims have over others is that, we have Islam. Whatever stressor we have atm are nothing when we compare it to Allah. If you are afraid of losing the job, who gave you that job? Allah. If you are afraid of anything remembrance of Allah and him being the more mightier then all your problems will remove the stress from your life. There is nothing on this Dunya the should stress you out but shaytan has got in our heads and made it seem everything bad or negative is the end of the world for us. Remember the situation  is temporary. Work on it bro, work on managing your stress cause it takes everything I got to keep it low, but still hard to not to do M. Since its not one of the major factors for me anymore there are other things. InshaAllah this helped you I don't know if it did or made sense to you.

So work hard to get a better future, but appreciate that Allah can give that positive future to you, or He could make you go through a hardship. This is Allah's world, we just live in it.

Yes PMO is a not an easy sin alright but it's not automatically an act of disbelief. Allah don't stop forgiving until you stop asking for forgivness.   Allah says :""Say, ""O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.""  Also :"" He said, ""And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord except for those astray?""  Both are wrong but Despairing is worst than Sinning.

At the same time, i feel I shouldnt take advantage of his mercy and if i repent it should be with sincerity. Asking Allah's forgiveness and intending not to return back to this habit. I admit it is an addiction that is difficult to overcome and Allah is the most merciful, but i think when we repent it should be whole hearted repentence and with firm intention to remove this evil from our life. As humans we are weak and returning to my old ways in pmo seems to have been a reoccurring theme, that i just want to erase. I would previously sin and then repent, then sin again and repent again and so on and so on. But I will not despair in the mercy of my Lord brother and thankyou again for this reminder. I pray Allah makes the removal of this habit easier for us guys and everyone else. May Allah grant you and all the believers Jannah and also guide mankind onto the straight path, Ameen."

MuslimNoFap,3b3l7w,alienz225,2,Thu Jun 25 18:09:31 2015 UTC,"Thats the biggest lesson of Ramadan, if we can leave food and water which usually is permitted for a whole month for Allahs sake why can we not abandon our sins which is forbidden the rest of the year.

Since ramadan started I have been reading 1 juz of the quran every day, and I pray the sunnah, nafil prayers. Also I try to keep myself occupied with dhikr  Reading some islamic books    Basically just keeping busy, remembering Allah.    Al'hamdulillah much better than last ramadan.

Ramadan, serves as something like boot camp in the army, a rapid training, for the real war (in this case the real world, the months after Ramadan).   Also, I found that giving 99% leaving the 1% chance of relapse isn't going to help, you need to completely commit to never again PMO'ing, ever. 100%.   Thats what I did, 69 Days ago, and I constantly remind myself of this. Being 17 Years old, it hasn't been easy, but I've committed myself, and I can handle urges pretty well :)"

Honestly man, don't even think about after ramadan right now, focus on the small things which made you relapse time and time again and work on fixing those small things these new 20 days and InshaAllah after ramadan you will be able to manage.

While In internet You Choose what To watch..  Internet much better that Stupid TV. If used Wisely and for the sake of knowledge.

I remember a Hadith..Where someone asked a woman  That how will you if a particular thing(worldly) is a blessing for you or is a curse for you?

Looks are just a nice bonus at the beginning of the relationship.  Besides 7/10 isn't bad man.   What is her soul like?  Can you have a spiritually healthy marriage with her?

I know you've heard this before but Marriage shouldn't be heavily about satisfying your sexual desires, it is and should be about a whole lot of different things too, sex should be just a part of it.  About you being attracted to her, well looks won't even matter when you'll be truly attracted to her, and that true attraction will happen when you build up healthy communication with her, when you feel immense care and love for her and experience that she feels the same for you which will convert into sexually attraction, that kind of sexual attraction will be much better and more pleasing to Allah swt than just forcing your mind to replace her with porn.

But you see there's something called porn that distorts human reality and plays with your brain and conditions it in ways you could've never have imagined. I have developed fetishes that I feel ashamed even mentioning on a forum to stranger. The more i abstain from PMO, the more flash backs i get of my fetishes and when i've indulged in them.   Yea it'll be a long long journey of repair and therapy in order to reinstate myself back to normality. That's one of the reasons why I'm trying to delay the whole process of marriage as much as I can for now. I need to fix a few things before I bring someone else in my life."
MuslimNoFap,3ax8ey,theGoodKindOfChange,2,Wed Jun 24 22:06:16 2015 UTC,"I think what matters more is how well you can communicate with her rather than how she looks like.

Many girls are skinny before marriage, maybe she'll develop a much more desirable body for you after you marry her. If I'm you, I'll go for it.

I know someone who married and thoughd like ""It is all about Deen, beauty will vanish"", but at the moment he is really struggling. Marry someone you really like. Deen is important, but so is beauty.  On the other hand, if you yourself are like a 6/10, dont go for a 10/10, be realistic :P Dont always want to go better and better. There is a cool story about this idd like to tell:  Ahmed once asked the hand of his childhood love. She rejected him, because he wasn't beautifull enough for him. Ahmed became very sad and left the city. He went to Bagdad and became a very rich person. 10 years had passed and he came back to his village to meet his parents. He noticed his childhood love. She was letting her husband out. When he looked at the husband, he was not beautifull at all. His hair had fallen, he was very skinny and looked old. So he went to his childhood love and said: ""Oh Yousra!, you didn't marry me 10 years ago, but you married him?! Why!"". Yousra told him to go to her rose-garden and take the rose he liked most. Ahmed was a bit confused but he went to the rose-garden. He found a beautifull one, but he saw that in the distance there was a more beautifull one. So he went to the second rose. And on and on. Till he came to the seventh rose. He saw that the seventh rose was actually really ugly, he said ""Ah well, I think the sixth was good enough"", so he went to the sixth. But the sixth rose was crushed when he walked to the seventh. So he went back to the fifth, fourth, third, second and first, but all were crushed. Zeynep looked at him and said ""And that is how I ended up with the ugly rose"".  It is your decission. Dont think Beauty is not important, but don't also hold to high expectations. You know yourself better than us :)"

However, this is what I've observed:  I've noticed, personally, that my opinions on attractiveness change depending on whether I've recently watched porn or whether I've managed to abstain for a few weeks. Since certain physical features are more common in porn, our minds often make an unhealthy association between those traits and pleasure. My preferences from before and after I got into this habit differ greatly. However, these connections do weaken after a period of abstinence.  That's not to say that you will definitely find her more attractive once you quit porn, but bear in mind that your judgement could currently be clouded by deviant sexual behaviour and influences."

When she brought him the dinner, it tasted foul and rushed. The man had every reason to get angry but instead he continued eating and was merciful to his wife who also seemed somewhat stressed.

MuslimNoFap,3av1gl,lucky001,2,Wed Jun 24 05:52:21 2015 UTC,"It's absolutely true. I have read books on sex/porn addiction and theres a chapter on ""Unsuccessful Cures"". One of the unsuccessful cures is MARRIAGE. It doesn't solve the problem, the addict is still an addict, and in fact the problem gets worse!  We have to remember that porn/sex addiction is due to improperly coping with the stresses of life. We act out and PMO or sexual chat when we're younger because of improperly dealing with the stresses of school, trying to make something of ourselves, trying to get a job, childhood wounds that hadn't healed etc. We try to escape problems temporarily rather than tackle problems.   What do you think marriage does? It's an extra level of responsibility so it brings an extra level of internal stresses and worries! And then the next level after that is having a child and being a parent. It's a beautiful thing but it is another level of responsibility and it brings more internal stresses and worries. What is an addicts reaction to stresses and worries since usually an addict can't cope in a healthy way? The drug.  I have been an addict since I was 12, maybe even younger. I thought being more religious would solve the problem. NOPE. It got worse. I thought getting married to THE LOVE OF MY LIFE would solve the problem. NOPE it got worse! I thought becoming a father would for sure solve the problem! NOPE! This is when it got to the worst of the worst and my wife's heart is totally broken and shattered by my addiction and poor choices and decision making.  Porn is infidelity on its own, but it's the gateway to true infidelity (zina). It has to be actively fought against through a recovery plan and through a solid support system and solid boundaries and lifestyle changes. That is the only cure."

MuslimNoFap,3aule7,yosef94,3,Tue Jun 23 17:21:32 2015 UTC,"Its not too late! The Hadith says: this month the beginning of it (first 10 days) is Mercy, the middle (second 10 days) is Forgiveness from Allah, and the end (last 10 days) is when Allah will save people from Hellfire.   I'm so thankful that we have a Merciful God. We should all ask Him for mercy now, so that He can forgive us, and we can be saved from Hell.  Remember the Hadith says that Allah will never get tired of forgiving you until you get tired of asking Him to forgive you :)  Alhamdolilah"
MuslimNoFap,3aule7,mentaleur,4,Tue Jun 23 17:59:48 2015 UTC,"I too have not fapped since the day before Ramadan when i ruined my streak, Alhamdillulah this month has already changed me in many ways and im hoping to make it past 30 days and even more.  Strangely i have had a fight in my dreams with shaitan, i keep having erotic dreams where i in the end wake up mad as hell about even having them, i cant describe it but its like im fighting the dreams and the pictures when i wake up its something which have never happened to me.  But thankfully the dreams have never had an impact on me relapsing and im even becoming stronger and more resolute. Keep fighting the good fight brothers. Indeed everyone faces trials and tribulations. Think of this as a Jihad al nafs and a hijra from sins."
MuslimNoFap,3au5u6,WillOfFire2015,3,Tue Jun 23 15:13:05 2015 UTC,"salam brother, as I responded in google forms, very nice initiative,  I suggest we proceed this way:   1- first,  we have to agree on a detailed plan for the book : introduction, masturbation in history,  why its bad(science/ religion), how you can stop,  success stories....etc  2 - Each week/month we open contest for contribution in one part of the book (chapter/part..) and someone in charge chose the approprite content based on the comments and upvotes,  he can mix different contibutions as well.  this method require time but at least it would guarantee the best quality  so it can benefit others"
MuslimNoFap,3au5u6,mentaleur,2,Tue Jun 23 15:53:40 2015 UTC,"Mashallah sounds like a really great idea and its a great initiative, I'm a brother from Sweden who also got caught up in this damaging addiction early on in life and i would love to help out, i can even translate the book to Swedish when its done if i have time. I'm thinking that many of us brothers here have different native languages and can help out in translating in order to reach a wider audience however an English version of the book should be the main goal as it its the international language of our time however i agree that it should be translated into Arabic as soon as possible.  I agree with the poster above when it comes to having a detailed plan for the book. There has to be some kind of structure and many people can help in that aspect but in order to prevent confusion an admin should decide which contents should be in this book.  I think that's its good to have a detailed plan and also to have a subject to talk about, where some kind of admin can give hints and directions on what the submitter should write about. If its a book its very important to have the right grammar and to write in correct English so someone should be responsible for correcting syntax and linguistic errors, there should also be an editor in the last stages who should edit the text and add and remove texts and who would edit the texts to prevent it from becoming a repetitive or dull book and in order to make a more engaging and interesting book . My English skills are quite good and i have translated some websites into Swedish so i would be happy to help with the evolution of the book.  Also many of us brothers have money in our banks alhamdillulah and love to give sadaqah in order to get rid of some sins so if you want to get funds in order to publicate or advertise the book or just be able to work harder with the book or pay an editor or something like that. There are many sites where you can create a fundraiser for your cause.  I think that we in this book should highlight the emotional, psychological , mental , spiritual and bodily injuries that porn can make on a man or woman and put them in contrast to the western ""studies"" which lies and says that porn and masturbation is good which is the cabled out in the medias which seemingly is in order to whitewash it. Also i recommend that we use certain hadith and Quran to highlight Allahs mercy , We should write about the multitude of negative effects of porn and how it affects  the way a man sees a woman in daily life and how a woman sees a man. We should also write about methods the Muslim community and communites at large should implement in order to protect our future children from the underreported and underestimated problem of our time the problem of pornography. We do not have to come up with everything ourselves but we can gather information from various reliable sources and improve upon it and use the valuable information to our benefit ."

Otherwise, if you keep thinking, your brain will remind you of the temporary pleasure but not the sorrow and regret afterwards. Another way to fight it is to say out loud ""I choose not to do it today"" yes trust me it sounds simple but this is your will. If you convince yourself that You don't want to do it, you will kill the urge easily because the decision has been made. However, if you are in tentative state, your lust will beat you. Keep yourself busy and read Quran, pray Tarweeh. Renew your intention daily and I mean it and take the decision once you get up and say it out loud ""I won't do this sin because it is haram and it is harming me, I would rather get closer to my creator""  You can do it bro!

MuslimNoFap,3at903,FreedomFromNafs,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:02:46 2015 UTC,"Even without porn, masturbation still causes trouble. We see the study material. It feels like so much to cover. That makes us feel overwhelmed and stressed, and then we run to our addictions to destress. Whether the addiction is fapping; porn; smoking; browsing the entertainment subreddits and comments sections for hours on end.... The outcome is the same: instead of making headway with our studies, we have lost a lot of time, with no benefit gained. And fapping is one of the worst, since we lose time while searching for right material/building up the perfect fantasy, then we lose time on the actual deed, then we lost time cleaning up afterwards, then we are too tired to study due to post-coital tiredness. In the end, we've lost hours and the workload has not changed.   Instead, break down your study task into sections. Set a timed limit for each section. Tick them off as you go along. Include breaks for exercise, meals, salaah, ibadah, and time with family/friends in your timed schedule too. Don't leave space for fapping. Don't even consider it as an avenue for destressing. It will be difficult at first, but it will get easier, insha allah. I've been doing this myself and it's helped immensely."

Though it does NOT appear that he has an actual psych issue, when somebody says 'maybe I should see a psych' you should take that seriously. It might be something they've thought about for a while, they could actually have long-term issues which you don't know about.   People are reluctant to admit real mental health problems so picking up on cues is important. Perhaps few of those cues are truly indicative of a health problem, but if we're always dismissive we delay the people with real issues from seeking help.  TL;DR When somebody gives a hint that they might need medical help we should explore the issue further and offer whatever help we can."

I've read your posts before and I think it's just because you're in a difficult situation right now looking for a job and caring for your dad. I don't think it's a medical condition. Having said that, you didn't clearly explain what you meant when you said,   'its only spontaneous .... sometimes like i didn't know myself fully and sometime i lose control of myself?...'  If this is just about the crying then that's absolutely fine, it's good actually. If there is something else, then let us know and inshaaAllah we might be able to advise.  As for the crying itself, because you are in a difficult situation it is normal to worry and feel tearful. Try to always redirect this emotional energy you have to Allah, like you are doing when you ask Allah for 'another chance'. Like other bros have said, it's good to cry in front of Allah. When you cry over your sins after making tawbah, it's one of the signs that your tawbah has been accepted.  Also, right now you will feel really anxious waiting for the job reply, inshaaAllah it will go well but do not think for a second that PMO will relieve your stress. That's a trap I've fallen into too many times.  Thank Allah that you've been 10days without PMO that's really good bro.

MuslimNoFap,3amq5w,brotheromar1337,8,Sun Jun 21 19:13:13 2015 UTC,"Salam alaykum Omar,  First of all, I must say I am quite impressed that a young individual such as yourself is embarking on the NoFap journey. I see a bright future ahead of you insha Allah (Amiiin).  The thing is.. The fitan that you speak of is something we all experience in the West. So we can relate to that. I am curious to know whether you have friends that you are comfortable with? I think it's important for young muslims to have a fun time during your youth. Maybe by doing fun activities with friends we create a halal outlet for our stress and other negative influences on our mood.  Please be conscious of what you are doing. You are texting with a ""hot"" girl and then you relapse. That should tell you something about the severity of yhis contact (i.e. it's a red flag). I think we Muslims need to find a good balance in keeping good relations with people (that includes girls) in general, while at the same time maintaining our Islamic appearance. And what is this Islamic appearance? Well.. why don't we study the Shamaail, or the biography of the Sahaba. Perhaps by reading more into this we will instill a sense of pride of being a Muslim.  Look, I'm gonna be honest with you. Chances are that you won't get married in the next few years. I know.. it sucks to live in the modern world with parents and their high demands.. But be realistic about it ok? At the same time, I do regret that I didn't get married when I was 20 or 21. So maybe you can be different in that aspect.  Brother Omar, be strong.. and keep praying to Allah ok? Keep letting us know how your progress is. Insha Allah we will mutually support each other in this subreddit.  I leave you with the protection of Allah.  Ya Hayyu Ya Qayyum. Bi rahmatika astageeth (du'aa for the first 10 days of Ramadan).  :)"
MuslimNoFap,3amq5w,ShiningStarx,3,Sun Jun 21 20:52:59 2015 UTC,"Hey there! I'm 17 too! Glad to see another young person doing this!  Don't worry too much about the relapse, make tawba and try again.  It took me roughly a year and a half of trying to quit to get where I'm at right now. So just remember it takes time, and effort along with lots of dua.  Insha Allah you'll be able to win this battle.  Anyways, just a little bit of advice you need to go at this a 110% don't even leave a 1% chance that you'll come back to this as you'll eventually fall into the trap again. What helped me quit was making a promise to God to never do this ever again. I was sick of it, it had ruined so much of my life. So I just called it quits.  If you want to read a bit more find my recent post on here when I reached 60 days! I've got some tips that may help you!"
MuslimNoFap,3amq5w,Fayadh56,2,Sun Jun 21 21:10:29 2015 UTC,Your story is just like me. I also left islam 2 year ago.Thinking that I dont need Allah and Islam to quit this addiction. I dis everything in my capacity to beat this addiction but I failed horribly... Here I am after two years with no progress at all.....  I found on nofap sub that athiest were able to quit this addiction. Then why in the world I cant? I then realise For them this world is their paradise.Read their stories.They do nofap and then Zina...This ia their paradise.  But for us brother this is a prison.Therefore we cant see our paradise right now. If only we were capable of seeing our paradise then I am sure we would be motivated as hell to overcome this addiction...  Therefore brother fight this.Make new habit to break bad habits. Pray 5 times daily.To build willpower and self control. Make dua in soojood. Keep on fighting bro...keep fighting

The first is the fasting of the awwaam, just abstaining from food and drinking and intercourse. The second is that of the elite, which includes abstaining from sinning with the limbs (not listening to something bad, not touching that which is haram etc.) The third one is that of the super elite, and that includes fasting from every thought which keeps one away from remembering Allah!!  Start reciting Qur'an. Like our beloved brother IsaUwais said.. why would you expect to feel more spirituality.  Keep the strength brother. And keep your tongue moist with dhikrullah."

Start your goal to finish the Quran this month if you have not.   Memorize Qur'an and duas.   Pray voluntary salah.   Make a lot of dua.   Watch online lectures and read Islamic books especially tafsir this month.   Pray more salah at the masjid and pray more salah there.   Try to go for as much taraweeh as you can.

I fast in the mosque and stay there until tarawi7 are finished around midnight, I think it's impossible for me to watch something bad after all this spiritual time I spend in the mosque.  For the day, you can read Quran/sira...etc or at least something positive. You can also set up a dhikr routine like 1000 subhanalah/hamdullilah... And even if I'm too lazy to do anything I can't watch something bad bcz I'm afraid my fasting is not gonna be accepted so you need to be precautious about your fasting brother, ramadan is not only food and drink, there is a hadith than even eye do commit zina.

Email me if you are confused at CanadaGuyBND @ gmail.com  Go to the mosque or get in touch with brothers who are also doing no fap through skype or google hangouts, message me if you want to get on to those groups because if it gets boring you can talk to someone and just joke around if you want to do that."

Additionally you could look into bayyinah TV by Nouman Ali Khan to try and learn some arabic at a nice pace.  Hifz is a good idea, I generally find it hard to stick to it unless I do it with a friend, perhaps that's something you can look into.  Perhaps you could try and take up a zikr routine. That could be another 30mins-1hour of your day.  If you do watch TV though, I think it would be best to fix a certain number of things that you will watch. Don't watch anything more than that.

Lately i have also been quite horny. Normally its when I'm feeling lonely or stressed. I've not found anything quite so helpful as abundant zikr and keeping a busy but comfortable schedule. If you find your habit is trigger based, try and figure those out and try to work around them/deal with them. If it's more an issue of omg I can't walk out of the door without fantasising. Remember to control your gaze and try to make zikr whilst you look away to keep your mind off fantasies.  HasbunAllahu wa ni'mal wakeel :) Allah suffices us an what a great Guardian He is."

When I started making regular zikr (and taking a shaykh), even just 20mins a day, I found that I went from pmo e'rry couple of days to a more weekly/fortnightly thing.  I'm not sure, is something stimulating your urges? Are you controlling your mind? Fantasising is zina of the mind, I don't think it's halal breh. We need to be strict on our thoughts as well."

The solution is to do zikr. I did some zikr today when I got the urge to masturbate. It worked alhamdulillah. My brain is quite used to fantasizing though. I have even went as far as writing erotica for a period of time and posting them online. Stopped it when I realized that it was a much bigger sin than watching porn. I still get the urge to write porn from time to time. In Shaa Allah I will never go that far again.   PS: Revert for 6 years? Are you me lol?
MuslimNoFap,3a5cqb,yosef94,2,Sat Jun 20 12:50:56 2015 UTC,"lol that inception though.  Yeah fantasising is really hard to tame. I still haven't got it completely. I can control my mind when I'm out and about but worst thing is when you want to fall asleep but can't. I'm not 100% sure how to deal with that one. Probalby zikr again, but sometimes the zikr can stir your heart enough that it'll keep you awake as well xD"
MuslimNoFap,3a5cqb,TheRocketPilot,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:24:53 2015 UTC,Can totally relate with fantasizing while trying to sleep. I normally read a book or watch a movie until I feel sleepy.

For me, I have stopped touching myself in the bed since I try to keep both of my hands under the pillow at all times and never lie on my stomach. I have heard that if you lie on your stomach in bed, shaytaan rides on your back (or something like that). Makes sense given how easy it is to M by lying on your stomach.  I think just rushing to make ghusl and praying fajr would work.  If you can remember the dream too strongly then do something halal that you enjoy to distract you. Maybe exercise and shower again."
MuslimNoFap,39iend,IsaUwais,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:52:43 2015 UTC,Solid advice. I would definitely avoid laying on my stomach once you got a good streak going. From experience I wake up and I am in a half asleep daze in the middle of the night then start rubbing myself on the bed. Luckily never done it enough to consider it edging but I imagine getting to the 30 day plus mark it would be difficult.

Imagine that you are crying in His presence. In this way I pray you find Jannah.  If you look at the Prophets (AS) you will find that sometimes when they make dua they are just talking with Allah, not always asking for things. Open your heart to Him, cry in front of Him, ask if you need.   ""And what is that in your right hand, O Musa (Moses)?"" He said: ""This is my stick, whereon I lean, and wherewith I beat down branches for my sheep, and wherein I find other uses.""   When Allah asked Musa (AS) what was in his hand, Musa could have simply replied 'My staff' but he went on to explain the things he does with it. Simply enjoying this time that he gets to speak with His Lord.  My dear brother, know that when you talk to Allah with tears in your eyes and love for Him in your heart, there are few things quite so beloved to Him.  :')"

Find your ""happy place"" of memories and accomplishments and compliments you received in the past and tap into them.

Been sober for 111 days. My goals are to conquer this addiction and fix my inner wounds and issues that caused this addiction and also to heal and restore my marriage with my wife who has been deeply affected by my addiction.

A very traumatizing event occurred about three months ago which devastated my wife and broke her heart--finding out about the addiction and the things I've done to act out.   Basically I created a disaster with the mistakes of my past that have to do with this devilish addiction and I'm working to better myself and do whatever I can in my power to save our marriage and redeem myself and help heal her heart. Make dua for me.

The only time I realise that I'm not fapping is when everyone around me tells me I'm being rude and hurting people by making fun of them. I hate it but that is the only time when I have to fap to keep myself from escalating and it is the biggest waste of my little time - time I could spend with my parents, time I could spend running, time I could do something else.  Am I in shit cause of this - yes. But you know what I'm starting to see the worst demons in people and I hate it.  So, OP are you sure you don't want to fap? Then start working. I know for a fact that you are the laziest bum in the world and face it, you are doing nothing worthwhile. Because if you are really doing something worthwhile, you won't think about this shit.

MuslimNoFap,38vpfy,fikriyusnizar,2,Sun Jun 7 05:51:34 2015 UTC,"Bro... Allah doesn't hate you.   I get that you want a better life for you and your dad, but it's not this life that you should be aiming for anyway. Allah doesn't love people who are rich more than people who aren't.  In fact on the day of judgement, the poor people will generally enter Jannah faster because rich people need to take account for all of their spending.  I just wanted to share something my dear brother showed me about Musa's mother (radiyAllahu anhaa):  ""How many times have you prayed for something, only for the exact opposite of it to happen?   How many times have you wondered why God seemed to give you the polar opposite of what you were asking?  Think about the mother of Moses. She must have been trembling, frightened, trying to figure out where to hide her son to protect him from certain death by the Pharaoh. Trusting God, she follows the guidance and casts him in the river.  And you'd think he'd be directed far away from Pharaoh; assume that God would answer the prayers of Musa's mother by taking him far away from his potential murderer.  And yet what happens? Moses is literally DELIVERED to the palace of the Pharaoh.  Doesn't that seem like the opposite of what his mother wanted?! Her heart must have felt like it had been ripped out- the Quran says emptied- as our hearts sometimes do when we experience the worst, despite what we thought we were doing right for the sake of God.  Yet it was through delivering Moses to the palace that he was raised exactly where he needed to be to liberate the Banu Israel and continue to be a hero for us today. And it was through that very action, too, that his mother got her son back.  Sometimes, in our lives, we plan and we pray and we feel like we're being slighted over and over and over again. But don't doubt His master plan. On the outside, it may seem like you're being delivered to the palace of the Pharaoh; you may wonder why, you may become angry, you may even want to give up.  But in reality, perhaps your being delivered to the 'palace' is just one step forward towards being united with your loved ones, with your purpose, and with your life-long legacy.   ""...But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. And God Knows, while you know not"" (Quran).   Maryam Amirebrahimi"""

MuslimNoFap,38vpfy,IsaUwais,2,Mon Jun 8 23:44:39 2015 UTC,You don't have to ask for something everytime you make dua you know. Sometimes you can just raise your hands and talk to Allah. It's really cool. just imagine that your are sitting in front of Allah and just talking to Him about what's on your mind. Don't think that any issue is too small.  Try not to get stressed about the dunya my bro. Allah does not even have to give you anything. Don't feel entitled. Just try to become closer to Allah that's all you need to do in this life. It's true that we are sinners but Allah loves forgiving so don't let that get you down too much right now either. He can pull you out of it. Keep trying and don't give up :)
MuslimNoFap,38vpfy,stopfappingman,2,Tue Jun 9 03:52:22 2015 UTC,Everyone has problems. Maybe Allah likes it when you remember him and when you get too much stuff you stop. Maybe you need to be more grateful to Allah for all the things he has given you.

Did you ever experience any comfort? Did you happen to get any luxury?’ He will reply: ‘By Allah, no, my Rubb (Lord).’ And then one of the people of Jannah who had experienced extreme misery in the life of this world will be dipped in Jannah. Then he will be asked: ‘O son of Adam! Did you ever experience any misery? Did you ever encounter difficulty?’ He will say: “By Allah, no my Rubb, I neither experienced misery nor passed through hardship”. (Muslim)  Be patient brother and remember that with each trial that you patiently bear your rank in jannah is elevated.Keep your sights on al-akhira and if you do that you will surely attain success in both this dunya and the everlasting life next.Allah loves you therefore he's trying you according to His wisdom,so that you attain success.  And for those who fear Allah, He (ever) prepares a way out. And He provides for him from (sources) he never could imagine. And if any one puts his trust in Allah, sufficient is (Allah) for him. For Allah will surely accomplish his purpose: verily, for all things has Allah appointed a due proportion.(65:2-3)"

Since I have my phone always with me I write whenever I feel the need to do so. Sometimes I write just a few lines and sometimes very long paragraphs. I have already written over 700 pages.   I write everything down, I describe what I did that day, I write about how I feel, about my plans, fears etc. You can write whatever you want, you are not writing for anyone but yourself.   When I feel extremely depressed, reading my journal helps me a lot, because then I realize that I went through similar difficulties in the past where I thought that there was no way out but Allah gave me a way out, this gives me hope that the difficulties I am facing now will also end.   A journal helps you to track your progress. When I read what kind of a person I was just 2-3 years ago, I am feeling much better knowing that I am no longer this person.   And a journal helps you remember your life. I regret that I didn't began journaling when I was a kid. If you don't write you forget almost everything."

Just like if you spend too much on dunya, your akhira will suffer. Also, make sure you have a hobby or something to fill your time. Stay away from triggers like you stated above.

Have you ever enjoyed watching the sea? Meditation (or Fikr) is key in our recovery I think.   But this whole approach of only focusing on Islamic knowledge and Ulama is too destructive in my view.

You just need to reduce your conditions to 2-3:  1) A woman 2) A Muslim 3) The level of her Imaan (and even that, if you are desperate you can be lenient with)  Don't be fussy, go find one.   EDIT: In the meantime brother you need to cut the urges off before they really get started. I have heard Shaykh Hasan Ali as well as others mentioning zina of the mind. When you start fantasising and thinking lustfully about women, this is a type of zina, just like M is zina of the hand and P is zina of the eyes. If you don't let these thoughts touch your heart, then you will find it much easier. The trick isn't to not have the thoughts, it's not to indulge them (i.e. not let them touch your heart).  The only way to make yourself so strong that you can cut it off at this early stage (i.e. before the fantasy touches your heart) is if you keep your heart occupied in Allah's zikr. Try to always think that even though I am walking on this earth, my heart is with Allah. And may He give me the tawfeeq to reach this station also."
MuslimNoFap,38b3o4,IsaUwais,6,Wed Jun 3 12:42:46 2015 UTC,No marriage is not a solution at that stage. A pornaddict can't distinguish between the natural urge for women and the urge for porn.
MuslimNoFap,38b3o4,nofapnofap123,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:27:33 2015 UTC,"What if he spends his whole life watching P once (or multiple times) a week? Should he never get married?  If you are having a problem with shahwat then shuyookh generally advise you to marry, I've never met one who said to me, 'No you need to cure yourself from this addiction first, then you can marry.' Rather the advice is to get married as soon as you can. Scholars I have asked myself: Ml. Abdur Raheem Limbada (EDIT: just remembered he told me to do this after I finish studying, but I think that was because at the time I had intended to study at Dar-ul Uloom Bury), Mufti Abdur Rahman ibn Yusuf. If you need more I can ask my friend who's been telling me to get married for a while now. He watches a lot of these videos regarding controlling the shahawaat.  If you're getting urges when you're married you just need to wait until you get home. It's got to be a lot easier. I'm not saying it will solve every problem. Even some people who are married still watch P, but having a wife provides a halal outlet for you when these urges stir.  EDIT: The only reason I'm not married is because my desire is perverse. May Allah cure me of it, else my path is to live alone other than in His company. If I can reach Him before I die then what wonderful company that would be :)"
MuslimNoFap,38b3o4,IsaUwais,4,Wed Jun 3 14:11:24 2015 UTC,"Right now marriage will not solve his addiction. If he enters marriage while sticking to pornography, soon he will not be interested in his wife since there are ""other hot women looking better than his spouse"".  No one is prohibiting the brother to get married. But it's not the solution to his addiction."
MuslimNoFap,38b3o4,ShiningStarx,2,Wed Jun 3 14:36:29 2015 UTC,"IDk maybe you guys are right, I'm just passing what shuyookh have told me. I can understand what you are saying though. What I say is not simply my opinion, this is the general advice I have taken from 'ulama. If you are also basing your statements on the advice of ulama then please can you name them, I would like to learn more to deepen my understanding of this condition.  A lot of people in the secular nofap find success by spending time with real women. The only halal equivalent to that is to get married. Like I say I can understand what you're saying and on some level I agree, but to suggest that it won't even help his condition..?  There are numerous evidences encouraging us to marry in order to control the desires :  {Let those who find not the wherewithal for marriage keep themselves chaste, until Allah gives them means out of His grace.} [Al-Nur: 33]  Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him) reports the Prophet (pbuh) to have said, ""O you young people! Whoever can afford marriage should marry,[6] for that will help him lower his gaze and guard his modesty (i.e. private parts from committing illegal sexual intercourse, etc.). Whoever is not able to marry is recommended to fast, as fasting diminishes (his) sexual power"".  [Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim]  Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reports the Prophet (pbuh) to have said, ""There are three people whom Allah will surely help: a warrior in the cause of Allah, a slave who wants to free himself by a payable contract and whoever seeks chastity by marriage.""[5]  [Narrated by At- Tirmidhi]  I've made two replies now, I hope this doesn't suggest I'm trying to be confrontational,in fact I've read posts of both of you brothers and for the sake of Allah I love you both dearly and make dua for everyone on this forum. I'm only bringing this up because I'm kind of surprised that people don't think getting married is the solution. I mean, do we think we know better because we are actually involved the sin? Or maybe we are just apprehensive of marriage in general? alhamdulillah I've spent quite a bit of time around 'ulama as I used to teach in one maktab and I'm studying an aalimiyyah (weekend intensive course). Getting married is common advice. I've never heard anyone suggest that getting married wouldn't help.  If you guys still think it's not a good suggestion I will leave it there. I'm just passing what I thought was good naseeha from those who are more knowledgeable and have years of experience guiding people out of this sin. I can see you brothers are involved in these self-help programmes, inshaaAllah I will give it a look. I'm thinking about fortify but I'll have to pay being +20 :( Also, I'm trying to see a counsellor regarding these perversions. May Allah bless you in your efforts."
MuslimNoFap,38b3o4,IsaUwais,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:44:45 2015 UTC,Well it's because when you are addicted to porn and masturbation your ideas of women and sex are  perverted.   And also if you get into marriage solely because you need an outlet for your desires and don't understand that there's so much more to marriage it can be miserable.   Our brains need to be rewired by quitting and we need to be mentally prepared for marriage as a whole.   May Allah SWT make it easy for us.   Ameen.
MuslimNoFap,38b3o4,gentleservant9,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:53:21 2015 UTC,"""A lot of people in the secular nofap find success by spending time with real women.""  Well that is only because they look for new women all the time. After P, the mind looks for new women, because that is what it is used to doing. Now in our case, we only have one woman, and we have to change ourselves before getting to marry that one woman. Now yes, we can marry four wives, but I don't think that is very possible anymore...lol"
MuslimNoFap,38b3o4,yoyoyo404,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:45:12 2015 UTC,lol jzkAllah for replies guys. Helped put things into perspective. I think my own P addiction is more psychological then lust-crazed. I am intending to see a counsellor about it. I can understand why if someones desires are constantly for different women then mariage might not be the best.  Allah bless us all with abstinence
MuslimNoFap,38b3o4,IsaUwais,2,Fri Jun 5 08:27:38 2015 UTC,"In my personal experience, my inclinations to certain types of women change after watching porn. I become more attracted to certain physical and behavioural characteristics because they're more common in porn. It skews one's perspective towards the carnal over all other considerations. Based on this and what others have said, it's often a while before such attractions begin to subside, which may lead to bad life decisions in choosing a spouse.   Yes, getting married provides a halal outlet, but it should not be the only reason for getting married. We're not just sleeping with the person, but spending our entire lives with them, and will possibly raise a family with them too. Choosing a life partner requires a clear mind, free from a porn-induced bias. The refractory period to clear one's mind varies per individual. I can't provide a suggestion on that, but merely a warning about the existence of such an issue.  As an exercise, list what you want in a partner now. Now, think back to a time before you ever watched porn, and try and remember what you would have wanted in a partner back then. I know it's definitely changed for me. Especially that I put a lot more stock in physical appearance now than I did back then, and certain acts that I would have found disgusting back then are now on my mind when I think about marriage. Thoughts of those acts has definitely dwindled with abstinence from porn, but my attraction to certain physical characteristics is still taking much longer to change."
MuslimNoFap,38b3o4,FreedomFromNafs,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:24:28 2015 UTC,"My brothers, marriage in my opinion can be a solution, and maybe cannot be a solution, it depends on the individual. Perhaps it's the vast range of novelty and variety pornography brings that cancels the relief  that would be provided by a spouse. Or what if a spouse is key in your reivery process? Allah knows best. These are not easy issues, to be fair. But one thing is for sure, if you strive by changing yourself while fasting (it's very important to listen to our beloved messenger, Muhammad may Allah's peace be upon him, who told us to fast), because Allah certainly did not burden us with something we cannot handle."
MuslimNoFap,38b3o4,FreedomFromNafs,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:38:42 2015 UTC,"Just proceed with caution now that you have the knowledge. Marriage may be part of the solution, especially in the long term. But be very careful of considering it as the solution, especially in the short term."

MuslimNoFap,389629,Sake99,8,Tue Jun 2 18:38:52 2015 UTC,"Brother, I know how frustrated you must feel right now but you have to control your emotions or otherwise Shaitan will use them against you. I know that in such situations the last thing one wants to hear is „be patient, be patient“ but patience is really the only solution. You have to realize that this is a test from Allah. If you are patient Allah will reward you in this world and the next and he WILL take care of all your affairs, he will give you a good job and a woman who is better than the one who rejected you. You have to put your trust in Allah. Allah gave you his word:   „And surely what comes after is better for you than that which has gone before. And soon will your Lord give you so that you shall be well pleased.“ (93:4-5)  „Verily, with every difficulty, there is relief: Verily, with every difficulty there is relief.“ (94:5-6)  Whose word is truer than the word of Allah? He never fails to fulfil his promise, but you have to fulfil your part. Put your trust in Allah and Allah will take care of everything. I want to share 2 Du’a of our Prophet s.a.w with you that ALWAYS helped me no matter how difficult the situation was. I remember times of extreme depression where everything seemed to fall apart and I just couldn’t see a way out, I said these Du’a over and over again and eventually Allah took care of my affairs. From one moment to the other Allah gave me relief, as if nothing happened. Say these Du’a with sincerity BELIEVING and KNOWING that Allah will answer your Du’a and I give you my word, that your problems will be solved:  اللَّهُمَّ رَحْمَتَكَ أَرْجُو فَلا تَكِلْنِي إِلَى نَفْسِي طَرْفَةَ عَيْنٍ ، وَأَصْلِحْ لِي شَأْنِي كُلَّهُ ، لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا أنْتَ  allaahumma raḥmataka arjoo, fa laa takilnee ilaa nafsee ṭarfata ‛aynin, wa aṣliḥ lee sha’nee kullahu, laa ilaaha illaa ant  O Allah, it is Your mercy that I hope for, so do not leave me in charge of my affairs even for a blink of an eye and rectify for me all of my affairs. None has the right to be worshipped except You.   اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنَ الْهَمِّ وَ الْحَزَنِ ، والْعَجْزِ ، والْكَسَلِ ، والْبُخْلِ ، والْجُبْنِ ، وضَلَعِ الدَّيْنِ ، وغَلَبَةِ الرِّجَالِ  allaa-humma innee a‛oodhu bika mi-nal-ham-mi wal-ḥazan, wal-‛ajzi wal-kasal, wal-bukhli wal-jubn, wa ḍa-la‛id-dai-ni, wa ghalaba-tir-rijaal  O Allah, I seek refuge with You from anxiety, and sorrow, and weakness, and laziness, and miserliness, and cowardice, and the burden of debts and from being overpowered by men"

MuslimNoFap,389629,gentleservant9,3,Tue Jun 2 19:36:18 2015 UTC,The comments have been awesome advice alhamdulillah.   I just wanted to note that very often converts come to Islam because they didn't find true fulfillment in their life.   Let's not think they were able to live life to the fullest and we aren't able to.   Following desires doesn't lead to happiness.   Alhamdulillah we have been given the guidance to live the best life which is in submission to our Creator.   May Allah SWT keep us all patient.   Ameen.
MuslimNoFap,389629,IsaUwais,3,Wed Jun 3 05:01:28 2015 UTC,"45 days is amazing bro. Well done. We need to focus on Allah all the time and not try to fulfil our needs from anyone other than Him, your heart will not find rest in anything but His zikr.  Congratulation on graduating bro. Like with most degrees, it is hard to find a relevant job. I know somebody with an engineering degree from UCL that couldn't find anything. Alhamdulillah he went for teacher's training. Now he teaches maths, inspires young muslims, he got married and has an apartment.  Keep trying to get married, this is the easiest way to fix this. Don't give up. Unless you're impotent or struggling with homosexuality you really don't have an excuse to say 'I can't marry'. Keep trying, it will be easier if you get an income.  Get closer to Allah for He is the only way out. Brother Borscho mentions this dua a lot which I like:  O Allah, it is Your mercy that I hope for, so do not leave me in charge of my affairs even for a blink of an eye and rectify for me all of my affairs. None has the right to be worshipped except You.  When we have such a recognition of Allah, that we realise we are His with every blink, then I pray He will save us. May He help us to reach that station of iman also, for without His help we can achieve nothing. Try and stay constant with an amount of zikr everyday, a Shaykh can help you with this.  As a revert myself I can tell you that 'living life to the full' is thoroughly empty. I've turned to this religion knowing with my intelligence that Allah is worth more than my sexual desires. May He help us to realise this with our hearts with every blink."
MuslimNoFap,389629,Paul_teh_cat,3,Wed Jun 3 12:40:41 2015 UTC,"Brother! Come to this as you come to anything, with patience and with prayer. You are certainly not alone in any struggle. We, your brothers, struggle with the very same things. The job hunt, rejection by friends or women, DO NOT lose sight of the akira for this dunya. It is not worth it. InshaAllah, you will find your way. InshaAllah, we will all find our way. Certainly, the worst thing to do is wallow in self-despair! Allah swt will make you a path when you think there can be none."

My first streak here was as close as yours, it was 48 days then I relapsed....I tried again and the second one was 15 days then I relapsed. The 3rd one was 5 days and then I RELAPSED!  and here I am, I was so close to relapse today and yesterday. I know your pain pretty well, experienced it many times, what I tell myself that if I relapsed I will be stronger next time and I won't re-do the same mistakes!   Learn from relapse and embrace it! it's better than blaming yourself and self-hating it! Ramadan is coming, you did a great job with these 45 days. if you started today and ended ramadan clean you will have more than 45 days :).   I wish you luck and may Allah assist us in our test."

Now this is a strange claim that I'm making but our shared troubles unite us in ways we can't explain.  First, know that without failures, we would never relish in success, and know that failures are DESIGNED to show us what we CAN be. Brother, we are here for you and know that there is only ONE ROAD AHEAD in this battle. Either you can quite and give in to yourself. What will happen then?  Would you be at peace, knowning you could have fought a bitter battle with this sin (where EVERY SECOND FOUGHT is recorded with Allah as a good deed?), and one day one, or would you be at peace doing whatever you want and going beyond the bounds?  There is only ONE WAY ahead. 45 days is better than 40 days. 45 days is better than 30 days. It is better than 10 days.  10 days is better than 9 days. 1 day is better than no day at all.  Our growth is incremental brother. Allah will help us if we help ourselves, and this means BEING COMMITTED to this war. Be happy with those 45 days Inshallah, and move on."

Many of those who went on 3 week, 4 week, 10+ etc understood that the cravings can be surreal, but we live another day.

After you cut these from your life it will take a while for you to re-align yourself with Allah. Also try to make sure you are cutting back hard on TV, games, excessive whatsapp etc. This is all dunya. The dunya can not save you from the dunya.  I've noticed that often when I cut back on dunya, my nafs will lash out and seek PMO after a few days. I think Allah has brought me out of this phase now. Now I'm trying to make Him my focus. I want my heart to be with Him and in His zikr all the time. May Allah help us get there.  Try not to even indulge the thoughts. I know that if I let even one thought touch my heart then it will be too difficult to avoid PMO. Once the thought hits your heart, it will consume your every mental faculty. Rather than being the slave of Allah you gradually start thinking like an animal.  Make Allah the focus. It's ok if you miss the mark soemtimes, but never stop aiming for Allah's closeness. And He is the most Merciful, Compassionate, Gentle, The One that will turn back to you again and again."

MuslimNoFap,380fte,ShiningStarx,3,Sun May 31 22:53:47 2015 UTC,"Keep praying even if there is no khushoo'. The aim of your ibaadat is not for you to feel good inside, it is to please Allah. Shaykh ibn Ata-illah said something along the lines of:  Do not become dejected if you do not find the presence of Allah in your ibaadat. It may be that He is so pleased with you that this world can not contain the reward He wishes to convey to you.  It might be that Allah is so happy with the effort you make in His way that He prefers to save your reward for a time when the veils are lifted from your heart and you can truly appreciate it.  The fifth paragraph is upsetting to read :(. If you wanted an easy life then you should become a kaafir. We make statements like 'Oh Allah, we worship none but you'. If we make such statements do we think that Allah won't test us to find out how true that is?   If we look at our hearts, is it only Allah that we find therein, or have we tainted it with lustful fantasies? Sometimes after I reflect on watching P I feel like I have essentially made ibaadat of some pretty lady on a screen. My eyes open wide, my mouth ajar, it's like a dog staring at food. Rather our sight and mind should be focussed on Allah.   Please specify what you mean about muslims being negative and sectarian. I have not felt this myself. If it is the group of people you are hanging out with, you may consider finding a better group of friends who think about Allah instead of thinking about the problems with the dunya.  You say that you haven't found a healthy alternative to PMO. Bro I know you watch cartoons and stuff but you should try and give up everything dunyawi. I know that your nafs will say that, 'I am allowed to relax sometimes', but we sinners are in such a state that we can not afford to indulge our nafs in things which encourage ghaflat. Movies, facebook, games, these all make the nafs uncontrollable. At first it might be more difficult, but it will continue to do so only until Allah becomes our constant focus.  You have quite an intense life it seems. Remember that uni is just for you to earn a living, not to get some awesome job. The only thing which you have a right to get stressed over is your own tazkiyah and reaching Allah. Everything else is transient. The aim of life isn't for you to become rich.  I've reached 35 days before by filling my spare time with anime. Brother, I prefer the 7 days I'm on right now where I have only Allah, a level of studies that doesn't stress me and my family and friends.  Do not despair. Allah still loves you so long as you keep making tawbah. Everytime you fail try to reflect and make a change. InshaaAllah eventually you will be successful. We need to have the right intention, to please Allah, then we need to adjust our lives so that is our main focus. Don't add distractions to that focus.  And may Allah help me to leave those dunyawi things that I am involved in also. I still watch 2 TV shows which I should quit. InshaaAllah I will keep you in my prayers, remember me also :)"

Well first thing to note is that we are never safe :) Even yesterday i got visual stimuli from a porn movie that i watched like a year back! I didn't get the urge to watch porn! but i was quite shaken that thinking that they still could haunt us! This is a fight brother! Alhamdulillah after like 60 days i slowly moved over from the porn addiction! means alhamdulillah i didn't get strong urges to watch porn! but when you abstain it for longer periods! a full cloth women waving her hand could even turn you on! even someone nice walking by and u didn't see her face or anything still could give you butterflies in your stomach! These things were never happened to me in my journey! So in order to cope with these things you need to practice lowering your gaze! I can tell you that's what saved me from relapsing! and i can tell you brother if i lose the guard for one day! means if i did check out few hot girls on the street! even i really didn't want to do that! I really really do feel bad about it! and its effects do hit me hard!   So Allah SWT. has told us ""Tell the believing men to reduce [some] of their vision and guard their private parts. That is purer for them. Indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what they do."" (24:30) and that's our weapon. This is the best way that we could save ourselves. Insha allah! may Allah SWT. bless us all"

So not down things you want to do in the month of Ramadan! once you abstain you will feel peaceful inside! and you also will get to know how awesome it is to obey your creator but not to shyatheens and your own nafs!

Allah WILL accept your Du'a, he promised to answer the Du'a of the one who makes Du'a and whose word is truer than the word of Allah? You just have to trust him.  I am giving you 2 Du'a from the Prophet s.a.w that ALWAYS solved my problems. No matter how difficult the situation was, when I said these Du'a over and over again Allah gave me a way out:  اللَّهُمَّ رَحْمَتَكَ أَرْجُو فَلا تَكِلْنِي إِلَى نَفْسِي طَرْفَةَ عَيْنٍ ، وَأَصْلِحْ لِي شَأْنِي كُلَّهُ ، لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا أنْتَ  allaahumma raḥmataka arjoo, fa laa takilnee ilaa nafsee ṭarfata ‛aynin, wa aṣliḥ lee sha’nee kullahu, laa ilaaha illaa ant  O Allah, it is Your mercy that I hope for, so do not leave me in charge of my affairs even for a blink of an eye and rectify for me all of my affairs. None has the right to be worshipped except You.    اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنَ الْهَمِّ وَ الْحَزَنِ ، والْعَجْزِ ، والْكَسَلِ ، والْبُخْلِ ، والْجُبْنِ ، وضَلَعِ الدَّيْنِ ، وغَلَبَةِ الرِّجَالِ  allaa-humma innee a‛oodhu bika mi-nal-ham-mi wal-ḥazan, wal-‛ajzi wal-kasal, wal-bukhli wal-jubn, wa ḍa-la‛id-dai-ni, wa ghalaba-tir-rijaal  O Allah, I seek refuge with You from anxiety, and sorrow, and weakness, and laziness, and miserliness, and cowardice, and the burden of debts and from being overpowered by men  Memorize these Du'a and say them in your salah in sujud, when your head is on the ground, thats when you are the closest to Allah. If you say these Du'a over and over again, knowing the meaning of the words and believing that Allah will answer it, I give you my word that your problems will be solved.

MuslimNoFap,37ipjv,IsaUwais,2,Thu May 28 05:22:59 2015 UTC,"I have heard a Shaykh discussing this. Sometimes Allah opens the doors of mercy for a person, and that person feels like his life is going so well. He feels very happy. He feels like he doesn't need anything more. He has forgotten his dependency on Allah. It may be that your sinning thereafter is an opportunity for you to turn back to Allah. To remember that you are nothing without Him. We can't get through this without His guidance and protection. We can't escape unless we make Him the primary goal of our life each and every day. Eventually I hope that we can make that our goal with each and every breath.  I'm the opposite like the OP. I turn to it when I'm feeling lonely or stressed mostly. It would be good if I could turn to salah or zikr instead but I don't find that helps very much because my khushoo' is not always there. I should do it anyway I suppose.  May Allah save us from our ghaflat."
MuslimNoFap,37ipjv,makingmomentsmagical,2,Thu May 28 01:39:32 2015 UTC,Ameen.   I agree with your post entirely. I think we need to be persistent and seperate ourselves from this world and it's extravagant illusions. If your going for something extra to add to your deen dhikr is the best gateway option imo. I say as its easier and builds khushoo but it has an accumulative affect that eventually will translate into more salah also.  Be Well Brother

There was always copious time for p, tv, music etc but our afterlife keeps taking a back-seat.   I know we have our exams, jobs, responsibilities to ourselves and people but start when eg your walking to uni/shops just say alhamdulilah/subhanallah wa bihamdihi. Better to have God on our minds than those images still residing there.   I'm certain you, alienz225 and us all can do this, given short, sharp, consistent dhikr."

Heres some hadiths regarding such matters: It is narrated that the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about the kinds of waswaas and thoughts referred to in the question crossing their minds. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) replied: “That is a clear sign of faith.” Narrated by Muslim.   And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The people will keep on wondering until it is said, ‘This was created by Allah, but who created Allah?’ Whoever experiences any of that, let him say, ‘Aamantu Billaahi wa rusulihi (I believe in Allah and His Messengers).’” Agreed upon.

MuslimNoFap,36x1gw,Borscho,3,Fri May 22 20:42:06 2015 UTC,"Dear brother, wa 'alaykum salam,  I'd like to start by expressing my concern for you. You sure have suffered a lot, bro. It's sad to read how you already started masturbating before entering puberty. What is it that you liked to do back then besides masturbating? Did you have any hobbies? Did you enjoy playing with other children?  Yes.. the high speed internet connection destroyed many young muslims, who have a potential bright future. Don't blame yourseld too much though. You're not a school dropout, you probably did not commit the actual zina. You're still relatively youngand you're already aware of the consequences of PMO. My dear brother, there is still a possibility to repair your future. You can't change your past too much, so don't look at it too often. Only realize that this addiction will stay with you forever. This enemy of ours, will always stay at our side wanting us back to this dark, depressing, lonely world.   But there is hope, dear brother. There is always hope. And the first step is to realize the Unconditional Mercy and Compassion of our Lord. He listens to every one of us.. So let's become closer to Him by actually talking to Him in our du'aas.. and by worshipping Him as if we are seeing Him.. and since we can't do that, knowing/being aware that He sees us.  Jazakallah.. Welcome to the struggle."
MuslimNoFap,36x1gw,ShiningStarx,1 point,Sat May 23 08:07:52 2015 UTC,"What is it that you liked to do back then besides masturbating?   My childhood was actually pretty good. I had a lot of friends and we used to play outside. I think the real problems began when I began watching porn.   You're not a school dropout   Actually I just failed my A-Levels 2 days ago...But there is still a chance for me to go to University, I have to pass 2 exams.   you probably did not commit the actual zina   I never even kissed a girl on the cheek or something like that. My socially awkwardness is to sever for me to have a relationship.   And there is another problem that I had for my entire life: my weight. I always used to be overweight. That added a lot to my non-existing self esteem. Seeing everybody around me with a girlfriend and now getting married made me even more depressed. I think it was worst when I was in 10th grade. At that time I weighed 110kg, I was extremely unhygienic I had long hair and I used to take a shower only every 2 weeks or so. And sometimes I used to masturbate 3 timed before I even got out of bed. At that time I didn't even practice Islam. So I didn't even do ghusl after masturbating. Man..when I write this I actually feel much better because I am now in a much, much better state.   I looked at myself and felt like a complete waste: bad at school, overweight, addicted to porn. In the year 2012 I lost 30kg which was the biggest achievement of my life so far. And I began praying 5 times a day alhamdullilah. 3 years later I am still fighting my weight problem and my addiction. I still have to lose 17kg and I do not want to relapse until I have reached this goal. When I achieve this, I will be a new person and I will be able to marry.   May Allah allow us to achieve our goals"

I started uni this year and I've discussed all of these issues with a counsellor. I find that it has helped. In truth there is only so far that you can go with non-muslim counsellors, but sometimes talking about the depression is extremely helpful.  If that's not an option for you, perhaps you could talk about the depression to a close friend. If not then talk to an aalim that you like.   I feel like a munafiq for offering this advice. We should be of such a level that we can talk to Allah about this and it would suffice... But I am weak in my iman. May Allah save us.  Another thing I've though of is that whether or not you agree with Tablighi Jamaat, I'm startign to think that going out with them for 40days could solve my problem. There are a lot of reputable ulama that support them. You can search for it on askimam. I know that a lot of salafi sscholars are very public on youtube and the internet about there dislike for this group. I've been around these sort of people for the past couple of years and I haven't noticed any actual bidat or bad practices. It's something to think about bro. I'm thinking too."

MuslimNoFap,36ggqd,fikriyusnizar,1 point,Tue May 19 05:02:34 2015 UTC,Waalaikumsalaam. You can do it bro. Keep making Dua to Allah. Stay steady on your Salah. This Fapping addiction thing is a struggle. One day we will overcome it Inshallah

MuslimNoFap,36ggqd,zainuu163,1 point,Tue May 19 10:17:46 2015 UTC,"I know that feeling. I am struggling in the same way as you are. I made it 20 days without PMO and it was extremely difficult. I have very strong depressions due to personal reasons, this made the struggle even more difficult. I don't know how many times I cried during the last few weeks. The whisperings of Sheitan are severe, he keeps telling me to relapse: ""Do it, it doesn't matter, your life sucks with or without PMO. You haven't fapped for so long but still everything is as bad as before you stopped fapping."", a few times I was just about to relapse but Allah gave me the willpower to resist. Sometimes I lost hope that Allah will answer my Du'a, today I also lost control of my emotions while making Du'a and got extremely angry due to frustration but then I realized that these thoughts are coming from Sheitan. All of these struggles and depressions we are going through are a test from Allah, he wants to see whether we are patient and grateful to him or impatient and ungrateful. We must not give up due to our depressions. We have to carry on and expect the best from Allah. If we don't give up in our struggle and in our Du'a Allah will reward us in this world and in the next. We have to suffer a few weeks, maybe a few months, but after that we will be happy."
MuslimNoFap,36cjyy,_Azrael,2,Mon May 18 08:16:22 2015 UTC,It's amazing that after relapse you didn't binge and are focused. Stay strong bro! It will take some time but with strong commitment you can get rid of this addiction

However, the habits and methods I've built, such as going to the mosque for all 5 prayers, reading the quran daily, working out, meeting friends, and I've also tried fasting some days when the urges get too strong, as that was the advice of the prophet. So far that's what has been working for me and the urges are almost non existent now. Moreover, make lots of dua!"

As a muslims you must take a strong decision to never ever go back to pornno matter what happens. And start some useful hobbies, or sports or gym. Whatever is available to you. But its the strong will thats needed the most"
MuslimNoFap,36aj1m,axadify,1 point,Mon May 18 12:56:25 2015 UTC,This is a good point. Many posts on NoFap are upvoted which talk about girls leading us to believe that is the only way when it's not.

For me its Baking. When I am baking I don't think about Fapping. In the end its gonna come down to deep down not wanting to Fap. I relapsed today. A mate suggested I ride a bike to the Masjid and pray Maghrib. Could of done that but chose to Fap. There is ways around fapping always we just got to want it in our hearts. Deep down enough. I would recommend looking into Sufi practices too. Especially Muraqba.

One would say why? because normal sexy images, or softcore porn was not enough to stimulate me anymore, so i moved to more and more hardcore stuff, but their was no limit. So I have to start NoFap.  I guess if you are addicted to PMO for a long time, then you need some time to heal yourself before an actual women is enough to arouse you. Because our brain is rewired to PMO and that's what a PIED is. That's the same reason I'm not willing to go into marriage without a complete reboot. I don't want to make my SO feel that its her fault, if I'm not getting arousal after marriage.  That was my experience, but I hope married brothers can give you some better advice in this matter."

Also sometimes we dont want sex...Sometimes your brain will be satisfied with the foreplay and stuff... It takes time and keep on doing that a man should do with his wife. and everything will be fine
MuslimNoFap,368v6y,zainuu163,1 point,Sun May 17 12:16:19 2015 UTC,"I'd like to give a slightly different opinion from others here. Their reasons about your problem also maybe true but I'd like to point out that I've heard people not being able to have sex even months after marriage due to temporary ED because of nervousness. Yes ED happens mostly due to psychological reasons in younger men. I've read about such problems in many Islamic online forums, this I guess is a common problem in our community because of prior communication gap(not saying it is a bad thing) and sudden obligation to get intimate with the person you've just met which leads to nervousness of different levels and types.  I'd suggest you to be patient about it and communicate with your wife about it in as much intimate depth as you can in a way which is comfortable for both of you which will help you get aroused for her igniting the required desires. The psychological transition about your feelings for her is important and needs to be addressed since you mentioned you feel like a big brother/caretaker for her which maybe leading your brain to think that you'll be doing something wrong to her by getting intimate, get rid of that feeling first gradually, see her as your halal partner with whom you're allowed to be intimate with and at the same time have that feeling of being the one who completes half her deen and vice versa."

If you want you can make an oath but that can become a slippery slope. I broke many oaths in my youth which I still haven't repented for. So perhaps just talk to Allah and make your intention firm.  InshaaAllah I think I will try my own advice :P  Also, Shaykh ibn Ata-illah said: Whoever thinks it strange that Allah will pull him away from his desires, or cause him to leave his life of heedlessness, then he has surely denied the divine power.

To overcome what you are feeling you need to step back and see whether or not you are sincerely repenting.  Are you repenting thinking that you are probably going to do it again in a few days?  That is insincere.  Sincere repentance means that you feel remorse and make the intention to never return to the sin.  You must then take necessary measures such as keeping yourself busy, reducing triggers, and strengthening your iman and taqwa through learning more about your deen, increasing in worship, becoming involved in the masjid etc.  If you end up repeating the sin after that then make sincere taubah again and never despair of the mercy of Allah SWT.

Spend about 7-8 hours Baking and a small amount of time doing theory. Deliver Baked goods to family or go get some thing to eat. Get home and chill out. Some times I exercise. I am starting to get into a studying routine too. Generally I am slack on the other self improve things besides Bakery school. Although I am on day 14 of No Fap right now.

So yes, have an open dialogue about this with the youngsters. There's something about the love and honesty that comes when you talk about an embarrassing subject such as pornography or masturbation. It shows the person who is talking to you about it is willing to risk the embarassement or sounding silly just because they do care about you."

Its more important to be AWARE of what you are thinking. Forcing yourself to think something else only makes you think more about the thing you are trying not to think about. Just give yourself time. Be AWARE of how a stimulus triggers the thought process. If you want to change HOW you think you must first be aware of the present way your mind thinks.   You cant move a rock if you dont know the weight and dimensions of it.   Hope that helps.

He told me he's unable to write the message on his account, but was able to view it:  AssalaamuAlaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatahu,  The situation that you have described is one that requires carefully advising both the mother and the father and supporting both to come to a healthy solution. What your father did is incorrect and he committed a lie, and your mother has the right to get mad at this point, however we strongly advise you to prevent a divorce from occurring but also assuring that your father realizes that you do not tolerate it.   You have to talk to your father and ask him what he thinks he is doing. Allah knows best what he could be doing, he might be pursuing a second wife for all that is known, which is halal for him, however the means through which he does it is not good, and secondly him lying that he is divorced is also not good. But supporting JUST your mom is not going to help you in the long run. Your DAD needs support too, and there must be a reason why your dad is engaging in this behaviour. Perhaps your mom is not providing the way he wants her to provide. Remember, in conflict, there are typically two wrongs. It is wise for you to ask and listen to them first. And listen to both your mom and your dad.   This does not mean confronting your father, rather this means telling your father you are upset with what’s going on and ask him what the situation is and that you are willing to listen to him. Your Father probably has complains about his Mother, but it is better that he complains to you instead of your mother, because your mother will react in a negative way which may anger him and issue him to cause a divorce.  However, you must do so going forward, knowing that Allah swt is going to help you and you need to do this to the best of your ability and take matters in to your hands and try to this immensely needed good action of providing naseehah."

But brother,EACH and EVERY time i repented to Allah I can honestly say that miraculously I was able to undersatand my studies again and work hard again.Today is Jummah a special day alhamdulilah so we must utilise it.To be motivataed to study do not think of this dunyas rewards, rather purify your intention by inwardly telling yourself that you will study hard to improve the condition of our ummah,so your parents are proud of you,so you may show the people the hardworking nature of the muslimeen.(this way Allah will help you and if you die you will get rewarded according to your intention-because even if we reach einsteins level in this temporary dunya,this will not help us one jot)But if we strive for the akhira Allah WILL hand over the akhira AND dunya to us our hearts will be purified and thus we will achieve true contentment  Abu Dawood (1048) and al-Nasaa’i (1389) narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Friday is twelve hours in which there is no Muslim who asks Allaah for something but He will give it to him, so seek the last hour after ‘Asr.” [Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani].   ""(Iblis (Satan)) said: ‘By Your Might, then I will surely mislead them all. Except Your chosen slaves amongst them (i.e. faithful, obedient, true believers of Islamic Monotheism).’” (Quran, Saad: 82-83).  ""Verily! He (Satan) has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord (Allah)"" (Quran, An-Nahl: 99)  Thus we must believe in Allah,remain steadfast and PADLOCK our camel(by preparing ie when am i most likely to do this sin and how can i prepare for those time).This is the only way and a very very rewarding one."

Watch this video, it helped me a lot:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoP-1DseJkY  And we Muslims tend to forget that we have the ultimate weapon. A weapon that can solve EVERY problem that we might have: Du'a. Sometimes we underestimate the power that Du'a has. We have to realize who it is to whom we are making Du'a to, the one whom we are asking to give us. He is the owner of everything in existence. He sees everything, he knows everything and he has power over everything: nothing is happening except when he allows it to happen, he has the ultimate control. He has the power to give you whatever you want. And the more you ask him the more pleased he is with you. Here is a very good lecture on Du'a:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYgBOpHtqzE&spfreload=10  And here is the book:   http://www.allahsword.com/ebooks/Supplications/Dua%20The%20Weapon%20Of%20The%20Believer.pdf  You should read this book, I am sure it will help you a lot. And there are 3 Du'as of Rasulallah s.a.w that I want to share with you, 3 Du'as that helped me a lot when I was in depression:  اللَّهُمَّ رَحْمَتَكَ أَرْجُو فَلا تَكِلْنِي إِلَى نَفْسِي طَرْفَةَ عَيْنٍ ، وَأَصْلِحْ لِي شَأْنِي كُلَّهُ ، لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا أنْتَ   allaahumma raḥmataka arjoo, fa laa takilnee ilaa nafsee ṭarfata ‛aynin, wa aṣliḥ lee sha’nee kullahu, laa ilaaha illaa ant   O Allah, it is Your mercy that I hope for, so do not leave me in charge of my affairs even for a blink of an eye and rectify for me all of my affairs.

Therapy if you can or Sex Addiction programs like Purify Your Gaze etc to help you identify you inner issues.  -Talk to a trusted friend or someone who struggles with the same addiction like us here on NoFap and get an accountability partner who you speak to regularly to help and encourage you and advise you to instill good habits in your life that help you steer clear of negative thoughts and impulses."

MuslimNoFap,34u1is,duksa,1 point,Tue May 5 01:14:31 2015 UTC,Well actually i say no! Alhamdulillah! i don't have urges to watch porn! its sometimes about lowering the gaze! that is the weapon alhamdulillah Allah gave us! because when you abstain for so long anything could trigger you! but that doesn't mean that it triggers you to watch porn! when you abstain for 10 months which means that there is lot of fire in you! and also the sensitivity increases! anything could turn you on! so you need to practice lowering your gaze! Whatever that i do which displeases Allah is something that i should avoid! that's why i say this is a continuous fight! but it gives so much peace inside when you know you can control your sexual urges somewhat with the help of almighty Allah SWT.

MuslimNoFap,34u1is,gentleservant9,2,Mon May 4 19:01:35 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear  about the relapse brother but the truth is, you are dealing with an addiction and it is something you have to admit to yourself and once you come to grips with it you have to take the necessary steps to recover from the addiction.  It can't take willpower alone to fend off relapse and coming on MuslimNoFap is helpful but it isn't enough either. You have to take things one day at a time, set boundaries and be accountable for yourself, how you manage your day and most IMPORTANTLY how you manage your feelings.  Relapses don't just happen. You set yourself up to relapse little by little. You have to take a hard look at the relapse and how it occurred and what gap or hole you left open to allow it to happen.   Alone in your room with a computer? Can't do that anymore, have to leave the computer out in the open or if not that set up porn blockers and get an accountability partner to have the password. Put blockers on your cell phone as well. DONT take your phone to the bathroom, no exceptions. Set up a ""no technology curfew"" at night. Have a bedtime that you follow everyday, no exceptions, lights out at 10 or 11.  Boundaries need to be set up and you have to get in touch with your feelings and get to the root cause of the problem which has to do with intimacy, self-esteem or a wound from the past that you haven't really dealt with.  Allah make it easy on you brother. You can live to fight another day like the rest of us."

MuslimNoFap,34eqrg,philasify,2,Thu Apr 30 15:22:18 2015 UTC,Salam brother!  I hope you are well and may Allah make you stronger every day as you go along this path.   I personally have not tried PYG but My brother tried this program and he did not feel the money he had to spend worked out for him. I think why this is so expensive is because its one of the first addiction related muslim websites and so from that perspective its understandable to see why it would cost that much. I think it will get cheaper as more and more muslims begin to realise their addiction. PYG is entirely self run and until a community gets behind it and supports it it will most likely be like that. May Allah make PYG and the likes of it successful and easy to access for all muslims. Ameen.
MuslimNoFap,34eqrg,ShiningStarx,1 point,Sat May 2 08:33:19 2015 UTC,"I figured that was also the reason why. PYG is a pioneer when it comes to a program like this for the Muslim community.

MuslimNoFap,34eqrg,thealphamaleone,2,Mon May 4 14:41:19 2015 UTC,"Salam alaykum,  I registered for the Breaking Free program and the 6 months of coaching/councelling that came after it. While the Breaking Free program was very interesting and gave me a new perspective, I must say that these tools as well as the one-on-one coaching sessions did not change my state nor my willingness to change. In fact, the last time I spoke Zeyad, he told me that I hadn't made the decision yet to stop PMO. He even told me to write on my paper why I want to quit and take that piece of paper with me whereever I am.  Most coaching sessions were about changing one thing and then journalling about it. For example, one time I had to journal every day which person loved me (so each day I had to mention someone else) and why am I being loved. Another time I was told to look outside the window and tell him whether the world out there was a scary place. He is a good coach in general, but the online method doesn't work for everyone. He did motivate me to open up to my ustaz though, which was a great breakthrough (which led me to tears and then he comforted me and said I was very brave for doing so. He gave me motivation and spirit to help me).  Honestly, for some people it's better to attend a meeting of Anonymous Sexaddicts, because when you meet people in person and open up, that's when you're most vulnerable.  Sometimes I look back and wished I was more committed back then.. Oh well, we learn from our experiences right."

My advice is too remember that feeling a few seconds after you relapsed, just write your feelings at that moment then when you get the urge to fap, look at what you've written. I am going to try this and hopefully it will help me in controlling the urge. Honestly it is just a few seconds of temp pleasure after that its 100% regret. I am so determined now to beat my 14 day streak from today."

MuslimNoFap,33xods,axadify,3,Sun Apr 26 17:08:12 2015 UTC,"I think as long you're both healthy then you're naturally compatible, craving human contact or simply sex is natural for everbody unless you have some serious psychological/biological issues, if this what you mean then your concern is legitimate and need to be expressed before the marriage take place.In my country a medical check up is obligatory.   For the rest as long she is not a mental case and she take her religion seriously then for me it's good enaugh, you just hope for the best. Love is not something you find like the west teach, Love is built by compassion and patience from both parties. ""sexual compatability"" is just hormones that fade away fast after marriage, ""the values system compatibility"" it's what matters the most"
MuslimNoFap,33xods,mentaleur,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:49:47 2015 UTC,"Islamically , sex outside marriage is forbidden. Coming to sexual compatibility , it's all about communicating with your partner during sex and working out what positions are best. Take your time to explore each other. I had an arranged marriage too btw"
MuslimNoFap,33xods,Tachyon1986,1 point,Mon Apr 27 05:27:07 2015 UTC,"brother, sexual compatibility in Islamic marriages of couples who have no sexual relations before marriage is an exaggerated issue, we are humans at the end of the day and we are wired to express our sexual desires in this case lawfully, it may be a bit akward in the beginning but just get close with your spouse, open up, laugh, hang out, and most importantly COMMUNICATE!!!!! before you know it you guys will be very comfortable and you will know what you guys want in sex to which there will be growth in improving one's sex life, this matter is not fixed and sexual compatibility will usually become heightened, just be patient and go easy on yourself,   I think finding a decent spouse who possesses excellent qualities in matters of ethics and character is much more graver issue, because these matters are hard to change and present further obstacles in maintaining a healthy marriage. Not impossible though, im going off topic :P all in all sexual compatibility is flexible and can most definatley be found after a marriage"

Also, we should consider it the same sin in both! Switch from movies to animated ones and if possible go watch YouTube series about the bravery of our grand Muslims! Media and TV is the main reason where we are! they invaded our houses silently and they started dumping garbage (talking about movies and haram stuff).. May Allah protect our houses from such channels! Change to Islamic channels, and good channels that don't reveal half naked women! It's a double-edged weapon that needs a great attention like the internet!"

""Allah knows the deceit of the eyes and all that which the hearts conceal."" (50:19)  u should avoid the tv altogether......  Unreal pictures are more dangerous than real women.... Women in tv wear so much makeup and lot of lightning effects are put together to make the video attractive.... The videos are  aimed to destroy u ......  Brother tv corrupts our ideas... Change our perception about the world and takes away the trait of haya from us....i think u should give it up in hope of purification frm allah"

You're screwing up your brain even more and making it less likely of having a real relationship because real women will never be as attractive as the ones on TV/Internet. If you want to spend the rest of your life looking at a screen, you may do so. If you want to get married to a REAL woman and have a REAL relationship, then stop PMOing and start lowering your gaze.

MuslimNoFap,33ukcc,jihadnafs,1 point,Sat Apr 25 19:41:44 2015 UTC,"You are right brother! That how the shitan starts. First , he let's you think that looking at women is a normal thing! And then you gave up on thinking to lower your gaze! Then this sin will lead to another which is PMO. Later, he will make you give up on PMO and lead you to zina! See how smart is he? He is patient with us! Until we reach Shirk = Become non Muslim! So, my brothers we better work on the things that we do daily and think of them as a major sin! Otherwise, our mind and nafs will make it look small!  Don't give up and fix your thoughts and habits! Replace the bad ones with good ones! Listen to the advise from our prophet and scholars! When someone asks what do you want from me? You should reply back ""To have taqwah in other words, be afraid of Allah and worship him in the right way""  May Allah make us among Al Tawabeen ""التوابين"" ، Al mukhleseen ""المخلصين"" ، ""Ahl Al yameen أهل اليمين and ""المتقين"" Al mutaqeen."
MuslimNoFap,33ukcc,LiveLikeTraveller,1 point,Sat Apr 25 20:23:29 2015 UTC,yeah bro... shaitan is making  this sin small in front of our eyes...... i think we should elevate the status of this sin to the level of the sin of shirk.....  shaitan dont tempt tempt us to pray any idol directly..... because he knows we will reject it straightaway.... because we fear the fire... and also the of sin of shirk has such an elevated status in our hearts....  Like this we should elevate the status of the sin of PMO.... In reality while on PMO we are obeying shaitan.... Equal to workshipping shaitan.....  At that time we are not obeying allah and workshipping allah....... Shaitan is very cunning......  May allah protect us all... Ameen

A lot of awareness being cultivated about the true Islam. Halal food, brotherhood. Brought along my non Muslim cousin too. He loved it. I am also appreciating Halal Supermarkets today. Around my side of town we got a couple of small ones. Not always quality groceries and expensive prices although they do their job. When I get a craving for meat I go there.

I've been working out and taking cold showers for a long time, and making my salat since I converted, but I got an accountability partner, started memorizing more Quran, and finally, started regular fasting. After relapsing, I just kept adding more things to prevent it from happening again. Almost all of it was suggestions people make all the time on this subreddit.  May Allah protect us all and strengthen our taqwa. Let's not forget to make dua for all of the ummah for whatever they struggle with."

I've made the intention to go the entire war even though my average survival streak is about 6.5 days for the last two years. How do I plan on going that long? Simple, my motivation is that if non Muslims can do, then I sure as hell can do it. I'm not letting anything get in the way this time- it's my pride on the line. I have to show Allah that I'm worthy of being a Muslim. Each time an urge comes, I remind myself that I'm not going to loose and see a non Muslim  get ahead of me. If the non Muslim has more motivation to quit this addiction then I have motivation to please Allah and not disobey him, then I'm not worthy of being called a Muslim. That has been my greatest motivation so far. I urge you to try it out."

MuslimNoFap,33kocz,LetsFightFapping,2,Thu Apr 23 08:16:50 2015 UTC,"Brother Assalamu Aleykum! Yes it is true that getting married is the halal way of releasing our sexual tension. But is it the only reason we should marry someone?!   I guess insha allah you need to do lot of research before getting married. I am married and it was a proposal, one of my relatives thought the particular girl is suitable for me. But before i ever met her i did lot of research on marriage! and got to know why you should follow certain ways! I asked certain questions about deen and alhamdulillah i felt that she will be the one me. TBH she has increased my deen. We still don't live together because i have just finished my studies. That was supposed to be my story! and brother again! Alhamdulillah i moved over the addiction before my Nikah! and i researched a lot before my marriage! i guess everyone should do that commitment and should understand what really marriage is. Do not think marriage will help you to move over an addiction it won't! you need to get over it before the marriage and May Allah SWT grant you success. /r/Islam is also a good place of asking such a question. They will suggest you dating sites and insha allah you will have a much comprehensive answer."
MuslimNoFap,33kocz,nofapnofap123,2,Thu Apr 23 08:55:53 2015 UTC,"Walaikum Salam bro!  I definitely understand what you are saying, and I have thought about this. Do I want to get married just to release sexual desire? No, while it would certainly help in that sense that is not the only reason I want to get married. I just want to finally settle down, I feel like I am ready for this stage in life where I want to be with a good girl Insh'Allah.  I am just rubbish at knowing how to find the right girl, even if we get married in a year, 2 years, 3 years from now!"

MuslimNoFap,33kqbm,alienz225,1 point,Thu Apr 23 09:31:50 2015 UTC,Assalamu Alaikum  May Allah bless you for giving good advice.  I think this is great advice for those who are on a high level of iman and have at least practiced praying 5 times a day and are not addicted.   However for people on nofap who mostly struggle with small daily tasks this high level advice can prove to be quite daunting and reduce the self esteem for one. Advice is proportionate to the person its being given to. As for someone on 11 days of nofap I would not recommend for you to start praying bare nawafil for every mistake you make....you may end up spending your whole life doing just that then. Because right now you most likely feel you have a lot of mistakes (as I do). Stick to the basics my brother. Allah will forgive. Just ask Him. He is the Most Gracious and the Most Merciful. Thats all we need.
MuslimNoFap,33kqbm,zainuu163,1 point,Thu Apr 23 09:57:55 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I've been extremely addicted and away from Allah for the longest time. I finally got close to Allah 3 years ago. Each time I relapse, I try to feel terrible. If I don't feel terrible, I know that my heart has hardened and I need to do something quick to change that which is to turn to Allah by doing extra deeds like praying nawafil or giving charity. This is also recommended by the Prophet (SAW). If you don't feel bad you are committing it, that is worse than eventually quitting the addiction but never feeling remorse for disobeying Allah. The whole self-esteem thing is what the non-Muslims have come up with because they don't have Allah. Allah knows us and our problems, but at the same time, we need to turn to him and show him that we care about his prohibitions and the limits he has set. This is my experience from being an addict since 9-10 yrs old and now almost turning 22.   Also the fact that the doors of repentance are always open, I sometimes think that this addiction is a blessing. It keeps me coming back to Allah as a beggar and staying humble. Knowing that all of Adam's children are sinners, at least I turn to my Lord. Allah loves those who repent. So keep repenting. Allah will convert every sin you commit into a good deed IF you ask Allah to forgive you, inshAllah."
MuslimNoFap,33kqbm,alienz225,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:27:37 2015 UTC,You are right bro....I have tried many things. For example Non-Muslim says that addiction is caused due to lack of self love.....If u dont love yourself ..theb you will be addicted to one thing or another..Well I did try that and tried to lobe yourself. They say if you  relapse then you must forgive yourself......thats insane. Its Allah who forgives..who are we to forgive ourself.. The theories and stuff they come up with to explain things are absolutely insane.
MuslimNoFap,33kqbm,mentaleur,1 point,Thu May 14 17:51:11 2015 UTC,"Well they are right to some extent. You have to love yourself in order to save yourself from hell. If you truly care and love yourself, you will try your best to save yourself from hell and therefore stay away from sin and obey Allah SWT. The opposite is if you don't love yourself enough, you say that I don't care if I sin. I deserve hell anyway. I'm a terrible person. Which is a trick of Shaytan deceiving you. It's important to recognize your sins AND your good qualities. But don't become obsessed on your good qualities and forget about your sins or you will become arrogant. There has to be a balance with humbleness. May Allah bless you, my brother."

MuslimNoFap,33itp2,yoyoyo404,1 point,Mon May 11 19:31:05 2015 UTC,"Basically I was using a counter to use the whole NF mindset of streaks for my salah, to make myself more constant. Now it did motivate me but unfortunately I was still missing one salah every other day. I realised that this happened because I tended to delay salah, so it will happen that eventually I'd miss at least one salah, soon or later because of this tactic. So I made it simple for myself, now not only missing a salah, would be considered a relapse, but even not reciting a salah in its first hour would be considered a relapse. Therefore, I am don't delay salahs anymore and hence I don't miss them anymore."

Fast as the Prophet (pbuh) had suggested.  if you can meditate (mindfulness style) then do it: it help develop your control over your thoughts and emotions and also develop self-awarness so you can see urges coming from miles away and dodge them.

His focus is for people to have an understanding of the Arabic language so they can attain a better understanding of the Qur'an since so many subtleties are lost in translation.  And he can connect with the youth in the West.  It's $11/month but so worth it.  A wealth of knowledge without having to go anywhere.  There is an Arabic lesson series where he teaches fusha Arabic to his 9 year old daughter so it's a series of short easy to learn lessons.  Quran cover to cover is incredible.  It's an easy to understand flowing translation and tafsir of the whole Qur'an.  I love how he also connects things to our daily lives.  You can sign up at www.bayyinah.tv."

My motivation was that i started feeling so shity low and worthless after i have just masturbated..i started to hate myself and even doesn't wanted to exist anymore. Than i thought that i wont do anything that will make me feel such a piece of shit and i decided to move away from porn.  Also I have exactly same feeling being munafiq and i stopped making dua for myself too because i hated my self.  Now I stopped using Facebook.. Stopped using YouTube.. Stopped using music or movies untill i can be mentally stable again. And keep away from anything that can trigger me. Don't feed your eyes anything erotic.  So find something.. Some motivation within yourself.. Maybe for better health or future partner anything must ignite you from within.

Inshallah you will get an answer one way or the other but in saying that don't challenge whatever Allah decrees for you and he alone knows best.   Inshallah things will be fine brother however if your parents don't want you to do this you should probably listen to their point of view and obey them.

QadarAllah wa masha fa'ala, inshaAllah I'll do my best to become more aware of this as I roget some times!   As for my parents I do understand their concerns, however I don't agree that Islam has set the same standards that many cultures perpetuate of lavish and superfluous celebrations , outrageous dowries, or the extensive requirements many parents seek in a partner for their child."

MuslimNoFap,33a92k,BroInNeeed,1 point,Mon Apr 20 21:59:56 2015 UTC,Walaikum Assalaam.  Don't get depressed brother!  After any relapse you will feel bad as you should but make sincere taubah and start again strong.  You have begun taking the steps which is awesome.  Do things that increases your imaan and taqwa like learning more about your deen and staying regular with acts of worship so that this sin becomes easier and easier to avoid.  Keep making dua.
MuslimNoFap,33a92k,gentleservant9,1 point,Tue Apr 21 00:24:51 2015 UTC,Jzk brother. I've been listening to Quran recitation on my commutes which has definitely helped clear my mind. Almost relapsed after I got home as I was thinking I'd completely lost all my sexual appetite. IA one day at a time. I am just so annoyed at myself as I found a really good potential partner but turned her down purely because of what this has done to my level of expectation.
MuslimNoFap,33a92k,HEARMMEROAR,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:46:34 2015 UTC,"Assalamoalaikum brother,if you don't mind me asking how old are you? Brother i was in similar position, and i used to do the same as you do but i realized that i am not a man yet if i am still thinking like that. So i set out to improve my character first and Alhamdulillah Allah ta'ala has given e ease in my journey. ALthough i haven't got an education yet(im 22) and alhamdulillah much has improved. I haven't even figured out what to do...  It becomes an extra burden and becomes too stressful to think about a having a wife when i myself am not where i want to be. Also you will only damage your self confidence because you will keep doing this and then blaming yourself...not very effective. When you stress your capacity to think and act becomes really bad. So my advice brother is that if you have an education and a good source of income, spend some time on yourself.   Firstly work on cutting this addiction off but a bad habit can only be replaced with good habits that's how you beat them.   Secondly if you have the finance you should also spend some of that money on educating yourself in Islam. I would especially recommend learning Arabic so you establish a close relationship with the book of Allah first.   Don't overburden yourself and inshallah things will work out just fine. This way you will become more spiritually enlightened and you will also be mentally prepared inshallah. Give yourself atleast a year or 2 to become really prepared first...  May Allah guide you along the path and give you ease in all your affairs. Aameen."

What annoys me is that one of the reasons I am seeking to get married is to relieve my sexual frustration in a halal way.

MuslimNoFap,333gti,gentleservant9,2,Sun Apr 19 04:00:54 2015 UTC,It's debatable! Usually a relapse mean going back to old habits again! Here what we have communicated to the community is that while not engaging in PMO try to improve your life style and move closer to your creator! one thing i found out in this journey is that when you can control your sexual thoughts! you can have a control of yourself to some extent with the help of Allah SWT. You can dramatically improve your lifestyle by moving closer to your creator! because you no longer have that guilt that you had when you are PMO'ing. I guess its up to the individual to say that there are in or out!  But usually looking at facebook pictures and not praying isn't considered a relapse. But it has serious downsides in Imaan since we want to change our life styles lets practice all of them insha allah! Allah knows the best!

MuslimNoFap,330a52,axadify,3,Sat Apr 18 06:27:17 2015 UTC,I am married brother! But we still don't live together it gonna take at least some six months insha allah! Addiction doesn't go away when you are with a partner! insha allah you need to move away from it before you with them! But yes being with them and talking with them shows you that there are lots of things in the world other than sex! When you abstain for long time you would feel how intimacy is important! because what i feel is that when PMO'ing we didn't feel anything rather than someone's flesh! And different ways of doing different videos turned us on but we even couldn't watch the same video twice! that's the addiction! but here when you are married you only have one woman with you and can you dispose them after one encounter? You can't do that! so real sex is about love and intimacy i think its something that you two define! no body can define its this or this is what is right! but its something clicks for both of you! but when you feel that you don't have that intense craving for certain body parts you feel you appreciate them as a whole! you have moved over your addiction somewhat! So insha allah brother! one year is a pretty good time period to abstain. Allah will spread rahmah on you when you abstain and move closer to your creator if you mind wants to really please Allah and also your spouse insha allah! Allah will help you to move over your addiction insha allah! May allah bless you!
MuslimNoFap,330a52,desiboya,1 point,Sun Apr 19 03:02:52 2015 UTC,Jazakallah brother for such detail insight.  I thought previously that this PMO habbit is due to the unavailability of real partner and once i have a partner everything will be alright. But i guess i was totally wrong.   Now I am trying really hard this time and with Allah's help I'm confident that i wouldn't relapse this time. Somehow i can feel it that Allah's help is with me.
MuslimNoFap,330a52,nofapnofap123,1 point,Sun Apr 19 05:52:53 2015 UTC,Alhamdulillah that's great! make yourself clear that insha allah that you will not relapse at any stage in whatever situation! that mind set really does matter! May Allah bless us all Ameen!
MuslimNoFap,330a52,philasify,2,Sun Apr 19 06:15:08 2015 UTC,"marriage isn't a magic switch for PMO addiction. I'm divorced and was addicted before, during and after Marriage. I never lived with my wife but I went to meet her once or twice a week and my imaan wasn't high enough to quit. I used to think that after marriage I'd be fine but then my brain said you'll quit when your living with her, I never got to that stage but am sure it would have made things easier. But yeah the truth is it's difficult to quit the cycle whether single or married, having a wife in your bed rather than being alone will obviously help  but what really makes things easier is to get a good streak And get close to Allah.   Basically my advice is: Don't delay or depend on marriage for your recovery. Defeat PMO before you are married. Marriage is irrelevant and the disobedience of Allah can and needs to stop regardless."

And so that was a moment in time for me when I had to increase my Iman and realize... well hey, the reason I'm not commmiting zina even though I can is because I love Allah and I will get punished if I don't seek the halal means (which is marriage). And if I do seek the halal means, Allah will reward me.  And trust me man, I'm here for you.

MuslimNoFap,32x4lz,TheLongJourney96,2,Fri Apr 17 13:19:36 2015 UTC,"Salaam Aleikum. Masha Allah 10 days is an excellent start!   I've said it before and I'll say it again. What is helping me to lower my gaze is fasting. Even if you can't make it a regular thing, one day of fasting can help you to exercise a self-discipline you might not realize you have. My newly-found sense of self-discipline carries over on the days I don't fast.   I also think of particular ayat of Qur'an, especially the last two of A-Zalzala (99:7-8) referring to the Final Day:  So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it,  And whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it.  (Sahih international translation)  Full surah Here for context   With these ayat in mind, I can feel better about every little act of good I do and strive more and more to avoid doing bad. I also like to reflect on the order of the ayat. There is a wisdom behind the order of the ayat, and an additional wisdom to making ""And whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it.""(99:8) the final ayah.   The same thing is happening around me, and it is a fitnah, but Insha Allah we can overcome this if we strive in our deen.   May Allah protect us, forgive us, make our burden lighter, make us stronger in our iman and taqwa, and grant us Jannah. Ameen"

If you really wan't to marry him first talk to your parents and then get someone to go engage in this conversation with him.  The only thing is you are  not really acting in control since you want to tell him about this addiction already...yet you are not even married and not supposed to be so close to him without mehrams around...  Just make sure you check your intentions, check your emotions.

When we had the project together, after it was over (1 month long) we realized we are a very good match and he asked if we could talk with the intention of marriage.  I will not tell my parents right away unless i know he is good. then i will tell my parents things get serious.  I understand I sound a bit shaky. I am being shaky and my emotions are out of control. I thank you for telling me this brother, I will keep it in mind.  Jazakallah for the du'a.

First of all you need to understand about the addiction! http://fightthenewdrug.org/ Check this site and you will gather lots of information! why porn is so bad and stuff! Once you abstain from these chat rooms and fantasy porn insha allah you will get a feel about real sex! which is about intimacy but not what porn portrays in front of a screen! Insha allah do not overthink and start the journey! learn more about the addiction! and try to move closer to your creator! may Allah bless you!

I started considering PMO a major sin (one way ticket to hell) instead of just a minor sin as I used to. This really worked for me. My current streak mainly is due to that.  Read content on sub reddits such as pornfree and nofap on a daily basis for motivation.  In case of emergency use the nofap prevention tool http://emergency.nofap.com/ over and over again until your urge is under control.

MuslimNoFap,32keg7,WillOfFire2015,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:34:53 2015 UTC,"I have had a similar problem around the 7 day mark. One thing that really helps is fasting around that time. This streak I started fasting regularly on Mondays and Thursdays and using those days to do more good deeds like worship and helping people so that I get the reward multiplied. I also try to memorize a little Qur'an every day, taking at least 10-20 minutes out of my day on average.   Improving my deen like /u/Sikandar7 said is the best thing I can do. I've begun to see nofap as part of improving my deen rather than the other way around. This makes it a lot easier.   May Allah protect us all, forgive our sins, make our burden lighter, and grant us Jannah. Ameen.  EDIT:I will add that things like cold showers and exercise also help, but they are not substitutes for ibadah and are not as powerful protection against shayateen."
MuslimNoFap,32keg7,WillOfFire2015,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:52:05 2015 UTC,"Cold showers for the win, if you are constantly under stress like me. the PMO will be your ""fake"" way out of stress, which is definitely wrong.   Cold showers make you more comfortable with stress and teaches you to be calm whenever you are feeling discomfort.....try it yourself, because without cold showers you are only counting on your will power and your attitude which may not be helpful sometime....."

Make sincere taubah and start again strong. Try to increase in your imaan and taqwa by learning more about your deen.  Fast if you have not and increase in other acts of worship.  Get involved in the mosque.  All of this keeps you busy with good and makes it easier to avoid sin.  Get web protection and reduce triggers as much as possible.  Remember death and the akhirah.  And as far as the duniya goes, remember that we are holding out so we can experience something infinitely better for us in marriage.  Do you want to compromise what is halal for a few moments of pleasure?  And relieving stress from this habit is a total illusion.  The immediate guilt adds to it.  Hope this helps.

I think it's an embarassing subject for many to talk about though. In my family, we have a tendency to avoid talking about anything meaningful. To just talk about fluff on the surface like how was your day. I don't blame them though, it's probably how they were brought up as well.  I work hard on breaking this habit to just talk about surface fluff in my family. But it is a problem for sisters, too yes.   I believe literature is a form of pornography as well, some are explicit and some are not. At the end of the day, both pornography and inappropriate literature are ways of disobeying Allah swt and ultimately ruining our lives, our imaan and the most precious thing we have - our hearts.   I agree that that by viewing pornography or reading inappropriate literature, we build this idea of what pleasure means and it may be that when you do get married you will not find pleasure in a spouse. This has been one of my motivational factors when entering this journey - so that in the future I will have a healthy marriage."

MuslimNoFap,321z0k,nofapIks,6,Thu Apr 9 22:49:36 2015 UTC,Glad to see you've come to a mindset that has helped you!  What you have pointed out is very true!  I think it takes a combination of both.  And people are motivated differently.  Generally speaking a Muslim should live between hope and fear.  Not being overly hopeful of the mercy of Allah SWT to the point of being lax and not overly fearful and despairing of the mercy of Allah SWT.  Being mindful of reward and punishment is a guiding force.  And Allah SWT knows best.  May Allah SWT keep us all strong.  Ameen.

Last week I fasted on monday and this week I fasted monday and now I'm fasting today as well (thursday). It really works wonders for my sense of discipline. It's that time of the year for me to as a student where projects are  all due next week or the week after and then exams will be taking place but I'm still making time for studying Qur'an. Putting as little as 20 minutes a day into memorizing Qur'an can add up quickly.  May Allah protect us all, keep us on the straight path, forgive our sins, and grant us jannah. Ameen."

MuslimNoFap,31o7ed,Drood007,3,Mon Apr 6 21:06:25 2015 UTC,"This Hadith came to my mind immediately:  'Ubaidullah bin Mihsan Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, ""Whosoever begins the day feeling family security and good health; and possessing provision for his day is as though he possesed the whole world.""  [At- Tirmidhi].  وعن عبيد الله بن محصن الأنصاري الخطمي رضي الله عنه قال‏:‏ قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم‏:‏ ‏ ""‏ من أصبح منكم آمنا في سربه، معافى في جسده، عنده قوت يومه، فكأنما حيزت له الدنيا بحذافيرها‏""‏ ‏(‏‏(‏رواه الترمذي وقال‏:‏ حديث حسن‏)‏‏)‏‏.‏  Arabic/English book reference    : Book 1, Hadith 511  So, you, I and everyone should thank Allah for this every second. Some people are under war starving :( other people can't find a proper water to drink. Al hamdolellah ya Allah for what you have given us.  We should be more patient and we should have trust in Allah of our Rizk and life. You never know, you might be a reason to guide lots of people in your neighborhood. Be patient. This neighborhood might teach you to be more powerful against your lusts and desires.  Always remember Allah's words:  Surat Al Sharh(No. 94):  {6} فَإِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا     {6} So, verily, with every difficulty, there is relief.  I want you to do one more thing, focus on what is positive in your neighborhood and you will be surprised on things you didn't realize they were there.  May Allah help you and make it easy for you."

MuslimNoFap,31nxvh,HEARMMEROAR,1 point,Wed Apr 8 11:15:36 2015 UTC,"Jazakallah brother its Allahs Mercy and love. I made a very sincere intention to quit and i put full faith in Allah azzawajall that this addiction will be a thing of the past and alhamdulillah i am doing great.   As for quitting i honestly don't know. During year 11 and 12 i messed around a lot and got horrible grades.At this age i was way off the path of Islam. Then i did a pathway to go to uni which was six months and so after that i got in and started a degree in Media, I wanted to be a film producer (astagfirullah). I did that for a year but i never gave any assignments in idk why maybe fear? But that one im glad didn't work out. Then i quit and worked and in 2013 i did architecture and after a semester i quit again mainly because i was burn out with the amount of effort into it and even then grades were meh. then i worked and went back overseas with family.  I came back in 2014 and the first half i did nothing then second half i did a few classes in I.T. which was easy at first then the same pattern happened again i finished the smester but after that i quit. Something starts eating away at me from the inside, maybe its anxiety or maybe its fear of falure or both. Its an intense burning sensation its like when i sit down to study i get a thousand different thoughts (what does this mean to me, why am i doing this) but then after quitting i realize studying is probably the best option since i can't do physical work due to back problems as i've just figured out from this new job and it doesn't pay well.  My parents keep saying no one will marry me if don't do something and they will definitely not marry me with this job. On the other hand i am 22 and i live with parents, i fell horrible that i am being a bad example to my siblings my brother especially. I would hate to see him go through the same and i pray to Allah everyday to look after him. He is also growing up and he will need is own room so if i stay here longer my parents will take out loan to buy a bigger house which i don't want them to do! On the other hand if i leave he won't have someone to turn to for help considering i know what school here does to a pure person.   If i do go and study i will be forced to stay at home and they take out a loan for another house plus i have to take a government loan as well which involves riba also. It would also mean waiting atleast 4 or 5 years before i can get married. I do not know what to do! I am in a dillemma :'(.I was hoping to gain an entry into madinah university so that i may be able to study without a loan and allow my brother to take my room and parents don't have to take a loan. I also feel disconnected from Allah lately and my prayers are tough even though i have been praying regularly and reciting Qur'an regularly yet i find my mind clouded by everything.  Sorry for the rant brother May Allah reward you for listening kindly"
MuslimNoFap,31nxvh,gentleservant9,2,Thu Apr 9 10:10:23 2015 UTC,"No problem at all brother.  I would say you should stick with the path you are on if you like it or find something and make an effort to stick with it.  Make dua that Allah SWT makes it easy for you.  It's not practical to keep changing since you are getting older and need a stable job so it is easy to start a family of our own.  Don't be hard on yourself for what you did in the past since its over and done.  And about riba, talk politely to your parents about it if you have not.  Try your best to find a halal way to continue your studies if you decide to.  When we make an effort to avoid what is haram Allah SWT will provide for us.  May Allah SWT bless you and make it easy for you.  Ameen."

Inshallah that's the plan to try and save money and then plan on studying because taking out loan is not an option. Inshallah im sure Allah will provide a way out for me.

Regarding your struggle, you have to cut out triggers.  If you really want to stop this habit you really must make it easier on yourself.  Stop texting this girl.  This doesn't sounds like it's someone you hope to marry so stop.  This is haraam.  It's a source of constant triggers.  You have put yourself on a very dangerous path that can lead you towards fornication before you know it.  It's awesome that you have been able to maintain a streak of 200 days so don't risk relapsing or worse from continuing this.  Learn more about our deen and increase in worship to increase your faith and fear of Allah SWT so it becomes easier to avoid.  I hope this video helps:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LIEq5hUO3U  May Allah SWT make it easy for you and all of us to avoid what is haraam.  Ameen."

MuslimNoFap,31n4eg,LiveLikeTraveller,2,Tue Apr 7 07:25:40 2015 UTC,"well, the right way in Islam if you are really interested in her is to pray Estikhara then ask your mom or someone to tell you about her for first impression then and when you feel comfortable you go to her parent's house and talk to her with someone from her Mahram in the room (he can give you some privacy to speak to her) till you know her with the knowledge of her parents, and you can get engaged to her to know more if it wasn't enough in the meetings. Once you don't have doubts you marry her!  I see it sufficient brother! Don't tell me you have to stick with her years to know about her! We shouldn't play with other girls hearts and fake love if we leave them. Show the real intention from day 1! And be honest with her, and she should be honest as well!  You have to know something as well, there's no perfect girl for anyone, but we try our best to find someone who will meet our expectation in terms of Deen(Morals included), Beauty, Her family, Money (which is not that important to some). Also, the girl can change to whatever you want if you treat her in a good way trust me. I am saying this from experience of some married friends, so don't worry too much, instead you should worry of dating or meeting girls secretly!  Watch Q&A getting married according to Islam from the Deen show (Important: start from 3:15)   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DPUc8rDu4U  Watch this from Nouman Ali Khan: How to get married (but the audio is not that great) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXDvg9YI9-U  Listen to other lectures as well. It will help you brother  May Allah guide us all and help us and May Allah grant you a good spouse brother."

Therefore you should channel it. Secondly I know what you mean when I met my soulmate my libido was really hard and stuff but this is normal and will subside...

MuslimNoFap,31iekn,LiveLikeTraveller,2,Sun Apr 5 12:52:56 2015 UTC,"Walaikum Salaam. I read something some time ago that I cannot stress enough. To give you some motivation to start.   That pornography and masturbation isn't the disease, they are the symptoms. That the disease is lack of outdoor activities, loneliness, boredom, procrastination. That the goal throughout this experience shouldn't be to please others, but the goal should be to become the best man or woman you can be in society. Also, self-control is a suitable long term goal, too imo. Before entering this journey I think it's important to have a long term goal. A motivational factor. Out of own experience, if you don't have a clear goal or motivational factor it'll be easy to relapse. Some really good points were brought up that i advice others to do:   Spend time with friends Be confident in yourself Learn to do things, learn to cook, learn to play a sport and etc. Exercise and try to stick to it Do things you always wanted to do Be omptimistic. Know that better things are coming (Because Islam is the message of optimism).  Try to stay busy gradually by being proactive and productive. Unemployed? Write your resume and go job hunting. Feeling alone? Spend time with friends or start a random convo with another brother in the masjid, etc.   Something I remember still today about that text is that in this journey, you will feel different emotions coming up that you were masking behind  masturbation. But use this energy to do things you enjoy doing except m or p. But to remember it takes time to heal. That you're healing your brain and developing yourself to become a better person."

I don't remember how I found nofap. But from there I found this sub and I think it is better because nofap has many triggers in it. Moreover religion is not welcomed there. And here we can talk about our beloved deen. Except that some trolls can still come here and make fun of our sins.

Just stay focused and committed to your cause, and everything should be fine.   and yes, these temptations are normal :)"

MuslimNoFap,317g0g,nofapic,1 point,Thu Apr 2 17:01:18 2015 UTC,"Actually urges will never leave us. They strike on regular basis. Sometime randomly sometimes with triggers. When we have intermediate goals or we become doubtful of our capability or our conviction weakens, we relapse. So I think we must focus on today. Determine that I will not do it today. Don't look at what I have done or what I will do. Live in the minute you are in. We can't change past, we can't alter future. Only time in our grip is right NOW. And we wont let go today In shaa Allah."
MuslimNoFap,317g0g,Freefromshackles,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:16:49 2015 UTC,Thank you!  Yes taking it one day at a time and living in the present makes it easier.  Jazakallah khair.
MuslimNoFap,317g0g,ShiningStarx,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:45:51 2015 UTC,"Walaikum salaam,  Yes I have experienced this. Thing is, when you do nofap a lot of emotions will come up that you were hiding behind fap and pornography and it will make you realize your mistakes and you will see how reality actually is. Almost like everyone is sleeping and you're awake. Eemotions and urges come and go, you will feel it again, thinking ""come one, one time is not that bad"" but try to acknowledge it, realize the implications if you partake in the action and move on. Much like someone who is on a diet from overeating will acknowledge it, realize the implications and move on. Everytime you move on, you gain a bit more self-control and that is one of the better long term goals to have when entering the nofap experience, imo. To have self-control."
MuslimNoFap,313nkc,AlphaDreamer23,2,Wed Apr 1 19:50:58 2015 UTC,"The point about stress, is so right! I can confirm that.   I am always under stress because of college (engineering college) and the stress just hit me under the belt and it eventually leads to a relapse.  Taking cold showers taught me how to deal with such stresses even though they are hard, but that's the point of taking them :)."

MuslimNoFap,310zsf,JugheadCuts,2,Wed Apr 1 06:38:07 2015 UTC,It is good that you felt this way after relapsing.  This horrible feeling you have should be a driving force for you to start back up strong.  It's not worth experiencing.  That is one thing that has been motivating me.  Try your hardest to maintain the regular salah as it is obligatory and key for our imaan and taqwa.  The shaythan and our nafs pull us into this sin the way you mentioned.  Making us thing we might as well go all the way.  We have to really avoid the triggers.  Do you have web protection like k9 or such?
MuslimNoFap,310zsf,gentleservant9,1 point,Wed Apr 1 11:41:00 2015 UTC,"thanks for the input brother, i will definitely follow up on it. i had k9 but the program does not work well on my computer. it would crash, and i also feel like if i have something blocking me, the more harder it is for me to try and seek pornography. most of my biggest streaks come from when i dont have any filter on my computer."

MuslimNoFap,30xw5n,TheLongJourney96,3,Tue Mar 31 16:28:06 2015 UTC,"I think exams and it's preps are a good distraction from desires. Focus on them. Desires are not like hunger. They come and go. Problem with many of us including me is that we consider them like hunger and an ultimate need and our due right to fulfill them this way or the other. If this assumption was true how could many people on /r/nofap have had so long streaks on hard mode? Then how come many of human beings were able to practice successfully (to large extent) celibacy like monks and priests?   So when desire hits, don't panic and don't try to oppose it. Be calm, get into something else and let it pass by. But don't be friendly with it too. It's just like when you confront a person in street you don't like. You won't get in a dispute with him. What you will do is just gracefully let him go and don't answer if he yells at you. Just mind your own work. So concentrate on performing well in exam. Be sure that masturbation would quite negatively effect the result of exams. May Allah help us. (لا حول ولا قوة الا بالله)"
MuslimNoFap,30xw5n,nofapic,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:57:10 2015 UTC,"Salaam aleikum! Besides fasting and exercise, reading Qur'an and working on memorizing it has been helping me. Even if I only memorize one ayah a day, that's one more piece of Allah's (SWT) speech that can occupy space in my head.   There are also plenty of bodyweight exercises you can do anywhere with a floor and even a quick run followed by a cold shower can kill urges."

MuslimNoFap,30rhbc,gentleservant9,2,Mon Mar 30 13:18:58 2015 UTC,"It is natural to be a sexually active being. What is not natural is masturbation and purposely viewing erotic material. To be honest, I am having a similar problem. The only way to work-around the problem is to lower your desires and later on you will inshallah be rewired against masturbation. Ishallah we will all be cured, but we must put the effort. Trust me, it gets frustrating at times, but I've seen people with situation just like ours but later turn to be cured. May Allah grant us all a permanent avoidance of this habit."
MuslimNoFap,30rhbc,yoyoyo404,2,Mon Mar 30 02:21:00 2015 UTC,The fact of the matter is that we have to resist seeking this high to avoid sin and so that we can really enjoy something better in the future with our spouse.  We don't have to hold out forever inshallah.  The key to make avoiding this temptation easier and easier is to do things that increase our imaan and taqwa like learning more about our deen.  The more imaan and taqwa we have the more we enjoy what is pleasing to Allah SWT and despise what is displeasing to Him.  So you have to understand that this type of exhilaration doesn't belong in your life right now if you mean sexual pleasure and you are single.

This is the time to put your full trust in Allah SWT.  With anything haram like riba, we have to try our very best to avoid it.  Unfortunately Muslims nowadays are way too quick to jump to riba thinking it is unavoidable when it really isn't and once they are in they go all out.  It's a matter of what you put as a priority - is it the duniya or the akhirah?  Should you keep going with the job you have which could inshallah be extended and live within your means with barakah or disobey Allah SWT for some more worldy gains?  Try to explain this to your parents.  And we are allowed to politely and respectfully disobey our parents if they ask us to do haram.  This whole life is a test.  May Allah SWT make it easy for us to pass this test.  Ameen.  And Allah SWT knows best.  Anything I said that is true is from Allah SWT and anything wrong is from my own mistake."

Shitan will always come and tell you that you will become poor to make you commit haram things, and Allah in return says :  “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).   And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allaah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allaah has set a measure for all things”   [al-Talaaq 65:2-3]   Questions that may be private and you may choose to answer:  Can't your college/university help you if you explain to them your financial problems?  because in my university there used to be a section for financial aid where they really understand your case and charge differently, but if you promise them to get really good grades and so and so...etc   Alternatives:   Ask if the college provides vacancies for you to work in to compensate the tuition fees instead of getting into loans.   As for the family part, to be honest my family was kind of like that but al hamdulellah my older brother took the initiative to change it drastically, so I guess you can also guide them and help them in a nice way by telling them why it's wrong or right.  May Allah make it easy for you and help you brother.  Please don't hesitate to ask anything as we are here to help."
MuslimNoFap,30p1jj,Change2081,3,Sun Mar 29 12:55:23 2015 UTC,If you don't pray I would suggest to begin with it. I think the first step should be to learn some basic islam. Who is god? Why do I live? Where do I go? Even if you know: repeat it again! Change your friends if they are bad.  After this : find out how addiction works. And know that it may take some time to fight it. An addict for 10 years can't become sorber normaly after 1 day. So you need patience . It may be the hardest thing you did. But it is worth .
MuslimNoFap,30p1jj,nofapnofap123,1 point,Sun Mar 29 13:42:03 2015 UTC,"That's so nice that you want to be a practicing Muslim. Allah loves you, wants to guide you to His path, wants to forgive all your sins, wants to save you and wants you to live eternity with Him in paradise. Allah says:  وَمَن تَابَ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحًا فَإِنَّهُ يَتُوبُ إِلَى اللَّـهِ مَتَابًا And whoever repents and does good has truly turned to Allah with an (acceptable) conversion. (25:71)  Rasoolullah sallalahu alaehe wa sallam said: من یرد اللہ به خیرا ، یفقهه فی الدین Whoever, Allah decides to do good with, He grants him with understanding of deen.   But we also have to do something. First of all don't say that you are not much religious. Religious is a term of secularism not Islam. In Islam everyone who believes and complies with tawheed and admits his sins is fully religious. I said that because many of us use this as an excuse that we don't have to (let's say) pray because we are not so religious. No brothers/sisters you have to.  Now that it's clear that we don't have a choice of being less or more religious after embracing faith, Islam doesn't say that become a perfect Muslim in 1 day. It happens in steps and with constant effort. This is required from us. We have to improve every day. If we slip, we have to repent and get back on again. Try try again, never quit and be your own judge whether you are doing according to your ability. And ask Allah for help more and more. May Allah give you a good accountability partner and accepts us as his servants."

After then, I continued with my Mon n Thur fasts. meanwhile, while I was doing the 4 days fasts, I went back and read about the addiction both its scientific phases, and harms and Islamic injunctions. more like trying to resensitize my mind after being desensitized by my relapse. May Allah assist us."

MuslimNoFap,30gph9,gentleservant9,2,Fri Mar 27 13:40:03 2015 UTC,If you have not already start fasting Mondays and Thursdays.  Alhamduillalh I can say from experience that it really does help.  There is a reason the Prophet (SAW) recommended fasting for those who do not have the means to marry.  The hunger and thirst reduce the desires and forbidding yourself from the halal teaches you self control.  Fasting in Ramadan is easier with everyone else fasting but continuing it outside of it probably by yourself while knowing it is optional makes you even more disciplined.  And lowering the gaze is of utmost importance.  Temptation begins with a glance.  When you see ads or girls walking around outside fight that second look with all your strength so the desires don't build.  We become prone to falling back to the sin when we let our desires keep building up and we feel the need for an outlet.  Remember that our only halal outlet is in marriage and if we don't stop this habit we risk ruining that enjoyment.  May Allah SWT make it easy for all of us.  Ameen.
MuslimNoFap,30gph9,TomStrasbourg,1 point,Sat Mar 28 02:44:08 2015 UTC,"I've been going through something similar. I've learned that I have to do more than the 5 daily prayers to protect myself. What I've done is increased my efforts to memorize Qur'an, and I tried to fast on Monday and thursday of this week. For some reason the alarm that I set before fajr didn't wake me up so I couldn't eat suhoor and therefore didn't fast, but I think just making the firm intention helped. I'm still going to try to fast those days next week. What gets me dragged down again and again is taking ""that one look"" at something that isn't explicit porn but is still arousing. The less mindless surfing I do the less chance I will take that look and the more I do to increase my iman the less of a struggle it is to avoid."

If you have a better chat system let us know.  I also agree that we have to make a wiki page for this subreddit.  Hadith/ Aya of the is also a good post to be sticked.  Suggestions that need confirmation from moderators:  Another Suggestion is to market this subreddit guys, and I really mean it. I am sure there are lots and lots of people like us misguided and not motivated, so this page has to be marketed in a way and an Arabic one if possible. (I am ready to market it in social media for you guys)  As for the sisters, I suggest making one for the sisters alone (where sisters mark it as private, and one or two can moderate & and check with the girls who wants to join) because they might have things between each other and it can't be discussed between us."

(35)  مَا لَكُمْ كَيْفَ تَحْكُمُونَ ﴿36﴾  what is the matter with you then, how do you judge? (36)  Surat Al Rad (No. 13):  allah knows what every female bears, and what shrinks and swells the womb. and everything with him has its measure.

MuslimNoFap,30670c,yrooney,1 point,Tue Mar 24 20:23:12 2015 UTC,"Aslamo Alykom brother,  I have really wrote back to you yesterday but by mistake I closed the page :( So I am writing this all over again :D  Brother you can do lots of things to keep you motivated , sleep well and have a good diet:  For Sleeping:  1- Install an app that tracks your habit as you track nofap, and actually you can compete with other users who are having the same problem as yours. For example, If you have the habit to sleep late join Sleep group that competes to sleep early. It has really helped me to sleep a bit earlier.  Try out http://chains.cc or Habitbull if you are using android.  2- Follow a new routine where you consider 11 pm super super late, and you will have to turn off everything and go sleep. Ex: Change your phone to Flight mode.  3- Praying on time will help you become more discipline and punctual in life.  4- When you get up take a cold shower and it will give you good boost to stay awake whether you had a good sleep or few hours of sleep.  5- Take a nap during the day if possible for 30 - 45 mins  6- You can also download a smart alarm program that wakes you up within 30 mins of the specified alarm where it waits till it sense you are in light sleep cycle and then it rings.  For diet:  1- Fasting is a great cure from our beloved prophet Muhammad Sala Allahu Alihi Wa Salam for people who are not married like us, but make sure to have a good meal before you sleep or try to wake up for Suhoor to avoid a headache in the morning. Start with Mondays and Thursdays and I know the first week is going to be hard but trust me when you get used to it, it becomes piece of cake. This will reduce your urge so much in sha Allah and improve your health.  2- Follow your habit in an app and check your progress.  3- Eat healthy food and avoid having lots of sugar without exercising.  For health:  1- Exercising in a day gives you a better relaxing and deep sleep. (Walking itself has showed on my phone statistics that my sleep got better)  2- Joining a gym if you need a better motivation  3- When you are sick remember that Allah is cleansing  you from sins! So, you don't want to add a new sin on your plate. Say Thiker and ask Allah forgiveness and sit near your family if Thiker doesn't stop you.  I hope I covered everything that I wrote yesterday :S"

Ask yourself what made you relapse? Note all what you remember down. Start looking for solutions what to do in such situations. Take actions and not words or thoughts. Start following the new routine by installing an app to keep the good habit and leave the bad habit Replace any bad habit with another good habit that is the easiest way to fill that time.

Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5066) and Muslim (1400) from Ibn Mas‘ood, who said: We were with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), young men who had nothing of wealth. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to us: “O young men, whoever among you can afford it, let him get married, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding one’s chastity.

MuslimNoFap,2zwrxy,LiveLikeTraveller,1 point,Mon Mar 23 07:03:03 2015 UTC,I have a question here. Is a Muslim allowed to tell this problem to his real life friends?
MuslimNoFap,2zwrxy,nofapic,1 point,Mon Mar 23 07:53:58 2015 UTC,"If you trust him, and you believe he will help you and not expose you then yes why not?  I have put it on bold ^  But, if you just want to let him know that you do it, and you are not sure if he is going to help, so I suggest not to tell and keep it between you and Allah.   If you think he won't help you as NoFap then I suggest to stick to nofap because I believe this group is enough in my opinion unless you know this person is a really good guy who can help.  Also, if you want to tell him that you do this sin for being proud of it then this is a sin. ( I have good intention that you are not doing this, but to let others be aware of this)  This is for those who tell about their sins and are proud for doing it. (English):  http://islamqa.info/en/3365  I know you are an Arab so read this is a full explanation on when is it permissible to tell your sin:  http://www.alminbar.net/alkhutab/khutbaa.asp?mediaURL=6723  Jazaka Allahu Khairan Akhi :)"

MuslimNoFap,2zwig1,nofapic,5,Sun Mar 22 13:49:39 2015 UTC,I have completed a month today after 6 years. My first and last week were most difficult. I am resuming the March challenge and I want to do this challenge too. But my confidence is a little diminished in the last week. Today I felt I relapsed but it was in a dream. That too hurt my will power. It feels like what felt in the first week. What should i do in this state of confidence?
MuslimNoFap,2zwig1,nofapic,2,Mon Mar 23 08:02:21 2015 UTC,"I've noticed this happens to me when I set intermediary goals. When that goal is reached, pride sets in and I let my guard down and suddenly the urges come back in a rush. In future, if you're setting intermediate goals such as, ""I have achieved something once I reach one month,"" then double your guard when the goal is reached. Do not fall into a false sense of security.  Now that it's happened, you may have an up hill struggle for a few days.    Avoid temptation situations. Keep in the company of other people as much as possible. Avoid being alone. You can't slip up when others are watching.  Make a fully packed list of tasks to keep yourself busy. Done right, you will be too preoccupied to allow your thoughts to stray. Increase your dhikr, salaah, quran recitation, fasting and other good deeds. By increasing your awareness that Allah is watching, you will remember that there are consequences in the next life for succumbing to your nafs and the whispers of Satan. You can't slip up when you remember that your Creator is watching.   These verses have been on my mind a lot lately:    He has certainly succeeded who purifies himself  and makes dhikr of his Rabb, and Salaah.  But you prefer the worldly life,  While the Aakhirah is better and more enduring. [Al-A'laa, 87:14-17]   I hope this helps. Keep looking forward. Don't give up.  Edit: formatting"

The longer I stay away from porn, the less I crave depraved acts. The craving for those wears off within a few weeks and is quickly replaced with, ""Yuck, I don't want to watch that type of stuff anymore."" If you think back on any of your relapses that occurred after a few months, you're probably realize that it was most likely to fairly vanilla stuff before you started returning to the depraved things. So that should not be much of a concern in the long run. The feelings of low self-esteem also diminish over time in a similar manner.  As for loneliness, keep yourself busy with friends, family and other activities, such studies and extra curricular activities. Make to-do lists and strike items off as you complete them. The sense of purpose and fulfillment will dull the feelings of loneliness and you may even forget about them. I've been so busy recently that I haven't had the chance to feel lonely in several weeks.

MuslimNoFap,2zrgul,naiveidealism,2,Sat Mar 21 06:16:29 2015 UTC,"Wa alaykum selam dear Sister NEINfapfemale,  Firstly, in view of Allah it is for both men and women equally bad to perform PMO. Culturally it is accepted to be worse for a woman. Do not let this cultural thought be increasing your regrets too much.  Secondly, many nofappers are male. The male brain does work differently than a female's brain. Even the research on the male brain is quite limited, let alone the research on feminine brains. You are already one of my favorite sisters out there who is a pioneer by doing this challenge. I am proud on you!  Thirdly, remember the following hadith: An adultress passed by a dog at a well; and the dog was holding out his tongue from thirst, which was near killing him, and the woman drew off her boot, and tied it to the end of her garment, and drew water for the dog, and gave him to drink; and she was forgiven for that act.  Regret is a powerful tool for a Muslim to redirect his soul to the Righteous Path. But regret is yet another tool that can be heavily abused by Shaytan. When Shaytan uses regret we get desperate and lose our hope in forgiveness of Allah. We act upon the regret that Shaytan provides us by worsening ourselves. See it like this, Allah's Mercy and Forgiveness let you to see the light of Nofap!   When it comes to your loneliness. Loneliness is not a feeling, but a defense. http://istdpinstitute.com/2013/how-do-you-work-with-the-feeling-of-loneliness/ When it comes to marriage, I face the same problem at the moment. But I trust Allah that if I successfully end this misery, I will be a good lover (also in bed). I know it is not nice, but I even get looks from girls :) We have seen the darkness and we are trying to get out. We are the children of the shadow. We have a lot of experience of what misery means and this will make us beautiful persons whenever we are fully rebooted. Take it as your advantage now! You can do it my dear Sister."
MuslimNoFap,2zrgul,fapdestroyer1,1 point,Sat Mar 21 09:52:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your spirited reply brother, and for reminding me of that beautiful hadith. I think it is much more difficult for women to seek help with PMO because it isn't something that is often treated as a problem for us. In western culture, female masturbation is celebrated as the exploration of ones own body, and in the Islamic community, male porn addiction is most often swept under the carpet, let alone female porn addiction. That's why I am so grateful to have stumbled onto this subreddit; everyone here has been so helpful and kind. May Allah reward you all for your advice! Jazaka'Allah brother."
MuslimNoFap,2zrgul,stopfappingman,2,Sat Mar 21 12:05:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for posting this, your story really resonates with me. I discovered pornography when I was relatively older (around 15) but I have been hooked ever since. I could really relate to the part about you craving more and more depraved things - I feel the exact same way. This is actually my main motivation on my (not very successful) no fap journey - I really want to permanently regain my sense of shame. I want to reach a point where thinking about such things elicits a completely different response for me. And as stupid as this sounds, if I were to get married, I want simple (vanilla) sexual acts with my husband to be highly arousing, I don't want to be this way. I'm not sure I can help you or advise you as I have yet to make any substantial progress myself, but if you ever need support or even an accountability partner feel free to PM me."
MuslimNoFap,2zrgul,Freefromshackles,1 point,Sat Mar 21 16:51:58 2015 UTC,"Stop beating yourself up. EVERYONE who watches porn starts with the basic stuff and moves into the weirder and weirder things. That is normal when it comes to porn addiction, because porn/masturbation is a drug. Just like when a person starts to snort/smoke crack they smoke only a little bit to get high. The more they do it, the more crack they have to snort/smoke to reach that same level of high. Don't look down on yourself for this, instead use this as motivation.   My best advice I can give you is to remove yourself from ALL toxic environments. For me I quit hanging out with the friends who did nothing but talked about sex and degraded woman. I also blocked the internet feature on my phone.   And whenever you feel lonely just take some time out of your day and talk to Allah, tell him your problems and just speak to him. Always helps me.  There is also no scars with the relationship with Allah, he is the most merciful, never forget that."
MuslimNoFap,2zrgul,nofapic,1 point,Sat Mar 21 04:45:35 2015 UTC,Thank you for your advice. I will most definitely start talking to Allah more regularly from now on. It's amazing that I've never actually considered just having conversations with him before. Jazaka'Allah khair brother.

I said so."" The Prophet said, ""You can not do that. So, fast for few days and give it up for few days, r ray and sleep. Fast three days a month as the reward of good deeds is multiplied ten times and that will be equal to one year of fasting."" I replied, ""I can do better than that."" The Prophet said to me, ""Fast one day and give up fasting for a day and that is the fasting of Prophet David and that is the best fasting."" I said, ""I have the power to fast better (more) than that."" The Prophet said, ""There is no better fasting than that."" [Bukhari]   Please don't push yourself beyond limits. Maybe try and diversify and do other good deeds when not fasting? Good deeds cancel out bad deeds."

MuslimNoFap,2zobso,warlock0187,2,Fri Mar 20 06:40:03 2015 UTC,"Assalaamualaikum,  Our imaan is always going to experience some ups and downs which is why we must stay consistent with acts that get us closer to Allah SWT like keeping up with our salah, performing voluntary salah, asking for forgiveness, making dua, reading Qur'an with the meaning, and frequenting the masjid so that our imaan is regularly recharged.  When our imaan grows we gain a greater fear of Allah SWT so avoiding sin becomes easier.  As far as urges go, seek refuge in Allah SWT from the shaytan and try to remember that Allah SWT is watching you whenever you feel like you are going to fall back.  Do you want Him to see you do this disgusting act?  Do you want to compromise your Hereafter for such a momentary pleasure?  What you mentioned is also key.  Do you want to ruin the intimacy with your wife in the future?  Try to remember these things at every urge and inshallah it will become easier to fight them.  May Allah SWT make it easy for all of us.  Ameen."

Remember it's 2 rakas so much lighter on the soul.   Oh you'll absolutely love it. They say it takes 40 days for one to become used to something!   Just try it for 40 days, it is a challenge just like any other.   This is all there is brother, about life. As humans with control, we have the ability to rise beyond the low levels of beasts and influence our desires and behavior. This is breaking the Nafs that wants to sleep, or masturbate, smoke, make zina etc etc etc. if we can't shout at our nafs and tell it to sit the f down, because we own it and it doesn't own us, then how different are we from dogs and pigs?    edit: letters and stuff"

I think the issue here is that you are not prepared enough.What helps me personally is to isolate the problems which lead to me usually returning to this fahisha then to work arround them.E.g I used to use my phone in tthe toilet to carr this out,so I have resolved never to take my phone into the toilet with me again.What I think you should do is to make a similar list of the specific issues which lead to relapse(i.e excessive and dirty tv shows, browsing facebook too much, using pc in a room alone) then another list of how to solve each specific problem(i.e dont watch certain tv programmes, delete facebook account, use pc in family area and dont use pc at night when you're alone with it e.t.c).Be as thorogh as possible and stick to what you have resolved to do as much as you can.Also attend the masjid more regularly as you'll be in arighteous environment, which will impact upon you and increase your taqwa Inshallah."

Your mind is in flip mode right now because it needs it. You have done well going 23 days and this kind of thought process is natural When recovering from addiction. So first step is take a breath. Be conscious of your mind set. Observe how your mind is trying super hard to delve into the illusion of past experiences to get you to do something in the present. Accept that it is a trick of the mind. Come to the realisation that right now at this moment you have choice. And Allah has given you the power to choose goodness or evil. I will pray and i have full confidence that today right now you make the good choice insha Allah and abstain. And not only that but that after it you feel content and happy with your choice. My dear brother you can do this believe me. I have had an addiction for 14 years and not only that,  i have had the addiction while using drugs. If i could go this long you will have no problem my brother.  Im going to make dua for you right now and i have no doubt u will beat this urge"

Shitan is trying to trick you with all kind of thoughts and yes it happens even if you leave it for a long time, but you have to keep fighting.  Advice 1:  My first advise, kill the first thought!  Check this quote: ""Watch your thoughts, they become words Watch your words, they become actions Watch your actions, they become your character Watch your character, it will become your destiny""  Don't let your mind play with you more than one thought a day! If it's hard not more than 2.   Lesson from advice 1: Break it down into pieces brother until these thoughts are gone.  Advice 2:  Close your eyes, and take a deep breath then exhale and remember that you don't want to cheat on your wife. She is waiting for you as well and has the same urge as you, and you don't want to fail and keep her fighting alone.   Lesson from advice 2: You don't want to cheat your wife and let her fight alone. (Mutual feeling)  Advice 3:  Don't stay alone and keep yourself busy with friends, sports, move and walk outside to a place that doesn't trigger you.  Lesson from advice 3: Get myself busy until I feel sleepy  Advice 4:  Quran! Yes, read or listen to quran especially to the verses talking about those who are patient and fight their urges, and what will they be rewarded with :)  Lesson from advice 4: Quran is a cure and a remedy from Allah for my urges, and it reminds us of how Allah the most merciful are going to reward us.  May Allah help us brother!"
MuslimNoFap,2zdx6c,LiveLikeTraveller,2,Tue Mar 17 20:12:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice brother I really appreciate your sincerity.   However I have some advice of my own...you cannot always kill the first thought. You have times when you can and you have times when you cannot. Its what you do when you cannot that counts. There easy and hard times, there are times of low and high imaan.   In terms of breathing exercises...I do that on a daily basis.   In terms of being buzy - well I study and play sports perhaps a lot more than most people and alhamdu lillah I am quite healthy....the nature of studying means I have to be alone often but there's a way to deal with it even when profoundly lonely.   You mentioned the wife - I don't bring my wife in to this at all, she has nothing to do with it. I don't abstain from this for her sake, I do this for my sake, for my future in this life and the thereafter. Connecting my wife to porn will only remind me of porn when I am with her and there is no need for that. As long as I focus on myself and know that only I am truly responsible for my actions then I do not allow my wife to come in to this at all. Say for example I do start doing this for my wife and then I find out that my wife has also been involved in these acts or not even these acts, say she has some other weakness - then I will only find a reason to continue in this...I am more likely to relapse as a result. I do this for my relationship with Allah, His messenger and myself. As long as I keep that in mind, then Allah will improve my relationship with my wife, my family, my friends and those around me by default.   As for Quran - yes this is one aspect I need to improve drastically on when it comes to reading translation so thank you for the reminder my dear brother.   And ameen to your dua.  We need His guidance more than anything.   Wasalam"

MuslimNoFap,2zdx6c,PurifyingMuslim,2,Tue Mar 17 21:57:34 2015 UTC,"Yes I know what you mean brother, the night before I had the most massive urge ever, it was my fault I spent all day at home, bored to death, so I created an opening to the urge, and a lot of thoughts started to flow, watch this, watch that, start by looking at this or that, I googled about something ""normal"", but my mind was building up to something, things escalated to a book about what seemed ""normal"" but there was one or two sexual lines, I closed the file after two pages, but I was already horny as hell, I didn't believe that one line in a book could make me like that, it was literally hell even an icy shower couldn't make much, these thoughts were dangerous:  -""The urge will keep coming back, the sooner you're done, the sooner you start over again""  -"" A month of nofap is already great, you can't afford more, you are single , God will understand, at least you're not fornicating like most people in your condition""  -"" You can't pass  more than a month of nofap, it's your maximum, just enjoy  you deserved that""... I can go on and on with these thoughts,   I was so angry I said to my d$k : ""Okey you Won! you son of a b$* "" I prepared everything to get started, but I couldn't start, inside I was still fighting"" If I lose now,  1)I will get depressed,  2)I carry myself after 3 weeks and 6-7 relapses to start for good  3) then after another month the same urges and thoughts will come back, 4) Probably relapse and start again the vicious cycle.  I have to break the cycle HERE and NOW, Then I rememered the nofap emergency button, after two quotes I came to a video on youtube, it inspired me and made my urge go away.  I learned one thing that no matter the strenght of the urge if you resist enough it would go away, you can choose to be stronger, you only relapse when you admit defeat, you never lose by KO but only by submission."

And what about sitting with the prophets and companions and listening or even living through the lives they had on eart.. With no time limit, they will literally have all the time sit and go through every detaiL. We can chill with our families with massive empires, build it the way we want and never have the fear of losing it and constantly enjoy every moment in the present. We will literally eat for nothing but pleasure. Everything is nothing but pleasure...on the other hand hell seems like a place of horrific proportions where even the thought of knowing that people i know are enjoying themselves in paradise (where i could have been) and that Allah is pleased with them (and displeased with me) is enough torture...but then thats really only the beginning, ill be fed thorns and blood n puss For a drink. I will constantly hear the screams of others suffering the torture. I will never feel any coolness.never feel a breeze. Never feel normal and be in constant regret.   May Allah save us all from the hell fire and throw us in to paradise free of charge. We are deeply in need of His mercy. Paradise is epic and i want to be there Asap."

He thought it wasn't a big deal. Although the chance to be able to see Allah in person is a big deal from him. He said he would spend years just staring at Allah. Was an out there Sufi order. Personally I would like to have a mansion, a buffet of different food everyday. A Low rider car with hydraulic suspension. I am a big old school Hip Hop head. So all the Hip Hop ever created would be in Jannah plus more. There would be heaps of rappers who made it to Jannah. I plan to spend a lot of days writing rhymes and recording Hip Hop tracks.

The only thing to do is to have suhur or good meal before you sleep. I know if you are not used to fasting the first day or couple of days will be difficult then it becomes super easy, trust me.   But I advise you to fast Mondays and Thursdays to get your body into easy mode. Then when Mondays and Thursdays become easy fast the 3 days (13, 14, 15) they are called the white days of every Hirjri Calendar.  Their reward is amazing:-  It was narrated from Jarir bin 'Abdullah that the Prophet said: ""Fasting three days of each month is fasting for a lifetime, and the shining days of Al-Bid, the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth.""  http://sunnah.com/nasai/22/331  Plus, it's a treatment as the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم:  It was narrated that 'Abdullah said: ""The Messenger of Allah said: 'Whoever among you can afford to get married, let him do so, and whoever cannot afford it should fast, for it will be a restraint (Wija) for him.""'  http://sunnah.com/nasai/22/152  May Allah help us all and make it easy for us :)"

Worship should be done only for the sake of Allah SWT, not for the praise and validation of others.

MuslimNoFap,2z3d1w,gentleservant9,2,Sun Mar 15 22:39:50 2015 UTC,In case you were referring to the sunnah its Mondays and Thursdays :).  Give it a try it really helps with reducing your desire since you have an empty stomach and fasting voluntarily really improves self-control.

MuslimNoFap,2z3fyk,Arviq,5,Sun Mar 15 07:22:15 2015 UTC,Sign me up please. How about switching the monthly challenge to Hijri calendar? I like watching the moon!
MuslimNoFap,2z3fyk,Arviq,3,Sun Mar 15 11:52:04 2015 UTC,"I love that idea! But the current challenge ends on 11 Jamaada Al-Akhir. That's going to make the transition tricky. A 19-day challenge, and then back to 30 days from Rajab onwards? Hmmm."
MuslimNoFap,2z3fyk,nofapic,3,Sun Mar 15 17:08:17 2015 UTC,How about overlaping them as transition. The March Challenge is continued till March 31 and The Jumadal Akhir Challange start at 21 March. So some people who fail in this month can join in the new Lunar format. Than we abandon the Sun format and continue with the Lunar.
MuslimNoFap,2z3fyk,mentaleur,3,Mon Mar 16 04:15:38 2015 UTC,I like this. Make a Jamaada al-akhir challenge thread on 1st of this moon.
MuslimNoFap,2z3fyk,gentleservant9,2,Tue Mar 17 08:10:38 2015 UTC,Good idea. The other challenge is determining the start and end date. It may be a day off for some people. I think setting a schedule in advance and sticking to that may help.

Therefore, In sha Allah once I get married and have children I will keep up-to-date with them.. guide them, have daily meetings with everyone and teach them about the prophet (peace be upon him), memorize Quran with them, and I will also give them comfort to approach me whenever they want whether it is a problem / addiction / consultancy...  Some tactics that I am thinking about is put rules:  1- I won't allow PC's in private rooms  2- I will limit the usage of technology so that they read more books about islam, and other things to learn.  3- I would like to convince them about Islamic things. For example, Prayers, Hijab, and following the example of prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) because I want them to be convinced and proud about it :)  4- Help them be organized and responsible.  Now, don't get me wrong I will definitely give them privacy, and I will let them build their character, but in Islamic way In Sha Allah.  This is what my family lack that I would like to do in the future in sha Allah!  I will even try to get them married as soon as possible and let them be responsible from an early age In Sha Allah.

MuslimNoFap,2ys0r3,HEARMMEROAR,2,Thu Mar 12 11:12:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you brother for your nice words. Everyone has the ability to do so. Your comment is a prove of that you have it inside of you as well. It is a nice example of that you are capable of performing introspection, which is one of greatest weapons a Muslim can possess. Mashallah brother.  Regarding your question about reading. To be honest, I do not read a lot (and I feel a bit embarrassed by it). During my reboot one of my goals is to increase my information gain. I chose the last three words of the previous sentence on purpose. Information is a great thing, knowledge is even better. But what we need to become is a wise person. A wise person knows how to make a story out of (limited) information. A wise person knows how to use knowledge in favor of Allah. That is my desire. Therefore I cut the amount of information gain up to a level at which I can efficiently make my story, and I just spend a long time thinking about one or two random Ayah's or Ahadeeth. I do not understand Arabic, but I know how to read Quran melodiously (if that is the right word?). I must be very careful by saying this, but with the right tuning of the heart narrating the Quran in Arabic cleans my soul.  We, Muslims, should train three aspects to gather wisdom. This is done via our heart, brain and soul. Or in other words, via our reason, feelings and spiritually. Remove one and you will become arrogant, radical or stupid.   Coming to your advice of making a diary. I tried to do it, but I am failing at it. I always slip off to write too much about my contact with other persons in my life and eventually it is too much focussed on validating myself because a girl checked me out or something. Therefore I have made up my mind to write something nice everyday on this forum (if people don't mind it).  And thank you for your encouraging words. It might sound all numb over the internet, but it really gave me a sparkling smile. May Allah be satisfied with you and relieve you from this problem."

MuslimNoFap,2ys0r3,Disprazione,1 point,Thu Mar 12 12:56:15 2015 UTC,"Hi there, I only listen maybe once or twice a year (and most of the time they are coincidentally). Most of the time the lectures that I get are just hutba's. I do not go to any other activities of Muslim communities due to my anxiety, unless I organize an activity which is mostly because of my inner pain."
MuslimNoFap,2ys0r3,Disprazione,2,Thu Mar 12 13:08:19 2015 UTC,"So then, where do you get your information/knowledge from if not from those two? I feel like I know what you're saying, but I get everything from lectures or books haha."
MuslimNoFap,2ys0r3,HEARMMEROAR,2,Thu Mar 12 13:21:15 2015 UTC,"I know it sounds a bit abstract, but I think I might have found the right word: purpose!  Whenever I get information (probably much less than you) I think about the purpose of retrieving this information. What will it make of me? What does it actually mean? Why did Allah made that information (in)consistent? Whenever I listen to a lecture I just focus too much on one thing only, purpose. Also for example at the railway station if someone passes by. I do not think of whether or not this man/woman is in a hurry or which train he/she wants to take or if she/he is handsome. The question to me is his purpose. What correlation is there with him passing by with the Great Plan of Allah? What can I learn from him just passing by? Why did I even focus on it? And even further, what kind of body language did he have and how would that correlate to his feelings? I can go on for ages like this.  It sounds bizarre, but the road of knowledge is questioning, not answering. By questioning something into great depts it is much easier to witness the Greatness of the Glory of our Creator. Furthermore, it does make a person feel submissive towards his Creator, because the person acknowledges his minuscule knowledge. By questioning myself I end up most of the time retrieving information from many channels of which I am not conscious about. Sometimes it is from books, movies, videogames, experiences of life and even fail compilation movies hahaha. Try questioning on a Jacky Chan movie and try to see the Glory :D"

Alhamdulillah i know what you mean, reciting with purpose and beautifying our recitation has a deep effect on us. We were told by the prophet pbuh to beautify our recitations but i struggle with it sometimes im like really good and sometimes i just feel nothing...i wish to inshallah get consistency in that.

MuslimNoFap,2ys0r3,nofapic,2,Fri Mar 13 13:40:28 2015 UTC,"I sometimes think marriage should be a long term solution to PMO. But I realize that wife is not like P. She wont be available all the time like P. One couldn't be able to approach wife every day. She may not be willing. She may be angry. She may have gone to her parents. Then she may be sick or tired. Then her beauty will also diminish over time (Or she may not be very beautiful at all). Pregnancy will slack out her body. She will become more busy e.g. with children. Moreover as that rat experiment shows one will also get bored of her. So this PMO danger will always be there.  This makes me believe with complete certainty that only really long term solution to this dangerous problem is complete rule of law of deen. This is for what prophet was sent so that he can make way of Allah prevalent over all the ways of life. No matter what problem I think of, the only working solution seems to be rule of deen. And as we all know what is the 'solution' of the people who perform, produce, distribute P. What these fasiq zaanis are doing is unbearable on the land of Lord. They are threatening humanity. So while fighting our nafs we have to at least keep the real solution in todo list and make serious efforts for that. That's our responsibility after no messenger has to come now. Rule of Lord has to prevail in easts and wests."

You have to stop binging if you relapse accidentally. Don't despair, you are actually better than most. Keep fighting your nafs.

MuslimNoFap,2yp8u9,nofapic,1 point,Wed Mar 11 20:19:12 2015 UTC,How do I stop the binging once I have relapsed?
MuslimNoFap,2yp8u9,nofapic,1 point,Wed Mar 11 20:52:02 2015 UTC,"I think main reason of relapse is build up of sexual tension. Once that is released one feels disgusting and he can't sin more even if he wants to. That's the time to stand up, take a gusl (bath), our body feels purified once that's done. Now one needs to take a gusl of his soul. For that we should pray two long raka'ats, make long sujood and repent from the sin. We whisper to the Lord and ask for forgiveness and steadfastness. That should lighten our soul. (Two raka'at after a sin is the advice of Prophet alaih i ssalam). We should also think about the loss of all gains of the streak when we binge that should also help muster up determination after a relapse.  After that few days are difficult because of memory of the orgasm. We can take the help of fasting to cope with that. For few days we have to be more strict. We can commit to ourselves that if we feel the urge we will make ablution and pray two raka'ats. Such actions can help us stay on the path. May Lord help us and no abstinence/steadfastness is possible without his help nor any forgiveness.   It's also advice of Prophet to marry early and if one sees a woman and feels the urge he should approach his wife. So if that's possible that's best and only long term solution. May Allah help me and my brothers practice what I have said above so that we can protect our chastity."

Was it image or video? What were your thoughts and feelings prior to watching explicit material/fapping? Were they boredom, grief due to past, or stress due to future? How can you PREVENT the same mistake happening again? Do you need help blocking images, websites, and even incognito mode? If so let me know. You can begin 1 day or you can begin from day 91, what matters is that tomorrow will be a really difficult day. Porn is a symptom of the conflict between your intellect and emotions. Overpower your emotions (whether that be grief or sadness or fear or boredom), and make today the win.   Let me know, and in this way, I can personalize the advice for you."

But I built myself up by watching a dating programme and then reading stupid articles on Daily Mail which were about celebrities dressing etc. 2) Boredom/after building up it felt normal to do it. Apologies for being blunt here, but one thing I have noticed is sometimes these feelings arise when you need to go to the toilet as in to either urinate or defecate. So sometimes I feel I need to go to the toilet, but I interpret these feelings wrong as that I need to relapse (If that makes sense). 3) By not rationalising watching anything even slightly that can be arousing, even though the dating programme was not really bad, it is what I used to build up in a sense to relapse. 4) I don't think I need help blocking websites or images, but I would love help to block incognito mode as I use this.  What I also struggle with is say I have relapsed, then I go into a binge and make it a lot worse. So I also need help with dealing with a relapse, trying to prevent it in the first place and then stopping binges if it does occur."

""Recite, [O Muhammad], what has been revealed to you of the Book and establish prayer. Indeed, prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing, and the remembrance of Allah is greater.

To block incognito mode, use this software. You need internet explorer to activate it since Chrome will consider this third party software as malicious and dismiss it. This was a great step forward for me. http://wmwood.net/apps/IncognitoGone/IncognitoGone.zip Wa la taqrabuz Zina. I was advised by Allah to not go near zina, that means each step that leads to it. For me, that means I’m not allowed to approach watching movies/shows that show intimacy, even though they are not the actual zina itself. So I put a barrier towards them by blocking them via K9. I have the same feelings. Sometimes, urination feels more pleasureable than ejaculation. I know : ( Use K9 to block specific video sites or specific urls which you often visit."

It is this little spark in our deeper consciousness to which we are truly submitted to that has lead us to be here. That is our faith, our inner core. PMO does not have the strength to pierce through this core and to mix it with our faith. But, pride and arrogance do have these powers. In order to buid a strong force against pride and arrogance (but also against PMO), we need to live an Islamic life. That life consists of both dunya and akhira knowledge. We need to train our bodies and our souls. As long as we have this struggle, I don't think we are committing shirk. And remember: We are not here, because we are free. We are here because we are not free. Our hearts are craving for freedom. To shine its burst of Noor to all of our body, our soul and all other people around us.

I did not have to compromise on Islam at all except for the part that there are no women and therefore dirty jokes are done really often. Otherwise, the thing that I really like is that quantum mechanics describes matter as a particle and a wave, which I love to see as human = body + soul.

MuslimNoFap,2ynzv1,LiveLikeTraveller,1 point,Wed Mar 11 15:17:24 2015 UTC,"Well, it is a populistic way to write, yet it is true. Any object (in the physical world) has a certain speed, but what is the speed actually? Now you may be sitting in your seat. Relatively to your seat you have zero motion. Relatively to a car passing by outside you have another relative velocity. And if you would observe it from the moon, you have yet another relative velocity. So, what is our true velocity? Which reference frame do we need to choose to determine our velocity? Einstein suggested that there is only one constant and well defined speed, that is the speed of light.  Imagine you and I are walking next to each other with 5 km/h. A person who is sitting on a bench sees us having a motion of 5 km/h. If I look at you, you only have relative speed to me of 0 km/h (because we go the same way with the same speed). Just imagine if you would be travelling next to light at the speed of light. Then you are basically freezing the 'image' right? The closer you get to the speed of light, the more you delay time.  What we try to do in our lab is to create a material with particles (electrons) inside that are moving at very high speeds (called relativistic velocities). Don't ask me what the application or whatever might be :D Fundamental research xD"

But as it was pointed out to me we need to resolve the addiction ourselves to the best of our ability before getting married.

May Allah SWT make it easy for us to stop this habit and have a healthy marriage.

MuslimNoFap,2yhiuz,gentleservant9,1 point,Tue Mar 10 13:31:43 2015 UTC,"Selam brother, nice list, however there are few notes:  2) At this point I find it advantageous to have the regular NoFap community where one is also learning about their sexual lifes. One thing seems to be certain. Fappers are not ready to marry. The moment we are close to reboot or we are already rebooted, then it would be a wise idea to fully concentrate for a wedding. Of course, this holds for unmarried fappers. If there are married fappers, just talk about it with your wife I guess.  4) Dopamine is a chemical that stimulates 'wanting', whereas opioids are there for 'liking'. Do we actually like pmo, or do we like seeking pmo? I guess it is the latter, because at the moment we have had our climax, we do not like what we have done. Therefore, with this brain chemistry information we understand how much background there is to what Allah s.w.t. us provided subhanallah.  12) These acts are all there to create a bonding with Allah. It is what we want and it is what we must want. However, probably like many of you, we are suffering from emotional attachments because of pmo. Therefore, let us not lose hope in Allah's forgiveness. Even though it might not come straight from our hearts, it will need practice."

MuslimNoFap,2yasdt,nofapic,2,Sun Mar 8 17:38:54 2015 UTC,"I often imagine the pressure when these verses were revealed. The state of prophet when no one was willing to believe him. He had only few companions bearing terrible tortures. His tribe had took a stand against him. He was being mocked in the streets of Makkah. He must have felt the huge responsibility put on him. He left home in the morning for the streets and roads alone, to call people to the deen of Allah. People who were busy in their daily routines most of them belying. Came back tired at the evening. Passed half of his night standing before God imploring for steadfastness. Stepping out again in the morning not for business but for a ""job"" without any pay. Imagine how much these verses would have consoled him. Your God has not left you. Then He really gave him a lot.   Now the time has returned. He is being belied and made fun of not in the streets of Makkah but in the streets of a global village. Chiefs meet to defend their false gods of freedom. Not the chiefs of tribes of Arab but of the tribes of a global village. His deen is not even implemented and defended by people who claim to follow him. His ummah is being cut and abused. Disbelief is prevailing lands, oceans and airs. But verses are declaring. God has not left you. History is being repeated."

I have no choice though these days theres no life without a degree :/  How enslaved we are. I feel lile im not going to be successful at anything. I have changed through five different courses and yeah looks unlikely ill fix that anytime soon. I have even gave thinking about marriage as im not even man enough to gind a way to earn a living. Please make dua for me too brother

MuslimNoFap,2yboqd,HEARMMEROAR,1 point,Mon Mar 9 06:09:41 2015 UTC,"Did graduation in engineering. But please don't think we are never going to be successful. My satisfaction is correlated to the state of my eman. If I feel guided I think I am successful. If I feel confused, that's the hardest time in my life. When I compare this life with akhirah, I have no worry left about it. Even if I have to beg my living in life, I am content with it, given my soul is satisfied with guidance. Please don't ever let yourselves believe in big salaries, high statuses, comfortable homes, shiny cars, tall buildings, beautiful lights, hotels, carpeted roads, corporate businesses, multinational companies. There is no comfort in there. They are the biggest worries. We need only as much halal respectful sustenance which is enough to live like a traveler, and that should be our target. Each evening is a success if we saved our asset of eman in this age of fitnah."
MuslimNoFap,2yboqd,nofapic,1 point,Mon Mar 9 07:09:58 2015 UTC,"Mashallah. Yes thankyou for being firm on that, losing hope is not an option. How can it be when the akhira is the ultimate success. Its funny how you mention that i was just reading a book about voluntary poverty called less is more, if you get time read it.   I know those things mean nothing but its the societal pressure and the family pressure thats tough. I just feel guilty as ive been trying to get through school but ive chnaged through like five courses and im making it extremely tough for my parents.   I feel the same way as you do when im confused i struggle but when i feel contentment its as if Allah is with me. Our eman is indeed the most important thing in this age of fitnah. Thankyou for those encouraging words borther, may Allah safeguard you and provide for you. Amin"
MuslimNoFap,2yboqd,HEARMMEROAR,1 point,Mon Mar 9 23:39:08 2015 UTC,"آمین اخی۔   Actually I was not talking exactly about voluntary poverty. I was talking about the state in which dunya is not your priority. Loss or lack of dunya doesn't cause you regret, An achievement in dunya doesn't make you proud nor you fear loss of it. You are content with whatever you have. You don't compare yourself to people whom Allah has bestowed more wealth. This state comes when one's soul is not largely invested in dunya. A wealthy man may well have this state. For example there was a Muslim man in the middle ages, who was told about his ship full of merchandise which had sank in the ocean, He responded Alhamdulillah. After some time he was told that news was wrong. He said Alhamdulillah.   This thinking is sometimes obligatory while practicing Islam. Often haram has more wealth than halal especially in these times where there is no land where deen of Allah is implemented by law. It's not allowed to accept haram. So it's extremely difficult to practice the deen while being a man of dunya.  Conclusion: Although many sahaba had adopted voluntary poverty based on their extreme taqwa and eman. But I am talking about not making social status of dunya a standard that it makes us depress or it makes us fear it's loss."

Inshallah i will do my best to live with this mindset, i think that's a beautiful mindset to live by.   Only Allah knows what's in our hearts because im sure majority of wealth in this world is a long shot away from halal. There's so much manipulation for wealth and some people are just hoarding wealth. We just have to do our best and im sure Allah will reward us."

MuslimNoFap,2yboqd,Drood007,1 point,Sun Mar 8 14:45:33 2015 UTC,"It's not necessary but good. Feeling shame and repentance is enough to be saved. From crying I remember an event. Once Allah sent some verses which rebuked Muslims for taking ransom from prisonors. Prophet and his companions were crying. Umar (RA) came and asked them, why is prophet crying? Please let me know that I should also cry with him or if I can't at least I will try to cry. So from here it can be learned that even if one does not cry, one should try to cry.

I am having a mixed feeling of hope (because I made a 48 day streak which is the longest one I had in maybe 2 years) and the other feeling is guilt for not staying strong.   but noway I am going to let myself depressed again because of this act, I made a mistake and I hope I will not make it again."

We have a choice for every single action. If we did not, then there would be no point in judgement day.

MuslimNoFap,2xukg3,mentaleur,2,Wed Mar 4 07:50:54 2015 UTC,"Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said: I live in the thought of My servant and I am with him as he remembers Me. (The Holy Prophet) further said: By Allah, Allah is more pleased wth the repentance of His servant than what one of you would do on finding the lost camel in the waterless desert. When he draws near Me by the span of his hand. I draw near him by the length of a cubit and when he draws near Me by the length of a cubit. I draw near him by the length of a fathom and when he draws near Me walking I draw close to him hurriedly."
MuslimNoFap,2xukg3,nofapic,2,Wed Mar 4 11:00:14 2015 UTC,"There is an verse in Holy Quran: ""Call on Him with fear and hope, for the Mercy of Allah is near to those do good"". [8:56] It means that one should have hope and fear at the same time while praying and repenting. If he has too much fear he will be disappointed from the Mercy of Allah and get misguided and If he has too much hope he will not repent (or not repent sincerely) and not do good deeds and he will too be misguided. The situation is like when we see lightening we have both fear of being hurt by the lightening and a hope of bestowed with fruitful rain.  Similarly I don't know the exact wording but there is a quote of Umar (R.A). He described his state of faith like: If it was declared on the day of judgment that everyone is going to paradise except one. I will hope if that's me. And if it was declared that everyone is going to hell except one. I will fear if that's not me. So it means that faith is between hope and fear."

Don't get lazy now! stay alerted and change your thoughts immediately! This lust is for few seconds that will give you happiness for seconds and a sorrow / regression  for days!  Be patient and I'll make Dua'a for you brother!   One thing that worked out for me is to do exactly as the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) said.. if you are about to do a sin or if you did it.. go immediately and pray two rakas for tawbah.. Pray them slowly and regret.. this will get you back in sha Allah!

I tell myself: Do not earn Allah swt displeasure by watching porn, while trying to earn Allah Allah's pleasure by studying for exam.   And its obvious, if Allah swt sees that I am struggling and do not give in, I would rather pass Allah swt's test and fail my teacher's exam, instead of failing Allah swt's test, and passing my teacher's exam.

There are many ways to cut it at many different levels: 1. Seek knowledge about hellfire punishments and rewards in paradise. (takes hours and is a continuous process)   Seek knowldge about harms of porn and masturbation (takes hours ) Block porn and ads (adblock, K9, Qustodio, OpenDNS - takes 4 minutes for each and its free!) If that doesn't work, and you still find access to porn, then block that access. (If you need help, message me privately - I""ll help you out. If you don't know where to start, tell  me, I'll help you) Sell your device if that's not enough. Get rid of your phone/laptop that helps you access by giving it to a friend to keep for you, for a few weeks or months. If a friend will not, then destroy it. If the sin is to great, you know that that device has become haram for you because it leads you to haram.

TV is not halal or haram per se, but if it is leading you to sin, then avoid it for the time being by unsubscribing to the service.  2) Are you protecting your garment from the thorns? - Taqwa is to pick up and prevent yourself from sin and thus save yourself from Allah's anger.   2b) What are you doing in terms of planning or prevention? - Have you put a K9 block on your computer? - Have you used adblock?  3) Have you planned for success AND failure? -   3b) It is already challenging to devise a plan on how to stop PMO... but have you planned for when you will fail? I.e.  do you know what to do next once you fail?  4) When you fail, what's your coping strategy?   4b) Is your strategy to repent, do good deeds, donate 5 dollars online or in person at a masjid or store it in a can and donate at jumuah oooorrrr do you resort back to more sin?  5) Have you found someone positive to talk to on your social media and offline... like a friend?  5a) There are muslim forums like ummah.com, muslim reddit forums like /r/MuslimNofap, or muslim facebook friends. Have you tried occupying time using those?  6) Stay away from zina, you are decreasing your life span, increasing your poverty in this life and you are earning Allah's anger. (Cite Dhahabi al-Kabair)  6b) Don't approach Zina, and there is a zina of the ears, eyes, hands, feet..."

The only way to break the pattern is to take out number 5, and go back to number 3 if you end up in number 4 again.  I have a similar pattern happen to me, and my longest streaks have all been because I focused on increasing my deen, memorizing Qur'an as well as reading the translation to get the message and listening to lectures on YouTube. I've found that my most recent relapses have occurred when I'm delaying salah. I'm working hard to be more timely in my salah and more focused during salah.

MuslimNoFap,2x8olt,Drood007,1 point,Thu Feb 26 22:33:33 2015 UTC,"Wa alaykum salaam bro  JazakAllah for the duas, May Allah Give us all strength to overcome our struggles.  Firstly bro shaytan never gets you to sin one time rather he gets you to take small baby steps and gradually progress until you fall into a big sin. The solution is you need to cut off the problem right from the beginning and prevent it from escalating.  Always remember that Shaytan beautifies sin & makes it look appealing but in reality all it is, is falsehood, sin and failure in this Dunya & Akhirah. Look how Shaytan convinces us to fap, we justify it based on the almost non-existent pleasure we get but afterwards where is shaytan to help us deal with the hangover?  It seems like you know where your problem lies akhee, but to help you along id like to suggest 2 things.  1) These dirty tv shows will not benefit you in any way. They make these obscene programs to corrupt people's hearts & minds, stir their lusts and passions and make them subservient to their whims & desires. We Muslims need to steer clear from such shows because they do not want good for us Muslims. They wanna distract us from worship and learning our deen so that we basically become pathetic, weak and incompetent in all aspects of life.   Stay away from these shows and don't put yourself in a position where you'd most likely start watching it. Tbh TV is haraam anyway and its evils are countless but if you're gonna watch it, don't be alone. Watch it when the family are around cos you most definitely won't be tempted to watch those shows in their presence. This applies to everything not just TV.   Also try to look at fapping for what it really is, you're not able to get married so when the urges get strong, instead of going to your wife, you basically use your hand and relieve yourself. Your hand is your wife. Quite pathetic really and disgusting. Having this kind of mentality, i find helps to stay away from it.   2) The 2nd problem can be simplified as lapses in Eemaan which then makes you lax in your prayers and then exposed and open to the wasaawis of shaytaan. My bro whether you're feeling it or not, you HAVE to pray. It's obligatory! Its what distinguishes us from non-muslims.   Salah is like a shield & protection from sins and fawaahish. If you leave yourself unprotected obviously you'll become an easy target. don't miss your salah and perform them with sincerity and concentration,  you'll find that you become filled with a sense of peace, tranquility, inner strength and your eemaan will increase. The non-Muslims do yoga to try and get these spiritual benefits, we have the best thing: praying to our Lord.  Finally try to increase in all aspects of worship not just salah. Increase in recitation of quran, fast regularly,  do dhikr, seek forgiveness, read books and listen to lectures  and also hang around with righteous company. Find some good, practicing brothers who seem more stronger than you spiritually and try to spend time with them. Their good habits could rub off on you and you will be inspired to try harder.   Fapping/Porn/Sex is one of the reasons why the Ummah is in it's current state, particularly among our brothers, i don't know to what extent the sisters are in it or are affected by it, but we need to start changing ourselves otherwise we will remain in this sorry state."
MuslimNoFap,2x8olt,Humeyun,1 point,Fri Feb 27 07:44:31 2015 UTC,"Wa Alykom el Salam Brothe.  Correct brother, that's how the shitan works he doesn't tell you to commit zina immediately, for example. But, he starts step by step. First, you start by thinking > he makes looking at naked girls a normal thing for you > you start doing the bad habit > later on you will say no I can't control it > after giving up you might at the end commit zina. May Allah help you to no reach to this point and all of us in sha Allah... so how can we solve this?!  Stop the first thing! Thinking or looking naked girls.  For example, I have a weird habit, and yes you will be surprised. I don't stare or look at women on streets at all. However, I used to watch these stuff!! so what is the deal here? The satan has made it normal for me to watch it on pc / mobile, but on streets it's not!  How to overcome this?   Well, I have mentioned in my post some ways to cut it down:  http://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimNoFap/comments/2wz0jn/how_i_fought_and_minimized_this_bad_habit/  Brother as a piece of advice, never ever leave prayers for such habit and don't be lazy. Set a rule for yourself that this habit will not make me leave prayers. Don't make the habit spoil your relationship with Allah even more!!!  Keep yourself busy busy busy! Do not use the pc / mobile if you don't have a purpose in mind.  Be active and do something in life! don't let this habit put you down and get lazy! Get involved with friends to do something for the community :) like this community :)  Don't become a slave for technologies, and I mean it! These days unfortunately, the time we spend on PCs / TVs / Smartphones is too much. Replace it with physical activities (gym, sports..etc)  Psychologically, If any person wants to leave a bad habit, the easiest way is to replace the bad habit with another one because you will have a lot of free time. So, fill that gap with another good habit.  keep saying Dua'a Dua'a Dua'a and Thiker  May Allah help you to overcome this and may Allah gather us all in paradise."

MuslimNoFap,2x0vti,Humeyun,3,Tue Feb 24 19:52:40 2015 UTC,"Assalaamualaikum,  Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts!  It's great that you differentiated between the perspective on non-muslim nofap and muslim nofap.  Like you said, there is a key difference in that non-muslims see better zina as a goal.  Can you please share what steps you took to keep such a streak and how you dealt with urges?"
MuslimNoFap,2x0vti,gentleservant9,2,Tue Feb 24 21:20:54 2015 UTC,"Wa alaykum salaam Tbh bro every one has their own way of doing this, there isn't really a set of rules and no 2 person's reboot experience is the same. But what i can do is give you some suggestions so if you feel they could be of use to you, feel free to take them on board.  1) Firstly we need to have the correct mindset throughout this process. We, as Muslims, aren't slaves to our desires, its not necessary to fap or anything on a regular basis in order to ""calm ourselves down"" and achieve release.   I've seen many non-muslims on the main nofap reddit and YBOP complain that they're dying from the need to release. This is absolutely pathetic, having desires and urges is normal and completely natural but we're not animals that we need to constantly relieve them.   Instead we should channel these urges into something productive and beneficial and divert it somewhere else. That's what normal people do. They have needs but they don't let it dominate their lives. It will only bother you if you let it. So try not to think too much of it, your gonads won't explode as a result of too much pressure, you don't get ""blue-balls"" cos of nofap and there is no need to O on a regular basis. These are just petty things people say which isn't even true.  2) If there were any rules there would be only 1, and that is absolutely NO ARTIFICIAL STIMULATION. That includes P, M, edging/fantasising, erotic literature, images etc. If its not the real thing DON'T DO IT.  Here I would add, as this is something I was guilty of, don't  even read any innocent, Islamic articles related to women, marriage, intimacy etc as it causes unnecessary disturbance to your peace, arouses passions/desires. You do not need to read about marriage, women or how to achieve intimacy with the spouse. Or at least not now. There is time and scope for that in the near future when you intend to get married as for now then its not something you necessarily need to know. So NO MARRIAGE ARTICLES, VIDEOS, NO PONDERING THE WONDERS OF WOMEN ETC. Leave all that for when you're intending to get married and when you're in a stronger position mentally, physically and spiritually.  3) Try not to sit around idly, always keep yourself busy and engaged in different activities e.g. reading, learning, praying, working out/exercise, socialising with friends & family, attend Islamic talks and events and just stay busy! The days will go flying by if you're preoccupied and before you know it you'll have made solid progress in your reboot.  4) NEVER, EVER BE TEMPTED TO ""TEST YOURSELF"". At times you might feel this whole thing is pointless and you're not getting anywhere. If your genitals seem lifeless and unresponsive, LEAVE THEM! Your just flat-lining and better days are just around the corner. Be patient. You can't expect years of fapping and the resulting harms to be cured in days or weeks. Stick to it and don't be tempted to check if it still works. It most probably does its just that its lying dormant.  Also i'd like to highlight the dangers of ""over-confidence"". There will be days when you're pleasantly surprised by your junk, don't get too cocky and think you're cured. You will easily lose yourself, PMO and completely ruin your entire reboot process. This is what I believe as I ruined a perfect 30 day streak prior to my current one due to this. so don't get over confident, you're not there yet and its a long process. Let your body & mind heal.  5) Sometimes you can pick-up a few golden pieces of advice from the non-muslim nofappers. One which particularly caught my attention and is working for me is; the only time you should ever touch your private parts is when you're cleaning yourself or in the shower. Other than that you don't need to touch it, cos its gross and kinda gay. Only losers self-pleasure themselves and it says a lot about you if you rely on your hand for satisfaction. Keep your hands to yourself and remember the Saying of Allah,   ""And those who guard their private parts except from their spouses and those whom their right hands possess"".  This verse is proof masturbation is haraam, your private parts aren't for you, it belongs to your future spouse to enjoy it however and whenever they please.  Not only does it make your spouse happy but it brings you satisfaction and contentment which fapping will never bring you. Fapping is cheap and a crap alternative,  its nothing like the real thing. Sex with the spouse is satisfying, bonding, fulfilling and healthy for mind and body, fapping on the other hand provides 2 seconds of numbed pleasure followed by overwhelming guilt, anxiety, weakness and loss of vital nutrients/minerals which your body could have used elsewhere. It is DETRIMENTAL to your mind & body.  6) Cold Showers. I recently introduced this into my regime and I can say it is absolutely amazing. Not only does it exhibit toughness and resilience but its such a manly thing to do, (much better than soaking in a hot tub, with a shower puff and swirling bath foam around).  The edge you get from a cold shower is phenomenal! Sure it sucks for like 5 seconds but afterwards its as if your body switches on its internal furnace and the immense energy and boost it gives makes your entire day awesome. I would deffo recommend cold showers, and even do istinja with cold water. It helps to douse the flames of desire.  7) Reduce your time online. Whether that's on your pc, tablet or phone. Think do I really need to go online? Can I do without going online just this once? Try to do something else. Go outside, work out, go talk to your parents/siblings, read books, go cook and eat something, learn new hobbies, do anything basically. The more you get in touch with real life, the faster you recover.  Also try to only use the net out of necessity and only when you really have to. Surfing is bad because Shaytan could easily lure you into his trap. You might be innocuously reading an article about marriage, then it escalates to intimacy, then the sexual relationship which escalates to something sexual involving images and eventually to full-blown porn and you relapse and guess what? You've just screwed up your reboot.   So don't surf the web without any purpose and only use it for necessity. It would be even better if you do it in the presence of others so you don't get tempted.   Also at night time keep your phone far away from you, turn the wifi off and perform wudhu, recite your adhkar and sleep on your right side. You can then sleep knowing you're in a pure, clean state and you won't get dirty thoughts or temptations. Imagine you might pass away in your sleep and not wake up.What have you put forward for your Lord? In what state will you meet him? Think about hell-fire and Paradise and think about the punishment of the grave. Seek forgiveness and do dhikr as you fall asleep.  8) Finally the words of our Prophet (Peace be Upon Him). Whatever he commanded us with will only benefit us and whatever he forbade us from its because its bad for us. His words are revelation and never spoke anything but the Truth. Obeying him will bring us happiness, success and joy in the Dunya & Akhirah. He said (Peace be upon Him):  ""O Youth, whoever is able to marry from you then let him do so, as that is better for lowering the gaze and better for protecting the private parts. And whoever is not able to then let him fast as it will act as a shield for him"".  These are the words of our Nabi, follow them and you will prosper. If you can't marry then FAST, FAST AND FAST. It will keep your desires in check and bring you reward. And increase in other acts of worship, pray, memorise Quran, give charity, remember Allah, seek knowledge. If you are in a good spiritual state, you will find it hard to stoop to a lowly level.   These are just some suggestions,  I hope they are of benefit and STAY STRONG.  May Allah Bless you."

However I just hope you are not thinking that life is always painful.  When we are grateful to Allah swt for everything we have and patient in hard times we can be content and live a pleasant life.  We cannot get rid of temptation but we can grow in our deen and attain the taqwa to make resisting easy.  I apologize if I misunderstood what you were saying."
MuslimNoFap,2x07fi,gentleservant9,1 point,Tue Feb 24 21:11:35 2015 UTC,"Walaikum Asalam, brother. I am not saying that life is all pain and temptation. I'm just saying that pain and temptation are inevitable and that they will come. But, even when they do come we must be ready to fight them, instead of running away. As you know the easiest way to temporarily get rid of the pain and temptation of an urge is to relapse but, we need to have the discipline to be able to stop running away and relapsing."

Yes its definitely not a good idea to get married for the sole purpose of stopping PMO.  There is so much more to marriage.  How can we tell when we are truly ready for marriage?  Is it totally unwise to want to marry as a protection from zina and to make it easy to lower our gaze? Thanks again!
MuslimNoFap,2wx3n0,stingyguji,1 point,Mon Feb 23 23:03:48 2015 UTC,"No one can ever be fully ready for marriage, as everyone has a different and unique marriage experience. I've found that the ability to be patient is a good attribute to have during marriage, because you will face many trials during the marriage itself, and if you're not a patient person things can get nasty really quickly.   I wouldn't say it's totally wrong, but don't let it be your main reason on getting married, you have to also look at other reasons too like completing half your deen, looking after a spouse, starting a family, moral support etc"

If you were to talk to your parents about this I believe it would be best if you spoke to your father alone as a male he would understand the urges you have.  It is upto you to either talk about the addiction or just say your ready to get married but are not finacially there yet I'm assuming your parents married young if they did bring it up and say how they had no money but still found a way to survive.  As other brothers have pointed out marriage is more than stopping your addiction it is another person in your life and you need to understand your wife's rights over you.  Hypothetically if you were to get married akhi but still continued this habit what would you do?   Asslaamalaykum"
MuslimNoFap,2wx3n0,WillOfFire2015,1 point,Tue Feb 24 07:17:43 2015 UTC,Appreciate all the advice!  Completing half my deen as well as the companionship and support of marriage are certainly reasons I would like to get married.  I understand that marrying just to avoid sin can surely create a lot of problems if you do not realize you are taking on so many responsibilitoes.  I probably won't share my habit with my parents since its a personal problem that I have to fix myself and like some have mentioned it may not go over well.  My family is from India and I was born in the US. My father married my mother at 28 but I just feel like there weren't so many temptations there at that time as there are here nowadays.  Jazakallah khair again for your responses and I pray that Allah swt makes it easy for me and anyone else struggling with their desires to abstain from sin and stay patient.

Move over this habit before marriage! if you can't stop it before marriage chances are that you will continue to do it. You should move over from the dopamine rush which needs to arouse you! And move closer to your creator! Allah has the best of plans! You will see how much your life quality will increase insha Allah when you move over this addiction! May Allah SWT bless you!
MuslimNoFap,2wo5f0,notoriouspotato,1 point,Sun Feb 22 04:08:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, Insha'Allah.  Shaytan makes the sins beautiful to sinners, whereas true believers have a strong distaste for sin.   I have been fighting this battle for a long time and I go through periods where I am fine and others where I'm completely entranced by this sin.  When I quit this sin for a while, it becomes disgusting to me and I can be aroused by the simplest things. It is in these moments that I truly feel the need to fast, like the hadith that tells young men to get married and if they cannot to fast, for fear of commiting Zina.  When I am deep into this sin, the material I Watch progressively degrades into more and more questionable stuff.  Insha'Allah, you will get over this and your heart will heal."

I got away from this habit for a really long period once, but the mistake I did, was to see if I still find these stuff normal... to be honest when I tried to do it again I was really really scared and my body started to tremble as if it's a new sin that I have not done before .. So, my advise is to keep away from it, and everything will get back to normal.. fight fight fight :)   I exactly feel like you bro, so let's fight together and leave it together..   Hint: The first month is the most difficult month, but once you exceed that you will have better control; however, I advise you to always be cautious, and don't leave your guard down :)  You can do it with real intention, and be strict to yourself  and keep asking Allah for help to change this habit to a better habit that will benefit you for the hereafter :)  may Allah help you brother :)  Jazaka Allah Khairan"

MuslimNoFap,2wn5h9,Drood007,3,Sat Feb 21 11:09:44 2015 UTC,"I also feel that we just need to try our best. When at a mall, reciting dhikr while shopping instills Taqwa, which helps me to avoid lustful gazes and keep my concentration on my tasks.    Whoever enters a market and says: “Laa ilaaha illAllah waHdahu laa shareeka lah, lahul mulku wa lahul Hamdu yuHyi wa yumeetu wa huwa Hayyun laa yamoot, bi yadihil khayr, wahuwa `alaa kulli shay’in Qadeer” – ‘There is nothing worthy of worship but Allah, He is alone without partner, to Him belongs dominion and praise, he causes life and death and He is the Living and does not die. In His Hand is all the good, and He is over all things competent’; Allah will write for him a million good deeds, erase a million of his bad deeds and raise him a million levels and build for him a house in Paradise. [Tirmidhi]   So that's the dhikr I try and do while shopping.  I definitely have more trouble at work. Business is politics, and so to climb the ladder, one needs to be sociable with everyone and not just good at the job alone. In fact, lack of sociability may put my job at risk. I can't avoid dealing with women professionally and socially. The best I can do is avoid handshakes and keep interactions platonic without any sort of flirting. So I keep to topics such as, ""How are your kids?""  I'd also like to know if others have a better way of dealing with this."

MuslimNoFap,2wn5h9,HEARMMEROAR,1 point,Sat Feb 21 12:44:17 2015 UTC,The way our vision works we can see without focusing what is in front of us. What I tend to do is scan my environment and I can see woman approaching I try making sure I don't look at their features and as I already know through scanning where the people are I can walk on the streets without issues. Obviously in university and work this is harder but if you try to lower gaze even when you have to talk to a woman say work-related and in many cultures this is even a sign of respect. Of course doing it is harder than talking about it so what I sometimes do is say a word DISINTEGRATE whenever a woman is around to remind me that the women of this world will perish but the women of Jannah who are much superior will last forever and Allah will give me if I keep hold of a lower gaze
MuslimNoFap,2wn5h9,Vicegripper1,1 point,Sat Feb 21 12:47:59 2015 UTC,"Here is my take on this that I've been following my entire life. If I make a mistake or am wrong I hope Allah swt can forgive me, as well as yourselves:  It is not always plausible for us to literally lower our gaze. However, this is not something that I believe you should take completely literally. When talking to another person, be it male or female, do not look anywhere below their chin. It might sound silly and counter productive since we're taught to lower or divert the gaze to somewhere else, but the real aim of this is to PROTECT not only our mind from evil, but ALSO protect the other person's dignity. Even if that person lacks self respect themselves and present themselves in a perverse fashion in order to attract attention, it is not an excuse for us to check out their body. Therefore even in that situation it is STILL our responsibility to protect that person's dignity in our eyes as they are a creation of Allah swt and not look at their body. If confronted in such a situation where you cannot look away, then limit yourself to just the face, and with Allah swt in your mind and heart, do not look past below the chin.   This is something I've done my entire life, and I have found that this is the best way to give a person the respect and dignity that they deserve from such a simple interaction and solution. In the cases of people who dress a certain way to attract attention to themselves, this is the best way to give them the respect and dignity that they are missing out on without making them feel lowly and cheap. And if inshAllah YOUR intentions are pure, then just this simple act is enough to make them change their habits. As silly as it sounds, I have seen many people change certain bad habits just from the amount of respect they've felt with this method.     Edit: Of course this entire thing excludes the words I've said and how I've said them, as this is the other really big part of the interaction. But my intention is always to make the person feel respected and not cheap, even if we touch on the topic of how the outfit is too revealing. And Alhumdulillah even if the person does not change their ways, around you they will give you the same respect you gave them, and cover themselves up on their own. And this right here is step one to them changing their lives by themselves instead of us trying to anger them and force them to change."

This just led me to doing worse and worse until I became desensitized to what I was doing which is a bad sign.As you feel terrible and guilty, this is a good sign as you regret what you have done(thus you have fulfilled one of the conditions of repenting properly). Just remember Allah's mercy is greater than his wrath and if you turn to Him repentant he will turn to you with forgiveness and mercy, so never despair of his mercy.Do not think that this sin is too much for you to handle as ""Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity. It will have [the consequence of] what [good] it has gained, and it will bear [the consequence of] what [evil] it has earned""  “Allaah holds out His Hand during the night to receive the repentance of the one who has committed wrong during the day and holds outs His Hand during the day to receive the repentance of the one who has committed wrong during the night.” (Muslim)  Allah the Almighty has said: “O son of Adam, so long as you call upon Me and ask of Me, I shall forgive you for what you have done, and I shall not mind. O son of Adam, were your sins to reach the clouds of the sky and were you then to ask forgiveness of Me, I would forgive you. O son of Adam, were you to come to Me with sins nearly as great as the earth and were you then to face Me, ascribing no partner to Me, I would bring you forgiveness nearly as great as its.”"

Also know that it is really hard to quit an addiction in one time . Failures and relapses are part of success . They allow you to learn from your mistakes. Plus, there is nothing to be mad at. Just get on another streak as soon a you relapse and don't make a lot of scenes about it. Also, please don't do any duas that Allah punishes you , its just not gonna bring you any benefits.

If you say things like that then well what is Allah supposed to do? We all feel down and especially when we go through this recovery there will be ups and downs which we will notice even more because we don't have anything to cover the pain anymore and thats the point we have to learn to deal with our problems and issues.  This is part of recovery and if you give up when the going gets tough the same will seap into your life and in school and family relationships you will do the same. You won't ever truly become a man and as muslims Allah has honored us as the best of men. If Allah azzawajall has honored us to that level then why despair?   Just pray and pray all your prayers. Think about why would Allah ask you to pray if he wasn't going to answer your prayers..that fact that we are told to pray is eveidence itself that our prayers are being heard! Inshallah brother keep your head up and push forward a day at a time no more than that ONE DAY AT A TIME INSHALLAH and see the success he azzawajall will grant you :)  May Allah make easy your struggles :) Amin

Forget marriage. It isn't a solution. The urge to PMO is something which you can't heal with just marrieng. You are addicted. It's like telling a cocain addict : Hey drink some Energy Drink it is an alternative.  You can ask all the brothers here who are married. Check out the fortify program on the sidebar. I think that will help you inshaallah."

I need to get out of this cycle. I've been stuck for 3 months. Every time I relapse, I say ""This time it'll be different, this time is the last.""   But the problem is I don't change my habits, I don't do things to increase my Iman, I keep skipping sunnat prayers, I put of reading Quran. And then I'm surprised when I relapse in two days.

I still have some social anxiety at times but it doesnt completely debilitate me like it did b4. Alhamdulillah over the last few days He has made Islam easy for me. Whereas when I was watching porn I didnt pray or go to the masjid now I look forward to praying and I go to the masjid when I have time. Your determination is inspiring bro! Dont forget me your dua and I will keep you in mine! Astaghfirullah
MuslimNoFap,2vv350,w33dwick,1 point,Sat Feb 14 12:44:26 2015 UTC,"Brother when i was deep in this addiction, you have no idea how bad my social anxiety was. I had to be put on medication and while that helped for a bit it only got worse after time and even was considering that i may be Bipolar...astagfirullah, naouzubillah. Alhamdulillah once i came across NOPMO and trying to quit things drastically changed, but they don't overnight. Change happens in a miraculous way a miracle that we actually don't seem to even realize. Sins are such that if you see them as a small sin which is the like of a stick in an open field and there are many sticks(many sins) once you have realized how many sticks or sins you have piled together you know it is well capable of making a blazing fire. We shouldn't view sins as small because they will only create an uncontrollable fire.   Change is similar however we are collecting good deeds and building good habits while at the same time replacing our bad deeds and habits. Overtime Allah blesses you with more than you could have ever imagined. We fall short and fail when we expect things to happen almost immediately, we lack patience and hence we undermine our own efforts and Allah's blessings.   Brother work hard and write down your feelings from time to time and keep improving your prayer and zikr and inshallah we may just find ourselves in paradise one day(in the hereafter that is). May Allah grant us perseverance and look after our well being. May Allah assist us in worshipping him and remembering him because only through him lies our freedom and liberation. Allah is truly majestic and the owner of the day of judgement. He is supreme and all praise is due to him and him alone and Muhammad sallalahu alaihi wasallam is his messenger."

I always tracked my relapses, but now I decided to start tracking when I get the thoughts/urges. So I have a counter for each day that I just increment whenever I get a urge in my head, which allows me to see how often I get the urge. But more importantly, it breaks the automatic response to go look at porn since I go to increase my counter instead. It seems to work for me and it might work for others as well"

So rather than taking a quick peak, say NO from there. Look at random success/fail stories on reddit and other websites as motivation. And replace the time you fap with something more productive.   Goodluck!"
MuslimNoFap,2vi7nc,fapdestroyer1,1 point,Wed Feb 11 05:36:39 2015 UTC,"Will I ever just get over it for good? Like, just completely forget about it. I have issues with that. I start to think of this filth, and that leads to relapse. I even thought about it during salaat, and that scares me. I wish it would just disappear from my mind."
MuslimNoFap,2vi7nc,austex_mike,3,Wed Feb 11 05:50:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when I was on my 25 day streak around day 15-20 I completely forgot about it all. Then I had a wet dream and I for some reason thought of that as relapse and got all depressed and began doing it again. It won't ever disappear from your mind, but the way you perceive it will. It will feel more immoral and disgusting as time goes on.   And yeah I been there before in the middle of salaat, having a quick flash of filth appear in my mind. We're only human and it does happen. So don't let it make you feel possessed or anything lol.   Western society has fooled mankind into believing that fapping is normal and even have the nerve to call it ""healthy"" because it decreases the chance of a person getting prostate cancer. The funny thing is during their research they didn't bother to test the multiple harmful effects that fapping causes. Porn companies are ran by some of the most evil people on this earth who prey on innocent young kids so they can get them hooked at a young age. After all, we live in a consumer based society.   Think positive, and retrain your brain into thinking of the act as immoral. Like if your parents found out you did it, the way they would think of you. Use that as your motivation."
MuslimNoFap,2vi7nc,Borscho,2,Wed Feb 11 06:43:30 2015 UTC,"Did you ever learn how to ride a bike? Did you instantly get on it and ride perfectly the first time you tried? Probably not. You probably fell off, and you kept having to put your foot down and catching yourself over and over.   Deciding to take control of your most basic animal desires and instincts is very similar. We live in a world that bombards us with sex and sexual images. We train our brains to respond to these images. Deciding that you no longer want to be slave to this is only the first step, next comes the long journey of conquering yourself.   First, stop measuring your success by your ability to go cold turkey and stop all together. That would be like only considering yourself successful in riding a bike if you managed to ride 20 miles your first time. Take it slowly, one day at a time. Try to go 6 hours, then 7 hours then 8. Work your way up to a day, a week, etc.  Also, don't lose sight of the big picture. Maybe you manage to slow down, that is more than most people ever manage or even try. Suppose in a week you read passages fapped five times and read the Quran three times. Then the next week you fapped three times and read the Quran five times. That would be significant progress.   You aren't worthless, you are human. What you are doing is a journey and not an easy one. You will fail, and that is OK. It is far better to fail when trying to improve yourself than to not try at all."

The guilt was eating away inside me so much that there was a lowest point I felt so upset that such a life is not worth living. But in the darkness Allah gives hope. I was on my laptop before watching porn and I felt so guilty that I slammed shut the laptop and my insides screamed to Allah for help. For whatever reason without even me realising I opened the TV and miraculously there was a program addressing porn. Ofcourse I always knew only Allah can help me out of this but that day it him very hard that it is just me trying but asking Allah very sincerely   So it became that in nearly every Salah I asked Allah to attain purity for this mess. It is not just Him doing His part, I too have to help myself with the Quran, with books, reddit, videos, lowering my gaze, pictures , working on my Salah and so on. Everyday is not the same at some days are harder than others.

In 45 days you must be feeling awesome....I dont know how long have you been trying nofap but I am trying for past two years and I still havnt made it to 30 days yet not even once...but I know the one day I will. Instead of feeling disgust you should se that you abstained for 45 days!!!! I cant imagine the amount of self disciple which is required for that kind of streak. Allah has its own way of getting a believer out of this mess.If you are defeated then figure out why were you defeated.?.What made you loose.?What were you  doing different in past 45 days..that you didnt relapse? We are human..We make mistakes ..We       learn from it. Thats how a believer should act..Learning frok his or her mistakes. There will come a time when you ,me and everyone on this sun would have defeated this Demonic addiction....and then we will look back and say ""Ya Allah ....That was one hell of a journey""  You will be much stronger than the people who never even knew what addiction means and feel like...But You will know it and will be so proud of yourself that you overcame this......"

However I do still get urges, but I've learned to navigate those emotions by again and again being aware of why I'm doing this, and it's a combination of things: so that in the future inshaAllah, it's a pleasure I can share with a significant other. Also to live a healthy, productive, meaningful life for me and for a SO. Lastly to have a close relationship with Allah swt. Fapping made my life miserable and now life is so much better. When you get a sample of how life without fapping is you won't want to go back. I'm rambling but another thing that has helped me tremendously is to be busy. To me that is to study, study and some social life with friends and family. You could work as well. Be so busy so that by the end of the day you'll just crash and won't have the energy to do disgusting things. I pray He guides us to the straight path, and grants us the strength to stay away from shamelessness."

MuslimNoFap,2va37y,HEARMMEROAR,3,Mon Feb 9 07:31:55 2015 UTC,"Some tips to give you a boost: -First educate yourself about this addiction as much as you can and make sure its thorough information.  -Don't lock your door at home and stay around family when you are bored. -Take it one day at a time (use HabitBull). -Write down your feelings as often as you can (once a week.month etc.) -Never eat to fill your stomach and cut down on meats for a while and stick with fruits and veggies. -Don't eat late at night(last meal before bed should be 4 hours earlier and a snack an hour before you go to sleep) -Focus on your education by that i don't mean school i mean find things you enjoy and develop a habit for reading (School=/= Education) -Learn to enjoy solitude and always be mindful of Allah subhanawataala.  Bro we can do this, afterall Allah azzawajall is with us! All these suggestions won't happen overnight but what you should do is integrate them slowly into your life and if you fail don't just go into despair(even though that's very easy to do). Failure is actually saying that you were doing something wrong, your motives and goals were not aligned. You were lacking purpose. Failure should be seen as a time for assessing the self and pondering over ones existence, it in essence is a perfect chance for getting to know thyself and getting closer to Allah azzawajall. What I've come to realize is that we don't trust Allah enough we supplicate and promise that we won't go back to the habit and actually we wouldn't had we only remembered that we made a deal with Allah and we shouldn't have fallen into despair. This showed Allah subhanawataala that we didn't quiet have faith in him and so failure was inevitable.   The ultimate thing to do is follow the sunnah of our prophet/s(may Allah's peace and blessings be upon them) in overcoming calamities. One of the most profound stories for me personally in regards to this is when Musa a.s was being chased by Firaun:  And when the two hosts came into sight of one another Musa's companions said, ""We will surely be overtaken!"" He said, ""Never! My Lord is with me and He will guide me."" (Qur'an, 26:61-62)  When they came to the seas almost everyone though well we are doomed and me and you would have done the same, but not Musa a.s (pbuh). He simply trusted in what Allah azza wajall had revealed to him and they were safe. Just for a moment ponder over that, how beautiful is the relationship!!! What a firm conviction in his lord Musa a.s had and how sufficient is our lord for us.  http://www.miraclesofthequran.com/historical_02.html  Subhanallah :) May Allah azza wajall grant you, me, us and those who are fighting success , Aamin."

Get really familiar with the addiction and know it for what it is. Once you acquire knowledge take action according to the knowledge you have gained. Remember you will fail but when you do make sure you assess why you failed? What led you to it? Understand yourself, work out your tactics and then pray to Allah subhana wata aala.

Edit : An excellent trick to battle laziness is.. Remember that dreadful feeling when you know you should really do something but lazy/careless to do it? Yes? Just stop thinking and get up and do it! It will feel wierd at first like your dragging your own body but believe me you will feel so satisfied afterwards."

Indeed, prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing, and the remembrance of Allah is greater. And Allah knows that which you do."" Spend time protecting and perfecting your prayer. DONT LET SHAYTAAN GET CONTROL OVER YOU remember he has no control all he can do is whisper. he will lead you to thoughts you never had and make you believe their yours. Don't let yourself have any free time give your self too much to do if you need to talk to some one message me. Sell your high quality phone or multimedia device for one that doesn't have good resolution or very small screen. Maybe get a pet that you can put in your room to watch you and shame you even distract you when you feel the urge. what ever you do don't fall in to shaytans trap he will try to bury you in hopelessness Allah is the one that can forgive you and lead you to light..."

Focus on a day at a time. its like deceiving the brain till the tomorrow which in shaa Allah would never come. 3. I remember all the misfortunes that have met me because of the evil. The numbness and dwindled emotions and alot I can't mention. And a kind of vexation is built up to fight it out. 4. Never miss the Mondays and Thursdays fast. look forward to d next fasting days with eagerness. I call them shock absorbers. how? 7week days. fast on Monday. nofap complete Ctrl over urge... Tuesday, urge to fap but with muslimNofap n d little zeal from Monday n u pull through Tuesday.

The fact that your addiction started when you were young means that this is a test from Allah. Allah wants you to get control over your mind and nafs that is why he gave you this addiction so that you can learn from it. It could have been worse.

Basically your character is similar to your friends, theres only two things that can happen when you hangout either you rub off on them OR they rub off on you. You should avoid the latter and hangout with better people because if anything that will only Improve YOUR character, but I know its hard especially with close friends.

MuslimNoFap,2u39gy,komodo009,4,Thu Jan 29 15:57:27 2015 UTC,"If you commit a sin over and over again, you start to get used to it and don't consider it as ""so bad"". But the fact that you are concerned about it is a good sign. Keep repenting to Allah every time you fall into this sin. Allah will forgive as long as you ask for forgiveness. Don't let the Shaitan delude you, he tries to get us away from repenting"
MuslimNoFap,2u39gy,Borscho,3,Thu Jan 29 17:32:22 2015 UTC,"Salam I faced the same situation last year and it greatly disturbed me and afterwards during Ramadan I came across the fact how important it is to cleanse our heart. The more we are exposed to sin, filth and useless things the rustier and darker it becomes  Purification of the heart is something I still struggle with but it is meant to be an ongoing process. Heart can be purified in some ways that I found below:   Carry on repenting even if you do not get the same feelings as before as Allah loves those who repent  Remind yourself about the Akhira, Jannah, Jahannam, Grave various punishments and rewards in Quran as a heart that is rusty becomes heart and such reminder will increase our fear of Allah and soften the heart 3 Work on Salah as the result of a good Salah is preventing shameful conduct and evil as mentioned in the Quran. Try to attend Masjid as much as possible, don't miss any of the 5 prayers improving the quality of each as much as you can 4 Read books to improve your spirituality. I recently bought one on the grave and more knowledge on these topics will benefit you more. As Rasul S said Aksiru Zikra Hazimil Lazzat Frequently remember death the destroyer of pleasure and it inshAllah the reminders will destroy the pleasure of watching porn 5 Don't despair. Never lose hope in the Mercy of Allah who is Oft Forgiving and the Most Merciful. We should fear His punishment that should stop us from evil but never give up hope on His Mercy that exceeds His anger"

But as years went by, and I continued to do the sin, I would just brush off the sin as no big deal. But it used to bother me that I didn't care any more (at least I had some decency left to acknowledge that there was something wrong)  This is because my heart hardened.  But recently alhumdulillah, I've been changing, and man, I care a lot more now, and it causes me grief, I do cry. When I heard the word being recited ""ITaqillah"" i.e. have taqwa of Allah swt, I got teary and felt remosrseful of my sin.  Just remember, that you will get back to that state and can even go stronger and more closer. But its a process.  Make sure that you never give up and always plan ahead to protect yourself and give up leasure/youtube/facebook/pornsites if you have to, to get rid of the access to sin."
MuslimNoFap,2tyi04,Vicegripper1,3,Wed Jan 28 12:55:28 2015 UTC,"Pornography is at the utmost misogynistic, inhumane, unnatural and disgusting. Who in their right mind would like to watch two people doing an intimate act. Not even animals do that.  I do not know how people can even masturbate to something like that. I do not even want to talk about the effects of watching porn. I feel sorry for all the actors who participate in those filthy films.  I pray to Allah that one day the pornography industry gets abolished!"
MuslimNoFap,2tyi04,uchicha15,2,Wed Jan 28 21:45:12 2015 UTC,We need many more people to speak out like this and strong action needs to be taken. Pornography enslaves and corrupts and is like a cancer in our society.
MuslimNoFap,2tyi04,redditFTW1,1 point,Wed Jan 28 13:11:47 2015 UTC,I agree with you fervently and I wholehearted hope the entire porn industry is eradicated and we did not live in a society that increasingly treats women as sexual objects to be dangled in front of men for selling things and as entertainment. A hyper-sexualises society that creates addicts and in worst case scenarios criminals who do unspeakable things to satisfy their lusts  Imagine a healthy Islamic society where there was no free-mixing and women were honoured and respected like the queenly status Islam gave them rather than kind of treatment they get today like a piece of meat  ( BBC revealed a third of women in Europe were sexually abused in some way)  The above is just a sample of the vision I see of the future when Islam is implemented in its true complete form and not in bits and bob. For now we need to do as you did exposing this filthy evil act as it is our duty to forbid munkar.  Only one point that should be clarified that I am sure all those who are in this group have a hatred towards porn. However the nature of porn should be analysed as it is a highly addictive habit and those with the utmost hatred may indulge in it ( google your brain on porn) although including myself we are trying to fight it remove it completely from our system and our lives.

MuslimNoFap,2tm3hf,Drood007,5,Sun Jan 25 14:03:00 2015 UTC,Waleykum salam brother! For me i started this journey in the month of Ramadhan! so it was bit easier for me to move over those initial strong urges. After good one and two months it was bit easier to resist urges. I changed my self a lot where i grew spiritually and also improved my concentration. Alhamdulillah i did well in exams this time because Allah was with me in this semester. My sexuality the way i look at women changed so much where that intense craving for certain body parts faded away. I also found a wife Alhamdulillah in this journey! we are still apart because i am still studying! Insha allah everything falls well quickly! After good 30-60 days i understood that root cause to these problem is something to do with our gaze. I slowly stopped checking them out! i feared Allah and also i didn't want to feel super guilty! this didn't happen suddenly but eventually i trained my self to lower my gaze Alhamdulillah! and i still find that's our root cause to the problem! yes it something simple to say but hard to do! but Allah swt is so precise. If we don't follow his orders yes! we are in spot of bother! May Allah SWT bless us all!

Maybe He have you this time to finally overcome this addiction, to focus all your energy into it. I remember Norman Ali Khan telling a story of his hindu friend whose whole goal in life was to become a Doctor, he had good grades everything but he didn't get in he was crushed. Long story short he decided to go back to school to study computer science, where he met muslims and Alhamudlla'Allah became muslim. He looks back on it and says how not getting into medical school was the best thing that ever happened in his life because it lead him to Islam. Sometimes things that look the worst are in reality the best for us. Allah knows things we don't, He helps us in ways we can't imagine. I pray Allah helps you and me and grants us all His forgivness..."

Not a tool but tools. marriage is a great tool but with it alone you are not going to get anywhere.  Also you are asking if you get rid of this problem...how will you know you have succeeded? 100 days? 200 days? I can tell you im almost at 300 days and i know i still have problems.  Anyway I am married, i can tell you for sure I am not 'cured'. And I never will be because the temptation is always there. You can only learn how to deal with your desires when they get strong.  You should get married but do not expect it to solve your problem.  Hope that helps.  Wasalam"
MuslimNoFap,2thrhh,nofapnofap123,1 point,Sat Jan 24 11:59:44 2015 UTC,Word ! Mashaallah. A lot of people are married and also addicted. There are two kind of urges : The natural sexual urge and the unnatural ill urge    for porn. It is not the same. Marriage will help you with the first natural desire (if it is not killed by porn). But it won't give you the unnatural porn-dopaminkick.
MuslimNoFap,2thrhh,Ddjoker,1 point,Sat Jan 24 12:46:25 2015 UTC,"Brother, I am aware of that. What I'm trying to verify is that since I am not addicted to porn itself, is it still an addiction or not? I mentioned above that if I go a while without looking at any images, etc, I desire contact with a real woman. And I dont desire anything other than real intercourse. No twisted fantasies, etc (alhamdulillah)  I really appreciate your response :)"

I just tend to look at something that satisfies my desire. It could be a scene from a movie, a picture, anything. When I go many days withouot it, I tend to desire real contact with a woman, I dont desire porn. Do you get what I'm saying? I wanted to know if that's the same way other porn addicts feel or not. As I mentioned earlier, alhamdulillah I am not into porn, the idea of watching people have intercourse disgusts me."
MuslimNoFap,2thrhh,Muneeb2Allah,1 point,Sat Jan 24 13:25:34 2015 UTC,"In that case marriage will definitely help you. If you are not hardcore porn addict you will do fine. But my advice is, don't look at any harm stuff at least for 30-40 days then get married. May ALLAH bless you."

MuslimNoFap,2thrhh,Borscho,1 point,Sun Jan 25 07:30:25 2015 UTC,I have no idea how old you are but I am guessing you are no older than 21? Anyway look it always starts of with soft stuff like pictures. I can promise you when I first started I was only looking at things like pictures of models in catalogues. And of course I was disgusted with idea of porn. I assure you most of us started off like that.  And most of us also crave the touch of a woman...but when we cant get that then we got the internet in front of us right? Its an escape mechanism and whether its dirty pictures or full scale hard core porn the underlying mechanism is the same. And this mechanism dictates for things to get progressively worse. Control your desire not to look at even soft pictures and you will be saved from much worse insha Allah.  And def get married!haha
MuslimNoFap,2thrhh,Borscho,2,Sun Jan 25 14:30:33 2015 UTC,"I had this thing in my mind that I shouldn't get married until I stop looking at this stuff. I guess I was wrong. And yes, I am 21 :)  In sha Allah bro, always make dua for me and all of us. And thanks a lot, this is exactly what I was looking for :)"
MuslimNoFap,2thrhh,philasify,2,Sun Jan 25 16:05:03 2015 UTC,"Dear brother,   I think I an relate to you.   Yes, some people will say that I am addicted. May be I am. May be I am not.   Although I keep falling for porn after 9-10 days, I still sincerely believe that I am not addicted.   The reason why I fall for porn is simple: I truly need a companion and human touch. And when your need is too strong, it is justifiable need and this is not something you cannot ignore, no matter how hard you try.   I have crossed 27. By the grace of Allah, I have always been a top student. I never had any relationship with girls, although both my high school and university was co-ed. However, I am pure because Allah has kept me pure, and had He tested me, may be I would have failed. So, true credit goes to Him.   Now, as a shy boy growing up, I always waited for that moment when I would get married. I graduated, Allah blessed me with a job. Being from a desi family, that is not enough. You have work a few years first. I did not mind. I worked four years. I spent 55% of my four years of earning for my family. Also, whatever I had earned when I was an undergraduate student, I spent 100% for my family. For the last two and half years, aside from working, I have completed my masters degree, and by the grace of Allah, I have graduated.   I have reached a point in life, where if you ask me, I would say that it is difficult for me pass even one more second without a wife. Whenever I see children outside and a couple, you know the feeling I get.   In last 15 years, I did not touch or kissed a fellow human being. This is desi culture where no one hugs or kisses. Plus I did not have a any younger siblings.   My need for human touch and human companionship has become overwhelming. I try to busy myself with religious activities but I can only do so much.   Eventually I fall for porn. I delude myself thinking that porn will fill my void but the fact is, porn is poison and it can never fill the need for a true human companionship. And porn follows days of depression and bad mood.   The situation has become complicated because there was a proposal recently and I wanted to go ahead with it. I felt attraction towards the sister and felt that we would be compatible. However, my mother objected and threatened to disown me for life.   I turned down the proposal.   After this turning down, things got hard for me. My world crumbled. My faith is being tested now. I suffer from depression. I resent my mom. I got anger feelings. I know I am supposed to love my mom but after she rejected this poposal, although I do not show any disrespected outwardly, I feel so angry that sometimes I feel I will complain to Allah on the Day of Judgement about her rejection of this proposal, which only made my struggles harder.   May Allah make it easy for me."
MuslimNoFap,2thrhh,janser66,5,Sat Jan 24 20:01:23 2015 UTC,"Salam bro.  Bro my situation is not nearly as grievous as yours! May Allah reward you for your sabr! I will seriously pray for you my dear brother in Islam and desiness. Yes, I am a desi too and I absolutely HATE the cultural norms here. Hate is a weak word. I LOATHE them. I have seen aall of them around me. 'Munda parh likh kar bara hoga, te us de baad udi job lagay gi te phir 3-4 saal kam karega aur phir sadi pasand di kuri de naal shadi karega"" I dont know if you understand punjabi lol.  Anyway, like the other guys have said, your mother has no control over this. Yes, we must respect our parents. But first talk to her in a calm and composed way. Explain your feelings to her. Tell her how much you are suffering. Tell her that if she truly loves you, she will let you get married. If all else fails, just go ahead and get married and tell your family that they will have to live with it. If they threaten to disown you, remind them that they are threatening to disown you on such a minor and petty issue. Make them realize this.  I hope and pray that Allah makes it easy for you.   Incorporate this dua in your daily life 'Rabbana hablana azwajina wa zurriyaatina qurrata a'yun"" (http://quran.com/25/74)  I am here if you need any sort of help. :)"
MuslimNoFap,2thrhh,HEARMMEROAR,2,Sun Jan 25 07:27:49 2015 UTC,"Salaams brother,  Thanks for posting, I have a few comments:   Although I keep falling for porn after 9-10 days, I still sincerely believe that I am not addicted   I have news for you, as your brother in Islam and comrade in fighting this monster, I can tell you that you ARE indeed addicted. It's ok, accept it. Only when you accept that you are an addict can you begin to sincerely address the problem and stop denying it. Check out Fortify Program and the Accountability Partner links in the Sidebar.   My need for human touch and human companionship has become overwhelming   I completely understand this concern as many Eastern cultures tend to have little to no hugging, lovey-dovey touching or cuddling...etc. Although it is not exactly cuddling, I suggest you try a grappling martial art like Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Sambo, Judo or Wrestling. Again, it is entirely different than the human touch you are looking for but it does fulfill a sense of a human, brotherly connection. Check out this article on the Psychology of grappling sports.   However, my mother objected and threatened to disown me for life   This is a very tough situation. I ask Allah to help you with it and open the mind and heart of your mother to what is best for you. The only way through this is if you speak with your mother, with utmost respect, about how her objection has affected you; how as a man of your age, you need to get married soon and you're afraid of falling into haraam (very true since porn is haram).  All the best brother!"

I feel so great. Alhamdulillah"
MuslimNoFap,2ta4bv,yrooney,2,Thu Jan 22 16:58:27 2015 UTC,"I wasn't part of the January challenge, but I feel compelled to contribute anyway.  Firstly, well done to all of you that have made it so far. Masha-allah. You are all inspirational.  Secondly, I fell off the wagon this past weekend. It was immediately after my parents left, after they spent a fun-filled couple of days with me. I was bored (after all that social excitement), lonely, sad and tired. I knew what I was doing was haraam, but I rationalized that I was feeling down and needed the happiness boost. Sure, I was happy for a few moments, but I've been feeling rather empty over the last few days since then. I don't think I've felt this pointless and empty before. It's scary.  I will sign up for the next month and stick with my commitment, insha-allah."
MuslimNoFap,2ta4bv,Vicegripper1,2,Fri Jan 23 00:04:19 2015 UTC,maa shaa Allah! feeling solo :-) great about dis. my counter star is such in a green glow. neva made it 30 days before except i ramadhan. but had a mix yday. had eye contact with a girl yday and I couldn't lower my gaze.

I have been on reddit for 54 days and this is the best group I joined and I thank Allah for that and all the brothers and sisters who started this noble cause and those who are helping this call.   I am doing better in life in general as a result of refraining from this evil habit and Alhamdulillah thanks to this Muslim nofap group and other tools Allah has made it easier   Personally I am so grateful to be in this group as those suffering the same issue as me can really appreciate the pain of the problem, how to alleviate the pain and find the solution. O Allah you really are generous!!"
MuslimNoFap,2ta4bv,Ddjoker,1 point,Thu Jan 22 18:22:35 2015 UTC,"Walaikum Salaam,  It's been a while now, alhamdulillah. You know what they say about your confidence increases? I can definately feel that now.  Another thing I've noticed is that i'm generally more optimistic, which is the best part. Difficult to explain but this experience gives me things to look forward to - that better things are coming. I definately don't feel as sad and depressed anymore. I think the dots are finally connecting; Through nofapping I can finally have khushoo in my prayers, like actually focus on the things I'm saying and not thinking about other disgusting stuff. And through praying, I feel that my relationship with Allah swt is growing closer. I pray He makes us from those who guard their private parts and grants us the strength to endure this challenge."

So today morning I cut the hard line(no internet connection till March on PC). I'm extremely thankful to Allah for my progress. May ALLAH make this easy for us and guide us to the straight path."
MuslimNoFap,2ta4bv,DubstepStairs,1 point,Fri Jan 23 10:08:20 2015 UTC,ma shaa Allah!! its been a great feeling. have seen that one of d big secrets is taking it a day at a time and don't concentrate on the end of the challenge but on quitting. may Allah keep us firm. and reward the brains behind this reddit.
