Fibromyalgia,3e54sx,levi4884,5,Wed Jul 22 01:01:49 2015 UTC,"Have you guys done a complete reset on her life yet? Gone down to the absolute basics, use the freshest and simplest ingredients for food, clothes and soaps, ect. Drink tons of water and no mater what do some type of exercise daily and go outside daily. Then you start a log of how she feels every day, all day, what she ate, when, meds taken, bowel movements, sleep cycles, ect ect. You should start to see patterns and then you have to start changing them and seeing how you can change her life.   What about medical cannabis?"
Fibromyalgia,3e54sx,PeacefulTreeLand,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:32:21 2015 UTC,"We've gone down various paths, like eating more organics, avoiding any specific foods out chemicals that may cause flares, etc. In general we both eat very healthy. I don't think we get fast food even once per month.  She's not that great at drinking lots of water, though. Her clothes could be a little looser as well from time to time. I don't know if she's ever kept a log of how she's felt from day to day. Unfortunately, medical cannabis is not legal where we live. However, the state is evaluating cannabis oils and other non-smokeable forms for medical use. I really hope they legalize something soon because I really wonder if it would help."
Fibromyalgia,3e54sx,Tarbaby-Jenkins,2,Wed Jul 22 13:07:14 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry you're both experiencing this! First, keep being the awesome supportive husband you're being right now. In general, having heating pads or ice at the ready is always helpful. Epsom salt can be a life saver in a hot bath for some.  Eating healthy and getting proper nutrition, certain vitamins have really helped people. Lots of rest, having a very comfy bed is a biggie for me personally. I have a pillow top with a 4 inch foam topper to alleviate pressure points. Eliminate stress and learn how to say no to nonessential activities when flaring. Plus, take good care of yourself! You can't be a care giver if you're burnt out and run down. I hope more people chime in with even better advice. Good luck and lots of positive thoughts coming your way!"
Fibromyalgia,3e54sx,akslavok,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:50:06 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestions. Our bed isn't the softest. We've added a foam topper pad to it but I really don't think it helped much. I told her last night I thought we should get a new extra soft bed and maybe even one where you can incline the head and feet sections. A new mattress would hopefully help her sleep a little better. She rarely sleeps well.
Fibromyalgia,3e54sx,FibroMan,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:10:43 2015 UTC,Any chance she's having migraines?  My migraines were misdiagnosed as Fibro for years.  I would now say my migraines are secondary to any/all symptoms of fibro.
Fibromyalgia,3e54sx,Zygomycosis,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:46:03 2015 UTC,"Definitely not migraines. I get where you're coming from, though. My sister recently felt very ill for days and that turned out to be from a silent migraine. They treated her for a migraine and her symptoms went away."
Fibromyalgia,3e54sx,Tarbaby-Jenkins,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:12:50 2015 UTC,"If gabapentin works then Lyrica might work too?  Often the only reason gabapentin is used is because the patent for it has expired and it is cheaper.  Lyrica is probably more effective.  Softer beds are better than hard.  You can get a soft topper to go on your existing bed.  Stretchy clothes are better than clothes that can rub.  If she doesn't get any exercise then you need to find a way to help her get some sort of exercise, which might be walking for now but preferably swimming.  It isn't so much that exercise helps as resting doesn't help.  Make sure that you look after yourself and that you don't get stressed.  If you are happy then she doesn't have to worry about you.  She isn't going to be jealous of your happiness.  Understand that she is never going to be pain free.  She will probably be in less pain than she is right now, but fibro is for life.  Avoid asking her too many questions.  Fibro fog makes answering questions really hard.  Make sure she accepts herself, fibro and all, and do the same.  You might be able to help her a little, but fibro isn't something that can be fixed.  Accept her as she is."
Fibromyalgia,3e54sx,Zygomycosis,0,Wed Jul 22 09:26:25 2015 UTC,Why is she on morphine if she can't stop vomiting?  That makes no sense.
Fibromyalgia,3e54sx,Tarbaby-Jenkins,2,Wed Jul 22 02:31:20 2015 UTC,She's probably on zofran as well. Every time I've been on morphine in the ER they automatically give me a shot of zofran too. Just a thought.
Fibromyalgia,3e54sx,Zygomycosis,-2,Wed Jul 22 02:44:01 2015 UTC,I am aware of how that works.  I'm a doctor.  I don't understand why someone would go to the emergency room with vomiting and then claim they need narcotics.  This screams drug seeker to me.
Fibromyalgia,3e54sx,Tarbaby-Jenkins,4,Wed Jul 22 02:47:36 2015 UTC,"Well, personally I had h. Pylori and gallstone attacks. So, lots and lots of pain plus vomiting.  Vomiting in and of itself can cause a fibro flare up for me, thus creating a pretty intense amount of pain. Out of curiosity, do you have fibro or are you here as a doctor? It might help clarify your position. It's not very nice to automatically assume someone is drug seeking.  Edit: in the post OP doesn't say she went to the ER and asked for narcotics. Pretty harsh to focus on the meds when the husband is asking for any and all suggestions to help."
Fibromyalgia,3e54sx,Zygomycosis,-1,Wed Jul 22 02:54:45 2015 UTC,"I do not have fibromyalgia.  I am a psychiatrist as well as an internist so I do have some professional interest in the condition.  I also myself suffer from a disease with chronic pain.  I really don't want to automatically assume someone is a drug seeker, it is just hard to fight the urge."
Fibromyalgia,3e54sx,FibroMan,4,Wed Jul 22 02:57:01 2015 UTC,"I see. As someone with chronic pain I'd imagine you understand the importance of going in for treatment and having the doctor believe you. Fibro can be devastating mentally when the patient is not taken seriously, it can feel quite hopeless. I hope for your own patients sake you can keep an open mind when it comes to these things. I find it interesting that out of OPs post you focused on the narcotics and completely ignored his plea for help. If you suffer from chronic pain and have the education of a psychiatrist and internest surely you have some wisdom to share. I'm not trying to be negative or snarky  so please don't read it that way. You acknowledged yourself that it's hard not to think that way and in the world we live I can understand how drugs and drug seeking behavior is a huge problem!"
Fibromyalgia,3e54sx,Decepticle_Ronnie,-1,Wed Jul 22 03:08:35 2015 UTC,"This is why I went with that issue.  I guess I was subconsciously trying to get to the bottom of the problem.  Almost all of the patients I've ever seen with diagnosed fibromyalgia have had many psychiatric comorbidities.  Once we understand the comorbidities the underlying fibromyalgia symptoms will often disappear.  I find it disheartening that a lot of patients will chase the dragon of pain relief when instead they should be trying to figure out what is causing their pain.  Narcotic pain relief is an endless pit that leads to very bad places.  If we can figure out the underlying pathology, we need to.  I have no problem with narcotic pain relief in a patient who is undergoing further psychiatric and physiologic testing.  I have a problem when the pain relief and euphoria associated with narcotics becomes the be all end all."
Fibromyalgia,3e54sx,first52,2,Wed Jul 22 03:20:53 2015 UTC,"Fibro symptoms don't disappear, they can only be reduced.  Most people with fibro don't have a bunch of psychiatric comorbidities.  I am pretty sure that nobody with fibro takes enough narcotics to feel euphoria.  The most effective way to reduce the problems caused by fibro is to reduce the pain levels.  The fact that narcotics don't work in the long run and nothing else is as effective is not the patient's fault.  Increasing pain relief during a temporary ""physical"" problem is a good way to avoid a flare.  Questioning the use of morphine when the patient has nausea is fair enough, but you crossed a line by calling a fibro sufferer a drug seeker."

Fibromyalgia,3e54sx,Zygomycosis,1 point,Wed Jul 22 11:33:14 2015 UTC,"Being that you are a psychiatrist it makes sense that patients with psychological issues are the ones you see. FMS, once a wastebasket diagnosis, is still seen by many as the by-product of mental disorders when it is not. It's both tiresome and unhelpful to have medical personnel constantly delve for ""deeper issues"" instead of treating the symptoms."
Fibromyalgia,3e54sx,akslavok,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:18:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not a doctor, but the above post is also striking me as odd. Current theory: sufferer has another condition that is being 'amplified' by the fibro, or the other condition is the primary cause of pain. Being on morphine seems very intense for a purely fibro case. Plus the nausea is in fitting in here very well either..."
Fibromyalgia,3e54sx,Zygomycosis,0,Wed Jul 22 03:19:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly.   Opiates will often mask the physical symptoms of some underlying pathology.  Opiates can even revert someone out of a depressive episode.  Too many doctors are too quick to throw narcotics at patients and say ""not my problem""."

Sometimes there's too much pain and I have to give up or take it easy. Right now the gabapentin is helping me a lot, physically  and I work two jobs for a total of 60 hours or so a week.

I have a very physical job and this helps. My fridge is always stocked full of Monsters, and I smoke pot. Pot is not legal everywhere, so that may not be an option for you, but for someone without insurance, it's a huge sense of relief.  I have spoken with my managers (it took me awhile to feel comfortable with this) and explained my situation and answered any questions they had about fibro.  On days when I'm having a flare up,  I call several hours in advance and ask for a smaller section or one close to the kitchen. I try not to call in sick unless I absolutely have to, and if I do have to call in,  I try to find someone to cover my shift.  As a server/bartender, sometimes you can pay other people to carry heavy things for you or trade you for first cut.  Be an asset. Learn how to be the best in your position, and absorb all knowledge you can (whether it has to do with your position or not). Be nice to everyone, and be a team player. When you do have to ask for favors, they won't mind as much.  I don't go out. I hang out at home and I very rarely drink.

I have fibro, neuropathy,  Reynauds,  and about to see a neuro for possible ms.  I was worried going into it but I let my artist know and he reassured me that I wasn't the first person he's tattooed with chronic pain problems.    I've actually found that having fibromyalgia has given me a much higher pain tolerance. I am also much better at doing things to ignore the pain like reading during a tattoo.    It's all going to depend on the individual person and being comfortable with the artist. I can't stress being comfortable enough. I'm lucky that my artist now is a friend of mine that was at my wedding but I've also been tattooed by strangers that did not make me feel comfortable or welcome.  I think that makes the biggest difference."

My only complaint is during healing the skin around it hurt, I can't remember the term off the top of my head with the fog today.

He did see me very sick before we got married,but it's never the same going from seeing a person most days to living with them and feeling the absolute devastation that the disease can have.This is something to have in mind,and it will put love to the absolute test,but if it's true and you are both willing to work on it and compromise and validate your partner's feelings however painful they might be (and viceversa),you might just make it.It also gets a lot easier after the first 3 years I would say,just because you have already gone through a big emotional process.This is if you always keep an open line of communication.You need better communication than a normal couple even if you expect to survive together.  All in all,despite this,he has stayed by my side,out of the tremendous love that I know he has for me,and his willingness to make efforts and fight for and collaborate in our relationship.  Also,take into account have also done the same for him in other areas where he had serious issues,because nobody is perfect.It's always hard for both people to work through a relationship.  We did a lot of therapy right from the beginning of our marriage to work on both our issues and I'm pretty sure that was a big part and kinda saved everything.  Anyone with fibro or that is in a relationship with a patient should benefit from therapy,'cause this bitch will kick your ass emotionally and test your every boundary and strength,and maturity. Although,if you make it through those first years,you rise glorious like the Phoenix,and almost unbeatable as a couple.Just like any extreme situation would for a relationship.  it takes the strongest love and will to work on it.Acceptance is a huge part of it."
Fibromyalgia,3e14oe,quiltcentric,3,Tue Jul 21 06:15:17 2015 UTC,"We just had our 35th anniversary. Granted, I was young and healthy when we met and married, and when the fibro started sneaking up on me we'd already been married 10 years.  It gradually got worse until I was finally diagnosed about 12 years ago.  He's been nothing but kind, understanding and supportive as we've dealt with this together.  I know it's not quite the same as a guy just having to jump into the relationship and condition together and try to deal with it -- but there are certainly guys who are willing to make the effort, and to succeed, even when it comes as a surprise after the relationship is established.    It's true there are a lot of stories about guys who leave when chronic conditions come up, but maybe we hear more about it in the case of fibro because so many of the sufferers are women (hence more SO's are men) and not because men are less caring, compassionate or understanding.  I think the key is that we feel we are dealing with it together."
Fibromyalgia,3e14oe,vanessalovesturtles,2,Tue Jul 21 09:05:10 2015 UTC,"I've managed a four year relationship, still going strong.  I'm gay though so, still no evidence of a supportive man.  We met the same year I got diagnosed, and it hasn't been easy. There was definitely a period of time about two years in where neither of us thought it was going to work out. She felt like she couldn't handle it, and I didn't really want to deal with someone who couldn't. Kind of have my own issues to deal with, you know? (Not that I don't support her when she has stuff going on, but there's never going to be a work around for Fibro. Deal with it or go.)  It definitely takes dedication. At this point, I really can't see anything Fibro related separating us, for what it's worth."

Fibromyalgia,3e0pge,Nebulaxoox,2,Tue Jul 21 01:40:46 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, you may need to rethink your college and career plans.  I had to as well.  I was in nursing school when my symptoms became really unbearable.  I changed my major to a BS in Physiology (still in the same area of study, but slightly more rigorous academically) and now plan to get a Lab Tech certification with my degree.  I'll still be working in the same hospital environment, but without the patient care, time on my feet, and heavy lifting associated with nursing."
Fibromyalgia,3e0pge,whenifeellikeit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:10:45 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up, lab tech is easier than nursing for sure but you have to stand at the bench all day and some hospitals make you go up to the floors/ER and do phlebotomy. No heavy lifting though, that's for sure.   I was in my lab tech clinicals this spring when I began to get really sick. I ended up in the ER and recently I got my fibro diagnosis. I made it through school and graduated but it was really rough.   My main problem was that my symptoms manifest as severe neck pain, migraines, fatigue and dizziness. Medical lab work involves a lot of looking through microscopes which is the worst thing imaginable for my symptoms. I am not working currently, trying to get my health under control but I am afraid I went through all this school and I am not going to be able to perform the job. :(  My advice would be to avoid hospitals/shifts that make you run around and draw your own blood samples. If you can get into blood bank or micro you get to sit down a lot more."
Fibromyalgia,3e0pge,MechaBeluga,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:28:02 2015 UTC,"You may want to reconsider vet tech school. I would have picked a different career path if I'd known I was sick. It's nearly as physically exhausting as kennel work and the shifts are much longer, like 10-12 hours."
Fibromyalgia,3e0pge,WhoAreYouWhoAmI,2,Tue Jul 21 04:27:55 2015 UTC,"I just had to quit my vet tech career of 7 1/2 years. I'm only 27 years old.  If you find it hard doing kennel work trust me, vet tech will knock you on your ass.  If you really want to stick with the veterinary field, look into doing laboratory work. That was usually my favorite part of the job anyway."

Fibromyalgia,3e0pge,MechaBeluga,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:15:55 2015 UTC,"If you want some animal experience for your resume you can always volunteer at a shelter or rescue. That way you can go when you feel up to it for as long or short as you want.  If you are in a position to you could also try fostering some young or special needs animals. You wouldn't need to even leave the house for animal experience except to take them to the vets or adoption events. Doing hospice and special needs fostering gave me a ton of experience with sub q fluids, shots and meds in general."

The birds sang and the flowers bloomed, and oh look! A butterfly! And the ENERGY! OMG I got so much done that day, and my mood was great!  Second day I was jittery. Third day I was edgy and bitchy and I couldn't sleep that night. I was up all night like a hamster running on his little wheel. Boogedy, boogedy!

It gets a bit confusing halfway through the explanation so I'm not sure I entirely grasp it. All the same, I'm keen for more research on that.  I get burning feelings in my legs from time to time, not so much pain as heat, and in summer I felt like I was going to spontaneously combust half the time. I took to lying on the floor with an ice pack and a fan. My understanding is that our bodies' heat regulation is off, and you need to keep yourself cool in hot weather."

Fibromyalgia,3dztkk,shinymetalass,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:29:30 2015 UTC,"What are a few of the most popular theories behind the causes of fibromyalgia?   It is pretty hard to define a ""cause"" without first defining what the core fibro symptoms are and what the biological pathology is.  A popular theory is that there is no pathology, that fibro is on the same spectrum as chronic fatigue syndrome, and that similar to blood pressure everybody is on the spectrum somewhere, but that it is only called a disease when it starts to cause problems.  I hate that theory.  For starters, I think CFS and fibro are completely different, and the ""no pathology"" theory doesn't explain why fibro isn't reversible.  A popular group of theories are the ""fibro as another disorder"" group of theories.  Small fiber neuropathy and thyroid hormone resistence fall into this category.  Carefully designed studies have shown that unrealistically high percentages of fibro sufferers fall into these categories, which together add up to more than 100% of people with fibro, which isn't mathematically possible.  The main theory of what fibromyalgia ""is"" is called ""central sensitization"", where pain levels are increased at the level of the spinal cord.  It is pretty indisputable that central sensitization occurs in people with fibro, but it is unclear as to whether it is the cause or a consequence of chronic pain.  The trigger for fibro can easily be blamed on the usual suspects.  Poor diet, lack of exercise, stress, or infections happen all the time in people's lives and are easy scape goats.  The theory than an autoimmune response triggers fibro has some merit, based on the association between Lupus and fibro, but there is no evidence that fibro sufferers have tissue damage or improve when on immunosuppressants.  Some severe cases of fibro may be caused by specific genetic variations.  There was a study in Mexico that identified a variation in a voltage gated sodium ion channel gene, but in most cases the same genes for major depressive disorder put a person at risk of fibro more than any other genetic factors.  The most ridiculous theory that I have read is that fibro is a problem with opioid pathways.  The argument is that symptoms of fibro are kind of like opioid withdrawal, therefore they must be the exact same thing.  Obviously there are a lot more theories, none of which are any good, therefore one can only conclude that fibro is impossible.  And yet, here we are!"
Fibromyalgia,3dypmd,brohemoth06,5,Mon Jul 20 16:49:03 2015 UTC,"Melatonin and physical activity are the best means I've discovered to improve deep sleep.  That and extreme sleep hygine.   Xyrem is so controlled, I've never actually met anyone that's had a prescription for it. It's GHB, a drug routinely abused for both recreation and to commit sexual abuse/rape. I know it will occasionally be prescribed to Nacroleptics, and there is some evidence it helps Fibromyalgia, but yeah. You have to go to special pharmacies and everything to even get it."
Fibromyalgia,3dypmd,StochasticLife,2,Mon Jul 20 16:58:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not very familiar with fibromyalgia (that's why I'm here!)  Xyrem made me think of ar/modafinil, commonly prescribed for narcolepsy. Do you or anyone here know of any benefit in fibromyalgia? Works completely differently so I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't, but I know it's found much more commonly in retail pharmacies than Xyrem."
Fibromyalgia,3dypmd,SlimSlamtheFlimFlam,4,Mon Jul 20 20:24:15 2015 UTC,"Mondafinil would likely have little to no impact on someone with Fibromylagia.   One of the theories about Fibro is that it may be related to deep wave sleep disruptions. Xyrem is one of the few drugs that really puts you to sleep, in a way your body can actually use.   At this point, the Xyrem angle is tangential, but really all treatments are grasping at straws.   Lyrica and Savella are the 'traditional' treatment choices these days. neither of which did a damn for me."
Fibromyalgia,3dypmd,StochasticLife,2,Mon Jul 20 20:34:12 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thank you for taking the time to explain :) that explains the trazodone. And the Lyrica. And the Xyrem. It all fits!"

This was part of trying to get my fibro symptoms under control.  It was quite restorative although it may have played a role in triggering the most severe depressive episode in my life.  My recollection from a few years ago is that the Xyrem trials for fibromyalgia showed it helpful but the FDA blocked approval due to safety concerns.

Fibromyalgia,3dypmd,lbsmith5,0,Tue Jul 21 12:23:13 2015 UTC,I don't think drugs are the answer here. If she had a sleep study and her sleep came back normal then you need to look at other things. Look at what she does when she is awake. How healthy is she over all? What does she eat? How much physical activity does she get? She is obviously sleeping fine. You cannot make her sleep more than fine. :)

I am the same way - I will sleep 12 hours if uninterrupted and feel no better than if sleeping 7 or 8 hours. A doctor explained to me that patients with fibro often have issues hitting deep sleep, and when they do, hitting it enough to get restful sleep.  OP, I am on trazadone and used to be on lyrica as well (on gabapentin now - it seems to work better for sleep and nerve issues for me anyway). How much trazadone does she take? I had to take a higher dose at first to get started and then dropped to a lower maintenance dose.

Fibromyalgia,3dxz9t,koiotchka,2,Mon Jul 20 13:28:38 2015 UTC,"I hesitate to mention it, because it didn't work for me personally, but I recently came across this device that is marketed in part towards FMS pain: https://www.quellrelief.com/  It's based on TENS, but is supposedly much more intense and focuses on generalized pain relief.  You wear it throughout the day and it kicks off hour long treatments every hour.  Feels similar to any other TENS treatment, if you've had one before.  I don't have typical symptoms, so it's possible this would work better for others.  THe nice thing is that there is a 60 day trial period, so I was able to return it after I decided it wasn't helping me.  Anyway, I was excited about it for the same reasons you're looking for non medication options, so thought I'd share.  It sounds like you're trying all the right things otherwise, and I wish your doctors were more helpful.  I'd first try to find a new doc, but I can udnerstand the situation of not wanting to get on heavy meds for your entire life - I'm in the same boat having had this start in my early 20s.  No meds really help me though.    You might also want to look into a pain clinic that deals with biofeedback specifically.  I went to one a decade ago that had a lot of cool toys - and I think if my symptoms were a little different it might have worked better.  You just need to go to a place that understands what's going on, and wants to work with you to help you cope with it in a way that's safe in the long-term.  Good luck!"

Seriously, nothing has helped my pain more than weed, and it's the ONLY thing that helps with the stiffness. If I had the money I'd smoke a joint twice a day. I highly recommend trying it if you haven't. Plus, with narcotics, sometimes you can get ""kickback"" after you stop using them, so even though it helped your pain at the time as soon as you stop taking them you'll be in worse pain than you were in the first place. My doctor won't even consider narcotics for fibro patients for that reason. I also take 300mg 3 times a day of Neurontin, tho it doesn't do anything but make me sleepy."

I just wish I could reach some point of stability so I could focus on learning and building a future instead of surviving day to day.

Fibromyalgia,3dwqyt,sangvine,3,Mon Jul 20 16:32:54 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way. Last time I was working full time I was sleeping < 4 hours a night and walking through my day like a zombie. I had waves of vertigo and was barely functioning by the end of it, and that was before fibro really sort of kicked off. I'm living at home with my mother at the moment, trying to start a consultancy business with my father so I can work my own hours, but it's really really discouraging to still be in the same place I was years ago. I want my own place so much, but house prices here are astronomical and rising by about $80k a year thanks to investments and speculation.   Like you I try not to think about the future, because I just can't imagine anything changing. In fact, my pain levels are relatively mild compared to a lot of fibromites, but I can tell they're getting worse over time, and I live in fear of what might be down the line. Opiates like morphine and codeine have no affect on me at all and I'm afraid that in 10 years I'll be in horrific pain and no medication will do anything.   God, sorry. I really needed to get that off my chest."

Fibromyalgia,3dwqyt,sangvine,2,Mon Jul 20 07:09:03 2015 UTC,I got morphine when I had my appendix removed and I started to think the nurses were slipping me placebos because it wasn't doing shit. The paracetamol was more effective. Then I figured people were just exaggerating about how good morphine was. Then I was put on codeine when I got my wisdom tooth removed and it didn't do anything either.... that's when it clicked that I'm apparently invulnerable to some opioids. ;) Pretty unhelpful as super powers go.

That's sort of a familiar fibro thing for me... Whatever I did wrong yesterday, will hurt me today! I was hurting all over, dismissed it as a flare. It took me a week to realize it wasn't fibro fuckery at all... I sprained my foot. The rest of me hurt so much more that I didn't really notice. Walking around on it and trying to stretch it out like usually I do for sore stiff fibromuscles actually made it worse."

I also passed two kidney stones on vacation at my best friends wedding. One right when we got off the plane in the airport, and once later at the hotel.

Fibromyalgia,3dtf61,lbsmith5,2,Mon Jul 20 05:57:44 2015 UTC,"Last week, I had a colonoscopy/egd done to diagnose possible IBD. Afterwards, I felt super achy in my throat, neck, and upper abdomen. I assumed it was fibro and let them discharge me. Went home, took a nap, woke up more sore. I STILL thought it was fibro, or maybe from sleeping on the couch. 1am rolls around and I am in so much pain I can't breathe and my chest is tight. I looked at the ""complications"" section of my sheet and it says to call the GI Fellow on call, so I do. She tells me I'm probably not dying, but that my symptoms make absolutely no sense and ""it wouldn't be unreasonable to go to the ER"". My fiancee is sleeping and I don't wanna wake her up, and I figure it's probably a weird fibro thing, so I decide if I still feel like crap in the morning I'll go. My gastroenterologist calls me first thing in the AM and it turns out I'm having a reaction to the anesthesia!! Postoperative myalgia. It's super rare, unrelated to fibro, usually happens to healthy muscular people (which is the opposite of me), and won't go away for another 4 days. It felt like I got hit by a truck, went for the hardest workout ever, and then got hit by another truck. Literally. If I had mentioned anything at the hospital they could have given me painkillers for it, but I didn't say anything. I only just started feeling ""normal"" today, but my muscles are still kinda tender. In the future, that's the first thing I have to tell my anesthesiologist, so that they can try to keep it from happening again."

Fibromyalgia,3doky9,ilikemazdas,9,Fri Jul 17 23:40:54 2015 UTC,"Guys,I've been using this for years now.It's one of the things that make the nightmare bearable.At first,it's hard to stand it for more than 30 seconds,but with time,you start to get the hang of it. At first I used to lay on it with light clothes on..but now I always use it directly on my skin. The secret it to lay on it until you start feeling heat on the area that's being ""acupressured""..then you can take it off,and I'm telling you,for me it reduces pain temporarily,which as we all know is a relief.I think it's because it stimulates blood flow to the area.  It's specially effective if you cut out a small piece of it or if you take out one of the spiked plastic figures and apply it directly at the trigger point (I have a weird one on my elbow). It was so helpful that I actually bought more than one,cut them it pieces of different sizes with scissors(the foam is soft enough),and use them for different purposes.This allow me to have a travel size for example,since I never leave home without it. I also bring pieces with me to difficult situations when I know I will be uncomfortable or in pain because of sitting for too long,etc.. It's wonderful for the hands and feet,and can save the day,at least in my experience.  Since I sew,I plan on experimenting more with this to make some gadgets that I can leave on some of my problematic areas. I have even used it to relieve headaches,by applying it directly to my face/head (ouch,I know).  Just beware though,I don't know it it would work this much for everyone,and when you apply it,at first it makes the pain more intense before the heat comes.  My mom also has fibro and I convinced her to get one of these,she's also been using it ever since.  We have nothing to loose,right? we have all tried a lot of stuff.I suggest you try it,since it's not expensive."

Cymbalta (120 mg) worked best on the pain out of all of them but I would 'crack out' if I forgot a dose Tramadol (??? low dose)  made me fall asleep really fast/feel really high. Does work with pain though. Similarly to Lyrica, it just wasn't a plausible every-day solution for me. Currently on amitryptiline, fluoxetine, and buspirone (each is half of the lowest dose possible to start) They are a combination to combat fibro symptoms as well as another unrelated condition. They help my mood a lot, I fall asleep faster, but I wouldn't say my pain is any better. The improvement in peripheral symptoms does make it a little bit easier to cope. Personally, I was really bogged down with depression and I felt everything so much more.  That being said, I would say that I don't have a severe case of fibro so it is definitely a different situation for those of you who are debilitated by pain.  Hope this helps."
Fibromyalgia,3djkcx,sarahbearuh,3,Thu Jul 16 20:36:23 2015 UTC,"I would recommend trying Lyrica first.  In most cases you will know whether it makes you feel better or worse within a week.  If it does work it will probably continue to work for years.  The drug with the strongest affect for me has been Tramadol.  I am currently reducing my daily dose so that I can save it for when I really need it to prevent a flair, eg when I recently caught a cold and sprained a rib at the same time.  Codeine worked as a substitute for Tramadol but after 10 months I became tolerant to codeine so I went back to tramadol.  My main response to pain is tension.  By taking baclofen I have reduced the pain/tension cycle.  Over a year or so I have been able to improve the flexibility of my back joints which is partly due to reduced tension.  I also take an antihistamine, but I am not entirely sure why it helps.  It might be reducing pressure in my head related to my chronic daily headache, but I am not sure.  I have tried other drugs, including amitriptyline and cymbalta, but I have listed the only ones that were worth taking for me."
Fibromyalgia,3djkcx,FibroMan,3,Fri Jul 17 01:25:42 2015 UTC,"My husband does well on cymbalta, lyrica, amitryptiline, a flexeril at night to help him sleep better and opiods only when things really, really suck that badly.    Savella made him moody and loopy without making him actually feel any better, so that one was a wash."
Fibromyalgia,3djkcx,braeica,2,Fri Jul 17 02:31:02 2015 UTC,i've taken lyryca and it didn't help. Then I tried cymbalta which was a real nightmare.Never taking that shit again ever.Right now i'm on opioids(fentanyl transdermal)which works the best for me at the moment but is far from perfect.I've tried a shit ton of meds and thats the only one that helps me enough to keep it.
Fibromyalgia,3djkcx,Xilelv,2,Thu Jul 16 23:08:20 2015 UTC,Lyrica messed with my eyesight and it never returned to normal after I stopped and I had weight gain in the 2 weeks I was on it.  Did not touch the pain.  Cymbalta made my heart beat irregularly after only a few days and my doc took me off.    Tramadol works for me but I do not like living on pain pills and only take it rarely.   So basically I take nothing :/
Fibromyalgia,3djkcx,ImSoSassay,2,Fri Jul 17 01:16:10 2015 UTC,I have tried Amitryptiline and Cymbalta with no noticeable relief... Lyrica is too expensive for me and my doctors are hesitant about putting me on opioids because of my age + the side effects.
Fibromyalgia,3djkcx,lolita_pudding,2,Fri Jul 17 03:32:35 2015 UTC,I took Cymbalta for years and I think it delayed the full onset of my fibro. It was shitty coming off of it. Tramadol and opioids works great for flares (no high feeling either. This is not the typical response). Amitriptyline didn't work enough by itself. Gabapentin has been a God send. I'm in so much less pain! I can function again. I'm experiencing a couple of side effects from it. Nothing I can't handle or manage.
Fibromyalgia,3djkcx,pesh527,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:20:06 2015 UTC,"I never get 'high' from opioids either (though the first day I took Lyrica, I apparently was a hoot).

Fibromyalgia,3djkcx,lbsmith5,2,Fri Jul 17 16:53:34 2015 UTC,"Savella - did nothing.  Lyrica - did nothing for my pain, but did give me a ton of side effects, like nausea, weight gain, and worsening of my depression.  Gabapentin - did nothing, and gave me slight nausea. Not as bad as Lyrica, however.  Flexeril - helped a little, but my insurance no longer covers it. I'm on a different muscle relaxant now, which does nothing (go figure).  Cymbalta - I'm actually on it for my depression, not the fibro, but I haven't noticed a difference in pain levels. Haven't really noticed much of a difference in my depression yet, either.  The only thing that's come close to taking the pain away is Norco, but obviously that's not a great long term solution. I still take it as necessary, but given how easy it is to get used to the smallest dose, I wish I could find something better. I don't want to be on and off narcotics for the rest of my life. :(  Anyway, good luck to you, and to everyone here. I hope we all find good ways to manage our pain."
Fibromyalgia,3djkcx,quiet156,2,Sun Jul 19 05:49:34 2015 UTC,"Stay the eff away from Cymbalta. While it helped with my pain, it made me crazy in every other way and coming off it has been a horrific experience; I was on it for six months and it has taken 3 months to work down to 10 mg. I haven't felt like myself in nearly a year--it's a frightening drug!"
Fibromyalgia,3djkcx,whatiseenow,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:54:56 2015 UTC,"I take Savella twice a day and amitriptyline (10 to 30) at bedtime.  With this combination I only rarely need to take ibuprofen.  Before this, I was taking 2400mg of ibuprofen each day and was still in a lot of pain.    Being a nurse on a very busy cardiac floor and working 40-60 hours per week, I have to be able to lift, run, do cpr.  With this combination, I'm able to function pretty well."
Fibromyalgia,3djkcx,DoubleD_RN,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:06:08 2015 UTC,"Lyrica - I was on it for two years at 150 mg. I have a feeling it would have worked better at 300 mg, but my insurance wouldn't cover the 150, so I was stuck paying out of pocket. It did work, but it wasn't perfect for me. I'm on 900mg of Gabapentin now and that's working a whole lot better.  Cymbalta also worked for me for a while. I was on it for three years, just got off it for the second time last week. A lot if people have issues going off Cymbalta. I don't - just feel kinda shitty for a day or two - but it's a pretty well known issue. I was on 120 mg at first, cut back to 60mg and it seemed to work just as well. The one side effect I had was awful hot flashes and night sweats. My psychiatrist just switched me to Fetzima, which is like Savella but more emphasis on depression than fibromyalgia since I'm going through a rough patch.   None of the -tryptalines did anything for me.  Tramadol can be helpful. I can't take it everyday or on a consistent basis, because I get awful 'withdrawal' like headaches. If I take one or two when I'm really bad, it will knock some pain out. I am on an opioid pain patch for a previous issue, it's hard to say how much that helps with overall pain."
Fibromyalgia,3djkcx,lbsmith5,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:39:50 2015 UTC,"I was on 50 mg of amitriptyline for about 3 weeks and gained a ton of weight. I was in the process of recovery from anorexia so I did not weigh myself, but it was obvious to myself and other people as well. I was bloated as hell and felt awful. It did help me sleep though.  I am on Cymbalta currently and I like it. Scared of the day I decide to change medications or try to go off of it, though. I've heard the withdrawal is terrible.  I am also on Flexeril which I am not a big fan of, except when I am taking it at night. I take 10 mg in the morning, 10 mg in the afternoon, and 5 mg before bed. The day doses make me tired but definitely help with the pain."

However, I have run out of it a couple of times, and have a) felt more sore and b) got insomnia like a bitch. I do feel like I've gained a little weight, but it's negligible. I did need to buy a bunch of new bras, though. I've gone up a cup size since I started on it."
Fibromyalgia,3djkcx,sangvine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:59:57 2015 UTC,"Things I've experienced in my health journey  Meloxicam: Did nothing, pooped blood  Amitriptyline: Almost every bad thing on the label, great night's sleep, but waking up to the Sahara and a crusty loogie in your throat every morning ruins it.  Cymbalta: Was wonderful the first time I took it, but was $~11/pill (20mg) and is still quite expensive. Dry mouth was horrendous, but no sinus drainage.  Effexor: Absolutely no fatigue... ever... I didn't sleep- I couldn't breath unless I was focusing on something. Some of the best mii's I ever made in my life.  Cymbalta: It's dropped in price so I'm starting it again- I'm reacting to it differently this time? But I have had less fatigue. Still having a flare up though. Doesn't do much about the muscle soreness but I haven't had any roaming pain. Also, all of my ulcers have healed up. The drymouth isn't as bad this time, though. It has a really short half life, though, so the first few days can be a little awful when it starts to wear off."
Fibromyalgia,3dg9dn,GMU_TheHulk,9,Thu Jul 16 01:04:37 2015 UTC,"I will say that sometimes taking a hot bath with Chamomile and Lavender oils right before I try to go to bed does sometime help. I wouldn't say it ""cures"" my problems, but it does help relieve some of the pain I'm in and Lavender and Chamomile are known to help relax before bed.   I also have the Sleep pillow spray with Lavender and Chamomile from Bath and Body Works that I spray my bed with every night.   They are just little things that only help a little, but I do notice enough a difference to keep doing them. I don't know how you are using the oils, but maybe these would be helpful."

Fibromyalgia,3dgzeu,lbsmith5,3,Thu Jul 16 08:55:29 2015 UTC,Definitely go to a rheumatologist. I have had anxiety my whole life but didn't have depression until after fibromyalgia. They can all be linked. I'm actually on celexa now to help manage them.
Fibromyalgia,3dgzeu,FibroMan,2,Thu Jul 16 10:32:25 2015 UTC,"I got sent off to a psychologist with suspected depression and anxiety.  According to my idiot doctor, my worsening pain was due to the depression lifting.  Over time my achiness gradually moved out to my fingers.  At that point the pain could no longer be blamed on muscle tension from anxiety.  After about 4 months of waiting for specialist appointments I finally got my fibro diagnosis."
Fibromyalgia,3dgzeu,mundabit,2,Thu Jul 16 10:46:07 2015 UTC,"Sometimes you just have to come out and say to your doctor ""I've been seeking support groups for people with my health concerns, to help me learn to manage and cope, Its made me curious about a condition called Fibromyalgia, as my doctor, can you give me more information on this condition, a lot of my friends and family, myself included are curious, as I can relate to people who have fibromyalgia, what are your thoughts?""  I feel like this is one of the better ways to phrase it, It doesn't reek of ""I googled my symptoms and self diagnosed myself with this"" because if doctors suspect that's whats happening (and they often jump to this assumption, even when that's not your intention at all) they spend the time explaining why it's not fibro instead of thinking about the whole, big picture.  This is also a fast way to decide if your doctor is paying attention to new research on Fibromyalgia. I've gone through several GP's because some have said ""Fibromyalgia isn't real"" or ""Fibromyalgia is a specific kind of psycho-somatic pain"" both statements are incorrect, and not helpful attitudes to have from a GP.  With it all said and done, Don't be surprised if you get put back on mood-altering drugs, I know in Australia TCA's are the only approved medication for Fibro (Despite Pregabalin and Gabapentin having approval in the US and UK) so even though my GP recognises my fibromyalgia, all they can give me is anti-depressants to manage it."

Savella is also a good option, but is brand name only so is more expensive. Have you tried tramadol? It's a good pain reliever that won't do the same thing as narcotics in terms of making you loopy and out of it and stuff. I definitely recommend staying away from opioids, in the long run they make pain much much worse if used for maintenance. In terms of other meds, Lyrica would be recommended but you're right that it is really expensive, especially out of pocket copays.  Have you tried regular exercise? I find it super helpful. Water exercise/aerobics are insanely awesome, as is yoga and Pilates. At first it kinda sucks but after about 2 weeks, I felt way better.  Have you tried PT? Apparently that's helpful for some. I also highly recommend acupuncture, I didn't really believe in it but I had so many docs recommend it to me that I tried it, and wow does it help if you find someone good!"
Fibromyalgia,3dgcb6,manipulationcreation,2,Thu Jul 16 03:23:55 2015 UTC,"As great as opiate bliss sounds to some people, I can't live my life that way.   It sounds like you are confusing getting high with taking enough medication to reduce pain.  A tiny dose of 50 mg of Tramadol twice per day could make a bigger difference to your pain than every other medication put together.  In other words, you would still be in a lot of pain but it would be easier to function.  The downsides are that it will probably only work for a few months to a few years, it might not work for you in the first place, you might get intolerable side effects like nausea, and there will be a price to pay when you decide to stop taking it.  As a short term strategy, nothing beats it.  I am currently reducing my dosage of Tramadol as I switch from a short term strategy to a long term strategy.  The non-drug therapy that I am using to control my pain is daily foam rolling.  I had started using it because it was recommended by a physio to help loosen up the joints in my back, which it is very good at doing.  After a few months I noticed that the muscles in my back were no longer as sensitive to pressure, so now I do my arms and legs too.  Getting up off the floor used to be a problem for me, but by foam rolling my leg muscles over several months I can now get up without pain.  The benefit from foam rolling is small but cumulative, which makes it a great long term strategy.  The long term objective is NOT to be drug free.  It is to exercise my body's ability to produce natural pain relieving drugs.  Eventually I hope to no longer need to take pain medications in the form of pills.  Not because drugs are evil or because natural is always best, but because the most effective long term treatment for pain is the placebo effect, ie the psycho-biological drivers of pain sensation.  /end rant"

Both of them are FDA approved medications for the treatment of FMS.  Tricyclic antidepressants help with chronic pain as well.  For me, nothing really gets rid of the pain entirely.  Medication makes it more manageable, especially if I continue exercising and getting regular massages.

It might be worth checking to see if you qualify.  If Lyrica and Savella are out of reach financially, ask your doctor about TCAs.  They were invented in the 1960s, so they should be affordable.  With insurance my nortriptyline was $3.  It looks like a 90 day supply of it would be $10 at Walmart.  Again, I don't find TCAs to work nearly as well as Cymbalta, Savella, or Lyrica, but they're much better than nothing."

How did you meet your support groups?"
Fibromyalgia,3dgcb6,fibro-siesta-fiesta,2,Thu Jul 16 19:26:20 2015 UTC,"Ha! I don't hear that often. You made me laugh.   First on the support groups.... I found them through a combination of Google searches, Meetup site when that was a thing (maybe it is still a thing?) and Facebook. I just typed in my State or City and Fibromyalgia in all these places and ended up finding a good one or two. It's nice to bounce ideas off people (like we do here also) and get together and talk about things.   What medications are you on now? I forgot to ask in my last comment? Cymbalta made me feel awful. Gabapentin didn't do anything for me but my husband takes Topomax which is similiar for nerve pain and it helps him a lot. Have you tried Tramadol? It's not a narcotic but is a bit narcotic like so I am not sure how you would respond to it. I find it helped me when I took it. I try to be ""au natural"" so I don't take it anymore.   The pain never really goes away. I have diffuse pain constantly. But we can really live with that I think. Its the harder more severe pain that really knocks us down. I am concerned (I know I sound like I am being an armchair doctor. I guess I really am being one right now.) about the shocking pains in your legs. That seems more neurological than anything else. Have you spoken with your doctor about those specifically? Have you seen a neurologist just in case? Maybe get a Electromyogram? My husband just had one to determine the severity of nerve damage in his leg. A lot of times we lump everything together as fibro but it may not be. You will get a lot of people saying Oh yeah, I have that too.... Well, still may not be fibro.   Everything I am recommending is science. Even if it is a vitamin etc. I am really against ""woo"" and try to make sure everything is backed up by studies.   Stomach issues - I have much better luck on a paleo type diet. I assume mostly because it cuts out processed foods. My gastroenterologist has told me to specifically try to cut out gluten and dairy.  I feel the difference in inflammation when I eat food I make myself versus just eating anything that strikes my fancy. I also try to limit any type of transfat oils. They are big on inflammation. And just overall eating less. I am fat and have been trying to lose weight and eating at a calorie deficit not only has gotten me 25 pounds down but I feel better on lower calories. Probably less for my stomach to have to deal with!  Dull pain - Yeah this just kind of sucks right? I am sorry you are not in a mmj state. I have to say that topical has helped me the most. But since that is off the table for the moment I would try magnesium oil and epsom salt lotions. Use them often. Also a good epsom salt hot bath really helps. These seem like silly things but as a whole humans are magnesium deficient and there is quite a bit of evidence of magnesium helping fibro pain. To get enough you have to use topical applications since the supplements are a laxative! Seriously, be careful taking the pills. LOL   But... I do take magnesium supplements as much as I can handle. I also take boron and potassium and some vitamin D. I had blood work done and hair analysis that showed I was lacking. My doctor is big on ""test don't guess"" so if you can get tests that would be great. Otherwise I don't think there would be harm in trying it for a couple of months to see if you had any improvement.   I also do one thing that gets me booed in every forum. I don't care.... I tan in tanning beds. I don't go like a beach bunny but I try to go for 10 minutes once a week. Again, there are many studies on tanning and sun exposure helping chronic pain. It's science.   Massage may be good for you also. I religiously get a massage once a month. My therapist is familiar with fibro and they are a therapy type shop not a spa type shop. It makes a huge difference over all. I also will suggest stretching. I am hypermobile and always thought I was fairly flexible but really it was just the hypermobility. When your muscles get tight it hurts so much more. Yoga is great also. Mostly because you stretch, get exercise and meditation in one session."

Fibromyalgia,3dg623,sjhaines,2,Thu Jul 16 01:09:00 2015 UTC,"You should mention it to your doctor, so they can monitor it, just in case. As for remembering things, I go for planners and notebooks. Everything gets written down, just in case I forget it. Plus once it's down I don't have to worry about forgetting it. You might want to try out something like the bullet journal system, if things are escaping you."

Luckily fibro fog is not as bad ;)  I don't remember much about when I was at my worst.  My wife sure does though!  When I get foggy, EVERYTHING is so hard.  For example, I get up to make myself a drink, so my wife asks me to get her a drink too.  My well planned trip to the kitchen is suddenly in ruins, and I can't think of how to adjust my plans.  When I am not foggy I could react without even thinking about it."

It's is an alertness medication mainly for people with daytime sleepiness issues (narcolepsy etc.) It's not for everyone, but I feel fibro fits that category. For me it was worth trying, but I learned a lot from doing the reading first. r/nootropics is a good place to start. I am not recommending it I am just just stating that I have benefited from it. Not living with fog and vagueness all the time has been great."

They said if I took them I would end up in the emergency room with serotonin syndrome guaranteed. Good thing I bothered to check.
Fibromyalgia,3davwy,sangvine,4,Wed Jul 15 00:40:34 2015 UTC,"Sure a lot of those symptoms are fibro-y, but the vision problems could also be related to MS, and the fever comes with autoimmune too. I do think you should get a second opinion and new lab work.   I was on Lexapro for my anxiety (10mg) before starting amitriptyline for fibro and my doctor made sure to keep me at a very low dose and won't up it without taking me off the Lex. You were right to check!"

Fibromyalgia,3davwy,caretothepeople,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:41:03 2015 UTC,"Should I find a new rheumatologist?   Yes. Giving you this diagnosis based on blood test is reckless. I went through so many specialists to get my diagnosis. Cardiology spent ages on me making sure the heart symptoms and chest pain weren't cardiac in nature. Nephrology spent time making sure the pain in my sides and back wasn't coming from my kidneys. Gastroentrology spent ages making sure there were no relevant causes for my digestive issues. Neurology spent even longer checking and double checking everything to make sure there were no issues there. In some cases, I've had second opinions. Only after literal years of investigation did they conclude that it must be down to fibromyalgia or, as this diagnosis actually means, it means they can observe the symptoms and effects but they find no observable cause for them. One blood test is not enough. At the absolute least you should be given a full suite of tests by neurology to rule out any of the other likely causes for your symptoms.  My harsh advice: Put your fears and concerns to the doctors rather than Reddit. If you're not satisfied, say so and be firm about it. And, most of all, do not be afraid to second-guess what medical professionals tell you and never assume that they're always right."

I'm so glad you've had medical professionals be so thorough with your care, I'm thinking at the end of the day I'm going to have to go back to mayo to get that type of comprehensive investigation. The medical system in the area I'm in is quite honestly sub-par, and I do not think I will get anyone who knows what they are talking about around here. This rheumatologist and another doctor I have seen have both said they do not know what half the tests I had at mayo were. If you cannot take the time to pull out a manual or use google (like I did) to know what the tests are then I do not have much faith in you're investigative skills or commitment to going he extra mile.

Fibromyalgia,3d60fv,jemistheonlyhologram,8,Tue Jul 14 03:28:05 2015 UTC,Sadly I had chest pain a few months ago and wouldn't go to see about it because I thought I was just having a super bad  fibromyalgia flare. It turned out to be pulmonary embolisms in both lungs. I could have died except that a good friend pretty much forced me to check it out at the ER after he heard it was keeping me from sleeping. My heart and lungs were damaged. This is the crap part of fibromyalgia. You get so used to feeling awful there is no way to know when there is a bodily  warning sign. It wasn't that much more discomfort than usual. :-'(
Fibromyalgia,3d60fv,dostoevsky4evah,3,Tue Jul 14 08:01:17 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, I'm so sorry to hear that. THIS is my worst fear.

Fibromyalgia,3d60fv,elastical_gomez,5,Tue Jul 14 18:34:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, I will get random symptoms that come and go all the time. I've described it to friends as a game-show wheel with a bunch of bizarre bodily symptoms on it. Never know what's going to happen this week.   Will my arms and legs go numb? Will it be migraines? Will I start sweating buckets out of nowhere? Oooo - maybe I won't have much pain but I'll get to sleep for 3 days straight!   It's seriously so irregular and all over the place, I feel like I'm going crazy too. I've gotten muscle cramps so badly i thought I had a blood clot in my leg once. I wonder sometimes if I have a comorbid condition, but the symptoms come and go so often it's hard to diagnose. I would start a pain journal if you haven't already - it may help you keep track of any patterns for your doctor to look at if you're worried there's something else going on. I've been meaning to do that for a while, but I keep putting it off.   Hope you feel better soon and the carousel of symptoms gives you a break!"

Fibromyalgia,3d60fv,mundabit,3,Tue Jul 14 02:38:12 2015 UTC,"So first off Fibro pain is physical pain like any other. I know what you were trying to say but understand it is actual pain.   Everyone has random pain or odd things going on with their bodies. What you want to focus on is chronic things. Sometimes I get dizzy or sometimes I have my heart flutter or get a cramp or a million other things. That is just life in a body. But if for instance you have shooting pains down your left arm all the time or when you move it a certain way consistently for a period of time, then you should talk to a doctor. If it chronically bothers you or is something that is acute (severe trouble breathing or something) talk to a doctor.   I see a lot of people lump every little thing wrong with them as part of fibro. That is not necessarily the case."

New pain over  6/10: even if it is fibromylgia,  this is a symptom I want my doctor to know about and record in my file.  Pain is consistent over 3 days: lasting 3 days implies I probably have injured myself,  my fibro pain comes and goes and usually won't be consistent even when it is constant.  PQRST of pain  suggests injury or source of pain.   I ignore a lot of pain.  My IUD had been in the wrong position for weeks because I was like ""oh that's just my fibro making my uterus twinge like it does""  or even sciatica ""well I have fibromylgia,  that's not unexpected"""

Fibromyalgia,3d60fv,ZanSquid,4,Tue Jul 14 13:49:25 2015 UTC,"Here is how I am able to start to differentiate... If the pain is chronic in one area for a prolonged period of time or there are other symptoms associated with it such as a rash, redness, or swelling that isn't typically associated with Fibro. Example, I have been having problems with my right shoulder. Initially thought, might be Fibro but the pain and problems persisted for 6 months before I went to the doctor (could have seen the doc sooner but I procrastinated). Turns our I had a rolled shoulder and an impingement not associated with Fibro. My Fibro pain tends to move around so warning bells go off when I have the same type of pain in the same area for longer durations (month or more.) My advice, start listening to your body by doing mindfulness exercises. It's taken me over a decade after my diagnosis to get fairly good at differentiating and even then it's a close call. if it's random and irregular it is usually the fibromyalgia in my case."
Fibromyalgia,3d60fv,ZanSquid,3,Tue Jul 14 05:14:53 2015 UTC,"Everyone is different, and I still struggle with this often, but I find fibro pain to generally be more symmetrical. So both knees hurt, or both shoulders etc. But this generally works for joint pain. I will never tell the difference between a ""normal"" headache and a sinus infection. Or ""normal"" jaw pain and wisdom tooth pain."
Fibromyalgia,3d60fv,wonderwatson,2,Tue Jul 14 02:31:51 2015 UTC,"That's what I kind of figured. These things always seem to be random and in random places though. I feel you on the headaches.

Fibromyalgia,3d60fv,wonderwatson,2,Tue Jul 14 02:36:30 2015 UTC,Excellent answer.  My worst pain is the stabbing pain on both sides of my collarbone. It's a pretty good indicator for fibro pain.

In a certain sort of light, it could make us superheroes."
Fibromyalgia,3d60fv,sangvine,3,Tue Jul 14 02:23:02 2015 UTC,I was just thinking about that the other day.

But I'm 41, overweight and diabetic too, so I will always need to get chest pain examined.   The point is you don't know unless you have an accident and can pinpoint the actual injury. It's one of the many ways fibro sucks.   I've learned the signs and symptoms of heart attack, stroke, kidney infections, etc to help me differentiate. Be mindful of your activities and the weather. Most of all get regular testing and examines by doctors so you have clean bill of health points of reference.   You aren't alone in this."
Fibromyalgia,3d6pg2,Wifeyberk,2,Mon Jul 13 23:15:20 2015 UTC,"He has said that A: there is no test for fibro, and I have too many things (????) And B: that in order to get a fibro diagnosis I must have been showing certain symptoms for x amount of time.   Correct, fibro doesn't show up in any tests and there are no visible signs of it.  The places where it hurts normally move around over months rather than stay in one place.  The pain is not explainable by other symptoms, of which you have a lot, so a fibro diagnosis would be very difficult.  Fibro is chronic, so for an official diagnosis you must have widespread aches and pains for at least 6 months.  I was diagnosed quite quickly.  It only took 9 months.  What do you mean by ""I lose a word, randomly""?  Do you mean that you skip a word, that you have trouble thinking of a word, that you simply cannot recall a word or that you say the wrong word?  Are you aware that you are making mistakes or does someone else point it out?  A rheumatologist normally diagnoses fibro, but in your case you have a lot of nerve related symptoms so you would need to see a neurologist first."
Fibromyalgia,3d6pg2,FibroMan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:44:05 2015 UTC,"Sometimes you need to push your doctor or find a new one. Some just in general suck at their job unless they are diagnosing the flu. They like patients that are easy to fix. It's ok to get a new one.  You need to schedule to get your blood work done and then if it all comes back negative ask to see a rheumatologist. It's important to get all the other tests done first to make sure it's not something else. This includes a MRI with contrast to check for lessons. It could possibly be MS.   Don't ever let your doctor have full control of the situation. If you feel ill then you keep showing up until he checks every possible thing. And YES there is test for fibromyalgia. There is just no test that can show chemically that you have it. But trained professionals like rheumatologists have tests they conduct that can diagnose it. If you're lucky the few medicines they have for it will help. But if you're like the majority of us you have to accept the pain, exhaustion, and overwhelming struggle.   If you live in a place that has medical marijuana or recreational marijuana give that a try. Certain strains can help. It's best to go to a place that has medical because they have certain strains that help better than others.  It took doctors 2 years to figure mine out. And my specialist believes I've been dealing with it since I was at least twelve. That's when daily migraines started and have seen a neurologist since. I wasn't diagnosed until I was 26. Patience is key. If my flair ups didn't become as terrible as they are I probably wouldn't know yet. I wouldn't have kept pressing for answers. I would have just kept dealing with the pain, migraines, fatigue, muscle spasms, etc."
Fibromyalgia,3d4zyr,jlmitch12,2,Mon Jul 13 15:57:00 2015 UTC,"It's still hard to find a good GP who really understamds fibro. I saw a muscloskeletal specialist twice who put me on Lyrica, then promptly retired, forgetting to write a letter back to my GP as requested, even though I specifically requested it on my GP's behalf. I then moved house & my new GP told me 'nothing else could be done' even though the max dosage of Lyrica isn't giving me enough relief.  Well I switched back to the doctor's surgery I grew up attending. It's more of a drive, but the new doctor I'm seeing there is more helpful. I'm booked to see a pain management physio now, so shall see how that goes. I still don't feel this GP fully gets what I'm going through, but at least she is willing to try.   I am glad to hear that you finally have the dystonia diagnosis. I think I just have fibro, I do get muscle spasms, but nothing like you described. Your post could really help someone who suspects something more than fibro is going on. Best wishes to you."
Fibromyalgia,3d4zyr,jacaranda_tree,3,Mon Jul 13 18:15:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Indeed, finding a good GP is critical. I'm lucky because my mom knows my current doc. He actually took me on after talking to my mom and hearing how complicated my health is (a wide, unusual array of both neuro and autoimmune symptoms). He finds me fascinating, like a puzzle or something. He's actually made more progress re: my autoimmune symptoms than my rheumy has, and I may actually fire my rheumy and allow my GP to refer me to a specialist he knows at the Medical University of South Carolina. I'm very lucky to have him, and wish more doctors were like him."

Fibromyalgia,3d3epa,brummybookworm,3,Mon Jul 13 05:12:28 2015 UTC,"yeah, this is common. current evidence suggests fibromyalgia may be a centrally mediated disorder of pain sensitivity... in other words, the nervous system is hypersensitive to stimuli. chronic pain is the result, but other manifestations are sensitivity to light, noise, smells, touch, and temperature.  do what you can to encourage your nervous system to chill out a bit. meditation helps a lot to take the edge off."
Fibromyalgia,3d3epa,Jawzper,3,Mon Jul 13 06:56:19 2015 UTC,Yeah sensory overload is a big part of it for me.

We joke about the superhero thing a lot at our house actually, because husband and I are ""opposites that attract"", which includes his medically induced pain desensitization (long story, but it was because of a medical accident basically). So he's had burns and not even realized it...until I smelled it because I smell EVERYTHING!

Fibromyalgia,3d3epa,lady_skendich,3,Mon Jul 13 12:21:12 2015 UTC,"Heh.. Ive found many gas leaks too, in 34 years. One is even on record at one of the local councils. I sent a letter recommending they have a resident check for a gas leak after being told I was imagining it. They still didnt talk to them and it cost (i estimate) around 15k in man hours and the trees that died after planting. I hate seeing nice trees go to waste, but man that one was satisfying.  Ive told two different friends to check for leaks and they got them fixed. One thanks was a 3 course dinner, the other a nice pub meal :)  If I smell one at random somewhere, ill knock on the nearest door and suggest they or thier neighbors check. A pretty common occurrence. Well, not so much anymore now I dont walk much."
Fibromyalgia,3d3epa,gameinterupted,2,Mon Jul 13 14:28:21 2015 UTC,I'd say that sensory overload is my #1 evidence to myself that  I have fibro and not just spine problems and/or diabetic neuropathies.

So I go with a lighter blanket.  Why a blanket at all you ask? Well, it's cold in here because I am sensitive to heat exaggerated by me not having a thyroid. (Separate unrelated condition)   I hate wearing clothes. I can't stand it when the tv is on for more than a few hours. My family is tired of it and I understand why.   I would get up and move but I am profoundly tired. This makes me unhappy and causes my depression to deepen to near record lows.   I can't read my beloved books to distract me.

My smell is way more sensitive and some particular odours I can't stand/give me headaches. Light can be too much and also causes headaches. Rich foods can make me nauseous. I can't stand loud noises, especially repetitive sounds. And so on. Text book moderate case I guess.   Some things I find helpful:   Wearing soft, light clothes.   Having sunglasses on me at all times.   I'm thinking of getting ear plugs to carry with me too.   Turning the brightness down on my TV.   Staying hydrated/rested/well fed helps all my symptoms including sensory overload. It also helps prevent headaches when the sensory overload sets in."

I try to remember to take a set of ear plugs with me where ever I go and it helps alot.  If someone with bad BO or an old lady covered in talc walks past me in the super market, I struggle not to gag. The recent fad of walk in nail salons with big open doors at the front are a real killer, and a migraine waiting to happen.  The hearing is the worst id say. Its hard to hold a conversation since even the slightest background noises can drown out whoever im trying to listen to. And when i visit my family, even with ear plugs, I am often made sick by the noise my nieces and nephews make, and Ill have to sit in the car or somewhere quiet and calm down. Sometimes I can calm down, or it hurts me too much and it becomes a race to get home before my body wants to shut down."

The TV is on all the time, and it's always super loud, but sometimes even my own ipod in a quiet setting is too much. I also have persistent migranes, and that is an immediate trigger for them as well as other generalized fibro ""fun"".   Tight clothing is also a huge factor, so in an attempt to minimize any pressure I feel on my skin I now wear nothing but flowy soft skirts and ""buttery"" shirts. Same with light... Whoever first thought of the sunglasses thing is brilliant, because it does seem to help a bit.  Does anyone else notice that particular tones or pitches bother them more than others? When certain songs come on the radio I have to turn them off not because I dislike the song but because the particular notes they play just make me want to peel my own skin off...

(Is this right? No. Is this done? Yes.)  I lost my last job to coming in late/leaving early and stress. I'm attempting to go back to work and I posted a while back about trying Nuvigil to stay awake - my psych has written me a prescription but I'm having insurance issues (I had to switch at the beginning of the month and it's a nightmare). Literally, I started going to therapy to deal with my last job. Managing fibro and work is really hard. I've been out of work for a year trying to get things under control.   If you've brought in paperwork and they won't budge, just try talking to them about the new hours. If you do that though, you've got to stick to them (obviously if you have doctor's appointments let them know)."
Fibromyalgia,3d392a,lbsmith5,2,Mon Jul 13 05:12:56 2015 UTC,"I haven't brought in paperwork -- they won't let me? They've made these weird comments about not ""knowing"" what my ""weird"" illnesses are but I have continually asked to bring in notes from doctors etc. They get really mad when I suggest that and say ""this is a family, why are you trying to put everything on paper, we don't DO things that way and you just don't understand how we are."" But then they get really invasive -- like they were timing how long I spent in the bathroom because it was ""excessive"" so I had to tell them I had IBS, which I didn't want to reveal, and they were mad I hadn't told them before. But I could have brought in paperwork or something mentioning needing flexibility with bathroom time and allowing me to bring my phone with me! (They have a strict phone policy, but I need my phone to be able to go, lol...)   Basically they want to me to just TELL them what I have so they can make a decision. They don't want any authorities to be brought in. That doesn't seem right... Even with a company of their size, ADA should apply somewhat, right???   On Friday one of my bosses went on another one of her ""you just don't care about us"" rants so I sent some info on fibro. I was really uncomfortable about it but I felt like it had to be done. I had my period last week so it was really hard for me, and it's like, do I have to tell them that stuff personally now?   Sorry for the rant. I just have no fucking clue. I am so excited to get OUT (whenever that is) and go to some place with HR!!!"
Fibromyalgia,3d392a,elastical_gomez,2,Mon Jul 13 05:46:41 2015 UTC,"I work in the entertainment industry as well. I've been fired because I was given equipment that was busted and I couldn't magically fix it.   Another time, Before I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and was trying to figure out wtf was wrong with me, I got a blood test back with some really scary results that suggested cancer. So I went home early to go cry under the covers. I got a call from my boss who was having a bad day and decided to take it out by laying off the PA who didn't show up to work. Didn't matter that I was very liked by all my coworkers, being trained to take on a larger amount of work AND paid half of what everyone else was. When it was brought up by my superior that I was seriously ill, i was accused of faking it and BANNED from the building.   So yeah, The entertainment industry is fucked, even without having fibromyalgia. Legally they aren't supposed to fire people for disabilities, but they do it all the time. When I got laid off I was convinced I was a failure and had ruined my one shot at a career, but afterwards I learned it's happened to a lot of people and it's really not so bad. Entertainment is one area where you'll find a lot of people have been fired for ridiculous things, and it doesn't really carry such a stigma like it does in most industries. Just keep your head down and stay under the radar as much as you can until you can get out of there.   You will find something else! Even if it's not a job that's directly related to what you want to do, it is so much more rewarding to work alongside people that respect each other. That's the cool thing about entertainment - there's no one direct path to success. People get where they want to be by coming from all sorts of directions.   As far as waking up early goes - I've found that a mild stimulant like Adderall or vyvanse works wonders. The mornings are the most painful part of the day for me, so I make sure I drink a lot of water and I set my alarm at least an hour before I have to get up to take my meds. That way they kick in before I need to be out of bed. I'll take time to read and browse the internet so my mind gets out of the fog a little bit before getting ready. If you really can't get up, try negotiating a different time to come in in the mornings, maybe supplement it with work from home or by staying later in the day.   Managing stress is hard. Especially in this industry where everyone is going gray at 30. There's only so much you can do, but I personally carry around a little notebook with me and make lists of everything I need. It helps me cut through that fog.  Swimming is also another thing that's great for working out your joints and muscles without causing a flare up. I can't do a lot of impact exercise so it really has helped me out. Sitting in a hot tub for a while also helps get rid of all those knots and tight muscles.   I hope that helps, though I'm sorry if I rambled a bit. I feel your pain and I hope you get some relief soon!"
Fibromyalgia,3d392a,sangvine,2,Mon Jul 13 23:58:35 2015 UTC,"I use an app called ""Sleep for Android"" that can tell when you're in a lighter phase of sleep and will sound the alarm then, within a predetermined time period. I think there are a few apps that do the same sort of thing. Honestly I would sleep through my alarm all the time before I got this thing."
Fibromyalgia,3d392a,brummybookworm,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:29:38 2015 UTC,"This seems like a really unhealthy environment for you (or anyone, really).  The stress of that will do a number on your health, especially with Fibro, which is probably part of the whole issue here.  If the option is there, look for other work opportunities.  I understand where you're coming from.  My work isn't the greatest for me health-wise either (jail security).  But I don't have the option to job shop around.  Hopefully, you do.  As far as waking up on time, I try to set an alarm for way early so I can try to get up and moving for awhile before I actually have to get ready.  This means going to bed incredibly early sometimes, but it pays to be able to move around and shake the stiffness before I'm forced to actually function for the day.  As far as horrible bosses, I've been there too.  Just breathe through it.  Don't let them get an emotional reaction from you because that's probably what they want.  Stay strong.  I know it's hard.  To avoid, or help with flares and stress, soak in the tub.  That usually helps soothe my aches.  Bath salts are good.  Stretch.  My doctor recommended this book  I probably don't use it as much as I should, but I've had some success and hear great things about it. A relaxing hobby would benefit you as well.  A lot of people with Fibro knit or crochet to help with the hands.  Find an outlet for that stress and maybe your symptoms will let up some."

I started out walking about 10 minutes. Very painful when I started, but I have increased my distance over almost a year. Over time, I noticed that when I walked in the morning, I slept much, much  better that night. I now can walk 4 miles. The earlier I do it, the better I sleep. Since it has been 100+ during the days, getting up early has been easier to do.   I have tried every sleep med under the sun. None work for more than a couple of days at a time.

I am also diagnosed with CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome) so it may be something other than your Fibro creeping in. A lot of new or worsening symptoms people may pawn off on the fibromyalgia but please get yourself checked out if anything changes. I had a sleep study that was inconclusive and I didn't have the money to go over the results in depth with a sleep specialist though my regular doctor thinks I may have a very mild form of narcolepsy as well. As others have said, mild exercise can help you get a deeper sleep. Also try to change your diet which always helps with fibro either way. Cut down on the electronics before going to sleep as TV, phones, and computers actually keep brain activity up and will have you sleep lighter. Try taking some ibuprofen twice daily too (I'm at 600mg 2x/day). I've found that the anti-inflammatory and mild pain reduction helps immensely. Tumeric golden paste (recipes galore online) is life giving as well. It hasn't really worked for me but have you tried Melatonin or Valerian? Or just some Chamomile and Mint? Also I've found that not sleeping for 8-10hrs straight has given me better sleep. I usually sleep 4-5 hours then I'm up for a couple hours, then another 4-5 hours of sleep."

I'm also waiting to try nuvigil to try and keep me awake during the day but there have been some insurance snafus. Have you tried any medicine for sleep only?

I was sent to physical therapy and the intake doctor told me - all of my joints click fairly often. I thought it was normal. I was diagnosed after a few weeks in because PT was actually making me worse so I went back to my regular doctor.   I know it causes more pain in my experience and led to my diagnosis (at least I think). I have one knee that's really bad and not really related to fibro, I don't think, but it's what got me diagnosed. It's definitely hypermobile - it bends in ways it shouldn't. Was just telling someone in another thread it got me in trouble today when a dog leash (one of those thin retractable ones) got wrapped around it and made it bend a way it shouldn't.   I have insurance, but I switched this month and don't have a card yet - I've never been to an ER, but the pain earlier tonight was having me consider going.   So besides it existing? No clue lol. I have a ton of comorbid stuff with fibro though, and I swear somehow it all has to be connected. I need to be not unemployed and pay for some geneticist to tell me how unlucky my genetic lottery was ... my list is way too long, yet none of it is major, so doctors just want to treat symptoms. I know a lot of people pop up with fibro + rheumatoid arthritis and fibro + chronic migraine as well (I have all 3) ... would love to know those connections."
Fibromyalgia,3d0q9c,lbsmith5,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:02:35 2015 UTC,"I think the study shows that the ACR criteria needs further refinement to distinguish fibro from hypermobility.  Maybe some people with hypermobility also have fibro, but with overlapping symptoms it can be hard to tell."

I'd never even heard of it at the time.  That said, I agree with several of the other comments - this study's population is rather small to be claiming anything significant.  While I certainly think that a link is possible (r/ehlersdanlos recently did a subreddit survey, and several respondents volunteered that they had fibro as well as EDS), I don't know how useful this study is.  Maybe it is meant to simply start the conversation in the medical community?"

Fibromyalgia,3cyosu,FibroMan,3,Sun Jul 12 11:25:58 2015 UTC,"Whilst reading up on cashmere allergy I came across  this.   Summary:   Most wool ""allergies"" are caused by prickling The thicker the fibers in the fabric the more prickling Some styles of fabric make the prickling worse Prickling can cause skin irritation that can become inflamed, imitating an allergic reaction A true wool allergy is less common, and is in response to lanolin (the oil found in wool) Sometimes wool allergies are in response to chemicals used in treating the wool Cashmere has thinner fibers than sheep's wool and is therefore less likely to produce prickling Cashmere produced in western countries come from well fed goats, which grow thier coats faster and therefore thicker and pricklier than Eastern cashmere   I think it is likely that fibro causes increased sensitivity to prickling, especially if you already have sensitive skin.  The ""central sensitization"" from fibro probably makes the prickling feel much worse than normal.  I don't think it has anything to do with the immune system unless it us a true allergy.  It might be best to stick to cotton ;)"
Fibromyalgia,3cyosu,Laur-Ent,2,Sun Jul 12 07:55:38 2015 UTC,"I get the same thing with woolen clothing, the problem is all the little hairs just poking into my skin which is now super sensitive. Even the softest wool blends are irritating. But the softer the blend the more tolerable it is.  Is it just cashmere, or do you find this with all wools? If it's just cashmere, my guess would be an allergy. It can be common to have a compromised immune system after dealing with chronic illness, and with that can come new allergies you've never experienced before."
Fibromyalgia,3cyosu,alieber,2,Sun Jul 12 05:32:23 2015 UTC,"Definitely happens to me sometimes, especially with wool.

It wasn't fibro related though. Fibro has so many different symptoms/levels of severity between symptoms that problems people have from fibro vary a lot from one person to the next. Like I have had fibro pain everywhere I physically exist and it travels randomly, but I don't flare, my pain doesn't stop since my fibro started (except when sleeping and on heavy opiates). I've been in pain continuously for over 1500 days and it would be severe part of the day if I didn't have opiates to dial down the pain volume. I'm jealous of anyone who ever gets a pain free day as that is something I'll never again experience. Not trying to give a  ""sob story"" it is just a part of my life and I accept it. Every now and then people will experience fibro similarly but there are thousands of different fibro experiences. Tell your friends and family not to buy you cashmere though.

Given what I understand about the whole thing, I posit fibro causes ""sensitivity"" which can manifest itself through various bodily reaction pathways, one of which would be the standard ""allergen reaction"". In other words, we seem to be prone to allergies, which alone in a healthy person might just be another allergy, but because they are often many & coupled with other types of sensitivity & reaction (e.g. inflammation) we know it's probably something deeper related to the fibro (currently not well understood enough to know what, if any, causal links are there)."

The only ones that worked for me are the birkenstock brand insoles. They have many sizes and if you go to a store that sells them, they will fit you with the correct size. I have worn mine in everyday for over 10 years and they help support my high arches. There is still pain but they greatly reduce it. I also recommend epsom salt baths or just soaking your feet in a bucket of epsom salts and warm water.

It took me days to find another place to do it that wasn't a hospital, but it ended up being about $500 instead of $30k.

As far as I know, your SNAP benefits will most likely continue even after SSI/SSDI approval, and Medicaid/Medicare will be your insurance if you get accepted by social security anyway.  That said, you may want to hire a lawyer or a legal aid representative, if you haven't already. Lawyers who take SSI/SSDI cases get paid from your back pay, so you won't have to pay them anything upfront. And from everything I've read, you're far more likely to get approved if you have an attorney. Hell, my lawyer was able to get me approved right before my hearing date, so I didn't end up having to go. I'm still waiting for the paperwork to come through (this whole process is just waiting, I swear), so I can't really say yet what it's like once you're approved, but I do know that having someone help me get to this point was invaluable.

The back and neck do tend to be the worst areas though.  Explaining what I can no longer do sounds like an effective way to describe what I'm going through to docs.  The Rheumatologist called me back yesterday and said if things don't improve I should come in to see him sooner than scheduled (I'm scheduled to see him again the first week of August).  I kind of felt like, no shit Sherlock.  He told me to up the gaba pentin and add a muscle relaxer to the regimen.  Which is all well and good, but doesn't tackle the issue of what I am supposed to do with an acute flare up.  I'm calling the Rheumatologist's office today to set up an earlier appointment, because being able to effectively handle an acute flare up is rather important for my quality of life.

Because most family/general practitioner docs don't feel comfortable diagnosing things beyond colds or the flu and send people off to specialists?  That is not on the medical system, that's on the legal system, as things being undiagnosed or misdiagnosed typically end in litigation.  They're covering their butts so they don't lose their practice/business/livelihood.  Yes, the end result is poorer patient care and patients having multiple doctors, but it's not the GPs fault.

Sleeping better seems to be more valuable than being in less pain during the day.  If Lyrica is making you dizzy, groggy and foggy during the day then it doesn't sound like it is working for you.  If the only way it benefits you is through improved sleep then you might be better off taking something specifically for that task, eg amitriptyline or a muscle relaxant.  Amitriptyline makes me sleep more AND be a zombie during the day so I don't take it any more.  I take cetirizine, an over the counter antihistamine, because it gives me the right amount of drowsiness to sleep more at night without being drowsy during the day.  BTW, I missed a night time dose of Lyrica yesterday and I had a nightmare that night, which is rare for me.  I suspect that getting off the lyrica is literally going to be a nightmare."

It is a muscle relaxant, which is great for reducing muscle tension.  I found that it helped me get to sleep more than it made me drowsy, if that makes sense.  If I was busy doing something I would feel alert, but if I stopped and watched TV I would fall asleep on the sofa.

Sometimes it's hard to tell that the people around you still care for you. You want to shoulder all of the responsibility of your health but that's just not possible. And while it seems like that's what everyone around you also wants you to do, it's usually not. Your husband was with you for a time before marriage, just because you are getting particularly worse after the wedding does not mean he's going to suddenly break down now, because he loves you.   I went through those same struggles when I was diagnosed. It was 4 months after I started dating my boyfriend, and while it was extremely hard on both of us at first, he stuck by me and we're still together 4 years later. SO's are there for you, that's like their job. And I don't mean that in an extreme at-your-service way, but a supportive way.

Open up to your husband and let him know how you're currently feeling, I'm certain he will be there for you. Marriage is about both the good times and the bad, no matter the timescale of which they arrive. Talk to a healthcare professional if you feel you just need someone to vent your feelings too, or even PM me. I'll be here for you, hopefully some words coming from someone who understands what you're going through can help. What are some activities that make you happy, or you enjoy? You may not have the desire to partake in them, but it is amazing what accomplishments can do to your mood, no matter how small they will seem.

They can help you with the life changes, how to communicate with your husband, as well as your grief.   Your husband married you knowing you were ill and that there would be bad days. In sickness and in health, right? It's part of the deal. He loves you.   Things are really hard now, but if they confirm MS, they can start to treat it and hopefully things will get easier.  Have you talked to anyone about your anxiety? It's common with some chronic illnesses and your GP can help you get started on a treatment plan, maybe some medication if necessary."

But it got better, a lot better. I'm living a very full and happy life now. Getting ""used"" to certain things, making arrangements here and there, trying to change your perspective and having honest talks with loved ones - these things sound corny, but they really do make all the difference in the world.  You might still be able to work, given the right circumstances. Maybe there is something you could do from home, in the beginning just small amounts of time. Try to find out about possibilites, ask your former colleagues and employers etc.  Try to trust your husband. I don't know what your relationship is like, but remember that you're the person he loves, the person he wants to spend his life with. That's the person he sees when he looks at you, not some sick person that he wants to leave behind. Trust him.  Grab some joy wherever you can. I know it's not easy. But try to keep doing that every day, no matter how small things. Enjoy things you find beautiful and comforting, read books if you like it and can, and if you feel well enough, try to cook something that cheers you and your husband up. The things that you can do will get bigger slowly, and you will feel better again.  You're not alone. We're all here. And you can rant as much as you want, we all want to support you.

You have a full time job dealing with fibro, let alone all the other things.  I know it is hard, but I think you are going to have to let go of the idea that you might be able to go back to work one day.  If your husband decides to leave you it says more about him than you.

I know that when my pain level gets high enough, I experience a great deal of emotional distress too. It gets to a point where I feel like  my soul is being crushed. It's the pain, babe. I know it's scary and you feel alone, but there are so many of us on this forum going through the same thing and taking medication for this horrible condition. You don't have to be scared to take meds for this. A. So many of us do it B. It won't be forever, just until you can build up the strength to handle it without them.   I currently take Tramadol, Lyrica, and Cymbalta and I was diagnosed July 2013. I am currently in the process of tapering off Lyrica, so you can see, it won't be forever. I have been in the dark place you are in, but please please know that there is hope, and it's just the pain messing with your mind. That's what pain does and it sucks, but if you treat the pain, your mental anguish will lift. Please pm me or one of us to let us know you are ok. I hope to hear from you soon."

Fibromyalgia,3cm38y,notjustmum,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:41:19 2015 UTC,"Don't expect too much from a rheumatologist.  There aren't any effective treatments for fibro that a rheumatologist could give you.  All my rheumatologist did was suggest amitriptyline.  Expect to be told that you need to exercise more, although you don't need to have fibro to get that lecture ;)  Hormone imbalances overlap with some of the symptoms of fibro.  Some research points to fibro interfering with the function of the ""HPA axis"".  You wouldn't get a fibro diagnosis without having blood tests done to check whether hormone levels are normal.  If you did have a hormone imbalance then you would probably have some symptoms that cannot be attributed to fibromyalgia.  The best thing you can do for dealing with brain fog is reduce your workload.  It might be best to study part time rather than full time.  My brain fog is worst in new situations, so I suspect that once you are used to the environment at uni you might be able to cope with it better.  My advice is to minimize your workload at first, then increase it when you are able to."

Fibromyalgia,3cm38y,ChockBox,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:58:41 2015 UTC,"I just had my first appointment with a rheumatologist a couple weeks ago.  Here's what mine did:  1:  Blood work.  I had a positive ANA that my GP had done, but it was just a screening, not the full ANA panel.  So the rheumatologist did the full ANA panel.  Still haven't heard back about the results, but I'm guessing they were negative because of the radio silence.  2:  History.  We spent a good 45 minutes going over symptoms, start dates, etc.  I also have PTSD, which the rheumatologist said is sometimes comorbid with fibro.  3:  Full physical exam.  Stripped down to undies, tested all major joints for range of motion, tested trigger points, looked for rashes, etc.  4:  Disappointing.  My rheumatologist said it didn't seem like anything autoimmune related and told me it was likely fibromyalgia.  5:  Starting point for a medicine regime to attempt to control the pain.  Stupid me, I didn't ask what the gameplan was for acute painful flares.  I was having a good week and was so overwhelmed with all the info being thrown at me to remember to ask.  My suggestion is to make a list of everything you want to ask or know about prior to the appointment.  Prior to being sent to the rheumatologist, my GP did a bunch of bloodwork, hormone panels, lyme titer, you name it.  If you haven't had a hormone panel run, specifically mention that and ask the rhematologist to run one.  Hypothalamus and thyroid issues are far easier to manage than other things."

This is more like an exercise induced problem which seems very specific for symptoms.   Although if you have these exact symptoms you should probably chat with your doctor about it.

They hadn't run electricity to it, but that was enough to do.  We paid an electrician to run it properly and I thought we were ready to go.  I filled it up and turned it on to see how long it took to heat up.  A couple hours later, it was almost empty and the back patio was covered in water.  Turns out, it was a hot tub from the 80's and had some massive cracks in the jets.  Because it was so old, you can't really find the jets anymore.  Now I have this power run to a non existent hot tub.  Hopefully we can get it replaced here in the next couple years.  On the bright side, I was able to try out working hot tubs a few times and they worked great!  I couldn't stay in long, as I overheated fairly quickly, but what time I was able to stay in helped my back and legs pretty decently."
Fibromyalgia,3chznq,burritopalace,7,Wed Jul 8 01:37:29 2015 UTC,"Sort of. Different things can contribute to vaginal pain & burning, likewise with the abdominal cramping & sensitivity.   Various medications (and some medical conditions) can affect how well your body is able to lubricate itself (such as comorbid Sjogren's or sicca symptoms), how fragile the skin down there may be (especially if connective tissue disorders haven't been ruled out), and whether or not there are other issues at play complicating things - including stuff like needing pelvic floor physical therapy, having a tipped cervix, vulvodynia, nerve damage, positions that don't quite work for your body, and so on.   GI issues can also cause problems that may cause painful sex. So can anything going on mentally or physically that you may be unaware of, such as not realizing if you are in a position without enough support (pillows may help, or even positions where you take control) or tensing anticipating that he'll hit your cervix again. It wouldn't surprise me if ovarian cysts were causing pains, either.  For the cervix hitting issue, there is an area called the anterior fornix which would be better for him to aim at. (http://www.trustintimacy.com/blog/rocking-the-anterior-fornix)   There is also a lot your partner can do to help you, including using plenty of foreplay, incorporating toys to help work up to that depth/diameter, lots of lube, going for shallower/gentler thrusts, and so on.   Regarding STD testing, you may want to find out what was tested for, as they routinely tend to skip some of the 'less common' ones during annual exams.   Good luck and I hope this helps a little!"
Fibromyalgia,3chznq,R2W,3,Wed Jul 8 02:23:54 2015 UTC,"I deal with a lot of the same things! My hip cramps horrifically during sex, and I've learned this weird way of twisting and wiggling for a second that's very sly so my partner doesn't notice, but it takes the cramp away usually. When you cramp up, try to stretch the muscle. So I guess if it's your abs, try arching your back or crunch forward for a second. That works for me, I'm not sure why.  As for burning: yes definitely. I use lube, it helps BUT, it can't be scented or any of that shit, and it had to be applied before any kind of penetration, otherwise is burns if it's put on halfway through. Make sure you go to the bathroom before (and after) sex.  Hope some of that was useful! Idk the scientific or medical reasons behind any of it, but those are just me experiences."

I've found they tend to know a lot more about this than regular gynecologists, although it's now at least considered a real ""thing"", as opposed to this big mystery. No one knows the cause but it's definitely associated with fibro. I have VVS, I even wrote a long FAQ on it that you can find at http://www.rheumatologynetwork.com/menopause/vulvodynia-and-vulvar-vestibulitis-syndrome-faq-v23. Onset was at same time I got CFS and fibro. I can't have sex, but can control the pain with LMX 4% anesthetic cream (warning: it burns at first but then is soooo great) and Aquaphor. Aquaphor works better than vaseline or orher protective creams because it hydrates the tissue, making it a little thicker and stronger. Some women also find estrogen cream helps."

At that point, I carried heat packs, hand warmers, tylenol, and an illegal prescription of flexeril around just in case because I had gotten so far in self-diagnosis. It wasn't a good situation.   My first GP diagnosed each of my individual problems with bull-shit things like:   Cold? Wear a sweater.  really cold? It's because you're tall and thin. be happy that you're tall and thin.  Migraines? Stop using the computer.  Muscle pain? Try gluten-free. Vomiting? You're probably stressed. Take Tums.  Collapsing? Stop worrying so much about school. Sleep more.    Doctors aren't always helpful. Sometimes they are shitty little shits.

I am a skeptical person and was skeptical about acupuncture but it works for me. I get traditional Chinese acupuncture and my pain went from 7-8 most days (hitting 10 about once a week), from pain in my back/hips/legs to 3-5 most days. I haven't had a 10 in a while! It's been a huge improvement and I can now walk and move more freely, even started yoga which is giving me lots of other positive effects.   Where is the pain exactly? If it's in your muscles you may really benefit from some massage/physio. If you've been less mobile lately your muscles might have lost some strength and are more vulnerable to injury such as sprains. If you're back muscles are currently really tender, that could be a clue.   If the pain is located around your spine and isn't so much in the muscles directly it could be an injury. Either way, if the pain persists or gets worse, get checked out. Early treatment is important for injuries like that so they don't get worse.   As a general rule, if there's a new health problem which is out of the ordinary (higher pain, no relief, no improvement is a red flag) you need to get it checked out. We're just as prone to regular health issues as normal people are. And we tend to ignore it because we're used to being sick/sore anyway. It can be hard for us to tell the difference between our preexisting illnesses and new ones. So you gotta look out for those warning signs."

I don't know if this helped you, I don't intend to worry you.  But the moral of the story is, yes I was on it probably for a good 6 months? maybe a little less? I don't quite remember and I did respond well to it.  However in the end I had to stop taking it and  they still changed my diagnosis from lupus to fibro."
Fibromyalgia,3cazek,starzphalling,2,Mon Jul 6 15:43:07 2015 UTC,"I'm more curious than anything, I've not seen much about its use in fibro patients and my doctor is a bit vague with everything. Personally I'm not that convinced I actually have fibro and haven't been diagnosed, so I wondered if it's used as a diagnostic at all. Sorry to hear about your eyes!  How long did it take for it to kick in?"
Fibromyalgia,3cazek,starzphalling,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:33:58 2015 UTC,"I'm a little hazy on it but I wanna say maybe a week?  Not long at all.  And no need to be sorry, my vision is back to normal, took a little bit, but there was no permanent damage - I knew about the vision side effects prior to taking it and was hyper vigilant about any changes.  I'm not convinced of much from my doctors either lol.  I have not really had great experiences with any yet.  I get a very distinct ""meh"" feeling from a lot of them, except for one that literally told me to ""suck it up, because sometimes life sucks and there is nothing you can do."" .....yeah stopped seeing them reaaaaal quick."
Fibromyalgia,3cazek,zebra-stampede,2,Mon Jul 6 17:24:38 2015 UTC,"Well it took me well over a year to get this referral. It's just been shitty since the start really.  I started seeing doctors when I was roughly 12/13 then they just did nothing. I went to physio, but that was it and it did nothing. My referral to adult hospital never happened and when I had to drop out of uni a few years later I realised I had no medical evidence without a consultant. My GP told me there wasn't anything he could do and I was basically bottom of the list (despite barely functioning) so I kind of gave up. My rheumatology department isn't great either. My first appointment I was asked if I ever suffered from depression, I responded yes and she said ""Well don't we all! It's nothing serious""  Sadly I can't stop seeing them unless I want to go private"

I'd suggest introducing your BF to the idea of communicating this way, perhaps sitting side by side, sharing a computer, typing into the translation pane back and forth, and using spoken words to help as you go along.

One of the hardest things I have ever done. My body now seems to actually reject most opiates and it never did that before.  I could never really take Tramadol. I was given some once and I got horrible tinnitus and double vision so bad I couldn't walk properly.  I wish you luck. I take Celebrex for the fibro pain when I need it. NSAIDs are a lot less nasty to my body."

I would say to you that I personally think you should stick with it. You clearly had reasons for getting off the tramadol, and while you may be in hell right now, once it's out of your system and you're not experiencing any withdrawal, you'll probably be happy you stuck with your decision. Do you take NSAIDs to manage pain at all? I've had people say they help, although I've never personally had any luck with them.  Good luck with your struggle! I too am moving soon and I know how insanely stressful and pain inducing it can be."
Fibromyalgia,3c9kqs,manipulationcreation,2,Mon Jul 6 04:53:38 2015 UTC,"Yes,  I'm on Cymbalta. My pdoc said that it is unhealthy for me to be on Tramodol for so long. I was put on it by a pain doctor for arthritis in my back.  This past weekend has been several kinds of hell for me.  Between the pain, the anniversary of my grandma's birthday and death,  life has been really sucks lately."
Fibromyalgia,3c9kqs,FibroMan,2,Mon Jul 6 22:11:58 2015 UTC,I am currently reducing my Tramadol dose.  So far I have gone from 200mg x 2 to 150mg x 2 to my current dose of 100mg x2 per day.  It has been about 3 months since I started reducing my dose.  It took about 3 days for the pain levels to peak after a dose change for me.  After that the pain levels gradually declined over several weeks.  If you can tolerate your current pain levels then hang in there!  The pain level should slowly decrease.  If you can't cope with the pain then it is okay increase your dose back to prior levels for a while.  Next time you decrease your dose you will know what to expect.  The same applies to the emotional impact.  Over weeks to months you should go back to normal.  If not then you can try other drugs like SSRI's.  I read somewhere that Tramadol has an effect on serotonin in addition to its other effects.
Fibromyalgia,3c9kqs,skeletorsleftlung,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:44:04 2015 UTC,"Ultram is the 100mg time release version of tramadol. Maybe you'd have an easier time if you got some of the regular 50mg pills to take when the pain gets especially bad. It'd probably make it easier for you, though it would likely take longer to get off of them completely."
Fibromyalgia,3c9kqs,manipulationcreation,2,Mon Jul 6 13:53:26 2015 UTC,"Ultram can also, and most commonly is, the 50mg. I work in pharmacy and 98% of the time we fill the 50mg Ultram, so I'm willing to bet that's the one OP is on."

Support her and be a shoulder to cry on, make sure she knows you care and you love her. This isn't an easy time for her and if this is all new she will need some time to adjust. You can encourage her and/or assist her in getting help from a good doctor, preferably one who has experience with treating fibro patients. She may also need some psychological therapy, to help her state of mind. If you want to be more helpful you could do some research on fibro (if you haven't already) and find some things that might help her. If anything, the gesture will prove that you care.   Don't put extra pressure on her if you can help it, and always try to approach these things from a supportive, caring standpoint. I know I personally dislike it when someone is super pushy about me trying certain things (my friend tried to force a gluten free diet onto me even though I'd already tried it years ago, was frustrating). But I can always tell when someone's suggesting something in a kinder, gentler, more understanding standpoint. The latter is definitely preferable :)"

Fibromyalgia,3c8s5n,Ridiculous_Diagnosis,7,Mon Jul 6 01:59:54 2015 UTC,"I've been there. I even took the pills and made the attempt when my husband and I got into an argument and I misunderstood something he said. I thought we were done and I couldn't imagine having to go through it without his support so I felt like the was nothing else keeping me here. (not only was I dealing with the fibro being really bad, but things were so stressful at work that I was having panic attacks. Something that had never happened to me before) I wrote my goodbye letters and took the pills and woke up in the emergency room. My parents were talking to my grandparents and apparently my husband was crying when they got there (this is significant b/c the one and only other time he has cried was one tear when his grandmother died. Except as a baby, of course)  After I got out of the hospital, we talked out our misunderstanding. He told me that he took his vows seriously and was not leaving. We took a vacation to the beach and things got better for a little bit at work until they got worse and he convinced me to quit.   Your friend needs love and support right now but she especially needs a counselor and a better plan for managing her pain. I don't blame her at all. It's hard to live with debilitating pain and to know that you have to live with something half the people you meet, even doctors, don't think is real. Perhaps you could convince her to talk to a therapist about this? Even talking to you would be good if you could convince her that you will listen and not judge. She won't want pity, but I'm sure she could use a sympathetic ear. We always have a mask we hide behind when we're around others b/c others get tired of hearing about how much we hurt all the time. They tell us we can tell them how bad it is but after a while they get annoyed b/c it never changes and there's nothing anyone can do."

Many medications prescribed to help the symptoms of Fibro have some pretty crappy side effects such as behavioral changes, mood changes, sleep changes, and even suicidal ideation. I have personal experience with this and I began feeling like myself after I was weaned off the meds. If she is taking any kind of sleeping pills or lyrica or something similar these drugs have been know to induce behavioral changes."

I train suicide hotline responders IRL, and one fo the hypothetical questions my trainees ask me most often is your type of situation, were you can't relate to the person's problem or situation.  My answer is that you can always relate to the person's emotions - there are only a few basic emotions, and we've all felt all of them. So the essence of being supportive is to distill the situation down to its emotional essence, and identify the feelings - and then relate to those, which everbody always can if they're willing to make the effort."

I can be really irritable and short-tempered and I'm aware of it. But in the moment, I'm not thinking that I'm being irrational and overreacting. I'm just tired and in pain and everything pisses me off. We still have a good marriage, though. Because we both work on being understanding. She knows it's not really me being an asshole, and I know I'm being an asshole. So she's very forgiving and I try to work on being worth forgiving. That's not so easy on the bad days, though. But on good days, when my medications are working and my pain levels aren't too high, we both really enjoy each other's company.   Like any relationship, communication is really important. The big step i had to take to keep this relationship going was realizing that I wasn't helping anyone by not taking my meds regularly. While I was tolerating the pain and was thinking that I was rising above it and trying to protect myself from dependence and addiction, all I was really doing was making my family miserable. Once I started taking my meds on a regular regiment and staying ahead of the pain rather than chasing it, things got a lot better. So basically, it's going to take a lot of understanding and communication on both your parts. Not necessarily going to be easy, but it doesn't have to be that hard."

Fibromyalgia,3c91nn,WhoAreYouWhoAmI,2,Mon Jul 6 04:16:40 2015 UTC,"While this seems more like a relationship issue than a fibromyalgia one I'll still give my two cents.   I know I'm stating the obvious, but communication is key here. Ask what things are overwhelming and frustrating her. Do those things have a realistic fix? Also, talk about how it hurts your feelings when she takes her frustration out on you. Of course it's hard to talk things out when the two of you both feel pretty fucking miserable, but not talking them out is only going to make things worse.   Depression is pretty common with chronic pain. There is somewhat likely chance that she might be struggling with that as well. I know that suggesting therapy is reddit's pet peeve, but therapy is one of the go-to treatments for fibromyalgia for a reason. It's only natural to feel frustrated, overwhelmed and hopeless as a result of chronic pain and fatigue, the reason therapy is suggested is to help with learning how to cope.   As much as I would like for my fibromyalgia not to have an impact on the relationship, it does. All the uncomfortable conversations about it have been necessary. Sometimes it's been him getting on my case to try some different treatment options or be more proactive with managing my depression. Sometimes I've had to remind him that there are things I can't handle during a flareup that I could otherwise handle during good days and it's nothing personal against him.   As for you, make sure you maintain your personal boundaries and take care of yourself. And talk about it. If this is too overwhelming for the two of you, there are couple's counselors out there that could help point you in the right direction."

Fibro can make relationships tough, but it's not the root cause of the problems that are the issue, it's the handling of the issues. If your wife isn't coping with fibro and taking it out on you, then maybe therapy for her is advisable. Good luck with it all."

He takes our son out to play hard in the evenings so I can go to bed early.   Depression can be a big part of fibro, and hypersensitivity. A low dose of zoloft made life bearable for me again and nortryptaline took away chronic pain I had for years. Every marriage is peaks and valleys, and you both always try to work towards the peaks. SHe needs good doctors and therapists who really care about her well being. Fibro is hard to treat. And flare's are like having the worst flu. I started seeing a marriage counselor by myself because my husband won't go, and I just want to be a really good wife despite my disabilities. Watching funny shows together, long drives to somewhere new and fun even if I can barely walk still adds a lot to our lives.

Fibromyalgia,3c9564,Ozzycat,2,Mon Jul 6 16:55:21 2015 UTC,"7-8 years ago before I was diagnosed, but when I first started being treated for chronic pain, my gp prescribed me lyrica and cymbalta. I took it the first night before bed and woke up the next morning not knowing where in the hell I was. I was so ridiculously out of it I had no choice but to call in to work and stay home and sleep it off. I had to stop taking it after that because I literally couldn't afford to miss work. I was recently on lyrica again and it messed with me for a little while, but not that bad. Now I'm taking the cymbalta again and other than the sleep issues it's doing well. I'd say to give it a little while if you can afford to. It may be well worth the adjustment period and if it's able to keep you off of narcotics, then it would make a big difference."
Fibromyalgia,3c9564,lbsmith5,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:34:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. As I stated, I'm very new to all this. My plan was to give it a month. I own my own firm so I set my own hours - can I afford to... ehh...I... ya know, it's borderline. After three days though - I'm almost fully back. Last night I skipped a dose and took this morning instead - and I got a few more moments of sleep. I was awake for at least 3 hours in the middle of the cycle though  Thanks again for the support and taking time to answer"
Fibromyalgia,3c9564,onan,3,Tue Jul 7 13:37:55 2015 UTC,I have been on Cymbalta for 4 weeks. I switched to taking it in the mornings after 2 weeks and am now more alert during the day and not waking every hour once I go to bed
Fibromyalgia,3c9564,lbsmith5,2,Mon Jul 6 21:48:17 2015 UTC,"I'm on gaba and cymbalta as well. I didn't link my insomnia to cymbalta directly, but my insomnia did get worse with my fibro diagnosis. I think that makes since, then. I'm shocked no one has mentioned it to me before.  I've been on cymbalta three years and unfortunately if that is the case for mine (sounds like it might be) - I don't think it does? I was on 60mg, and then up to 120mg, and then back down to 60 again, but didn't see a decrease really."
Fibromyalgia,3c9564,hydrogenbound,2,Mon Jul 6 03:42:35 2015 UTC,I've had on and off problems with insomnia my whole life. But it became very noticeable since I started the cymbalta. I'll sleep for 3-4 hours and then wake up and be completely unable to get back to sleep. Then end up having to nap for a few hours in the afternoon or evening. Going to switch to taking it in the morning and see if that helps.
Fibromyalgia,3c7qs5,rossocorsa,13,Sun Jul 5 18:07:12 2015 UTC,"Yes. If only because it could not be fibro, as well. You need to make sure that you don't have a different condition that requires different treatment. And if you're trying to get pregnant that's important to know, 1) for your own health, and 2) for the health of the child. Some of the differential diagnoses for fibro are genetically inherited diseases."
Fibromyalgia,3c7qs5,zebra-stampede,6,Sun Jul 5 18:32:50 2015 UTC,"100% correct. Also, not a bad idea to talk to a doctor about all of your herbal treatments just in case something is wonky for preggers ladies (of course I'm not your mother or anything). I go over my herbal supplements and treatments with my pain specialist and she is very supportive as long as I'm using something safe. Typically the [good] doctors want you on the least amount of medications as possible, because when it gets to the point that a person needs that medication, that person won't have a tolerance and it will work better.  Edit: Obvs doesn't apply to medications which require tapering etc. More so breakthrough pain meds, which are the ones I want to mininize the need for them."
Fibromyalgia,3c7qs5,xsunxspotsx,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:19:29 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I've even had PCPs, the rheumatologist, and the neurologist all recommend herbal remedies to me. Natural medicine is starting to get a lot more recognition from doctors that it has traditionally enjoyed."

Or hypothyroidism, which is often treatable with synthetic hormones.)  Also, I used my diagnosis to get fmla at a past job that just took too much out of me but I couldn't afford to quit. I actually wasnt on any treatment at the time."
Fibromyalgia,3c7qs5,surrogateuterus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:48:42 2015 UTC,"I have Myelitis (it is in the MS family) and it also causes pain similar to fibro, so I received a fibro diagnosis years after I should have."
Fibromyalgia,3c7qs5,xsunxspotsx,2,Sun Jul 5 20:24:09 2015 UTC,"I would definitely look into it... I struggled for years before I knew for sure. Having the official diagnosis has made managing it easier for me. Another thing to keep in mind... It could be something else like MS, so it's good to rule them out. Also, fibro symptoms can change with time, and what works now may not always. There may be a time when you need to look to other ways to treat symptoms, and that diagnosis can give you more access. Also, should you get in the position at work to need intermittent FMLA, fibro is a valid reason. Sure, you don't get paid for FMLA, but it's nice to be able to keep your job if you get sick. I would definitely do it... It might help you later. Hopefully, supplements work and you'll never have to go big pharma! Hopefully! But what if there is some rad medical breakthrough for fibro? One can hope, right?"
Fibromyalgia,3c7qs5,auntiechrist23,2,Sun Jul 5 19:44:09 2015 UTC,"If you are having the symptoms of Fibro, you definitely want to see a doctor. I did and they did a bunch of tests and concluded that I have POTS and mild seep apnea. I may still have fibro, but we won't know until the other two are treated. My B12 and D vitamins were also super low. I have an almost-two-year-old and it is a lot of work with these symptoms and pregnancy was difficult, so for your sake, and your future baby's, talk to a doctor and make sure you are good to go!  In general, it is a really good idea to get a physical and women's exam before trying to conceive to make sure everything is all right with your body.  Good luck!"

So in that sense, it's been a looooooooong flare.  Within individual days I often cycle fairly fast between being flat on my back and being able to sit up and watch movies, hold a basic conversation, or do simple tasks (read reddit!)   These up and down cycles can be anywhere from 10 minutes each direction (really confusing to the people around me, OK! not OK. OK! not OK.) to several days. Granted, even on my upswing, I'm still in what many people would consider a flare.   I think it's really personal, and has a lot to do with your individual body, your energy management, the life that goes on around you and a million other things.   I wouldn't beat yourself up for having rough weeks. Just ride it out and remember that it does get better. When you are feeling better, you can work slowly towards minimizing the next downswing.

Sometimes cooking is all I have energy for in a day, but it's so rewarding to have made good food. On good days, I'll drive to the mall close by and push my son in his stroller. Walking behind a stroller in the a/c is a lot nicer than walking aimlessly with a cane.  As far as where to find good recipes, I use the recipes on beyonddiet although I'm not a member. I've dropped meat mostly as well, but not intentionally. It just kinda happened lol. Having lost the weight makes getting around a little bit easier, but I haven't had a reduction in overall pain or a better memory.  IBS symptoms get worse when I cheat on my diet but are otherwise the same as well. The biggest benefit of losing weight is how good my wife tells me I look! Lol"
Fibromyalgia,3c0p8d,GMU_TheHulk,4,Fri Jul 3 18:56:21 2015 UTC,"Hi, former personal trainer turned fibromite here.   If you haven't already, /r/keto.  Ketogenic diets are notorious for improving perceived brain fog.   There's evidence of it working to improve brain function in people with things like autism.   I know when I was on keto my brain was much clearer but my stomach could no longer handle it and neither could my wallet so I had to stop.    Exercise as you can.   Be extremely careful lifting weights if you do, proper form becomes doubly important for us as its extremely easy to move incorrectly under load and tweak something.   Have someone you trust lead you through basic bodyweight exercise to start if you go this way, or if you have to find a decent gym with a free consultation.   If you can afford it hire a real trainer who understands fibro.   As for cardio, it's really dependant on what you can tolerate and get into.  Walking and swimming are two excellent low impact, high reward activities.   I personally walk like it's my job as I need it, my depression needs it, my dogs need it and I find it extremely therapeutic.   I find listening to comedy podcasts and ensuring I have my portable cannabis vaporizer with me for peak pain has helped me increase my fitness level.   It takes time and commitment and is well worth it.  I started out at under 300m/day 5 years ago, and I'd come home crying.   I kept pushing myself like crazy on days I felt OK enough to do so and started to stretch my distances.   I try to average 5km/day right now and usually split it between two walks.   In the last couple months my walks where I push myself have gotten to 10.5km.  Of course, once I stop moving my body goes berserk and I seize up but it feels nice to be out.   I don't drive anymore so this is one of my main ways to satisfy making scenery go past.   Does it hurt?  Yes.   So does laying down.   So does being awake.   So does everything.     We live in an economy of pain, it's our currency and is what we truly pay every debt with.   I'd rather be throwing my pain at things worth being in pain for than just 4 walls and a comfy chair.    Good on you for looking for options. ☺"

THC does play a role in pain relief but CBD is what balances it all out.  The good news is that the ""high"" from cannabis peters out after a few months of the same same dosage but the pain killing effects remain the same.   Taking cannabis daily is the only medication that has allowed me to move around as I do.  And not 10k a day, those are peak days that I hit maybe every 3 weeks or so.   But I average 5km a day.    And if you continue to slump in weight loss fire me a message and I'd be happy to peek at your diet and routine to see if there are any tweaks that need to be made.  Keto can get interesting in that you can actually get away with a little more food sometimes.   I did a cyclical keto diet that I favored.   One day a week of cheating, and 6 days of strict keto.   Allows one to get the cravings out and account for social things centered around food, but not for long enough that you come out of ketosis.  Are you measuring ketone levels at all?  If not, get some strips and use them every day to ensure you're on point with the diet.  Once you are reduce the frequency of checking and do it at least once a week.

And it takes a truly surprising small amount to get the job done.   I've been very impressed with it.   I get it in an oral syringe from the dispensary I favor.  If she finds cannabis works for her look into getting her a portable vaporizer.   It's a life changer.   I was at a large open air event last night with lots of smells and noise and started to get a migraine.   I was able to pull my vape out and mitigate my symptoms while sitting there with with my wife and her friend.   They were sitting next to me and didn't notice I was vaping until a few minutes in.

It has improved my life so much. It's most likely not all in your head that it really helps. I don't have insomnia anymore and I get restful sleep. And like you, I lost 15 pounds in the first 2 months but also put on 5 lbs or so of muscle (over  slightly longer period of time though).   Weight lifting helps weight loss because it increases your metabolism. So it will burn the fat while you're hanging out, essentially. You may not notice a difference on the scale but you will in your clothes. It also can be as low-impact as you need it to be. You set your own pace, your own reps and weight.   Also, being sore from weight lifting masks the random muscular pain of fibro that I get. It's been addicting actually, having pain that 1) I know where it comes from 2) I know it'll pass in a day or two and 3) it's productive.

I used to ride horses a lot and when you go over the jump but not the horse, believe me, you feel it the next day.

If i remember correctly, you don't have to have ALL 18 pressure points, but I believe its either 10 or 12 out of the 18, but yes its a valid diagnostic tool. My doctor however didn't tell me what he was going to be doing or that it would be unpleasant before he did it, so it caught me off guard, which I think is the intention. Theres a certain amount of pressure/force each point should be exerted with for diagnosis, but its not supposed to be pleasant. I remember him doing my sternum, collar bones, shoulders and knee caps in rapid succession and I was quite literally jumping off the table with each one. I was 19, so this was almost 6 years ago.

Forever is a big commitment, and pretty big news to break to someone.  Of course I say that now after having the peace of a proper diagnosis and years of learning to cope.

Many doctors use this data along with symptoms to diagnose fibro (and migraines/depression/IBS are all common symptoms!) Anyway, it hurt a TON when my doctor did it on me. She gave me no warning, however. Just jabbed her thumb in various places."
Fibromyalgia,3bybqa,a_crisp_fall_day,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:08:32 2015 UTC,"This was the same for me. My doctor gave me no warning and did not even mention fibro (so there was no ""placebo effect"" or whatever you'd call it) I just yelped out over ten times and that was the final part of my diagnosis that I did not know she was making."
Fibromyalgia,3bybqa,burritopalace,3,Wed Jul 8 02:07:13 2015 UTC,"That exam is pretty standard, actually. One of the diagnostic criteria for the condition is the tender points, and poking them is really the only way to discern if they're tender or not. My old neuro also chose some of those points to do a nerve conduction test, where they jab needles into the muscle and send electric pulses to assess nerve damage. I still don't know if he had to choose those particular areas but if not he's a sadist masquerading as a doctor."
Fibromyalgia,3bybqa,jlmitch12,5,Fri Jul 3 06:38:56 2015 UTC,"It's the only diagnostic test, actually. And yes, if you actually have fibro, it's very fucking painful. Omg I almost fell over and I actually cried during mine."
Fibromyalgia,3bybqa,whenifeellikeit,4,Fri Jul 3 07:57:02 2015 UTC,"It's not the only one actually.  There is a blood test and they found that regular fibro patients have an increased amount of blood stints in hands.  The stints serve the nerves in the skin and a biopsy can be done to see them.  There is also small fiber fibromyalgia that can be diagnosed with a skin biopsy of the pain affected region of the body.  The blood test is still a bit expensive last I heard.  I'm not sure on the hand biopsy.  The small fiber biopsy is doable.  I've had 2 done, and they take about 3 weeks to get back as the biopsied sample is examined by a lab in New York somewhere.  I've only had the poke test done on me once, after I had already received a diagnosis through the biopsy (performed on my low body.)  I only reacted to two of the spots."

I keep wanting to ask her if she's looking to see if the fibro has gone away or what! I leave so sore everytime since pressure to the skin is one of my worst side effects. Oh well, such is life for us fibromites"
Fibromyalgia,3bybqa,manipulationcreation,2,Fri Jul 3 05:23:52 2015 UTC,"Yup, a lot of rheumatological tests are just about poking people where it hurts and observing the reactions of the tissues and client.  I was diagnosed by my GP without the trigger point test because I described tenderness in the trigger points and that was enough for her, But when I saw the rheumatologist he insisted on poking me in all 18 locations, I was actualy in remission at the time because it took 6 months to see him, it was the middle of summer and I was feeing pretty great, he asked how I felt about the poking and proding and I said ""It's uncomfortable, but not nearly as painful as it's been in the past""  he decided that because it wasn't painful right now, I don't have fibromyalgia, and sent me back to the neurologist for further MS screening.  It took 4 months to get into the nuro, so by that time I was flaring again, He saw no need to re-do the MRI as no new symptoms had sprung up, so he poked me in 10 places, called my rheumatologist an idiot and sent me back into my GP's care with Fibromyalgia as my official diagnoses."
Fibromyalgia,3bybqa,mundabit,2,Fri Jul 3 08:26:25 2015 UTC,"I got diagnosed with fibro and not one doctor has performed the pressure point test. I have asked every single doctor. They all say it's pointless and won't do it.   I have tried to look up what the points are so I can administer the test myself.

Fibromyalgia,3bybqa,Arose21,2,Fri Jul 3 13:33:03 2015 UTC,"I never had that test, they instead did the 'rule out' where they tested me for everything else and then by default only had fibro left.

Fibromyalgia,3bybqa,waggytalk,2,Fri Jul 3 19:01:28 2015 UTC,"My rheumatologist prodded me in a few places that were a bit sore, but not that bad.  I was on Lyrica already, so the rheumatologist figured that the Lyrica was working, and he didn't think the tender point test was all that important anyway.  The tender point test was developed for the purposes of research, not for the purpose of diagnosing fibro in practice.  It has the advantage of being objectively verifiable, which can help produce more reliable data.  It was not intended that someone with 10 tender points would be excluded from a fibro diagnosis.  A history of chronic pain in all 4 quadrants of the body is sufficient."
Fibromyalgia,3bybqa,FibroMan,2,Sat Jul 4 03:18:02 2015 UTC,"Same thing here. After the doctor was finished doing the pressure points test,  I felt like I'd been at the losing end of a fight with Mike Tyson."

He didn't warn me what he was going to do before he started, talking to him afterwards it's because he's had people fake a reaction because they want to have fibro!!!  As he had to scrape me off the ceiling after poking each pressure point he was totally confident I do have it."
Fibromyalgia,3bybqa,dravenxiv,0,Fri Jul 3 08:24:22 2015 UTC,"That's the standard diagnostic test for fibro at the moment. There isn't a known cause, so diagnosis is based on   process of elimination; making sure it isn't something else application of pressure to a set of known fibromyalgia tender points checking if the patient has at least a few comorbid symptoms   It's pretty much a ""we can't find anything else wrong with you so we're labelling it fibromyalgia for lack of any other ideas"" situation."
Fibromyalgia,3bu8si,Picturerazzi,8,Thu Jul 2 04:59:00 2015 UTC,"I have been that girl, a few times.   If you're not bleeding to death, basically, they will ignore you. I've had it so bad that even after a an IV cocktail of meds I was still crying in pain.  It did not matter which way I moved or laid down, nothing took the pain away.  This was the first time I felt ""the hug"" and had no idea what was happening.  I honestly prayed for death.  From the other side of the coin.. I worked in the medical field for a while and I can tell you a few things:   It depends on her insurance/pay type.  If she is on public assistance or a shitty carrier, they will do the minimum needed to get her in and out because ""medicaid doesn't pay for MRIs"" etc. Sad but true, and I'm a full time student now on public health and I believe it's actually worse than having no insurance (maybe because of where I live though). A lot of people abuse the medical system to get heavy meds, and it's created a desensitization to people who really really need them.  She may actually be a ""frequent flyer"" at the ER, or she could have been legitimately in need, you really don't know.  People that are drug abusers will go to great lengths to catch the next high and are really, really good at tricking you. Pressures from the DEA and pharma and so on... are keeping Drs from pushing heavy meds on people even when they need it. It's absolutely ridiculous, as pain management should be always at the top of the to-do list. But as a physician, if you get caught up in a ""shoppers"" (drug/Dr shopper) investigation, it's bad news. In some places, like where I live, the ER is life or death only. Now, I grew up in Vegas.... if you went to the ER and they run a few tests and see that you subsequently have a UTI, or like kidney stones or something that is unrelated to your entry DX, they will tell you about it, and sometimes start treatment if it's quick/easy/needed; then tell you to follow up with GP.  Some places will only treat what you came in for; and only if it is deemed ""urgent"". Here on Guam, if you come in with severe pain, and say you have fibro or something... they will basically dismiss you without treatment and send you home because there's ""nothing they can do"".  Also, upon entry, if you pop positive for an infection or something like the aforementioned, they will not even bother to bring it up.  You must request for your reports at checkout and figure it out on your own. It basically comes down to the funding/practice and demographics of the region.   I know this is terribly depressing.  Hopefully the girl recovered quickly and is no longer in pain.  I know we've all felt that helpless pain before."

And it's not because they don't want to help her, but she could have been a frequent flyer. So they knew her tactics. Or they asked her what was wrong, she told them, she didn't get her way, and she figured throwing a tantrum was the best option. So it could be any number of reasons. Hospitals have to go by severity, and if it wasn't severe, then it could wait a bit. I actually had to take my son to the ER when he was little, on a holiday weekend, and they were so packed, there was a girl, maybe about 20, with a bloody bandage around her forehead, sitting in a wheelchair, having to wait to see a dr. So unless you are having a stroke, heart attack, major bleeding, loss of limb, etc, you are put on the low priority, which sucks. Riding in an ambulance will get you in quicker, but even then they will sometimes put you in the waiting room if it's too busy and your issue isn't of great importance. The hospital I worked at, people would take an ambulance from the south of town to the north of town, just bc they needed a ride. And then would sign out AMA, and go about their merry little way. ER's are a messed up place for sure."

I just was so traumatized that I even missed my name being called for my lab work.  What I don't understand was that there were huge comfortable recliner chairs in the lesser triage area available for her and she refused. I wanted to tell her so badly that the chairs were much better than the uncomfortable wheelchair she came in.  She said her back was in spasms and I heard something about a disk but I was trying not to listen. I had my earbuds on with relaxing music. I came prepared because I knew that I wasn't priority whatsoever.   Does that help /u/mimsy34? Do you think that the medical staff appreciate compliant easy patients? I never ask when I'm going to be seen. If it's because of pain I just cry silently. I was just wondering if it goes into my medical records that I'm a good patient.
Fibromyalgia,3bu8si,sunstorm77,2,Thu Jul 2 12:23:31 2015 UTC,"Most places will make notes, about a patient, and if they were taking their mess and overall cooperating. And they definitely can see your history and what you have been in for. My husband has had multiple heart attacks, so we go in usually about once a year. They made him sit in the waiting room for over 30 mins, until the triage nurse talked to him and saw his past medical history. Then it was right to a room, chest X-ray, lab work etc. but he had walked in. Most people don't have the capacity to walk in when having such issues, they are in an ambulance. The front desk is really just there to check them in, and 90% of the time have no medical training, and are just doing what they are supposed to. It sucks though having to listen to it and see people acting like that. Your first instinct is to help but depending on the situation depends on if the person will actually listen. I'm sorry you had to endure that. It doesn't make an ER visit very pleasant for sure."
Fibromyalgia,3bu8si,sunstorm77,2,Fri Jul 3 03:45:23 2015 UTC,"My best friend went through a similar experience, only it was six hours and she was the only screaming. She has gastroparesis (though we didn't know that at the time), which causes serious abdominal pain. After waiting for six hours, crying, screaming, moaning, groaning and being completely incapable of even holding herself upright in a chair, she managed to corner a nurse and asked her if she was going to be seen any time soon. No one had done anything more than take her temperature in six hours, and that was six hours ago; otherwise, she'd been pretty much ignored. The nurse's response was ""You just have abdominal pain, people with actual emergencies need to go first."" So my friend grabbed the wall and stood up and told them she'd go to another hospital where agonizing abdominal pain is taken seriously and literally dragged herself out of the hospital. Nobody tried to stop her, but when she showed up at a different hospital an hour later, they did not waste time getting her checked in. They ended up keeping her for three days. The most ridiculous thing? The two hospitals are directly related and the second one ended up referring her back to doctors at the first one."

It's sad that some people ruin pain treatment and empathy for the rest of us.   I sincerely hope that she is not in agony as much. I hope for a cure for gastroparesis. Does she have a button?
Fibromyalgia,3bu8si,GalacticMirror,2,Thu Jul 2 12:13:47 2015 UTC,"No button, she hasn't quite gotten there yet and honestly, I don't think she'll let herself. I think when they tell her it's time for the button, she's going to kill herself because at that point, aside from losing the ability to dance and spin fire and go for a hike, she would have lost food, too, and I think that's just too much for her. As far as the hospital goes, though, I was in shock that the ER nurse would say ""It's just abdominal pain."" There are so many things that abdominal pain could be that could have killed her in the 6hrs she spent waiting. I hate that hospital now."

I am often sent home if there's nothing they can do after  thorough pathology and radiology testing , but I am never hurried out the door. I can be in the acute ward for 4-5 hours sometimes.  I think some of the politeness may be because I have an allergic reaction to morphine, and only accept the synthetic stuff if they insist I am in too much pain (it messes with how I regulate body temperature somehow), so the main reason I go to hospital is to make sure I am not having organ inflammation."

Also, see if you can get a crockpot - a single one is great, or if you only have a big one, you can stretch a few ingredients into food for the week by freezing & refrigerating.   I have days where the pain is bad and I can't get out of bed either. On the days you can get out, even walking around the house to get your muscles and joints moving is a start. As I said in another thread, I can't exercise besides that and light stretching in areas, so if you start with that, you can start to build to more.   Don't listen to people when they yell at you.

I was a very overweight teenager, then in my early 20's I managed to lose 80 pounds through proper diet and exercise. For a few years it was great  Then, I started getting sick and hurt all the time. Goodbye daily 5 mile walks with my dog, hello sedentary lifestyle, med side effects, and eating for comfort. I'very ballooned from 120 to 250 pounds. I feel planetary, and when my cats come to me I can't decide if they truly want my affection or if they've gotten sucked into my gravitational pull. (Humor is my coping method, in case you couldn'the tell). I can share a few tips that helped me lose weight the first time around.  Number one: start a food journal. It was the most useful method of all. Track everything you eat. When you become cognizant of how much you're actually eating, you eat less. They have all sorts of neat apps now.  Another good one: it takes your brain roughly 20 minutes to recognize that your stomach is full. So take about half of what you think you want and wait 20 minutes. A lot of the time I didn't want the other half after all.  A weird but useful one: use color psychology to your advantage. Red stimulates appetite, so avoid it. Blue is the least appetite stimulating color. So I used blue dishes. Last one: give yourself a cheat day once a week where you eat what you want and don't track it if you don't want to. I wish you success. Cheers!"

Making healthy food can also be hard because energy levels are so low, so it's a vicious cycle.  I managed to get into shape a year or so ago and felt amazing.  It was during a long holiday so I had recovery time after every exercise session.  I couldn't keep it up though because the weather got cooler and the pain and fatigue increased too much.  I'm thinking that we are being way too hard on ourselves.  Losing weight is awesome, but what we have to go through to achieve that is just not practicable most times.

This online calculator says I'll lose the weight by a pound a day! But wait, I'm eating 1000 calories worth of jolly ranchers and nothing else. That amount of sugar creates a huge load of insulin to drop into your system. Insulin causes sugar to store itself as fat for long term energy storage.

I started logging what I ate, how much I drank, how and where I hurt and then when it happened my activities. I set timers for moving because even 5 minutes of stretching does hurt at first but after the first few times it's such a relief. I went crazy logging things because I'm breastfeeding and needed to keep up with that stuff but it helped me see that my diet did affect how I felt. So I changed my diet a little to what works for me. Personally, it's not a diet to lose weight, it's an eating change to not hurt.  I still eat junk but not as often because it's not worth it. But anyways, point is I think just keeping a calorie deficit should kickstart a loss. The keto diet is probably my ideal diet because I lost weight and the weight I lost stayed off but I couldn't maintain breastfeeding with the weight loss even eating 2000 calories a day(usually I do 1500) so it might be worth a look at for you!  Feel free to message me if you have any questions or need an accountability buddy."
Fibromyalgia,3bq1ps,XD__,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:05:23 2015 UTC,"The keto diets (low carb Atkins style) are massively helpful for me.  I was VERY anti them for years, until I tried it.  There's very little 'cooking' involved (breakfast this morning was a packet of cheese slices!), and after three days your appetite disappears so there's no issue with cravings.  It also doesn't rely on exercise, so you can doing need much energy to the follow the plans.  When I'm in ketosis my fog does disappear a bit, I'm a little more 'with it' and able.  But, with keto diets you have to do them 100%. You can't 'cheat'. A slip will set you right back to the beginning, so it's a big commitment."
Fibromyalgia,3bq1ps,GatewaytoGhenna,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:02:10 2015 UTC,"Keto helped me lose the weight I gained on cymbalta. I lost 15 pounds in 2 months and gained 5 of muscle which is neat. It's a tentative suggestion because it's difficult with will power but it also meant I was fuller for longer. You essentially train your body to burn fat for energy instead of carbs. Fat takes longer to burn so you're sated longer. I definitely noticed it wasn't just keto fans being biased. It might be a useless suggestion because of the SSI but I spend about 40$ a week on food while still losing weight.   And besides that, /r/loseit is great too :)"

Carbohydrates are turned into fat the quickest unless expended, so for people who are more sedentary cutting carbohydrates to the essentials is important. Some of my favorite bowls are (black beans, brocolli, white cheese, sourcream) (lettuce, tomato, salsa, black beans, corn, red onion, sour cream, avocado) (arugala and fried eggs) (baked veg with seeds and vinagrette) (hard boiled egg salad no yolks, avocado, tomato, paprika, liquid aminos, seeds, spinach) (greek yogurt, frozen berries, stevia) ... occasionally when i crave comfort food i'll bake a potato and prepare with brocolli, cheese, butter, sour cream, and a diet coke."

This is my soapbox so I am going to give you my speech. You can lose weight. Weight loss is a simple equation. You have to put less energy into your body than you expend. if you put in more energy you store it as fat.   First know this. Eating for weight loss and eating for health are two different things. They have no bearing on each other. As someone with fibro we should do both, its just better for us. But don't confuse having to eat fantastic food all the time with being able to lose weight. You just need a calorie deficit. You don't even have to move. Bed bound super obese people lose weight. Exercise is for health not for weight loss, despite what bullcrap shows like The Biggest Loser show us. Yes, you burn some calories exercising but never enough to offset food intake. Especially people with fibro who are usually limited in what they can do.   You need to find out your TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) to know how many calories you should be eating. Here is an OK calculator: http://iifym.com/tdee-calculator/ You need to start tracking your calories. A 500 calorie deficit will give you a pretty steady weight loss without usually making you feel deprived. A great site to track calories is MyFitnessPal. I guarantee if you don't track you will eat to much.   Don't obsess about what you eat all of the time. Just track how much you eat. Don't let people get you caught up in macros or ratios or anything. Just track how much you eat.  If you have questions or want help or need any information just post here or message me. I am happy to help you, or anyone with getting started.   Your pain will not disappear of course, I know you know this. But you will feel better. You can separate out fibro pain from obesity pain."
Fibromyalgia,3bq1ps,peanutgallerie,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:07:08 2015 UTC,You can lose weight while fibromite. You can.   More than half of weight loss is food control. Just keep at working on ways to reduce  your food intake. One thing I did last year was to give up breakfast. I realized I really wasn't hungry when I woke up and was eating out of convention. Plus all the breakfast food I really like  is so sugary. Fasting is good for your body. I'd eat if I truly felt hungry but only a small portion to sate myself. I drink coffee with cream. Next I reduced my lunch portion to just a small meal. Dinner time is whatever I want and pretty big. No snacks unless I'm dying for something. I lost 30 lbs in a year without doing much else. It helped make my food decisions less decisiony too. I also stopped diet drinks. They do stuff to my metabolism. I saw a 10 lb drop almost 4 mo after I did that.  Felt better and less moody too.   Look for fibrous food when you eat out on the cheap. It helps bind and flush fatty food you eat. I get the premium chili mcwrap from McDonald's  Bc it is loaded with veggies. Delicious too.  Bookend your food with veggies and fiber filled things. It really helps.

Fibromyalgia,3bmnl4,ChippHop,4,Tue Jun 30 13:24:43 2015 UTC,"Does she eat healthily? That can make a big difference.  In regards to exercise, yes it helps a lot but getting started is hard. Try and have her just walk a little at first, even if it's just around the house. Water exercises are also apparently awesome for fibro and very therapeutic. It's just a matter of building up the endurance over time and it will eventually help, even though in the beginning it's really hard."
Fibromyalgia,3bmnl4,manipulationcreation,3,Tue Jun 30 15:04:06 2015 UTC,"I mean, not all of us can exercise with fibro. I can't because exercise is a trigger for my migraines and I have a bum knee. I do walk around the house and do stretching but I don't know if I would consider it exercise. I have to save my energy for things like showering, going to doctors visits, going to shop for food, etc. If she does that though, it will get her moving and allow her to get out of bed to still do things. One day she might be able to work up to more, she might not like me.  Is Savella or gabapentin available in the UK? I've had a lot of luck with gaba and want to switch to savella. Those are some that help for fibro but aren't the big ones like Lyrica and Cymbalta.   I mean, if all people are suggesting is exercise, she needs to ignore them (if personal) or find someone else to help (if professional/doctors/etc). There are other treatments out there. I'm not at 100% but I'm getting through the day. Did any of the antidepressants help her not be depressed? If she's given up on life as you've said, that would at least help perk her up a bit. I'm on a separate antidepressant for the chronic illness related depression I have. Did she try combinations of medications? One did not work for me completely, I had to be on a combo of meds for things to work (Cymbalta and Lyrica, then Cymbalta and Gaba, and for a while Tramadol on top of all of that and still and antidepressant on top of all of that).  Another thing that helps me is I have a massage chair at home (secondhand, you may be able to find one secondhand as well) and get massages regularly with a massage therapist that is familiar with chronic pain (his girlfriend actually has fibro). When I leave, my muscles feel great, even if the effect only lasts a few days.  I hope your mom finds something to help!"
Fibromyalgia,3bmnl4,lbsmith5,2,Wed Jul 1 03:37:24 2015 UTC,"As a Mom I just want to say how wonderful it is you care so much about her. I would be touched if my kiddo posted to Reddit to help find out answers for me.   Make sure she has gone in for blood work. Have her vitamin D, calcium, B12 checked. Do the whole panel if you can to make sure nothing else is going on. I was also able to go to a naturopath and get a hair analysis that showed other things like magnesium and other vital vitamins and minerals that do not always come up in blood tests. If you don't have one in your area you can usually do it via mail order. I am always evangelizing to everyone with fibro to take the 4 bone/joint health supplements. Calcium, magnesium, vitamin D and boron. Check with the doctor and get approval of course.   Have her start out slow. Slower than you would imagine would do any good. Walk to the end of the driveway and back every day. Stretch every day. Maybe a gentle yoga class. Pool exercises are nice. What does she enjoy? Make something out of that.   And on top of everything else her mood is important. Depression, despair and the lack of will can zap any strength from people with any condition. If the family can help her out with things to cheer her up. Make her feel special and valuable. Do things with her. (I love it when my kids want to do things with me)  Good luck, let her know she is not alone. She can improve. We are all behind her!"

Aquatic physical therapy had helped me so much. It helps joints, is insanely low impact and then if it's a rehab facility then you get to make friends with other pains so it's kinda like a support group. Also, are there any behavioral therapists around her? Talking to someone who will listen when the pain is unbearable but you don't want to be a broken record to friends and family who probably don't even understand what you are going through can be more beneficial than medication. Makes you feel less trapped inside your own body."

You're screwed for the next day if you overdo it, but you'll make yourself worse if you don't move through a bad flare. There are days when walking is all I can do, but I look at it as at least I'm doing something. Is kratom a legal option in the UK? It might be worth a try if nothing else has worked. As an herbal remedy, I find that it helps with the pain, fatigue, and depression aspects of fibro fairly well."
Fibromyalgia,3bmnl4,auntiechrist23,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:58:10 2015 UTC,"this is my advice for your mother...  here's the thing: too much activity causes the condition to flare up. a flare up causes the person to be exhausted and sore for several days, so they don't want to do anything. a prolonged period of inactivity follows. prolonged inactivity causes the muscles to weaken, and pain to increase. by the time the flare up is over, any benefit the person may have gained from the exercise they did has disappeared due to the inactivity, and their condition has probably worsened overall as well.  the solution isn't exercise. don't overexert. the solution isn't to not do exercise, either. don't stagnate.   it's all about finding a balance. break up long periods on inactivity by doing some activity. every hour, do something simple to move the body a bit. get up, go make some tea, stretch your limbs. similarly, break up long periods of activity with rest as necessary. for example, if you go for a walk around the block, stop halfway, rest for five minutes, and then continue. eventually, it will become easier and you can do more.  finding the limits of the individual is important; be aware of what is doable without causing a flare up, and make a point of doing that as regularly as you can. maybe walking around the block is too much for now, you can just walk up and down the street instead. even just standing and moving the limbs around will help if that's your limit for now.   exercise can take many forms, do what you can do without causing a flare up. my big point here is that you're better off doing light exercise that won't exhaust you, several times in the week, rather than doing strenuous exercise once, and not being able to do anything else for the rest of the week."
Fibromyalgia,3bmnl4,Jawzper,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:22:48 2015 UTC,"Starting slow helped me. Before my bedrest it was my dog and kids that kept me out because we had to go for walks or else they'd be crazy and I couldn't handle that but after a really bad period we stopped and I hadn't left the house in awhile so I started a yoga pose a day thing to prove to everyone that exercise wasn't gonna help. When I noticed that after awhile I was feeling better I felt like an ass but I started stepping it back up and it happens faster than you know! If you had asked me in March if I'd rather smoke some pot or have 20 minutes to do some stretches or walking I'd pick pot. Ask me now and I'd pick moving. Except before bed, pot beats it there."
Fibromyalgia,3bmnl4,XD__,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:16:15 2015 UTC,"My fibromyalgia is typically at this level too. Sometimes exercise for me is just stretching throughout the day and maybe a few times up and down a step. Stretching is key tho. I typically try to stretch two to three times a day. Even on days I feel decent I try my best to refrain from doing anything big. And if I do plan on it I make sure I allow myself breaks and set my own pace if I'm with others. Even if I don't feel I need one at that moment I make sure I take it. Also, if she has the option to stay in bed if she ever wakes up tired tell her to go back to sleep. It's also best to have a dark bedroom.  I however have access to Medical Marijuana which really helps on the super bad days and weeks. It helps keep morale up when it seems so dark. I wish it was available worldwide."
Fibromyalgia,3bn8ml,ginafeesh,3,Tue Jun 30 16:07:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, I get this.  I would say you're getting flare up pain from intensely overdoing the exercise.  I would recommend slowly working your way up, VERY SLOWLY. by doing a couple minutes at a time and increasing by a minute or two every four or five workout sessions.  I've been doing this since January and now I'm up to 30 minutes of cardio, no flareups.  I'm now going to increase the intensity at intervals so I can run.  Just think: the goal of working out is to NOT flare up.  It's absurdly hard, but if you do it right, it helps SO much.  Hugs and good luck!  (Would be happy to answer any questions about my exercise exploits.)"
Fibromyalgia,3bn8ml,BradburySauce,2,Sat Jul 4 03:29:20 2015 UTC,"I get this. I'll get stabbing, nerve-like pain in my left leg, then it'll jump to my right elbow, then to my left side of my neck, down to my toes. I even call the time in between jumps ""the eye of the storm"". There's a brief moment between switching body parts where I don't have any pain. I brace for impact when that happens.   Exercise will instigate this much more in the beginning but it will ultimately make flares less frequent and milder in severity...at least that is what I have noticed after 3 months of pretty serious gym activity (5 days a week, weight lifting, cardio, etc). Keep at it but be nice to yourself after sessions, i.e. warm baths and stretching."
Fibromyalgia,3bn8ml,Ridiculous_Diagnosis,2,Tue Jun 30 20:23:16 2015 UTC,"I got too much exercise a week and a half ago.  At first I was sore everywhere, then the pain became more specific in my left rib cage, then gradually it became even more specific to a particular rib.  I think that what happened to me was I sprained a rib, but at first my nervous system couldn't tell where the problem was.  When a nervous system doesn't know where the problem is, you feel pain in a bigger area.  Over time the nervous system works out where the problem is, making the pain more specific and less severe.  If possible, try to work out where exactly the problem is, eg by prodding around to find where you are sorest to the touch.  The information should help your nervous system identify the true source of the problem, and reduce pain levels sooner.  General aches and pains all over due to inflammation of overworked muscles should only last 2 or 3 days.  Anything after that is either damage to a specific muscle, inaccurate nerve pain or an infection like a cold or flu."
Fibromyalgia,3bn8ml,FibroMan,2,Wed Jul 1 00:59:42 2015 UTC,"I feel pain like this basically every week I work 2 or more shifts in a row. I can only work three 4 hour and one 8 hour shift a week, but if it's 4 days in a row I am in significantly more widespread pain. It seems, though, mine isn't as severe as yours as I can fall asleep. Tylenol and a green little plant take the edge off but never get rid of it completely. I feel radiating mild pain throughout my joints and muscles and more intense pain in the bottom of my feet. Basically, you're not alone. If it is tolerable and not interfering with sleep or work try over the counter meds to help and accept that post work out or physical activity pain for us always will be worse than  others. If it's bad enough for more intense treatment, try to find a doctor. When my flare ups were really bad I took flexeril at night. I now take 75 mg of effexor for anxiety and mild depression and it seems to help a bit with the fibro too as I can't take the flexeril but generally haven't needed it since the effexor (being tested as an approved treatment for fibro). Good luck to you!

Have you had joint x-rays? Pred + MTX definitely are not drugs for fibromyalgia. You could perhaps seek out another opinion. Prednisone isn't an option for long term management though and I'd wager that would've been the one fighting any kind of fatigue. You could maybe get a GP or similar to give you something like amantidine or provigil for fatigue, that might help you."
Fibromyalgia,3bltar,zebra-stampede,2,Tue Jun 30 13:07:49 2015 UTC,Omigod. I love love love the way prednisone makes me feel. So so so much better. But it is actually not good to take long term. Causes even worse side effects like whale humps and what not. But my ruematologist and I made a deal. Instead of taking prednisone long term he will give me Methlyprednisone packs whenever I have a flare up. It works great in stopping it and I don't take it long term. Only when it is very severe.

Fibromyalgia,3bltar,Phantmswan,2,Tue Jun 30 19:29:27 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to say that I wish I could help, and that the theory that you have some sort of autoimmune disorder, despite the normal blood tests, is a solid theory.  I don't think you will have any luck getting a diagnosis though :(  Maybe there are very specific genetic tests that you haven't done yet?  If so, your lab rat, ahem, younger brother, could do the genetic tests, and since you have similar symptoms and are closely related you could skip the testing yourself ;)  It is also possible that you have fibromyalgia in addition to an autoimmune disorder, but you probably don't want to hear that.  Prednisone and methotrexate sound like really nasty drugs.  I have no knowledge of treatments for autoimmune disorders, but maybe there are weaker drugs that you could try, or possibly some non-drug therapies?  Doctors might be scared to give you a prescription for something that can make you much worse.  Even if you were diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder they might be unwilling to prescribe them.  Anyway, best of luck mdm162.  I hope you can find something that helps you and your brother."

Running shoes have a lot of nice features to support feet.  My suggestion would be to go to a shoe store and try on a lot of different brands and styles then purchase the one that feels the most comfortable and wear them everyday even when you're just hanging around the house.  I've had my shoes for 8 months and they still look new because I'm taking really good care of them because they weren't cheap and I want to get every last penny worth I can out of them.

Even the the surface is soft it can still put a lot of pressure on your heels and even makes them numb. I get a shooting pain every once in a while. Just sit up for a bit (if you can) and get some circulation back to your feet.

I also exercise my feet with a stretch I learned from my doctor when my arch was acting up. Basically, just pull the top of your foot up straight towards your leg to stretch out your arch and heel. http://i.imgur.com/2sXIrdD.jpg  Once you do it a while, you can do it without your hands. There are a few other stretches if you search ""plantar fasciitis stretch."""
Fibromyalgia,3bh9sh,anothermomhere,3,Mon Jun 29 05:20:04 2015 UTC,"Ha-ha yeaaaaah I've had full body EMG and NCS. While you're in there already you might want to clarify if an NCS might be diagnostic as well.   It is, surprisingly, not my favorite test. I wouldn't say it was excruciating. It wasn't fun but it wasn't like, awful. At this point I can't remember off hand which test is which (EMG vs NCS) I had them done the same day and I'm on mobile currently. I think the needle part they stick them in and then tell you to move your muscles or something, I think in an NCS they put a little machine on you that gives out an electric pulse. Feels like if you accidentally touched a prong as it was coming out of the socket or those shocking games at places like Dave and busters.   Apparently my old neuro was a quack and did a full body one in one day which my new neuro says is just rude and unnecessarily invasive (whether he just wants an additional office visit copay idk lol). But so I did that and I survived. It's been two years so I might have some jaded memories but I went, the one part that sticks out to me most as what bothered me was sticking a needle in my toe. Lol. Got fried pickles after and went to bed.   Tl;Dr you will be fine. I would not say excruciating, not in the top 5 things that have bothered me pain wise in terms of medical tests. Top 10 maybe."
Fibromyalgia,3bh9sh,zebra-stampede,2,Mon Jun 29 05:36:36 2015 UTC,Ditto. EMG sucked but I lived and it makes for a good story. And the neurologist was actually informative and discusses results with me on the spot.
Fibromyalgia,3bh9sh,rfrancissmith,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:56:42 2015 UTC,"I think he's planning both EMG and NCS as he described it as a 2 part test, one being not too bad and the other part being where the needles go in and people finding that more painful."
Fibromyalgia,3bh9sh,SD_Bitch,3,Tue Jun 30 00:41:57 2015 UTC,"I've had 3, 2 on my arms, 1 on my leg. Most of the test is just mildly uncomfortable,  but there's 1 spot on each arm and leg that, for me, was blindingly painful. I would call that one spot excruciating, but it lasts all of 3 seconds, then it's done. 3 seconds of excruciating is a small price to pay for an accurate diagnosis,  IMO."
Fibromyalgia,3bh9sh,SD_Bitch,2,Mon Jun 29 13:11:07 2015 UTC,"Of course, I mainly want to make sure it's fairly standard practice among those with a possible fibro condition, that he's not doing some strange and not necessarily helpful test..."
Fibromyalgia,3bh9sh,easpider,2,Tue Jun 30 00:50:00 2015 UTC,"No, it's pretty standard. They want to make sure you don't have any nerve damage that could be causing your pain, as the treatments may be different."
Fibromyalgia,3bh9sh,useminame,3,Tue Jun 30 02:10:27 2015 UTC,"I've had this done a couple of times to rule out nerve damage.  It's a bit odd really, because I don't know if anyone else has this at all, but in some places it hurt normally as it should when you're stuck with a needle and told to move your muscle around, and in other spots I couldn't feel anything at all."
Fibromyalgia,3bh9sh,KittyL0ver,3,Mon Jun 29 16:50:31 2015 UTC,"I've had an EMG on my arms and legs.  Be sure to breathe and relax your muscles when the needles are being inserted.  I didn't hurt at all afterward.  I was just really tired, but then again I'm practically narcoleptic because of my fibro.  haha"
Fibromyalgia,3bh9sh,zebra-stampede,5,Mon Jun 29 17:25:48 2015 UTC,"I had this done to rule out other conditions.  It was painful, but not excruciating.  A flare up is far worse in my opinion, and the test only lasts a few minutes.  Good luck!"
Fibromyalgia,3bh9sh,lbsmith5,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:29:52 2015 UTC,I'd agree. Flares last for days sometimes and are continually bothering me. This test was more it sucked while it was happening but then it was over and I got on with my life relatively problem free.

I'm skIttish with needles, but the more I relaxed, the less it hurt.  The only one I couldn't out relax the pain was in the hand.  That one was excruciating, and the pain lingered for a couple days.  I also had a nerve conduction study done at the same time.  Those shocks were painful, but not bad.  I'd been feeling shocks very similar to that for a few weeks, so I was used to those."
Fibromyalgia,3bh9sh,mdm162,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:43:37 2015 UTC,I've had this test done a couple of times.

If it's been a rough week, there will definitely be lots of naps.

I knew all about fibro and was doing everything I could at home but kept getting chronic infections and unbearable pain. I also gained a tolerance to any medication incredibly quick. The mayo clinic was very nice, well organized and equipped, however they did not find certain key things with my health problems. For example they noticed I had some torn cartilage in my hip, but failed to see that my hip bones were misshapen and pinching. They also failed to test me for Lyme disease which it turns out I have and am now being treated for. The doctors were all very nice, and while some had some decent insight I think fibro is still such a misunderstood condition and can be very politicized in the medical world that it takes a lot of looking to find a doctor that will take the time to do some research and see you as a person instead of a generalized illness.

They referred me to psychiatry, who laughed at that diagnosis, and pushed fibro.  I was then sent to internal med, as the fibro clinic is really hard to get into.  They're booked up usually 3-4 months out.  I'm going back, to go to their 5 day class on fibro, but going to schedule it for spring.

Fibromyalgia,3b9d60,FibroMan,2,Sat Jun 27 01:19:34 2015 UTC,"I have allodynia and a big problem for me is light/medium pressure especially on my legs. For example roughly scratching an itch through jeans can be too much pressure and cause intense lingering pain. But if I lightly scratch it/rub my finger nails along the sore spot it creates a new sensation which kind of 'distracts' or 'resets' my nerves.   I think this works because of the way chronic pain and allodynia work. The nerves overreact and send the wrong pain signals to the brain, resulting in more intense pain than usual. So I guess introducing a new/different sensation will disrupt this pain cycle. I'm no doctor though and this is just an educated guess so I could be wrong."
Fibromyalgia,3b9d60,Laur-Ent,2,Sat Jun 27 08:07:40 2015 UTC,"It could be due to gate theory.  I think light rubbing closes the gate to pain.  I am not sure how gate theory and allodynia interact, but it sounds like it still works for you.  In my case, light rubbing creates pain from allodynia, but it also seems to close the gate if there is non-allodynia pain.  It can't create pain and close the gate at the same time.  Maybe my experiment reminds my brain that light rubbing is supposed to close the gate?  Is the lingering pain of a pinch the same as pain from medium pressure for you?"
Fibromyalgia,3b9d60,Laur-Ent,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:29:43 2015 UTC,"Hmm that's pretty interesting. I guess it's good that we at least have something to help the problem! Maybe this stuff will help treatment options in the future.   Yeah generally a light pinch can have the same effect. I mostly have it on my arms and legs but it's worse on my legs. Bumping into stuff, getting pinched, different pressures, wearing tight jeans, all cause increased pain. Bumping into something which would normally be a light pain is now equivalent to being whacked with a baseball bat.   It's hard to explain to people why I'm suddenly overwhelmed by pain after they've just lightly punched me in the leg!"
Fibromyalgia,3b9d60,ZanSquid,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:52:18 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean about light punches, but that would be called hyperalgesia rather than allodynia.  If the stimulus is normally a little bit painful, but instead it feels very painful then it is hyperalgesia.  If the stimulus doesn't normally cause any pain at all, but for some reason it does then it is allodynia.  Both are symptoms of fibro.  I am currently using a foam roller to reduce my hyperalgesia.  The theory is that every time you deliberately cause pain without causing tissue damage the nerves become a little bit less sensitive.  The effect is cumulative, until tissue damage starts to happen, causing inflammation, which probably makes the nerves more sensitive again.  Foam rolling doesn't cause tissue damage, although at first it sure feels like it does!  Each time you do it, it becomes less painful.  Desensitizing to pressure should help with pain from knocks and bumps.  The foam rolling seems to help by about 0.5% each time, which might make you think it isn't working or it isn't worth doing.  However, because it is cumulative, after doing it daily for 3 months it works out to be about a 50% improvement, which is a good outcome and well worth it.  The effect seems to be localized to where the rolling has been done.  I started using a foam roller on my back, because rolling is really good at stretching out the joints in the spine.  I often get 5 or 6 cracks from my back in a single roll :)  After a few months I noticed that my back muscles weren't as sensitive, eg when massaged, but everywhere else was just as sensitive, so I have started rolling shoulders, arms and legs.  The pain from rolling has decreased, so I assume I have decreased sensitivity, but it isn't something that I specifically test.  TL;DR: you could try foam rolling to see if it helps reduce pain from accidental bumps, but it might take a few months to have a noticeable effect, and it will only work where rolled."

Fibromyalgia,3b9jbq,donnadoctor,2,Sat Jun 27 02:17:53 2015 UTC,"It sounds like a withdrawal symptom from stopping Cymbalta.  The best solution is to go back on the Cymbalta, but if you can't then Lyrica or gabapentin might help with the pain."
Fibromyalgia,3b9jbq,FibroMan,2,Sat Jun 27 03:11:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the encouragement. The medication vacation started because my new pcp did an EKG that was abnormal (prolonged Q-T interval). It can be caused by lots of different meds, including tons of antidepressants, so they cut my dose in half and when that didn't help took me off it completely.  The good news is everything else with my heart is great, and my latest EKG was about the same as where we started. I'll talk to the cardiologist next week and plead my case for cymbalta.  The biggest reason my pcp wants me to get evaluated for fibro is that I've been struggling with serious fatigue for years. I wasn't aware that the focus of diagnosis had moved away from strictly trigger points, which I never really thought applied to me, not that I ever was actually tested. We're ruling out other stuff too, of course. I see a sleep specialist next week, so we'll see what that turns up."
Fibromyalgia,3b9jbq,manipulationcreation,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:08:31 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely say this is withdrawal, Cymbalta can definitely cause that if you don't wean off properly. Unfortunately if the OTC stuff doesn't help then there's not many other things in terms of medicine that you can try. I would just say try using heat, stay hydrated, and definitely get enough rest. Good luck!"
Fibromyalgia,3b9jbq,lbsmith5,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:33:06 2015 UTC,"Did you step down with the Cymbalta? I'm sorry you're having a rough time!! After 8 years, you could still be going through withdrawls.   If you have a bathtub you can use, baths with epsom salts sometimes help me along with heating pads/ice packs depending on what kind of pain. I hope your referral is soon!! I take Cymbalta along with gabapentin. I'm not sure why you went off the Cymbalta, but if it seems like you need something else as well, Lyrica or gabapentin are good options."
Fibromyalgia,3b9jbq,kwxt,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:51:19 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't do anything stronger than OTC without consulting your doctor.   It may sound silly, but have you tried breathing? 5 in/5 out right to your belly? Or is there anything that you can look at that might make your body responsively relax and let some of the pain out? Little kids are a classic example (they move their bodies so efficiently!) but I also like looking at youtube of the astronauts on the ISS because they're floating.   For some people distraction makes the pain better, for some it makes the pain worse. If it helps, it there anything that could distract you? Netflix perhaps, or a simple phone game?  I know that both these suggestions are much gentler than you're looking for, but perhaps they can help.   Cymbalta withdrawl can be awful. I did 8 weeks on it with intense vertigo and the spinning/rocking senstation didn't go away until I'd been fully off of it for 6 whole weeks. Tough it out. It does get better.  Sounds like your doctor is thinking creatively, which is always good.   Good luck with it!"

The next day would be 3 min, 1 min. Then 2 min, 1 min and eventually go down further. (I might have the numbers mixed up but you get the idea.)   So if c25k isn't working for you, take the plan and just make smaller steps. Do the first day for a week if you have to. Some people just aren't built to be runners (I'm one of them, I have horrible knees), so if you find out you can't do it, there's plenty of other exercise routines.

I was on Amatryptaline for migraines, but it only helped marginally at best.  It also started to give me the cardio toxic reactions between that and gabapentin.  Once I came off of long acting morphine, ama didn't seem to do much of anything.  My migraine frequency went up to the 20, from somewhere around 8 to 10.  The procedure takes 15 to 20 minutes and, I'll be honest, it isn't pleasant a lot of times.  They have you lay on your back with your chin facing up.  They then put a numbing med in your nose and have you lay there for 15 minutes with it in.  It stings slightly for a second when they put it in.  You then sit up and drain your nasal cavity.  You will taste it a bit afterwards, and it tastes like eating medicine.  That said, I will gladly go through that to be pretty well rid of them.  Mine all focused around my eyes and forehead.

Lyrica really did help with my fibro symptoms to a small degree, but I didn't notice a decrease in migraines while taking it. The only reason I stopped taking it was that I was experiencing some issues with suicidal ideation that was VERY scary, and stopped when I discontinued use. For migraines and fibro, topamax might be an option. I've heard people say that topamax can help with nerve related pain in addition to being a great migraine preventative (I can't take it, as it makes me a crying, depressed mess). I currently take inderal as a migraine preventative and tramadol for fibro. I wish there was two pills in one, but these two help me quite a bit.

Lyrica is the best medication ever for my chronic daily headache, and it helps a little with body aches too.  I have gained weight on it but for me it is worth it.  I could tell that Lyrica was working within a few days of taking it.  I had tried amitriptyline for my chronic daily headache before I got my fibro diagnosis.  It increased my sleep requirement by about an hour per day and it did nothing for my headache.  I recently tried nortriptyline.  It seemed to help with the headache a little bit, but the longer I took it the more tired I felt, so I had to stop taking it.  I have found that if my headache gets worse then I can take an extra Lyrica to clear it.  To me, Lyrica seems to be the stronger drug.  Don't worry too much about what Lyrica and amitriptyline do to other people.  Try them both and see which one helps you the most."

Amitriptyline not so much for me, it was OK-ish but didn't do enough for it to be worth falling asleep stupidly early all the time...but please, please be careful with Lyrica.  I'm still getting effects from it 6 months after being on it (and I was only taking it for about a week) - It made me literally fall into walls. It was like being drunk/stoned but in the worst possible way, with really awful nightmares...then there was constant hunger but also relenteless nausea. Man.   I know everyone is so different, some people have great results with it, just try one at a time so you're sure you know what's working and what's causing any possible side effects, so you can feel more in control with it all - a massive plus when your body is causing you to feel so ""out of control"".  Good luck! Oh and gabapentin is a lot more gentle in my experience, but with similar pain management effects as lyrica. Good luck dude! :)"

I gave up on it after six weeks due to the massive weight gain and lack of relief.  I was escalating the dosage up every few days and getting nowhere.  I'd be a zombie for two days, then 'normal' but with no headache relief, so I'd up the dose and do the same two-day zombie but no relief, then up again. It was horrible.  I've just stopped Lyrica after only three weeks.  No weight gain, but it's making me so exhausted I can't function. It gave me minor pain relief at the beginning, but I'd rather have the pain and (limited) energy, than slightly less pain and no life at all :("

Fibromyalgia,3b152g,calamitycurls,2,Thu Jun 25 03:14:52 2015 UTC,"Did you ask your doc about chronic myofascial pain syndrome? From your lack of general acheyness, it could be that? I'm not doc but it's worth bringing up!  With that being said, I'm not sure what you mean by clarity but I'll try and help. Fibro sucks, and it will always suck, but I try and tell myself to never use it as a crutch. Maybe I have to push myself harder than a lot of people, but I try not to fall back on my illness as an excuse to not do something. I also think that being generally healthy in ways I can control has helped quite a bit mentally and physically. I workout as much as possible and try to eat super healthy, it makes me feel more in control, as well as actually helping my pain threshold.  It took me a while to come around to my diagnosis. It's something we live with everyday, and the part I struggle with the most is the judgements and comments of others. Using a cane as young as I am definitely warrants unwanted gaze and questions, and being told I am faking or dramatic drives me up the wall. But remembering that these people are willfully ignorant and irrelevant. In general, fibro has made me SO proactive with my help. I take very good care of myself wherever possible and every time I do something good for myself, I am happy. I guess it's the little things with health that we have to be happy about, because that's all we have.  Sorry for the huge post (and also that I'm on mobile).

Fibromyalgia,3b152g,manipulationcreation,2,Thu Jun 25 07:11:11 2015 UTC,"There are also differential diagnoses in addition to fibromyalgia that often go undiagnosed but cause a similar constellation of symptoms; among these include connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, though you would need to see a reputable geneticist to rule that in or out (even without actual genetic testing)."
Fibromyalgia,3b152g,R2W,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:18:44 2015 UTC,"Just thought I would chime in about what a diagnosis does for you.   It feels both satisfying and frustrating at the same time. Before I was told that I had Fibro, my pain felt like I was being attacked by an unseen assailant, as if I were sitting in a dark room, unable to defend myself from whatever was hurting me.   On bad days, my diagnosis reminds me that Fibro remains incurable and an anomaly in the medical community. On good days, however, I feel like I'm sitting in that same room with my attacker. But the lights are on. And I've got raised fists.   In other, less dramatic words, the diagnosis makes me feel less of a person on my insecure days but makes me feel strong and capable on my good days, knowing what it is exactly that I'm facing. It helps me deal with it now that I know who my enemy is. It helps me love myself, knowing that it's not all in my head and it's not my fault either.   If what you have isn't fibro in the end, figuring out what the problem is will help you move on physically but also emotionally."
Fibromyalgia,3b152g,Ridiculous_Diagnosis,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:33:39 2015 UTC,"I just want to say: fibromyalgia is different for everyone. Even though your mom experiences a lot of pain, maybe pain isn't a major component for you. Maybe it will be one day, maybe it won't. There's no way to predict who suffers how much from fibro, and there's absolutely no reason to feel guilty about having less pain than your mom or anyone else with fibro.  That said, you should definitely get a definitive diagnosis (or as ""definitive"" as possible with fibro.) It could be fibro, but it could also be a whole bunch of other things, including other rheumatological conditions but also autoimmune or neurological problems. A diagnosis will help make sure you're getting the right treatments, gives you a better chance of having your insurance approve things for you like medications and physical therapy (as compared to a more vague diagnosis or none at all), and will allow you and your doctor to better manage your problems the right way. Not getting a diagnosis won't take away from your mom's pain. Getting a diagnosis won't suddenly cause you to have severe pain when you didn't before.  For the record, I get pretty severe pain sometimes, but many of the other symptoms of fibro (sleep problems, fogginess) bother me more. Getting my diagnosis helped make sure I got the right medications to help with those."
Fibromyalgia,3b152g,pm-me-baby-elephants,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:44:40 2015 UTC,"It is possible that there are some genetic risk factors for fibromyalgia that run in your family.  You can still get fibromyalgia without a family history of it though.  It is unlikely that Polymialgia is in any way related to fibromyalgia genetically.  Some of the genetic risk factors for depression are also risk factors for fibromyalgia.  The genetics of fibromyalgia are not simple and ""environmental factors"" play a large role, although nobody knows what those ""environmental factors"" are, so until we do it is best described as bad luck.  Don't read too much into your mother and grandmother both having fibro.  The genetics of fibromyalgia are not as simple as passing the disease directly from mother to daughter.  We don't know how it works, but we know it doesn't work like that.  The level of pain is not as important as you might think in diagnosing fibromyalgia.  I ""only"" get aches and pains, and I have never had screaming agony.  What matters is that those aches and pains are in my muscles and tendons, they are widespread and they are not going away any time soon.  I only have about 25% of all the symptoms of fibro, but the majority of the symptoms are entirely optional.  There are only a handful of diseases that cause chronic, widespread aches and pains in muscles and tendons.  Most of them cause other more specific, obvious symptoms, and many of them can be tested for.  Pretty much all of them are less common than fibromyalgia.  I have one suggestion for a possible alternative diagnosis:  small fiber neuropathy.  It could explain the itching/burning sensations that were presumptuously blamed on eczema.  The only way to conclusively rule it out is via biopsy, so research it first and see if it might fit.  People with fibromyalgia have a broad range of symptom severity.  There is no reason to think that you will ever experience the agony that your mother has.  You are a completely different person to your mother or grandmother.  Even if you get a fibro diagnosis, that doesn't mean that you will have the same symptoms as them, nor does it mean that you need to pursue the same treatment path that they did.  You might want to consider doing the  FIQR  (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire), and get your mother to do the same.  It might help you and your mother understand your points of difference.  I am pretty sure that nobody wanted a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, although I did because my doctor thought I had depression and anxiety instead.  Thankfully the psychologist I had to see wasn't so presumptuous.  She pushed me to keep pursuing medical avenues until I finally got my diagnosis.  Two years later I am still trying to find out what exactly that diagnosis means ;)  A lot of people question their diagnosis of fibromyalgia.  I know I did for a few months.  My fibro is nothing like what other people have.  For example, I have no idea what people are talking about when they say they have sensitivity to cold.  Some people will have a rare, one in a million genetic disorder instead of fibromyalgia, but if you have a diagnosis of fibromyalgia from a rheumatologist it is probably 99% accurate.  It is significantly more common to have fibromyalgia AND something else, so if you get a new symptom then get it checked out by a doctor.  Fibromyalgia doesn't vaccinate you against any other diseases :(  It is possible that some of your symptoms are NOT related to fibromyalgia.  It is important to find out which are not related and to investigate and treat them separately.  Targeting the treatable symptoms can help reduce the pain cycles that make the fibro symptoms worse.  For example, you might be able to get better medications for treating your migraines, and if you do, it might make your fibro symptoms more bearable.  I sometimes see more symptoms of fibro in my wife than are really there.  It is just because I am more aware of the symptoms, and they are nothing that other people don't experience at times.  The difference with having fibro is that the symptoms are ALWAYS there.  A good night's sleep doesn't make the aches or brain fog go away.  Anyway, your mother is probably hyper-aware of fibro symptoms and sees more of them in you than you really have.  That is okay.  She isn't going to diagnose you.  An objective, trained professional will make that call.  So yes, I think it is worthwhile pursuing a fibro diagnosis."
Fibromyalgia,3b152g,FibroMan,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:10:12 2015 UTC,"You should, because fibro can really only reached through exclusion.  I know there are other conditions that can cause excema, so you should see a (new) rheumatologist to exclude any other inflammation diseases.  It's also comforting because of the nagging fear that you do have some other terrible disease- it gives you an excuse to push for answers that can be comforting."

After a few very painful weeks the pain lessened and it became easier to walk. I've slowly pushed myself further and further each month, walking quicker and quicker. By the third month I was able to power walk most of 1.5 miles.   I'm in South Florida where it is now far too hot, but once or twice a week I get out for an early morning or late evening walk. Recently I've started jogging short spurts, which is painful and triggers flare ups, but I also feel it strengthening me. I would not recommend jogging, I try because I'm young, mid 30s, with flexible work hours, allowing me to work around flare ups."

For someone like your mom, the same routine every day will eventually become what her body expects and will simply be good for her to stay active, as opposed to constantly pushing muscles to get stronger.   I will say, however, that muscle soreness from the gym, while it is definitely still pain, is MUCH more manageable than fibro pain. Maybe it's a psychological thing, knowing that the pain 1. will subside in a day or two 2. is productive and 3. can be explained and treated effectively.  Being active is so important."

The ones that are ""negative"" (you haven't had them) can be just as helpful to a doctor as the ones that are ""positive"" (you have had them.) This can help you think of what symptoms you've had, which can be hard when you're used to trying to ignore them, and also help with the organization of the list. Obviously, you should add something in if it isn't on the review of systems list already.  I agree that you should write a list and bring it with you to the appointment. Rheumatologists/neurologists/etc are used to seeing patients with a wide variety of symptoms, so the doctor may or may not ask more questions about them but won't think you're crazy for having them all.  I also have another way to think about what symptoms you want to focus on most: which symptoms are bothering you the most or interfere with your life the most? For example, if you had constant mild tingling in one pinky, and also sharp excrutiating pains in your back that only happened once a week, you might mention the pinky but you definitely want to focus the appointment on the back pain, if that makes sense."

Fibromyalgia,3auss9,lilsalliemae,2,Tue Jun 23 18:01:36 2015 UTC,If I was you I would ask to try pregabalin or gabapentin.  Try it for a week or so and see whether it helps or whether it gives you side effects.
Fibromyalgia,3arm4i,kflueg,4,Mon Jun 22 23:11:30 2015 UTC,"Come prepared.  Have your medical history down pat, speak to everything you have in symptoms and if you can have a partner there, do so.  It wasn't until my wife started to come with me that things really started to roll along nicely as she filled in my fibro fog gaps."
Fibromyalgia,3arm4i,Ialmostthewholepost,3,Tue Jun 23 01:04:07 2015 UTC,"The only thing I ever say for diagnosis is to go in there and talk initially about only your symptoms. Make the doctor come up with their own ideas about what is wrong with you. A nurse told me that once. If you go in there saying you think you have fibro, then that closes the box on their creative thinking. Fine to share your ideas if/when they ask you. Good luck!"
Fibromyalgia,3arm4i,zebra-stampede,3,Tue Jun 23 13:37:13 2015 UTC,"Make sure that they are 110% convinced beyond doubt that they have ruled out every other possible diagnosis without fail, even for rare and obscure stuff. It's better to spend the time and money going through testing for these than spend the rest of your life with a bullshit diagnosis when you haven't something controllable or curable that was missed because they went with the easy option."
Fibromyalgia,3arm4i,Decepticle_Ronnie,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:55:00 2015 UTC,This. I highly recommend requesting a tilt table test if you get dizzy at all. I was diagnosed with POTS and Sleep Apnea after the Fibro diagnosis. Getting treatment for both of those by next week and seeing if the fibro symptoms go away or remain with the other two taken care of. Make sure you know what is commonly co-morbid so you can be tested for those issues as well.
Fibromyalgia,3arm4i,A_Positive_Outlook,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:24:12 2015 UTC,"Whenever I have big appointments I like to write lists of three things:   -Your symptoms. It saves me lots of time when I have them all written down instead of struggling to remember everything and possibly leaving something out. Obviously this isn't necessary if you only have a few symptoms.   -your medication. Including supplements.   -Questions. Write down every single thing you want to ask about to make sure you don't forget. It can be hard to organise your thoughts when in the midst of a big appointment, especially if you're foggy. There's nothing worse than leaving the appointment only to remember on your way home that you forgot to ask something really important.   Having these things all written down before hand is extremely helpful and your doctor will appreciate it. Mostly it saves time, but it always helps me feel much less overwhelmed when I know I don't have to worry about covering everything.  Also if you don't already have your medical history well versed, go over it all in your head before the appointment. If you're like me and you have a looong medical history, it takes a while to go through it all with a new doctor. So to save time, organise it all in your head with a rough timeline and you should hopefully save yourself some time."
Fibromyalgia,3aqj6k,littlepanda518,6,Mon Jun 22 18:16:52 2015 UTC,"Short answer: don't.   Long answer: Where are you? US or otherwise? Do you have an HR department? Was flex time worked into a contract you signed when you started by chance? I'm always personally (from the US) very weary of informing anyone outside of HR of my medical business. In my last job it garnered me some functional proficiency to briefly state I had medical problems (I went with RA simply for the office, which I am also diagnosed with). If you have an HR department and a diagnosis, they are required (again in the US at least) to make reasonable accommodations for you. For me, this translated into a flex work schedule, coming in at 930 am instead of 8 am, they knew I didn't take stairs, made sure there was always a chair for me in the manufacturing areas. I have a handicap placard from my state so I just parked in handicap parking right up front. Could you look into getting one of that?   I know the feeling of thinking others will presume you're just being lazy and all because of accommodations and it sucks and sometimes I think we do have to work harder to just prove ourselves. That said, definitely if you can talk to an HR department about accommodations because if you use them you can help get your health under control and be a better you, which in turn, is better for the company (always throw in how you can help the company.)   I let my HR rep present the necessary details of my accommodations to my managers so I didn't get any pushback. You might also want to firmly schedule a lunch hour that's every day so you can eat at a standard time. This helps me.   Good luck!"
Fibromyalgia,3aqj6k,zebra-stampede,0,Mon Jun 22 20:17:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply and the information. Yes, I am in the US. I am going to ask my doctor about a placard when I see him next week. There is so much that is going on in my head it is hard to keep it all straight. :/"
Fibromyalgia,3aqj6k,zebra-stampede,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:17:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a lot, but you'll get it sorted out. Just make a list of what you need to do so you make sure to get the appropriate documentation. Also make sure you're taking care of yourself -- both mentally and physically. I'm not sure how large of a place you work at, but my last employer had a huge program for private counseling and stuff. Had some cute acronym. You could look into if yours offers something like that or some $$ kick back or incentive if you use one of their access programs. Of course, then they know you're using their access programs, but mental health isn't as stigmatized these days and can help you get affordable care if you can't otherwise. And mental health is going to be just as important.   We're all here for you! :)"
Fibromyalgia,3aqj6k,peanutgallerie,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:46:36 2015 UTC,"You don't need to tell him why you want to work from home. If you feel more comfortable then just ask if you can work from home X amount of time since your job can be done easily from home.   Also, in the US a company over 50 employees has to work with you on your disability. Get a diagnosis. Get FMLA. Work with HR and your boss on how to accommodate. Cover your ass but don't treat them like the enemy automatically if they have been good to you so far."
Fibromyalgia,3aqggo,radiotott,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:56:08 2015 UTC,"How did they figure out you had the bacteria growth?  My doctor threw a test in that I don't recall us talking about, it was apparently to tests for a bacteria that can cause ulcers. I came back negative, though."
Fibromyalgia,3aqggo,PeacefulTreeLand,2,Mon Jun 22 21:52:02 2015 UTC,"Different thing. You're confusing SIBO with helicobacter pylori. There is no test for SIBO except to take an antibiotic and check for improvement. Most people who have fibro symptoms and IBS symptoms don't have SIBO, it's just their digestive system going nuts from odd nerve signals."
Fibromyalgia,3aqggo,Decepticle_Ronnie,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:04:24 2015 UTC,"I've had stomach problems my whole life, so the doctor thought the antibiotic may help. It's true, there is no test for SIBO. I'm not sure if it's a real fibro connection, just that doctors working with mine are doing research on the possibility. Most fibro patients seem to have so many different symptoms and I figured someone else out there could be like me and would benefit from the info. Oh! I do agree with getting tested for H. pylori if you have ongoing problems with heartburn/acid reflux. It's surprising how many people just need to get rid of that and would be fine. Sadly, I didn't have it. I'm meeting with a surgeon soon to discuss nissen fundoplication because 15+ years on PPI's and H2 antagonists have been ineffective."

Fibromyalgia,3ao4rv,LibraryNargle,9,Mon Jun 22 02:54:47 2015 UTC,A big question for your doctor is whether you have an autoimmune disease that the prednisone is treating.
Fibromyalgia,3ao4rv,FibroMan,5,Mon Jun 22 05:17:56 2015 UTC,Was thinking the same thing. Seems a likely explanation.
Fibromyalgia,3ao4rv,KarenAdler,2,Mon Jun 22 06:01:56 2015 UTC,My wife who has fibro received a steroid drip in the hospital once. She felt amazing afterwards. Is that a warning sign that she might have an autoimmune disorder? I thought it was just massively effective at relieving inflammation and so forth.
Fibromyalgia,3ao4rv,mlbontbs87,3,Mon Jun 22 11:44:19 2015 UTC,"According to  this  ""In a two-week study to assess the efficacy of Prednisone, there was no significant difference between the Prednisone or placebo or baseline. However, it is thought that a therapeutic trial of Prednisone may be beneficial for the patient if a co-existent, steroid responsive disorder is suspected.""  If prednisone seems to help with fibro symptoms then something doesn't add up.  A co-existent autoimmune disorder that has evaded diagnosis seems to be a valid explanation.  If your wife hasn't seen a rheumatologist since getting the steroid drip in hospital then it might be worth a trip.  If I had to guess, I would say that your wife might have arthritis as well as fibro.  BTW, fibro does not cause inflammation, so the anti-inflammatory effect of prednisone is not a valid explanation for why your wife felt better after receiving the steroid drip."
Fibromyalgia,3ao4rv,FibroMan,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:47:30 2015 UTC,"I'm sure I've got at least one autoimmune disease or disorder. But, yes, that is the question of the hour to ask the doctor. She put me on it for my ear infection and it helped that, along with the rest of body. I feel effing fantastic."
Fibromyalgia,3ao4rv,workerdaemon,5,Mon Jun 22 13:58:18 2015 UTC,"I was on a steroid for a week and it was fucking fantastic. I keep asking to go on it again, even if it's just once in a long while, but no go.   My dog was dying and after a steroid pill she perked right back up and then crashed again. The vet said that was common, because steroids will do that to you. He then commented that he thinks everyone should take steroids at least once in their life just to know what it feels like.   The problem is steroids effectively causes your body to deteriorate faster. Kidney stones, bone loss, joint replacements, the works. It basically slowly shortens your life span, guaranteeing the end will be a misery of a destroyed defective body with the pain of all the various organ systems failing on you.   It's a dream."
Fibromyalgia,3ao4rv,mlbontbs87,2,Mon Jun 22 04:07:40 2015 UTC,My mother has taken prednisone for maybe 3 months a year for the last decade or two. She hasn't observed her body falling apart because of it but she always gets massive weight gain from it that takes the rest of the year to fix.

Fibromyalgia,3ao4rv,SD_Bitch,2,Mon Jun 22 14:03:54 2015 UTC,"Just please be careful with Prednisone and other corticosteroids. They elevate your blood sugars and keep your body from producing the proper amount of insulin to lower them, leading to diabetes from long-term use. Yes, it's an amazing feeling, but not worth the complications that come from long-term use.  I was on 2.5mg Prednisone for about 2 years for my arthritis. I wasn't even pre-diabetic before I started the Prednisone, but ended up with an A1C of 7.8. Now I deal with diabetic neuropothy on top of my fibro, which sucks so bad."

Fibromyalgia,3aoo6q,ldyhawc,6,Mon Jun 22 06:26:48 2015 UTC,"Tough love time: What do you want the ER to do? The best they can do is give you morphine that will last a few hours at best. This isn't an emergency issue, it's a long-term, chronic issue and it needs better management. Make a phone call and talk with you neurologist and explain the situation. If they don't understand, then find a new one. It all depends what you're already tried what can be done for you. I really doubt that going to the ER is going to end well for you. And get to someone for the suicidal thoughts. That's not something to be ignored."
Fibromyalgia,3aoo6q,Decepticle_Ronnie,3,Mon Jun 22 17:45:07 2015 UTC,"As much as it sucks, if you go to the ER complaining of pain and they can't find a cause, you probably won't leave with anything stronger than Naproxen. For my last trip to the ER I got Tramadol but I think that was because my GP sent me there with an abnormal EKG to go along with my chest pain, so there was objective evidence that something unusual was going on. But if you're in that much pain and your neuro still only wants to see you twice a year, it might be time to get rid of him. Or get a pain management specialist. I think an appt every 3 months is reasonable, anything less is questionable. And if you don't already have one, get a psychologist on board. I completely understand that feeling, was close to it the other night when my left hand and forearm spent four agonizing hours in constant myoclonic spasm (I have a neurological movement disorder) and at one point I could almost convince myself that, as a right handed person, I didn't really need the left arm anyway and I should just cut it off. So I do understand it, but still think a therapist is a good idea. Some specialize in pain patients, so it's worth looking into. I hope you feel better soon."
Fibromyalgia,3aoo6q,jlmitch12,2,Mon Jun 22 11:21:36 2015 UTC,"Have you considered pursuing the pain management route? It sucks to live in pain, and it's humbling to ask for that help. I know, because I've been there. Opiates are not the best long term treatment for fibro related pain, but alternatives like tramadol might be very helpful. The ER doesn't know your long term day-to-day like whomever is working at the ER on a random given day. There is not a lot they can do, and I don't blame them for being cautious. Drug seekers with addiction problems take advantage of the ER. You have a legitimate reason to seek treatment. I went to my GP in frustration years back... A physiatrist was my doctor for fibro related stuff, and she was only willing to look at Cymbalta or Savella. Turns out, my GP had a nurse practitioner in the office with significant experience in pain management. She helped me develop a management plan. I go every three months for refills, sign a contract to ensure I'm taking my meds properly, and they know me well enough at this point to adjust things as needed. Tramadol isn't a wonder drug, but my pain levels (according to my pain log, which is another part of the plan) are averaging at 3-4 while taking it. I used to be 5-7 on a daily basis. Now, I take a combo of kratom and cannabis and am completely off the stuff. Nothing is a miracle, but you have options. Anyone who says you have to live with this just hasn't tried hard enough to help. I lived in that 5-7 window for 8 years, and it sucked. I hope you find some relief soon."
Fibromyalgia,3aoo6q,auntiechrist23,2,Mon Jun 22 20:42:31 2015 UTC,Fibro has a ton of different pains that can come and go and some can be helped and some we just have to suck up.   What type of pain are you having? Where is your pain? Have you been given any coping strategy by your doctors so far? Are you doing them?  This is going to come off callous but I have no better way to say it. A pain level of 10 is as high as it goes. You really need to be careful describing your pain as a 10. If you are sitting at your computer typing and forming rational sentences your pain is probably less than a 9 or 10. I am not trying to dismiss the pain you are in. I believe you are in immense pain. But you will be dismissed if you walk into an ER saying you have a pain level of 9 or 10. These are the people in  car accidents or with wounds or advanced stage cancer or who have something acute happening to them. This pain level leaves you incoherent.   Chronic pain is usually lower on the scale but due to its unrelenting nature it can be just as taking. When I was at my worst with fibro pain I was at a consistent 7 for hours at a time. My pain levels were a 4 to 7. That is nothing to sneeze about and very serious. I am currently around a 2 to 4 on the scale depending. I still have flares but I can control them much better.   Take a step back and try and figure out what the pain is... go through the steps above. Between all of us fibro geeks we can probably help you find some ways to cope both physically and mentally.

Fibromyalgia,3aoo6q,sgntpepper03,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:31:17 2015 UTC,"I've gone for really bad migraines. At the time I went to the ER for the first bad migraine, I did not take any controlled pain meds at all (now I have a handful for emergencies),and I was given a piss test, which came up clean, and when I was discharged, I was given a script for percocet to hold me over until I could get to the doctor. The other times I went I got percocet in the ER, but none to take home. I always bring my medical history with me (blood work, diagnostic imaging, names and numbers of doctors who gave me diagnoses) to back myself up when I walk in as a young person complaining of pain. It lends more credence to my complaint.    Now that I do take controlled pain meds on rare occassions, it might show up on a tox screen, but at super low doses. Maybe you can request a urinalysis to provide evidence that you take 1 hydrocodone a day. It's easy for them to distinguish between high doses of pain meds vs. low doses.  The problem with the ER is they only have to stabilize you. So you might get a decent painkiller for now, but there's no guarantee that you will get some to hold you over until your appointment. However going to the ER may give your doctor enough reason to accommodate a sooner appointment for you."

Fibromyalgia,3aoo6q,Grungegrownup,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:30:02 2015 UTC,"I'm going to argue for the flipside here.  Some of us have had bad experiences in the ER, but you don't know unless you try.  If your pain is so bad that you are in tears I would be going to the ER, then at least they would send a report to your doctor saying what has happened.  I've just spent a night in the ER for gallstones and I realise that they are super willing to give me morphine because gallstones is something recognised by everyone.  If I had to be at home during those episodes then I think I'd be suicidal as well.    I have asked my doctor what would happen if I went to the ER for fibro pain, and he said that they would give you a shot of morphine and get the pain under control and then you go home.  This is in New Zealand so could be different for you.  If you are that bad then give the ER a try, in my opinion.  A couple of hours relief if you can get it can make all the difference (and the lack of bloody sleep you get in there makes you super tired to sleep throughout the next day of pain at home..)"
Fibromyalgia,3aoo6q,Merkinfumble,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:11:40 2015 UTC,"Last time I went to the ER I could hardly walk. The dr said, ""but you CAN walk, so you can walk out of here and follow up with your psychiatrist.""  I told her to go fuck herself. Didn't solve the problem, but I was mad."
Fibromyalgia,3aoo6q,NikkiSicksable,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:04:34 2015 UTC,"I have never been to the ER for fibromyalgia pain, for the reasons you and also Decepticle_Ronnie have stated.  I have been to the ER for ER-type things, though.  Typically, hospital emergency rooms are staffed by highly unpleasant, unprofessional people who, if anything, take delight in human suffering.  Stay away.  Please be careful with the Advil!  Taking tons of NSAIDs can be very bad for the liver.  It is nice your doctor is considerate enough about your suffering to offer you opioid painkillers.  However, it is a dead end because of their notorious increase in drug tolerance and the health issues that come with higher amounts.  Even with unrestricted access to opioids, they are a dead end for that reason.    Depending on where you live, I would recommend investing in a good vaporizer and finding a source of marijuana.  It's hardly a silver bullet, but it is another tool in the toolbox.  It doesn't really make me ""high"" anymore unless I haven't had any in a while, which is sad because I used to enjoy it recreationally, but it is better than getting high every time I use it.  Unfortunately, drowsiness and the munchies don't go away with this kind of regular use.  As for your suicidal thoughts, be careful who you speak about those to.  There are plenty of people with power over you (doctors and medics) who will use this excuse to ferociously abuse your human rights in the name of protecting you from yourself.  I'm not fan of the self-described mental health profession either—they created the system that allows the situation I described in the previous sentence to happen.  Something you should do is take every tiny little thing you love in life and appreciate the hell out of it.  One by one by one they will be taken away from you as the pain takes over your life.  As things get worse, you may well realize that your life is no longer worth living, and that you are suffering for nothing.  What I have learned in the depressing scenario I have described (and lived) is that life is precious and hope is a tremendous bolster against misery.  Somewhere along this timeline, I realized that what I thought was strength of spirit was more like self delusion.  Hope, however, is a very special kind of self delusion in that sometimes it works.  Hang in there.  Hang in there for as long as you can, but don't be bullied into hanging in there for one second longer than necessary."
Fibromyalgia,3andd5,WakeUpDrinkCoffee,2,Sun Jun 21 22:37:11 2015 UTC,"I was recently dx'ed with B12 deficiency -- apparently my levels were in low-normal range for 10 years (that's as far back as my medical records go).   I don't know if there's a connection with fibro as I've been enjoying an extended remission for several years, but I can tell you that now that my B12 is in the 900 range I no longer have ""fibro fog.""    (Not to mention a whole pile of other symptoms -- basically look at a list of B12 deficiency symptoms, and I had every last one).   The so-called ""IBS"" is now also gone, but I think that was more a factor of vitamin D supplementation, which I started a few months in after the B12 shots. Because when I skip a few doses of the vitamin D, the ""IBS"" symptoms come back again (I've been experimenting).   I came very, very close to having permanent nerve damage. I'm still healing from it but doctor thinks I'll make a full recovery in another 3 months.   ""Rosacea"" is also gone. The B12 shots also cleared up the worse episode of psoriasis I have had in my life. No more chest pains, no more SOB. The list goes on and on. Feeling like myself again!

Fibromyalgia,3am7tv,jenocyderose,3,Sun Jun 21 16:30:15 2015 UTC,"Man, you've found such a great place to feel so normal you forget you're the odd-ball-out. I just hit my 14 year anniversary (I'm 21). What kind of advice are you looking for? (Mental coping, physical relaxation, pain management, etc)? I'd suggest doing some digging through older forums, and don't be afraid to really tell us how you're feeling! Nice to meet you, jenocyderose! :)"
Fibromyalgia,3am7tv,justatadtoosmall,2,Sun Jun 21 19:38:31 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, 14 years and you're only 21? That's intense!   Well, mostly mental coping right now, I think. My pain isn't that bad, honestly, it's just the fatigue. If it weren't for that, I could almost be a functioning human being...but as it stands right now, I guess life has other plans for me."
Fibromyalgia,3am7tv,justatadtoosmall,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:57:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, most people truly don't believe my diagnosis age, which is fine with me because I know otherwise haha. Mental coping is the hardest thing to work toward. I'm not sure how much research you've done into Fibro, but many individuals with it also have a secondary diagnosis of depression or bipolar disorder. Something that I've found that does a double-dose of good is yoga and other stretching techniques. I called absolute bologna until I caved and gave it a week in my routine, it hasn't left since. Downward dog has been a lifesaver on those really heavy skull pressure and stress days. You'd be surprised how much of your low days are linked to residual pain that we ""think"" we've gotten used to or blocked. Are there any things that you've tried that have worked/not worked? I live a really active lifestyle, so that really affects how I have to approach my foggy/downtrodden days."
Fibromyalgia,3am7tv,auntiechrist23,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:07:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I definitely have the depression diagnosis too. I actually just scheduled myself to get into counseling again since I am struggling with coping. I try to stay pretty active by going to the gym up to 3x a week (that's all that scheduling will allow.) I have found that staying active, as much as we don't wanna do it, does help quite a bit. But you kinda have to be in a place where your pain is controlled before you can do that. At least that's my experience.   As for things that have worked...diet changes, I'm gluten-free (non celiac), uhh...my family recently started a clean-eating diet as well and that has helped a little. My newest doctor started me on some supplements that were helping until they upset my stomach too much. :( Things that haven't worked...amitryptaline (or however it is spelled)   Tl;dr: helps = staying active, diet changes, current med line up doesn't help = not being active, amitryptaline"

It's been so wonderful for me though...except for the 100 pound in 5 years weight gain...that part hasn't been so good and is why my new doctor is trying to get me off the stuff.

Fibromyalgia,3ah9jd,kiwiburd,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:09:51 2015 UTC,"I had some rx orthopedics about 10 years ago after a knee surgery. I hadn't been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia at that point but the inserts were the bomb. They felt amazing. My knees, back, hips didn't hurt anymore. Honestly, I should probably get some again. As for how to get them, I really don't know. I was a teenager when I got them and my parents dealt with all of it."

I believe you go to a podiatrist or sports medicine doctor. Then they will fit you.

Fibromyalgia,3ah9jd,reverendwrong,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:50:09 2015 UTC,"So here's my $.02. I work at rental car company and am a lift operator at a ski resort in the winters. Insoles are a lifesaver and you don't even need prescription ones. Go get some dr. Scholls and see if they help. I use the heavy duty ones in my work shoes and they work amazingly. I have custom insoles/footbeds in my ski boots because its a high performance situation and my buddy is a boot filter and did it on the cheap, but pre molded ones are better than nothing. So unless you have really messed up feet or joints, and I mean like seriously messed, go for cheap ones first and save yourself some money, but do get them because they really help tons."

I picked up Vibrams to try and replicate that bare foot walking out in places I can't go bare foot.  Well, it turned out helping significantly with low back pain and other pain.  The one thing I would recommend though, is toe socks.  I get mine from Injinji.  They're so comfortable that I really only wear those socks now, even around the house.  The first pair I bought about 4 to 5 years ago.  They're still in outstanding shape, and feel like a second skin now."

Fibromyalgia,3ah2tk,bokbok454,2,Sat Jun 20 03:02:32 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it's my muscles, sometimes it's my joints. I can barely sleep on my stomach any more because my neck is so jacked up. I find weather is what affects my joints the most though."
Fibromyalgia,3ah2tk,Smgth,2,Sat Jun 20 03:58:17 2015 UTC,"have there been changes in the weather where you live? i have found that shifts in humidity causes my fibro pain to increase. with fibro your joints and muscles can all be affected. think about it like this, if your muscle in, say, your thigh is tightened, it's pulling up on your knee cap right? because it's shortening the muscle fibers and this creates more pressure on your joints. this, in turn, can pull on your calves and you can get pain there too.  have you tried light stretches in the mornings or before bed? this can help a lot. i like the bikram poses (http://www.365toawesome.com/wp-content/uploads/26-postures.jpg). some of them require a lot of balance so i skip those :p  everyone is different but it seems pretty typical that fibro pain worsens over the years. mine started in one knee and has spread to my back and hips. a lot of times my hands and elbows will also hurt.   another thing to consider is your bed. is it firm enough? i recently bough a VERY firm bed. it's basically like sleeping on the floor but it's helped considerably with my back pain and therefore my hip pain. maternity pillows (the giant u shaped body pillows) are also good for knee support when sleeping on your side.   topical creams and patches can also help. there's biofreeze, bengay, icyhot, salonpas patches. these are basically counterirritants so they produce a really cold or warming sensation that masks the pain. so they don't really relax your muscles, you would have to get a RX for a muscle relaxant :/  sorry to hear you have been having so much trouble lately. but remember fibro has its ups and downs. and hopefully your ups come soon."
Fibromyalgia,3ah2tk,kiwiburd,2,Sat Jun 20 04:17:40 2015 UTC,"I have zero joint pain.  All of my pain is in the soft tissues surrounding the joints.  If you have pain in the joints themselves then you need to see a rheumatologist to rule out arthritis.  At least one of your joints should be checked using a CT scan.  If you get fibro one year, it doesn't give you immunity to getting arthritis the next year.  If you get a new symptom then you need to get it checked.  It might be a new fibro symptom but it might be something else.  If it is something else the fibro will make it feel much worse."
Fibromyalgia,3ah2tk,FibroMan,2,Sat Jun 20 06:45:31 2015 UTC,"Fibro is connective tissue as well as muscles, and there's a lot of connective stuff like tendons and ligaments in your joints. There are also tender points around joints like the hips, elbows and knees. If you start getting inflammation, it could be something else."
Fibromyalgia,3ah2tk,sangvine,2,Sat Jun 20 06:46:55 2015 UTC,"My long term joint pain was what helped get the referral to the rheumatologist who diagnosed my fibro. It's only in the last few years that I've had regular muscle pains as well.  I find the weather has a big impact on what hurts.  But like the others have said, if this is a new thing for you then get it checked out. Don't be afraid to insist on tests for things like RA if you've not had them already. A lot of us have other conditions that take forever to get officially diagnosed because once you've got the fibro label on your medical records a depressing number of medical professionals will blame every thing on that."

Fibromyalgia,3ad47z,mompof,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:59:16 2015 UTC,As a woman whose fibro pain is directly linked to her cycle I wouldn't be surprised to find severity of fibro having to do with hormones in either sex. I've actually just started using progesterone cream and it seems to be helping in the short amount of time I've been using it (the idea being that unopposed estrogen is the source of problems.)
Fibromyalgia,3ad47z,WeeMiniMoose,2,Sat Jun 20 04:08:04 2015 UTC,"I'm seeing a gyneacologist atm to try and get my cycle sorted out and she's convinced that hormone levels play a big part in fibro.   For example, she's pretty sure that the mirena coil (hormonal coil rather than old style copper one) would sort my cycle problems, but wants to try everything else first because EVERY fibro patient she and her colleagues have fitted with that type of coil had had a sudden and drastic worsening of their fibro, which has taken them months to recover from even once the coil was removed again.  She's also seen a marked improvement in her fibro patients while they're pregnant, several have described it to her as feeling like their old selves for the first time in years. However they have all had a massive flare post-partum so she doesn't recommend pregnancy as a fibro treatment ;)  Given I picked her at random from the short list my insurance company have me of gynea consultants in my area that they have registered I really lucked out :)"
Fibromyalgia,3ad47z,dravenxiv,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:40:05 2015 UTC,"Wow, my fibro started shortly after getting my Mirena IUD (the insertion of which was the single most painful thing that has EVER happened to me BTW,) which I got because birth control pills were giving me horrific migraines.   That's awesome that your gyno is exploring the hormonal component; I mentioned it to my doctor and she just said it was interesting. I've been religiously tracking my cycle with an app for almost a year, and it's very apparent that at least 95% of my flares are completely linked up with my cycle.   At this point, it's so bad that I'm almost guaranteed that I can barely leave my house 2 weeks out of every month (the week before my period and the week during.) I just started using progesterone cream and this month has been the best month in a long time, so I'm hoping that it wasn't a fluke and the cream is helping balance the estrogen.  I should get the iud removed, but I'm terrified to as the insertion was so painful, and I can't use any other form of hormonal birth control because of migraines. I need to go make the hubby get his tubes tied."

Fibromyalgia,3acrop,Bomacy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:00:56 2015 UTC,the coupon card doesn't ensure that your copay is $5. the fine print on it reads a max benefit of $50 off. your doctor may have to fill out a prior authorization and then it may be covered by your insurance. i work in a pharmacy and a lot of insurances DO pay for it.  ritalin has a lot of GI side effects like diarrhea. and long term use of stimulants can also have some cardio side effects. ritalin is one of the older stimulants and has generally fallen out of favor due to its side effects profile.

Fibromyalgia,3a8vdc,asdf3141592,3,Thu Jun 18 03:44:58 2015 UTC,"My story is very similar to yours - I was diagnosed at about the same age after years of fuckaround, few people took me seriously, most thought I was just lazy/a hypochondriac/complaining, and even my parents didn't really want to accept that I might actually be in such poor condition. Uni was hard and exhausting but I struggled to justify taking it slowly. My girlfriend at the time was supportive but also visibly dubious.  It isn't exactly easy, but eventually you have to come to terms with the fact that, to everybody else who doesn't know anything about your condition, you don't look sick and your symptoms sound like you've just had a hectic weekend. It is necessary to acknowledge and come to terms with this; most people don't understand, can't understand, or won't try to understand. Seeking sympathy from these people is tiring and degrading.  Your best bet is to concentrate on yourself. Instead of seeking validation, concern, or advice from others, start fighting for yourself. Do everything you can to improve your condition. Make an effort to learn all you can. Do research. Pick the brains of every specialist and doctor you meet. Empower yourself with knowledge, make changes to lifestyle, diet, habits. Do things at your own pace - uni included (I myself have found that I can manage a 3/4 work load, but a full workload is too much). Become conscious of your limits and avoid exceeding them to avoid flare ups. Respect and love your body; become your own best friend. Never give in to despair; always move forward... or simply rest, when you're tired.  When people see that you are really doing everything you can to fix something that's wrong, and that you really know your shit, they stop questioning whether you actually have a problem or not. Nobody can put that amount of effort in for a problem that doesn't exist.   And don't forget, we're always here for you.  Thread theme:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYzMYcUty6s"

I went to college late, and was diagnosed with fibro during my first year, and had to drop back to part time because of it.  While I was attending college I had time out for pain clinics, chiropractors, acupuncture, I was stoned on medication half the time, had neurologists, and other specialist stuff going on too.  I really didn't think I could make it through, and I thought of quitting every day.  That was 14 years ago.  I got my degree, and have been teaching for 10 years now.  It wasn't easy, but I did it.  I just got through each day one at a time, and did the best I could at the time.  I did have to come to terms with the odd lower grade but I passed, and so can you.  I think you need to change your living circumstances to something that is more supportive of what you need.  You can either share information such as the 'spoon theory' and work on your housemates, or move to somewhere else.  The main thing is also try to be as stress free as possible because stress (even good stress) will make your symptoms worse.  If you need someone to talk to feel free to PM me.  I'm happy to have someone to vent away with :)"

The thought of 8:00 am classes makes me cringe.  If you are going to study at university then it needs to fit in with your lifestyle.  You can't force your fibro lifestyle to fit in with uni.  I can't change what other people think of you, but we know you aren't just being lazy.  If anything you are pushing yourself too hard which is making things worse.  Don't worry about failing a university subject.  If you can get your lifestyle right I am sure you can pass future classes.  Uni isn't like high school where passing is practically guaranteed.  If you fail an assignment or an exam, look at why you failed and you change your approach next time."
Fibromyalgia,3a8vdc,FibroMan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:44:55 2015 UTC,"The best you can do is make it clear to them how the disease works.  There's a defect in your brain that makes it so that it doesn't get delta wave sleep on its own, meaning your muscles don't regenerate properly and the brain doesn't maintain itself like it should. Once it's something specific that they can understand people tend to be more accepting than of something they see as a vague mystery illness."

Make sure that you will still be able to wake up from an alarm clock though.  Now you know not to take an 8 am class. We live and we learn.  Can you spend a few days at your boyfriends house to get caught up on sleep? Can you afford to find a nice hotel and spend the weekend there sleeping and getting caught up on homework?  There are at times where our pain is so severe that nothing seems to keep you going. But then there are times where your pain is nonexistent and you feel on top of the world. If you can figure out what irritates your body and what helps your body you can help keep flare ups away or at least minimal."

Fibromyalgia,3a8h59,kittysparkles85,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:43:36 2015 UTC,"I've just started coming to terms with it about a year ago.  Even then, I still have trouble accepting it.  When it first started for me, I was active duty Air Force.  Pain started for me in early 2006.  The doctors had no clue what was going on.  They don't usually deal with chronic pain.  At the same time, I had some low back issues.  Guess what everyone concentrated on.  By mid 2007, I was being put out for medical.  I was sent to mental health 2 to 3 times, as doctors kept telling me it was in my head.  Each time mental health said no.  It took fighting to get the VA to give me a proper disability percentage.  During which time, my pay went from 1750 every two weeks, to 1100 a month.  That wasn't even enough for our mortgage.  We also had 3 kids at the time.  A newborn, a just over 1 year old and a 3 year old.  We ended up losing our home and having to move in with my parents folks, who already had 4 in the home.  We also had to file for ch 7.  Around the time that was done, the VA finally fixed my rating.  I still had no answers though.  I didn't get a diagnosis until 2012.  Meanwhile, I had to deal with mother in law treating me like I was faking.  Luckily, my wife stood up for me.  She still has issues with me, but a lot of that went away with a diagnosis.  Now, we're much better off.  We recovered from the financial woes after the VA fixed my rating and I filed for SSDI.  We are in our own home as well.  The deep depression I struggled through is for the most part under control.  I still have a lot of issues with pain, and things are not getting better on that front.  I have learned to work around it though, so I can get things done around the house and do some other harder odds and ends here and there when I feel up to it.  Things will get better.  It may take some time, and you may not immediately see the light at the end of the tunnel.  Rest assured though, it is going to be there.  You may not be pain free when you reach it, unfortunately, but pain really is only 1 aspect we have to deal with.  You will be a much stronger person at the end of it.  The experience has profoundly changed me and changed the way I see things.  There are tons of tips on here about how to minimize pain, and what you can do to be active.  Keeping active, as best you can, is really a big key in dealing with it.  You not only feel better physically, even if it is temporary, but you feel better about yourself.  There may even be support groups in your area to help you deal with it and have people to do activities with."
Fibromyalgia,3a8h59,Geawiel,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:45:55 2015 UTC,"I've been there, I think that is the worse type of flare, the ones that leave you in shattered pieces.  The pain I have right now, it's different, it's hard pain. It's i wish I could blow away in the wind in pieces because then maybe the pain would be less, it is trapped with no way out right now.  It's so fucking hard.....but pain cycles can last short or long times, even years. When you drop out of a major flare cycle though, find your happy place and stay there. The next time pain cycle hits, it will be more mentally manageable."

No. I'm still dealing with this crap condition day in and day out. Tired, pain, tired of adhering to the small effing strict regimen that's the only thing that works, but tired of it and slipping. And now I'm having more pain of course, but it's so much work to get back on track. It's like we have walk 5,000 miles before anyone ""healthy"" actually gets up in the morning. People with Fibro have it really hard and if anyone else tries to tell you otherwise screw them, karma b**ch.

I haven't had work in years and have the hardest time finding even piece work to do.  The pain and exhaustion only ever get worse.  Five years in—surprise!  An exciting new symptom, nausea!  Now I am nauseous a lot and my bowels go crazy.  I have spent much of this week on the toilet.  I reached a tipping point somewhere in the last two years where I just couldn't keep up with the simplest things like cleaning the house or cooking.  I derive no joy from any of the activities that I used to love.  I have recently begun reaching out to friends to find someone to help me die when I cannot stand the pain anymore.  Nothing will demonstrate more thoroughly how shit your friends are than asking them for a little compassion.  I am very sorry to hear you are in pieces.  So am I.  It only ever gets worse.

Fibromyalgia,3a6x52,phillthyphill,2,Wed Jun 17 18:28:47 2015 UTC,"First of all, thanks for stopping by! You're not the first to do this, and seeing/dating/etc. someone with a chronic illness presents its own set of challenges, but the payout is just as unique and enjoyable if you communicate. If you're not one of those guys right now, work on it. Maybe someone here will have a good book/blog recommendation on this topic?  1) Pain happens. Usually constant. Can go from a 4 to an 8 pretty quickly if I'm having a bad day. No reason needed. It's dumb and doesn't make any sense. But if you accept that random pain happens and there may be certain things that make pain happen, then you should be alright. Ask her what sets her pain off. Sometimes it's walking, sometimes it's a hug or physical contact. Your goal is to build trust there.   2) There are some great 1-10 pain scales here if you sort this sub's post by ""Top all-time."" Also check out r/chronicpain's top posts for similar materials. The 1-10 pain scale sucks because it's not really linear and everyone has different perceptions of what the numbers mean. If there's a description alongside the number, you will be able to receive more accurate information about her pain. For example, I didn't realize I was undershooting my pain on the 1-10 scale by four points most days.  3) Again, trust and communication. Be a bit vulnerable yourself; tell her what you like and ask, are you comfortable trying? If not, maybe there are modified positions you can try. Searching on this sub, along with r/chronicpain and r/disability, will give you some info on what modified positions are more likely to work and be the most pleasurable for both partners. Remember, she probably wants to please you, too. I've had partners that want to make it all about me which is cool, but I want in on it as well! Sometimes I'm willing to do a bit more, sometimes I'm not. Either way, my partner is cool with it and understands. He will occasionally check in with ""Is this painful?"" I tell him yes or no and we go from there.   4) As for social gatherings, show up a little late and leave a little early. Maybe establish a sign between the two of you, whether it's a word or text or signal, that she's ready to leave. Maybe also an emergency sign just in case her body decides to have a mutiny (it happens). Don't be afraid to make sure she gets what she needs, but learn when it's appropriate for her to do it first or if you need to intervene and make sure she's most comfortable. For example, I'm sitting in an airport right now and I had to wait over twenty minutes for a wheelchair to my next gate. It would have been really nice to have had someone to get pissy with the courier folks, someone that isn't fatigued and foggy and hurting.  I hope some of this help you on your journey. You're an angel for wanting to delve into dating someone with a disability. Trust and communication, and comfort are key. Find ways to communicate with her in social circles so she feels empowered to tell you if she needs something. If she uses a cane and drops it (as I frequently do), just pick it up, give it back, and act like it didn't even happen. After all, you're dating her, not her fibro. It's just a package deal. Good luck!"

Fibromyalgia,3a6x52,muinamir,3,Wed Jun 24 18:30:23 2015 UTC,"You already got some great advice, I just wanted to add that she may be hesitant right now to talk about pain and limits because her default is to not trust people with that information. Pride factors into it, but also some of us have gotten burned before divulging information about our condition to others. Everyone's fibro is different, and her pain levels and symptoms can differ from day to day. It is, ultimately, up to her to communicate those things to you, because it can be very hard to tell from the outside, and flareups can come on suddenly. So for now it's important to develop a general foundation of trust and reliability, and develop a habit of communicating clearly in other areas, so that she knows you've got her back."

I took the self help intro online course at http://cfidsselfhelp.org/ and will soon be taking the course on pacing. Still, what I've learned so far has really helped. The program they have is for both fibro and chronic fatigue. I wish I'd found it sooner.  They key is, do less than you think you can to avoid the push/crash thing that's SO annoying. Start logging everything because it can help you figure out what's going to work better for you. You might also look into Hatha or Yin Yoga, and Tai Chi for alternate forms of exercise. And good luck :)"

I have practiced yoga on and off for a while but not lately (outside of some basic poses incorporated into my nightly stretching routine).   I'll definitely take a look at the link you provided. For me, that mental hurdle of getting up and moving through the pain and fatigue is much more difficult than the exercises themselves. Thanks again!"
Fibromyalgia,3a5pi3,spicypineapple,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:33:23 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! I found that link and some other really great advice over in r/cfs. I was diagnosed with fibro first, last August. Then Sjogren's, an autoimmune disease, in September. I couldn't figure out how to manage the fatigue but did the best I could until this past February when I kinda crashed hard and was diagnosed with CFS. So, I guess I didn't figure it out, but I also didn't think I was pushing myself. I thought I was modifying and listening to my body. Turns out, by not stopping sooner than I thought I needed to, I was overdoing it.   I'm now on medical leave from work and trying hard to figure out the whole pacing thing. For me, the cognitive impairment from fatigue is the worst. If I'm too fatigued, I can't drive and it's affected my independence. And I hate that.  14 months ago, I was getting up at 5am to go do deep water aerobics before work 4-5 days a week, working all day, going out some evenings and weekends. Now, I use a timer to help me keep track of how long I've been active or how long I need to rest. It's frustrating to be so limited, but I am hopeful that if I keep trying, I will be able to improve. And get back to work before my STD is up.   I'm not trying to scare you, by any means, but I really wish someone had told me it was worth the $40 to take the CFIDS self help course before I was so bad off. I've learned more from them and their website, than from any of my doctors. And they're non-profit. Much of their information is free in the online library. The volunteer that facilitated the course I took had fibro while others have CFS or both. Those taking the course were moderately active to bedridden.   If you enjoy walking but a mile really wears you out, do a half mile or even less. Or do a quarter mile 2-4 times during the day instead of all at once. Breaking those activities up into little pieces seems inefficient, but I've found it's the key to improvement. Baby steps can be so frustrating, but they're sure better than going backwards with each crash.   I wish you well."

Fibromyalgia,3a5pi3,PeacefulTreeLand,2,Thu Jun 18 10:49:29 2015 UTC,"To help with the mental hurdle of starting up activity again, I started to garden. It sounds silly, but it is really a huge undertaking. When you start seeds you need to keep them moist, spray them with water 1-2x a day. To prevent dry out and seedling death, you need to try and be regular on timing. You need to check often and observe to prevent death. This is naturally putting you on a routine of getting up at the same time each day and walking the same path. Go look at seedlings, need water, walk to sink, get spray bottle and walk back. After 7-14 days of this you will have a good rhythm going. If you kill the first batch, just start over.  Meanwhile as you start to feel the rhythm of work again you will hopefully start to get urges to work more. Start to focus on where your seedlings will go. Maybe you need to clear a small yard patch. Maybe you need to go find some pots and get some dirt. If you started with seedlings in pots then start to figure how how to display them, move a shelf around, ect. Start slowly and be careful with lifting.  Soon it is time to transfer the seedlings after 4-6 weeks. If you planted flowers, you can now give up gardening and enjoy the flowers and rhythm it brought you. If you did veggies, then you have a rhythm going for the whole summer.  At the same time they are just plants and you can plant extra so if you kill some, no big deal."

(Which makes me feel like they just don't want to deal with me, and ordering tests etc and that they want me out of their hair. I'm just a kid looking for drugs to get high off of, right?) I'll always know that it isn't fibro, it's something different. Mine is getting worse by the year. This time last year I was working in my trade, just graduated and feeding 500 people a day.  Now I can barely get up or lay down without being in pain, I feel nauseous most days and when I don't I've got a headache or a migraine. One of my symptoms that I've had for a long time is getting worse very quickly (presyncope + vertigo). The best part of it?  My doctors don't want to give me any medications for pain beyond extra strength tylenol or any of those other pain medications you can buy over the counter, because it ""won't benefit me"" or ""because you're young"". My FD is good about it, he's new for me so I'm not going to badger him to give me drugs. I've coped this long. My only medication is nortriptyline and my dosage just went up last week, but now it's only making me incredibly tired, instead of what it's intended for.  Some other reasoning for not wanting to get on some Molotov cocktail of drugs is because 1) I can't afford them all 2) I'd like to focus on my (just barely bearable) symptoms and try to find what's really affecting me.   Ugh that turned out way more rant-y than I intended but I guess I do know what you mean. It's frustrating and I find myself crying about it a lot. That there's something more wrong with me and no one wants to help me."
Fibromyalgia,3a0fob,SweetContext,2,Tue Jun 16 22:33:32 2015 UTC,"I can understand the bit about being hesitant on prescribing tougher pain meds. People in our position can easily get to a place where we are using heavy narcotics that lose effectiveness as time goes by while our symptoms don't change. One of the best analogies I've heard about it is that pain meds make you forget that your leg is broken but once you're off and dealing with those consequences... well, your leg's still crippled and nothing's really changed. In fact, things have gotten worse.   At the same time, pain meds may allow you to make certain strides in a recovery plan where your symptoms in general are managed better by the time you wean yourself off the pain killers. It's really hit or miss. In my experience I've had doctors a little too eager to prescribe intense amounts of addictive pain medication, and both extremes (refusal to prescribe and eagerness to prescribe) are slippery slopes in how we treat our conditions. Even if fibromyalgia is actually what's causing all the symptoms, managing pain on a short-term basis as you get your ducks in a row medically speaking is still something that should be heavily considered by a medical practitioner.  I'm preaching to the choir on that one, though, as I'm sure you've considered the legitimacy and unfairness of that situation over and over again.   I'm actually waiting on a pain clinic right now to discuss the feasibility of a TENS Unit because it's not addictive and relatively safe without the use of drugs. Maybe that's something you could look into? They're pretty obscure and, to be honest, they do come across a little like pseudo-science but there have been some studies done on it and the machines are cheap if you can get a doctor to work with you on a proper intensity setting. It's definitely not something you should fiddle with yourself. It's not a solution and it's very much marketed as a pain suppressant rather than a pain reliever, but we often don't have much of a choice in these things."
Fibromyalgia,3a0fob,FibroMan,3,Wed Jun 17 06:40:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on the benefits of using pain killers on a ""short-term"" basis.  I have been on codeine or tramadol for a year and a half now, and I have started tapering off tramadol.  For me, the ""short-term"" benefit of one and a half years has given me time to make long term lifestyle changes so that I don't need the painkillers anymore.  To further the broken leg analogy, the best long term treatment for a broken leg is to continue to exercise it.  If your doctor told you to go away and exercise your broken leg you would probably file a complaint once you had stopped swearing at him, because you might have been expecting a splint or a cast as an important short term treatment.  Whenever a new fibro patient sees a doctor they are told to go without painkillers, because that is the best long term treatment, with no regard for what the best short term treatment is.   I'm actually waiting on a pain clinic right now to discuss the feasibility of a TENS Unit   Can't you buy them for about $100 to $200?  Why do you need to go to a pain clinic for it?  I wouldn't call a TENS unit pseudo-science.  It is more of a little trick that works on your nerves to reduce pain perception.  As with every treatment for fibro, it doesn't work on everyone and the ""improvement"" can't be quantified.  I haven't tried one yet because I am skeptical about it making much difference.  Let us know how it goes for you."
Fibromyalgia,3a0fob,SweetContext,2,Wed Jun 17 11:25:10 2015 UTC,"My primary physician has been hesitant to prescribe anything because I have so many specialists (internist, investigative internist, rheumatologist, urologist, occupational therapist, psychiatrist, Complex Chronic Disease Program). She doesn't specialize in fibro/invisible diseases and since my case is unique she doesn't want to become a doctor who essentially throws a dart at a sheet of paper and hopes it lands on something good. She's mostly focused on just coordinating everything and helping me come to a decision on some of the options that have been presented to me by the other doctors I've been seeing.  Along with my immunity to opiates, she decided that it'd probably be best if I work with doctors who specialize in the management of pain rather than trying to guess at it myself. I had an appointment with a private pain specialist a couple months ago but that doctor redirected my referral to a medical program instead, so now I'm waiting on a public pain clinic to see what my choices are for specifically pain management, TENS Unit being one of the non-drug options.   I agree that it's not necessarily pseudo-science, but it's new enough that a lot of doctors raise an eyebrow about it. Its use for fibromyalgia or other chronic pain related conditions is limited. Like you've said, it can't be quantified even if it does work. It's something worth trying, though, which is what I'm hoping my eventual pain specialist will believe as well. A unit is cheap but there are clinics out there that have a machine you can use on-site for a significantly cheaper price (or possibly even covered under benefits since it's at a pain clinic), so I'm hoping to find out if it even works before I look into saving up for my own machine."
Fibromyalgia,3a0fob,SweetContext,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:27:55 2015 UTC,"True. I'm kind of thankful because I'm not very good at taking pills, at all. So I'm glad to only be on the one I am now. My pain clinic doctors are... what most would say ""find another doctor!"". They can be really stubborn and are certain that their one method of physiotherapy will help me manage my life. But it hasn't, in fact physio has only made things worse, and I've told them. My only choice is to keep up with it and see if things change while I search and try to find out something behind the symptoms I present, because I can't afford any other methods of treatment.   I also (just remembered) know that I'm iffy with heavy pain medications anyway, if not dosed for me properly. I almost OD'd on codeine when I had my wisdom teeth removed, even though I was following their dosage, of ""1 tablet every 6 hours"". In two days I was in the hospital. It was not a fun time.  Sometimes I just don't know what to do except lay down and accept my not great life."
Fibromyalgia,3a0fob,Tuckr13,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:26:13 2015 UTC,"Reduced tolerance is probably better than heightened tolerance when it comes to pain medication since it'd be easier to work with a particular drug without needing to worry about a tolerance build-up as early as some people might. The dangers, as you've pointed out, are very real if you're in that position given that some doctors will start off the bat with a high dose because of the pain you're experiencing.   How did you get physio? Which specialist signed off on that? Could a rheumatologist make a physio request? I've been poking at the idea a bit in recent months because the normal recommendation of ""just be as active as possible every day"" isn't doing anything and hasn't resulted in any improvement (even just in capability) in over 7 months now. One of the biggest obstacles for me is that physio clinics are a bit of a distance away and there needs to be a ""good reason"" for it if I hope for my benefits to cover the cost. Have you been paying out of pocket for the visits?   I hear you on the troubles taking pills front. My tongue doesn't cooperate with swallowing unless I chew which is a nightmare for a lot of medications, especially the ones that you need to keep intact until its in your stomach. The idea of needing to take a cocktail of drugs every single day for the rest of my life is definitely not an endearing thought!"
Fibromyalgia,3a0fob,EsotericKnowledge,2,Wed Jun 17 16:21:13 2015 UTC,"I don't even know my pain tolerance anymore. I sit awake crying at night confused if it's all in my head or that I'm just so used to the pain that my mind has basically blocked anything out that isn't a migraine, or weather system related pain. I feel so mental sometimes. (and now that I re-read that I realize you're talking about my codeine god my memory is so zapped) But yes, it's better to have reduced I guess. I always have to tell my doctors now that I need to start on an even lower dose than the ""regular low"" because I don't know how tolerant I will be to it.   I went to my previous FD to check up on what my rheumatologist had sent to her for possible treatments. My FD then referred me to a pain clinic about 20 minutes away from me. They have physio, and epidural treatments as their ""specialties"" or go-to treatments, but they treat each patient differently. Theoretically though I think a rhematologist could make the request.   Our pain clinic is usually booked up but they try to get people like me (can be treated and back to work quickly) in and out first. I'd suggest talking to your FD or Rheum about other things as well since you say they're quite far away. My physio is only on Wednesdays every couple of weeks. My pain clinic is free, for me at least, but I'm not going to ask questions about that. That's the only reason I don't try other treatments, because I can't afford them.  I used to choke on even the smallest of pills when I was younger and that was a huge mental hurdle to get over. I can only take one pill at a time now but I can only take pills about the size of a tylenol/advil and my nortriptyline is about the length from the tip of my pinky to the first knuckle. It really isn't! I'd spend half an hour trying to take pills!"

My fibro diagnosis seems to be standing in the way of anyone finding what's really wrong with me. I was at the Rheumatologist yesterday, and she's like ""oh, yeah, that flexibility of your joints is called ehlers-danlos syndrome."" / ""Those pains in your diaphragm are costochondritis - the cartilage between your ribs is inflamed."" / ""your hip pain is trochanteric bursitis."" / ""Oh yeah, your hand is experiencing tenosynovitis...""

Out of curiosity, is that something you can ask your primary physician to add to your chart?

It's called glycopyrrolate.  Only downside is that saliva is on the same 'circuit', so you tend to want to keep drinking water while it's in your system to fix the dry mouth.  The actual cause of the increased sweating is the increased serotonin telling the body to trigger sweating.  The body re-uses many chemicals for different things, unfortunately."

Plus I sweat more than usual in general. The worst thing for me (idk of its from Cymbalta or not) is one part of my body will be sweating and another part is an icicle.

Sleep apnea is a common issue, but many people with fibro get what is called alpha wave intrusion, which is defined as ""bursts of awake-like activity during stage 4 sleep"". Stage 4 sleep is the most important stage where muscles are rebuilt and a whole shitstorm of necessary hormones get released.   I remember reading a study of fibro patients a while back that said that while healthy patients spent an average of 20% of their sleep in stage 4 sleep, the fibro patients were under 5%. This is why you sleep for 12 hours and feel just as tired as when you went to bed. There isn't any real treatment for it that I know of that can be administered at home.

I have recently found that when I am really fatigued (recently spent 2 months in bed) that it is caused by a dopamine deficiency. So not only was I fatigued, I had cold hands and feet, muscle pain and a general lack of motivation (which I put down to feeling so awful I just didn't want to get up and do anything that had led to a lack of stamina).  I have these episodes once or twice a year, and usually for weeks at a time.  My neurologist put me on amantadine and 3 weeks later I woke up one day feeling the tiniest bit hopeful and with a tiny flicker of energy. It has slowly built up since then. I am still not 100% but I am sure I am back heading towards what is normal for me.   Still it might just be the normal progress of a flair for me and not the amantadine. I'll be going for tests next week to see if dopamine levels are up/at normal rates."
Fibromyalgia,39ord3,phthophth,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:17:46 2015 UTC,"I'd be interested to hear about your test results.  I have super cold feet too and definitely a lack of motivation, but I don't know if that is caused by the fatigue or the other way around."
Fibromyalgia,39oats,Nillithwen,16,Sat Jun 13 05:03:57 2015 UTC,"Your physio is right, fibromyalgia does NOT cause inflammation.  Fibromyalgia is not the cause of ANY abnormal blood tests.  You need a new doctor, and you might consider lodging a complaint."
Fibromyalgia,39oats,FibroMan,5,Sat Jun 13 05:17:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I will for sure be asking some SERIOUS questions. Perhaps she is assuming my inflammation is coming from other health problems and isn't communicating that correctly, considering I have chronic sinus issues as well as asthma and IBS"
Fibromyalgia,39oats,Law_Student,7,Sat Jun 13 05:24:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, IBS is a huge inflammation thing, that would definitely make a mark on bloodwork.  The problem with fibromyalgia and doctors is that knowledge of the illness was at first wildly off base and evolved quickly over several decades.  Doctors that last heard something about it 20 years ago believe things that are completely wrong.  They're obligated by their professional license to keep up to date in order to not engage in malpractice, but many don't bother.  It's too much trouble on top of everything else that demands their time.  Do they deserve an ethics complaint as a wake up call?  Quite possibly.  If you want instructions on how to make one in your state I can help."
Fibromyalgia,39oats,Law_Student,3,Sat Jun 13 05:43:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that input. I am going to ask her point blank if she thinks fibro causes inflammation. Although she never said it point blank so maybe I interpreted her wrong, thinking that her not being worried about my inflammation levels meant that it was my fibro ya know? If she does answer my question with the ""fibro causes inflammation"" then we will have big problems and a new doctor"
Fibromyalgia,39oats,Law_Student,3,Sat Jun 13 05:48:31 2015 UTC,"The important thing is you've got the medicine and care you need, especially one of the meds that help with the delta wave sleep defect."
Fibromyalgia,39oats,MomG48,2,Sat Jun 13 07:53:22 2015 UTC,I knew fibro caused sleep problems but I didn't know it was something that specific. Could you elaborate on that? And do you know which medications are best at treating that?
Fibromyalgia,39oats,Law_Student,7,Sat Jun 13 08:00:18 2015 UTC,"Sure, it's the thing everyone with fibro needs to know.  If a fibro patient has a sleep study they'll find the brain going into alpha wave sleep normally, then starting on delta before reverting back to alpha in an endless loop until it eventually skips to the later stages without getting any proper delta.  This is a big problem because a few important things happen in delta wave sleep.  One of them is the regeneration of all the little tears that muscles get during the day.  You can imagine the effects of years of tears adding up not healing at anything like the rate they should.  This probably causes most of the illness's pain and exhaustion.   The other stuff that happens in delta wave sleep involves brain housekeeping and maintenance, which probably explains the sometimes severe cognitive disruptions.  If you deliberately keep a healthy person from getting delta wave sleep for a few days they actually develop fibro symptoms.  All this was discovered back in 1975 but we're still trying to get regular physicians clued in.  There are four-ish drugs that treat it.  They're not perfect, but they help.  The two I've tried are a muscle relaxant called cyclobenzaprine (it's a much lower dose than the dose taken for the muscle relaxant use, fortunately) and an anti-epileptic called gabapentin.  There are also two drugs in the tricyclic antidepressant family that have been known to work, I believe one of them was amitriptyline.    Gabapentin is probably the best option, it's very very safe, next to impossible to overdose on.  (The dangerous dose is something in the vicinity of several bottles of pills at once.)  It's also generally well tolerated without any common serious side effects, and it's not addictive in any way.  And it's cheap.  The one thing to know about it is that your stomach can only absorb about 900mg at once, after that it runs out of available receptors.  If you want to experiment with doses higher than that (I find them helpful) you can do so by waiting an hour or two and taking more.  With any of them what you'll do is take it right before you fall asleep.  Unless you find a time release version (I don't if any exist for these drugs) you'll probably notice that you get good sleep for maybe six hours and then you start getting sleep disrupted again as the drug wears off.  You'll want to set an alarm to wake yourself up after the appropriate amount of time to take another dose before rolling over and going back to sleep.  (It's a pain, I know, but you get used to it after a while.  I have to do it anyway because my pain medication also wears off at roughly the same interval, so it's not really any extra annoyance.)  If you don't take the second dose you may find yourself getting sixish hours of good sleep and then sleeping four to eight hours more as your brain keeps looping through alpha over and over again trying to get enough delta sleep but never does.  The being stuck in alpha is why the tossing and turning thing happens, by the way.  Alpha stage sleep is semi-awake enough that people are somewhat consciously aware and tend to move around a lot.  Though they may not always form memories of it.  Gabapentin taken during the day can have some benefit as a neuropathic pain killer, but I find it fairly subtle.  Your mileage may vary.  One last tip with the gabapentin, make sure you get the capsules prescribed and not the tablets.  The stuff tastes pretty spectacularly awful in a chemical-ey sort of way, you don't want to have to gag every time you have to take it.  With the drugs you'll likely find yourself much, much better than you are without.  The amount of improvement does depend on how bad a fibro case you have, you'll probably see more improvement the worse you are, relatively speaking.  I noticed the difference after just the first night back when I started around eleven years ago.  I have an unusually bad case and am still physically unable to do much of anything, but I'm in a lot less pain than I would be and my cognitive disruptions are maybe 80% or 90% gone compared to what they were.  (Which was so confused I couldn't add single digit numbers like 5 + 7, and I'd sometimes walk between two rooms of my apartment literally unable to find the door to the third for an hour or more.  Now it's mostly just forgetting words several times a conversation.)  Any questions or other stuff you want info on?"
Fibromyalgia,39oats,DjGhettoSteve,2,Sat Jun 13 12:03:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you for that thorough explanation of Gabapentin. I am taking that because I cannot afford Lyrica.  It helps, and it is a lot more affordable.  To OP, fibromyalgia is not inflammatory, there is something else going on to explain the bloodwork. The other commenters are right; find another doctor."
Fibromyalgia,39oats,Law_Student,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:34:35 2015 UTC,Wow are you a medical professional?! That information was incredibly helpful. I've not read it anywhere else.  Next time I see my doctor I'll ask about that gabapentin. Hopefully it will work well for me considering I've got fibro that's about an 8/10 severity.  I'm also on flexeril (the other drug you mentioned) but it's doesn't help all that much.  Does it make a difference that I'm being treated for moderate/severe sleep apnea? I use a CPAP machine every night all night and just got re tested this year so my pressure setting is good.
Fibromyalgia,39oats,DjGhettoSteve,3,Sat Jun 13 15:09:20 2015 UTC,"Have you tried the flexeril right before bed?    Sleep apnea can cause sleep disruptions that might make the fibro worse, or even cause fibro symptoms in someone if it was bad enough.  Since you have a machine I'm guessing you're probably not too badly off though.  I'm not a medical professional, but thank you for the complement.  I just got really really really sick when I was about 19 and read my way through the university medical school library doing my own differential to figure out what the heck was wrong so I could know what specialist to go to, after my primary care wasn't too helpful.  I had fourish functional hours a day then, but I devoted them to reading as much as I could and managed to be pretty exhaustive over the course of a summer.    I try to keep up on the research still.  There's usually one to three interesting papers a year or thereabouts.  It's a funny story actually, when I info dumped the rheumatologist I found who specialized in juvenile fibro he was so impressed with me quoting standard test thresholds off the top of my head that he suggested I go to medical school.  I'm way too sick though, I'd never make it.  One of many doors closed to me because of the bad luck of getting sick.  Edit - Oh, something else that occurred to me.  Make sure you're medicated for any pain you have while you sleep.  I used to think that it was OK if my pain meds wore off because I wasn't conscious so I wouldn't feel it, but it turns out I was very wrong.  The pain disrupts sleep by waking you up, even if it's just partially.  It also tends to cause dreadful dreams as your brain comes up with scenarios to explain the pain.  I dream I'm on fire or being tortured, it's icky."
Fibromyalgia,39oats,Davryanna,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:37:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah with my CPAP machine I have usually zero apneas so that's good.  Sounds like you've been through the ringer. Good on you for doing all that research.  I never thought about pain being an issue after I fell asleep. That's an excellent point. I do take 10mg of flexeril every night and I'm using cymbalta for my nerve pain and ""pain mess"" for really bad days, but I'll keep that nugget of wisdom in mind.  And yeah those dreams are really freaky. I punched myself in my sleep once and my brain gave me the strangest dream to try and explain it hahaha."
Fibromyalgia,39oats,MsStorm,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:31:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure where you're getting your info on gabapentin. What you list there is a far cry from my experience. My wife developed Parkinson's like tremors that took months to go away after she stopped taking the drug & both of us (and her sister) experienced horrific vomiting/diarrhea while on it. I had nocturnal seizures after a while & eventually got my insurance to cover lyrica. While these aren't necessarily deadly side effects, they aren't something to gloss over either. If the med works, more power to you, but be careful not to make it sound like there's zero downside. There are always side effects, reactions, etc. Even cannabis isn't without side effects, though those are generally things like sleepiness, hunger, dry mouth, and laughing at stupid stuff. My sister, however, is one of the super rare people who are mildly allergic to weed, compounds used in cultivation, or a little of both. She actually gets an itchy throat & other concerning side effects that are (thankfully) alleviated with a little benadryl. For me, cannabis is a wonder drug for all of my comorbid conditions, but for her it's something to take very carefully & only when really needed (I get her these 5mg mints so she can watch dosage very carefully & stay safe)."

Her red band for the er/hospital gets completely filled all the way around the band & pretty soon will require 2 of them to cover all her allergies/truly bad reactions"
Fibromyalgia,39oats,EsotericKnowledge,3,Sun Jun 14 01:43:41 2015 UTC,Depending on your asthma meds they could be responsible both for your chronic sinus issues as well as inflammation. I'm on advair and have both but it controls my asthma so I keep taking it.

My inflammatory markers are off the charts and have been for years, but I test negative for everything.  My primary doc finally had me see a hematologist, and his analysis was that the inflammation was due to my IBS like problems (it is actually extremely severe fructose malabsorption as a result of a genetic disorder).  If you want to experiment with reducing inflammation via diet (and ease IBS symptoms without medication!), I recommend checking out the FODMAP diet. I am on a modified version.

I felt like I'd drank 10 cups of coffee, I was shaking like a shitting dog, my jaw muscles tightened and clamped shut so much that it hurt like hell, I didn't sleep a wink in those two days and it killed my sex drive within hours. It seems to work for some of the people who can tolerate it, but there's many people who give up on it because they simply can't cope with what it does to them.

Mind you, I didn't feel like a zombie, just really sleepy.   Contrarily, Amitriptyline still gives me drowsiness to a T after years of taking it.   It's up to you. If the zombie feeling isn't incapacitating your daily life, then perhaps try with it a bit longer. Keep your doc posted as well.   Oh, btw, exercise and positive thinking ain't a cure for fibro as /u/Decepticle_Ronnie mentioned. It helps, but can't cure it. No known cure at the moment, unfortunately but it can be well managed."

It might get a little bit better, but it sounds like you are going to be better off without Lyrica.  In my opinion it is time to move on and try something else.

It all depends on the medication and the person. Of course, you could say that there's no real way to distinguish between a person's side-effects reducing and the patient just getting used to them over time, but the pharmacist making that absolute statement is misguided to say the least. You're in control here and you make the decision whether to give it more time or whether you can't cope with it and just stop. Remember that the longer you keep taking something like this, the more effects you may experience once you stop. Also, if you take it long enough, it's a terrible idea to just stop abruptly and you'll have to taper off the dosage, which means suffering the side-effects longer and possible introducing new ones from withdrawal. I hope you have an understanding doctor who understands why you want to stop and won't just chalk it up to you not being willing to give treatment a fair chance. I've been there before and it's no fun.

Now, I have a lot of Fibro symptoms, which is why I was comfortable with the diagnosis at first. But the more I researched and listened to others with Fibro describe their pain, the more mine seemed different. Particularly the strange sensations in my joints, which now make perfect sense if it's a connective tissue thing. I sometimes feel like I have marbles in my joints, or my tendons are being pulled apart while sitting still, and what we call my ""butt hinge."" Sometimes it literally feels like my hip joint has migrated to the middle of my buttock and is going to rip through the skin. My other pains seem pretty Fibro-like, general aches and occasional stabbing or shocks. So if something doesn't fit the diagnosis, don't let it slide. And if your doc doesn't listen, get a new one.

Fibromyalgia,39iuzs,DjGhettoSteve,2,Fri Jun 12 00:52:02 2015 UTC,"It could be meds, or it could be the fibro.  When you are in lots of pain, reproducing goes down the list of priorities from an evolutionary point of view.  Your body could be shutting down a function that it sees as not necessary right now.  If you have mechanical allodynia then it could be making sex painful, which could lead to lower sex drive.  It might have nothing at all to do with fibro or the meds you are taking.  You could have a separate medical disorder, such as low testosterone.  If you haven't mentioned this symptom to your doctor then you should do so, because there are blood tests that can find treatable problems.  Hopefully your marriage can survive without sex.  Make sure your wife understands that the problem is ""fibro fuckery"", and not because you don't love her or that she isn't attractive.  There might be alternatives to having sex that can keep your wife sexually satisfied.  Try to not feel horrible for your wife.  You have enough to deal with right now without having to worry about her.  Think of not having sex as normal, and having sex as a bonus.  People can live perfectly normal lives without having sex.  Your wife will be fine.  It may be that you still have sex, but less often, which is perfectly okay too."
Fibromyalgia,39iuzs,FibroMan,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:14:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think low T affects Women, but I'll have to look into that. I am due for my biannual bloodwork anyways.  Thankfully (I guess) my wife has fibro too, so she completely understands the fibro fuckery. We're also polyamorous (always have been), so if she really needs sex, specifically, there are other routes she can go. Granted, it's not like someone else totally covers my inaccessible libido."
Fibromyalgia,39iuzs,FibroMan,2,Fri Jun 12 05:42:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think I was the only one to assume that you were male... oops!  But yes, testosterone levels affect women too.  There are other hormones that can be tested at the same time to give a clearer picture of what is going on."

The lamictal really seemed to be the nail on my sexual coffin, but it works so damn well with my bipolar mania that I hate to think of dropping it."

It's possible you have something else going on - 'low T' is one easy example to pull from the air, but of course there are others. I'd suggest treating this new symptom as any otherwise-healthy person would, and getting an appropriate workup to see what's behind it."

Been on it for several months now and, while my drive isn't fully restored, I at least don't have any issues when she wants to have a go. Not sure how long you've been on your current meds, but my experience suggests that that specific side-effect gets better with time. Hope this turns out to be the case for you."
Fibromyalgia,39iuzs,mundabit,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:56:29 2015 UTC,"How long have you been on the meds? Sometimes the sexual dysfunction side effect wears off in time. I'm on escitalopram and I lost my sex drive and had delayed orgasm for like 6 months. (Fine now, though.) Talk to your doctor about it if it won't go away. They may want to talk about trying something different. It's common and it may seem like it's not an ""important"" side effect, but this is your quality of life and it IS important.   Also, psychology is important here! If you're concerned about not being in the mood, and worrying about it, that's going to affect your sex drive. That's a huge factor, honestly. You and your wife need to work on this together, making it low stress and an easy, relaxing, enjoyable experience for both of you. Think about things you can do together, like having a bath or giving one another massages, that could turn into something else but don't need to in order to be intimate and enjoyable."

Only thing I've added in the last year was the vistaril. I had hoped it would wear off, but I think my ocd has been fixating on feeling ""not good enough"" & adding a psych level to everything. We've been trying to do cuddly stuff that can but doesn't have to become sex, but my wife also suffers from fibro & our bodies have been awesome at flaring at the wrong times, so neither of us is near 100% at the same time.

Try rolling your feet across a tennis ball or investing in a 20 dollar massager to relieve the tension. I also love ice packs because mine get so incredibly hot. Muscle relaxers are the only pills that help me stay asleep. Medical Marijuana works best though.

Fibromyalgia,39fc1j,SweetContext,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:42:40 2015 UTC,"Yup I get those. It's actually because you're waking up suddenly from a deep sleep and your body is still paralyzed (as it does this to keep you from acting out your dreams). For whatever reason the trembling is just the constant constriction of the muscles from the paralysis. Some hormones released have a part in this too so while you may be able to move a little bit after a while (I personally never have been able to) the hormones are still being released to keep you paralyzed.  I usually just go back to sleep, because I get used to the trembling. I don't know if I can offer you any advice other than that, because I've never been actually able to move during these times."
Fibromyalgia,39fc1j,SweetContext,3,Thu Jun 11 17:25:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I think I may have explained it wrong. I'm not waking up and having it, it happens when I'm awake.

But at least if you ever wake up to it you know what it is :')  Perhaps you should talk with your FD about it? I know trembles are normal but whole body trembles seems... odd. Does anything accompany it? Dizzyness, tunnel vision, breathing difficulties or feeling your heart beat faster? Or just strictly the trembling but not actually trembling feeling?"
Fibromyalgia,39fc1j,SweetContext,2,Thu Jun 11 18:32:44 2015 UTC,Dizziness and weakness in my arms - though that may be in my head as a result of the perceived trembling.

My experience with other meds that have this as a potential side effect, is that it doesn't go away.  Spent 2 years on a med that was giving me this issue, and there was no change.  The scariest and most stressful time of my entire life!  No medication will help if you are dead.    First thing's first, tell the doctor that prescribed the medication, then follow the instructions you are given, and finally report back to the doctor regarding any new or continuing side effects or reactions while following the instructions you were given.  This is not an ""I can live with it"" side effect.  All it takes is to become disoriented in some way (extra tired, sleep walking at night, reaction with another med, etc) to accidentally follow through with something you would NEVER do in a fully aware state."
Fibromyalgia,39e8jq,Kromulent,3,Thu Jun 11 18:01:04 2015 UTC,"Agree with other comments - this is a major side effect and your doctor should want to change your medication. Talk to them about it asap, and stay safe <3"

Fibromyalgia,39aw7o,jlmitch12,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:44:54 2015 UTC,"It works fairly well but there is a lot of debate whether it is actually a narcotic or not. It acts in the same way an opoid acts.

So even though it may still be up for debate... if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck.... :)"

Something else to look into is Ultram. It's  a time released version of tramadol. Works well and for significantly longer, but insurances don't like paying for it. Currently waiting to see if my insurance will cover it or not. If so, I'll be taking it when I get up in the morning followed by 300  more MG of regular tramadol throughout the day. Unfortunately that will max me out at 400mg. But it's  still the best thing I've  found if you still want to be able to go about your day while taking it."
Fibromyalgia,39aw7o,skeletorsleftlung,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:39:18 2015 UTC,"Keep an eye out for tolerance issues. I used to take tramadol years ago, but after a few weeks I started having to take 3-5 at a time, and then after a few months it quit working all together. I didn't take it again for several years (hoping my tolerance would go down) & even then it did absolutely nothing. Worst part about fibro and the incessant nature of the disorder is that any time you find a med that helps it eventually no longer helps & you're off on another hunt for a drug.  However, I'm glad it's working for you so well. Returning to work is an amazing thing when you've been too debilitated to do so for a while. Here's hoping you have a very long, happy run :)"
Fibromyalgia,39b41m,gypsy_kitten,5,Wed Jun 10 15:39:23 2015 UTC,"It might be time to go see that rheumatolgist for a diagnosis.  FYI, I only had 25% of fibro symptoms based on the list on wikipedia.  The most important symptom is chronic, widespread aches and pains that are not explained by anything else.  The rest of the symptoms are optional."
Fibromyalgia,39b41m,FibroMan,2,Wed Jun 10 16:32:28 2015 UTC,"You probably want to ask your GP for a referral to a rheumatologist as they'll rule out any other possibilities since fibro has a lot of common symptoms with other conditions. Also, be aware that if you have noninflammatory fibro, it won't show up in a blood test. I have all the symptoms of fibro listed on the wiki page, but my bloodwork says I'm textbook healthy, which is why  I had a hard time getting GPs to take me seriously because they always looked at the bloodwork and said ""Nope, nothing to see here"" and sent me packing with a muscle relaxer (if I was lucky enough to even get that; two doctors tried treating my noninflammatory fibro with naproxen sodium which does nothing but piss off my stomach, which I told them). If your GP isn't willing to refer you to a rheumatologist or tries to diagnose you without blood tests, or - and this one just about made me deck one of my docs - tries the pressure point test on you without giving you fair warning (some docs do this to make sure you don't fake a reaction when what they're really doing is catching you offguard and making the reaction worse), get the hell out and find a new doc that WILL give you referrals and do blood tests and treat your body respectfully. I say these things because they're things so many of us have had to deal with, stories I've heard repeated over and over, that people just starting out on the journey to diagnosis can get very discouraged. There are still many GPs that don't even believe in fibro or believe that it's a temporary condition that they can cure with a little aleve (yes, one of the docs that tried to put me on naproxen sodium told me that would cure it - not treat it, but actually cure it). Best of luck, I hope you get your achies sorted out so you don't have to live with them quite so intimately."
Fibromyalgia,39b41m,sunstorm77,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:24:03 2015 UTC,"My dr did a full blood count which came back showing nothing. I went today for the results. He then talked about symptoms I am having and pressed on some pressure points, it made me cry! Gave me Tramadol and Cymbalta and told me to go back in a month, also referred me to physio and a support group."
Fibromyalgia,39b41m,Ozzycat,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:38:16 2015 UTC,"I am a mayo patient and have been waiting to be officially diagnosed since November I had to see my pcp, gey a bunch of blood tests and then try iron and d3 and glucosamine  and chondriton. Then do physical therapy. Then went to physical medicine and rehabilitation. Now I'm waiting to go to the fibromyalgia clinic where I should receive my official diagnosis. In the meantime I have no way of controlling the pain. I love mayo and am thankful to be a patient because they are very thorough, but I would like to be able to control my pain in the meantime."
Fibromyalgia,39b106,helpmefibro,2,Wed Jun 10 15:13:37 2015 UTC,"Treatment for fibro is based on trial and error.  The rheumatologist will almost certainly recommend amitriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant), and will probably recommend Lyrica (an anti-convulsant).  My advice is to try Lyrica first, because you will probably know whether it helps in a week or two, compared to a month or two on amitriptyline.  Neither drug works for everyone, or even as well as professionals and scientific research claim.  There are more drugs to try later but those two are a good starting point.  When you read about something that ""helps"" with fibro, bear in mind that it will probably help a little bit, rather than a lot.  A combination of multiple things might help a fair bit, but nobody ever, in the history of the universe has ever been cured of fibro.  One of the biggest things you can do to feel better is to adjust your lifestyle to stay within your capabilities.  Cut your working hours and reduce anything that causes stress.  Resting doesn't help fibro, so keep exercising, but find out what your limits are and stay within them.  The best long term pain relief comes from non-drug therapies.  I am successfully using a foam roller at the moment, but other things like acupuncture, physio and massage can help.  Exercises like yoga and swimming seem to work better for fibro than running or weight training.  Heat packs can work really well for temporary relief in specific areas.  Pain relief at night is just as important as pain relief during the day, because pain affects how well you sleep.  There might be a support group in your city that you can meet up with if you want to talk to fellow sufferers face to face.  Specialists can't really answer many questions because they don't have time and there aren't clear scientific answers."
Fibromyalgia,39b106,FibroMan,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:28:09 2015 UTC,"The problem with Fibro is that it's only in the last ten years or so that the medical community has begun to take it seriously, and even now you'll still run into docs who roll their eyes when they hear the word ""Fibromyalgia."" So, be prepared for that, and get rid of any doc who does that. Another problem is that because it's a relatively new condition they're still trying to figure out exactly what causes it and how it affects the body. That makes treatment kind of difficult. From personal experience and what I've heard around here the most common helpful meds are antidepressants (Cymbalta seems to be the most common one as it has pain management qualities) and muscle relaxers. I agree with staying away from narcotic pain meds if at all possible. The narcotic pain management cycle sucks. Tramadol is in my opinion the best non-narcotic pain med, as well as Naproxen (basically prescription-strength Aleve). I highly recommend a TENS unit. It's a small contraption with electrode pads that you place on your sore muscles and it sends a electric pulses into the muscle. Topical pain creams, hot baths, heat packs, ice packs. You never know what combo might help, so try it all. Also, learn your limits. If you over exert yourself one day, you will pay for it the next. Low impact exercise like swimming and yoga are preferable. Good luck to you."
Fibromyalgia,39b106,jlmitch12,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:18:46 2015 UTC,"Anti-inflammatory pain meds like ibuprofen aren't really helpful because fibro is non-inflammatory, so you're basically stuck with paracetamol. Get a prescription so it doesn't cost you much. And it'll kill your liver over time, so... yeah. It sucks. But it's better than nothing (or that's what I tell myself). Tramadol is less addictive than many opioids so you can talk to your doctors about that.  My doctor suggested pilates particularly for shoulder and upper back pain. Take it easy, though. Don't push yourself with exercise, but do get some exercise regularly. Your basic methods are heat and cold, so get yourself some heating pads and ice packs. Those wheat bag things are good because they can be heated or chilled, but they can be HEAVY."

The hemp plant contains enough THCa (like 0.15%) to interact with the other cannabinoids. A lot of reviews I read look down on Dixie. When I switched to the Cibdex oil, I could tell from the effects it was higher quality. But the salve works for me - and that's what matters.   In order to not play quality roulette, I just started my own hemp tinctures (one heated to make the 0.15% THCa -> THC, one not. For science.) but I won't know how they will turn out for another 4 weeks or so. I plan to put the results into double aught pills or try to make some homemade lotion/salve. I was able to order the hemp from the EU, which has a much more stringent FDA than we do (I forget the name of their FDA equivalent) so im not worried there."

I do plan on getting over there in a few years. Can you suggest the best time to visit with the weather? I think it's humid there this time of year. Thanks!
Fibromyalgia,394km1,Ridiculous_Diagnosis,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:15:59 2015 UTC,"Hello to you!  Coincidentally, we're having the warmest day of the year (so far) today.  My husband and I have a digital weather thermometer in our garden and it reached 29.2 (celcius) today, which is rather toasty warm for Scotland.  It's 6pm now and it's still 26C out there!  Edinburgh doesn't have humid summers like most other countries do though; I was in Bangkok many years ago and I've never experienced humidity like that before! (around 80%)  I'm not very good in very humid climates.  Generally speaking, July and August are our warmest months (averages are 15C, but days can be around 22-28C), but there's still a good chance of overcast skies and rain, regardless of when you're looking to visit (I maintain that this is because we have a lot of parks, fields, and rolling green landscapes which need regular watering!)  If you visit during August, you'll be able to enjoy all that Edinburgh has to offer all year round, but you'll also be here during the Edinburgh International Festival, Edinburgh Festival Fringe and the Edinburgh International Book Festival (as well as many smaller events running throughout the city).  Edinburgh really comes alive during August; it's the most incredible time of the year.  Christmas and Hogmanay is also a magical time in the city, but the weather is very cold and wet in December!"

Fibromyalgia,393x1e,frazzledmommy,2,Tue Jun 9 02:29:23 2015 UTC,"Are you me?  I posted about my Gallstone diagnoses here Last Monday at 2am I went to the ER because I was having an acute attack of pain and finding it hard to breathe.  I was treated really well at the ER, for the first time in my life I was  triaged without the usual ""We don't normally manage those issues here, you're better off going home and calling your doctor in the morning"" bullshit. I was given some disgusting lidocaine to swallow to numb my GIT (It was really effective) then they canulated me in the waiting room and started pumping me full of Zofran because I kept throwing up. By the time I was brought into the treatment bays I had already been offered Fentanyl and Endone, But I requested some IV paracetamol and codeine because I know that usually does the trick for my 8/10 pain, which along with the anaesthetic, It did.  I was admitted for a surgical consult, Which came the next day at 8am, I was happy to see I was on 4hr observations, not 6 or 12, that meant they were taking me seriously. I was also happy to see that they removed the stupid ""Hypertension"" diagnoses from my file. Pro tip to medical professionals, If I only ever come to the ER complaining of pain and my BP is always 140/100 when I complain of pain, My high BP is probably because I'm in pain, if my pain free BP baseline is 110/65, I DON'T have Hypertension, I have PAIN. /rant  Anyway, The surgical consult was unconvinced that my pain was due to a gallstone obstruction, and surgery was deemed unnecessary. I was told to take panadine forte and was then discharged. I raised the question of ""so, I just take panadine and come back when my liver clocks out? or do I take it for 5 days and call you, or what? because I've been in pain for 2 months, panadine wont fix the cause"" and I was given the ""call back"" advice. When I call back I'm going to talk to them about getting some of that GIT anaesthetic to have at home for future attacks, and I'm desperately going to push them to let me get IV panadine for home administration, and/or to have a permanent arrangement with the hospital that I can go to the ER and receive a single dose as needed for major flares (once every month or so). I have to call my GP (who is on maternity leave :/ ) and update her on everything, Hopefully she and I can sit dow and develop a proper plan.    I realise this story doesn't actually help you, But I wanted to let you know that yes, gallstones and gallbladder inflammation will worsen your fibro flare ups and it will be really hard to explain your condition because it all just feels so vaguely flu like. If youre having new symptoms because of the gallbladder, they will defnitaly be helped by having the bladder removed.  But Fibromyalgia and Surgery is no easy feat, you will take longer to recover and feel twice as horrible as your average Joe. So don't have your fingers crossed for any major changes in your fibro, but it will help your gallbladder related symptoms."
Fibromyalgia,393x1e,mundabit,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:53:31 2015 UTC,"Wow, I just read your thread, and I think you are me!  My mother and sister have had their gallbladder removed, so I'm presuming that I will too.    My BP all night was around 107/58, so pretty low which is usual for me.  Definitely no hypertension there.  I was released this morning with instructions to come back straight away if I have another episode.  I work 4 days a week so I really hope this doesn't happen again soon.  I have had surgery with fibro and have been lucky so far - I expect it to be so bad that anything else is a relief.    My thought is that I'd actually be happy if this is gallbladder stuff, this has a fix. Maybe my 'fibro' symptoms will reduce.  I knew I was feeling extra lousy over the past few months so I know it sounds sick, but I'm a little excited that it's my gallbladder!"

Fibromyalgia,393x1e,lethesbramble,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:32:40 2015 UTC,"As I wrote above, gallstones and fibro should never be confused. Fibro is a diagnosis of elimination, which means that every other common condition that can explain your symptoms has been ruled out. Gallstones and other gallbladder issues all have diagnostic testing that is quick and easy to do. It should be very easy for them to tell you if you have problems with it or not. I don't and I've had pain that can easily mimic it. It's all too easy for a surgeon to pull your gallbladder out. I'm glad that other people posting here had smart surgeons who knew it wasn't the gallbladder before doing unnecessary surgery. I hope your doctors are as smart."
Fibromyalgia,393x1e,Rhaenys_targaryen,2,Tue Jun 9 11:14:11 2015 UTC,My sister and I both have fibro and had our gallbladders removed within 4 months of each other.  My sisters' fibro symptoms lessened greatly.  I was not as lucky.  Our FMS symptoms can mask underlying issues.  My sister had actually been going to the ER for years with symptoms and they always told her it was her FMS.  She finally got a doctor to run tests and she had over two dozen gallstones by the time they figured it out.  I'd say get it out because you might be lucky like my sister.  My only warning is that your digestive system has to adjust.  The doctors didn't warn me and I had an eventful year of finding a bathroom quickly when eating the wrong foods. Good luck.

Also I suffered for 8 years b/c the docs kept telling me the sludge wasn't causing me any pain. so just FYI.
Fibromyalgia,393x1e,Decepticle_Ronnie,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:47:45 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, since you still suffer the same pain after removal, what makes you think it was the cause of anything? I'd say all evidence points to that it wasn't responsible and I'd say any improvement you had is likely due to placebo effects."
Fibromyalgia,393x1e,shaylenn,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:15:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not having the gallbladder attacks anymore and painkillers started working after removal. Then when I discontinued them, I started getting this sharp pain that I had before but didn't have the gallbladder pain. it was all just in the same area.  Also when they did the squeeze test, i almost vomited and came off the table."
Fibromyalgia,393x1e,miloisadog,2,Tue Jun 9 16:28:38 2015 UTC,"Many fibro symptoms can mimic gallbladder symptoms. I've had one surgeon insist that I had gallbladder problems and changed his mind after doing extensive testing that showed nothing. I've also been admitted to hospital once in the last few years with them sure of the same thing, again, discharged after every test came back negative and the symptoms calmed down on their own.   Seriously, do not let them remove it without conclusive, positive results from testing. It's entirely possible that you'll go through surgery and come out feeling just the same, except minus a gallbladder. Many surgeons and doctors don't think about fibro or don't believe in it and go with the most likely case, which is gallbladder issues. It's likely not to be.  Every symptom you just listed is also known under ""fibro"". Just because it can also be the gallbladder doesn't mean it is. For one thing, if you're not getting very odd coloured stool, then it's even less likely to be your gallbladder.  Again, second guess your doctors and don't let them in there to remove anything with them showing you conclusive, positive diagnostic testing."
Fibromyalgia,393x1e,Cyrridven,2,Tue Jun 9 11:08:23 2015 UTC,"I had pain like a red hot poker being stabbed through the top center of my abdomen.  I could touch the spot that hurt and knew the exact spot of pain.  I couldn't tolerate food and was on a bland diet because I kept throwing up. I was only 25, thin, and a non-smoker.  I ended up in the ER because I was sweating and dying in pain.  It turned out that I had what is called a mulberry stone, meaning one big stone made up of a lot of small ones stuck together.  A small stone was passing and had obstructed my bile duct.  I was given meds and scheduled for surgery a few weeks later, but they ended up moving the surgery up because I had such severe malnutrition.  I literally woke up from surgery, still with all the pain from having been cut open, feeling SO SO much better.  It was like someone had pulled out that burning poker and the pain was gone.  They can tell very conclusively with an ultrasound if you have gallstones or not.  Easy test.  And I was mostly fully recovered (back to climbing stairs) within a week.  I could move around fine, just not lift anything heavy.    So, get an ultrasound, and if they find stones, get that sucker out.  BEST. SURGERY. EVER!!!"

Finally, once I had sat there for a little while and ""cooled off"" (which was cold and unpleasant, by the way), I managed to get just enough strength to get out and stumble over to the bed.  Ever since then, I'm very careful about my bathtub habits! (I always try to at least keep my phone nearby in case I really get in a bind or something... I need to get a grab handle/support.)"

I shave one leg. Take a break shave the other leg. Take a break and then shave both arms and then get in the shower to wash off. It takes me 20 minutes.

It is common among individuals that work directly with trauma victims such as nurses, psychologists, and first responders. It was first diagnosed in nurses in the 1950s. Sufferers can exhibit several symptoms including hopelessness, a decrease in experiences of pleasure, constant stress and anxiety, sleeplessness or nightmares, and a pervasive negative attitude. This can have detrimental effects on individuals, both professionally and personally, including a decrease in productivity, the inability to focus, and the development of new feelings of incompetency and self-doubt.

Fibromyalgia,38toyk,maggrathea,6,Sat Jun 6 18:58:16 2015 UTC,"I've had decent success with medical cannabis, so I have a few questions that might help tweak how you use it, method-wise.   What administration method(s)do you use?  Vapor, smoke, capsules, etc. How much cannabis do you use on average per day/week/month? How often are you using cannabis?  Do you use it daily or occasionally?   I didn't get good results from cannabis until I started to use it daily and frequently, making sure to get regular and consistent edible dosages.  I vaporize for peak pain and take a high CBD oil 3 times a day.  I found that edibles daily worked ok for lowering intensity and duration of migraines, but the best has been the regular high CBD intake.  Also, for peak migraine specific pain, I find fairly high doses of THC work best.  Hash was my go to, but I can get THC oil from my dispensary that seems to work well.  To give an idea of my success, I pretty much always have a migraine or some form of frontal cortex headache.  Before cannabis, I would have migraines that would peak at 9 to 10 on the pain scale, and last for up to 3 weeks.  With regular dosing and edibles, it went down to being 3 to 4 days at a time.  With high CBD dosing daily since last summer I have only gotten them at that same level of pain for a day or two and even then I can usually either just sleep or spend some money pounding THC into me.  I still get all of the side effects - aura bad enough to disturb my bookworm behaviour, light sensitivity (I wear the darkest prescription glasses I could find, especially out of my house), confusion, even more difficulties speaking, and so on.  Nausea can get pretty bad in the mornings before my first vape or oral dose.  Treating cannabis like a daily medication just like any other medication has helped the most."
Fibromyalgia,38toyk,Ialmostthewholepost,2,Sat Jun 6 20:51:38 2015 UTC,"I smoke and very infrequently, maybe once a week at most. I don't really like the feeling of being high a whole lot, so I don't do it much, but since I've had an unbroken flare up for over three months now and am having trouble sleeping, I was thinking of upping it. When I do use it, I do feel better, so knowing that it helped you so much makes me optimistic about what it can do. Our migraines seem very similar in frequency and pain level.  I live in New Mexico, where it's very difficult to get a medical marijuana card (I'm still working on getting that official) and there are no dispensaries in my city, so my access to other forms is limited, but this is good to know, especially as I go through with the process of getting my card."
Fibromyalgia,38toyk,Ialmostthewholepost,5,Sat Jun 6 21:26:51 2015 UTC,"There is good news.  Unlike other drugs, the high from cannabis is separate from its pain killing ability.  After a couple of months of taking the same dosage you no longer feel high, but get the same pain relieving qualities.    Also, high CBD strains with a low THC percentage might be right up your alley if you can find it.   Most people report no high from those. :-)"
Fibromyalgia,38toyk,Ridiculous_Diagnosis,3,Sat Jun 6 22:26:34 2015 UTC,"Keep it moving. Get outside. Walk for 5-10 minutes. Any time whatsoever to simply be on your feet and tuning out the world with your earbuds is quality time for your mind and body. Walking with music on my ipod is my mental and physical me-time. The more active you are, the more equipped you will be to handle the pain.   Be nice to yourself :) Your body is a tantrum-throwing child with the aches and pains of a 90 year old woman. Take hot baths or showers. Heat is the #1 soothing agent for me. I have a heating pad for bad spasm days. Get a lotion or body scrub that helps your skin stay hydrated because most of us have skin problems. But maintaining it is easier than fixing it. It's also like pampering to me when I do scrubs or lotions and it relaxes me.   Relaxing and sulking on the couch are two different things entirely. Try to learn the difference. Sulking on the couch is what we do when we're miserable, in pain, fed-up, depressed, anxious, etc. Relaxing is a technique to relieve stress. Know your limits and learn how much relaxing time you need to replenish yourself and don't beat yourself up for needing that time. Everyone has a different burden to bear and different needs. Taking care of your body is going to be yours.   And having a therapist or a really good friend helps with the emotional aspect of it :) Can't recommend that enough."

Hope at least some of this is helpful for you! :)"
Fibromyalgia,38toyk,FibroMan,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:10:23 2015 UTC,"I recommend trying to deal with your migraines first, because they might be making your fibromyalgia worse.  If you get migraines once a week or more then you might want to try one of the drugs that reduce the frequency of migraines, eg topamax.  There are also drugs that can stop a migraine once you feel it starting, eg sumatriptan.  A paracetamol/codeine mix such as mersyndol can be taken in addition to sumatriptan for a really bad migraine.  If you have chronic migraine (15 days of headache per month including 8 days of migraine) then botox might be a treatment option.  Try to accept yourself for who you are, fibro and all.  If you can't work and you have to live with your parents for the rest of your life then that is okay.  If you can hold down a part time job and eventually move out on your own again then that is a bonus.  Trying to achieve the same things as people who aren't dealing with fibro can make your fibro and depression symptoms worse."

Fibromyalgia,38toyk,kiwiburd,1 point,Mon Jun 8 10:40:41 2015 UTC,"i've been diagnosed for 4 years, the summer before i started my pharmacy program. since it's my area of study and something that affects me, i've spent a lot of my free time looking into medication therapies that work. i'm not a doctor and i'm still in the process of getting my board certification but i do feel like i'm familiar with the drugs.   anyway, what doctor is managing your fibromyalgia right now? is your doctor familiar with fibro? if not, finding someone who can help you is a good start.  one thing that jumps out to me about your medication list is that gabapentin isn't really recommended first line for fibromyalgia. lyrica (generic- pregabalin) is the same class and has shown better results in clinical trials. it also helps with anxiety.   has anyone ever mentioned taking an antidepressant? there are two main categories: ones that increase serotonin and ones that increase norepinephrine (adrenaline). many antidepressants have activity in these two areas. one that is actually FDA indicated for fibromyalgia is Cymbalta. norepi has a role in the pain pathway, that i won't get into now, but long term (about 2 months) it also has anti-depressant activity. also, it takes about 2 months to also see help in the pain area. i've read studies saying cymbalta decreases pain by 30%. that may be a lot or a little, depending on the individual.   if your migraines are really severe and happen more than a few times a week, i would definitely bring this up with your doctor. there are drugs that can be used for prevention.  i think, for a lot of us, it's helpful to identify triggers. triggers for migraines and triggers for fibro pain.   non-medication modalities also go a long way. diet- are you eating foods that are high in high fructose corn syrup, MSG, or a lot of sugar in general? these can cause pain flare ups. for your fibro, are you exercising? exercise, in moderation, at levels that won't make you feel worse, is very helpful! endorphins are your brain's natural pain killers. swimming and yoga are low impact. swimming is supposed to wonders for fibro! (i'm not sure because i haven't tried it enough) physical therapy is also another way to go.  there is a fine line between angering your fibro and helping it though. it can be frustrating at times but i feel like figuring out your fibro is very helpful. definitely something i have no accomplished yet.   another thing is not to push yourself too hard. you will pay for it later. and sometimes it's hard to listen to your body but you have to learn to.   for your pain, if you have adequate insurance, seeing a pain specialist may help. there are topical patches/creams: biofreeze (over the counter), icy hot, lidocaine patches (rx). also oral pain medications.   so, to sum up this super long post:   is your doctor the right doctor? is your lifestyle contributing to fibro symptoms? are your medications appropriate? are you avoiding your triggers? are you pushing yourself too hard? if, after, all of these are addressed, do you need additional help to control pain?"
Fibromyalgia,38s1wr,quirkyowl,23,Sat Jun 6 09:04:38 2015 UTC,"Did they discover that activity reduces fibro pain, or that people with less fibro pain tend to be more active? The article makes it look like this was a simple observational study that merely noticed a correlation between these two factors. If that's all it is, it belongs in the trash.  It's like saying that people who go to parties all the time usually don't have splitting headaches every day, while people who do have headaches tend to stay home. ""It might hurt at first, but get out there and socialize, kids!"""
Fibromyalgia,38s1wr,Kromulent,6,Sat Jun 6 12:57:58 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. Did everyone start with a certain level of pain,  then after increasing activity notice a reduction in pain? Ie: comparing individuals to their own baseline. Or did they just jump straight in and ask ""what's your activity level and what's your pain level?"" and rank all study subjects against each other?   In my line of work I end up walking over 5000 steps,  but some days you physically can't get out of bed for fatigue or pain.  I used to do yoga,  pilates and cycling, I still try,  but it doesn't change my pain levels at all, and there is a fine,  fine line between a therapeutic level of activity and a level that will cause a flare up. Every day that line changes based on factors like sleep,  weather and emotional stress. Pacing is vital.   What being active does do is boost my mood and give me the psychological tenacity needed to say ""fuck you fibro""  and soldier on. But again,  push a little too hard and I'm in a fibro flare for weeks.   Also,  the article mentioned ""analgesic effect""  several times,  for some reason that bothered me because pharmaceutical analgesics have very little impact on the pain of fibromylgia. So did they mean that the natural analgesic effect actually had some impact?  Or just that exercise has an analgesic effect,  because we already knew that.  But analgesia is useless to us."
Fibromyalgia,38s1wr,mundabit,6,Sat Jun 6 17:48:34 2015 UTC,"I think it's important that they noted this is still preliminary. These types of articles report current data and inferences so that the person doing the study will get the credit for their research a no someone else will not swoop in and take all the credit.

Fibromyalgia,38s1wr,chipsnsalsa13,6,Sat Jun 6 13:41:20 2015 UTC,"I also found that interesting. In my life I swing between what this study would classify as moderate and whatever they called that higher level of activity. When I need to be more active, I have to take more medication to get going in the morning generally, but once I'm going I'm usually really busy, so I simply don't have time to think about being in pain. I wonder if that distraction factor would have anything to do with it too."

I wouldn't credit it with achieving that.  It looks like they had to carefully select 3 groups to find a correlation.  If there really was a correlation then a simple X,Y scatter graph with a line of best fit would be more convincing than averages of 3 artificially selected groups.  The groups that they selected are based more on popular culture than scientific research.  According to this,  10,000 steps per day started as a marketing tool for manufacturers of pedometers in Japan.  The average number of steps in the US is 5,900 and the recommended number of steps for a normal person is about 7,000 to 8,000.  Real world, meaningful numbers were ignored for the selection of their groups.  At least they acknowledged that their research was seriously flawed and didn't prove anything, albeit encoded in the phrase ""These are preliminary results""."

I'm so tired of these correlation->causation type conclusions being drawn all across the medical field... I read one study about adolescent girls with PCOS related insulin resistance, how they tended to eat a little more and exercise a little less than their peers without PCOS/IR. The study then recommended diet and exercise to prevent PCOS/IR, without mentioning that being insulin resistant can make you very tired and very hungry. They were basically implying the syndrome is a result of inactivity and overeating, when that's not necessarily the case.   I'm so sick of being told I'm having fibro symptoms because I'm depressed.

Fibromyalgia,38s1wr,Le_Squish,5,Mon Jun 8 15:28:02 2015 UTC,"I can only repeat what my physical therapist told me about activity. When you aren't active and the muscles start to atrophy, it cause it's own set of problems with motion and posture that are very painful even without the added affects of fibro. You may start favoring a side or limb to try and avoid making other body parts hurt. These leads to even more pain and imbalance in your body and loss of range of motion. The cycle feeds itself and you body ends up in a downward spiral.   Humans bodies need to be in motion, regardless of chronic pain."

I had pain and my sleep schedule was wacky but I was more flexible and agile. Since graduating and becoming very sedentary at a desk job I have much worse pain and much lower energy. My sleep is regular and generally better but I'm missing the activity portion. I just need to find the balance.

Fibromyalgia,38s1wr,chipsnsalsa13,3,Sun Jun 7 18:52:28 2015 UTC,"The study may be flawed, but activity has helped me. Fibro for four years now, diagnosed last fall, along with symptoms dating back to childhood. I was always active, up until the fibro hit, then I tried to stay active. After moving for a new job, I became inactive for most of a year, slept decent and pain was minimal, but my health tanked and fatigue was intense. Began swimming last summer, slow and challenging. In November I started walking to work, 1.5 miles each way, and it hurt bad. The pain was intense and the first month was a struggle.   After three months of 3+ miles per day I noticed that I had more energy and didn't need the ibuprofen or naproxen as often. A year ago I needed two energy drinks and  ibuprofen each day to function, now, after seven months of increased activity, I'm caffeine free and have a better handle on pain without needing the analgesics. I still get sick, have days where I can barely get out of bed, but they are somewhat less common. My digestive issues are better controlled and my mood is much brighter.   At this point I'm building up my cardio, a couple months ago I could barely get my heart rate into cardio range, yesterday I hit 20 minutes. The cardio and being caffeine free helps with temperature regulation. I used to have fevers throughout the week, start shaking from chills, now it's once a week or less."
Fibromyalgia,38s1wr,what_the_a,3,Sun Jun 7 12:29:39 2015 UTC,"I honestly believe this. My evidence is purely anecdotal but ever since I started exercising more...I fall into the Vigorous category at least 4 out of 7 days a week and my pain level is way low. I used to take all kinds of meds to control the pain and now I take nothing but meds for my blood pressure. Back then I also used to be very sedentary, I'd use a wheelchair to get around and probably walked 2,000 steps a day max.  I still have pain, I still have problems related to fibromyalgia but I find that when I do have set backs and flares that I bounce back much quicker. I've just adopted the mentality that if I'm going to be in pain whether I sit on the couch or go hiking then I'd rather be hiking. It's so easy to become sedentary when you hurt. I hope this research continues and finds more supporting evidence that exercise helps. It might get insurance to cover more physical therapy."
Fibromyalgia,38s1wr,chipsnsalsa13,3,Sat Jun 6 14:35:58 2015 UTC,"This was my hospital's advice, but I find that anything beyond mild stretching leaves me in a lot of pain and causes a flare-up. I'm trying to be as active as I can but my activity levels are still very low. How did you increase your activity levels without crashing? I'm assuming you didn't just go straight from the couch to a long hike. I try to keep the mindset of ""I hurt anyway, I may as well do something I want/need to do rather than sit at home feeling bad"", but it's hard when I do something and then the next day I'm in agony and completely exhausted. It makes me have to weigh up whether it really is worth doing things."
Fibromyalgia,38s1wr,chipsnsalsa13,3,Sat Jun 6 18:51:10 2015 UTC,I think it's a slow process. Start with walking just 100 steps more than you did yesterday or last week. Slowly build up. Maybe it'll take you a year to get up to 5000 steps but it's better than nothing and it's improvement.
Fibromyalgia,38s1wr,xsunxspotsx,2,Sat Jun 6 23:26:33 2015 UTC,"You are right, I didn't just go on a hike I had to work up to it. I started out with a 1 lb dumbbell and resistance bands and did strength training first. I'm still not in great cardiovascular condition. The first few months were awful. It felt like I was in a constant flare but it slowly just tapered off. A physical therapist told me it's fairly normal for muscles to hurt more when they are unused and are first starting to be used and that once you cross that hurdle it gets a lot easier.  I would suggest making a schedule. Start out doing 5 minutes of walking 3 times a week (every other day) plus a little strength training with a yellow band or 1 lb dumbbell. Second week do 5 minutes, 10 minuets, 5 minutes everyother day. Keep adding to this and after awhile your body will begin to adjust. I've found with my Fibro that I need a day of rest after a day of exercise. I do one day on and one day off. If I skip two days in a row I found that my pain level increases for some weird reason.   I also take  a B complex, calcium, and potassium supplement. The B seems to help with energy, the potassium often helps with muscle cramps, and the calcium is for overall health."

I say the same to anyone who thinks I'm faking or exaggerating. I'm still a young man and I miss out on so much in life. I sit at home while my girlfriend goes off on holiday without me. I sit at home while my friends travel across the city to parties or other events. I go home early from things because I don't feel up it. I cancel things I was really looking forward to at the last minute because I can't predict how I'll feel.   For anyone who wishes they could ""stay at home and sleep like I do"", I tell them I wish I could live my life the way I want to like they do and why would I miss out on so much if I had a choice? Ignorant people suck and I would suggest you have one, just one, attempt at explaining the situation and educating them, but in my experience, you can talk away ignorance, so they won't change. After that one attempt, I just get straight to the point. I don't care if they think I'm rude. I struggle with enough shit with fibro as it is without having to worry about what people say and think about me."

Just because I can ""get away with"" shitty grades and no social life that doesn't mean I want it this way."

Fibromyalgia,38rppo,Booby_Hatch,3,Sat Jun 6 22:45:08 2015 UTC,"I sleep so much too.  I go to work and then sometimes have to go to bed as soon as I get home, then I'm out for the night.  It has been so bad lately that I actually fell asleep while driving the car, very scary.  I went for a walk yesterday and had to have a sleep when I got home! I really wish I didn't need so much sleep, or be so fatigued when I'm awake.  There are so many things I could do!"
Fibromyalgia,38rppo,EsotericKnowledge,1 point,Sat Jun 6 07:49:38 2015 UTC,"Ugh I know! I hate how much of my life is wasted by sleep. I've never fallen asleep while driving, but I have fallen asleep in the shower (I was sitting on the shower floor because my legs hurt too much to stand), in my closet while digging for something on the floor at the back (not a walk-in), during a ~30 second break at physical therapy, and while folding laundry."
Fibromyalgia,38r9kd,crimsonlights,4,Sat Jun 6 03:24:42 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're having a really rough time. I'm sorry about that. But you're definitely not alone in this and the good thing about these forums is you can talk about this stuff with people who do understand.   I understand wanting to get out and date, this illness can be pretty lonely. But before you can do that you need to find some kind of treatment plan that works for you. No one thing works for everyone so it's important you work with someone who is experienced in helping people with CFS. I found a physio therapist who specializes in helping CFS patients and she's amazing. You can find people like her by google searching or asking around different doctors/professionals etc. Once you get things under control, then you can look at dating. Right now it's just not realistic to expect that much from yourself. Also, cognitive behavioral therapy may really help you. It sounds like you've got a lot going on in your head and it will really help you to deal with all of this. CFS isn't all in your head but your head does play an important role in recovery.   Tramadol, for me, knocked me out. It's a pretty heavy sedative and won't be helping your energy at all. And if you're sleeping all day you won't sleep at night. Taking heavy painkillers regularly is also just not very good for your body. I relied on different painkillers for a long time and now I have a malabsorption issue. Basically my stomach etc built up a barrier against all the medication and now I don't absorb enough nutrients from my food. I eventually decided to come off all the meds completely and now I deal with it as naturally as possible. Acupuncture helps, so does marijuana, so does gentle exercise, and good sleep.   If exercise isn't working for you you either need to tone it way down or give it a beak. Even gentle stretching each day goes a long way. Improving circulation will really help you. It helps your body heal and improving circulation can also help the pain.   I know this is really hard. But trying to keep a positive outlook is probably the best thing you can do. If you're stressed out it will make things much, much worse. If family is a source of stress you need to talk to them, help them understand what this is like for you, and try to get them to see how much you need their help, love and support.   Most importantly don't push yourself and don't expect too much from yourself. You need to take it easy. Rest whenever you feel like it. Find fun things to do while resting to prevent yourself from dwelling on things.   Once you have things sorted out a bit more it'll be easier to start meeting people. Even if it's just finding people online. It's not easy to find someone who's willing to look past your illness, but they're out there. I'm very lucky that my boyfriend understands and supports me (we got together before I got sick though). But it's just like daring normally in a lot of ways, you still gotta try and let your best attributes shine through, so that people look past your illness and see you for who you are. Whether that's being funny, romantic, quirky, sensitive, fun, fanatic, passionate, smart, friendly, etc. You can be sick and still have these qualities. It's just a lot easier to be those things when you have your illness under control and your mind in a good place. Not necessarily all the time, but enough that people still want to be around you.   I wish you luck and we're always here to help!"

I talked to my specialist about medical marihuana, and she said the pain clinic that prescribes it is a year long wait, at best. I'm pretty sure I'm on the waiting list, and if she didn't refer me, my psychiatrist definitely did.   I don't want to keep taking my tramadol, because I don't like it, but I honestly don't know what to do. My dad is constantly pressuring me to walk every time I see him, but I don't know how to get through to him that it's just too hard. My sister does the same thing; the 3 of us went for an hour and a half long walk and it took me 3 days to recover.   I really wish I was normal... I'm 19, for fuck's sakes.

Fibromyalgia,38r9kd,fibrofightinggirl09,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:13:00 2015 UTC,"If you really need painkillers (and that's fine, some people just do) there are better options. Trams are really best for short term use I think. I was on amitriptaline (not sure of the spelling) which is a nightly dose. It works really well for some people but it gave me too many side effects so I qualified for gabapantin (again, not sure of that spelling sorry haha) which is essentially the same kind of thing just with no side effects (I think). Only I never ended up taking it because I decided to go natural instead and just deal with the pain. I would definitely recommend talking to your doctor about different pain management, if tramadol isn't working you should really try something different.   As for the dad thing.. I 100% can relate. Ugh. It's the most frustrating thing! After my diagnosis my dad didn't really give a shit (nothing new there) but EVERY time I talked to him after that he'd ask ""have you been to the gym?"" And no matter how I explained it to him he just wouldn't get it. ""Dad, I have to rest for 20 minutes every time I take a shower. The gym is unrealistic."" ""My specialist said I shouldn't exercise if I can't manage it. I'm not meant to push myself."" He'd just ignore it or brush it off every time I tried to explain it. Even worse, he'd lecture me on the negative effects of immobility. LIKE I DON'T ALREADY KNOW THAT, DAD. Eventually I got sick of it and linked him to an article about CFS and exercise. Because unfortunately he's more likely to take notice of a reputable article than trust I know what I'm talking about. Perhaps your dad is the same? If he sees actual scientific evidence he might listen to you. Or, even better, you could invite him along to one of your appointments so a professional can explain it to him and he'll understand.   Having your family understand what's going on and how to help you is very important. They're your main support system. There are lots of good resources online for helping you discuss this stuff with them. It might take them a little while but hopefully they get it sooner or later.   I've been where you are, and while my health hasn't improved a whole lot, my life has gotten much easier after learning how to manage myself. I'm 21, so not far off your age. I've been sick since I was 14/15 so I get it. It's incredibly frustrating being sick at this age. There's so much pressure to grow up, to be educated, to be creative/adventurous, to be busy and social, to be this and that. But that's not our reality, so we have to remove ourselves from those expectations and accept our reality for what it is. Once we've done that it's much easier to adjust to this new life and work within our limitations. It you haven't already, I suggest checking out social media like tumblr and Instagram, if you haven't already, there are large communities there full of people just like us. It helps you feel less isolated when you can socialize with people like that. And being able to talk to people who understand is amazing. Of course reddit is good too :)"

Up until about 7 years ago, you pretty much had to be dying from cancer to get a red card (mmj). We finally got that expanded to cover just about anything, primarily due to approvals for chronic pain, insomnia, and chronic headaches. The first year I got mine, I took in 3 folders full of medical records and proof of prior treatments that had failed to manage my conditions. The doc was very impressed at my thoroughness, but this was after I'd gone through disability paperwork for the same stuff so it was conveniently packaged already. The second year, after changes to the laws, I brought a very slimmed down version & the doc actually stopped me after the first 4 reasons I needed my mmj. It was both reassuring & really sad to be told I was overqualified before I even got through half of the issues I used it for.

Bad sleep is insidious and it can wreak havoc on your life.  You might not be able to fix the fibro, but if you can fix the sleep problem, you will surely feel better. Here's how to do it:  http://sleepfoundation.org/ask-the-expert/sleep-hygiene  These may sound like little things, but they are not. It can be tough to actually do this stuff and to follow through with it, but it almost always helps.  It takes time, maybe a few weeks, maybe longer, but you can train your body to go to sleep at night, wake up in the morning, and not sleep during the day.   The way I think of it is like this - suppose I took an ordinary healthy person, and forced them into the sleep schedule that you are living with right now. How would they look after a few months of that? That's the kind of change we're talking about.  You mentioned MJ as well, and I'll add my vote to the pile that says its been incredibly helpful. I've found that it can reduce my discomfort at night, which is a big part of getting a restful sleep. I don't know what country or state you are in, but you might find that the risk of buying some on your own is not so great. Find out what the risks really are, and then choose what you think is best."

Since you've never experienced it before I would say absolutely go back. In time you'll probably learn to feel the difference between your normal reaction and a ""this isn't normal I need to go back"" feeling.  Never feel bad about going back, the worst that can happen is that you either find out there's nothing wrong and you feel better about it, or there is something wrong and they fix it and you feel better.

Looking at actual research into traumatic hypopituitarism, it appears to be a very limited and unusual thing. The most-cited study on it is from 1986. The most recent study, from 2007, is specifically exploring its prevalence, and finds that it is extremely rare: less than 15% of the people who are specifically hospitalized for traumatic brain injuries develop this particular effect. Unless you've had brain injuries so severe that you were (or should have been) hospitalized, it looks very unlikely that this would be relevant."

They are associated with palpable nodules in taut bands of muscle fibers.  They are a topic of ongoing controversy, as there is limited data to inform a scientific understanding of the phenomenon. Accordingly, a formal acceptance of myofascial ""knots"" as an identifiable source of pain is more common among bodyworkers, physical therapists, and chiropractors and osteopathic practitioners. Nonetheless, the concept of trigger points provides a framework which may be used to help address certain musculoskeletal pain.

I am hoping to learn some skills to manage the fog so I can graduate at the top of my class, but I am realizing it will not come quite as easily as it had in the past.  Any tips for me as I move forward?"

I end up playing charades but can't remember associated words either!  So frustrating!

If it makes you feel any better they are generally not worth the wait :O  There are still some drugs to try before going to the pain clinic, eg amitriptyline, cymbalta and tramadol if necessary.

I'm 30, so I get the youth aspect, but once I started having less pain and feeling more confident in going places by myself I fell in love with my cane. I suggest looking for a cane tutorial on YouTube, because proper technique is important to getting the best results. And I don't suggest ordering a cane at all. Go to the store and try a bunch of different kinds to see which feels right. For me the most important aspect is the handle, which I probably wouldn't have guessed. With my allodynia, the hard handles are extremely uncomfortable. The one I picked has a silicon handle. It also glows in the dark and folds up, so it's very convenient. I have a few different ones now so I can match with my outfits if I'm feeling girlish. Focus on an aide as something to enhance your quality of life and further maintain your independence, rather than something the detracts. Because once you find the right one, it's going to improve things. It's no different than needing glasses or taking insulin. It's just another tool to make your life easier and more enjoyable. I get out a lot more now that I use a cane. It's good stuff."

I gave in and got one last week. It's one of the Switch Sticks, so I can keep it in my bag and have it if I need it.  And honestly?

If I didn't need it when I first went out, I could have it in my bag/purse and use it when needed.  I felt better using a cane than feeling like I was going to collapse (or actually falling).  I would switch from one side to the other, depending on what felt better/worse at the time.  Get one you like the look of...it helps...a bit.

I worked in a durable medical Supply store for 2 years and helped people fit canes and walkers as well as help them decide what to get!   Most canes are either adjustable or meant to be cut. For proper posture  (which is really important because if you have other issues, we certainly don't want to add neck or back issues) any walking aid should come to your wrist bones. Allowing for the best posture and eliminating wrist issues as well!   As for which side, that is really for people who more have a bad knee/hip more so. This is because you don't want it to slide from underneath you while you have it on your good side and fall on that side and now you have two bad knees or hips instead of one!! I would alternate! Canes are amazing and can be cheap-- about $20.00 I would try that before a cane and see what relief you can get!"
Fibromyalgia,380yj3,kflueg,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:01:57 2015 UTC,"It's a tough mental task to say the least.   I had to use a walker and carry a seat cushion after being in an accident during my undergraduate. Use it with confidence, and eventually that mindset becomes default. Make sure to surround yourself with a positive support group during this time, and make sure to ask for help from your profs and dean of your program. Not only will this make school a more supportive place, but will help you gain connections and letters of recommendation for future goals.  It will be hard to ignore judgmental glares and questions and if you go out to a bar expect some drunk assholes to ask you why. Be prepared with a funny story or say it's really not something that concerns you. Just have an answer you are confident about on the back-burner because people can be nosey and rude.   I went from the walker to a crutches to one crutches to a 4 pronged cane and then a cane. I still have handicap parking, but have worked very hard to relearn to walk and retired my cane. I occasionally need it, and that's okay.  If you have a tough time coping emotionally; it's okay to ask for professional help to learn skills to cope. DBT, dialectical behavior therapy is pretty interesting. I suggest looking into it.   Best of Luck!"

You just described my co-morbid symptoms exactly. Nice to know someone knows what my life is like. As for how to live your life with fibro, the only advice I can give is learn your limits. Know what you can and can't do and work around it. I know that sounds basic and useless advice, but it's the best way to live your life and not push yourself. The worst thing someone with fibro can do is deny it exists, push themselves too hard and not listen to their body. You seem to have a pretty solid handle on things and it's nothing new to you. Try to find a job that fits with what you're capable of. Easier said than done, I know, but it's probably your best goal. Never let fibro rule your life either.

That's good advice, though... know my limits. I've been denying them for a long time.  Another question: how do you not let the guilt of having limits take over? Like having to call out of work, or class, etc.? I find myself constantly apologizing and tripping over words trying to explain myself for recurring issues.

Fibromyalgia,37zzto,Decepticle_Ronnie,3,Sun May 31 23:55:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I hate explaining it. I prefer not to if I can get away with it.

I used to just move them when asked because it avoided a discussion about why a man in his 30s couldn't do it. Now, I'm simply honest and say I can't. I still hate the discussion where I have to go into the whole explanation of what's wrong with me and how it affects me, but sometimes it's necessary. It's worse when people there ask me to do stuff that's outside my limits and they think I'm just lying to them that I can't do this stuff because of my illness. After all, they see me in the venue day after day, appearing happy and normal and they want to know why I can't travel 20 miles to some event they're having. I just explain and hope they understand. I know that some people still think I'm making this shit up, but I can't waste a single moment worrying about those people. Some people think I should just ""buck up and get on with it"", some think I'm full of shit, but, thankfully, some of them understand and are sympathetic. Life ain't easy when you're young and appear healthy, but you have real limitations like ours, but we get through it because we have to. Good luck with wherever life takes you, but just remember to never let it take you somewhere you don't want to be simply because you don't want to express what fibro does to you."

But your obviously very lucky as fibro affects many people in many different levels of severity, while it is true that many of us can function enough to maintain a normalish standard if life, by societies standards but the other side of that is there are MANY suffering deeply from their condition and the general crap that comes with it. For alot of us, getting out of bed and making through a day without enough symptoms happening at the same time that people aren't worried about us is a miracle. Many of us can't function on a level that society accepts and alot of us don't get the help and benefits we need to even fit into society let alone contribute to it.   It's great to hear that your case is a mild one, at least mild enough that you haven't been taken off work or even considered something like disability, I'm in no way attempting to discount your condition and how it affects you. But the truth is is that there are more of us that deserve disability and don't or can't get it and the live life as a constant struggle. Many worse off than I.   Edit.. Spelling and grammar and I'm on a. Phone."

There are people with a ""fibromyalgia"" diagnosis who can function pretty well day-to-day if they take it easy. There are people who can barely leave the house on same days and even a few who actually can't. It affects everyone differently on different levels and it's not fair to assume that everyone with this diagnosis feels the same way as you.

Fibromyalgia,37xikv,Booby_Hatch,0,Sun May 31 21:34:54 2015 UTC,"No one with a ""fibromyalgia"" diagnosis knows what's wrong with them. Even the doctors don't understand what's going on. Fibro is a diagnosis of elimination. It means that your symptoms can't be explained by any know disorders. The researchers that seem to be making headway with attaching HSV1 to symptoms such as these and controlling the symptoms with antivirals and anti-inflammatories are onto something, it seems. I'm sure that this will bring relief for some of us that are suffering from that exact disorder, but I'm sure many others will still be left in the dark. We're all suffering from something, but it's my belief that we're not all suffering from the same thing. As my own doctor wisely told me, the more disorders in this area that are discovered, the more the circle of ""fibromyalgia"" suffers will shrink as more are discovered to suffer from newly discovered disorders. Hopefully we make enough progress in medical science that no one ever has to be given this meaningless diagnosis again."

I really even hate using the term ""fibro"" to describe what's wrong with me (or anyone else), since that word is so vague and useless, as well as having negative connotations. It's obvious that somethingis wrong, but who knows what? I've read that in the majority of people that develop fibromyalgia, it happens after a head or neck injury, which I think is an interesting bit of information. I developed it after a head injury from a bicycle accident. It just seems so hard to believe that it can be totally neurologically based when the physical symptoms are so varied. More research needs to be done!"

I returned a low testosterone level in a urine test once.  Other hormone tests were normal, which my doc said wouldn't be the case if I had low testosterone.  I redid the urine test, using mid-stream morning urine, and it came back normal.  One low testosterone result is not conclusive of a problem on its own.  I am not sure how much of my experience is relevant to you, GMU Hulk.  I have had abnormal liver function test results, which I thought might lead to a diagnosis that would explain my symptoms.  It led to a diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which explained the test results but none of my symptoms.  It is possible that you could have low testosterone and be suffering no symptoms from it whatsoever.  In my experience, it doesn't pay to get your hopes up about an abnormal test result that could lead to a diagnosis and a treatment that can reduce symptoms.

Fibromyalgia,37nk6l,Laur-Ent,2,Fri May 29 17:55:02 2015 UTC,"When did the pain set in? That could be your best clue.  For me, fibro pain always sets in the same day as the activity which set it off, sometimes it carries over to the next day, then gets better.   I was in a serious car accident 7 years ago (prior to getting sick) and I sustained a pelvic injury (twisted hip) and a back sprain. My injuries weren't picked up on straight away though because the pain didn't kick in till the next day. That could also have been because the crash was emotionally traumatic and I was in shock. But I think that's a common thing for people in car accidents (minor or major), the pain and general aching often doesn't set in until the next day. Obviously this doesn't apply to serious injuries, or all people. But it was my experience and I've heard the same thing from lots of people.   I was sore right after it happened and got checked out at the hospital. But it wasn't until the next day that I got the hip and back pain. It was bad, too. It didn't get better so I went to see a physio.   Definitely see your doctor anyway. They'll be able to tell you what's what."

Fibromyalgia,37nk6l,CritterTeacher,3,Fri May 29 08:58:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not a doctor or at all qualified but from my experience, I'd say it's an injury from the accident. I mean the fact that it's getting steadily worse is a red flag. As fibro sufferers we get sort of used to pain and it can lose it's meaning. It's normally the bodies way of telling us something's wrong, but for us it's essentially pointless. We could be getting ""broken leg"" signals when our leg isn't broken. When people experience chronic pain for long enough they can become desensitized. We just have to remember this, and remember that we get sick and injured just like healthy people. And early detection is key to dealing with most illnesses."

Fibromyalgia,37ffth,emberjewel,6,Wed May 27 12:15:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Fibro should almost be it's own specialty. It's not really pain management, it's nerve management (sort of, best way I can describe it). I actually just work my GP, Chiro, and Massage Therapist as a team (plus some hard work of my own on diet and exercise).  EDIT: should have mentioned I started out with a Rheumatologist, who diagnosed me and got me started with some diet and exercise changes, then we moved, I tried a Pain clinic that made it worse, and finally when we bought a house I found a good GP and they are awesome and work with me to help me."
Fibromyalgia,37ffth,lady_skendich,5,Wed May 27 15:18:59 2015 UTC,"I went to a pain management clinic, who basically rubber stamped the dosage of codeine that I was already on (in the form of a letter to my doctor), which made it much easier to get a prescription for codeine.  He also gave me a prescription for a muscle relaxant which has helped.  I spoke to a neurologist about my concerns of being on opioids, and I told him how I was on codeine, which was no longer working, and how I expected tramadol to stop working for me at some point.  He said that if that happens I should switch back to codeine again, and that switching back and forth between opioids often works.  So yes, going to a pain clinic helped me a lot.  If one opioid has stopped working there are others you can try at an equivalent dose, and if that one stops working there is a good chance that the first opioid will work again.  It is not okay that you are suffering so much when there are drugs that will help."
Fibromyalgia,37ffth,FibroMan,2,Wed May 27 14:35:38 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry. You're going through a lot. When times are like this for me, it's hard to see the big picture.  I was first diagnosed with Fibromyalgia in the 90s and I figure I started symptoms in the 60s. I say this because you have a long distance to go.   You're not saying what your dose of tramadol is. I took it as needed, not a certain dose every day. The times in between I'd take an NSAID. Not vicodin.   I'm actually a bit surprised you're taking both together as they both are cleared through the liver. But I'm not a doctor. Your doctor must have a plan.   Fibro is a disorder that is very complicated to treat and because we'll both die with it but not of it, sometimes it feels as if medical folks aren't responsive. But the good thing is that we can help ourselves to be in less pain. It took me years to do what seemed like inconsequential things that added up. We all must sleep and it takes some time to change conditions to let that happen. I had to change so much in my life so I could sleep, not just in spite of the pain but to avoid pain the next day.   While you're in this much pain this may sound as if I'm discounting your situation but I'm not. With all my efforts to help myself to avoid both NSAIDS and narcotics I'm still coping with renal failure directly tied to the years of NSAID use. You're presently taking two meds that go through your liver.   A mistake I made was not to go to the doctor enough. It takes a certain length of time and intensity of pain before you're diagnosed with chronic pain and pain management is recommended. A good pain doctor does not, in my experience, just get you more narcotics. My treatment involved physical therapy, instructions on how to move, rise and sit and massage.   So, my suggestion for you is to go back to the doctor and get more details about the meds you are on. Ask questions about how long the Dr. thinks it will take for the meds to kick in. And, you need help with sleep. And how to exercise and stretch without hurting yourself.   You can't see around corners right now so you will benefit from a good doctor, physical therapy and forums like this."
Fibromyalgia,37ffth,first52,2,Wed May 27 14:35:45 2015 UTC,What everyone is saying is true. It will make your pain worse over time. But its not because its fibromyalgia pain over another type of pain. This happens when you take opoids period. Its called opoid induced hyperalgesia.   But the choice has to be yours to make. It will make things better in the short term. I took opoids for 5 years. They helped for 4. You may also want to look into MMJ depending where you live.
Fibromyalgia,37ffth,peanutgallerie,1 point,Wed May 27 18:27:34 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat. Took oxycontin for about 5 years and realized that it really wasn't helping anymore. The doctor wouldn't help me get off it (no idea why, he said ""well you've been on it a long time, best to just stick with it O_o) but I managed to get him to give me oxycodone so I could control the dosage and get myself weaned off. After the withdrawal was over (and boy was it terrible) my constant pain level actually improved a lot, at least a couple of points on the pain scale.  So yeah, I personally would not recommend opioids for fibro pain. Me back then might have thought it was worth it, but me now remembers stress of having to plan my life around getting to the doc to get my prescription every month, trying to get the prescription filled and worrying when the pharmacies didn't have it available, feeling like an addict, the withdrawal... etc."
Fibromyalgia,37ffth,loradion,2,Wed May 27 21:52:49 2015 UTC,"This is a serious question, are you willing to consider medical cannabis?"
Fibromyalgia,37ffth,PeacefulTreeLand,1 point,Wed May 27 18:43:02 2015 UTC,I would love to try it but have no way of getting it. Although I am moving this weekend to a place that is on the border to a state that has it legally. So I may just try that. I've often thought that medical marijauna would work or at least help.
Fibromyalgia,37ffth,DjGhettoSteve,1 point,Wed May 27 19:02:02 2015 UTC,"I've gone through that medication carousel for almost a decade now & the pain created by the various narcotics and opioids was worse than the original pain, so I highly recommend getting off those before that kicks in (if it hasn't yet). Neuroleptics have been the only pharmaceutical class of drugs that helps with the pain, along with wellbutrin as an adjuvent (I'm bipolar as well, so I'd be on that either way). Mine is related to numerous incidents of spinal trauma & a half dozen spinal fractures when I was in college, and I'm of the opinion that mode of onset likely has a large impact on what treatments works, so take that with a grain of salt. After stopping all the pain meds and muscle relaxants, I replaced it all with cannabis products: salve for spot treatment of spasms, inflammation, etc; candies for widespread pain when I need to keep a clear head (cbn/cbd dominant, low thc to reduce psychotropic effects), vaporizer and normal smoking for insomnia & extreme pain. It's been incredible, I'm so fortunate to live in CO, hopefully the rest of the states won't take too long to catch up."
Fibromyalgia,37ffth,polarbearhero,1 point,Wed May 27 19:21:32 2015 UTC,I live in Washington State so legality is not a problem for me. In fact there are quite a few stores within a mile of the house selling cannabis products. Could you be more specific about what to ask for in the store? I can't smoke so it would have to be edibles/topicals. It sounds dumb but I feel very self conscious about going into one of the stores and I would appreciate any suggestions you could offer. I've never tried any kind of recreational drug in my life and I'm retired but the leg pain (I have FM & RLS) is getting close to unbearable and I'm unable to work.
Fibromyalgia,37ffth,DjGhettoSteve,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:45:45 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! I'm sure the ""brands"" are different over there, but I use Mary Jane's Medicinals salve [www.maryjanesmedicinals.com], TerpPen oil vaporizer, gummy candies by EdiPure [www.edipure.com], sour hard candies by Gaia's Garden [www.Gaiasgardengroup.com]  I have a lower than usual tolerance lately, haven't been using as much (last several weeks have been really good, waiting to see how long that lasts...) and 10-25mg PRN has been a moderate dosage. They take a few hours to kick in, but then last 6 hours or so.   The salve is like some crazy old southern hillbilly cure that helps everything from muscle spasms, localized pain, headaches, sunburn, inflammation, poor circulation, menstrual cramps (have personally used it for all of the above). the pain killing effects are not like rubbing Novocaine gel or using a lidocaine patch. It doesn't numb, it just decreases the actual pain sensations. They have a liquid roll-on with extra mint oil that's basically ""head-on"" but replace the capzacin with cannabis.   I haven't been able to find a site that describes the TerpPen, but it's an excellent alternative to smoking that starts working faster than edibles & includes more of the psychotropic effects (sleepiness, anti-anxiety, etc). There are a lot of vaporizer concentrates, most are a glucose base but the TerpPen are solvent based (can't remember if it's co2 or hexane) & are a much cleaner type of concentrate (not harsh on your throat, tastes better).  The actual TerpPen itself looks like a fat pen with a small clear tank & plastic tip (like black & mild's).   Some terms to keep in mind: *sativa & indica are the two basic types of cannabis. In layman's terms, sativa is higher energy/felt more in the head & indica is sleepier/felt more in the body.  *thc - primary psychoactive compound, but aids in the efficacy of other compounds (like vitamin d & calcium)  *CBN & cbd - the two primary non-psychoactive compounds that do most of the medical benefits. The oil they use for seizure disorders & cancer tumors is largely cbd/cbn.  Stuff to stay away from: *sodas and other drinks (except tea/coffee) are almost always totally useless & a waste of money. The hot steeped drinks activate the compounds properly.  *lotions, lip balm, facial mist, and other cosmetic products. No active cannabis effects, just insanely expensive/hipster products.

One of the diseases they have listed that they work with is fibro. I'm goin to hopefully be able to get some. Even if I have to pay out of pocket.

I basically see three doctors now - my rheumatologist, my psychologist, and my anesthesiologist at a pain clinic. The problem with pain management is you really have to find an excellent doctor. I was lucky enough to get a recommendation from my old GP. There are bad doctors even at my practice.  I started going before I had fibromyalgia for an unrelated problem, but he's been helpful for both my fibromyalgia and my rheumatoid arthritis (my rheumatologist wouldn't give me an anti inflammatory he wanted me to get it from another doctor).   I was already on pain medication, so when I was having trouble managing everything, we simply increased the dose. I know many people say pain meds don't help, but if it's working for you. I know mine have helped me but I also have multiple diseases battling with each other. I am on some regular fibro meds as well though so the pain meds are backup almost. What are you on besides the vicodin? Nothing?"
Fibromyalgia,37ffth,thrashglam,1 point,Wed May 27 17:34:25 2015 UTC,Tramadol but it really doesn't help and we increased the dose and it made me sick. I've tried all the other fibro meds and none of them worked. All I got were some nasty side effects.
Fibromyalgia,37ffth,anothermomhere,1 point,Wed May 27 18:57:23 2015 UTC,Atm I'm on tramadol. I don't have any Vicodin right now. I just know that when I went into the dr. Two months ago because of the pain he gave me a script for a few. That's when I tried the dose in the morning and late afternoon.  I found relief. With the tramadol we tried upping the dose but it made me incredibly sick. We even did it in little increments still got sick. So right now o take 200mg of it in the mornings and that's all.
Fibromyalgia,37ffth,auntiechrist23,1 point,Wed May 27 19:05:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah tramadol gives me awful rebound headaches if I take too much of it so I feel you. I think I had to give it up at 100mg a day. See if you can get a recommendation by your GP since he doesn't want to prescribe for you to someone good. It's definitely a good idea to have pain management in your corner because when/if the vicodin stops working, you'll have been there a while and have an idea where to go next."

When you go to get your medical marijuana, be aware of a couple of things: there are various kinds of strains of marijuana, just like there are different types of pain medication. Indica strains are better suited for people who need something to help them sleep (for the mind), Sativa strains are more for your body. I use an Indica strain at night, and Sativa during the day. There are also a variety of ways to consume THC, I highly suggest a vape pen as it is just oil and does not produce the same amount of smell/smoke as dry flower, or edibles, which you can keep in the fridge and are very discreet and last a while.   I am confident that the MMJ will help your mood as well as your pain. My depression and anxiety are definitely lessened once I get in bed and smoke a little. Good luck my friend!"

I realized I was having fun with my kids and it was because I wasn't in pain and done within the first hour of an adventure.   If I were you, I would do a wheelchair or scooter when out in public, or do a full walker with a seat. In the house I would use a cane and a walker as needed.   These are safety tools. You cannot safely walk without huge risk of fall. Plus, there is no way you can exercise and build strength if you are constantly trying to recover from everyday tasks. Use the tools to remove the worst of the physical tasks you have to do, so you will have the strength to build your muscles up safely."

I don't  know you and I've never seen you walk but from what you're saying it sounds like a walker might be a little bit more stable for you! Canes are a little bit more convenient most of the time, but if you have serious dizziness it might not be enough support to prevent you from falling especially if you fall to the side the cane is not on. A lot of people do really well with a walker with four wheels because they can walk at a normal speed and they can also sit down if they need to because it has a seat if you get dizzy or get tunnel vision. However one of the downfalls to Walker is that they are difficult to use on stairs so you would have to use room to avoid them.  Many of the walkers a.k.a. Rollator are fairly light and fold up really easily."

Experienced something similar and it turned out to be my back (weird right). I went to physical therapy and they had me do core and back exercises. In the meantime you could try a few back exercises and see if it relieves any of the pain. I noticed right away when doing the exercises that I felt mild relief.   Wish I could do more to help out.

Cold objects feel like someone searing me with a hot iron.  Cold air feels like someone sanding the living crap out of my skin with the roughest grade sandpaper you can think of.  When I take the object away, the sensation lasts for a minute or two.  Then it subsides into an intense stinging for another 2 mins.  I don't really have flare ups (it's 24/7 pain, no relief), so I don't know if they would go away if the pain wasn't active.  My legs in general have varying degrees of sensation throughout.  All of it dulled, but some more dull than others.  There are spots that are so dull that I can't tell the difference between sharp and dull.  I just feel pressure.  As for the cause, the pain neurologist seems to think it may be related to being on opioid medication for too long (MS Contin).  It is most likely permanent now.  I've been off of contin since Jan/Feb.  Whether it is actually related, or if it is just a natural progression isn't clear though."

That's just the physical, here's the psychological part: In order to feel better, I'd have to move around and exercise, but not too much, because then it'll be 100% worse the next day. Then being hungry and thirsty and having to pee because I didn't want to get out of bed. Not being able to concentrate well because the pain is like a little kid saying ""im not poking you im not touching you im not poking you"". Just as annoying even though he's not poking you.

I ask because  it can really help to have a positive outlet for energy and also, when you have been beaten down in the work place let we have, it is an amazing feeling to accomplish a project. Also, it gives back to your mom. It can be as simple as happiness, or, you can try to find projects that can help out finically. Does the yard need improvement, or a car worked on. There is still time for a garden, small and simple but grow something you all eat. Become the family chef, plan out the meals and do all the shop and prep work and clean up. Bonus is you can help reduce and control the budget, bonus for your mom is one less thing she has to worry about.

According to the available evidence, pregabalin, duloxetine and milnacipran should be the drugs of choice for the treatment of this disease, followed by amitriptyline and cyclobenzaprine. Other drugs with at least one positive clinical trial include some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, moclobemide, pirlindole, gabapentin, tramadol, tropisetron, sodium oxybate and nabilone. None of the currently available drugs are fully effective against the whole spectrum of fibromyalgia symptoms, namely pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances and depression, among the most relevant symptoms."

The first time I took Lyrica it caused me to have huge difficulties remembering proper nouns, i.e., peoples names, names of things (think 'refridgerator').  Second time I took it, great result.  Tramadol, when I took it because Pain Specialists were trying to convince me not to take Norco yet would not give me the equivalent in pain contol, didn't do aything.  However, when I used it in the proper amounts necessary to stave off withdrawal and keep pain away it not only worked but helped me quit Norco which I'd been on for over 15 yrs.  Amitriptyline is great for sleep, but get EKG's.. your heart could become affected.  Good luck to all fellow fibromites!"

Fibromyalgia,36uwjc,EternalOptimist829,5,Fri May 22 09:11:34 2015 UTC,"Fibromyalgia is not a diagnosis that you want. If you haven't already, ask to be tested for vitamin d deficiency,  lyme, low testosterone (if you're male), lupus, gout, and arthritis. All of these can be done as a blood test, are easier to treat than fibromyalgia, and have similar symptoms.

Oddly it feels kind of like I were to try and stretch every muscle in my body the soreness might go away but I do the stretches and it doesn't matter.  My ""gameplan"" is to see about being put on an antidepressant as truth be told I've also been pretty depressed lately, too.  I thought maybe if that works we could go from there.  I don't need to be diagnosed with anything if I can take a medicine that possibly helps with both."

I have not gained fat, but I have put on a little muscle because I have been working out regularly since before I started the medication.  If you are not on a workout regiment, you might consider one - I have severe anxiety problems, and between that and the medication helping to manage my pain, I feel better than I have in years.  I had to start really easy....just walking around for more than a few minutes was tiresome, but now I am strength training regularly and slowly upping my weights.  It helps control my anxiety too.  When I am feeling nervous, I use it to focus my energy into something more positive.  As far as bloat goes, I have issues with that due to fructose intolerance or malabsorption (doctors do not know which).  You might try taking a look at the FODMAP diet for information on inflammatory foods (they can cause bloating in everyone to some degree), and you could try cutting down on those types of foods.

Your wife has serious issues and the relationship is toxic. You do not need that toxicity in your life - she has placed blame on you and you are shouldering it needlessly. If it were switched and a man was treating you horribly societal expectations would be he is a bully and you need to leave. This is no different, you are being bullied and deserve far better. Being alone at this point is healthier for you than with someone who treats you in this manner. There is no place for mental manipulation or physical violence in a marriage, period the end.

I would love to move and set up my life in a way that helps my fibro and in a way that I have an amazing life. I don't have that now, because I was actively living a completely different life.

I found the courts DO NOT CARE. it didn't matter that i was the victim of assault, they did not care that i was the one who raised the kids. Or i was the one that was cheated on.  The divorce court used the fact that i was disabled to refuse me custody. He said that if there is a emergancy i would not be able to pull the kids out. i said i could but he didn't believe it. So he gave my wife custody. Though in turn she ended up giving me more then 50% of the time (around 90%). the guy she was ""dateing"" did not like children.  I started looking for help on food, shelter, etc. Food stamps gave me  $18 a month. since i was single and made $1100 (200 was going to my ex wife for custody payments). I was told by section 8 that since i did not have custody of the kids i was at the bottom of the list. women with kids was first. then women. then disabled..So i wouldn't have a place to live.  Then my wife went to court and said if i moved out of the small town we live in She gets full custody. the fucking judge agreed.  I was faced with losing my home and worse my kids. so when she asked me back  i did..

Then the next day I'm fine. Not sore even. So I learned to take a break on these days instead of leaving sore and I hop on the bike and wait it out.  Then I can usually do at least 2 more sets. I know that physiotherapists have told me that my muscles are super humanly taught (tight). They suggested that because of this, they are unable to strengthen and properly function. I kind of imagine that this is what happens on those days. Hot baths and very very mild stretching helps me."

Fibromyalgia,36n6am,chadi7,3,Wed May 20 16:56:14 2015 UTC,"My routine is a 3 day cycle. I rotate between 1) core 2) arms and 3) legs  In the first week I had to find how much weight to start with at the different machines. I wrote them down once I figured them out. I started at 15lbs with bicep curl, for example, but I'm at 100lbs for the ab crunch machine. I do 3 sets of 10 and these sets, I basically want to be maxed out by number 8 or 9. If necessary, I lower the weight by 5 lbs for the next set until I'm maxed out again.   I'm basically aiming for higher weight and fewer reps. But of course...I have fibro so my weight is low comparatively. I'm looking to prioritize acquiring mass over strength in the beginning because I want to increase my metabolism and have more to support my joints. Strength comes with it and I'll probably do more strength training later. I like the fewer reps anyway because the short bursts are more manageable for me physically and mentally.   I also either walk to the gym or hop on the elliptical/bike to get my blood going each time before lifting anything :)"

At one point I was weightlifting regularly and I can say that it did help with pain. However, I was absolutely exhausted and had no energy left for anything else in my life (and this was about 4 hours a week max of weightlifting). My recovery was also terrible, and after a while the maximum weight I could lift started going down instead of up. I'd be able to lift less weight than the previous session no matter if I rested one day, two days, three, a week... not sure what happened.  I'm glad that you're having more success and I suppose it speaks to the variability inherent in fibro. But if you do have issues with fatigue then please be extra careful."

So even though I'm pretty sure I have CFS and Reynaud's, they are technically undiagnosed. This is also because my doc told me this diagnosis doesn't ""help"" in anyway because it's not really treatable. That was her opinion. She's also all for my weight-lifting though.   I DO experience post-exertional malaise. I'm experiencing it today. I've been walking 5 miles every day while the gym has been closed and today my whole body was useless. I still had to do the walk to work and it was agony. I felt out of breath the entire time. I started feeling it last night and I went to bed with heating patches on.   Honestly...I fight through it. I don't know if it's good for me. What I do know is that I get stronger. I can walk further, for longer. I'm getting sore more often, but fibro pain is lessening. It's addicting, this feeling of subsiding fibro pain so I'm chasing it and I'm continuing.   My doctors can't help much. I've had this all my life but was only diagnosed recently (last year) so I've been a stubborn toddler about treatment. I hate when people tell me I'm unable or probably can't do certain things. Though, before my diagnosis, life was like fighting in the dark. After the diagnosis, the lights are on and I'm sitting here, looking fibro in the face. At least I can see my enemy now.   With that dramatic nonsense being said, I'm ruthless in the gym. I fight through about 85% of the pain. The other 15% I spend sitting in a hot bath. I don't know if this makes sense, but I know that a lot of the pain is ""not real"" in a sense that my nerves are just over-reacting. Telling myself that ""this too shall pass"" is what helps me keep a routine consistent. With this approach, I'm never down for the count for longer than 12 hours.   I will also feel spent for the rest of the day if I experience the malaise, but if I have things to accomplish like chores or practicing or work, I do them in short bursts. I take breaks. I give myself the opportunity to rest. But I also have this feeling in my gut that it's better to keep going than to give in.   This is my approach. I know it's unique to some people. It sounds scary and sometimes it's scary to me too. But the feeling of inspiration is stronger than fear. So onwards.   edit: TL;DR: THIS IS SPARTA!!! -kicks fibro into a pit-"

When I told my allergist that I get really itchy during exercise (or in direct sunlight, wind, long exposure to water, temperature changes, etc. etc. lol) and he suggested daily cetirizine (Zyrtec). Frankly it hasn't helped with the itching much, but what I was really surprised by is that it seemed to cut my post-exertional malaise in half--although without increasing my baseline energy level. It's only been a month so it might just be a coincidence.  I used to use that same idea of the pain not being ""real"" when I was a kid (I haven't had fibro my whole life, but since I was about 8).

My advise to you is to keep going for as long as you can.  Just be careful. Pay attention to your body. There will be days when you feel really bad, so make sure you rest (the epson salt baths are great btw). But, thankfully, there will still be days when you feel awesome. Take those days when you can.

Fibromyalgia,36nsm1,spiderdust,2,Wed May 20 20:20:40 2015 UTC,"I use neem oil regularly for my difficult skin. I have eczema and my fibro meds tend to inflame it. Neem oil is smelly but works very well and saves me hundred of dollars in prescription ointments. I also use eucalyptus oil applied to the forehead for nasal congestion.  Oil and extracts can be used as medicine but requires the same research as you would do when changing prescriptions. When doing such research, I usually start with articles published in the Netherlands or Germany. There is a lot of peer-reviewed research on alternative medicine originating from there and available in English.  Find out what recommended dosage is, what is the duration you can safely take that dosage, if you can overdose and what part of the plant/animal the remedy is suppose to use. You also need to learn how to test for purity. Many remedies have a distinct odor and also gives your body a distinct odor after continued use. Beware of claims or odorlessness. Many remedies need to be combined with something else to produce the desired reaction in the body. You'll have to find out that something else and change your diet accordingly.  NEVER PURCHASE MIXES FROM A VENDOR. Learn to mix the oils you want yourself or find a qualified apothecary or practitioner of Chinese medicine that will mix exactly what you need when you need it."

I have had some success with these ones especially- ylang ylang, lavender, roman chammomile, vetiver, and neroli for anxiety. Peppermint has helped some pain,headaches and indigestion. Always always always research before you buy. Neroli is a citrus so you never wear it when you go out in the sun. Peppermint is strong and you can easily over do it. Always use just a few drops in a carrier oil like almond oil. Test on a small patch before. You can find out the hard way you are allergic especially with flower ones like chammomile. Don't use them long term. Always take breaks where you are using them. I find they help me a lot but they are not in place of regular medicine. Some oils like St. John's wort oil shouldn't be used if you are on medication as it could diminish it. Don't be scared to try them- but be cautious and do lots of research. They smell so good and can make you feel a little bit less frazzled! Oh and never ingest them despite what some companies say."

I've been on high doses of vitamin d (along with magnesium) for a while now and definitely notice a huge difference. Particularly when I forget to take it. Magnesium is important to take with vitamin d. It helps your body absorb it.
Fibromyalgia,36l7i6,HannahSolo23,1 point,Wed May 20 05:45:23 2015 UTC,"Vitamin K is also important to be getting enough of, it also has calcium regulating effects. D and K should go hand in hand."
Fibromyalgia,36fea7,br0itskatie,3,Mon May 18 23:28:15 2015 UTC,"The only thing that hurts more then having low Vit D levels is, increasing your levels. Here is my common man understanding. When your vit d is low it causes your bones to leach calcium into your muscles. When you start taking the Vit d pills you rapidly pull that calcium back out of the muscles, but you also pull a ton of water too, cause your bones to swell. It takes a while for things to equalize.   Did they check your magnesium levels too? A lot of time low magnesium goes hand in hand and taking magnesium supplements can help with stabilizing your equalizing."

The 50K U per week should only be temporary to get you caught up.  After 4 weeks of that, then you should go to the regular daily supplements that include D-3 (even though your 50K U is probably D-2).  I think taking the sublingual supplement is best, along with a vitamin B Complex, because you get much more bang for your buck compared to pills."
Fibromyalgia,36fea7,Booby_Hatch,2,Tue May 19 05:56:02 2015 UTC,"This is all bringing back memories of the flair up I assumed I was having after being put on the 1x per week mega dose, (100,000UI or something stupid?!) for 10 weeks, then they reduced it. That was last year.. I recently spoke to my doc because my latest Vit D test came back ""inconclusive"" - She told me that apparently here in the UK now the hospitals don't even bother to actually test the blood because it's cheaper/easier for them to just assume that EVERYONE has low vit D levels anyway and just to treat them for it. Blood stealing weirdos! :) I suppose that's what happens when you live in a country primarily made up of clouds and grey.

Last year I went to an orthopedic surgeon because of unexplained pains I was having throughout my body (my arms at times feel like they are being pulled off my body, and when it's that bad and I am curled up crying, I wish they were…) and after a few months of back and forth with him (tramadol made it worse, gabapentin made it better, but didn't help me sleep, nothing was wrong on any of my blood tests or x-rays) he gave me Lyrica.  It was a last ditch effort on his part and he said ""I'll be honest, I don't tell many people this, because most of the time it doesn't fit, but you very well may be the rare bird with Fibro"".  After being on Lyrica for about a month everything seemed to get better, my mood was noticeably improved, my energy levels were improved, I could go to work almost every day free of most of the pain, but the spasms and twitching got in the way, and eventually I was fired because I was incapable of meeting the physical demand.  After that, things went down hill fast.  The lyrica helps a bunch, but costs me about 150$ a month, and I cannot afford that.  Last night I was up all night, I can't seem to stay in any position for longer than 15 minutes without intolerable pain and a need to move and/or switch position. Today, (about a half week since my last dose of lyrica) I am back to how I have been feeling the past three years.  I feel like I have missed out on so many great opportunities (friends, family, employment) because I simply cannot predict if I am going to not poop, poop normally, or if it is going to be one of the days where I am (as I am now) on the toilet."

In fact, that's what just happened to me. You'll probalby need a colonoscopy. The procedure isn't bad. The prep sucks. But I have some tips if you end up needing that so let me know. But you should really get yourself to a gastroenterologist ASAP.   As not fun as this is, try changing your diet to super bland boring couldn't upset a baby's stomach type of food. I think common triggers can be gluten, dairy and wheat. I'd check out r/crohnsdisease to poke around and see what helps them. Keep a record of your symptoms and what you've eaten, that might help. If you have some case of IBD there's a lot of treatments you can try!   As a personal aside, my issues flared up right at the start of my new internship last January, and I would be in the bathroom 5-10 times a day, it was annoying. There was a bitchy woman who sat by the bathroom and always glared at me. Just ignore all that stuff, you gotta do you. Have you tried any over the counter remedies? I kept a heating pad at my desk for when I got stomach cramps. There are also over the counter creams to help if you get sore down there from wiping or bleeding. Or simply vaseline can help too.

I've removed many individual ingredients from my diet in an effort to pinpoint which ones were causing the disturbance, but it seems like the disturbance is day to day living rather than a specific ingredient as the symptoms occur always.  I get so worked up, so anxious, I end up pooping from all the excitement, Lyrica has helped, but when it's one of those days, it's going to be one of those days.

I've spent the last 7 years taking a handful of Imodium per day, but I've never had blood.  So, step one. Doctor. Even if you struggle finding the money, what if it's something that gets worse? It'll just get more expensive on top of being worse.   Step two. Try autoimmune paleo or FODMAP. I've heard good things about both, although I'm already on a restrictive enough diet from food intolerances that I haven't personally tried them.   And step three. Exercise. I know that's one of those things that we scoff at and think if we were capable of it, we wouldn't be sick. But remember me saying I've had IBS for a long time now? I used to take upwards of 5 Imodium a day - I haven't taken one in over 2 weeks. In fact, I was just at my gastroenterologist today, and he believes that it's because I've done a lot of exercise in the past 3 months (because I'm using that as my pain management), and exercise can stabilize your GI tract.  Seriously, though, I hope you start doing better. :)"

I've only had issues when I've strayed from it, which I do too often.   I also use peppermint oil drops that seem to help reduce the IBS symptoms, but exercise has helped the most. It is a challenge and some weeks I can't, those weeks my IBS gets worse. I've very slowly built myself up walking 1.5 miles or more per work day over six months. I'm now capable of short jogging sprints and a little swimming.   I was on dicyclomine for a while. It seemed to work well, except for stomach aches in the morning, heart burn, and fatigue. I didn't know it made my fatigue worse until I ran out and the fatigue, which has plagued me for years, mostly went away.

Fibromyalgia,36em5q,MsStorm,1 point,Mon May 18 21:27:57 2015 UTC,"Bloody stool is something you need to have checked out by a doctor. If it's black that can be a sign of bleeding in the GI tract where red blood is typically less serious as its source is much lower and the wound often heals with a few days of regularity. Either way you should have this looked at by a physician to rule out more severe problems. It's probable you'll want/need to see a gastroenterology specialist at some point to get on the right course of action to minimize symptoms.  I was diagnosed with IBS more than 25 years ago. I most control my symptoms through diet and exercise. My problem foods have evolved over the years. I was hospitalized as a preteen prior to my diagnosis due to severe dehydration. Once I was off caffeine the difference was instant and dramatic. At this point, I have to minimize my fiber intake and cannot tolerate a low carb diet. Breads, alcohol and some spice combinations are at times a problem as well."

I wonder if there is something you could add or eliminate in your diet to help with the symptoms? Maybe talk to your GP or see a gastroenterologist to see if there is something that could help. My mom also deals with IBS as a fibro symptom, and has had a lot of success with a naturopathic physician. No dairy, no wheat, no sugar, no soy... But it works for her."

For more immediate relief, try looking into the FODMAP diet.  It removes inflammatory foods and common allergens.  Yes, it isn't exciting food, but you need to let your tract heal, and this may be a way to do it.  I have extremely severe ""IBS""....I hypothesize it is actually fructose intolerance or malabsorption, because when I cut all fructose and sucrose out of my diet  (as well as related sugars like fructans and oliosaccharides), I am able to not spend hours on the toilet.

I'm going to give you the best advice I think anyone with fibro can hear: Learn to accept that you have it and learn your limits. I know that this can be nearly impossible for some people and it wasn't easy for me either. Fuck, I'm still stubborn and push myself sometimes and I fucking pay for it. I'm only in my early 30s and I was always thin, adventurous and athletic in my younger days. To accept that I can't do many of the things I want in life was tough for me. I can barely do the basics of every day life. Essentially, you have to learn that you have a disability and that you're not like everyone else. All the work you're doing is not helping the situation and may even be the root cause of the flare-ups. It's well known that physical and mental stress can trigger symptoms and it sounds like you've got a big daily helping of both. It's scary having to adjust your life in this way and it usually has an impact on people financially. I think any decent doctor will tell you that 80 hour work weeks, coupled with fibro, equals a bad fucking time. You're going to need help. Avoid heavy lifting, rest as often as you can, both mentally and physically and, most important of all, learn what your warning signs are and listen to your body. Find something to help you relax and clear your mind. I don't really do meditation or anything like that, but I've found that 15 minutes sitting comfortably in silence and breathing slowly and clearing my mind can make a difference, as can gentle exercise every day. In short, if you want this to get easier, big changes are needed. This is not going to away any time soon and the longer you don't make the necessary changes, the longer you're going to feel like shit inside and out. You're unlikely to ever feel 'normal' again, but you can limit the impact it has on you with changes. I'm sorry to hear you're going through all this. We all are. We understand and you have support here if you need help or advice. It's a long, tough road but things will get better."

You're unlikely to have the life you want, but life can improve with management. What works is individual for you. Try everything you can and find what works for you. Some people have had success with medication, so you might want to discuss with a specialist what your options are in that department. Good luck. :)"
Fibromyalgia,36cg96,Decepticle_Ronnie,1 point,Mon May 18 08:22:50 2015 UTC,"Oh Man! Your business partner needs to read up on spoon theory and some of the more recent studies that demonstrate how bad and how REAL fibro is... If she gets defensive just say:  ""I want to be able to do the best I can for our business, which means I need you to try to understand a couple of things, so that we can move forward together and make this work - We've both got health issues so for the sake of our company's success, we need to understand each other's situation. I work very hard and that's not going to change, but I would really appreciate it if you take the time to read a couple of things for me..""   Personally, I think venting and getting angry sometimes can be very helpful, like anti-meditation (which is also good, don't get me wrong!). It's all part of the coping mechanisms you're developing, so try not to feel guilty about what's a totally natural and justifiable reaction to a shitty situation.   Good luck with your business, it sounds really cool and I hope you get some respite soon - Take care :)"
Fibromyalgia,36cg96,JoLOLokia,3,Mon May 18 09:03:21 2015 UTC,"idk man, when I was a kid the teachers would always be scolding me for being more tired than my classmates. Everyone wants to make it feel like they have it just as bad as you do. They're afraid of other people getting special treatment.  Salonpas pads work nice, they have one of the ingredients of aspirin(oil of evergreen), some camphor, and some menthol so they're very cold and you don't build up a tolerance to them like you do with capsaicin. You can't use them if you're allergic to aspirin or cranberry juice though."
Fibromyalgia,36cg96,PrimaDonne,3,Tue May 19 10:21:53 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to sound like I'm just plugging my particular mode of medicine here or anything, but I seriously think you would benefit immensely if you treat yourself to some chinese acupuncture.   They won't have a miracle cure for your fibro, but headaches, stress, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, shoulder tension, and maybe even the IBS are all part of a pattern that I've personally seen acupuncture work wonders for. Relaxation is one of the things acupuncture does best. Assuming your acupuncturist has even the most basic idea of what they're doing, if you go in with these symptoms as your main complaints, I give you my word that you'll feel spectacularly better after a session. Besides, you've dragged yourself around for years and finally got a diagnosis. Surely you deserve some special treatment after all that shit, eh?  Oh, and I know nobody wants to hear this, but I don't recommend alcohol. It's going to have the opposite effect and simply exascerbate the symptoms I listed above... :("
Fibromyalgia,36cg96,Jawzper,1 point,Mon May 18 17:54:38 2015 UTC,"A mate of mine has fibro too and swears by acupuncture, I'll look into it. As for the alcohol thing - seeing as I've made wine my life's work, that's prob not gonna happen anytime soon... ;) If it helps to know, though, I have 2-3 alcohol-free days a week and when I do drink, it's usually no more than 2 glasses of wine. I'll have more than that maybe once a fortnight. I've never noticed that I feel worse fibro-wise when I've had a bit more than usual, though, so it mightn't be a trigger for me as it could be for some others."
Fibromyalgia,36cg96,Jawzper,1 point,Mon May 18 15:18:09 2015 UTC,"it wouldn't likely have an impact on your fatigue and general pain, i'm talking about the extra symptoms i mentioned. in chinese medicine, when the liver has to frequently be doing extra work (we call this liver heat), it often ends up leading to those symptoms (headaches/migraines, stress, insomnia, etc).  like i said, we can treat this pretty well with acupuncture, but unless you cut down on (or at least really minimize) the cause, the symptoms are probably going to keep coming back. just be mindful! fibro is evidence that your body isn't functioning optimally. feeding it alcohol doesn't make symptom management easier."
Fibromyalgia,36cg96,Merkinfumble,1 point,Mon May 18 22:32:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.  Acupuncture has helped me a lot over the years, dealing with the extra symptoms of fibro."
Fibromyalgia,36cg96,JoLOLokia,1 point,Tue May 19 13:34:28 2015 UTC,"I've had a few acupuncture sessions now and it really does work for me, more than anything else I've tried.  I decided to come off the massive list of meds I was on and go natural, acupuncture has not only helped me to relax, but it does ease a lot of my symptoms. I seem to get quite emotional afterwards, I wonder if it's ""released energy"", I don't know, I just agree and think it could help a lot of people!  Can I ask, did you drink before and then stop? What effect did it have? I don't drink much (quantity wise) but I do drink more days than I should and I'm worried it's turning into a sleep-aid self medication thing rather than an enjoyable social activity... Any advice/thoughts would be very welcome.."
Fibromyalgia,36cg96,Jawzper,1 point,Tue May 19 03:11:15 2015 UTC,"In case you're wondering... getting emotional after an acupuncture treatment isn't unusual. If some emotional energy has been stagnating (the emotions may have been suppressed or ignored or simply not dealt with properly), it can eventually lead to physical symptoms. So if somebody has this kind of stagnation, we do what we can to get that energy moving again. That stuck energy starts flowing again, which can make the patient emotional afterwards... but this is a good thing. It's an opportunity to process those emotions properly, and let them go. Try and figure out where they originally came from, and move on. After those emotions are processed, you'll feel a lot better... lighter, unburdened.  As for drinking, I used be a bit of a party animal, so I drank a lot fairly frequently. I haven't stopped drinking entirely because I don't get the symptoms I was talking about myself, but I save it only for social occasions and limit it to once or twice a week at most. It's counterproductive to recovery, but that doesn't mean I can't indulge once in a while.   I think it's important to avoid using it as a medication of any kind, because it's both harmful and habit forming. Alcohol dependency isn't a hole you want to fall into. If you need sleep aids there are much better options.   Here's my go-to advice for insomnia: Dim the lights and avoid bright screens (computer, TV, phone, etc) for an hour or so before you go to sleep. Read a book or something else that doesn't trick your brain into thinking you're staring at the sun. Enjoy a nice cup of sedative valerian tea before you hit the bed. A magnesium supplement may also help if muscle tension is hindering your sleep. Kava is useful if pain is hindering your sleep. Melatonin is useful as a last resort.  Oh, and this one's huge for pain and tension: self-massage. Even if you don't really know what you're doing, just give yourself a bit of a rub down when you're lying in bed to go to sleep. Just be mindful not to overdo it, your arms will get tired. Thank them kindly in the morning after you've had a nice rest."
Fibromyalgia,36cg96,JoLOLokia,2,Tue May 19 10:29:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your thoughtful response - I definitely agree and understand the emotional release a lot more now. In my case there's a lot of anxiety and self criticism along with the physical symptoms and pain, so with the ""letting go"" of that negativity which acupuncture allows, it almost feels like ""am I allowed to do it? Is it ok to feel this relaxed and energised?"" But it's truly liberating.   It's funny you mentioned self massage, I have been trying to do this everyday for a while. My current acupuncture dude is also a chiropractor so I get a ""2 for the price of 1"" sort of deal. Last session he did some deep muscle massage, he basically dug 3 fingers in hard around my pectorals, back and shoulders and down my sternum, my GOD it hurt! That was last Thursday and it still hurts a bit, I thought he'd gone WAY too far but actually I feel like I can sense my body again in those areas, like I'm waking up in ways I haven't for a very long time.   I appreciate your sleep-hygiene advice too, I take magnesium and valerian (but in tablet form) and am working on it all - My REM disorder is a nightmare though, I sleep with my arms stuck straight up in the air like a zombie, banging them backwards onto my headboard over and over through the night (so tired arms are a constant anyway!) and (according to my sleep analysis app) don't go into stage 3/4 (deep) sleep, but that's another story - I've gone off on a tangent haha... Anyway thanks again for your advice, I really appreciate it and I hope you're in a positive and healthy place :)"
Fibromyalgia,36cg96,Jawzper,1 point,Tue May 19 13:56:26 2015 UTC,"Interesting that you already picked up on the self-massage. In my personal experience with fibro though, deep massage like what you've described from your acu/chiro tends to be a bit... too much? I've noticed there's a bit of a tradeoff; it reduces pain for a few days, but at the cost of increased fatigue during that time. Through a TCM lens I would describe it as the body having its energy directed to healing a local area, but with little energy to begin with, there isn't much left for to be lively with. It can be good once in a while if an area's really bothering you, and you don't plan to do anything for the next few days, but I prefer more gentle, superficial massage to simply get the energy, blood and lymph circulating a bit better in the area. Just something to take into consideration.  As for sleep, I don't think you're alone there in regards to lacking deep sleep. You might be interested to take a look at this, which I posted not long ago. What's this sleep analysis app you're using? If it's managed to pick up on a detail like this, I'm curious to give it a try myself."
Fibromyalgia,36cg96,JoLOLokia,1 point,Tue May 19 15:58:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm definitely going to ask him to go a bit easier on me next week with the massage. When he told me I should shout and scream as much as I wanted, but he wouldn't stop unless I actually said ""stop"" I knew it was going to be bad..I mean that's essentially giving me a ""safe word"" - Pretty dodgy sounding but he came highly recommended haha.. We'll see :)  What you said about gentler massage does make sense and I have a gift card for a 90 minute massage from a friend, so I'm going to get that done soon and note the difference.   Thanks for the link - very interesting! The sleep app I use is just called ""sleep cycle"" and you plug your phone in to charge, then set an alarm which is supposed to wake you up when you're naturally most ready to wake, so between a 10 min - up to an hour's phase, whatever you choose. It also tracks your movements as you sleep and supposedly shows at what stage of sleep you've been in through the night, on a chart with time on one axis and sleep depth on the other. You put your phone under the sheet, near your head while you sleep. I'm not 100% on how accurate it is, as most mornings it gives me a reading but also says ""warning, few movements detected"" but it might be worth giving it a go, I think it's free or definitely not more than a couple of quid."

Fibromyalgia,36cg96,Ialmostthewholepost,2,Thu May 21 13:06:29 2015 UTC,"Just looking through your post and seeing if there are any suggestions that I can think of, in point form.   You have a psychologist, which is expensive, and cannot afford to attend a session currently.  While sticking with the same person is great, you may benefit from seeing a less costly option such as a therapist. People with Fibro tend to be emotional people, and for good reason.  We're in constant pain, our bodies are working with the fight or flight reaction all the time due to our bodies pumping out adrenaline.  This can and will make things like depression, anxiety, and even happiness more intense.  I know that I've always been an atypically emotional guy, and that increases in great orders of magnitude with each pain level increase.  I try not to be around people other than my wife if I'm anything 5/10 on the pain scale or higher, and I'll even hide away from her if I can when it gets 6+.  I don't like the angry version of me so I try to avoid that.  Part of that comes to medication. Medications can be fun.  Some can help, some do nothing, and some make everything in the world worse.  I've run the gamut, and have now reduced myself from 30 to 40 pills a day down to an opiate for non fibro pain from past injuries, thyroid medication, and ativan before bed for sleep anxiety - I have a terrible history of chronic insomnia.  Beyond that, I use medical cannabis in oral and vaporized form as my main pain medication.  I had never used it up until several years ago when we had no other pharmaceutical options left.  I've had great success in that I was bedridden before, and now I can go for 2 walks a day with my dogs, keep a small but tidy home, keep my wife fed and occasionally visit friends or babysit a family member on short notice.  I've had great pain reduction from my IBS symptoms from high CBD oil concentrate that I take from an oral syringe, reduction in migraine intensity and duration (still have aura/confusion), reduction in neuropathic/joint/muscle pain, greater mobility, and strangely it helps me with fibro fog - THC specifically seems to help me with memory, short and long term memory recall, word recall, clearer speaking (I slur and stumble over my words frequently).  I vaporize cannabis buds before/during activity periods or bed.  I haven't had any real bad experiences, and have had a lot of positives from this. What doesn't help me at all is alcohol.  In fact, I cannot really drink anything.  It tends to be an acid reflux trigger for me, and tends to increase my pain levels unless in excess amounts, which leads to a long duration of recovery in following days.  I mention this because of your glass of Cabernet.  Nothing wrong with it, not hating on it, just may want to see if it makes any symptoms flare up for you.  It does for a lot of us. You already know the work thing.  That's a big lump of stress for you, and I hope you are able to find a way to manage somehow.   We're all here for you.  Hope things get better."

I'm in Australia though where it's not legal anywhere, incl medical marijuana as far as I know, and I'm one of those total weirdos who's never touched it. I'm honestly a bit scared of how I'll feel on it. My brother loves the stuff but my father stopped smoking it in the 70s as it made him super paranoid and my SO had the same experience with it. Might not be for me, I don't know.  Anyway, you might be on to something with the whole find-a-cheaper-therapist thing. I'm not sure how much cheaper they get (everyone I know who sees a psych or counsellor seems to pay about as much as me), but looking can't hurt!"
Fibromyalgia,36cg96,BustedBones,1 point,Mon May 18 22:43:14 2015 UTC,"Paranoia and cannabis comes from unbalanced strains typically.  THC can lead to paranoia where CBD is is calming and anti-anxiety.  Too much THC for an individual who isn't used to it can throw you for a loop.  They're symbiotic, and work best together.  I'll say that the worst side effects from cannabis are no where near as bad as anything I've had prescribed.  Being in a place where you don't have a legal way to access makes it hard to get the exact strain you want or need.  I have never used a recreational drug, I found a strong bond with medical pot when tried it as it actually provided relief that was noticeable outside myself.  My wife, who has never touched it, advocates for me to use it because of how much of a difference she sees.  In her words, ""It gives me my husband back"".  In theory, I'm not legal within the laws of Canada, but laws and courts can differ.  I know for a fact that if I was caught, I would have no issues because while I would likely be arrested, the courts have upheld medical use.  The laws are still catching up.  Check into that to see how it looks in your area.  Having some form of relief, illegal as it may be, is better than your body being a permanent, painful prison for your soul. :-)"
Fibromyalgia,36cg96,BustedBones,2,Mon May 18 22:41:53 2015 UTC,"I totally get this, I rung up sick for work this morning - I'm in so much pain I can hardly function, and tired.  I get so sore I dream pain, and I wake up all sweaty and gross.  I've had fibro for a lot of years now and every time you think ""Ok, I think I've got it"", it comes and flattens you, physically and emotionally.    The first thing that stand out it the length of your working week.  It seems to me that you are angry at yourself because you can't take the time to look after yourself, you probably feel like you have to keep up with everyone else.  I say this because that is how I feel.  I go from anger to despair, then back to frustration.    The thing that gets me through is that the pain may be excruciating but it does pass.  And yes, it will come back with avengence but it will again pass.  You need to take the time for yourself to recover from life.  Cut down on working hours, I know it is a dip in pay but your health is worth it.  Also try the non gluten thing, that has helped me so much.  I am in the process of cutting back as well, and it is so hard - you want to be functional and productive, but the reality is that you can't be productive when you feel like this.  Anyway, I don't know if this makes sense, I've had to take opiates today.  I'm sorry you are so sore and also sorry you are feeling like this.  Feel free to PM me if you like :)"

Fibromyalgia,36b3pd,LuminousSound,2,Sun May 17 22:53:37 2015 UTC,"I did the same thing as you I got off of 450mg the same way as you. I had most of the withdrawal symptoms that you're having. It gets better. I thinks the worst was the first couple of weeks, after a month most of the withdrawal symptoms faded away. I've been off for a few months now and everything is ""normal"" for someone with fibromyalgia. Hang in there. I'm glad that I got off, the side effects from Lyrica were unacceptable to me with very little benefit."
Fibromyalgia,36b3pd,falcojones,2,Mon May 18 00:41:27 2015 UTC,"Some ppl have suggested going back on Lyrica until the timing is better for you. My advice... Don't do it. I've had similar problems with Lyrica and other drugs and with one of them I went back on it until I could take time off. Bad mistake. You wil restart all the suffering.  I think you made the right choice getting meds to relieve your symptoms. Here are a few thingsI did. Pedialyte, I like the Popsicles, to get back electrolytes. Avoid Gatorade because it has a lot of sugar. If you can stomach it, eat peanut butter with plain crackers like saltines. Don't eat big meals but one or two crackers every 20 minutes all day at first. Carry water with you and sip every five minutes (if your employer objects get a doctor notes for this and the food). When my stomach is cramping or not doing well I take one of those pills with the good digestive enzyme/bacteria supplements. After about a week on those I usually see marked improvement. I don't know what they gave you for nausea but I've really liked zofran over the others because it works well and doesn't make me as drowsy.  If this has been going on that long you may need to be hooked up to an IV for fluid replacement and nutrition. When this happened to me I was severely dehydrated and was low in potassium, etc. I've been to the ER several times for fluid replacement. They should also check your levels in case your low. I've found this speeds my recovery even though it's pricy. When I was sick for 3 months (sounds similar to you) I was hospitalized and they discovered that part of the problem was that I'd been sick so long all my levels were way off and my body was just systematically rejecting food. Once we did IV therapy I was able to eat regular food within a day and keep it down.   On another note. The side effects for Lyrica lasked about 2-3 months for me."
Fibromyalgia,36b3pd,chipsnsalsa13,2,Mon May 18 07:21:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice. I just.....I don't know what happened. I was doing okay until Saturday and then it was like a full system crash happened and now I have zero appetite, my stomach constantly cramps, I'm always nauseous, and eating is extremely difficult. I have both Phinergan (spelling?) and Zofran for nausea but I don't see much of a difference between the two.  How did you deal with this for 2-3 months and handle a job??  There's never really a ""good"" time for me because even if I wait several months, my job is still going to react the same way if I take a certain amount of days off. I will definitely try the pedialyte though."
Fibromyalgia,36b3pd,chipsnsalsa13,2,Mon May 18 13:12:47 2015 UTC,"I basically had to go on short term disability after I was hospitalized. I didn't have a lot of choice at that moment. I needed the income but my parents stepped in and helped me pay the bills for a bit (I'm lucky, not everyone has support like that or the disability policy.)   I've been on both of those for nausea. By far the zofran worked better but that was just me.   You spoke about trying to see the doctor and not being able to get in.... you might try calling back (you might get a more sympathetic ear) and you might try calling other doctors in your town and explaining the situation. Sometimes, I have to be a jerk to be seen.  What kind of job do you do? Is it one where you might be able to sit most of the time? That really helped me...I got a rolling chair and just worked from there as best I could."

I realize that you have gone through a lot to get to where you are now, but if you have zero flexibility with work then I think it leaves you no choice but to stay on lyrica for the time being."

Fibromyalgia,36b3nv,stormyfuck,3,Sun May 17 22:53:12 2015 UTC,"Please point that exact area out to the PT. Check google Wikipedia to see an illustration pic. I believe the area of pain is the Sacrolliac Joint. If so, It hurts and I've used ice on mine. A year ago, I did buy a TENS unit from Amazon. The FDA approved Healthmate Forever 6 mode, about $70. When my Sac. flares up I'll use the TENS until it calms down and avoid walking too much. A stretch is lay on back, bring knees to chest, hold gently. (Others here use, I believe, Omron Tens)."
Fibromyalgia,36b3nv,k1012,3,Sun May 17 23:53:24 2015 UTC,"This indeed sounds like Sacroiliac pain. I have the same issue. Your PT should be able to show you how to do a maneuver to put the joint into place. The best thing I've gotten out of my couple months of PT is this maneuver. I do it every morning because my SI joint goes out almost every night. It isn't a muscle knot, probably, it's inflammation in the joint and irritation of the tendons that are supposed to hold the joint in place. I'm not pain free in that area, but it's so, so much better than it was. Just in case your PT doesn't know how to fix it I'll describe the maneuver. Check with your PT to be sure this is a safe maneuver for you:  Lay on your side in the fetal position with the painful hip on top. Extend your bottom leg at about a 30 degree angle behind you. Twist your upper body so that you have your shoulders and back to the floor, leaving the lower body in the side-lying position. Extend your top leg at about a 30 degree angle in front of you. Lift your leg about 60 degrees into the air and hold it there for a count of five.  Lower your leg to rest the foot on the ground for a count of five. Repeat the leg lift about 5 times.  I wish I were better at describing this. I'm not sure that my directions are clear enough. You may hear a pop when the joint goes into place, but I never do. It's such a simple procedure and really doesn't take much effort. I was skeptical at first since it seemed too simple, but it works for me every time. To give the joint the extra push it needs my PT has me follow up with the following procedure:  Lay flat on your back with your knees bent and feet on the floor. Push against the outside of your knees with your hands and push against your hands with your knees, pushing your knees apart.  Hold for a count of five. Push against the inside of your knees, pushing in toward your hands with your knees, knees pushing toward each other.  Hold for a count of five.  This procedure sometimes produces a popping feeling for me, but not usually. Instead of pushing with my hands inward I use a yoga strap to produce the resistance and use a yoga block to create the outward resistance when I push my knees together.  You really do need to talk to your PT about all this, but I know I would have killed for this information in the months before I started seeing a PT when my SI joint was excruciating every day."
Fibromyalgia,36b3nv,katrinam42,1 point,Mon May 18 06:23:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this! I have a few stretches in my arsenal already and will be adding these to it. I feel a pop/cracking sound from stretching it almost every time. I did have an xray done on my hips but my rheumatologist said it was normal. I guess that wouldn't show joints/tendons though, would it?  I have shown my PT exactly where the pain is, and there is a tangible knot there that they work on. If it were irritation/inflammation would it present as a knot that can be felt? Does the massage/heat therapy help or hurt that kind of joint/tendon issue?"
Fibromyalgia,36b3nv,katrinam42,2,Mon May 18 09:26:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had an X ray too to rule out something more serious and mine was normal too. It only shows bones.  I would try to massage mine too before I found out what was going on. Your muscles may be knotting in response to the pain and tension in your tendons and joint. Massage can help those tendons and muscles to relax and give you some relief. I've found that heat helps, too. Ultimately, your PT is going to know more about this than I do. Just ask them about SI joint pain and see where they go with it."

Sometimes they're just hot patches, sometimes they feel like someone has scraped the surface of my skin and is pointing a 5000 degree light at the open wound.  Usually it's a combination of the two at the same time.  This is new to my 10-yr-old Fibro life - just started in February (with some other symptoms I've never experienced).  I can live with it but when it started, it was EVERYWHERE.  I thought I was dying and didn't mind at all - I wanted to be dying so it would end.  I think it's called Allodynia."

Fibromyalgia,36af8y,PeacefulTreeLand,1 point,Mon May 18 00:41:37 2015 UTC,"Yes....it is a strange sensory feeling. Honestly, it happens more around my breasts and mid torso. I related it to the same feeling from being a breast feeding mom who leaked everywhere (sorry, you can either understand that one or don't try it) only when I freak out and feel my shirt and look around I feel and see nothing, yet I still ""feel"" that wetness.   I have felt phantom baby kicks before, and I know lots of other moms who have as well. I know some moms who comment that they swear they can fell their breast letdown, decades after they have stopped breast feeding, at the sound of a baby's cry....out of no where. So I just kind of related the wetness feeling to one of the many random, blanked up things that reproduction does to females."

I know it isn't easy, but you need to find a way to cut back your hours before they get cut back for you.  Powering through the pain doesn't work for long.  Have you tried gabapentin or Lyrica?  You shouldn't need to see a specialist to get a prescription for most of the medications that work for fibro.  For me, Lyrica made it easier to move, which helped me cope a lot better.  I always try new things to reduce the pain, whether it is a new medication or a new non-drug therapy.  After a few years there are still some things that I haven't tried.  I always hope that tomorrow will be better, even though most of the time things are still the same."
Fibromyalgia,368the,Le_Squish,2,Sun May 17 08:44:26 2015 UTC,Gabapentin actually worked really well. But I took myself off medicine for awhile because sorta went into denial.

Fibromyalgia,368the,Ridiculous_Diagnosis,2,Wed May 20 06:48:59 2015 UTC,"Slow your roll. You must moderate your activity. Your choices are to adapt (financially and mentally)to doing less or crash and burn and be unable to anything.   Rest when you need to. If you try to power through things, you will always pay with a flare-up.   Properly mourn the things you can't do so you can move on. Focus on the things you can do. You can't stop your body from hurting but you sure as hell can stop mentally torturing yourself. We gotta live life at a slower pace. Find a pace that works for you."
Fibromyalgia,368the,mrsclause2,2,Sun May 17 10:53:49 2015 UTC,"Stress is often the bigger enemy than the fibro itself. I had to quit my bartending job and sort through months of unemployment and not being sure if I would be able to pay the rent, but that stress was still significantly better than the stress of the job. I got a desk job and I'm thrilled. I'm more myself again.  I think you need to treat your body like you're an athlete. Your body is responding badly to something in your routine that you need to do your best to alleviate. Hot baths help. I can't tell you how many times I've come home from work in tears after carrying heavy cases of beer all night. I run a bath and even turning the faucet hurts. But after the initial shit show, it brings my pain level down from like 86% to 50% or less. Baths all the way.   Also I found that working as a barista and eating a lot of baked goods did shit things for my joints. I don't know what it is but carbs and butter make my body angry. It's as if I'm fine one minute and then I have a croissant and my body turns into an angry hive of bees.  I thought I could last in the service industry. I was a really damn good bartender. Top seller, highest ring, in shape, dedicated. Fibro fog got me fired though because I couldn't manage my stress anymore. I saw the light after I retired from the service industry.

There is no such thing as a bad day for a yard sale, if Monday is your only free day then make up the signs and advertise it like heck. Use your wife's photography skills to highlight many items in pictures to highlight in the ads. Like serious, every 50 cents counts.   Anything that you think would be worth something but don't have time to sell on your own, take it to a pawn shop. Even that elliptical, I would call around first before I hauled it over, but any amount of cash from the pawn shop is better then walking away completely."

Since getting my big, dorky backpack, I walk to and from school now (2 miles each way) and it has helped a lot with my fibro.   I also have a gimp cane I bought at walmart. It was like...15$ or something and it's blue. It only comes out when I have to be mobile when I really shouldn't be anywhere except a hot bath or in bed.   And in terms of mobility, I often wear work-out clothes simply because I can move around in them more easily. They are softer on my skin. They often are quick-dry. They are stretchy but can sometimes squeeze everything in place, so they are flattering :P  Those are mine!"

I really don't find that it hurts my shoulders at all. That's why I swear by it. It has straps at the hips and I buckle the arms and tighten the straps very snugly (still comfy though) and it alleviates just the right amount. When I unbuckle to take the bag off I immediately feel the weight.  Walking is fun! I use it to meditate. I also had to walk THROUGH some flares in the beginning but I just gritted my teeth and walked on. I'm proud of myself, it made a huge difference in my daily stamina.  I use the cane less and less because I'm done with school but I use it maybe...once every few months. I honestly need it more often than that but don't want to deal with the reactions.   I think the main thing about tight stretchy workout clothes is that they are flexible so you can move around easily but it keeps everything tightly in place. So like....my joints appreciate the unlikelihood of things getting out of alignment. I like that they don't slip around like when I'm wearing jeans.

It's just hard to get used to when I'm trying to find myself as a person.  The other night I saw a girl who looked about my age, had an awesome style, and was confidently using a medical cane. She just looked really rad and it brightened my day! Made me feel a lot more confident about it. If she looked cool doing it, so could I."
Fibromyalgia,364eqd,MsCoffeeBitch,1 point,Sat May 16 08:14:28 2015 UTC,"That sounds really pretty. You sound like you're quite fond of it, and that's awesome :) I hope you feel less craptacular soon <3  I can appreciate what you mean. When I first started using the cane, I felt really awful. I couldn't shake the feeling that people were looking at me and silently judging me. After using it for long enough, though, you forget about it. People still look, but if you smile at them, it usually catches them off guard and they can't help but smile back. I hope you can find your comfort zone with using the cane in public and around your friends.  I find most people are actually pretty good about it. Of course, you still find the odd asshole, but that's where you smack them in the shins with it ;P"
Fibromyalgia,364bqa,Ridiculous_Diagnosis,7,Sat May 16 00:33:38 2015 UTC,"Stress is HORRIBLE for Fibro. I was working at a very stressful job up until a year ago. I would wake up, a ball of stress. I couldn't sleep at night.  Last July, I was let go for taking too much time off for being sick. It was such a mess. I was given 6 months severance and once I got over the OMG I'VE BEEN FIRED!, the stress of the job went away. My husband works at the same place, and when he told me stories, I would be like, that's not my problem any more. The difference between this time last year and now is remarkable. I still have pain, but I have much less fog."

Also you just helped me realize why I've been feeling so sick lately, so thank you!

I think Tramadol might be a good place to start since its not as strong as Vicodin or the like. Be careful with Lyrica and Gabapentin though, because between those two meds, I gained over 40 lbs. I was also much more sedentary from the Fibro so you have to take that into account too. Also, have you tried physical therapy? Best of luck to you!"

Fibromyalgia,361os9,Gr33n_Rider,1 point,Fri May 15 17:17:23 2015 UTC,"Yea, diet really helps too. I eat more fruits and veggies now, I've cut out gluten and grains for the most part, and almost no processed food and no sugar. I have coffee in the morning and that helps w/ pain (not sure it would work for everyone, but it seems to make the pain less for me). Make sure you are getting enough protein and probiotics. The protein doesn't have to be all meat either and it really shouldn't. I only eat chicken with salad for lunch and that's it. If you want to know more, I can elaborate."

Fibromyalgia,361os9,zebra-stampede,1 point,Sat May 16 03:07:27 2015 UTC,"Yea, totally. Here's what works for me. (I eat very much the same every day b/c I've found what works and I stick to it.)  Breakfast: Irish Oatmeal and and Apple w/ 2 tsp of almond butter Lunch: Salad w/ perdue chicken strips, balsamic vinegrette (Newman's Own) and a glass of kefir Snack: Nut thins and cabot cheese and an orange Dinner: I make a pot of bean or lentil soup and eat that through the week. Otherwise I mostly do a source of protein and veggies for dinner. Meat is ok, but I find that I only really tolerate lean meat, poultry, and fish without pain Snack after dinner: soy yogurt with granola Supplements I take: 2,000 IU of Vitamin D, 400 IU of Vitamin E, 500 mg of Magnesium, B-complex vitamin, Cod Liver Oil 1000 mg Exercise: Mon, Wed, Fri, I go to the gym and do the stretches my physical therapist taught me and then I walk 20 minutes forwards on the treadmill at 2.0 and backwards for 10 minutes at .8. On Tues, Thurs, Sat, I do yoga classes that last for about 75 minutes. I also walk around the block with my husband after he gets home from work for about 15 minutes. It took me a year and a few months to work up to this routine, so if you don't exercise, please work up to it. I started out with swimming, which was a really great way to get in shape. I also meditate before bed and that helps tremendously. You can find all sorts of guided meditation on youtube for free. I prefer the ""Honest Guys."" I hope all of this helps. I had someone give me similar information when I was first diagnosed and it gave me hope."
Fibromyalgia,361os9,zebra-stampede,1 point,Sun May 17 20:46:38 2015 UTC,"I'm 22 and was diagnosed about a year ago in regards to my fibro. I have a lot of other issues going on so I tried a lot of meds over the years that now are generally being used for fibro. You've only tried three. There are a lot out there! Off hand you could look into nortriptylene, gabapentin, any of the prescription NSAIDs like mobic, celebrex, etodolac etc. Prednisone if you have swelling. If you have a liberal neurologist something like baclofen might help if you have muscle crampiness. Prescription gels like voltaren or pennsaid allow you to apply medicine directly to an affected joint or area. We have dozens of SSRI and SSNI now with widespread pain. If its fatigue things like amantidine, provigil, nuvigil, adderal can help. Simply making sure your sleep is in order can really help things. I'm currently on trazodone for that. Muscle relaxers can help sleep and also muscle pain, I tend to prefer methocarbomol or cyclobenzaprine though tizanidine puts me to sleep and I wake up feeling reset.  You didn't specify what exactly is bothering you pain wise so that's my shotgun reply, we might be able to give you more advice if you let us know exactly whats going on.   As far as narcotics before I was diagnosed I couldn't function. Finally finally someone threw some tramadol at me and I got back on my feet. Obviously treating the underlying condition as much as possible as opposed to medicating symptoms is the goal. I think of course getting something to help the pain and make you functional is a must. Tramadol when taken on a routine schedule really helped prevent a lot of my Pain. I eventually went through codeine and vicodin in as well. Up from there I didn't want to pursue anything cause I'm 22 and god forbid someone starts me on the real narcotics this young and I go through them all by the time I'm 30. So I personally try to manage without them as much as I can via all the other things listed above. I fell victim to the thinking that if something wasn't a registered narcotic than it couldn't relieve pain which isn't true! I think some in combination with trying out a few new types of drugs might really get you back and functioning though. Tramadol is usually a good starting place. Let us know how it goes! I hope you feel better soon."
Fibromyalgia,361os9,FibroMan,1 point,Fri May 15 10:45:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying! I didn't wanna go on for too long but yes I've already tired many of this mentioned and alternative options too including acupuncture, neuropathy, meditation. My dad is a physician so any time i want to try any drug it's there which I know sounds bad but hey he helps.  I've tried combinations, amitriptyline gave me serious suicidal thought but I was able to take it up with my family and so I'm staying away from that. And cymbalta did nothing  but give me every possible side effect it was terrible (alone and with the other two). I'm yet to try celebrex though so maybe I'll give that a shot first.  I've also got cyclobenzaprine for the really rough nights when I can't sleep from the pain.   Voltaren and SSRIs and SNRIs haven't working wither. But I was thinking more of a low dose T3 so I can get back to swimming - the only activity I can get myself to do.   Also I guess I should mention my family has em in a crazy strict healthy diet and sleep is generally good.  I don't know I guess I feel a bit hopless.. But I don't wanna nag :/"
Fibromyalgia,361os9,whenifeellikeit,1 point,Fri May 15 11:18:52 2015 UTC,You deserve to have a pain free functional life as much as possible! I'm back on my phone but I'll try to come up with some off the wall things. Maybe a lidocaine infusion or steroid shots? I really think tramadol would be great! Maybe refer yourself to a pain management clinic? They've seen the real deal and probably could see you through it.
Fibromyalgia,361os9,whenifeellikeit,2,Fri May 15 12:25:48 2015 UTC,Okayy thanks again everyone on here is almost too helpful.. I'm suspicious haha I've heard about those actually but yet to walk into one maybe I'll make it my summer time goal
Fibromyalgia,361os9,whenifeellikeit,1 point,Fri May 15 12:54:42 2015 UTC,"I took celebrex for a few months before I had my fibro diagnosis.  After about a week I woke up in the middle of the night with strong abdominal pain, so I went to the emergency department at the hospital.  At the hospital they told me that I had gastroenteritis caused by taking celebrex, and that taking an over the counter medication called pantoprazole each day would have prevented it.  If you decide to take celebrex then I recommend taking pantoprazole too.  The celebrex worked well at first, but it gradually worked less and less over a few months, so I don't recommend it for fibro pain."
Fibromyalgia,361os9,whenifeellikeit,1 point,Sat May 16 00:02:01 2015 UTC,"Well, firstly, I want to say that if fibro is what you have and not a misdiagnosis (just putting it out there), then narcotics are unlikely to do too much either. FM is a syndrome in which the body usually lacks receptors for endogenous opioids, so exogenous ones are usually fairly ineffective as well.   It's also unlikely that your doctor will be willing to prescribe you narcotics for the longterm. You don't want to get hooked on pain pills, especially at such a young age.  Doctors are incredibly wary of that, so you'll probably have difficulty getting one to agree to it with a diagnosis of fibro.   I'm curious as to why you haven't tried combining Lyrica (or just regular Neurontin) with Cymbalta or amitriptyline.  Although, amitriptyline was terrible for me, so I won't touch it again.  My current med combo works extremely well (Cymbalta + gabapentin).    Try some other medication combinations and you might get more relief.  Stay away from the narcs.  They're bad news."
Fibromyalgia,361os9,whenifeellikeit,1 point,Fri May 15 10:56:26 2015 UTC,The thought of it not being fibro has aways been in the back of my mind but there aren't any tests left to do so its frustrating.   I'm not sure it would be any every day thing but more of a here's a pill for when I can't move. But yeah I've tired many combinations of many drugs including arthritic type meds. Nothing seems to ever work except codeine of course.
Fibromyalgia,361os9,Arose21,1 point,Fri May 15 11:23:43 2015 UTC,"I think it's something all of us kinda think about.  What if it's something else and it just hasn't been diagnosed?  I also find it difficult sometimes to figure out if something is fibro pain or something else.  I feel like a lot of my pain or other health issues get brushed off as ""just the fibro"" and I sometimes wonder if that's the wrong way of approaching it.   Anyway, like the other commenter said, tramadol might be a good option, or something with codeine and an NSAID.  Fairly mild, and yeah, maybe a good idea to keep on hand for the really bad days.    Try adding Cymbalta back in alongside the Lyrica and give it a couple of months to see if you get any effect.  Neurontin works by the same mechanism as Lyrica, by the way, and it's way, way cheaper. It's a seizure drug that has the very common off-label application of reducing nerve pain, and it's very effective when combined with an SNRI like Cymbalta or Effexor."
Fibromyalgia,361os9,FibroMan,1 point,Fri May 15 11:29:11 2015 UTC,Heh yeah I think I blame the fibro way too often. But thanks so much for the neurontin tip! I guess I'll need to talk to my doctor about all of this I just wanted to wake in there with some knowledge of what everyone else thinks.
Fibromyalgia,361os9,lbsmith5,1 point,Fri May 15 11:36:09 2015 UTC,"It's taken me like three years to get my meds dialed into what seems to be a good combo and dose. Everyone's different, so you just have to keep experimenting.    The pain and other symptoms won't completely disappear, but I think it's pretty likely that you'll find a combo that at least makes it bearable.  I was more or less disabled for a few years before adding Cymbalta to my neurontin (for a suicidal depressive episode that was honestly basically triggered by my crippling fibro symptoms), and not only did it lift the depression, it began to control my pain like no other med ever did.  I went off the neurontin briefly to see what it was like and found that I still needed it, but at a much lower dose (400mg instead of the 900mg I was taking daily).   Have hope.  Lifestyle stuff also helps a lot, so keep that in mind.  Heating pads, epsom salt baths, Vitamin D supplementation and a good multivitamin.  I've found that a low carb, high fat diet reduces my pain and brain fog and also controls the IBS symptoms (I have crippling IBS as part of my fibro too).  Exercise and stretching are incredibly important too.  Maintain your weight because excess weight makes it all so much worse. (I know, I know... it's pretty fucking hard to contemplate exercise when you can barely move, but you've gotta work it in somehow.) Get enough sleep.  Take melatonin for fractured sleep if you have it.   Keep a good line of communication with your doctor.  Learn what triggers your flares (stress is the #1 offender for me, with #2 being major outings or events that put me out in the heat or cold for too long).  Learn to plan your life so that you allow yourself time to recover from things like that.  I have basically learned that if I want to push myself hard (which I do... I mean, I'm a mother of two little kids, I have hobbies and interests... I don't plan to stop living my life just because I have fibro, right?), I have to allow myself down days afterwards to recover.  You pay for good days with bad ones.  Plan accordingly.   Educate your SO about it and get their support. Having an SO who understands and is on board with your management is essential.  Don't let resentment build or let yourself become dependent. This is part of your life now and will be forever.  You have to build your relationships around it."
Fibromyalgia,361os9,dravenxiv,2,Fri May 15 11:59:43 2015 UTC,"Wow you're one heck of a success story I'm so glad to hear people actually get control of their life I to do so one day too. Hm I may try a low carb diet. I did go gluten free for a few months 2 years back but  it didn't do much. I live in Canada so I'm kind of buried in snow most of the year and then my family and friends expect me to get all active around may so yeah hear the weight lecture  is quite annoying but I think I'm doing well in that aspect of things.   Okay so I think what I got out of all of this is I should probably change my diet a bit, change my lifestyle a whole lot and possibly talk to my doctor about having  a back up plan for the days I'm immobile.  Alright, I feel good!"
Fibromyalgia,361os9,lbsmith5,1 point,Fri May 15 12:16:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for me it's the carbs, not the gluten.  A high fat, low carb diet always tends to make me feel my best.  When I cheat or go off of it, I always end up paying for it.   If you have room for it, and a little extra money to throw around here or there, you might consider getting a spin bike from a local gym (they replace their equipment periodically. I got a formerly $2000 spin bike from my old gym for $300 and still have it in perfect working condition ten years later), or another piece of equipment like that.  Indoor exercise is just as good.   And you know what else?  A lot of people in here (even really young ones!) have canes for the really, really horrible days.  Having a cane to lean on when you're standing in a long line can really ease a ton of the pain in your joints. Don't feel bad if you find you need one.  Do what you have to do to minimize the discomfort, whatever it takes.   I think of it this way:  Fibro is a life sentence,  not a death sentence.  I refuse to become a cripple just because I have a disability. I've had to modify my lifestyle, but whatever.  This is the body I'm stuck with to carry me through the rest of my life.  Hating it isn't going to help me and letting it rule my life is not something I'm about to do.   Tons of people have disabilities waaay more crushing and desperate and life-destroying than this. Keep your chin up and stay feisty and you'll have a good life."
Fibromyalgia,361os9,lbsmith5,1 point,Fri May 15 12:27:43 2015 UTC,"I tried biking, I ended up paying for it but I'm guessing its not the same huh?

Fibromyalgia,361dyb,Twitchythrowaway,3,Fri May 15 07:34:06 2015 UTC,"I seriously feel you on the wheelchair thing. I feel horrible using it, like I'm some kind of imposter. The looks you get when you stand up and hobble along once you get your joints moving again are awful. I absolutely hate the impression that only completely immobile-from-the-waist-down types are allowed to use them, everyone else is doing it for kicks. I have one for when things get bad, but time and time again I find myself arguing against using it because I just feel really ashamed to be pushed around in it. Same thing goes with the mobility scooters. I got given a second hand one for Christmas and haven't had the nards to use it :/  I don't have a folding cane, but I do have a very awesome solid one and it makes me feel a lot less crappy about using it at 25. It's a brass eagle's head (with a nasty beak!) with mother of pearl inlay down the shaft. It looks like it should be a sword cane. If they weren't incredibly illegal where I live, I'd have one of those instead :P  I could show you a picture if you like? I feel like we need some kind of cane appreciation thread!  My best suggestion is to go to a second hand store and find a cane that feels comfortable for you (need to remember that the height of the cane is a big factor in how much it's going to hurt your shoulders. Ideally it shouldn't, but ideally most people don't have fibro, either) and then do something amazing and very YOU with it. You should be able to pick up a second hand wooden cane for about $5 or so. I've seen people attach bells and streamers to them, paint them fluro, give them leopard print spots and even one that had a number plate stuck to it for giggles. Do something that makes you smile when you look at it! The way I look at it, the cane isn't a sign of defeat. It's just a better way to whack someone when they look at me funny ;)"

Fibromyalgia,35zh2z,whenifeellikeit,3,Thu May 14 22:25:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm on the same. I haven't heard anything about infra-red cabins. Unfortunately, medication is what's helped me the most.  Oh, an infra-red cabin is known as a sauna in the US (a special kind, but still a sauna). Here's something from the Mayo Clinic: http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/expert-answers/infrared-sauna/faq-20057954  Does your mom have any other issues? For example, I have low blood pressure and would pass out in one. Fibromyalgia also is known to give people issues with cooling and heating themselves (I am someone with these issues), so we have to avoid extreme temperatures. I know it just warms the body, not the air, but I would still be wary. A warm bath with epsom salts works for me when I am achey, and is more cost effective."

You may have gone overboard as this was the first time working out in 2 years.  For a normal person, they'd be stiff and sore from that for 1 to 5 days, depending.  With fibro, I've found I would have muscle and tendon pain for up to 2 weeks after a workout when I was conditioned.    Have you tried light stretching, or alternating warm and cold in the affected areas?  This may help get things back to normal faster.  As for going again tomorrow, that is up to you and your pain tolerance levels.  If it's fibro pain, I'd advise waiting.  If it's muscle pain, I'd advise going through with the workout."

The only input I can give that is that proper form and posture will have a massive impact on pain levels, and your trainer is the best person to monitor that for you.  : )"
Fibromyalgia,35vesu,WhoAreYouWhoAmI,2,Wed May 13 22:17:22 2015 UTC,Also the trainer has worked with fibro patients before so I'm hoping he knows how to not push me too much.   I've tried heating it. I'm going to take an Epson salt bath tonight. Hopefully that'll help. I've just never heard of this reaction before.

Fibromyalgia,35rf8g,Moon-Sedai,3,Tue May 12 21:59:55 2015 UTC,"100% hear you.  I sound like a special person trying to have a conversation aloud most days.  Even just talking to someone I'm comfortable with exasperates it, the longer I talk the more I start to slur, stumble, or lose my place altogether.  I'm no scholar or genius by any means, but the amount of damage fog has done over time to my ability to think and articulate my thoughts to others?  I might as well be a mute.  I'd almost be better off.  I'll throw this out there, because it's been bugging me lately as I've been recognizing it, but I notice that when I get migrainy and foggy at the same time, I say the most stupidest shit known to humankind.  I will argue about things that the next day I know were incorrect, I will pick verbal spats over ridiculous things, and just trail off into oblivion with nonsensical thoughts while loved ones stare at me, and then go back to talking to each other and just ignore me.  Am I alone in that?"

Fibromyalgia,35qhxg,ColonelButtsworth,1 point,Tue May 12 17:57:56 2015 UTC,"This absolutely sounds familiar to me. The first symptoms that made me start bugging my doctor were feelings that I thought could be arthritis in my toes, as well as similar pains that moved around my body from day to day. Since then, I've had lots of other symptoms come and go, but at the very beginning, those pains were all I took note of.  Not from personal experience, but from what I've read/heard, I'd also think that your lack of pain while on meds makes perfect sense if this is fibromyalgia."
Fibromyalgia,35qhxg,lilygrass,1 point,Tue May 12 19:28:50 2015 UTC,"Technically in order for it to be fibro, there has to be equal pain in all 4 quadrants of the body, that's one of the diagnostic criteria.  Do you have any of the other sunrooms? Sensitivity to touch, hypersensitivity to light and sound, general fatigue, cognitive fog, etc? If it's just the pain I would imagine something else, although I'm definitely not a doctor. I might suggest a pain specialist?"

Mass has helped me with my body temperature regulation so far. I can't say much for the muscle aches though because I'm always at the gym and therefore always sore in some capacity, be it fibro-related or from my workouts.

My husband and son go.  I feel terrible for him always having to make excuses for me.  I have such a great time when I am able to go and get a lot of big hugs (ouch) and a ton of I love yous. Then, I'm wiped out for days after.  I always try to take pictures when I am out because then I can bask in how worth it they are.  My family is another story.  They don't understand at all.  It's actually pretty toxic.  I see a therapist who gives me a lot of tools to handle the guilt trips they try to lay on me. It's snide remarks like your aunt made that really hurt, when the truth is they are bad communicators who can't just say I was disappointed you didn't make it over because I was really looking forward to your visit.  Was it just going to be the two of you?  Maybe when this happens you call her and let her know that you're just not physically up to it tonight, but you have a bottle of wine and she should open hers and you can have a nice long phone chat, while you rest in your comfy place? As for the anonymous note, whoever left it has issues of their own if they feel the arrogance to judge another person just by looking at them AND take the time out of their own life to write a mean note.

Fibromyalgia,35nvf5,emberjewel,2,Tue May 12 02:03:03 2015 UTC,"Sketchers was my compromise. They have some that are Toms-ish but have way better support, and have tons of others that don't look athletic-y.   http://www.skechers.com/women/styles/memory-foam  About halfway down/through the bottom you'll see some non athletic looking ones. The memory foam is really helpful to me.  It was really hard for me as well, but we have to learn to sacrifice our looks over comfort in the foot area at least if we want to keep going upright. I have some 'dressier' supportive shoes but they just aren't as comfortable. I know Danskos is another rec that gets thrown around, but those aren't going to look stylish to a 21 year old, and they can be expensive. Most Sketchers stores have an ongoing buy one get one half off sale if you have a store nearby you.  (Also, if you can get there, the athletic looking sketchers ARE more comfortable than the others :) )"
Fibromyalgia,35nvf5,lbsmith5,1 point,Tue May 12 02:05:17 2015 UTC,"I second the Skechers. They have been a lifesaver. I have the ones that have little rubber ball looking things on the bottom. They also have the memory foam gel hybrid sole. They are so darn comfortable. I am on my feet all day, and have chronic daily headache and migraine, so while our pains are different, I think that you should look into Skechers, They do have some that do not look athletic.

The best I have found--and I'll preface this by saying all shoes besides cushy flip flops hurt my feet--is the Dr. Scholls custom inserts. You stand barefoot on a machine that assesses the arches of your feet, and tells you which insole to buy. One pair costs around $50 but you can move them into whatever shoes you're wearing. I wear them in my Tom's and Sketchers, and in dressier shoes. They might be too think for some shoes, but overall they've allowed me to wear shoes I wouldn't otherwise be able to. Now I make sure I have them when I try on new shoes before buying."
Fibromyalgia,35nvf5,sparky_mcsparksalot,1 point,Tue May 12 04:12:05 2015 UTC,"Depending on your budget, I would recommend either Ariat or Dansko. I used to work for an airline & with my issues, those were the only shoes that I could tolerate for more than 4 hours at a time. The Dansko don't work well if you have a high arch, but my Ariats are almost 10 years old and still going strong.   If that's out of your price range, then I'd also go with /u/lbsmith5's suggestion of Sketchers. They have some really cute styles that don't look like athletic shoes, especially their new slip on ones.   Another place to look in general is The Walking Company. They have a large selection and a varying price range.  Hope something here helps. Best of luck!"

Also, remember supplements are not regulated & often ""hooey"", plus you really want to be working with a professional for all aspects of treatment (includes diet, sleep schedule, OTC, supplements, exercise, massage, what have you)."

Fibromyalgia,35jy2g,amyorainbow74,3,Mon May 11 03:00:49 2015 UTC,"Once you see a rheumatologist, they will do a pressure point test. I have fibro and 2 kinds of arthritis so I feel your pain. The pressure point test will help the Dr determine if it is fibro. All they do it press firmly on certain points of your body. My fibro was pretty easy to diagnose since I was in tears by the end of the test and I jokingly threatened to hit my Dr. LOL A rheumatologist appointment is your first big step to relief. Oh, do your own research for rheumatologists in your area and ask for a referral to the one you like."

It was made up by drug companies!"" to others when the subject arises when they really don't know a thing about it.   Clearly the show can't be blamed for the ignorance of others, but it can be faulted for the ignorance and insensitivity of their writers. That's what it all comes down to, too. Someone on their writing staff is clueless, thought they were being super witty, threw that little turd nugget out into the universe, where it has come to roost in your brain when all you were looking for was escapism.

I've stopped caring what other people think. My placard is legitimate. Every placard is identifiable to a drivers license (yours) so a cop or officer can verify it if you are questioned.  I've only been asked once by a parking officer to verify my placard. No biggie. She apologized to me but said most of the placards she runs at the university aren't the drivers (or their passenger) and they were trying to crack down on it.  If a person ever accused me of stealing my placard or ""borrowing"" it, I would invite them to call the cops or the parking department. I know it will check out. I would also remind them that not all disabilities require wheelchair or cane.   My advice, move on. People can be judgmental about stuff like this but the reality is that they just need to be educated."
Fibromyalgia,35fzt5,chipsnsalsa13,2,Sun May 10 04:28:21 2015 UTC,"As long as you're being considerate about it and only using it when you need it, you should be fine.  I've had one for years and finally got the kind in a license plate on my car and I still don't use them every time. If there is a spot close enough or I think I can do it without a problem, I will always try not to. But when the bad day comes (and even if it's every day for a month) then I use it and I don't feel bad about it.  You won't see me park and jump out of the car and run quickly into the store when it's raining though. Because if I feel good enough to run, I don't use it. It's my own way of being respectful, because you know someone is more disabled than you and might need that spot. I've seen it at Trader Joe's a bunch of times. But I've also had to take a spot at that store and hobble on in using my cane on a bad day. On those days I don't really think about the people who might have it worse than me because I know I can't do any better than I am.  The point isn't to feel guilty obviously, it's to use the services you need when you need them. There is probably always someone who thinks you don't need the spot. Even when I use my cane people think I don't need it cause someone is older or someone has a wheelchair. As long as I know when I use it that I am only doing it because I NEED it, I never feel bad and I look people in the eye. I have a card that came with my license plate with my name that I carry in my wallet and I'm happy to show it to anyone who asks.   If the doctor told you it was ok to have it, then they obviously think there are days when you need it and you should not be ashamed of that. You're not doing anything wrong - you pay taxes to have services like this. Maybe you won't always need them (I hope for you that you don't) but when you do you should have them. You'll be ok and now some things will be just a bit easier because you're closer and that's good too. Take care."

Within months of my thyroid blowing up, all of my Fibro ailments started showing up.  And you are right about doctors reading different levels as important or not - I have read a lot about it.  When I had my thyroid removed I didn't fully recover once discharged from the hospital.  Progressively, over the next 13 months, I deteriorated to the extent that I was falling asleep while sitting up at work and could hardly do more than curl into a ball when I got home.  I had several thyroid tests during that time and was showing good levels for many, many months.  Then I went for a check-up and my doctor threw some thyroid med samples into a bag (something she used to be really good at doing - now no more).  I added them on top of my current prescription and thought nothing of it.  3 days later I was awake.  3 more days later and I was a totally different person.  I spoke to the nurse at my doctor's office (and the doctor since then), and found it's not uncommon for a person to have good levels report in a blood test when, in fact, her body is not responding to it as intended.  I have experimented with several brands & generics and have had varying levels of response.  Keep fighting for what you believe in!"

Find a metabolic specialist and get a 3rd opinion, at the very least. Black market drugs carry unnecessary risk, especially when what you're trying to treat isn't life threatening & the common side effects from the therapy can be life threatening. I completely understand the frustration - I went through 14 specialists of various stripes when I was initially getting my medication regimen together - but the risks are very real with buying drugs online.

To be more specific, it's more likely a thyroid transport disorder, but I didn't want to get into all that here. I just wanted to give some hope to the other Fibromites.   Incidentally, I do have an autoimmune disorder ""unspecified"" at the moment because there are ANAs in my bloodstream, I just didn't get diagnosed with RA because I don't have any rheumatoid factor (and, my mom has RA).

Within that program is Social security disability program. That is when you are ill or injured and cannot continue to work. At your age and with Fibro you would apply at the social security office for disability. The disability evaluation has nothing to do with your husband or any income. Its about your ability to work. Nothing else. If you have worked the required time, and are unable to do your job, and cannot be retrained, you are disabled and receive benefits.  I suggest you contact an attorney. It will cost nothing if you are not approved. It will cost a set amount with a cap if you win. The attorney costs are regulated. You can even have SSD pay the attorney directly. I advise people to contact one of the nationwide companies that handle SSD applications. First. Let them do the paperwork for the application. They know a little more about how to present your case to SSD than you or I.  A phone call to any attorney that handles ssd will cost you time. Call several."
Fibromyalgia,35aryc,rhekn,1 point,Fri May 8 18:56:21 2015 UTC,"I don't have fibro, I love someone who does- but I'm also chronically ill and had to seek SSDI after I couldn't continue to do my job of 21+ years. I filed and after being evaluated by the doctor that social security sent me to had my claim rejected because he determined I could still work at some other job. That was when I hired a SSDI attorney to help me. It took two more years of filing paperwork, getting updated  reports and gathering every single previous report from my doctor and specialist.  Finally, we had a date to see a SSDI judge to present our case. He reviewed my documents, interviewed me briefly, and also consulted a labor specialist who was present at the behest of the SS Administration- who also looked over MY doctors reports and assessments, and determined I was not capable of performing the duties required for my trade. The judge ruled in my favor and determined that SSDI owed me two years back pay from the date I first filed. The attorney fee was capped at 7% of my award, she was paid straight from SSDI and two months later I relieved a check for the lump sum of the back pay & monthly SSDI payment ever since. If you can't work and perform your job duties, it doesn't matter what your spouse earns. It's based on You and what you can or cannot do. I suggest you file for disability, and it may get denied based on their own doctors. Then it's time to hire an attorney and be thorough about gathering documents and reports from  your doctors. And good luck!"
Fibromyalgia,35aryc,Scoobydoobyfu,1 point,Tue May 12 21:19:41 2015 UTC,"I am just starting this process for my wife who is ill with fibro/CFS. It seems like it will be a long process and we will probably get rejected a few times but I would start the process.  Unfortunately you don't know how long you won't be well. Disability is based on when you file so even if you have to fight for a few years, when you get approved it is based on when you apply which can be a decent chunk of change.  In my research a few important things:   1) make sure your doctor notes have specific examples of how severe, frequent, and the duration of your symptoms.   2) make sure you have a diagnosis of CFS / fibro and that other symptoms are also documented (anxiety, depression, memory issues, concentration, etc). From what I've read disability judges have an easier time approving a claim if you present multiple plausible medical reasons for being impaired. (I.e. Applying as ""I ONLY have CFS"" is easier to reject than ""I have CFS, depression, anxiety, memory loss, brain fog"" because the criteria to meet the other conditions may be easier for them to rationalize in your record.   3) have your doctor fill out a physical functioning capacity form for you every 3 months (google it). Make sure they are detailed and tie your symptoms in accurately. Long story short the way disability usually works is you submit all your medical records and then some doctor you've never seen reads thru and tries to make sense of it all and uses that knowledge to fill out a form stating how limited you are by your condition. Sound strange? It is. My guess is this is the reason many people are denied; the interpreting doctor has no context for the notes and I'm sure the medical records don't contain the whole picture which tells a better story.   BUT get this: if you have your doctor fill out that form themselves, then disability has to use it instead (as long as your doctors conclusions don't go against widely accepted medical knowledge). This means that the person who knows your whole story can translate all that knowledge into a disability form stating your functional limitations and that should dramatically increase your chances of being accepted.  There are two types of functioning capacity forms: mental and physical. I would focus on the physical route of disability since mental unfortunately turns into a lot of ""it's just in their head"" garbage. Messed up but it's how it is.  NOTE: I have just started this process myself so I have no guarantees. But based on the research I've done it is my best guess at navigating disability."
Fibromyalgia,35aryc,Jumanji5000,1 point,Fri May 8 15:56:27 2015 UTC,"I ended up filing for SSDI after initially getting denied.  Even though the VA had me listed as unemployable.  I ended up hiring a lawyer from a commercial I saw.  The ones where you don't pay unless you win.  It still took a year to finally complete though.  I ended up getting a year of back pay, along with getting monthly SSDI.  The lawyer got a little over 3 grand, and I received somewhere over 8 grand.  If I'm remembering my numbers right, but they can't be far off.  I was listed to end up having to go to court for it.  I got a call from the lawyer saying that the SS department wanted to settle.  Someone bounced my case off of an expert as a hypothetical case.  He informed them there is no way I could find meaningful employment.  They then decided to settle.  Filling everything out was fairly easy to do, and everything was done via phone and fax.  I can't remember if I had to have more appointments, but I'm leaning towards no since SS already had all of my medical records.  I think I just had to give the lawyers permission to have access to my records for the case.    Be aware, if you have medical insurance now it may affect that.  I was on Tricare Prime Retiree (38$ a month.)  When you qualify for SSDI, you are required to have Medicare both A and B.  That isn't all bad, but it costs you 138$ out of your monthly stipend.  For me, that caused Tricare to dump me to Tricare for life, which is free.  However my cost went up because of having to have Medicare (again 138$ a month.)  On the bright side, I have no co-pays for anything anymore.  So, I'd suggest trying on your own first.  If/when you get turned down, hit up a lawyer."

Fibromyalgia,35967c,Worddroppings,1 point,Fri May 8 04:45:38 2015 UTC,I also habe have a similar fear. I see my rheumatologist for the first time (in a few yrs) on the 18rh and am worried what may happen. My mother has fibro and 3 knee surgeries. Scares me. But I know going to the rheumy is the best outlet I have. Been in therapy since 2002...therapy helps ONLY if you tell the truth.
Fibromyalgia,35967c,KimAndNumbers,1 point,Fri May 8 05:55:28 2015 UTC,I only saw rheumatologist for a diagnosis of fibro then they never wanted to see me again. You might be better with a pain specialist.
Fibromyalgia,357loj,lbsmith5,2,Thu May 7 19:46:15 2015 UTC,"Doesn't directly answer your question but if your insurance doesn't cover Lyrica you can often get it through Pfizer Patient Assistance Program. It takes 4-6 weeks to kick in, but is magical and free.  http://www.pfizer.com/health/financial_assistance_programs/patient_assistance_programs"
Fibromyalgia,357loj,kwxt,1 point,Fri May 8 00:42:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I looked into it. Right now, since I'm still with my husband, he makes too much, but we're getting divorced and I should be able to jump on it then if gaba doesn't work."
Fibromyalgia,357loj,trinlayk,1 point,Fri May 8 00:53:37 2015 UTC,"I did that for awhile, I was trying to avoid the swollen ankles and feet from the Lyrica.     Apparently this works fine for some people (including some friends of mine) but I didn't really do any better on the gabapentin than I did on the Lyrica, it was just different side effects.    The level of relief either way, was about the same. (I'm just someone who has issues with side effects, but I'm going to be asking to go back on the Lyrica soon, possibly a smaller dose, the ankles and feet swelling were a problem, but I was generally more functional.)"

Fibromyalgia,357loj,IdleRhymer,1 point,Fri May 8 00:58:23 2015 UTC,900mg daily or 900mg multiple times a day? I had a crack neurologist who gave me 2700mg a day and the max dose is like 1800mg.   I was on gaba for a good six months and it always worked well! That said I haven't been on Lyrica. Mostly wanted to clarify the dosage. Someone here caught me that my dose was too high haha.
Fibromyalgia,357loj,hadapurpura,1 point,Thu May 7 22:31:32 2015 UTC,"900mg daily - split up over dinner/bedtime. I always thought 300mg was the max for Lyrica but I've seen people on like 600mg, so idk!"
Fibromyalgia,357loj,deedee22,1 point,Fri May 8 00:57:22 2015 UTC,"I did that and found that the gabapentin worked better for me than the Lyrica. I think it's probably just down to your personal body chemistry, you should give it a chance. I take 1200mg a day."
Fibromyalgia,357loj,sjhaines,1 point,Thu May 7 22:47:06 2015 UTC,"Good to know :) Lyrica didn't work 100%, previous doc wanted to up it to 300mg but I couldn't afford it. Hopefully this will work better."
Fibromyalgia,3575xq,stormyfuck,3,Thu May 7 17:48:20 2015 UTC,"Psychiatrist = can prescribe drugs, psychologist = cannot. Counselors and therapists have less education required to be licensed than psychologists, but depending on the person & their experience with specific issues, a therapist or counselor might be a winner. I saw a ""life coach"" for a while, and she was amazing, but I picked her for her experience with LGBT, polyamorous, and chronic medical condition related issues."
Fibromyalgia,3575xq,DjGhettoSteve,2,Thu May 7 18:51:26 2015 UTC,Thank you for clarifying the differences between the three! I didn't understand the difference at first and wasted a lot of time and energy looking for the wrong things from the wrong people.
Fibromyalgia,3575xq,Nillithwen,3,Fri May 8 04:57:34 2015 UTC,"All I can do is relate my experience here.   I chose a psychiatrist,  because I was having suicidal thoughts at least 4 or 5 days out of the week,  and had been for years.   So when I finally got insurance,  I knew that it was time to find some pills to help.   I'm also going to a counselor to talk things through and deal with the underlying things,  but the pills are keeping me level.   I do still have the thoughts,  but not nearly as often.     So you have to decide if talking would help you more,  or if you really need to just adjust your chemicals while you work everything out.   Wishing you best of luck!"
Fibromyalgia,3575xq,PolyUnsaturatedGoat,1 point,Thu May 7 19:35:03 2015 UTC,My GP prescribed antidepressants for me a while ago (and recently increased) but I'm still having suicidal thoughts/severe depression bouts most days. I think a counselor might be the best option for me at this point. Thanks!
Fibromyalgia,3575xq,PolyUnsaturatedGoat,1 point,Fri May 8 13:04:44 2015 UTC,"Good!   Cover all your bases.   Life has so many good things to offer,  and it would be a shame to let this disease take those things away."
Fibromyalgia,3575xq,lbsmith5,2,Fri May 8 17:17:28 2015 UTC,I see a psychiatrist. I find it's helpful that she automatically has a medical background so I feel she's better equipped to deal with fibro and all of my other health issues. She's not covered by my insurance though and she's suggested I see a therapist or counselor more frequently but the thought of juggling two is just exhausting.
Fibromyalgia,3575xq,Kromulent,1 point,Thu May 7 19:38:14 2015 UTC,"That's what my thinking was as well, that it would be simpler to see someone who could prescribe & listen. My insurance only covers a few psychiatrists in the area, so it might be cheaper for me to see a counselor and have my GP subscribe."
Fibromyalgia,3575xq,Jumanji5000,2,Fri May 8 13:01:45 2015 UTC,"I think the correct match is 90% personality and sharing a compatible philosophy, and 10% education.  Even if you need meds, your psychologist can recommend an appropriate script from your current doctor, or refer you briefly to psychiatrist as needed.  I can only speak for my own experience but I find there are three things that make it work:   One, I feel like the person helping me is reasonable and trustworthy and knows what the hell they are doing. This means I will be willing to extend trust and to do what they say to do, even if it pushes me outside my comfort zone, or if it seems to not be helpful right away.  Two, I feel safe talking to them, not feeling judged or minimized or criticized.   Three - and this one is crucial - I do not feel the need to be liked by them. I am willing to be unlikeable, to let my hair down and show my weaknesses, and show the sides of me that I'm most ashamed of. I think this is the key to an effective therapeutic relationship. I am not dating my shrink, I am spilling my guts to my shrink. Protecting my self image is the last thing I want to bother with.  The end result is that all the darkness comes out, and I end up being willing to do things to fix it that I would otherwise not do. That is the whole point, after all. Anything less than that is just cheating yourself.  Kiss as many toads as you need to, to find the right person. They will be worth it when you do."
Fibromyalgia,357a5z,jensicle1,2,Thu May 7 18:20:27 2015 UTC,"I switched to working from home, which has been one of the best decisions of my life. I have more control over my environment, can wear whatever is best (including the days when I slip into a half dozen braces), and have been lucky with very understanding bosses in the last year (had to get a lot of doctors notes, but as long as my doc verified stuff they would fight for me with HR) & I'm now able to get fmla to better cover me. I still have days where I don't wanna play, but I tell myself as I go through the day ""just get one more hour"" instead of mentally focusing on a full shift at once. I also keep a full supply of cannabis candies, salve, and oil on hand, which each have very specific dosage & usage - to be clear I'm not getting high all day, most of the products I use for work have zero effect on mental state."
Fibromyalgia,357a5z,DjGhettoSteve,1 point,Thu May 7 18:38:37 2015 UTC,Ditto all of the above. Work from home + medical cannabis state = productive during the toughest days.

Sounds like you've struck a really good balance. I've had all my pain meds halved since moving to a new city and it has thrown me really off track. People notice now that I walk 'funny' and I wince. I was so angry but have no alternative. Really happy to hear people out there are contributing to society but still managing :) I'd hate to give up work and not due to shame or stigma, just because I like using my brain and have trained!"

I left the gym hours ago and my right arm is still twitching and in pain. all in a day's work though! it'll hopefully pay off"
Fibromyalgia,3553f2,ghoulianna,4,Thu May 7 04:22:20 2015 UTC,Burning pain is a common symptom but usually it is associated with exertion.  If you feel that it is outside of the range of symptoms that you normally experience make an appointment to see your doctor and properly document and monitor the new symptom. That's all you can really do.
Fibromyalgia,3553f2,Le_Squish,1 point,Thu May 7 04:55:27 2015 UTC,"Very well said! Yes, this is something I experience frequently, but it never hurts to bring it up with your doc. :) best of luck."
Fibromyalgia,3553f2,BradburySauce,2,Thu May 7 09:11:16 2015 UTC,"Hey there twin, I'm also 22 with RA and Fibro diagnoses. My nerve/muscle pain started before my RA and I have a diagnosed muscle condition beyond FMS that my neurologist treats me for and it sounds kind of like that the burning fiery muscles. Mine is constant and without exertion as another user mentioned. I'd it persists a neuro check up could be useful if only for peace of mind. Try some topical numbing or menthol / capsicum creams. Good luck I hope you feel better!"
Fibromyalgia,3553f2,zebra-stampede,2,Thu May 7 14:20:24 2015 UTC,"It is extremely common for someone with diffuse amplified musculoskeletal pain (like fibromyalgia) to develop localized amplified musculoskeletal pain (like CRPS or localized amplified pain without autonomic changes). Amplified pain can develop anywhere in the body and there is a lot of overlap between subtypes.  A doctor well versed in amplified pain syndromes will be able to tell you whether or not it's that. If it is more amplified pain, talk to your doctor about using lots and lots of physical and occupational therapy to desensitize those sympathetic nerves, which is what they do at quaternary care centers for teens/young adults with amplified pain syndromes. It's extremely effective if the quantity and quality of PT and OT are right."
Fibromyalgia,354ltp,FibroMan,3,Thu May 7 01:40:06 2015 UTC,"I have been through so many freaking doctors because of the Fibro because the majority of them are IDIOTS!!!! I feel your pain! I finally found a chiro that gets my condition, but I'm still searching for a good rheumy and physical therapist. I think your idea of tracking down your old physio is very wise. Don't give that idiot another thought!"
Fibromyalgia,354ltp,Gr33n_Rider,3,Thu May 7 14:22:32 2015 UTC,"I myself have had the ""flat feet are causing your pain"" BS diagnosis. A lot of the time, at least in my experience, physios decide something, give you exercises and stretches to do, and no matter how effective they are, they said that it's working and you're just ""sore""! It really sucks, they had me doing constant arm exercises when I was diagnosed with tendinitis, and it made my arm completely useless and so painful until I just stopped, and it got better!  I might recommend trying to find someone new? If your doc is not willing to listen and work with you, she/he is not worth your time!"
Fibromyalgia,354ltp,manipulationcreation,3,Thu May 7 01:51:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear you had such a horrid consultation. There are physios out there that understand fibro, I hope you are able to see a different one.  Though it won't solve the root problem of fibro, have you tried orthotics for your shoes? I'm flat footed and they make shoes so much more comfortable."
Fibromyalgia,354ltp,neogetz,2,Thu May 7 06:41:51 2015 UTC,"Actually, my physio recommended NOT getting orthotics.  Using exercises to strengthen the muscles is supposed to be better than using orthotics, which can make the muscles lazier.  I think he is probably right about that part."
Fibromyalgia,354ltp,neogetz,3,Thu May 7 08:13:38 2015 UTC,"I guess each situation is different. I got mine on the reccommendation of my physio but as everybody's body is different what applies to one doesn't apply to the next. Best thing is to stick with the advice of those who work with you rather than us voices on the internet. :)     I really hope you get to see your old physio, or a new good one, and find a treatment which helps."

Fibromyalgia,34z79l,elastical_gomez,9,Tue May 5 19:54:06 2015 UTC,"Hey, I can completely relate to how you feel to some sense. I have my days where the flare is so bad I just wish I could crawl into a ball and die. The only thing that keeps me going is my boyfriend and our pets. The amount of guilt I would have leaving them keeps me going through even on my worse of days.  I know its hard to see now, but there is always going to a small ray of sunshine peeking through all of the darkness. Some days you may close the blinds on that ray of sunshine and other days its gonna cause you to be curious and go chasing after it. On those good days enjoy it. Embrace it because those are the days that make the bad ones bearable and beautiful.  We as people suffering from fibromyalgia have a secluded sense of feeling and life because we can't control what the day brings, we just hope we can get through it. I know its a difficult road to travel and some are lucky enough to have someone hold their hand the entire time. For the ones who think they are alone. Come here to this subreddit, we are a special group of people who are lucky enough to find others who are suffering and that are our supporters and cheerleaders in a way. This place makes me feel like I will not ever be alone even when I feel alone because they are here to support one another and get through this together. Its a truly beautiful thing to rely on strangers in a sense.  So please read this and on those extra terrible days remember what I said. I hope it makes a difference. Please remember you are never truly alone."

This community has been surprisingly supportive and sweet. I'm overwhelmed reading all these kind words. Thank you again! I hope your days go easy on you."
Fibromyalgia,34z79l,Jseanw60x,5,Wed May 6 22:13:44 2015 UTC,"I have felt that way countless times, I am 21 and got diagnosed at 17. After years of daily pain, nausea, inability to eat and other difficult issues I would have days where I just wish I could die because I felt I knew in my heart this would never end. I had a friend who has fibromyalgia as well and had it for years and finally got diagnosed with Lyme Disease, and after 6 years I got diagnosed as well. I am not sure if that could be a possibility for you but just for some knowledge on the disease the testing for lyme is very flawed, usually a doctor will use a test that only recognizes bacteria from a tick bite that occured within about 6 months. However if your symptoms have been occurring for a longer time more advanced testing is needed. The encouraging thing is there is a treatment, the longer you've been having symptoms though the longer treatment takes. I hope for your sake you check out if you have chronic lyme disease, I wish someone would have mentioned it to me in my early days of ""managing"" my symptoms. We all have good days and bad days, but there is hope that the good days become more frequent. Take solace in the days or hours you feel well and be in nature, get some sunlight and let yourself be present. Also don't be afraid to use anything you need that helps you feel better, for me its comfortable blankets, incense and candles, baths and fiddling with stones/crystals. I know how hard it is to feel positive or even happy, but if you need to cry, cry, and know that you are strong, capable, and a fighter not a victim to your body. I hope something I said helped, and I hope you begin to feel better mentally and physically."

Of  course I could be putting random things together but I remember being bitten by something while camping my sophomore year of college... Symptoms started around a year afterward. Huh.   Most medications that are approved for fibro have little to no effect on me. Did you experience something similar? Right now, literally the only relief I've found is through a fentanyl patch even though I know opiate therapy isn't exactly condoned for Fibromyalgia. It's so hard due to my age to not be treated like a junkie for it either. I've been dismissed more times than I can count.   Thank you for the suggestion and support, I'll look into it more. Your response as well as others have really helped! I hope you get some sustainable relief if you haven't already. (gentle Internet hug)"

I can relate to how you feel and honestly, thanks for being honest. Everyone around me always wants to see the bright side that I never get to talk about how I really feel and what I've lost.  I've also lost much of my looks (gained about 80 lbs when it's all said and done) and I have no job and no friends anymore. I have no energy to be a good friend and at this point, I'm not reliable enough to work. Sometimes I think to myself, Gr33n_Rider, it's been 2 years since you were diagnosed and what do you have to show for it.  I also, lay in bed feeling sorry for myself (and rightly so) for the first few months. We all do. Then I got angry and I started to fight back. I went to a physical therapist first and a chiropractor. Then I gained enough strength to swim, then to do the stationary bike at the gym. Then I gained enough strength to lift weights and finally, here I am doing yoga. Never imagined any of this two years ago. You will get your passions back, you will get your career back, it's just a matter of building your strength back up slowly.

I'm active in an online group of lovely ladies that play my favorite video game, and I play that a lot while propped up on the couch with my heating pad and ice pack. I also do things that make me feel like I'm still making a difference. For me that's wildlife rehab. I'm currently caring for 2 orphaned baby bunnies, and without me, they wouldn't make it. It is a painful struggle to get up and get going to get them fed 4 times a day, but it gives me purpose and I'm making a difference in the world without ever leaving my house or changing out of my pajamas. In between their feedings I mostly sleep, because that doesn't hurt, but when I'm awake, I have two super cuddly babies that depend on me to distract me from the pain. I'm going in soon for a steroid treatment that I'm hoping will help with the migraine situation. I'm always sorry to see others in my situation, especially that are my age.

No matter how bad the flare is, I still find it in me to play with her when she gives me that doopy smile.   I too have joined a great gaming guild where the members seem to be really supportive and understanding about my condition. Sometimes the migraines get too bad to look at the screen (dual 27"" monitors = OUCH)  and I can't make it to my events. Somehow they still keep me around and I'm quite grateful for it. It's a good distraction and social outlet for me.   I'm happy I found this community though. I've mostly lurked, and reading other people's experiences help, even if it's just to know I'm not alone.

But this....drive....to create work to help people understand this is what keeps me going.  I'm a shittier technician than I was before but I feel like I have a purpose.  Never give up.  It's normal to have thoughts like this.  Let yourself wallow in them and cry profusely (I certainly do).  Then, when you're all cried out, get back on the horse and make a life for yourself.

Fibromyalgia,34vfco,Ridiculous_Diagnosis,2,Mon May 4 21:55:30 2015 UTC,Why don't you share a little more about your weight lifting routine?  I'm sure some people would love to hear about it.  Are you doing cardio as well?
Fibromyalgia,34vfco,KittyL0ver,2,Tue May 5 00:41:24 2015 UTC,"Sure! I basically use 3 as my theme. 3 muscle groups for me: core, upper body, lower body. I rotate them.  I track what weight I start with, even if I am weaker the next go around and have to lower weight (due to fibro related pain). I do 3 sets of 10 reps at each machine. I don't do free weights yet because I need the stability with form that comes with using the machines. My muscles are so weak and tense anyway that this is all I can handle for now.   I do cardio every day too. It's ambitious but better for me this way. I usually go between intense cardio and light cardio. I use the bike if I'm sore or fibro-afflicted. I use the elliptical for intense cardio and can do about 30 minutes at the lowest resistance level right now. In gym outings previous to weight lifting, I could handle longer sessions with more resistance but I think because I'm in the gym every day, my muscles take longer to repair.   I don't ever feel bad or sorry for however light a weight setting may be on a given machine. The amazing thing is that I'm there and not writhing on my couch. I also will sometimes swap cardio in the gym for hiking up the mountain by my house or walking 5+ miles outside (the sunlight seriously improves my mood).  I don't take days off because I have in the past and I find that resting makes my joints stiffen up and then dull ache turns to sharp stabby. Rotating muscle groups makes this possible. Some days I can only handle 10 minutes on the bike for my cardio and THATS STILL AWESOME. And if I can't make it to the gym, I try to walk for at least 30 minutes. So long as it's every day.

When I first had my son, I had trouble lifting him some days, and he only weighed 7 lbs.  Now he's over 20 lbs, and I can lift him easily most days.  I've always enjoyed cardio, so I go on walks or swim in the summer.    Keep up the good work!"
Fibromyalgia,34vfco,DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,1 point,Tue May 5 01:19:55 2015 UTC,"I started weight lifting a year ago, and it's been the best thing I've ever done for fibro.    Rotating muscle groups makes this possible. Some days I can only handle 10 minutes on the bike for my cardio and THATS STILL AWESOME.   This, exactly this! I spread out the muscles I work and allow each area to rest.  I also listen to my body and don't push myself more than I should.  I focus on simply doing something as opposed to always pushing to do more. I am ok with having to go to lower weights than I may have the week prior because for whatever reason I just can't push the same, and that's awesome! Or maybe I start off the work out strong, but my strength fades faster than normal. That's still awesome! Because I am still there. And sometimes I feel like will barely be able to walk 10 mins and find that after warming up my energy kicks in and I can do an entire workout. I have no competition except myself, and my only competition is creating a habit of moving in any form.   I've been able to work out at least 2 days a week weight lifting, and some months I go every day and walk (I find walking on a treadmill doesn't cause a flare like walking on sidewalks do), and some months it's only the 2 days. But I've kept it up for a year and I feel so much better. I am able to be more active, and I have been able to add more things into my life than a year ago.   Good job! I'm glad you are reacting well to it."

I'm already doing keto, and my IBS symptoms have dramatically decreased.  So we're totally on the same page there.  You can power through the carb-flu.  It just takes a few days and suddenly the hunger and cravings disappear.    I used to lift a lot in my twenties, and since I've stopped, my fibro has gotten real bad.  Medication has helped, but I've gone soft and gotten a little fatter.  I want that body back, and the energy and vitality and strength that went with it.  Thanks for posting here! You've definitely inspired me!"

I think you should ask the Doctor or Pharmacist about taking a probiotic. You're on antibiotics to help you get better, but they're also killing the good bacteria in your intestines. I ended up at the Hospital ER after taking the antibiotic Cipro. I had severe diarrhea and became dehydrated. I was given 5 bags of IV fluids and was at the ER for 9 hours. I felt awful for weeks!! So after all I went thru, someone told me about taking probiotics while on antibiotics. Since then I have read this too. I now take a probiotic on a regular basis. In the US, I buy ""Ultimate Flora"" brand because the pill is a ""delayed release capsule"". That is important because all the probiotic goes into the intestines and not the stomach. ((I'm not in the medical field at all, just wanted to tell you this. Please follow up with a professional)). Take Care."
Fibromyalgia,34vzj1,lbsmith5,2,Tue May 5 01:49:42 2015 UTC,I almost ended up in the hospital after Cipro as well.

Fibromyalgia,34vrgz,alieber,2,Mon May 4 23:32:36 2015 UTC,"Take a look at http://www.docsopinion.com/health-and-nutrition/hscrp/  ""Above 10 mg/mL usually indicates acute inflammation ... Because there are many disparate conditions that can increase CRP and hs-CRP, an elevated CRP level does not indicate a specific disease.""  In other words, you have something that is causing short term inflammation.  The test result of 19 is not a valid indicator of risk of heart disease."
Fibromyalgia,34vrgz,FibroMan,2,Tue May 5 01:56:20 2015 UTC,CRP is really a garbage test for Cardiovascular risk because it is so nonspecific.  C reactive protein is just a biomarker of inflammation.  You obviously have some inflammation going on in your body.  I'm sure that's why your doctor ordered more tests.
Fibromyalgia,34vrgz,Zygomycosis,1 point,Tue May 5 02:46:00 2015 UTC,Any ideas of what tests have now been ordered?

Fibromyalgia,34v0ui,burritopalace,5,Mon May 4 20:08:51 2015 UTC,"I was never a heavy drinker, so on the few times a year I am out socially, I have a few drinks after I tested it out at home with my husband to make sure I wasn't going to pass out or anything. It can increase the effects of the alcohol so it's easy to drink too much too fast and that's when the issue can kick in. As long as you're sort of on top of it, you should be fine ~~ my experience only of course ~~  Also, unrelated, but it's always good to check WHY you're advised not to drink when you're on a med. I have been on a medication for rheumatoid arthritis that can mess up your liver and had to get monthly blood tests to check it, so when I was on that, I didn't drink at all. Both of my parents are heavy drinkers and have liver issues, but it's one of those things we aren't sure if the alcohol caused it or just exacerbated something that was already there."
Fibromyalgia,34v0ui,lbsmith5,4,Mon May 4 20:37:07 2015 UTC,"This is the best answer. Technically, every prescription bottle should have a warning about alcohol for liability reasons. Your biggest threat from taking an antidepressant and a muscle relaxer with alcohol is that the effects of the alcohol will be moderately to severely magnified, mostly by the antidepressant. The only times in my life I've blacked out drinking were when taking antidepressants and thinking I could drink my usual amount. One drink, fine, second drink, stumbles, third drink I wake up the next morning feeling very scared and thankful to be waking up in my own bed. I'm guessing drinking at any average college function will make it even harder to pace yourself, so if you decide to risk it be VERY careful. The first time I had a single beer after starting Bupropion (antidepressant) I was immediately drunk and had to stop, and I'm in my thirties so have a good idea what my limits are. I hope you know yourself well if you decide to try it."
Fibromyalgia,34v0ui,Lessthanzerofucks,1 point,Mon May 4 20:54:36 2015 UTC,"Yep, I'm 32, so I've had plenty years 'experience' or whatever. Try it in a safe place with someone you trust before going out into the world.  Also, if you're worried about pacing yourself, be prepared with some lines like ""I'm good right now""/""I haven't finished this drink yet"" etc etc so you don't have to explain why you're drinking slowly or whatever."

But even then, i you are not already inclined to keep alcohol consumption under wraps, i would just go without.  Even small amounts of anti depressants can fuck some ppl up. Add alcohol in the mix and people die. I hate bringing doom n gloom into it, but you need to know just how serious this is.  That said, there is another way. I gave up alcohol completely at your age, didnt touch it for nearly 10 years.  What i found is that its not actually because of not drinking that you dont have fun at parties. You dont have fun because you feel left out , because you exclude yourself from activities. If you can manage to give in just once or twice when your friend grabs you and says come on lets go, you might find you can still have fun if you learn to include yourself and let the fun take care of itself. You will still feel like shit the next day, but not half as bad as if you went on an alcohol fueled rampage.   Like everything, we have to take these things in moderation or we will be worse off. But if we can allow ourselves to join in the fun occasionally, we might learn the good can sometimes outweigh the bad.  Give it a try. Just go join in whatever is happening next time. I promise you, those who are drunk wont have a clue that youre not."
Fibromyalgia,34v0ui,kwxt,2,Tue May 5 05:46:48 2015 UTC,"It look me a little while to figure out how to be at parties without being able to drink. I find that people are most comfortable if I'm holding a drink, but that they don't really care if I'm drinking it. I usually could do a few sips without major consequences so that passed for ""drinking"". Also Coca-Cola often passes for beer if people aren't looking closely enough (which they mostly aren't). Parties aren't as fun when people start getting sloppy and you're still sober, but I never found them that fun at that point anyways..."

Amitriptyline is a tricyclic and those definitely don't mix well with booze. They are fairly sedating on their own. SSRIs are a better choice if you want to drink.   You don't have to drink to have fun. You can be the designated driver and have soda or have the bartender make you some fun mixed drinks sans alcohol, like a virgin margarita or something.

I'm also on amytrip but it is a really small dose so I don't feel any difference.  I think while you are beginning the meds you need to be careful because you don't know how you are going to react - with or without alcohol.  You do need to be careful but I don't generally worry about it with my regular meds.  I don't drink if I'm on the heavier stuff.

Any stress on our minds or bodies can cause us to be more irritable. The thing is though that having fibro does not give you a free ""snap anytime I want"" card. As with anyone in mental or physical pain we are under more stress and strain than the ""normals"". That is not an excuse or a get out of jail free card for our behavior. My husband is a disabled vet and is in constant physical pain. When he snaps at me, it still hurts. We allow ourselves a bit more leeway than people who don't have problems but we also work very hard to make sure we don't snap at each other or anyone else often. That may mean taking quiet time or learning relaxation techniques. Be mindful of how you are feeling and try and take preventative actions before that snap happens.

I thought a demon child was clawing itself out of my stomach for two hours as I cried and puked on my bathroom floor. That was last week. I freaked and looked up all the hospitals in my area, etc etc. I haven't had an issue since actually. It could be you had a stone that passed. Maybe you'll have more but now you know what to do. In so far as my research went there was no conclusive link between diet and gallstones but I know a few people who have sworn changes helped. In my not medical expertise it seems like the stones are either there or not, and they'll either be blocking the biliary duct or not (that's the pain), but beyond that you can't mentally stress yourself into one. I had my attack on a Monday I think and had to move out of a two story apartment and drive four hundred miles back home on Thursday and I never managed to knock one back into a compromising position. Everyone is different of course and I'd probably lay off any extraneous gym time or other activities but there is a chance that you could be fine! Don't stress yourself out.

I've already passed several of the smaller ones (They show up in your stool) but when those large ones get stuck. dear god, a demon child clawing its way out sounds about right. My first attack lasted 6 hours, I was so tired and weak when it finally passed. I've had 4 more attacks since then and the niggling aching pain has been constant since the first attack. I'm not sure if the niggling pain is due to actual inflammation of the gallbladder, or if it's just because my fibromyalgia is causing a lingering tenderness after the attacks.  Regardless, you are certainly right and stress will be a major trigger for further attacks, so I need to stay on top of that.  I'm so sorry you had to deal with this too, and while driving so far too, youch."

I'm hoping it was a one off thing since it hasn't come back. I'm so sorry that you keep having attacks! That sounds awful. I've gotten twinges of pain for brief moments the last week and it's like instant panic mode of ""omg is this happening again?!""  I hope it stays calm for you though!"

It's so awesome that your mom can take care of you, I think it will make a huge difference. Just focusing on your clinicals and not having to worry about meal prep and laundry and cleaning will reserve a lot of your energy.  I'm rooting for you! Tramadol is so ridiculously effective for me even at a very small dose. I can take half of my 50 mg pill and it takes care of it. Get GREAT sleep. And address anxiety issues so you don't have to deal with that and you will feel so free and capable.   I'm hoping the worst of your stones is over! Drink lots of water!"
Fibromyalgia,34pko7,lbsmith5,1 point,Sun May 3 18:29:50 2015 UTC,"I have gallstones too. They were acting up for a few weeks and just stopped. That was a year ago. I know it's short there because mine are large and unpassable I guess. So, you may be fine! Best of luck to you and try not to stress - the stress is probably what's exacerbating your symptoms."
Fibromyalgia,34pko7,PeacefulTreeLand,1 point,Sun May 3 18:42:04 2015 UTC,"I would honestly try and really relax here, because I think it sounds more like you had a stress induced gallbladder attack. How is that for broscience? Really though, my husband's flared as well but it also wasn't really fitting the normal criteria either. By the time he got seen by the surgeon a month later he was feeling better. Our bodies are so sensitive that you very well could have caused some stress in that area and it just needs to chill out.  As for your clinicals, is that commute by train? Find a way that you can take 10-15 mins each morning to write down everything and anything that is worrying you. School, Home, Spiritual, other important topic. Now in life we always have to decided what we do today, what we might do and what we have to leave for another day. If something is a major item that has to be taken care of you place a star next to it. If it is in complete realistic ability to get it done today, then you circle it. If you know there is nothing you can do about that today, you put a check mark next to it. This exercises allows you to address all your worries and to dos, even the ones you can't get to have been recognized, thought about and set aside. For me, it really helps release a lot of the stress and worry when I am in busy times. Plus I feel so happy because like half my to do list is checked off within 15 mins each morning! That's an accomplishment!!"
Fibromyalgia,34pko7,Mimsy34,1 point,Sun May 3 20:21:54 2015 UTC,"You are certainly right and stress will be a major trigger for further attacks, so I need to stay on top of that.  I've had 5 attacks in total and I'm still suffering from a dull but distracting ache in my side, I'm certain the worse has passed, I have seen several medium sized stones pass and well as tens of little ones, But I know I have 7 large ones still inside that were spotted on the scan, but they shouldn't move too much as long as I avoid fatty nuts (because that would stimulate the gallbladder to try and release bile, which would only push the stones toward the ducts)  The commute is by train, But My brother and I are going to have a talk about it because his University campus is very close to the place I will be doing my rotation, so if we can organise for him to give me a lift home after my shift that would be very helpful. One thing I need to learn to do is to ask for a seat on the train, I'm usually way to self conscious of the invisibility of my illness to ask, but I know I am going to have to if I want to make it through the day.  I really like your list idea, I do something very similar at the moment with a traffic light system, activities that are green use almost no energy compared to the spiritual/emotional/physical reward I get from completing them, Amber activities mean take it slow and steady but have a try, and red means ""nope, not today"""
Fibromyalgia,34pko7,Zygomycosis,1 point,Mon May 4 01:33:13 2015 UTC,"My gallbladder flared up a few weeks after my son was born in 2005. I ended up having surgery 4 months after he was born. My doctor told me it's based on the four f's. Female, fertile, fair, and obese...you can see what the other f would be. Although my husband doesn't exactly fit that profile, he ended up having have his out as well. And he is not obese.  You said you were on a raw vegan diet, and myself being ignorant, do you eat anything that might be fatty? Onions are fatty type producing foods that can cause your liver to push out a bunch of bile, and cause the gallbladder to have an attack from the stones being squished around. Just curious. Good luck with everything. And with the surgery. :)"

Fibromyalgia,34p5ma,jdw1066,3,Sun May 3 07:07:18 2015 UTC,"Hiya, firstly I'm sorry you're going through this - I know how difficult and frustrating it all can be when trying to get diagnosed, let alone the pain, discomfort and fog. I've been in a similar situation to yourself, I don't want to draw too many comparisons because the one thing I've learnt from reading people's stories on this sub is that everyone's experience of fibro and associated illnesses is completely unique - Migraines can be a symptom of fibro, but also MS. It could be that you have both, but it probably will take a while to get a ""proper"" diagnosis, so try to hang in there in the mean time and cope with the symptoms as best you can.  I know that more recent studies have suggested that fibro is/could be a neurological condition, which I guess just makes it even more complicated if you've got overlapping symptoms. If you have the resources/plan then try and get an MRI, if you haven't already. If you've got doctors telling you different things, just try to communicate what the others have said, to each other. In my experience that helps, but what really matters is your quality of life - If you aren't already, keep a pain diary and a fog diary, try to establish if you're on any meds, what could be side effects rather than your illness. I hope you find the answers you need and ways to manage - Take care :)"
Fibromyalgia,34p5ma,JoLOLokia,2,Sun May 3 09:47:31 2015 UTC,"When you do see a neurologist, be sure they do a brain scan as well as spine.  I have encountered multiple patients whose MS diagnoses were delayed because they did not have a brain scan.  I suggest you get this done as soon as possible.  If it is MS, it is very important to start treatment right away."
Fibromyalgia,34p5ma,DoubleD_RN,1 point,Sun May 3 20:23:35 2015 UTC,"Hello - just dropping by to say migraines are now recognised as an MS symptom-ish. I have both.  I have had extra pain that appeared about 2 years ago that was ""not MS-like""...and there were no other failed tests and so me being here in Fibro...until November last year when out of the blue I had a hot flash and surprise-surprise it looks like the pain is a peri-menopause symptom.  So - what doctors know about, and are confident to diagnose is rather small. They get it wrong a lot of the time and they see most patients that say ""pain"" as drug seekers. Took me over 15 years to get an MS diagnosis so hang in there ;)"
Fibromyalgia,34p5ma,SphynxKitty,1 point,Sun May 3 07:38:35 2015 UTC,"My suggestion is start a medical diary. I do mine in video form. Even when I'm too exhausted to write coherently I can usually at least briefly recap things verbally. Reiterating things verbally can also help to cement things in your mind. It's also good emotionally. For me it's partially like talk therapy which is good because I can't afford a shrink right now. As for misdiagnosis and comorbidity- sure, anything's possible. My original diagnosis was Fibro, then a vertigo disorder was added, now they think dystonia (neurological movement disorder) and possibly Lupus or another connective tissue disorder. Chasing an elusive diagnosis sucks and takes a long time. I think after symptom treatment, the next most important thing is finding an emotional outlet. For me it's writing, painting, and watching standup comedy. For someone else, it might be yoga or pottery. Hobbies can be a saving grace, and I recommend everyone dealing with chronic illness to find something that gives them pleasure and pride. I hope you get answers soon, and good luck."
Fibromyalgia,34p5ma,jlmitch12,0,Wed May 6 05:51:25 2015 UTC,In my non-professional opinion you were correctly diagnosed with fibromyalgia and have recently developed MS.  The symptoms and progression of the two diseases are quite different.  It is entirely possible to have both.  I don't think you have any other neurological disorders.
Fibromyalgia,34ofkh,burritopalace,2,Sun May 3 01:19:26 2015 UTC,"It never happened to me while I was taking amitriptyline, at least not that I know of.  It sounds like it is doing what it is intended to do, ie make you sleep more deeply.  If it doesn't happen during the day then I don't think it is a problem.  I am more concerned about why you are having conversations when you should be sleeping ;)  It is worth discussing with your doctor.  It could be a sign that your dosage needs to be adjusted.  Not recording long term memories at night is good, but you don't want to stop recording long term memories during the day."
Fibromyalgia,34ofkh,FibroMan,2,Sun May 3 01:54:36 2015 UTC,"Right now I take amnitryptyline just at night 12 hours before I want to wake up and I am starting Flexeril (cyclobenzaprine) in a few days to take at 8 am/4 pm. I think my dosage is okay because I've been able to adjust it myself (I built up my dosage day by day to find the best spot to keep it at).  Haha, as for having conversations, my friends will wake me up/I'll wake back up on my own. It almost seems like I'm drunk."

Fibromyalgia,34ofkh,Laur-Ent,1 point,Sun May 3 02:23:19 2015 UTC,"What is happening when you do this? Are you sleep walking? Or do you appear to be totally lucid but just don't remember it in the morning?/  Also, what dose are you on?   I was on it for a year or two and ended up at 60mg/nightly. I was only 15/16 years old so it was too high of a dose. I found it TOTALLY knocked me out and it would take hours to feel fully awake each morning. Sometimes it'd cause me to forget what I was doing before I went to bed if I got the timing wrong. I decided to come off it in the end because it was making me extremely fatigued and I had constant brain fog. Coming off it was hard because I had become dependent on it for sleep.   I'd talk to your doctor about it. It's their job to sort out any problems with medication or dosage. And if it's causing you to get up or not have control over what you're doing, it could potentially be putting you at risk of some kind of accident."

I would do things like I normally would, but have no memory of the time transpired.  They would last anywhere from a few seconds to 30 mins.  During a 15 min one, I was driving through a shopping center.  My wife was talking to me the entire time.  I had no memory of it happening and she had no idea I was in autopilot.  She said I stopped for people, signaled, all of it.  I have no memory of it.  I'm not sure if this may be what is happening for you, but I haven't had an episode since everything has calmed down.

Fibromyalgia,34o23f,SnakeLady94,3,Sat May 2 22:59:39 2015 UTC,"I know exactly how you feel. It's not good news, but at least it's confirmation that something is wrong and there are treatments out there to make life a little better.  I do have a few tips that work for me, but keep in mind one of the frustrating things about fibromyalgia is everyone is different. Things that work for me, may not work for you and vice versa. But all I can do is offer some ideas, and hope even one of them help.  The biggest thing I can recommend for how to deal with fibro is listen to your body. If something causes you pain, i.e. a certain amount or type of exercise, accept it and try to adapt to something that isn't so hard on you. This could be as simple as shorter exercise periods, or low impact exercise. For me, swimming and water aerobics is a godsend, because the water allows those exercise sessions to be lower impact, thus not so much soreness and recovery time.   I also recommend stretching, every day, because the tendency to just not feel like doing anything some days can lead to ridiculous muscle stiffness, which can eventually lead to muscle spasms and aches when something comes up that I have to deal with. Daily, gentle stretches at least can help keep you flexible.   Don't be afraid to say no. If you're having a bad day and can't go out with a friend or loved one, don't do it. If you need to just relax, do so. Also don't be afraid to ask for help on a bad day. This was hard for me, because I always wanted to be so independent and do everything myself. It took me years and years to realize that, in the long run, letting people help me is better than pushing through a flare up and then paying for it for a longer period of time than if I'd just accepted the help in the first place.  I honestly haven't changed my diet much over the years, and I haven't had a huge amount of luck finding meds that will do much. I will swear by Lidocaine patches, for localized pain they have helped me more than anything else I've tried. For headaches, most of my headaches are stress related and usually a heating pad under my neck works wonders. I also try to do everything I can to lessen my stress levels. For a lot of people with fibro, stress can cause flare ups, and figuring out how to prevent and deal with stress has helped me to reduce the number of flare ups I've had. Sometimes this is done by just taking a me day, long baths, heating pads, etc.   A lot of this is going to be trial and error, don't be afraid to try anything your doctor or people here suggest, but also try not to get frustrated if something doesn't work. I've found I just have to stay persistent and positive, and keep trying things until I find the right combination that works for me.   I wish you luck and don't hesitate to post here with any questions or just to rant out your frustrations to people that will understand. This is an awesome community that's very supportive and I hope it helps you as much as it's helped me over the years."

Fibromyalgia,34mmri,dontdothatfool,1 point,Sun May 3 00:40:37 2015 UTC,The folks at /r/cbd recommend against it:   1: Hemp based CBD is unregulated and mainly sourced from China. Contamination from metals and pesticides are common.  2: Studies have shown that it is far more effective to combine CBD and THC in a 2:1 or 1:1 ratio.   I've found that the plant material left over from vaping - usually called ABV (Already Been Vaped) - produces a comforting body high with minimal mental impairment.

I don't usually take meds for any Fibro symptoms and this did nothing for any of them.  I've read quite a bit about using Namenda for allodynia.  If it hits me that hard again, I will try it.

It's expensive but I borrowed a copy from the VA where I'm on rotation as a student and printed a copy... You may be able to borrow it from a library. I like this book the best out of all the ones I've read.

Fell asleep, an hour later I had burns on the top of my feet. That hurt.   As far as more chemical ones, I once took the highest strength capsacin (I know I didn't spell that right but my phone doesn't know it) and I put it on my arm and ace bandaged all around it to keep it on mostly cause I was moving around. The burnnnn so much but also so good. I had marks in the shape of the patch (it was one of the weird ones with holes in it) for a day or two after. That said there are prescription versions of that your doctor can apply if you're having a serious problem.   I hope you feel better soon! Do you have any muscle relaxers? Edit: as for brands, Walmart has an equate brand that has three of the typical OTC ingredients in it and that's always worked well for me."

I can't use anything that gets cold because the cold causes me a lot of pain. I also use pain patches they adhere to your clothes instead of your skin to reduce risk of accidentally burning yourself if you have nerve damage and can't tell if it's hit enough to burn you.

Fibromyalgia,34gy8y,whenifeellikeit,2,Fri May 1 02:18:02 2015 UTC,"So what other meds are you on?    For me, the magic combo was Cymbalta and Neurontin.  The pain meds and muscle relaxers do a little for actual muscle pain, but nothing for the fibro pain.  FM pain isn't  muscular.  It's nerve pain.    If your med routine isn't working for you, then you need to press your doctor to put you on other medications.  This process can be frustrating.  It was frustrating for me, and I tried several meds before I found the right cocktail.  That took about two years, honestly.  The first medication I tried made my fatigue ten times worse and made me gain like 50lbs.  But I didn't give up, and neither should you.  You can do this.  This isn't a death sentence, but it's a life sentence, for sure.  What you have to focus on now is making that life sentence bearable for you.  So keep trying different meds.  You'll find a combo that works eventually."

Anything to put a silver lining on a crap situation. I find that doing that during a serious flare can sometimes chill it out. Or at the very least make it seem a little more tolerable.

Fibromyalgia,34gepz,DjGhettoSteve,2,Fri May 1 00:08:08 2015 UTC,"It really just depends on your specific symptoms and your doctor's personal boundaries. I have a GP, rheumy and a neurologist. My GP is comfortable prescribing pain meds so I don't need a specialist. My rheumy is in place to monitor me for signs of autoimmune issues (they think I may actually have Lupus or other connective tissue disease rather than Fibro). I have a neuro due to mobility issues and because I have seizure like episodes that he believes is a movement disorder called Dystonia. I recommend occasional chiropractor visits for everyone, though unfortunately my insurance doesn't cover that. See whoever you can afford to because you never know what combination of treatment will provide relief. Good luck."

Fibromyalgia,34bwpc,radiotott,7,Wed Apr 29 22:32:21 2015 UTC,"FMS is supposed to be a diagnosis of exclusion, but in my opinion (and I am not a medical professional, just someone who has been diagnosed with FMS by several different doctors) many doctors are happy to slap the FMS label on you as soon as it seems like it will fit.   I was first diagnosed by a pain management doctor. Not someone who should be diagnosing that disorder. He should have sent me to a specialist if that's what he suspected. Instead he was sure I had it and tried to treat me for it right off. I was lucky in that my dad was a doctor and he sent me for referrals to 4 or 5 different doctors who did all kinds of tests. I know I wouldn't have gotten those referrals without his personal relationship with them. I wound up having FMS, and also some other very serious problems that the first doctor didn't bother to look for because they generally don't do things like MRI's when they diagnose you with FMS. Unfortunately. There would have been no treatment for the other issues without this personal link I had, I don't doubt it.  This is just my opinion of course and I'm sure other people have had other experiences. I personally would not accept a diagnosis of FMS from anyone but a Rheumatologist. And I would only accept it if they had done all the testing necessary to make sure I didn't have any other illness or disease. If, like you, I had more pain in certain places or positions, I would make the doctor aware of that and ask for testing in those areas. I had a bone scan and that's how we started finding the problems in my shoulder, hips and back. Other scans were needed to really nail those issues down.  I'm so glad you found someone who listened to your explanations of your pain and got you the X-rays for your knees and found the problem, but I wouldn't completely write off the FMS diagnosis unless a Rheumatologist told you that you for sure do not have it. There are many symptoms for the syndrome that you can look up online and not all of them are physical. It would be best to make sure that is not an issue for you before completely dismissing it as they do have some good treatments available now that might be able to help you.  I wish you good luck no matter what the issue turns out to be. I hope you get the best treatment you can and feel better every day."

I have grating knees too, and my pain is most severe in my knees and hips.  I saw an Orthopedist this past Monday, and he did xrays and now wants an MRI.  He said I definitely have bursitis in my hips and prescribed Arthrotec (which has helped the hip pain a lot!).  He also said I had a lot of fluid in one knee, and needs the MRI to see more.

Fibromyalgia,34bwpc,FibroMan,1 point,Thu Apr 30 06:25:10 2015 UTC,"Cyclobenzaprine.  Though it didn't really do anything for my leg pain.  It maybe helped like 20%.  Arthotec so far has helped the pain more than anything else.  My primary care doctor wants me to get a second opinion on the fibromyalgia, but I honestly think I have severe adrenal fatigue and osteoarthritis (I am 47).  I have been taking herbal extracts like Holy Basil and Licorice, etc., for the adrenal fatigue and they seem to have helped the fatigue issues a lot, and I feel less stressed.  I bought some 00 gel capsules and put the liquid extract into those, so I don't even have to taste them.  I am starting to think that a LOT of people are being misdiagnosed with Fibro, and really have adrenal fatigue, which doctors for some odd reason seem to just ignore completely.  I had planned on seeing an endocrinologist to check my cortisol levels, but then I started to feel better after the extracts, so I never made the appointment.

The first trick is not to apply too much pressure with your hand. Think of it as a bannister that you can carry around with you, just a light touch to help steady yourself. You might think that a light touch wouldn't help, but it does.  The second trick is to adjust it to the right length.    The top of the cane should be at the level of your wrist when your arm is hanging comfortably at your side.   There are lots of choices available on Amazon. You don't need to spend more than $20 for something perfectly suitable."

I was really worried that using it would make my wrists even worse, but I found that I don't need to hold it in a death grip and put loads of weight on it. Like someone else said, it's just like having a light hand on your own personal banister. It really helps!  I've bought both of mine in funky colours from Amazon. The first one was lightweight cheap one, and they can both be folded up into a bag. Not something I need to do anymore but when I started using one I'd carry it around in my handbag on my good days so it was there if I needed it."

Fibromyalgia,349wic,Laur-Ent,1 point,Sun May 3 01:15:31 2015 UTC,"Even if you don't put much (or any) weight on the cane, it is still a third point of contact with the ground and therefore offers you stability and balance that you would otherwise be using muscles for. I have a lot of hip/leg problems too and my wrists are pretty sensitive to pressure. I was pleasantly surprised to find how much a cane helped, just by helping my balance. I didn't realize how much fatigue and pain was caused by just balancing on two legs, so the cane is a huge help. I was talking to my physio about it and she confirmed that the third point of contact with the ground indeed does take a lot of stress off our bodies, purely because it no longer has to work so hard to hold us upright and steady.   It's also really good for things like waiting in line, where you have to stand up without having anything to lean against. The cane gives you something to lean on so you can take some weight off, and if you lean on it with both hands it's half as hard on your wrists.   If you find yourself always looking for something to lean on, you'd probably benefit a lot from this.   Amazon has some cool canes that don't cost much. I have a folding one which I love because it's really light and folds up easily to fit in my bag, so I can just have it on me and get it out when I need it."
Fibromyalgia,349wic,koiotchka,1 point,Sun May 3 03:19:26 2015 UTC,"I am five feet tall, been using a four foot tall walking stick for a few years now, starting in my late twenties.  It hurts me a lot less to have the option to grasp the stick at varying heights.  Using a cane with just a palm rest sort of thing does hurt after a while, and I feel puts more strain on my wrists and shoulders.  With the tall walking stick, I can grasp it anywhere from the middle to the top, I can use it straight upright or I can lean it out to the side, or add a second tall stick and walk with four points instead of three (although if I'm doing that poorly I'm probably in my wheelchair).  I can rest my chin on it when I'm standing still.  I have also used it to point at things, direct my dogs, fend off strange dogs, and to raise high over my head so people can find me from a distance :p  The walking stick has given me much more independence and a lot more confidence when walking, especially up and down curbs and on rough terrain.  Some days I don't think I need it, but I always carry it because I never know when a flare will hit.  It's distinctive, and sometimes people ask me if I'm a wizard.  Sometimes people recognize it as a walking aid, sometimes they think I'm just trying to look cool.  But I've been dealing with ""you don't look sick"" and ""you're too young to have pain"" since I was 6, so I'm used to that part. I see a lot of older people walking very short steps, very unsure of themselves -- obviously in pain or limited mobility.  And I always want to give them a hug and suggest they get a cane, because it really does help.  There's no reason to be hesitant to walk around.  Get a stick.  It will help :)  And if it doesn't, you can always stop using it!"

It's strange, when I was in a wheelchair, I didn't get sour looks or negative stigma, if anything, people where obnoxiously accommodating, but give a 30 year old a cane, and suddenly the world is CRAZY!"

Conversely, I do not take it with me on job interviews. I'm job hunting for the first time since I started walking with a cane about 50% of the time and I'm tremendously insecure about walking in as a 30-something with a cane.

It got worse when I needed to use those rascal scooters to go shopping with my wife, oh man the people who thought I was using it because I was lazy...

Fibromyalgia,347yrd,Terroriffica,7,Wed Apr 29 00:46:14 2015 UTC,"He needs to want to help himself first.  Since he's depressed, it might be difficult to get him motivated.  Is he seeing someone about his depression?  That might be the best place to start.  Is he taking medication for fibromyalgia?  For lots of people with FMS, they'd probably be totally non-functional without some kind of medication.    Exercise really is one of the best treatments for fibromyalgia.  It'll help with his depression, too.  Do you think you could get him to do some yoga?  He wouldn't have to leave the house if he followed a video on YouTube or bought a DVD, and he could do it for 2-3 minutes at a time until he could go for longer periods of time.  As far as diet goes, you'll see lots of people suggesting all sorts of things.  Some people swear by the keto diet.  Some people say the FODMAP diet has helped them.  Personally, I always feel terrible when I visit my in-laws because the food they have on hand is so...unhealthy.  It's basically meat, cheese, and starch - pizza, fried chicken, Mexican with just meat, cheese, and tortilla, etc.  Most of them stick their noses up at anything green.  They call my SIL a ""health nut"" because she serves her kids vegetables.  I could go on, but the point is eating nothing but junk food is bad for anyone whether you have a chronic condition or not.  It also makes me feel worse.  Would your brother be willing to eat healthier things if he didn't have to cook them himself?    Lastly, have you thought about showing him some of the inspirational stories you've seen here?  Maybe knowing it's possible to still do x, y, and z will motivate him."
Fibromyalgia,347yrd,KittyL0ver,5,Wed Apr 29 02:02:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's so much a case of ""letting"" fibro consume him, any more than it would be a case of ""letting"" cancer consume him. Fibro and depression often go hand in hand, and it's really not about whether or not you're sort of ""giving in"" to these diseases as much as they're just steamrolling you.   I understand you want to help your brother feel better, and that's a good and commendable thing. I think, first, you might need to shift your perspective a little. I sometimes am in the same place as your brother is now, and it's like looking up from the bottom of a deep pit with steep sides. It doesn't feel like it's worth fighting, in those moments. And sometimes those moments become those months. Or years. That's the depression part talking. If I weren't depressed I could probably push through a certain amount of pain and fatigue, but when I'm confronted with pain, fatigue, and depression, I shut down. You say he only leaves the house for doctor visits. Does he have a psych doc, or a therapist? Because it sounds like he could use one - or a new treatment, because it's plain that whatever he is trying now, be that a medication or a certain attitude, it's not working. His depression seems like the primary problem right now. You need to realize that trying to help a depressed person without professional help is kinda like trying to move a giant boulder on your own. The boulder is stubborn and crafty and has gravity on its side. So I think what you need to do is sit him down and have a heart to heart. Maybe even include the rest of your family (talk to them beforehand). Try to tell him that you love him and you're sad to see him so miserable. Tell him you want to help, but you don't know how best to do that. Try to tell him, gently, that you think he needs (better/different?) treatment for his depression, and that you want to be able to provide support for him during that treatment. Ask him if there's anything he'd feel comfortable talking to you about that he wants to say.   Another thing you might have to realize is that you may not get your brother back as you once knew him. Having chronic illnesses, physical or mental, changes you. Sometimes a little, sometimes a lot. Treatment is possible for depression, though, and a good attitude will help him so much in combating the pain and fatigue he feels, along with his other symptoms, from the fibro. But he still may not be able to do a lot of things, he may not have as much energy as he once did, his pain may prevent him from being as active as you would like to see him, etc. Keep your expectations low, but if you can get him to make a renewed effort toward getting himself feeling better, watch for backsliding. It happens. When it does, just remind him you are there for him. Support him any way you can. A few days of feeling sorry for yourself is alright, healthy even, but when it turns into weeks and months and years of feeling hopeless, that's when you need professional assistance.   As for his diet, that may change if the depression lifts. I know when I am depressed, all I want is comforting aka junk food. It's just a symptom of a larger problem, I think.   Also, try not to expect him to push through what he's experiencing solely because other people can push through what they are experiencing. It can get extremely overwhelming to face up to these challenges. I know for me, sometimes it feels like I'm completely walled in on all sides and there is just no fighting it. Or if I fight it, I'll be in worse pain and worse fatigue later. And who wants to feel worse for their efforts? Anyway... I hope some of this is helpful. It is possible for him to feel somewhat better, but you'll have to be patient because it's going to be a long, hard road. Good luck to you and your brother. :)"
Fibromyalgia,347yrd,Veridical_Cupcakes,2,Wed Apr 29 10:52:59 2015 UTC,"Sean,  I can very much relate to what you're going through - it's incredibly painful to see someone you care about slide so deeply into depression that they just give up.  Fibro is one of the cruelest illnesses I've ever seen in that it engenders so much inward pain with no outward physical manifestations to the point that to the outside world it can be difficult to understand what's wrong - and to those who love and care for someone who's suffering from it, it can be a constant struggle to remind yourself that person is suffering.  If you depend on that person it's even harder - eventually their pain will be your pain, and at that point everyone loses.  Regardless, it's going to hurt to see someone you care for suffering.  In this case the best advice I can give you is before you attack the problem through research, counseling and the valuable wealth of information and support you'll get here and elsewhere, take care of yourself, even if it means distancing yourself from your brother in some ways for a while.  The pain you feel from watching his suffering will eat away at you, and it will make you less sympathetic and less effective as a family member, caregiver and human being.  For your brother's sake, don't let that happen - make sure that you yourself have your own support system to be able to be there for your family, and the strength they give you will in turn help your brother find his way out of the darkness he's in.  From there you can start to work on researching treatments, diversion therapy, or just plain being there - but not if you're hurting too.  I think I speak for everyone here when I say we're all here for you - you're an admirable and strong young man to care for your family so much to seek out help, and from that I think you'll find the strength you need.  We're pulling for you."
Fibromyalgia,347yrd,VincentKyle,2,Wed Apr 29 12:46:35 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry your family is having a hard time. The thing about Fibro is that it is heavily linked with depression. It becomes a cycle of:  feeling physically terrible-->unable to do basic life things-->feeling emotionally terrible because you think you are somehow useless-->lather, rinse, repeat.  It is a lifelong struggle and prone to major ups and downs. It is extra depressing when you are on a downswing after an upswing. It's like…I was doing great, so what happened?   I think the important thing is to be supportive with your brother and not be an enabler. Gently push him to take small steps, something as simple as going for a walk or reading a new book. Not to encourage him to over-exert himself, but to do something small which serves the purpose of some small pleasure or fulfillment. The more you do for yourself, the more you realize you are deserving of value. I am currently depressed and need to remind myself of this constantly, with varying degrees of success.  As for diet, it's hard for someone to turn down food that's in front of them. You could be a little sneaky just by bringing him a glass of water or by making a healthy dish for yourself and making him a plate as well. It's impossible to change someone's habits for them, but at least you can improve his access and make it incredibly easy to eat better. I am a food person so my diet is very healthy, but I do this with my best friend all the time by simply giving her bigger portions of veggies that I know she won't notice.   I wish you luck and just know that by being an empathetic brother you are already giving a gift which not everyone can have."
Fibromyalgia,347yrd,KobenstyleMama,0,Mon May 4 18:56:19 2015 UTC,"I think I understand how he feels.  Maybe you could try a different strategy.  Instead of trying to get him to do something awful like going outside, try to do things with him that he wants to do.  If that is sit around watching TV, talking very little, then that is okay.  The fact is, at the moment he is facing a life of doing not very much.  Reassure him that it is okay to be like that.  Junk food?  Meh, who cares?  Diet makes a big difference to some people with fibro but no difference whatsoever to others.  Your brother probably doesn't care about dying of a heart attack in his sixties.  Try to accept your brother as he is, with the fibro, depression and anything else he might have.  Let him know that you will support him no matter what.  The best thing you can do right now is go and see a neurologist about your chronic daily migraines.  There are drugs that help reduce the frequency of migraines.  If the drugs don't work there is botox.  Not only would you be helping yourself, you will be showing your brother that persisting with seeking treatment pays dividends.  Your brother is the way he is now because of brain chemistry.  I don't see a way to help him without medication.  I recommend Tramadol, because it is probably the only thing strong enough to pull your brother out of the place that he is in right now.  Sure, there is the risk of dependence, but you have to weigh that up against the risk of suicide.  Tramadol doesn't work for everyone, but personally, it makes me feel happy, it significantly reduces my pain and it makes me less foggy.  If it worked for your brother then it might get him interested in other, not so easy strategies that might help, eg going outside or eating healthily."

I don't think that 2 days is enough time to know if it's going to work for you. For me, and I've read similar stories, the first week on Cymbalta was pretty bad but around a month in, I started feeling soooo much better. Like, I don't think I could ever live without Cymbalta now.   That said, I've taken both amitriptyline and cyclobenzaprine in the past as well. I was only on amitriptyline for a short time (I think a week) as it was extremely sedating to me. I did not have any weight gain during this time. I was on cyclobenzaprine off and on for maybe a year or more. No abnormal weight gain (or loss) with this either. It mostly helped with sleep and tight muscles (as it IS a muscle relaxer). I'd say it was probably the best muscle relaxer I've taken out of three but never did much for the fibro."
Fibromyalgia,347rgq,castikat,2,Wed Apr 29 08:50:39 2015 UTC,"With the cymbalta I lost control of my bowels on the first day and the second day ended up in the ER with what they thought were gallstones (based on where my pain was) but ended up being high liver enzyme secretion. There are two different types of enzymes apparently, and my high count was specifically the one that is caused by a reaction to cymbalta. They said that less than 1% of the people who have taken cymbalta have had that side effect, so they weren't sure if that was from the medication or because I drank the night before I started taking it. I stopped taking the cymbalta and went to an internist a few days later and he did new labs, which showed that my liver enzyme secretion was still high. If it was actually from alcohol, that number should have gone done by then. After a few days, the pain went away and we never figured it out.  I enjoyed taking the cymbalta and know that it is more common for weight loss rather than weight gain and really wish they would put me back on it."

As for me, with any medicine I've taken- it's a lot of watching what you eat, how much, and exercise. I've had some medicines that have made me feel ravenously hungry. I try to eat a little bit to curb that feeling and then eat more later so I'm not just scarfing down food to feed that feeling. With fibromyalgia, I did gain weight at first when I wasn't diagnosed and became pretty sedentary. (15 lbs gained, but still at a healthy weight, and have maintained it for almost two years). After going through pain management I have realized for me, I can work out small amounts (a walk or yoga, also small physical therapy type things to gain strength again). However, if it's a day where I'm not going to be moving much, my body doesn't need as many calories, so I try to watch intake."

I am on a medical diet due to extreme fructose intolerance, and do not eat almost anything with fructose/table sugar lest I pay for it for days of agony.    That said, I have not gained any significant weight while on this medication.  I have gained a few pounds of muscle due to picking up weight lifting to address a different health issue.  The med has also not increased my appetite in any noticeable way.  I think that if you want to try it, you should allow yourself to.

I can only speak to my own experience, but pregnancy lessened the pain considerably.  I did have some weird symptoms pop up, too.  For example, it isn't unusual for my hands, arms, and legs to fall asleep.  That happened a little bit while pregnant, but there were times when my abdomen fell asleep, too.

Fibromyalgia,3449eg,IndigoBluue,2,Tue Apr 28 04:24:47 2015 UTC,"How exactly is he trapping you? Like do both his arms go around you so you can't move? I'm just trying to get a good picture so I can help more with logistics. It may be that you can't spoon closely all night. Or what I used to do, when my one shoulder started to hurt, I'd flip over so I was facing into his chest for a while until that shoulder started to hurt, then rinse and repeat. You may find pillows to be helpful too. Keep a couple around that you could use to prop under your shoulder? Or maybe when falling asleep, but a thin one between you and him so he can't trap you? I'm just spitballing ideas here, because painful sleep is just the worst!"
Fibromyalgia,3449eg,manipulationcreation,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:30:01 2015 UTC,"Those are some really good ideas, especially the part about the pillow. Thank you! To be more specific about my problem, yes, usually his left forearm sits with his elbow on my hipbone and his hand at my shoulder (so it wraps around my entire torso) and our legs are completely intertwined, with one of his on top. The end result is that it can be very difficult for me to flip over, and my right shoulder suffers."
Fibromyalgia,3449eg,whenifeellikeit,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:39:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe ease your legs out of the ""trap"" after a few minutes of cuddling so that you are free from the entanglement.  Then relax in that position for a few minutes, and then quietly ask him to turn over so that you can be the big spoon while you fall asleep."
Fibromyalgia,3449eg,zebra-stampede,2,Tue Apr 28 08:11:35 2015 UTC,"Oh god my ex was so awful about this haha. I would always wake up with either my hip or shoulder in terrible pain and have to excavate myself. He's generally pretty good about moving in his sleep though.   That said, how big is the bed? except for extracting yourself is there room for you to not be touching him? I know cuddling is nice but maybe take a break for a few days? Have you ever heard of a side sleeper pillow? Something like this: http://sleepdisorders.dolyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Side-Sleeper-Pro-Pillow-Review-Image-3.jpg  Maybe you could sleep with that and he could still be the big spoon around you, but the curve of the pillow behind you might prevent him from crushing up on you"
Fibromyalgia,3449eg,irishgrrl,2,Tue Apr 28 04:34:28 2015 UTC,"We're in a queen bed, so there is room to space out, it just never turns out that way... Something I both love and dread. That sleeper pillow looks amazing, thank you!"
Fibromyalgia,3449eg,whenifeellikeit,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:42:53 2015 UTC,"I spend the weekends with my boyfriend, and I totally get what you're saying. I'm 5'9, he's 6'4 and a good big stronger than I am. We usually end up spooning the same way, and then I get super warm and he'll move away, but as someone else said, in a queen size bed, there isn't much room.   I've managed some silent cues I can hit him with in his sleep that actually help both of us. He snores, so sometimes I'll wake up from shoulder pain, hear him, and sort of give him a specific kind of shove, that he takes as ""oh, I need to roll over"". That's the only time I touch him that way.   Try playing the big spoon every now and then, or maybe try using a bodypillow to see if that helps. I like being the big spoon, and I know it sounds silly, but I pretend I'm a jetpack, lol.  Hope you guys find something that works for you soon."
Fibromyalgia,3449eg,irishgrrl,3,Tue Apr 28 07:10:49 2015 UTC,"If your SO is fast asleep and snoring and you need him to turn over, nothing works better than the pillow-lift.  Instead of waking him and asking him to roll over, just take both corners of the close side of the pillow in both hands, and slowly lift it.  Create a gentle, slow incline.  Keep it steady.  Raising the side of the pillow that he's facing will inevitably cause him to get uncomfortable and roll over on his own."
Fibromyalgia,3449eg,whenifeellikeit,1 point,Tue Apr 28 08:14:06 2015 UTC,I'll have to give that a shot. Thanks for the idea!
Fibromyalgia,3449eg,whenifeellikeit,1 point,Tue Apr 28 09:39:29 2015 UTC,"Mainly you'll need to communicate. That's what has created a good dynamic with me and my SO.  Just let him know that you can only stay in certain positions for ""so long"" until you get uncomfortable and need to switch.  Let him know you may need to reposition his body parts when he spoons you.  Let him know that you might  need to shift a bit away from him and put a pillow between your bodies after the initial cuddle-fest in order to get comfortable enough to sleep.  Let him know that it's not a slight against him or your intimacy, but just a matter of physical comfort for you.    I've found that if I just communicate my physical limitations and needs with my partner in a way that doesn't really make them a big deal, he's more able to adjust to having a partner with FM."
Fibromyalgia,3449eg,Jawzper,1 point,Tue Apr 28 09:43:07 2015 UTC,"I always hug a pillow to ease the pain in my shoulders.  When my SO is the Big Spoon, he will drape his arm over me, and his arm often comes to rest on the tender point on my hip bone, so I just gently reposition his arm to the dip in my waist, and stretch his forearm out in front of me.  He knows I have a painful spot on my  hip, so he's very accommodating about this.  It's part of the ""getting comfy"" process when we go to sleep at night.  He drapes his arm, and then I reposition it where it's more comfortable for me.  My right shoulder always gets painful if I lay on that side for too long, so after a little while of being the Little Spoon, I nudge him and tell him to roll over, and then I'm the Big Spoon for the rest of the night."
Fibromyalgia,3449eg,dontdothatfool,1 point,Tue Apr 28 08:10:05 2015 UTC,"this might not work out as well for the female anatomy, but personally i've found the most comfortable way to sleep in the same bed as somebody else is back-to-back, with my arms crossed and resting on opposite shoulders (like a mummy, except sideways and sort of in a fetal position). this way you're still in contact with each other and keeping each other cozy, but you both very much have your own personal space.  the downside is that it's not as intimate, but if you've explained that you need to make comfort a priority when trying to sleep they'll understand."
Fibromyalgia,3449eg,vibes86,1 point,Tue Apr 28 11:16:42 2015 UTC,My partner falls asleep in like 3 min and I am awake for forever every night so I just snuggle up with him until he falls asleep and then when I am done snuggling I Unsnuggle myself and get in my normal comfortable sleeping position.
Fibromyalgia,3449eg,PeacefulTreeLand,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:21:54 2015 UTC,"There is little to no spooning in my bedroom. It took awhile to get used to, but we will cuddle sometimes where I am the big spoon or where he lays on his back and I snuggle from the side. That gives me a chance to get out when I get uncomfortable. Put a pillow in the middle of the bed so maybe he snuggles with that instead?"
Fibromyalgia,343dot,Laur-Ent,2,Tue Apr 28 00:01:03 2015 UTC,"I don't have solutions, but wanted to say that I hear you on this!"
Fibromyalgia,343dot,kwxt,2,Tue Apr 28 00:42:37 2015 UTC,"If you want pharma solutions... Voltaren Gel, Pennsaid Solution, Muscle relaxers? Zanaflex, Methocarbamol have worked for me. Lidocaine gel/patches (to make it hurt less maybe), compounding creme your rheumy can call into a pharmacy, different NSAIDs and other topical agents (there's a compounding pharmacy in Pensacola I think we use). Look around on wikipedia, there's some NSAIDs I can't remember the name of. I was on etodolac for a while. I think celebrex is one of the brand names used a lot.   I keep ice packs on me and rice bags to heat up in the microwave. I second the physio therapy suggestions. I haven't done it myself but I keep hearing about the benefits, even if it has to take some time and pain to make it happen.   I think that's all I've been on for muscle stuff. I don't know if Gabapentin would help. I hope you find something that works :/"
Fibromyalgia,343dot,zebra-stampede,2,Tue Apr 28 01:02:18 2015 UTC,"For me, getting a massage every 2-4 weeks makes a difference. Needs to be from a Physiotherapy company or someone that actually specialises in neuromuscual stuff, as the usual ""relaxation"" stuff doesn't quite cut it."
Fibromyalgia,343dot,binkenstein,2,Tue Apr 28 01:49:42 2015 UTC,"My physical therapist used to do something called ""dry needling."" He would basically stick a long needle into a muscle at a spot that's very tight. Not like accupuncture, these needles would go all the way past the dermis and into the muscle itself, and it would cause the muscle to contract and relax, providing some relief. This, in combination with massage and the daily exercises, made a huge difference. And the occasional muscle relaxer."
Fibromyalgia,343dot,TheErrorist,2,Tue Apr 28 03:27:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with finding the right kind of massage. It's been a lifesaver for my shoulders/back/neck. They're pretty angry I haven't gone in 2 months. I was lucky to find someone at my local massage place who's girlfriend has fibro, so he's actually perfect, but you have to find someone who deals with chronic pain disorders.   Voltaren gel is a good one if your insurance covers it, like someone else said, if not, I've had luck with Tiger Balm ointment http://www.amazon.com/Tiger-Balm-Relieving-Ointment-Non-Staining/dp/B001ECQ5VG or the patches listed.   Daily stretches are really the best once you've gotten the tension down a bit. These are the ones PT taught me: https://www.pinterest.com/pin/79727855879689617/  Good luck! Even with all of that I have two spots I am always tight in :( I have an rx for muscle relaxers but try to use them sparingly."
Fibromyalgia,343dot,lbsmith5,2,Tue Apr 28 04:27:46 2015 UTC,"I do a combination of things to reduce muscle tension.  The ones that make the biggest difference are:    baclofen (a muscle relaxant, side effect of drowsiness) 15 minutes in a spa per week (the combination of heat + massage over a wide area seems to work really well).   The other things that help are:    a deep tissue massage about once per month,  physio on problem areas about once per month. heat packs at home on problem areas using a foam roller every day using an electric massager that plugs into AC power every few days yoga for stress relief about once per week (focuses on stretching back and neck) stretching back and neck at every opportunity, eg while waiting at traffic lights pressing firmly on the most painful point of a muscle, then holding for about 20 seconds until the pain decreases (it starves the muscle of oxygen, forcing it to relax)   It sounds like a full time job when listed like that ;)  As /u/TheErrorist said, dry needling is a good way to relax a particular muscle.  Sometimes my physio uses that technique.  In general, anything that presses on muscles will help relax it, but it will be quite painful.  Stabbing the muscle with a needle forces it to relax with minimal pain.  Applying heat is a less painful way to relax the muscles.  Drugs can be quite powerful but there is a trade off with side effects.  There is a pain cycle related to muscle tension.  Increased tension reduces blood flow to the muscle, which increases pain.  The body's response to the pain is to increase tension even further.  Pain killers and desensitization through massage help reduce the pain part of the cycle.  Heat, massage, needles, and muscle relaxants reduce the tension side of the cycle.  Exercise increases blood flow to the muscle which reduces the impact of tension on the cycle (not mentioned above because I haven't noticed a direct impact on muscle tension).  Sometimes tension is in response to a problem with a joint, which is why it is important to get the help of a physiotherapist.  My fibro seems to continuously push me into the tension/pain cycle.  A completely relaxed muscle seems to tighten up again within a week :(  Most of my fibro treatment time is spent relaxing muscles. It is an ongoing battle against tension.  On the bright side, my back and neck are now very flexible :)  I don't need massages as often as I did at the same time last year.  I wouldn't say that I am winning the battle, but I think I would be much worse off if I didn't do so much to treat muscle tension."
Fibromyalgia,343dot,FibroMan,2,Tue Apr 28 04:41:55 2015 UTC,"My doctor put me on Baclofen for muscle spasms and tension. He understood my concerns about addictions and my understanding is that it's something where addiction to it is near non-existant and it does wonders for me. There's always things like Robax as an OTC drug which I believe is in the same class structure as Baclofen, don't quote me on that though. You can always discuss with a doctor and let them know your concerns so they can work with you.    Other than that, I take soaks in a hot bath of epsom salt. It's supposed to help relax muscles and ease pain and stiffness. Hasn't let me down yet, I'm always like jelly when I come out of the bath.    Magnesium supplements might help as well. You can pick tablets up at any drug or health store. Make sure to discuss that with your doctor first before starting though!"
Fibromyalgia,343dot,Jennicide,2,Tue Apr 28 05:44:27 2015 UTC,I use Voltaren gel(rx only) and I use a tennis ball to roll some tension out. I'm also on a muscle relaxer that helps too!
Fibromyalgia,343dot,kvoll,2,Tue Apr 28 09:40:24 2015 UTC,"Your tight muscles may be compensating for weaker muscles that aren't able to contract properly. Seemed to be the case with me. See if you can find a physical therapist who practices something called Muscle Activation Technique. This really helped me and has had a moderate permanent benefit even a year after finishing PT, despite that I haven't been good (at all) about keeping up with home exercises.  It's also kind of fun because you will know immediately if it's working: My main problem was scapular pain, and basically, my PT would put my arm in a certain position and apply force in a particular direction--this isolated a single muscle at a time--while I attempted to resist letting my arm get pushed in that direction. My muscle would be dumb and I'd be unable to resist any force. Then he would massage the origin and insertion of that muscle (something to do with stimulating the Golgi tendon reflex, I think?), and repeat the test. Like magic, I'd suddenly be able to resist the force he applied. Repeat for all sorts of different arm positions & force directions, representing different muscles and activation patterns. (The challenge was then keeping the new pattern established through home exercises.)  I ended up plateauing with this approach after maybe 15 sessions, and I do still have scapular pain, but it quickly got me out of a bad time where I was leaving work at 8/10 or 9/10 pain levels."

Fibromyalgia,343dot,Decepticle_Ronnie,2,Tue Apr 28 12:18:07 2015 UTC,"Routine stretching helps me. I was taught ways to stretch the most common muscle groups by both a physio and a massage therapist. When I can feel it's getting bad, 30 minutes of stretching makes a world of difference. The relief afterwards is fantastic. Chat with a physio about which muscles are giving you the most problems and have them teach you stretching exercises to work them. Like you, my back and shoulders are the areas I work most and it can relieve tension headaches pretty easily."
Fibromyalgia,343dot,peanutgallerie,2,Tue Apr 28 12:50:23 2015 UTC,"I think everyone covered most everything you can do. This is a symptom of fibro but please understand you can really change how tight your muscles are by doing things to help yourself.   Do strength training. This is so important. Weak muscles get tense compensating for all the other weak muscles. Do what you can, it may be more than what you think.  Massage. Find someone familiar with fibro. muscle relaxers. Not sure if you are open to this. Cannabis. If its legal in your area. It works. Foam rolling. I find it painful, but it does help. Yoga. Works and stretches your body. Stretching. Good but best to do with strength training.  Meditation. Relax your mind and body."
Fibromyalgia,343dot,raven4277,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:07:50 2015 UTC,"I've got the same problems, and there's no real cure, just little things you can do to lessen the stiffness. I would recommend heating pads, hot baths, and gentle stretching exercises. Honestly, stretching daily helps the most. I bought a book off amazon of suggested gentle stretches, and a lot of them are very doable even if you're not flexible in the least. It'll hurt in the short term but the longer I do it, the better I feel. You might try swimming or water aerobics as well. Good luck, as I said I've had the same problem for going on 20 years now. I hope something I've suggested above works for you, you never know til you try."
Fibromyalgia,343dot,KittyL0ver,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:44:42 2015 UTC,"What kind of massage were you getting and at what pressure were they using?  I have had similar problems in the same areas.  I couldn't turn my head when driving to see of someone was in my blind spot.  At one point they got so stiff that I couldn't life my arms to dress myself.  It was embarrassing to say the least.  I started going to physical therapy twice a week for about 6 weeks.  In the beginning it did hurt much more than it seemed to be helping.  I would be on the verge of tears the day after each session.  However, by the end I was able to dress myself again and turn my head to see over my shoulder.  It had helped significantly with increasing my range of motion.    I kept doing the exercises I learned in PT.  Eventually I was able to join a Gentle Yoga class.  That further helped my flexibility, so I moved up to a regular level 1 class.  At that point I made an effort to do some form of low impact exercise several times a week, usually walking, swimming, or yoga.    Unfortunately, I was still getting flare ups all the time.  I noticed the pain was always at its worst when my muscles were the tightest.  I take Flexeril, a muscle relaxant, for breakthrough pain.  It would help a little, not a whole lot.  Since I was still dealing with an unacceptable level of pain, I finally decided to give massage a try.  I have found it really depends on who gives you the massage, what kind they use on you, and at what pressure.  For me, the best thing to do is not to mention having FMS.  I just say that my neck and shoulders hurt and that I want the pressure to be firm.  The next day I'm almost always in pain.  I just plan to do nothing that day.  However, the following 2-3 weeks I see a significant reduction in tightness and therefore pain.  Due to financial constraints, I am only going about every 6-8 weeks.  Ideally, I'd go once a month.  After 3 or 4 sessions I noticed a dramatic decrease in headaches.    It took years to really see a big difference in tightness.  My muscles are still abnormally taught.  I'm not sure they'll ever be like a normal person's.  By keeping up with my PT exercises every morning, getting some kind of regular exercise, getting massages regularly, and of course medication, it's become manageable."

Fibromyalgia,341hly,spacehockey,3,Mon Apr 27 15:49:48 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing the medication is Tramadol. There really is no risk as long as she takes the prescribed dosage, and the risk itself is very, very small. She should go back to her doctor and discuss some different medications. Lyrica, Savella, Cymbalta, Gabapentin all are used for fibro. Generally the side effects only last for a couple weeks and then fade out as your body gets used to the drug. Really, if she's in that much pain she should give the medication a try. I currently take tramadol and gabapentin, and both work really well. I have taken Savella in the past as well, and it did help, but the efficacy seemed to decline after the first six months. I also take cyclobenzaprine, a muscle relaxer, at night to help with sleep. She should be researching this stuff and advocating for herself at the doctor.   Tell her to keep moving. It may sound contrary, but regular movement and light exercise is the most effective way to battle fibro. She should start going on walks, and maybe follow it up with a nice hot bath."
Fibromyalgia,341hly,TheErrorist,3,Mon Apr 27 18:43:05 2015 UTC,"I recommend Lyrica (pregabalin) as a starting medication.  There is approx 50% chance of Lyrica reducing pain, 50% chance of side effects, but you should know if it is making a difference within a week or two.  A lot of drugs have scary side effects.  Generally the side effects are rare.  Everyone responds differently to drugs for fibro.  You don't want to avoid taking a drug that could help you, just because it causes a seizure for someone else.  Massaging tender points helps.  I use an electric massager that plugs into A/C.  I also use heat packs and a foam roller.  It sounds like the vitamin D is making a difference, which is great, so stay on that.  It is probably more important to reduce pain levels at night than during the day, because you don't sleep well while in pain.  The main side effect of a lot of pain killers is drowsiness, so if you take some before you go to bed it can significantly reduce your chances of sleeping in until 4pm ;)"

They're right that the side effects can be bad, but the really bad side effects are extremely rare. Most likely she'd just feel a little loopy here and there until she adjusts to the medicine. But if her fog is as bad as it seems to you, then she couldn't be much worse off from the medication. I was not a fan of the idea of taking all these pills, but it's improved my quality of life by a large margin. Completely and totally worth it. Also a quick fix to reduce pain levels is to pick up a tens unit. I bought a cheap one at Wal-Mart for about $40. You won't see any long term improvements from it, but it's great for centering in on that one part that is really hurting at the time and providing some relief."

Fibromyalgia,34163c,lbsmith5,2,Mon Apr 27 17:06:44 2015 UTC,"I noticed it primarily when I tried the keto diet. It's the high fat, moderate protein, low sugar diet and for the week I was on it, I felt the best I have ever felt since the fibro hit me. My pains basically diminished.   The problem was I lost 7lbs in 7 days and I'm already skinny :(  So if you have extra weight to lose and no other underlying health issues (cholesterol, heart problems, BP etc), I would recommend the ketogenic diet. Just do your research on it and consult your doc as well.   My body in general (pain and tummy problems) do better when I limit sugary stuff. It's hard though with my sweet tooth."
Fibromyalgia,34163c,shinymetalass,2,Mon Apr 27 17:14:24 2015 UTC,"interesting to hear. in general, the way to avoid losing weight when adjusting your diet like that is to snack in between meals. this way your body doesn't spend too much time in the post-digestive ""using stored energy"" phase, where the body begins burning fat and the like to keep you going. carry a bag of mixed fruit and nuts around if you have to :)"

Fibromyalgia,340422,KittyL0ver,5,Mon Apr 27 06:10:08 2015 UTC,"This doesn't directly apply to FMS, but I still found it relevant in a round about way.  We all know exercise is good for people with FMS.     The sweet spot for exercise benefits, however, came among those who tripled the recommended level of exercise, working out moderately, mostly by walking, for 450 minutes per week, or a little more than an hour per day. Those people were 39 percent less likely to die prematurely than people who never exercised.   Even though some of us might not be able to engage in vigorous exercise, I would hope most of us would be able to go for a walk.  Even walking for short periods of time is better than nothing at all. If you keep at it, you can work your way up from walking for 10 minutes per day to 20 minutes per day and so on."

From your flair it looks like you have some other health issues that again, the majority of people with FMS don't have.    Since you can't walk, are you able to do other kinds of exercise like swimming or water aerobics?  Last summer I swam quite a bit, and there were a number of people with RA, who were regulars."

We haven't been able to find anything else besides the fibro for leg pain. I just know there are a lot of people on this sub that have trouble just getting through the day, throwing daily exercise at them is a lot. Lately it's been a lot of exercise and toning down meds around here - which is GREAT, I've lowered my dosages as well - but I think everyone is on their own personal journey and we can't generalize ""I would hope most of us would be able to go on a walk."" I'm not offended or anything, I'm at a healthy weight, but if someone's been spending days and days in bed, they're going to feel pretty shitty. I think anyone with fibro has those times when they can't.  I have issues with water (which is too bad, because I live in south Florida, and can use pools pretty year round), but when I'm not shaky, yoga 1-2 times a week is helpful for me."
Fibromyalgia,3403nl,Twitchythrowaway,2,Mon Apr 27 06:05:21 2015 UTC,"In theory, simple words could be stored in a different part of the brain to complex words.  The gabapentin and/or your fibro fog might be affecting the simple words part of your brain more than the complex words part.  You would expect it to be the other way around, but the brain isn't always logical ;)  I agree that over your brain has found a solution to the simple word problem.  Normally the solution would be to get better at remembering simple words, but using more complex words works too.  I have had a chronic daily headache for almost 5 years.  At first, I muddled words quite often, but over time that improved, even though my headache had been the same.  Then I got fibro and started muddling words again :("

When I straighten my legs the muscles feel sore ofcouse but I have always had that, the pins and needle feeling is more recent (about a year ago) and the shocking is really recent."
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,Pecan_Sandies_,8,Sun Apr 26 09:54:53 2015 UTC,"I was diagnosed with fibro when I was 16, after at least a year of not knowing why I was in pain all the time and it gradually getting worse. I'm 23 now, so I have a couple of years' experience with this awfulness. I can only tell you what helped or would have helped me, but that advice I am happy to give. Keep in mind I don't have any experience with lupus, just fibro, chronic fatigue, and various mental issues.  My school system doubted me, too. I was a sickly kid, past second grade when I got mono and was out of school for half the year with it. Ever since then I haven't been right. It got to the point where, even with doctor's notes, the school was saying ""show up or get out"" to me. So we homeschooled. While it was good to not have to deal with the stress of being told I was a liar (my family has always been very supportive), I fell into a deep depression partly because I was lonely. I didn't have the energy to see friends, even had I still had any I was close to. I talked to a lot of people online - some of whom I am still very close with to this day. But there's something soul-nourishing in SEEING a friend, even for shy introverts like me. Encourage her to see her friends in whatever capacity is most comfortable for her. I know it's hard when you are in agony. If she's got a good friend or several who care for her, though, maybe have them come over and hang out with her - watch netflix or whatever. Maybe offer to drive them, if they need a ride. I still do not have my driver's license (I'm afraid I won't be able to pay attention to the road well enough, when the brain fog sets in. I am trying to get through that and learn to drive, even if I only use that skill in emergencies I should have it and my license...) so I am reliant on other people if I want to see a friend. Either they have to come get me and drop me back off, or someone has to drop me off and then pick me back up. It's an inconvenience and I don't get to see my friends very often. Online communication is great, but I wish I could see them more.   This is more advice for the future, when she has found some solutions for her pain... But as she is still young, she won't have all the adult independence skills yet... Help her acquire those, gently. Make sure she knows how to do her own clothes and how to cook (easy things that don't require tons of time in the kitchen - unless she loves to cook and can power through some of the pain to enjoy the time spent there), how to drive (when and if possible), cleaning the house (go REAL slow with this one), teach her about finances... The point of that being that her diseases should not strip her of her identity as a person capable of doing things for herself. Take caution with this, though. Teach her slowly. Help her when she is flagging. And don't insist that she take care of everything all the time, because this will sap her strength and leave nothing for her to feel human with. If you can, doing her laundry for her, cooking her meals (there is nothing so comforting as having your parent cook for you, even when you're an adult), cleaning, etc, that will help her a lot. It's more work for you, yes (probably not more than you're used to since she's still a young teenager), but for her doing those things almost certainly takes so much more energy, and she is at a time in her life where she needs to develop who she is, and not get lost in daily tasks like laundry. I feel like I'm not explaining this section very well and I may be babbling a bit, so please forgive me as I try to explain what I mean here. While these daily tasks can sap her strength, she'll be grateful for the skills (if not now, one day). Sometimes you NEED to do something to take care of your surroundings in order to feel better, even if it hurts. It's empowering to have the skills to do things on your own, even if you need help 8 times out of 10. Don't let her be wholly dependent on other people and neglect her skills going into adulthood. I may not always have the spoons (have you heard of spoons yet? You may be too new to all this to have heard of it yet - it's this metaphor a lot of chronic illness people use to describe how much energy they have and how many tasks they can do in a day. Here is the link to the essay it came from.) to make homemade mac and cheese or fresh bread, but I love to cook and I love knowing that I CAN. I may let my laundry pile up because I don't have the spoons for it, but I know how to take care of my clothes. Knowing that I CAN, even when I can't... That makes me feel a bit more whole.   Speaking of skills, what are her hobbies and interests? Personally I love to craft. I make anything I can get my hands on. My latest obsession is knitting. If there are things she loves she can still do, even just from time to time, make sure she does them. My hobbies are what make me feel most human. They help lift me out of depression and keep me from being depressed. It's a good coping skill to work on a project or create art. I know all about the bad coping skills. I'm finally developing some good ones, and I wish I'd had a little more reinforcement when I was younger. And there are a lot of adaptations you can make, for a lot of different things, to help her stay involved in things she loves. For example, if she loves reading, but finds holding a book uncomfortable now, there are audiobooks that she can listen to while in a more comfortable position. Painting can be done a little at a time, depending on what sort of painting you do. Photography is even easier! I'm just using examples from my own life, but you get the idea. Knitting is a great hobby that you can start and stop practically anywhere in the process. But she may be a very different kind of person and think knitting is for old folks ;) Whatever she's interested in, help her do that. :)  Okay, as far as the pain goes... I throw a lot of medicine at mine and nothing works too well, I'm sorry to say. She may be different. I hope she is different. There are things other than medicine that can help, though. Hot and cold packs, special pillows - if you can afford a nice bed, she'll probably end up spending a lot of time there if she is anything like me, and it's worth investing in a very comfortable one. A good night's rest is invaluable and hard to come by for pain patients. Baths may feel nice or they may drain her. You could try aromatherapy - there are a lot of ways to do that, whether it's lotions or a diffuser or what... Peppermint or lemon is nice when you need to feel energized, and there are a lot of soothing scents like lavender that can help calm you. You don't need to get very involved with it to take advantage of its benefits. Some scents MAY help with her nausea, too... Have you tried any mint tea for her nausea? Cool mint tea sometimes soothes my stomach. Anyway, a bottle of essential oil (most of them anyway) costs a few dollars online or at a health store and lasts a really long time. Honestly, that reminds me that I should pick some up for myself... I really tend to neglect my care. Massage sometimes helps and sometimes hurts. It really depends on the type of pain I'm having. If you can afford it, and believe me, I understand if you can't, try taking her for a gentle massage, or even better, get her a massage therapist who has worked with fibro patients. I had one for a while and she was wonderful for me. But you could see how she reacts to massage. Oh, here's a cheap thing that helps me sometimes - icy-hot and its knockoffs. Patches, sticks, creams, whatever. When my muscles and joints are really sore, icy-hot helps... or at least provides a different sensation! Just be careful not to use too much. A little goes a long way, especially for sensitive people like fibromites. I take vitamin b12 for energy. I don't know if it helps yet... it might be helping. Muscle relaxers are good for when I am having a bad stiffness day, but they put me to sleep. Which is sometimes just what I want. You could ask her doctor about flexeril or another muscle relaxer. Generic flexeril is like $10 a bottle - very inexpensive.   That's really all I can think of right now. I wish all the best to you, your daughter, and your family. Gentle hugs to y'all."

Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,FibroMan,3,Mon Apr 27 10:43:03 2015 UTC,"I had mono at 14 and started being tested for lupus at 16. After almost 15 years of testing and being told that I was a headcase, I was just very recently diagnosed with Fibromyalgia at 29 years of age. My doctor swears that the mono was where it all started and it makes a TON of sense as I feel like I just never go better after having it."
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,CritterTeacher,2,Thu Apr 30 04:38:34 2015 UTC,I've notice quite a few people have said they had mono when they were younger. There needs to be more research done on this.
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,CritterTeacher,10,Thu Apr 30 05:51:35 2015 UTC,"There aren't many diseases that fibromites are afraid of, but lupus is one of them :(  The blood test for lupus will probably focus on ""ANA"".  Bear in mind that a negative result doesn't prove beyond all doubt that it isn't lupus.  If your daughter has fibromyalgia and lupus then treatment will focus on lupus.  Fibromyalgia is not life threatening, but lupus is.    Ask your doctor what your pain treatment options are.  Lyrica is the best non-opioid pain killer that I know of, but there was recent research which showed that Lyrica is not effective in adolescents.  I think Tramadol is the best opioid for fibromyalgia, but it doesn't work for everyone and there are risks with dependence, hyperalgesia etc.  If medical marijuana is an option where you live then it is quite likely going to be effective at reducing pain with minimal side effects.  Low vitamin D is probably the least of your worries right now, but it is easily fixed with over the counter vitamin D pills.  Ask your doctor how much your daughter can safely take, because it is often safe to take much more than the daily dose recommended on the pack.  It probably takes a month or two to get vitamin D up to normal levels.  Some people find that vitamin D makes a big difference to their pain levels, others like me find that it makes no difference at all."
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,Beemorriscats,1 point,Sun Apr 26 11:59:15 2015 UTC,"We are waiting for the results on the ANA. We should get all blood results back on Tuesday. The current rheumatologist she is seeing told us to treat her like she has both fibro and lupus. Lyrica is the only medication the doctor would give her. From the research I've done online it has never been tested on adults (something I will bring up at her next appointment.) She is already on weekly does of 10,000 iu of vitamin D.  They are using her age currently as to why they are not giving her any medication for pain."
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,Necnill,5,Sun Apr 26 16:53:31 2015 UTC,"That is a BS reason not to treat pain. I injured my back pretty badly at 14 and was fortunately treated well with a good combo of meds. I was diagnosed with Fibro at 20, but my 15 year old younger brother is going through the same symptoms I have, so he's being investigated to see whats going on, it looks like we both my have a genetic hyper mobility thing instead. They seem to be reluctant to give him the proper pain meds too. When I was a teenager I literally had so many scripts for opioid pain meds that I didn't fill them all because I didn't need to. Now I can't even get what I need to stay a productive member of society ever since they did that reclassification of pain meds. There has to be a middle ground, but we aren't there yet. I am so sorry that your daughter is going through this right now, it is miserable. Let her know that she isn't alone, there's lots of us younger folks with chronic pain conditions out there, and to keep her spirits up, she's not alone."
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,Necnill,4,Mon Apr 27 03:26:43 2015 UTC,I've been told by numerous doctors that they would treat her differently if she was older. It's very frustrating.
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,GetOffMyLawn_,4,Mon Apr 27 03:45:20 2015 UTC,"I think that they worry too much about them getting addicted to pain meds. It's a real concern, but it isn't a reason not to give treatment. Maybe that's just my opinion though. If you have a responsible kid who is clearly presenting with painful symptoms, there is no reason that I can think of not to treat with pain medications. (Even if you have an irresponsible kid, but especially a responsible one. Basically I'm trying to say that it's obvious that the kid isn't faking it to get drugs.)"
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,kennyjarson,3,Mon Apr 27 04:42:00 2015 UTC,"I can understand that. I know at several of the past ER visits we have been to there were several ""drug seekers"" there. I just want her comfortable. But I know they are having to watch the level 3 drugs that are distributed."
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,princessimpy,3,Mon Apr 27 05:05:16 2015 UTC,"I'm 23/F. I have fibro and and underlying connective tissue disorder: lupus was the first suspect for me, too. I had my first flare when I was 11. It's been up and down over the years getting diagnosed. I would ask about muscle relaxers for sure. I'd also look into getting her a nice heating pad. This is the one I have. It's more convenient than getting in a bath every time - I was like her and never wanted to just go soak.  When it comes to telling people (when and if she'd like to), I'd find a nice explain-it-like-I'm-five way to share. I always tell people the official names first, then tell them that the fibro makes my soft tissues all hurt and ache and causes fatigue and makes my head feel fuzzy, like when you have the flu. The connective tissue disorder makes my joints hurt and causes fatigue. Especially with her age, saying that it's like when you have the flu gives her classmates something that they can likely relate to and understand. Obviously with her close friends she can go into it more, but a nice simple version will do well in most situations.  The vitamin D should help some with the exhaustion, once her levels are back up within normal ranges.  I would definitely insist you need something for her for pain. Obviously her pain is out of control right now. She can't function like that. As her mother, make sure you advocate for her and get her something. Even if it's something more minor (like tramadol as opposed to vicodin), you guys should have something on hand for the bad days. You shouldn't have to go to the ER because you have nothing for pain. Obviously, you'll need to keep an eye on it and make sure that she's not over-using it, but it's silly for you guys not to have anything. Gabapentin helped me with fibro pain a lot, moreso than Lyrica or anything else along those lines. I also have Diclofenac for joint pain. I responded to ibuprofen, and the diclofenac works even better for me, but I'm not sure what it will do for her. Ibuprofen only works for joint pain for me from the connective tissue disorder, it doesn't do anything for my fibro pain.  I had a terrible concussion when I was 15 and essentially wasn't able to do school. We arranged that with doctor's orders, I was on home-bound. A teacher came to my house once a week with assignments and helped me with anything I had questions with. They also gave orders that basically eliminated all of the 'busy work' worksheets that I would get. With doctor's orders, they had to comply. I would definitely look into that if she's not able to keep up!  I had a hard time dealing with my diagnosis. A lot of times, people will go through the Five Stages of Grieving when they deal with something traumatic. It's not something that you can really do anything for, I would just both be there if she wants you but also respect that she might want space to deal with it. It took me awhile to mourn the fact that I couldn't be a normal kid. I can do anything that I really want to, but I have to plan around it and plan to rest up and then prepare for the crash afterwards. It can be frustrating but it doesn't prevent you from living your life.  I was seeing a massage therapist for awhile once a week. That both helped with the muscle aching and also got me out of the house, which I needed. She did myofascial release. If you decide to look into it, make sure you go to a massage therapist, not just someone who does massages. They have to be really gentle with fibro patients!  I think the only other thing I have to say: There is no 100% sure test for Lupus. The thing about being so young is that my symptoms weren't really defined enough to have a sure diagnosis. I have a positive ANA, so the other suspect was rheumatoid arthritis. However, my rheumatoid factor is negative, so it's unlikely. I've been seeing a rheumatologist since I was 17 and we still don't have it nailed down what exactly it is. The most likely suspect now is psoriatic arthritis. It can be frustrating, but she will learn to make it work for her.  I'm sorry this turned into a novel! If you have any questions or if she wants to chat with someone, I'm more than willing! You or her can PM me anytime."
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,GetOffMyLawn_,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:04:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I will look into getting her a heating pad. She still prefers quick showers. I think it's because it's difficult to get up and down for her. She doesn't complain. We have a TENS machine. Sometimes it helps, and sometimes she says it makes the pain worse. They are leaning toward lupus due to the butterfly rash on her face (it occurs when she is having a bad day, which is almost daily).  The fibro is the only thing they are willing to treat. Her next appointment for test results is tomorrow."
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,Punica_granatum,3,Mon Apr 27 23:31:34 2015 UTC,"My usual pain management routine is warm baths/hot water bottles, plenty of fluids, ibuprofen and avoiding refined carbohydrates or processed foods.

Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,Punica_granatum,2,Sun Apr 26 10:04:55 2015 UTC,We've tried ibuprofen it didn't seem to help her. I will try getting her to start taking warm baths (she prefers quick showers). But she's getting to the point that her hips and knees feel like they are giving out (her words).
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,k1012,5,Sun Apr 26 11:01:45 2015 UTC,"Bathing suit and a hand in and out might help until she's feeling more up to climbing in and out. I'd also be conscious of her reaction to the warm water, since it has the potential to make her feel breathless.If that's the case, it might not be the best solution."
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,ponyfarmer,2,Sun Apr 26 11:42:25 2015 UTC,Try putting some epsom salts in the bath. Helps with achy muscles. Also magnesium pills can help. Don't megadose because it can cause diarrhea.
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,ponyfarmer,3,Sun Apr 26 14:22:00 2015 UTC,"Have you looked in to the Autoimmune Protocol Diet? You should also consider reading a book called The Terry Wahls Protocol. I have Lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogrens disease. Was diagnosed at 21. I am almost 26 now. Diet and supplementing has forever changed my life. I am currently still on Plaquenil but the side effects are very minimal. I used to be on prednisone and methotrexate as well but was able to successfully get off both of those medications through proper nutrition. I have dealt with everything your daughter is going through... Insomnia, terrible pain, pleurisy, short temper etc. A good functional medicine doctor would also be great to look in to though I cannot afford one because my insurance does not cover it. However, there is more than enough information on the internet to begin the healing process. The Paleo Mom is also a great blog to read. Full of all kinds of scientific information behind why food affects us in such a big way. I'm not in to fad diets and I know Paleo can seem to be just that a lot of the time but it is a lifestyle change and I have seen tremendous success with it."
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,ponyfarmer,1 point,Mon Apr 27 08:46:09 2015 UTC,I haven't looked into that. I definitely will. I'll check into buying the book as well. I've done a lot of internet research. But the people on here have been extremely helpful!
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,ponyfarmer,6,Mon Apr 27 09:32:24 2015 UTC,"My advice is of a bit of a different sort as its not too medical in nature but rather related on how to help her emotionally through this. I was diagnosed at age 15 too. Its an extremely scary and sad time for a teenage girl as this is supposed to be a time that she is full of energy in her life. While obviously this is not in her head at all, this can effect her mentally and emotionally. I would recommend helping her to work through that side of things and maybe helping her to see a therapist about it. A skilled therapist can do so much to help het deal with this. The mind and body are so connected and I firmly believe that while my illness caused my depression, my depression from being sick exacerbated my illness and hampered my recovery and management of it significantly. Secondly, she needs to know she's not alone. Is she on reddit? I had a wonderful online support group that was my saving grace. That being said, please do everything you can to keep her a part of her normal activities, particularly with school and friends. I ended up being homebound educated and it really did a number to my social development. Make sure she doesn't miss the milestones. If she is too sick to go full time, see if she could have a modified schedule. Make sure she still sees her friends outside of school too. Help her to push herself as much as she can without going too far where she'll be down for days. Its a balancing act that's hard to get the hang of so sometimes people err on the side of caution for fear of exhaustion and pain. But that isolation can be much more harmful sometimes. Please tell her she's not alone, she can get better/have this managed better, and no matter what - she can get through this and have a good happy life just like anyone else.  Also please make sure that she knows without a doubt that the people who matter in her life know she's not faking to get out of school. Don't put up with anyone, especially doctors, implying otherwise."
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,ponyfarmer,2,Sun Apr 26 12:25:51 2015 UTC,"She's actually only told her best friend about her diagnoses. She doesn't want pity or the questions from anyone. We are looking into the homebound program. We've set up Saturday's as her ""play date"" day. She has to fully rest on Friday and usually crashes on Saturday after a few hours. I will look into finding someone for her to talk to. I don't want this to effect her in a negative way (even though I know this is a life changing event for her). Since January she has missed over a month of school. This was mainly from being misdiagnosed several times."
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,ponyfarmer,2,Sun Apr 26 16:58:48 2015 UTC,"There are some helpful things over in the wiki at /r/cfs, like how to pace yourself to conserve energy.   If Lyrica isn't controlling her pain I don't have many suggestions. Vitamin D and magnesium help me but it doesn't work for everyone. Staying warm helps a bit.   Low vitamin D is easy to fix, although it takes time. She can safely take up to 10,000 IU a day to counteract the deficiency. I would go with D3 but D2 also works. It will take a month to start feeling better, several months to get to normal levels. After that she can drop down to a maintenance dose. My maintenance dose is high at 5,000 IU but  I get yearly tests to monitor my level so I know I am not overdoing it."
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,thatsnotgneiss,2,Sun Apr 26 14:28:33 2015 UTC,"The beginning is the worst part of having a chronic illness, I find. The road to acceptance can be long, it was for me at least, and I was 23 when it started (25 now). (I also had lupus scare, I don't have it yet but it's somewhat likely that I'll get it at some point.) She is so much younger that it might be way harder for her. I was terribly afraid of having to give up on things; friends, studies, work, dreams etc., and becoming a burden to my loved ones. So my advice would be: do your best to show her that this won't be the case. She might need special arrangements with school etc., but she can still do things she enjoys, be with the people she likes and be happy with her life. Encourage her to do things (not to the point of exhaustion of course) and to get out of bed and home. It can be just little things, just something every day that keeps her somewhat active. In the beginning it's so very easy to fall to the trap of isolation and hopelessness, and it makes the acceptance a lot harder. Try to make your family's everyday life as ""normal"" as possible and make sure she sees her friends. Encourage her to invite them over if that's easier for her. Try to see to it that people around her treat her as the same person she has always been, not as a ""sick person"" that needs to be treated differently.  Be sure to get her a doctor that really listens to her, that she finds trustworthy. This is very important, as I'm sure you already know.  Some changes in diet may help, but this is very different for everyone. Avoiding red meat has been very helpful for me, especially with getting rid of nausea. Adding certain fruits like pomegranates and avocadoes, as well as nuts, has been helpful too. Also grains work well with me, I eat lots of porridges. And when I feel absolutely horrible, strong tea with lots of ginger and honey works better than anything else. I don't know if these will help her, but it's worth a try.  I wish her the best. Hopefully the doctor will find helpful treatment soon."
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,thatsnotgneiss,2,Sun Apr 26 14:33:40 2015 UTC,We have eliminated all red meat from her diet already. She said it hurts to eat. Her nausea is one of the worst things. We are learning as we go. She's lost over 25 pounds in two months. Would an over the counter fish oil help?
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,dorkacon69,2,Sun Apr 26 17:17:32 2015 UTC,"Fish oil might help. Is she able to eat fish or chicken in meals? My nausea occasionally gets really bad, when that happens I usually limit my diet to fresh vegetables, fruits, soups etc. Have you tried homemade cream soups? They are generally easy to eat when nauseous, and you can add cream, cheese and such to help with the weight loss. Avocadoes and bananas might be good at that too. If protein intake is a problem, perhaps beans and such could be of help.  Some claim that nightshades can worsen lupus and/or fibro symptoms, though as far as I know there is no scientific support for that yet. But at least for me potatoes are nearly always bad."
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,dorkacon69,2,Sun Apr 26 17:58:22 2015 UTC,"Usually we stick to easy meals that have very little to no meat. She can eat small amount of fish and chicken. But only if nausea meds are taken twenty minutes before.  I've had to eliminate any spicy foods. They make her nauseous. If she can't eat it, then I don't cook it. I don't want her to have to watch us eat her favorites in front of her. We've all altered our diets to make her more comfortable."

Please note; that all the Cod Liver Supplements do have an aftertaste if you burp! And some brands are just disgusting...I HATE fish but this is the only brand I can take...I too was low in Vitamin D, I was a 12 at one time!...My Doctor put me on the prescription RX for that...Then he retested my blood after the course of 1 pill a week for, I believe, 6 weeks or so...I truly hope your daughter will feel better soon."
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,timeflies26,2,Sun Apr 26 22:59:24 2015 UTC,My husband takes them as a extra boost for lubrication of the joints (at least I think that's what he said....married long enough that I only half listened). I was curious as if that would be something that would help with fibro (considering most of her pain seems to be located in her joints and muscles)
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,Merkinfumble,2,Mon Apr 27 04:24:12 2015 UTC,"I HIGHLY recommend picking up a copy of Dr. Margaret Caudill's 'Managing Pain Before It Manages You'. It's in a sort of workbook format, so I would make some copies for yourself and immediate family members, and then give the book to your daughter to explore. It's not only well written, it's a method of pain management that has been scientifically proven effective for the improvement of one's life :)   Also I would get her a therapist who is a clinical psychologist with experience in managing pain (not a clinical LMSW or psychiatrist unless her doctor refers her to a psychiatrist for other reasons related to her pain). Being in a ton of pain and learning to manage other health problems can be a hugely disruptive process. Her young mind is still forming and she should be focusing on normal teenager stuff, but has this whole extra set of experiences getting into the flow of what makes her who she is.  A good psychologist will have a full toolkit of methods for managing anything from anxiety to insomnia to depression. It will give her a place to vent and compartmentalize the negative aspects of chronic illness without it taking over her life and psyche. A therapist can help her modify her life to be highly satisfactory within any new limitations. I personally find that a great therapist is as integral to managing chronic pain and illness as a physician and medication.   The best thing you can do is provide her with tools to improve her life and her symptoms while learning about them yourself. I have known a lot of people who catastrophize chronic illness by reacting to my comments or situation in horror or over the top sympathy (""oh my god, that's AWFUL"", or crying or acting panicky about a scary symptom, etc ). As her parent, it will be hard for you to not get upset and internalize the things she is going through. But remember that you are what she associates with being safe and cared for. If you are panicking, it will be hard for her to feel safe. She may even decide not to share scary symptoms with you. If you are having a hard time dealing with your own emotions associated with all of this (which would be 100% understandable), I would recommend you also seeing a clinical psychologist. You want your daughter to feel safe and not like the illness is out to get her and ruining her life. Staying strong about scary symptoms or long term prognosis is key to not allowing the illness to mentally get the better of her.   Always collect all medical records after appointments, take and read notes, ask questions, get referrals as needed, etc. Managing a complicated chronic illness requires carefully coordinated, expensive care that she can comply with. It's worth it because having a good quality of life for your daughter is important to you <3  Having all of her records on hand means you will be more informed and able to help her learn about managing her condition. It will mean less time dealing with records transferring to new specialists. It will mean she is already prepared in case she needs to file for social security. You will be able to ask better questions of doctors and learn more about the condition.   I could write alllll day on the topic of managing a complicated illness and chronic pain, but I know you have lots of good comments on here and you are already taking the right first steps by trying to learn how to help her. You sound like a great parent :)  Please feel free to contact me anytime with any questions. I have been managing coexisting complicated conditions for a long time now and it's a hell of a learning curve but with a very worthwhile greener pasture on the other side :)  All the best wishes always. I hope the SLE test comes back negative.   EDIT: I noticed some talk on here about the SLE test and positive versus negative ANA. Her doctor will likely be able to clarify any questions you have, but keep in mind that a positive ANA test also does not necessarily mean lupus, just like a negative one does not necessarily NOT mean lupus. I know that is confusing, but if they say they are either ruling out lupus or still considering it, clarify how they come to this conclusion :) If they are unable to give you a satisfactory answer or are very unsure, take your daughter, the test results, and all other records, to another rheumatologist for a second opinion :)"
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,FibroMan,1 point,Sun Apr 26 14:48:50 2015 UTC,"From the beginning we have kept a notebook of all of her symptoms, dates, doctors visits, and medications that have been tried. We keep a daily long of her good and bad days. Her list of symptoms is over 3 pages: joint paint, all over pain, headaches, nausea, hallucinations, etc. We kind of learned what some of her triggers are (stress, school, general worry over people treating her different)."
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,opticspeck,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:24:37 2015 UTC,"That's excellent :) it will provide a ton of info that she and the doctors can use to help her improve her life & you'll have a jump start on that handbook/workbook if you decide to pick it up.   I would definitely still pull her records from every doctor every couple of visits  because it will give you a really good picture of if they are really on the same page as you and can be very valuable for getting better info to other specialists.  Especially with complicated illnesses thy come with lots and lots of symptoms, it is very easy for a doctor to either miss something or note something without it necessarily being clear until you see the notes. I have had absolutely excellent doctors completely fail to note relevant symptoms even when I have provided them with careful details such as the ones you are tracking in the notebook. It's just good practice to have a copy of everything the doctors consider important enough to note :)"
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,Decepticle_Ronnie,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:30:55 2015 UTC,"We have a copy of all of her medical records. In addition to all of the notes we have wrote down. There are 14 blood test we are waiting on the results from. One is the ANA. The rheumatologist believes she has lupus due to other symptoms (butterfly rash on face, rash on hands, upper trunk of the body, hallucinations, etc). Our concern is the fibromyalgia pain and fibro fog (not being able to remember how to do certain things)."
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,Decepticle_Ronnie,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:22:42 2015 UTC,"Oh good- you really sound like an ""on it"" parent.  I think you would still appreciate a copy of that handbook for her (and you) because it's so great for helping her learn how to manage her own energy level, fibro fog, pain, and other things that 14 year olds don't normally have to deal with.  It's tricky to be young and naturally wanting to think about your future with the sky as the limit while also trying to manage extensive pain, exhaustion, forgetfulness, and anything else that comes with the territory. The book and a therapist can help her with setting goals for how much she can take on without causing flares of pain and exhaustion, and how to come up with healthy coping strategies.  Is she getting sleep? That's usually really tricky with chronic pain and is hypothesized to be a pathology of fibromyalgia and its corresponding ""fibro fog"". Particularly with an already compromised immune system and sensitized central nervous system, lack of restorative sleep can become a real roadblock. I am guessing that as proactive as you are, you are probably already discussing symptoms like this with the doctor, but nailing down sleep issues is integral to getting on track with pain management.  How is she doing with staying active? I find yoga to be really helpful with the fibro related pain, as it helps me stretch out and ease into the painful areas as opposed to ignoring the pain or moving less to avoid it. A lot of folks love swimming and I enjoy it just fine, but nothing (including specific physical therapy) has helped manage the muscle tension as well as yoga. If that is something she/you would be interested in, many studios offer private sessions so she can move at her own pace under direction.  Memory and sleep issues get better with pain reduction and pain reduction gets better with better management of energy (we call energy ""spoons"" and if you haven't checked out spoon theory yet, I'd recommend that for her, too).. so it's a cyclical process but it really can get much more manageable that it is at the beginning when every new symptom is alarming and new.  That book also gives a good overview of types of pain, classes of medication, other types of therapy, etc. The more you and she know about the nature of chronic pain, the easier it becomes to manage. Stress and fear further aggravate our limbic systems, causing a more anxious brain that is more inclined to worsen the pain cycle. I found I was able to relax a little more once I better understood that it was my job to ignore useless pain signals as opposed to catering to them the way we do for useful pain signals like when we sprain an ankle.  Having two different conditions makes this balance a little more difficult. One condition involves useless chronic pain. The other involves actual tissue changes and inflammation- or useful pain. At the beginning, it's incredibly frustrating to try to determine if you are supposed to push through the pain or take it easy. Particularly at 15 with friends and boys and school and sports. It's scary to be young and facing things that are endlessly painful and without a cure. Something that is difficult for friends to relate to. But as we learn our symptoms and become familiar with what does and doesn't work for treatment in our own individual cases, we have this cool opportunity to build a more mature and sustainable life. She is having to grow up a little fast because of this, but with a parent like you, it seems really likely that it will not keep her down and instead may contribute to her healthy growth as a person.   If there is anything I can answer mor specifically for you or if you encounter a new roadblock, please contact me anytime. I was your daughter's age when I was diagnosed with EDS-3 and fibro.. and 23 when I was diagnosed with CRPS 1. It's a weird thing trying to learn to navigate the world and an illness at the same time, but parents like you make a world of difference."

Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,xt1nct,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:23:31 2015 UTC,I will order the book. She currently is suffering from insomnia as well. She's not getting the deep sleep her body needs.  With her age they are not really prescribing her anything to help with that.
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,xt1nct,2,Mon Apr 27 01:18:06 2015 UTC,"Consider asking the doc how they would feel about her trying valerian root. I found it as effective as most prescription sleep aids with no side effects. They may not want anything like this at her age, but it can't hurt to ask.   I also found major deep sleep improvement with neurofeedback.  I'm the kind of person who only tries things with hard science to back up it's efficacy. Neurofeedback is by far the most fringe-type treatment I've tried. I did just two sessions per week for some ten weeks and was able to hit a rem cycle much more frequently. Since it's safe and doesn't involve pharmacological treatment, I thought I'd recommend it as something to look into since she is struggling with sleep quality :)"
Fibromyalgia,33wo3e,xt1nct,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:17:47 2015 UTC,I will ask! I know she currently isn't getting the rest she needs.

Don't be too scared of the list of everything that could possibly go wrong.  If it doesn't work for you then you stop taking it and you try the next drug.  It takes months of trial and error to find the right combination that will work for you, so you might as well start trying drugs straight away.  I was on Lyrica (pregabalin) before I was diagnosed with fibro, after trying a few SSRI's and SNRI's that didn't make a difference to my pain.  With the benefit of hindsight, I would have wanted to start my treatment with Lyrica, because it is strong enough to make a significant difference to pain levels, you can tell fairly quickly whether it is working, it can continue to work for a long time and it isn't as risky as opioids.  There is about a 50% chance that it will make you feel worse rather than better, but if it doesn't work then at least you know that you can move on to other treatments."

It's the more serious things, such as '1 in 10' people have seizures etc. that concern me And the tingling of extremities especially, as that's a symptom I'm trying to get rid of - not increase :/ I really didn't want Lyrica due to the weight gain (it's bad enough not being able to train the way I used to), so Topamax was the next option. It's good to hear your wife is doing well on it though, the doc did actually say it would help alot with my migraines. I don't do well on opiods, my stomach goes to bits. I guess it comes to a point where it's 'take the risk' or 'live with it' and I'm finding it increasingly difficult to live with, so..."
Fibromyalgia,33tcb5,irishgrrl,2,Sat Apr 25 16:18:13 2015 UTC,"I was on Topamax for about 7 years. It was prescribed for migraine prevention, not FMS. I had yearly blood tests because it can be dangerous for the kidneys. It was.   I kept having kidney symptoms, and the migraines increased in severity and frequency the last 6 months I was on it. I was formally diagnosed with Stage 3 Kidney Disease. The nephrologist immediately took me off the med and warned never to take it again. Six months after diagnosis, my kidney numbers improved, the migraines stopped and FMS is better.  But that's not what bothered me about topiramate. There's this odd sense of malaise I suffered from. I'd sit there and think about doing something, want to do it, be excited about doing it but just couldn't do it. And, it affected my ability to feel and work. I just couldn't retain knowledge, concentrate or apply thought. I actually stopped working. Quit my job. I'm fine now.   Should you elect to take Topiramate, I would suggest that you have a blood test first so you have a baseline. Drink a lot of water. And start very slowly, increasing the dosage as recommended by the Dr.   But I'm really confused why a doctor is putting you on this for something other than migraines, epilepsy or bipolar disease."
Fibromyalgia,33tmma,CaniBeSerious,6,Sat Apr 25 14:47:24 2015 UTC,"Weight loss happens in the kitchen. At least 80% of weight loss can be attributed to diet. Even if you can't exercise you can lose weight. But it takes a lot of activity to burn off not a lot of food, so you're better off controlling your intake. Of course exercise is good for you in more ways than burning calories so you want to do what you can without aggravating your fibro.  Find an online calorie tracker, like myfitnesspal.com, and get a food scale. Start logging your food and watching your calories. You can also log your exercise and buy yourself a few calories."

Fibromyalgia,33tmma,Ialmostthewholepost,1 point,Sat Apr 25 19:38:31 2015 UTC,"I was on gabapentin and with no changes in diet or movement I gained 120lbs.  I lost that weight by doing the below, and slowly increasing my walking distance and intensity slowly.  4 years ago walking 200m three times a day was a nightmare.  With a lot of medical cannabis and pounding feet I managed 10.5km in one shot a couple months back, and I now try to average 3 to 5 kilometers per day.  Wipes me out, but my weight stays decently steady despite severe hypothyroidism to accompany the fibro.  I've found walking to be the best so far, swimming if you can do it - I have troubles with it because of previous injuries on top of fibro but do it if you can, it's great for your whole body and people find benefit from weightless aspect. Increasing the intensity of walking, whether by leveraging hills to provide a challenge or increasing your speed - or both - can help you lose fat.  Longer walks, 45 to 60 minutes, is where the body starts to burn burn fat more optimally, especially on an empty stomach.  On my better days I shoot for 2 walks a day, one in the morning on an empty stomach, and one before my late supper.  I try for 30 minutes minimum, and try not to take breaks unless absolutely necessary so that my heart rate stays up.  I also carry my portable cannabis vaporizer with me so that I can get my walks in and treat peak pain if and when I need to.  For you, take your kids for the walk.  A stroller/buggy is extra resistance, the activity is good for you and your kids (my nephew is close to your oldest and lives for his walks with his uncle now), and can be relaxing once the kids get into the rhythm of it.  Yoga would be great.  Any stretching is good, just be gentle and go easy.  Hell, anything that increases boost awareness by moving through a space and having to move around is good for us.  Don't bother with DVD's, you have the internet.  YouTube is your friend."

My physiotherapist says the best way for me to improve is to go for high reps, basically aiming at 3x10. That way you'll be increasing your muscle endurance as well as your strength (I could lift a heavy thing once, and then feel like crap for the rest of the day, now I can lift it and lift it again and still not feel as bad as I used to).  I was lifting untill I got hit with Glandular Fever, so I am completely strengthless at the moment. Can't wait to get back into it though!   I'd love to be doing this sort of together =D"

Fibromyalgia,33rw2e,Quellieh,2,Sat Apr 25 12:51:07 2015 UTC,"I was able to do weights for a while.  I was lifting heavier weights than in my pre-fibro days :)  Build up a bit slower than you would if you were healthy.  Don't push yourself too hard. If you feel like you have had enough then it is time to quit, NOT push out one or two more reps.  Once you get used to it, the aftermath of weight training is about the same as a normal day with fibro.  It can be kind of nice to feel ""real"" pain instead of fibro pain."
Fibromyalgia,33rw2e,FibroMan,2,Sat Apr 25 14:58:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend it. Muscle fibres are repaired during the stage 4 sleep cycle.

New doctors are always impressed to find that I'm on so few medications and not one of them for Fibro. If you can afford it hire a personal trainer at the beginning. This helped me a lot learn exercises and have access to equipment that would benefit me and help me start out slow.   You mentioned weight lifting. I use resistance bands primarily in addition to some free weights because it's a bit more difficult to overdue it with them or hurt yourself. PM me if you want brand suggestions because there is a lot to choose from.  Good Luck!! It will be hard at first but stay strong and stay consistent!

Fibromyalgia,33rw2e,SweetContext,1 point,Sat Apr 25 13:23:58 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I was so happy to see your post, since I just started the same, kind of. In the last couple of days I've started to do some basic muscular exercises (just squats, x-jumps, a little lifting etc.). I feel like it's already helping, although it's a pain of course while I do it. But the pain after exercise is different that normal fibro pain, and it fades pretty fast. It might be the same with you, the pain might not be that bad after all once you start.  At the moment my fibro has been quite manageable for about a year, so it might be that if it gets worse again, I won't be able to keep doing the exercise. But I'll do it as long as I can, since I'm tired of feeling weak and I'd also like to lose a little weight.  The circulation is a problem for me too, I have Raynaud's and have medication for that. That's the only medication I absolutely need, since it helps with pains. But I find that exercise has been helpful with those damn chills, I hope it will be the same for you. I also sleep a bit better after exercise.  Good luck! Keep us posted :) And remember to take it easy and not exhaust yourself in the beginning. Listen to your body."

If there's one thing you should remember, it's that form supersedes weight every time. If you can throw around 350lbs but can't maintain a good form, you're going to get hurt and you will not gain the muscle you're looking for. Consistently having good form might mean lifting less than you expect to, but your gains will be inevitably larger."

(I haven't had any detailed testing recently but I should). I know the difference of the pain from each disorder. For fibro, if I get too stressed my entire body is sent into a huge instant ache everywhere. I was given the RX Mobic for arthritis. This medication is hard on my stomach. I live in CT and the weather changes year round are tough on me for both conditions. For me I wear warm layers, thermals under my jeans too! This winter I used a heating blanket and it was wonderful for sleeping! I have a heating pad here too. I bought IMAK arthritis gloves from Amazon, because my hands ache a lot. In addition to my meds, I take Artic Cod Liver Oil soft gels lemon, made by Nordic Naturals. (These are ""said"" to help body inflammation). I hate fish but these pills are the highest quality for my taste. The best price at naturalhealthyconcepts.com So much cheaper than my chiropractor! Lastly, before I even get out of bed, I need to gently stretch my entire body while laying down. You didn't say your age but if you read most posts, we fibro people have weak muscles. You must retain muscle. For me, I'm in poor shape and hope to start slowly with walking in my neighborhood. Hope to read your doctor can help you."

I eat pretty well and drink mostly water, juices and pop sometimes.  Unfortunately I have never had perfect health. As a toddler up til now I have struggled with psoriasis. At age 10 got diagnosed with the tuberculosis virus, did 9 months of medication for that. I have always had a weakened immune system and never knew why. Its all making sense now. Example; a few years ago I tore my rotator cuff in my right shoulder from basic wear and tear. Doctors were shocked I didn't damage it from sports or from work. Its the osteoarthritis that played a factor in it.   It all frightens me because all my joints make this cracking noise that's uncomfortable. It sounds like it's bone on bone. Its like an exaggerated knuckle crack in my wrists, knees, ankles. Essentially I can crack about every joint and I don't think it's normal but it's hard to get a doctor to listen because of my age."

I haven't worked in over a year but my husband and I are able to get by on what we have currently. As long as we don't live outside of our means and go get random big items. This is I think the part where I start to feel like a burden. When he can't go upgrade his phone just for fun. But he married me through good and bad and in sickness and in health. And for him, he meant those words - he knew working would be a struggle for me and that my health can always leave room for improvement.  As for friends, well, a lot of them have made it very obvious how they feel. When I was really struggling and not diagnosed, I had a friend tell me I was too bitter to even be around. That was the hardest blow I've had. Because I was trying to be positive but when you feel like you're being ripped apart in pain, working full time, and seeing 3 or more doctors a week to figure it out - it's hard not to be bitter. I've worked really hard on weeding out the negative people that think of me as a burden. They think of me as a friend, a helpful and thoughtful person that they like talking to. This is what makes me feel better. (Also counseling and anti-depressants/anti anxiety medicine). But surrounding yourself with people that don't put you down is what makes me realize that I am a good person and will go out of my way to help people when I can. But these people also understand being tired or in pain and get it when I have to reschedule plans. Try not to think of yourself as a burden but as a helpful person who has a lot of experience and self worth!"
Fibromyalgia,33q0gl,Odontodactyllus,2,Wed Apr 29 19:38:19 2015 UTC,"I feel very much the same way.  There are things around the house that I would like to take care of (my wife and I help out my elderly folks), but they involve some physical activity that would cause a flareup.  I concentrate on taking up the little duties; dishes, dusting, a little vacuuming and mopping if I'm feeling ok.  Don't feel bad, this isn't your fault.  Concentrate on working part time at a low-impact job and feel lucky that you have a wonderful husband!!  I know I couldn't function without my wonderful wife!  Also, have you tried going gluten-free?  That worked wonders for my pain.  I also take Lyrica and it works well; though obviously not for everyone.    Do you have stretching exercises from your physical therapist?  If no, I have some amazing low-strain exercises I can send you (just message me).    Another thing that helped me immensely is a very hot bath in the morning (followed by immediate gentle stretching) and then again at night (again followed by immediate stretching).  I found this really helps me the next day.    Good luck!"

That's, um, exactly the opposite of what the study they quoted suggests would be true.

Fibromyalgia,33qa6r,kvoll,1 point,Tue Apr 28 09:58:01 2015 UTC,Consider adding in two minutes of vigorous exercise periodically throughout the day which helps turn on AMPK with any of these nutrients to optimize its effect.  They may have initially been referring to exercise to help activate the nutrients that are meant to help spur AMPK production.
Fibromyalgia,33qa6r,Jumanji5000,1 point,Thu May 7 23:43:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know what you mean by ""exercise to help activate the nutrients."" That's a bit woo-sounding unless you have a very specific exercise-induced metabolic state in mind that affects the uptake or metabolism of any of these nutrients, in which case, you'd need to do due diligence in demonstrating that people with fibro go through the same metabolic change when they exercise (since in the referenced study we already see a way in which it's very, very different from healthy people).  I'm pretty sure they just mean that ""exercise and these nutrients can both raise AMPK, so try them together for a bigger effect.""  We can't even necessarily assume that any of these nutrients will raise AMPK in fibro patients the way they do in healthy people, because it might not just be the exercise-induced pathway that's broken. (Although I think it can be worth trying them anyhow, and some preliminary studies have suggested that a few AMPK-increasing supplements are helpful for fibro.)"

It may take effort to find a good one (for instance I prefer Chinese practice over Japanese) but it's worth it! Also getting enough sleep as I'm sure you know, using heating pads whenever I'm laying down, and doing necessary tasks like cleaning on the days when I'm feeling good. I've also found that no matter how bad I feel, taking a shower (or bath if you're in too much pain to stand) and brushing my hair makes me feel a bit better everyday.

But the traditional Chinese kind is amazing and I'd suggest it to anyone who had access to a good person for it. It cured my migraines, my constant UTIs, outright. It has drastically improved my general pain and sleep problems, and energy and nausea.   If you have someone to go to who is competent and confident they can help you with your specific problems, do it! At the very least it will help alleviate a few symptoms.

Stress is a huge trigger for me, so I do whatever I can to keep that as low as possible, while life inevitably throws everything at you. My wife is also recently diagnosed with fibro, but hers presents very differently and hasn't responded well to any meds at all. So for her, we just try to keep her active without overdoing it (lots of breaks throughout and calling it quits for the day once her fingers start swelling up like sausages).   I tried acupuncture, but it never helped the fibro. It did help with my residual issues from numerous spinal fractures, so it was a mixed bag and became way too expensive."

I haven't tried acupuncture for this, but I've had luck with specific acute muscle spasms.  In fact I had a really really bad neck cramp and it lasted several days.  I couldn't sleep or eat from the pain and finally I desperately willing to try anything went to acupuncture, and walked out with a neck that was just a bit sore, but the spasm was gone.    But another message I want to add is that as I read thru the numerous fibro threads I repeatedly realize just how personalized what works is for each person.  Some methods/meds that one person will swear by another will swear made them worse.  So my advise is to try things, give them a few weeks, and if you get better or worse, continue or don't.  This is not a typical disease where there is a set treatment, it's more of an experiment each of us must conduct on our own.  I hope you find a combination that works for you!"

Acupuncture was not for me, and I get GIANT NEEDLES in the back of my head a few times a year for my occipital neuralgia. It set off my nausea. But it works for many people!  I found a very good massage therapist. I try to see him every 2-4 weeks, but I have been slacking. I go for 90 minutes. When I go back, I'm going to have to go every 2 weeks for a while.   I'm on cymbalta, celexa, topamax, diclofenac and fentanyl (not all for fibro, but I feel they all help fibro regardless), and klonopin and trazadone for sleep. I was on lyrica as well, but it's the one medicine my insurance won't cover, and it's such a pain now that I'm not working every month, I'm trying to go without it. I also use voltaren when needed which is like a diclofenac gel for areas that need extra healing (there is still an issue with my knees/legs that started all of this and I don't know what it is.)  I felt stronger when I was doing yoga, but then I became very shaky. I may try to get into a summer class.

Fibromyalgia,33jv5o,FibroMan,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:10:49 2015 UTC,"My main response to pain seems to be tension.  I take baclofen to reduce the muscle tension, but it has a side effect of making me drowsy.  I take a bit more at night because it helps me get to sleep.  I have found that going to an aquatic center and sitting in the spa for 15 minutes helps as much as a massage.  Physio can help if there are joint problems.  I have had a lot of physio done.  I now have very flexible, tense joints.  For normal people fixing the joints would stop the tension.  I also use a foam roller at home every day.  If I have a particularly tense spot I use a heat pack on it.  Long, hot showers are good for reducing tension in the neck and shoulders.  I used to have massages primarily to reduce muscle tension, but with all the other things I am doing massages are more about desensitization now.  A really tense muscle isn't going to loosen up with massage alone.  Even if it loosens up, it gets tense again within a week :(  The good news is that there are a lot of inexpensive things you can do to reduce muscle tension.  I only go to physio if I have a problem with a particular spot.  I make sure I ask the physio which exercises and stretches I can do to target the area.  Your mom needs to understand that you have limits, and when you reach your limit you need to stop IMMEDIATELY!  Shopping can wait.  Everything else can wait.

It would probably be a good idea to go to PT while you still have insurance, so you can learn those exercises.    I still do them every morning.  It's been 6 years since I was in PT.  However, I also go and get a massage every 6-8 weeks to loosen my neck and shoulders up.  Everyone who's worked on me has said I'm abnormally tight in those places even with the PT exercises.  If I slack on either front, my pain is much worse.  For me at least, they seem to go hand in hand."

Fibromyalgia,33glia,KittyL0ver,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:59:04 2015 UTC,Another one I've never heard of. The study looks promising but I can't find any evidence of it being used in the UK. I'll ask about it though. Google tells me it's for short term use only. How often / long do you use it for?
Fibromyalgia,33glia,KittyL0ver,2,Wed Apr 22 16:59:18 2015 UTC,"Because it's supposed to not be addictive, I've had doctors prescribe it to me for years.  Right now I take it every night before bed and for breakthrough pain, which is a few times a week.  I was also able to take it while pregnant."

I was put on it when I was first diagnosed 5 years ago and the pain's only ever got worse since then. I'm definitely going to ask about  Savella. Did you ever have any side effects with it?
Fibromyalgia,33glia,FibroMan,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:55:52 2015 UTC,"I had no side effects at all!  It really was a miracle drug for me.  Everyone's different, and some people here have had side effects though."

Fibromyalgia,33glia,Ompayloo,2,Thu Apr 23 14:34:36 2015 UTC,A few ideas: you could try a different tricyclic antidepressant.  Off prescription you could try an antihistamine.  You could try increasing or decreasing your dose of cymbalta.  You could try a different opioid for flare ups.
Fibromyalgia,33glia,Ompayloo,1 point,Wed Apr 22 12:11:58 2015 UTC,I'm already on the max 120mg dose of cymbalta so I can't up that. I've been on many anti-depressants over the years but none specifically for pain purposes. Any recommendations? I do take an anti-histamine for the random fibro-itches now and again. And any dr I've seen outright refuses to give me any opioid other than tramadol (which makes me sick). They say I'm too young to be heavily reliant on serious narcotics :S
Fibromyalgia,33glia,Booby_Hatch,2,Wed Apr 22 13:17:12 2015 UTC,"You could try reducing the cymbalta to see whether it is still being effective.  I am currently considering trying nortriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant), but mainly to help me sleep better.  When I first tried tramadol I got nausea from it after a few days.  I then went to codeine instead which worked well for about 10 months.  I switched back to tramadol and no longer had nausea.  To some extent you need to build up tolerance before opioids work at optimal performance.  You could try tramadol again, only occasionally at low doses if you are able to tolerate it."
Fibromyalgia,33glia,Ompayloo,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:52:00 2015 UTC,"I think your right about reducing the cymbalta. I'm in a much better place depression wise and it doesn't do anything for the pain so there's not much point taking it. I'll definitely talk to my Dr about this first though. With regards to the tramadol, I keep trying it and I really want it to work but even a one off low dose gives me really bad nausea. Codine gives me bad migraines so no joy there. Is nortriptyline much different from amitriptyline? Cos I've tried that and it just made me drowzy, no pain relief. IDK maybe the Drs are right and I'm a lost cause."
Fibromyalgia,33glia,lbsmith5,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:43:02 2015 UTC,"Nortriptyline is similar to amitriptyline, but its effect on you will probably be different.  It could be better than amitriptyline or it could be worse, you won't know until you try it.  Like you I had drowsiness without pain relief when I tried amitriptyline, although I tried it for my chronic daily headache.  The reason they give you amitriptyline first is because on average it is less likely to have side effects.  What matters is what works for you, not what works on average.  Even if you have tried every drug without success, that does not make you a lost cause.  There are a lot of non-drug therapies that you can try too.  Pain is a bit irrational.  Some things that shouldn't make a difference do.  I am currently having a lot of success using a foam roller.  Eating chicken pies seems to help too????  Keep trying different things until you find what works best for you."
Fibromyalgia,33glia,athap,2,Thu Apr 23 02:02:01 2015 UTC,"DR put me on Topiramate 100mg per day last November. I take it with Cymbalta and assorted other meds. I like it. There are some side effects, main one is weight loss. So far 20 pounds so it's not extremely fast. I actually really like that. It's kept my flares down, and I've found I have more energy. Lost my Father in Dec to cancer and took care of him for 7 weeks and could not have done that without this pill. It's an anti seizure medication, but don't let that scare you. Ask your DR about it."

It may provide insight into what is causing fibro.   I don't know why I hadn't thought of it before, but if you want to see what is going on with a generalized peripheral nerve problem, you can literally see what is going on by looking at the nerves in a person's eye.  Eyesight is normally not affected in fibro patients, but maybe the nerves in the eye have their own ""pain volume control"" that re-balances nerve signals so that no problems are detected?"

Unfortunately a lot of General Practitioner types (especially the older ones) tend to just shrug off anything that doesn't have an easy ""blood test says X"" result. Push for a referral, any Rheumatologist worth their weight will help you a lot more with the process of elimination that goes into a Fibromyalgia diagnosis."

The reverse also happens, which is why you will hear people saying that their fibromyalgia pain initially started in one part of their body and then spread. There is a lot of overlap between subtypes of amplified pain since it's a problem with sympathetic/autonomic nerves. The stomach and intestines are also controlled by autonomic nerves and that's why so many people with amplified pain syndromes also have gastrointestinal symptoms, which can be chronic or fleeting.   Edit: The shivers are again the autonomic nerves over reacting to the inciting stimulus. That is what causes the pain you feel too."

I've often wondered why there aren't more discussions in this sub about the benefits and pitfalls of cannabis use for fibro. I actually almost posted a q yesterday to ask about other people's cannabis vs. fibro experiences. Personally, I'm not certain I would be able to tolerate this fibro life without cannabis. I am currently in the process of researching a new place to live, and the only real requirement I have is that wherever I go, medical cannabis must be legal.    Since I began using cannabis for pain/sleep/nausea/depression, I've been able to completely discontinue all of the opiate based medications that I've been on for the last 15 years. Finally! 15 years of fumbling through my life, losing the threads of conversations, forgetting why I entered the room I just entered and of course, the soul crushing depression associated with those things, I finally have a little relief. It's not a cure all, and doesn't remove all of the pain  completely, rather, it allows me to focus on other things in my life rather than the allowing the pain to always take center stage. I know now that I will always use cannabis in one form or another, as the fibro relief I have experienced outweighs any negative social stigma of cannabis use a thousandfold.

Fibromyalgia,3350wp,whenifeellikeit,4,Mon Apr 20 02:19:14 2015 UTC,"Seriously, weed helps so much.   I buy a high CBD, low THC sativa-indica hybrid for day use and a medium CBD, medium TCH indica for night use. With my high CBD version, I can seriously smoke all fucking day, not be more than the slightest, tiniest bit stoned, and function totally normally.  There is very little more than just a ""body"" high that feels kinda like a good mood and a little extra energy.  But the pain... oh, the pain just goes away.  It just. Goes. Away.   The nighttime stuff I use is definitely way more stony, but it helps me get to sleep without having to resort to sleeping pills.  Fractured sleep is a huge problem for me (and many of us), and the higher THC and indica variety definitely helps a lot with that."

Fibromyalgia,3350wp,Kromulent,2,Mon Apr 20 09:32:22 2015 UTC,"I'm more of an achy CSFer than a Fibro person. I discovered weed as a medicine a few years ago and it's become a primary management tool for me.  I've just recently splurged on a desktop vape, along with the necessary hardware to hook it up to a water pipe. (My vape is the type that uses the regular green stuff, I have no access to oils or concentrates). This is a nice setup. I can use it indoors without making the house smell like an opium den, and the leftover plant material (called ABV, for Already Been Vaped) still contains useful levels of canniboids, and can be eaten simply by mixing it into whatever foods you like. (The heat from the vapes has already decarbed it so not additional preparation is necessary).  I'm not sure of the exact chemistry, but the canniboids which are left behind in the ABV tend to have a nice sedative and pain relieving effect, and won't make you high so much as just slightly stupid and comfortable. It's nice to have that as an option.  You can learn everything there is to know about vapes on /r/vaporents. FWIW, I'm using an epic e-nano but there are lots of good choices.  For all my enthusiasm I generally smoke only twice a week. There's no reason really, that's just how it works out on its own. I like all the different methods I've tried, and I like to mix it up. They each have their own combination of effects and the variety keeps it from feeling routine."

The short version of the story is that I got to a point where physical discomfort was ruining my sleep and I needed something I could use safely in the long term to manage it. There are surprisingly few mainstream options (NSAIDs are contraindicated for me).   I'd smoked in my youth so I knew what to expect, but I was surprised how effective it was in managing my discomfort. Everyone responds differently but I guess I really got lucky.   Every now and again I'll go a couple of weeks without it and my quality of life invariably degrades. The symptoms get worse, the sleep is not as good, and the whole wagon starts to roll downhill.   The psychological effects are good too. It's nice to have fun occasionally, and it's nice to feel relaxed and content. I used to work off my stress and frustration with exercise but that's not possible now. Its good to have a reliable outlet."

Hopefully we'll be able to research this stuff properly before too long, and perhaps once we learn exactly what causes the beneficial effects, we can figure out how to make them available to everyone.   I've read that there are between 100 and 200 chemicals in marijuana that work in concert with each other - THC and CBD are the most well known, but the other ones are no less important. I suppose it's not surprising that some of these chemicals would not play nice with everyone, or that they would interact with each other in unpleasant ways."

Fibromyalgia,3350wp,Kromulent,1 point,Sat Apr 25 14:12:02 2015 UTC,"The details are a bit complicated, but the short story is that the leftover ABV (Already Been Vaped) can just be eaten as it is, or casually mixed into any sort of food. it does not need to be cooked any more.  The trouble with eating MJ in any form is that the effects depend on how your digestive system is doing right at that time. Sometimes it's moving right along, actively digesting a nice meal, and other times it's just sort of sitting there. This can make a big difference in the perceived effect.  I've had my best luck by mixing ABV into a food item of medium size that I really like - I'll sprinkle it on the inside of a sandwich or over the top of a piece of pizza. It tastes a little funky but it's not bad. Eating that when I'm hungry will cause my digestive system to kick in and get working, but there won't be so much food that it causes it to bog down. I usually figure my ABV is about half strength compared to unused MJ, so I'll put in about twice the amount that I normally smoke.  The usual result is a marked reduction in discomfort, and a pleasant, slightly foggy feeling of well-being. It doesn't feel like I'm high at all, but I'm not entirely sober either, just sort of fuzzy and nice."

Most work was on spreadsheets, so I could get lots done when I was feeling good.  If I was having a bad day, it just meant I worked much slower.

Its a decent paying job, with no physical requirements, and some call centers even have some perks like gyms, caterers, and game rooms.  However, it isn't the easiest job to deal with mentally.

If you find it getting painful after 5, 10, 30 minutes of an activity learn that that is your limit and stop doing it. Over time your limits may increase, but don't force it.

As for if it goes away, nobody can answer that either. You've probably noticed your symptoms go through phases of really bad and barely there. It's thought that those few who recover are simply in a long period of the symptoms being barely there.  What helps changes from one to another, you've probably found most of your answers by now.

The reason I do the above is for the most important reason of all. Looking after my mental health. If I couldn't do normal things and see outside once in a while is go crazy.

Fibromyalgia,330en0,SquareIsTopOfCool,7,Mon Apr 20 11:24:44 2015 UTC,"You should probably get a specialist of some kind - a doctor specializing in fibro would be best, but they're pretty rare, so you'll probably have to see a rheumatologist or neurologist.  Check doctors out online and call their offices to find out if they treat fibro patients.   Others here have suggested alternative treatments, but you should also think about going on medication.  Cymbalta, Lyrica, and Savella are the 3 FDA-approved medications for fibro (if you live in the U.S.) but doctors sometimes use other meds to treat fibro symptoms as well.  Medications can have nasty side effects (e.g., I was allergic to Lyrica and it made my face break out in hives), but they can also help a LOT (e.g. I rarely get migraines since I started taking Topamax).    Supplements and natural remedies can be very helpful as well, but they can also be a huge waste of money.  Friends, family, and total strangers will recommend innumerable miracle cures when they find out about your condition, and I've seen people waste thousands of dollars and years of their lives on the latest trendy snake oil.  The supplements that /u/Jawzper recommended are pretty solid, but try to keep track of whether or not they're actually helping.  If you can, keep a daily ""pain diary"" - record your pain level day-to-day, as well as any other symptoms.  Exercise can help fibro symptoms, but it has to be done in extreme moderation - too much exercise does more harm than good.  Some people can manage exercise on their own, but for me it seemed impossible until I started physical therapy.  PT has helped my pain and energy levels, and I'm (slowly) building up a tolerance for exercise so that I can be more active.  Hope this helps!"

Just a clarification here: Painkillers are something you take on a bad day. The meds I'm on have to be taken every day or they don't work at all.   TCAs, SSRIs, and SNRIs don't do anything other than adjust the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain. I've recently written another big post explaining how this works and how this can cause other problems, which you should have a look at. these substances prevent certain neurotransmitters from being reabsorbed by the body, so there is more in the system. the thing is, this is still a band-aid solution, even if you have to take them for a long period of time for them to do anything. if there is an imbalance of neurotransmitters in the brain, the better to deal with it is to promote the production of the ones that are lacking, with supplements such as 5-HTP (which is the precursor for serotonin and several other neurotransmitters in the body).  as for anticonvulsants... this is an issue with muscles failing to stop firing, and/or firing at inappropriate times. i can't speak too broadly here as there are some pretty serious conditions that can cause this which i can't pretend to know how to fix, but in my personal experience with fibromyalgia specifically, this is also something that can be fixed better with supplementation - in this case, of substances in the body used to fire and release muscle fibers, such as calcium and magnesium.  something you have to understand is that malabsorption of nutrients is huge in fibromyalgia. due to constant pain as a stressor for the body, we spend most of our day in ""fight or flight"" mode... or at least, trying to be, despite having run out of energy for that a long time ago. the biggest side effect of being in this state is that our digestive system slows down. many of our problems seem to be side effects of this, including weight gain (or loss). the other thing is that it makes us prone to nutrient deficiency, which is why i keep pushing supplements rather than meds.  the other thing i don't like about meds is that it gives you the illusion that the problem is fixed. will you still bother searching for supplements, diets, exercise regimes that improve your condition, if your symptoms are rendered minimal by a drug that will eventually cause you harm? i try to turn my symptoms into drive to find new solutions. hence the huge list of supplements i posted earlier.   Ok, I'm sure you didn't mean this like it sounds to me. Because it sounds like the same ""walk it off"" crap that I've heard from dozens of able-bodied friends/family members who'd never been sick a day in their lives.

I hope that's not the message you're trying to send, because that kind of judgment and condescension from someone who also has a chronic illness is just depressing.   i absolutely don't mean to judge or berate here. i know i have it better than many because i can do a lot of self-treatment as a studying health practitioner, so i'm not going to stand here and accuse you all of being weak-willed or anything. i don't think you're in denial about anything, i think you're suffering and you need some relief. i know first-hand that it isn't easy being drug-free with chronic pain and fatigue, and i know better than anybody that there's no easy solution or perfect supplement that will fix everything.   really, i just want to help. i want you to be aware of what's going on, and to encourage you to not give up. but most of all i want you to take matters into your own hands instead of relying on somebody else to prescribe you things. meds can easily lead to complacency, and you will find no cure there. you need to keep digging. keep trying new things. keep looking for a solution. try different diets. try different exercise regimes. try different supplements. peer-reviewed research into fibromyalgia takes years and yields minimal results. maybe there will be a breakthrough for it in your lifetime, and then you can take a pill to fix everything. but who's to say you can't find something that works for you before then?"

Fibromyalgia,330en0,Jawzper,0,Sat Apr 18 14:32:13 2015 UTC,"copy-pasting this from another thread where i posted this:    meditation. this is the first thing on the list because it helps with all of the symptoms of fibro. by taking a time out to calm down, breathe, relax, and basically just chill out, you slow down your overactive nervous system, reducing the stress on your body and mind, reducing your sensitivity to pain, give yourself time to center yourself and bring new life to any battle against emotional stress or depression, and open yourself up to the opportunity of drawing in invigorating new energy from the world around you. to help with sleep, do this immediately before bed. even if you don't know anything about meditation, give it a try: just sit down (or even lie down!), be calm, and try to quieten the mind and center yourself. it will help immensely, trust me on this one. frequent, low intensity, gentle exercise. this can be as simple as going for a walk around the block a few times a day, or standing up and stretching, waving your arms around once in a while. maybe join a tai chi or qigong class, or do some yoga. better yet, do all of the above. the key point here is low intensity - you aren't trying to bulk on muscle mass, you're trying to keep your blood flowing smoothly, your lymphatic fluid moving, and your energy circulating. this helps a lot for pain. i know it's tempting to just sit down all day and avoid doing anything because you're tired and it hurts, but pain is best dealt with when the body can heal, and it heals by bringing blood, oxygen, and nutrients to effected areas. you have to facilitate this by staying mobile. do everything you can to get a proper night's sleep. sleep is the prime time for the body's healing to take place, so it really sucks that fibro can make this so difficult. you should aim to sleep as deeply as possible, and at regular hours (i know this sounds crazy, but it's best for your body if you sleep early and wake at dawn; say, 10pm to 6am. try to gradually push your sleep schedule back over time!). i already mentioned meditation as one thing that can help here, but there are some other things you can try to get the deepest sleep you can. herbal teas for sleep are useful, especially those with valerian (a calming sedative herb; if you don't notice much effect from it, try actually boiling it into your tea in a small pot for a little bit instead of just throwing the tea bag into a cup of hot water). dimming the lights and avoiding bright screens (computers, television, phone, handheld games, etc) for an hour or so before bed will help your body to prepare for sleep. melatonin is a useful supplement for those days where you just can't sleep (it's the hormone your brain secretes in response to darkness to induce sleepiness. don't take it every day though, it's a hormone. it's useful once in a while, leave it at that). avoid eating (and especially avoid stimulants like sugar, coffee, etc) for a few hours before bed, so you're not full of fresh energy when you're meant to be going to bed. eat dinner early! lifestyle changes: avoid or quit using stimulants (like caffeine), intoxicants (like alcohol), depressants (like nicotine), smoking (this includes using a vaporizer, but that's definitely less awful than cigarettes as a stepping stone towards quitting), and visit a nutritionist for proper dietary advice. your body isn't going to repair itself if your adrenal system's on edge from coffee, your lungs are full of tar, your liver's processing alcohol, and your gut is struggling to process lipids all day. i mean, it's okay to indulge yourself once in a while, but give your body a good time out inbetween revelries, okay? be nice to future you, he/she'll thank you for it later. present you can't have all the fun and expect your future self to deal with the suffering that comes after it. supplements. instead of trying to prevent your body from reabsorbing something because you might need more of it, give it the tools to produce more of what it needs if it needs it. instead of amitryptyline i'd specifically recommend 5-HTP, which is what your body uses to produce seretonin in the first place. some other supplements i highly recommend are:  --- Co-Enzyme Q10 (as Ubiquinol, which seems to have the best bioavailability) [150mg, 2x/day] has a huge impact on boosting energy. You may have to order this online, but it's worth it.  --- D-Ribose [5g, 2x/day] is also fantastic to boost energy. Also a great sugar substitute! You may have to order this online, but it's worth it.  --- Korean red ginseng [as tea, whenever you're thirsty] is fantastic for energy and immunity. Tastes just fine, too. Sweeten with honey or ribose if you like, but I prefer it straight. You may have to order this online, but it's worth it.  --- Maca powder [1tsp 1-2x/day] is an excellent hormonal regulator and energy booster. It's malty! I take my D-Ribose, ginseng, and maca together as a coffee substitute. You may have to order this online, but it's worth it.  --- Vitamin D, Zinc [in the morning]. Vit. D helps a lot with energy and mood, and also helps to absorb zinc, which is crucial for immunity. Zinc is also important for male sexual function. You're probably deficient in zinc if you ejaculate a lot. Readily available at a pharmacy.  --- Vitamin B complex [in the morning]. Very broad effect, I use it mainly to help with energy. Readily available at a pharmacy.  --- Magnesium [as recommended on the package]. This one helps with muscle tension and the resulting pain by allowing your muscles to relax more easily. Reduce dosage if you get any gastrointestinal symptoms (at higher doses it can also relax your gut muscles, making digestion less effective). Readily available at a pharmacy.  --- Betaine HCl and Pepsin [before big/heavy/fatty/meaty meals]. You need to absorb all the nutrients you can get if you want to recover, so you need to help your digestive system out a bit. Don't take this if you have a gastric ulcer or are using NSAIDs. You may have to order this online, but it's worth it.  --- Probiotic supplement. [before meals] Something like inner health plus is ok, but if you can find (and afford) a broad spectrum probiotic you'll be doing yourself a big favor. Again, this helps with digestion and nutrient absorption. You can probably find something in your pharmacy, but you may have to order it online if you want a serious one.  --- ""Intestamine"" (BioCeuticals brand formula), or at least slippery elm [before meals or any time you have gut problems]. This is a gem to have around the house, and a fantastically effective cure for any gastrointestinal discomfort. It's a gut liner and lubricant, especially useful if your gut is sensitive, not moving, or constipated. You will probably have to order this online, but you can likely find slippery elm at any pharmacy.  --- Melatonin [up to 3mg before sleep, only if necessary]. I already mentioned this one; it's a hormone that the body releases in response to darkness in order to tell you that it's time to sleep. I don't recommend using this regularly (hormones tend to stop being produced by the body if you are using a supplement for them all the time) but it's extremely useful for when you just can't sleep. Also great for jetlag. You can probably find this at a pharmacy. seek alternative therapies. at the very least, go and get yourself a gentle relaxation massage once in a while. it will help your body and mind to relax, and has a huge impact on reducing accumulated pain. key point here is ""gentle"". don't go and get a deep tissue massage or anything. trust me, that will wipe you out for a week. same principle as with the exercise i mentioned earlier: you're trying to get things moving and facilitate healing, not get a treatment intended for an athlete. i also strongly advocate chinese medicine, because it's a system of medicine that understands and approaches fibro in its own way (instead of failing to understand it entirely and attempting to treat it anyway). i won't push this too much though, as i am biased towards it."
Fibromyalgia,330en0,TheErrorist,1 point,Sat Apr 18 09:04:01 2015 UTC,"It's all about managing symptoms. Your doctor should have offered you a medication to try, like Savella or Cymbalta, to help with the pain/fatigue. If he didn't, go back and ask. If he's not comfortable, ask for a referral to a rheumatologist. It may take a long time to find a combination of meds that works for you. It's about managing the symptoms and also about managing side-effects from the meds, as a lot of them have quite a few side effects. You really have to be your own advocate and communicate. In the beginning, it can be helpful to keep a ""pain journal"" where you write down how you're feeling each day, how the pain is affecting you, your job, your life, etc. This can be useful in presenting to the doctor to show a pattern or range of your symptoms, and also for yourself to sort of see what might be triggering symptoms for you. Once you do find the right meds- don't expect them to work forever and be sure to listen to your body. Sometimes one will just stop working. No idea why. Anyway, read up on the different things you can do to ease symptoms, and try to go about your life normally."

I am glad though that your wife is being supportive and worked her magic on the budget to accommodate you having to take a pay cut.   I feel like these things have so much bad in them but there is always a beacon of hope. That beacon being your wife and accommodating the budget. Not everyone is lucky enough to have a supportive SO. You and I are one of the few. Best wishes!

Hope you can find a more relaxing job for your body and mind. It's time for your doctor to find out what meds can help you. I do remember you've only been on meds for a short time too. I recall your latest flare and I remember the weather, (because I too was in pain a 9)...it was foggy for almost 2 days, that always makes me ache. Along with others that I've read here, weather affects their body. You should take note of the weather or changes coming in to see if you also ache differently at these times. I also get a sick ache, then when better, I go back to regular fibro pain. Since you're newly diagnosed I think writing each day down would be good. (I also have osteoarthritis)  Good Luck to you and your family. Hope to hear you feel better."

One day, out of the blue, I got an email telling me that since I couldn't be in the office more and wasn't able to be more flexible, they were going to have to let me go. That was the first time I'd had to accept that I had a disability and wasn't able to do what I needed and wanted. That hit me hard, man.

The nurse was ridiculously attractive and buff and I was looking kinda hot. He was flirting with me (I'm married, it was harmless flirting) until it was time to review the medications I am on for the fibro...I saw his eyes go wide and he pretty much noped out of there as fast as he could... He didn't even make eye contact with me after that! I kind of thought he was just doing his job being super friendly but when he stopped it was a big slap in the face. I may be kind of attractive but I am WAY damaged.  You're more than a list of conditions! Even when our bodies are failing us we can have a rich and beautiful inner life. Try not to compare yourself with ""normal"" 26 year olds, they'll be old soon enough. Just focus on learning and living as high quality of life as you can. I do slooooow walks and books and good movies and tv shows and those things make my inner life fulfilling and meaningful, even if I can't be traveling the world like I planned."
Fibromyalgia,32qofv,stormyfuck,8,Wed Apr 15 23:01:31 2015 UTC,"I was officially diagnosed back in March as well and I have many symptoms that I have been dealing with for about 10 years. I'm 23 and when I was 12/13 one of my biggest complaints to my parents were how my knees were always in pain. They took me to a sports injury doctor (although I never played sports) to get an x-ray and it showed No physical problem and the doctor swore it was just growing pains. Fast forward 10 years later those knee pains are worse and stop me from being able to function, let alone the other symptoms I have. My step dad feels guilty for not taking me seriously and my mom said oh well it happens. So I'm in the middle with having a supportive family. My step dad and boyfriend do all they can to help me while my mother kinda tells me to suck it up and it isn't as terrible as I claim it is"

It wasn't until last year that I realized I wasn't growing anymore and shouldn't be having those pains.   I'm sorry your mother isn't as supportive as she should be. Perhaps my parents (and your mom) feel bad because they didn't take me seriously before and that's why they're acting this way.  Edit: hit send too early, my bad"

Hopefully your parents become more supportive and understanding of the situation and realize you are doing the best you can with having something invisible taking over your life. Sadly my mother and coworkers don't understand that the inside of me is acting up. One day people will understand the pain we go through."

Fibromyalgia,32qofv,BloodyTotallySirius,2,Fri Apr 24 13:13:55 2015 UTC,"As you mentioned in another comment, I also complained of leg pain a lot as a child. Luckily my mother also had a lot of leg pain as a child so she understood. She was diagnosed with fibro about two years ago, and told me that a lot of my symptoms pointed towards fibro as well. After doing some research myself, and my first flare up I was convinced.  I unfortunately had a horrible experience with my doctor who told me all of my pain was in my head. She recommended that I do yoga to clear my mind. Which sucks, because I was already working out rather regularly and eating healthy. When I told my mother she advised me that's how a lot of doctors react and you just have to find a good one. I'm still looking for one of those.  But I'm rambling, and your question was about family reacting and not doctors, lol. Luckily my mother knows first hand what fibro is and we are able to relate. My father is the silent stoic type so he doesn't say much. As for my boyfriend I'm pretty sure he thought I was crazy until my first flare up. Then he realized it wasn't all in my head and he's been super supportive. I'm sorry your family has been butts. :( But you have us! :)"

This year so far my mom has become more supportive, especially since I try to stay away from medications since I don't like to have all the side effects and problems. She asks how I'm doing, but that's about it. I live far away from them, so I can expect a text from her asking how I'm doing. I also call her after every doc appt to let her know what was discussed.  My dad does not ask. When I try to discuss it with him, he changes the topic. I don't like to talk about it too much, but even if it's just telling him what a doctor said, he'll change the subject, or even worse, say ""yeah I'm not feeling too well myself, I have a cold"" which I have explained is not comparable but he seems to think that what I have is very minor and not life changing at all, and if I e plain otherwise, I'm being over dramatic, as that is always how he's viewed me. It's very frustrating so I don't discuss it with him anymore, and he doesn't care.  Sorry for the rant. OP I hope your parents start to understand what it's really like!

I just roll my eyes when my mother says exercise or go gluten free. I've stopped trying to explain why that won't work, but maybe if you're early enough on/persistent enough, you could thank them for the idea (because they probably do mean well) and explain why that won't help with the symptoms of your underlying disease.   This is going to sound silly maybe but a lot of it will have to come from in you. Have you seen a therapist? It's really disheartening when the people close to you in your life don't believe you. I guess I just sort of let it roll off me and have stopped talking about those issues with the people who don't support me well enough. Though on the other side, in my new work environment (I'm on an internship for 4 months and won't be coming back) I have experimented with telling different amounts to different people and on the whole their responses have been very kind and no one's tried to cure me. So I do have faith in the better half of humanity.

Our wellness lady pulled me aside one day and asked all about my medications, diet, and exercises and though I knew she meant well, it was more information than I would've liked to have shared. Its like all of a sudden everyone became a doctor, but my careful online research was bogus. Invalidated is the best way to describe it.   I feel like everyone expects me to get better and if I don't get better, its my fault because I'm not trying hard enough.   I was seeing a therapist but my insurance changed and I haven't been able to find one yet. I definitely agree with you that this is something that I need to work on within myself as well.

Fibromyalgia,32puzv,kiwiburd,2,Thu Apr 16 01:09:15 2015 UTC,"over the counter you can use melatonin. it comes in a wide range of preparations- 0.25 mg up to 10 mg. melatonin is normally released by your brain when you sleep and they think that people in fibromyalgia have abnormal circadian systems. using melatonin (at the same time daily) helps get your body into the habit of getting sleepy and melatonin causes drowsiness that helps some people sleep.   however, these is also evidence that the sleep architecture is altered in the brains of people with fibro. i think this means, you don't get the normal 90 min cycle with deep sleep, deeper sleep, etc. so even if you fall asleep and don't get to REM sleep you will still be tired as shit."
Fibromyalgia,32puzv,FibroMan,1 point,Thu Apr 16 23:47:44 2015 UTC,"I take more Lyrica at night than in the morning because it makes me drowsy.  I also take baclofen (a muscle relaxant), and I am taking Zyrtec (a drowsy type of antihistamine).  My natural sleeping time was 2:00am without the drugs :(  Note that some drugs make you drowsy while you are awake, but others make it easier to fall asleep.  The latter is obviously better ;)  My rhuematologist recommended amitriptyline (a tri-cyclic antidepressant) because he thinks fibro is a sleep disorder that will be cured with better delta sleep."
Fibromyalgia,32puzv,ericthefred,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:31:41 2015 UTC,"I went through many non-prescription methods without success to cure the insomnia (which I believe happens for the same reason. When the pain levels are especially high, that's when I have insomnia issues.) Finally,  my rheumatologist insisted I stop resisting the idea and accept a sleeping pill prescription. (As I have both Fibro and Crohn's, I tend to have a lot of pills. Over the years I've become aggressive with getting off meds that aren't helping, and a little stubborn about new ones. I've had some really bad experiences with side effects.)  The one I take is Temazapam (I think that's how it's spelled).  I can go weeks without insomnia, so most of the time I don't take it. But it does a good job of shortening the stretches when I'm having insomnia problems. Although, it is a hit or miss deal. Tonight was a definite miss; I haven't slept a bit."

I'm not a doc, but in my own experience, sleep and pain just do not go well together. You might be dealing with more of a pain management issue than a sleep issue.  Pain prevention is one approach, pain relief another. I have good luck with plain old aspirin but it only lasts for three or four hours. Sometimes that's enough, and once I'm out I stay out. Sometimes it's not.  Marijuana might or might not help; if it does help, it's pretty safe compared to many of the other drugs that you might be using long term. I use it once or twice a week and it's like magic for me, but everyone is different."

Maybe you can find the exact right dose of SSRI that minimizes fatigue and depression?  Maybe you could try Tramadol to get you through the next few weeks?  Maybe you could threaten to sue your professor for discrimination for refusing to give you an extension?  Seriously, what an ass.  You are not being lazy, you have fibromyalgia.

On the really sensitive days, if you're not comfortable wearing just a sports bra, try a swimsuit that you can tie at a comfortable pressure around you but still gives you ok coverage. This may be a little difficult, but for pants, they have those inserts for pregnant women that turn the waste ban into a yoga pant type material and is stretchy and soft, while the rest of jeans or other pants look the same.

Have your mother give their Find A Physician line (1-800-922-0000) a call. She can specify her requirements to the operator and she'll receive a list of doctors who are accepting patients that fit the criteria.   While it's important that your (or rather, her) doctor is ""in the know"" about fibro, make sure that who she ends up with is someone who knows a good rheumatologist and pain specialist. Maybe even a psychiatrist that specializes in physical health. It becomes a whole lot easier to develop and maintain a beneficial support structure if you have multiple people who can pool their resources and make smart decisions for your mother's care without needing to speculate or branch into a field they're not very familiar with."

Sometimes you can rise to the occasion and sometimes it's too much to bear - I know all too well that being a caregiver for a spouse takes a lot out of you, and not all of us are wired to be able to give that kind of support.  I'm very sorry for your heartbreak - I know it seems cold comfort to say that this too shall pass, but pass it shall.  However (and this goes for everybody) don't demonize those who recognize that this task is too much for them to bear and are honest about it - I know from personal experience that many spouses try to bottle it up until the dam bursts, and then the pain is far worse.  It's sad, but it's better for all parties involved.  You will find someone who can walk with you."
Fibromyalgia,32jh3o,LadyDrac,1 point,Tue Apr 14 10:34:50 2015 UTC,"Oh I TOTALLY agree about it being a lot, I just thought he would realize that given we were dating for a while and had planned on getting a place together etc. It's not like he didn't know we were planning a long term future. We had several discussions about how I may not be able to have biological kids, what our future and my limitations would look like and we'd check in with each other.   Things didn't get significantly worse with my health. It's just like he woke up and realized- do I really want this stressful future? And I guess not. It sucks."
Fibromyalgia,32jh3o,quad-u,1 point,Wed Apr 15 03:48:32 2015 UTC,By the way I didn't mean to demonize I guess I was just shocked and think he mad some mistakes. W were supposed to move in together and he was still sending me decor for the apartment just 3 days before- hence me being a little confused. He said he'd decided within the last 2 weeks. It's just all crazy to me.
Fibromyalgia,32jh3o,LadyDrac,5,Wed Apr 15 04:18:24 2015 UTC,"I'm sure this isn't what you want to hear... but if he was going to walk away, now would be the time to do it.   Things are so much more painful once you are living together and have to figure out who's stuff is who's... or once you're married and have to get a lawyer and file paperwork and drag it out... or once you have kids and have to see them still for the rest of your life when you pass off the children from one parent to the next.  It sucks that he had to do this now... but he tried. He thought he could deal with it and he couldn't and that's fine. Not everyone can... just know that the right person who is meant to be with you will choose to be with you despite your limitations. They will choose to go on vacations where they can't do every activity they perhaps wanted to. And they will choose to be there for you when everything is hitting you all at once. It won't be easy for them and sometimes they might get frustrated but they will still choose to stay and work out that frustration.   My husband hates all of my random illness issues. But he still chooses to stay with me and work around my issues. Even if it sucks for him, he still goes out of his way to take care of me and make sure I am okay because his love for me is more important than whatever thing we cannot do that day. He still worries and he still works through his frustrations about me always talking about the next new symptom or medical term. He hates my illness because he sees how much it hurts me - not how much it inconveniences him.   I'm not going to call your boyfriend an asshole. He tried for a year and a half. He was ready to get serious because he discussed moving in together... That's a huge effort to try and make things work if you ask me... Don't blame him for getting scared last minute about not being able to commit to a lifetime of sacrifice. He realized you were not his ""one"" and while it may have felt like he was yours, you will find someone who can reciprocate that unconditional love. Someone who will not doubt that the sacrifice of being with someone with your limitations is totally worth it.  I'm also not going to say you aren't warranted here to be mad. It's so frustrating to feel like conditions that are out of your control are what is ending your relationship. It's so frustrating to feel like you let them know ahead of time and they agreed but still backed out for those reasons. It's so frustrating to know there is nothing you can do to change it... so take some time to grieve but realize everything will be OK. You will find someone who will choose to move in with you and will choose to have limited vacations with you because just being with you will be enough.   In the meantime, just know you are not alone. <3"

But the bottom line is that everyone has to do what's best for themselves in the end. My fiancée and I have been together for 5 years now. It's hard. She tells me almost constantly that she'd understand if I left her because of her fibro. I keep telling her, ""I'm still here, aren't I?"" because I do love her. Do I WANT to be with her until we're both old and grey? Hell yes. Is there even a slim possibility that I won't be able to do it anymore? Well, yeah. But I'm gonna keep trying."

It sucks for OP that her SO thought he could handle it and wasn't able to... and I truly feel for her because I've often felt like that too... but I think it would be more assholish for OP's boyfriend to not own up to the fact that he can't handle it, stay with her and instead resort to things like abuse or cheating out of resentment.   OP's ex had both of their interests in mind when he decided to end it because it allows both of them a chance at lifelong happiness.  It's too easy for listeners to get caught up in one side of the story and immediately start throwing stones without trying to imagine it from the opposite perspective or even having the full story. I don't think that would be fair to OP's ex, based on the information we have, to call him an asshole because he's trying to make a responsible decision here for both of them to have the best chance at happiness."
Fibromyalgia,32jh3o,lethesbramble,1 point,Wed Apr 15 00:30:29 2015 UTC,"I agree to a certain extent. I'd asked him to really think it all through before and while we were getting serious because I didn't want to be too invested. I'd given him many chances to get out, but he stayed bc it didn't really affect our relationship. I guess he just didn't really think about the stress in the futur until 11/2 years in which is just very strange to me because we both were very very invested.  But I also don't blame him AT ALL. He did blindsight me so I don't think he tried to work through it but that's his right. He's a good guy. Just a shitty situation :("

My health hadn't changed. I just think it's a little late (earlier than some things, but could have been earlie) to start thinking about it and the future. It's just odd. I always told him I'd never blame him if he wanted out and I don't. But it never influenced us too much. Maybe he just didn't REALLY think about it, not sure."

However, we got serious around 6 months and had our 2nd big talk about things, about what it'd mean for family planning, trips, etc. I asked him to really think about what he wanted and research my issues bc I didn't want to get too far in. If there were issues we'd talk abou it and plan for how to not get frustrated in the future.   So yes it's good we ended now but also, I had that talk with him and my health hasn't deteriorated. It's like he just kinda of woke up and realized it could impact our future and he didn't wanna handle the stress."
Fibromyalgia,32jh3o,Scoobydoobyfu,1 point,Wed Apr 15 03:53:29 2015 UTC,"Some men are not thinkers... they are ""do-ers."" My husband suggested we move in together, but it wasn't until we actually started DOING it until he started freaking out about the implications of sharing the same living space. He got really snippy for a while because he was stressed about it and scared that the commitment to me wasn't what he truly wanted (We were about a year into our relationship as well FYI!)... He almost broke up with me at that point because he was so scared about the commitment he was facing... but he stuck through it because he decided he didn't want to lose me... and then after we moved in together, he realized it was a good decision after all! He did the same exact things with our engagement AND our wedding... and yet here he is, perfectly content that he took those next steps with me!   So I can still understand his perspective honestly... sometimes it's easy to agree with something that seems distant in the future and then when you're actually facing it, you start to realize the implications of what you've decided on and start getting scared. At that point, you either decide not to go through with it or you try and put your fears/worries aside and hope for the best... I atill sympathize with you that he decided he couldn't go through with it. It sucks, espescially since he had given you the impression that he was OK with it and ended up not...  I didn't mean to undermine your feelings on this and I truly apologize if you felt that was my intention here... just trying to also sympathize with his side of the story here when many other people are being quick to call him an asshole for this."

I don't feel undermined, you're helping me make sense of things!  That just seems a bit immature to me, or that if you REALLY think things through you realize everyone is scared of SOME parts of big steps like that.  But you can't run away forever if you want to be with someone forever and have a family.    But people are different, have different past experiences, etc."

I'm glad your bf left now and gave you a chance to find someone who really can be there for you.  Also, use this time to work on you and your health so you can be ready for the next one.

Which has frustrated me bc it was so much later than it could have been. When I had tried to help him understand the seriousness and given him exit ramps throughout the beginning and when we got serious, he didn't take them.   But seeing your makes me feel a lot better. So much better than just friends' words and advice. I'm so sorry about your husband. Marriage is definitely a bigger step. How long did you guys date before getting married? Did you talk about it a lot?"
Fibromyalgia,32jh3o,icanthandlelife,1 point,Wed Apr 15 04:00:44 2015 UTC,We've been together for 6 years.  Just got married 7 months ago.  We've talked about my health and how it affected him so many times I can't count.  We almost broke up a couple times.  Even after we got engaged I told him I was afraid we wouldn't make it but he kept reassuring me.  There are other issues than just the fibro but it strains things so much that it's hard to deal with other things at the same time.   You can love someone but be unable to make them happy or be happy with them and it's hard to know when to walk away.  I know I've stayed in relationships much longer than I should have.  I had the best intentions but accidentally made it worse.  My husband and I are working on it and hopefully things will get better.  I'd like to be the one person in my family who doesn't get divorced but I won't stay in an unhappy marriage if I think it can't be saved.
Fibromyalgia,32jh3o,icanthandlelife,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:04:55 2015 UTC,"I think you have a healthy outlook on it.  And it's great he is still very supportive.  I feel like I'll always have that ""I hope we don't get divorced"" worry in the back of my mind now.    I also have a history of staying in things too long, and won't let my future be like that anymore.  However I also believe in working on things (which is sounds like you guys are and you have someone willing to do that: I unfortunately didn't.  Our breakup  was only the 2nd time he had expressed his concern about it.  That's just odd to me- I would have to try a lot harder before giving up.  But guys are different, this is his first really serious relationship except a previous 6 month thing.  So I don't know."
Fibromyalgia,32jh3o,icanthandlelife,2,Thu Apr 16 03:07:04 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry. Break ups are hard. But even harder when they feel like they're out of your control.

There have been a few times now where she is in such a dark place because her pain gets to be so bad, that she has told me to leave, not to pursue her, that I deserve someone who is healthy, I shouldn't have to be worrying or trying to care for her,etc. I used to get hurt and confused by these things, but today I know it's just the pain talking, and if she says it again next month I'll tell her what I said last time- I can find a chick to have sex with  pretty easily, but I'm not looking for that. I can't help who I love, so deal with it, I love you sick or not. I hope and pray everyday that I may never, ever take her for granted, and that she will continue to accept me and allow me to be the friend and partner I'm trying to be for her.

I don't know how to make the next guy I get serious with really realize what he's in for. Because I don't want to just have something ended at a year and a half again when the going gets tough."
Fibromyalgia,32ipvi,p41215,2,Tue Apr 14 02:45:58 2015 UTC,"I think it is both. I think that there are some patients who have a legitimate problem and are on the search for the correct diagnosis. Doctors do t always like to admit they were wrong or to question another doctor. Some patients may come in with an idea they discovered from the Internet that is not their correct diagnosis but is the patient going through the possibilities. Conversely, there are some people who overreact and obsess about a particular symptom they have or disease that they do not have.  It is my opinion that doctors should always err on the side of caution and assume that a patient has an illness other than somatoform. A lot of diseases cant be identified based on a test or two and therefore caution should be encouraged even if test come back as negative. One thing that I like is when doctors ask me which came first. for example, did my pain come first or did my sleeplessness or depression come first. This can aid in the first line of treatment.  I honestly doubt that people are somatosizing more these days."
Fibromyalgia,32ipvi,chipsnsalsa13,2,Tue Apr 14 06:46:54 2015 UTC,"so, what do you think might be a better model of patient-provider interaction, in order to avoid all the suspicion on either side that might come as a result of an educated patient?  it seems like someone somewhere is bearing the cost, if not the patient then whatever insurance or government system is paying, for mistreating a patient who a provider intends to diagnose as over-somatosizing.  in other words, the cost of therapy and the possible liability of side-effects of putting a patient on serotonin adjusting medications (SSRI's, etc) is still a cost, and is also an opportunity cost for providers who leave a sick patient untreated or who perhaps make a problem worse by treating with the wrong medication."
Fibromyalgia,32ipvi,chipsnsalsa13,2,Tue Apr 14 19:36:23 2015 UTC,"I think doctors should listen more to their patients and get to know them. One of the best doctors I had learned about my background in biology and research. She understood that when I came to her with research I had done that it was well intentioned and I was asking for her professional advice.  I'm not sure about a better model but I would like doctors to do what I do in the classroom. I ask students where they found the information and then I look it up myself to see the credibility etc. If doctors let patients know that they can bring them their research and sources and that they would review it and discuss it.  The best thing I could recommend to a doctor is to be open minded and to genuinely discuss all the options and where they are coming from. If doctors explained to me that we needed to rule out xyz or this or that it would be helpful. In addition, would suggest that General practitioners not attempt to diagnose somatoform but to let a psychiatrist who knows about the issues do the evaluation.  To sum up, doctors need to listen and educate a little more other than just diagnose and treat. If doctors would allow patients to listen to their reasoning it might help patients know where the doctor is coming from."
Fibromyalgia,32ipvi,synsensa,2,Tue Apr 14 22:53:37 2015 UTC,"You're correct. Somatization disorders have become a go-to diagnosis along with fibromyalgia. It seems to be an either/or type of deal, but sometimes it can be both. If it's not easily figured out, it's obviously a mental illness or fibro. It's incredibly alienating towards patients and draws attention away from legitimate cases of both disorders/conditions.  The use of somatization disorder diagnoses has been broadened. From a Canadian perspective, doctors here are starting to utilize the diagnosis for unknown physical illnesses even if you are mentally sound. This is a result of recent changes (I believe classification was changed a year ago, maybe two) which haven't become totally accepted everywhere in the medical community. The change is, at most, a footnote on respected medical boards and websites. It's a convenient diagnosis mainly because it requires very little future work; shove the person off to a psychiatrist and shrug off the problem.   It is worth pointing out here, however, that if you have a good doctor you can argue this diagnosis. The way you go about it is to first ask why they think that's a worthy diagnosis. Before you have this conversation, compile a list of reasons why you think you don't fall into that category. Keep it vague so you can adapt it to what their answer ends up being. Once you know their reasons, you can see how they apply to your reasons as to why you think it's incorrect. Do they match up? Share with your doctor. They will do one of the following:  (a) agree and remove the diagnosis from your file; (b) disagree and explain why; or (c) agree and get you a psych assessment to have it confirmed for documentation purposes.   I ended up with avenue C and so far it's going well. Being educated can get you alienated by medical professionals but it can also be what saves you from an improper diagnosis because you'll have the knowledge necessary to argue your case beyond a vague emotional feeling.   Even with a good doctor it is incredibly difficult to have them acknowledge that your physical problems came before the mental, or to somehow differentiate between the two. It's understandable but frustrating for the sufferer. You have to be your own advocate because no one else will be, and this extends to diagnoses that push you into a corner."
Fibromyalgia,32ipvi,synsensa,1 point,Tue Apr 14 08:11:34 2015 UTC,"thank you for that very insightful and balanced response, and I really like that you included the avenues for a patient to discuss this with their provider as opposed to simply accepting a questionable diagnosis  because of the tradition and dogma that has been passed down through generations which says that the doctor has the final say and knows more than you (that's why they're the doctor).  As we are discussing in this context, patients are presenting with more and more sophisticated of bio-medical knowledge.  The internet is increasingly allowing more distribution of information particularly in terms of knowledge that was previously held by only doctors, lawyers, etc, but which is now available in online medical journals and free coursework in these area (i.e. MOOC).  Some would say that we are close to now achieving post-scarcity in availability of information and knowledge.  In that context, it would seem like patients will only continue to become more and more educated on their own conditions.  How do you see the medical profession and healthcare systems responding to this?  Do you feel that doctors who embrace this issue will cost their patients or their healthcare systems less by getting more accurate diagnoses in a faster manner (i.e. not pushing someone into therapy and Serotonin adjusting medication whereas another specialist would be be to treat the issue)?  If so, do you feel a new model in patient-provider interaction is warranted and what is the best way to do that?"

I'd let your close friends and family know you're looking for a new job, they might be able to give you some leads.  I'd even talk to your union rep (if you have one).  I don't know but 50+ hours a week seems fishy to me.  I hope they are paying you overtime.  Short term, I'd take some sick days or vacation time to get back up on your feet.  Worst case if you can't do that, take it day by day.  I've had a couple of salaried positions where I've worked 80 hour work weeks.  Some weeks it was brutal.  Not sure if this will make much sense, but when I was in a lot of pain I would think about things step by step, instead of all of the things I had to accomplish that day."

Step by step is great advice and it's definitely the way I've been trying things. Unfortunately, it's really hard when I can't complete step one. I had to leave work early today, as I had a jolt of pain in my hand which caused me to drop a grinder. The grinder caught the edge of an I-beam and hit me in the stomach.

Fibromyalgia,32fpf3,IdleRhymer,3,Mon Apr 13 16:57:28 2015 UTC,Does fibromyalgia qualify as a disability by itself? Does your doctor have to put in paperwork of some kind like they would if you were getting a handicapped tag for your car?
Fibromyalgia,32fpf3,pesh527,2,Mon Apr 13 17:12:51 2015 UTC,"I'm in CT...Yes Fibro is considered a disability. Unfortunately it can take a long time to be approved, even reapplying a few times can happen. You need a doctor that will stand up for you. If you have any breaks in years of employment history, that will be a problem. I didn't qualify because I took time off to raise a child and did not work the required amount of years/hours to apply. (I did see an attorney for free). Perhaps you need more time on your meds for your body to adjust to. I remember you posted about a family history of arthritis. Are you on any meds for arthritis? Your job is very hard for this condition. Anyone that stands all day is suffering and I'm sure feels like passing out. Can you get in to see your doctor? Maybe get a few days off to just rest."

I'm sorry you're having to go through this. I know out here in SD, welders are in such high demand that employers are willing to make a lot of concessions for people with good experience; even if everything in your area is pushing for 50+ hours a week, other employers may be willing to let you be part-time while you get your condition under control.

I don't think there's paperwork involved, unless your company requires there to be. My boss told me all she needed was a note for accomodations.

Sometimes trying to scratch my legs under jeans is a terrible mistake because I end up just putting too much pressure on my skin and it feels like I got whacked with a baseball bat. Light scratches do fix it though, I think that has something to do with distracting the nerves, or resetting them, or something. They go off if they feel too much pressure, and they keep going off and sending pain signals to our brain, because that's how chronic pain functions. Maybe introducing another sensation (like a light scratching) while this is happening is enough to disrupt that bad nerve cycle."

Fibromyalgia,32e3ru,FibroMan,2,Wed Apr 15 06:09:26 2015 UTC,The best explanation for why the pain goes away would be gate control theory.
Fibromyalgia,32e3ru,autowikibot,2,Mon Apr 13 11:19:14 2015 UTC,"Gate control theory:       Willem Noordenbos (1910-1990), a Dutch researcher at the University of Amsterdam, was the first one to propose a model with an interaction between small (unmyelinated) and thick (myelinated) fibers in 1959. The fast (myelinated) fibers block the slow (unmyelinated) fibers, ""fast blocks slow"".  Ronald Melzack, a Canadian researcher, proposed the gate control theory with Patrick David Wall in 1965. The gate control theory of pain asserts that non-painful input closes the ""gates"" to painful input, which prevents pain sensation from traveling to the central nervous system. Therefore, stimulation by non-noxious input is able to suppress pain.  First proposed in 1965 by Ronald Melzack and Patrick Wall, the theory offers a physiological explanation for the previously observed effect of psychology on pain perception. Combining early concepts derived from the specificity theory and the peripheral pattern theory, the gate control theory is considered to be one of the most influential theories of pain because it provided a neural basis which reconciled the specificity and pattern theories and ultimately revolutionized pain research.

Fibromyalgia,32f7sg,athap,3,Mon Apr 13 08:38:09 2015 UTC,"I am on the close cousin, Nortriptyline.  IT IS A LIFESAVER for me!  I started with the 'starter pack' where you take 10mg/day for a week and increase by 10mg to work up to a dose where you feel better.  The only side effect I had is dry mouth, which was pretty bad for a bit but I just carried mints and gum and that helped.  And it went away after a few weeks.  I take it once a day at bedtime.  It might cause drowsiness, but I don't know since it's when I'm already tired.  One of the side effects is slow weight gain. I've been on it for 10 years now and I have gained weight.  I have other complicating issues that make that worse.  I once, just once, thought it wasn't really doing anything because I felt ok so much of the time so why take this medicine? I thought I should ween myself off of it and Oh. Dear. God. I was so wrong.  That medicine was working and going off of it spun me into a flare that was miserable for weeks.  So for me, I can tell you with complete certainty that it really helps.  As you said, everyone has to find the right combo for them, but for me at least, it is totally worth it."

Fibromyalgia,32f7sg,foxybisquits,1 point,Mon Apr 13 12:17:07 2015 UTC,"I took amitriptyline before I had fibro for a chronic daily headache.  It forced me to get an extra hour's sleep every night but I still felt tired all day.  It had no effect on my headache so I stopped taking it.  I haven't tried it for fibro.  The theory is that the extra sleep would help with fibro symptoms.  From my experience, any permanent alteration of the chemical balance in the brain is not noticeable.  The claim sounds like scaremongering.  As long as you taper off the antidepressant in consultation with your doctor there shouldn't be a problem."
Fibromyalgia,32f7sg,FibroMan,1 point,Mon Apr 13 10:06:11 2015 UTC,"I take 25 mg of amitriptyline before bed (a very, very low dose).  It helps me sleep a lot better, brings my pain to a much more manageable level, and helps with my digestive issues. I have also noticed that I am definitely happier...whether that is from feeling better or the slight antidepressant effect, I don't know.  I had some minor side effects at first (dry mouth was the most noticeable), but they were gone within two weeks or so. I am taking it in addition to working out regularly, managing my diet (not like I have a choice), and staying away from stimulants like caffeine.  Overall, I am very glad I am on it - it really makes a difference for me.  I am normally extremely sensitive to medications,  but this one is working well for me after a small adjustment period.  I know not everything works for everyone, but I do not think you will be harmed by trying it for a month or so.  If you find you do not like it, if the side effects do not go away, then maybe try something else.  If you have any questions, feel free to PM me. Feel better!"
Fibromyalgia,32f7sg,MsStorm,1 point,Mon Apr 13 11:12:25 2015 UTC,"I've been on 50mg Amitriptyline for some time now to help control migraines and better sleep.  I haven't had any issues with it.  Notrip I couldn't take though.  It gave me this odd sensation of my arms on one end of the room, and my head on the other, and gave me a really weird out of body feeling.  As some others suggested above me, try some of the other non medication things as well.  For me, Amitrip does absolutely nothing for fibro pain.  That is the case, for me, for a lot of meds though.  I'm actually facing trying some med I picked up today that has to be formulated (made) at the pharmacist, or trying IVIG.  I was on opiods for a long time, combined with Gabapentin.  That stuff will catch up to you, so staying off of it is definitely a good idea.  Gabapentin was giving me a combination of lightheaded, dizzyness and blurring vision every time I transitioned to me feet from any position.  They lasted 30 to 45 secs each time.  MS Contin (long acting morphine) has possibly given me a permanent sensitivity to cold air and objects.  I'm not sure if it is a natural fibro progression or the meds.  The neurologist thinks its the med.  Either way, I feel much better off of them.  The pain sucks, but it wasn't much better on the meds."

Aside from the things that just happen when you're on an incompatible anti depressant, the dry mouth was pretty rough. You'll want to be extra sure that you're drinking enough water, and use some lozenges before going to bed. Disclaimer: Make sure they aren't in your mouth when you lay down.  If you don't feel like medicine isn't the best option for you, you can ask for a physical therapy prescription.

Fibromyalgia,32f7sg,PrimaDonne,0,Tue Apr 14 07:13:17 2015 UTC,"firstly, good job on avoiding the painkillers. that's a wise move, as they all come with a slew of negative side effects that will just add to your problems in the long run due to their modes of action, especially with repeat use (an obvious example being drastically increased risk of gastric ulcer with use of NSAIDs like Ibuprofen).  as for amiltryptyline: my personal opinion is that it isn't necessary if you pay a bit more attention to your body. i also think they're risky and cumbersome to be on in some circumstances, as you should theoretically avoid certain foods and supplements while you're on them. but my opinion is biased, so i'll explain to you how it works and let you make up your own mind on the subject.  amitryptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant. in truth, the mode of action of this class of drugs is not fully understood and is a matter of some debate. what is known is that they block the reuptake of norepinephrine and seretonin, which is what they are prescribed for.  for the sake of random people reading this, i'm going to assume you know nothing about medicine and explain what that means. when a neuron in the brain releases a neurotransmitter - that is, a chemical intended to send a message to other parts of the brain (such as seretonin or norepinephrine) - it lingers for a short time and is then reabsorbed. this reabsorption is what reuptake refers to. after it is reabsorbed, it is no longer in circulation, and the effects of it wear off until it is released again. so, if you want to prolong the effects of these neurotransmitters, one way to do this is to use a drug that prevents them from being reabsorbed.  so why would we want to prevent the reuptake of seretonin and noradrenaline for fibromyalgia patients? seretonin is most widely known as a substance that promotes the feeling of happiness, and the inhibition of its reuptake is why tricyclic antidepressants are antidepressants (and another class of antidepressants - SSRIs, or selective seretonin reuptake inhibitors - prevent the reuptake of seretonin specifically).  noradrenaline, meanwhile, is a neurotransmitter for the body's sympathetic nervous system (which is released along with adrenaline to give you a boost of energy in response to stress - fight or flight). i'm not clear on why you would want more of this in your system if you have fibro (wherein your sympathetic nervous system is likely overactive), but maybe the idea is to boost energy or alertness or something.  the other thing, is that they have simply demonstrated some improvement in the pain of fibromyalgia patients. nobody has understood why exactly, as far as i'm aware.  so, that all sounds well and good, right? unfortunately it isn't that simple. neurotransmitters don't just have one function each, so this is where side effects come into play. for example, while seretonin is involved in mood, it also is linked to digestion, appetite, bone metabolism, breast milk production, liver regeneration, sleep, memory, sexual function and libido. so, by blocking its reuptake to try and fix one problem, you're at the same time interfering with many other functions. similarly, noradrenaline doesn't simply give you energy, it puts your body in an alarm state and has a wide range of effects, such as increasing heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate.   with that all said, here's a (very long) list of possible side effects for amitryptyline: http://www.drugs.com/sfx/amitriptyline-side-effects.html  furthermore, there's potential for interaction with other drugs and even some foods. messing with seretonin reuptake is risky business, because if you're not reabsorbing the stuff and you end up with too much of it, it can lead to ""seretonin syndrome"" - that is, overstimulation by an excess of the stuff causing a whole host of nasty symptoms (and in extreme cases death).   if you do decide to take a TCA or an SSRI, you should strictly avoid monamine oxidase inhibitors (some other antidepressants, as well as some herbal medicines), which inhibit the activity of enzymes that clean up excess seretonin, and drugs which interact with the seretonin system of the body (psychedelics, and especially MDMA). also tread with caution when using 5-HTP (the precursor to seretonin production in the body), and foods containing tyramine - such as cheeses, yoghurts, creams, beers, meats, and more ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyramine#Occurrence ).  as the cherry on top, there's also withdrawal symptoms for when you decide the stuff is doing more damage than good.  now, i hear you thinking ""well thanks for destroying my hope there, but do you have a better idea?"". as a matter of fact i have several, which i'll post as a reply to this one to keep things separate."
Fibromyalgia,32f7sg,Jawzper,5,Fri Apr 17 01:46:47 2015 UTC,"better ideas to deal with fibro than amitryptyline:   meditation. this is the first thing on the list because it helps with all of the symptoms of fibro. by taking a time out to calm down, breathe, relax, and basically just chill out, you slow down your overactive nervous system, reducing the stress on your body and mind, reducing your sensitivity to pain, give yourself time to center yourself and bring new life to any battle against emotional stress or depression, and open yourself up to the opportunity of drawing in invigorating new energy from the world around you. to help with sleep, do this immediately before bed. even if you don't know anything about meditation, give it a try: just sit down (or even lie down!), be calm, and try to quieten the mind and center yourself. it will help immensely, trust me on this one. frequent, low intensity, gentle exercise. this can be as simple as going for a walk around the block a few times a day, or standing up and stretching, waving your arms around once in a while. maybe join a tai chi or qigong class, or do some yoga. better yet, do all of the above. the key point here is low intensity - you aren't trying to bulk on muscle mass, you're trying to keep your blood flowing smoothly, your lymphatic fluid moving, and your energy circulating. this helps a lot for pain. i know it's tempting to just sit down all day and avoid doing anything because you're tired and it hurts, but pain is best dealt with when the body can heal, and it heals by bringing blood, oxygen, and nutrients to effected areas. you have to facilitate this by staying mobile. do everything you can to get a proper night's sleep. sleep is the prime time for the body's healing to take place, so it really sucks that fibro can make this so difficult. you should aim to sleep as deeply as possible, and at regular hours (i know this sounds crazy, but it's best for your body if you sleep early and wake at dawn; say, 10pm to 6am. try to gradually push your sleep schedule back over time!). i already mentioned meditation as one thing that can help here, but there are some other things you can try to get the deepest sleep you can. herbal teas for sleep are useful, especially those with valerian (a calming sedative herb; if you don't notice much effect from it, try actually boiling it into your tea in a small pot for a little bit instead of just throwing the tea bag into a cup of hot water). dimming the lights and avoiding bright screens (computers, television, phone, handheld games, etc) for an hour or so before bed will help your body to prepare for sleep. melatonin is a useful supplement for those days where you just can't sleep (it's the hormone your brain secretes in response to darkness to induce sleepiness. don't take it every day though, it's a hormone. it's useful once in a while, leave it at that). avoid eating (and especially avoid stimulants like sugar, coffee, etc) for a few hours before bed, so you're not full of fresh energy when you're meant to be going to bed. eat dinner early! lifestyle changes: avoid or quit using stimulants (like caffeine), intoxicants (like alcohol), depressants (like nicotine), smoking (this includes using a vaporizer, but that's definitely less awful than cigarettes as a stepping stone towards quitting), and visit a nutritionist for proper dietary advice. your body isn't going to repair itself if your adrenal system's on edge from coffee, your lungs are full of tar, your liver's processing alcohol, and your gut is struggling to process lipids all day. i mean, it's okay to indulge yourself once in a while, but give your body a good time out inbetween revelries, okay? be nice to future you, he/she'll thank you for it later. present you can't have all the fun and expect your future self to deal with the suffering that comes after it.  supplements. instead of trying to prevent your body from reabsorbing something because you might need more of it, give it the tools to produce more of what it needs if it needs it. instead of amitryptyline i'd specifically recommend 5-HTP, which is what your body uses to produce seretonin in the first place. some other supplements i highly recommend are:  --- Co-Enzyme Q10 (as Ubiquinol, which seems to have the best bioavailability) [150mg, 2x/day] has a huge impact on boosting energy. You may have to order this online, but it's worth it.  --- D-Ribose [5g, 2x/day] is also fantastic to boost energy. Also a great sugar substitute! You may have to order this online, but it's worth it.  --- Korean red ginseng [as tea, whenever you're thirsty] is fantastic for energy and immunity. Tastes just fine, too. Sweeten with honey or ribose if you like, but I prefer it straight. You may have to order this online, but it's worth it.  --- Maca powder [1tsp 1-2x/day] is an excellent hormonal regulator and energy booster. It's malty! I take my D-Ribose, ginseng, and maca together as a coffee substitute. You may have to order this online, but it's worth it.  --- Vitamin D, Zinc [in the morning]. Vit. D helps a lot with energy and mood, and also helps to absorb zinc, which is crucial for immunity. Zinc is also important for male sexual function. You're probably deficient in zinc if you ejaculate a lot. Readily available at a pharmacy.  --- Vitamin B complex [in the morning]. Very broad effect, I use it mainly to help with energy. Readily available at a pharmacy.  --- Magnesium [as recommended on the package]. This one helps with muscle tension and the resulting pain by allowing your muscles to relax more easily. Reduce dosage if you get any gastrointestinal symptoms (at higher doses it can also relax your gut muscles, making digestion less effective). Readily available at a pharmacy.  --- Betaine HCl and Pepsin [before big/heavy/fatty/meaty meals]. You need to absorb all the nutrients you can get if you want to recover, so you need to help your digestive system out a bit. Don't take this if you have a gastric ulcer or are using NSAIDs. You may have to order this online, but it's worth it.  --- Probiotic supplement. [before meals] Something like inner health plus is ok, but if you can find (and afford) a broad spectrum probiotic you'll be doing yourself a big favor. Again, this helps with digestion and nutrient absorption. You can probably find something in your pharmacy, but you may have to order it online if you want a serious one.  --- ""Intestamine"" (BioCeuticals brand formula), or at least slippery elm [before meals or any time you have gut problems]. This is a gem to have around the house, and a fantastically effective cure for any gastrointestinal discomfort. It's a gut liner and lubricant, especially useful if your gut is sensitive, not moving, or constipated. You will probably have to order this online, but you can likely find slippery elm at any pharmacy.  --- Melatonin [up to 3mg before sleep, only if necessary]. I already mentioned this one; it's a hormone that the body releases in response to darkness in order to tell you that it's time to sleep. I don't recommend using this regularly (hormones tend to stop being produced by the body if you are using a supplement for them all the time) but it's extremely useful for when you just can't sleep. Also great for jetlag. You can probably find this at a pharmacy. seek alternative therapies. at the very least, go and get yourself a gentle relaxation massage once in a while. it will help your body and mind to relax, and has a huge impact on reducing accumulated pain. key point here is ""gentle"". don't go and get a deep tissue massage or anything. trust me, that will wipe you out for a week. same principle as with the exercise i mentioned earlier: you're trying to get things moving and facilitate healing, not get a treatment intended for an athlete. i also strongly advocate chinese medicine, because it's a system of medicine that understands and approaches fibro in its own way (instead of failing to understand it entirely and attempting to treat it anyway). i won't push this too much though, as i am biased towards it.   anyway, this all took way too long to type up. i hope somebody finds this information useful."

I think I'm just having trouble admitting that I need low level exercise because the fibro has caused me to gain weight.  Are there any alternative things I can do to lose weight? Sorry for the barrage of questions. Thanks for sharing your knowledge and I will look into Chinese medicine."
Fibromyalgia,32f7sg,Gr33n_Rider,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:23:49 2015 UTC,"hmm... i haven't got personal experience dealing with weight gain from my fibro - actually for me it was the opposite, i lost too much weight. but here's what i know from theory:  eating habits and day-to-day food choices are probably a good place to start looking. the obvious things to mention are to eat less fatty, greasy, oily, and sugary foods. other than that, try to eat food that's easy for your body to digest and process properly; red meat is a big one here. consider going vegetarian for a week or two and see if that has any impact. try making stews and soups, which are nutritious and easy for your body to process.  from a metabolic point of view, you should avoid snacking between meals, so your body spends less time in the ""storing energy while digesting"" phase and more in the ""using stored energy because we're out of food phase""  the other important thing is to not overeat; in chinese medicine there's a saying that you should eat only until you're 70% full. chewing your food long and properly is also important."

I use a strong steroid ointment at the first sign of itching, and I always keep my nails cut short.

It seems to have started in my extremities and spread from there. Neither I or anyone in my household has changed detergents, soaps, lotions or anything else that could have gotten on my skin. It's accompanied by a sensation of crawling skin, like it feels like the hairs on my legs are moving in the follicles. I don't shave my legs but when I tried to shower earlier it made the itching so much worse. I've always tended to have itching on the bottom of my feet after being on my feet for a long time or sometimes after showering, I always just attributed it to neuropathy, like my feet getting circulation back. It's Just never spread to anywhere else before now. I've been doing some reading and there seems to be a connection between itching and fibro.

I am too big to go totally braless and feel comfortable in public though, so I wear a tank top with a shelf under my clothes or a sports bra with straps on each side, not a t-strap in the back.  The t-strap is worse for my pain locations, but based on where your pain was, maybe they would be better for you. It's worth trying a couple alternatives to find the right one.    The other thing I do when I can't get a tank or sports bra on because it hurts too much to put my arms up, is I just wear a halter-style bra, a little tube-top bra with no straps, that i pull up over my legs so raising my arms isn't required (until I have to put a shirt on that doesn't button).  I end up hiking it back into place occasionally, but its better than the pain.  Those might be okay if the straps cause you pain."

Other General Tips: I make sure to get a solid 9 hours of sleep every night and sleep minimally during the day. I try to avoid as much sugar as possible (helps greatly with sinus infections, energy levels, and even pain).  I have done meditating before and beginners mild yoga (I need to get back into it) which really helps keep my mind at peace and allows me to continue to be accepting of myself and my disease.

I have CFS as well as fibro and chronic sinus infections is a symptom of CFS. I would definitely talk to your doctor about your specific situation.  The reason why going off sugar helps me so much (as far as I understand) is the fact that what ever I really do have when it comes to sinuses (I don't think that I get a bacterial infection that goes away and then I get another one, its more like a viral infection that is dormant vs active) feeds off sugar and becomes active when my body has extra sugar in it, but when I eat mostly proteins this infection becomes dormant because all of the sugars that the protein breaks down into are immediately used by my own body."

Just in case you were still on the fence about it.   I've been taking malic acid and magnesium for a couple of years now and personally found that it helped a lot with the muscle pain and tenderness. It doesn't seem to help much with cramps and 'knots' (or the pain caused by those things) or other types of pain (like skin sensitivity, head aches, and so on.)  This brand of malic acid I started with taking as directed (one 500 mg capsule three times a day) but after six months or so, I started taking it twice a day, and I take once a day now, as that seems to be enough to maintain the effect. Can never be sure that things aren't acting as placebos, but when I started taking it, I'd get that wham of pain from every little touch as a usual thing, and now that tends to happen only during a particularly nasty flare up.  I take this magnesium mostly because it's cheap. I'd recommend getting a more absorbable formulation (not magnesium oxide.) As others have said, be careful with it. I've got problems with constipation (even with added fiber, hydration, etc.) and taking the magnesium has been helpful with that. I take it once a day and it tends to assist with that issue. I can't say for certain how much it helps with muscles, but I figure it can really only help if taken in moderation. It works with Vitamin D and calcium in bones and such too.  TL;DR: I'd recommend (clearing it with your doctor and) trying it. It's definitely worth the cost of a bottle of each to see if it helps you."

I have no idea what dosage is necessary for it to be effective, or how much that might vary from person to person.   edit: I'd never heard about taking magnesium before bed like that. Thank you for mentioning that; I'm going to try it."
Fibromyalgia,320iwt,GMU_TheHulk,9,Thu Apr 9 16:33:39 2015 UTC,No one(besides others diagnosed with the same or similar issues) understands the way I feel and it is isolating.  I don't talk about it anymore and just turn everything inward which causes anxiety and more stress.  I've made an appt and I'm hoping having a psychiatrist to talk to and vent will alleviate some of the alone feeling and will point me in a direction to decrease the anxiety and general feeling overwhelmed and over sensitive physically and mentally.  You are not alone.  I hope you feel better soon and I'm sorry you are dealing with this.  Best wishes to you and your family.
Fibromyalgia,320iwt,havinabadtime,3,Thu Apr 9 16:53:00 2015 UTC,"I've been struggling with this because I feel like I shouldn't have to pay someone to be my friend, to sympathize with me, to just listen :-( I hate that most of the people who claim to care about me don't want to talk about the bad that comes with the good.

Fibromyalgia,320iwt,lady_skendich,3,Thu Apr 9 22:05:14 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't look at it like paying someone to listen. I see it as someone who went to school to be able to listen to your problems and guide you in a direction to help them.  No it won't cure fibro but if having someone help me cope with anxiety or just listen and let me ""dump"" my problems and feelings that weigh be down will help lessen the weight it is absolutely worth it.  The psychiatrist can prescribe me medicine if I need it and they don't have to live with me.  If I constantly ""dump"" on friends or family I wouldn't expect them to get excited when I call.  It's easier to keep the conversation light with people close to me unless they ask me how I really feel.  I also try to be mindful of people who gossip.  I don't like telling them anything except I'm doing good because I'd rather not have people talking about poor pitiful me(the people I know that gossip make more elaborate when they relay how I'm doing and I don't like that) and my problems.  I'd rather people gossip that I'm doing ok.  That's just me though and everyone copes differently."

That was about 12 years ago back before anyone REALLY believed Fibro was a real thing, so no one a) believed in it AT ALL and b) no one believed someone so young could have it. Everyone just said it was ""in my head"". I had depression too so...that also was ""in my head"".  I'm 25 now, and lo and behold, my fibro hasn't went away. I was trained to shut up about it, and I didn't start talking about it AT ALL until I was 24...and moved all the way across the world to Japan. I waited 10 years in pain before I got any help whatsoever. I just took ibuprofen and put a tennis ball in a sock and rubbed myself everyday...for 10 sad years.  Actually, I knew my current spouse all those years, and when I started speaking up about fibro ""suddenly"", he was more like ""of course you have this, you silly"" rather than ""why suddenly?"" He's actually really my only true supporter, I feel. I don't mean to flaunt my good fortune in that area because I truly am devastatingly hard on myself for having fibro and it's probably been pre-programmed into me by my ""friends and family"".  It bothers me that your wife doesn't understand your pain; and I wonder if it is a bit exacerbated by the fact that you are a man. I can't even imagine having a manual labor job like you.

I have a great doctor who diagnosed me early.  I already had degenerative disc disease and had lots of pain.  My husband was very helpful following my diagnosis but didn't really know what I was going through.  I made him read some books.  He slowly learned about my symptoms.  He has serious arthritis, so I try to explain the pain in those terms or the example of my legs and arms in cement.  He takes great care of me.  We hired a housekeeper twice a month, which was a blessing.  The last thing for him to understand was the brain fog.  He just recently clued into to that.  Bottom line, keep trying to help your spouse learn about your disease.  It sucks enough having fibro without having support.  Praying you have a flare that passes quickly and you get the understanding needed.  Hugs"

Fibromyalgia,31u1fs,manipulationcreation,4,Wed Apr 8 03:43:38 2015 UTC,"The alkaline diet doesn't make any sense. Your body is already designed to tightly regulate the pH of your own blood. It has nothing to do with your eating habits. Fresh fruits and veggies are good for you, just... not for the weird reasons they give.  In more recent years my symptoms of fibro and IBS have proven to be largely impervious to diet. Oh well. But when I first got fibro symptoms, I started craving beef bone broth after a long stint of being mostly pescetarian, so I would cook up a big pot of it every week, and I drank some every night. It did seem to help with the pain and fatigue. Not sure if I just needed proportionally more protein in my diet at that point, or if I needed the minerals."
Fibromyalgia,31u1fs,muinamir,4,Wed Apr 8 06:14:07 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a great example of why one should not take nutrition advice from a chiropractor.   Generally speaking, there aren't any specific dietary choices that have been found to have any effect on fibromyalgia. If you do happen to have an allergy to some particular thing (dairy, gluten, whatever), then obviously avoiding it would be beneficial. But we don't currently have any reason to expect that there is anything that would broadly improve symptoms for most people with FMS.  Most of the best treatments we have now are about finding the right combination of meds that are the most optimal for you, and finding the lifestyle adjustments that minimize the effects of the disease on your life."
Fibromyalgia,31u1fs,onan,3,Wed Apr 8 07:15:21 2015 UTC,"Nurse here, with fibro and fibro-related IBS (among other symptoms...).  If you are having digestion/IBS symptoms, then look into the FODMAP diet. It's science-based, not a fad. Yes, it includes eliminates gluten but it is based on eliminating certain nasty carbs, of which gluten is only one.   I have found that when my gut starts to rebel, I can go on the FODMAP diet for a short time, and gradually introduce everything back into my diet without symptoms.  Does it alleviate fibro symptoms? For me, I have found no correlation. When I have a fibro flare-up, I don't have an IBS flare-up at the same time. They seem to be independent of each other. The main fibro triggers for me are lack of sleep or interrupted sleep, and stress. Everyone is different, your mileage may vary.  Finally, fibro pain is not caused by inflammation; the process of pain in fibro is different from ""normal"" pain (much like the process of pain caused by migraines is different from other headaches). This is why everyday pain killers (NSAIDs as well as narcs) don't help alleviate the pain of fibro (or migraines, for that matter). The fact that your chiro talked about ""inflammation"", as well as the fact that s/he thinks that a specialized diet will alleviate the pain, tells me that s/he doesn't know much about fibro.  I don't have time right now to do in-depth research, here are a couple of articles I found in a quick search:  http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/05/22/314287321/sensitive-to-gluten-a-carb-in-wheat-may-be-the-real-culprit  http://www.arthritistoday.org/tools-and-resources/expert-q-and-a/fibromyalgia-questions/polymyalgia-fibromyalgia.php  I hope this helps :-)"

Talk with a rheumatologist or neurologist who has experience with the condition for advice."

Fibromyalgia,31kqux,KittyL0ver,4,Wed Apr 8 21:20:45 2015 UTC,"My fibro symptoms lessened considerably when I was pregnant.  I had much less pain and more energy.  I did, however, get extremely anxious while pregnant.  Some of that was justified, as my son did have a lung lesion that required surgery when he was two months old.  For a little while there, the MFM thought I had vasa previa, which would have meant a c-section at 34 weeks.  It was extremely stressful not knowing how things would turn out.    Taking care of a newborn is taxing on anyone.  For me, symptoms came back immediately after giving birth.  To be honest, I was so tired that the first few months of my son's life are a blur.  It gets much better once they're sleeping through the night.  In the beginning babies usually want one of three things - sleep, food, diaper change.  Taking care of a newborn becomes robotic.    Once they get a little older, you're able to get onto a schedule, and it becomes much easier.  They go from being completely unable to move themselves any distance to running, but it's a gradual change.  If you've ever trained for an athletic event, you know that the work outs in the beginning are much harder than the later work outs simply because you're out of shape.  I had a harder time picking up my son when he was 8 or 9 lbs than I do now that he's 22 lbs.  Even when you have a flare up, you still manage to take care of your child because you have to.  You can make adjustments to you life to make it easier.  For instance, I usually plan several dinners that are either so easy I can make them while in lots of pain, or I always plan to have leftovers on hand.  Instead of chasing my son around the house, I might have a day with lots of story time, so I can sit on the heating pad.  In short, you adapt.  I've been doing so well, that we have decided to try for another child starting sometime in the summer.  I have already spoken with the MFM, who assures me I can continue to take my category C medication while pregnant.  (I only took Flexeril, a category B medication, the first time around.)  If a second pregnancy is anything like my first, I'm confident I'll do just fine taking care of a toddler while pregnant."

First of all, it's genetic, so you're basically handing your potential kid doom. Second of all, imagine how shitty you feel on your worst days now. Then try to imagine taking care of a two year old while feeling like that.  I know what I'm saying will probably be extremely unpopular, and please know that I'm not condemning people with fibro and other chronic issues that have kids, but I cannot help but think that looks like sheer insanity from where I'm sitting. I have no idea how my friends with fibro (or EDS, lupus, etc and et al) and kids do what they do, but I know I definitely don't have the energy and selflessness on my worst days to take care of someone small who is relying on me for everything and doesn't understand what's wrong (or even that there is something wrong). I'd lose my bloody mind."

It can also be a result of trauma and there are even some medications that have stated, known side effects of causing fibro (happened to a friend of mine). There are several causes of fibro, but genetics do tend to play in."

Fibromyalgia,31kqux,sunstorm77,1 point,Sat May 16 15:45:33 2015 UTC,Clinical studies that show it runs in families does not a genetic link make. It runs in families as generally the stressors or environmental causes can and often are repeated or a different variation of this. The studies don't prove that there is something inheritable.

Having a flare makes it worse.  I watch him full time because of life and stuff.  My wife doesn't have fibro.  She does a good job of running interference when he is pushing me. It's something to debate.   But to perfectly honest, it's not bad.  When you bring the kid home they cry, eat and poop.  The addition of activity to your lifestyle is fairly gradual.  Meaning your life will evolve to include the kid at such a rate that you won't have a problem.   If your husband has paternity leave he should use it.  The first months are the hardest.  Once you are done going to the doctor all the time for the baby, you will settle into a routine.  Babies are very adaptable and will just roll with it more than you would guess.    Fibro makes it hard.  It is worth it. I know I'm not a mom.  But I'm there more than most dads.  I'm also lucky enough to have fibro."

It would be easier if we had supportive family around, we live far and when they visit they are far from supportive...  Pregnancy was really really hard. Hyperemesis gravidarum, hospitalizations, so much fatigue and body pain. But I loved having him growing in me, I felt overwhelming love for him the moment I read the test results.   My son wakes up constantly, it's really really hard. It almost ruined my marriage.  I felt like I was going insane. Never sleeping more than 30 minutes with full blast fibro symptoms un-diagnosed...

Fibromyalgia,31kqux,CaniBeSerious,6,Tue Apr 7 23:44:18 2015 UTC,"Hi, I have a 7 month old and a 6 year old. Eldest was had before I had any fibro symptoms, youngest was after.  Firstly, my daughter was unplanned. So I have no idea what it's like to be med free while trying to concieve. I can tell you it's pretty damn scary worrying what damage you may have caused your baby though (looks like we were lucky though)  Pregnancy wise, I've heard that it's 50/50 whether pregnancy makes your fibro worse or supresses it. I was lucky that about 75% of my symptoms either drastically reduced or eased off completely. I had no migraines, I could physically do more (till I hit the elephant stage of pregnancy lol) and my sleep improved (again till I hit the too big to get comfy stage) It was very similar to my pre-fibro pregnancy tbh. I still had to pace and plan my days around rests, but that is quite often the case in pregnancy whether you have fibro or not. As an example for you, I spent an entire day walking round a large zoo at 36w preg and was fully functional the next day, where I had visited the same zoo the year before and required a wheelchair whilst there and 2 days of rest afterwards.  Post-birth, my symptoms are still not fully back, although I am writing this in pain at 2.30am :S I found my experience with sleep disturbances helped me deal with newborn hours much better than I did with my son. I am convinced that breastfeeding helped delay the return of my symptoms. I did and do rely on my partner to do a lot so I can pace my day well. If he was selfish or stubborn, or sexist in believing women should do all childcare, it wouldn't work. He works full time, does most of the housework (I keep it tidy, he keeps it clean) 50% of the laundry duties, is in charge of bathing our daughter as I can't lean over the bath tub without hurting myself, and plays with the children as often as he can.  It is hard. My son is awesome, he helps me when SO is at work by getting me things from upstairs, taking things upstairs. Fetching nappies and bibs. She's just hit seperation anxiety so he distracts her when I go to the bathroom so I don't have to carry her up and down stairs. I get almost no help from family and hate to ask my friends, but between the two of them we're managing well. It may be different when I go back to work though.  Help and support is really important. That's true for all new mothers, but even more so for us warrior mums. If you have any questions, feel free to ask"

Fibromyalgia,31kqux,shaylenn,3,Mon Apr 6 03:37:50 2015 UTC,"I have an off topic question based on your post. Are you still on maternity leave 7 months after giving birth? You mentioned going back to work so I am assuming you are. If I'm correct, would you mind telling me here or pming me what country you are from? I'm from the US and we get 3 months, unpaid maternity leave and I enjoy learning about other countries that do it right. I'd like to know how long you get, if you are compensated during the leave, how does that compensation compare to regular wages, if they have paternity leave and all of those details, if any support by way of materials (diapers, clothes, baby food, child allowences that are paid until the child is 18) is provided by the government if needed, and anything you'd be willing to share. If I'm wrong and you don't work right now and are from the US, I just wasted a lot of typing didn't I lol! Oh, also, how do you feel and think about the US only giving 3 months, it being unpaid, and the fact that if you are uninsured here, having a baby in the hospital costs $50,000 and up (wayyyyy up)? Only if you are wiling to share of course, I don't want to be pushy at all, I'm just curious so don't worry if you don't want to reply.  Thanks and I send gentle fibro hugs your way, congratulations on your baby!"
Fibromyalgia,31kqux,BradburySauce,3,Mon Apr 6 09:37:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I'm from the UK so get up to a year of maternity leave, 9 months of that paid. The standard rate of maternity pay is 90% of your average wage for the first 6 weeks then a flat rate of either about £140 a week or 90% of your average wage (whichever figure is less) I was part time so I get the 90% rate so we've felt very little loss financially. Individual companies can and do offer higher rates, but usually with a clause saying you have to return to work after your maternity leave for X amount of time. You can take your leave from 28w pregnant, when you start is up to you. I went at 33 weeks to avoid paying extra childcare for my son in the summer holidays.  Every household earning under £50k is entitled to child benefit of around £20pw for your first child and £15pw for each subsequent child. We also have child tax credit and working tax credit which are applied for and given based on your income, number of children, the number of hours you work and your childcare costs.  Obviously we have the NHS so there are no costly bills for giving birth. Midwife led births and active births are encouraged here, and there's a real encouragement to have a home birth if you have a complication free pregnancy.  SO's are entitled to 2 weeks paid paternity leave when the baby is born (paid at £140pw approx) and the new shared parental leave has just come into effect meaning that the second 6 months of leave can be taken by the father (either the whole 6 months or a portion of it) and will be paid the same rate of pay through their employer.  We also get all prescriptions and dental work free during pregnancy and until your child is 1. Prescriptions usually cost about £8.50 per script and dental work varies depending on what needs doing, but is rarely over £100.  As for my opinions on these things in the US, I have to say I am incredibly grateful to not live there. I'd never afford to be able to have a baby. I find it odd that you have no set maternity leave, I've read stories of people having to return to work when their baby is 6 weeks old and my heart breaks for them. Leaving my daughter at 8 months (as she will be when I return) is hard enough. And you seem as a nation to be trying to make birth very medical rather than a natural process - lots of elective c-sections, inductions that wouldn't be considered here and many hospitals discouraging remaining active in labour. I just think a country that is constantly trying to progress, you do treat those having the next generation very poorly.  I'm so sorry for the essay. I hope I answered your questions but feel free to ask any more"
Fibromyalgia,31kqux,Jennicide,5,Mon Apr 6 10:30:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you so very much for your response! I was floored that you can take leave starting at 28 weeks. Women here work right up until birth because they get 90 days leave, if you have to start your leave a month before you give birth, well then, you'll have to go back 60 days after you give birth. Our maternity leave is actually based on a disability  law that provides a person with 90 days off a year for any illness or disability or to care for a sick or disabled relative. Yes, giving birth falls under an illness or disability but an SO can't use it to help their new baby and SO. No idea why. Paternity leave is not a law and is up to each employer. If you're lucky enough to get it, it's 2 weeks, unpaid. So if in one year a woman gives birth and takes her 90 days and breaks her leg and needs 6 weeks off, she is either going to lose her job or learn to walk on one leg. You can use that 90 days as 10 days off here and 30 there etc. But when you hit 90 within 1 calendar year, that's it, you're done.   Oh getting paid while on leave is such a beautiful dream and at 90%, wow, do you know any British men wiling to marry an American for purely immigration reasons?  I don't intend to have children (I tell people it's because of the fibromyalgia but in reality, I really like to sleep late and go on vacations whenever I want to wherever I want. Shhh, don't tell my future mother-in-law) but if I lived in the UK, even I would be tempted to push out a few puppies.   If you're bad off enough here you can apply for help with childcare. If you are poor enough to qualify, your child gets put in the cheapest, worst, most unsafe day care the government can legally use and quite a few politicians label you as a lazy, moocher who is using the taxes of hard working, Real Americans to take care of your stupid children who were conceived out of wedlock /s. The phrase ""why can't you just keep your legs closed"" gets thrown around by a lot of those buggers who really couldn't care less if you're actually married or not. They don't let facts get in the way of what they believe. There is also a lot of poorly disguised racist undertones to their arguments against continuing to fund programs like these. They don't think black children are worth caring for beyond ensuring that they're not aborted, they care deeply for them while in the womb you see but once they're out, they should get jobs and take care of themselves I guess /s. So because of all this, I deeply envy your child benefits. We get tax breaks just like you though, aren't we lucky? We get one thing on the list.   A lot of moms in the US are opting for midwives and home births. Ahem, I mean rich moms. Insurance isn't likely to cover them, some companies do but not all. It's sad, women who want to do things naturally, who aren't willing to endanger their babies with conveniently scheduled c-sections meet resistance at every turn.   In closing, my fiance has insurance and I actually have 2 forms of insurance. He paid $100 today for a prescription that he has to take everyday and fill every month. The really funny part is that his employer that provides his insurnce...  a pharmacy. 2 weeks ago I paid $650 for a dental procedure. I had to get 2 teeth removed in my mid-30's because saving them with root canals would have cost $2500 (again TWO forms of insurance, oh wait, 3 if you count that supplimental dental insurance that I bought last October for $250 that I have to renew every year).  Wow, maybe that belongs in r/rant instead but here we are.

Fibromyalgia,31kqux,PunkHoyden,1 point,Mon Apr 6 11:48:53 2015 UTC,You are very welcome. Thank you for giving me further insight into the issues you guys face - the childcare thing has made me so mad for parents over there. I really am so grateful for our systems. Especially as a fibromite mum.
Fibromyalgia,31kqux,FibroMan,4,Mon Apr 6 13:46:26 2015 UTC,"I'll just add that I love being a mum, and it really is worth the extra effort I have to put in hiding my symptoms from my daughter, who is too young to understand them. But we won't be having any more. I've only had one flare since her birth, and it was before I'd gone back on my gabapentin, but it was a horrible experience and we wouldn't want to risk pregnancy making fibro worse next time.  So you might want to think about how you'd feel only having one child, if you do decide that you'd like to have kids"
Fibromyalgia,31kqux,Gr33n_Rider,4,Mon Apr 6 02:00:53 2015 UTC,One kid is basically where I'm at right now. I highly doubt I could handle two. Props to you! You sound like one heck of a mom!
Fibromyalgia,31kqux,KittyL0ver,3,Mon Apr 6 02:52:41 2015 UTC,Only because I have such a good support from my boys. I'm incredibly lucky.  But thanks. It means a lot to me
Fibromyalgia,31kqux,Gr33n_Rider,2,Mon Apr 6 03:34:05 2015 UTC,"I can't say I have experienced either. But I have seen my cousin and aunt raise their kids while thy are in constant medical pain/flare ups/depression. Seeing them tell their kid that mommys too tired to read you a book is hard. But it's harder when it happens fairly frequently. I've also had a friend who had to rub her moms legs - she had lupus - every morning so that she could get out of bed. Pregnancy could go one way or the other - im sure it's different for everyone. But as for raising the kids- I take my friends kids for one night - and I'm anxious and nervous and can't sleep, they're awake, having nightmares, tired, crabby, hungry. And after that - it takes me nearly three days to recover :-/."
Fibromyalgia,31kqux,Razzielle,2,Wed Apr 15 05:17:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know what was fibro vs. just bad luck, but I had morning sickness so bad all 9 months, and also got gestational diabetes, and just to make it all more fun also had preeclampsia.  I was so sick so much I spent a lot of time on bedrest, time in the hospital on IVs.  I lost way too much weight with both kids (I was not overweight at the time) and gained none.  I lost 30 pounds in the first trimester alone, and weighed less at the end with a huge baby inside me!  I somehow managed to keep my blood sugar under control while hardly eating anything, which was VERY VERY hard to do.  Both my kids were preemies because preeclampsia issues, but still giant.  My daughter was 9'6oz at 4 weeks early, my son was 8'8oz 5 weeks early (and sunny side up too!).  I blame my 6'4"" tall giant husband.  I thought it couldn't possibly be as bad the second time so that's why I had two.  I quickly figured out how wrong I was!  I had so many migraines and my asthma was worse too.  Turns out you can take Tylenol 3 after the first trimester, and I did most nights to just be able to sleep.    My son had lung issues from being a preemie and getting RSV and had to have breathing treatments every 2 hours for the first few months of his life.  2 hours from start to start, so add in a feeding and a change and it was a never resting cycle.  For months I didn't sleep more than an hour at a time and I honestly feel like it was a blur I can barely remember.    But in spite of it all, I have 2 amazing kids that I really love so much I would do anything for them.  It gets easier once they can sleep and you can sleep.  The house was a serious mess, so we hired a cleaning lady. I couldn't do it all.  I had to learn to prioritize, seriously.  Baby first, food for me came right up next to that because you can't nurse if you don't eat, sleep,  the rest like laundry, cleaning, etc all had to just take a pass most of the time.  That whole sleep while the baby sleeps thing is so true.  You think, oh finally my chance to get x done, but no.  Go. To. Sleep. My husband did a lot of cooking.  We did a lot of huge batches of food and eating the same thing for a few days of leftovers.  I am very lucky to have a lot of family support nearby!  I don't know if we'd have lived without it, and that isn't an exaggeration.  I really hope Fibro isn't genetic!  TLDR: It's hard, but kids are amazing."

Fibromyalgia,31fjb9,mrsclause2,7,Sat Apr 4 16:31:18 2015 UTC,"Only you can decide how long it takes to accepting it.    I've said it before on here and I will say it again - Having fibro is like constantly going through the 5 stages of grief.  And it feels like a different stage daily, if not several times within a day.  Personally, I spent 6 years being tested by various doctors and specialists, ruled out things like MS and Parkinson's, so to get a fibro diagnosis as a male in my 30s was actually settling, I didn't have to worry about what I had and started to actually deal with it.  Learning as much as possible about fibro and dealing with symptoms became my new job.  I have days where I mourn for my old body.    You can't change your diagnosis, you can only change your acceptance of it.  I accepted mine quickly after those 6 years of doctors and lifetime of pain and symptoms gradually came on.  I've always been that way though.  It can drive my wife nuts.  As for medications you have to keep trying.  I personally  through the list of medications and felt like shit, the only thing that helps me is medical cannabis.  I've been through opiates, various antidepressants, pregabalin, gabapentin, flexeril, topomax, ketorelac and on and on and on.  Nothing has helped me as much as cannabis, as it helps my IBS and stomach pains, migraines, pain levels (joint, muscle, and neuro), relaxes my muscle, eases fibro fog, and actually has done wonders for my depression besides masking it.    I hope you find acceptance of your diagnosis soon, it can be very difficult.  Look up the 5 stages of grief and learn what you need to move yourself forward to the next stage, and keep doing it."
Fibromyalgia,31fjb9,Ialmostthewholepost,3,Sat Apr 4 19:37:00 2015 UTC,"Having fibro is like constantly going through the 5 stages of grief   So...does that ever end? Or is it just continuous throughout your life?   Learning as much as possible about fibro and dealing with symptoms became my new job   I have tried to do this, but it can be so depressing. I have access to medical databases, and I read every study I can get my hands on...but most of them are inconclusive, or they leave you just as confused as before as to whether or not a treatment will help. How do you stay positive when doing this?  Do you live in a state where medical cannabis is legal? Mine is working on it, but who knows when it will actually be in place...and I don't feel comfortable using it illegally. I would definitely try it though.  Thank you. I appreciate all of your words of wisdom, truly. It's been a dark couple months, and this forum constantly provides more light at the end of the tunnel."
Fibromyalgia,31fjb9,Window_to_your_heart,3,Sun Apr 5 02:00:14 2015 UTC,Seconding the use of medical cannabis. It helps multiple health issuesI have. I take a risk to use illegally because the risk is worth it for me. My kids are all grown. I didn't risk it when they were young.   I just saw some US senators are trying to reschedule MJ to schedule 2 federally. This would be awesome for those of us that suffer!

Fibromyalgia,31fjb9,tends2forgetstuff,4,Sat Apr 11 05:03:48 2015 UTC,"I still struggle with it, especially since I see people that have it far worse than what I deal with now. I think you just have to do things at your own pace. I don't think we have to pretend its all ok, the only place I keep it quiet is at work, because those ppl are horrible. I am leaving that job partly because it is unacceptable to miss work or work less than 10 hours a day. I think sharing with who is important to you helps plus they learn to cut you some slack when you can't do or be what you want at the time.  I also think you need to explore other remediation besides medication. Just my opinion, you can ignore and it won't hurt my feelings. I go to a chiropractor  (I thought they were quacks until I met mine) and see some great help. While the actual chiro event hurts I see benefits after the session. I am very sensitive to meds too, and try to stay away as much as possible. I do have to take some though. It may sound stupid but I have a soy based candle that burns low temp and I can take the oil out and use it on my skin, its amazing. Its little things like that, that help out especially when its really sucky. You have to focus on taking care of you holistically. Even if you are having hard time accepting you still need to take care of you while working through the emotional aspect."

I can't imagine going through it with fibro, so you should definitely leave.   I did see a chiropractor, actually! And it made things even worse. :( I saw a specialty one that came recommend by my neurologist. He doesn't use any of the crazy tweaks and cracks that some use, so it was supposed to be gentler. It left me in even more pain, unfortunately :( I wish it worked for me though.   I will keep researching though. Thank you for the pep talk, I really needed it!"

It's taken too much from me already so I have a plan of attack! Exercise, diet changes, supplements, and the best one of all....counseling! I have to learn how to deal with how fibro is affecting my relationships with people. I tend to hide my pain really well, but because of that people think I can just do everything they can do.

To me that just is not something you post in a support group. And if I'm being honest it's people like that giving all the rest of us who struggle and work hard, a bad rep. I  am really good at hiding my pain so that I don't bring others down. I don't whine and moan that I am in pain. I try my best to not make excuses for why I can't do something.

In alot of ways it was a relief to have a name put to the problem, it meant I could move forwards with trying to find a solution.  I have my days where I rage, I have my days where I just want to curl up and give up, but most days I just carry on with life and work around any of the troubles I may be having.  Fibromyalgia is a label.  There are ways of fighting it, I'm still always looking for new ways to fight it.  One thing I refuse to do is pretend I'm fine, if I'm not I will say so.  If I need help I will ask.  I won't make someone else's life miserable, and I'm not asking for pity, but if someone asks me how I'm doing and I'm sore, I will say, today I'm sore.  Its not easy.  It sucks.  I hate it, and as much as I may try to deny I have Fibro I have every symptom there is like its a checklist of my life.  I forget other people don't live with this.  I just refuse to give up."
Fibromyalgia,31fjb9,SecretKatie,1 point,Sat Apr 4 20:17:51 2015 UTC,"So you've had a diagnosis for many years longer than me...do the emotions ever get more stable, I guess? You said you still have rage days and give up days, but I feel like I have them so often, and I honestly don't want to! When I rage, I am left exhausted and aching (I tend to cry and beat up my pillow a bit), and curl up and wanting to give up just leaves me down in the dumps!  I just want to feel less...volatile? With my emotions. It's also very, very hard for me to ask for help. I HATE needing help. I like to do it on my own, and my way.   I think I need therapy haha."
Fibromyalgia,31fjb9,Gr33n_Rider,1 point,Sun Apr 5 01:53:50 2015 UTC,"ts going to be a journey, I wish I had some advice but I was the same - I raged and fought and refused help for way too long.  Finally, being angry just got old.  I was spending more time being angry and exhausted than I was resting and getting on with things.  My life fell apart, massively, I nearly lost my house and everything else that was important because I was too busy raging.  I have spent a ton of time in therapy, dealing with my anger and my inability to ask for help.  I've gotten help with time management, and learning that its ok to say no.  Its ok to do things  slowly.  There's no way I could have done it alone.  As for meds, I was on Lyrica, and had to quit it when the side effects got too bad - that was absolutely the hardest thing I've ever done, and I've been through some rough stuff.  Now, I'm on Wellbutrin and Paxil (for me a great combination) as much for depression and anxiety as for Fibro, but they've had a positive effect on all of it.  I take Magnesium and Vitamin D daily, and get a full body massage religiously every 3 weeks - I'd go every 2 if I could afford it.  I move, every day, no matter how much I don't want to.  I stretch, as much as I can.  I eat a fairly strict diet, with minimal sugar and refined carbs.  All my clothing goes through an extra rinse cycle, and the cleaners I use in my house are ones I'm ok with.  Its not easy, but you can make changes that help."

Not gonna lie, it may take a couple of years of trial and error to come up with game plan.  I was diagnosed 11 years ago, when I started high school.  I was in horrible pain and in terrible spirits because my fibro made me miss out on so much.  I had to stop going to traditional high school (switched to homebound schooling), missed out on prom and didn't get to have a traditional graduation ceremony (that one particularly killed me).    Things have turned around tremendously since then.  I've been feeling so much better and I've had some incredible experiences.  I left the country to go to college. I worked as a campaign staffer for two years, where I  was clocking 80 hour work weeks and traveling a lot.  Now, I'm 25 living in DC by myself.  I even adopted an extremely hyper Samoyed puppy.   I do get flare ups. They're a lot less frequent now, but they still suck.  They always happen at the most inconvenient times.  I've learned to not beat myself up over flare ups, and look at them as an opportunity to slow down and take care of myself.  I still feel kind of crappy in the mornings, but the tired, achey feeling doesn't stay with me all day like  it used to.  I said, ""accept"" because I believe with fibro you shouldn't truly accept it.  Acknowledge that you have it, but don't let it stop you from living your life and chasing your dreams.  Don't accept the bullshit that comes with it."

It was hard because I really, really love it, but definitely worth it.  I'm down 3 or 4 lbs already.  I still want to lose around 8 lbs more, so I'll be in the middle of the healthy weight range instead of the top."

Fibromyalgia,31blls,FibroMan,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:42:21 2015 UTC,"All my rheumatologist did for me was recommend amitriptyline.  You could ask your doctor if you can try cymbalta.  It is an SSRI that should help with depression and fibromyalgia.  Some people have bad side effects from Cymbalta, so if it doesn't work for you then ask your doctor about slowly stopping it.  If necessary you could ask for a referral to a pain specialist.  You can also try non-medication methods for reducing pain.  A regular exercise routine helps, especially swimming.  You can also try yoga, massage, acupuncture, physio etc.  Try to find out what works best for you."
Fibromyalgia,31blls,lethesbramble,1 point,Sat Apr 4 09:12:54 2015 UTC,I'm mixed on this one.  I've seen one specialist and it was a rheumatologist and he literally did nothing and infuriated me even though he was listed on a website as a fibro friendly doctor.  I was diagnosed at 22 and suffering since around 20.  I've been holding off taking the more serious meds as long as possible so I understand.  I'm pretty sensitive to meds as well.  Good luck and don't take anything you're uncomfortable with.  Up until recently I would just do a smile and nod with doctors because I was young and freaked out.  Fight for your health.

Klonopin made me not able to concentrate or remember anything which want the best when I would sometimes get anxiety studying for a big test. The Ativan had really been working, helps me get to sleep and helps work nausea without making me to loopy when I take it or to groggyin the morning. Both are less intense and habit forming than Xanax."
Fibromyalgia,31a1px,FlyBromineAlgae,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:43:11 2015 UTC,"Somewhere someone said something right I think. Also listen to the doctor at the bottom. For me, Xanax is the worst. .5-1mg and I forget 2 days. I was on clonazepam (klonopin) for a little over two years, that was the best for anxiety and sleep. I love Ativan, it's really quick acting and very short lived for me, it may be great for right before bed but as an every day occurance, forget it. The tolerance would build up way too fast for me. MMJ on the other hand, is not as stable as the klonopin for me. Sometimes it really really helps, it always helps with my bowel business and nausea, but sometimes it makes me twitchy and way too thought looped. I can't imagine using it during the day for activities, it's a lay down and hope for the best for me."
Fibromyalgia,31a1px,stormyfuck,2,Fri Apr 3 21:31:48 2015 UTC,"I smoke every night to help me sleep. MMJ is one of the only things that helps me sleep, fights my constant nausea, and quiets my anxious/sad brain. I get a lot of anxiety in the same way you do...I think too much about everything. MMJ is the only thing that makes me stop thinking so much. Its the only thing that makes me feel better with no side effects!  There are certain strains of marijuana that can definitely help induce sleep. I'm assuming you live in a state where its legal and will have multiple strains available. Marijuana is not chemically addictive but you can easily become dependent on it. I've been smoking several times a day for almost two years now and I definitely have a psychological addiction to it. If I can't smoke, I can't sleep or eat and it puts me in a bad mood. However, there is almost no harm that can come from trying it.  Since you've never smoked before, I would suggest trying it with a trusted friend around. If you smoke too much on the first time you can become very anxious and paranoid and it won't help you at all! Having someone there to talk you down and take care of you if that happens is vital. I think mostly any paranoia that comes from smoking comes from the illegality of it, but it can exacerbate your existing anxieties. Small hits with lots of time in between for the first time!  I hope this was helpful! Good luck! <3"

The cards have been available for the last year or so (though I think the program technically started in 2013), however they have yet to approve any dispensaries....either way that's a story for another day lol.  It is definitely something I am educating myself about at the moment.  I have just gotten to the point where I am willing to say that I need to start taking my medications more because they do help, but at the same time I hate taking them because once I start in with them regularly the negative side effects start outweighing the good that they do - for me at least."

If you have nausea it is incredibly useful to be able to take it without swallowing a pill. As far as I know, Zofran does not cause sedation and is not used to create illegal drugs, so I don't know what reason they could have. :/"
Fibromyalgia,319e73,meskarune,1 point,Fri Apr 3 18:32:11 2015 UTC,Actually it's very different. Sublingual gets absorbed much more rapidly right to the bloodstream instead of having to go through the digestive system. Sublingual is much different than just a tablet that dissolves in your mouth

Fibromyalgia,313hze,havinabadtime,1 point,Thu Apr 2 01:33:12 2015 UTC,Thank you! Does it help you to have the painful areas worked on or to just avoid those areas?
Fibromyalgia,313hze,FibroMan,3,Thu Apr 2 02:31:30 2015 UTC,"Massages help me so much.  My advice would be if the pressure makes you tense up it is too much pressure.  You will get the most benefit if you can relax your body as much as possible and let the therapist glide over the muscles with enough pressure to stimulate blood flow and gently work out knots without causing the muscles to tense because that defeats the purpose.  Drink a lot of water after too.  Pressure point helps me a lot but I have myositis and tendonitis too so I'm not sure if it helps those more or the fibro.  I get big knots in my arms, shoulders, hips and upper back.  They tense up so bad the muscles won't release and when the therapist holds the knot for a few seconds as she's working it mine tend to release faster than if she didn't.  It may not work for you it all depends on your type of pain and how sensitive you are I just wanted to throw out there what works for me in case it helps you find relief.  I hope the massage helps you a lot and you feel amazing after!  Best wishes!"

Fibromyalgia,313hze,Laur-Ent,2,Thu Apr 2 02:35:06 2015 UTC,"I like to have a warm shower just before getting a massage.  It helps the massage get through to the deeper muscles, because I find that the heat from the shower relaxes the muscles closer to the skin."
Fibromyalgia,313hze,Arose21,2,Sat Apr 4 11:53:00 2015 UTC,"With massages communication is essential. You should be able to ask for a deep tissue massage but also inform them where it hurts the most, and where to avoid. If the pressure is too much, tell them. They would rather know where to touch and how hard to keep you coming back and your body healthy, than not knowing.  I always ask that they end my sessions with a foot rub and a scalp massage because those relax me like no other.  Good luck Fibro family!"
Fibromyalgia,313hze,Laur-Ent,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:43:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I went on Saturday and drank a ton of water, and she was very gentle, but my muscles still reacted badly. I think maybe it's just a dysfunction with my body. Next time I'll just get a foot rub!"
Fibromyalgia,313hze,Laur-Ent,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:55:42 2015 UTC,"I've been helped a lot by massage and luckily I get them for free from a relative! She's really good at knowing the right pressure and understands that my body reacts differently to things. Any good massage therapist would WANT you to tell them to go more gentle or more firm, it helps them do their job. They also won't mind at all if you want them to avoid certain areas. Perhaps avoid deep tissue massage as that can be really sore and requires longer recovery time. If you have particular muscles that really need it though, it could help. Talk to the therapist about this and decide what's best at the time. If you have muscles that are always too tight (I get that in my back/shoulders) sometimes deep tissue massage is the only thing that will effectively loosen it up. Another option for these tight muscles is acupuncture, which is actually less traumatic for your muscles than deep tissue massage. The key is to keep communication up and let them know if you want it differently :)   SUPER IMPORTANT: Hopefully they would tell you this anyway, but it's important to drink lots of extra water right after a massage because during massage the muscles release toxins into the body and they can make you feel a bit sick. Drinking water will help to flush out these toxins.   Rest more than usual afterwards and avoid anything strenuous entirely. Take it real easy. A heavy massage (or even a light massage for someone with fibro) is enough to cause your body to need time to recover, as if it'd just been exercising or endured some kind of trauma. It's not really that bad of course but you would really benefit from allowing your body to properly recover afterwards.   TLDR it's totally fine to tell the therapist how heavy/light you want it. Perhaps talk to her about avoiding deep tissue massage as that can be pretty rough. Up to you. Drink lots of water afterwards and get extra rest."

If you get migraines on any type of semi regular basis, talk with them about that.  For me, it is constantly there in the background.  I liken it to being on a kids playground merry go round, with my head in the center and my feet on the end, being spun around continuously (actually doing this sucks with the vertigo don't do it.)  Driving increases it.  As the visual range diminishes (I can't think of the word I was looking for), it gets worse.  At around 50 yards, it gets intolerable and I can't drive.  My eyes lose focus and I'm nauseous by this point.  I tried driving through it a few times, each one resulted in a panic attack.  What does help?  Feverfew pills help.  You can grow them yourself if you have a green thumb.  Anything but the root can be used.  You can also use Butterbur.  Avoiding situations that cause it to increase if you can.  That isn't always an option though.  Go slow, keep the inside of the vehicle free of conversation and (for me) music helps.  I'm not sure why conversation (even if it isn't directed at you) acts differently than music does.  A note on it though, even if you have migraines under control, the vertigo most often will not respond to treatments that migraines do.  You can also have the active vertigo without migraine pain.

Fibromyalgia,30q151,gracefulwing,4,Sun Mar 29 23:37:12 2015 UTC,"Have you been sitting hunched forward much lately?  That's when I get this feeling and the shortness of breath, and I've confirmed wasn't heart issues too.  The first while it happened I had panic attacks, as I always have bad arm pain, so I felt that and then chest pain and shortness of breath.  Did my heart rate check by a clock to make sure I was fine and my heart was normal, just elevated in rate from panicking.    After this happening so many times,  I figured it out to be poor posture in the upper back in the area between the scapulae that caused pain the ribs culminating in the sternum.  The worst pain was in the sternum, and radiated out from there.  Opening up my chest by stretching my arms out to my sides, palms forward, while leaning back and slowly stretching the sternum and upper back helps, but correcting posture and not slouching or leaning forward, especially at a table, helps to reduce the instances of this.  Breathing fixes itself when the body doesn't feel the pain impeding it when expanding the cage during inhalation.  Beyond that, being in pain makes one breathe shortly and the situation you've described will only compound it.    There was a post in this sub in the last couple of weeks where others were describing this pain too, I'll see if I can link it in an edit.  Hope you can keep singing. :-)   Edit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibromyalgia/comments/2zvp0u/everything_is_crashing_down_all_at_once_a_rant/"
Fibromyalgia,30q151,Ialmostthewholepost,3,Sun Mar 29 22:02:15 2015 UTC,"I have this and it's related to my CFS/fibro. My physio (who is amazing and specializes in CFS) was the only one who could explain it for me. Turns out I was constantly doing lots of little shallow breaths instead of good deep breathing (from stomach/diaphragm but I'm sure you know that) and it was causing this chronic shortness of breath because I got in the habit. It would get so bad sometimes that my chest would hurt, I couldn't get a satisfying breath, I'd get dizzy, heart palpitations, and lots of other little problems. Too much shallow breathing causes an excess of CO2 in the body and it can have a negative effect on your whole system.   One way to tell if you've been breathing the wrong way for a long time is to lie flat on the floor and see if your bottom ribs stick up/poke out around your diaphragm. That means the muscles that you would use to breathe deeply are underused and deconditioned.   The thing that caused this for me was long term stress. Which is also what caused my CFS etc. Now I do breathing exercises where I practice proper deep breathing, keeping my shoulders down when I'm breathing, and I also just remind myself to keep breathing well when I catch myself reverting to my old habits again. It's a very slow process to change a habit like breathing! But it has made such a big difference to me and now I don't get those unpleasant problems like bad chest pain and extreme breathlessness.   Now I have no idea if this is what you're dealing with, but it sounds similar to me and that's what's going on with me. It'd be a good idea for your doctor to check you out for this and even refer you to a physio who is better equipped to deal with this. I had problems for years that my doctor didn't pick up on because it wasn't an obvious respiratory disease."

I would've chalked it up to anxiety, but I'm medicated and would have no stressors that brought it on. All I know to do when the episodes pop up is to lie down, feet up, breathe deeply, fan on/air circulating. I don't know if the last suggestion really helps, I think it's mostly comfort, since the symptom can be distressing and uncomfortable.   Anyway, it's just something worth checking out.

Either way, a tricyclic antidepressant such as amitriptyline might help with your sleep cycles and reduce your fibro symptoms.  Not sleeping properly is a bit of a fibro thing.  Make sure you taper off the Cymbalta slowly.  Obviously discuss with your doctor first.  Anything that is healthy for people in general will be good for you as a fibro sufferer too.  If you have any other medical issues or injuries then make sure you deal with them.  I had low vitamin D levels, but increasing my vitamin D made no difference whatsoever to my symptoms.  For other people taking vitamin D supplements has made a huge difference.  The moral of the story is that what works for some people doesn't work for others.  Trial and error is the best approach.

But perhaps your body would be better suited for it? I wouldn't suggest going completely off medication before you've tried other things.  That being said, there is a lot of merit to alternative remedies (in my opinion). I think the best treatment is a mix of meds, diet, exercise, and support.

Fibromyalgia,30l85e,FibroMan,13,Sat Mar 28 10:48:01 2015 UTC,"Opiates are really only effective in the short term. This is due to dependence and that the tolerance causes you to keep needing more and stronger to work. There are also studies that show the painkillers after a while can start to trick your body into feeling more pain, causing you to want even more."
Fibromyalgia,30l85e,surrogateuterus,9,Sat Mar 28 12:18:44 2015 UTC,"As a pharmacist who has fibro herself, I can say that this is the correct answer. I have seen so many fellow fibro sufferers struggle with dose after dose increase only to continue to struggle with pain. Opiates are terrible for our type of pain. I only wish there was a treatment that worked for all of us. It's just a trial and error to find what works. I don't judge fellow pain sufferers who resort to opiates but I highly discourage starting down the long road."

I have actually been researching this as my home state has medical marijuana on the ballet this year.  The one thing I can tell you is that Marinol will be useless for you and studies have shown some effectiveness for chronic  pain with the actual marijuana.

Fibromyalgia,30l85e,surrogateuterus,2,Tue Mar 31 10:58:09 2015 UTC,"Opiates are really only effective in the short term.   I wonder how long ""short term"" is.  I have been taking codeine or tramadol for over a year now.  The codeine stopped working after about 10 months but tramadol still works.  The year of being functional that I have gained has enabled me to make some of the big life style changes that I have needed to make.  I am now in a position where if I needed to come off opioids I could.  I guess the next question is whether I should come off tramadol now, or whether I should stay on it until it stops working."
Fibromyalgia,30l85e,mundabit,2,Sun Mar 29 05:59:55 2015 UTC,"For me personally, it seemed about a year. My cousin got about two good years in of use before having the issues I mentioned. My stepmom has been going for about 5 years constantly increasing and at this point I'm not sure theres much more she can do to 'increase'.   I actually dont know a lot about tramadol. But the themes of addiction and long term treatments should be brought up to your dr. I'd suggest having a chat next time you meet about the projected course of treatment. There are a lot of options out there, some work better than others for certain people.   For me, it was an overhaul of my life and stress management that helped the most....coupled with knowing my limits. I assume thats going to be just putting off the inevitable, but I'm only thirty, my goal is to go as long as possible without daily medication."

Fibromyalgia,30l85e,peanutgallerie,4,Sun Mar 29 15:21:28 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know. If they work at reducing your pain and they are not damaging your renal system or liver, I see no reason why opiods can't be introduced into a Fibromites pain management plan. As long as someone is able to recognise the use of opiods for pain management vs an unhealthy or abusive relationship with opiods, they should be able to use them.  Personally, Opioids don't work for my fibro pain, so I don't use them. There is no point for me to put them in my body. With that said, I have started self medicating with cannibis (which is illegal in my country) and it has worked wonders for my pain and my gastrointestinal function. It's for this reason that I am passionate about chronic pain patient's having safe and legal access to the therapies and pharmaceuticals that reduce their pain. Within reason, I'm not asking for permission to be high all the time, Just like opioids users aren't asking for permission to abuse their medications,"
Fibromyalgia,30l85e,autowikibot,7,Mon Mar 30 06:32:12 2015 UTC,"Taking them every day is not a good idea. I tale them on my bad days, and they work fine. I habe been doing so for abou 2 years now and I have not built up resistance, nor am I hooked on them. As for the being impaired stuff, well, when I am in enough pain to need one of them, I am much more impaired than I am after taking one of these.  So as a drug to cut through the wost pain it is just fine, as long as that is not every day."
Fibromyalgia,30l85e,Gr33n_Rider,3,Sat Mar 28 14:58:48 2015 UTC,"Opiod induced hyperalgesia.  I took opiods for around 5 years. They made my pain better. The whole time I was taking them they made my pain better. But there is the downside of hyperalgesia. This is different than becoming dependent or having an addiction.   I took the same amount of the drug for 5 years once my doctor and I dialed in on what fixed the pain. For most of that time it was ok. I was definitely dependent. If I went to long without my medicine I would get antsy, gittery, have pain,  etc. Drug withdrawal symptoms. It sucked but honestly I still found it worth it for the pain relief.  In the last year I developed hyperalgesia. When my medicine was starting to wear off even before any type of dependency reaction would kick in I would have enormous amounts of pain. At first I thought my fibro had just gotten so much worse. This scared me. But thinking about it that really made no sense. I did research and found this. My doctor did not mention this it ever. Just dependency and possible abuse by some people. The hyperalgesia happens when the opoid magnifies your pain. My normal pain would be a 4 average when starting. After the hyperalgesia my pain was at an 8 when not on medication. I decided this was not worth it. I weaned myself off over a month or so. It was pretty awful at times but once I started cutting down my exaggerated pain really left also.  Now that I am off opoids I can take them again when needed for serious things and don't have this reaction to them.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid-induced_hyperalgesia"
Fibromyalgia,30l85e,peanutgallerie,3,Mon Mar 30 19:24:56 2015 UTC,"Opioid-induced hyperalgesia:       Opioid-induced hyperalgesia  or opioid-induced abnormal pain sensitivity,  also called paradoxical hyperalgesia  is a phenomenon associated with the long term use of opioids such as morphine [citation needed], hydrocodone [citation needed], oxycodone [citation needed], and methadone [citation needed]. Over time, individuals taking opioids can develop an increasing sensitivity to noxious stimuli, even evolving a painful response to previously non-noxious stimuli (allodynia) [citation needed]. Some studies on animals have also demonstrated this effect occurring after only a single high dose of opioids.

Fibromyalgia,30l85e,Gr33n_Rider,3,Fri Apr 3 14:24:21 2015 UTC,"I tried to prepare the best I could. I am sure the process will be different with each person. I did just look up tramadol to make sure it can cause hyperalgesia because it is not an opiate. Apparently there are some findings it can.   I suggest you work with your doctor on the best way to wean off. Talk to them about your reasons. They should be supportive. If not they may not be the best doctor for you anyway! :)  What I did was start stretching out the dosage. For me I was prescribed 1 pill every six hours. I started taking half a pill every 6 hours. Then every 8 etc. I did this over a month. To get off totally I took a couple of days off work and told my family I would just be out of pocket. I wanted to be able to just lay in bed and be miserable, just in case I needed to be.  The first part and the last part for me was the hardest. I was in more pain and I did have anxiety and opiate withdrawal symptoms. But it did not last as long as I expected. I was glad to be off work but I did not have to lay in bed miserable. I took ibuprofen and did things to enjoy myself. Walks, a yoga session etc. It was a short big of suckage to get through to the other side. But as people with fibro we are used to taking our bouts of suckage. Hang in there."

I am reading something that says that Tramadol also acts as an SSRI, which could account for your mood swings.  Maybe you could try taking an SSRI when you reduce your Tramadol dose to balance out your mood?  Edit to add: see page 13 of http://my.clevelandclinic.org/ccf/media/files/rheumatology_immunology/long-term-evaluation-of-opioid-therapy-in-fms.pdf for a reference to Tramadol being an SSRI."

Fibromyalgia,30l85e,Cyrridven,3,Thu Apr 9 00:12:37 2015 UTC,"For me, it's because of the risk of dependence/addiction.  I took them for a while, but did not trust myself to continue taking them.  My sister, when she was in rehab for alcohol, said she met several people with fibro who had developed opiate addiction.  We just have enough problems as it is without something like that.  That's my reason, anyway."
Fibromyalgia,30l85e,kiwiburd,3,Sat Mar 28 13:17:08 2015 UTC,The risk of addiction is high with opioids. Very high.

Fibromyalgia,30l85e,lannalove,3,Sun Mar 29 06:26:43 2015 UTC,"I've taken tramadol every day for almost 7 years. I wasn't warned properly of the addiction / withdrawal side of things so learnt the hard way. I managed to taper myself down from 100mg 4 times a day, to 100mg 2 times a day but any less than that (or even taken later than when I usually take them / not on schedule) and I begin the withdrawal symptoms (which are really really awful). Anything we're prescribed is mostly for long term use and opiates are horrible drugs. I wouldn't have begun taking them had I know, but I was only 19 and doing as directed by my consultant. Now at almost 26 I feel like I know much better. I don't even know what my pain levels would be without tramadol anymore because the withdrawal is so so bad that I daren't try. I don't think you can assess pain levels well if you have a dependence on these drugs therefore assessing your condition and how bad it is is never going to truly be correct. I wonder what id be like without the tramadol. Would I be worse? Better even? The same? I haven't ever felt the need to take more than the dosage I'm on now. My addiction is purely physical and I take the amount I need to function as normally as possible.   If you take them only when needed, my comment is redundant. I just always feel like I should warn people of opiates because I never was warned.   I guess what I'm trying to say is they're bad for long term use - which is what most of fibromyalgia treatment is about, but if every now and again you need them for a super bad pain day, that I can truly understand."
Fibromyalgia,30l85e,jessimokajoe,1 point,Sat Mar 28 19:57:23 2015 UTC,I have a few questions if you don't mind me asking:   For how long did Tramadol work well for you? What made you realize that you had a problem with Tramadol? What are the really nasty withdrawal symptoms?
Fibromyalgia,30l85e,surrogateuterus,2,Sun Mar 29 07:41:50 2015 UTC,"I don't mind at all. I don't feel like I have anything to be ashamed of for feeling dependent on tramadol. It just kinda, happened.   I'd say for about a year, year and a half I actually felt like a relatively 'normal' person. I was functioning way way better than I do now and the last couple of years. After about a year and a half I was also prescribed pregabalin and I think that too helped for about a year.   I was reducing my tramadol down because I wasn't sure it was working anymore. I managed to reduce down to my dosage now (100mg twice a day) but when I got any lower than that I went into pretty severe withdrawal. I hadn't realised my bodies dependency until this time because I hadn't known any different having not tried to reduce it prior to this. I've never been told my medical people to reduce / come off tramadol and having mentioned that I couldn't seem to reduce any lower was just told to continue with this dosage. It has never been mentioned since.   The withdrawal is really hard to explain because nothing I can say will really put you in my shoes when experiencing it.   I get temperatures, hallucinations, hot and cold sweats, aches that don't die down all over my body. Deliriousness, excessive sweating, feelings of extreme upset.  This kicks in literally an hour or so after I've not had my normal dosage (even if I'm an hour late I begin to feel the effects). I'm very strict with times that I take my medication. Every 12 hours.   I do want to come off tramadol as like I say, I don't think I can get a real picture of my health without being painkiller free. I'm intending on discussing this with my GP and arranging a stay with my parents so I don't have to look after myself whilst I'm going through the withdrawal.   I've never taken or wanted to take, more than my dosage. This is 100% a physical and not mental addiction - which is probably why I don't feel ashamed or embarrassed. This thing happened to me, such is life!"
Fibromyalgia,30l85e,jessimokajoe,1 point,Fri Apr 3 11:10:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks ebb.  Luckily I don't think I am dependent at the moment.  I missed a dose last week in the morning.  I had a rougher day than usual, but I didn't realize I had missed a pill until the afternoon.  The withdrawal symptoms sound pretty severe.  It has been worth the risk for me so far, because I have needed to look after my daughter full time.  When she is at kindy 4 days per week I will try cutting down my Tramadol intake.  I don't feel like I need it just for my benefit."
Fibromyalgia,30l85e,lannalove,3,Sat Apr 4 12:05:09 2015 UTC,"I do worry extremely about tolerance and dependency but cannot seem to find a balance in life (which is tentative at best) without.   I want to feel semi-human and semi-functional...sorry to sound morbid, but without them my life would be worth living less BUT I know this is not the same for everyone.   My ultimate dream is to be off them all and achieve an optimal level of physical health for a spoonie :) I see that as a journey though, rather than something instantaneous.

Fibromyalgia,30l85e,Merkinfumble,2,Sun Mar 29 00:05:37 2015 UTC,"i think therapy should always be individualized for any patient. especially for something as complex as fibromyalgia that can present across many different organ systems. just as your symptoms may be different so may your pain system. some people will experience more pain from pain receptors becoming for sensitive/pain receptors upregulating. however, opioids can help tremendously in some patients.  since they are now C-II prescriptions it seems like a lot of doctors are hesitant to write for these. and pharmacies are more vigilant about who they are filling these narcotics for.  tolerance is very common in pain medications but it's not a steep slope for all.  i've been on hydrocodone/acetamiophen 5/325 for almost two years and it's the only thing that touches my pain. and i haven't progressed to anything stronger or increased the dose. i still take half a tablet, which is 2.5 mg of hydrocodone.  if your doctor is not going to help you manage your pain you should find one that will, but in a conservative and safe manner. pain management is a huge factor in quality of life.  tramadol works similarly to hydrocodone. whenever i tried it i would get terrible flushing and heart palpitations. then i would sweat a lot and get a headache. plus it didn't help my pain."
Fibromyalgia,30l85e,Chilly73,2,Fri Apr 17 00:03:03 2015 UTC,I don't understand it either. I don't wanna go on antidepressants or stay on Lyrica/neurontin/etc... especially with the latest research of them.   I think it has to do with the kidneys/liver though. Too much pressure on them.

Then my doctor wanted me to come off them and put me on tramadol instead, because of the hangover effect and also for fear of becoming dependent (impossible really as I only ever got 10 tablets at a time).  A couple of years later and the tramadol is not cutting it at the moment, I am in a very bad pain flare.  My doctor put me back on oxy and I have to say, I had the best night ever.  I only took a small dose but it was the first pain free break that I had had in MONTHS.  I went to bed early so happy that I could lie there content and relaxed.  I only had to take one tablet, it must have broken a cycle of pain for me and it hasn't been as severe since.  I think there is a definite place for opioids if they are used sparingly.

My shoulders constantly are super sensitive, and I'm hoping that my GP will be able to help. My rheumatologist doesn't treat fibro (he'll diagnose, but won't treat?), and the pain clinic doc is afraid to give me anything beside the Tramadol, because I'm on Coumadin(I had a serious blood clot over 2 years ago, and nearly died.)"

Fibromyalgia,30l85e,ChandraCorby,5,Fri Apr 3 02:44:49 2015 UTC,"In the US it's addiction and drug abuse. The feds are trying to limit the use of these drugs because of the great potential for abuse. Which sucks for people who are actually in pain. I have noticed it's a little harder to get drugs for my migraines and kidney stones, even though a bottle of 10 pills will last me a year or two.  Opioids actually work very well for fibromites. You need to build up a tolerance because the side effects are unpleasant, and some of them don't go away. A friend was on vicodin for a leg injury for many many months and he was constipated the whole time. There's also the question of being impaired while taking them, at least until your tolerance builds up. And then there's the problem of physical addiction, what happens if you run out of pills unexpectedly? (House fire, flood, lost or stolen.) You're going to have a bad time. Of course this is true of a lot of drugs, you can't cold turkey them without really bad effects."

However, I understand that 450mg is very high. :( You have to wean yourself off slowly. I accidentally skipped a day of my 150mg and felt AWFUL. Don't try to do this yourself. Are you taking 3 150 mg pills? At the very least, speak to your pharmacist and let them know you want to wean yourself off but your doctor is not letting you."
Fibromyalgia,30jbpv,lbsmith5,3,Sat Mar 28 01:38:47 2015 UTC,"The only advice I can give is try to taper down. You'll need a good week or so to get over the withdrawal (even with tapering). I got myself down to 75mg twice a day but can't reduce it further than that (well, I'm not really trying because I'm in the UK so I'm lucky with prescriptions here). Everything I've read is about 4/5 days of withdrawal and then you'll start to improve. If you live alone have a friend come over to keep an eye on you / make you food / bring you drinks - that'll take a massive weight off and you can just try and sleep as much as possible (although I know how awfully hard that is with withdrawal going on). There's really no 'easy' way to do this I don't think. Good luck though - there was someone posting here recently who'd come off tramadol I believe and that's a super bitch (worst withdrawal of anything I've ever taken), my point is there are people here who understand and can help as much as possible."

With the lyrica, I stepped down over the course of 10 days and only had 1 really bad day that I had to take off work.  The cymbalta withdrawal was way worse so I definitely recommend tapering as long as you can. When going through the worst of the withdrawal, I bought liver detox pills from amazon and took lots of baths in epsom salts.  I was trying to draw the medicine out of my body as quickly as possible.  What really helped was taking benadryl.  I have no idea why but I came across the suggestion and tried it.  I only took the recommended dose as often as I could and I credit it for lessening the withdrawal symptoms and shortening the duration.

I'm thinking I will do 75mg every two days after that and see how it goes from there.  It seems to be working out pretty well for me.  Good luck!"
Fibromyalgia,30jbpv,MCRAGEQUIT,1 point,Sat Mar 28 04:46:24 2015 UTC,"I quit Lyrica when I could no longer deal with the side effects, and it was hellish.  I spent 2 months tapering down and still had all kinds of issues for weeks afterwards.  I don't regret being on it, but I'm sure glad to be off it!  I'm in Canada, and up here here is a generic available that is much, much cheaper.  I don't know it's availability outside of Canada tho."
Fibromyalgia,30jbpv,Maeven2,1 point,Sat Mar 28 09:06:26 2015 UTC,"Taper off over a week or more, consider switching to gabapentin which is similar and generic. Then taper of the gabapentin."

Fibromyalgia,30i4a2,BradburySauce,4,Fri Mar 27 16:00:22 2015 UTC,"I fall ALL the time because I'm a klutz. Prescription medicated cream helps with the muscle soreness on top of daily medication, a few hot baths per day to sooth the muscles and lots of rest and nothing strenuous until I recover. Takes me a few days and then I'm ready to fall all over again should it happen. Sometimes it'll send me into a flare up if it's bad enough, but I'm usually still good to go a few days later. But that's now. Before I was diagnosed and properly medicated it would take me weeks to recover.  Just take it easy! Your body is different than mine and everyone else's, you need to do what works for you! What works for me may not work for someone else. That's the thing with fibro, everyone is different. I think it depends on your body type along with your state of mind as well as how far along you are with recovery. Nobody knows for sure, though. Good luck!"

Fibromyalgia,30g7lk,Merkinfumble,3,Fri Mar 27 02:37:33 2015 UTC,That's just indicative of an autoimmune process going on. I've had elevated ANAs independent of anything else. Mine fluctuate frequently. If this is the first time you've had an elevated one I'd look into having it retested in 3 months to see if it's actually elevated.

Fibromyalgia,30g7lk,AbnormallyLargeFUPA,3,Fri Mar 27 10:44:40 2015 UTC,"ANA is related to autoimmune disorders, often Lupus. I also have a high ANA count and my rheumetologist said it was most likely because I also have Hasimoto's Thyroiditis, a disease where my body attacks my thyroid for NO FREAKING REASON, but he is also watching for any signs and symtoms of lupus to pop up. He said it could take 10 years or even more to actually know for sure if I have lupus as well as or instead of fibromyalgia. Gotta love that wait!  EDIT: I don't mean to scare you or say IT'S ALWAYS LUPUS when you have an elevated ANA, it's just a common diagnosis that comes some time after you have a positive ANA panel, have a lot of the same symptoms of fibro, AND then do a bunch of other tests and questions."

I'm more than a bit irate over this, considering weed has, so far, been the only thing to effectively help me. Gabapentin turns you into a zombie, and you can only take so many pain pills before you start to worry for your liver. Marijuana took my pain away, cleared my fog, and helped with the nausea caused by the pain.  The only negative side effect I've had is the times where I misjudged tolerance. Even then, all that resulted was a nice nap.   It's honestly to the point that I want to move to a state where it's legal. I've had three of my doctors tell me that they believe in the medical basis of it helping, and that if it's beneficial to me, I should pursue it.

I've read a lot of articles about how it helps with fibro.  I have myositis and tendonitis too.  It would be amazing to have actual relief.  If it is approved in Georgia for some conditions it may help expedite the process of others being approved.  That's my hope right now at least.
Fibromyalgia,3094vb,Ialmostthewholepost,3,Thu Mar 26 01:24:39 2015 UTC,"I use it daily, in oral and vaporized form.  I went through the gamut of medications over the last 10 years, but cannabis has been the only useful one.  While I was unable to work before and still am unable to now, I'm at least being a husband again.  I was...  gone for a few years mentally just from the amount of pain I was in physically and the depression I had barely beaten back over my life almost called to a head.    I have found oral cannabis to be extremely useful for reducing IBS and related pain, neurological pain, eases joint pain, reduces skin sensitivity, calms my depression and anxiety (high THC, high CBD edibles are amazing for me for that), and helps me actually sleep for the first time in my life.  Vaporized cannabis I use for reducing peak pain and more immediate needs.  I use higher CBD strains before bed to help make me sleepy, and higher THC ones when I need to be more mentally alert.  I find THC to help reduce fibro fog, increase cognition and my ability to speak clearly without fishing for words like I normally do, and it can provide marked reduction in attention to the pain.  I vaporize about 2g daily, centered around household activities like dishes, cooking, cleaning.  I use a portable vaporizer to allow me to go for walks and have increased my ability to walk from 300m on a good day 5 years ago to 10.6km on Monday just last week.  Sure, I did nothing else that day, was wiped and I overdid it, but it was amazing.  I had set the goal of that walk 18 months before and slowly proceeded to kick its ass.    However, the biggest help to me has been with my constant migraines.  I have had a constant migraine with persistent aura for 3/4 weeks of every month for the last 8 or so years.  It took me the last 4 years to figure out the best regimen for reducing migraine with a lot of trial and error.  I found smoking hash worked.... For 15 to 30 minutes maybe.  And that was expensive.  Bud helped but I couldn't smoke fast enough.  Edibles didn't have enough punch usually, or it would take a lot.  Vaporizing regularly helped but didn't do it for long enough and i would still have to constantly vape.  Then I met a guy who grows his own plants and make very potent infused coconut oil from a high CBD  high THC strain called Deep Purple.  3tsp of that oil a day in my coffee and I severely reduced the pain I get.  Now I get maybe 1 day out of 7 that is bad, and it's at a level then that I can usually vape it down enough that I can take care of my wife and dogs so that she can in turn take care of us.  I've been on this oil since September or so and I've been the most active I've been in years.  It'll be interesting to see how I fare through the summer on it as that's usually my bad season for migraine.  His oil is better than anything I've had from a dispensary.  I haven't had negative experiences with pot, I've never used it recreationally, and have seen benefits to my asthma and yearly bouts of bronchitis->lung infection->clinical double pneumonia.  Turns out after researching it, cannabis is a decently potent bronchial dilator and an expectorant - it helps open up the airways and to remove sputum from lungs.  I haven't had pneumonia since started, and haven't had bronchitis or a lung infection since I started vaping.  Things I'm prone to and have long standing history of.  I could bubble on forever.  I have a life now because of it and my wife and I have never been closer because it's taken my pain down to a point where I can think clearly again... Most of the time.  I still get angsty, I'm still the same guy, but I'm a better husband with it than without it.  My wife vouches for that and insists I stay on it.  :-)"
Fibromyalgia,3094vb,VincentKyle,4,Thu Mar 26 04:06:46 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately the thinking is likely due to the fact that many still believe fibro isn't real (as there is no distinct diagnosis or test), and those who may think it is are too mired in the fear that prescription drug addicts use the condition to score meds.  This will only change as we become less stupid as a nation about a great many things, so unforuntately I wouldn't hold my breath."

She was pretty well horrified.  She specifically responded ""and you smiled at me and everything, I had no idea.""  That is my typical response though.  Its much easier than to go into what is going on."

I opened up to her last night about how bad I felt from the riding after we got home.  She asked if we should have stopped more.  (no.  It wouldn't have helped really.  I hurt 5 minutes in.  Can't stop every five minutes.). Then she says it's because I sat with my legs curled under me.  I tried to explain that many times its the only way I CAN sit and not be in agony.  That sitting properly feels like I'm in a medieval torture device.  Even though I'm newly diagnosed, its always been that way for me.  Its my normal.  I know her heart is in the right place, but just doesn't get it.  She thinks I need a massage and vitamins. :(  I told my boss today.

So, I say 'not bad, how was yours?'  It changes the focus back to them and off me.  My husband is away for a few days and I've been in a bad flare for weeks now.

He deals with my misery enough without having to be reminded of it when he is away, that's my theory anyway.  Pretending to be okay is so damn exhausting.

Fibromyalgia,3013yd,jessicamercado,6,Mon Mar 23 17:11:36 2015 UTC,"Have you started a focused plan to recognize and manage flare-ups? The first step to dealing with flares is understanding the signs that you are over doing it. Slow yo' roll gurl.  Medicine not working, try a new one. You don't have to keep taking shitty meds that give you no relief. Try something new and thoroughly educate yourself on long term issues with every medicine you are considering.  It's okay to have no pants day. Long term, when you buy clothes buy soft, light weight fabrics and start looking at the seams to make sure there are no scratchy edges.   Get counseling for your anxiety so you can get to the root and develop coping skills. You are still young so you are still going to encounter a lot of situations that you are going to have no idea how to cope with. This is okay and normal. I assure, many people are freaking out inside all the time.   Parents and friends lacking understanding. Explain to them that fibro is nerve damage except it's all over the body and there is no cure for it. Most people will leave you alone after that."

Fibromyalgia,3013yd,Le_Squish,2,Tue Mar 24 02:31:35 2015 UTC,Some of your pain will be managed better with holistic methods some pain will need something stronger. It is very important to get a good doctor that believes you and is willing to let you try new treatments. You have to be a good patient and describe in detail your pain because doctors can't really work with just saying you hurt every where. Prioritize the body part that gives you the most discomfort and work on that. Also take in account the season when scheduling your schooling. You may find it difficult to function in the winter and may want to have less demanding classes then.

Perhaps a low-impact type of yoga/stretching as well. I know for me, small amounts of exercise do help, just nothing high impact, and I can't overdo it (once or twice a week at most is my personal limit).  I know a lot of people with fibro who also take medicine for the accompanying anxiety/depression that goes with the illness. You might want to look into that as well, if you need help with the coping aspect of it all.   I wish you luck, it isn't an easy illness to deal with, especially with all the aspect of ""this might work, but maybe not"" that we have to deal with in terms of treatment."

Fibromyalgia,3013yd,Sorrybuttotallywrong,2,Tue Mar 24 02:29:02 2015 UTC,If the meds aren't working you need to talk to your doctor. See if hot baths will help. Do some research and begin a journal chronicalling what you are trying and how you are on a day by day basis. Also make sure your doctor really wants to help or is just going through the motions. Most important thing we need is a good doctor willing to try new ideas for us.   I also suggest you try and sit down with your boyfriend and your parents. Have them read about fibromyalgia. Explain how your pain is. Show them posts from here about people who are in the same situation as you.

Answer: Sometimes. IBS is common in people with fibromyalgia as well as general inflammation and gut issues. It can also be about a million other things. I am a huge proponent of not just lumping everything into fibro. Thats just dangerous. Keep an eye on it and see how you feel. I personally have a lot of gut issues and food sensitivities. I had to monitor things very carefully and worked with doctors to figure it out. Some people don't have anything like this.  You want to see if you have fibro (from your doctors recommendation) by possibly going on antidepressants? Answer: In no universe are antidepressants a diagnostic tool for determining if you have fibro. That will tell you nothing. What other testing has your GP done for you? There are diagnostic criteria in place, I don't know the details for the UK but doing a quick Google they seem to be very similar to here in the US.    You really first what to be diagnosed with something and THEN start a treatment. I have never heard of a doctor saying ""you may have cancer lets test that with chemo"". Fibromyalgia is a diagnosis of exclusion in many cases. They should be doing full blood workups and other things to rule out other problems. Once that is done other things are ruled out you can then look at your symptoms and if they match the criteria for fibro move on with treatments. One treatment is antidepressants since they seem to help for some people. You need to understand they work partially for some people. The percentage is actually not that big.   I would advise you to educate yourself more on this condition and be wary of any physician who wants to automatically stick you on antidepressants. Sounds like they may have an ulterior motive."

Fibromyalgia,3020d6,peanutgallerie,1 point,Tue Mar 24 00:39:13 2015 UTC,I did a quick search and pulled up the link below (I hope links are OK here) from the NHS. It looks like in the UK GPs should be able to diagnose or at least perform some exclusion testing to determine if you have fibro. If I were you I would read through all of this information on what tests you should have and what conditions you need to rule out. Have the doctor run those tests. They should at the minimum run blood work. If they refuse to do these things or continue to not take you seriously change doctors. Good luck.  http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Fibromyalgia/Pages/Diagnosis.aspx
Fibromyalgia,3020d6,peanutgallerie,1 point,Tue Mar 24 16:44:32 2015 UTC,"She did run blood work. Everything which was normal. Then she applied pressure on my shoulders and asked me something, I can't remember now! And then she suggested I take a course of the anti depressants to see if it helps. I just don't wanna take the anti depressants. On the link you sent me (thank you btw) it says they should rule out MS and chronic fatigue syndrome. CFS doesn't have a test so it's hard to rule out but shall I ask to be tested for MS? is there anything else you can suggest I should rule out?"
Fibromyalgia,3020d6,BradburySauce,1 point,Wed Mar 25 08:21:14 2015 UTC,"Did she go over the blood work with you? What did she run? Do you know what  your vitamin D is? How about a thyroid test? Inflammatory response markers? The devil is in the details so to speak. Blood tests can be a few things or many things.   I am not sure on the shoulders? Maybe a tender point test if she pressed in other places.   There are probably dozens of things to rule out before fibro. MS is usually diagnosed with an MRI. CFS is exclusionary as well. Possibly Lupus? I don't know your exact symptoms. Since fibro is so varied it can mimic many things. Even something like arthritis.   Did she say why specifically she wanted to put you on anti depressants? Did she state which one? It is true that anti depressants can minimize pain for some people. It is also true that many doctors think people with fibromyalgia are just bad copers and are depressed. It is important to know which train of thought she is on. On the flip side you could be depressed. If you are, thats important to address. But its not fibro.  Over the long years I have been working with different doctors I have found the best thing to do is be educated on what you are concerned about. Whether it be fibro, cancer, antibiotics etc. Be your own advocate. This way you can discuss things with your doctor instead of just being passive and accepting everything. Be polite. Ask for details. Your blood work for example. Its not uncalled for to ask her to go over everything with you instead of just saying ""its normal"". You can also ask why they had it tested and what does this mean. We are paying physicians for a service after all.   It sounds like you either have to go back and ask more questions or get a copy of your blood work at least to start with."

Fibromyalgia,3020d6,jensicle1,1 point,Tue Mar 24 01:11:06 2015 UTC,"Nausea is not a typical symptom of fibromyalgia, so I think you need to investigate it separately.  Anti-depressants can help alleviate widespread aches and pains, whether it is caused by fibro or something else.  I had tried a few antidepressants and Lyrica months before I had a fibro diagnosis.  If I was in your position, which I was, I would try the antidepressants.  If I had my time again, I would skip the SSRI's and go straight to Lyrica, but everyone is different so you need to try each drug for yourself.  Everything has side effects so you need to weigh up the side effects vs the benefits.  Nothing will make you feel perfect, but some things will help.  Good luck."

Fibromyalgia,3020d6,hydrogenbound,1 point,Wed Mar 25 08:21:59 2015 UTC,"Hi there, I'm from the UK too...  I get extreme nausea because of the pain I get from the fibromyalgia, particularly the pain that eminaties from the neck/shoulders. I can be physically sick from pain some days.   Were you officially diagnosed with fibro? Were all pressure points tested and were you offered an MRI? Do you feel it's the pain causing the nausea or something separate?  I understand your resistance to taking a new drug when it sounds like you don't exactly have clear answers just yet..."
Fibromyalgia,3020d6,hydrogenbound,1 point,Sat Mar 28 22:54:02 2015 UTC,My dr suggested I have fibromyalgia and she didn't do a pressure point tests (from what I've heard how it's supposed to be) she applied pressure on my shoulders and asked me questions about swelling etc. and she wanted to see if the anti depressants would help. I feel as tho it's my fault because I was so relieved that she believed me that I accepted the medication. But I just haven't taken it yet. I wasn't offered an MRI
Fibromyalgia,2zwkxr,justatadtoosmall,2,Sun Mar 22 14:19:55 2015 UTC,I would be really interested in your coping techniques. I feel like I've been in a 2 month flare and need some help.
Fibromyalgia,2zwkxr,hydrogenbound,5,Sun Mar 22 16:56:25 2015 UTC,"The long stints are the worst! Sorry about your hard time lately! I've found it most helpful to take up a mixed form of meditation, breathing and stretching (it hurts so good, if you put your all into it). Mine are yoga-derived deep breathing techniques in which you ""push"" all the air you can as far through your body as you stretch the part that is aching and hold the position as long as you can handle it. The longer the better. I feel that the downward dog position is optimal, even if you have to assume a modified position until you've limbered up a little. In the morning I spend 10 minutes stretching as soon as my feet hit the floor (takes alot of motivation some days) and if I catch myself thinking ""damn my (whatever) is achy"", I'll try to stretch it out then (the sooner the better, because once I -notice- it I start to fixate on it. I've stopped being concerned with what people think of it, because when it comes down to it, your well being is far more important than a weird glare. I reserve at least an hour of each week to truly relax (I find a comfy spot, no matter how weird the position, and just relax your body as much as possible). Sometimes a hot bath is sometimes the only thing keeping me from wanting to blow up city blocks too. For those REALLY bad days, try some pressure point techniques! Essentially, find your happy place and learn how to stretch your boundaries (pun intended, haha). I hope this does you some good!!"
Fibromyalgia,2zwkxr,hydrogenbound,1 point,Sun Mar 22 18:00:53 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice I will give it a try! I have really bad joint pain so yoga is a challenge but I'm willing to try anything!

I was diagnosed in 1999 and am only now trying to come to terms with it. I need all the help I can get. :)
Fibromyalgia,2zwp1m,nicole46,1 point,Sun Mar 22 15:03:50 2015 UTC,It could be. The biggest problem is that there seems to be no consistent cause to fibro. The three causes seem to be  1) environmental 2) physical  3) mental  Also people with either another medical issue (known or unknown) is typical of people with fibro.   Family genetics might play a part. My aunt has fibro.   You should see what each of you has in common. Are you also all seeing the same doctor or do your doctors know one another? It would be good to keep track of this.
Fibromyalgia,2zwp1m,Sorrybuttotallywrong,1 point,Mon Mar 23 22:22:19 2015 UTC,"mine all started after I got an illness, that seemed to spark something inside of me and then I had symptoms ever since. The illness sparked up Hypermobility, which then suddenly caused me pain, and somewhere along the line it started Fibro. I don't know if that might help shed some light on what any of your friends have, or been through."
Fibromyalgia,2zwp1m,crazysheep86,2,Thu Mar 26 09:03:02 2015 UTC,For me I took off time during a holiday to spend time with the kids. Was walking through Manhattan and severely sprained my ankle (have had flat feet issues/ankle problems since puberty). Didn't think anyo thing of it. A few days pass and I still couldn't walk on it. Pain slowly spread and she send me to a neurologist she knew and respected. A couple of months later due to testing that eliminated other conditions he diagnosed me with fibro. Also a nerve biopsy showed small nerve damage in my legs.   Pain got worse and wanted to try pain meds because the regular fibro meds didn't work except for Savella. Savella knocked out my pain; but the price was to make me psychotic and got to the point where I was nearing severe volcano axe murderor rage. Wife hid the pills and went back to normal within a day. I still remember that time because I was pain free.   So too Percocet which helped but soon after lost my health insurance. I got off of them; and just sucked it up but could barely do anything due to the pain.   Fast forward a year. Pain is getting worse. Had to appeal social security disability rejection. Saw a pain management dr and he tried me on Percocet and this time didn't work. Made no sense. He upped me some and still doing nothing. Urine isn't showing anything. Had a huge fight with him and he finally gave me a chance and did a blood work up showing up but at lower levels than norm. Finally shows in urine and keeps incressed but the meds never really work. Something happened to my body between my last pain doc and my new one and can't figure it out. So far all testing shows normal.

New onset anything always needs to be seen by a doc."
Fibromyalgia,2zw0bw,creepygothnursie,1 point,Sun Mar 22 14:42:33 2015 UTC,"It is most definitely new. I did read that dropping things was possibly a connection to fibro, but nothing too obvious or informative came up so I posted here to see if it was a normal symptom. It seems like hands just opening up and letting go of things unexpectedly isn't uncommon among fibro patients. But entire limbs going limp and floppy (while still holding grasp half of the time) doesn't seem normal. ESPECIALLY as an out of the blue thing that doesn't coincide with other symptom flares."
Fibromyalgia,2zw0bw,dasistverboten,1 point,Sun Mar 22 23:07:23 2015 UTC,"Definitely get it checked out. My hands open up, but I wouldn't say it's my entire limb. If nothing else, no one has ever died of getting something checked out, whereas plenty of people have died of letting something go."
Fibromyalgia,2zw0bw,dasistverboten,2,Sun Mar 22 23:28:35 2015 UTC,"I haven't necessarily noticed dropping of things but I have noticed an increase in a general lack of coordination/control over my limbs.

It was only when I got home 7 hours later that I looked at it and thought I should go to hospital.   What would doctors normally look for if you all of a sudden started dropping things? Neurological issues? I will have a look through some info and come back, hopefully with more of a clue...  Edit: I really think you need to get someone to drive you to a doctor, it seems as if there is something important going on, I'm sorry - I'm not a doctor."

Its happened with other things, too, less heavy objects and anything that I have to hold with a tight grip. I'm also very clumsy and run into things/trip/fall a lot.

Fibromyalgia,2zw0bw,Chilly73,1 point,Sun Mar 22 16:27:20 2015 UTC,I have been like that since the beginning. My doctors say because of my muscle issues it's causing me to be weaker and therefore not able to exert enough effort and not be as clumsy.
Fibromyalgia,2zw0bw,susanvickers,1 point,Sun Mar 22 20:49:50 2015 UTC,Is this clumsiness with fatigue or part of a flare or was it sudden. If it was sudden onset go see your doctor. I had sudden onset of clumsiness 2 years ago and turned out my medicine was doing something it shouldn't have. For some reason it started blocking normal signal too not just pain signal. The clumsiness was actually generalized lost of sensation in my extremities.

Fibromyalgia,2zw0bw,ginafeesh,1 point,Sun Mar 22 22:56:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have experienced this and it's gotten much worse in recent years.  I've replaced a set of dishes in the last year, a set of glasses, eye glasses and for the last week I've been on bedrest after a trip to the emergency room in an ambulance.  Why?  I was getting my wife her nightly hot water bottle to warm up her blanket, went to carry it and dropped it on the floor.  The hot water bottle burst along the bottom seam and shot the water onto my foot.  I now have a foot of many colors with 1st, lots of 2nd, and some 3rd degree burns that cannot be walked on and has to be above my heart to relieve the pain as blood flow and liquid pooling makes it so much worse than it should be.  So yes, it's normal.  I usually can recognize when I start to get shaky and then tell myself to slow down and be super deliberate in my motions.  But I'm not there yet.  Learn to recognize your signs, learn to work on concentrating on what you're doing (not a slight against you, our fibro brains have issues multitasking so doing something as simple as talking while gripping something can cause us to lose focus) intensely, and to laugh when you can at the things you break.

It turned out, for me at least, that it started out as fibro pain and the fear that it was just starting and would get worse led a panic attack that did make it get worse.  Like a self fulfilling prophesy of the worst kind.  I have learned how to force myself to relax and not spin so out of control (not saying anything bad about you, this is me I'm talking about) and it really helps when I get like that.  The racing pulse slows, the breathing is easier.  It still hurts, but without the freak out part as much.  The whole thing you describe can happen just because you're breathing to fast and shallow, which can happen because it hurts to breathe, but it leads to the numbness and heart racing and all of it.  If you can make yourself slow down and count your breaths in and out a few seconds each instead of a panting type of breath, that might help.  If you can stand sound, then try quiet relaxing music.

There are several things that are cause for concern, but for me the main ones are the change in your vision and balance/co-ordination. I (F26) completely understand the exhaustion and loss of balance and my vision has also worsened, but you really shouldn't be dismissed for these concerns.   If your current GP won't listen, please see someone else. Whilst these symptoms are present in many FMS cases (myself included), it sounds like a referral to neurology just to make sure everything is 'normal' wouldn't be a bad idea."
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,TheGreenFaery,3,Sat Mar 21 17:03:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for responding. I have nobody on the spoonie spectrum to speak to.   Does your balance prevent you from getting up steps and lifting yourself upwards? This scares me so much and is so socially embarrassing. I've fallen backwards down flights of stairs and not even know it's going to happen, my legs just FAIL. I cry so much because 3 years ago I did 4 exercise classes a week and sometimes now I have to call for help to get to my apartment. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, if this is normal fibro or what the hell the future holds.   I ended up in hospital recently for cluster headaches and they did some tests (e.g. resistance, muscle strength) but nobody said anything. I wept more from fibro pain in there than the head pain but they ignored it and just harped on about painkiller use. I don't want those things! Do you think from a head scan and those tests something serious would have been picked up? I think if I'm 100% honest with you my fear right now is M.S.   You're right, my GP is flippant and I'm genuinely frightened now. Even if it's something I'm doing wrong I'd rather know and rectify it.

Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,TheGreenFaery,1 point,Mon Mar 23 17:26:48 2015 UTC,"I am in almost exactly the same position as you with MS fears. It should be noted that an MRI will show up any lesions on the brain associated with MS, so if you've had a clear result from an MRI you don't have MS. My fibro also shares all of the signs and symptoms of MS, with the exception of incontinence, so I completely understand your fears.  My balance is not great, and stairs always seem to exacerbate vertigo. I used to work at a hospital (convenient, I know) and on more than one occasion I found myself ""stuck"" halfway up the stairs. I also used to be very active and the change is scary.  You sound like you could do with a referral to a pain management clinic, or at the very least someone who is going to listen to you. Pain management physio has truly helped me in the past, and even helped improve my balance by re-educating my brain to know where postural problems are present and how to correct them.  There are options out there that can be really helpful for allaying fears and taking back some semblance of control. If you live in the UK, The Migraine Trust also offers a really good support network if you suffer from migraine and cluster headaches.  Feel free to contact me anytime as I will always reply. Sometimes simply airing your fears can do wonders. Wishing you all the best. :)"
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,kiwiburd,1 point,Tue Mar 24 11:24:21 2015 UTC,"You're so right, this is the first time I've reached out and it feels oddly empowering. All I've ever done before is cry in bed and hope to die before 30.   I had an MRI of my neck and shoulders, not my head...would that has still shown clear results?   It must have been awful for you going about your normal business at work then being halted. It's terrifying. I fell out of a taxi the other day! I also fell down a flight of stairs in a nightclub (I didn't feel strong enough to go but had promised my friend) and was truly mortified. My body had transformed from merely hurting to...well, failing.   My physiotherapy thus far has been limited and pain-related as opposed to condition-related. I want to gain strength and ability. Never been offered pain management physio, they focus on mindfulness techniques here.   I do feel very out of control right now, which is frightening and degrading. Thank you for reaching out :)"
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,Maegaranthelas,1 point,Fri Mar 27 15:40:05 2015 UTC,"I would feel more comfortable if you'd had a brain scan to rule out any neurological conditions. It may also be worth checking your vit. D levels as I have previously found that when mine are low (usually abysmally low for whatever reason, even in the summer) that always increases my pain and fatigue. Vit. D deficiency has repeatedly been linked to fibro- so go soak up some rays if at all possible! Iron levels are also worth having checked.   Rest assured you are not the only young person going through this. There are things that can be done to help you cope, and when I get the opportunity I shall send you links to fibro and pain management resources that can be accessed and used for free (it may be a while- I'm currently away from home).  In the meantime I suggest a flomping party. Tomorrow I've got to look after and play with a particularly hyperactive 4 year old niece- I tired just thinking about it!"
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,Maegaranthelas,1 point,Fri Mar 27 21:30:58 2015 UTC,"I do feel like, just like you said, that some more investigation would be beneficial. I felt partially dismissed for being young, female, with a history of mental health problems. But I pay my taxes (through excruciating pain!) so would like the same treatment others receive.   You've caught me...I do spend little time outdoors! I work indoors all week and cry in bed (in pain) all weekend so my Vitamin D is probably appalling.   Thank you so much for acknowledging that this happens to all age groups and is so immensely traumatising. I'll try anything to help but ultimately feel lost right now..."
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,Maegaranthelas,5,Sat Mar 28 20:22:49 2015 UTC,Have you tried cymbalta or amitriptyline? These drugs help with mood and neuralgia. Neuralgia is basically nerve problems and can be contributing to your hand weakness. Cymbalta may also give you more energy. Amitriptyline can help you sleep together. They both work similarly though so your doctor would help you choose one.   A rheumatologist may be more helpful to you for starting better therapies.  Stay strong!
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,skeletorsleftlung,1 point,Sat Mar 21 17:25:11 2015 UTC,"I've been on antidepressants for almost a decade now so they haven't mentioned tampering with those...although they have been reduced recently so you may have a major point.   I tried Gabapentin for nerve pain but got bizzarre side-effects (e.g. getting lost whilst out, blanking conversatios)...however I'm almost willing to go back to that as work is hell and we get treated like criminals for needing stronger pain relief.   I would love to get rid of the weakness and have some energy, like you said. Some days I can't get up the stairs to my apartment without assistance and end up crying after a 20 minute drive. It's horrific, but if that's a normal fibro thing I'll just have to accept it but I don't know if it is?   I was never referred to a rheumatologist (UK) and have started to wonder why. I truly believe we as chronic sufferers need time, support and focus to help ourselves but that isn't afforded in our busy society.   Stay strong yourself and thank you :)"
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,skeletorsleftlung,3,Sat Mar 21 20:09:23 2015 UTC,"I have had this symptoms, and they occured specifically when I pushed myself too hard.

Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,Arose21,2,Sat Mar 21 19:23:03 2015 UTC,I think you may be right as I've had a mental health 'crash' recently but put that secondary to my physical health. I'm so terrified of having to change my life and give up all my dreams because of a diagnosis. I'm very stubborn!  Working full-time has always been a major challenge and probably in hindsight horrific for my wellbeing. I had goals before being diagnosed though and want to explore them. Maybe like you say though I really am headed for a crash. Thank you so much for responding.
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,skeletorsleftlung,2,Sat Mar 21 20:03:35 2015 UTC,"I also had a lot of dreams, and while I may still achieve them I have had to postpone them until I am phsically and mentally better equipped to deal with them. Physical and mental health are so close with fibro, if you're not in your right headspace you'll ignore the important ques about where your hard boundaries are. Please take care of yourself!"
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,skeletorsleftlung,1 point,Sat Mar 21 22:09:24 2015 UTC,"You're so, so right. I've maybe gone overboard because I landed my 'dream job' but my physical health has taken a massive downturn since. I don't recognise myself. I worry if I postpone things I'll never get anywhere because this goddamn condition seems to get worse and worse.   It's interesting you talk about boundaries...I know I'm stubborn and want to push them all the time but maybe this one time I've gone too far and my health is saying ""NO""?   I've never taken care of myself (my profession is caring for others) so that's another interesting point...  Thank you for commenting :)"
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,hydrogenbound,1 point,Mon Mar 23 17:38:01 2015 UTC,"I can imagine, when I am doing something I enjoy I also tend to push myself too hard, which is likely what landed me with fibro in the first place.   I understand you feel like you need to get things done before things get worse, but I think pushing breaks you down and you might need to step back to find a way to live sustainably.   I also never took care of myself, but I am learning now :)"
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,jlmitch12,2,Mon Mar 23 20:59:34 2015 UTC,"I can sympathize. My fibro has been going on for years, but in the past year it really stepped  it's game. I had never had vision problems, but now I have to wear glasses. What my doctor told me likely happened is that my vision had been bad for a while now, but I'd been automatically straining my eyes to correct it. Now, with so much else going on, plus my new medications, my eyes just couldn't  do it anymore. Definitely get in and talk to your doctor. Make them listen to everything you have to say, and don't  leave until they've  addressed all of your concerns."
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,FibroMan,2,Sat Mar 21 19:53:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply.   Did you notice a certain point where your fibro became unbearably worse and did it correlate with anything? I don't know why now, apart from possibly stress.   I want to have a frank discussion with my doctor about the fear of my deterioration without them instantly thinking it's a chat about pain relief. We are so much more than that!  Hope you are doing as best you can right now."
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,FibroMan,2,Sat Mar 21 20:29:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had that problem. When I was 17 they first started looking for causes for my pain. They did the arthritis blood tests, but found nothing. So they gave me prescription strength tylenol and left it at that. Then when I was 27 they looked into it some more because I was having more pain more frequently. They did bone scans, MRI's, CT's, everything they could think of. They, of course, found nothing. The ortho that ordered all the tests told me that they couldn't find anything to explain my pain. I asked about fibro and he said that the symptoms all fit, but that he didn't think that's what it was because I was 27 and male, so statistically it was unlikely. It wasn't until late last year, at the age of 34 and after a bunch more tests, many the same I'd had 7 years before, that a neurologist looked over my chart and said ""Oh yeah, this is fibro, it's practically textbook fibro except your age and sex.""  The past year and a half or so has been the worst I've ever had. Just a few weeks ago I lost my job because of absences caused by fibro and I've now had to drop out of college with only 18 hours left to get my English degree. But on the bright side, I've got a great pain clinic that listens and does everything they can to help. That's really the crucial part. Just getting a doctor that's informed about fibro and knows the non-pain aspects of it. If you have decent insurance I'd ask your doctor to help you find a pain clinic your insurance will cover. They know their stuff.   As far as a turning point, for me there wasn't necessarily an event that I can point to. Not really even a big increase in stress. Just over the period of a few weeks my pain levels rose and my mid-line became what my peaks used to be.   The biggest hurtle for me going through the process was that I always felt like the doctors would think I was just a pillseeker. None of them ever outright made me feel that way, but I couldn't help feeling like that was in their minds. I think the best thing to do to combat it is to hold out and let them know that you're willing to see whatever specialists they want to confirm that you are suffering."
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,FibroMan,1 point,Sat Mar 21 22:05:48 2015 UTC,"I understand that men are less likely to have fibro than women but I am wondering why your doctor said age was a factor? I'm 25, was diagnosed officially last summer, and my rheumatologist told me that it's more than likely I've had the disease my whole life. I just only recognized something was wrong when I had a huge flare up after stopping dancing 3 days/week and working a job that caused terrible pain in my hands."
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,annabell87,1 point,Sun Mar 22 05:25:55 2015 UTC,It's because statistically most people aren't diagnosed until their 40's or even 50's. The number of people diagnosed younger than 30 is ridiculously low. This leads doctors who aren't as well informed to think that the condition is incredibly rare younger than that. The actual case is that that only perpetuates the instance of late diagnosis.
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,shaylenn,1 point,Sun Mar 22 17:46:40 2015 UTC,"I've seen this debate in research before and I'm really interested. I don't see why us younger folk get dismissed for having the condition and I pray in the near future there is some more clarity (for us all, to be honest). I think it's assumed that younger people naturally have better muscle tone/posture/mobility so that diverts attention. To be fair, I had amazing fitness when I was diagnosed which confused everyone. They just seemed to think I'd had a random injury at work or something.   I've read a lot about the link between immunology and fibro. I had a particularly bad case of Mono/Glandular Fever and recurrent chest infections at age 22 that I'm still wondering if it contributed. On top of mental health problems of course.   I think we should all keep talking about the age issue. It's frightening for us all that this a potentially life-long, limiting and debilitating condition.   It seems it can strike at any age."
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,jamiemac2005,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:21:50 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry you faced so much dismissal and discrimination due to your age/sex, that must have been horrendous. I feel like age is a huge factor and also the fact that I had mental health problems a decade prior to the symptoms that occurred.   I don't actually know what I have had tests done and for what, which sounds absurd but I'm in the UK and the consistency between healthcare professionals doesn't seem to be the same (not that I disagree with state healthcare!). I had an MRI for fibro and of course bloodwork, but after that nothing...I had a hospital stay recently for extreme head pain where I had a CT scan and more bloodwork but I don't know what they were looking for? I saw a consultant ONE time who just gave me my diagnoses and said I could go to a mindfulness group if I wanted, but I was working at that time also.   Oh goodness, I feel your pain over losing your job because of this hideous condition. I've lost two in the past, it was crushing. They were quite physical and not where my heart was but this one is more sedentary and my dream so I thought it would be different...I doubt I will last much longer though. Moving back with my parents at 27/28 feels devastating, I also LOVE working.   As for the 18 hours, can you not pick them up another way? Surely that is a reasonable adjustment for a legitimate disability? You must have endured so much to get to that point.   I will push my GP more for support and as you advised, be more open-minded with treatment options. I've always been stubborn (I admit!) and just wanted meds (nerve blocking, pain relief, antidepressants, whatever) just so I could carry on what I planned for my life. All courses and treatment seems to be outside of working hours and I hated that but maybe it is time for me to be less stubborn and listen to my body.   I really, really hope things pick up for you after what sounds like a traumatic year or so and good luck with the pain clinic."
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,jamiemac2005,1 point,Mon Mar 23 17:52:21 2015 UTC,Just reading your account of events again and weeping...  Having to relinquish your dreams (I know I will have to numerous times) and being dismissed by professionals is horrifying.   My thoughts and feelings are really with you. Your are more than your pain.
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,Sorrybuttotallywrong,1 point,Sat Mar 28 20:34:29 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the thought. But, while it was pretty unpleasant and frustrating getting here, I'm in a much better situation now. I couldn't be more pleased with my pain clinic. They're really understanding and are more than happy to look into any and all options that might help me and work with my insurance. I'm making the best of my situation and overall, I'm relatively happy with my life as it is. Of course, today's a good day. I don't hurt too bad, I actually have energy. Tomorrow I might feel different. But still, overall, I'm doing alright. Hope you are, too."
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,Sorrybuttotallywrong,2,Wed Apr 1 18:41:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think there is a really good reason that Fibromyalgia qualifies people for Disability benefits. I used to happily work 2 jobs and keep a perfect house and do tons of activities but since being diagnosed my functionality has completely deteriorated and there is no way that I can do what I used to do. Fibromyalgia patients are still expected to keep up the same level of productivity because Social Security Disability (in USA) is still pretty new. I think you need to have a very candid conversation with your doctor about disability and the realities of living with fibromyalgia. It completely cripples me with pain fatigue and brain fog. We pay into Social Security for years and years just for this reason.   You ask "" Is this normal?""  NO it's not normal. But it is normal for me and I'm so so sorry that it is normal for you. All we can do is try to retrain to find work that is less hard on our bodies and medicines that help us deal with symptoms and learn to be gentle and forgive ourselves for not being the people we thought we would be. (((hugs))) hope it gets easier soon."
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,peanutgallerie,2,Sat Mar 21 21:10:03 2015 UTC,"In our country (the UK) I'm not sure how it is received in terms of disability benefits. I was so excited to come off disability benefits (7 years ago) for mental health reasons that I never paid it any mind! I feel just as held back now from daily duties, but in an entirely different way.   I'm sorry to hear your functionality has declined so dramatically. It's hard to communicate the fear and frustration sometimes.   I'm having a graded return to work but if that fails I will hold my hands up and admit fibromyalgia has won. As soon as my body fails, my brain fails and I just cease to function. I'm desperate.  Thank you for speaking out to help."
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,lbsmith5,1 point,Sun Mar 29 19:37:02 2015 UTC,"If you're falling a lot, a cane might help. It certainly does for me. I have a vertigo disorder and a neurological movement disorder (Dystonia) and although at first I wasn't thrilled to have to use a cane at age 29, now I love it. It helps with walking of course, but it also comes in handy when I need to move or pick up things. And they make all kinds of different designs now. I have a lovely silver and blue one that folds up, glow in the dark handle. Good luck!"
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,lbsmith5,2,Sun Mar 22 01:05:39 2015 UTC,"I've seen some lovely canes about (a leopard print one would be ideal) but have always worried it would decrease my mobility even further...what with using certain muscle groups less. It would be fantastic for steps...I still feel so lazy, guilty and useless when I can't get up steps. I have a step outside my house that even elderly people can manage but I just can't! So frustrating!   I wish you luck for the future and am glad you're finding ways to navigate through life :)"
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,peanutgallerie,1 point,Mon Mar 23 17:34:25 2015 UTC,I remember when fibro first started affecting my knees.  I thought that eventually I would need a wheelchair.  Luckily fibro is self limiting and with a bit of exercise my fibro left my knees alone and found somewhere else to annoy me.  Eyesight and balance problems can be part of fibro.  They can also be a symptom of something else.  I always check new symptoms with my doctor because fibro doesn't give you immunity from anything else.  If I was you I would look for part time work.  It would take a lot of pressure off and might reduce your pain levels.
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,peanutgallerie,1 point,Sun Mar 22 03:57:13 2015 UTC,"That was my first concern, that if this was happening now at 27 then what the heck will another 3 years do to wreak havoc on my body?!  Out of interest, what exercise do you do to prevent this? I used to do Aerobics, Zumba, Aqua aerobics, swimming, yoga...I could weep over how I used to enjoy all those things :( Now I admittedly do very little...just started yoga again in private (I would fall and cry in classes) but it has caused horrible flares.   You're right on so many levels. Checking in with a regular GP who doesn't view me as a drug seeker would validate how frightened I am and part-time work would be much more feasible. It's that admitting that you can't do your dream career that is devastating.   Thank you for your input."
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,peanutgallerie,1 point,Mon Mar 23 17:31:05 2015 UTC,"My strategy has been to focus exercise on wherever my biggest problem is.  If it is my knees then I do cycling, if it is my mid-back I do ""pussy cat"" stretches.  If I get aches in a new place then I go to a physio who can identify exactly where the problem is, and can tell me which exercises to do to target the area."
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,Hegaboo,1 point,Tue Mar 24 01:43:38 2015 UTC,"This is a really wise approach, thank you.   Currently my entire body feels a mess so I was hoping (fingers crossed!) there'd be one form of exercise that'd ease multiple areas at once. That may be too much to ask for.   I do end up having to do most at home, is that the same for you?"
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,cowzroc,1 point,Fri Mar 27 15:43:39 2015 UTC,Swimming is probably the best general exercise for people with fibro.  I went swimming 2 days ago and I can feel it all over.  I can get quite foggy so exercises that I can do at home are the best - no appointments to keep and I can do them whenever I have the energy for it.
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,cowzroc,1 point,Sat Mar 28 01:43:15 2015 UTC,"I love swimming! I feel like a total water baby just moving my joints in the pool. Maybe it's psychological for me but after a day at work I feel so drained and physically nauseous I worry about getting in a pool. What if I can't get in or out? What if I can't swim any distance?  I was happiest in my life when I didn't work but swam every day :) Thank you for reminding me of that. I could weep for those times again. It isn't really realistic not to work though or contribute to running a home and that scares me more than I could say in words.  Yoga at home is having varying results at the moment. It can either trigger a massive flare or give me some more strength. Oh, what we go through!"
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,Stashcashew,1 point,Sat Mar 28 20:11:31 2015 UTC,"I would definitely talk to your doctor about these symptoms, it could be MS.  I have many of the same symptoms and my doctor dx me with fibromyalgia with possible  MS (need to set up a spinal tap but she feels that until we see a progression in MS like symptoms it is not worth the invasive procedure at this time. )   Seriously,  please see your doctor.  Ps, I just turned 28, it sucks to feel this way at this age already."
Fibromyalgia,2ztgh5,Stashcashew,1 point,Sun Mar 22 04:57:36 2015 UTC,"I know, I still think 27/28 is young and it's so upsetting to think of things we could be doing and how I could be living a fuller life. I've always pushed through (I'm so stubborn!) but recently that has been an impossibility.   I had a spinal tap recently but they were looking into brain pressure. Do you think MS would have come up as part of that? It did feel invasive but if it's any comfort it wasn't anything like fibro pain (more an 'uncomfortable tickle') in comparison and I'd have one every week if it took away my fibro symptoms.   I'm sorry you have to endure this agony too and hope your future is brighter, both physically and mentally."
Fibromyalgia,2zs332,KittyL0ver,3,Sat Mar 21 05:00:54 2015 UTC,"I think it is consistent with the theory that CFS and fibro are metabolic disorders, possibly due to low thyroid hormones or thyroid resistance that /u/EsotericKnowledge made a post about  here."
Fibromyalgia,2zs332,FibroMan,1 point,Sat Mar 21 07:54:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, that I did. It also supports the idea that in some women who have both fibro and PCOS, there may be a (metabolic) link between the two syndromes."
Fibromyalgia,2zs332,EsotericKnowledge,1 point,Sun Mar 22 04:57:23 2015 UTC,It could be a factor. But they have also found out that there are nerve issues involved as well.   I always have felt that fibro has many different methods of manifestation and affects each person differently.   I have zero thyroid issues. Except for my opiate absorption issue (which only happened 4 years ago$ I have no metabolic issues at all.
Fibromyalgia,2zs332,Sorrybuttotallywrong,1 point,Sun Mar 22 20:56:16 2015 UTC,"I think that there are a lot of different things that can ultimately lead to fibro (and related disorders), and I'm not trying to imply that I've found ""the"" answer or anything like that.   Unfortunately, the problem with thyroid testing is that you can test ""normal"" and have everything look good, and still need some kind of treatment. ""Enough/normal/average"" might not be enough for an individual, in the same sort of way that some of us seem to need more of a particular vitamin or something than another person.   I really think one of the most toxic attitudes about medicine (and nutrition, even) that doctors and the general public have is the implication that there's one answer, one way, one number, whatever that is applicable to everyone. We're all calibrated a little differently and we all need to experiment with ourselves to try and find what works for us."
Fibromyalgia,2zs332,EsotericKnowledge,1 point,Mon Mar 23 15:59:06 2015 UTC,100% agreed.   Over the last six years except for a few times having bad cholesterol I have had within the norms without much deviation and no signs of anything being wrong except my fibro and nerve damage.

Fibromyalgia,2zqu8q,k1012,1 point,Fri Mar 20 23:10:38 2015 UTC,When I got in my wreck my doctor gave me muscle relaxers which really helped cut down on the pain since a lot of it was because of stiffness. My whole body was extremely tense for weeks afterwards and I could barely move my neck. My car insurance ended up paying for everything since I had full coverage so I went to a chiropractor and a physical therapist for a while as well. Anti-inflammatory drugs should help too.

Fibromyalgia,2zogni,GMU_TheHulk,3,Fri Mar 20 07:55:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, trouble with cold and/or heat is pretty common.  If you feel fibro fog is getting worse, which it can, then perhaps a change in profession is needed?

Your wife will learn. It is very difficult for people without a disease to know what it's like. Have her get on here and read some of the posts. Also, have her read the spoon theory in the side bar."
Fibromyalgia,2zogni,vibes86,2,Fri Mar 20 12:37:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, temp changes are very common. Also the inability to 'feel' the temperature can be common.   You need to have your wife read up on fibronyalgia and also go with you to your doctor so she can be explained what has happened to you, how it is not your fault, and that until you find a way to manage the pain she has to be more understanding of you. It took awhile for my wife to also get to that point.   Sounds like your job is very physical. Some fibro people can handle the pain with a good physical therapist. Other people feel like they are being tortured by the CIA (which would be me as one of those people). Since you lift heavy things I highly suggest MRIs and Nerve conduction tests to be done to make sure you spinal column, neck, and nerves are normal.   I don't know how your situation is or where you live but a few suggestions off the top of my head   1) find a grant to go and learn a new trade/career. There are some still out there and financial aid might be of big help  2) apply for social security disability - you have to not be working for 6 months and they will investigate if you really can't work. This is a hard decision. I realized I couldn't due to my pain and nerve problems so had to suck it up and now have a masters gathering dust. However at least we make ends meet because of it  Also on the plus side I see my kids more. If you find a good social security law firm (they usually only deal wth those claims) they get a few thousand out of your total back pay if you win and nothing if you get denied.   3) work from home - don't know your skills but this could be an option if you have it  3) find a different job where you can make use of your job or skill experience but don't need to lift heavy stuff all day.   Also depending on your job, in an Union, what your employee contract says, and even what your state says you might be able to force an easier job from your employer or at least consideration of them to be understanding with your newfound disability. Because it is a disability.   4) apply for state aid if you need to quit your job - there are good resources out there and could help while waiting to apply for social security.   I really hope you are able to still work and that your wife is supportive to you through this time."

You may have to look into a new career or disability benefits.   Your wife needs to read up on fibro so she can understand that this is a real thing, it's not a character flaw, and she is going to have to be careful what she does interacting with you. Education is key. With time, you'll get a better picture of what you can and can't do, and you can both adjust to those new limits."

Fibromyalgia,2zobuu,irishgrrl,2,Fri Mar 20 06:40:55 2015 UTC,"I know that I don't have the answers for your situation in specific. I know that if I could prescribe you some wonderful treatment that would make it all go away, I would in a heartbeat. We all feel each others' struggles here. I think in your case though, you're depending on other people to make you happy. The build up to which is disappointing at best. The thing with fibro and chronic pain in general is that outsiders don't get it. They simply can't relate. Some try, some don't. The result is the same though: you know your body and your mind better than anyone else. And for this reason, you need to love yourself better than anyone else. Give yourself a break. You're only human. Allow yourself to feel upset, frustrated, angry, but also try to allow yourself to feel empathy and respect. You're going through something most people couldn't. You're strong. It's just hard to get motivated about the future when you're caught up with all the bull shit like health insurance, experimental treatment, lack of research in the medical field, etc.   I guess I would say that while you're going through this, however long it may take, find some things--small things--that you can look forward to everyday. For me, it's a smoothie, a light hike up the mountain nearby, and a few episodes on Netflix. Chase the bliss. Aggressively. Being happy and in pain is no easy task but you can do it. Allow yourself to fail, we all do. Because it'll only help you to do better next time.   I'm sorry if this is totally unhelpful. But it would be silly to try to dig into the complicated details of going through healthcare providers and all the obstacles we have to go through. I do know that aqua therapy is pretty awesome, so I hope that provides some relief. I think the point I'm trying to make is be nice to yourself. Be your own biggest fan. Be your own shoulder to lean on because not many people will be able to relate with you. In the meantime, rant as much as you need! Ranting is the best.

Don't sit with them crossed, and try to have them elevated. Look at buying a wedge cushion. Also be careful as to posture when in bed, maybe sleep with a pillow under your knees/calves.

Fibromyalgia,2zletc,capatiller,4,Thu Mar 19 15:41:45 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't hurt that much. If you get a phlebotomist you shouldn't even feel the needle go in. Some of them are really incredible at making it easy. So if you can go to a lab and get a lab tech to do the draw it usually goes better than with the nurse in the doctor's office.  It's possible they had trouble finding a good vein and had to go deeper or in a more sensitive area to find one. Sometimes they goof and bruise the vein. There are things you can do to make your next blood draw easier:   Drink 8-16 ounces of water about 10-15 minutes before the draw. Being hydrated helps make your veins plump. Ask them to use a butterfly, it's a smaller needle.  Keep the site of the draw warm. Maybe even use a hot pack to warm it up. If you know of a site that's been easy in the past ask them to use that. Or ask if they can take it out of the back of your hand or wrist (most definitely need a butterfly for those). Breathe slowly and deeply and try to relax.  Take some acetaminophen or ibuprofen before hand to help with the pain. After they remove the needle put solid pressure on the wound for a minute or two, not just to stop the bleeding but to prevent bruising. Then put a wad of gauze on it and tape it down tight to keep the swelling down. You can remove this after 20 minutes or so."
Fibromyalgia,2zletc,GetOffMyLawn_,1 point,Thu Mar 19 16:32:07 2015 UTC,"See this is what is strange, it is a site normally used for my blood draws, it was at the lab, not the doctors office, and I had just finished downing a 16.9 bottle of water, because I had to give a urine sample.  It was the oddest blood draw I have ever had. I will be sure next time to ask for a butterfly needle. She apologized for hurting me, and it didn't seem as if anything was different. I don't know, it is still searing with pain. I will try the warm pack and butterfly needle options next time.  Thank you for the suggestions, and I will be sure to follow them next time. I have to have blood drawn every 3 months to monitor levels, so I will have an opportunity to try these soon."

Wrong tube, tube expired, not enough blood in tube, broken vacuum on tube, forgot to put my name on the tube, dropped tubes on the floor, nurse trainee (that was the worst), I flinched once and blood sprayed the nurse, bruised the vein (I thought I was going to pass out), no blood coming out but as soon as they took the needle out blood everywhere, blown vein, massive bruising, residual pain.  Take some pain pills and put ice on it if you can tolerate ice. I know some people do not do well with anything cold. I had a cortisone shot in my thumb last year and it was like getting hit with a hammer, but lots of ice and some tylenol took care of the worst of it."

Fibromyalgia,2zjvmn,Merkinfumble,1 point,Thu Mar 19 08:41:33 2015 UTC,"I have the same sensation in both of my legs.  It started around 3 to 4 years ago.  I liken it to someone sanding my skin with really rough grit sand paper.  If I'm exposed to the cold air long enough (and possibly air pressure changes), it will also cause a really deep ache through the legs which goes all the way to the core.  I have figured out that any air, wind or otherwise, below around 70 degs F triggers it.  The other thing which triggers it are cold objects.  Cold metal, glass, ect feel like a hot iron searing my skin.  That lasts around 2 mins after the object is removed, then becomes a severe stinging sensation which takes another 2 mins to subside.  I have also developed sensitivity to some fabrics.  The rougher the fabric, the more it annoys me.  I have been seeing a pain neurologist.  She seems to think it has come along as a result of being on opiod pain medication too long.  I had been on 45 mg a day of MS Contin since late 2008.  I just finished coming off of it last month.  Unfortunately, the cold air pain hasn't subsided in the least.  The other fibro pain has a very slight amount, but I haven't fully put it to the test yet.  Oddly, the only thing that will not trigger it is being in cold lake or river water.  For some reason, both of those will almost completely melt all pain.  Once I'm out though, it comes right back."

Fibromyalgia,2zijvv,ZanSquid,11,Thu Mar 19 00:11:12 2015 UTC,"I know this probably isn't the most helpful thing to hear... but good riddance. While taking care of someone certainly can be a lot to ask of someone else, a person who truly loves you for you would not ditch you for someone who they can mountain bike with. They would find a way to make it work.   The part that really bothers me is the word ""caregiver"" - it implies this sense of burden or severe inability to function without him. To me, it sounds like he's just using your fibro as his excuse to feel better about not being happy in general. Perhaps that is just me making assumptions based on the wording you used but frankly if he is OK with up and leaving you for someone else because you can't mountain bike with him and he thinks he has to be your caregiver, he is not worth calling a husband anyway.   Husbands should be there for you, for better or worst. You find ways to make it work and compromise when you can't share the same activities or perspectives. You are there to help each other when you are having a rough time. If he is not willing to try and find a way to make your marriage work because he wants to go mountain biking, let him. You deserve someone who would find a way, no matter how difficult it may seem, to involve you within your limits or accept the fact that you cannot physically participate, share that activity with friends and find a different activity to enjoy with you. Because that is what love is.   You deserve someone who is more focused on making your relationship work and getting over difficult hurdles together, no matter how impossible they may seem, rather than someone who tears them down and ditches you to face a mountain alone.   You deserve to find someone who will love you for you and is not afraid to face your fibro with you.  Best of luck dear <3"

You are a world of people who do understand and will stand with you. To leave you for a reason that you cannot control just shows that he is not worthy to be with you. He will soon realize the big mistake he has made. You deserve SO much better. Go conquer the world now :)

You don't sound bitter or self-punishing, you sound like you accept what happened and you know it sucks and it is what it is. I think this will help you mourn and move past him.   Also, seriously my gaydar is going off too. He can go off and crush his nuts on a bike w/ another dude.

It won't matter one iota that you have fibro to them. They will give you so much more than you can imagine while you are hurt so badly, and they will do it because they know you are worth it and so much more. So sorry for your heartbreak, take care,  (hugs) and love,  Shez."

Fibromyalgia,2zign8,htewing,2,Wed Mar 18 21:10:16 2015 UTC,"Firstly, welcome to the fibromites. I'm fairly new here myself, but no where near to new with fibro.   I am actually 24 yo so I completely understand the feeling to being unable to be a ""normal"" 20-something. What I can tell you is that having people around me that understand, or are trying to understand what I am going through, really helps. My boyfriend has been around since my diagnosis and has be able to learn about it alongside me. The most important thing that he does though is believes me. He believes that I am in pain, and doesn't try to push me. Thankfully, my parents are the same way. Having someone there who you can vent to, even if they don't physically understand, helps. Someone that doesn't judge you.  As for talking to your family, not going to lie, can be very frustrating. The only thing you can do is continue to try and explain it. Unless they have chronic pain as well, they really aren't going to ever 100% understand. For me, that's okay as long as they can accept how you are feeling and what you are going through. Unfortunately, many people feel that it's not a real disease, or that you're making it up, or something similar. Don't ever believe them. If they aren't willing to listen to you, that's their problem. Whenever I talk to someone about it, I try and find something they can relate to. Like if someone strained their wrist, but not so bad that they have to wear a brace. By looking at them, you can't tell that their wrist hurts, but everyone would still believe them. Fibromyalgia is one of those really, really annoying invisible diseases that we are struggling with.  For the rheumatologist, I didn't find seeing one helpful. There wasn't really anything new they were telling me, that my GP hadn't. But it's really up to you. If you feel they are helpful, keep it up.   Now, I completely understand being terrified and depressed. I'm actually the same way. I'm on anti-anxiety medication because the anxiety is so bad. I was also on anti-depressants when I was first diagnosed, but have since been able to get off them (very slowly). But honestly, my only wish initially was for it to just go away. Wouldn't that be amazing? What has helped though, is just allowing myself to think about what is hurting, to focus on it. Where is the pain starting, what time of day, things like that. I have been able to share more specifics with my doctor when I see her that helps us find a medication regime that works. I would just say, don't be scared to try a new medication or treatment. You will have to play around to find what is best for you. I only just recently found one that works for me, 6 years later. Hopefully, it won't take you that long. I would also suggest trying things like massage therapy, and even though it sucks, make sure to keep exercising when you can, even just walking. The movement really helps.  Just know that you are not alone. We are here, we understand. And don't be scared to ask for help."
Fibromyalgia,2zign8,alieber,2,Wed Mar 18 21:45:51 2015 UTC,"First, hugs  Secondly, don't feel bad about quitting school. I had just gone back for a masters when I was diagnosed and it has taken me FOREVER and a semester of failed coursework. I'm getting out but just barely.   If there's stuff you want to do, you just have to make sure you can do it. I traveled a lot before I was diagnosed and I still do. I just make sure trips are low key, or if they're active, I have days of rest built in. If I'm flying, I travel with a cane so I can get situated on the plane first. I'm planning on traveling to Ireland with some cousins next year and went to Coachella in CA last year and will be going this year (I live in FL). Anyone I travel with has to understand I might need to sleep in, etc. I have depression and anxiety too, so I understand. I gave my husband, mom, and dad copies of the family member chapter of Fibromyalgia for Dummies book and then for the most part, they understood. My dad still doesn't get it sometimes. But words on paper are hard to refute, at the very least, it gives you something to refer to. When I was first diagnosed, I did get a second opinion from a rheum because I wanted to make sure what my DO was doing was ok, basically. The rheum basically said everything was fine and keep doing what we were doing. Fast forward 18 months, I have to switch insurances, and I lose my DO. I have some stuff that I think is rheumatoid arthritis anyway, so I go to a new rheum. I don't have a primary right now, which proved costly today, because I had to go to an urgent care to get diagnosed with a sinus infection. My point is, as long as you think your primary is doing right by you, you're fine. You might as well wait until your insurance runs out in August - are you in the US? You'll be able to get Obamacare then, or get on your parents' insurance until you're 26. I thought I had fibro at a few different points in my life (I probably did), so I'd done a TON of reading and it was almost like relief when I was diagnosed. Do a ton of reading - from reputable sources. Go to a bookstore or a library and read as many books as you can find. Do some googling, read the posts in here. Don't feel apprehensive about bringing things up to your doctor.   lots of pats I've only been at this a few years, but feel free to PM me whenever"
Fibromyalgia,2zign8,lbsmith5,1 point,Thu Mar 19 00:53:41 2015 UTC,"You need to rethink what you want to get out of life.  Figure out what really matters to you.  Is it travelling?  Think of how you can adjust your life so that you can achieve the most important things.  Be willing to forget about the things that don't matter as much. Fibro is not like a ""normal"" illness.  Resting doesn't work, powering through it doesn't work, taking medicine doesn't work.  It doesn't make sense.  Your mum is used to dealing with a normal illness.  Try to get her to understand that fibro is not logical. Rheumatologists aren't much more helpful than a good GP.  A GP is generally much easier to get an appointment with.  Be pro-active in your treatment.  If you read about something that might work then discuss it with your GP. Be patient.  Try lots of different things to find out what works for you.  If you have a little twinge then there is probably something there.  The pain amplification from fibro means that it is probably nothing to worry about.  Discuss it with your GP at your next appointment.  After a few cycles you will know what is due to your normal fibro and what isn't.  Focus on treating your most painful point with massage, physio, heat packs, etc.  The pain moves around so everywhere will get a turn ;)"
Fibromyalgia,2zign8,FibroMan,1 point,Thu Mar 19 02:26:05 2015 UTC,"Hi, welcome to the club :)  There is definitely a lot of information out there, but I think for now it's mostly anecdotal.  This subreddit has been an amazing resource, so definitely keep coming.  Here it goes:  1)  After I got diagnosed, I went through a very long (years) period of grief.  It's normal and necessary to grieve for your old body and old life, but it helped me a lot to look at it like this.  That was your old body/life.  Be sad for a while and grieve for it.  But then, when you're ready, realize that you need to start a NEW life.  It's not going to be the same as the life you lost, but you can still have a wonderful life.  That's the separation that helped me.  Sort of making peace with the way things are. 2.  For ideas of how to explain this to your family, search just this subreddit for the word ""describe"".  You should get a few posts full of comments about how it feels to have fibro and be in pain all the time.  I find this text very moving and a better look into what it's like than spoon theory alone.  I had my family read it.  :) 3.  I think this comes down to how much you trust your GP.  If they are compassionate and sharp and express a desire to help you control your symptoms, then there's no reason not to let them handle it.  I would maybe see a rheumy once so they can consult with your GP.  If they're not great or don't believe they can help you, I would absolutely find time to search out a good doctor for you.  I saw 3 docs since I moved to my current address all to find a good one. 4.  I think there have been two things that have helped me the most that I wish I had known from square one.  First, meditation is an amazing tool and can help you control your pain and (just as important), your anxiety.  I got trained in bio-feedback technique and it helps me to relax my muscles on command and can reduce pain for me I'd say about 30% when practiced.  Second, exercise can be extremely helpful.  HOWEVER, you need to start incredibly slowly and not overdo it.  I started at 5 minutes on a stationary bike per workout and gradually, a minute at a time, worked my way up to 20 minutes.  I absolutely feel better when I exercise nearly every day.  It's just important to learn your limitations and not rush into it.  Best of luck figuring this all out.  If you ever have any questions, feel free to PM me.  Would be happy to chat and share some trade secrets."
Fibromyalgia,2zhrov,Gr33n_Rider,3,Wed Mar 18 18:13:52 2015 UTC,You are not a freak. I do think it is important though to figure out why a bit so you can get the proper help. What are your inlaws doing during the day that you are covering yourself now? If it is just the fact of them being there that could be making the difference you need to recognize the mental component there. You may have anxiety that needs to be dealt with.   If they just cover things usually like taking care of the animals or cooking for you then you need to realize adding those activities to your day will take some effort and you may need to trade off somewhere else. Also recognizing when you are wearing down is your responsibility. Slow down BEFORE you crash not because you crash.
Fibromyalgia,2zhrov,peanutgallerie,2,Wed Mar 18 23:33:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks, my husband mentioned yesterday that if I couldn't take the dog out she would be ok until he got home from work. I took her out around the yard today instead of around the block and I felt less drained."
Fibromyalgia,2zhrov,sierbears,3,Thu Mar 19 16:50:48 2015 UTC,"I've had days where it felt like it went by in a minute, and days where it felt like every second was longer than it actually was. I know how you feel- I was doing really well for a few days, and then the next day I was totally out. Don't fret too much. Allow yourself to take a break. Asking others for help does not mean you are weak. Take everything one day at a time, but push yourself to finish things you want to finish. Good luck"
Fibromyalgia,2zhrov,FibroMan,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:40:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for the support. I'm trying to work on not associating asking for help with weakness. The therapy is helping a bit.
Fibromyalgia,2zhrov,alieber,3,Thu Mar 19 16:41:48 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me like you have done really well to get to where you are now.  Part of that was staying within a ""window"" of activity.  With the in-laws away you might have exceeded the amount of activity that you can safely do.  If you can drop some of your responsibilities you might be able to get back into the ""window"" and you might feel a lot better again.  Without drugs I would probably be unable to care for myself.  I don't think the underlying problem gets solved with fibro.  I think we just learn to cope with it better.  Well done for coping as well as you have."
Fibromyalgia,2zhrov,alieber,1 point,Wed Mar 18 23:40:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I have worked really hard, I should probably try to remember that more often.

But, I wouldn't be able to function without my meds."
Fibromyalgia,2zhrov,Sorrybuttotallywrong,3,Thu Mar 19 16:52:33 2015 UTC,"You are not alone at all. I completely understand.  I know that when I have someone around to help, I feel a lot better. Whether it be my boyfriend or my parents. Just knowing that if something major does happen, someone is there to take care of it. And sometimes when I am alone, I feel so much worse. There's probably a mental part of it, but that doesn't mean the pain isn't actually worse as well. It's just so hard to tell."
Fibromyalgia,2zhrov,Sorrybuttotallywrong,2,Wed Mar 18 21:23:37 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking on this a lot. I think I do have a really big problem with anxiety that I'm not addressing. I am seeing a therapist, but it's not helping that much. I spent three years in bed before I got diagnosed and I think I also have issues being home alone and getting depressed and lonely, even though I'm working on a novel and I only use my bed for sleeping at night now.  I was wondering if maybe trying to consider training for a career outside the home would be better for my mental health. Any thoughts? Also, thanks, I really appreciate the support and understanding. :)"
Fibromyalgia,2zhrov,Sorrybuttotallywrong,2,Thu Mar 19 16:49:26 2015 UTC,"I definitely feel like I am better when I'm out and doing something. I don't particularly like big crowds, but just being out of the house is good. I did get lucky and work for my dad who is extremely understanding, but I do still feel like I can struggle at times.   If you are willing and able, trying to find a job to do not at home might be great. Have you thought about any options yet?  And no problem on the understanding :) I wish I had someone who understood what I was going through at first. It's a good reassurance, at least for me, that you're not alone."

I have been reading some blog that has a lot of insight on a couple of things concerning fibro and how it is linked with hypothyroid. I think fibro is a disease that has lots of different causes, and that there are different ways to treat it.  I suggest you continue to do lots of research on your particular symptoms and try to treat what might be the root causes. I read about a lot of people who got cured that way. Good luck."

I'm trying to do research on my own and I've decided I need to see a pelvic therapist (I think a possible prolapse is causing a lot of my pelvic pain), an orthapedist (I have many structural/skeletal issues like hips that won't bend past a certain point), and a good diagnositician both rheumy and internist.

Stay strong and know that the pain will go away.  Is painsomnia a thing? I'm assuming that's when the pain is so high you can't or in my case don't want to sleep. I get it where my pain is high, I don't want to sleep, my mind is active, my body is shattered but something is stopping me for sleeping, which then makes the next day worse as I need sleep, so the pain is higher, but I usually ride that out until my eyes are basically shutting on their own and don't want to open. Then a nice 14 hour sleep and generally I'm slightly better lol. The thoughts are the hardest thing for me, the pain is right up there, but the thoughts linger, and stay even when the pain is gone, and that can be hard, very hard to deal with. Again I just try to keep strong, even in the darkest days, there is always something to be proud of, or hope for, I concentrate on those things, and try to stay busy."

If you add to that all the shit we put up with from doctors and random people telling us we are imagining it or faking it, top it off with the hopelessness of realizing it might be years before there could be any meaningful treatment, and you wind up with one giant shit pie.

If vomiting or diarrhea is causing fluid loss, then consuming some extra sodium may help with water retention. Hope you feel better soon!"
Fibromyalgia,2zc4f2,SecretKatie,2,Tue Mar 17 10:19:59 2015 UTC,Just curious what all you were taking. I take tramadol and tizanidine (zanaflex) for fibromyalgia and celexa for depression/anxiety with an occasional Valium for bad anxiety (maybe once a week unless work is very bad). I still have pain but it's manageable and I've been hesitant to try any fibromyalgia specific drugs because I want to get pregnant soon.
Fibromyalgia,2zc4f2,dearmrdarcy,1 point,Tue Mar 17 11:17:57 2015 UTC,How does the Zanaflex work for you? It makes me extremely panicky and nervous.
Fibromyalgia,2zc4f2,d0nnamarie,2,Wed Mar 18 03:52:10 2015 UTC,It's the only thing I've found that always helps. I don't have any side effects from it.
Fibromyalgia,2zc4f2,dearmrdarcy,1 point,Wed Mar 18 04:50:03 2015 UTC,I was on Flexeril and Robaxin which didn't do anything for me and the doctor has me trying Zanaflex now but it's making me all weird. I guess I'll be on to the next thing! I was just wondering if the panicky feeling was experienced by anyone else and you're the first person I've seen that has taken it! Thanks for your reply! :)
Fibromyalgia,2zc4f2,d0nnamarie,1 point,Wed Mar 18 04:55:58 2015 UTC,I have panic issues not related to the zanaflex so I totally get not wanting to stay on it. It takes forever to find a combo that works. Hopefully you'll find one.
Fibromyalgia,2zc4f2,dearmrdarcy,1 point,Wed Mar 18 08:16:19 2015 UTC,"I've been on Tramadol and Flexerill as needed for 2 years. Recently,I started having horrific Neuropathy pain in both feet and my hand. Also had a recent diagnosis of Hashimoto's which includes a whole set of aches and pains by itself. The Doctor just prescribed Neurontin to control the Neuropathy and said that it could help the Fibro as well,but I am almost afraid to try it. Does anyone else have experience with this drug ?"
Fibromyalgia,2zc4f2,dragonflyhopes,1 point,Wed Mar 18 02:01:50 2015 UTC,"I do, I was on Neurontin for years. As long as your does isn't too high (I was on 900, but I believe the normal dose is 1200-2400 I think, look it up), it is safe I believe. The only big thing was that it made me too sleepy. It helped falling asleep though I guess. But now I'm on Lyrica, it makes me less sleepy, but I can't think on it. It makes me into a ditz."

There may be a core group of symptoms that never change but there are many that do.  Things that don't change are the pain and fatigue.  Things that do are foods I can eat, tolerate certain smells and location of pain. Also anxiety seems to come and go. It's different for each of us but there are some similarities."

My initial Fibro diagnosis happened only 6 years ago, but my doctors think it actually started when I was extremely ill and diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes. Any time your body goes through some change, there's a good chance it's going to affect your Fibro somehow."
Fibromyalgia,2z8afe,alieber,1 point,Mon Mar 16 16:49:20 2015 UTC,"We think my fibro was dormant until I was really sick with bronchitis. I'm allergic to most antibiotics so when I caught bronchitis they tried everything before antibiotics, ended up being incredibly sick for 6 weeks and everything went downhill from there. I think that's common among fibromyalgia patients though, having it start with another illness."
Fibromyalgia,2z8afe,alieber,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:01:17 2015 UTC,"Sounds about right. It seems mine was sort of dormant for about 4 years. It wasn't until I was in therapy trying to deal with getting out of an abusive relationship that the pain really started. So maybe it doesn't have to be a physical trauma that triggers it, but could be a mental trauma too."

It works quite well and my 3 year old loves jumping on top of me while I do it.  I also use a strong electric massager that plugs into an A/C socket.  If I have a lot of tension in a particular spot I use a wheat filled heat bag that I can warm up in the microwave and place on my neck or shoulder while sitting down.

That isn't giving up.  That is living to fight another day.  It sounds to me like you are over-exerting yourself.  Fibro doesn't like over-exertion.  Try cutting back your exertion levels and see if your pain levels drop.  Part time work sounds like a great idea.  Moving back in with your parents sounds like a great idea too.

I try and hide it too most people dont know i have it but it just makes the whole situation so much more isolating. Maybe if you can find some sort of fibro or chronic pain support group in your area? that might give you people to talk to and you can even make some new friends.

I just told them I have this problem in my body where I feel very tired sometimes and certain parts of my body hurt for no reason.

We never had the talk that mom has this or that, cause I think we/it all feel into place. We knew what was going on, but where never told everything or how bad.  My mom also was active, at work being up and down with special needs kids and doing what she could. Even holding down two jobs to pay for my class ring and other things.

Just know this comes from a person who totally knows what you are going through and how fucking painful it is both physically and mentally.  Real talk:  -You have a ""bum knee"" that was already sore from work but you still ran a 7k and also planned to do a 5k obstacle and 5k color run.  Yet you say your body is freaking out ""for no apparent reason"".  Reading through your post, it was very clear what was going to happen. By ignoring your body's limits you are setting yourself up to fail.  It took me a long time to finally stop acting on how I wanted my body to be and to act how my body actually is, and it's the best thing I've ever done. By limiting myself my life became much more free. I rarely have flare ups that I did not expect and I finally have some sort of order instead of chaos.   It has also improved my relationships more than I can say. Before, ""random"" flare ups would fuck up everyone's plans at the last minute. Now I, and the people close to me, know what to expect and I am much more dependable.  Example: I recently traveled with a friend to europe. I let her know beforehand that our trip would be limited.  That I have to split up the day into 3 segments: morning, afternoon, evening. I can two 2 of 3 segments per day, but I have to rest for one, and I prefer to stay in evenings. From there we were able to create a schedule that worked for both of us.  Before I would have simply tried to do everything, deplete all my energy reserves halfway through the trip, flake out on plans (at the last minute decide I didn't want to go to dinner, or that museum, etc), get grumpy/bitchy because of the pain I was in, and ultimately crash and burn with everyone else having to deal with the consequences. This trip I was able to keep my energy consistent, we saw all of the major sites we wanted to visit, I was able to rest, and she didn't feel hindered by it. Both of us had an amazing time. Even though fibro affected our plans, it didn't dictate them.   The more you are honest with yourself, the more control you have over this disease.   I'm so sorry that you are going through this. I hope my words are helpful and not a kick them while they are down moment. It took me a really long time to learn this lesson myself and if I can help someone I feel obligated to try."
Fibromyalgia,2z485k,DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,2,Sun Mar 15 20:41:59 2015 UTC,"Slowing down doesn't have to be a bad thing. I know it's difficult because it feels like you're giving up so much, but try to focus on the positives of this. You have to rest more and take time to just chill. That means you have more time to learn about yourself, to read, to find good music, to watch more movies or TV shows, you could use your down time to learn from online resources (like Ted talks, free online lectures offered by certain universities, documentaries, just Google stuff you want to learn more about). You could use the time to read more about your illness to better understand it all and learn how to manage it better. It is definitely possible to be productive during your down time, which means you feel less like you're missing out. You could take up a new hobby which doesn't involve too much physical activity. There are good sides to this, you just have to allow yourself to find them.   Also, if you're thinking you might need a cane you should definitely try it out. You can pick one up off amazon for cheap. I got a folding one a while ago and it has seriously helped me so much. It folds up and fits in my bag so I can just carry it with me and use it when I need it. If I'm shopping and walking around, using it helps take off the pressure and I use a lot less energy because it helps me balance, which is a benefit I didn't expect honestly. So it helps the leg pain as well as my energy which is a total godsend. It's difficult feeling like I now LOOK sick/disabled and can no longer hide my illness, but the benefits far out way that."

First and foremost is a diagnosis from a rheumatologist or neurologist (not your primary care physician). Don't apply until you are able to secure that.   You need to have been disabled by your symptoms for at least 6 months and other diagnosis have to be excluded by various test.  You need to prove that you cannot work. This means you cannot work at least 4 hours a day for a total of 35 hours a week. You need to prove your physical limitations and have doctor documentation to back it up. This is different from being able to work with accommodation.   You need extensive amounts of medical records. If you can prove date of onset of symptoms that really helps your case a lot.  You need to be actively seeking treatment and taking whatever meds doctor has told you to try. You have to act like you are trying your best to be well.  It helps a lot for you to enter psychological counseling to prove how you are suffering emotionally because of disability.  Research your jurisdiction. There are some places where people are more likely to be denied because of the biases of local officials. If you live in a city with pain clinics on every corner, your prospects are going to be particularly bad. Also, make sure your doctors have a good reputation as well."

Assuming you are in the US you might want to look into a company to help with your application. http://www.allsup.com/ is one example, but I'm sure there are several. The best thing to know is that a company or disability lawyer cannot charge you unless you win your case. That's the law. When you win their fee comes out of your back payments if any are due, and it's capped as well. That's the route I'm about to take because I don't really see a downside to trying.

Fibromyalgia,2z2snm,Sprtghtly,2,Sun Mar 15 03:48:07 2015 UTC,"Well.  I developed PCOS during/after 5 yrs of infertility treatments.  I also had debilitating PMS for years.  After a lot of testing and shots to shut down my ovaries, it was decided they should be removed.  They were and my quality of life improved immensely.  However, during the painful PCOS days, I was developing fibro (I don't think it had a name then; everyone just told me to take motrin.)  Of course the doctors all wanted to medicate me for mental issues.  The only thing that helped was the xanax.  Around this time I also developed restless leg syndrome, chronic fatigue and interstitial cystitis.  Which came first, the chicken or the egg.  For me, the polycystic ovaries came first.  I believe these issues developed from my infertility treatments.  I have two lovely fantastic daughters to show for it.  But life has been beyond difficult because of it.  Whether or not this fits with your theory, I don't know.  My thyroid tests have always been normal.  I applaud your efforts. Thanks for the link."
Fibromyalgia,2z2snm,DBraTheZebra,2,Sun Mar 15 18:47:57 2015 UTC,That's what I mean though: they can test as normal but not BE normal. Normal levels don't necessarily mean normal sensitivity to those levels.  I don't think one necessarily causes the other. I'm just surprised at how linked they can appear.

Fibromyalgia,2z2snm,FibroMan,5,Tue Mar 17 16:18:16 2015 UTC,"I am well aware of the late Dr John Lowe's work in the area.  In my opinion he was a bit too enthusiastic about the link between thyroid problems and fibromyalgia.  He comes across as a bit of a psuedoscientist.  There is a lot of primary research that shows that most fibromyalgia patients are really suffering from something else.  I suspect that primary researchers are cherry picking their patients, because together the studies add up to well over 100%, a mathematical impossibility.  Personally, I don't have enough symptoms of thyroid disorder for me to consider trying a thyroid treatment.  With your symptoms it sounds more promising.  If you go ahead with the treatment then let us know how it goes."
Fibromyalgia,2z2snm,FibroMan,3,Sun Mar 15 02:04:06 2015 UTC,"As far as that guy goes, yeah. He seemed a little wacky.   This isn't all I've found; just the highlights. That said, I didn't mean to imply that I'd stumbled on a cure or anything not already known. I just wanted to present the possibility that such correlations seem to exist in some of us, especially if someone happens to have some of this suspicious overlap themselves.  Even minus all the PCOS talk, it's really fascinating how it may be (in some cases) related to some kind of metabolic dysfunction. And with the way all sorts of different disorders have these overlapping symptoms, I definitely believe that many different things can trigger fibro/CFS/related problems.   I'm just sharing any hope or angle I can find. Maybe this information will help somebody. I hope so."

And, of course, the first day I overreached, but instead of having to go to the hospital, the medic and I turned the walker into the transport chair, and a hotel employee simply pushed me back to my hotel room, where I recovered in peace.

It doesn't mean one caused the other. Anxiety and depression can definitely make fibro symptoms worse though, so treating them could actually help. I feel like people are just really reluctant to accept a fibro diagnosis when there are overlapping symptoms with other things. The good news is that there are medications meant to help depression and anxiety that also help fibro symptoms, and some of the things you should do to help your fibro symptoms (exercise, eating healthy, certain vitamins, etc) can help ease depression and anxiety. They just seem to go hand in hand."

Fibromyalgia,2yv9mo,EsotericKnowledge,3,Sat Mar 14 03:55:03 2015 UTC,"Before I had a fibro diagnosis I had a doctor who thought I had depression and anxiety.  Brain fog is a symptom of depression, sore tense muscles are a symptom of anxiety.  A doctor can't see how you are feeling inside, so proving that you don't have depression and anxiety is almost impossible.  For me, the clue that I didn't have anxiety was sore fingers.  Tense muscles from anxiety don't cause soreness in fingers where you have tendons, not muscle."

Fibromyalgia,2yv9mo,Geawiel,3,Fri Mar 13 03:51:03 2015 UTC,"I went through this with the air force before I got a diagnosis (years after I was out.)  At the time, the pain was slightly worse than it is now.  I also had a much harder time with the fog and had many blackout events.  Events where my body went into autopilot and I had no memory of the time transpired.  They lasted from a few seconds to 30 mins.  Now, on to what the two different therapist told me.  For something to be in your head, you usually don't respond to medication.  Especially so for pain.  Since I responded to medicine, even though it wasn't fully able to get rid of the pain, it proved it was not in my head.  For me, I was abused as a kid and had a terrible time in school from 5th to 11th.  So, I never got a rest.  This has given me pretty bad anxiety, dysthymic disorder, depressive disorder, pretty bad insomnia and leaves me extremely uncomfortable in crowds.  Since getting a diagnosis and getting things back on track for my family (we lost a house and had to file ch 7 when I was put out), depression symptoms have almost completely melted away.  I haven't had a black out episode since being put out and financial problems have settled.  I've worked on the anxiety and can somewhat manage in a crowd, though it makes me very irritable.  I'd suggest at least talking with someone.  If nothing else, it can help take some of the strain off of the mental portion of this.  For the fog, I have found ways to manage.   Take notes all the time.  Do not rely on 'it's just a small thing, I'll remember it'...you won't.   When you do have to rely on just your memory, try to concentrate on just 1 thing about the memory.  I had worked on lucid dreaming years before fibro set in.  To remember, I would concentrate on something as simple as the grass.  Start describing how it looked, how it felt, how it smelt.  Everything else will start to come from there. You can also shut other senses out by shutting your eyes.  I still have some issues coming up with even simple words at times, something not usual for me.  Shutting my eyes cuts out the distraction of sight, and allows me to mentally sort through words and find the right one.  The same thing works for doing math problems in my head, something I used to be really good at.   Ease into everything else.  Anxiety can be overcome, but it isn't a quick thing.  It will take years, and likely help from friends to do it.  Again, talking with a therapist may help with that.  At the very least, they can give you strategies that will work for you."

Start with an appointment with your OB/Gyn and bring your list of meds with you.  They often know more about what can/can't be taken during pregnancy than your regular doctor.    This is not something to mess up. If you're taking the wrong meds and get pregnant, some of the potential effects on the fetus are pretty serious and you could end up with a child with mental or physical disabilities or serious health issues.   I had two MISERABLE pregnancies with several hospitalizations.  I threw up the whole 9 months both times, lost so much weight I was put on IV feedings, and had a lot of complications (including getting in a really bad car accident on the freeway, not my fault btw) and did it all with no meds (aside from the really I don't believe it did anything regular strenth Tylenol) because I wanted healthy kids.    And why did I have the second knowing how bad it was the first time you might ask?  Well I actually thought it couldn't possibly be as bad the second time and was crazy.  That's really the only explanation I can come up with.  I lost 30 pounds in my first trimester alone both times.  On the day my son was born, before I gave birth, I weighed a lot less than when I got pregnant.  I lost about 30 pounds even with the extra baby weight.  About 50 pounds down after giving birth.  And I wasn't overweight before the pregnancy.  But I love my kids, and they are so close and really love each other.  I feel very lucky in spite of it all.    So, TLDR: Talk to your OB/Gyn doctor!"

Depending on how informed your OBGYN is about your particular medications, s/he may refer you to an MFM (high risk OB) to discuss medication usage in pregnancy.  There is a database they use to look up potential birth defects called ReproTox.  During my pregnancy, I was allowed to take Flexeril (category B).  It did help, but there were many days where I was still in considerable pain.  I just had an appointment with the MFM to discuss medication usage for a second pregnancy.

I'm a mom of 3 and was diagnosed after my second baby was born (she was literally about a month old). I've always had fibro but it went undiagnosed for the majority of my life. I've had my diagnosis for 5 years now.   I've been on so many different medications and was never able to deal with the side effects of them. I was in really awful shape and to the point where I could barely function, probably should have been on disability, etc. for many many years. It's been a very long road, but I am living med free and essentially in what I consider to be ""remission"" as much as is possible with fibro. I've still got the occasional flare but it usually only lasts a max of 2-3 days and it's not often.   What helped me was finally identifying my triggers and learning how to avoid them. For me, that was extensive food sensitivity testing (chicken and beets immediately send me into a flare, food coloring gives me horrible emotional side effects, brown rice makes me rage), lifestyle changes (exercise, getting enough sleep), knowing my limits, and avoiding stressor's as much as possible. This is a really simplified sampling of the road I have taken to get where I am, but my point is that it IS possible to get to live a mostly normal life.   So, if I were in your position, my method would most likely be to start looking at holistic solutions (which may actually have the side benefit of aiding your fertility as well) with the intent of getting pregnant in the next few years.

Fibromyalgia,2yr61x,fibrofightinggirl09,1 point,Sun Mar 15 22:32:54 2015 UTC,"Pharm student. You can take Tylenol with NSAIDS (Advil-ibuprofen, alive-naproxen, mobic-Meloxicam, Celebrex) but try not to use NSAIDs together... They all carry cardiovascular risks and you are increasing your risk when combining. NSAIDs have no effect on fibro based on the randomized controlled trial studies I looked at. And it isn't really an inflammatory condition.   Additionally, Tylenol is not an NSAID or non sterol anti inflammatory, it's an analgesic and antipyretic.  When used together with NSAIDs can increase bleeding risk."

They did endoscopies to check it out and biopsy and then I just couldn't stop bleeding so I had to take sucralfate which coats your insides and I drank a lot of juiced vegetables to get stronger! The pediatric gastroenterologists told me that I had been taking advil so much for so long that I basically had no stomach lining and I could never take an NSAID again :/ Which is a bummer, but hopefully you have lots of stomach lining and can take your meds with lots of liquids to protect yours! And they told me walking after taking meds helps digestion so I always try to walk even if it's slow and painful!"

This gives me a reason to really back off of the NSAIDs as much as possible though, now. Luckily, I don't mind the idea of that since they barely help me. I usually eat something to coat my tummy though when I do take them! Never on an empty stomach."

Fibromyalgia,2yr61x,omnirusted,2,Thu Mar 12 05:23:19 2015 UTC,OTC drugs do nothing for me. I can take Aleve for headaches and it helps but it can't touch my fibromyalgia pain.

When I was a teen and had pain from various injuries n stuff, and they offered tylenol 3, I would tell them dont bother they dont work. Somehow it feels like there is a connection with those meds not working and todays pain."
Fibromyalgia,2yr61x,_zenith,2,Thu Mar 12 13:13:01 2015 UTC,Story of my life since I've had Fibromyalgia.  I don't think it's because of tolerance.  I tried taking NSAIDs after I was diagnosed at 14.  Motrin or Tylenol didn't make any difference.
Fibromyalgia,2yr61x,kiwiburd,2,Thu Mar 12 21:12:43 2015 UTC,"When I was little I didn't know what Tylenol was for because of this. The grownups kept telling me it was for headaches, but it didn't get rid of my headaches, so I thought it was some weird placebo or the grownups were messing with me or something. (Turned out my headaches were migraines and I was probably having migraines as a child also.) As an adult, Tylenol still does absolutely nothing for any kind of pain that I have. Excedrin helps my headaches, I get some minor relief of fibro pain from Aleve, and Advil helps menstrual cramps, but Tylenol still might as well be a sugar pill. It's amazing to me that a pill that does so little for what it's supposed to treat is as destructive to the liver as it actually is."
Fibromyalgia,2yr61x,mrsclause2,1 point,Sat Mar 14 23:08:30 2015 UTC,"First post I respond to in r/fibromyalgia, and I picked this one. My boss is going to kill me.  FM is basically caused by your nerves not getting used to the pain you're in over a long period of time. Nerves don't acclimatize to pain like we think they would. Instead they go, ""Crap, all this pain is blocking out our ability to detect injury! We have to go MORE SENSITIVE!"" Your regular nerves then create new branches to become more sensitive, which is why sometimes a brush of wind can feel like fire.  If you take pain medication it will actually cause your nerve condition to get worse. OTC pain meds are designed to, in a way, block your pain receptors from communicating with your brain so you notice the pain you're in. If this is happening and your nerves are already freaking out due to FM, then your nerves will just get worse and you will require more and more doses of pain medication to feel the same effects.  I really hope I'm making sense. I have a 100 fever right now, and can't take anything for it for these exact reasons. It wouldn't do any good."

If this is happening and your nerves are already freaking out due to FM, then your nerves will just get worse and you will require more and more doses of pain medication to feel the same effects.   Actually, it's not just fibro it's all pain conditions that are like this. It's the same for arthritis, lupus, and other medical conditions. This is why doctors say pain meds (prescription like Vicodin for example) are addictive. They temporarily block the pain, then you feel it even more when it wears off, and thus you need more until you build a tolerance. I've heard that speech from doctors so many times I have it memorized; so I know where you're coming from. However, it's not just fibro, it's all pain disorders that can lead to dependence because your brain gets used to the feeling of 'no more pain'. I wouldn't say, however, that it makes things worse - it just makes you need more medicine.  This is why I'm trying to just not take anything other than what I'm given by my doctor which is actually anti-anxiety medicine that helps. OTC NSAIDs and others like that just make things worse or they don't help at all, like you said."

Fibromyalgia,2yr61x,_zenith,1 point,Fri Mar 13 03:37:32 2015 UTC,"Sort of, it occurs to varying degrees, some sensitisation occurs literally within the nerves (neuropathic pain) and has a very different quality to it, whereas central sensitisation (hyperalgesia) is centered in the brain and as such is somewhat less treatable (though neuropathic isn't exactly easy to treat either :| )... more systems to be hit with collateral damage. Actually, central sensitisation even causes quite bad brain damage over time :(  Almost all pain disorders result in some level of central sensitisation, but the relative levels of this contributing factors vary quite a bit from type to type.  IMO, fibromyalgia is a little from column A, a little from column B: central component (probably related to notorious fibro fog) which amplifies some nerve sensitivity. Plus maybe some dysfunction at the actual pain source site - last I heard, dysfunction in hot/cold sensors in skin on limbs causing blood flow to be badly regulated (by controlling blood vessel dilation) was the promising research direction..."

I also tried steroids and they didn't work.  I see others requesting information on meds, and since this is more than a ""flare-up"", I'm searching for alternatives.  I'll speak to my doctor about it on Monday.  He never offered because I never asked.  Good advice about the appearance of being out for medicine...

Fibromyalgia,2yo52c,Omnomnomnissiah,8,Wed Mar 11 12:16:24 2015 UTC,"I have gotten the ""this is it, good luck"" talk about 8 years ago (fibro and cfs for the past 18 years give or take, diagnosed 12 years ago)  At that time I was 18, and I already had to quit school, sports and a lot of other things I've loved a few years before. Currently I've been on pain management, seeing an immunologist and rheumatologist every few years for a status update. (""still sick? Yep. Oh okay, keep doing what you're doing, cya in a few years! "")  Honestly the first few years after stopping treatments were hard. I felt like we didn't try everything, and there must be something that'll work on me besides pain management. Every article I read about potential causes made me call my specialists to ask what was going on. It was very hard to accept that I couldn't find a specialist with the answer to all my problems, and that made me angry and sad.  About 6 years ago I had somewhere of a breakdown, and that has been the turning point in my life. I started being honest about how I felt that day, started accepting that when something comes up that might be helpful to my health my specialists will inform me, and tried to find positive things to focus.  I've stopped expecting there to be a cure in the next decade, and instead try to make it workable as it is right now. The disappointment of dead ends was devastating, and I feel a lot more at peace just dealing with things day to day. If my specialist calls with something to try, I'll happily oblige, but I'm not letting my happiness be dictated by being sick anymore.  I wish I could tell you something that instantly makes everything better for you, but I can't. For me it's been a long road with lots of anger, sadness and crying, but as of right now I'm really doing well even when my body refuses to cooperate with the rest of me. It's okay to be angry, and if you feel like crying you should go for it. I've pretended for years and it only made things worse, so my advice would be to be honest about how you feel.

Fibromyalgia,2yo52c,InaccuratePsychic,1 point,Thu Mar 12 03:15:42 2015 UTC,"Yes it really does. Right when I first got sick I was in grief counseling therapy, then after my diagnosis I got invited to join a research project at the hospital where they research the impact of chronic pain on teenagers.  One of the early conclusions from there was that you went through very similar emotions as one would with grief.  I know it sounds cliche, and I realise it's not the same for everyone, but for me it got a lot better after working out stuff. Of course some days are still sucky and sometimes I just wanna scream with frustration, but those days are a lot less frequent now.  If you feel like you need it, you could look into counseling specifically for people our age in the same boat. There's also fora you could join, they're usually pretty active!

I've taken part in a project that looked between the emotional/mental health of those with a chronic illness and, while you learn a lot of neat skills, it's one thing to be able to use them when the going is good, and another thing entirely when it all hits the proverbial fan. This board is the only point of contact I have with the Fibro community, so that's another thing I'll be looking into over the next few days.

My hope is to achieve 90% normalcy. just a few setbacks of pain, but an improvement from where I am now. If I keep hoping for the best, and it doesn't work out, then I'm disappointed.  But if is does come out super well, then I'm over the moon. My mom says it's being negative, but I say it's being realistic, and avoiding disappointment. So far it's worked. I had settled for having developed a chronic sinus infection (I had it about 4 months) and resigned to the fact that I would need an ENT. After a final stab at it with some antibiotics and prednisone, I actually kicked it! At least I'm 95% over this sinus infection. I am so relieved and happy! But if I put too much stock in that last round of treatment, I would just have been upset.  So I'm not expecting a cure for fibro in the next 10 years. I see it as a possibility,  but I'm not hoping for it. Though I'm hoping for improvements in treatment.   My shift in thinking has helped me deal with the fact that I am young and in pain.  I know it completely sucks, and it's not ideal, the situation you're in, but I really wish you the best. Maybe there's some combination of meds that will work. I would try revisiting drugs as well. Our bodies change over time, and I have found that things that worked for me in the past don't anymore, and vice versa."

Unfortunately, I agree with you that they need to learn a hell of a lot more about fibro and all it's friends before we're likely to see something major happen.  The only drug that we found worked for me was Duloxetine/Cymbalta, and we had to stop that due to the fact that it was actually causing me to lactate out of one boob (gogo cancer scare) so there's no chance I can go back to that."

There is a growing push from adult patients to get access to this type of treatment because about 30% of their fibro patients finish pain free... including those that finish pain free about 50% finish with pain levels of 1 or less. On average patients go from a 6.5 to a 2. Outcome pain levels are documented to be well sustained at one year post treatment. Regardless of pain resolution almost all patients finish fully functional with above average aerobic abilities. The programs are no joke though, they do hard, heavy PT and OT for about 7 hours a day for 2-4 weeks. The first week, especially, is very hard to push through and overuse injuries are common. Many adults have researched and replicated these programs with their own physician, counselor, and PT."

Once I'm in a position to use it again, I'll give it another try.    If it's already in the cream you're using, then it's too bad it isn't helping.  :(  Are you able to do any kind of exercise at all?  Walking even counts as exercise.  I found that and swimming to be a big help.  Lots of people here like yoga, too.  They even have ""Gentle Yoga"" classes at some places.  When I went to that class, it was mostly elderly people, and I found it to be really easy.  In contrast, the regular level 1 class was pretty challenging for me."
Fibromyalgia,2ylo6w,YouDoNotKnowWhoIAm,1 point,Tue Mar 10 20:58:26 2015 UTC,Best of luck. I'm moving to Orlando this summer and am dreading finding new doctors.
Fibromyalgia,2ylo6w,lbsmith5,1 point,Tue Mar 10 22:45:24 2015 UTC,"Kimberley Wilson. They say they won't treat you if you only have fibro, but will coordinate with your PCP if that's the case. I don't think they require any referrals, I just made an appointment by calling. It'll take you 2-4 months to get in but she's wonderful.   Rattandeep (I think) Singh was who I saw first. He pawned me off on his PA and saw me for all of five minutes, but to his credit he ran a nuclear bone scan that got me my rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis (I haven't seen anyone else posting about bone scintigraphies) and he gave me tramadol first appointment. The PA was nice enough. I just was there to see the doc so I was annoyed.   Wilson is my primary now, but you might mesh differently with them. Those are the two big docs in Atlanta. Kimberly also works with her husband so you could just see who has openings first."

I was referred to her by my PCP in the same building, but I'm not sure if she requires a referral. She's a rheumatologist and is trying to treat my fibro symptoms by correcting my sleep issues. She is very open to discussion and speaks in a way that is easy to understand."

Fibromyalgia,2yhqxf,FibroMan,1 point,Tue Mar 10 11:44:40 2015 UTC,"No, criticism is absolutely welcome!  I'll never get it right without input.  The quote is actually taken from a thread on /r/fibro where people were asked to describe their pain/what it feels like to have fibro.  It was a beautiful and moving statement, so I wanted to use it, but it's also important for the message to be somewhat clear.  Thanks so much for your input!"
Fibromyalgia,2yhqxf,FibroMan,1 point,Tue Mar 10 18:25:32 2015 UTC,"I think it would be clearer if it was part of a longer video.  If you explain how fibro is difficult to explain first, then the scrunched up paper analogy would make more sense."

Fibromyalgia,2ygy04,stubbornness,3,Mon Mar 9 19:01:39 2015 UTC,"I am pretty well versed in opiods and so careful with them, but I had never heard of this patch.  Have you Googled this medication? It has a TON of warnings and says explicitly that it is ""for opiod experienced patients only."" I am shocked this was prescribed to you as a first opiod! Generally, they start with the weakest medicine that will work for you, like Tramadol and if your pain doesn't improve you are slowly worked up to Norco, then Percocet, Oxycontin, etc. You really need to find a second opinion doctor. Ask your primary care doctor for help. No wonder you're sleeping so much, this sounds like it's a really strong opiod.  Honestly, it scares me! As your body gets used to opiods, you build up a tolerance and they don't work as well. That's why I'm so careful about upping my prescription strength. You don't want to get to a place where you have nothing to go up to. Excercise can just be a walk around the neighborhood. Here's the link to the page I found on this medication http://www.drugs.com/pro/butrans-patch.html. You know something isn't right, you need to listen to your intuition. Good luck, I'm worried about you.  Keep us posted. 💕"
Fibromyalgia,2ygy04,GalacticMirror,2,Mon Mar 9 22:12:52 2015 UTC,"I googled it originally when I was coming out of my overdose, however I did not find this website! That being said, I was also very light headed and struggling to concentrate at all. One of my very close friends found where it said not to start me so high when I have no opiod experience. I'm more surprised about being prescribed an opiod at all this early! I was only diagnosed on Halloween and am still on the initial medicine given to me upon diagnosis. I usually have a high tolerance to meds anyways but I knew something sounded wrong to him saying he thought I'd have such a high tolerance to opiods. I'm very cautious about medicines, especially for someone my age. I'm hoping to get in with my primary care doctor soon and get this straightened out. I just don't like going against the doctors."
Fibromyalgia,2ygy04,GalacticMirror,2,Tue Mar 10 01:36:43 2015 UTC,"I was exactly like you, my family treats doctors orders like an order from God not to be questioned. The problem I've found with fibro/CFS is that not all doctors are educated about it. Every single doctor I've have has a different understanding & approach. It's very frustrating when your rheumatologist contradicts your primary, who then insists he was right and I must have misunderstood, then pain management takes a whole different approach, you get totally depressed from just being exhausted and in pain all the time because this is dragging out so many years, so you go to a therapist, who then refers you to a psychiatrist for depression & anxiety meds. If I've learned anything, it's that you've got to educate yourself. It seems doctors will only consider any information that you share if it's from the NIH, WebMd, etc. They do not take fibro support sites seriously. This is a comforting place to come to see that others are in your shoes, feel your pain, share what they've tried and learned through their journey, commiserate without feeling like you're complaining, and sometimes just plain verify your sanity. Just remember, there are great doctors and those who just barely made it through. Some doctors are passionate, some that are just too busy to keep abreast of all the new studies, protocols, etc. Be careful love, you have a lot of living left to do. TL/DR: Educate yourself, doctors are human and blind trust may hurt you in the long run."
Fibromyalgia,2ygy04,Gr33n_Rider,2,Tue Mar 10 04:35:10 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to tell you what to do, but I think it might be a good idea to find another doctor. If I've learned anything from Fibro it's to trust your gut. This goes doubly so for someone who has already been irresponsible and put you in danger like this guy. Please, please find another doctor. I learned this the hard way too by finding out my doctor had prescribed me fatally interacting meds for the Fibro. If your doc has made a careless decision like this once, most likely he will do it again. Consider looking in to Tramadol. It's a lighter opioid and I've been on it a year and a half at 50mg twice a day. I'd be lost without it. Pm me if you want to talk about meds or anything else, I with you luck with this. :)"
Fibromyalgia,2ygy04,Deelia,1 point,Wed Mar 11 15:29:36 2015 UTC,Well luckily I will have to soon. I currently live alone in a different state than any family and since I can no longer support myself I have to move in with my mom. She lives in KY but is trying to move to Nashville soon. Both places have way better doctors than the small town I'm in. I love my family doctor but she's the first out of around 10 I've liked. Her and my neurologist are cool. The others are complete idiots I swear.
Fibromyalgia,2ygy04,FibroMan,1 point,Thu Mar 12 03:40:20 2015 UTC,I'm on opioids  and 200mg caffeine pills are a godsend. Also once you become more used to and tolerant to opiates (a week maybe?) You will be able to pee like normal again.
Fibromyalgia,2ygy04,lbsmith5,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:02:10 2015 UTC,I know I was having problems for 2 weeks on the patch. Then he lowered my dose. I haven't filled that prescription because of fear of something not being right. It took me 3 or 4 days being off them to go back to normal. My kidneys/bladder are just crazy sensitive.
Fibromyalgia,2ygy04,kiwiburd,1 point,Tue Mar 10 00:59:13 2015 UTC,"Doctors know the best general advice to give to patients.  As an individual patient, general information is nice, but what I really need to know is what will work for me.  I don't care if a particular drug works well for most people.  If it doesn't work for me I am not going to keep taking it.  The prescription system was really designed for other illnesses.  With Fibro you need to try lots of different drugs, even the ones that are unlikely to work, just in case they do the job for you.  You need to experiment with different doses until you are on the minimum dose that is still effective.  Then you need to try different drug combinations to see which ones work best together.  Benefits need to be weighed up against side effects.  It's complicated, but since fibro doesn't go away on its own there is plenty of time to experiment."
Fibromyalgia,2yeyl3,auntiechrist23,9,Mon Mar 9 05:44:10 2015 UTC,"Alllllll the time. My GP says my autonomous nervous system is malfunctionin, hence my body not being able to regulate its own temperature properly, sweating, intestinal turmoil, nausea, dizzyness, thirst, elevated heart-rate, and other such nonsense that suddenly comes along and ruins your moment.  All I can do is layers. Go somewhere, feel warm, take of four layers, put one back on. 5 minutes later, okay, let's make that two. three. Nope, one. No, nothing. No, cold, I need all the layers!"
Fibromyalgia,2yeyl3,Maegaranthelas,2,Mon Mar 9 10:33:17 2015 UTC,"I thought all this was only me, I go everywhere in layers no matter the weather. 110 degrees out and I will still have a cardigan and jacket with me. My friends no longer razz me for it and in inclement weather one or more tends to have an extra jacket handy for me.   Now the dizziness, does it just come up out of nowhere. I have had dizzy come and go, but now it comes and stays longer. Saturday it was so bad I couldn't move, when I did i started to vomit. I couldn't walk or even crawl a straight line. I am still having it just not so severe that I vomit, but I am extremely nauseous."

I guess I can only hope it will go away. i know right now with the PT my doctor insists I do i am in a month long phase of pain, that seems to make it all worse, but with time hopefully everything will get better."
Fibromyalgia,2yeyl3,capatiller,2,Mon Mar 9 20:15:56 2015 UTC,"I had the nausea for a very long time, and it only got better after I focused more on myself (so yes, PT and exercising even though it sucks), and didn't put myself in so many stressful sitations.

I had to cut out most exercise for awhile due to health issues, so now I am building back up to being what I call a ""normal"" person. I know much pain will accompany that for the first month or two and then I will feel better. But I usually can eat throughout that. i guees I will go back to the doc and ask if there is something else I can do. The vertigo and nausea are seriously impacting on life now.  Thank you for the encouragement and congratulations, it actually means a lot to hear that. I didn't realize how much I do a day in addition to working until I typed that up."

Bring a single mom, I have a bf, if I don't work I can't afford health insurance for me or my child. Currently with all my doc appointments,  I feel like I am working only to go to docs.   I do my best and work hard through the day. Most days by the time I get home I am spent and veg on my couch. I am down to making dinner only 3 or 4 times a week which is awful, but my daughter is grown and can fend for herself now. All my life I have had the mindset and in truth it is how my world works, if I don't do it, no one else will. So I just do it.

Fibromyalgia,2yeyl3,Maegaranthelas,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:27:43 2015 UTC,"I will keep that in mind. I just feel like there is always something wrong and the docs must think I am a hypochondriac.

Also, if I get any direct heat on me from a heater vent, I overheat insanely quickly. This is saying something considering I have long been considered ""the ice princess""   Definitely one of the more unpleasant things for me."

Any movement at all is incredibly painful, so on those days I pile on layers (2 shirts, 2 pants, 2 pairs of socks, 3 blankets and sometimes even a robe). It seems I have a 5 degree leeway in tolerance. I've also found a bath or shower is the best method to controlling my temp, which isn't always an option. In that case, I gulp down ice water and use the oil blotters I keep in my purse to try to soak up all the sweat on my face without ruining my makeup. I use a brand from Sephora, boscia, that smells great."

I also feel overly hot in general and have a difficult time cooling down.  When I was still in the military, I would bring 2 BDU shirts to work.  I'd freeze one, then wear the other.  After about 20 mins, I would swap them out so that I am now wearing the frozen one and the other is in the freezer.  I'd have to do this even in the middle of winter in Wa state.  Everyone else thought I was crazy.  My problem with overheating is that it now triggers migraines a lot.  I keep my hair short so that doesn't contribute, and I have to sometimes sit with an ice pack to cool down if it starts to get too bad.  I have to be careful with fans as well.  When the skin on my legs is exposed to moving air below a certain temp (around 70 degs F) it feels like they are being sanded by rough grit sandpaper.  Feeling too hot isn't something I had to deal with in the past.  I grew up in Florida and had previously been fine with the heat.  I'm dreading the summer here in Wa state this year.  We've had an extremely mild winter, and it has already been shorts weather for the past week."

I have both and the cfs i didnt even know i had untill my doctor tested how i slept. I didnt even know it at the time but i had severe sleep loss which triggered cfs. I was so sleep deprived that i couldnt even tell the difference and was honestly surprised that i was not even hitting my deep sleep modes. Are you sleeping thru the night? do you often wake up thru the night, even if it is sudden waking and going back to sleep, it can effect you going into a proper deep sleep. Does your jaw sometimes hurt or your throat?maybe discuss with you DR. about your symtoms?"

Fibromyalgia,2yeyuq,Jleinss,4,Mon Mar 9 05:47:30 2015 UTC,"Tough position to be in.  Basically, as far as I can tell, the only thing you can do is straight up not push the person.  We people with fibro in pretty much 100% of cases push ourselves too hard already. The difficulty for us is in stopping ourselves from pushing too far all the time. Very often, once we're hurting, it's already too late.  I have a fitbit which has helped immensely- knowing exactly how much exercise I've done in a given day, and not doing more no matter how good I might feel.  Odds are your patient will have a reasonable idea of where their limits lie, but they might not. In that case, be prepared for a trial and error approach at first, where they find out where the line is by crossing it and going too far a few times. Once you've worked out between you where their ""safe limit"" lies, though, DON'T CROSS IT."
Fibromyalgia,2yeyuq,ZanSquid,3,Mon Mar 9 10:10:00 2015 UTC,"Of course, the safe limit is defined as what doesn't wipe you out for the next 3 days ;)"
Fibromyalgia,2yeyuq,FibroMan,3,Mon Mar 9 11:25:17 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I'm not quite what you're asking for, but hopefully can at least give you some insight...  I've have fibromyalgia diagnosed since October 2013. That's when all of my symptoms went into high gear and my doctor diagnosed me when I went in for something unrelated.   Before my diagnosis I was a relatively in-shape person who could do 'normal' activity. Play with and walk the puppy, go for a run, do a grocery store run by myself. Chores, lifting 25 pounds, no sweat.    I wasn't a gym bunny by any definition but I was in functional shape.   In about three months, I deteriorated to the point that I couldn't stand or walk up stairs on my own. Trying to sit up made my entire body shake (it still does on bad days). Basically any task you do without thinking, I could barely do at best. I think the highlight of my pathetic weakness was either needing two hands to lift a glass of water, or being unable to roll over.   I'm really not telling you this for pity points or whatever, I have a point I swear. In April I got to a point where I was able to give exercise a real try. Since then I have seen a trainer once a week. I don't cancel - if I am physically capable of getting there, I'm there. If I can't be there, I will be the next day. What started as barely 15 minutes from walking in the door to leaving is now an hour at least once a week (I really have to get better at going in on my own).  My very long winded point is, fibro knocks you down to an absurd level. Everyone has their  own rate of recovery. After nearly a year I'm just now starting to get to actually use my muscles close to their potential. My trainer has basically been my physical therapist in all of this. She helps me figure out the balance, helps me keep from doing harm while also making progress.   If you want to talk about what I do when I'm at the gym I'm more than happy to, I just am going to stop here for now because apparently right now I'm sleep deprived and cannot stop typing..."
Fibromyalgia,2yeyuq,skyqween,2,Mon Mar 9 08:14:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with all this. I have no clue how someone  with fibro is doing crossfit, but go them! Pretty much what a light workout to you could put us out for a week or cause enough  pain to go to urgent care. Atleast that was me and a half hour of yoga...im also 23 and average  body type..."
Fibromyalgia,2yeyuq,fibrofightinggirl09,2,Thu Mar 12 05:29:23 2015 UTC,"My coworkers are heavily into Crossfit.  I wanted to join them, but I was concerned about what the fast repetition would do to me.  I'm a really competitive person, so I tend to not listen to my body during workouts and I end up paying the price later.  FYI: Rheumatologists tell Fibromyalgia seek out low impact exercises (like aerobics, ellipticals, pilates) and avoid contact sports.    I'd make sure they're lifting significantly smaller weights than everyone else, especially since repetitions are such a huge thing with Crossfit."

Fibromyalgia,2yduz7,crumpledlife,7,Sun Mar 8 23:26:39 2015 UTC,"I couldn't relate to this more. I've always watched a lot of TV (and movies/played video games etc) for the same reason. Well except before my illness it was more of an emotional thing. But anyway, I find that breaking it up helps. Try to only watch TV when lying down/resting and you're too unwell to read or learn stuff online or go for a walk. Whatever your hobbies are - if you're too sick for that then watching stuff could just be your last resort.   I also find that watching really good movies or really good shows online (you could get a decent HDMI for cheap and hook your laptop up to your TV) is much better than mindless TV I'm not really interested in, it's not only a much more engaging distraction but watching one good show is far more satisfying as like 3-4 hours of bad TV. I don't know if that would work for you too. But if lying down watching stuff really is your only option, you could watch educational shows or like instructional videos or cooking shows, stuff that you can learn from. That way you feel like you're not wasting your time, and you could really learn some useful stuff. I'm not sure on specifics but I know some universities have free online lectures anyone can watch. Ted talks are also good and they're short enough that they're nice for people with short attention spans.  Other things you could try - audio books! Music. Video games which challenge your mind and your reflexes, and are good for problem solving skills. Crafts. Writing. Card games/board games with family or friends."
Fibromyalgia,2yduz7,Laur-Ent,4,Mon Mar 9 00:23:50 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that breaking it up helps me, too. I actually don't have regular tv - just Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime - so I pick what I want to watch. If I watch movies, I'm better at breaking the chunks of time up & engaging in other activities. But once I start a tv series, I'm completely useless until I've finished the series."
Fibromyalgia,2yduz7,Laur-Ent,1 point,Mon Mar 9 00:38:50 2015 UTC,"I never really binge watch shows, and I'm not sure if it's because I'm usually watching 3-4 different series's around the same time or if it's because I get bored easily. Would it help you if you tried to limit the episodes to 1 a day? That also spaces it out so you can appreciate shows for longer."
Fibromyalgia,2yduz7,Laur-Ent,1 point,Mon Mar 9 00:49:58 2015 UTC,"I tend to get completely absorbed by the stories & characters. The same thing happens to me with books. I'll read an entire series all the way through. Multiple times. And, once I'm in the story world, nothing else sounds appealing. While doing other things, I'm always thinking a little bit about what is going to happen next in the story.  But I don't have a very good long-term memory. It's really difficult for me to put a book or tv show down for 24 hours and remember what happened last time.  Obviously, I'm getting some kind of emotional fulfillment from watching these shows (or reading the books). By absorbing myself in these imaginary worlds for days or a week at a time, I'm able to pretend my real life isn't full of pain.   So maybe my question needs to be different. Maybe it should be, ""How do I find the same kind of pleasure in real-life activities that I do in imaginary worlds, while dealing with constant pain?"""
Fibromyalgia,2yduz7,8_Circuit_Brain,2,Mon Mar 9 01:06:48 2015 UTC,"Ah I see! Well, this definitely isn't for everyone and it may not be realistic for you but something that helps me a lot is weed. It's always an instant cure for nausea and sleep problems (for me anyway) and often helps pain but not always. Something that I didn't expect from it however is how it'd help me mentally. Basically it makes everything interesting in a different way. So if I'm in pain and unable to concentrate because I can't think of anything except pain, I can get high and suddenly it's far easier to get distracted and lose myself in whatever it is I'm doing.   If you're still struggling, I suggest looking for books that help people dealing with illnesses like ours. I can't personally recommend anything because I haven't read anything yet. But perhaps that's what you need to acquire the tools you need to deal with the mental side of this. Or cognitive behavioral therapy could be a very good option too. Things might not get easier physically right now, but things can always get better mentally."
Fibromyalgia,2yduz7,Laur-Ent,2,Mon Mar 9 04:04:29 2015 UTC,"This is excellent advice. Until we find something better to replace our habits, we can at least utilize them and make them work for us!"

With TV, it would end up being a case of I'll do it after this episode, whereas with podcasts it's just in my ear.  I've become a comedy fan and have found that doing some laugh therapy while doing more painful tasks like walks and housework helps to ease the pain and level things out a bit."

Fibromyalgia,2ycdfb,FibroMan,2,Mon Mar 9 18:52:04 2015 UTC,"You can get gluten free bread and gluten free pasta, for about double the cost of normal bread and pasta.  The problem is that you can't eat ANYTHING without checking the ingredients.   If you can't check the ingredients then you can't have it.  You can ask for gluten free at restaurants, which reduces your menu significantly, plus you never really know for sure whether the cook accidentally added something with gluten in it.  To avoid trace amounts of gluten you have to avoid anything with sugar in it, because glucose can be derived from wheat.  You can't even have french fries unless they were cooked in separate oil to the oil used for battered food."
Fibromyalgia,2ycdfb,Merkinfumble,2,Tue Mar 10 01:04:57 2015 UTC,"This is true if you are Celiac, but if you are gluten intolerant you don't need to be quite so pedantic about it.

I just wish gluten free bread and other products weren't so damn expensive."

Fibromyalgia,2y66yf,FibroMan,6,Fri Mar 13 16:47:17 2015 UTC,"It totally sucks how people with chronic pain are treated like criminals.  It also sucks that some doctors think that keeping you alive is all they need to do.  You can be bankrupt, homeless and unable to function but that is okay because there is nothing medically wrong with you.  I can't believe they just cut your meds off like that, with no tapering at all.  The whole situation is awful.  I hope you find a way to sort it out."
Fibromyalgia,2y66yf,zebra-stampede,7,Sat Mar 7 03:56:35 2015 UTC,"The first practice I went to was like that. In Georgia, tramadol went from nothing to like a class 4 scheduled drug via a new DEA thing after my first appointment and before my second. That effectively invalidated all prescriptions and required a new one to be given to the pharmacy. I was new to drugs at this point so I didn't exactly understand but I called the office and told them the pharmacy required a new script. The nurse on the phone was an entire bitch and accused me of seeking out drugs. I was so frustrated because it wasn't my fault it got invalidated. A few days later I got a different nurse on the phone who knew what was going on. I was on hydrocodone for a while and they surprise drug tested me one time with a nurse who was on day 2 of their new job who attempted to make me sign a document for the test without reading said document and without telling me who was paying for the test and without telling me why it was being done. I threw a fit until someone explained what was going on. For your situation I'd just go over there in person and say you aren't leaving until you see the doctor. Tramadol is like a JV drug in pain management anyway I don't see why they're being such assholes about it. I'm really sorry. Definitely speak to a higher up and report it."

I work in a hospital and I can tell you this much, nurses run the place; the doctors advise them from home/wherever they happen to be.  OP, if you can stick it out until you can get in to see him, do so. Don't get into a pissing match with the nurses. When you see the doctor, tell him everything that you've said here and make it clear how all of this nonsense has negatively affected you.  Calling the board of health, etc, will only piss him off, and unless you want to be looking for a new doctor, I'd hold off on that. Wait until after you've seen him. If he still refuses, then take action but give HIM a chance to refuse your prescription, not his nurse. They can, and will, ""fire"" you as a patient if you piss them off.   Good luck. I hope the doctor is sympathetic and apologetic, and I hope that some bitch nurse's head rolls for this."

Fibromyalgia,2y66yf,dearmrdarcy,2,Sun Mar 8 15:16:18 2015 UTC,"So, I just got back from my appointment with the doctor. It went poorly, though I did end up getting my prescription rewritten. He came into the room and blasted me for threatening the livelihoods of his staff and himself, and after about 4 minutes of this I finally managed to convince him to listen to my side of the story. His side of the story is that they got ""preliminary results"" that said negative to everything, so they were in the right. He got very angry when I asked why they couldn't just tell me that when I was trying to figure out what was happening. Then he ""very kindly"" told me how this is their job, not a joke, and how getting multiple calls from one person about the same thing is disruptive to their business. He did -finally- admit after some dialogue that he could understand how this was incredibly disruptive to my life as well (though he phrased it as an ""inconvenience""). He went on a while about how he's not afraid of me, if I sue him he'll sue me back- I eventually got him to understand that I had no intention of legal action, and that implying that it had crossed my mind when I called last week was just a result of extreme stress, and the paranoia I was experiencing because of the utter lack of communication or understanding or even minor reassurance from the staff. He finally calmed down, and told me about how he answers to god, and god was the reason we were there and some 'forgiveness is divine' spiel and declared it water under the bridge. There were some more kindly inflected, thinly veiled threats about cutting me off, never questioning him or his staff, and his complacency with suing patients who he feels represent a threat to his clinic. He signed my script and gave it to me, and then started talking to me about how ""tramadol does not create a dependency"" and ""you can't go through withdrawal from tramadol"" and finally how we would work through what sounded very, very much like a rehab program while he tried to work me down to one 50mg dose a day. I currently take four 100mg doses a day, which has worked perfectly as long as I get my prescriptions filled on time, but he feels that I've grown too dependent. Things got a little tense when I suggested that it's natural for someone with serious chronic pain to depend on painkillers to function properly in society, so I backed down. He's referred me to a pain clinic, with whom I plan to openly discuss what has happened these past two weeks and try to get someone other than my current GP to be in charge of my meds.  So, I got my script to the pharmacy and now I'm shopping for a new doctor. One who doesn't hold me hostage, play the victim when I advocate for my own health, and especially can read a damn result sheet and communicate clearly with their patients what is going on when things don't go perfectly.  tl;dr My doctor is an asshat, I got my prescription somehow, I am seeking a replacement doctor. Someone competent, compassionate, and preferably secular.  Bonus: The impossible-to-decipher drug screen"

It's not great, but anything stronger leaves me unable to do anything and anything weaker might as well be baby aspirin. My question is why would a pain management clinic want to start all over again. I started at a pain management clinic this past December and they just looked over my records, consulted with me in the office, and gave me a quick examination. Then they took over all my pain meds and, while warning me of the dangers of over-medicating, increased my tramadol and put me on Gabapentin. Are you certain that a clinic would make you start back at the beginning? Because if not, that may be your best bet since they know what you're dealing with and tend to not mess screw you around like some GPs will."

You will not be able to do everything you want in the same way you would have tackled it before you had symptoms.  As said elsewhere, every case is unique. If you slowly work your way up to being able to lift an amount greater than you would be required to lift on average at your job, there's a chance you could keep that job, especially because it seems to make you very happy!  I strongly recommend that you do not try to ignore your pain. Work with it. Acknowledge where your limits are, and work with what you've got."

Fibromyalgia,2y00lw,FibroMan,2,Tue Mar 10 18:33:19 2015 UTC,Fibro doesn't directly affect your strength.  A lack of exercise due to pain or fatigue affects your strength.  If you were able to lift a certain weight before getting fibro then you should still be able to lift it.  If I was in your position I would be aiming to study and work part time rather than full time.  I don't think your career path matters too much to fibro.   Do whatever you are best at doing.

Fibromyalgia,2xyonr,stripedheart,3,Wed Mar 4 23:46:54 2015 UTC,"Take some time to think about what YOU want from life.  Focus on what is most important to you.  Then cut out the things that aren't so important.  Try to reduce the pressure on yourself.  Other people will run around doing lots of different things, most of which are not very important.  Think of what they do as boring. What you really want to do is all that matters.  Do you REALLY have to go to school?  How does going to school help you achieve what you want to achieve in life?  Can you get an education at your own pace instead of having to go to a school every day?  There are lots of learning opportunities for adults and some courses can be done online.  You don't have to graduate at the same time as everyone else your age.  Once you know what you want to do and you have cut out all of the boring things in life it should be easier to get out of bed in the morning.  Try to be honest about you pain levels to those who are closest to you.  Explain to them that it isn't supposed to make sense.  Sometimes a gentle brush hurts more than a strong bump.  Sometimes you can do a lot and sometimes you can't do anything.  Make sure it is okay for you to bail out of something at the last minute if you need to.  Keep trying different things to ease the pain a little.  Different drugs and different exercises can help.  Find out what works for you.  Don't forget that pain is the problem, not a symptom.  I hope you regain some control over your life.  If you figure it all out then let us know how you did it :)"

They only take patients up to age 21, but about 33% of fibro patients finish these programs pain free (n=64) and over half finish with pain scores of less than 1.

Fibromyalgia,2xyonr,lady_skendich,2,Wed Mar 18 18:20:58 2015 UTC,"Short answer:  I remember going to the doctor feeling ashamed because I felt depressed.  He looked at me and said ""I'd think you were weird if you weren't depressed.  Chronic pain and fatigue is awful and it's totally normal to feel overwhelmed, defeated and depressed"".  I am always on an antidepressant, and always will be.  I'm okay with that.  Longer answer:  Being diagnosed with fibro is a two edged sword.  First positive because there is a 'name' for your pain and other people are experiencing it too so you are not going crazy.  Second comes the negative - Holy cow this is for life.  It is such a huge adjustment that you have to make and initially you get angry because you have to make those adjustments.  For me, I rebelled and tried to keep going with everything anyway, I had the 'this is not going to beat me' mentality.  Of course that didn't work so I started making changes to help my pain and fatigue levels.  I was diagnosed when I was 29, 14 years ago and it has been a long road.  At that time I had three jobs, two preschoolers and was studying to become a teacher.  It took the fibro to make me slow down and smell the roses I guess.    There was a lot of panic at the start - 'how will I be a good mother to my kids?' and 'what the hell is the rest of my life going to be like?'.  I just had to take baby steps and work on what helped me to feel good versus what didn't.  Of course I was going down the medical track as well, I tried lots of different medications, I flew across the country for anaesthetic shots in my back, I spent three weeks in a pain clinic, and had counselling among other things.  I thought I wouldn't be able to complete my studies, and then not be able to be a teacher.  It was hard at times but I did it.  I studied part time for 4 years and completed the final year full time.  I took advantage of allowances given to me, for example I can't write for too long so they let me sit exams on a computer.  I took the occasional day off it my flares were really out of control but never more than that. I spent a lot of days in bed in the weekend, but I did it.  I graduated 10 years ago and have been working as a teacher since then.  I work 4 days a week, 5 is just too many for me, I take Friday as a recovery day so I can be semi functional for the weekend when everybody is home.  Coincidentally I took today off work because my legs have been so bad for the past ten days or so and I was beginning to take it out on the kids at school, so it was best to stay at home today.  Sick days are allowed, everyone has them.  It takes time to figure out what works for you.  Most people have triggers like change in weather, stress and such but there will be more personal ones for you.  For me it is wheat, when I eat that then my symptoms get really bad, I meditate when I can for the stress and just allow myself sleeping time to try and feel normal.  I go to the chiropractor and get massages once a fortnight, I have also had acupuncture which helps too.  Unfortunately you can spend all of your time and money on this stuff so you need to try them and decide what is right for you.  Wow, I hate long posts and personally don't read them, but meh - this is what had to be said.  You can do it, you can still experience joy and happiness in life, and you can still complete school.  Baby steps, don't think about next year, just think about today and tomorrow."
Fibromyalgia,2xyonr,_southernbelle_,1 point,Thu Mar 5 03:50:18 2015 UTC,"First of all, there's a reason depression & fibro are concomitant, seems fairly obvious how causality could go either direction, eh? Second, a support network requires different folks for different facets. For fibro issues you need people who ""get"" fibro issues, so a good doc, maybe a therapist, & a literal support group. This can be as simple as this sub (or others) or a more formal setting IRL. Good luck fellow traveler!"

Fibromyalgia,2xy8t9,toastydoc,6,Wed Mar 4 21:30:06 2015 UTC,"Weakened immune doesn't necessarily come with fibro.  I had a sinus infection 2 weeks ago.  It lasted all of a day and a half.  It hit my wife and one of my kids.  My wife has it a week later, and my son had it for 5 days.  Before that, it had been over a year since I was sick.  Nothing at all.  Not even a sore throat.  Have you had any blood work done?  Fibro patients tend to have low D, B12 and iron.  Low B and iron could affect your immune system if it remains consistently low.  D affects just about every system in the body as well, so it is important to keep that up as well.  You may also have some other odds and ends low that may be unique to you.  I keep coming back with low copper for some reason for example.  For exercise, try low impact yoga.  An elliptical or a full suspension bike could work as well.  For the yoga, I use the Wii.  It may not sound like much, but it works and I don't have to travel to do it.  I can also take quick breaks between each pose.  My pain drastically increases the longer I'm on my feet, so it is important for me to be able to do that.  I can't last long on an elliptical before I'm worn out cardio wise.  My longest has been 9 mins so far.  On a bike, I can go around 30 mins.  Full suspension bikes are a bit expensive though, so that may not be an option.  It is by far the easiest to tolerate though.

I've had one cold since 2010, but severe body wide random pain everyday. It could be one of the symptoms I'm not familiar with since there can be so many..but I wouldn't call a weakened immune system a common fibro symptom.

As far as your immune system I agree with many posters about B12 and D.  I'm a vegetarian so I watch the B12 in my food since I'm not getting it from meat.

Anything you do to improve your overall level of health will probably improve your condition. With CFS I have to be super careful about exercise but a little is better than none.

I thought there was no aspartame in Pepsi Max, but I just checked and additive 951 is in the ingredient list, which is aspartame.  I normally have up to 2 pepsi maxes on weekends - I guess I will cut them out to see if I improve.  Fibromyalgia has nothing to do with immune systems, so that is a separate issue.  I would have thought that your improved diet would help.  Maybe your desks at work are too close together, or the air conditioning doesn't provide enough fresh air?  There tend to be less colds in summer because people spend more time outside.  Making sure you have enough vitamins D and B12 is a good idaea too.  Tramadol works well for me too.  Codeine worked even better for me.  The plan is to switch between them whenever one of them stops working.  Hopefully I can get another year or two out of them :)"
Fibromyalgia,2xy8t9,FibroMan,3,Thu Mar 5 02:09:23 2015 UTC,Interesting about the aspartame and fibro - I've never been able to tolerate it!
Fibromyalgia,2xy8t9,lbsmith5,2,Thu Mar 5 03:54:40 2015 UTC,"I know fibro is not an immune disorder per say, but my doctor told me the reason i get sick easily us because the body is constantly responding to the pain and this opens you up to infections.  Its not an auto immune disorder, but it wastes resources that would otherwise fight off infections."
Fibromyalgia,2xy8t9,FibroMan,1 point,Thu Mar 5 02:43:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think fibro wastes enough resources to affect the immune system.  I think your doctor is wrong. Problems with sleep would affect your immune system much more than any wasted resources.  I used to catch every cold that went around the office long before I had fibro.  When I changed jobs I suddenly stopped getting sick so often.  Now that I quit my job because of fibro, I get sick less often than when I was working.  Let's face it, the biggest risk factor for catching an infectious disease is being exposed to one."

So we were told off for blocking the busy corridors by the same people who were stopping us from unblocking them), and everyone leaving the top floor was late for their next class, because the down stairs were in another part of the school.

Fibromyalgia,2xu5lb,shaylenn,1 point,Fri Mar 6 08:59:49 2015 UTC,"Not so much my teeth but I definitely have problems with my jaw. Sometimes it is probably just from tension but it can also hurt/click/not open fully at random times.   The sleeping thing. I move around a lot in my sleep and tend to be pretty particular about positions which can be difficult when my legs feel better when I'm on my side but my chest/back feel better when I'm on my back.   I get traditional Chinese acupuncture regularly and that involves lying completely still for an hour and ideally going to sleep for that time. You can't move because then you feel the needless. I was always worried about lying still for that long, but my acupuncturist has me lying down in a way where it's really easy not to move.   -For starters you're on one of those bed/chairs with the mechanically adjustable back, so you're not lying flat but like half reclined/not quite flat. So head and torso are slightly higher than your legs and pelvis etc. You could either achieve this by propping yourself up comfortably with a few pillows or try sleeping on a reclining arm chair.   -Then she puts pillows under my knees so my legs are bent (I fucking love this and can't sleep without it sometimes, just takes all the pressure off my joints). And puts a pillow under each arm (with your arms slightly bent at the elbow, whatever is more comfortable) so your arms are slightly elevated too. You could even roll up a blanket or towel to circle around your head if you're more comfortable resting your head against something.   -and to top it all off she somehow knows exactly how many blankets to put over me (well, not over my limbs where all the needless are of course) so I'm not too hot or too cold. And that's not easy to do haha.   Now I'm not sure what it is that makes this work so I don't move when I sleep. It's either the fact that I'm basically now in the most comfortable position possible, so I don't have to keep shifting to find new more comfortable positions. Or if it's because I'm basically trapped in a pillow fort and there's not really anywhere to go. Or if it's because mentally I know I can't move so I am purposefully trying to lie still while going to sleep.   Doing this at home, during the night may or may not be possible. It might only work to lie this still for about an hour, I don't know. Your limbs might need more movement than that at night. This kind of technique helps me nap or get comfortable when I'm having a flair up during the day, but I've never done it for a whole night. You could try a variation of this, just putting a few pillows around under your arms and legs for example. That could just be enough to change your normal response to sleep and encourage stillness. You might wake up in a mess of pillows and your limbs all in new positions but over time you could train yourself to sleep in that position. If you wake up feeling stiff from lying still perhaps this isn't the best option for you. But maybe just sleeping normally just with pillows under your arms will help the elbow issue.   edit: wow that's super long, sorry! TLDR: try sleeping with pillows under your arms/and or legs to encourage a new, more still way of sleeping."

But in the last year or so, everything hurts, so I either clench my teeth, and hide the pain, or I tell them.  Honestly, I would rather hurt than not be touched by people that are important to me. So I will suffer, because touch is important to me."
Fibromyalgia,2xqs7c,aychexsee,2,Tue Mar 3 18:02:15 2015 UTC,"On the bad days when it feels like every pound of flesh is bruised, I definitely flinch whenever someone reaches for a hug.   The emotional pain is worse for me. When my body hurts, my husband instinctively wants to hold me closer and comfort me but it is simply unbearable. To rebuff him, even with both of us knowing the cause, that's somehow worse than the touch itself."

Fibromyalgia,2xqs7c,Smgth,2,Tue Mar 3 23:21:59 2015 UTC,When I flare up big time it's always my shoulders. It took me years to get my husband not to karate chop me for fun there. (He got in trouble from a friend) Even touching me for a moment on the pressure point around my shoulder will hurt for a long time.   Now if I can get my brother from digging his chin into my shoulder.

You gotta keep on keepin' on.  If this job is too much, start looking for other positions. Maybe the boss can help you find something similar or cut down your load.   I'm still looking for an answer for myself on the sex thing too. I feel bad because I'm the one who has to cut things short. So far my partner has been understanding but... I'm still disappointed and almost angry with myself for not being able to enjoy it as much as I want to! I don't usually get the ""longing for normalcy"" feeling but I definitely do after that. :("
Fibromyalgia,2xpuky,raekira,1 point,Tue Mar 3 03:28:53 2015 UTC,"If you're at the point where you feel like you cannot make it on your own, apply for whatever disability, financial assistance you can get NOW! Don't wait till you can't work. I made that mistake and was almost homeless and now am deep in debt because of it. See if you boss will start letting you do some work from home. Do your financials and figure out how many hours you can afford to drop. Working less is easier than your body completely failing you and losing all your income.  Deal with you biggest issues one at a time. That includes making meaningful steps to get to the root of your depressive tendencies and anxiety. Learning coping skills will help you have a better prospective on managing your pain. You need to get to the point where you are having a bad day because of pain and not having a bad day because you are worried about being in pain.   Physical Therapy, get in it and stay in it. Clean up your diet and get tested to make sure you aren't suffering from anemia or vitamin D deficiency. Check to make sure none of your medicines increase your depressive symptoms because many do.   Most of all, remember that it is okay to have a bad day. Nothing worth beating yourself up over."
Fibromyalgia,2xpuky,Le_Squish,1 point,Tue Mar 3 01:19:24 2015 UTC,"I'm 24, only diagnosed a few years. I employ the bone resetting you describe, and am always curious as to its affect on my body. Trying to describe it to someone is difficult, but I often feel I'm spending all day adjusting my bones back into place. I describe the misaligned feeling as a kind of pressure, accompanied by pain, which yes seems to get a few minutes better after adjustment. I'm looking for descriptions of what ehlers-danlos feels like to see if it could be an explanation, but I know there are many kinds of arthritis that are hard to catch in the young and have always felt like my body is an old woman's so maybe it is that. Maybe you and I keep doing research and whoever explains it first gets to reveal the mystery to the other. All I know now is that the noise is attributed to synovial fluid changing pressure within joints. Please describe any more body symptoms you think could be related to this symptom. On a side note, I had vag surgery on a bartholins gland abscess and communication and being honest with your body will help ensure your bf and you can still enjoy one another physically, indefinitely. You have only possibility left in your life once you can learn safe coping skills. I am still on this journey too, and it helps to know you don't suffer alone. I worry with you, friend. Chin up. (Crackalackin all the while). Most don't even notice the tiny noises we feel make us stand out, adjust away in public, don't let your ideas of external judgment stop you from being comfortable, you deserve it as much as those around you who, trust me, don't hear it as loud as the person within whom it reverberates."
Fibromyalgia,2xpuky,indigoherring,0,Tue Mar 3 01:57:51 2015 UTC,"I think you need to get a second opinion. Your symptoms suggest something is wrong with your endocrine system. Cracking joints suggest a thyroid problem, pain flares are regular times of the day suggest hypothalamus, Raynauds can be secondary Raynauds due to a underlying disease, and anxiety suggest adrenal glands. Plus, at 16, your endocrine system and hormones are developing, and it is no surprise if you have an endocrine disease that it would begin to develop at this age. The problem with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia is that often doctors stop looking for another underlying cause for your symptoms. You'll need to get a referral to an endocrinologist. To do this, ask your family doctor for a full thyroid panel (TSH, T3, T4) and a cortisol level check. These are blood tests, and as another poster suggested, worth also getting tested for anemia, Vitamin D. I would also add B12. The other test that is helpful is a brain MRI as it would show any anomalies in the pituitary or hypothalamus. It is important to take your medical care into your own hands and insist to see the best doctors. There are good ones and bad ones, just like good teachers and bad teachers. keep searching and don't give up! take care."

He even scolded me for putting him to bed late even though his supper was in his house and I have already given him his night time treat.

I also have a puppy I got several months ago but so far he's unfortunately been more of a pain than a help to me! He's 11 months old now, very big and clumsy. He doesn't realize how big he is and he's almost knocked me down a few times as he's still learning not to jump up.

Fibromyalgia,2xn5fb,Chilly73,1 point,Tue Mar 3 02:05:02 2015 UTC,"No.  I have my doubts about HSV-1 being a cause for Fibromyalgia.  If it was a cause then you would expect ALL patients to have it.  The progression and persistence of Fibromyalgia doesn't fit very well with an immune response, either to an infection or autoimmune.  I think fibro better fits a hormone problem.  There is a big overlap of symptoms with hypothyroidism.  There could be an undiscovered hormone that controls peripheral nerves and central sensitization together, a kind of ""pain volume control"".  Hormones often affect the body in multiple areas, and by definition hormones are slow acting, which fits with the progression of Fibro.    The main questions that my theory can't answer are: what throws the pain volume control out of balance?  And more importantly, how do you fix it?  The answer will depend on where the hormone is produced.  Maybe there are several viral infections that can cause it?  Maybe HSV-1 is one of those viruses?  If so then a link of 50% or less will be found by the HSV-1 research."
