Simulated,3e1coo,GodTookMyKFC,5,Tue Jul 21 05:06:57 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you want to do.  For game modelling, 3DS Max or Maya is pretty good.

If you need something free that works for most stuff (animation, game modelling, fluid simulations etc), Blender is the way to go.  It depends on what you want. A tool doesn't make your work automatically better, it's your skills that define the quality of your work.  edit: This isn't the best subreddit to ask a question about 3D modelling, try /r/3dmodeling or something.

I think you'd have to write your own simulation engine, and maybe brute force or use simulated annealing to figure out a starting position that ends up looping. It wouldn't have to be perfect though, you could get close enough and then let the engine tweak some of the physics to push certain balls in the right direction.

Simulated,3dg21o,tdhsmith,2,Thu Jul 16 18:18:52 2015 UTC,"Oh man that's really exciting but sounds really challenging. You can have some sort of allowable delta for every collision that gives you a range of results. And you could try to backtrace final positions to the key interactions that created them and build some sort of crazy physics dependency tree? It still sounds stupendously hard, but no, not impossible.  I guess you could have way bigger fudges too, like setting a fixed camera and allowing occluded objects to change motion and even swap places with others..."

Simulated,3ddy2b,Corpse_Nibbler,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:49:34 2015 UTC,how does it decide which side to flop over to in the beginning? Is it completely random? Are there any other factors influencing the direction? It looks like they all come straight down the center right on top of each-other but it first bounces to the left. I don't know enough about physics or whatever to form a hypothesis on why this happens.
Simulated,3ddy2b,Jordan311R,2,Thu Jul 16 08:09:12 2015 UTC,"Well, it's obviously simulating physics, so the computer makes some complex calculations and guesses to decide which way to go. Each object has a space where it would ""give"" first based on a number of tiny influences, like the specific weight distribution of other objects around it (ie impacting it or being impacted by it), thickness of the material in different places, etc. The simulation in this case figures out which direction it's most likely to go in based on these factors, which would be input from the creator. It's also highly possible that the creator of the simulation tilted some of the elements just slightly enough to influence the direction that it flops over into so that they could get it to go the direction they wanted."

Simulated,3cgrd2,CashireCat,9,Tue Jul 7 20:00:59 2015 UTC,"Time perhaps not, but money is certainly part of the answer. The movie had to be redone from scratch after the hard drives with the assets were stolen, that can't have been too good for the movie.  Remember also that the movie was being made from the early 00's, so some of the assets were very dated. The movie got rated by the MPAA in 07, so it was likely finished then. In 2007, Pixar released Ratatouille; which is certainly much better looking than Food Fight, but not quite full of the crazy simulation stuff that's currently available either.  And finally, probably the biggest reason is that it's just badly made. The movie was a blatant grab for advertising money, not the labor of love Pixar or Disney's movies usually are. I doubt they actually hired animators that incompetent (not an easy field to bullshit your way into: your portfolio kinda speaks for itself), so I'm leaning towards incompetence at the art direction, direction or production level, probably all three, since any of those three levels should have been able to notice the train wreck coming from a mile away."

Simulated,3cgrd2,neonoodle,2,Wed Jul 8 07:59:07 2015 UTC,"Because the team that made it not only had to make it really fast but in all likelihood sucked to begin with. I worked on some straight to DVD films of which a large portion of work was outsourced to India and we would have to babysit them in order to get anything back of value, and even then it was iffy. Not only that but there was a lot of work to do in a short period of time, so there wouldn't be a lot of room for iteration. We'd get one or 2 rounds of revisions and that's it, whatever it is it's final. In this sub, though, are people who are probably spending quite a bit of time polishing and tweaking a simulation to get it as good as you see it, and they're often better at problem solving issues so they don't need to go through a million iterations just to figure out why the sim exploded."

Simulated,3ba16z,Animateyourgame,6,Sat Jun 27 07:55:55 2015 UTC,"The ocean surface is a single plane with a dense mesh. I used HOT4D which is like a fancy displacement deformer with several value inputs that solve ocean surfaces. It's really easy to get a good looking result in no time.  If you feed it a point selection and a vertex map it will 'Do Jacobian' weighting areas of stretching and distortion which can be used for all kinds of fun stuff like layer masks and particle emitters. If your surface is animated, the maps animate with them. That's the meat of it.  I'm not by my machine so I can't give exact values but a lot of the time was spent on the materials and lighting. I used the vertex map as a layer mask in the color selection to get lighter colors at the crests and darker at the valleys, dialed in the sub surface scattering in luminance, animated bump map and and put some wavy turbulence in the diffusion channel and 3 layers of reflectance with a sky around the whole thing. Then I put a volumetric spot on the surface and messed with that for awhile.  Use a matrix on object mode to clone TP to the ocean surface and your point selection map to isolate them to the crest areas. There's some sliders in hot 4d that will affect the falloff and the amount of selected points. Since the TP are cloned to the vertices directly on the plane and hence a grid I used a random effector to move make them a bit more organic and above the surface so that the fluids would not emit underneath. Assign the particles a hair shader and that's pretty much it. thisguy has a way better, more complicated TP rig with pyro clusters on. He included the scene file. Check it out.  Put a tfd container around your ocean - make your ocean a collider object and emit from the particle geometry with some turbulence and Vorticity. Mess with your smoke shader and add some velocity displacement.  Sim - render voila!    Sorry if that was long-winded. There's a lot out there on this plugin if your interested."

No reason for it to be in a mall, just testing different forms in different environments.  These are mock ups for a bigger project over the summer. Here is my workflow copied from another comment.    First I filmed some footage in a mall in Chinatown, LA. I moved around an imaginary spot, like a crazy person, filming an empty space. Then I brought the footage into program which tracks the movement of the camera. It makes a 3-D version of my camera which has the exact movement as my original footage. I save the camera data for my respected 3-D program. I am using Cinema4D so I choose to output as that. I open the file. I create a floor to catch the shadows.

The rate of CPU power increasing is slowing, and I don't think Moore's law will hold much longer. Maybe advanced in GPU computation and parallelisation will help us get there.   That said, if we were able to simulate large scale structures on an atomic level, doing so would be vastly inefficient. I don't know what processes could be modelled more accurately by stimulating each atom, rather than the overall structures, apart from the action of molecules themselves such as in drug research, but this is already done because the number of atoms involved is small."
Simulated,3ak8hf,moby3,3,Sun Jun 21 01:21:25 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. We can already simulate large structures (buildings) rather accurately with existing models, even though those models contain likely 99.999999999999999% fewer 'atoms' than it actually would.  Where having atomic particle physics in large structures could be useful, I think, would be for the purposes of destruction. Destroying a building made out of different materials that are accurately represented would look pretty incredible. :)   Thanks for your input!"
Simulated,3ak8hf,moby3,7,Sun Jun 21 01:34:11 2015 UTC,"But the thing is, we can already do this! Building simulations often involve different materials with different properties that are joined together.   In physics, a lot is understood about things at the very small (atomic) level, and about things on a macroscopic level. Maybe these sorts of simulations could be used to help us understand what happens in between, and how the small particles influence the behaviour at a large scale"
Simulated,3ak8hf,IO-Chem,8,Sun Jun 21 01:59:20 2015 UTC,"Computational chemist here specializing in exactly that (at least a very specific application).  The atomic scale simulations you're referring to are more commonly known as atomistic molecular dynamics, and it is a quickly evolving field of research.  Atomic scale simulations of proteins give us a vital description of a protein's structure and movement, and has given us the ability to visualize a world no microscope can show.  However, the current fastest supercomputer used for atomistic simulations can run all 512 cores for months and only achieve a video that lasts a couple milliseconds of a single protein.  Simulating a single human cell (let alone anything visible to the naked eye) is far beyond the reaches of the current technology.  Additionally, if you care about electrons, introducing quantum behavior will put you in the timescale of picoseconds to nanoseconds.  So a simulated reality is beyond our capabilities anytime soon.  I believe that GPU computation will bring our next jump in computational performance, but we still have a ways to go.  In the meantime, here's an example of a MASSIVE simulation of the protein shell of HIV.  Here you can see the detail of a true atomic scale simulation."

Now if you're talking about seeing the individual atoms interacting with one another, well that would need an extreme amount of speed and processing in order to compute (for example) 1 gram of hydrogen atoms. That number is a fairly large one and for a computer to handle 6.02 x 1023 particles performing X amounts of tasks in X amount of ways would provide some obvious lag and maybe some processing issues.

Blender also lets you 'bake' the physics so that it doesn't change each time you run it.  So anyway, yes Blender lets you fix the simulation to allow surreal results like this."

Simulated,3abyic,rreighe2,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:06:25 2015 UTC,"Ok. To your questions: It is possible to place water everywhere (programmatically). So you could for example test where water gathers after 20 minutes.  The terrain is based on a heightmap. So the x,z values are a fixed grid and only the y value can change. Currently, all it does is generating a mostly random heightmap and then starts the simulation. It can only export terrains as a jpg which you then can convert to xyz meshes. No the other way around.  What would you like to do with it? In theory it would be possible to build an importer as long as the input mesh doesn't have caves or anything similar."

And I'm pretty sure that's what's going on here. Take a bunch of particles, give them a couple rules as to how to interact with other particles (don't get too close to other particles, when you do, move away from it with x acceleration, and conserve momentum.) then watch the mayhem. Once you know where every particle is, you make a nice little mesh connecting them, and texture it according to some properties, how fast it's moving, the direction of the face normals (think kinda like a first derivative for a mesh) and the angle of various edges.   However, solving fluid dynamics problems with mathematical certainty, now that's a challenge. It's a lot of very messy math that isn't always easy, or even possible to do."
Simulated,3a5oqr,Pseudoboss11,9,Sat Jun 20 14:02:39 2015 UTC,"I imagine a lot of it is applying the same or a similar algorithm over and over again to a large group of voxels (kind of like a 3D version of pixels), that are rendered with some kind of connecting images to make them appear like a single conjoined unit when stationary or only moving a little.  Force is applied to a voxel, that voxel moves, then when it collides or otherwise affects another voxel some of the force is transferred to it, repeating until the force dissipates."

My physics is a little (or a lot) rusty, but I THINK because the front wheels aren't sliding (as much), they become the point of contact with the most friction, which brings the axis of rotation forward. Again, I defer to anyone with a more comprehensive knowledge of the physics involved.   If all 4 tires were sliding and had equal coefficients of friction, then the point of rotation would be at the center of gravity, which for a 911 would absolutely be rearward compared to a front engine car, but because the front tires aren't sliding, the rotation is towards the front.

Simulated,38axpy,moby3,2,Wed Jun 3 02:39:47 2015 UTC,"It's because internal and cycles materials aren't compatible, so when you switch you need to re-do the materials. I recommend watching a basic video on texturing and setting materials in cycles, it will be well worth your time. Especially because you're new, you should learn to use the render engine that's used 99% of the time these days  This one is in depth and very good https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnpvFbvRSyM"
Simulated,38axpy,RockULikeAHermanCain,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:43:30 2015 UTC,After several hours of tinkering and video watching This is what I have come up with. What do you think?
Simulated,38axpy,Wikiwooka,4,Thu Jun 4 03:44:40 2015 UTC,"That's looking a lot better!  Something to think about would be desaturating the color of the balls just a little bit, very little in the real world is 100% red or 100% blue.  It will also add a little more interest and detail to your reflections.  Right now, the blue ball reflects 100% blue light toward the red ball but the red ball has no components to reflect back to the camera, hence the black spot.  Another suggestion is to add a subdivision modifier to the balls so that they look rounder in the render.  The cool thing about adding the modifier is that it has separate settings for View and Render.  If you set the View to 0 or 1, your 3D view in Blender will be nice and responsive and all the extra geometry will only be added during render.  You can read about that here."
Simulated,38axpy,X_Joshi_X,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:42:01 2015 UTC,"So I don't know blender at all, but I do know other programs. one thing I would do is make just 1 light have shadows and make that your ""key light"". This light should be brighter than your other lights. I would also add in an IBL (also called an HDRI) to give the balls something to reflect. As you can see they are reflecting nothing but the floor giving it that big black circle in the middle of them.   Start with that and it should give you a lot better results.  I'm not sure if this would help at all https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5J8X14yFaw"

I've added the focus to the camera, and that has definitely helped for objects that are further or closer than the focal point, and looks really nice.  However, I've tried both animating the seed (it increases by one every frame, is this the way to do it?) as well as increasing the samples for render and preview to 100 from 10, and it seems increasing the samples makes edges smoother, but also increases the number of 'grains' in my objects.  Am I doing something wrong? I'm guessing maybe I have too many reflective/glossy objects, or maybe too many glass objects, or some combination?  I appreciate your help!"
Simulated,364z64,ianofshields,2,Sat May 16 09:27:44 2015 UTC,Yes. Animating the seed so that it increases by one every frame is correct. Increasing the samples to 100 should certainly help a little but to see any real improvements you will have to increase is significantly more. An increase as a factor of 8 offers double the quality. So to make it twice as good the samples would be increased to 800! Remember that in production environments 24 hour renders are commonplace.  edit: It is actually 4 times the samples to half the noise. Not 8! sorry.

Even if you're using a different program, the mechanics of rendering tend to be the same all around, in my limited experience. (my bastardized explanation) Rendering involves the computer taking scans of your scene over and over to complete the image. The more scans it does the cleaner and more accurate your render will be, however it takes longer and uses more juice. So there's a fine line. Actually the best way to learn in my opinion is youtube tutorials and whatnot, there are boatloads."

Simulated,35j5hn,MonarKay,43,Sun May 10 23:42:14 2015 UTC,"It took him 600 hours to compute 8 seconds of video.  According to moore's law, transistor density doubles every two years, meaning computing power can double every two years.  600 hours is 2,160,000 seconds.  In order to compute it in ""real time"", it should compute 8 seconds of video in 8 seconds.  To find this, assuming moores law holds, which it has historically, we use (600 * 60 * 60)*(1/2)n = 8, solve for n, where n is the number of 2 year periods before it is computed in real time.  n = 18.0426, so in 36.1 years this should be computable in real time.

Simulated,35j5hn,MLRyker,3,Thu May 14 05:12:33 2015 UTC,"The main reason this took 600 hours is because of inefficient algorithms.  When algorithms become more and more efficient, we'll actually see things like this become exponentially faster and it'll ""overtake"" moore's law.  For example, this is from Jurassic park. 1993. Took 6 hours per frame to render, and was shown at 24 frames per second. Using (6 * 60 * 60)*(1/2)n = 1/24, I get n = 18.9837, so 37.97 years after 1993 (by your math) we should be able to calculate Jurassic Park level CGI in real time. So Jurassic Park level CGI = year 2031. Even better, the render farm required for this had roughly a thousand CPUs working (ILM had 1,500 cpus by 2002, and had doubled to 3,000 for the rendering required in The Phantom Menace).  I dunno about you, but this looks pretty on par with Jurassic Park level CGI to me. And then there's fricking... skyrim. I shouldn't be impressed at this point but damnit I still am. Now these guys are rendering crysis and skyrim full out 1080p HD at not 24 fps, but a goddamn 60+ solid fps. It's only 2015, and those gaming setups cost less than $4,000.  Algorithms are where the real speed increases are coming from. Algorithms and optimizations in rendering engines, not so much ""more transistors"""
Simulated,35j5hn,thang1thang2,2,Wed May 13 03:45:39 2015 UTC,"Well, algorithms for scientific computation benefit from parallel processing, which is a hardware residual as much as an algorithmic one.  Of course he could lease time on a supercomputer, of course theres more powerful computers with multithreading operations, but in finite difference time domain simulation the algorithm simply cannot do step 2 before it does step 1.  Algorithms can improve, but fluid flow is actually fairly simple calculations per step, only across millions of nodes and time steps.  There is no way around making billions of calculations per simulation, and with clock speed levelling off it leads to parallelization being the main vector of computational speed improvement.  I've written code in CUDA and OpenCL, anybody can substantially increase there processing with a thousand CPUs, algorithms can't improve on x*y, there is barely room for improvement on vector multiplication, and calculation bundling can't be completed across cores or in global memory without race conditions.  I see what your saying, but transistor density aka computational power is still the biggest driver in speed increases.  You should also know that image rendering and scientific computation is completely different things.  The water problem isn't a graphics problem, it's a computational simulation problem.  Do you think that crysis creates a wind that blows through the trees, simulates the air pressure stresses as it passes through the trees and moves the leaves accordindly?  No, it just shows the leaves moving in a realistic animation.  Are the waves in the water in crysis a calculation simulation or are they just premade graphical patterns.  You also should cite your jurrasic park idea, even though it is also animation rendering and not computational simulation.  You are comparing apples to oranges."
Simulated,35j5hn,kaosChild,2,Wed May 13 19:11:23 2015 UTC,"You are comparing apples to oranges.   You're right. I was assuming that the physics simulation engines were taking algorithmic shortcuts within the constraints possible (eg, not calculating acceleration for horizontal projectile motion because acceleration is zero), and I was assuming that the simulation engines were only rendering the minimum amount of particles needed at any given time. Both types of optimizations have a fair ways to go when it comes to being maximally efficient, I think.  I also thought MonarKay was specifically thinking about video game graphics or other real time uses for graphics like this (besides simulation).  I thought I did cite the jurassic park thing... I gave the rough amount of CPUs used, but apparently forgot to put the link for the rendering time. Here's a link. I saw one source say 6 hours per frame for worst case scenario, one said 12, and this one says 10 hours per frame. I went with 6 to hedge the numbers, but it's only two years difference between 12 and 6 for my n.   You should also know that image rendering and scientific computation is completely different things. The water problem isn't a graphics problem, it's a computational simulation problem. Do you think that crysis creates a wind that blows through the trees, simulates the air pressure stresses as it passes through the trees and moves the leaves accordingly?   Gaming engines seem to be moving more and more towards using true physics simulation, as it's the most accurate way to simulate graphics (for obvious reasons). The Cryengine has quite a few physics things in there. I'm not sure how ""accurate"" everything is, but as computers get faster, I wouldn't be surprised to see gaming engines moving towards true physics simulation wherever possible. At the very least, all gaming engines borrow heavily from physics formulas and simulations in order to get their realism (from what I've seen of them). So I'm pretty sure crysis actually does create air of some sort to move the leaves and ripple the water. It might not be very precise, but the idea is there.    Thank you for correcting my errors, though. I hadn't quite realized how ""simple"" water movement was; I figured it involved much more than simple vector and scalar multiplication. Sorry for the wall of text."

Simulated,35j5hn,thebeardedchild,3,Tue May 12 04:29:31 2015 UTC,Sure.  It was a finite difference time domain method simulation of acoustic waves passing through phononic crystals.  By splitting the crystal into nodes and calculating the stresses and strains at every point and stepping through time you could find the vibrations in and out of the crystal.  Then you would sweep across many different frequencies of input to see what you could get.  It would take billions of calculations and gigabytes of memory to complete a simulation.

I can recommend starting out with very basic tutorials though, before trying out other rendering engines like Luxrender. The BlenderCookie starter tutorials are good place to begin.

Simulated,351p7c,EmAreDubs,1 point,Tue May 12 16:31:54 2015 UTC,I worry that this is fun to watch. LOL
Simulated,34zqxt,moby3,19,Tue May 5 22:22:02 2015 UTC,Are there any tells that show that it's just a simulation?
Simulated,34zqxt,gallio,41,Tue May 5 22:56:27 2015 UTC,"The fact that the balls appear perfectly formed in spheres, apart from that I've got nothing"
Simulated,34zqxt,beepbloopbloop,1 point,Tue May 5 23:00:09 2015 UTC,"That could easily be done if dropped from a spherical container that was quickly opened. It would likely remain a sphere for a second or two, long enough to hit the net."
Simulated,34zqxt,beepbloopbloop,4,Wed Jul 8 14:29:59 2015 UTC,How would you open this exactly spherical container quickly enough without affecting what's inside hahah
Simulated,34zqxt,blendmyskills,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:50:58 2015 UTC,if they're contained in two-half spheres that are pushed together around the ball that were then pulled apart.
Simulated,34zqxt,accepting_upvotes,35,Wed Jul 8 14:58:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, just as it begins, there is a jump in the chain mail as the collision simulation is initiating. if he had let the simulation run for a bit to let the chain mail settle and cut the beginning out it would not have that flaw. other than that and the overall perfectness of the scene its hard to guess."
Simulated,34zqxt,beep_boop_sleep,24,Sat May 9 21:11:57 2015 UTC,"The balls are stuck together into a sphere, there is nothing showing what was keeping them together before the impact."
Simulated,34zqxt,charlesfries,10,Thu May 7 00:10:53 2015 UTC,"yeah, it seriously looks like someone just took a video instead of simulating it"
Simulated,34zqxt,mister____mime,9,Wed May 6 01:07:58 2015 UTC,I find it awesome how we are actually debating whether or not this is a rendering
Simulated,34zqxt,Rheklr,4,Wed May 13 05:18:20 2015 UTC,The balls fall in a perfectly spheroid formation as they are dropped.
Simulated,34zqxt,Rheklr,3,Wed May 6 03:39:46 2015 UTC,I'd say the reflections in the dangling weights are the only aspect that visually feels unnatural. Everything else could've been filmed though.

Simulated,34zp91,janerowdy,8,Mon May 11 10:42:57 2015 UTC,The thumbnail reminds me so much of this
Simulated,34zp91,Maliiwan,5,Wed May 13 21:46:48 2015 UTC,Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t-Ybz3W-WQ  Better quality and better FPS.  I wish people would just post the videos or atleast use GFYCAT.
Simulated,34zp91,ValdemarSt,3,Mon May 11 09:10:45 2015 UTC,This would make an amazing super hero

Simulated,3500rh,blndcavefsh,7,Tue May 5 23:42:57 2015 UTC,I really liked the metal sheets deforming and puncturing.

Simulated,3500rh,VikktorWithAK,3,Wed May 13 01:57:55 2015 UTC,This is very interesting.
Simulated,3500rh,JohannesH,4,Sun May 10 20:53:07 2015 UTC,I like this one
