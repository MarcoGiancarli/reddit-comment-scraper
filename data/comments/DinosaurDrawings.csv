DinosaurDrawings,3dqjog,Owent10,5,Sat Jul 18 14:07:46 2015 UTC,"A snake in the grass...  The rain was beating down, pelting the leaves with water. Hellasaurus heard a faint rattle from the tree behind him.  A large snake with two heads emerged from the leaves. Their eight yellow eyes stared, unblinking and still.  The Hellasaur stared deeply into its hypnotic eyes. And the snake stared back. Pools of yellow swirled around its dark pupils. The dinosaur was in a trance.  He was cut off as the other snake’s huge neck lunged forward, wrapping its long body around the dinosaur's skull, attempting to blind him while clamping its jaws shut.  The dinosaur couldn't see or breath, the two headed snake had wrapped itself tighter and tighter around its entire face, almost crushing its skull.  The Hellasaurus crashed itself against a tree, causing the snakes to loose their grip around his back and fall to the floor. They hissed. Their eight eyes bulged wide - the hit had bruised its entire body, turning its skin from a scaly green to a sickly purple - a sharp tree branch had pierced into its flesh. The serpents groaned as they attempted once more to lunge at the dinosaur. It sunk their venomous fangs into the Hellasaur's flesh as it roared in pain.  Enough.  And then, with a surge of adrenaline, the Hellasaur gripped the snake's body with its claws, held the serpents in its mouth and shut its jaws on their heads, crunching their bones and chewing their eyes. Blue blood spewed into the air and flowed down its throat, as the dinosaur swallowed the snake's heads, dumping their neck stumps on the wet jungle floor.  I suppose two heads aren't better than one."

The dragon from space hovered above - its pink encrusted jewels shining in the sun and beating its wings like a fierce God. Thunder clapped in the distance. Three black bats fluttered off alarmed by the noise.  The dinosaur from Hell roared as its bone-white jaws revealed a set of long sharp teeth dripping with blood. It had never eaten dragon before.  But there's a first for everything.  With quick movement, the Hellasaur lunged forward snapping its jaws at the dragon's neck. The dragon moved away just in time and started to thrash its great wings in anger, sending clouds of dust in the dinosaur's direction. It then struck its tail across the dinosaur's skull with a harsh thump sending it crashing to the hard earth, causing the ground to shake and a small crack to form in the dinosaur's skull.  The dragon stared down at the creature with a celestial gaze - it's one long blue eye beaming with light. It had no intention of killing it - dragons from space don't kill things. Not if they don't have to.  The Hellasaur's eye glowed narrowly with a cold stare in its dark socket. It roared with rage - sending blood and spit flying across the dirt. With a charge - the dinosaur got back on its feet, gripped its neck, and sunk its teeth firmly into the dragon's scaly flesh.  No one makes a crack in the Hellasaur's skull. Not even a dragon from space..."

The size of the sub doesn't change a thing. In a battle, every sword counts; In an election, every vote counts; In a protest, every voice counts. By joining in the other subreddits, one, we're adding to the masses. A hundred horse sized ducks can put up quite a fight. Also, we'll be raising awareness. Back when we went private, I had at least two people message me saying they didn't know what was going on until they read what I posted when we went private. That's awareness. Also, having almost 1,500 subreddits go dark, despite size, has a bigger impact than just a few big ones, because it shows that EVERYONE is upset.  Also, we're not THAT small. According to RedditList, we're the 3,259 biggest subreddit in terms of subscribers. (If you check that for yourself, please note I selected all at the top, not just SFW subreddits.)"
