WWE,3e25sy,jbaum311,3,Tue Jul 21 13:56:32 2015 UTC,"I would have gone bananas for a Paige/Charlotte/Becky/Sasha match. Even Alicia in there would have made for the best Diva match this year. It's a shame they threw in the Bellas, Naomi and Tamina because they're terrible workers. God a'mighty, Brie ruined the match with Charlotte. It's really obvious that they aren't great when in the ring with such talent.  That said, am I right in thinking that the WWE ring is bigger than the NXT ring? The ladies didn't look as comfortable in it."

WWE,3e4735,SGSHCS,2,Tue Jul 21 20:45:15 2015 UTC,I like your ideas bro. I would personally like to see Seth Rollins have a feud with Dolph Ziggler or Neville. Someone on the same level of in ring ability.  John Cena and Reigns seems like a good match given their fighting style. They're both powerhouses with a predictable moveset so it'd be fun to watch them play off of each other. Or not fun. Lol.
WWE,3e4735,ashinybox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:00:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much, dude! ;)  Ah, Rollins vs. Ziggler is my dream rivalry! Seriously, I'd love to see them in an actual feud. And where's Ziggler anyway? :D  Yeah, that's what I thought! Two powerhouses, similar movesets, but look at Hogan vs. Warrior, they actually had a great match at WM6! With Cena and Reigns, I was thinking of something similar, but rather more... extreme. They are both pretty good at extreme matches, Cena had a lot of them. And Reigns did great at WM31! He'll definetely show us more in the future. :D"

Sasha banks is my favourite, although until recently (when she had a few title defences), Charlotte was always the poster girl and the John cena of NXT, sasha and becky were more like underdogs (well, sasha was a heel underdog if that works)  I suggest you watch sasha vs becky (NXT takeover r evolution) and sasha vs Charlotte (from the latest NXT) because I think both are match of the year contenders, and put the raw and smackdown locker rooms to shame"

WWE,3e21fy,MCisthebest,4,Tue Jul 21 10:27:42 2015 UTC,The Rock has the best mic skills and greatest fan base - fact
WWE,3e21fy,PeteJones6969,0,Tue Jul 21 10:36:12 2015 UTC,Do you consider Mic Skills more important then in ring ability? I don't. I do agree that Rock is a megastar and better then most including Cena on the mic.
WWE,3e21fy,Becksdown,4,Tue Jul 21 10:40:06 2015 UTC,"I certainly do. Rock was better in the ring as well, the hell are you watching? Cena doesn't come close to Austin or Rock. Cena doesn't get that pop like they did. Stop it."
WWE,3e21fy,PeteJones6969,-2,Tue Jul 21 10:43:05 2015 UTC,"You are a blind Cena Hater, Rock is and was never better in the Ring than Cena. And Cena also does the best Promos in the WWE, just CM Punk was better at this thing, i'm not even a Cena fan, but if you not admit it, your the typical 30 year virigin guy, that hates Cena on purpose."
WWE,3e21fy,PeteJones6969,2,Tue Jul 21 11:52:02 2015 UTC,"So I'm a cena hater, who's also a thirty year old virgin? Nice. Great points. No. The Rock and Austin and guys like that are WHY the WWE exists today. Better on the mic? Pass that weed my way man. I don't know what you are watching, but that's not what I saw. I don't hate Cena at all. I do hate Seth Rollins, that is a fact. Cena is just not on the same level as the Rock, whether it be in the ring or cutting promos. Austin was better on the mic then Cena. The whole what? gimmick is STILL USED TODAY. The crowd STILL chants that, Austin hasn't been actually in wrestling for YEARS."
WWE,3e21fy,PeteJones6969,-3,Tue Jul 21 12:19:15 2015 UTC,"No one can get those sorts of pops now, the audience has changed. I think their resumes speak for themselves. John Cena has had more 5 star matches then both of those guys."
WWE,3e21fy,MCisthebest,2,Tue Jul 21 10:47:47 2015 UTC,"Just so I'm getting this correctly, the crowd changed so now you can't get the same pop now? I just think the quality of characters has changed. The quality of the show has changed. The audience is the same to me. Nobody takes wrestling moves as good as the rock, that is a well known fact. What does Cena do that the rock can't again? Because I don't know of anything."
WWE,3e21fy,MCisthebest,-2,Tue Jul 21 12:26:39 2015 UTC,"I guess that's debatable. But it sounds like you spent a lot of time watching during the Attitude Era, you should know that the crowds in general were more ruckus then today, but that's beside the point. John Cena is a better in ring talent then The Rock, maybe your memory is a little fuzzy. Here's a comparison for you - Who's matches were better with CM Punk? The Rock or John Cena?"
WWE,3e21fy,MCisthebest,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:32:04 2015 UTC,"Again, what does John Cena do that the Rock can't? What promos has Cena cut that were memorable like The Rock's were? Just stop it. Cena is the face now. He has become bigger then anybody could've expected. I don't hate Cena in anyway, but to say he is better in ring or on mic then The Rock is ludicrous. The Rock helped put him over lol. I will say he is a better wrestler then Austin, but there again Austin was better on the mic. STILL CHANT WHAT? TODAY. Just were doing it last night."
WWE,3e21fy,Scartoxic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:50:32 2015 UTC,"Not surprised you dodged my question. I think we're gonna have to agree to disagree on this one, hard to take you seriously when you think the 'What?' Chants are a good thing.   Yeah Rock put him over, after he was already established - so what? They were horrible matches just like all of Rocks matches since he returned. Cena is a better worker plain and simple."
WWE,3e21fy,Devildog7777,-1,Tue Jul 21 20:20:20 2015 UTC,Yes but it's a combination of both. The Rock actually lost because it was right for the feud and you believed he could lose to the greats of the attitude era. The problem with John is he is built to be a superhero literally. John needs to be a supervillain before it's too late.
WWE,3e21fy,mosjoh08,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:47:48 2015 UTC,"Absolutely it's a combination of both. Cena although I don't usually like what he's saying (eg the lame jokes) but he can deliver on the mic, especially when you see him lock down and get serious like in his CM Punk or Kevin Owens feuds. But my main point is his impressive track record of big match performances. Yeah it will be huge if they ever flick the switch on a John Cena full blown heel turn."
WWE,3e21fy,Zanios74,-1,Tue Jul 21 10:52:25 2015 UTC,Do you watch Tough Enough? Because Hogan ripped Patrick for not changing his character in-ring from himself therefore exposing Cena as 1 of the worst characters ever as Cena really believes his HLR shit.
WWE,3e21fy,Scartoxic,-1,Tue Jul 21 10:59:46 2015 UTC,"No, I don't watch that. I'm pretty sure Vince calls the shots kid."
WWE,3e21fy,brettwho,0,Tue Jul 21 11:03:22 2015 UTC,Vince determines his outcomes but Cena apparently now has full control over who he feuds like Austin and Cena clearly is writing his own promos
WWE,3e21fy,BigFents,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:14:21 2015 UTC,"How is that a ""fact""?  I don't see any examples."
WWE,3e21fy,Woodward82,2,Tue Jul 21 22:47:44 2015 UTC,"I don't see whats wrong with standing behind and cheering him.  He puts on great matches, stayed loyal to WWE (hence his longevity) and does so many Make a Wish grants its crazy.  Plus he gives a positive message/role model to kids everywhere.  Aside from the bitching that he is forced down your throat since when is it bad to be like that?  FYI not my favorite wrestler right now either so not a fanboy rant either.  I'm a Ambrose guy"
WWE,3e21fy,SnowRidin,2,Tue Jul 21 17:53:47 2015 UTC,"John Cena has had a run unlike any other-  10 consecutive years as the top guy. No one really touches that. However, in that 10 years he has not made the impact that Austin or Hogan made in a shorter time."
WWE,3e1063,RJ9225,2,Tue Jul 21 03:09:03 2015 UTC,Im waiting for him to call something vintage in a guy's debut match.
WWE,3e1063,DetectiveCactus,3,Tue Jul 21 03:46:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah. At Summer Slam when K.O. hits the pop up powerbomb, I would give anything to hear ""vintage Owens!!!"""

WWE,3e0taw,bamacl,6,Tue Jul 21 02:11:04 2015 UTC,Why the hell couldn't they give us Sting vs Rollins. Like fuck my life.......here comes John Ceana again✌️Zzzzzzzzzzz💨
WWE,3e0taw,Fwg0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:29:53 2015 UTC,Yup....was hoping to hear them crows....Rollins will probably interfere and set it up
WWE,3e0taw,PeteJones6969,6,Tue Jul 21 02:33:55 2015 UTC,Vince: RATINGS ARE DROPPING EVEN MORE GODDAMNIT GIVE CENA THE TITLE
WWE,3e0taw,chrpskwk,3,Tue Jul 21 03:43:11 2015 UTC,Spoiler tags.
WWE,3e0taw,biblops,4,Tue Jul 21 09:39:13 2015 UTC,I was just going to make a post about this. If this happens then they have clearly given up on Kevin Owens. And if John wins? Then they don't have faith in the new guys. I just want Seth to get bis due and have a real match at Summerslam without getting his ass kicked the whole time like at Battleground.
WWE,3e0taw,thefourthman52,-2,Tue Jul 21 02:20:54 2015 UTC,"agreed, I want to see Cena get 2 more WWE titles in his career to break Flair's record (love him or hate him, he deserves it, he has carried WWE for a long time) but I  don't actually want to see him hold the title lol. Maybe a couple of those he wins the title then loses it 5 minutes later events :D"
WWE,3e0taw,Ileumn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:10:48 2015 UTC,"Randy Orton deserves to break the record far more than Cena imo. After being in Evolution with Flair and being a 3rd generation superstar, if anyone should break it, it should be Orton."
WWE,3e0taw,BrightsideLoL,2,Tue Jul 21 17:37:11 2015 UTC,That or a randy Orton rehash
WWE,3e0taw,PeteJones6969,2,Tue Jul 21 02:12:56 2015 UTC,Doubtful. More likely it'll be Cena vs Owens and Ambrose vs Rollins with maybe a failed Sheamus cash-in.   The only point of that Cena/Rollins promo was to hammer in the idea that Rollins is not an upstanding Champion and to further elevate the US title.
WWE,3e0taw,Alernet,2,Tue Jul 21 05:12:02 2015 UTC,How about Cesaro vs Rollins? ;)
WWE,3e0taw,tahakhan16,2,Tue Jul 21 11:16:42 2015 UTC,I don't understand how people can dislike someone like Cena so much. He has been putting on great matches and if he and Rollins face at Summerslam it will be another great match.  It probably won't be for a title though because both hold one already.
WWE,3e0taw,Washington_Fitz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:02:22 2015 UTC,"I have to agree. He's had some...dire matches(mostly with Rusev), but for most of the year, his matches have been top notch. He's selling moves, he's not calling them as much as he used to, and he's putting on a good show."
WWE,3e0taw,Driftwood44,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:47:21 2015 UTC,I highly doubt it'll be Cena vs Rollins
WWE,3e0taw,Holty12345,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:45:30 2015 UTC,i would love to see a Randy Orton vs Rollins or Ambrose vs Rollins but i think a Ambrose vs Rollins would be the better match.
WWE,3e0taw,merouane21,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:28:27 2015 UTC,"I might be alone in this but ill take any champ over seth at this point. Although, Cena definitely wouldnt be my first choice.......or my 10th choice even."

WWE,3e0taw,TimmothyWaters,0,Tue Jul 21 08:23:17 2015 UTC,Honestly I think Cena is just being used as filler because the title fight will not be the focus of summerslam this year.  So just put Cena in there for the time being.  It's not a good idea but I think that is what they are doing.   Lots of long promos.
WWE,3e0taw,Ag202020,0,Tue Jul 21 05:06:06 2015 UTC,Not to mention that the Cena/Rollins matches we have seen are not good.
WWE,3e2key,ATXBartenders,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:48:59 2015 UTC,He should definitely return at royal rumble and win. Just so that we can start having rumbles where the winner gets booed. That shit is annoying.

WWE,3e1ehh,estyll11,3,Tue Jul 21 05:25:31 2015 UTC,What were you watching? The diva matches were actually entertaining and The 6 man tag was decent. Raw this week was good but sadly most people just want wall to wall non stop 10/10 action so even if a raw is good if it isn't a instant classic people just jump to calling it shit.
WWE,3e1ehh,nWo4lifeSweet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:57:37 2015 UTC,"Not wall to wall action, but I went into last night expecting a bigger show. In that sense I thought more feuds for summerslam would be setup. I enjoyed Rollins-Cena promo, but even that felt as if it was just a one off, because it really had no base. Also, that main event had house show written all over it. I didn't like how they made it about lana and summer to finish the show."
WWE,3e1ehh,Becksdown,2,Tue Jul 21 14:00:03 2015 UTC,"What? The Segment vs Cena and Rollins was great, even the Crowd that was booing Cena, was on Cenas side this segment. Was great.  Divas Match was the best we ever had in a long time.  ME was also pretty good."
WWE,3e1ehh,gg_duce,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:55:41 2015 UTC,"Rollins-Cena was a solid promo, I've always enjoyed those two together. Their interaction last night had no base though. The main event was decent but the finish was what turned me off."

WWE,3dwn29,Smittx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:05:37 2015 UTC,But wouldn't he have called it off after Rollins attacked him?!
WWE,3dwn29,riacon,2,Mon Jul 20 18:06:59 2015 UTC,"Kane might have called off Undertaker helping Rollins after the attack and then Undertaker went to avenge Kane/satisfy his own personal vendetta instead. If Rollins didn't run off like he did after the lights when off, who is to say Undertaker would not have went after him next.   I assume Undertaker will be around in the background at least until Summerslam. We might see him go after Rollins on RAW for his attack on Kane."
WWE,3e1bhv,CrissXO,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:54:30 2015 UTC,"Having more diverse titles can only work when done right. I doubt they'll go back to Hardcore Championship titles or even Cruiserweight. Even if they did, they'd probably drop the ball and have it feel really lame to even be wearing that kind of belt. :-/"
WWE,3e1bhv,1QUrsu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:57:03 2015 UTC,Maybe you're right but it's such a shame seeing those superstars go to waste. I feel like a whole new title can be a good thing. It could be like when they first brought back the WWC in 2002.
WWE,3e1bhv,1QUrsu,2,Tue Jul 21 16:26:47 2015 UTC,"It is a shame. I always loved the Hardcore Specialists and Wrestlers who were beyond awesome in their niche but not going for the Championship belt. As it feels at the moment, you either go for a Championship run or you're basically buried in terribly boring territory with feuds that are meaningless as long as you're not fighting for a title belt.  Dean Ambrose would be terribly awesome in world where a Hardcore Championship exists. He could fight for it with the likes of Bray Wyatt, Luke Harper and some other wrestlers who have a pretty unconventional or special style. Add in Kevin Owens, who already showed he can do great, but a championship isn't in the near future for him. You have a whole set of great wrestlers who won't get near a really important title for a very long foreseeable time.  Same goes for Neville and a few of the high-flying, not-so-big but very agile guys. Give them back a REAL title to fight for, a title with meaning.  Neither the Intercontinental nor the US title have the weigth that a possible 'special rules' belt has, simply because you know that if a John Cena or a Brock Lesnar would want the belt, they could probably easily win it. Making big guys who go for the Heavyweigth or Championship Title ineligible for those special titles would give them meaning and purpose! And by special rules I mean Weight-Restriction (Heavyweight, Cruiserweight etc.), Hardcore Titles (no disqualification! First to tap or pinned loses.), Last Man Standing Champ (4-6man Title Matches ONLY - last man standing wins it - no bullshit pin the worst contender to beat the others too).  'Meaningless' Matches without being anywhere near a title with 'just' a long-going feud won't get first-timers interested in those wrestlers. First-Timers get hooked by Titles and might stay for the feuds."

WWE,3dxjfv,DrakusColt,3,Mon Jul 20 11:54:54 2015 UTC,"that was the dumbest ending to a match I've seen in a long time.  It made no sense.  Taker should have shown up after while Brock was celebrating.  Rollins was being pinned, had a 2 count when the lights went out.  The ref was still inches away and could clearly see Rollins shoulders for the the 3 count yet he just stops the count?  wtf?  Then Rollins leaves and no winner is announced, not even Brock by DQ for outside interference?  The WWE made a farce out of the main event.  I guess there was no main event last night.  No winner announced so a match never took place.  Horrible writing by the WWE.  I guess they thought Taker showing up would make the millions watching forget that an actual championship match was taking place."

WWE,3dwt1m,crowebot7485,7,Mon Jul 20 04:48:39 2015 UTC,"OK wait...you have a guy that's relatively unknown to the vast WWE audience. You take that guy & insert him into a months long fued with a guy that is the most widely known wrestlers on the planet. Unknown  wins the first match they have, runs his mouth for a couple months & gets into the ring with super-established guy - biggest on the planet - and loses a couple times. So what? Now most of the audience is familiar with unkown guy.  KO is fighting the biggest name and best WWE champion is the last decade. It's ok that he doesn't win here. He's getting THE RUB of a lifetime.   Oh, and you have the second biggest event of the year coming up. Imagine what a win at Summer Slam over Cena would do for KO.   Let this marinate some more, it'll make sense."
WWE,3dwt1m,SnowRidin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:18:14 2015 UTC,"Are they really going to have a fourth match? I kinda want this feud put to rest honestly. I hoped that the victor at battlegrounds would be declared the better wrestler for a while. Oh well, I guess they know what they're doing."
WWE,3dwt1m,Champion-Red,2,Mon Jul 20 17:40:40 2015 UTC,"I have no idea. I just threw that in there to drive the point home that we don't know what the plan is yet for the future & that there could be some hope that it all works out, but on a bigger stage."
WWE,3dwt1m,SnowRidin,7,Mon Jul 20 18:01:23 2015 UTC,"He kicked out of more finishers than anyone since the rock faced cena at mania. Nothing at all was undone. The match ended how it should have, I hate the cena character but to lose tonight would have been even worse."
WWE,3dwt1m,tonyh750,2,Mon Jul 20 05:23:13 2015 UTC,"He'll be fine, I think this feud was meant as more of a teaser for KO's future than some big coming out party"
WWE,3dwt1m,bellboy3,2,Mon Jul 20 15:15:42 2015 UTC,"They in no way wasted him. He doesn't need that belt to help him get over. So him not winning it, he'll be ok. It's better for them to keep building the legitimacy of the us title and give to a nxter that might not be able to get them self over as much as owens."

WWE,3dwt1m,RegretlessStrike,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:00:20 2015 UTC,"You're definitely not wrong.  Now it looks like his victory against Cena is just a fluke.  I think they're putting him back into NXT, to feud with Balor for the title."
WWE,3dwt1m,shitastrophe,3,Mon Jul 20 05:03:49 2015 UTC,No... He just made it to the damn main roster he has plenty of time to make it to the top.
WWE,3dwt1m,Washington_Fitz,2,Mon Jul 20 10:59:20 2015 UTC,"IMO they should have Owens terrorize Cena, possibly even putting him out of action for a while while Owens possibly wins a title. Continue to build up Owens as the great heel that he is, and when Cena returns you have a great match set up yet again. This allows Owens to prove himself against other superstars while giving us a small break from Cena. If they can do enough of a good job villainizing Owens, Cena would be so welcomed back by fans upon his return.  Only thing is I really doubt Cena would want to step aside at all unless he was injured, so this'll probably never happen..."
WWE,3dwt1m,McWigan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:01:15 2015 UTC,Hopefully this means that they can explore a Owens/Cesaro feud that can only enrich the position of both superstars. The match in question was epic and kept Owens in a strong position.
WWE,3dwt1m,darthatheos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:58:46 2015 UTC,"I think they still have time to make Owens into something great, but I do agree that they wasted him last night.  Owens has been trending towards being a superstar, and I feel like the erased what could have been the biggest moment since Bryan won at Mania.  I think we underestimate how well he had won the crowd over at the main roster level.  Having him lose to Cena in an STF makes it look like Cena just doing what Cena does.  Who can they book him against now that is on the level of Cena?  Going from losing a feud to Cena to feuding with Ambrose is a huge step down.  See: The Rise and Fall of Bray Wyatt."
WWE,3dwt1m,ax3644,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:05:56 2015 UTC,"I am fine with the Owens loss. The biggest issue was the submission finish. This came in a day and age where submitting comes as as incredibly weak. Cena's STF looks particularly weak and he is not known for being a submission expert. Back when the Angle Lock, Walls of Jericho, and he-who-must-not-be-named's Crippler Crossface were tapping opponents out on a regular basis, losing to a devastating submission was not a big assassination of one's will.   The announcers have been selling tapping out as looking weak for so long now. ""Now we see what this kid's made of."" via Cole is just one example right before he tapped out. You cannot have KO kick out of an Avalanche AA and then lose to the weakest looking submission around. It looks ridiculous. The match was INCREDIBLE but that ending was the equivalent of getting punched in the junk right before you finish.   tldr; STF is weak and tapping out to it hurts KO much more than being pinned."
WWE,3dwt1m,Blackfyre23,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:36:45 2015 UTC,"That's fair. And maybe my overall dissatisfaction with the results is subconsciously effected by this idea more than I'd realized until now.  I still think that Owens winning and then losing a bigger spectacle at Summerslam if they plan to run back a similar match again would have built KO up more after the eventual end of the feud, but the tap out did bother me."

Give me Sandow, Cesaro, Rusev, Rollins, Reigns, or Wyatt any day of the week over KO.  Hell, I even like Neville and Bo Dallas more than KO.  I don't really like Ambrose either, his character is silly to me in the same way that KO is silly and contrived.  At least Ambrose has the shield background to lend him some credibility and make his matches at least watchable."
WWE,3dwt1m,Tobeatkingkoopa,3,Mon Jul 20 13:57:28 2015 UTC,"I can only speak for myself but I find KO more interesting than Daniel Bryan, Ryback, Ziggler, and other wrestlers people like.  I guess it just comes down to their wrestling style and persona on who people like? That's what makes it so fun every PPV for my friends and I is that we all have our favorites and can't really explain why.  My friend is a HUGE Seth Rollins fan and I was hoping Brock would win last night. It made for a fun match to watch."

He's actually one of the few guys whose character and feud makes perfect sense, he's sick of guys like cena who aren't any better at wrestling getting all the fame and publicity while KO toils away in the indies for years.   You don't have to like KO but calling him contrived is just poor choice of words"

WWE,3dwt1m,RJ9225,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:11:49 2015 UTC,"Great point. No, I don't think you're wrong. I would have loved to seen K.O. win tonight and legitimize all they have done to build him up initially. The Balor loss I understood as having him drop the NXT title and set up for a U.S title run. But what happened tonight was just confusing. When he tapped, I thought ""well, so much for that push"". I would have loved to see K.O. pull out a victory,set up Cesaro/Cena/Owens at S.S. then if WWE wants Cena with the title again, fine. But at least solidify the Owens push first. And do whatever it takes to push Cesaro vs Owens for a few weeks afterwards in singles competition. Just my opinion,of course"
WWE,3dwt1m,Re-AnImAt0r,0,Mon Jul 20 05:18:09 2015 UTC,"why in the blue hell would KO rather work with Cesaro (a nobody) over Cena (the biggest star in the compnay)?  why in the blue hell would the WWE want to build one of it's next big stars against Cesaro (again, a nobody) rather than Cena (again, biggest star in the company)?  that would make little sense all around.  You can't build a big star by having him work nobodies.  He has to work with a big star to become a big star.  This is called ""the rub"" in the industry.  The only rub KO or anybody could get from working with Cesaro is a back massage those Swedes are known for being so great at.    I'm sure KO is thrilled to continue to work with and get the rub from the biggest star in the company and not being relegated to working with nobodies."

WWE,3dwt1m,Tussinwolf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:36:47 2015 UTC,"They deflated all of the momentum Owens had, Cena didn't even give him a reasonably good STF to tap to.  Cena's win didn't advance anything in a positive way and cut the legs out from yet another rising star."
WWE,3dwt1m,octotopo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:22:42 2015 UTC,I totally agree with the OP. Owens beats Cena and has a world of momentum behind him you literally had the next huge WWE heel in your hands. Then he loses his next 3 big matches clean and he's going to lose against baylor at takeover. his mystique as a monster heel is dead
WWE,3dwt1m,Re-AnImAt0r,2,Mon Jul 20 11:33:15 2015 UTC,I'm 100% sure KO would have rather lost last night and continue working with Cena for the next few months than to have won and be working with Miz or Sandrow next week.  Something tells me hanging with John Cena in a long feud is better for his career than winning the US Title and defending it against Cesaro or Miz next week.  The title belts are a work.  You don't really earn more money by holding one.  What earns you more money is recognition.  The only way KO is going to get more recognition than working with Cena is if they decided to put him in a program with Brock Lesnar.  I think he's doing fine for a guy who was in the indies wrestling in National Guard armories not long ago.
WWE,3dwt1m,octotopo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:29:07 2015 UTC,I don't think you're going to get anymore Cena/KO matches for a while.The entire build to last night match was it was the rubber match the match to end the fued
WWE,3dwt1m,Re-AnImAt0r,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:32:38 2015 UTC,"I will bet you any amount of money that you're wrong.  you name the amount.  You  haven't been paying attention to the build over the past month.  the entire point to the feud over the past month is that KO has been saving Cena from losing the title because he is going to be the one to beat Cena for it.  It's not a want, he HAS to be the one.  That is why he was helping Cena to retain the title.  the feud will continue until Cena loses the title to KO.  That is why Cena sold KO as being superman last night, sitting down staring at the ref like, ""I can't beat this guy"".  At Summerslam, KO becomes the new champion.   Cena will either take time off or be put into a program with somebody else who attacks him while KO builds up a nice win record with the US belt.  Then Cena will chase KO for the title for a few more months.  watch Raw tonight.  KO and probably Cena both will have promos about last night's match and their next match."
WWE,3dwt1m,octotopo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:56:30 2015 UTC,"that makes no sense, Cena's won clean twice what point would he have to fight him again? However this is WWE so their booking often overlooks things like logic so you're probably right"
WWE,3dwt1m,Re-AnImAt0r,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:19:19 2015 UTC,"I've been watching not only the WWF but all wrestling for over 35 years.  I don't believe I've ever seen a program end after 3 matches...especially a program with a major star with such a buildup as this.  what point would he have to fight him again?  because he beat the shit out of him the entire match, kicked out of finisher after finisher leaving Cena sitting on the ground just staring at the ref like, ""how can I beat this guy"" then won on a fluke, 10 seconds of luck,  far from beating him convincingly.    This is how stars were made 35 years ago, the same as they're made today.  Ric Flair didn't beat Sting twice then move on to leave Sting on the low-card to be released a month later.  No, the guy on top has to work with a guy, giving him the rub, to get him over as a legitimate main eventer.   Nobody in the history of the business was made by 3 matches.  Nobody."
WWE,3dwt1m,octotopo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:37:03 2015 UTC,I would think making a guy tap out is literally the most convincing way you can beat a guy but what do I know? I've only been watching wrestling for 20 years  anywho  I guess we'll both see what happens
WWE,3dwt1m,Re-AnImAt0r,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:13:38 2015 UTC,"you watched a different match than I.  I watched Cena get his ass kicked the entire match.  All offense he was able to dish out was immediately kicked out of by KO.  Even when Cena gave him the FU Owens kicked out on 1 (Cole said kicked out at 2 but he kicked out as the ref's hand hit the mat for the 1 count).  After spending the entire match getting his ass kicked while looking solemnly defeated as KO no-sold his offense he got KO in the STFU to make him tap.  getting your ass kicked for a half hour then getting a submission move on your opponent is not a convincing win.  It was a stroke of luck that allowed Cena to win the match while putting KO over as a badass who can kick Cena's ass for a half hour to continue the storyline, allow KO to chase and beat Cena for the title.  If KO had won,  there's no more storyline.  Cena's the main eventer, not the rookie.  Not much of a story in the biggest name in the industry chasing a rookie who was wrestling in school gymnasiums this time last year.    If Cena had won convincingly, no storyline in Cena destroying some rookie.  Cena has beaten the shit out of one rookie, time to move on to the next.    The storyline is KO beating the hell out of Cena for a half hour, being a hair away from being the new US champion only for Cena to pull a desperation move out of his ass to get the win and retain the title for one more night while both men know Cena had his ass handed to him for a half hour and KO was the better man that night.  The next time they meet (at summerslam) Cena won't get the desperation win and the guy who beat the shit out of him for a half hour last night will do so again and actually get the win.  That's the storyline.    That's what the promos tonight on Raw will be about and that's what people will pay money to see next month."

WWE,3dwt1m,Re-AnImAt0r,2,Mon Jul 20 09:22:04 2015 UTC,you were certain of the outcome but it didn't go as you thought and you're disappointed?  wtf?  not knowing or even being able to guess what is going to happen is the biggest draw to the show.  That's what made everybody love the Attitude Era.    If you're disappointed you were SURE something was going to happen and it didn't you clearly want the WWE to give you the most boring and predictable show they can.

WWE,3dwt1m,Blackfyre23,0,Mon Jul 20 16:38:26 2015 UTC,He brings a more diverse set of moves than 95% of the roster and he sucks? How can he possibly blame himself when he was the one booked to lose or do you think it was his idea to lose? I'm not even a big KO fan but it is super obvious the guy is more talented than most of the roster.
WWE,3dwt1m,chibi-ken805,0,Mon Jul 20 19:23:59 2015 UTC,"diverse? he stole 90% of cena's move and still couldn't win, how original is he. talented against most of the roster? you cannot be serious lmao. finn balor has talent, neville has talent, owens has none of that. he is just huge tool that can wrestle. and not a very good one either, on the count that he has to be cena's biggest fan, using his own moves cuz he cant win with his own. yes, he is so diverse and original."
WWE,3dwt1m,Blackfyre23,0,Tue Jul 21 03:59:58 2015 UTC,"Oh man you must be trolling. That is hilarious. So I guess he stole the avalanche fisherman buster, swanton bomb, moonsault, steen breaker, package slam, pop-up powerbomb, fireman's carry neckbreaker, and that is just off the top of my head. You must not watch the matches he had with Cena. In case you aren't familiar, he stole the STF and AA because that is what heels do; heels mock and are disrespectful. You must be confused or have vision problems."
WWE,3dwt1m,chibi-ken805,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:56:09 2015 UTC,"whatever it is hes doing, hes not very original. he is clearly cena's biggest fan, also hardy's and even shawn michaels super kick. he sucks.   i think the original move he has is that pop up powerbomb and cannon ball lmao"
WWE,3dwt1m,Blackfyre23,0,Tue Jul 21 18:02:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah using moves like the Steen breaker, off the top rope fisherman's buster, Go Home Driver, and such are really unoriginal. The dude looks like an out of shape couch jockey and he can still hit textbook moonsaults and senton bombs. It is super obvious KO is one of the most versatile guys and has new and refreshing moves. You can hate his character but saying he is a bad wrestler or unoriginal is beyond foolish."

WWE,3dwt1m,Liberalreddit,0,Tue Jul 21 22:41:21 2015 UTC,"If you want to build the US title you do so by waiting for somebody as good as Cena to dethrone cena. If Owens wins last night then the US title becomes the same as the intercontinental title one again, AKA irrelevent back scratching after creative writes itself into a corner... Owens isn't the next Cena, nor does he truly have signs of it. His character is what it is and if it hasn't captivated the audience into demanding he become champion by now then he's a lost cause.   Just imagine if Owens had won. Is he capable of makibg Cesaro the next big thing? Not really... Does an Owens US ""open challenge"" somehow give credibility to the next NXT star to stand in the ring with him on Raw? Not at all, but that's what you have right now with Cena. If Cena has to stay champ for 2 years in order to truly elevate the belt then so be it. He shouldn't lose until the next Rock or Stone Cold comes around.  It's better to waste a couple PPVS worth of writing on Owens than an entire years worth of writing on Cena and his efforts to elevate the US championship."
WWE,3dwt1m,Liberalreddit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:50:16 2015 UTC,"The inability of Owens to put over subsequent stars is an interesting point, however ultimately I don't see how they couldn't have solidified the push -and- set up for establishing credibility for future stars.  If Owens had won last night, taking the title, he would have been legitimized, and the time and effort put into the feud would have been worth it.  Over the next month or so before Summerslam, they could have intensified his heel status, preparing for a Triple Threat or Fatal Four Way vs Cena, Cesaro, and potentially Rusev, in which Cena gets back his title after a serious match between them.  The brief run as US champion by Owens, and the fact that he beat Cena twice would have put him over, even if he lost the belt back to Cena at Summerslam.  Then, after Summerslam, Cena would have the title back to continue his Open Challenges and keep working with the new talent.   As it is now, the whole wow-factor of the matches and the fact that Owens actually beat Cena has been squashed under the idea that it was a fluke and no one will really be able of beating Cena.    This just became a long, 3 month US Open Challenge where Owens got to look good, but then Cena wins and nothing changes for anyone and Owens is right back where he started, only without his NXT belt."
WWE,3dwt1m,Re-AnImAt0r,2,Mon Jul 20 12:19:10 2015 UTC,"Owens isn't back where he started, he's one of the top heels that proved he could co-main event a couple PPVS with one of the biggest stars in the industry. If you give him the belt for a month, then you have to give the next star that rises to his level the belt for a month (presumably Cesaro). Doing that just cheapens the title, and makes Cena look weaker than he is. It's better to write yourself into a corner and bail than to pass the title around like it's meaningless again. Eventually a star will come up that is so great the audience threatens to riot if he doesn't beat Cena. Owens wasn't that guy. His act has been the exact same for 10 years, so if he isn't a larger than life star by now to fans, putting the US championship on him won't make it so. I like Owens, I think he put on good matches. But it's just not his time. You can't sacrifice a years worth of writing to elevate the belt for a guy like him.  Be patient and don't change the title until the next Rock or Stone Cold comes around. Then they'll take the wrestling world by storm, take the US and the WWE championship in the same year."
WWE,3dwt1m,JCRexon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:04:48 2015 UTC,"ah yes, because clearly KO is going to retire now and the feud won't continue.  Looking awesome in 3 matches v/s the biggest star in the industry doesn't help one's career at all.  Continuing a feud against the biggest star in the world won't help his career.  He should have beaten Cena last night, Brock Lesnar next month then Rollins the month after to become the biggest star in the company in less than 6 months.  Anything less and he may as well be the Brooklyn Brawler.     I'm glad there was no such thing as the internet when Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, Ric Flair, Sting, Dusty Rhodes, Harley Race, etc. were breaking into the WWF/NWA.  You kids today would have branded them wastes of human flesh for not receiving the Diesel treatment and winning every belt within their first year."
WWE,3dwt1m,Re-AnImAt0r,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:39:59 2015 UTC,"I guess a real issue that needs to be considered is that the main event picture is messed up pretty badly currently. If KO was made to be this monster heel that took apart the show's Superman then where would he go from there?  We already have a monster heel (Bork) so that role is filled - although you can argue he is a tweener at this point. I would personally like to see Cena and KO split for a bit and see Cena get pushed against Lesnar. However, instead of rehashing those tired matches, have KO come out and just decimate Cena while 'The Authority' watches on with laughter.   I know it seems similar to what they did recently, with Dolph winning against the odds, but that's a solid idea just was handled poorly. I'd love to see a few months of something like: Owens, Rusev, Rollins vs. Cena, Ceasaro (he should never had joined the Authority imo) and an Ambrose figure"

Saxton is the worst commentator I've ever heard and JBL does nothing but repeat the same stupid phrases every week and talk about everything but the actual people in the ring.  They need a fast talking technical voice that can accurately and excitingly call the actual wrestling action that's happening in the ring.  Someone who knows a lot more maneuvers than just the finishing moves.  They need this person to be the main voice, with Cole being back on the side as a voice of reason who reacts and comments on the wrestler's accomplishments, personalities, and goals.  Perhaps bring it back to two commentators and rotate guest wrestler commentators every few matches or so."
WWE,3dy6ne,snubenhymer,2,Mon Jul 20 20:47:58 2015 UTC,BRING BACK JR Problem solved
WWE,3dy6ne,YzMENTALzY,2,Tue Jul 21 01:16:19 2015 UTC,"I think the only way for the WWE to fix their commentary is to return to the old formula of having charismatic former stars do color commentary.  Right now they are using JBL.  A guy who had a short singles run, was never over and doesn't even know the meaning of the world charismatic.    In the past they have used Jesse Ventura, Roddy Piper, Randy Savage, Mr. Perfect Curt Hennig, etc. in this role quite successfully.  All men known the world over to be great wrestlers and very charismatic.    The problem is I can't think of a single damn wrestler who fits this mold today.  The only name I can think of is CM Punk and there's no way in hell he would do it.  They'd have to pull an active superstar like Wade Barrett and have him do his Bad News gimmick on the mic or something.    Recently the WWE has not been putting out many charismatic superstars who can hold their own on the mic.  Those that have are far too wealthy and famous now to  do the job.  No chance Steve Austin or the Rock is going to do commentary on Raw.  The best they can get is Justin Hawk Bradshaw."

It's obvious they're bringing Owens into the WWE as a more permanent fixture, he slready lost the NXT title, he should have picked up this title (hell, even a cheating finish would've worked if they didn't want Cena to lose credibility) and continued the feud having ""embarrassed"" Cena."

WWE,3dweb6,thedarknessmonster,5,Mon Jul 20 04:02:00 2015 UTC,"I just don't understand the lack of foresight.  The hype and build up for a match at Summerslam is far greater if the title is on Owens rather than Cena.    Which is more interesting, Cena in a 4 way match against Owens, Cesaro, and Rusev, or Champion Owens defending his newly acquired title vs the three men he's spent the past month screwing over?  It's the same match, but they screwed up the billing and build up if they do -anything- like that for Summerslam."

Did I really have to spell that out for you... ?  Maybe it isn't ""bad story telling"" maybe you're just a short signed poor story interpreter...  I've said from day 1 Owens is a bitch compared to Cena. People called me crazy and said his matches against Cena were match of the year status. Gee, somehow Nevills, Cesaro, Sammy, and Rusev all had match of the year battles against Cena too in the last year... hmm... maybe it's that Cena is good? Maybe it wasn't Owens that made Cena look good, but Cena that managed to make half the roster seem more credible...?  Na, fuck that, right reddit? Cena sucks derrrrrrrrrrrp! Go owens hurrrrrrrr!   I'm just happy owens is about to go the route of countless other wrestlers fed to the Cena machine. He shouldn't have to pass the belt until someone worthy comes and takes it from him. That won't happen until we find the next Cena, and that's not happening for a long time.   You want to build the prestige of the US championship? This is how you do it. You make a legit superstar strip it from Cena, not some midcard fat boy. You don't just give it away bc ""deerrrrrr creative wrote their selves in a corner they pretty much HAVE to let this guy win now..."" No... sorry, but no... that puts the US championship right back where the intercontinental championship currently is. Aka midcard back scratching irrelevent bullshit.  Honestly what would owens have done with the belt? Rivaled with Cesaro? Think Cesaro becomes the next big thing by beating owens for the US title? Think anyone becomes the next big thing by beating owens for the US title? How about NO...   The title isn't ready to change hands yet. Cena needs to keep it for at least another year. It doesn't hurt shit by letting him keep it. It only sets the stage for the next Rock or Stone Cold to take it. It only makes that moment that much better."
WWE,3dweb6,Liberalreddit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:58:52 2015 UTC,"Here's my point:  Imagine how shitty ""The Dark Knight"" would have seemed if after everything Batman gets to the building where the Joker is and when Batman tells him he's cornered, Joker just says ""Well. shit. Take me in, Bats."" And then Batman slaps cuffs on him, walks him down to the cops, and credits. That would have been awful. Because the whole fight up to that point meant something and you devalue the fight that just took place by having it lead to nothing.   Additional points:  There is no one that feels like a legitimate threat anymore with Lesnar being a face now. None. Because if your idea is that you make Owens tap to look like a bitch, then you've damaged his image to help a guy that needs none.   I never said Cena was bad. I think he's better than people will give him credit because they can't overlook how stale his bit has gotten. But the fact is, creative doesn't write themselves into a corner because they write the same bit over and over. And you can say all you want that it's lack of foresight on my part, but the fact is WWE constantly squashes monster heels. They did it to Wyatt. They did it to Rusev. And they made a big stride towards doing that tonight with Owens. What's the common denominator that links to the downfall of everyone of those wrestlers? John Cena. But, here's the bitch of it. I don't think it's all Cena's fault. I really don't. It's the fact that creative doesn't know how to write for him anymore.   They assume that because they've made him into Superman that they can't allow him to be beaten. But that would, in fact, make him more compelling. You know what the best selling Superman comic of all time is? The Death of Superman. If there was just ONE GUY that Cena just could not put away. One guy that had Cena's number every single time they met, it would be fascinating to watch. To see, again, that same look he had after the top rope AA would be unforgettable. Then it would be even more unforgettable the moment he's finally able to beat that guy. And what's even better for WWE? Cena doesn't even have to turn heel in that scenario. The kids can still look up to him because he really doesn't ever give up. He keeps trying to conquer that one goal. They ALMOST did that with Lesnar and then it all just went away.  John Cena needs his Lex Luthor. He needs Doomsday. Vince McMahon is on the record as saying he's in the business of making superheroes. You can't have superheroes without supervillains. It's villains that make heroes and their decisions that much more interesting and compelling to watch. I just think WWE has lost sight of that.  TL;DR: Too bad."

WWE,3dwy22,Lost_Downtown,3,Mon Jul 20 17:15:22 2015 UTC,". My problem with Lesnar is his contract. Which he works only a part time schedule. He is rarely on tv, and when he is. It is usually the Heyman show. He may look intimidating, and beat up a few characters like Cena, but his weakness is lack of being on full time, and continually connecting as a character. At least Rollins is there every Monday night putting in love to his fans of hardworking performer. Lesnar comes across as not giving a fuck about the fans other than promoting himself for money. He has no connection to myself either as a heel or a face. I sit there and say to myself. Oh look who showed up to grace us with his presence. Whoop de fucking do."

WWE,3dwj5h,Spyder73,3,Mon Jul 20 14:11:10 2015 UTC,"Two finishers and, more clearly, a low blow are heelish moves, even interference, but seeing the crowd's reaction tonight they might just say that Taker was extremely angry when he did what he did. Trying to make Taker a heel would be a horrible,horrible decision."
WWE,3dwj5h,The_Last_Tweener,2,Mon Jul 20 06:45:35 2015 UTC,Agree. Undertaker is too beloved. But that low blow bothers me. Very heelish move.
WWE,3dwj5h,mosjoh08,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:59:52 2015 UTC,"I was like, ""wtf, did the Undertaker just low blow Brock?"" Totally not the Undertaker I remember lol, I thought it was good."
WWE,3dwj5h,MrCanuck87,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:16:08 2015 UTC,"The low blow was clearly a sign of Taker doing whatever he can to stop the beast. Did not come off as a heel at all, in fact, he totally came off as a huge face coming back for revenge."
WWE,3dwj5h,chenchango,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:37:05 2015 UTC,Judging by Raw last night. There is no heel or face in the feud. Just two titans filled with fury trying to destroy each other.
WWE,3dwj5h,The_Last_Tweener,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:44:56 2015 UTC,"Yep, I think it might also have to be No DQ to allow for Taker to win. Probably what the low blow was all about."
WWE,3dwj5h,chenchango,3,Tue Jul 21 21:51:23 2015 UTC,"Undertaker is face.  Face/heel is not determined by who is cheered or boo'ed. Face and heel is not defined by the actions in the ring, the amount of destruction they cause, or by who their opponent is. Face and heel is determined by how the wrestler treats fans. A bad guy can beat up another bad guy, but if they are friendly with the fans, they are a face. A face can beat up a face, but that doesn't make him heel. And vice versa. It is not determined by how the fans react to the guy. Fans can booo a guy, but that doesn't make him heel (roman reigns). Fans can cheer a guy, but that doesn't make him face. It's not the fans who determine who's a face or heel, nor the opponents they face, nor the cheers or boos. It all comes down to how the wrestler treats the fans (if he is mean to fans, he's a heel; if he is kind to fans, he's a face -- easy way to tell usually is if they open to high-fives or touching from the fans during the show or if they avoid fans going to the ring, or by what they say on the mic to the crowd)."
WWE,3dwj5h,macfligh,0,Mon Jul 20 10:58:09 2015 UTC,The low blow was a heel move. I say heel.
WWE,3dwj5h,ReDevelopers,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:04:26 2015 UTC,It is a bit confusing. Whether you consider Brock a face or heel there is no denying the crowd loves him. Brock also beat Undertaker fair and square and Undertaker saved Seth Rollins and kicked Brock in the nuts to get an advantage - that seems very heel to me. Yet he saluted the crowd. Is their some deeper meaning to this? No..... Its just your typical inconsistent confusing poorly thought out WWE booking.
WWE,3dwj5h,mosjoh08,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:58:56 2015 UTC,"I don't get the crotch shot. Other than that, both guys transcend the normal heel-face paradigm so this should be an interesting feud"
WWE,3dwj5h,bellboy3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:17:53 2015 UTC,"I'd like to think that it was a heel turn. It could prove very interesting for a reversal of roles for the two of them. But, best bet is that ""Undertaker was so angry he had to use a low blow""."

WWE,3dwim7,chibi-ken805,4,Mon Jul 20 03:00:53 2015 UTC,"Baby brother and assault on Kane make most sense. If that's it, he's at least semi aligned with the Authority. If it was revenge based on The Streak, he would've popped up and saved John Cena from his first visit to Suplex City when it was more relevant. I just hope this doesn't set up for Taker/Lesnar at Summer Slam.   I'm a big Taker fan and was excited to see him return tonight - my jaw literally dropped but his physical abilities have been devolving into the classification of 'tough to watch' starting with his match at WM vs CM Punk. This is doubly painful to watch - especially if you've been watching since his debut with the MDM. He looked like he had been forced to interfere tonight with the way he struggled to Tombstone Brock.    Also, It would honestly shock me to see Lesnar let go of the championship belt when he's clearly got an auto rematch for interference. Let Taker and Sting start something at SS and build slowly to WM."

If they fight at Summerslam it better be some crazy stipulation like a ladder match or something. So disappointing.
WWE,3dwb80,theman102,2,Mon Jul 20 02:18:30 2015 UTC,"A stipulation would HAVE to be put in. Not that tonight's match wasn't good, but just to up the spectacle"
WWE,3dwb80,theAmazingDead,2,Mon Jul 20 03:00:15 2015 UTC,"This has been the most confusing feud ever.  I have absolutely no idea what they are planning with Owens.  He has his rematch with Balor, and his feud with Joe (that seems to have been forgotten about).  Throwing him back on NXT exclusively doesn't make sense after this Cena feud though, him being on the losing end aside, Cena did give him an amazing rub and he's become a bigger name on the main roster than a lot of other guys who have been there for way longer.  I believe they do have something in mind, I just can't figure out where they are going with this yet."
WWE,3dwb80,mwurquha,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:16:50 2015 UTC,"I thought Owens would get the win via DQ, via Cesaro interference...   Sets up a nice little triple-threat match for the belt.

We spent most of the weekend camped out front of the hotel the guys were staying at getting pictures and meeting anyone we could, but didn't see Taker the whole time at the hotel.  Then finally, at the very end of the weekend, literally at the front entrance of the airport as we were going to check in to fly home we ran into him as he was getting out of his cab.  Turns out he was actually very nice, and even at an airport, trying to make a flight, which is probably the worst possible time to get accosted by fans, he stopped and took the time to take a picture with my little bro.

He'd honestly get hurt. Can you imagine him getting thrown around like Rollins? I sure can't; he could barely pick up Lesnar.   I'd say somewhere this has to be a buildup for a SS match that has Rollins vs Lesnar, and Taker will be used for other purposes. Maybe he's working with Kane and the Authority? Maybe he's out for vengeance for his WM loss? I heard Sting was being thrown around - doesn't he hate the Authority?

The only closest ""reveal"" I experienced from this sub is before Wrestlemania 31, someone legit posted saying that Sting and HHH match will be interrupted by NWO.  Also Sting going for world title is very unlikely .. Undertaker is too mainstream and too late for him to heel turn. He is already too favorable. John cena via undertaker seems very unlikely..  Edit: OP Is right about Undertaker"
WWE,3dssy8,Lousy_hater,-5,Sun Jul 19 02:59:35 2015 UTC,I have my sources let's just say that.
WWE,3dssy8,CruxfieldVictor,-1,Sun Jul 19 03:14:03 2015 UTC,"Can't wait for you to be wrong. Undertaker doesn't function in the realms of Face/Heel at this point and for him to fight Cena is just plain stupid. It'd be nothing but lackluster fanservice and neither man would have anything to gain.  Tell your source that it isn't healthy to be blowing smoke out of their ass.

WWE,3dssy8,nickiecz,0,Sun Jul 19 03:09:20 2015 UTC,Your right he is too big of a name to turn heel. But it's all about shock value. WWE wants something big for Network subscribers.

WWE,3dok7o,Doctorpat,5,Sat Jul 18 02:21:06 2015 UTC,European title would be irrelevant nowadays. It'd be nostalgic if Rusev crushed Cena and renamed the U.S. Title to the European Championship.  I'd rather see a Cruiserweight Championship if anything.   Less titles are best for bidness with the flourishing NXT division.

WWE,3dok7o,DrakusColt,2,Sun Jul 19 00:14:18 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the WWF started to become stale and boring shortly after they introduced the Hardcore Championship.  I believe it was the cause of the death of the Attitude Era, the first shot fired in the war against itself.  I also believe the WCW Hardcore Championship was the beginning of the end of that company."
WWE,3dok7o,Kalanth,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:49:31 2015 UTC,The Hardcore belt lost a bit of luster when it went pure gimmick with the 24/7 defense.  EDIT: Stupid auto correct
WWE,3dok7o,TheBluntSharpie,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:15:42 2015 UTC,"Doesn't make sense though in the era of concussions and no-chair-shots-to-heads. What I'm saying is there is the biggest line-up of European wrestlers ever and no European Title. Whats especially baffling is that, based on this real picture, they made one at some point recently."
WWE,3dok7o,McAulay_a,2,Sat Jul 18 00:48:39 2015 UTC,I still think they could have a Hardcore title in the PG era even without the chair shots to the head and current distaste for blood.  Most of what made the title interesting in the Attitude era was the 24/7 rule and backstage fights.  I feel like the current product suffers from the lack of antics away from the ring and bringing back the Hardcore title could be done in a way as nod to the good old days without pissing off the sponsors.
WWE,3dok7o,tritian,-1,Sat Jul 18 07:42:51 2015 UTC,Why not both?
WWE,3dok7o,kashifsakhan,2,Sat Jul 18 00:55:00 2015 UTC,"rusev and cesaro deserve better, and hopefully cesaro is going to get it soon enough"
WWE,3dok7o,BadMrFrostySC,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:20:57 2015 UTC,Bringing it back will just take away from the already weak Intercontinental title and US title. We need someone to carry the Intercontinental title for a while and to have some big names compete for that strap.
WWE,3dok7o,kashifsakhan,3,Sat Jul 18 00:24:49 2015 UTC,"I think what they've done with the US title basically since Rusev got it, its the most relevant its ever been in WWE."
WWE,3dok7o,Yarota,2,Sat Jul 18 06:17:05 2015 UTC,"But look at how much of the roster ISN'T in either of those title scenes, but are feuding every week. Why are they even wrestling if it doesn't some how by hook or by crook involve a title? Thats a real pet peeve of mine when it comes to pro wrestling."
WWE,3dok7o,HamSandwich13,3,Sat Jul 18 00:50:36 2015 UTC,"I agree, but having another title will just mean another poorly booked strap.  I think people like Cena, Sheamus, and Orton should be competing for the IC and US titles. Look at how good the US title scene has been since Cena won it. Just having him carry the strap has given it real credibility.  WWE needs to go back to the days of the 80s and early 90s where your number 2 guy, the guy who could really put on a show (Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels etc) were the IC title holders, and your big names (Hogan, Flair, Undertaker etc) were the Heavyweight champs."
WWE,3dok7o,long435,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:13:08 2015 UTC,Since there was a television championship how about a wwe network championship?
WWE,3dok7o,Sega32X,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:55:00 2015 UTC,I'd like them to make a belt that cost 9.99
WWE,3dok7o,The_Metrist,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:43:16 2015 UTC,An internet champion?
WWE,3dok7o,Cash091,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:04:44 2015 UTC,I agree with the opinions that we don't need another title. But I always loved the way the EC looked. I always said if I bought a replica it would be that or the WCW TV title.
WWE,3dok7o,jljpt1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:35:57 2015 UTC,"I say scrap the Intercontinental (the name has always nagged me anyway -- the world is Intercontinental. And yes, I get the history and the meaning behind it but still... I digress) and create a ""Network"" title. Boost the amount of ""Beast in the East"" recordings that feel like house shows with the cameras turned on.  The Network Title can change anywhere. Any little house show to any one getting the push.   We all know the WHC isn't changing unless it's a PPV. The Diva's is predictable at this point with NXT invasion (and hopefully they scrap that for the Women's belt). US title births great matches but is very unlikely to change hands outside of a PPV. Ditto for TT. So make the Network Title something you genuinely don't know when its going to be dropped."
WWE,3dok7o,DrakusColt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:51:40 2015 UTC,"I was expecting Cesaro to swap out for the European Title when he had it... then Rusev, especially since he was feuding with Swagger, who was gaining good heat during that.  Missed opportunities man...  we need the US Title to be swapped, and Ambrose can bring back the Hardcore Title and get his picture on the wall!"
WWE,3dok7o,kashifsakhan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:42:39 2015 UTC,"I love the europen title but after the excitement of it being brought back died down, it would just get lost in the shuffle again."
WWE,3dok7o,chibi-ken805,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:53:41 2015 UTC,"There needs to be a Television Championship. The NWA and WCW Television Championships used to be a big deal.   The WWF has two men's singles belts, World Champion and Intercontinental Champion.  They added the European Championship so Bulldog could have a title reign, and then gave it to Michaels for whatever stupid reasons, probably because he begged Vince.  It was worthless as soon as it started crawling around the mid card, but some great guys held the title.  It lost all value once D'Lo Brown lost it.  It was further devalued with the introduction of the Hardcore Championship, and eventually wasn't even worth mentioning, so they unified it with the IC.  If they were to bring it back, they would have to un-unify it with the IC.  How would they do that? How could you write that for television and have it make sense?  I'd like to see a Pan-Asian Championship, only defended in Japan, Indonesia, Philippines, China, Korea, India, etc."
WWE,3dok7o,lwst99,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:59:51 2015 UTC,"I think it would be cool to have a Television title, with a stipulation that the champion has to defend the title a certain number of times every month. That could make for some interesting and entertaining stories. You could have the face champions doing an open challenge like what John Cena did with the US title recently, or you could have a heel champion trying to weasel his way out of defending the title the way Chris Jericho used to do back in WCW.  I'd tune in to watch that!"

WWE,3dprkt,estyll11,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:53:07 2015 UTC,WWE might be bringing back Taker to boost the number of Network subscriptions during the quarterly earnings call at the end of the month. I personally feel that maybe. just maybe the Deadman might make a special appearance this Sunday.
WWE,3dprkt,Cyberglace7,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:07:22 2015 UTC,This makes a lot of sense. They'll want as many eyeballs as possible for Summerslam. Sting and Taker have that drawing power.
WWE,3dprkt,jimvanallan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:45:25 2015 UTC,If he screws Lesnar then could WWE be setting Taker up for a heel or tweener role in his feud with Sting?
WWE,3dprkt,jimvanallan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:34:54 2015 UTC,I started to think about this as well. Do you think there's any possibility of the Undertaker being aligned with Rollins? Or would that just damage his character?
WWE,3dprkt,derekbravo1984,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:46:15 2015 UTC,Talk about a swerve but I don't think so--Taker is untouchable now at this point- I doubt anyone would ever even boo him
WWE,3dokxd,PWF_Empire,2,Fri Jul 17 23:40:42 2015 UTC,"I like the article, and I agree with the point about the curb stomp.  However I think the Authority falling apart actually makes it more of a situation in which Rollins has to prove himself.  Taking the training wheels off, so to speak.   I don't think WWE wants Brock to be champ just yet.  I'm calling a dirty win for Rollins, then Brock wins the belt at summer slam."
WWE,3dokxd,cbartdizzle,2,Sat Jul 18 07:21:08 2015 UTC,"Rollins having the belt in my opinion is far better than Brock holding it. We actually see the belt now, and we know that the holder CAN be beaten, and isn't made out to be some huge beefcake who never loses."
WWE,3dokxd,theboywhoblazed,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:32:17 2015 UTC,I'm curious to know what value there is in simply seeing the title more.
WWE,3dokxd,theboywhoblazed,2,Sat Jul 18 18:02:13 2015 UTC,"Personally, i think it helps serve as a reminder, and it makes the title so much more achievable. If people can pin the holder, than its much more likely you could see a title swap at a PPV compared to seeing someone 5 times a year."
WWE,3dokxd,cbartdizzle,2,Sat Jul 18 21:37:20 2015 UTC,"Represents the top of the industry, and the other guys vying to beat you can see the goal (i.e. the title)  When Lesnar was champ and rarely on TV, it's like the guys fighting for No. 1 contender spot were fighting for nothing."
WWE,3dokxd,chibi-ken805,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:04:45 2015 UTC,"I personally liked some of the ways that WWE worked around not having the championship on TV every week and the stories they told to fill the void. Being able to witness a struggle to the #1 contender spot is more enjoyable to me because I honestly think title shots come entirely too easy these days.  I watch a wider variety of wrestling now than I ever have before (WWE main roster, NXT, Lucha Underground, ROH, New Japan) and this standard only exists in WWE. I'd rather see the championship being booked strongly always (even if it means seeing it less) rather than having it be weakened because it just needs to be there."

WWE,3do35k,Alernet,2,Sat Jul 18 02:06:25 2015 UTC,"Are you insinuating that the roster is not full of athletes. These people jump, run, dive, lift, and more for at least 10 minutes with barely anytime to recover. There are no ""rounds""  to rest; there is no ""time between plays"",  and there are no quarters. I think everyone on the roster can 100% beat the physical challenges easily"

WWE,3dnt5j,derekbravo1984,2,Fri Jul 17 19:55:37 2015 UTC,"Here is what I think will happen (or maybe what I want to happen) : Owens wins the title. Cena has his rematch clause. Cesaro gets added to the match somehow. Even Rusev can say he WON his title match against Cena, which means he deserves a fair title shot. As a result, we get a fatal-4-way or a triple threat at Summerslam."

WWE,3dnt5j,chibi-ken805,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:57:22 2015 UTC,"I do not think he will win.  It will be an AMAZING match. Both men have phenomenal talent. But the U.S. title is not important without Cena holding it. That being said, getting rid of it will make the title that much more discarded."
WWE,3dnt5j,theboywhoblazed,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:15:57 2015 UTC,I think they should have the match end in a draw. Perhaps a DQ with KO and Cena destroying the ringside area and the set in the process. That'll set up a huge match for Summerslam where KO can beat Cena cleanly in the ring in some sort of gimmick match like a cage or Falls count anywhere match.
WWE,3dnt5j,kashifsakhan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:20:41 2015 UTC,They absolutely do not need to fight at yet another consecutive pay per view
WWE,3dnt5j,DemiGod9,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:04:44 2015 UTC,I think they can pull it off till Summerslam and still have a relevant feud provided they handle it properly.
WWE,3dnt5j,kashifsakhan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:34:30 2015 UTC,"Yes. That way Cena can chase the title until Summerslam. It will put Owens over, and after he loses it to Cena it will free him up for a programme with whoever is the WWE Champion, likely for Royal Rumble."

I think Rusev's a really good wrestler, he can become a monster heel if handled properly (the way he was pushed before WM31). It's a great story line to have. It reminds me of the days of Nikolai Volkoff; and that can't be a bad thing!"

WWE,3dh9wy,estyll11,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:01:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of this (as usual). I think the biggest thing NXT NEEDS to do with Blake & Murphy is to turn them Face. They are REALLY BAD heels, and I think letting them fight for the good side would help them immensely. I think the way to go may actually be to drop them from Alexa Bliss, eventhough they like JUST put them together. Bliss can pull off the ""bad girl"" thing really well, but blake and murphy just seem out of place in it. Maybe have bliss try to interfere in matches where they ""dont need"" her, and have them start to get mad about it or something. Or have Enzo & Cass keep talking crap about them ""needing a girls help"" to win or something.   Also, yes Baron Corbin as a Heel is the way to go! I don't understand how they haven't given him this roll already."
WWE,3dh9wy,Seniormano,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:00:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Im glad someone else feels this way. If they dont change it soon, it could hurt their on screen characters in the long term. I also believe Alexa can carry herself as a heel without being a valet"

WWE,3dg5lu,The_Last_Tweener,2,Thu Jul 16 00:32:37 2015 UTC,How bout Lesnar vs. Owens! Not sure if D-Bry will ever wrestle again. Great blog BTW.
WWE,3dg5lu,derekbravo1984,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:05:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks ! It will sure be great seeing two beasts clashing at Wrestlemania. However, it's much more believable to see somebody outwrestle Lesnar or defeat him in a 'tricky' way (Bryan) than seeing somebody outfight or outpower him (Owens). Lesnar is physically light years ahead of anybody on the roster. Also I think that Brock vs Bryan is a better story than Brock vs Owens AND that Owens vs Zayn is the best feud Owens can have. I loved their NXT feud, nothing less that top 3 of the year. Make such a feud for the US Title, and the title will be up there for good. I know Bryan's chances of wrestling again are really low, especially against somebody like Brock, and that's why I put an alternative card (kind of). Thanks again !"

WWE,3dbvp1,htran4179,7,Wed Jul 15 01:45:47 2015 UTC,Part of his problem is his thick Geordie accent. The few times I've heard him talk on mic he has come across as fairly confident and I think he was well enough understood but I'm sure it's still a concern.
WWE,3dbvp1,Magicthize,3,Wed Jul 15 12:26:03 2015 UTC,"I said this before, British superstars have a hard time on the mic because of their accent, Americans for some reason have a hard time understanding them or their jargon. Neville is talented wrestling wise, but I think his biggest factor is a) his height and b) lack of charisma.   Balor at least has the cool gimmick going for him and doesn't really need to speak much. I think Balor will go further in WWE than Neville will."
WWE,3dbvp1,Xstasy14,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:29:56 2015 UTC,"I think this can definitely be true, because some accents are really unfamiliar to the American ear.  Barrett and Sheamus and Paige are all fine, but I have a hard time understanding Neville myself.  My brother thought Kevin Owens had some kind of speech impediment until I said he's from Quebec, and my brother said ""oooOOOOoooh, I get it now"".  I think that with time, the audience could learn to figure Neville's speech out, but he needs more mike time first."

WWE,3d90qu,Train2Win,29,Tue Jul 14 13:13:59 2015 UTC,"The way he messed up and then told the audience to shut up afterwards made him even more of a heel, so it's a win."
WWE,3d90qu,macndee,10,Tue Jul 14 14:07:24 2015 UTC,"He played it off perfectly, going 'wjshhdjablabla' to loosen his tonuge before saying it right then acting all heel on the crowd."

WWE,3d90qu,SenpaiSamaChan,2,Wed Jul 15 06:48:13 2015 UTC,Yea I thought that was great. And the end of raw when he verbally went off on Lesnar. He's way better on the mic than I thought especially when he's angry
WWE,3d90qu,kobimus,-1,Tue Jul 14 19:58:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah this, I think he's much more believable when he gets angry or emotional. When he talks normally he sounds pretty scripted, like he's trying to be Edge or someone else. Even his music is almost identical at the start to Edge's. I'm starting to genuinely dislike him, and not the good kind of dislike."
WWE,3d90qu,bellboy3,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:05:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and it's why I like when they don't do the chickenshit heel with him. I think he needs to be Rick Rude: totally confident all the time and legitimately kicking ass all the time... use J&J and Kane less, he's better when he's legit doing damage on his own. Unfortunately, they can't seem to decide which way to go."

WWE,3d90qu,Svidthekid,5,Tue Jul 14 14:00:25 2015 UTC,Well there was that time where we were tucking our legs between our legs  But yeah for how much mic time he gets and how much he's expected to deliver it's extremely rare he flubs anything

WWE,3dcny1,estyll11,2,Wed Jul 15 05:58:50 2015 UTC,Glad someone pointed out how little sense it made for her to pull rank on the Bellas given that she was the one who pushed for Nikki to get the belt in the first place. Stephanie is a heel yet she introduced mostly face NXT women to the roster. What?? I was so confused. It's like they forgot all the Steph has done in the past two years.
WWE,3dcny1,Mutual_Death,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:08:14 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I loved that entire promo, except how Steph addressed Nikki. The other bit I could forgive. Either way, you still make a point, her acting face was odd, but I think most people were just caught up in the excitement."
WWE,3dcny1,redbill360,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:19:10 2015 UTC,"nah, i think shes only heel cos shes 'the boss' and doing whats best for business regardless of anything.  if bringing in faces is whats best for business right now, thats what she will do, despite previously pushing the Belles when that was also best for business in her book.  thats how I view her and the authority at least."
WWE,3dcny1,AredLion,0,Wed Jul 15 10:10:49 2015 UTC,"I think this idea that the top heels can only be talked down to by the top face has sort of faded because the entire culture of wrestling has evolved. There used to be a lot more unity among fans as to who we wanted to win out in a particular feud. Faces back then had a more universal support from the fans. Now both faces and heels get a fair amount of fan love. We have a bigger percentage of the fan base who want to actively cheer for the villain. Because of this split, the writing team feels that they have to throw in some heel on heel shade because the people who prefer to cheer for the top heel want their guy to have a little more story behind him/her. They want their favorites to face some adversity and rise to the challenge, so the old model of top heels never getting picked on because they had to seem untouchable is gone. We want everyone to seem human because everyone (at the top) has a healthy fan base that needs to be attended to."
WWE,3dcl05,Carbonsilkthread,3,Wed Jul 15 05:26:06 2015 UTC,"The only person I would somewhat compare him too in this era is Seth Rollins, similar heel types, the ones who would get the audience to hate them just by dissing the WWE Universe themselves.   His top feuds would with John Cena for the Championship which brought some great matches, and against Matt Hardy over Lita which brought some awesome matches!  But the ultimate rivalry to me, was against the Undertaker which occurred during 07-09. It was so back and forth and was truly unpredictable. They never had a full match despite facing each other countless times, and Edge had this whole thing where he was engaged to GM Vickie Guerrero so he had his own Faction called La Familia.   Imo, the best couple of years for Smackdown ever, check it out man."
WWE,3dcl05,Drshiznitt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:14:51 2015 UTC,Yeah definitely Edge vs. Undertaker. Their Wrestlemania match was one of very few that I thought the streak was actually going to end.

WWE,3dcl05,estyll11,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:51:06 2015 UTC,"His best years ranged from 06-11. I thought he did a solid job transitioning into the PG era. As another comment here stated, he is comparable to Rollins. They both know how to look slimy and evil. Plus the Familia is comparable to the Authority."
WWE,3dcl05,NightofWingz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:28:02 2015 UTC,"Everyone is saying it but Rollins is the Edge of the current generation. He's got the cowardly heel thing going, has the Authority backing him up (La Familia) and almost never wins on his own, even though he can wrestle amazingly on his own. Also the cashing in of the MiTB, he's even referred to as an opportunist, while Edge held the title of The Ultimate Opportunist.   Best Feuds definitely include the one with Undertaker, some of his work with Batista, a really long rivalry with Jeff Hardy, and of course the personal one with Matt Hardy."

It takes time to get used to the length, and at the same time suspending disbelief.   Also, Whenever I watch any kind of wrestling with someone that doesn't watch it, they're usually not impressed."
WWE,3d7tkp,DetectiveCactus,0,Wed Jul 15 00:44:29 2015 UTC,I think you have to break up with her. I mean sure the bellas do look stupid but not liking that  segment is unforgivable
WWE,3d7tkp,avisionn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:54:12 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed it and how it turned out. My only question, The Boss gets introduced as the champion, yet walks out with no belt?"

WWE,3d7tkp,gearan,-1,Tue Jul 14 18:52:40 2015 UTC,"I feel like having Stephanie there reduced the impact of the event. It might just be me but Stephanie seems to suck the energy out of everything she is part of. It would have been more impactful if Charlotte, Becky Lynch and Sasha Banks came out without the introduction, either saving Paige from a beat down or just interrupting Nikki."
WWE,3d7tkp,mosjoh08,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:36:52 2015 UTC,"She definitely sucked the life out of Nikki Bella, which I didn't like. There was no reason for her to out heel the top heel in the divas division. If she hadn't done that, and just introduced them, would you have been happier with her promo?"

No title defense at Summerslam because we have Seth/Owens vs. Lesnar/Cena  Lesnar vs. Cena vs. Rollins in a triple threat at Night of Champions leads to Rollins scheming his way to a win  Rollins vs. Lesnar at Hell in a Cell leads to a Lesnar win and a Sheamus cash in and beat down.

Obviously more people will watch Summerslam, but I think NXT when put up directly next to WWE will be great. And this could start an NXT v Main roster rival again (something that kind of makes sense, since a lot of people have been clamoring for a ""brand split"" of some sort). Also that being said, they could make for some of the better matches of the weekend; depending on where Sasha Banks & Charlotte are at the time NXT women could put on a clinic compared to WWE Divas; Enzo Amore is my favorite person on the mic in the business (Which is why I still don't remember the NXT tag champions names as anything but ""The cornflake Wesly Blake oh, and that Australian kid); Fin Balor v Kevin Owens (I wonder if that's going to be the US Champion Kevin Owens); oh and The Vaudevillans are back!!

WWE,3ctnoa,latinoeat,2,Fri Jul 10 18:05:56 2015 UTC,I would start before he showed up in WWE. Particularly with his ROH career (He went by his real name back then: Bryan Danielson).   The Bryan Danielson: World Champion Complication is a great place to start.
WWE,3ctnoa,Tweakedenigma,2,Fri Jul 10 18:15:58 2015 UTC,"This right here, in particular, as many ROH shows from late 2005 through 2006 as you can (his first run with the ROH title and some absolutely incredible matches).    While you're there, 2005 as a whole was a great year for ROH, with some absolutely incredible matches.  CM Punk's title run that year was also something to see.     Just to be absolutely transparent, I believe that ROH 2004-2006 is probably the best era of professional wrestling of the modern era, for any promotion.  The quality of matches, and the sheer talent that competed at that time was insane."
WWE,3ctnoa,theAmazingDead,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:47:45 2015 UTC,"I'm as interested in the story as I am in the wrestling. Does ROH have that, too? I just watched a ROH match and Daniel Bryan is impressive in it, doing cartwheel and everything. Way more interesting than anything I've seen from Cena, at least."
WWE,3ctnoa,theAmazingDead,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:55:30 2015 UTC,"There's some stories in ROH, there's definitely feuds but not as much backstage segments as WWE.  The wrestling itself usually is the major focus in the indies.  This isn't to say it's all action no story, just more focus on the one over the other.  Not every match has a story, or is part of a story.  I still loved DB in the WWE, but he had a far more technical moveset in the indies."
WWE,3ctnoa,Tweakedenigma,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:02:36 2015 UTC,"Smaller companies tend to have less convoluted plots than WWE. Mostly due to lack of time or large gaps between shows. Many times it focuses around being the best.   As most have 1 hour weekly show or do iPPV/Supercards around once a month.   Not specific to your question about Dbry, but you I do a weekly post over on /r/ROH called Indie Friday with (Legit) links to a plethora of free shows/matches. Might be worth checking out if you want to see more wrestling and get a feel for Smaller/indie companies."

Like you said with HBK and say Randy Orton he sets the RKO up with hitting the ring, Stone cold with the kick to the midsection for the stunner, Cena with the you can't see me for the 5 knuckle shuffle.  They all have a certain procedure to let you know it is coming I guess that is just part of it.

WWE,3cpl1d,Erburn,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:48:08 2015 UTC,"Yep. there was never a time i got more excited while watching wrestling than when the undertaker dropped someone with what's now called ""old school"" (cuz before we just always said HOLY CRAP HE's WALKING ON THE ROPES!!!), or the big boot, or the choke-slam and then gave the thumb across the throat so I knew that the Tombstone was coming.

WWE,3cpl1d,Seniormano,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:55:53 2015 UTC,"Obviously generalizing because it varies from city to city - but basically the crowd likes Reign's major moves and his look - he was even building organically - but then the crowd perceived that he was being pushed too hard and fast - and there was a backlash.  So I think the answer to your question is there is a mix, some boos for the over-push, but cheers for his signature moves - I don't think the setup is an issue - Over time I suspect he will be very popular and the boos will go away.  We'll see, I could be wrong."

But I don't know...if it was negative crowd reaction they'd have stopped it by now, right?  As for the cocking fist I wish they'd just dump the superman punch in general.  It screams ""this guy can't wrestle"" when one of your finishers is a punch.  Big Show is the only legitimate punch finisher, and even that has grown stale."

WWE,3cpuf4,InvisibleDae,4,Thu Jul 9 21:57:28 2015 UTC,"Match will end in a DQ, Rollins retains title until Summerslam. He'll lose it to Lesnar then."
WWE,3cpuf4,WV_Raider304,3,Thu Jul 9 21:57:52 2015 UTC,I think he will suplex Seth but he will reverse and flip out of it to the surprise of Brock thus setting up a pedigree from Seth or a hell of a clothesline from Brock.  And there will absolutely be interference throughout the match.
WWE,3cpuf4,poohbear85,2,Thu Jul 9 20:35:49 2015 UTC,"Seth does have the quickness and agility to rival Brock's power. Royal Rumble Triple Threat for example: Seth got most of the good moves on Brock event taking out Cena on one of them. I do believe Seth is capable of defending the championship cleanly, but I think WWE want him to keep it through dirty play."
WWE,3cpuf4,poohbear85,2,Thu Jul 9 21:15:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed. They're featuring him prominently and rightfully so, he is a good talent."
WWE,3cpuf4,DetectiveCactus,3,Thu Jul 9 21:19:03 2015 UTC,At this point it's incredibly likely that Seth lose by DQ... either by intentionally DQing himself or Kane/J&J attacking Brock. It will set up for a big rematch at SummerSlam... likely No DQ or something of that sort.

Rollins is quite good on the mic and when it comes to mocking people (he needs to work on his evil laugh though), But I'd think it benefit Seth more if he didn't need The Authority in any of his matches, he has the talent.

I can't wait to see how he develops.  T1 Kevin Owens and Bray Wyatt- Kevin Owens is the best pure heel on the roster in a long time.  Doesn't overplay the cowardly heel, doesn't overly rely on under-handed tactics or outside interference.  Just smash mouth, in your face offense coupled with a brash, arrogant attitude.  Bray Wyatt is this generation's Undertaker.  He brings theatrics to an overly ""realistic"" WWE, is absolute Gold on the mic, and damn good in the ring."

Although his mic skills could use some work, his ring ability and wrestling history are awesome to me.  Next is Seth Rollins. From a fan standpoint I get riled up when he wins, but from a wrestler standpoint, (I do local pro wrestling) he's phenomenal. His mic skills are some of the best in the company, and his ability to work are unmatched in most of the industry.  Now people may downvote or whatever, but this is an opinion. OP asked for my favourites, so my favourite person to watch is the Lunatic Fringe, Dean Ambrose.  He may seem sub-par compared to Rollins or Cena, but he's an amazing worker and has a serious heart for the business. Not to mention that he's  extremely friendly and has been doing this for a while. I think he's very underrated, despite his push for the championship that was cut off. Hear me out, he was put in a group with two other people. It was obvious that Reigns was the ""big dog"" of the group, and when they split it seemed that Reigms and Rollins got the best parts of the split. I enjoy his character and his in-ring presence a lot. When his music comes on, I could totally see him becoming the unpredictable Stone Cold of this era. But that's just me."

WWE,3cm12t,ButterDream,6,Wed Jul 8 23:44:35 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed it.  The crowd was enthusiastic without being attention whores.  The direction / filming was less frantic and felt more natural, like a real sporting event.  Loved the commentary too; FAR better than the usual babbling about everything except the match.  Wish they'd tape more stuff this way."
WWE,3cm12t,main_enigma,4,Thu Jul 9 03:02:20 2015 UTC,It really felt like watching a non-WWE show with WWE Superstars.
WWE,3cm12t,AKMR8,9,Thu Jul 9 04:26:23 2015 UTC,"Its amazing how much better the product looks and sounds, commentary wise, without Kevin Dunn in Vince's ear."
WWE,3cm12t,cafemofo,5,Wed Jul 8 23:30:34 2015 UTC,Totally that is why I like NXT so much!
WWE,3cm12t,Doctorpat,3,Thu Jul 9 03:11:27 2015 UTC,"yep I enjoy NXT a lot.  I think the Tokyo show felt even less produced though.  NXT is incredibly gimmicky.  The matches in NXT are usually good though, save for a couple.  The Tokyo just felt like they had two guys in a ring and put cameras on them.  No BS.  Just filming a sporting event kinda thing."
WWE,3cm12t,sculptedandpure,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:14:32 2015 UTC,I think that's why people say to go to a live event. The wrestlers still have their gimmicks but it focuses less on that (notice how no one other than the ring announcer spoke) and more on their wrestling abilities.  They do focus on gimmicks in NXT since it is a training ground of sorts to prepare them for the main roster.
WWE,3cm12t,Cferra,3,Thu Jul 9 14:23:21 2015 UTC,"Anything is better than the normal WWE tapings set up. I can't tell if it's any old Raw or a major PPV. Same camera angles, same entrances (especially Reigns coming in from that same spot), same stage."
WWE,3cm12t,antidark777,3,Thu Jul 9 09:36:28 2015 UTC,This.  This is the way they tape nxt too. The best in the east felt like an nxt show - good thing.  The only thing that I would add are the live announcers ringside and it would be awesome.
WWE,3cm12t,antidark777,3,Thu Jul 9 00:52:18 2015 UTC,"It was to appeal to the Japanese crowd, that's the kind of show they're used to watching"

I feel like with all the Illuminati symbolism on their titantron intro, they should really use mic time to act like they're in the know on crazy conspiracy theories. Something like the Authority is nothing but a bunch of blood drinking reptilian shapeshifters. It would really grab the paranoid demographic.   Bonus points if you have them team up (or feud) with R-truth who could act like he believes everything they say, coming out with a tinfoil hat or something."

WWE,3cn70d,Nitro_Thunder,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:28:32 2015 UTC,"They were pretty much the same, minus the facepaint and body... Gear? Whatever that is. They came out to the ring, destroyed, and left. It wasn't much good, but they were over with the crowd.  If you want to see the better days of ascension, youtube some FCW videos of ascension as Kenneth Cameron (now known as Bram in TNA) and Connor O'Brian. They had a bone-chilling entrance and quite great matches. Shame they never made it as such to the main roster."

Your opinion is your own, and that's fine, but please don't expect everyone to agree with you. The fact that you can't remember their music says more about your mind than it does their performances. I can't wait for them to be champions.  The tag team division is filled with neutered half-men and shitty gimmicks like The New Day and PTP.   At least The Ascension feel like a real tag team, like Powers Of Pain, Demolition, The Headbangers, or the Road Warriors, etc."

WWE,3ck3lz,Rinaldootje,2,Wed Jul 8 18:18:53 2015 UTC,"They were a great pair back in the early 00's and are a great pair today. They are both white-hot at the moment which lends to the idea that they're the best combo of all time. The others you've mentioned were white-hot during their periods, as well. So, it's practically impossible to narrow it down to a single best. But all mentioned were awesome when paired up together."

WWE,3cn2oa,Superman4life,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:18:20 2015 UTC,"Nope, NXT is actually recorded weeks in advance. They do a good job at booking the shows as if they're happening in real time though. You're right, Raw does feel extremely controlled. A great example of this was Kevin Owens on commentary 2 weeks ago on NXT and last week on Raw. On the NXT show, he was superb and out shinned all of the commentators. On Raw, he sounded more dull and repetitive"

How to make the tag champs (still don't know what to call them besides Cornflake Wesly Blake & that Australian kid lol) faces. They're awful as heels, so maybe a program with the Vaudevillans is the way to make that happen. Also they figured out a way to get Sasha & Charlotte on the same page again before they go help Paige deal with the Bellas on the main roster.  Edit: unrelated, but I mentioned OP in another post about possibly getting /r/WWE a new mod, link to that thread below:  https://www.reddit.com/r/WWE/comments/3cokb7/official_new_moderator_discussion/"

I was concerned when it was just blake & murphy vs enzo & cass, but incorporating the vaudevillians was very clever. Even if both Sasha and Charlotte don't both go up, they've given them the perfect angle to get one of them on the main roster.  Thanks for the mention, I'll check it out now.

WWE,3cn1rp,Seniormano,2,Thu Jul 9 13:15:26 2015 UTC,"I think this is a way to start turning the champs Face. They're AWFUL heels IMO (same with Alexa Bliss, she should NOT be a heel either), and maybe pairing them with another set of heels is a way to get them on the ""good"" side. I know they haven't been heels very long, but it doesn't seem like the crowd likes them at all. They're the bad kind of heel right now, the way Roman reigns was a ""heel"" (i know he never was but let me explain) earlier this year. The people didn't like how he just got launched into the main event picture, just like people HATED when blake and murphy became champs. No one knows why they're on top, or why they're ""bad guys"".  Personally I think Enzo & Cass need to make their way to the main roster soon, and let Enzo end up going more into a Manager roll instead of an actual superstar, thus letting Cass get a HUGE push as a solo competitor."
WWE,3cn1rp,Seniormano,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:43:13 2015 UTC,"That makes good sense in that light, I can get behind that.

It's kind of hard to tell right now, because Patrick, Tanner, and Josh all show promise in some regard. As for the women, I don't know who this Chelsea Green (missed the last episode, saw Tough Talk and the website), but she's been trained by Lance Storm. I think we'll see something good there. Nothing really stands out to me regarding the other women. Daria really stood out at first, but (possible spoiler) she got axed. I'm excited to find out who will actually win, though."
WWE,3clwqp,NightofWingz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:19:54 2015 UTC,"I agree. I feel ZZ will get cut despite being a favourite of the fans. It seems unfair, because he has potential as an entertainer but he's forced in a physical contest. But he did sign up.  And honestly, I would like to see Tanner win as opposed to Patrick or Josh just because I feel Tanner has a get-it-done attitude that could be very good in the company."

WWE,3clgps,jrmartin20,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:54:21 2015 UTC,Im curious as to what the issues with Stone Cold were...   I almost didn't post this because  I prefer primary sources that are clear.  This story comes from Ric Flair via Dave Scherer  and doesn't really provide all the details yet - so I share your curiosity and don't have an answer.  In the latest Steve Austin interview I can find Steve Austin didn't mention Piper - he sounded focused on WM32 and the cover of 2K16.  It will be interesting get more info going forward.
WWE,3clgps,jrmartin20,2,Wed Jul 8 21:03:01 2015 UTC,It definitely will be interesting to hear. Hasn't Piper always had problems with other wrestlers before? Seems like it could be good for the company but not for any fans of Legends
WWE,3clgps,EvilSnowmanRapist,2,Wed Jul 8 21:07:10 2015 UTC,I read the other day that Piper complained that Austin was the one whom had Piper's podcast removed from the air. Austin replied on his podcast that that wasn't the case and he's always been on good terms with Piper.

And to top it off the snap judgement you do make is based on arguments instead of how they are as potential superstars.  Lastly the fact, and I say this with all due respect, that the judges know nothing about what these people are really doing is ridiculous.  I mean Paige nominated Hank the first week based off a comment he made, on something that was probably taken out of context.  It's an awful format and if the show survives I hope they seriously reconsider it.  They should do a format that maybe air exclusive content of the people actually training on the WWE Network.

WWE,3cimpp,AKMR8,3,Wed Jul 8 05:23:09 2015 UTC,"To me a great match is about the story being told in the ring regardless of the competitors involved. The heels should try to cheat and push the ref to the limits without getting the DQ while also pulling out every move in his/her arsenal to put the face away. The face should obey the ref, not use foreign objects to cheat and should have a major comeback leading toward the end of the match. the comeback can be teased one or two times with the heel cutting it off with a high velocity move to lay the face out on the mat again. I'm sort of old school so I grew up in an era where finishers meant something so I could understand the face kicking out of the heel's finisher once but the heel should never be able to kick out of a face's finisher and the face should only use his finisher once. There also has to be no wasted motion in the match, don't throw your opponent outside the ring as a heel only to rest in the ring, go out there and ragdoll the face  and inflict more damage. and the biggest thing to me is chemistry and timing, watching raw week to week you can tell what two guys/girls have chemistry in the ring and who doesn't."
WWE,3cimpp,McAulay_a,2,Wed Jul 8 14:12:33 2015 UTC,"A match with two wrestlers you love, more than one finisher, but not too many, (preferably no more than four) incredibly unpredictable, one on one, a nice, hardcore stipulation, some cool stunts, (preferably through the Spanish Announce Table) painful looking submission holds, close calls on pins, and no one getting involved. No cheating either. (Although it is hard to cheat in a match with a hardcore stipulation) Also, built up well with a heated rivalry for a world title. These are all of the elements for the perfect match."

WWE,3chvxn,Meat48,2,Wed Jul 8 01:37:19 2015 UTC,You're right but the fact that he would be named in multiple matches out of the top 5 speaks volumes about his ability as a performer even though he may not be the most skilled wrestler.
WWE,3chvxn,Meat48,-2,Wed Jul 8 01:53:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but look at the great Cena matches of all time... Who are they with? HBK. Punk. Bryan. Owens.

WWE,3cfvch,Haynono,6,Tue Jul 7 16:20:54 2015 UTC,"Cena always puts up good matches.  Everyone hates him, but he makes other wrestlers look damn good.  He put KO on the WWE map, he made the US belt relevant again, Lesnar's whole identity now is Suplex City which was a Cena match from like 6 PPVs ago.  I got no strategic answer, I just know his matches have been the most consistent thing in recent memory."
WWE,3cfvch,ADIDASects,3,Tue Jul 7 21:24:41 2015 UTC,It's fun to hate on Cena but he is consistent and charismatic. He is likeable and people love to hate the heel. People don't want to like the babyface.
WWE,3cfvch,lego_mannequin,2,Tue Jul 7 21:33:50 2015 UTC,"It's amazing the matches you can have if you let people look strong, simply by being able to kick out or counter Cenas moves. Sure Cena still won but look at what it's done for Cesaro too. If Cesaro isnt involved in US title matches after battleground, hopefully they give him an IC title fued, it desperately needs some performance in it. Between Show/Ryback.. Cesaro is top notch for this."

WWE,3cfvch,hypelazer,2,Tue Jul 7 20:29:03 2015 UTC,"In watching the Vignettes featuring Finn Balor you see he being coached on his entrance. I figure that someone either likes how Owens speaks on they are working on it.   Funny though because except for his name he is the same. Same time, same look, same feud with  Sami Zayn...hell I bet he is going to fued with Joe on the main show like he had in the past.  I'm pretty bullish on K.O though.

WWE,3chea8,Sasuke082594,5,Tue Jul 7 22:44:24 2015 UTC,"Destroying? Seth Rollin's character is one of a cowardly heel champion (it is what it is, I love Rollins and his antics but I hope he turns face soon,) after seeing someone tear the door off a car (especially when that person as terrifying as Brock Lesnar) and then charging to the ring and jumping the rope, it only seems realistic for Rollins to NOPE the fuck out of there regardless of him having a weapon, I'd say creative did a decent enough job with that right there."
WWE,3chea8,shaz10010,3,Tue Jul 7 23:07:15 2015 UTC,"His character is a sniveling heel, which mean he is supposed to ""run and cower"". Rollins himself said he was a ""thinking man's champ."" Running from Lesnar seems like a smart move in my opinion."
WWE,3chea8,Mutual_Death,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:14:36 2015 UTC,"I think Seth does the cowering heel role really well and it works for him. It gets him the heat he wants from the crowd and allows for them to feel some satisfaction from seeing him cower.  Triple H was the game, a huge bad ass, and even he sometimes played the role of the cowering heel when the situation merited. (i.e. His reaction to having to face Cactus Jack either time)"
WWE,3chea8,hypelazer,-1,Wed Jul 8 08:50:13 2015 UTC,I don't understand why they made him that kind of heel. If he's supposed to be the real future then they should have him bold and fearless. The way theyre playing this makes it seem like they are tarnishing Brock as an unstoppable beast and tarnishing Seth as the true future.

In fact, i dont think he does either of these when he makes appearances because wwe tells him not to. Hence the fact that hes not doing it on the cover. Rollins or Lesnar should definitely be on the cover. Not stone cold.  Before you guys go crazy and tell me im just a little kid that doesnt know what a good wrestler is, kniw that im a huge stone cold fan.

WWE,3cgxfz,dizreegharrd,2,Wed Jul 8 04:28:44 2015 UTC,I don't think the wwe will allow current divas to do any thing too serious. This is why I think you never see a diva use a chair or any thing too extreme.  So a ladder match is way yay out of the question

WWE,3cgy2f,Haynono,5,Tue Jul 7 20:47:35 2015 UTC,"1) Daniel Bryan beat Triple H, Batista and Randy Orton in one night to win the WWE title.....is that not enough giant killing? Can't control his neck getting nearly broken  2) Joe already has his name and his character and was mostly brought in to enhance NXT and maybe bring some TNA diehards to WWE. Don't expect him to be headlining WM anytime soon (or ever)  3) Their recent call-ups have actually been fairing alright, like Neville and KO, but there's always reason to worry."

WWE,3cgy2f,dizreegharrd,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:29:16 2015 UTC,It is sad but I don't think it will ever happen again the only reason why it happened for a little while the first time is because wcw had a super strong cruiserweight division and it was stealing ratings from wwe. With that out of the way wwe doesn't need to cater to any one really.

Kevin Owens has lost 5 matches in a row, and is currently 4-1-1 against John Cena, things aren't looking very bright to say the least.  Also Bo Dallas is jobbing and Neville is lower midcard.

WWE,3cfovc,lego_mannequin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:10:49 2015 UTC,"Just let him use the package piledriver! He's been doing it for a long time. Just because the old ""top guys"" in WWE won't learn how to take it safely doesn't make it a dangerous move."
WWE,3cfovc,Ectoplasmic,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:31:16 2015 UTC,In another era I may tend to agree but in this era most of new blood of wrestlers are small in comparison to guys like Kane and Big Show. With that being said KO will be delivering that new variation of the power bomb to guys that will be smaller than him so he will be able to sell the impact on the opponent more and get more air on the pop up which should make for a pretty devastating fall. Opponents will also be able to sell the move better too. Against a guy like Brock he would probably have to do like 4 to 5 times though.
WWE,3cfovc,richbitw,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:44:19 2015 UTC,"The problem with the pop up is that it requires the other wrestler to run into it.  That means he was on his feet and not that defeated anyway.  It's not one of those moves where you can pick the oponent up off the mat and finish them off with the signature.  KO can remedy this by either having a non-powerbomb finisher/signature or he can pick them up and powerbomb anyway without the ""pop up"" feature."
WWE,3cfovc,spektricide,0,Wed Jul 8 05:06:34 2015 UTC,"I honestly can't stand the Pop up. I think all his other moves are brilliant though, especially the 180 spin to moonsault from the top rope. Should have that as his finisher and call it Last Resort. The Pop up just looks weak unless he's doing into ladders or a table."
WWE,3cfhpj,LittIefinger,2,Tue Jul 7 14:40:49 2015 UTC,"The only thing that really bothers me right now is the politics in WWE, I understand there are more superstar caliber talent than titles so some people will get left out, but them keeping the divas title on nikki seemingly for no other reason than getting AJ out of the record books is so f***ing ridiculous to me I wouldn't even care if nikki somehow lost it to brie and it stayed with the bellas but don't let your animosity towards punk dictate what you do with AJ"
WWE,3cfhpj,xXFLAVORSXx,3,Tue Jul 7 14:55:39 2015 UTC,Should them simply get off the Unified WWE World Heavyweight Championship and split it back to the 2 titles?
WWE,3cfhpj,xXFLAVORSXx,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:07:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not completely sold on splitting the title back to two, it would obviously give more upper card talent chances at a championship but I can't help but feel that it would still only be thrown around 2 or 3 superstars at most (most likely the Vince McMahon guys) which would still limit the number of guys that have a chance since Vince is still in charge. If and when they do a title split again I'd want it to be after trips takes over because with his work with NXT you can see that he gives everyone gets a chance and it's not always the huge muscled guys who are getting the spotlight."
WWE,3cfhpj,richbitw,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:17:32 2015 UTC,"I actually thinks it's easier to name who's actually NOT being wasted. Brock Lesnar. Thats pretty much it. He's even been made into some unbeatable monster more so than he should be. Rollins as champ has been embarrassing for the most part, it wouldn't kill WWE to give the man a few clean wins in a row on his own without help or even if he did something like hold the rights on a roll up at least it would on his own. I agree about how all of the main feuds right seem to lack creativity. Wyatt vs Roman will only impress me IF Wyatt walks out of Battleground winner of the match. KO vs Cena is gold though."

WWE,3cegn1,Xstasy14,2,Tue Jul 7 13:23:38 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Cut all that backstage BS and just have it matches like Tokyo this past weekend. With the WWE Network, WWE can afford to do a house show anywhere in the world at any time. Maybe something they can do 2 to 4 times a year."
WWE,3cegn1,RJ9225,2,Tue Jul 7 13:38:05 2015 UTC,I couldn't agree more. I loved the vibe of The Beast in the East. Felt like an old school ppv that was all about the matches. A 2 hour ppv that was extremely satisfying. I thought the Tokyo audience was great because it almost felt like an early days of ECW crowd (minus the weapons). Clapping for great wrestling and showing a ton of respect for the performers.
WWE,3cegn1,Xstasy14,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:03:00 2015 UTC,"I think it really comes down to limited tickets, those who REALLY wanted to go went.

WWE,3ce0x8,cyberklown28,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:52:48 2015 UTC,I got the feeling just from watching Cena's reactions to the crowd at the end of the match that I was looking at a man who was thinking of retiring. That post-match speech sure didn't change my mind on that.

My only beef with it is that it didn't seem as randomly generated as I expected it to be and the fact that the game pretty much wouldn't let me win certain matches. I do agree though that 2k15 was terrible compared to 14. The lack of CAW options, custom music, custom finishers, and custom divas were a HUGE disappointment. And if they had their faces scanned like they say they did, then why the hell did the divas look so horrendous? It was like their faces were too big for their heads."

WWE,3carc6,RYKIN5,0,Tue Jul 7 07:07:12 2015 UTC,"Brock should be on the cover.   Here's the point, everyone.  One of Austin's podcasts went over part-timers, or Legends who come back to steal the spotlight. Now, he's doing that EXACT thing.  The Attitude Era (which I believe was 2k13 or 2k14? whatever (who cares)) was a lot of Austin, but now we're promoting it more.  Weird to me.  This sums up what the current problem with WWE is. Scared to make new stars because those stars might leave, like Austin, The Rock, Brock Lesnar (who is now back), etc.  It's turning in to boxing and UFC. Soon we're only going to watch when we know our favorites are gonna be there. Wrestling really was never this way before when it was awesome.  I'm a big Austin fan, but Steve said it himself in his podcast about taking the spotlight from current competitors."
WWE,3carc6,Kaynos72,0,Tue Jul 7 07:23:30 2015 UTC,"Really WWE ?  A 50yo wrestler on the cover ?  Nothing against Stone Cold, it still one of the best wrestler ever but mean come on now, this is 2016 not 2000."

WWE,3cedcc,CrossBones3129,2,Tue Jul 7 06:46:47 2015 UTC,Why was the episode pulled?
WWE,3cedcc,misturcheef,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:31:00 2015 UTC,"I think it had something to do with the fact that Austin beat both his ex-wife and an ex-girlfriend.  He was arrested twice for beating women. There was a comedian on Piper's podcast who did an Austin impersonation and perhaps alluded to these events.   I don't know why anyone supports this scumbag. Somebody should smack him around and show Steve what it's like to be humiliated, afraid, and in pain, just like he did to those women."
WWE,3cedcc,DrakusColt,0,Wed Jul 8 04:08:13 2015 UTC,"Actually, there is only truth to part of this. He did beat someone and it makes me uneasy because he is such an awesome guy, but it seems steroids was something he had a problem with. I find him to be calm now and maybe it was something beyond that that no one else saw. Whatever, it was in the past and it's not like he murdered anyone..."
WWE,3cedcc,misturcheef,0,Wed Jul 8 17:27:36 2015 UTC,"He did beat someone   Not someone. He beats his girlfriends and wives, regularly, for years at a time.  This is a documented fact.  He is an abusive piece of shit, a women beating loser.  You seem quick to forgive him because he uses steroids, but if he were smoking crack would you be so forgiving?  You're being an apologist for a woman beating loser.  The fact that you'd forgive him, simply because he entertained you is appalling, and makes you a shitty person.  He doesn't deserve his fame and fortune. He is a cowardly piece of shit who thinks he's tough because he can beat his wife black ad blue. It wasn't just one time, or two times. He beat these women regularly.  He made them fear for their lives.  A real man would smack Steve around like the pussy he is."

I don't support someone beating anyone and I don't see any reports of multiples times it happening. I've watched the guy wrestle when I was a kid, so yes I am somewhat biased with him as someone I've heard talk for quite sometime over a random guy on the internet. It's a shame he did beat one of his wives, but I honestly can't make heads or tails of a story I don't really know. Who knows what really happened? But, who cares?

I mean, the guy came out on a tank at Wrestlemania and was undefeated. And now he's in some love triangle?  Edit: I have to kind of retract that a bit since I just saw where Rusev set up Ziggler. Finally some action!"
WWE,3cd5we,RJ9225,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:18:04 2015 UTC,I agree completely. At least it looks like he's over his injury now so hopefully we'll finally see some matches and action in this feud. It's been boring as hell so far.

WWE,3cd5we,KingOfCaineville,2,Tue Jul 7 01:25:33 2015 UTC,Hahaha. Wyatt and Reigns?... It's just Wyatt doing the exact same thing he has always done and Reigns puffing his chest a lot.    Everyone bitches about people like Cena rehashing the same shit but then they all sit there and root for a guy who hasn't done a single thing differently since he took on the Wyatt persona.    Side note: Wyatt in the ring=snoozefest.
WWE,3cd5we,InvisibleDae,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:35:05 2015 UTC,"Their doing exactly what their characters were made for its not doing the same thing, its called staying in character. And you cant compare that to Cena he's been doing the same shit for 10+ years people have a right to complain"
WWE,3cd5we,KingOfCaineville,0,Tue Jul 7 01:44:23 2015 UTC,Well Wyatt's character sucks. Even in its birth. So that's the difference.

He hasn't even had a legitimate reason to feud with pretty much anyone he has come after.  He also makes error after error in the ring. There is really nothing entertaining about the guy.   Just another reason to DVR raw."

WWE,3cby5z,richbitw,3,Mon Jul 6 19:13:04 2015 UTC,"Cesaro could be a main eventer, so hes under promoted and pushed, but he is still pretty much on every Raw, so I don't know if I'd say hes under used.  Probably Bo Dallas, hes not a bad wrestler, and he could definitely find a niche in the mid card if not for his injury and wonky gimmick killing his initial push.  Edits: Curtis Axel while not terribly great, is actually pretty decent on the mic, I kinda wish they hadn't broke him and Ryback up as the two had amazing chemistry.   Christian needs to replace someone on the announce team. Christian is the best mic worker in the WWE outside of maaaaaaaaybe Triple H and Vince, he'd improve the announce team immensely, and its better the WWE use him for that, than pay him to sit at home."

WWE,3casuq,Nidac_7,5,Mon Jul 6 14:34:08 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, I don't think Rollins, Reigns etc. have the marketability to be on the cover of the game.  The only current high-caliber superstar with enough (I'm not sure how to say it) fame is Brock."
WWE,3casuq,GerardBenard,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:06:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies fellas. It would seem that the creative behind 2K and THQ have been pretty behind on times. I dunno. Just my take. I think the WWE games would sell a shitload more if they'd just simply talk to the community. Typical for most games, by the way. Look at Rockstar and CD Projekt Red who are killing other company's because they care about the community.  Copy and paste just doesn't cut it anymore."
WWE,3casuq,RYKIN5,3,Mon Jul 6 16:26:33 2015 UTC,"They should put Brock on the cover, and only allow you to play the game once or twice every 3 months... If a game is that good, you don't need to play it more than once or twice every 90 days. It makes playing the game an event worthy of video games."

WWE,3casuq,El_Gringo92,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:54:12 2015 UTC,Makes no fucking sense to have Reigns or Rollins in the cover because the game is based on Stone Cold and the Attitude Era.
WWE,3casuq,Flam0us,0,Mon Jul 6 21:44:48 2015 UTC,Rollins is the champ he's a logical figure for the cover. Austin has been on the cover of countless wrestling games and 2k13 was centered around the attitude era they need to just give it up already and stick wit current stars
WWE,3casuq,sedp23,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:04:30 2015 UTC,"The games don't always reflect what's going on in WWE.  The game is centered around Steve Austin, so he should be the cover."

WWE,3c85vt,paulfromatlanta,14,Sun Jul 5 20:19:50 2015 UTC,think they're gonna make battlegrounds a cesaro vs cena vs owens? I think that match would be the match of the year
WWE,3c85vt,sonofbmw,2,Sun Jul 5 21:15:57 2015 UTC,God I hope so man
WWE,3c85vt,kobimus,11,Mon Jul 6 00:31:53 2015 UTC,"Probably because the rest of the show was terrible matches, too many recaps, way too much talking, etc.  That match was the one thing making that RAW interesting."
WWE,3c85vt,cyberklown28,8,Sun Jul 5 20:50:58 2015 UTC,too many recaps    Particularly on that - they seemed to be making progress but have slipped.  They produce a tremendous amount of action each week - if they are determined to keep their flagship show at 3 hours it seem like they could at least use more of their resources for new Raw stuff rather than recaps.
WWE,3c85vt,cyberklown28,9,Sun Jul 5 20:54:59 2015 UTC,"I HATE recaps. They make no sense outside of a PPV. PPV's I can understand. 'Here's what happened, here's the big finale to the feud.'  But for Raw/Smackdown ot just destroys the quality of the shows by wasting time. So it pushes people away from watching. Then it also invites people -not- to watch because they can just see what happened anyways due to 1 hour of recaps every show."
WWE,3c85vt,sonofbmw,4,Sun Jul 5 22:15:13 2015 UTC,I dont mind the replays being how they were back in like 2004.  Like sponsored by x company heres why this matchup is happening. but only like 15 seconds max.
WWE,3c85vt,Desirsar,9,Sun Jul 5 22:39:39 2015 UTC,"Ratings today are a reflection of the quality of the last few months, not a reflection of today's show.  Have they really not learned that lesson by now?"
WWE,3c85vt,Kingsta8,2,Sun Jul 5 22:45:48 2015 UTC,"You mean booking a KOTR winner to be an utter failure. Diva Face/Heel switches without warning/cause/or reason. Crushing up and coming stars under the weight of John Cena's ego, Authority bickering like children and countless other storylines that go no where?  I thought those things were best for business..."
WWE,3c85vt,magenta_tardis,6,Mon Jul 6 14:56:52 2015 UTC,Considering Raw is a three hour show with about 30 minutes of actual wrestling I think reevaluating the format would be a wise decision.
WWE,3c85vt,acrolos,6,Mon Jul 6 12:31:27 2015 UTC,"The only way actual wrestling will help is if they build actual stories that make people want to see them.  The problem is that outside of the top feuds (which aren't that we'll developed themselves) ,  no one is giving any type of story for the undercard.  The actual writing in the attitude era was horrible in retrospect,  but at least every segment on the show had a story that progressed."
WWE,3c85vt,Darkblitz9,3,Mon Jul 6 12:46:57 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with that. I'm relatively new to the recent scene (was very big into some of the more classic wrestling), and it seems to me like they focus on nothing but the big names. I can't get hyped for a constant change of hats between the same ~10 wrestlers when there's dozens of them with tons of potential for interesting stories."
WWE,3c85vt,magenta_tardis,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:57:15 2015 UTC,I absolutely agree with this.
WWE,3c85vt,magenta_tardis,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:20:02 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I don't feel like we're getting that with the non-wrestling content either though. And that's a real problem."
WWE,3c85vt,acrolos,2,Mon Jul 6 13:14:52 2015 UTC,Agreed. I'm not sure how they manage to pull off three hours or TV a week without putting together some intriguing stories.. But somehow they manage to do it.
WWE,3c85vt,DemiGod9,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:58:20 2015 UTC,This is VERY important! I just recently rewatched the weeks up to and including the RR(99 I believe) and EVERYONE in DX had their own story lines and as you're fully aware that only one of them was really a top guy at that time. That's why people are still asking for guys like Scotty 2Hotty to be in the games. WWE made you care about everyone back then. 20 years from now no one is going to ask for Titus O'Neal to be in the game

WWE,3c85vt,streethistory,3,Sun Jul 5 20:21:24 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say that it was really a MOTY candidate. A non-PPV MOTY candidate is probably right for it.
WWE,3c85vt,streethistory,4,Mon Jul 6 09:21:46 2015 UTC,My DVR fucked the recording during this part of Raw and it did for others I know. This could be why. I had to watch this match on download.
WWE,3c85vt,streethistory,2,Mon Jul 6 02:52:44 2015 UTC,My DVR fucked the recording during this part of Raw     DirecTV issue?  That  was one negative factor on ratings but lack of sporting events known to compete for Raw eyeballs should have more than compensated.
WWE,3c85vt,streethistory,2,Mon Jul 6 14:11:29 2015 UTC,"I have Charter. The girl I know, I don't know what she has but she's from Memphis. She said her DVR had Raw listed differently or something. Not quite sure."
WWE,3c85vt,shitastrophe,2,Mon Jul 6 14:30:41 2015 UTC,"I have Charter.    Interesting - I hadn't heard about that issue.  MY cable company DVR caught it but only once even though I have two automatic recordings plus I do two manual ""search and records"" for Wrestling each week.  So if there were issues with three decent sized providers perhaps the number of people wanting to view was not at an 18 year low, even  [ if ] the number of successful viewers was.  Kind of ironic, though, that RAW could be at an 18 year low and still the highest rated show on Cable."
WWE,3c85vt,solips_sonder,2,Mon Jul 6 14:37:59 2015 UTC,More of a sign of how we're watching. I'll bet RAW will be live on the Network sooner than later.

WWE,3c8f6y,BrandonKFTW,6,Mon Jul 6 15:42:54 2015 UTC,"I find it very, very hard to sit down and watch 3 hours of RAW a week when I'm working 9-10 hours every Monday. It's too much to catch up with every week. If it goes back to two hours, I would be more likely be able to sit down and watch it without it being a major time sink."
WWE,3c8f6y,Ectoplasmic,4,Sun Jul 5 22:07:00 2015 UTC,"Because they can prioritize. You don't NEED to see the same match every Monday if they just have it on smackdown instead. Divide the story across shows so people care, not reiterate what happened on raw AGAIN on smackdown."
WWE,3c8f6y,elpachucasunrise,2,Sun Jul 5 22:19:20 2015 UTC,"WWE churns out six hours of original programming a week between Raw, SD and NXT; 9 hours on weeks of PPV's. It's just too much.  It would be a bit different if the extra hour of Raw had been used to have consistent and well-written mid and lower card feuds. It hasn't. Creative has mostly been stretching the same amount of plot development and wrestling that filled two hours over 3 hours. 2 hours of Raw and 2 hours of Smackdown is plenty of time to fit Divas in and they choose not to. It's not like they are getting bumped for more deserving matches most of the time."
WWE,3c8f6y,shinedownsgirl,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:15:40 2015 UTC,"So we aren't necessarily want it to be 2 hours, we just want the extra hour to be used well? I can't argue with that."

Just mine opinion.
WWE,3c8f6y,Kingsta8,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:06:09 2015 UTC,They're already showing about two hours of actual worthwhile content. The rest is the filler thrown in. Cut the third hour and focus on making the two awesome.
WWE,3c8f6y,KNGootch,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:04:44 2015 UTC,"If WWE produced a three hour show worth watching every Monday, we'd have no problem with the format. However, there's been no long-term benefit to Raw being a 3-hour show, as other users cited examples of how poorly this extra time has been used.  To anyone mentioning the Monday Night Wars, that started 20 years ago. The way television shows are produced, the way audiences watch television shows in general has changed dramatically. Far less viewers watch a show during it's regularly scheduled airtime, instead using DVRs or streaming services to watch content when they want to watch it. 3 hour episodes of any TV show aren't going to be universally well-received in this generation of TV viewership."
WWE,3c8f6y,Kaynos72,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:16:03 2015 UTC,"I'm alright with 3 hours, they just need to fix it to where women's wrestling can actually be a thing, and maybe even base the stories on the wrestling instead of their awful drama nonsense. Also, if they cut out a lot of the repetitive go nowhere stuff.  Authority is in power, lets remind everyone.  Cena talks to much, lets prove it. Bray Wyatt cuts new promo against new opponent, lets make sure that goes no where.  I'd imagine a 2 hour show would not get rid of those things."
WWE,3c8f6y,cyberklown28,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:47:19 2015 UTC,"because they fill the 3 hours with too much crap.  shorter promos, more matches that aren't as long, less commercial breaks in the middle of matches.  there is far too much nonsense in the 3 hours.  thats why NXT is so good, they only have an hour, so they jam pack it with matches and short promos, its perfect."
WWE,3c8f6y,Flam0us,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:33:04 2015 UTC,Who can stand watching that show live anymore ?  I mean half the show is ads.  I record RAW and watch it on fast forward to skip the ads.  I dont have 3 hours to waste.  And divas matches ?  I dont really care a match from time to time but i saw raw episodes with up to 3...  is the WWE really lacking content to give us 3 divas matches ?

Henry, Show, Kane with Kane coming out on top and returning as demon Kane, a run that ends beside his brother at WM32."

WWE,3c35pg,sonybravo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:36:30 2015 UTC,Marks a good wrestler but wwe is definitely not using him the way they used to back in like 2010. He went from being with the authority at the team cena vs team authority to going baby face again. He needs a strong opponent possibly could have a fued against both big show and ryback to keep him strong. Or luke harper and erick rowan.
WWE,3c35pg,richbitw,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:39:29 2015 UTC,He should be the leader of the New Day but make them new Nation of Domination or something of that sort. He doesn't need to wrestle often just deliver emphatic Worlds Strongest Body slams whenever necessary. He is a decent talker too. The young guys like Big E could use a mentor like him.

WWE,3c5c8b,1TrueKingInTheNorth,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:47:09 2015 UTC,Multiple feuds would make it super confusing. Wyatt would become like Cesaro&Kidd who just turned face for no reason other than that their rival turned heel.

WWE,3c38s6,mike1883,-2,Sun Jul 5 05:41:29 2015 UTC,Honestly I felt very disappointed about the match. Imo their previous match was way better. It was a good match but it could have been better. At times I was bored by their match. I'm a big fan of both guys. I went into this event with high expectations and was disappointed. I enjoyed part of the diva match. Sucks it had to be ruined by Tamina. Funny thing about the sleeper hold is it put me to sleep in the last match.  Was that a good enough response Rich or do you plan to just called me a hater again?

I think a lot of Dolph's issues would be remedied by making the IC Title kind of fill the void the ""big gold"" WHC left when they unified the belts.  I think the IC title feud should basically headline SmackDown, especially on weeks when they have nothing new for Cena, Reigns, Rollins or Orton to do on SmackDown. I think Dolph has proven himself to be a great IC champ, and I'd watch a lot more SD! if he'd be defending the belt or advancing related storylines every Thursday."

Just give it up Vince, you had a great run but there is only so much you can do."
WWE,3bybur,TheCatterson,5,Fri Jul 3 11:43:59 2015 UTC,Brock Lesnar has not been cited for disregarding safety and always keeps that of his own and his opponents in mind.   He broke three of Nobles ribs not two weeks ago!
WWE,3bybur,1TrueKingInTheNorth,7,Fri Jul 3 12:43:07 2015 UTC,"That being said, he wasn’t too happy with the match that two main event stars put on at Money In The Bank, and they happen to be named Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose.   No No Vince. Don't blame them as you already handcuff them from the beginning. You need to wake the fuck up. You are ruining WWE with your BS PG rating crap. You just about lost the main demographic that put you on the tv rating tops that was once in the 5.0 range. That demographic is the 18 to 40 year olds. They watch and they spend the money on what you advertise. Kids may watch but they don't have the buying power of an adult.  Frankly I just about had it with the product and it is not the wrestlers but all your fucking rules hindering a god match and good mic moments. I saw Ring of Honor today ( I taped it earlier) for the first time, and I was impressed how that non PG Philly crowd of 18 to 40 demographic were so into the matches I got into it as well."
WWE,3bybur,gaseouspartdeux,3,Fri Jul 3 10:07:20 2015 UTC,There is nothing wrong with Seth as champ. The problem lies with lack of story or interesting booking from top to bottom. Always involving The Authority is what makes Seth limited and tiresome.
WWE,3bybur,doobiesmack,4,Fri Jul 3 12:33:53 2015 UTC,"It is down to the jurisdictiom of the superstars on how they risk their bodies during the fights. Or at least that is how should be. Safety is key to maintaining a professional business like this but there are boundaries to which it starts becoming a bit tedious to work with. Ultimately it is all hypocritical, especially considering how they make some stars work through injuries. This is why I hope Vince retires soon...the sad thing is he is more likely to die before even considering that."
WWE,3bybur,TsetsesTest,2,Fri Jul 3 07:41:49 2015 UTC,"It's funny because he's still the champ. You'd think if Vince was THAT concerned, he'd take action."
WWE,3bybur,Putnum,2,Fri Jul 3 05:27:05 2015 UTC,Well considering that Rollins defends it in 2 weeks I'd say his days as champ could very well be numbered.
WWE,3bybur,richbitw,2,Fri Jul 3 08:09:44 2015 UTC,"Rumor going around is seth is meant to retain the title but there is meant to be an interference half way through the match. At this stage I don't think wwe wants seth to lose the title now that sheamus has the briefcase. I just have this honest feeling that in a few months time wwe will build it up so that dean, roman, seth, brock and sheamus will verse each other for the title. These guys atm are the biggest superstars going in wwe. Sheamus turning heel certainly has built his character which has pushed him up into roman and dean's rank except in a negative way.   For some reason I see kofi betraying new day now that bo's joined in and he gets pushed to either go for the ict or world heavy weight one."
WWE,3bybur,sonybravo,2,Fri Jul 3 11:28:55 2015 UTC,That certainly would have been a great Elimination Chamber match with the people you mentioned and throw Cena in too.

WWE,3c1827,Asdfghjkl169,3,Tue Jul 7 23:11:50 2015 UTC,This has to be the stupidest complaint I've seen about the wwe.
WWE,3c1827,whatsthehappenstance,2,Fri Jul 3 23:19:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, but I really can't think of a more asinine complaint to raise regarding WWE."
WWE,3c1827,Xstasy14,2,Sat Jul 4 00:15:37 2015 UTC,"I was going to hate on your comment, then I read your username and couldn't help but reminisce about watching every minute of that incredible WR corps."
WWE,3bvlcj,Often_Confused,5,Thu Jul 2 14:44:12 2015 UTC,He's awesome. I'm a bit worried that by the time he goes to the main roster he'll be 35 which is quite late for a long main event run. He definitely deserves it though
WWE,3bvlcj,snickerdo,5,Thu Jul 2 14:56:17 2015 UTC,"Wasn't DDP 35 before he became the ""people's champ""?"
WWE,3bvlcj,ExodusNBW,3,Thu Jul 2 18:27:02 2015 UTC,People said the same thing about Batista.....but he had a decent ME run.....left for movies....and came back for what should have been another if not for crappy timing.   I believe he was what...33 in OVW?  Now VINCE thinking 35 is too old and never giving him a chance........that's a possibility.
WWE,3bvlcj,dead_wolf_walkin,3,Thu Jul 2 16:01:09 2015 UTC,"That segment about him made me remember how much I like wrestling better now that kayfabe is dead. I love getting to see behind the scenes stuff, and learning about the person, not just the character."

WWE,3bvlcj,Ectoplasmic,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:16:27 2015 UTC,"I'm convinced he's losing dirty to Owens and this will set up an Owens - Balor feud after Owens is done with Cena. All this billing for this match as ""Finn Balor Arrives"" means main roster. He's not going to hold the NXT Title."
WWE,3bvlcj,tamere2k,0,Fri Jul 3 00:09:29 2015 UTC,"He's still tedious and not all that interesting in the ring, he's got everything else down but that.  I wouldn't have a clue as to how to fix his moveset but I feel it could be as simple as throwing in a moonsault, senton or SSP here and a couple of suplexes there, something like that."
WWE,3bvlcj,solips_sonder,0,Thu Jul 2 16:23:31 2015 UTC,Definitely a couple of suplexes.  Not so much with SSP's... Maybe a dragon sleeper or some other brutal looking submission?
WWE,3bvlcj,itcouldhappen1,0,Thu Jul 2 19:37:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe not a SSP. He has a similar build to AJ Styles so I thought it night look alright but on second thought, nah.  Actually, now that you mention it, no one is using the dragon sleeper in the WWE. I have been saying he desperately needs a proper looking finisher, he'd look so good applying the Dragon Sleeper and knocking his opponents out with that, especially in he's all painted up.   He'd have to turn heel though, which is not necessarily a bad thing for a ""demon""."
WWE,3bvlcj,solips_sonder,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:49:03 2015 UTC,"Nah, he doesn't have to be heel.  Think of the dragon sleeper as his super finisher and it'll work.  He just needs to play up a bit on his technical skills as opposed to his striking. That would make his matches more fun.  Have him counter more moves and throw people around.  Itami's style is kick.  Balors should be different."
WWE,3bvlcj,itcouldhappen1,2,Thu Jul 2 20:07:37 2015 UTC,"Let's say, Fergal Devitt is a face but the Demon King (Balor) inside of him is a monster heel and to beat Owens he had to more or less unleash the demon and once released he's unable to bring the demon back inside himself. nevermind, just finished watching NXT, apparently to beat Owens, all you need is Rhyno's fat ass.  To finish Owens he Coup de Grace's him and as Owens gasps for air, Balor grabs Owen's head drags him away from the ropes and while still grounded and blood chokes him with a Dragon Sleeper knocking Owens out. Keeps that finishing combo from here on.  Balor, from this point onwards, uses a more grounded offense, targeting limbs with simple holds like Armbars, Kimuras, Kneebars, Ankle Locks and Crab Variants but mostly sticks to suplexes- Snap, Fisherman, Slingshot, T-Bone, German, Reverse, Dragon, Tiger, Half-n-Half, Pump Handle, Tazplex, still does Kicks and Knees but mostly for show and filler.  Yep, I'm happy with this new fictional Balor."

He does the awful leg slap when he kicks and looks ridiculous. His finisher is just pulling someone down. He fucks up the fame asser, even though he just has to put his leg up and fall. He gave himself a concussion. WHILE RUNNING. He has the worst name of any wrestler ever. What kind of name is Dolph Ziggler. When he cashed in Money In The Bank he cashed it in on Alberto Del Rio, who couldn't even fucking stand and almost lost. He oversells everything and flops around.

The impact is lost."

WWE,3bt4ky,ATXBartenders,2,Wed Jul 1 22:50:34 2015 UTC,"What is funny to me about articles like the one the OP links to is that people think championships matter more than feuds. Throughout the 1980s and up to 1997, the WWF really only had the Intercontinental, Tag Team, and WWF titles, yet many people still had rivalries. What would help WWE is introducing more rivalries, friendships, alliances, etc. Giving the wrestlers people they care about on screen, it makes a run in more interesting if there is a chance a friend will come to even the score.  Booking wrestling isn't hard; why do these two men, women, or tag teams want to fight? Once you have a reason, you can build it from there, and if that person isn't a lone wolf, there's flexibility if an injury occurs. A good example is the Royal Rumble, and how a WrestleMania match can stem from being eliminated in the Rumble. Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle wanted a match because they cost each other a shot at winning the Rumble in 2005. Then it was just about answering the question, ""Who's better?"" A simple storyline that was worked very well.  Nowadays, look at the Divas, IC Champ, and US Champ: most of the time, it's random title matches and random changes. Why not have a lower card feud over who gets an IC title shot? That's how it used to be back when it was 1 of 3 titles. Giving people reasons to want to wrestle, even the most basic of those stories adds some depth to the match. What we have right now is wrestling just to wrestle; there's no real point if you're not WWE Champion, a point that WWE has made far too evident."

WWE,3bqumr,richbitw,6,Wed Jul 1 12:23:05 2015 UTC,"I believe so, he seems to be handling every one of them greatly. He is great at what he does for the company, especially in such a short amount of time."
WWE,3bqumr,Je2ffh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:51:50 2015 UTC,"Hopefully he drops the NXT title to Balor, and moves on from NXT.   Samoa (injury everyone) Joe, is similar to Sting in the WWE, cool to see them for a match, after that no one cares about them."
WWE,3bqumr,Xstasy14,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:31:38 2015 UTC,"Injury to everyone? What happened to Tyson was because Tyson works all year with very little time off, he had just done the chamber match the night before and fought Joe in a pre show dark match literally less then 24 hours after competing in one of the most dangerous matches in WWE history. I love seeing Joe in the WWE, he's great at what he does and can make almost anyone look good in a match, unless it's a jobber but that's the point. Joe has been doing the muscle buster for years and never hurt anyone before Tyson. It was just a freak accident and pretty much everyone understands that.   I think Owens does drop the title to Balor on Saturday though. But he'll still finish out his feud with Joe and get his rematch with Balor before he goes to the main roster."
WWE,3bqumr,Je2ffh,2,Wed Jul 1 14:21:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed with Joe, that was a freak accident.  On a side note.  I think Owens drops the title to Balor in Japan, it makes sense considering how over Balor is over there.  I'm leaning on no rematch though and him focusing on the US Title.  For some reason I see Joe causing something at Battleground during the Cena match.  Whether that leads to Joe/Cena/Owens at SS or what it leads to I have no idea.  I wish I knew more when they expected Itami back, because my money is on Balor being the one who layed him out, and that would be his next big feud."
WWE,3bqumr,theAmazingDead,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:54:10 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same thing he's been booked tremendously well and he's acted the part perfectly. I'm just a bit worried that his character will be negatively affected if he loses some feuds like to Balor but wins the Cena one.
WWE,3bqumr,Je2ffh,2,Wed Jul 1 14:30:48 2015 UTC,"He only drops it to Balor due to outside interference, by Joe probably, but it won't be a clean finish, and honestly I don't see him beating Cena for the title at Battleground, Cena is radiating too much buzz work his opens for him to drop it to a new comer in the WWE. I'd love to see it happen though, but I don't think so, at least not this early."
WWE,3bqumr,Alernet,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:39:53 2015 UTC,That could work as far as getting the NXT belt off of him and keeping him looking strong. As far as Cena goes I think you may be right as to why he will retain although I wouldn't mind seeing KO doing a weekly open challenge of his own.
WWE,3bqumr,The_Last_Tweener,3,Wed Jul 1 14:56:15 2015 UTC,"Yes. His thing is that he ""fights everyone""."
WWE,3bqumr,GreatEscortHaros,3,Wed Jul 1 13:08:27 2015 UTC,"I agree he's been handling all of them well, I'm just waiting for the day when they all converge on him at once lol."
WWE,3bqumr,TheRulesGuy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:29:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. His feud with Balor was really hurt by that when, until one week ago, it was his only title feud."
WWE,3bqumr,dbtg,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:40:10 2015 UTC,I think it really is. People who don't recognize him from NXT are being given plenty of opportunity to recognize him him which is much more than we can say about Adrian Neville.

That's not a lot of time to decide and there's no time to research footage. They probably assumed it was his middle finger and did what was smart by blacking out the screen.   We don't have to love the PG era but we can't really bitch when they block out parts that aren't part of what their live product is agreed to be.

WWE,3bkxc3,TBoy8498,2,Tue Jun 30 02:33:10 2015 UTC,That's what I say to.
WWE,3bkxc3,awesomesau,4,Tue Jun 30 04:23:49 2015 UTC,I act super shocked then i start weeping and blaming them for ruining my world.
WWE,3bkxc3,Im_Dubaya,6,Tue Jun 30 01:55:25 2015 UTC,Over-exaggerated shock and disbelief is always fun
WWE,3bkxc3,zetswei,4,Tue Jun 30 02:10:25 2015 UTC,I just ask them how real their tv shows they like are
WWE,3bkxc3,Mcourd,2,Tue Jun 30 02:05:03 2015 UTC,This is what I do. I ask what their favorite show is. Then berate them on liking something more fake than wrestling.
WWE,3bkxc3,jamesacichon,3,Tue Jun 30 02:19:36 2015 UTC,I show them THE hell in a cell match.

WWE,3bkxc3,cyberklown28,3,Wed Jul 1 13:39:40 2015 UTC,Ask them if you can do a 5-Star Splash on them.
WWE,3bkxc3,schroepnuts,2,Tue Jun 30 03:11:45 2015 UTC,"That its predetermined and scripted(most of the time). But, there is no way to fake getting hit with REAL weapons and being thrown around. A ring isn't THAT padded."
WWE,3bkxc3,PizzaBeerFootball,2,Tue Jun 30 11:18:31 2015 UTC,"Everything on TV is scripted storylines with fictional characters. This brings the drama of primetime tv and mixes it with the passion and emotion of sports, cheering and booing guys. Nothing else on tv can do what wrestling does."
WWE,3bkxc3,theboywhoblazed,2,Tue Jun 30 12:45:31 2015 UTC,ask them if they like action movies. then say those are fake too.
WWE,3bkxc3,DemiGod9,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:38:49 2015 UTC,Exactly as is basically everything on TV.
WWE,3bkxc3,smackjack,2,Tue Jun 30 14:57:21 2015 UTC,"So are movies with stunt doubles, but in wrestling the actors/actresses do their own stunts.  I still find it entertaining."
WWE,3bkxc3,SchrodingersMatt,2,Tue Jun 30 15:37:04 2015 UTC,"I tell them, ""It's not fake; it's scripted. You can't just go into a ring and wrestle. You have to train and work for it. It requires actual work."""
WWE,3bkxc3,GreatEscortHaros,2,Tue Jun 30 17:23:32 2015 UTC,"""Hell, even the News is fake most of the time."" Is always an accepted response of mines. Or when it's someone who doesn't know I can cry on command, I bawl my eyes and and throw a tantrum. Bonus points if we're hanging out together in public"
WWE,3bkxc3,spareyacht89,2,Tue Jun 30 18:59:26 2015 UTC,The people that chastise wrestling for being fake are the same people who watch reality shows and actually believe that everything in those shows is real
WWE,3bkxc3,Drpained,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:07:03 2015 UTC,"To quote Nick Diener, in his article about Ultimate Warrior.   Pro Wrestling is fake. That's supposed to be the deterrent from watching and loving this often misunderstood art form. Do you watch movies? Do you realise that guy didn't ACTUALLY get shot? Do you realise that guy isn't ACTUALLY flying? Then why did you jump out of your seat? Why did you cry? Why did you cheer? It's all fake. When something is great enough or tells the story convincingly enough, we suspend our disbelief. Characters become heroes to millions. We get caught up in the drama of something that deep down, we knew was a work of fiction. One man suspended our disbelief from the moment we experienced his god-like voice and appearance. A man that lived with more intensity than ten men. His name was The Ultimate Warrior."
WWE,3bkxc3,Jermthawerm,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:14:44 2015 UTC,I guess I should stop enjoying television shows and movies since those aren't real either eh?
WWE,3bm7e5,wwewwe45,3,Tue Jun 30 10:12:43 2015 UTC,"He's coming back, just continuing his year long trolling and teasing that he'll leave in order to force a push.  No way he just disappears with the current storyline. Lana would be heartbroken.  #ZigZag4Champ"
WWE,3bm7e5,cyberklown28,2,Tue Jun 30 12:57:03 2015 UTC,I like you
WWE,3bm7e5,Tacothekid,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:26:21 2015 UTC,"Good, he's garbage."
WWE,3bm7e5,xXDaNXx,-4,Tue Jun 30 19:26:07 2015 UTC,"hopefully he doesn't resign, then they can pair Lana with someone who's actually capable of making her the face of the company like Ambrose or Reigns"
WWE,3bkuqp,Im_Dubaya,3,Tue Jun 30 01:21:37 2015 UTC,"something something ""I know exactly how Cesaro feels""  something something ""I've been there before""  something something ""Battleground""  Hate Cena all you want, but at least he doesn't sound like a speak and spell that a toddler uses when he's on the mic"
WWE,3bkuqp,bonobo14,2,Tue Jun 30 01:32:10 2015 UTC,"""With all do respect Bryan I will try to ignore what you just said because...I don't feel it's even something I need to respond to""   It's just the way he stumbled through it. He sounded so awkward it made me cringe. What I hate most about him is that they have made him go along with the twisted, idiotic reasoning. His idea that Cena was disrespecting him when he shook Owen's hand just drives me crazy."
WWE,3bkuqp,V_O_L_S,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:42:45 2015 UTC,Today he seemed kind of repetitive. Usually he's not though. I really enjoy him on NXT commentary.
WWE,3bkuqp,DetectiveCactus,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:43:18 2015 UTC,"All these people making assumptions on his ""first"" impression on RAW, he did/does this shit all time on NXT and does it well."
WWE,3bkuqp,Ectoplasmic,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:20:24 2015 UTC,"They should of let him stay a commodity. He didn't even need to be there tonite, his only role was to save Cesaro from taking the loss and to attack Cena....again. When his whole feud with Cena started, I figured they'd get a match or two and then he'd drop the NXT title and come up to feud with someone else. Instead, they've brought him out almost every show in true Cena fashion to talk and talk and become stale. He's got the skills to be a great all-around heel but they're going overboard, as they do with everything else."
WWE,3bkuqp,bellboy3,0,Tue Jun 30 15:42:56 2015 UTC,You don't have to be good on commentary to be a good wrestler/superstar.
WWE,3bkuqp,1TrueKingInTheNorth,6,Tue Jun 30 01:30:13 2015 UTC,"True, but inability to work a mic kills careers before they get off the ground. Just as Cesaro, Ryback, hell even Reigns to an extent"
WWE,3bkuqp,bonobo14,-1,Tue Jun 30 01:33:52 2015 UTC,Yeah but Owens can work a mic. He just can't do commentary very well. There's a difference.
WWE,3bkuqp,1TrueKingInTheNorth,-4,Tue Jun 30 01:43:06 2015 UTC,Have you listened to him on the mic? He has the same response to everything every week
WWE,3bkuqp,zetswei,0,Tue Jun 30 02:03:22 2015 UTC,"Most superstars do these days. They say the exact same thing week after week with slight tweaks. Lately, the difference between someone good in the mic and someone bad on the mic is whether they can say the same thing in enough interesting new ways to satisfy the lull between ppv's, where stuff actually happens and the story actually moves forward"
WWE,3bkuqp,1TrueKingInTheNorth,0,Tue Jun 30 02:12:15 2015 UTC,"No, Owens literally says the same line every week, followed by pouting and turning his head like he's mad everytime he can't think of a response. Everyone who has gone against him in WWE on the mic has run circles around him so far."
WWE,3bkuqp,zetswei,0,Tue Jun 30 14:38:49 2015 UTC,"True, but I feel like it hurts him to put him in a situation like that. They should play his strengths, like instead of commentary, just have him sitting there watching, waiting, and just get in Cena's head.  He seems like the heel we deserve, but they need to keep him working the mic in promos, he's good at that"
WWE,3bkuqp,bonobo14,0,Tue Jun 30 01:39:14 2015 UTC,"they need to keep him working the mic in promos, he's good at that   So prewritten monologues that are given to him? haha  I totally agree btw. Either that or give him a manager. Pair him with Zeb Colter maybe? He's the only manager that I can think of that isn't doing anything right now"
WWE,3bkuqp,1TrueKingInTheNorth,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:42:16 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with a script, as long as he can sell it, and he sells it.  Manager sounds like a great idea, maybe he can be another Heyman guy."
WWE,3bm8x2,wwewwe46,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:34:32 2015 UTC,It'll certainly make them seem important that way. Also draw more attention to it rather than being an excuse to further a feud.
WWE,3bm8x2,Ectoplasmic,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:25:51 2015 UTC,"Can someone back me up please? I remember ONE issue of WWF Magazine had Pee-Wee Herman as a constant for ""Best Bow Tie"" but he was never mentioned again. Aside from that, it's just a gimmick to kill time now"
WWE,3bm8x2,Tacothekid,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:25:37 2015 UTC,Wait.... do people actually care about Slammy's?
WWE,3bl65b,Benjaminthe3rd,2,Tue Jun 30 02:57:03 2015 UTC,"I guess from a realistic sense, it takes out the possibility of you getting dominated and gives you a chance to escape and get a comeback. Sort of 'If I uphold this, maybe they will to'.  That's what I tell myself at least if it makes any sense.."
WWE,3bl65b,GreatEscortHaros,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:13:00 2015 UTC,On a high note at least Rollins is getting better at the pedigree.
WWE,3bl65b,Im_Dubaya,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:01:32 2015 UTC,Still wish he had a different finisher.

WWE,3bl65b,cfox0835,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:17:19 2015 UTC,It's one of the those flawed wrestling rules. As long as the legal man makes the pin I see no problem with every man being in at the same time.
WWE,3bl65b,richbitw,0,Tue Jun 30 03:49:06 2015 UTC,You have to be the legal man and pin the legal man to win the match.
