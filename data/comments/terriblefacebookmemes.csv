terriblefacebookmemes,3did3v,HayleeLOL,19,Thu Jul 16 15:19:03 2015 UTC,I get very offended! Mostly as someone who's written in the past; I'm mostly just appalled at the laziness of the joke. The casual sexism doesn't help.

terriblefacebookmemes,3did3v,HayleeLOL,0,Fri Jul 17 13:46:08 2015 UTC,"Well, it all depends on why you didn't find it funny I suppose.    I made an assumption that you didn't find it funny because of some offensive quality because of several of the needlessly negative comments in this thread (it's sexist, it's a kitchen joke, etc.), in which case they'd be absolutely right to call you out on being overly offended.  However, if you just didn't get a kick out of the joke, didn't understand it, or felt the delivery was too tame, then it'd be silly to presume you were offended.  But looking at this thread, you can see why I made that assumption, and if you weren't clear on why you felt this didn't amuse you, it should be easy to see why others would make that same assumption."
terriblefacebookmemes,3did3v,Italian_Barrel_Roll,8,Fri Jul 17 13:52:33 2015 UTC,"Simple answer: they don't amuse me because they're boring and extremely low effort. You literally just have to say ""LOL WOMAN GET BACK TO THE KITCHEN"" and somehow that's funny?"

terriblefacebookmemes,3did3v,Lobkowicz,5,Thu Jul 16 23:37:52 2015 UTC,Clearly that's not what you meant. Could you not sense the sarcasm?  So it's ok for you to make fun of my maymay (I know you're making fun of it because you called it that) but it isn't ok for OP's meme to make lighthearted fun of a demographic?

terriblefacebookmemes,3did3v,toriar,7,Fri Jul 17 11:58:07 2015 UTC,The reactions are funny because people are trying so hard to signal their anti-sexism that they completely missed the fact that the joke is mocking sexism.
