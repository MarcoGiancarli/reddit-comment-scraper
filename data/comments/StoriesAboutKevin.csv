He knows he does not mean it, but the listener is none the wiser. They are left thinking, ""That guy and his beliefs are insane,"" and thus, to Kevin's mind, he has won, accomplishing his task, while all onlookers think he has lost.

It would paint an unfair picture of him to only tell of how he accidentally asked out with a girl that was his complete foil without telling you about how his mind operates or some of his other attributes.

It's only ever had the one save file and I keep it out if it's sentimental value, being one of the few things I have from her with any real emotions attached.  I would hate to have that save file deleted, as it actually reminds me of her more than photographs of her. I can only imagine how it would feel if I was Kevin.  Hell, even practically, that file's been there for we'll over a decade, so to recreate it all from memory would be nearly impossible."
StoriesAboutKevin,336kzs,TheTweets,12,Sun May 10 06:44:35 2015 UTC,"Hell, even practically, that file's been there for we'll over a decade   You should definitely consider looking into getting a backup save at this point, as the save battery inside (which, surprisingly, holds the save data) is likely to run out soon - my Pokemon Gold cartridge has lost its save battery at this point, and my Gen 1 games probably aren't far behind. I know that some old cheat devices, like Monster Brain, and other devices, like the Mega Memory Card, can create a copy of the save data - so I recommend trying to find one of those.  Don't try replacing the save battery just yet, as replacing the save battery will delete the save file. Get a backup save life that you KNOW is reliable, replace the save battery, then restore the save file."

StoriesAboutKevin,2usdg2,_orion,8,Thu Feb 5 04:44:36 2015 UTC,I may write one. Looking back he really did effect the way I see individuals and people. Billiam may be the quintessence of man. The only way to know is for people to know his story.
StoriesAboutKevin,2usdg2,godisuckatnames,4,Thu Feb 5 04:51:44 2015 UTC,"She was a little older, maybe 40. But she was slim and, of course, had very large boobs. Usually wore less clothing because it was so damn hot there. Very enthusiastic about reading and literature, which was nice. but a bit of a stickler when it comes to sexual harassment apparently."
StoriesAboutKevin,2usdg2,tutoredzeus,5,Wed Feb 4 22:42:07 2015 UTC,"I once had a substitute teacher in highschool, huge knockers, looked like drew carrey, down to the same glasses. It was horrible and she was a nasty woman, that was my thoughts of her before she tried getting me expelled for sitting quietly reading ""The art of manilness in class"" It wasn't that I was ignoring her or not doing what i was supposed to it was because she ""had a feeling nothing of good could be in a book with this title"" she thumbed threw and dog eared pages to show the principle. It was a pretty shitty situation but i got outta any punishment for inciting and arguement with a subsitute and being sent to the principles office, even though i didn't make it by taking a detour to my truck and leaving.   Either she was never called to return or refused because she was never back."

StoriesAboutKevin,2usdg2,Galaxyan,8,Wed Feb 4 23:06:52 2015 UTC,"Ya, looking back I do feel bad for him. I guess his consistency really just threw people off. Like every single day he would commit to failure after failure of social stunts.   I promise you though, besides a few instances of immediate retaliation for his dumbass actions, Billy was really not bullied in school as far as I am aware.   Seemed like a pretty happy-go-lucky kid too. Just very odd with very poor judgement."

The only difference is this kid was to stupid to get away with anything. I got a story of him winning a WWE fight.  So 7th grade math class. Well Ryan was a bit of the out there kid. Nothing wro with him just out there. So Ryan walks into class with a WWE belt and when asked about it claims he won it in a fight set up by WWE or what ever. K Ryan, no one believes this kid but they don't say anything. Well Ryan got upset that no one believes him and says he'll show us his winning move. Ryan please no. Ryan takes this kid in like a bear grip. Ryan stop. And I shit you not body slams the kid, not really too hard, onto a desk and breaks it. Ohhh shit why Ryan.  Well over comes the teacher and she is worried but pissed. She was nice as hell and never got mad. But this time Ryan really fucked up. She grabes Ryan and just leave us in the room and takes him to the office. I guess she told another teacher and that teacher came over and watched both classes. Most kids just talked and didn't have act out so it was cool. Now the teacher comes back and no ryan. Forgot the other kid went to the nurse and than sent to the doctors. We see Ryans parents walk into  the school (nearby window) and than after about 15 minutes ryan leave with his parents. He only got suspended for a week. Also to finish up. When ryan got back he blamed the kid for him getting in trouble. God damn ryan."
