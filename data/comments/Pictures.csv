Pictures,3d560g,Bowerbird-likes-Blue,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:12:32 2015 UTC,"No, this is western Maine. It was the first time I have seen a Gray Jay. I had stopped to wait for my friend and when he showed up the bird showed up also. He was really interested in what we were doing. I went and pulled out a bag of GORP while the bird watched what I was doing. At first he was just swooping down and trying to grab the peanuts but after a couple he was landing on our hands and taking the peanuts."
