Swimming,3e4vxn,gertrudeblythe,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:24:45 2015 UTC,"The most obvious place to start is /r/divers.  There are probably less than 100 posts there, but some with good info and tips so I'd go through each post.  Beyond that, unfortunately diving doesn't seem to have a big online presence.  I've searched high and low and only found a handful of articles/tutorials/lessons.  Here are few good videos to get you started:  Standing front pike, back dive tuck, inward pike  Biggest quick tip: when leaving the board, jump up not out.  As a swimmer, it's second nature for us to want to go forwards and out since that is the entire concept in swimming, but this is completely detrimental to springboard diving (I assume you're not going to do platform yet).  You want as much height as possible.  The board will move you forward - even if you feel like you might hit it, you almost certainly won't."

Swimming,3e4sr5,zetsui,20,Tue Jul 21 23:24:25 2015 UTC,"The Freestyle (front crawl) and Backstroke kicks are extremely similar in how they function. However, mirror imaging aside, there are slight differences that set these two kicks apart. Also, what you know and were taught about these kicks is incorrect.   First, and foremost, try your best to forget about keeping the knees straight and your toes pointed. These are general pointers given to children in order for them to stray away from creating bad habits for when they eventually learn the correct kick.  When doing the Freestyle and Backstroke kicks, here are the general rules that both kicks have in common:  The kick starts from the hips, and requires relaxed knees and ankles. This is contrary to what your teacher taught you in the past about having locked knees and pointed toes. Imagine that both of your legs are amputated from about mid thigh, down. The flutter kick (which is what this kick is called) requires completely loose legs, as if the lower leg was not even there.  Now, imagine a whip, and how it works. Your legs work in a similar way when doing this kick. The whip is slowest at the base (your hips), and fastest at the tip (your toes). If you relax your knees and ankles, the density of the water will force your knees to slightly bend, and your foot to point. Once your upper leg reaches full extension, your lower leg will ""catch up"" and create that whip effect. That effect is what you're looking for in terms of speed. This speed is what gives you the majority of your kick's velocity in the water.   The release backwards on the kick is a bit different. Your leg cannot bend past what your knee allows, so it's basically a straight recovery back to the start of where the whip begins.   Finding the right speed for your kick is a matter of testing it in the water. Having huge, slow kicks will nearly completely hinder your kick, making you sit in place. Having kicks that are too small will give you a whip effect that's too small to propel you in the water. There's a balance between medium range, quick kicks that you're looking for. Also, remember that swimming IS a workout. Your legs are a lot less effective than your arms for both Freestyle and Backstroke, thus your legs will need to kick hard and fast to get much out of it. The flutter kick requires a constant and continuous repeating rhythm. Expect your leg muscles to burn when doing the kick correctly.  Now for the differences between the flutter kick on your front and back:  When floating on the front, your body position is slightly lower than when you're on your back. Also, when on your front, the part of the kick that propels you in the water is the downward thrust. You should have a bit more room (depending on the depth that you're swimming in) during your Freestyle downward kick, because you don't have to worry about your foot exiting the water while kicking downwards. This allows for your entire downwards kick to be utilized, no matter what. When you're kicking on your back, with an already higher body position, the upward kick is what makes you move in the water. You have to keep in mind that when you kick upwards, your foot may exit the water. If this happens (which it shouldn't), you will lose part of the the energy it took to move your leg, thus making for a useless part of the kick that is supposed to propel you forward. You don't want to kick outside of the water because air is much less dense than water!   Sorry for being wordy. I was trying to give you the best description possible. I hope this helps!"
Swimming,3e4sr5,InfiniteVirtue,2,Wed Jul 22 01:42:22 2015 UTC,"This was the most complete explanation of flutter kick I have seen, thank you!"
Swimming,3e4sr5,ivy_dream,2,Wed Jul 22 05:11:57 2015 UTC,Flutter kick is the same in freestyle and backstroke. Kick from your hips with little bent in the knees and toes pointed. Utilising the up kick as well as the down kick both in backstroke and freestyle to get the maximum distance in your kick.
Swimming,3e4sr5,coolkh13,2,Wed Jul 22 00:57:24 2015 UTC,"All of the answers so far have been very technical about the differences between the two kicks. While yes, both kicks required your feet to go through the exact same motion, the balance of muscles that are involved in each kick are different. For example, the backstroke flutter kick is much more hamstring and glute dominant because your legs require more power to kick downwards as opposed to up because the water is slightly more dense below you. The front crawl freestyle kick is fundamentally the same kick, however it is more quad dominated because the water that is moved by your legs is going to be more dense. I have found that thinking about this imbalance of density has helped me to think about the power in my kick and really even out the speed in both directions. Hopefully that helps!"
Swimming,3e4icb,orisuru,3,Tue Jul 21 22:05:13 2015 UTC,"Definitely interval training. It is harder to hold yourself to a difficult sendoff, but you might be surprised how your pace falls off while you're swimming continuously too. Interval training is much better at holding you to the clock. If you like that kind of distance training you're doing when swimming continuously you can always throw in a long set like 40x100s and then you can pick a sendoff that is difficult to make and see how long you can hold it. Since you know how to do flip turns I say definitely! Keep working on them and eventually they'll become second nature, and way faster than an open turn. Breathing every 3 strokes is generally best because it prevents your neck and back from becoming lopsided which can cause injury. However I often felt I needed more air when I was working hard and I'll say that breathing every 2 when you need it is fine as long as you switch the direction of breathing every length or every two lengths. Keep it symmetrical.  You can do all kinds of things outside the pool, my team called it dryland. First priority is probably abs, I'd do a short (15 minutes) ab workout of crunches and bicycles and other floor ab exercises after every swim. Second priority I'd say is shoulders. I'm biased because I wrote it, but there's a good shoulder routine in the sidebar (Link). Other than that you can do almost anything, and provided you're swimming regularly and don't injure yourself it can all be useful. Running, lifting weights, pull ups are always good, there are all kinds of dryland routines you can look up.   Now there may be other qualified athletes and coaches here with different takes than me, and you're welcome to ask any more questions you've got!"
Swimming,3e4icb,chrom_ed,2,Wed Jul 22 03:28:44 2015 UTC,"I can vouch for all of this...   Not much to add here...there's nothing wrong with doing a long set, but if you are going to then you should add some different elements to it. For example continuous rounds of 100s doing drill, build, drill, race or 3 strokes per breathe, 5 strokes, 5 strokes, 7 strokes all by 25s (or something similar). Agreed. If you don't you may be tempted to stop and rest. Keeping 3 strokes per breathe, I find, also helps with the rhythm of my strokes.  What I sometimes enjoy doing really helps with endurance; swim about a 100 (whatever stroke, mix it up a bit), then hop out and do an exercise (rotate the exercise each time you get out). With this, you can aim for an interval but it ends up being continuous. Jump ropes are also really good, especially as a warm up, because it's working most of your body. A good example would be 200 jumps to begin, then a few rounds of 45sec on, 15sec off, 30sec on, 30sec off. Or something similar. Furthermore, if you want to invest a bit of money into your workouts, I found that a TRX is really good because you can use it to work anything. I have one at home and it's great because I can take it when I go on holidays and stuff."
Swimming,3e4icb,OxyPinecho,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:23:13 2015 UTC,"Interval training is the way to go. I've found that writing a practice beforehand is especially helpful when you train on your own. It is hard to make up sets on the fly and it is much easier to set your goals before you jump in.  Definitely stick to flipturns since you already have that down. They definitely aren't easy to do but if you make it a habit, it will add a new dimension to your workout. Just think about the ab and leg strength required. Breathing patterns aren't too important unless you're in a race. In which case you'll want to practice with the exact same pattern that you would use during a race. For fitness swimming, I would recommend using an odd number for your breathing pattern. Either every 3 or 5 strokes. Breathing using an even number will cause you to breath to the same side. Long term, this could cause muscle imbalances. I am a sufferer of this and if I could relearn freestyle I would definitely change to breathing to either side. Dryland, as I call it is vital to getting faster in the water. I would focus on abs, then legs, then arms. Abs should be your highest priority because they provide ""balance"" in the water. Having a strong core can make a huge difference in your stroke technique as well as endurance. As far as exercises go, I would recommend burpees, bicycles, V-ups, squats, low rows, pull ups, calf raises, leg lifts and chest fly with cables."
Swimming,3e4icb,buck_swam,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:15:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot guys, those were some great answers.   Guess no way around it, interval training it is. Just a little bit lost about what should I be aiming for with distance, pace, different styles, etc. Flip turns it is lol, as much as i can. Guess i'll have to try at the pool between 1 every 3 or one every 2 but switching side every lenght or 2 to see witch one ""feels"" better to me since there doesnt seem to be much difference. Focus on abs/core, i always thought that was my weakest link and then legs. Should i do them on the pool days(before or after, immediately before or after or with a few hours rest), on rest days, everyday?Why shoulders though? i think the main muscle there is deltoids and i think it gets a pretty heavy use while swimming, i think my limiting factor would be something else but what do i know.   As for the interval training i was thinking of something like:   warmup: 400m freestyle, 100m medley just legs. That was usually my warmup at younger days ranging from 400/100 to 800/200 2*100 medley 2*100 freestyle 2*50 backstroke  2*50 breaststroke  4*25 butterfly 4*50 freestly sprints 200 whatever to relax/finish  Total 1600m/64 lengths    Not sure about intensity and rest between but seems doable, i have around 1h-1h10m in the pool. What kind of variations should i do so i dont end doing the same thing everyday? And when i feel comfortable and want to add more, where should i start, more sets, more warmup, more sprints? By the way, i love free and fly(even though it kills me after a few laps lol), hate breast and back is ok.  Thanks again guys, you are great."

Swimming,3e3rv6,artotal,6,Tue Jul 21 19:00:44 2015 UTC,"Coach here: ok first things first you need to be exhaling water out of your nose during the flip, here are my reasons why 1)air blowing out your nose keeps water from going up 2) you are probably out of ""air"" because you have a build up of CO2 in your blood and that's what is making you gasp for a fresh breath. If you were slowly and calmly exhaling as you swim and flip you will maximize your breath. Edit: wanted to add something else about breath control; you can go farther than you think and all you need to do is calm down. Ok let me explain, you have way more breath than you think but your brain is having a mini panic attack and out of reflex you take a breath. You see on land you never have the need to push your breath so you only ever use like 30% of your lung capacity. So that leaves 70% of your lungs just not being used. The trick is to push past that point (baby steps of course) and after some practice you will find that you have made amazing strides. Do this by limiting total breaths taken or get on a breathing pattern so that you can increase gradually."
Swimming,3e3rv6,lime_and_coconut,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:41:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for these tips.  Does the body's ""panic reflex"" to breathe go away after a while?"
Swimming,3e3rv6,soundkite,4,Wed Jul 22 06:14:23 2015 UTC,"You need to have strong core to do it fast. One last stroke, take big breath, rotate quickly, exhale all the time during the flip (this will make sure there is no water in your nose). If you still have no air, skip dolphin kicks for now."
Swimming,3e3rv6,kelyar,4,Tue Jul 21 19:12:55 2015 UTC,I kind of lift my head up then throw it down to.do the flip. Is this bad form?
Swimming,3e3rv6,CheshireCrab,6,Tue Jul 21 19:57:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah. That sounds like it introduces unnecessary drag and/or kills your momentum going into the wall. You should be taking a final stroke and then tucking-in in one quick, fluid motion. (Also, I'm assuming you're not lifting your head to see where the wall is. That's another ""no-no"". You should be able to time your flip by looking at the black T at the bottom of the pool.)"
Swimming,3e3rv6,mansaf87,2,Tue Jul 21 20:12:17 2015 UTC,How would I inhale? Have my head tilted to the side for my final breath? When I do that I end up flipping over my shoulder where I take the breath so I roll diagonally rather then forward.
Swimming,3e3rv6,CheshireCrab,2,Tue Jul 21 20:51:07 2015 UTC,You don't inhale on your final stroke into the wall.
Swimming,3e3rv6,mansaf87,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:20:15 2015 UTC,Sorry. I'm a little confused on this. What do you mean into the wall?

Swimming,3e3rv6,kelyar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:28:15 2015 UTC,"why? once you are almost on a surface in streamline position, start doing arm stroke and take a breath as usual. You might not have an air enough for long/powerful dolphin kicks, but for a short/fast flip it is always enough. It requires some practice but is not difficult at all."
Swimming,3e3rv6,betweenthebobbynlee,2,Wed Jul 22 08:15:37 2015 UTC,"You should also work on your pulmonary endurance.  Try to fit as much underwater swimming as you can into your workouts. As with any part of your workout,  keep pushing yourself.  Make sure you get plenty of rest between each UW and just breathe normally in between."
Swimming,3e3rv6,mansaf87,2,Tue Jul 21 19:41:11 2015 UTC,"What works for me is a slow exhalation after the flip. If I blow out all my air really quickly or forcibly, a panic reflex gets triggered.  Try to do a couple of 50s without doing any dolphin kicks. Then do a couple more with one or two easy kicks. And then again with a few rapid dolphin kicks. Find an exhalation tempo that works for you and for whatever pace you're going.  Also, do sets of 3x50s where #1: first 25 is 0-2 breaths (depending on what you can handle), second 25 ez; #2: ez but no breathing into the flags or 1-2 strokes after flip; #3: first 25 ez, no breathing into the flags, second 25 0-2 breaths. Give yourself good rest intervals. This is more of a technical set than anything.  Good luck!"

I always focus and being as long as possible and getting a good distance per stroke. Getting a good DPS means less effort over the course of a few laps and the recovery part of the stroke(when your arms are out of the water) is basically wasted energy in longer distance events.

Swimming,3e2p7a,The_Berry,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:50:41 2015 UTC,I wouldn't worry about your stroke count then. You could probably squeeze one or 2 less strokes but that will come in time.
Swimming,3e2p7a,zettabyte,2,Wed Jul 22 02:37:49 2015 UTC,"What are some possible goals I could set for myself at this point? Should I be working on stamina and distance? or should i continue trying to make improvements in short distances?   As a beginner myself (swimming since October 2014), I faced the same question.  I derived my answer from answering the question, ""Why am I swimming?""  My answer is, ""To improve my sprint/recovery time for Tennis.""  So I swim lots of short distances with short recoveries.  I only swim about 1000m per session, roughly 30 minutes of time.  That gives me the workout I'm looking for.  I swim all four strokes for good muscle coverage.  If you can determine a goal/purpose of why you took up swimming, that should help direct your answers.  If it doesn't, then just pick one thing (swim a 1500m without stopping)."
Swimming,3e2p7a,fiddlestix42,3,Tue Jul 21 19:19:39 2015 UTC,An easy way to develop you DPS is to develop your kick. 15-16 strokes for 1 lap that takes 25 seconds is a fine start. Work om 15 strokes and 20 seconds. Then 14 strokes and 20 seconds. And continue to move down. 12-13 strokes at 14-15 seconds is a good goal.

Swimming,3e4h1w,GuNMast3r75,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:55:53 2015 UTC,"The first thing you need to ask yourself is if you're swimming correctly. If you're able to run 6-7 km/h for a decent period of time, there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to swim 25 meters down a pool without getting winded.   The first thing you need to work on is your posture in the water. This is probably the biggest thing you can do to make your swimming more efficient, and the best way you can do this is by changing what your head position is in the water. Your head is directly connected to your spine, which determines how high/low your hips are in the water.   You mentioned in your post that ""Water keeps sloshing into your mouth."" I'm assuming that you're swimming with your eyes looking forward, and your head almost (if not entirely) out of the water. That is just about the worst thing that you can possibly do with swimming the Freestyle stroke. Fortunately, there's an easy way to fix this. What I want you to do is stand in a neutral position with your legs straight, your feet facing forward, arms at your side, and eyes forward. Now, I want you to look straight up at the ceiling with your chin as high up in the air as you can get it. Notice how your lower back flexes, driving your hips forward. Translate this body position to the water, and you've got yourself with eyes forward, and extremely low hips in the water.   When your hips are low, and you're swimming on your front, you're creating a sort of ""wall"" that your body has to drag through the water. Each arm and leg stroke that you take will require more to drag this wall through the water.   The best thing that you can do is keep your entire head in the water. You can have your head do this in one of three ways: either keep your eyes looking forward while trying to tuck your head down, tuck your chin towards your chest with your eyes looking down towards your feet, or protruding your chin forwards towards the bottom of the pool, similar to how a turtle pokes his head out of his/her shell while looking straight down at the floor. What you want to do is the last option. What this will do is keep your spine as straight as possible, raising your hips as high as possible to effectively glide across the top of the water. Doing this properly will allow for each of your strokes to be much more efficient.   Lastly, I want you to think about what's at the bottom of a lap pool. You will notice that there is a straight line in the middle of the lane, that stretches from end of end of the lane. Roughly 5/6 feet from the end of each lane, the line will ""T."" You should be keeping your eyes looking more-or-less only at this line, and never forward. Seeing the ""T"" will indicate that you are close to the wall, and either need to put your arms forward to not smash your head against the wall, or to set up for a flip turn. Over a period of time, you'll naturally know roughly where you are in the pool without needing to look, allowing you to zone out during your workout!"
Swimming,3e4h1w,InfiniteVirtue,0,Wed Jul 22 03:45:51 2015 UTC,"Your cardio isn't your problem.  Your heart is doing it's job.   My take on your description is that your legs are in shape for running and your arms are not in shape for swimming.   The arms need more oxygen and you're feeling it.   Other than recommending a site like this:    http://ruthkazez.com/SwimWorkouts/ZeroTo1mile.html  I would say that you need to give yourself a break.  It's been 2 years and you need to teach your body what you want it to do again.  In order to stop the panic with the breathing, stop trying to be a hero and just breath every stroke.  No one will judge you.   You know that you will work up to not having to need that, but right now...you need it.  I'm assuming we're talking freestyle here, so swim nice and slow.   Do it as far as you can and then switch to breast stroke.   When doing the breast stroke don't even bother putting your head below the water....you need some air.   Use this resting stroke to get your energy back again.   Once you feel you're up to it again...go back to freestyle.     Repeat this during your workouts and you'll see the gains.     I hadn't been swimming laps in a pool for 25-30 years and then I jumped back in this January.  Doing 100 was a miracle at the time.  I did the above in the beginning and things came around.  You just need to teach your body how to do it again.  I was/am training for a triathlon though so I needed to do it.  I just swam a mile last week and I only stopped because it was a nice round number...not because I needed to.   It's amazing what you can teach your body to do."

Swimming,3e01fs,ikickrobots,2,Mon Jul 20 22:27:26 2015 UTC,"Think of your lungs as two balloons inside of your body. When you take a deep breath and fill them up with air, you're able to float much easier. This is a major part of your buoyancy. When you breathe normally on your back (which most new swimmers do because their face is out of the water), you tend to fluctuate your buoyancy rapidly with the air entering and leaving your body so often. Best tip for this would be to hold as much air as you can comfortably. When your lungs tire, exhale and get a new breath quickly to maintain your position on the water.   Aside from holding your breath while floating on your back, there are three main factors that determine your posture in the pool: Chin up, chest up, hips up.  Your Chin/Hips -  Your head's position in the water determines the overall posture for what you're trying to do in the water, and is the most important part of any stroke. Your head directly affects the spine, and thus determines where your hips will lie in the water. When floating on the back, raise your chin comfortably up towards the sky, but not so far back that you're dropping your nose in the water. Your ears will need to be submerged in order for you to float easily. Try raising your chin while standing on the ground. You'll notice that your lower back will start to flex, driving your hips forward. Translating this to the pool will mean your hips will raise in the water, giving you a higher overall body position.   Your Chest -  If you broaden your shoulders, this will raise your chest very slightly in the water. This won't make or break your float. It's best to remember if anything not to bring your shoulders in towards your chest as much as possible.   People naturally float from the center of their chest, as mentioned in the first paragraph. The majority of a person's dense muscle (unless you've skipped a significant number of leg days) lies in their legs. This will cause your legs to have a slow, inevitable creep downwards in the pool. Adding a light, knee down kick with pointed toes should keep your legs from falling too far. There's no need to have a steady and continuous quick kick.  Lastly, I like to say that ""Tense muscle is dense muscle."" If you're trying to use your muscles to keep your posture high on the water, it will only hinder the ""easy"" float you're going for.   Keep your chin up, a chest full of air, and relaxed muscles, and you should be good to go!"

Swimming,3e01fs,PoemanBird,2,Tue Jul 21 23:12:04 2015 UTC,"Are your legs pretty muscular?  A lot of floating is due to your muscle-to-fat ratio.  If you have a lot of muscle on your legs and not a lot of fat, they're going to sink.  Your torso and shoulder will float, but your legs will sink.  When you're swimming you keep your legs up by kicking and keeping your stomach up."

Swimming,3dwcod,YeahItsLL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:07:07 2015 UTC,"Well, speaking from experience, you should start your pull once your movement in the water starts to change direction.  What I mean by this is after you kick, you glide underwater. Once you start going up, and not just forward, you pull. It sometimes might feel a little slow, but this has been how I've been taught and I think it's really excellent. When sprinting, I try to do everything the same, but with Hardee kicks and pulls, and further streamlines off the walls"
Swimming,3dv582,keepcalmandsleep,5,Sun Jul 19 19:50:07 2015 UTC,"Start from the flags, swim in and just flip. If you're concerned about hittint, flip early.  When I swam club, we sometimes would just stationary flip in the water to practice the motion. We'd end up doing 20 or 30 just straight flips.  For your specific fear, I'd recommend just getting comfortable with the motion then just doing it. Flip early if you need to, but spend 5 or 10 minutes each swim just swimming in from the flags and flipping."

Swimming,3dv582,reduced_uncertainty,2,Sun Jul 19 21:45:00 2015 UTC,"One interesting drill I did in Master's was with a swim ""noodle"". We took the noodle and held it at our waist with arms totally straight, while horizontal on top of the water, face down. Then, tuck your chin/head straight down and rotate your body around the noodle, keeping it stationary. You end up being face up, hands and arms straight above your head, and your body extended as if you had just pushed off the wall. Pretty much in streamline position except your hands are shoulder length apart.   You can do this drill at the flags to get the motion down, and then I'd say slowly move it in to where you just barely touch the wall with your toes in the ending streamline position. Then slowly move in until you end up flipping and hitting the wall with your feet at 90 degrees, and take a mental picture of where that is on the bottom of the pool. That way you can always know what's too far and what's too close.   Doing the noodle drill will force you to flip straight and keep your form intact, and moving slowly toward the wall will help your anxiety with the wall as you establish the motion while being in no danger of hitting until you're exactly the right distance.   Good luck! Turns can definitely be anxiety-inducing, but keep working hard and you'll be a pro soon enough!"
Swimming,3dv582,reduced_uncertainty,2,Sun Jul 19 21:36:41 2015 UTC,"Wow that is super helpful. Thank you! Just for clarification, when in the starting position the arms and hands are straight down your sides? Or are they perpendicular to the body?"
Swimming,3dv582,humma__kavula,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:44:35 2015 UTC,"Of course! I used to coach as a part time job, so I have a few tricks. Haha   For clarification, when you start, the noodle is down at your waist, as are your hands. You should have your hands at your sides, parallel to your body. When you flip, try your BEST to keep your arms straight and the noodle stationary. That'll help with your form. When you do a flip turn, you should try to do the exact same thing. Keeping your hands pointing, essentially, away from the wall at all times and rotating around them is faster than bending your arms. The static pressure from keeping your arms in place assists the flip, and then you end up on the wall with your arms basically in streamline position, just gotta put your hands together."

Swimming,3dxcro,InfiniteVirtue,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:02:56 2015 UTC,"The reason that triathletes may be wearing a pull buoy in the water is because the other two legs of the race, the biking and running, are done using the legs almost exclusively. With no buoyancy support, the Freestyle can be done with little leg movement (but leg movement none-the-less, which expends energy that's needed to be saved). If the participant is able to use a pull buoy, virtually no kicking needs to be done, if that is in fact what they were using.   I could imagine that they would use the pull buoy to preserve the energy in their legs for the bike and run portions. Best guess, though.  As for the wet suit, they are completely legal in triathlons. Wet suits work by not allowing water flow through the layer of the suit. Any water that flows into the suit from either the holes in the neck, wrists, or feet, will stay in the suit. From here, since the water is unable to leave for the most part, the body will warm up the water, and allow the body to heat up and stay warm easier. These suits are used primarily for triathlons and swimming events in the fall/winter/spring seasons, but can be used in the summer as well!"

There are plenty of sunscreens that market 'active sport' or whatever and those tend to stay applied a little better. Also, if you are like OP and are swimming a lot (who isn't in this sun right??)

Swimming,3dvycq,nolander_78,4,Sun Jul 19 23:58:53 2015 UTC,"Side stroke is the traditional ""rescue stroke"" for worn out swimmers.    From wiki:    The sidestroke is a swimming stroke, so named because the swimmer lies on one's side with asymmetric arm and leg motion[1] and it is helpful as a lifesaving technique and is often used for long-distance swimming.[2] The sidestroke allows the swimmer increased endurance because, instead of working both arms and legs simultaneously in the same way, the side stroke uses them simultaneously but differently.[2] A swimmer tired of exercising one side can turn over and use the other, the change of action helping the limbs to recover.[3]  The hands act like oars, and do not waste any power by oblique action. In ordinary swimming on the right side the left arm moves gently in the water, almost at rest.[3] Then, when the used arm when becoming tired, the swimmer turns on the other side, and the left arm works while the right arm rests.   Whenever I feel like I'm dying from going to hard I do a few laps  of breast stroke for recovery."

Swimming,3ducey,zweep,3,Sun Jul 19 15:40:39 2015 UTC,"Hey, so I think I have some pointers for you.  Basically, all swimming has the ability to put your lungs in full workout. Now lets say your someone who has mastered all strokes, which you have not. This person has proper form and background to go fast and bring high intensity (important) to all 4 strokes... therefore every stroke can properly ""stretch"" the lung as you say.   Now how exactly do they achieve that? Well they have the ability to work hard - i.e. at a high heart rate (and later muscles fatiguing) while they are restricting their oxygen intake. However with breaststroke, the amount of oxygen intake that you restrict..and thus stretch the lungs. . is limited insofar as the stroke REQUIRES you to breathe every cycle of the stroke. Compare this to freestyle where you could keep your head in the water for 3-4 full rotations of the stroke. Much more limited breathing in comparison to breaststroke.   The solution for breastroke? work on stronger walls and underwater pullouts (your push off from the wall). 1) Build up the speed into every wall to use up oxygen and 2) push extra hard off the wall, always trying to further the distance you achieve before you come up to take your first stroke. In technical terms, this is known as the ""pullout"".  In short, longer pullouts will increase the total amount of time you spend without oxygen intake. If this doesn't give you what you are looking for I definitely suggest looking into freestyle/front crawl.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ofDYZ8SICU"
Swimming,3ducey,BXPD,2,Sun Jul 19 17:43:42 2015 UTC,"Getting hands on help/coaching will always be the best way to learn a new skill. Otherwise you'll teach yourself incorrect techniques based on internet experts and likely pick up bad habits.  As for your limbs fatiguing, we'll that's a different fitness called local muscle endurance and it's pretty common to feel the pain elsewhere in the body than your heart first. The heart, you see, is not particularly easy to wear out nor feel. Pretty much any activity will get the heart and lungs going.

Decompression isn't really an issue if you are staying down deep for short periods of time under ~40 feet or so. That device doesn't look like it would have enough air to keep you down very long.  If you go to a scuba shop you can buy mini air tanks with a breather connected on top that are safer than this homemade device. If I recall correctly they are safe to around 20-30 feet. These devices are still very unsafe and should not be used in the place of scuba equipment. Worst case scenario, you exhale and go to inhale and uh oh no more air... Devices like these don't have a visible air pressure gauge, to help you plan your decent.   This is all off the top of my head, so if you are considering doing this, please do more research."

Additionally if you take it down to any kind of depth, you'd get less.  For example, if you took it down to 6m you'd get nothing because the water pressure around you would equal 10 psi.

There is an actual swimming coach that write practices out based on your needs and wants. Do you want to swim just for fitness? Are you training for a triathlon? Do you want to compete in swim meets? All of these things are possible or not it all up to you. But the main benefit of joining a masters group is having that coach there to help you correct your form and provide those work outs for you. You can swim laps all day long and get your heart rate going but as far as working out all of your muscles properly and avoiding injury to yourself is a different story.   Usms.org  Go to local programs tab and type in your information. These will be all of the masters groups you can join in your area."

Swimming is a fantastic exercise that you can do well into old age, but it is a technical sport.  Formal instruction will take you a long way, making it more enjoyable and effective.  In my opinion, a 25 ft pool is really only good enough to teach the truly inexperienced how to swim.  An adult will just reach the end of the pool too quickly to be effective.  I saw that somebody suggested a harness to hold you in place, but to me that sounds unpleasant.  I would echo others in suggesting that you find a local masters group to swim with, or if you need to first get some more personal coaching with a stroke clinic.  If you contact your local team, somebody should be able to point you in the right direction if you can communicate your skill level and goals.  You can search for a local chapter here:  https://www.usms.org/  Truly learning to swim is an investment and a journey, but well worth it in my opinion."

Swimming,3dsm62,lolzerdidoodle,3,Sun Jul 19 02:11:24 2015 UTC,"Oh hell no. I was expecting you to be like 50+ from the title. 22 is basically your physical prime. Your body has really no age related defects so the only limits are your current fitness level and willingness to work hard.   Actually I really think the biggest limit to going from 0 to elite athlete (as someone who has drifted out of shape and back to very much in shape several times) is injury.   At your age if you have a pretty good grasp of your body you'll pick up technique faster than a kid would, so if you just focus on fitness by the time you reach your peak you'll probably have the technique to go with it, provided you have a good coach.   Which brings me back to injury. If you can get to training 8 or 9 times a week and maintain that for 2-3 years you will be an elite athlete. But consistency is really crucial. For any time you take off (for injury or whatever) it takes about triple that time to get back to the level of fitness you were at. And that's why you can't take more than one day off a week. But you still need one day off to recover enough to keep going. Basically everyone follows this 6/7 schedule. But you should start really slow with like 30 minutes a day, work up to hour long workouts, and eventually start throwing in doubles spaced out through the week.   All of this should get covered again by your coach if you go for this, but I wanted to give you basically an idea of how much work it will take to have a chance at the Pan American Games or equivalent."
Swimming,3dsm62,backer100,2,Sun Jul 19 03:54:07 2015 UTC,"All you said is very helpful, good advice. I am gonna take it in mind. A few minutes ago I watched an inspiring video about a guy who went to the Olympics, but he didn't know how to swim very well..basically nothing is impossible. I've a club in mind, maybe I am gonna take 2 or 3 days lessons per week (cause it is expensive to take more than 3 days), about one hour of training. (actually I am gonna analyse if I can take 5 days [for a low price], and start my training and lessons slow) I am gonna be careful to avoid injuries.

I've seen people who had never swam competitively before join a club and go from a decently talented JV swimmer to winning state's in the 50 free.   With a focused mind, a focused heart and undying will you can achieve anything you want. That being said in order to do so, you may have to sacrifice other things, but as I said if you want it that bad the returns will be worth the cost.  To start, always look at fundamentals. In swimming they are drag reduction and propulsion. Learn how to travel flat on the water (float and keep a straight line) then introduce proper propulsion on those straight lines (good kicking and pulling). Videos are out there, its up to you to apply and see which one is right or wrong. Ask and be a student and never stop learning."

I may be wrong though.   Edit: also see here under prelims-finals   The fastest six or eight (Championship Heat) swimmers, and the next fastest six or eight swimmers (Consolation Heat) return in the evening to compete in the Finals. A swimmer who has qualified in the Consolation Finals may not place in the Championship Finals even if their finals time would place them so. The converse also applies."
Swimming,3dr91o,demuni,2,Sat Jul 18 18:17:41 2015 UTC,"as others have said, you can't get first from the B final. The reasoning behind this is to prevent people from not trying their hardest in prelims."
Swimming,3dr91o,isosceleseyebrows,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:36:51 2015 UTC,"Swimmers in the A final can only place from 1st-8th, and swimmers in the B final can only place 9th-16th. The places can of course vary depending on however many are allowed per final, but you cannot move out of your final once it has been swam. Somebody in the B final cannot move up to 1st-8th in the A final, nor down to 17th-24th in the C final or beyond if there is one.  This brings about the phrase my team has used, ""golden ticket,"" whereupon a swimmer gets seeded last into a final, effectively creating a scenario where they have nothing to lose and everything to gain. They could drop the hammer and take 1st from the outside lane, or suck and just retain their 8th/16th seed for those points.  Likewise, and I don't think we have a name for this, but being seeded 1st or 9th is basically the worst. You have everything to lose, or have to be on top of your game to retain those points you're seeded to acquire.  The only way to move up is if somebody seeded in the A final is DQ'd from prelims or scratches the race, which would reseed the event and cause 9th seed to move to 8th, or up however many spaces there are vacant in the A final. However, if a swimmer in the A final is DQ'd, NS (no show), or DFS (declares false start), then nobody will get 8th place. With only 7 swimmers left in the A final, they take 1st-7th, and the B final still goes 9th-16th (unless this scenario happens here too).  Some examples of fun stuff happening in this regard:  -I got seeded 9th in the 100 breast at my conference meet by .2, which mad me a little ticked. So in the B final I destroyed everyone by dropping more time, swimming a time that would have been 7th in the A final. Of course I was locked into the B final. To make matters more irritating but hilarious, one of the A swimmers DQ'd, leaving 8th place open. Effectively I lost out on 2 places because of a fingernail .2 second in prelims and being locked into the B final.  -A more hilarious example is that at Pan Pacifics last year, Lochte got locked into the B final of the 200 IM because he was the 3rd seeded American after prelims (which only allows 2 swimmers per nation to compete in the final). So he ended up swimming 1:56.02 to destroy the B final, and tie Hagino who won the A final with the same time. Meanwhile, Phelps not only didn't get to race Lochte head-to-head, but also lost to him by .02 from another heat (Phelps was 1:56.04)."

Swimming,3dqyfo,jrl999,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:11:04 2015 UTC,"I've been over this at length with my hairdresser.   The best thing is preventative- soak your hair in water (really saturate it) before you swim, then put your cap on immediately when it's wet.  The water will fill up the hair shaft so the chlorine won't permeate as much and therefore when you swim it won't do as much damage.  After you're done, when you take the cap off, do a long rinse again.   After your long rinse, add lots of conditioner.  If you're not going anywhere (work/school) leave some of the conditioner in.  Also add a handful of this stuff, working it through from the roots and concentrating on the tips.  I've basically stopped shampooing except 1x a week, just doing a thorough rinse and then adding conditioner.  I also do this deep conditioning mask once a week.   I don't have amazing hair or anything, but I swim 6x a week and it looks pretty decent following these steps.  My hair on the left."

Running and body weight exercises are great for weight loss and muscle tone.   I would say hop on a treadmill and run a (few) mile(s) and mix in some incline work. Then try your best with pushups, sit ups, squats, and pull ups (rep till failure).

The rest of the time, when you're swimming, you should be continually rotating your core. You only rotate it up like 2 inches more to take a breath. So to answer your actual question, you should be kicking your breathing leg down as you rotate back. It's a simultaneous movement.  Remember that to breathe, you really only want one goggle out of the water. That will help you to not over-rotate.  edited for awful grammar."

Swimming,3dhj5z,LoneSwimmer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:53:08 2015 UTC,"Double cap. Cap, then goggles, then cap. If starting in a wave, and not expecting or looking for an race time, allow the start wave 10 seconds to start before you. This will take you out of the inevitable aggressive melee. Before you start in the water, make sure you know where the finish is. Then find a building or landmark as high above it as possible on the skyline to aim for. My understanding of the distance and current assistance is per your link. I would not change any training for this, and tapering is mostly unnecessary. However for your last few days drops your distance while maintaining intensity. Take the day before off. Do NOT try to carb load the day beforehand. Beginners feels the need to do this as they often believe triatheletes but it is also unnecessary and will make you feel heavy. Hydrate sufficiently beforehand. Don't forget to have fun."

It's hard transitioning from something you do with a support system, to doing by yourself.  Here's the thing about swimming / generally exercising: nobody is really paying attention to you, as they are focused on their own swim or workout. As long as you are following the ""etiquette"" (as in, choosing the appropriate lane for your speed) nobody is going to bat an eye at what you are doing, even if you are the slowest or have wonky form.

Swimming,3ddzcn,zetsui,6,Wed Jul 15 15:04:37 2015 UTC,I'm pretty new myself but I'll repeat what I've heard which makes sense to me.  Bilateral breathing from the start will make it easier to develop a symmetrical stroke so will lead to better technique in the end.
Swimming,3ddzcn,thumb0,3,Wed Jul 15 15:12:36 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on what your goals are.  I agree with the advice that breathing to both sides as a newbie will make it easier in the future, and is helpful if you are looking to really perfect your stroke and develop an efficient technique. I definitely grew up with coaches requiring me to breathe to both sides on a lot of sets.  However, that was back when I was swimming for best times with an eventual eye towards national meets. Now that I am adult who swims for fitness, I almost never breathe to my right. I don't really care about shaving a few tenths off my free time or having the most balanced stroke. If you are just trying to stay in shape, I don't see the reason to force yourself to breathe bilaterally but maybe I shouldn't say that based on the fact that I dont have much issue breathing to my right - I just choose not to.  As for the cap, I don't even seen the reason for one at practice even if you have hair (assuming it is not long hair). To me, caps serve two purposes - keeping the hair out of your eyes and/or reduce drag when you are in a race. Only advantage for bald men I could see is preventing sunburn if you are swimming outside."
Swimming,3ddzcn,Braeburn_Drive,2,Wed Jul 15 19:36:39 2015 UTC,you should learn to breed left and right it makes your stoke more efficent and you faster breathing from only the left also only works out half of the muscles  also... wearing a swim cap will help by covering your ears and making you a little faster but not much
Swimming,3ddzcn,Dringus0531,2,Wed Jul 15 18:47:37 2015 UTC,"Breath bilaterally. It is is the right training technique, if you want to actually swim better it is worth the effort to train correctly."
Swimming,3ddzcn,gluver,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:30:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with the others that bilateral breathing is better and learning something right the first time is ultimately easier than having to re-learn like I did (I used to breathe only on the right side). Something I did when I was needing to breathe more frequently was 3 breaths right, then 3 breaths left. Many of the same benefits without having to hold my breath for as long. Eventually, it became longer as I got fitter. And yes, it's hard at first to adjust to the other side (it was my left side that was tricky for me), but it was a good thing ultimately. Practice really did help.  Also, as a fellow bald guy, I wear a swim cap and I find it more comfortable. I don't know that it helps all that much since I don't have drag due to hair, but it feels good for me, so I do it."
Swimming,3ddzcn,nomadicbrownbear,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:35:31 2015 UTC,"Ansolutely! I've been swimming for 10 years now competitively, and have competed at the national level.  I've been working on fixing my breathing, as before I would pick a side and breath to it…thought this still works both sides, when I would get tired, I'd breath to my right side almost exclusively. Because, my right side is more developed.  Breathing bilaterally can help your stroke be more efficient and symmetrical, so I'd recommend practice with that"
Swimming,3ddzcn,Mlezer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:33:43 2015 UTC,"Bilateral breathing also demands that you always breath with a pattern that can be too long for some individuals.  If it is kept to every 3 strokes one shouldn't have too much of a problem, especially while just learning.  If a coach or someone sees that you aren't very smooth and symmetrical due to one sided breathing then it is good to incorporate it into your technique.  Many swimmers are fine on one side and feel very awkard breathing to their weak or nondominant side.  If one gets into open water situations, environmental conditions such as tide, wave action, wind, blinding sunlight would necessitate being able to breath comfortably from either side.  Not mandatory but recommended."
Swimming,3ddzcn,pdigirol,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:03:03 2015 UTC,When I start up swimming after a long period I tend to do one side one lap and alternate onto the other side on the next.  It has to do more with getting my breathing pattern down.  After a few days I would go three stroke per breath.  Seems to help.

Unless they last three or four times longer than $20 Vanquishers, why bother? I am on year three of my current pair, with the original strap.   But you get in your own way with the ""rubes"" comment.

Swimming,3dadn6,bugchild9,3,Tue Jul 14 19:32:26 2015 UTC,"My times are pretty much exactly the same as yours lol. I swim, run cross country, and do track. As somebody else said, go for distance! Swimming is an endurance sport, so go for the endurance races. I've been running since 7th grade as well as swimming and I feel like the sports compliment each other very well. As for training, just run every day. Aim for 3 miles to start with or just a timed run of about 20-25 minutes and never stop running. I don't care if you're going at walking pace, but keep those legs movin'! Throw in a couple of faster workouts like mile splits (run a mile fast, take a break, run another mile fast) and you should see that mile time drop pretty fast. Also, if you're going to be serious about running track, good distance spikes help a ton! I use Saucony Velocity 5s and they're awesome. Overall, keeping a consistent workout with a lot of mileage should get your times down pretty low. That's what I've always done and I just broke 5:00 on my mile at the end of last season (woot woot). Don't be discouraged if you don't see progress right away. It's a pretty slow progress, but by the beginning of track season I guarantee you'll be below that 6:00 minute mile."

Swimming,3dagd5,TygrTygrBrningBrght,2,Tue Jul 14 19:28:02 2015 UTC,"I've torn my PCL, and had an MCL injury (though not a tear), and done just fine, with some caveats.  When I got my injury, I was on my high-school's swim team.  It put me out for about 3 months (thankfully not during swim season), but I was still able to swim competitively without much problem for the rest of my high-school career.  That said - it was a SLOG to get back to pre-injury range-of-motion and speed.  And now, almost 15 years later, I get serious pains whenever I do breast stroke kick, or extended kick workouts.    Just some advice - don't slack on your PT, and pay attention to your body.  If something hurts, it's hurting for a reason.  Try and mitigate it as much as possible, since you could very well be headed towards long term arthritis.  And, since I'm not a doctor, listen to your phyical therapist and your doctor; your situation might be wildly different than mine.  Best of luck."

Ended up being an 18 month lay off as I am a breaststroker and it took me that long to get to the point I could kick without risking another injury (partly due to me being lazy with my physio as I wasn't sure at the time if I wished to continue swimming).

Swimming,3d8jp8,zetsui,10,Tue Jul 14 09:59:09 2015 UTC,"One thing you could practice is just floating in shallower water. There is fundamentally no difference in swimming in deep water and shallow water, it is simply psychological. By reenforcing that you do float in water, transitioning to the deep end will hopefully be less stressful as you will recognize that your natural position in the water is at the surface."
Swimming,3d8jp8,jamincan,2,Tue Jul 14 12:34:27 2015 UTC,"The key is not to panic. You WILL float with no or very little effort. If you go underwater, you will naturally rise to the surface where you can breathe again. Practice in the shallow end until you're comfortable. I had similar worries last year when I went from beginners to intermediate, but within a couple of months I was swimming and floating in the Pacific Ocean about 300 yards out, with no floor nearby and nothing to grab on. I'm still alive :)"
Swimming,3d8jp8,InstantArcade,3,Tue Jul 14 18:29:32 2015 UTC,"http://www.drownproofing.com/Drownproofingsequence.htm It really is psychological.  It doesn't matter how much water is below you.

Swimming,3d8jp8,Liederkranz,0,Tue Jul 14 10:24:51 2015 UTC,"You can use fins for breaststroke, but just do fly kick or flutter kick - it's a great drill to make your breaststroke better.

Swimming,3d8jp8,CptanPanic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:52:31 2015 UTC,The thing is...the problem. is that I might drown doing that. There is no 'intermediate' between 5 feet and 9 feet. If somethign goes wrong it could spell disaster.
Swimming,3d8jp8,coopseypoopsey,3,Tue Jul 14 12:55:10 2015 UTC,"Something you could request from your instructor or a guard is to stick a shepherds  hook all the way to the bottom. You can slide up and down it to get comfortable, knowing there is something to guide you back to the top if you begin to panic or can't get all the way to the bottom.   Panicking is the only thing that will actually really do you in. You need confidence and that will come with more practice. Also tell your instructor about your worries so they are teaching you more practical skills than just the strokes.   Edit: other ways you can push your comfort level where you feel safe: sitting on the bottom of the pool in the 5' area, doing somersaults in the water, etc. These may help you get used to the feeling of water being all around you. You may even want to try doing front and back floats, snorking up a bit of water and getting used to reacting to that in a calm way because it will happen to you irl. Good luck! You are doing a brave thing facing your fears as an adult."
Swimming,3d8jp8,coopseypoopsey,2,Tue Jul 14 13:29:18 2015 UTC,"One other suggestion: basically everyone you see who is comfortable swimming has been goofing around in the water since they were little kids. It's amazing how dedicated you are to practicing, but maybe also give yourself some time to enjoy the water too. Go to the lake or public swim with some friends and have a blast. You don't have to go outside your comfort zone, there is plenty you can do while being able to touch the bottom: floating on floaties, tossing a ball or frisbee around, crawling around on your stomach in the really shallow areas, splashing, diving for sinking rings, going on the water slide. These are all things that you can do in 5' or shallower water. You'll have fun and you'll move around in the water in ways you wouldn't do otherwise, which will make you overall more comfortable and a better swimmer."
Swimming,3d8jp8,coopseypoopsey,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:29:42 2015 UTC,"I love it. I am very comfortable man. In fact I am so comfortable sometimes I even try to breathe under water by natural comfort sometimes. It is amazing. I also like exhausting myself a little because I noticed how normal my sleep pattern became after swimming. I feel exhausteda nd sleep like a baby...and I'm an insomniac!  I take a few days off here and there. Once you learn what body part needs to be up and focus more on your shoulders/hips/elbow placement, all the strokes seem to be coming easy. I actually signed up for 10 lessons, but at 1 a week and the July 4 weekend off, I think I might just stop at 5 because I can watch videos (made 15 pages of notes) and gradually improve myself later with a trainer.  The only thing I would need help with MAYBE is treading water on the deep end. And why I ask. I have two pools, one with a deep end (75m) and one 25m which is 5foot that I have been practicing in a lot  I just wunder whether sculling+the flutter kick or switching into front crawl is going to cut the transition."
Swimming,3d8jp8,Sobersam,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:32:10 2015 UTC,The kick you will want to look into is called the eggbeater for treading water.
Swimming,3d8jp8,HoodedGryphon,3,Tue Jul 14 14:53:20 2015 UTC,"How tall are you? I'm 6'4"" and I can tread in the 5 foot area. When I teach swim lessons one of the first things we teach them is how to float on your back. Whether you get tired or just scared you can quickly roll on your back and float to relax. You're correct normal flippers should not be used during breaststroke. Just keep swimming and spend as much time in the water as possible. Keep in mind that any time in the water is good whether you're swimming laps or just playing."
Swimming,3d8jp8,HoodedGryphon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:45:45 2015 UTC,5'10. The deepest the pool goes is 4'6. My feet would have to be REALLY outwards (as opposed to more underneath you) to learn to scull/eggbeater in 4'6 for the deep end.

Swimming,3d5055,thumb0,2,Mon Jul 13 15:58:19 2015 UTC,"Is there any benefit to doing a sidestroke in a survival situation? I always felt that sidestroke was taught mainly because it's simpler and easier (technique wise) than the more common strokes. Does it use less energy? There isn't increased visibility from this stroke, so that can't be it. I might be biased because I'm a breastroker, but I feel that a combination of a backstroke (to cruise along with unlimited air supply) and breastroke (to see ahead) would work pretty well in a survival situation."
Swimming,3d5055,tangbang,2,Mon Jul 13 21:14:04 2015 UTC,"From what I read about the CSS they say that: - it's very efficient - works well with clothes and boots on as well as fins  - easy to breathe in chop and swell - can switch sides if you're tired - pretty good visibility - stealthy  I don't know how much emphasis they put on stealth. Obviously that's important for a special ops person, not at all for survival so maybe there are better strokes for survival.    I'm sort of an intermediate swimmer and at this point I could definitely swim side stroke farther and longer than any of the other strokes even though I've put less time into practicing it than the others.  I suppose this may be very different for experienced swimmers."

The scissor kick isn't exactly what rotates you, it is bringing the leg up and bringing the arm back up, that puts you flat.  I watched this video"
Swimming,3d5055,planet_x69,2,Mon Jul 13 17:00:46 2015 UTC,And he's using his core to rotate as well.   I my experience the NSCSS isnt really a great side stroke to use for survival. You can actually use other forms of side stroke that are far easier to learn and just as effective with less movement and more rest per stroke that are more glide based.

I let it run its course and heal and I pushed on with swimming.   Now I'm 7+ months in and no more shoulder pain that stays with me after the pool.

It is not normal to develop shoulder pain on any side. I personally had shoulder pain (both sides) due to making too much use of the flexibility of my arms during butterfly. Always keep your head at the same level or slightly above your arms when moving your arm simultaneously to the front. Make sure you push your shoulder blades together when lifting your arms over the water, allowing for an easier lift. Going to the gym to improve your arm and shoulder strength, and core stability exercises in general (e.g. planking) help with this. The gym will also allow you to become more explosive as well."

Swimming,3d5jwe,soundkite,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:08:35 2015 UTC,"If you were to develop shoulder pain when only breathing to one side it is much more likely that you develop it in the opposite shoulder than side you are breathing towards. When you take your breath and leave your hand out in front, try to notice if that hand begins to scull in the water instead of staying anchored. This caused me a lot of inflammation back when I swam."

Then I kick in and engage my legs and go more and more hard until I'm done with my kick set.    Also, I do a third world squat before and after my swim for 2-3 minutes.  It engages the front calf muscles and stretches out the back, since I've been doing that I haven't gotten cramps nearly as bad."
Swimming,3d3i5i,adchrom,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:54:01 2015 UTC,"Cramps happen because your muscles are no longer used to the movement, although your body still remembers it.  Personally, I do vertical kicks (e.g. arms crossed over chest, 1 minute butterfly kick, 15s butterfly kick with arms straight up in the air, repeat for 4x. Easier with freestyle kick actually). Vertical kicks force you to really use your hips when kicking (much surface, much propulsion), instead of relying on the bending of your knees (less surface, less propulsion)."
Swimming,3d3i5i,swimtech,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:13:48 2015 UTC,"being overall more hydrated should help prevent cramping. Before workout have a snack with potassium such as a banana or even potatoes.

Personally, I would say to stay with what and who you are most comfortable with and who you think you have the best relationship with. However, as a developing swimmer, it's good to be flexible with trying new ideas or (and more to my point) thinking of aspects that you could attribute to progressing your stroke. Perhaps your summer coach has a point, and he feels you can get more out of your pull. That doesn't mean you have to take the wide strokes that he telling you to or change your stroke dramatically, but perhaps you could ask the coach to help you focus on doing drills or strength conditioning to help lengthen, strengthen, and/or quicken your natural stroke.  And like X-StreetCred_X said, respectfully communicate with your summer coach your concern and try to use it to create a dialogue to brainstorm different ideas together."

Any deviation from your established technique is going to feel unnatural at first. Remember, your coach has a different vantage point of your stroke and can see things that you can't.   That being said, I'd recommend getting more information before dismissing the advice entirely. Ask your coach for further insight about why he feels you should change it and also explain your hesitation to heed his advice."

Breakfast on meet-day is just as usual, depending on when the meet is (morning, early afternoon, late afternoon), but no funky stuff that throws me off balance. Don't drink a ton of sugar (e.g. sports drink) right before swimming, it will give you a dip during the activity. 1-2 hours before should be fine though.  Best of luck :)"

Don't even try fly or breastroke besides basic drills. Also learn to push off the wall with your good leg until you are better. For dryland try some flutter kicking from the HIPS if it doesn't hurt your knee. Now would also be a good time to do lots of yoga, core,work and stretching. Also try working on your technique so you know that you're doing at least somthing better. And if you can't get In the water look into resistance bands.

Swimming,3cyi0g,bradmont,18,Sat Jul 11 23:45:18 2015 UTC,"I think that actually is freestyle. In USAS at least the only real rules are you can't touch the bottom, lane lines, or your opponents. I've done 500 freestyles all butterfly for instance and it was legal. Just not very fast.   And that's why everyone does the same thing, it's widely agreed upon to be the fastest way to swim.   I'd love to see some local meets do some ""anything but front crawl"" events though, that would be fun.   Edit: Oh right, and the 15m mark kickout rule. Which I think is in place to prevent people passing out trying to do what lochte did for the 100 etc. I'm pretty sure you could do one butterfly pull or something in the middle of the pool and kick everything else underwater and that would suddenly be legal. Pretty sure."

If I were you I would not scratch any of the water practices for gym. Simply add gym practice on top, really. If that is too expensive then start doing your exercise at home. It is not that hard. All you need to do to generally get more powerful are pushups and pullups :).  Also if you do more sessions, eat more. It is essential to get more muscular and yeah (personal opinion) but cut the bullshit whey. In like 4 years we will all be looking back at the current supplement hype and ask ourselves WTF we did. Just go ahead and make yourself a banana peanut smoothy or something. Same price, more jummy and garuanteed protein as supposed to wonder powder.  As for the meet in 1 1/2 weeks, there is not alot you can do but get comfortable with the pool. You will not be getting any faster or stronger till that point but you can get your mindset in a positive place. Go to that pool and do some starts. Also sleep well before the meet. Start drinking more now. Get your hydration up and eat clean.  Take a blanket and food to the meet so you dont starve etc and have fun with it :)"
Swimming,3cx3d8,maexen,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:29:43 2015 UTC,thx for the advice... hmm so if i do not scratch water practices. Then are u suggesting i use my saturdays for another gym sessions?

Swimming,3cx3d8,maexen,2,Mon Jul 13 03:37:25 2015 UTC,"Not an expert in sports science but the opinions on recovery vary drastically. For swimming, one day of recovery per week is all you need. Some clubs even swim twice a day. So I think it will be fine :).  Embrace the swimming lifestyle of not knowing how your body feels being not sore :D (jk) if you only do 3 water and 2 gym sessions you can pretty much not do alot of harm to yourself."

They also however have dryland sessions (gym or body weight exercises) like twice or thrice a week. So i was thinking that mayb i should change my thursdays to a gym session. So i would be swimming for 3 days straight followed by 2 days of gymming."

On my last team we did a training trip to Puerto Rico and we had a day that we spent in the city running, doing beach ""yoga"", and doing an hour to 1 1/2 hour practice. Swim with the waves not against them, stay close enough that if you get caught in a tide and have to swim out of it you won't exhaust your self before you're free, have something that you're swimming towards and every other breath you take make sure to pop your head up and look at it, and have fun"

Most beaches have buoys marking out a safe area that boats aren't allowed into. But given that it's Italy, you never know. Don't venture out of that area, jet skis, powerboats and idiots are a bad mix.  You can definitely get a good workout. Swim five minutes easy, five hard etc...

Also I saw a chiropractor which I was skeptical about but it helped immediately. If you have that option I seriously recommend it!

Probably could find a cheap plastic one at a second hand store that would hold up sitting pool side. (I've never tried it)  I use patterns on a analog pace clock and could usually get my age group swimmers to pick up on the patterns when I coach. For  Instance  If I give them a set of 12 x 50 Kick, leaving on a 1:15 interval. They start when the clock is at 00:00 Seconds (Doesn't really matter, but keeps it easier frame of reference).  Repeat Number 1, 5, 9 Leave when seconds hand is 00 Repeat Number 2, 6, 10 Leave when Seconds hand is :15 Repeat Number 3, 7, 11 Leave when second hand is :30 Repeat Number 4, 8, 12 Leave when second hand is :45  Sometimes this can get a bit screwy, but if you are writing your own workouts you can set intervals appropriately.

Sip on it, take it in slow for the :30 minutes before practice. Then drink another liter throughout the practice if you can.  Seriously though about ""eating before practice""... keep it light and natural if you're going to even be doing it. Banana with some peanutbutter and a granola bar would be the maximum I'd do.

Each gear isn't just about different effort, but you should also be able to vary your stroke accordingly. I have a different stroke timing for every gear, for the most part.  For all-out sprinting, one hand is entering the same time the other is exiting the water. This is the least efficient but most powerful timing, while timing closer to a half ""catch-up"" stroke is more efficient, but less powerful. If you're interested, I suggest looking into Hip-Driven, Body-driven, and Shoulder-driven strokes. The 200m LC should be mostly hip and body driven."
Swimming,3cre6x,Ijnekono,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:53:39 2015 UTC,"I was taught to start out by finding the pace that is consistent with the time I want to get. You can find this during practice beforehand.  Do the first lap a  bit faster than what is necessary, try to keep it up for the second lap, go all out on the third lap since your body will be wearing out, and then it's the final lap so go all out with what's left.  In your terms:  1st 50: Lower tempo sprint  2nd 50: Lower tempo sprint  3rd 50: sprint  4th 50: sprint  *Your terms don't allow for the same pacings that I would use, so like another user said try to develop multiple 'effort levels'."
Swimming,3cre6x,jet27,4,Fri Jul 10 06:52:43 2015 UTC,"Here's how I swim it, and it works for me. I try to kick as little as possible on the first 50, letting my adrenaline carry me through my first 100 without expending too much energy. The middle 50s are very crucial, as its when people slow down, so I start kicking harder at the start of the second half of the race. The last 50 is when I go all out with my legs and breathe as little as possible."
Swimming,3cre6x,JDaddy6969,3,Fri Jul 10 04:57:28 2015 UTC,"Do not hammer the legs from the start. It doesn't matter how fit you are. You will fall off. You could be in better shape aerobically than Tianna Gregory is sexually, and you will live free and die hard. What I'm trying to say is having the same intensity in your kick that you would use in a 50 or 100 free, or even a 200 free yards in the 200 free LC is not going to bode well. You will fall off hard the back half of the swim. No way around it. Unless you are an anomaly and are some incomprehensible leg dominant freestyler (which for all I know you could be, but it is pretty unlikely) the last 80-120 meters of your swim will hurt almost as much as when you're first true love leaves you for that asshole Jeremy. So, this begs the answer to the question, ""How do I approach kicking in a 200 free?"" Well, I'll give you some generic advice that is kinda a very common way to go after the swim.  I'm going to assume that when you sprint (50, 100 free, last 50 of free of any race) you have a 6 beat kick. That's typically what most age group swimmers have when they sprint. So throughout your 200 free, try and maintain that 6 beat kick all the way through the swim. The common approach though, is to build it in intensity. So if we imagine your kick is a 6 speed gearbox, with 6th gear being a falcon kick on the intensity spectrum, and a 1st being as intense as a lukewarm glass of tap water, start your swim with your legs in 5th. Stay in 5th with regards to your legs until you get to 100. When you push off to start the 3rd 50 of your race, your legs should be at the upper end of 5th, almost shifting into 6th. And then as soon as you hit that last turn, you ride the pure adrenaline and explosive fire your legs posses and you kick harder than a 2000 dollar sub in the back of a 500 dollar Civic.  Easy speed, or ""90 percent stuff"" is a tricky skill to pick up, and chances are you won't just find your controlled speed casually during meet warm up. Being able to take out a race controlled yet quick is a tough thing to learn. However, some good buzz words to think of may help you out, are ""Strong"" or ""Long"" or ""relaxed"". The concept of easy speed, is that basically you want to go as quick as possible, while using the least amount of energy possible. In a typical well split 200 free, it should start to begin to pinch around 50-70 meters. So you want to be engaged in ""easy speed"" until it starts to hurt. That's when you put on your big boy pants, buckle up, and get ready for a minute and 30 seconds of hurting. At this point, you'll want to start to build your stroke rate, and build the intensity of your kick as I previously mentioned, all while maintaining long powerful strokes. Your stroke rate should increase every 50, while of course trying to maintain stroke length.  Finally, split wise, your 1st 50 should always be your fastest. Typically by 2-3ish seconds compared to your 2nd 50, which should then be the second fastest. Your 3rd fifty should be marginally slower than your 2nd 50, and your final 50 should fall in between your 2nd and 4th 50. Ideally those last 3 50's should only be separated by less than a second with regards to the fastest and slowest of the three. If you're looking for ideal splits, talk to your coach, or look online for split charts that you can match to your goal time. Or you can look at the splits of world class 200 freestylers and see how they approach the swim.  Hope this helps. All the best homie"
Swimming,3cre6x,Super_Pie_Man,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:04:16 2015 UTC,"The reason you can just go balls to the wall in the 200yd is because your body knows how long that race is. I guess you train yards in the winter and do some LCM for three months in the summer, right? My suggestion is to a bunch of fast 200 LCM on like the 5min. Over the weeks, your muscles will learn how to race it."

Swimming,3cre6x,Valentulous,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:40:01 2015 UTC,"My strategy for 200 LCM was 75 stretch (yes, about mid pool switch gears) going out not slow or necessarily holding back, but emphasized stroke length and swimming light, 50 build up speed/effort through the turn at the start end into a 75 full effort with making the last sprint push for the final 25 meters.   It's a very, hard race because it's just that much longer than a 200 scy. We would do a lot of 225 and 250y repeats to train for 200 LCM to build tolerance as we only had access to a scy pool"
Swimming,3cre6x,Based_Panda,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:00:23 2015 UTC,I've always swam it LCM first 50m easy speed then build the middle hundred and sprint the last 50m. The key is getting your pace right on the first 50m.

Swimming,3cre6x,elcalrissian,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:07:17 2015 UTC,"200 free LCM should be swam at a slightly higher intensity than the other 200s, but in my 200s (other than IM) I always think of it as   1st 50: Easy Speed (you want to be travelling fast at minimum effort). 2nd 50: Build (you want to feel like you are building the whole way through and hit the turn at the speed you want to hold through the third 50). 3rd 50: Power (hold your DPS and pace from the end of 2nd 50: most important 50 of the race as it sets the tone for your back end). 4th 50: Sprint.  I follow these in pretty much all my 200s bar the IM. I have only just scraped sub 2:00 in the 200 free though so I am far from the best person for 200 free advice."
Swimming,3cs7dv,SwimmerSchirmer,6,Fri Jul 10 10:10:20 2015 UTC,"Sprint fist drill. Helps me out when I need some extra hand speed. Also know that the shorter the race, the less you need to catch all the water. For a mile swim I'm feeling the water as much as I can and pull on every ounce I can catch. In the 200 I'll feel the catch then rip the pull. For a 50 it is 100% rip: I get my hand from point A to point B as fast as I can.   For any reader other than OP, ripping only works if you trust your muscle memory is strong enough. If a non-competitive swimmer tries to rip that water, all that will happen is the dropping of the elbows and a super weak pull."
Swimming,3cs7dv,Super_Pie_Man,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:11:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you're used to a long, nice pace, don't go out tomorrow and bash your arms as fast as you can. Slowly increase your tempo until you see fit."
Swimming,3cs7dv,cuberoot328509,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:47:32 2015 UTC,"The first paragraph was for the OP and readers in a similar situation; a 23s 50 LCM is still pretty fast. I doubt he did that with a long nice pace. The second part was for the non-elite swimmers that still need to worry about technique rather than hand speed. In an all out sprint, it should feel almost like you are bashing your arms any way. I find that doing build sets doesn't help my hand speed, it can be hard to change the stroke like that. No-breath sprint do feel very different to even the fastest breath-every-three stroke. I've seen natural sprinters be able to build into a good no-breath sprint, but not so much the ones learning that stroke."
Swimming,3cs7dv,Super_Pie_Man,3,Mon Jul 13 23:44:54 2015 UTC,"I am a huge fan of a tempo trainer drills. My tempo for a 50 free is between 47-51.   A huge help has been to do 15 meter ""blasts"" (push off the wall and pop right up, no underwater at all), start with 65 then 62, 59,56,54,52,50,48,46,44,42 basically until you can't hold that tempo for the entire 15 meters.

Swimming,3cs7dv,Super_Pie_Man,2,Mon Jul 13 23:49:45 2015 UTC,"It takes a lot of work to increase your stroke rate for a 200 free. The way I did it was by lifting, since I figured the best way to improve your stroke rate is to get stronger.  You can also try using fins in practice to allow for simulating race-pace turnover. Since you hardly ever practice as fast as you race, your practice stroke rate is also slower, so fins, by raising your body position/providing a stronger kick, help you achieve the turnover you want.  Hope that helps!"

Swimming,3cogjz,Chrisnonfer,3,Thu Jul 9 20:49:31 2015 UTC,"Would suggest isolating the dolphin kick and working on that, focussing on getting the kick more of an undulation of the body, and less of a kick from the knee. Once you feel like you're making more progress with that, or once you get some more feedback, reintroduce the arms and try to keep the undulation going, getting the flow going in Fly is an amazing feeling."

Swimming,3cogjz,conjunctionjunction1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:40:57 2015 UTC,You would benefit from doing two kicks with each pull. You want to kick when your hands enter the water and at the bottom of your pull. The kick at the bottom will help you get yours arms back in front. Not to mention more kicking means youll go faster.
Swimming,3cogjz,TriHack,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:33:08 2015 UTC,"Hey, not sure about your swimming history or your goals, but you have a solid beginning to your fly technique here. Keep up the good work. A lot of people are commenting on your kick, but just like your catch, I think it's a secondary focus for now.  There's lots of stuff going on, and fly is a short-axis stroke (like breast), so everything is interconnected and difficult to address a la carte. First, forget about your arms. Let them and your kick stay the same for now and just be driven by the differences you are needing to make with your hips and chest. The goal is to get your hips up. To do this, focus on driving your chest down during your catch further than you currently are (your back will arch a tad more and you'll press your upper body downward). This will naturally drive your hips up and make your kick more effective. It will also make you faster, but tire you out quicker.   Try that out and see how it feels/looks. I'd suggest 25's at first at 85% pace with good rest. Mix in some 1-armed drills to get the habit of the chest-push and then go full stroke again. Ultimately, you can do a great fly technique with a buoy between your legs if you know what you're doing, so focus on core 1st and foremost, work out from there. Hope that helps.     I wouldn't worry too much about your head position yet, that will be something I'd look to correct later. There"

Swimming,3cih5m,WhaleMeatFantasy,8,Wed Jul 8 04:09:02 2015 UTC,"I know way too much about it. It has been shown to be extremely effective in young athletes, no open level success on the world stage (which isn't surprising as it is a relatively new method).  It is a good way to pull maximum pace out of athletes for as long as possible. It has it's good and bad points, but I personally don't fully endorse it.  It is not the be all end all that some make out, but I think it is only a matter of time until someone from a program that does mostly USRPT wins at a world level meet. Although I know a few USRPT programs that are somewhat dishonest about how much they do it (once or twice a week as opposed to every session like recommended by Rushall) so they can use him as a resource without fully committing.  Every good program does it, it is just high intensity interval training at race pace. USRPT usually refers to using it exclusively. I think Bob Bowman said some of the best things about it when he said that it is something that he does, but  it is just one facet of their program as opposed too a be all end all.  I have trained in a USRPT program. It was boring as hell and I felt I had a lot more carry over fatigue at meets. Often swimming much slower by the end than I was at the start. I was pretty glad to move on when I left.  an example set could be something like 30x25 on 30 holding race pace. If you miss your pace on one you sit one cycle out, If you miss 2 in a row you stop.  Edit: to clarify it is relatively new to base your entire program around it. Interval training is old"
Swimming,3cih5m,jared0h,0,Wed Jul 8 05:08:47 2015 UTC,"Every good program does it, it is just high intensity interval training at race pace. USRPT usually refers to using it exclusively.    If you've read the actual abstracts, it repetitively mentions over and over that this is not what USRPT is.  USRPT relies as much on what is not being done as what is being done.  I think this is what frustrates USRPT people the most, and I kind of agree with them.  People claim that any kind of sprinting in workout on an interval is USRPT.  I think one of the specifications of USRPT is that you do only the USRPT sets as defined and nothing else."
Swimming,3cih5m,TheThunderbird,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:35:18 2015 UTC,"That isn't at all what I claimed. So perhaps you should reread my comment more carefully.  What part of ""USRPT usually refers to doing it exclusively"" did you not understand? I was explaining to someone inquiring about it that it really isn't some crazy out there set, it is just the belief that swimming HIIT exclusively will lead to optimum results. One that I know is (for me at least) incorrect.  I have swam in a USRPT program overseen by Doc Rushall. I know what it is."
Swimming,3cih5m,jared0h,0,Fri Jul 10 01:22:33 2015 UTC,"What I was getting at is that by the definition of USRPT by Rushall, ""a program that does mostly USRPT"" is not doing USRPT at all.  I think there's a significant difference in approach between USRPT, HIIT, HIT and any of those things plus other methodologies.  Not that I'm advocating for any of them as good or bad."
Swimming,3cih5m,TheThunderbird,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:58:00 2015 UTC,"You are mostly right, but I was trying to explain it to someone clearly not familiar with the methodology.  USRPT is just what Rushall has dubbed his program. Every set in his program is HIIT... HIIT is a broad umbrella term covering sessions that the USRPT program is consisted of.  As for why I said mostly, the programs I know well doing USRPT (a group that involves a few national age champs) secretly do gym without Rushalls approval. Something he does not encourage in his program. Hence why I said mostly."
Swimming,3cih5m,jared0h,3,Fri Jul 10 13:26:07 2015 UTC,"To follow up on what /u/jared0h has already stated:  USRPT/HIIT is nothing new its been around since the 70's as have many other methods. The issue is that some coaches are using it exclusively as the be all end all to their practices.  That only works when your swimmers already have excellent form. It's very hard to slow down a stroke and correct it when you are always attempting to go race pace. HIIT and USRPT can make bad form worse and temd to lead to both long/short term joint/motor issues.  When used in conjunction with traditional training methods it can significantly improve VO2 max and endurance and is great for meet prep training for new and seasoned swimmers.  Most coaches I know do a variety of HIIT which includes race paced intervals, and 80% max intervals etc. as well individual stroke skill sets and slow speed form based drills. The more balanced the sets are and varied the more likely you are to develop a balanced stroke and body and the less burn out you will have with your swimmers."

It is designed to give you a goal time that is hard to reach, especially in a practice setting. I hated doing these sets, but I could see the effect in meets. The sets can build endurance and speed for any stroke and distance. We may have done these sets differently compared to other teams but the idea was the same."
Swimming,3cih5m,transformer84,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:17:58 2015 UTC,When people talk about 'USRPT' they are usually referring to the model proposed by doc rushall where every single session is essentially nothing but HIIT.  Unless you are doing nothing but that your program is vastly different to Michael Andrews.

Swimming,3ciulv,InstantArcade,2,Wed Jul 8 06:36:40 2015 UTC,"I'm going to branch off of a couple other responses...   Hand entry needs improvement like /u/SashimiGG said.  Especially on your second 25, you're grabbing a lot of air and pushing it in the form of bubbles.  You moving the water is what's moving you forward; but when you're moving air you're not getting that push foward.  Your hands should enter the water in this order: fingertips, wrist, elbow.  Keeping your elbows high will really help with this.  On your first 25 your left arm looks good, but your right arm is swinging out rather than bending at the elbow. Start breathing on both sides.  This will help with your distance per stroke in the long run like /u/Poolpartys said.  My coach always said that freestyle is a stroke you swim on your side.  It's an exaggeration, but in some ways it's true.  A simple exercise to illustrate this point is to stand with your shoulders square to the edge of a table far enough back that your outstretched fingertips are aligned with the edge of the table.  Now rotate your shoulders so that one arm is stretched out and your shoulders are roughly perpendicular to the edge of the table.  Your fingertips should now be stretched out about a hand's length or more farther than the edge of the table.  This is extra water that you can be pulling to move you forward. Focus on pulling all the way down so that your hand reaches your hip.  Especially on your second 25, it looks like your stroke stops at your belly button.  Again, you're not pulling as much water as you can.  For these last two issues I like to do catch up drill and mustard drill (also called zipper drill).  With catch up drill you push off the wall in streamline, take a stroke with one arm (keeping the other arm extended), and catch it up to the other arm. Really work on stretching your stroke out, reaching all the way out, and pulling all the way back.  Mustard drill is similar to catch up drill, hence the name, but you focus on your arm's recovery.  Just like catch up drill, you push off in streamline, take a stroke with one arm (keeping the other arm extended), and when you pull all the way back your hand ""checks in"" at your hips, then your armpit, then back out to the other arm.  This will keep your elbows high and your hands pulling all the way back."
Swimming,3ciulv,commentkarmawh0re,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:17:15 2015 UTC,"Try to focus on having your hand enter smoothly into the water rather then slamming your arm into water.

Swimming,3ciulv,Poolpartys,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:25:50 2015 UTC,Is that a 25yd pool? Because if it is you should realy try and cut down on the number of strokes it takes your for a lap. Try gliding a little longer whenever your hand has entered to water. Easily done by counting your strokes and then trying to subtract one on your next length.

You would be filling out your financial aid forms and what not. No one will be reaching out to you offering money generally to attend a D3 as a swimmer - they are primarily looking for academic aid first upon admittance then other aid as needed.   In short you need to be either actively talking to the administration and coaches and working on your application or accepted before anyone will talk finances with you. Anyone talking money before you are accepted is just tossing you a carrot that is not guaranteed in any shape.  Finally unless its in writing to you, its just vapor money."

Swimming,3cfwta,nermalll,3,Tue Jul 7 19:39:41 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you mean by first year comp swimmer.  If you've been swimming for years, but just never competed it's very feasible.  If this is the first year you've ever swam? Not very likely thing to happen.  For starters, it's breaststroke which is so incredibly technical that if you aren't already good at the stroke, it will be so hard to fix the stroke and make it strong in a year.  Also, if this is your first year swimming ever you will very quickly learn that being in amazing running shape does not transition to being in swimming shape.  Swimming using different muscles than most other sports.  So, this is your first year swimming you will be spending the first few months of the year just trying to get into shape enough to swim in a race.

My first official race in the 100 yd breaststroke was a 1:15, but I had a lot of natural ability. I think you can definitely do it if you are willing to put in the work.  Heres what I would do:  Start off with stretching your legs everyday (specifically the areas around your ankles and knees).  Try doing that thing where you bring your foot up to your hip or butt to stretch.    Watch videos of olympic breaststrokers.  Try and mimic their up and down movement.  Get in the water.  Whenever coach tells you to swim stroke for a certain set, swim breaststroke.  You will never be in first and probably miss every interval, but if you want that time you have to work for it.

However, I live in Europe and shipping + taxes would make the price go up several times.  I mean open water swimming, but not necessary long distances. Just swimming short distances and jumping into water in some area would also be ok."
Swimming,3cb30m,texasnick1203,49,Mon Jul 6 14:56:31 2015 UTC,I think a couple of those designers are regulars in my pool. They swerve all over the pool and manage to be in the way of EVERYBODY.
Swimming,3cb30m,Sourisnoire,43,Mon Jul 6 17:23:42 2015 UTC,"Some pools have the lane lines under the ropes. The best story I remember (can't remember the town) was the muncipality was going to finance a long course pool and the architect suggested to make it a bit shorter (forty-something meters) so the pool would nicely match the pillars next to it. Allegedy, yelling ensued from both the local club and the national-level association.  I do have fond memories of swimming backstroke in Kouvola, where the pool has diagonal lines in the ceiling. (These days they put red strings to point the correct direction, but those weren't in use back in my racing days.)"
Swimming,3cb30m,avataRJ,31,Mon Jul 6 17:55:28 2015 UTC,I was a lifeguard at a gym's grand opening. The backstroke flags were hung from the ceiling at the ends of the pool; like 0 meters from the wall instead of 5m. It was like that for almost a month.

Swimming,3cb30m,RaisinAnnette,4,Tue Jul 7 01:50:34 2015 UTC,The indoor pool at my club say worse - the ceiling lines were off by about 15 degrees. Enough to just make you list into the lane line every single time.
Swimming,3cb30m,swimfast58,5,Mon Jul 6 22:15:21 2015 UTC,My city invested millions into a new swimming complex. They only put flags on one side of the pool. I only realised it after I hurt my head...

Swimming,3cb30m,Wookie-dog,3,Tue Jul 7 02:14:35 2015 UTC,"One of the pools Ive had to swim at, the lines would be for the most part down the middle of the lane for the first couple lanes. But after that you could notice the line shifting closer and closer towards the rope, until eventually there were lanes with no line at all, with the line under the rope."

Swimming,3cdiwr,reduxrouge,6,Tue Jul 7 17:39:58 2015 UTC,Swimming wasn't mentioned as being fun at all during that article.  It was described more as an obligation for Michael :/

(I am about his age and have gone to several of the meets he has both of our lives)(I also raced next to him a few times, he whooped me on the walls haha) He is a really nice kid and swimming still seems like alot of fun for him. I also got a chance to talk to the father but just as you said it seems there is alot of pressure coming from him. Michael did not seem as though he did not enjoy swimming. I would agree with you though, if his parents it could lead to some problems but I think he can work through it, like I said is a really positive kid."
Swimming,3cdiwr,Shadowslight3x,3,Thu Jul 9 00:38:41 2015 UTC,"I think his parents know what they're doing for the most part, other than his lack of freedom. Michael phelps was in a pool every single day for years but his mother allowed him the freedom to go to a public school and have a social life. That would definitely help him relax when he's not in the pool"
Swimming,3cdiwr,isnotcreative,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:36:53 2015 UTC,"I think this is what I was getting at. Between the religious fanaticism and not allowing him to attend school, it sure appears as if they are crippling him intellectually. If his pro swim career doesn't pan out as the financial solution his parents so desperately want, what the hell is this kid going to do post-swim career with zero education?"
Swimming,3cdiwr,isnotcreative,2,Tue Jul 7 14:09:31 2015 UTC,I don't think he's lacking in education if pro swimming isn't a full time career. I think he would definitely be a top world swimmer if he had a bit more freedom to release any stress. If he had the freedom to be a teenager he would be more adjusted and could keep a career separate from the rest of his life. I definitely think that that helped Phelps and others stay focused on swimming when it was time to train
Swimming,3cdiwr,Sled_Driver,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:09:22 2015 UTC,Wasn't he 6'7 at age 13?  Already taller then Phelps is currently?  He's a great swimmer but I think there is a definete physiological advantage leading his adolescent charge...and a bit of marketing for his fathers USRP business in terms of the surrounding hype.

From the results I think he is doing pretty well in the pool. It looks like his parents actually know what there are doing. So that is a good thing.   He is maybe a bit to focussed about performing in the pool, which can be a bad thing, but may also help him stimulate to perform even better. It can work both ways I guess.  So I am curious to see how it is in 4 years from now."

Every country has a michael andrews like swimmer every couple of years, I imagine the US has had a lot of them over the years, very few manage to break through to opens and even less can find success on the world stage.  In saying that I wish him nothing but the best, he has definitely had a pretty rough and one dimensional childhood. Being one-dimensional is never a good thing."

Swimming,3cacy2,RadioactiveCashew,2,Mon Jul 6 14:25:36 2015 UTC,"I would think it means that you could load up a workout on your iPhone, it would push it to the AppleWatch app, and then away you go ...   To be more specific, they could track your distance so the app knows when you complete a 100. Or, it could be very specific and have intervals loaded in, counting down the time (or counting up?), providing the rest intervals as well, etc.   I'm not sure how this app exactly does it, but these are just examples of how they could achieve that."

Swimming,3cau4g,Poolpartys,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:44:10 2015 UTC,"Whenever I put my head underwater, I breath out slowly.  I guess this general pressure keeps anything from going up my nose.

I've increased the amount of time I spend in pools and am outside for the summer where lap lanes are shared with kids = high level of chemicals.

Swimming,3cau4g,sharpfork,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:44:55 2015 UTC,"Try closing your mouth and humming.  You'll notice that air is coming out of your nose slowly and you can use it to blow bubbles with your nose.  It lets out just enough air to keep water out of your nose, but not enough that you're blowing all of your air out at one time."
Swimming,3cbiyc,campkev,3,Mon Jul 6 16:58:43 2015 UTC,"This is something that depends entirely on you and your own limits.  The first absolute must is you have to fix your technique before getting in the water again.  You do not want to have lasting shoulder problems.  If you are able to swim without feeling pain, then by all means go ahead.  You must know your own limits, reddit cannot help you with that."
Swimming,3cbiyc,tcg10737,2,Tue Jul 7 01:30:24 2015 UTC,It all depends on the pain. If your muscles is only sore then continu swimming and focus on technique. If it really hurts then it is best to take time off until the pain goes away.  You can try swimming back and breast and see if the pain is not present during those strokes. But I think it is always a good idea to switch between the various strokes during a practice.
Swimming,3cbiyc,Timo_12,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:45:25 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to build up.  Started swimming three times a week doing a 50 of each.

Back is a little uncomfortable, but not painful."
Swimming,3cbiyc,Timo_12,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:35:57 2015 UTC,"The major focus is not feeling any pain. Because I can not comment on your form, maybe you can ask someone or watch videos on youtube to get an idea about technique.

Swimming,3cbiyc,adchrom,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:09:31 2015 UTC,"Agree with everyone else: 1. Soreness is fine and probably to be expected.  2. Continuous sharp pain associated with a specific movement of your stroke probably means something is rubbing the wrong way.  Fixing technique is the quickest way to solve this problem.    I've mentioned this before on other threads but spartKid's post about common problems recently saved my right should from very sharp pain.  I was not doing the 'meathook' and instead trying to pull water towards me instead of pulling my body towards my arm (not easy to explain, he does a better job).  It was a small correction but immediately solved it, been working on the new technique for 3-4 weeks now but felt pain relief within the first day after 3 weeks of sharp pain.  I would wait 3 days, read that post and try to emulate."
Swimming,3c7umq,ShadInSight,13,Sun Jul 5 18:41:04 2015 UTC,"1) One pound a week is good for sustained weight loss. More than that is generally considered unsustainable.  2) Too long ago. I vaguely recall it taking about 6 months ago of at least twice what you are doing to develop the ""swimmer's V"". Now I'm older and the difference is in the opposite direction going around my middle!"
Swimming,3c7umq,LoneSwimmer,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:46:41 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot! That actually provides me a very good estimate to compare where i'm currently at right now. I will lower my expectations of achieving a swimmer's V in about 5 months and focus more on trying to do 150 lengths in an hour.  I also agree that a pound a week is definitely more sustainable but the drop in weight loss is still very puzzling. The only thing I can infer is I was probably losing a lot of muscle at 3 pounds a week before.
Swimming,3c7umq,brownIndustries,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:54:44 2015 UTC,"When you first start losing weight you lose a lot of water weight, so even though you're losing 'more',  you're still losing the same amount of fat. Also if you're losing noticeable amounts of fat you won't be putting on noticeable amounts of muscle. Reduced weight loss can also be due to lower tdee, as you lose weight you're body needs less to sustain itself."
Swimming,3c7umq,jamincan,5,Mon Jul 6 16:08:27 2015 UTC,"I've heard, and also from personal experience, that the first place people notice weight loss is in the face/neck.  It is possible that you are developing greater muscle mass and therefore offsetting some of the effects of growing leaner. This should also lead to a greater basal metabolic rate and increase the number of calories you burn in a day overall. Be careful about how much you boost your intake, though, because in my experience, swimming doesn't burn that many calories, at least in comparison to other activities where it is easier to maintain a high intensity for long periods of time like cycling."
Swimming,3c7umq,maybemeat,3,Sun Jul 5 20:26:31 2015 UTC,"Yup i read a lot of articles online before starting up on swimming again and made sure I didnt fall victim to the ""I probably just burned 1000 calories, lets go ham on whatevers left in the fridge"" fallacy. Currently i'm burning about 600 - 750 calories in the hour that i swim and have upped my calorie intake by about 300 - 400 calories, was eating about 1500 calories a day, now I eat about 1800 - 1900, otherwise my stomache just starts to feel like its trying to digest itself especially after the swim. I'm curious to know how fast/how much muscle is built up in swimming though, cant really find any good sources that give estimates."
Swimming,3c7umq,arpse,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:09:03 2015 UTC,"How have you worked out how many calories you burn in an hour of swimming? Have you used a heart rate monitor, or are you using another way of estimating.  It is quite hard to estimate calories for swimming, as technique plays such a big role in how much effort you exert.   It could be that you are over estimating how much you burn in the water and therefore over compensating for the swim with your increased calories.  While increased muscles might account for a bit of the slow down in weight loss, it won't be much over just 3 weeks."
Swimming,3c7umq,ChillingSoul,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:56:27 2015 UTC,"My estimations were made just by calculations/estimation provided by the american college of medicine and such with reading on research online of how much a person of my weight (232 lbs) would burn in an hour of swimming at a moderate pace. I havent really done any proper measurements with heart rate monitors and such, my swimming technique is not great, I can do a length of 25 metres in about 35 - 45 seconds usually, I have managed to time that with a friends help, and am usually struggling for breath after 15 lengths or so but then control my breathing and just keep going, so i'm not exactly just doing a very casual swim either. I dont think an increase of intake of about 300 - 400 calories per day would be too much overcompensation given the amount of exercise. If you think it is, care to shed some light on how much i should reduce it by?"

Swimming,3c7umq,yangYing,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:51:24 2015 UTC,you are fairly correct in everything you said above i think you are moving in the right direction
Swimming,3c7umq,TunaBoo,4,Mon Jul 6 00:12:37 2015 UTC,"Muscles weight more then bodyfat, so you're probablystill burning fat while bulding up your muscles, assuming your calorie ratio is ok.  You should try intensive interval training. It's way more challenging then swimming an hour in which your body will used to the same pace quick.  I swim 3,5km within an hour and i am OK after, however ONLY 1,5 km interval training within 45mins (all strokes) is way more challenging for me, i am way more wasted after."

Swimming,3c7umq,WilsonK907,2,Sun Jul 5 21:05:52 2015 UTC,Interval training can also be a lot easier mentally. You get clear rest periods and something to always think about. You'll love those 7 seconds of rest every minute or two.
Swimming,3c7umq,LTrain17,2,Sun Jul 5 23:34:19 2015 UTC,"Most weight loss follows this pattern - it's rapid to begin and seems to slow as the program progresses ... it can be quite discouraging (e.g. 'what am I doing wrong?' 'should I adjust the program?' etc etc)  There are differing reasons (increased muscle mass is one) but the most significant is water weight - much of your 3 lbs a week loss was excess water.  As you continue with your progress you will notice increases and seeming reductions in your rate of weight reduction. Whilst weight watching can be helpful and useful, if you're far enough along you might consider switching to weekly weigh-ins. It takes patience and it takes time, and fixating can complicate the program.  It's different for everyone ... but what's true for us all is continued work will result in a healthy physique will you be proud of :-)"

Find a pool that has a steady incline and work your way down. Each time get a little further than you're completely comfortable with before hopping out. If you have someone who can help you try floating on your back first - they can help - to get comfortable. Once you realise you can float it'll be easier to work on your stomach. Start small. Practice standing and exhaling slowly (blowing bubbles) with just your mouth in the water. Once you can do this, move onto your nose. Once that's comfortable, move onto your face, all still standing. Finally, work on getting your legs up and floating on your stomach. Do it in the shallow end where you know you can stand so if you get nervous you can just put your feet down, or even keep one hand on the wall until you're comfortable. It'll take time but you'll get there!"

Just have to train yourself to focus on other things and reduce panic. I can now swim alone for a good amount of time but if left too long I still start getting small sparks of fear and anxiety.

Swimming,3c5me7,AndersonIV,46,Sun Jul 5 01:01:48 2015 UTC,"Edit:  thanks for the gold!!  Former USA swim coach/Current USA-certified water polo coach here: Sounds to me like you have a body position issue first, which then leads to the overuse of the arms.  It's a maddeningly simple fix, but requires a bit of visualization and a lot of patience.  Kick sets (at least in the typical sense of multiple laps with a kick board) and dry land leg sets really won't solve the problem.  In then end, it come down to where your head is in relation to the rest of your body, whether you're relaxed in the water, and then finally your stroke mechanics.  (Notice how I'm not even bringing legs into the equation, more on that in a bit).  Before I go any further, talk to your coach.  If your coach is halfway decent, if you approach them and say, ""I'm muscling through my free, how do I fix it?"", they should help you.  I always defer to a swimmer's regular coach since they will know you and your bad habits better than you realize.    Now on to my suggestion:  Ultimately, you're going to need to completely reconstruct your stroke.  This, frankly, is a really big pain in the ass and can be very frustrating for any age bracket, but can be very hard for young sprinters especially.  Remember to be patient with yourself and to not rush the drills I describe below.  You've already taken a huge step towards fixing your own stroke by rightly noticing that your head is high and your hips low.  Having that awareness of body position is crucial to fixing your particular problem.  So props for that.    First off, ask yourself: how should I be positioned in the water when I swim?  The answer is the same for all four racing strokes: you should have you hips up at the surface and the water line should be at the top of your head (it doesn't matter if you're face up or face down, that fundamental body position is always the same).  For free, breast, and fly, your eyes, as another commentator pointed out, should be looking at the bottom of the pool.  Essentially, picture a ""dead man's float"" or ""front float"".  This is the neutral position from which your three ""face down"" strokes originate.  Before making the leap to water polo, I had every swimmer that I worked with, no matter the age, go over a refresher of the neutral position at the start of every season.  To do that, I had them all do sets of 25yds kick doing what I always called the ""mummy drill"".  I would have them start with a front float which they would hold for 5 seconds before starting a light kick down to the other end of the pool.  Their arms would rest freely at their sides and they were to try to keep the water line on the very top of their head.  Most importantly, I would ask them to RELAX.  The goal would be to feel out how their bodies naturally floated with light propulsion.  I asked them to go slow, to breathe as necessary (first by lifting their head straight up, later adding rotation) and to take as much rest as needed between 25's.     Again, the goal is ultimately to be relaxed and to feel your body in the water.  Typically I'd have my swimmers do at least 8x25 of this drill, untimed, either face up or face down.  The kick aspect would basically help with propulsion and balance only; the goal of the kick was not to generate a lot of speed.  From there I would add in core rotation/rotary breaths and finally arm strokes.  All focusing on a nice, relaxed, balanced body position.  When it does come time to add the arms remember a couple core principles: 1) RELAX!  Don't force your entry or recovery.  Stretch your stroke out.  Reach forward with your arms and slide your hand gently into the water, with your entry point just outside outside your shoulders.  2) pull straight through your stroke... don't worry about making an ""S"" shape with your hands, just pull through in a straight line (biomechanics will ultimately create the underwater ""S"").  3) during the recovery phase of your stroke keep yourself relaxed and don't muscle through it.  Finally I'd add in stroke counting drills and ask each swimmer to drop their stroke count with each 25, reminding them to extend their arms forward towards the wall, keep their bodies relaxed and their head position neutral, and to not focus on speed but instead focus on their balance and how they slid through the water.  So to sum up, here's what I would have you do to correct your ""hulking"" stroke:  1) 8x25, untimed, dead mans float for 5 seconds, then add light kick.  Breathe as needed.  Arms should hang loose.  Focus on staying relaxed and keeping waterline on top of head.  2) 8x25 untimed, dead mans float for 5 seconds, add light kick with arms loose at sides.  Add in body rotation by rolling all the way to the left (so one shoulder is pointed towards the ceiling, the other towards the bottom), hold for 7 kicks then rotate to the right, hold for 7 kicks, etc.  Breathe to both sides but not on every rotation.  Make sure to rotate your entire body, keep your entire body extended, and to keep the waterline on top of your head and eyes on the bottom (except when breathing).  3) 8x25 of the above but add in arm strokes.  Again, focus on your body first.  Make sure your head stays in the neutral position.  Your body should remain extended forward and your hands should enter just outside your shoulder.    4) do 8 more 25's of the above, but start stroke counting.  Don't go for speed.  All of the 25s should be untimed.  Instead try to knock off 1, 2 or 3 strokes per 25.  Remember to stay relaxed and to reach forward with both your body and your hands.  In the end: BE PATIENT.  These drills are mind numbing and very frustrating, especially for anyone that's used to plowing through swim sets.  But the goal here is not speed or strength, it's balance and awareness.  If you're doing all of the above correctly you should be able to feel how your body wants to float, how it encounters drag, and how your legs, core, head position, and arm movements all contribute to your stroke.  Go slow, take your time, and remember to stay loose and relaxed.  Hope this helps!  Good luck!"

Swimming,3c5me7,Jisifus,5,Sun Jul 5 09:52:40 2015 UTC,"This is really helpful, as someone with similar habits to op. Could you clarify the head position relative to the water line though? You say ""top of the head"" several times - I assume you mean the part of the head facing the ceiling? So, back of head in crawl/breast/fly and face in back stroke? How much of the head/face should be out of the water?   Thanks!"
Swimming,3c5me7,bradmont,3,Sun Jul 5 14:32:01 2015 UTC,"Good question!  To answer, try a visualization exercise: stand up straight with your eyes looking forward.  This is the correct body position for all four racing strokes.  Now picture a vertical line that crosses through your body, right in line with your spine, that comes out the top of your head.  This is more or less where the waterline will be on your head.  It varies a bit from person to person where exactly the waterline will be, which is why I'd recommend starting with a front float, so you can feel out where that natural waterline is for you.   When you flip over and do a back float, the location of the waterline will change a bit, but in the end the body position you're trying to maintain is the same as with a front float.  Most important though to is to keep your neck and shoulders relaxed.  Once you start over tensing your muscles, your body will tend to sink.  So staying loose is key.  When it comes to head position, it's almost more important to stay relaxed and make sure you're  not tensing up.  If you're trying to place your head or to hold it in a certain spot, you run a risk of either holding it too high--causing your legs to sink-- or too low--causing your shoulders to sink.  Both situations create crazy amounts of drag and can put a ton of extra stress on your shoulders."
Swimming,3c5me7,bigpoppasmurff,3,Sun Jul 5 23:14:26 2015 UTC,"As a former competitive swimmer (prior to a nasty motorcycle accident) your guidance is superb. Went on to study fluid mechanics and taught physics etc. Being back in the pool sees trying to notice drag - feeling the energy draw of turbulence and attempting to attenuate any source helps prompt such a stream lined posture to avail laminate flow for profiles not involved in propulsion (turbulence unavoidable in propulsive dynamics). Just wish this had been more evident when competitive! The key, perhaps, applying the energy efficiently whilst guarding against fatigue's ravages with disciplined strategy."

Swimming,3c5me7,Banana-Power,3,Sun Jul 5 02:09:46 2015 UTC,"Sorry this isn't exactly what you're asking for, but I have a suggestion. When I was a first year I also had trouble with kicking way underwater and my head being craned up. I got rid of that pretty quickly by simply keeping my eyes on the bottom of the pool. I thought I was looking down before, but I really wasn't. You're never supposed to look at the wall in front of you, or other swimmers unless you're flipping. In fact, I sometimes get scared of bonking my head off the wall while doing freestyle!  As for your legs, I just make a conscious effort to not arch my back, as well as making sure I hear myself kicking. I make sure I can feel my toes splashing on top of the water, as well as hearing the splashing. If I don't, then I know I'm kicking underwater. Keeping your head down in the first place helps with your legs too."
Swimming,3c5me7,east_end,2,Sun Jul 5 02:41:03 2015 UTC,"I agree re: keeping the eyes down. As for bonking - I keep my eye out for the markings on the bottom of the pool.

Swimming,3c43ue,dudedudeman1,4,Sat Jul 4 16:13:19 2015 UTC,"Everyone is different. If you're faster underwater than you are swimming free/back/fly, then train so that you can take the whole 15 meters off of every wall. For many that is not the case. Everyone pushes of the wall faster than they can possibly swim. If that's not true for you, then really focus on improving your streamline posture. If you're faster on top of the water, it takes a bit more effort to figure out exactly where you should be breaking out, but the quick and dirty version is ""don't stay underwater kicking if you're faster on top."" At some point your speed off the wall is going to match the speed you swim at the surface. That point is where you should break out. If you're a terrible dolphin kicker and a great freestyler, you might take one kick before breaking out.   As far as the strokes per lap question, you're thinking about it too literally. What you really care about is ""distance per stroke"" but strokes per lap is an easier way to quantify that and assess your efficiency on the spot. If you aren't being consistent with your distance off your walls, then strokes/lap becomes a mix of your stroke and underwater efficiency. I suggest counting your kicks and your strokes and making sure that both are consistent. That way, you'll actually know when you're become less efficient due to fatigue/poor technique vs changes in your distance off the walls"
Swimming,3c43ue,chickenboy2718281828,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:34:17 2015 UTC,"thanks for the detailed response. in terms of the strokes per lap question I'm mostly wondering about this sentence in a book I'm reading: ""when you can routinely swim 100 yards -- four lengths -- in 80 strokes or less, your ready to [...]""    how much of those 100 yards is underwater kicking?"
Swimming,3c43ue,chickenboy2718281828,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:11:44 2015 UTC,"Someone else mentioned this below, but good swimmers will breakout past the flags almost invariably. My college coaches would often specify during sets where we should be breaking out (we usually said 3/4/5 lines, referring to perpendicular black lines in a 25 yd by 50 meter pool). If you're doing aerobic swimming is pretty hard for even very experienced swimmers to hold more than 3 lines of each wall at pace. 3 lines is approximately feet breaking out at the flags."
Swimming,3c43ue,Jlsh11,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:24:46 2015 UTC,"when they say for example ""Tom Dolan took 56 strokes per 100 meters"", does that mean he was streamlining for 30 meters? 56 strokes per 100 meters says nothing about his distance per stroke unless you know how much of it he was streamlining"
Swimming,3c43ue,Chrisnonfer,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:15:01 2015 UTC,"Right, you can't compare distance per strike by just this. All that this tells you is how many times he pulled within the distance."
Swimming,3c43ue,kellybean510,2,Sun Jul 5 03:54:26 2015 UTC,1: during a race I would dolphin kick until right before you start noticeably losing speed. If this is really soon then you're swimming 20m. If you can maintain your momentum off the wall the whole 15m then go for that. In practice you should be practicing maintaining that momentum as long as you can. In a race I'd say an average swimmer probably comes up a little after the flags.   2: they would assume that your dolphin kick is consistent. Basically if you usually take 3 kicks and 15 strokes to the wall you would extend your distance/stroke by doing 3 kicks and 13 strokes.
Swimming,3c43ue,Schnoobs69,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:20:19 2015 UTC,"The dolphin kick is there to take advantage of the momentum you have from pushing off the wall, so you should only be kicking til you break the surface with your streamline and begin your stroke (In a competitive pool there should be markers on the lane line).   The purpose of counting your strokes is to determine how efficiently you are moving through the water/covering the distance. So as you practice, drill, become stronger, it should take you less pulls of your arms to cover the same distance. Dolphin kicking halfway won't really be doing you any good (aside from drilling).  Hope that helped!"
Swimming,3c43ue,Schnoobs69,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:31:40 2015 UTC,"At least 6 kicks per streamline. Your goal is to hit the 15 meter mark, which is the furthest you can legally streamline. Remember that when starting your first strokes, or breakout, you do not breath until your done with them. For Fly you have 1 stroke for a breakout, and for Free it is generally one. They do take the streamline in account, but as was said before, there's a limit. Anyways, when you are doing distance per stroke you should not be streamlining half the length, as that would take away the point of the exercise, which is to make you do longer, more efficient strokes."

Swimming,3c43ue,dingleberryjuic,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:14:51 2015 UTC,"Not every swimmer will do 15 meters of streamline off every wall. If they can, they are freaking amazing. But yeah, suppose he does 30 for the 100. That leaves 70 meters in 56 strokes. That's still more than 1 meter a stroke, and that is significantly more than swimmers I know, like David Jakl. My coach says David took 30 a 50, assuming he streamlined as well. So 60 strokes for 70 meter is less than what Tom Dolan has done. And to answer your question, yes, everybody streamlines differently. Not everyone streamlines that far. But for comparison, you just divide distance left to swim after streamline by the number of strokes to get distance per stroke."
Swimming,3c4rds,mergadroid,5,Sat Jul 4 19:48:38 2015 UTC,"1) keep your knees closer together on your kick. 2) glide a bot longer. Your stroke rate is too fast. 3) don't stare at the wall in front of you, look at the line on the floor. This will help keep your streamline during the glide."

Polarised goggles are great in the bright sun, but any other time they just aren't great. If you swimming early in the morning they will be too dark. The best advice I can give you is to suggest buying the cheapest goggles that fit you. You will learn what you do and do not like about them, and whether you need those fancy coatings when it comes to your next pair."
Swimming,3c4nxb,lotophage77,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:25:59 2015 UTC,"The most important thing is that the goggles stay on your face and don't let in water. Try them on in the store. See if they will stay on your face without the strap and get a good suction. After you find a pair that qualify, then look at the other stuff you mention. The other stuff is relatively unimportant compared to them staying on."

Harvard has allowed the woman (now identifying as a man, and the politically correct way is to refer to him as a man), to compete on the men's team rather than the women's.

Swimming,3bzzl9,not_a_big_fan_of_GOT,2,Sun Jul 5 11:15:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course there are rules.

I think he made the right choice.  Edit: didn't read article carefully enough. Thought it was the other way around.  Although I stand by my opinion if it was the way I thought it was.

He was raised as a woman and initially recruited for by Harvard for the women's swim team. But he took a gap year between high school and college, during which he started transition to live as a man and started testosterone supplements. Harvard then offered him a place on the men's swim team.  NCAA policy for trans athletes:   A trans male (FTM) student athlete who has received a medical exception for treatment with testosterone for diagnosed Gender Identity Disorder or gender dysphoria and/or Transsexualism, for purposes of NCAA competition may compete on a men’s team, but is no longer eligible to compete on a women’s team without  changing that team status to a mixed team. A trans female (MTF) student athlete being treated with testosterone suppression medication for Gender Identity Disorder or gender dysphoria and/or Transsexualism, for the purposes of NCAA competition may continue to compete on a men’s team but may not compete on a women’s team without changing it to a mixed team status until completing one calendar year of testosterone suppression treatment.

Swimming,3bzzl9,Sled_Driver,4,Sat Jul 4 00:32:32 2015 UTC,"There's a soft truth to this.  For sports to be fully integrated into the trans community it would need another level of classification or a recatagorization of classes.  The current standard, though old, is a staple for sports and one originally setup FOR geneder integration.  A possible solution is to allow a trans person to swim on either squad/event but to note records under their classification (i.e. FtM or MtF or Nuetral.).  It sounds sticky at first but would be needed as developmental cisgender will always be a massive factor in event class."

Not to mention, especially in the case of FtM, the testosterone WILL give an FtM athlete an advantage over a cis Female, and maybe even an MtF athlete, depending on how their body would react to the estrogen.  I know that typically once the transition is complete, the hormonal levels average out. But the only way for it to not be an advantage or disadvantage during the process would be to disallow transitioning athletes from competing until their hormonal levels are ""normal"" for their new gender. And even then, if I understand correctly, most transgenders have to continue taking supplements, as you can biologically never fully change what your body produces. And I could see that becoming a very grey area in terms of doping."

Not sure why doping would be a concern for FTM athletes assuming they're competing against men rather than women, which is what the guy in the article is doing and has to be doing per NCAA regulations if he's taking testosterone. I'm a trans guy, have been on testosterone since 2006, and my levels have always been right in the middle of the male range. There is no way I could have an abnormally high testosterone level unless I took way more than my doctor prescribes (which is something a non-trans athlete could do, too). It's no more ""doping"" than having a set of balls is doping."
Swimming,3bzzl9,youlld30,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:12:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know what the NCAA rules are for when people have to take testosterone supplements, but right after a person takes the supplement their test levels could be outside of a 4 to 1 testosterone to epitestosterone limit for a small period of time and then soon decline until it's within the limit.  Then the person could get their test level checked and approved after it's gone into the limit.  Depending on their schedule and when the NCAA requires testing a person might be able to take a dose right before a race and have their blood levels be outside the limit and then compete like that and then eventually later get their levels tested in the limit."

Swimming,3bzzl9,not_a_big_fan_of_GOT,2,Sun Jul 12 01:46:47 2015 UTC,"Actually, post-HRT, trans women have less testosterone than most women, usually at the very bottom of the female range.

When it gets bad my coach takes us outdoors to run for 15-20 minutes at an aerobic pace.

It's everything from inside the flags to your next breakout. Good timing to stretch into the wall, stay tight and stay low, don't move your head, big push, tight streamline, appropriate depth, good timing on your underwater transitions, BIG EFFING PULL (not down your side either!), keep your head down coming up, smooth breakout into your breakout stroke and start hard! A lot of my swimmers wait to ""get into their rhythm"" but you need to get and keep it on your first stroke.  Perfect practice makes perfect. You need to practice both your strengths and weaknesses while you swim, there is no such thing as mindless swimming. With technique, speed will come. Technique first."

Every lap should be a sprint. In practice swim the tempo you would use in the 100 to teach your body to be able to keep the speed up without your stroke falling apart on the last lap.
Swimming,3bxghm,icalltopsolo,0,Fri Jul 3 02:39:17 2015 UTC,this
Swimming,3bxghm,icalltopsolo,3,Sat Jul 4 18:20:40 2015 UTC,"Is breaststroke your best stroke? What is your time now and how quickly do you want to make the drop to below 1:00?   I wasn't the greatest at breast, but I was pretty flexible and was a sprinter/mid dist guy who could pull out an IM if I had to. I didn't go under 1:00 until college, though. At the time I did it, I was pretty strong and could also go under 21 in the 50 free. So if you're the strong-type, just sprint the thing all out and figure out how far off you are (especially since it's SCY). Then work at top speed or endurance to make it happen.   My guess, though, is that you're in high school and swim breaststroke as your main event. My suggestion is to make your goal 57.5 to 58.5ish (so you have some wiggle room) and figure out what you have to do each lap to get to your goal.   Next, about once a week, sprint a hand full of 125's on lots of rest at the last 3 laps' pace and sprint a hand full of 75's at race pace from the block with TONS of rest. You want your body to be used to going that fast, to be familiar with the fatigue without your technique breaking down, and to establish confidence that you can do the race in pieces. After that, you just have to shave, put on a cap and put it all together."

Swimming,3bxghm,arpse,2,Fri Jul 3 07:46:41 2015 UTC,"Maaaaybe. Weights are a tricky issue. They make you stronger for sure, but they change your training and your ability to perform in season. Heavier lifting (especially legs) makes your taper take a lot longer, too.   Ultimately, I don't know enough about you to give you really specific advice, but here's what I can say. You're going to go under a minute, it's just a matter of how long it will take you. Consider how important it is and how much time you have to accomplish it, then make a plan. I mean, you're just talking about tenths of seconds each 25, but to shave those off, you have to swim faster, or slow down how fast your fatigue within the race.   For a 100 yard race, top speed is easier to manage than endurance because of how our anaerobic and aerobic capacities work within that first minute."

Swimming,3bxghm,bacon_music_love,2,Mon Jul 6 00:20:57 2015 UTC,"You can hit 58/59 by Feb. Definitely. That time frame gives you time to do at least 2 championship quality meets while rested and shaved (one in nov, one in feb).   A word of advice: there are times while training when you have the option to just swim really hard, and not quiiiite all out. I know in my career I worked really hard, but I also know there were tons of workouts where I was afraid of puking or pushing that extra step. If you can conquer that fear of discomfort (its not pain, just discomfort), I can promise that you'll surprise yourself.   Word of advice pt2: don't let this 100 breast define your entire season. If you're a 1:01 and have 7 months to shave 1.5 seconds off, you'll probably be fine if you work hard, but it would be a mistake to not allow yourself to feel great about other drops just because you didn't think they were as important.   My guess is that you're a high school junior or senior and your coach or the college you want to go to have told you this is where you need to be to get to where you want to go. That may be true, and use that to fuel you, but don't let it stress you out. Use it in practice EVERY DAY, but don't think about it at meets. When you're at a meet, you need to RACE and that's it."
Swimming,3bxghm,PurpleEnzo,3,Tue Jul 7 23:52:19 2015 UTC,"Alright so I'm actually a pretty awful breastroker but girls on my club team are shooting for 1:02/1:03's next year and basically whatever coach is saying to them can usually be summed up to ""flat/tight body position"" both on strokes and coming off the walls, and keeping a consistent tempo. You can't practice having 2 or the quick fast strokes off each wall and allowing yourself to slow down throughout the rest of the lap. Each 25 must have a consistent tempo to help you last the whole 100. Again this is not me personally just what I hear during practice. I would probably be lucky to break 1:10."

This includes doing relays by yourself and warm-up/warmdown for each event.   Another year we did a huge mix of sets. We hit over 17000 yards in about 4 hours.  When I was like 13 years old one year we did 100x100yd on descending intervals. I think we got 12500yd down in 2.5 hours  Another fun one I've done in college during winter training is 100x25 @ :45 all at 100% effort"

However, the great news is that you can use your quest for fly to strengthen your legs and core.  Just start slow.  About 6-8 weeks ago, I started adding dolphin kicking to my workout (underwater lengths and kicking on my back).  At first, dolphin kicking 50m while on my back burned my legs to the edge of exhaustion and it was the best leg workout I've had in awhile.

Swimming,3bvgyo,Nelts,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:49:54 2015 UTC,"Sort of. You could definitely do sprints but longer distances would be taxing. . . In my opinion you show serious improvements in the stroke by having strong legs, as the kick ultimately propels your chest and upper body out of the water (not straight up, but up and out). Why is this important? Because you spend less upper body energy getting yourself up and out of the water; and consequently have more energy to have a nice full pull of the arms through and under your body upon the hands/arms re-entry into the water."

Swimming speed isn't about weight, it's about tech, training and ...when you started swimming, and your age.  I know great open water swimmers who can't break 14:00 for 1k (which your post implies they should be able to).

Swimming,3btqyv,yangYing,2,Thu Jul 2 12:55:24 2015 UTC,"I guess I'd have to see proof of a range of late onset swimmers who'd been trained to so do and do it consitently.  While technique can always be improved, I recall for example when I was doing my coaching qualifications (I'm not a coach though) that it was stressed that swimmers that hadn't been properly trained by age 16 were unlikely to reach maximum genetic potential. While I am sure than occasional swimmers can do it, I have not seen your claim mirrored in real life amongst the swimmers I know. Those at 14:<00 p/1000 were mostly competitive swimmers at some time in their youth.   My only concern here though is the setting of realistic goals and expectations, not proving one of us right or wrong."

Try to do as many lengths as you can, rest until your breath is back to normal, and then go again. By practicing, you will increase endurance and stamina.

They know what they are talking about.  2) Please consider becoming a very strong swimmer before you put others' lives in your hands.  The fact that you began to struggle after lap 2 says that you are probably not a very strong swimmer.  Also, this suggests to me that you are also, perhaps, not as comfortable in the water as you should be to save others.  I was a lifeguard.  It's serious business.  Take it seriously.  And to other people - yeah, it really is about form.  I am about 50 pounds overweight, I don't work out, and I haven't done any exercise swimming since I stopped swimming competitively almost 20 years ago.  I'm on this sub because I want to get back into it, and I'm teaching my kids how to swim.  To win a bet that I could swim a 300 no problem, I recently went to the pool to prove myself.  Sure, I was out of breath by the end, but it wasn't a struggle.  My point?  The difference between us is form.  I've done so many laps and practiced how to move my arms through the water so many times that it's second nature, and it takes a lot less energy for me to push myself through the water than it does you - because of the form."
Swimming,3brl2c,UrbanPugEsq,4,Wed Jul 1 22:01:06 2015 UTC,"I had a similar realization. After doing the Couch to 5K running program, I decided that I wanted to start swimming as well. I figured that since I'd increased my endurance so much with running, I sure had also increased my swimming endurance. Wrong! I barely made it two laps at the pool before I was gasping. I got out of the pool, dragged myself over to the sitting area with as much composure as I could, flopped down, and didn't move for a very long time. And then I very, very, very slowly made my way home.  But now, I can swim for a long time just fine (at least by my own standards)! As I recall, I had significantly better endurance when I went back to the pool a few days later. Still not great, but I didn't need to get out of the pool after barely doing two laps, heh.

Its not so hard to get but it will be like starting over for a few weeks. When you save someone you hold them, so to get to shore/the side you need strong kick. So once you got swimming down (2000 yards) focus on lots of leg work - 50 yards flutter kick on your back should be easy for you, 10 mins treading-water-no-hands should be easy for you, inverted-breaststroke-legs-only should be easy for you. 25 yards underwater should be very doable.

To gain this certificate you have to pass similar tests. Either way, to be a better swimmer, obviously, start swimming. The difference I see between accomplished swimmers comfortable with any distance and people just trying to survive such things is the ability to continue swimming while tired; to be able to adjust your speed and effort to pace yourself. Novice swimmers often swim at one speed/pace and tire quickly. Accomplished swimmers can adapt and keep on keeping on. Try swimming at a slow steady pace, don't rest on the walls but try and recover in the water while swimming. The treading water challenge is a technique that can be learned and practiced - look it up and do it.  good luck, swimming is a fun skill to have at your disposal and  with some practice and technique you will get there."

Your muscles won't make a difference as swimming is all about finesse and technique. Start swimming more, work on your front crawl, and take some swimming lessons. If you just practice swimming with shitty form, you'll still be a bad swimmer. Got to get that form down and lessons will help that."

Swimming,3btl39,koolaidman47,2,Thu Jul 2 01:11:17 2015 UTC,"Just keep your legs almost completely straight. Like knee movement should be less then 20 degrees. Try laying flat on a bed, and flex your thighs and point your toes flat as possible. Lift one leg at a time, focusing on moving them up with the power in your thighs and keeping your legs almost completely straight. Translate this to the pool, slowly. You should get it in time. It might seem slow at first, but once you get the rhythm and power behind your kicks it will be fast."

Swimming,3btl39,Jlsh11,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:46:26 2015 UTC,Can you go 25 yards freestyle? Swimming in a shallow lap pool and practicing your stroke and kick would help greatly. Learning how to swim is going to be very hard to do if you can't swim consistently. Getting in some yards at least twice a week will help you become comfortable swimming.

Swimming,3brypn,ButtDozer,7,Wed Jul 1 19:09:25 2015 UTC,Three/four laps can not be construed as pushing yourself too hard. Swim more. Swim more often.
Swimming,3brypn,Moonsinger,3,Wed Jul 1 19:35:49 2015 UTC,"Swimming can be incredibly difficult to get started with. As you're getting started, I'd recommend looking into using a pull buoy. It's a bit counter intuitive that not kicking might be easier, but I find the additional buoyancy means that newer swimmers aren't ""dragging"" their feet through the water as much.  Additionally, take your time to stretch out your stroke, a lot of newer swimmers let their hands enter too short, increasing the number of strokes and really upping the energy used to do a lap.  It's a daunting sport to start, but once things start to click you may be surprised how quickly it comes together."
Swimming,3brypn,DannyDougherty,2,Wed Jul 1 20:09:10 2015 UTC,Don't forget to stretch after swimming! It helps a lot!
Swimming,3brypn,mrmister321,2,Wed Jul 1 19:51:34 2015 UTC,"Talking about needing to listen up after swimming, it sounds like you're holding your body too stiffly in the water. Try to relax and not tense up as you're swimming. This will come more naturally as you learn to trust the water, but being aware of it can make a big difference."
Swimming,3bsgrp,jeanhyuk,3,Wed Jul 1 19:55:02 2015 UTC,"Also do the 6-kick on one side drill. So, take a stroke, and then kick 6 times. Take another stroke with your other arm, and then kick 6 times. This will help your body to get the feel of rotating. Imagine a pole going through the top of your head to your booty, and rotate with that in mind."

I found a video on YouTube, I could be wrong but think this should really help you."
Swimming,3bsgrp,Jimmy_5694,3,Wed Jul 1 23:05:47 2015 UTC,"I agree, that drill improved my stroke so so so much.   OP, I would also suggest to keep the elbow higher on the pull through to get more leverage with each stroke."

Swimming,3bsgrp,soundkite,2,Thu Jul 2 15:31:03 2015 UTC,Thank you. The video tells me that I've been doing catch up drills wrong all along. I'll work on it.
Swimming,3bsgrp,maxesballz,3,Thu Jul 2 15:34:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not a freestyle expert, but it looks like your catch is asymmetric and you are not getting enough from your pull.  Definitely wide with the left hand, and I agree with the idea of some catch up drill (along with alternate breathing!!), but beware of getting too caught up in super long strokes, especially when trying to go faster, because the pull looks a bit weak.  Another part of the equation to think about is just core to kicking strength.  You're kicking but there is some wiggle and it doesn't look like a ton of drive from the legs, which makes me think the core isn't stabilizing you enough.  I think kicking drills keeping in mind drive from the quads and tight middle section of the body (ie your butt) is helpful for that sort of thing.  Good luck!

Low blood sugar - if you're cutting calories, you can get hypoglycemic in the middle of the night. When I was training for half-ironman, I had to get a glass of juice in the middle of the night because I would get the shakes. Heavy Sleep - If you're doing bigger sets, you might be sleeping hard enough that you don't wake briefly to kick off sheets/covers. Premature spontaneous combustion? - might want to keep a fire extinguisher by your bed.... y'know, just in case.   Also, just to cover differential diagnosis - night sweats are a key indicator of Tuberculosis. You should mention this to your physician next physical."

That would probably make it last longest.  I have put my jammer in the wash before and hung it to dry and it was alright. I don't think I would put it in the drier though."

You can also wash board shorts/guard/jammer suits in regular wash just fine, just tie it up before popping it in with regular wash.  You shouldnt need to wash your training suits very often as they can and will stretch with repeated washings. Board/guard suits will fade but otherwise are usually just fine with repeated normal washing."

Swimming,3bpqyu,soy_leche,2,Wed Jul 1 05:53:16 2015 UTC,"The D1 was Dartmouth.   I'm from California, i suggest UCSD or UCSB if you want to get really competitive. When I was talking to UCSD they wanted me at a 21 high by the end of my senior year.   You should definitely email coaches if you haven't already. Express your interest and send them an athletic résumé. Also, if you haven't already make a BeRecruited profile and update your CollegeSwimming account. I've gotten so many views through BeRecruited even though I used the free version."
Swimming,3bpqyu,algag,2,Wed Jul 1 06:00:28 2015 UTC,"I do have a beRecruited and I will make sure to keep it updated. My last question is, should I look for colleges where I am the fastest (top 3) in my events or middle of the pack? It is my understanding (please correct me if I'm wrong) that D3 schools only truly ""recruit"" swimmers who are near their top performers, and the rest are considered ""walk ons"". For example: I was looking at UCSC's recruitment profile and they informed recruits that unless you had a time that would perform well at conferences (<22.0 50fr, <48 100 for, etc) that you would have to try out at the beginning of the school year instead of commiting your senior year."
Swimming,3bpqyu,CaptainCabbage1,2,Wed Jul 1 06:12:06 2015 UTC,"I visited Coach Musch at UCSC a year or two ago and at that point the program wasn't established as much so he told me everyone was a walk on. I didn't especially like their program because i thought it was too laid back even for a D3 school. I'm not really sure about applying based on team placement. When I was looking at schools there were some D3s (eg. MiT, JHU) that needed 2-3 Jr National cuts. You really just need to talk to the coaches and check out a bunch of different programs."
Swimming,3bpqyu,CaptainCabbage1,2,Wed Jul 1 06:30:03 2015 UTC,Maybe look for colleges that will give you the most scholarships for the academic programs you think are the best. Then decide between those which swimming program fits you.

For quick release there is a string hanging off the zipper (you can just pull down that piece of string to unzip). So don't worry about that.  The more important thing is the thickness of the rubber. 50 degrees is really cold, most wetsuits won't be able to keep you comfortable at this temperature.

And it's hard to find a perfect size. I'd recommend go a little too big rather than a little too small. The kind of soreness you described is normal at first, you'll adjust to them. In the meantime stretch, and use a foam roller if you have access to one."

Swimming,3bpbdn,ynot269,4,Wed Jul 1 01:47:53 2015 UTC,"Hey there, it's a start.  One thing I see with a lot of beginners is they have a bad method of breathing. When you swim, you should imagine your entire body being on a pole, and everything needs to turn at the same time. What happens is beginners often try to twist their whole head up out of the water to breathe, which makes their whole body twist out of line. Watching you, you often stopped after the first breath (to be fair, I don't know if this was intentional on your part), which indicates to me that you have trouble turning your body back into a position where you can move your arms easily. Try turning your torso when you swim and just turning your head so your mouth comes out of the water so you can breathe.  When you take strokes, you're flailing your arms. You won't sink and drown if you take it slow while learning proper form. Assuming you know how to float without much bodily movement, you can just take slow strokes, bending your arm at the elbow when it's above the water. Just relax and let buoyancy do the work while you figure out how to move your arms properly.  It seems like your friend is teaching you how to swim as you would competitively (examples: breathe every two strokes, have a beat between your kicking and arm stokes), when in reality you should be focusing on learning to swim the front crawl like you would casually before you try to race it. If you have trouble timing breathing with your stroke at first, take slow laps and hold your breath while you focus on the stroke itself. Then work up to breathing while taking strokes. Don't let breathing when you don't need to destroy your form when you could keep going.  As for the kick, it's pretty horrendous, but we all start somewhere. It looks like your bottom half sinks in the water while you swim, which can result from multiple factors. Many beginners try to look forward while they swim, lifting their face to look directly ahead in the water. Imagine your body as a see-saw, when one end goes up, the other must come down. Tucking your chin so you're looking at the bottom of the pool underneath your head will help lift your legs up. Sometimes, however, the problem may be your legs are simply not strong enough to kick themselves up. Practicing kicking with a kickboard can really help build form when you're starting out. Just spend a few laps each practice kicking with a board so your head is above the water. Keep your legs straight, not bent at the knee, and toes pointed behind you for maximum efficiency (which also means less energy expended on kicking, woohoo!).  Having some gear while you practice can teach your body a lot. Wearing hand paddles will let you move your arms slower and focus on your form while at the same time keeping you going fast enough that you won't sink. They're pretty cheap as well. Flippers are great for building leg muscle. They'll hurt at first, mostly in your feet, but your body will be learning how to angle your feet and use your legs to their best potential. Also, pull buoys would be your best friend, I think. They're little floating things that you squeeze between your thighs to keep your legs up so you don't need to kick. This allows you to focus on your arm form and your bodily rotation without letting your kick throw you out of line.  Most importantly, remember you're just a beginner. It takes a long time to build up a good form. Even after swimming for years I still have things to tweak every practice. It's a slow process, but keep at it. For someone working at it for a week and a half, you're pretty average. I wouldn't have expected much more from the video. There you go, those are my thoughts. I'm sure there are plenty of coaches out there who can explain it better than I can. Also, check out YouTube for any questions you have on form, it's where a lot of people learn just the right tweaks to help them out. Good luck learning."

Swimming,3bpbdn,AquaphilicFlame,2,Wed Jul 1 06:33:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you for being brutally honest, I stopped because I wasn't breathing in air, (at least it didn't feel like it), i was getting water. I notice that I'm not really blowling bubbles as i swim, instead I wait till last minute blow it out, then go back up for air, definitely gonna work on that. Yeah he's super competitive and was on the swim team in high school..  I know how to float, but I'm not exactly above water, my legs sink, etc.  In regard's to the flailing arms, definitely something I'm trying to work on, it's on and off for me sometimes I get it, sometimes I don't.  Yeah my legs are definitely sinking, i try to face down like the water, kind of like how you'd float, so my head is generally in neutral, I'll try to keep my chin tucked in. Working on my kick strength as well. I think the university pool has alot of that gear, so I'll check that out, thank you for the thorough and specific advice."
Swimming,3bpbdn,ician,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:04:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you should take some beginner classes at your local pool to get the basics down, without that base and someone breaking down the stroke for you in person it will be difficult for you to achieve the goals you want. Good luck!"

Swimming,3biyvn,planet_x69,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:27:19 2015 UTC,"What will usually go on the endurance suit is the seam as well it will stretch out around the seam in the rear and eventually go see-through. Since its an all black suit and made with high quality nylon the color won't fade like other suits as quickly.   Much, if not most of the fade and wear in any suit will completely depend on the chlorine content of the water you swim in."
Swimming,3biyvn,lorenorder,6,Tue Jun 30 14:28:51 2015 UTC,"I have lots of aquadiva suits for training and because they're on the expensive side I like to take care of them and ensure their colour stays/the material stays good quality.   Proper maintenance will make a difference to how your suit looks and how long it ultimately lasts. I would recommend buying a good quality suit to begin with so it will last you. When you're finished at the pool, immediately rinse/wash your suit out with water either in the pool shower with you in it or in a sink. As soon as you are home, hang them out to dry (if in the sun, only leave till they are  dry). I definitely notice a difference when I take good care of my swimwear."

Weight Training  You definitely need to get back in high level swimming shape and a shortcut to this is being stronger physically. A few years ago I did P90X and only a few days of swiping a week and I was back to high school times within 3 months.  Swimming training  What are you trying to get better at? Sprinting? IM? Distance? Train those things and start upping your yardage and lowering your intervals. You will get back into the groove if you just follow a progressive training style.  First goal is to get back in shape and get strong, second step is to train the strokes and styles you want to improve at. You'll get there, it just takes some time. It won't happen right away."

It would be a simple drill of putting just their head up to their nose in water and making bubbles through your nose. Practicing this every day eventually makes it second nature for them. I'm sure your friends don't even realize they are doing it, it's so second nature.  Eventually once you master that you can completely hold your breath without water going in the nose because your first instinct won't be to breath in but I would start with that first.  I hope this helps."

Swimming,3beoom,anon0108,6,Sun Jun 28 15:56:44 2015 UTC,As long as you are exhaling through your nose water won't go in. A common mistake new swimmers make is holding all their air in while they swim which actually increases the CO2 in your bloodstream. So if you slowly but constantly exhale your air you will not only keep water out but will also be able to extent your breath control. I teach adult lessons and find that it is much hard to get older people over your fears. For kids the water is an irrational fear but for anyone else we understand why the water is scary and have harder braking that mental block.
Swimming,3beoom,lime_and_coconut,3,Sun Jun 28 18:50:32 2015 UTC,Swimming instructor here! Close your mouth and hum. You will breathe out through your nose. Keep practicing until it becomes instinct! Well done on taking the first step of getting over your fear.

Swimming,3bdzsj,BikeEmeraldCity,2,Sun Jun 28 15:15:21 2015 UTC,The trunks you have are probably fine. It might be good to have a suit designated for racing.

You can also try www.swimoutlet.com (not sure how they are outside USA).

Swimming,3baew6,samboosam,10,Sat Jun 27 08:50:16 2015 UTC,"So a few things that may help.  Kick from the hips, but don't keep your legs completely straight, allow enough bend in your knees that you slightly break the water.  Imagine you're kicking in a bucket. This always works as a great cue. You don't want to take big sweeping kicks, but rather smaller ones.   Kick faster not deeper if you want to move forward more."
Swimming,3baew6,KingDamager,3,Sat Jun 27 09:25:43 2015 UTC,What do you mean kicking in a bucket. Like as if im standing in a bucket but horizontal and my kicks are limited bc of the sides of the bucket
Swimming,3baew6,KingDamager,3,Sat Jun 27 18:54:29 2015 UTC,Exactly this. Obviously point your toes. But like don't kick any wider than the width of a bucket
Swimming,3baew6,planet_x69,2,Sat Jun 27 20:14:09 2015 UTC,a great way to start to learn to kick correctly is to sit on the side of the pool with your legs extended out straight and your butt just about to slide into the water.  With your legs out straight and you leaning backwards kick so that just the bottoms of your feet are slapping the water - you will have to point your toes and seriously use your core  to maintain both balance and the motion.  Watch this at around the 30 second mark - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqQB6JgVNc4  but don't put your feet under water and lean back. This exercise will greatly strengthen your leg muscles as well as your core and you will easily be able to translate the out of water motion into underwater motion.

I realized I was doing exactly what I shouldn't be doing: using my shoulders to pull water towards me, doing some kind of S route with hands through the water.    Read his section about the meathook catch and watch the videos.  My favorite mental picture from the 'meathook' video is that a swimmer thinks about grabbing water and pulling it towards them to advance but this is inefficient.  Rather, a swimmer should think about planting their arm in the water and pulling themselves to and past that stationary point, like climbing a wall.  With a high-elbow catch, your entire forearm and hand create and anchor which the muscles of your trunk pull your body up to and past.    Rotation is important but it's a slight rotation, +-30 degrees I've read various places.    Now that I've made the corrections suggested by his post and the videos, my splits are much more consistent and I've even dropped a couple seconds across my entire swim.  I'm still working on making it more fluid but it's a big difference very quickly."

Swimming,3bafil,conjunctionjunction1,4,Sun Jun 28 19:57:49 2015 UTC,"I used my shoulders way too much to begin with but luckily I had a coach to teach me how to use the right muscles. In all of the strokes you'll be using your lats especially. Put your arm in this position (http://imgur.com/ge2LKzl) and tense your lats. You should find your arm in similar positions in all four strokes (obviously not at the same right angle but in those bent arm positions requiring lat work, even in back where your arm is bent at similar angle behind you). It's a matter of training yourself to use those muscles instead of the muscles in your shoulders and it's a difficult habit to break out of but it will benefit you immensely. When you're swimming, just remember how it feels to tense the right muscles out of the water and focus on using them in. Practice your form out of the water while standing to see how it should feel. It isn't just as simple as changing how your body is positioned in the water but actively training yourself to use the different muscles. Good luck!"

They tore easy and were quite uncomfortable even for speed suit standards.  I think it was just not popular enough for Speedo to want to continue making it."
Swimming,3b95dm,bugchild9,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:36:19 2015 UTC,"The simple answer is it flopped: too much engineering went into it.  A few of the reasons it was made, a new suit means more people buy the newer suit, they put a bunch of engineering into it. So think of it as taking a few of their older suits, looked where they failed and tried to make it better.   What I think was bad about it: it was made for a certain body type, like most suits, but the seams were frail so any other body type would not really ""fit"" the suit.  Again go back to the over engineering part.  Another issue which is actually an issue more with the general use of all speed suits, it got water logged.  This is more of a user error then the suit error TBH. The suit got heavy much faster then most other suits on the market. HOWEVER, if the suit was used as intended, think ONLY USED DURING THE RACE not during warm up (never getting it wet until in the water for the race), it was an awesome suit.   Edit: If you have any specific questions, I may be able to answer."

Swimming,3b4ub3,NotTotallyRelevant,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:06:38 2015 UTC,Everyone... I'd say the NCAA finals times will be around 45 or less
Swimming,3b4ub3,USCswimmer,7,Fri Jun 26 12:37:30 2015 UTC,No way they break 45. The fastest people in the 100 fly and 100 back take it out in 20/21 so let's be generous and say someone is out in 20.5. Breststrokers can maybe come back in a 27 if they're haulin. Freestyler's at best will come back in 21high. Average that and you get 24. That would end up being 44high to 45low but you have to take into account all those times are my swimmers who specialize in that stroke. one of the strokes will be a weak point. I'm saying at best we have a 46.0.
Swimming,3b4ub3,GolfinDolphin,2,Fri Jun 26 15:23:02 2015 UTC,"The fastest backstroke/fly times are around 44,45 while the swimmers who go these times go around 52 in the 100 breast. They can also get around 42/43 in the 100 free. There's no reason to think that a Ryan Murphy/Caeleb dressel/David Nolan/Andrew seliskar could go at least a 45 high to 44 high."

Swimming,3b2u2w,an_undesirable,3,Thu Jun 25 14:51:17 2015 UTC,"If you don't have access to a pool, stay in a basic enough aerobic shape. That can involve running or light weights and such, but nothing will outright keep you in shape for swimming. Only way to stay in shape for swimming is to swim.  If anything, I would recommend you really hit the gym and get some weight training in. Focus on those triceps for awesome pullouts, and biceps for those awesome sculls. Core and back, of course, are always necessary. As a sprinter you would wanna do high weight/low rep stuff to get your strength up, too. Watch what you eat, and generally just try and stay in an aerobic shape and try getting some strength in too."

Most of them have a variety of swimming levels to choose from ranging from beginner to advanced swimmers. With a masters team you are going to be focusing on all the strokes not just fly. With my team, we usually start off with a freestyle warmup, some drill work, then our main set switches between freestyle endurance days and stroke work days. On the Stroke work days we either do IM (all the stroke) or its a choose you own stroke and go from there.   If you only want to keep doing fly only then a privet instructor may be the way to go. With a privet instructor you will learn the proper technique to fly and different drills you can do with it. They can give you some workouts as well. Really what you want to know they will work with you. You'll learn all of this with a masters team as well it will probably just be over a longer period of time.   Hopefully this helps!"

Swimming,3b553w,soundkite,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:32:16 2015 UTC,"Like soundkite suggests, you may have to starting swimming to focus on technique and volume for a month or so.  Let your split times increase a little in favor of putting in a lot of 50m / 100m intervals that utilize the correct high-elbow catch, six beat kick and smooth rotation.  I find just pounding through 100s boring so I do small pyramids, maybe 50, 100, 150, 200, 200, 150, 100, 50 on :40 repeated 2 or 3 times.  Add a warm up of 400 easy something, some kick sets after, maybe 400 and a cool down of 2-300 and you've got a solid swim close to 3000m.    If you keep your technique solid, using a high-elbow, kicking and good rotation, you've building up the muscle groups like lats and serratus anteriod while internalizing the good technique.    Once you can maintain you :37 across your entire main set, go back to a set focusing on speed across shorter distances, I'd suggest little pyramids: (25, 50, 75, 100, 100, 75, 50, 25) x 3.    Also, I don't have patience for the math, but if you explore timing in these pyramids and want to work the clock, there's pyramids that decrease split times going up the pyramid and back down, there's pyramids that increase split times going up the pyramid and drop it going down."
Swimming,3b3tly,Averythewinner,2,Thu Jun 25 19:10:07 2015 UTC,"Do more situps. Also if you have a pool to practice in swim sideways or shortways in it. Basically where you can just pushoff, tkae a few strokes and turn. That really helped me."
Swimming,3b3tly,humma__kavula,2,Thu Jun 25 19:38:49 2015 UTC,"I'm probably nowhere near where you are, but this is what a good flip turn feels like to me :   I try to head butt myself in the stomach. My arms are already at me sides, and I lift them over my head like I'm pulling off a pair of tearaway pants, and trying to make a show of it.  The pushoff feels like I'm stretching my body into a thin string, as opposed to the clumsy feeling of doing a barbell squat against the force of the water.  I aim down slightly, but arch my back a little to come back to the surface smoothly.  Feel regret that I didn't dolphin kick off the wall again. I only have enough breath to either dolphin kick, or flip turn, not both."

Swimming,3b3tly,adchrom,2,Fri Jun 26 21:03:04 2015 UTC,Flip turns are simply just a half somersault. Use the inertia from your last stroke to flip yourself so that you are looking up. Then push off and roll yourself over. It does take do getting use to doing it. But just keep trying to do it faster.
Swimming,3b3tly,Ovil101,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:29:22 2015 UTC,"Okay, I've talked to some coaches and it always seemed that noone was really a hundred percent sure about when to actually turn the body.  The coach I most trust told once said to me that if you try to do two rotations in one, both will be half assed. So I turn over first and then have my feet rotated slightly outward at the pushoff so that I turn as I push off.  For the hands you want them to basically be at your sides. Then, when you approach the wall, they slip toward the feet (as the body folds) and then go into streamline ASAP.   A drill you can do is this. Take a rope and hold it behind your back in a natural position for your arms. Then, as you turn, get your hands (with the rope) all the way to the feet to get it infront of the body. Then just throw them over your head.   You should also try to keep your legs apart and keep a firm distance to the wall. Imagine yourself doing a squat jump. The same distance and leg position should be had at the turn. You do not bend the knees nearly to 90% and you keep the legs slightly apart."
Swimming,3b3tly,maexen,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:57:40 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't be moving on the wall at all, all twisting should be done during the flip, or after the push off, anything else will slow you down and ruin your mommentum you had going into the wall."

Swimming,3b3tly,I_dont_even_know23,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:13:50 2015 UTC,"Competitive swimmer here.  I hope this is freestyle (front crawl) otherwise im sorry and ignore everything.  Firstly, to be more effective in what you're currently doing: Try to speed up as much as you can before the wall, mommentum will help your turn and you can bank some of that mommentum to carry you off the wall.  As for the flip turn itself, your last stroke should be the one where your head should ""follow"" it down and around. You dont want to have your arms at your side and be laying down at any time, you are gliding in the water, and humans glide in water about as well as bricks do, so don't glide into the wall.  Don't look at the wall, once you see the black T make sure you know your stroke count and execute your turn, looking up at the wall is about as efficient as turning right when you want to make a left turn.  A strong ""dolphin"" kick will help propel your turn, do this while you're in the flip motion.  Push off as hard as you can and with your hands locked in a streamline position, DO NOT turn your body on the wall, you should be looking sideways or up when your feet have connected the wall, and when they leave.  Do strong dolphin kicks off the wall and dont breathe off the first stroke, that kills all your mommentum.  Practice practice practice, watch youtube videos, learn.  Hope this helps, good luck at the competition!"

Swimming,3b3zct,Xillenn,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:52:28 2015 UTC,Do you blow all of your air out before you lift your head up?? When I first started out I noticed I was trying to exhale and inhale all in one breath.  Try focusing on blowing all the air out your nose then lifting your head.  Also make sure you are kicking when you are breathing. People tend to stop kicking to focus on the breath and when you do that it causes your body to drop so you have to put more energy into trying to get your mouth out of the water.

Do you have any local pools with diving facilities? Learning to enter the water properly is really important because if you land badly you can wind yourself, cause yourself to blackout.

You do not want to find yourself feeling unconfident before the jump and even worse vulnerable after the jump if something were to happen  like a cramp, or if you hurt yourself from the impact.  Try it in a controlled environment off some diving boards and then once you get the hang of it - enjoy!"

Gives you confidence in that, no matter how deep the water you can always have a rest on your back. learn to scull or Pro sculling slo-mo demo Once you get confident you can start working on the form of your front crawl and back stroke. Apply the basics from floating to make your life easier and swim smarter. No use in thrashing about trying to keep your face out of the water when you can calmly swim with proper form and have energy to spare. I strongly reccomend learing the theory before trying to apply it so start with floating drills and underwater swimming both of these will reveal to you just how important it is to keep your hips as close to the surface in order to swim and stay floating easier"
Swimming,3b1u92,blondzie,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:58:49 2015 UTC,"I cliff dive and must say that a HUGE part of succeeding is CONFIDENCE.  The slightest hesitation (mentally or physically) can lead to things like this https://youtu.be/reWHAcPjR2g and remember this jump is only from 10m.  I've dived from heights lower than that and spank slapped my head so hard that I was glad my neck survived.  My point is that a lack of confidence in your swimming ability can lead to less than desirable results.  Maybe you can find access to a diving pool with softening bubblizer to hone your skills.  Your 'huge fear of heights' is also a red flag and I bet learning to swim will be easier than learning to 3-2-1 no wait 3-2-1, uhhhh, wait wait, 3-2-1 crap crap crap everyone is watching, trip, splash."

Swimming,3b0opi,Shamding,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:53:40 2015 UTC,"I got a Garmin swim watch for my last birthday, and like it quite a bit. It counts laps, tells me my speed, calories burned, etc. It was about $100, but I think there are less-pricy alternatives that have a lot of the same functions.  If your swimmer is an open water swimmer, a swim safe buoy (http://www.safeswimbuoy.com) is a good gift. They are, in essence, a highly visible floating dry-bag, so you a) are less likely to get hit by drunken boaters and jet skiers; and b) you can throw your car keys and stuff that you don't necessarily want to leave on shore in them. I have also found that if you stow a can or bottle of post-swim beer in them, it stays fairly cold, depending on the warmth of the water in which  you're swimming."

From my understanding, they dyed it darker color then what they want because the chlorine would always lighten it in a week or two.  I think their hair became more stained then dyed though."

Swimming,3axcne,mikegymnastics,4,Wed Jun 24 06:50:29 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is with your kicking. Try using the core muscles to keep your legs from sinking, but also try kicking with more power. That should keep your legs in position with your body.  Kick drill without kick board. To focus really on the body position and kicking itself. That can be a useful dril to do."

Swimming,3axcne,adchrom,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:32:28 2015 UTC,"I just set about trying to fix my kick and Timo_12's comment is basically how I did it.    Core exercise on dryland that focus on stability, including this one:  Lie on your belly with arms extended up and feet pointed out.  raise right arm and left leg simulataneously, hold for 2 seconds, drop.  riase left arm and right leg simulataneously, hold for 2 seconds, drop.  Repeat 10 reps, do 3 sets.   Completely agree that kick drill need to lose the kick board but I've found that resting my arms on a pool buoy lets me keep my body position relatively intact but do more kick intervals.    The biggest learning is I was bending my knees too much, not focusing on keeping my legs straight and my feet pointed, and not making use of the up stroke exactly as much as the down stroke.    Also, get fins!!!!  They are awesome."
Swimming,3axcne,Scubadogg,6,Wed Jun 24 18:01:05 2015 UTC,"The majority of swimmers I coach that exhibit this circumstance create positional drag due to head/eye position. Lying on your back on the ground approximates the correct position; one of a connected line from back of head, shoulders, hips, knees, and heels. Often when swimming freestyle, swimmers tilt their head slightly to see ahead of themselves. This results (Newtons Third Law) in the hips dropping slightly, proportional to the angle initiated by the head.   One kicks for three reasons while swimming free: 1) Create propulsion, 2) Create better body position, reducing positional drag, 3) Create a motion that aids in timing, and rotational aspect, of the stroke. Concentrate on #2 to assist you in attaining the optimal position.   Another suggestion is to have someone video-document you while swimming. You can then post it here, or email to a coach to evaluate your stroke technique through deconstruction. I would be willing to offer my service if you so desire. DM me for my email address if you'd like to take me up in my offer."

Swimming,3axcne,mrhandman,3,Wed Jun 24 16:30:30 2015 UTC,"I had/have the same issue!  The things that helped me were drills that helped me focusing on swimming ""downhill,"" specifically drills where I didn't use my hands.  You just kick across the pool with no arms either focusing on just staying rotated to one side, or rotating every six kicks.    Also, do you have a swim instructor?  For me that was invaluable, and I'm not sure how much progress I would have made without that.  There is hope for us thick legged muscular dudes!"
Swimming,3axcne,fnarg,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:05:09 2015 UTC,It sounds like your problem is your body position.  Practice kicking very slowly with your arms at your side.  Take your breath to the side without moving your arms around and then return your head to the neutral position.  Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euM1DdnK58I
Swimming,3axafy,eclipse75,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:23:38 2015 UTC,"This just gave me flashbacks to being 5 or 6 and going through the exact thing. I ended up being a competitive swimming and winning some summer league and high school races. Aw, you made me so nostalgic. Anyway, focus not on ""going up"" for a breath, but rather just turning your head to the side. If you go up, your legs go down. But if you go to the side, you stay horizontal."
Swimming,3axafy,rainbow_butterfly,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:03:24 2015 UTC,so how did you get started? your friends push you? nearby pool? parents wanted you to? what's your favorite part about being at the pool when you were a kid? being with your friends? trying to go faster? sitting on the side of the pool eating a hot dog?  and it just feels like my head is so far underwater i'll just reach up and swallow water.
Swimming,3axafy,rainbow_butterfly,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:10:07 2015 UTC,"I got weekly swim lessons for like 2 years starting around age 6 or 7. My grandma paid for them for all her grandkids because she grew up in Minnesota, land of lakes, and believed in the importance of knowing how to not drown. Your face is supposed to be in the water for most of it. It's scary for people. I was never afraid. As a toddler I tried to escape from my mom to go to the deep en of drowning. I liked going to the bottom of 12 and 15 foot pools, I would swim under the bulkhead when lifeguards weren't looking. My sister is the sane one. Our first swim teacher pushed her to the bottom of the 12 foot to try to get her over the fear. Our teacher also had us learn starfish and learn how to swim in full winter clothes. Once you realize you can starfish and not drown at any time, the fear goes away, and your form can improve. In order to get competitive, I ended up swimming 5x a week. Over the years, I had very experienced, motivating coaches who helped us refine our technique and endurance. One of them swam against Michael Phelps in Sydney in 2000. My favorite part of swimming (besides Water World, of course) was competing in meets."

Swimming,3au8jc,csutswim,14,Tue Jun 23 15:33:30 2015 UTC,Hi! I think it's amazing for you to do this on this subreddit.  2 questions for you.  What are some of your most memorable or most painful distance sets? Specifically for when you were training for the 400 free.  And  Any memorable stories with some of the other Olympic swimmers? I've heard the Olympic Village can get wild when people finish competing.  thanks!!!
Swimming,3au8jc,isnotcreative,17,Tue Jun 23 15:50:50 2015 UTC,"Hi there!   I have so many memorable sets... I think the hardest for me was what we called a power hour. It was 60x50m on 1:00 holding under :30. It killed.   Another type of set that was always really unexpectedly hard was long descend sets. We'd do progressive descend sets like multiply divide and descend 200, 400, 800, 400, 200. You have to double your time on the 200 and go faster on the 400, etc. Then half your time on the way down and be faster. Make sense? I love thinking sets like that where no matter how slow you try to go, you always end up sprinting the last half of the set. It was always interesting when you had to do several rounds where you had to start faster each time.  I don't have a ton of memorable stories from the village besides trading pins with athletes from all different sports and from around the world. I loved striking up conversations with people and learning their story. I didn't stick around for the parties. As an American, if you want to drink or be out past curfew, you have to check out of the village and you're not let back in. I didn't feel like trying to find a hotel room or paying an arm and a leg for it just to stick around for the parties! I wanted to go home, since I had been gone for over a month, and celebrate with my friends and family. I was also 20 and I didn't drink until I turned 21."

A problem I have is even though my technique has improved greatly my times have not dropped significantly since a couple of months ago. My coach suggests that eating more to build muscle would help this issue and I would like to know your thoughts on the matter (and how would you suggest I go about building the muscle, what foods should I be looking out for to eat and not eat?)   I'm a freshman going to be sophomore in High School after the summer if that changes any advice"
Swimming,3au8jc,nmss,7,Tue Jun 23 16:11:01 2015 UTC,"Technique changes take time to apply and then develop the power. Be patient and continue to add power with the new and improved technique.   Diet is crucial to performance and growth. You want to look at making sure you're getting enough energy, protein, nutrients, and the timing of your meals. Combining good quality (not junk) carbohydrates and proteins has always been the key for me. So nuts, PB&J, Chicken and rice, Meat and potatoes, etc. are great options. Make sure you're getting a lot of fruits, and vegetables. And as far as timing, eating a good recovery food or drink right after practice to help build muscle.   I'm not sure how old you are, but if you're still growing, that will be your body's priority before it begins to build muscle.   Just make sure you're getting enough, getting quality, and you're working hard! Everybody's different, so it's hard for me to give you a magic food that will help you swim fast.

Any favorites?"
Swimming,3au8jc,cuberoot328509,5,Tue Jun 23 17:31:08 2015 UTC,"Hi there! Thank you for your questions!  I did a lot of math in my head. I was always thinking of my lap, interval, what my splits were, etc. I think it's really important to be present in practice and focused on what you're doing.   With that being said, my teammates and I would play 'would you rather' or we'd come up with lists of things, or alphabet games. Silly long car ride word games can really make practice fun.   For dryland I love yoga for swimmers. I also like doing combined movements like lunge up into a curl, squat into a press, medicine ball throws are fun too. Things where you have to engage your core. It mimics swimming and the importance of connection and core strength very well."

Do you think you've improved your technique by watching good swimmers and trying to emulate them or by taking tips from coaches and changing what they said?

Swimming,3au8jc,spartanKid,8,Tue Jun 23 17:53:04 2015 UTC,"If I was having a really hard practice where my paces were off, I would just pick a technique to really focus on. So even if I was 3 seconds off per 100 of where I wanted to be, at least I could go home victorious that I improved my walls that day. All hard work brings profit, even if you're going slow. The effort will help you to improve so still give it your all.   It's pretty cool how often you can surprise yourself. Those days where you don't think you could do another lap, you just do, and then you do another, and you just keep pushing and pushing and before you know it, you've finished. The only time I've actually stopped and gotten out was when I dislocated a rib from pushing past my limit a little too much."

Swimming,3au8jc,NorthAve,3,Wed Jun 24 03:33:00 2015 UTC,I'm 15yrs old and i have a 10:03 on the 800m free. My strategy is to wait until the last half of the race to really start using my legs and to pick up my speed each 100m and sprint the last 150m. A few weeks ago was my first time swimming it and I'm only a few seconds away from Junior Olympics; any tips on how to swim this race? (I was also wondering if breathing every 2 strokes for the whole race is bad; I do that for the 500y 400m 800m and 1000y)
Swimming,3au8jc,elven43,2,Wed Jun 24 03:46:45 2015 UTC,"Breathing every 2 is fine as long as you breathe properly and remain balanced. Most coaches like alternate breathing because it helps to keep your stroke balanced.   My advice for strategy is to find the best strategy for you. Everyone's different so experiment with it. Try going out hard and trying to hold it. You're always stronger and faster than you think, so why not go for it and hold on with all your might?! You might surprise yourself. That was always my strategy. Give it a shot. :)"

Would be very interested in hearing about the differences  in pool training, land/cross training, sports psychology, nutrition.etc  How does one go about training for both pool and open water (at a high level) at the same time?"
Swimming,3au8jc,IamPerfectlyLonely,8,Tue Jun 23 15:46:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your questions!   There were only slight differences in my training. In open water, the race is mostly drafting and strategy with the last 500-1000m being sprinting or real aggressive swimming. The idea is to conserve energy and then make a move. This type of training where you're working on being able to switch speeds quickly, efficiently, and dramatically is also  great training for distance races in the pool. I performed very well when I was doing both because open water gives you a great aerobic base for pool and pool gives you great speed for open water. When I decided to stop doing open water, I did focus more on speed work, but there really wasn't a huge difference. I cut out a lot of the long aerobic sets and replaced them with more threshold speed sets. I hope that answers your questions!"

To transition into treading water from swimming you will need to slide your legs and hips under you and then start egg beater kicking.  Right now when you swim you are relying on your arms and legs to push on the water to keep you afloat, once you figure out how to balance just using your core transitioning will be easy."

If you're talking about freestyle/front crawl depth shouldn't matter, since you're positioned horizontally along the surface of the water. Are you asking about stopping and starting mid-lap, or about treading water the whole way? Or are you nervous about the depth?"

Another rant: people complain that the water is too cold so the gym keeps it at like 86 degrees. How do I exercise in bath water? My college's pool is kept at like 72 and that gets hot in the middle of sets. I wish they catered the temperature to people who are really swimming and not just the old ladies in water aerobics.

I'm all for people learning to swim, but I would also like to swim without having to sound like a jerk for asking you to move lanes or risk getting hit or kicked while trying to stay on my side of the lane, especially when YOU CAME IN A GROUP AND YOUR 2 FRIENDS ARE BARELY USING THEIR LANE ALSO.

Swimming,3awvho,mintbbx,2,Wed Jun 24 03:44:28 2015 UTC,"I am going to vote AGAINST you doing anything specifically to lose weight. If it comes off with more training and healthy eating OK but don't deliberately reduce caloric intake. My opinion is based in part on a very recent experience in my family (we are all thin compared to most swimmers) and someone with no risk factors developed a serious, life threatening eating disorder (Anorexia) after attempting to lose a few pounds in an attempt to improve performance. We will never know if the diet caused the anorexia or just unveiled it, but it is a scary mess now. If you lost 15 pounds your BMI would be underweight and getting close to anorexic, which is about 140 pounds for a 6-3 male who is 21 years old. Work on the swimming conditioning and technique and let the weight fall where it does."
Swimming,3awvho,sgren,2,Wed Jun 24 15:24:33 2015 UTC,"This.  I don't get why you were down voted for the most common sense response.  Being 6' 3"" and 150 and a competitive swimmer is unhealthy. The weight is NOT contributing to your being slow. It's your form and conditioning. You will always have body fat, its normal and healthy to carry some.  Elite athletes carry around 9% or so.  Hit the weight room and focus on your drills and form and the speed will come. Shedding the weight will only reduce your energy reserve and not improve your speed one lick."
Swimming,3awvho,planet_x69,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:35:58 2015 UTC,"I was a freestyler ~back in my day~ and all my times dropped dramatically when I lost about 20 lbs. It was awesome.

Don't you get cold in the water being so lean though?"
Swimming,3awvho,rainbow_butterfly,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:55:14 2015 UTC,"I think that if you lose the weight gradually there won't be a problem with your stroke. The only thing I can image is that you go faster, because you have less weight to drag to the otherside."
Swimming,3awvho,Timo_12,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:35:47 2015 UTC,"I am a touch shorter than you (about 186cm) than you and a lot heavier (race at about 85kg), but that is what works for me, it is all about having the correct amount of functioning weight, for you if you can lose weight without losing power you will only go faster.  Having belly fat especially definitely slows you down underwater. Jiggly stuff increases resistance, thats why we wear our racers so tight.  If there is no rush let it happen naturally, but I would be stripping off as much as I could."

Swimming,3ar3qs,Piratebay12,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:08:32 2015 UTC,"Careful though. Banana and Peanut butter are both known to cause migraines..  But if that isn't a problem, dip the bananas in the peanut butter, that makes them AMAZING. Also, make sure to have liquids with peanut butter. If you eat too much at once, it sorta gets stuck, and you get peanut butter hiccups, which are hell on earth.  Don't just stick with carbs. You will have energy for like an hour, then crash. Look for more sustainable foods. Raw broccoli is great, as is any kind of nut. Almonds, pecans, sunflower seeds. Just be careful to again, have liquids, since salted/flavored nuts tend to be high in sodium.  Also, avoid liquid foods (chili,soup,etc.) There is nothing worse than a flip turn with chunky spicy beef and bean chili coming up your throat."

Swimming,3ar3qs,jiyounglife,3,Tue Jun 23 13:48:54 2015 UTC,"Yep. I was getting a lot of calf cramps last year when I returned to swimming after a really long layoff (15+ years). I reached out to an old trainer friend and one of the things he suggested I try is mustard. He said he keeps a bunch of packs in his trainer's bag as it can work very quickly. Now, I have read articles suggesting that mustard doesn't work, but it seemed to really help me and my trainer swears by it (and he is very experienced).  Of course as my trainer told me, the best way to prevent cramps is a good diet and proper hydration. Things like skipping meals, poor diet in general and not drinking enough water will definitely contribute to cramps. For me, I try to keep a couple of protein bars in my car and will eat one on my way to practice if, for example, I missed lunch. When I was a kid I used to eat a Wendy's cheeseburger, large fries and a Pepsi on my way to swimming practice. But those days are long over. If I tried that now I doubt I would last too long in practice. Getting older (51) means having to change a lot of bad habits that I could get away with in my younger years."

As far as keeping your hair healthy, definitely keep rinsing after every swim, and use the right hair products. The hair products should be a bit higher end if possible; the shampoo and conditioner you find at department stores, like Pantene, aren't always the best."

To keep my hair from doing whatever, I twist my hair starting on each side at the shorter bangs in front, incorporating longer strands towards the back, and then I use 2 or 3 hair bands to keep the ponytail in place.

Swimming,3as31i,geekyhistorian,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:39:31 2015 UTC,"I agree...please don't put conditioner in your hair before swimming.

Swimming,3appiq,AndersonIV,5,Mon Jun 22 14:27:30 2015 UTC,"There aren't really going to be any golden workouts that are going to immediately improve your sprint free. However, one of the most important things you can do in practice is being dynamic.  I happen to swim for a Division 1 school and was lucky enough to train alongside a guy who was one of the fastest 50yd and 100yd freestylers in the NCAA this past season. The type of training we do is very dynamic. One week we will focus on training endurance aspects. i.e. doing sets of 200s or 100s pull trying to hold a fast but consistent speed. Other weeks we will focus on pure speed. Sets of 25s on power towers or cords with some racing at the end of practice. Sometimes we would just do a meet warm-up and then race 2 or 3 100s all out against each other.  I'd love to help out some more. What kind of equipment do you have access to? Also, what age are you at right now? This is important for what kind of development you're going through as far as weights, dryland, etc."
Swimming,3appiq,Golden_Eagle,2,Mon Jun 22 15:16:22 2015 UTC,"Just turned 17 years old a few weeks ago . I have a pull-up bar, 20 pound dumbbells, 10 pound ones and my body weight( 5'6, 121 pounds (on average)). I can access flutter boards and I'm going to invest in fins soon for a better dolphin kick. Thanks for the help btw"
Swimming,3appiq,Golden_Eagle,4,Mon Jun 22 19:13:03 2015 UTC,"So as far as weight training stuff goes, I'm going to leave the decision to lift up to you. For weight style training, we usually do a lot of low-rep/high-weight exercises such as olympic lifts and body weight exercises. Stuff like Cleans, Snatch, Trap-bar Deadlift, Back-squats, etc.   However, I think one of the best things you can do for yourself, and sounds like it will work well with you, is bodyweight training. Pushups, pullups, plank, box jumps, etc. Core work and explosive workouts like box jumps are pretty critical. You really need to establish a strong core if you want to maintain your stroke on top of the water throughout the race, especially in a 50m pool. Your core is really where your power comes from because that allows you to maintain your legs, keep yourself up in the water, and rotate your stroke efficiently. I can't stress those things enough.  Also, explosive exercises like box jumps are really going to help your start and your walls. For a 50m freestyle the turn is obviously a non-factor, but that makes your start more important. Starts are something you can work on all the time. Doing a race set? Do the last few from a start. It really is the little things when it comes to sprint races.  Now for more in the water stuff. Like I said in my earlier post, mix it up. Sprinting is fun, because sprinters do a little bit of everything and get to do all that weird stuff. I used to be a miler/400imer as a younger swimmer, so I've seen the whole spectrum really. Some stuff that is really going to help you in the water though is first working on your technique. You really need to make sure that your stroke is efficient and takes advantage of your own body type. If you don't have very long arms, try to focus on making your stroke rate faster and more powerful. The fastest 50yd freestyle relay split was by a guy who was 5'10"", and he could do it because his stroke rate practically doubled the other guys. I'm not saying to spin your arms for no reason. You just need to find the right balance for YOU in the water. Find your comfort zone and work with it.  As for sets, you need to have an established aerobic capacity. You don't need to be able to knock out 40x100m @ 1:15, but you need to be able to maintain your stroke effectively. Do sets like 12x100m swim on an interval where you only are getting around 10 seconds rest, and see if you can descend the whole way through. This is a very general and basic set, but simple endurance sets can help you out a lot.  Moving on. You also need to establish your anaerobic capacity as well. Now this is going to be stuff like pace work. This is the stuff to see how long you can go fast while getting more rest. Doing things like   3x   4x50m @ :55 hold as fast as you can  100ez   This would be a main set for the day, probably after a good warmup and a few short sets, but the focus is to see if you can maintain high speed for an extended period.  Lastly is the really fun stuff. The pure speed stuff. For speed days, it's all about short, fast, and to the point. Doing starts, full-speed turns, breakouts, etc. Getting up and racing is one of the biggest things you can do. You need to teach your body what it feels like to race and what it feels like to go super fast. After a solid practice, throw down 2x50m all out on like 6min. Throw on some fins and do a 100m for time off the blocks. Getting a feel for the water at high speed and at near or faster than your best time will make those big day races feel that much better.  And the way we kind of did it training wise for the 3 different styles was to have a week of aerobic, a week anaerobic, and a week speed. This was during the pure training phase of the year. Taper is a whole different beast. But anyway, if you have any more questions, feel free to ask. It's really hard to get into this without going into so much detail because every swimmer is different, and everybody has different opinions, but I'm just taking some of my experiences that have worked for me and worked for others and trying to help out with that. Hope this helps!"
Swimming,3appiq,laycswms,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:57:25 2015 UTC,"Pushups, pullups, plank, box jumps, etc   I've been doing those for a year now and they've worked.     your own body type   So considering my height, I would probably need a higher stroke rate (my dad is also 5'6 so I dont see myself growing too much).     simple endurance sets can help you out a lot  maintain high speed for an extended period   seems fair, I've been always slowing down when ever there were 5 metres left into the race     3 different styles   makes sense, I guess I've stuck with the same training and need to mix it up now"
Swimming,3appiq,ButtDozer,3,Tue Jun 23 01:23:12 2015 UTC,"When I got stuck or seemed to reach a plateau it was either because of my start, turn, or something I needed to adjust outside of the pool. Mostly, it was outside of the pool, so here are some options that I have used in the past that don't include times.  I would recommend examining your dryland workouts. A past coach encouraged core, arm and shoulder workouts. It isn't a quick fix, but getting stronger over 8-12 weeks can make a huge difference. For instance, On a 10 x 100 set, I'd get really exhausted on number 6, once I got stronger that exhaustion threshold moved back to 7.   The second tip I have is to look at your technique. Are your legs dropping?   And don't forget to get pumped! Swimming is fun...even when we gripe!  Good luck!"
Swimming,3appiq,Golden_Eagle,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:07:47 2015 UTC,"I'm working the legs dropping. When I was a kid, I used to swim leisure swim all the time and I would always be conscious if I was gonna hit someone and so I developed bad posture with my head (looking up). I'm starting to get rid of this bad habit because it makes my legs sink.  For strength training, what kind of core, arm and shoulder workouts do you recommend specifically?"
Swimming,3appiq,ButtDozer,2,Mon Jun 22 19:18:29 2015 UTC,"Im going to disagree with golden eagle regarding swim training (but his weight advice is good). Golden workouts: Lots of 50m (on like 3 minutes full recovery) and 25m/15m especially at max speed with perfect technique. Increase strength to body weight ratio w/explosive dry land and lifts. Perfect yojr body driven or shoulder driven free (see Mike bottom or the race club for details).  Doing 12x100 will do NOTHING to improve your sprint stroke and that is indisputable--unless you swim the 50 like a 400. Your 50m free stroke cannot and should not be held beyond 50m and thus you are working on a different technique when training 'slow'. Slow swimming will make you better at recovery though; it isn't a waste of time, just understand the role of slow aerobic swimming (anything slower than your race pace for the event you're trying to swim is slow swimming imo).   My fastest sprinting was when I was swimming 4 days a week w/low volume and lots of lifting. It's also way more fun to swim fast and lift heavy.   Edit: not advocating USRPT. I don't think that is the best training method for the 50m free, though you should read up on it to get some ideas."
Swimming,3appiq,Golden_Eagle,2,Tue Jun 23 05:24:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can see what you mean by that. When I replied to him first I was writing from the perspective of someone doing maybe the 50 up to the 200. But you're right, if we're talking at improving quickly at the 50m and 50m only, then focusing on pure sprinting will be beneficial.   However, I wouldn't say slow swimming is useless. It's about how you work it into your routine. I see far too many guys who can't hang on during races because they have no aerobic base whatsoever, but this can be trained through just hammering in sprints every day as well. I wasn't really sure of the poster's aerobic background, so working in some aerobic capacity wouldn't be totally useless, because it will later on allow you to hit those pure Sprint practices harder and longer.   Swimming really is so unique to everyone and I think that's great, and I think people should take all advice with a grain of salt. One of the things I hope the OP got from my post is that in practice you need to find what works for you. Because what works for you might not work for anyone else. And most of all, you need to have fun with what you're doing. Sprinting is super fun, because it's the fastest swimming there is, so we should be having fun doing it :)"

Swimming,3appiq,cuberoot328509,2,Tue Jun 23 15:50:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think slow swimming is useless. Aerobic base is #1 for future success and recovery. Florent manadou has a massive aerobic capacity and used to be a 200IMer (reluctantly I might add). The guy pushes sub 2:00 LCM 200 frees with ease. His coach ,Romain Barnier, has a great lecture at FINA online regarding the training leading up to 2012 at CN Marseille. They do a LOT of cycling to work on aerobic endurance w/o breaking down technique or injuring your hips d/t too much kicking.   I have just seen so many kids who were never going to go above a 100, and really only swimming 3 50s freestyle as per high school swimming events get ruined by over training their freestyle."
Swimming,3appiq,cuberoot328509,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:55:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think we're both on the same page here really. I gave the advice for more aerobic swimming because I was assuming the OP didn't have a huge aerobic base. Last summer I actually incorporated a lot more dryland and cycling/rowing into my workouts with less swimming and ended up having my best season yet this past year. But during the actual season we also incorporated a lot of the aerobic/anaerobic/sprint weekly cycles and so on.   This is all my own personal experience which is why I encourage OP to give things a try and find what works for him. We have vastly different body types and vastly different aerobic bases, so it again makes it important to be dynamic and find what fits.   Also, Manadou is basically just a freak haha. That dude has been on fire in his sprints. Looking forward to where he's at next year."

Swimming,3apvth,kleighr,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:23:23 2015 UTC,"I am a rising junior (girl) in high school. I've been swimming competitively ever since the summer of seventh grade.  Oddly enough, I have the same problem! When swimming butterfly, my coaches told me that I have an alternating kick. So I decided to do some research on it and start from there.  Although I can't really tell you its cause, I would say that it might be because of pure habit - that's where mine originated from, at least. It may be because you haven't worked on kick enough, too. If that is the cause, then try building up your kick into your workouts over time (but not all at once!) To fix the alternating kick, I tightly tied a strap around my ankles when swimming fly. This keeps your feet together, as well as make them aware that before they weren't doing the correct kick. After a while, you'll get used to wearing it, and your feet will start to stay together after being forced to.  You can use just about anything to tie your feet. But make sure it stays on! From what I've heard, Amazon sells good ankle straps, just make sure you get the right size (you can look up Pulling Ankle Strap by FINIS for a good one, around $10). But if you don't want to get one of those, you can always use a bandana. I have been using one lately and it works great! Just tie it tight and double knot it! Either one you choose, it would be helpful to spend a couple of sets on butterfly kick and drills. If you're really feeling brave, you can start on swimming normal butterfly with the strap/bandana on. After only two practices with the bandana, my kick wasn't alternating that much. But it's important to keep working on it so that it doesn't come back.  Hope this helps!"

Ours is $100 ($150 for non-YMCA members) for the entire summer Masters program. It's 6 workouts a week but realistically no one can go more than 4 a week since they're MWF @ 6AM, TuTh @7 PM, and Sat. @ 6AM. (A 7-8:30PM practice followed by 6-7:30AM the next morning is not realistic and ain't gonna happen.) Our Tu, Th, Sat practices have a coach on deck and I always find them to be more productive than the uncoached practices.  Our coach's philosophy is always ""this is Masters swimming, you do what I tell you to do...unless you don't really want to."" Still, even at my age there's something different when a coach tells you to swim 5x300s compared to when another swimmer in the morning suggests that same set as we all negotiate our practice.  Regardless, in my opinion there is no comparison between trying to swim on your own and swimming with a Masters team--coach or no coach."

Swimming,3amg4s,jared0h,2,Sun Jun 21 18:32:38 2015 UTC,"Generally girls are actually faster up until about 13. Since girls hit puberty earlier they tend to pull ahead. However, when the boys hit it they grow significantly more and get much faster."
Swimming,3amg4s,Shadowslight3x,5,Sun Jun 21 18:34:22 2015 UTC,I think it is probably a touch earlier than that. In every event at Australian age nationals the 12/13 Boys are faster than the girls and they get similar amounts of entrants (around 40 most events). That is also compensating for the fact that more girls than boys swim in Australia.

The motivational times are based on percentiles like standardized testing that account for all of USA Swimming. On average boys are faster their whole lives.  They are closer at younger ages.  In my experience 13-14 year old girls are MUCH faster in practice however...probably because they are more mature.

If you have a big pool session your back muscles are used a lot so you might get sore muscles but they should recover.  One way to help is to ice them or go in a plunge pool if you have one available.

Swimming,3ahege,Pulseidon,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:05:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not a trainer or a coach or anything just a high school swimmer and collegiate water polo player, but I'll give you what I try and do whenever I have been out of the pool for a little too long.  When I first get back in the pool, I set a reasonable goal for total yardage that I would like to do each time I get in the water that week.  Throughout the week, I try and achieve that yardage in a different way each day I swim. By that I mean, I might focus on a set of hundreds one day, focus on kick and pull the next, possibly stroke the next day, etc. It's just important that you don't do the same set everyday. Each day should always consist of a warm-up and cool-down however. Each week I try and increase my total yardage by about 200 to 300 yards. For me, this helps me work towards a reasonable goal and allow me to ease back into swimming.  What I am saying, is that it doesn't matter what you do, but set a goal and try to increase what you do over time."
Swimming,3ae605,NintendontRy,9,Fri Jun 19 11:41:12 2015 UTC,"I would concentrate more on the swimming portion if you've only been doing for a year. You'll see surprising results from improving your technique, which is something that takes years to master.  Until you have really good technique and endurance, doing cross training won't do that much for you, to be honest.  That being said, running is an excellent way to build up endurance. I used to run 5 miles before getting in the pool in the afternoons, but that wasn't until I was 17/18...  Sorry if this isn't the answer you wanted to hear; best of luck either way."

The key to all of these exercises is not quantity, but making sure that you have good form.  There are a variety of arm and torso weight sets that will help with both butterfly and freestyle but you are somewhat limited in the upper body dryland activities that will be really useful."
Swimming,3ae605,humma__kavula,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:52:09 2015 UTC,Back and shoulder muscles mainly. For shoulders just keep your ROM good and it'll help avoid swimming injury. Chest for fly. But like most people are saying work on form frst.

I agree, with those who say that technique is huge if you are still relatively new to the sport or in general honestly. However, that wasn't what Op's question was. So heres my answer for the original question. Which is dry land for FR/FLY  If you have someone (maybe a coach or a parent or older sibling that can teach you Weights, I would start there. Shoulders, chest, back and core will go a long way in the power dept. Especially if you have a weekly routine, it doesn't take much weights to feel a difference in the pool and it will go a long way. Focus on good form and light weight and you will feel stronger and more confident in the water amongst all your strokes. It's also worth mentioning that some people don't have the strength to do perfect butterfly technique. So keep at it in the pool but work in some weights into your weekly training regime. It doesn't need to be real intense to see results in the water."

Swimming,3ae605,Schnoobs69,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:36:39 2015 UTC,"You don't need to do cross training unless you really need to. If you don't have the fundamentals down perfectly, like stroke and things like that, you should work on that rather than your strength. The  problem with most people is that they jump the gun too much. I'd probably suggest on working on stroke technique and working on tempo rather than building muscle. As a younger person myself, technique is what carries you. Muscle and  strength are second in the hierarchy of swimming. But if you really want to know, work on your core/abs. The core is what you work the most in fly, and pretty much every stroke. Planks are a fantastic way to work your core, as are sit-ups."

Swimming,3aaann,chrom_ed,2,Thu Jun 18 17:17:16 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere (lost in the annals of time) that a good speed for an amateur breaststroker is 20 min / km. I think it took me a couple of months of going 2-3 times per week to hit it, but I now use that as my minimum goal (when I go a lot) or my target (when I've not been for aaaaaaages, like recently). I'd wager you could probably improve on that in not much time; you have age on your side (I'm late 30s) and you undoubtedly have a much better kick than me (mine is awful!). Go for it!"

Swimming,3a7pxm,kingofthekarts,23,Wed Jun 17 21:51:53 2015 UTC,Very relevant and intriguing story.  I don't know a lot about the achieved results of hormone treatment but would they be effective enough to make Bailar a swimmer that can actually compete within the Ivy League? Because 24.45 50 yd free and a 1:03.10 100 yd breast won't cut it in the Ivy League; or really any D1 school for that matter.
Swimming,3a7pxm,Harriet_Chubman,12,Wed Jun 17 22:39:56 2015 UTC,"Trans male athlete here. In general, enough time and testosterone will give a trans guy the same capacity for muscle growth as a typical non-trans guy. I get mine tested every year and it's in the average male range. My lifting progress is about what you'd expect for my age and experience.  There are obviously other differences between the average trans and non-trans male body, such as frame size and limb length, but if you take two guys with roughly the same frame—one trans, one not—the non-trans guy will likely not have a competitive advantage. I'm guessing we'll start to see more competitive trans male athletes now that the stigma has lessened. Chris Mosier just won a spot on the men's duathlon Team USA."
Swimming,3a7pxm,not_a_big_fan_of_GOT,3,Thu Jun 18 01:30:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight, I was hoping someone with personal experience could provide some information.  Now when you say ""enough time"" will allow a trans guy to achieve the same muscle growth, would you say that it is around that 1 year measurement that the NCAA has in its rules of competition for transgender athletes, or is it on a much longer time scale?  Also, I would love to read about your personal experiences on how testosterone treatment affected your athletic performances.  Basically, were you aware at certain points that you were achieving significant performance increases or was it the same incremental and slow progress that people observe without hormone treatment?"
Swimming,3a7pxm,Harriet_Chubman,5,Thu Jun 18 02:19:09 2015 UTC,"Re: your first question, it's hard to say exactly and there are a lot of individual factors, but it's in the order of years. Think puberty. Whatever his training regimen, I don't think a year would be enough to compete with guys who have been training and packing on muscle for years. Even if he has the same potential for muscle growth, he's still got to catch up.  Re: your second question, I only started weight training (and, really, exercising at all) after I'd been on testosterone for several years, so I can't really speak to how it feels to start T while already on a weight training program. My initial gains were insanely fast, but that's pretty much what you'll hear from a non-trans guy who starts lifting for the first time.  Any other questions, let me know!"
Swimming,3a7pxm,not_a_big_fan_of_GOT,2,Thu Jun 18 02:42:27 2015 UTC,"such as frame size and limb length   Are there sports, where that would be an advantage?

Swimming,3a7pxm,uhtt,3,Thu Jun 18 18:43:26 2015 UTC,"Are there sports, where that would be an advantage?   Not necessarily ""smaller vs. bigger"" but certainly there are some sports where your physical build does produce an advantage. Michael Phelps, for instance, is what, 6'4 with a 6'8 wingspan or something crazy like that?  Likewise, being 5'10 and having an inseam of 34"" really helps for a runner.   The only sport I can think of where having a smaller frame would be a significant advantage would be gymnastics. And I doubt you'd see a trans athlete in that because most high-level gymnasts would be training the gender-specific equipment from a very early age."
Swimming,3a7pxm,Tullyswimmer,2,Thu Jun 18 21:41:39 2015 UTC,"Interesting question. I've thought about this a few times. But the differences between trans/non-trans male frames are average differences, so it's completely possible for a particular non-trans male to have the same proportions as a particular trans male. In other words, there's a lot of overlap. I can definitely think of sports in which a small frame is an advantage—Olympic weightlifting and equestrian sports come to mind—but it's not like it's impossible or particularly unlikely for non-trans males to be that small or for trans males to be larger. (I'm 5'10"" and I'd be shit at being a jockey.)  The only significant advantage I can think of is genitals. I'm a triathlete and I imagine that not having a set of balls is more comfortable on a bike. I'm just guessing, though. I have no idea."

Its Code of Conduct says, “discrimination against any member or participant on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, and gender expression is prohibited (304.3.3),” meaning that trans swimmers can participate in whichever gender’s events that they identify with.   I have to assume they just follow the guidelines for their physical gender when it comes to suits, as others have mentioned."

Swimming,3a7pxm,ifallalot,18,Wed Jun 17 22:17:14 2015 UTC,"NCAA policy for trans student athletes:   A trans male (FTM) student-athlete who has received a medical exception for treatment with testosterone for diagnosed Gender Identity Disorder or gender dysphoria and/or Transsexualism, for purposes  of NCAA competition may  compete on a men’s team, but is no longer eligible to compete on a women’s team without changing that team status to a mixed team. A trans female (MTF) student-athlete being treated with testosterone suppression medication for Gender Identity Disorder or gender dysphoria and/or Transsexualism, for the purposes of NCAA competition may continue to compete on a men’s team but may not compete on a women’s team without changing it to a mixed team status until completing one calendar year of testosterone suppression treatment.   So a trans woman could compete on the women's team, if she has been on hormonal treatment for at least a year. And while testosterone is a PED, it's also necessary medication for many people, and those who need it can get a medical use exception. This medical exception applies to both trans men, and to cisgender men with clinical testosterone deficiency."
Swimming,3a7pxm,tgjer,7,Wed Jun 17 22:24:06 2015 UTC,"Yep. Saying testosterone should be banned for trans male athletes is like saying that having testes should be banned. The amount of testosterone a typical trans man is prescribed leaves one with no more testosterone in one's bloodstream than the average male. If hormone therapy gave you super-strength, there would be a lot more elite trans athletes!"

(The pain that arises from water getting into your nose)   You shouldn't have any water going up your nose when underwater. In order to avoid this, practice slowly breathing out through your nose while underwater. Water can't get in when air is going out. Swimmers rarely actually hold their breath while swimming. They are breathing out when their head is underwater and then take a quick breath in when they bring their mouth out.    How do you avoid arching your back extremely? Because I feel like that is preventing me from kicking my legs all the way up that and that fact that I was kicking with my knees.   Arching your back a bit is ok, but you shouldn't need to arch that much if you keep your head looking down. Your body follows your head. If you look up, the rest of your body will sink. Also, you shouldn't kick with your knees. Your legs should be kept straight and kick with your thighs."

As for the back arching part I think i get what you mean but i think i may also need to work on the water in the nose part first because I'm still a little scared to my water face down in the water, I just get this weird panic attack that makes me think I'm gonna sink. I think I'm gonna practice floating on my stomach next time i hit the pool, with my face down. Anything else you'd recommend to practice?

Swimming,3a8xme,rainwater739,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:54:55 2015 UTC,"I'm a beginner too. To help me with my fear of sticking my head under the water, my instructor taught me a few tricks.   Go to the deep end of the pool and hang onto the edge with both hands. Slowly lower your head beneath the water while breathing out. Don't let go of the ledge. Hold yourself like that for a long count of 5 and let out air only from your nose in a gentle trickle. Then bring yourself back up. Repeat 15-20 times.  A more advanced technique is similar but really forces you to stay calm. Hold on to the edge of the deep end of the pool with both hands, and keep your body fairly vertical. With one motion, push down and away from the edge while breathing out. Let yourself sink for a slow count of 10. Then using only your legs, propell yourself to the surface and back to the edge of the pool. Repeat 15-20 times.  These techniques have really helped my breathing and have improved my comfort with the water.   Edit: I forgot to mention: I do both of these before I really start swimming. It gets me into the mindset of swimming and breathing properly. If I don't do it, I tend to struggle more with my breathing.  You can also lengthen your time under water with these techniques to help strengthen your lungs and to better prepare yourself for longer times swimming. Right now I do 20 seconds under the water for each style and about 20 times."
Swimming,3a8xme,IQuoteMyself-Myself,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:48:17 2015 UTC,If you are talking about breathing on you back then water will almost always get into your nose. Water never really gets into my nose when I'm face down in the water. As for not arching your back you have to have a strong core. Also swimming can be hard for people who are all muscle because you need flexibility and you can't muscle your way through it. You need to learn the proper techniques.

I totally urge you to stick with this, as you are starting a journey in the pool full of more and more incredible feelings of achievement while getting in the best shape of your life.  I agree with others that floating with your head underwater is a great way to get used to the feeling.  Perhaps try some laps with a kickboard while facing down to give you the peace of mind that you are always at the surface and can quickly catch a breath.  Also, have you ever used a snorkel mask?  These masks aren't meant for swimming laps, but they do protect your nose from water penetration.  Snorkeling might get you more accustomed to breathing only from your mouth and teach you to avoid snorting water through your nose (which is about the only thing I know would case the pain you describe)."

Swimming,3a8gm6,BakkenMan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:43:50 2015 UTC,"I've been a swim teacher for over four years, and recently became a swim coach; you have an interesting question. I think it's not a completely bad idea, as it will help you learn the rudimentary way your arm enters the water, but overall you shouldn't do it. Before you even learn freestyle, or front crawl, you should practice rotary movement. Swimming side glide, where you have one arm extended with your ear roughly on the shoulder, other arm on your side, able to breathe the entire time, as you swim on your side should be practiced first. This is approximately how you will breathe on freestyle. Then practicing side glide switch, in which you swim side glide for a few seconds, then do a freestyle stroke onto your other side is a good way to develop the upper body muscles and rotating movement needed to do an effective freestyle. Using a snorkel lets you bypass this crucial learning step. If you can get into a freestyle in which you breathe every 3 or 5 strokes on alternating sides for a few laps then maybe you're ready to practice with a snorkel."
Swimming,3a84pb,koolaidman47,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:47:29 2015 UTC,Are you looking up to breath or looking to the side?
Swimming,3a84pb,dingleberryjuic,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:38:03 2015 UTC,"I am looking to the side, but my timing is bad. I can't really inhale for long enough when tilting. My instructor also had me work on rotating my body so my head would be in a better position. Also, I have perpetual nasal congestion which makes it difficult to breathe through my nose. Hopefully, that wasn't too confusing."
Swimming,3a84pb,dingleberryjuic,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:44:20 2015 UTC,"Not at all. I too am a 20 year old college student, but don't worry I swam for a long time and have been a coach/instructor for the last 3 years.  Starting with that back pain, it is amazing how much a little extra strain on a certain joint or set of joints can cause problems. The most common one I see is improper hand rotation causing shoulder problems while doing freestyle (front stroke). So if I were to guess where that back pain is coming from, it would be improper rotation of the body/head. Having improper sync could cause extra strain, leading to stiffness.   That bad timing could cause an overall shortening of the time when breathing. There is more to consider than that though. That lack of air could be coming from just overall bad timing with your breath. Breathing in the water should work just as you would on land. Out under, in when your head is out. Also, when you tun your head and look up it can cause some throat constriction, so try and keep your chin close to your shoulder.   As for the lessons, if you are serious about learning to swim, having someone to critique you will always help."
Swimming,3a84pb,soundkite,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:43:10 2015 UTC,I will see if my instructor has any tips to help my rotation and breathing. He says that it is improving but it may have been so bad that there was nowhere to go but up.   I was curious what you (and others) thought about group swimming lessons versus one-on-one private lessons? I have done group lessons so far and its helping but I wondered if one-on-one was worth it?
Swimming,3a84pb,itsaworkthrowaway,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:13:58 2015 UTC,"You first need to determine if your issues are due mostly to mechanics or fitness.  You'll get much more useful responses here, too, if you list the answers you've received from your group instructor to your above questions."
Swimming,3a84pb,itsaworkthrowaway,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:16:46 2015 UTC,"My instructor said it likely could occur from being in a sedentary lifestyle, a nice way of saying I am out of shape, though I have been exercising more lately. The movement was also new to me. So I think it's a some of both, as I am inflexible (which will not get better overnight) and obviously don't know how to swim yet. Furthermore, prior to my first lesson, I had not been in a pool in at least 4 years.  Today, he said that I was doing much better with my arm strokes but that I need more practice turning my shoulders simultaneously so I can take more breaths.   An aside: I bought goggles and broke them after 2 days of use"
Swimming,3a84pb,itsaworkthrowaway,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:01:13 2015 UTC,"When I started swimming I couldn't make 50m (~50yards) without sinking because I wasn't breathing in enough, turns out I wasn't exhaling enough under water so when I came up to breathe I wasted valuable time exhaling.  I don't know if this will help you.  I find group lessons i.e. squad to be more encouraging as it is competitive but private lessons will probably give you the most form development.  Good luck!"
Swimming,3a84pb,itsaworkthrowaway,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:27:39 2015 UTC,"I think I am exhaling enough through my mouth, but nose is congested so I cannot easily exhale through my nose. This is likely throwing me off. I do not notice that when I completely stop, I am  pant heavily."
Swimming,3a5rbl,jahu_len,6,Wed Jun 17 13:14:57 2015 UTC,"I'd go with this. Just a simple letter from your ""coach"" saying something like ""[Your name] swims 3000 yard workouts 3 times per week. He has been swimming for 15 years, competitively for 2 years.""  If it's a more serious competition I would throw in some times like ""His 100 free time is xx.xx"" etc for whatever events you will compete in. I don't think it sounds too serious, though."

Swimming,3a7kob,Timo_12,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:35:45 2015 UTC,"I think one of the best ways to increase speed is interval sets in the water. Sets like 2x(5x100m) at 1:35 or something. Make sure you swim at 80/85% and that the rest is only 5/10 sec. Dependent on the stroke you are swimming you can also change the time.  Otherwise dry land practice is a good addition. You can focus more on bodyweight exercises(squats, push ups, core exercises etc...) or you search for dry land practice with Jason Lezak. That is also a good program."

Swimming,3a3i9j,Triweb,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:28:22 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but I have no idea what to suggest you try. I was never one of those kids who could burp on demand just by swallowing a gulp of air. Perhaps you are unknowingly swallowing after you take a breath? Are you doing a lot of hypoxic work (breathing every 4+ strokes)?"
Swimming,3a3i9j,Triweb,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:06:08 2015 UTC,Every 3 strokes. I think I could be swallowing air as habit. I sometimes catch a bit of water which I end up swallowing as well.
Swimming,3a3i9j,yosoldja,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:13:45 2015 UTC,"I wonder if you are exhaling completely underwater before you turn your head to breathe. No idea if that could be the cause, but it's something that came to mind after my previous post. Also, you might want to try burping out the air during your swim (at the wall, not while you are actually swimming!). If nothing else it might reduce how much air ends up in your intestinal track later. At least according to this link (believe at your own risk), burping can reduce farting. https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110129180540AAn3ndq"

Swimming,3a0sgx,splashrat,8,Tue Jun 16 09:41:31 2015 UTC,"I'd personally say you may just not have feel for the water rather than not having muscle. Not being a regular swimming it may just take time to get back in to it.  If you can only do 75m before dying I'd recommend doing sets of 25s and 50s to build up fitness. Maybe at the end of every session or other session. Take 5 mins rest before trying to see how far you can swim then get out.   Relax and try and build up slowly, no need to kill yourself every session/length :)"
Swimming,3a0sgx,No1Gooner,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:26:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly. I know you are not questioning it but joining a club was one of the best decisions I've ever made. I now swim with the Highschool kids (like 2-3 years younger than me) and it is just like I am in school again. The training is hard but doing insane sets with a group just bonds you to the rest of your squad like nothing else, really.  As I started out I was craaaaaap. I am still crap for my age (20) but you gotta go through being shit in order to become somewhat decent :) The work in process is what is the most fun!"

But that is why we train, for a while it is going to be pretty tough and you will really struggle, especially if you can't swim 300m straight but with time it will improve.  Basically just temper your expectations and get started, try your best to hit the ground running (but you wont) and just get it done.  Putting it off isnt going to make it any better."
Swimming,39zznt,dodohee,2,Tue Jun 16 03:53:17 2015 UTC,"M, 5' 7"", 32y, 168 pounds.  I have lost just under 30 pounds in the last year by swimming and better diet control (literally no other types of exercise except walking).  I'm at a point where I'm not ecstatic with my body fat percentage but more interested in improving my swimming so I'm not at a calorie deficit for the next couple of months.    My normal swim is about 3400 yards and I do it 5 times a week on average, sometimes less, sometimes more.  Takes an hour with drills and all.  I warm up slow for 400y, do various main sets at high intensity that are around 2000y, then do kicks and backstroke to cool down.  Various calculators suggest I should be around 2700 - 2800 calories which is roughly what I eat to maintain.   When I want to start losing weight again, I shoot for 2400.   It is absolutely not true that you can eat anything, especially when you leave your 20s.  You have to be swimming twice a day for an hour or more to sustain the kind of diet where you can just eat anything.  I'm not starving but I still weigh myself every day and if I creep up a couple of pounds in a week, I have to be good the next week.    I stopped calorie counting but still vigilant!"

Swimming,39zznt,Sharkey311,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:50:47 2015 UTC,"I started swimming again after a 2 year break just over a year ago.  At first it took me a while to get up to 1500, where you are now, probably about 3 months in I was consistently doing that.  Then I set a specific goal: 100m in 1:00.  To get there I started looking at swims that would help me build endurance and get faster and I ended up with a 2400 set.  Then about four months ago I realized I was still gassed in my last 25m of a 100m when swimming flat out so I figured I'd up the volume for a couple of months.  Now that I'm there, I'm hoping to get a little faster and be able to squeeze in an even 4000m in my hour.  But, aside from it makes me feel great, I keep coming back every day because I really want to hit my goal.  But in the end, with all the swimming I do, I can still eat enough takeout and go out for drinks enough to put on a couple of pounds in a week.  Diet is el numero uno for weight loss.  Good luck!"

Swimming,39zznt,adchrom,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:16:30 2015 UTC,"It all depends on your goal.  If you like the idea of getting faster, the trick is to do it in small increments at about 80% of your fastest time with no more than 15 second breaks.  If you try to keep slugging out 1000m straight each time you swim, you don't really give your body that ability to either build strength or technique.

Swimming,3a0edl,liferay,3,Tue Jun 16 06:27:34 2015 UTC,"Fly should be kept as flat as possible, not diving down into the water and not coming too far out. The higher your head comes out causes 2 problems - legs drop and cause resistance and it's tiring lifting your head out too far.  2 good drills are single arm fly. All the stroke is the same but one arm is by your side or out in front whichever is comfiest. You can focus on the body position and the body movements without the unbearable arm pain. Second is fly scull, effectively still fly but You don't bring the arms out. It's worth googling fly scull drill to understand more.  Lastly work on your fly kick. It's such an important aspect of fly and once it's strong enough you'll find you kick your arms forward and your head follow naturally.   Hope this helps, any questions just ask!"

If you increase the power from your kick and the end of your stroke (while your hands are more toward your hips). It should help alot.  Like others have said it's important to keep it flat just keep that in mind.

To put things in perspective, when I started swimming competitively in around 1969 no one wore goggles, even in practice. I think it was around 1970-71 that people started wearing them, but never in meets. The first ones I recall seeing looked like WWI aviator goggles. They were made out of brown rubber, and were huge. And what now seems like second nature, diving off the blocks without losing your goggles, was a difficult trick back then. By about 1973-74, though, everyone wore goggles in practice and a few years later no one was swimming in meets without them.  And for you younger swimmers who have never swum without goggles, you cannot imagine how bad your eyes can burn after a long workout in an over-chlorinated pool.

I grew up in Canada but moved to the US 9 years ago, so my very first yards race was at age 48.

My 200 IM is 2:25 SCY and my 200 free is 2:06, which are respectable but not super-impressive results for the 50-54 age group.  Good enough to qualify for USMS Nationals, but nowhere near placing top 10.  But that's a goal for future age groups..."

Swimming,39yv1s,JackaroeD,2,Mon Jun 15 22:18:03 2015 UTC,"Male or female suit? Do you need a ""performance"" suit or just a workout suit? No need for anything expensive when just training.  For males, I like the Speedo Endurance. Seems to hold up fairly well, though my last one is pretty well ripping at the seams at this point. I have a Sporti one as well that is a water polo suit and is a tiny little thing, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend it unless that is what you're looking for."

Swimming,39x6n6,porsaskoski,5,Mon Jun 15 15:09:17 2015 UTC,"I don't have a swim watch, so all of this is conjecture but...I assume the watch only gathers data from the arm it's on and thus has no idea what's going on with the other arm. If this is the case, it doesn't know if your arms match as in fly or are separate as in free. So the way it must choose between the two is the shape of one arm's stroke. The power phase of both are nearly identical, but they differ in the recovery. My best guess is you, like many swimmers new to fly, have a more straight forward, free-like recovery than the straight arm, out-and-around recovery of good fly."
Swimming,39x6n6,BikeEmeraldCity,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:26:31 2015 UTC,"Right, good thinking. I will pay extra attention to my recovery during my next swim."

Swimming,39w2zk,WhaleMeatFantasy,6,Mon Jun 15 07:14:30 2015 UTC,So what exactly should a swimmer do before swimming? Static stretches? Are arm swings bad for you or just not as good as previously believed?
Swimming,39w2zk,Blue-Purple,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:45:06 2015 UTC,"We do a lot of rolling on a foam roller. Other things to raise heart rate and blood flow are things like medicine ball throws or slams, jumping or skipping. Low impact.   Static stretching isn't great but you can 'pulse' in a static stretch. This is finding the point just as you feel the muscle is tight and just very small 'pulses' to stretch it slowly without ripping.   Some arm swinging is ok. For example a simple forward and back can be fine to loosen off. But monkey swings is putting your shoulders in an unnatural position.  Personally I stay clear as there is other ways of achieving the same goal without the risk."
Swimming,39w2zk,No1Gooner,9,Mon Jun 15 12:29:41 2015 UTC,I do a lot of competitive swimming and over the years active stretching has become less and less popular. Before every session now my club do 'blood flow and rolling' we use a foam roller for 10 minutes just to loosen off and softly warm up the muscles. We then do some jumping and TRX exercises to get the blood moving.  Arm swinging can cause injuries as its forcing your muscles and joints into unnatural positions that can damage them. The last thing you want before a morning session where the muscles aren't loose or ready is pushing them beyond their boundaries.   If you want more info on the best way to do pre pool just ask :)
Swimming,39w2zk,No1Gooner,3,Mon Jun 15 07:28:46 2015 UTC,"I find my groin and hips are always very tight, and my back is always sore ... I almost exclusively swim front crawl, 6 days a week. I'm happy with my stretching regimen - perhaps you could recommend some warm ups for my back and hips? I was surprised to hear ""arm swinging"" is not recommended - though it makes sense. Dips? Standing squats? Sit-ups?"
Swimming,39w2zk,yangYing,3,Mon Jun 15 12:44:17 2015 UTC,I think he meant you should warm up your back through back-specific foam rolling and TRX exercises.
Swimming,39w2zk,TriangleWaffle,2,Mon Jun 15 13:04:51 2015 UTC,The exercises you mentioned are great for strengthening your back but as far as stretching it buy a foam roller from Amazon. So many athletes have them nowadays and it's a great way to self massage your back.   Google the hip flexors stretch as its s great way to loosen off your hips. Sorry I can't provide a link right now.
Swimming,39w2zk,No1Gooner,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:41:53 2015 UTC,I'll give a foam roller a spin ... thanks :-)
Swimming,39w2zk,yangYing,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:22:46 2015 UTC,I do a third world squat for 2-5 minutes before and after a swim.  Looks kinda odd squatting in jammers staring at the pool for five minutes but it opens up my calf muscle and forces me to activate my core.  I'm pretty sure this would qualify as an active stretch though but it feels good so I'll keep doing it.
Swimming,39w2zk,adchrom,0,Mon Jun 15 14:54:00 2015 UTC,Actually it would be a static stretch since you aren't moving (at least if it's the stretch/activity in thinking of)
Swimming,39w2zk,ShwimmingAway,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:05:45 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. I can see that understanding of best ways to prepare has changed but do you know why active stretching is actually discouraged?
Swimming,39w2zk,avataRJ,4,Tue Jul 7 03:16:44 2015 UTC,"Rotator cuff exercises are also great for warm-up, though probably not as the first thing. In many stretches, there is a problem with swimmers being taught to stretch to extreme angles or getting used to the ""stretching feel"". Neither is necessary or may even be harmful. Stretching works even if you don't feel the muscle tensing up - and in case of people with high pain threshold, stretching until at pain rips muscle and does not stretch. Extreme angles are simply unnecessary, as (maybe except some medium distance fliers) you don't need ever to pull your arm behind your back."

Swimming,39vpqa,triGuitar,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:35:46 2015 UTC,"You'll be fine. I would suggest swimming twice this week, with at least 1 day of rest between your last swim and the event--2 days of rest would be even better, or maybe a real easy 400-500 meters the day before. Go easy, and do open turns in your swims this week. Maybe 1,000 meters the first time, 1,500 meters the second time, broken up into 100s or 200s. You are not going to accomplish much, but anything more than that and you will be worse off than if you simply do nothing between now and the event."
Swimming,39vpqa,Triweb,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:31:34 2015 UTC,Yikes.  Maybe get the most buoyant wetsuit that still gives you decent range of motion.  Every bit of energy you save to keep your hips & legs up is energy that you can use to propel you forward.  It will also make trending water or doing backstroke easier when you need to slow down and recover.

Swimming,39vpqa,swimmmmer,2,Mon Jun 15 05:06:26 2015 UTC,"Wait a minute. The guy hasn't swum in over a year and you're telling him to swim 1-2 hours per day, twice a day if he can, for a mile swim in 5 days?

Swimming,39vpqa,Triweb,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:27:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about non-stop swimming. Spending 1-2 hours in a pool swimming as much as he can in that amount of time will help greatly. If he had more than 5 days, he could ease into it, but since he doesn't he needs to push himself to practice swimming until he can make a mile comfortably. Swimming isn't easy and I know that. I'm a soon to be collegiate swimmer myself, but I know the only way to reach a goal in that amount of time is to push past your comfort zone"
Swimming,39vpqa,swimmmmer,2,Mon Jun 15 17:50:42 2015 UTC,"p.s. I think you are too young to really understand what it feels like to return to the pool after a really, really long layoff. Also, I think it's actually harder (initially) for someone with a swimming background to return to the pool because they usually still have good mechanics but not the arm endurance for those mechanics. For example, a long stroke will put a lot more stress on the lats, and high elbows throughout the stroke is a lot harder on the deltoids as compared to someone with inefficient mechanics (e.g., someone dropping their elbows while pulling)."
Swimming,39vpqa,Triweb,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:38:41 2015 UTC,Yes the lats are underdeveloped but the only way to develop them in the correct way again is to swim more. Am I wrong? Plus it only works the muscles. It isn't tearing away at the cartilage like bad technique would. Therefore the more swimming you do before the 'big event' the better because your body and muscles will be more adjusted to the water and the strain
Swimming,39vpqa,swimmmmer,2,Mon Jun 15 22:32:05 2015 UTC,Not from 1 week of adjustment.
Swimming,39vpqa,Robert_L0blaw,-1,Mon Jun 15 22:59:05 2015 UTC,It's better than not pushing yourself to achieve that goal

Nothing is changing physically in the next 5 days so you can really just try your best to get a little comfortable in the water again."
Swimming,39vpqa,jared0h,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:41:18 2015 UTC,"I know you did not mean non-stop for 1-2 hours, as there is no way he would make it that long. But it's absurd to suggest that someone who has been out of the pool for a year jump back in and start swimming 1-2 hours every day, 5 days in a row. You can't push yourself in a crash attempt to get in shape in 5 days. At best, he wouldn't be able to lift his arms over his head by the end of the week. At worst, he'll injure himself and never even make it to the starting line."

Swimming,39u1f3,CharlatanAlley,2,Mon Jun 15 04:57:33 2015 UTC,"So I concur with others, you need someone to physically look at your stroke and tell you what to do.  That said the one thing I personally tell someone who is learning to do is learn how to scull.  This may sound weird, but it is the foundation of a lot of things you will learn.  It is the art of proficiently pushing water.  After that you can focus on a lot of things, like your catch, that seem to be expert things that really aren't expert.   get to the other side of the pool. kick to the other side of the pool. learn to breath to the side learn to scull refine your stroke via your new understanding of ""feel""   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm2SbWU6Raw"

Swimming,39ssak,panter219399,18,Sun Jun 14 12:24:00 2015 UTC,"Yes. swimming with your head in the water (ideally, aka with good technique) keeps it in a neutral position. Even when you swim breaststroke, ideally your head isn't supposed to move up for you to breathe, you push your entire upper body up using your kick and core. Your head shouldn't be breaking that neutral position. If you continually swim breaststroke with your head raised above the water, long term you are putting strain on your neck, which can really mess with your back. Learning good technique does take time, but you will learn it faster if you keep your head in the water vs out. Also, keeping your head raised can make your hips sink in the water, impacting your entire alignment in the water and make it harder for you to actually swim."
Swimming,39ssak,ArchitortureGirl,2,Sun Jun 14 12:47:58 2015 UTC,thank you very much!
Swimming,39ssak,ArchitortureGirl,2,Sun Jun 14 15:16:06 2015 UTC,"No prob! You mention problems with technique, if you can't afford lessons you can ask a friend to film you and try and compare to technique videos to analyze what is wrong with your stroke. I hope that helps!"
Swimming,39ssak,kentrel,7,Sun Jun 14 19:58:04 2015 UTC,Yes. Learning good form is essential. I once swam a mile with my head above the water. Holy cow that was a painful few days afterwards

Swimming,39ssak,cburtltop,4,Sun Jun 14 15:16:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, it would put a lot of strain on your neck. Ideally your neck should align in a straight line with your spine when swimming to keep it in the natural position to reduce strain."

Swimming,39q10v,isosceleseyebrows,29,Sat Jun 13 17:12:44 2015 UTC,"Reading the rulebook in section 101.5, you just can't swim any of the previous three strokes.  The wording looks vague, so my personal interpretation is that since what you are describing isn't technically breaststroke (as you would be DQ'd for swimming that way in a 100 breast), you would be okay to do so.  Since the rule looks so subjective, I'd check with the head official before every meet, since he/she will be the one who would make the final ruling on the stroke anyway."
Swimming,39q10v,radiatorcheese,14,Sat Jun 13 18:26:12 2015 UTC,"OP has a good point. One of the oddest rules I've seen. What does it mean for something not to be butterfly? Like, can I trivially break the rules on a single stroke or does my swimming have to not look like butterfly at all? Also, what is the point of having this rule when anyone competitive will be using front crawl anyway?"
Swimming,39q10v,Negotiator1225,3,Sat Jun 13 18:39:41 2015 UTC,"Similarly, I don't really understand why you have to stick with a single stroke in a freestyle race. Why can't I do IM if I like? It's certainly not an advantage."
Swimming,39q10v,VerilyAMonkey,5,Sat Jun 13 21:36:17 2015 UTC,"You pretty much have to try to get dq'd in freestyle in order to actually be disqualified. As long as you break the surface prior to 15m (fun fact: there has to be an official standing at 15m, in order for this to be applied), touch the wall at the turn(s), start and finish in you lane, don't push off the bottom of the pool, and finish the prescribed distance, you'd be okay"
Swimming,39q10v,anoldoldw00denship,2,Sun Jun 14 02:41:32 2015 UTC,My teammate did a whole 50 bk underwater because there was no official at the line. The head official couldn't DQ him for the underwater butttttt he ended up finishing on his back but underwater and there's the new rule where you have to finish with some part of the body above the surface. So he got DQ'd even though his time was way faster. :(
Swimming,39q10v,dolphinboy1637,2,Sun Jun 14 04:46:07 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure you can swim an IM in a freestyle event

And when he had to swim the mile fly at practice, the coach gave him the option of getting out but his parents were already pissed at him for something so he stayed in figuring ""what's the worst that could happen"". He was then told to swim fly until he was stopped. Coach just didnt expect to have to deal with something regarding a business he owned and forgot about the swimmer. It just equaled out to a mile."

Swimming,39q10v,Gnimhey,2,Sun Jun 14 06:36:24 2015 UTC,"what is the point of having this rule when anyone competitive will be using front crawl anyway?   I think that's part of the reason why the rule is written so vaguely.  At almost all levels of competition, the swimmer will be using the most efficient and fastest stroke, which will end up being the front crawl.  They don't need to tell you want to do -- you're just going to swim free anyway.  As long as you adhere to the other rules (need to break the surface after 15 yds, touch every wall, etc.) you're good as long as you aren't doing one of the other three strokes.  As an additional note, if OP is faster at breaststroke than they are at free, I'm guessing they are more likely in one of the earlier heats.  Unless something egregious happens, I've found that most officials are a touch more lenient during some of those heats, as many of these swimmers are till trying to get the hang of things."
Swimming,39q10v,Bubbay,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:56:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly, there's no reason for the rule then if no one reasonably fast would want to break it anyway."
Swimming,39q10v,Negotiator1225,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:19:54 2015 UTC,So actually my dad was head official and was the one that I had a conversation about this with. He doesn't know either and when he's asked around he's never gotten a straight answer.
Swimming,39q10v,Super_Pie_Man,9,Sun Jun 14 00:50:08 2015 UTC,"It's probably legal, but ask the ref before the race about it. In the mean time you should work on that freestyle."
Swimming,39q10v,anoldoldw00denship,4,Sat Jun 13 19:13:50 2015 UTC,"This is a really good question. As someone u/radiatorcheese said, I would ask the meet ref before doing anything. As a newer official, my first instinct was that I'm not sure. As officials we are constantly told to give the benefit of the doubt to the swimmer. I think doing what you described would yield a no call by some officials, based solely on the fact they aren’t sure. After processing what you are describing and mentally reviewing the rules, I was able to come to come to conclusion.   In my opinion, if you violated the rules of the stroke and kick portion of BR, you wouldn’t be doing BR. I see you suggested doing multiple dolphin kicks at the start and a one hand finish. The problem with limiting to just this, is that you’re not affecting the stroke itself. You’re only doing a start and finish that would be legal under freestyle rules (assuming you don’t remain underwater past 15m). I would suggest looking at the rules of BR and doing the opposite in terms of what the stroke is comprised of:   Kick: Rule 101.2.3 dictates that the feet must be turned outward. Therefore, if you were to do a dolphin, scissor, or alternating kick you would be breaking this rule.  Stroke: 101.2.2 indicates that there must be a stroke cycle of 1 arm and 1 kick. I could see an argument of a broken stroke cycle making it not BR.  You might also be good if you did one or more other things that are mentioned in the rule (head below surface, elbows breaking surface, arms past hipline.  Going back to your original question, I think if you did it you wouldn’t get called about half the time based on officials not being sure. If you were to get called, 90% of the time you could probably make a good case that the rule is vague and have it overturned."
Swimming,39q10v,unionjak,4,Sun Jun 14 02:34:59 2015 UTC,I'm gonna be honest.. It your breastroke is faster than your freestyle then your breastroke isn't fast either.   Maybe you like it more than freestyle!?
Swimming,39q10v,sgren,2,Sun Jun 14 05:10:17 2015 UTC,"If you continue to use dolphin kicks after the pullout the whole 25m with breaststroke pull then you would not have used any of the previous strokes even for a portion of the length, and really could not be in violation of the rule.  Are you faster dolphin kick/breast pull than legal breast stroke?"

Swimming,39q10v,radiatorcheese,-1,Sat Jun 13 18:14:25 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of the rule that it can't be any of the previous strokes, I'm under the impression that you can't be DQ'd in freestyle as long as you don't touch the bottom. I could be wrong, and your league could have strange rules, but I don't think you can get DQ'd"
Swimming,39rm4g,soundkite,4,Sun Jun 14 02:05:03 2015 UTC,"Advice: Do fly. Do a lot of fly. Do a long practice where you do nothing but 25s of fly on 30-45 seconds, with breaks. If you literally can't lift your arms, finish the length then do freestyle for a while.  Don't make yourself sustain fly for longer than 25 m. That can come later. For now, look at the clock, do 25m of fly, and repeat 30-45 seconds after you first looked at the clock.  It'll hurt the days after, but it will increase your endurance.  The set I did of this that helped me most was 12 sets of 25 25s, with 100 easy in between each set of 25."
Swimming,39rm4g,Gnimhey,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:32:59 2015 UTC,"This is good advice. Once you're comfortable doing sets of 25, you can start doing sets of 50 where you do 25 fly + open fly turn + take a few fly strokes then transition to freestyle or one-armed fly. (I personally prefer transitioning to freestyle here. One-armed fly is hard to do properly, and if you don't do it properly you risk ingraining some bad habits.) Have a set number of strokes in mind and work at increasing it over time until you can start doing full 50s with ease. The same kind of set will work for 75s, 100s, etc.  The important thing to keep in mind is: never swim fly with poor form. If you feel like your stroke is falling apart, transition to freestyle. Sloppy fly = developing bad habits, shoulder injury, ..."

Swimming,39rm4g,rattazzios,3,Mon Jun 15 10:04:57 2015 UTC,"As a beginner, fly is going to be tough. If you don't have the proper kick you can hurt your shoulders by making them work too hard. it's not just a fly kick. It is also the movement of your body. It is difficult to explain without hands on. Let's say you take your kick then you pull. Your pull is not just arms. there is body movement. If you are just kicking and pulling without any help from the body you can hurt yourself. This may not make sense at all since we cannot actually work at this. But if you have bad form or a bad kick this could be the reason your shoulders hurt"
Swimming,39rm4g,AndersonIV,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:19:35 2015 UTC,"Good news is my shoulders just get tired, no pain.  I do need to take video my form, but I'm pretty sure I have the kick and pull timing ok, probably still need better body/hips movement.  When I start to get tired, I find that I try to glide a bit to reduce my ""stroke rate"".  Sometimes I nail this glide, but other times I slow down too much."
Swimming,39rm4g,Daveyup,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:32:58 2015 UTC,"moderately strong swimmer, can swim a freestyle mile with ease   I am so much like you right now. I would also like to ask for the people replying to this post, do you have any tips for the small kick?"
Swimming,39rm4g,AndersonIV,2,Sun Jun 14 19:05:18 2015 UTC,"If by the small kick you mean the second kick in the stroke, I do have some tips.   Don't think of it as a kick. Beginner butterflyers tend to have trouble with the kick as a whole, which I think revolves around them thinking about the kicks as just legs. If you look at younger kids (I'm not saying you guys are younger kids, just an example) their butterfly kicks tend to be based in their knees. The kick in fly is all based in the body motion. It's less of a kick if we want to talk semantics, and more of a roll that gets pushed through the legs. I struggled with this for a long time when I was younger but as I started to develop my core got a lot stronger. And then it alll made sense. It's all in your body. It's very hard to explain in text, but let it flow through your whole body (very much like a dolphin kick mid-stroke). The small kick is sort of a made up element in the stroke (at least as far as my coach has taught me). Your kick power should be consistent.    I kind of went into this thinking  I had more but that's it. Full body, consistent power. (I have a feeling that some people may disagree with my statement that the small kick is made up, I'm just sharing what I have learned and what has led to success for me)"

I didn't enjoy swimming at all but now that I have improved so much I am really starting to like it. These tips from my coach have really helped me along.  -Streamline off the wall with your arms out, biceps tight to your ears  -After you streamline and resurface, take a couple strokes before breathing  -Don't look forward underwater, rather straight down  -Finish your stroke completely, almost like putting your hands in your pockets  -Keep your elbow above your hand throughout the entire stroke  -Don't cup your hands or spread them out to much during your stroke, stay relaxed  -During your stroke when your hand enters the water make sure they don't rise up  -When breathing try to leave one side of your goggles in the water  -Finally don't be afraid to go slow, If you can't do it right slow you will never be able to do it right fast"
Swimming,39ptxt,reedum150,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:46:14 2015 UTC,"Just building on the last point, a good technique (for freestyle) is to stretch as far as possible just before you put your hand in the water. So when you turn your body to breathe, as your arm is moving through the air you stretch as far as you can, hit the water and drag through all the way, then repeat for the other side. Hopefully that makes sense, it's something my coach told me a while ago."
Swimming,39ptxt,mxCastiel,4,Sun Jun 14 07:24:30 2015 UTC,Really try to focus in on using proper technique (try to find an experience swimmer to help you out or at least study up on technique) as you're starting out. A lot of new swimmers just kind of get in the pool and go for it and end up learning a lot of bad habits.   It's a lot easier to learn things right the first time around than to have to relearn them down the road.

During the season, I join a recreational program at my local swim club which is just at the right level to push me to improve to get in competitive. I would suggest look around at your local clubs' website or email them see if they have any swim camp at your level over the summer and join one. Then when you join one, communicate a lot with your coach so they can help you achieve your goals and be ready for competitive try outs. Please keep in touch, I thought I would never find a swimmer in the same situation as me :)"
Swimming,39rfto,DickSleeves,4,Sun Jun 14 00:57:23 2015 UTC,"Distance is all about power per stroke.  Slow down your strokes and make them stronger, your kick should also be strong, but not all out. Focus on power instead of shear stroke rate.   Instead of trying to go as fast as you can then dying, try to pace, and with time you will get better. During practice try to slowly increase the speed at which you regularly swim at, starting during warmup. Also, dont forget to have a very small glide during distance, if your arms never stop moving they will get tired very easily, so practice catch-up freestyle to help.  I hope this helps, dont be shy to ask questions."
Swimming,39rfto,I_dont_even_know23,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:11:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this is really helpful. How do I bridge my sprint speed to my distance pace? For awhile now, my distance pace has felt like a completely different stroke. Like when I swim a sprint set I feel like im using a different set of muscles then when im doing anything pace."
Swimming,39rfto,ButtDozer,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:20:47 2015 UTC,"Your 200/500 (hip driven) stroke IS a different stroke than your 50 (shoulder driven). Your 100 might be a hybrid but is probably closer to your 200 in LCM while the SCY 100 should be more shoulder driven like your 50. Keep these neuromuscular patterns distinct. Want to improve your distance training and pacing ability? Get on a bike (stationary or otherwise), improve your kick, lengthen your stroke and pull a lot of water efficiently as possible."
Swimming,39rfto,I_dont_even_know23,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:46:31 2015 UTC,"The only difference between your distance and sprint stroke should be the speed that you do them.   Think of a distance as your sprint, but just dont go all out on your arms and legs. You want your stoke to look the same regardless if its a 50 or 1500.  I would suggest trying to slow things down, pehaps fins might help with bounce/awkwardness. Eventually you'll just get the hang of going smooth with powerful strokes and it will click, but don't expect to be a god at both sprint and distance.   If you're upperbody is dominante, use fins for a while to focus on handposition and body position in the watter without drooping down and bouning ( a bad habbit that I and many other have ).  If you are kick dominante, try doing kick while focusing on power per kick and slow down the tempo without letting your speed drop like a rock.  If you seem like you can't handle the pain, thats a different story. Sprinting focuses on all-out efforts that will only hurt for a bit but a lot, distance will hurt at a medium to large amount the entire way through, you must ignore the pain and focus on technique.   At the end you just need to get used to it, you won't be a god at both but you can be decent at distance and excellent in sprint easily."
Swimming,39rfto,Bluebuilder,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:49:17 2015 UTC,"Right on about power per stroke.  In distance swimming it's the little things that add up over time, like fine tuning your streamlining and controlling your breathing so that you can nail your turns maximizing any opportunity for distance and efficiency.  Remember distance swimmers aren't going as fast as sprinters, so you don't get the benefit of reduced drag from hydroplaning.  I would try slowing down your pace a lot in workout and get used to swimming sets of 500s and 1000s, while really thinking about pace, snap and body position.  You will need to train yourself to hit a pace that you can sustain and not burn up all the oxygen in your blood in 30secs like a sprinter does.  Once you figure this out, you will be able to swim for miles while maintaining an aggressive level of intensity."

For me aerobic training at first was just above warm up pace, doing 3/4k main sets at only a slight increase in heart rate.  It's been a few months now and I can do 5/6k main sets at a higher pace but still keeping my heart rate low. The main problem I see with sprinters attempting aerobic/ distance sessions is thinking that pace has to be fast and then dying off.   Fitness comes before pace and fitness in swimming takes time. Try to get your meters up first and then try to build on your distance pace"
Swimming,39rfto,mansaf87,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:17:09 2015 UTC,"Try to do sets of 10-20 x100 at a pace that gives you 5 seconds rest. Your goal is to work at bringing the pace down. This isn't going to be easy. One thing you can do to help transition to a tighter pace is to lower the odd numbered repetitions. For example, let's say you're doing 10x100 on the 1:20, and you're having trouble going down to 1:15. Then try 10x100 where the odds are @ 1:15 and the evens @ 1:20. It's important to not think of the evens here as ""relief"" (which is something you might be inclined to do if you're a sprinter).  One thing worth keeping in mind though is that doing a lot of these sets might start to affect your sprint times. It's hard to train for both distance and sprint events at the same time. So maybe you'll want to focus on one type of event per season."

Swimming,39q5n0,Railmouse,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:24:35 2015 UTC,"I was you exactly last year, down to 19 years being out of the water, and a former smoker. It was tough to realize I wasn't nearly as strong a swimmer as I used to be, and I wondered if my lungs were permanently ruined and not capable of performing like they used to.   Basically, it really just takes time. I picked up running to help my endurance/cardio (I did the /r/c25k program and ran slow as hell because I really thought I was dying if I went faster), and I would just alternate 50s of swim/kick/pull for about 2 months and swim as long as I could. I worked on technique - it had fallen apart on me. Then I joined a Masters team, and it's been a slow improvement since then. I had my first meet in 20 years last January, and recently did a 5 mile open water swim.   Just be patient. The process is fun."
Swimming,39q5n0,gertrudeblythe,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:59:14 2015 UTC,"I too was you about 18 months ago. (But not a smoker.)  For me the key was to join a Masters team. 45-60 minutes was about my limit the first couple of practices. But it really only took about three weeks for me to be able to swim 3,000 yards in practice, 3 times a week. And three months after I swam in my first Masters meet.  The big problem I think experienced swimmers have when returning from a long layoff is that you have good technique but not the muscle endurance to match that technique. For example, you probably have a pretty long stroke compared to someone less experienced but that nice long stroke works your lats and upper arms a lot more.  One suggestion is to swim sets of 100s on a long interval, and simply decrease the interval a little bit each practice. Open turns are allowed too!  And don't forget to throw in some kick sets. You'll get there quicker than you think."

Swimming,39lv76,dogballs8,8,Fri Jun 12 17:23:23 2015 UTC,"Breathing is a complicated factor in front crawl. For a novice learning the stroke, breathing every two is fine. But the very next step in the learning process is incorporating bilateral breathing. Once you're thinking about doing multiple laps for exercise, you should definitely try breathing on an odd number.  Aside from the shoulder strain of breathing to one side exclusively, bilateral breathing balances your body out. As you get more tired, your body will start ""pre-rolling"" to your breath side, causing a larger hitch in your stroke as you go. Your brain is telling you ""get to that air you need to breathe!"" and you'll unconsciously develop the bad habit of just swimming on a tilt.  Secondly, bilateral breathing gives you more flexibility to breathe. A breath on 3, 5, or 7 is a big lung capacity difference than 4, 6, or 8 when you're pushing yourself. It is always good to have an extra tool in your toolbox that you're comfortable using on the fly rather than forcing yourself to stay to one side!  Lastly, I wonder if your coach is asking you to breath every 3 because you're defaulting to breathing every 2. Doing two strokes exclusively is not good, since from the get-go you're basically forcing air in and out so fast that you're hyperventilating yourself and not giving your lungs enough time to absorb and use the oxygen you're trying to take in! 3 strokes is generally considered the minimum number of strokes you should take per breathe unless you need that extra breath every once in a while to keep going. You naturally exhale over a couple of seconds, so if you have your breathing under control, you shouldn't try to gasp the air in and force it out all within the time of two strokes."
Swimming,39lv76,LiveToThink,3,Fri Jun 12 17:53:52 2015 UTC,"All of that, and I'll add that balance issues will cause you to not swim in a straight line. I know that all too well - it's all fine in a pool lane, but if you do open water swimming, you will find that you need to correct your trajectory more often than someone who breathes both sides."

Swimming,39lv76,MarceNobre,3,Sat Jun 13 22:22:26 2015 UTC,Breathing to only one side can cause shoulder injuries. Since you switch shoulders that shouldn't be as much of a problem. I also thing breathing every other stoke is inefficient compared to breathing every three.
Swimming,39lv76,purpleoceangirl,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:33:44 2015 UTC,"I'm a competitive freestyler and have never been fond of breathing an odd number. I'm from the United States so is yards I'm taking 12 strokes a length and breathing every 2 vs every 3 is 2 breath difference per 25 that I'd rather not lose. So I bilateral breath by 25, left side down, right side back, keeps the shoulders balanced overall, and I get as much air as every 2."
Swimming,39k0oi,blue_eyed_jap,4,Fri Jun 12 07:10:01 2015 UTC,"Have them do backstroke kicks while lying on their backs on the deck, then the same thing but facefirst on the deck hanging half off the edge, then with a kickboard."
Swimming,39k0oi,Gnimhey,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:34:46 2015 UTC,"^ This. If they still don't get it, lay them supine in the water and support their neck while having them kick, and address any corrections in the kick before having them try it face-down."
Swimming,39k0oi,AndLaura,2,Fri Jun 12 14:31:47 2015 UTC,"One idea that can help is that kicking is a lot like drumming. A fast drum beat requires you to have tight arms that almost shake. If your arms shake to the point of vibration, there won’t be a solid sound to the beat. You have to hit the drum hard enough to make a good tone! At the same time, if you drum with really big swings (like recovering the stick high above the drum) you can't possibly get a fast beat. A good drummer is fast and loud. Translating that to the flutter kick: every time you splash (a lot of power is generated from breaking the surface tension), you go faster, but you still have to get a solid splash to move. This helps them learn to visualize and properly control the kicks' amplitude.  Other common kicking problems:   Sinking legs. The feet should be splashing a least a little. To help them keep it up, physically push their legs back to the surface and tell them to keep splashing. Tell them to fight to stay on the surface! Kicking from the knees. If their knees are always touching and they only kick by bending and straightening their knee, they are doing it wrong. Though they will generate some power from this kick, it should be rectified. Try telling them to kick with their whole leg, as if they were kicking a soccer ball, or just tell them to keep their legs straighter, or to get their legs (including the feet and toes) as long as possible. Body is shaking. Ideally only the legs should be moving; not even the hips. The best way to fix this is to tell them to stop shaking! If they still have trouble with this, try teaching them to use their core for stabilization.   One last tip: just practicing helps a ton. Kids aren't going to learn butterfly by only practicing, but they can learn to flutter kick through practice alone! Also, is there any particular problem you are having that isn't addressed here?"

It's been a while since I taught but Most of the kids I've taken have found it difficult on one of the below  keeping the legs up and not dropping  ankle flexibility  kicking from the knee  (or all 3)  It depends on how old your kids are. For no.1 we did lots of push offs from the wall trying to keep legs up (emphasis on lowered head and breathing to side to keep hips up). For two I used to do a lot of ankle mobility work before we got in (emphasis on rotating ankles, moving them independently of the leg to make them floppy). For three is the most difficult but emphasising kicking from the hip makes this work over time.  Generally I found teaching them in small half-lengths to an indicating cone rather than ploughing up and down the whole length was much better than full lengths to stop fatigue. Also holding onto the wall and kicking prior to any set."

If you find yourself sinking you can flutter kick or breast stroke kick and use your arms to help you come back to the surface.

Swimming,39hzlg,vincentwxin,3,Fri Jun 12 15:09:41 2015 UTC,"I have a general strategy of just breaking things into chunks. Short sets I can usually just know where I am, but longer or more complicated ones, I break it up into more manageable bites, usually using the ""halfway point"" as an anchor (i.e. If I'm doing 200's, I count to four then do a kind of mental reset where I know I have to do four more. 500s are the same. I count to ten, then I count to ten again.)   Same thing with sets (""20x50's? Oh no!! I'll lose count"" jk no I won't because I can totally count to five four times.)   Longer swims are a little more flexible. If I'm feeling really good/Not tired, I can just count individual laps and be good, I might use every 2 laps as an anchor (I.e. Make a mental note every time I finish a 50. (""One, TWO, three FOUR...... Fifteen, SIXTEEN..."" If I get mixed up, I'll remember that I just mentally yelled SIXTEEN and I'll know where I am again.)  If I'm tired and need some motivation, I break it into laps of 10, and do it like some people count push ups or something (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 30, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 40). That helps me keep track and keeps me going at a good pace (""I can totally do just ten more laps! Okay great good job now just ten more! Hey that wasn't so bad, ten more!"")    ALSO, this depends on how good you are at pacing, but one of my coaches always used to keep track of us based on the clock. For example, we were swimming continuously based on a :35/50yards pace, after a little over five minutes, we couldn't have done more than 18 laps (which would bring us to 5:15 since we started), so he would could keep track of when he needed to be ready for us all to be on the wall waiting for instructions/time bathroom breaks/know if we were cheating and said we did the whole set if he didn't watch us or count with us :p but like I said, this requires that you can go a consistent pace and count quickly off the clock."

Also, patterns of speed - it's a lot easier to figure out what lap you're on if you're going ""25 metres fast, 25 metres cruise, 25 metres sprint, 25 metres easy"", because you know how fast the lap you just went was. Just finished an easy lap? Well, that was lap 4, 8, 12, or 16, and if you know you were about half way done last time you checked, it's probably lap 12."

Swimming,39hzlg,Relen22,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:21:30 2015 UTC,"Instead of one long swim, break your workout into smaller sets with intervals.  This gives you several methods of counting:   For a set of 12x100 (for example), break it up into three groups of four or four groups of three, with a pattern to each group.  You could ""descend 1-3 or 1-4"", which means a slightly faster time for each one.  Or perhaps a pattern of ""moderate, build, fast"" for each group of three.  This makes it easier to remember where you are in each pattern.  If I just finished a ""build"", then I've just completed the 2nd, 5th, 8th, etc rep. Set your interval time on something irregular.  For example, instead of intervals of 2:00, use 1:55.  If the hand on the pace clock was 20 when you left for the current rep, the hand will be on the 15 for your next rep.  If you start your first rep on the 60, 12 reps later it will be back on the 60. Vary the distances in your workout, like a ladder.  It should be easier to remember where you are in a ladder like 25-50-75-100-125-150-125-100-75-50-25 (with 15s rest after each step) than swimming a straight 900 yards/meters."

Swimming,39h2bn,evanshall,4,Thu Jun 11 18:28:18 2015 UTC,"Public swimmers are some of the most self-entitled individuals on the planet (from my experience working as a lifeguard at a pool), talking in generalizations.  They complain when a club is in the pool (with 30 swimmers in 4 or 5 lanes) because they have to share theirs.  They complain if the club runs 5 minutes late (never mind the fact that the club owns the pool that they are allowing you to pay to use and that they decide when you get the extra lanes, not you).  They complain when I tell them to get out of the 'fast lane' where they are doing scull/walk at about 4 minutes per 50.  They complain when swimmers are doing pooldeck changes near them.

One of the biggest problems I've found with this specific topic in my time has been exactly what you described. Slower swimmers are constantly worrying about blocking the person behind them. This should be completely opposite. The faster swimmers should feel like they are hindering your swimming and get out of your way right away. Feel free to swim at your own pace and stop when you want to stop, not because you feel like you are threatening a faster swimmers workout pace. Ironically enough, the only time I've seen an entire pool of swimmers act in this way is at the U.S. Olympic Trials in 2012.

Swimming,39h2bn,bratislava,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:15:42 2015 UTC,"In my opinion faster swimmers should give some right of way to slower swimmers in crowded swimming pools. If you're faster, you only need to switch direction a little bit to pass someone. If you're slower, you might need to make a 90 degree turn to avoid a collision in time (And if you go more slower to avoid collision it won't delay collision as much as when the faster swimmer would go slower).  I see far to often that fast swimmers claim all lanes and force elderly, children, sick and handicapped people into impossible manoeuvres. Those people most likely don't have the same floating ability as fast swimmers, meaning that the waves the fast swimmers generate as they pass closely give them more inconvenience than they would to faster swimmers..  So basically I feel that if you have the energy to swim faster than others, so also have the energy to be more courteous and not inconvenience others too much who don't have that energy."

But if people are swimming 3 or 4 (or even more) times as fast as you they wont see you until after the collision.  The problem is when someone (usually a dumb old woman who is a massive pain in the ass) hops in the lanes indicated as fast lap swimming lanes to do her water walking because there is one person in it and there is a few people in the non-lap swimming lanes.  People are always happy to give the 'fast public swimmers' the blame, when atleast where I am it is usually everyone else causing problems."

This! My local pool generally has 6 lanes for lap swimming, with the two fast lanes generally full of 30something men who are actually pretty strong swimmers. The biggest problems are caused by slow swimmers who don't want to use the slow lane - I've seen some try and swim head-up breaststroke in the fast lane and then complaining when they got splashed and overtaken by two people doing about 1:30/100m! Lanes are marked as slow, medium, fast at all pools here so it's not like there was no warning either..."
Swimming,39h2bn,DjangoPony84,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:56:42 2015 UTC,There should always be a tiered system of speed. Slow to fast. If that is the case the fast swimmers go in the fast lane and all others go in other lanes. Unfortunately people just don't realise that they're going so slowly in the fast lane which is bonkers. Lifeguards should take more notice and pay more attention but simply don't care.
Swimming,39h2bn,mad_disciple,1 point,Sat Jun 13 09:38:01 2015 UTC,"There is a lane etiquette that should be followed quite clearly. First, if there are sufficient lanes to have a 'fast lane' simply do not, ever, swim breaststroke in there when there is anyone swimming fast freestyle. It's difficult to pass that person and way too slow. If someone is faster then let them go when they come up behind you (you can always go in a slower lane and they can't go in a faster one).   If you're in a mixed lane then do just stop when they come up behind you, overtaking is dangerous in lanes and arm bashing hurts. It takes all of 2-3 seconds and recognises when someone is wanting to go faster. You can then have the wake behind them to swim in and try to stay with them for a while, it's a good incentive to improve your speed/endurance.    Don't just keep going right in front of someone faster, it's just selfish, as is the faster swimmer tapping feet regularly (once is a good way of letting someone know you want to pass) or getting annoyed.   Common sense should prevail but doesn't, regularly."

However long your doctor says you should wait until training i'd go with. If the operation goes smoothly it would honestly be as soon as the wound has healed. I'd avoid breastroke kick for a while, and limit fly kick as much as you can as putting that much pressure on the abdomen would most likely be painful on your site of herniation and potentially cause another prolapse of tissue.   Other than that i'd say things shouldn't be too bad, maybe limit the power you use pushing off the wall from a turn, quick leg straightening with the abdominal pressure of fly/breakout kick might not be too good.  In terms of competing, if it was sorted out now then as long as you maintain some training you should most likely be fully recovered by august. Just don't push yourself too hard too soon.  Obviously i haven't had the experience myself so if anyone who has gives you different advice i'd take theirs over mine."

Swimming,39bvcb,Anonymoose98,15,Wed Jun 10 18:40:48 2015 UTC,"Jump around, swing your arms, loosen up, splash water on your face. A lot of competitive swimmers do this to get their heart rate up for their race.  As far as over focusing, I blew a big race once because I was too focused on those small things. A coach later explained a good approach to me- the race isn't the hard part, the training is. You've already done all the work, your body knows what to do. So just have fun and race, don't stress over it."
Swimming,39bvcb,crunkadactyl,5,Wed Jun 10 20:56:15 2015 UTC,You need to race the people you train with every day. You don't suddenly learn how to sprint. An attitude change is a habit and the only way to break habits in swimming is changing what you do at practice. Meets are only an indicator of how hard you tried in practice.

When you hop onto the block just know you trained better than they did, and in the middle of the race don't think. Especially in the short events that you swim. As i am a breastroker, my race strategy is to always go out fast, put yourself in the middle of the race, otherwise you've already lost. Hope this helps."

But aside from even buying his stuff, the biggest thing he talks about (in my opinion) is having fun. If you aren't enjoying racing, it won't go well. Try to remember what you enjoy about swimming and focus on that. Don't worry about outcome goals (beating somebody, getting a goal time, making a cut time, etc.) and focus more on what you can control: improving, having fun, that feeling you get when you're swimming smooth and fast and almost feel like flying.  Having fun is key. If you're too serious or too nervous, your body won't cooperate. Find a way to make things fun again!"
Swimming,39bvcb,insanity-insight,3,Thu Jun 11 00:06:04 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about those things when you're on the block. By the time you get up there, the only thing in your head should be ""Go.""

I will tell you everything, because something that didn't work for me may still work for you.  What worked for me, however, was a multitude of things. First, I needed to figure out what I liked about swimming and swim meets. For me, I love practice more than swim meets. So I figured out what I like about practice, and that was the sense of camaraderie with your teammates while you all challenge yourselves. I took that sense to swim meets too: I got very involved in cheering, getting people pumped up, and found it was a bit contagious. Even if I didn't do as well as I wanted, I was still having fun. Secondly, I started making a routine for myself in front of the blocks. I put on a song that at the time got me really pumped up, did jumps/stretches in front of the block, and tried not to get behind the blocks too early (I found that for me, going behind the blocks too early correlated with getting too much inside my head).  Things that didn't work for me: relaxation/meditation before bedtime (though I like it for helping my chronic insomnia!), ""faking it till I make it"" aka telling myself repeatedly that I will have a great swim (I'm not able to fool/trick myself easily), training way harder (I was swimming >24 hours per week with no improved results).

Swimming,39bvcb,Flamonkey4310,2,Thu Jun 11 02:46:19 2015 UTC,"This is completely common for swimmers so do not fret. There are mental and physical aspects to a swimmers ""game."" Unfortunately the sport introduces the physical aspects way before mentall. You find this in the experience of dropping crazy amounts of time with no worries. Soon the mental catches up. DO NOT WORRY THIS IS COMPELTELY NORMAL. It may sound cheesy but being the most physically sound swimmer but weakest mentally can make the difference between you and a slightly less physical but way better mental swimmer. This is a quick fix though. You have to find something calming before your race that puts you directly in the moment. Think how in films where they slow down everything and the character only hears his heartbeat and is supremely focused. For some people (such as myself) this is an important ritual. I used to put one foot up on the block, stretch it in, put my goggles on, focus my eyes on the water in front of the block and take long deep breaths in through mouth out through nose to slow my heart beat. Once you are completely calm, imagine that the race is beginning while standing there and paint the best mental picture you can. The moment that starter puts you up on the block and has you take your mark, you completely wipe any nerves out of your head and just become a robot. At this point, whether you like it or not, you are about to race and tie main goal is to get your hand on the wall first. Off the blocks you are completely robotic and you feel no pain besides a yearning to get to the wall. Once you start feeling energy depleting, work hard mentally to block it out and keep going. The best way to refine these skills is within your training. During the course of a practice you can go through your ritual more than 30 times and that's where training becomes the most important thing you can do. Feel free to PM me for some more help. Cheers and good luck! Remember, this sport is supposed to be fun. No need to worry, just MAKE IT FUN!"

Swimming,39bq4j,SpeedoTan,8,Wed Jun 10 18:07:10 2015 UTC,"Creatine is one of the few (legal) supplements that actually has a noticeable affect on performance. It works weight training wise by basically allowing you to squeeze out an extra rep or two at the end of your set when you would be too tired to otherwise. However, I seriously doubt that it would help much if you're just swimming.  Edit: it is perfectly safe as long as you take the recommended amounts. It does cause some bloating but as long as you drink plenty of water, most people will have no other side affects. Creatine is a naturally occurring compound in your body, all you're doing is supplying yourself with more of it."
Swimming,39bq4j,DickButtV2,3,Wed Jun 10 18:17:43 2015 UTC,"Here is a great article by the Mayo Clinic.  Their recommended dosage for swimming is:   For enhanced athletic performance (swimming), 10-25 grams of creatine has been taken by mouth daily in single or divided doses for four to nine days. 0.3 grams/kilogram of creatine has been taken by mouth daily for five days followed by 2.25 grams daily. 20 grams of creatine has been taken by mouth daily for six days, followed by 10 grams daily for eight days.   The link also has safety information and warnings on its usage.  However in general it is pretty safe and widely used."
Swimming,39bq4j,patchywetbeard,2,Wed Jun 10 18:54:58 2015 UTC,"It depends on dosage. It's popular with muscle strength/volume sports since it aids fluid retention and therefore volume and better delivery of whatever you put in your body (protein, or some other aids you might use...). I know that it's not too popular in fast twitch based disciplines like sprint which requires muscle mass and dynamics since it introduces lesser mobility.  Unless you have a kidney issues, it's pretty safe. I experimented with various dosages until I found some middle ground. In swimming, I'd go for muscle development which can work great on a short run. You need to cycle creatine as any other supplement, but there's ton about it online. Good luck!"

Once I switched to briefs, it wasn't possible to go back; it's that much better for competition training.

Swimming,39apk5,Illuvitar7,7,Wed Jun 10 13:50:14 2015 UTC,"hey there, I too have Spastic Diplegia, I've always swam with my upper body and sorta felt out of whack, I would just keep going to the pool! (water aerobics has changed my life forever.)  when I started swimming I was just doing laps with no formal training as well as nobody to really guide me to what I was doing - For me specifically, the breakthroughs came when I started swimming just using a kick board. Just slowly learning how to use those muscles and train your nervous system to fire in different ways is going to be beneficial on multiple different levels. As you train your brain to learn how to use those muscles differently, you help change and improve your neuro-plasticity. if you'd like to talk to me personally shoot me and inbox message i'd be happy to share my story and things I do! I would love to talk to you, and best of luck, keep up the good work, that progress no matter what pace is making you better"
Swimming,39apk5,WTF_H4X,2,Wed Jun 10 14:22:26 2015 UTC,"""just doing laps with no formal training..."" this is exactly where I am right now. The kickboard sounds like it might just be a great addition. Can you elaborate on what kind of exercises you did with it?"
Swimming,39apk5,WTF_H4X,3,Wed Jun 10 14:53:35 2015 UTC,"When i first started I would do squats in the water, although the buoyancy of the water counteracts the ""weight of gravity"" you could say, it was still extremely beneficial because I could actually perform the motion and I was getting my body used to it.  As far as out of the water I have a few key exercises that I do as much as my body will allow -   Lunges - use something to stabilize your body, and work on just being able to hold a lunge pose for a while before trying to do walking lunges or anything like that, its very important to train the static muscle (which is just holding a position without using any positive or negative work on the muscle)   Wall sits - To tie this in with lunges you want to focus on keeping your core tight and keeping as much pressure off your quads and lower back, I have massive quads and a very strong lower back, but i'm  gaining strength in my hamstrings and core - this is key for not only swimming but just overall balance and stability  Squats - I started by getting a piece of rope like one of the rope attachments for a pull down bar and I suspended that so that it would hang above my head and use that as a tool to balance while i lowered my body into a squat position. (Make sure your rope can handle your body weight and isnt going to rip a support beam or anything out of your ceiling or anything like that) With that being said, you can use the rope to pull you back up to a standing position but what I've found helpful is to tell my body we are going to be pushing up with our upper hamstrings and only pull up with the upper body if needed  For upper body I focus on mostly body weight exercises just like my lower body, as its helpful to increase joint strength and overall stability and balance as well  Push ups - there's all different kinds of push ups varying hand positions and decline or incline.  Pull ups - if you can't do pull ups start with some rows or other exercises that will help build the muscles that are targeted in the pull up motion, and again like the lunges if you can just hang from a pull up bar that will start to train that static muscle.   Dips - I absolutely love this exercise its like the ""squat"" of the upper body it works mainly the triceps, chest and shoulders, but remember to keep that core flexed and your biceps and forearms and back are also benefiting from this exercise.  I work on a multitude of stretches as well, I've been meditating and doing simple yoga and really stretching out my quads, hamstrings, Achilles, and hips - i'm sure you know this but just be dedicated take it slow and don't push yourself too hard progress with come with time all you need is a little discipline and you'll be a master in no time  I would recommend picking up a body weight fitness book like ""You are your own gym"" or Convict conditioning - these books have a really nice wealth of knowledge and focus on form and progress, no matter how strong you currently are start at the beginning and work your way up to the more advanced exercises. - this will train your body, specifically the message from the nervous system to your muscles, and the return message from your muscles back to your brain (it's a constant cycle)   on a side note, I'm 24 years old, male. 6'0 and 180 lbs.  Hope that helps and if anyone needs any clarification or would like me to expand on specifics just let me know."

Swimming,39apk5,TheGreatCthulhu,2,Wed Jun 10 14:41:00 2015 UTC,"Keep sticking with what you know. Only when you feel like you can swim freestyle and breaststroke easily and comfortably should you consider challenging yourself to learn backstroke and butterfly.   If you are looking to minimize leg motion, backstroke and freestyle can be pretty lax on the legs unless you have a hard time staying afloat naturally.   The best course of action would be to talk to a local swim coach or teacher and have them look at your stroke (or you could post a video on here) and we would be able to give you pointers.  What are your back floating skills like?"
Swimming,39apk5,working_on_it_today,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:09:41 2015 UTC,"I used to live near the ocean and I learned to back float there, haven't done much of it in the pool for awhile, but when I first learned to swim my favorite way was to do the breast stroke motion while floating on my back, if that makes sense.   I will keep working on Front and Breast stroke until they are strong as well, thank you for the advice!"
Swimming,39apk5,cc12floz,2,Wed Jun 10 14:39:17 2015 UTC,"Also, if you are having problems with legs sinking on freestyle , you can always use a pull buoy to support your legs and still get an effective swim workout. Breaststroke is notoriously hard on the knees btw, and uses more kick overall as part of the stroke mechanics than backstroke or frontcrawl."
Swimming,399xw9,unicornh_1,1 point,Wed Jun 10 08:52:02 2015 UTC,"Underwater swimming comes down to momentum. If you can nail your turn and have speed going while underwater, your goal is to keep that momentum going as long as possible. The basic underwater method of swimming for backstroke fly and freestyle is an undulation much like a butterfly kick. This should come from the midsection of your body and NOT FROM YOUR KNEES. I recommended brushing up on some underwater race video from the greats of Lochte and phelps. A breastroke pullout is very simple but limited. You are only allowed one breastroke kick (legally and a pullout. Hope this helped! Happy swimming!"
Swimming,399xw9,Flamonkey4310,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:02:34 2015 UTC,"""You are only allowed to one kick and pullout""  i dont understand this part. but i have seen many videos people tend to do breastroke pullout why is that?"
Swimming,399xw9,Flamonkey4310,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:39:07 2015 UTC,FINA rules state that a breastroker competing is only allowed to do one fluid motion pullout with a singular breastroke kick. Allowing anymore than one causes a disadvantage because the swimmer would be going way past 15 meters. Just a clarification doesn't apply much though. In fly back and free you are legally allowed (FINA again) as many kicks as it takes to get to 15m. Passing 15m is a disqualification. Then again if you are not a competing swimmer and just doing it for fitness this has no correlation. Cheers
Swimming,399xw9,bill_a_delphia,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:44:11 2015 UTC,"If your goal is to be able to go an entire length underwater, being streamlined is crucial - moreso even than swimming on the top of the water.  if you've got a good dolphin/flutter kick and keep your arms in streamline in front of you, you'll go as fast, if not faster than if including your arms, and you'll expend less energy letting you stay under for longer."
Swimming,399xw9,wapz,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:21:14 2015 UTC,"What is your end goal? If you just want to go a little further (like 25m or so), it is achievable if you have a good flutter kick and streamline (or breast stroke kick and pull-downs). If you want to get good at underwater swimming (you do a lot of snorkeling in Hawaii/you want to improve your speed off the wall), you should try to perfect your dolphin kick then work on underwater dolphin."

Swimming,39dlhd,username696969,2,Thu Jun 11 01:24:29 2015 UTC,"The biggest improvement I can suggest specifically to a backstroke is WORK ON YOUR UNDERWATERS. Some of the worst backstroke swimmers on the world are the most successf because of how good their UNDERWATERS are. When you think about it, if you can get to the point of going 15m off every wall in a 100m backstroke you only have to really be above water swimming for 40m! That's less then a 50! Good luck!

Swimming,3996z4,Lear_King_Of_Britain,15,Wed Jun 10 04:03:50 2015 UTC,"I'm a lifeguard, and have seen some very large people swimming during our lap swim programs. Tire belly or not, as long as you're swimming, I don't care if you're in a tutu. Don't put it around your belly, it'll look bizarre, and feel super uncomfortable. Go for what you're there for, which is you- don't pay anybody else any attention. Whenever I see people who are overweight swimming, I'm impressed. I'm rooting for them. One of the best times I had was when this guy started coming in last summer, needing to lose 50 lbs in order to get a knee replacement, or something of the sort. We would talk when he was there, and I gave him pointers on his stroke.  When I came back from college, I saw him the other day, and he had this huge grin on his face, and said ""I lost all my weight and got my knee surgery. Now I'm in it for the for the fun."" We'll keep an eye on you, but in the best way possible."
Swimming,3996z4,thatswimmerguy,3,Wed Jun 10 07:07:09 2015 UTC,"I'm a girl but I had to lose the baby weight so I understand the uncomfortable tire in the front. I would wear the jammers on your hips. When you're doing strokes, your body is going to stretch and it won't be very comfortable if you have the jammers at your navel. Also, it just looks better at the better at the hips. Don't feel self-conscious. Just go and do your thing and the tire will melt away."
Swimming,3996z4,billandteds69,3,Wed Jun 10 05:39:36 2015 UTC,"I completely understand the struggle. I started swimming as an overweight youngin with some self esteem problems. It makes perfect sense that you are looking into jammers because at my weight I never wanted to wear a speedo. First things first. CONGRATULATIONS on beginning your swimming fitness career once again. if you stick to it and stay motivated you will feel healthy, happy, and won't have to post questions like this anymore. When it comes to a suit like a jammer, the older way people wore it was just at the hip bone. As the sport has improved, with first use through racing suits but now for general suits, more heavy set swimmers normally tuck a bit of their gut into their jammer. Some professional swimmers (lacking the tire) go so far as wearing suits straight up to their belly button. My recommendation however is to buy a jammer that fits a bit too snug. This adds extra motivation from the beginning of your journey to lose weight pronto just so you can even fit your swimsuit better. Give it your best and goodluck! The hardest part (starting it) is now over. Go out and have fun!"

Swimming,399ljl,wiiman124,3,Wed Jun 10 06:22:09 2015 UTC,"Your gallop comes from a deep pull and tendency to breath one side.  First off try and breath by 3's keeping a more consistent stroke and pull instead of sticking to your strong side.  If that doesn't work, which might or might not, try and change your pull.  Instead of pulling deep and going for strength on the one side, try to pull closer to your body and get a faster tempo with your arm speed.  If you can get your elbow bent a little in the water, inside of straight down and pulling deep water, and can force the pull closer and throw it down to your feet you will definitely get a faster pace going.   This will cut out on your strength of the pull, but with time and practice can help with a more consistent faster paced stroke.  Gallop & deep strong pulls will eventually cause a lot of wear & tear on your muscles. you aren't balancing the load on your shoulders and it's going to get to you eventually as well. Make sure you're stretching and doing proper technique drills!"
Swimming,399ljl,Jernight,1 point,Wed Jun 10 08:00:00 2015 UTC,"Hi, thanks for the tips. As you mentioned the wear and tear had already gotten to me. When I was around 15 I injured both of my shoulders from over-training freestyle and butterfly. Many trips to physiotherapy later and my shoulders are much stronger now  While training I breathe to alternate sides (twice to one side and then switch, a 3-2 pattern.) I still gallop to both sides though; however, It is more prominent in races when I'm breathing by 2's or 4's.   I'll try changing up my pull, do you have any drills you could suggest for working on that specific aspect of my stroke?  I can try to get my coach to film my stroke underwater so I can analyze it further, but in the past I've had problems with crossing my midline, i.e entering in front of my head instead of my shoulders, and with over reaching, i.e hyper extending my shoulders for a catch very far in front of my body.   Thanks again for the tips."
Swimming,399ljl,Onepush,2,Wed Jun 10 16:04:43 2015 UTC,Do you mean your pace slows way down with one arm/when you breathe? Or are you referring to something about uneven rotation?
Swimming,399ljl,Onepush,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:39:01 2015 UTC,When I'm breathing I'm kind of bouncing up and down. It's like I have a really lopsided stroke. Not sure if I'm explaining it very well. It's similar to how some Americans swim freestyle (see Michael Phelps' 2008 400 IM) but more wobbly
Swimming,399ljl,Flamonkey4310,3,Wed Jun 10 07:31:59 2015 UTC,"You might try 11 drill. It's basically ketchup drill, where your leading hand doesn't pull until your trailing hand catches up, but your arms make an 11 shape rather than touching, so you don't practice crossover. This should force you to be really flat if you pay attention to maintaining lead am position while you breathe."
Swimming,399ljl,Flamonkey4310,2,Wed Jun 10 16:51:27 2015 UTC,"Sometimes the gallop stroke isn't a bad thing. You see it used in a lot of distance swimmers because of the pivot like motion keeps you from expending energy and establishes a rhythm. Im assuming it has come because of a breathing technique that is every other or just to one side. If you are trying to get rid of this, be sure to start breathing in odd numbers (3 ideal, 5s and 7s possibly for warm down at low intensity). Some great drills to do that will fix this are short and long doggy paddle along with underwater full freestyle stroke. These will work to even your body control. Be sure to have constant pressure pushing on an arm. If one arm is finishing the stroke you should be rotating to the other arms side and begin that arms full stroke. Rinse. Repeat. Swim Fast! Goodluck!"
Swimming,399ljl,HoodedGryphon,1 point,Wed Jun 10 08:20:41 2015 UTC,"Hi, thanks for the tips. I do breathe to alternate sides while training, I breathe twice to one side and then switch (a 3-2 pattern) but I gallop on both sides. When I was younger (14-16) I was a 1500 freestyle swimmer, but I injured both of my shoulders over-training butterfly, so I've been focusing more on sprints since then, which is why I want to reduce my gallop.   I'm regards to ""short and long doggy paddle"" I'm not quite sure what you mean. Could you explain that a bit more for me please?  Thanks again."
Swimming,396lwc,isosceleseyebrows,6,Tue Jun 9 17:03:07 2015 UTC,"In the wise words of US Olympic Head coach Gregg Troy: ""a suit is a suit, what you do with it is what distinguishes you as a swimmer."" Don't think too much into these suits. The differences between the suits aren't in their technical potential but in how comfortable you feel in them. Try them on, feel them out in the water, make a purchase and then don't worry about it. Your goal should be to swim to a level where suits are given to you. Good luck and happy swimming"
Swimming,396lwc,Flamonkey4310,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:39:51 2015 UTC,You do realise that unless you are world class you are going to have to drop a couple 100 bucks to try out these suits right?  Knowing the difference is important because then people can try and make an educated guess at which ones they will be best off with so that they can start there.
Swimming,396lwc,jared0h,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:36:45 2015 UTC,"You're comment is false. Most collegiate swimmers (not even necessarily on scholarship) get a free racing suit with each season of competing. Now one can agree that this is an elite level of swimming but there are thousands of swimmers on that classification.  My point being, it's idiotic to imprint the idea that a suit can make the difference for a swimmer. We should be hammering home the concept of actually training yourself to the level you aspire to swim at. The racing suit is just a TOOL to swim fast. If you'd like to rate the best pair of goggles out there feel free, but much like racing suits this is an entirely subjective topic. Arena has a great range of suits. Feel free to try each out and make an educated guess based on YOU for which tool is the right fit."
Swimming,396lwc,Flamonkey4310,0,Fri Jun 12 07:56:35 2015 UTC,"This is true, but not all of us are american and even those that are quite a lot will not be in college and thus not get free suits. I got free suits when I was in the national youth team where I am, but we wore what we were given and had no choice in the type of suit (as speedo was the team sponsor that meant LZR).  I am not sure exactly how the college system works with how they supply their swimmers, but unless you get at least three suits and your schools sponsor (i assume schools are sponsored?) is arena you still aren't going to get to just try all 3 suits.  Regardless, most on here will not be able to get whatever suit they want whenever they want. and having an idea of the advantages and disadvantages of each suit is only going to help people make a purchasing decision.  And a suit does make a difference to the swimmers performance, not only physically but mentally as well. Of course it isn't the be all and end all, no one here has claimed it is, but talking about the suits and trying to help others make good purchasing decisions is a good thing.  These suits aren't cheap and there isn't many places to discuss them, this is one of them."

Swimming,396lwc,coolkh13,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:08:51 2015 UTC,"Unless it is really difficult for you to get into your suits dont bother with the Air.  It was made because a lot of female swimmers found the Pro especially extremely difficult to get into, which is why the flex was easier and now the air is easier again.  Honestly I think the pro is 'objectively' the best suit from a performance standpoint. I used to wear a pair in the 200 BRST just before I quit. However despite the sprint suit reputation it has I felt much less comfortable in it in the 100s and 50s, I would wear a flex for the 100 and a pair of FS LZR elites in the 50."
Swimming,396lwc,jared0h,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:45:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the air but I've found that the flex is much better for longer events. I've found it to have a much better ""spring"" motion which is helpful when you're exhausted and have a 50 left in your 200 fly or when you're trying to keep on kicking at the end of a backstroke event. In fact I've found it to be better for IM as well as 200 Fly and Backstroke in general. I have however found my Pro to be better for more sprints events such as the 200-50 free and 100 fly as it is more compressive and seems to be better for shooting off a wall as hard as possible."
Swimming,396lwc,ShwimmingAway,2,Tue Jun 9 19:09:35 2015 UTC,Its funny because I have had the exact opposite experience. I prefer the 200 brst in carbon pros and the 100 in the flex.

I have no doubt he has insane talent, I saw him swim a 1:03 a year or so ago. But lots of people get too 1:01/1:02. I got to 1:02.7 (at 17) and i wasnt the hardest worker ever, nor anywhere near as big and strong as he is, I just had a ridiculous feel for the water and world class pull (with a pretty poor kick).  To go from there to the sub minute (and especially sub 59) swims you have to be absolutely brilliant in every facet of the race.  I have seen so many kids stall as they close in on being world class and never get quicker, I am not predicting it or anything, but if he never gets much faster than he is right now I wouldnt exactly be surprised."

Swimming,395bht,futureslave,4,Wed Jun 10 16:53:48 2015 UTC,"from breaststrokezone.com:  In the 1950’s swimmers began to swim breaststroke underwater. At the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, Masaru Furukawa from Japan won the Gold Medal by swimming all but 5 meters underwater for the first 3 laps and half the last lap underwater. This lead to many other swimmers taking on the tactic but as more and more passed out FINA changed the rules limiting how far underwater a swimmer could swim. In the 1960’s FINA changed the rules again to ensure that the arms could not go past the hips except for the first stroke immediately after a start or turn. In the 1990’s swimmers began to launch their hands over the water again in the recovery period which was allowed as long as the elbows did not break the surface of the water. More recently in the mid 2000’s it was found in underwater footage that some swimmers, including the then World Record Holder, Kosuke Kitajima were performing a dolphin kick off the start and turn. Because these kicks could not be seen from the surface of the water, FINA changed the rules that 1 dolphin kick is allowed from each start and turn."
Swimming,395bht,i_swim_breast,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:12:33 2015 UTC,My dad was a competitive swimmer in the 50s-60s. He still says we're doing breast-stroke wrong because in his day you could swim the entire length of the pool underwater. I'd kinda like to see a modern breast-stroke race like that.

Swimming,396oib,iris513,3,Tue Jun 9 17:20:10 2015 UTC,"I would suggest drills like 2-2-2 (2 left, 2 right, 2 full). Something I found that help me learning fly is having hard kick just before your arm break out of the water to the recovery, it helps to push your shoulders out of making it much easier to get that wave motion and breath. I used to just to arms to pull out of the water to breath and it was tough. Also finding a good rhythm, trying to focus on the up kick not just the down kick will give you that much more power in your stroke."
Swimming,396oib,coolkh13,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:18:30 2015 UTC,"When you mean 2-2-2, do you breath to the side or how you would regularly breath in butterfly?"

Swimming,396oib,AndersonIV,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:28:25 2015 UTC,"It's a good drill to practice the wave motion in fly, try to exaggerate the wave motion and using your core and hip to generate the power of your kick."
Swimming,396oib,coolkh13,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:44:24 2015 UTC,"If you do this, make sure you keep a wide recovery and aren't simply doing freestyle with a dolphin kick for the single-arm strokes."
Swimming,396oib,DannyDougherty,3,Tue Jun 9 19:31:20 2015 UTC,"Focus on the coordinating the kicks and pull. It will be choppy at the start, but as you work on the kick-pull-kick rhythm, it will start to smooth out. Be sure to coordinate your fist kick (the big one) with your pull, and the second kick (the small one) comes in as your arms extend forward in the water. When your head is underwater, stay looking at the bottom of the pool. Your body will follow your head, so if you are looking towards the far end of the pool, your hips will drop and make it very hard to keep moving forward. Take it easy. As you stroke, extend your arms into the water in front of you, this is where you can rest and glide as you are learning. Don't rush into your next stroke. A drill for body position: do butterfly kick with your hands by your sides, focus on breathing. This can be difficult, but will help you to hallow you stomach (like you are about to get punched in the belly) as you dive and arch your back as you come up to breathe. Two kicks for every breath. One kick as you breach the water to breathe and the second as your head enters the water again.    I don't want to write too much, these are the things that came to mind first. Good Luck!"
Swimming,396oib,JakAttak,3,Tue Jun 9 18:34:16 2015 UTC,"Hard to say much without seeing you swim, but my go-to comment on butterfly is usually about breathing/head position.   Your head is leading the whole show here, it's starting the porpoise motion your whole body should follow. Your head should already be up for a breath as your arms are coming out of the water. Then it should be diving back down as your arms are coming around. Your head should be way underwater as your arms enter.   What I find with fins is that you can slow the whole stroke down, which is nice for practice, but I see a lot of folks hanging their head out of the water way too long. This delays the whole stroke, screwing up pretty much everything.  Focus on a huge exhale underwater, a quick breath and diving back down with the head.    Good luck!"
Swimming,396oib,TElrodT,2,Tue Jun 9 18:50:29 2015 UTC,"This.   Practice without taking breaths (Yeah, I know we are talking about Fly here). Keeping your head way down in the water allows the transfer of rhythm through your hips to your upper torso.   Don't be afraid to exaggerate your hip movement to help build forward drive.   Hold your right hand up in front of you flat. Start to curve it and make a wave motion. That motion when smooth is how your body should move through the water. Your arms pull your upper torso up to the top of the water, your hips and legs push it back down. Both produce propulsion and when working together, the motion is smooth and fast.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkw7hZJ0LZQ  Note: Anytime your hands exit the water (any stroke), they should be literally throwing water behind you and out of the pool."
Swimming,396oib,Chummin,2,Tue Jun 9 19:03:22 2015 UTC,"I would also strongly recommend kicking without a board in streamline.  This will allow you to build a stronger dolphin kick, think about leading with your head and chest and eliminate having to coordinate your arms and legs.  It also means you can try and do some of it on your back, to eliminate some of the difficulties of working without breathing.  (Though I'd recommend doing the kick sets paired with the above mentioned drills so you don't totally lose arm rhythm)"
Swimming,396oib,DannyDougherty,2,Tue Jun 9 19:30:02 2015 UTC,My best advice is to grab a kick board and try and ungulate kicking butterfly for as far as you can. Doesn't have to be fast just be technically sound kicking from the hip AND NOT FROM TOUR KNEES (most swimmers problem). Stay on top of swimming fly with fins and keep ramping up the distance you go. The combination will help you get to a non assisted butterfly in no time. Cheers.

Swimming,396ihq,fiddlestix42,3,Tue Jun 9 18:44:24 2015 UTC,$100 for a 30 min session seems excessive to me.

I work for a notable swim club that has them for $80/30 minutes, which is still pricey, especially because i know the caliber of the instructors. $40-$50 is a reasonable price for a private teacher that's not associated with pool fees, I charge $30-$50/30 minutes for competitive kids or adults and I feel that's more than fair.."

Good luck, I would suggest contacting local swim teams that also offer lessons. Ask about adult lessons (if they have it then ask private). I have coached for a company that ripped people off but you could catch them as you are getting prices on each type of lesson and then calling out a price spike."

Swimming,395uq2,Cat_0verlord,2,Tue Jun 9 13:52:53 2015 UTC,On a set of parallel bars do some dips. It'll strengthen your lats to be able to handle pulling better. Another good tip is go a size up on your paddles. Most times it builds more strength and power and helps with your feel of the water
Swimming,395uq2,Flamonkey4310,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:08:39 2015 UTC,"In water there are some good drills too. Swim with your hands as fists. When you go back to normal swimming you will have a better feel for the water. When you swim visualize you are swimming downhill, also visualize there is a barrel right in front of you and your arms need to go over it.  The key is to get yourself to pull with high elbows and move your arms backward to propel yourself forward. It is common to think you are pulling but really you are pushing down on the water."

There're too many to mention, but snorkel would take the edge of being stressed by breathing. The pull starts with recovery and entrance. Any time spend your arm spend over the surface has to be dynamic (propelling your core) and quick to do the next catch.  What exactly you think is awful abut your pull?"

I find them useful for meets or a day at the pool or lake when you have to repeatedly dry off, but not so much for regular training.  When I swim I only take a little (hand-towel sized) towel that's just big enough to dry off with after showering.  Then afterwords I can easily throw it over a chair or attach it to my backpack with some clothespins for it to dry during the day, and it means more room in my bag and less stuff to carry around all day."

Swimming,3923jv,evanshall,12,Mon Jun 8 18:25:28 2015 UTC,"Depending on how busy the pool is, you can also split a lane. So if there's about one person per lane, you can ask to join someone and suggest you each take a side; this can be a little easier than circle swimming, especially if you're going at different speeds, but it only works with two to a lane so isn't an option in busier pools."

This only works if there is only one other person in the lane, though.

Swimming,3925u5,swim1929,2,Mon Jun 8 23:24:16 2015 UTC,"Stopping in the middle of the pool is a big no, unless you're going to pass out. Slow down and find a pace/drill that will let you finish out the 100. Sounds like your stroke probably needs work and you fight through the water. slow down, do a drill, and try to pace yourself. stretch your stroke out. or kick on your side with an arm out and face up -- you should be able to stay there comfortably and with minimal work for more than enough time to finish out the 100, let alone make it to the wall. i would check how many strokes you take to get across as well and see if you can work on getting that number down."
Swimming,3925u5,awkwadoodle,2,Tue Jun 9 00:32:15 2015 UTC,Setting your mind to always touching the wall will make you that much better of a swimmer. People don't understand that a lot of it is mental and being able to have the confidence to know you can always get to that wall regardless of how drained you are is the difference between recreational pool play time and actual fitness out of the sport. If you push through the pain and lack of energy you won't build momentum but you will build heaps of confidence in your ability. Cheers.

Swimming,38y3ck,quaintishcitygal,3,Sun Jun 7 20:47:12 2015 UTC,"Swimmitor /u/BigAttack trained for the English Channel while living in Montreal.  Question 1: There is no absolute answer to this, as cold water tolerance develops over weeks, months and even years. (My coldest temp is 1.4C). Two of the most popular articles  I've ever written though are on the subject, first is the humourous precise open water temperature scale, and second is  the recurring question you've asked, what temperature of water is too cold to swim in (though I've actually written 3 I think articles of that name).    Question 2: You could PM /bigattack but I know for his long distance training swims he went to lake quite a drive from the city as there was nothing close by."
Swimming,38y3ck,TheGreatCthulhu,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:27:24 2015 UTC,"It's not about when to not swim. It's about the proper swimwear. It's cold here but i spend my winter outside, because I dress well. It's always about wearing the appropriate clothing. I was wondering at which atmospheric temperature or when in the season a wetsuit is more appropriate."
Swimming,38y3ck,bigattack,2,Mon Jun 8 18:58:20 2015 UTC,"Hi!  And thanks to /u/TheGreatCthulhu for the connection. While I was training for my channel swim I swam in Lac Archambault (Saint Donat) for 90% of my open water swims.  You can swim at the rowing canal, which is a nice medium between a pool and open water.  I never found a group of openwater swimmers here, but there are so many lakes that I'm sure you can find a place.  Are you a member of a master's club?"
Swimming,38y3ck,bigattack,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:37:02 2015 UTC,"I am glad you find your way to my post! I have so many questions.   I am not a member of a master's club. I work a very bizare schedule therefore it is very difficult for me to make arrangements for regular practices. I train on my own. A friend that coaches master swimmers sometimes help me with buidling swim sets. But 97% of my training I do on my own with some research.   It's a personal challenge I am setting myself this summer. And I don't really know where to start. I have a place at parc Jean-drapeau but it opens on June 23, I would like to start earlier. So you said I could swim in the canal lachine ? Do you know where you would enter it ? anywhere? are there any lifeguards ?   Do you use any buoy when you swim in open water? Should I ?  What about temperature ? when did you wear a wet suit and when did you switch to a swimming suit ? Is there anywhere to keep track of the temperature of the water?  Why did you choose this particular lake? Can I choose basically any lake? What would be criterias to choose one ?   Sorry. As you can see I have many questions ! Nobody in my entourage is into this or interested in that so I have to find my information elsewhere. I welcome any advice you want to give me.  I have found some technical information online and will start practicing today at the pool but if there is anything you want to add, please do.   Thank you so much !"
Swimming,38y3ck,bigattack,2,Mon Jun 8 19:15:21 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  Good for you!!  It isn't the Lachine Canal, it's the Bassin Olympique where they do the rowing.  You should definitely use a rescue can (like baywatch!) when you do open water swimming.  The biggest risk is getting hit by a boat.  You can also attach a GPS watch to it, which will tell you distance, etc. A wetsuit is personal preference.  I never wore one because it is not allowed during an English Channel swim.  Personally, I would try to do it without it.  In terms of openwater swimming resources, probably the best blog in the world is done by a guy named Donal Buckley, who was my coach.  His blog is called www.loneswimmer.com.  I chose lac Archambault because we have a house there :) It really doesn't matter where you swim, just swim :)"
Swimming,38y3ck,bigattack,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:20:28 2015 UTC,Thank you for answering.  I hope I am not too overwhelming with all my questions!   During which months did you swim outside in quebec?  edit: spelling
Swimming,38y3ck,bigattack,2,Mon Jun 8 20:27:10 2015 UTC,"Please don't worry about the questions.  I love them!  I swam outside from the time the ice melted until it froze.  You have to get acclimated to it though.  You can't just jump in :) Take a swimming pool thermometer with you and see what the water temperature is.  You can swim for short lengths of time in anything over ~16 degrees.  But it will take you a month or two before you can stay in that temperature for more than 20 minutes or so.  The first three minutes are painful, but after that, you should be okay.  You will definitely shiver for a few minutes when you get out.  Like I said, go to www.loneswimmer.com and look up ""acclimation"" or ""habituation"".  It's fascinating how your body works."

Quite appropriate and well timed in my case. I just posted about open water swimming feeling fairly confident I could do it and maybe own it. You just brought me back to reality !   Can I ask you how warm it was and how long has it been warm where you are? Temperature is what concerns me the most.

If to compare, the warm spots were like a normal pool, maybe a little colder and the cold spots were like a shitty lake. Haha... Or an extremely cold pool... outside.. In the winter. It was cold. The area I'm in had been consistently 19-26 degrees for about three weeks, on top of a very mild winter. Why, what's up? Something else I should know?"

Swimming,38xv7h,jamincan,2,Mon Jun 8 02:04:30 2015 UTC,"Water temperature only needs to vary by half a degree to register on the skin as a cold patch. Shallow water on a beach, especially on a dropping tide warmed by sun, can be up to 2 degrees warmer than than deeper water.  Shallow areas and beachs have more cold/warm pockets than deep areas. (My most usual swim location is deep water and never exhibits temperature variation within the swim)."
Swimming,38xv7h,BlowDuck,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:18:07 2015 UTC,I didn't know that. Does a wetsuit eliminate or cut down the dramatic changes in temperature?
Swimming,38xv7h,BlowDuck,2,Mon Jun 8 13:29:11 2015 UTC,"Wetsuits eliminate both temperature variations and exposure risk. They also artificially increase buoyancy and speed. They are good for beginners and triathletes, but are disallowed in channel & marathon swimming, and not much used by experienced regular open water swimmers (regardless of temperature)."

Any change in a swimmers body has a range of dynamic effects on performance. Of course losing weight is going to have an impact. How have you been losing weight? Additional dryland? Weights? Diet?  I have seen people decline because of all these things, be it carb deficit over time or loss of flexibillity because of lifting."
Swimming,38v0ie,KaptajnKaffe,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:20:40 2015 UTC,Diet. I just started lifting this week to now look the part after losing my excess fat.
Swimming,38v0ie,KaptajnKaffe,3,Sun Jun 7 15:10:17 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you are focusing on three different things at the same time.  It sounds good to say ""I'm going to lose some fat while I build a little muscle to get more defined while I'm also working on my technique.""  This approach is extremely bad for achieving any of those three things. It's very hard to find that perfect balance even for professionals with dietists and coaches advicing them. Doing it yourself is borderline impossible. Focus on one thing at a time, you will get much better results.  Lifing without supervision/swim coach, for example, while working on technique, is very likely to actually make you worse in the water. Working with a calorie deficit to lose fat will keep you from building muscle. Your initiatives are likely working against each other and that's probably why you are experiencing performance drops."

Swimming,38pxh8,wolverinelord,3,Sat Jun 6 00:56:53 2015 UTC,"I'm going to say here, what I rarely say and which you will nearly all dislike and downvote me for.  Pool swimming is nothing in this comparison. Speed for a few seconds or minutes versus someone else's speed for few seconds or minutes? Does the competitor every worry that they won't finish? The worst that can happen is they come last.  How about the Billy Butlin's Cross Channel races of the 1950s when the world's best open water swimmers raced themselves and nature across the world's most legendary stretch of water?  How about Ted Errickson and Abou Latif Heif racing for 30 hours across Lake Michigan in the 60s? What about the annual MIMS Round Manhattan or South America's Perana river, or any of the FINA Grand Prix series, or Lynn Cox in the Cairo marathon swim?  But no. Those are not enough. Those do not live in the heart and the imagination quite like UK swimmer Kevin Murphy and Australian Des Renford's legendary 3 race series  in the 1970s.   At the time Renford was King of the Channel and Kevin was coming up with a big reputation for completed swims.  The first race was ~20 miles across outside Sydney harbour in the Aussie man's home waters with shark cages to protect the swimmers. Surprisingly Kevin won, having figured out despite no experience with them previously the optimum way to swim in a cage, and dealing a blow to the Aussie swimmer.  The second race was the Channel. Both legends had soloed successfully multiple times, both had not succeeded at a double crossing. Eyeing each other's boat from a distance in the middle of the night on Shakey as they prepared to start, what Kevin didn't know was that Renford  had already set out before his pilot boat left and gained 500 metres. Renford held the lead and beat Kevin in his home waters, though in waters with which the Aussie was almost as familiar.  Tied at one-all, less than a week later, the two men boarded a train in London to take them north for the final showdown and tiebreaker.  Though it was August, they were heading north for one of the coldest swimming locations in the world, Lough Ness.  As they entered the Cairngorms, (the Scottish Highlands), Kevin saw Renford nervously eye the still snow-shrouded peaks.  Each escorted by a single small powered rowboat, with a single helper, only a week after their channel joust, neither were recovered. (Kevin said that even at his peak it took him weeks to recover from a solo).  The men entered the water, Rendord diving in swimming off, gasping from shock at the bitter 10 degree water. Kevin, a veteran cold water swimmer, walked in slowly, (as I myself do and always advise others to do) then floated for a minute before setting out.  The shoulder-deadening cold fresh water sapped  both men of energy. Renford was pulled from the water with sever hypothermia after about 2 hours, if I recall. Kevin continued on. And on. At five hours Kevin's wife Jane, his solo crew, leaned over to Kevin as his feed and said ""Renford is done"". Kevin, not entirely compos mentis by this time, and suffering hypo himself, questioningly mumbled out through his 70's porno-tache ""done what""?  Kevin and Des reported the series differently. Renford said that as Kevin didn't finish it was tie. Kevin said that he had proven his point by far outswimming Des  in the final swim.  Both men became friends.

The cheapest is the Garmin Swim. It uses accelerometers in the watch to determine your stroke, count laps, count strokes and various other functions.

Swimming,38itox,Tullyswimmer,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:40:09 2015 UTC,"When you tried DIY putty, did you keep your mouth wide open while taking the impressions?  Apparently, this is necessary to assure a good seal in your ear.  I'm guessing the audiologist took impressions with your mouth open, which could make a big difference.  BTW, I prefer to keep my player at the back of my head to keep it out of the way, reduce drag, etc...  I also recommend a swim cap which covers the ears for even more headphone security, especially during kick turns.  I've never tried putting swim cap over my goggles."
Swimming,38itox,mcslootysloot,2,Thu Jun 4 15:27:39 2015 UTC,"Actaully, it's the other way around.  Opening your mouth while having an impression done actually shrinks your ear canal slightly, so you'd ideally want to do the impression with your mouth closed to create the best seal."

Watching other people who seem to swim better than you might help, but people can be weird about you watching them when they're mostly nude.    But really, the best thing to do is to get wet as much as possible.  Don't worry about what your form looks like to other people. Don't worry about getting tired after 10 minutes.  Just swim until you can't anymore.  The next day will be better.  You'll have learned a little bit about form from the previous day, and you'll be in slightly better shape.  Do one more 50 than you did the day before.  You'll get better - it's physics.  And don't beat yourself up if you have a weak day.  About a year ago, I started swimming again after a decade of being out of the water.  I could only do 500.  I'm up above 3000 now, all from just incrementally adding distance here and there.

Swimming,38jpgs,Bubbay,2,Thu Jun 4 17:56:25 2015 UTC,"Without seeing your specific stroke, it's hard to say exactly what you need to do to improve your times.  However, your existing efforts to lengthen your stroke are a good idea.  All strokes require efficiency in motion, but for breaststroke this is especially so.  You do want to have the reach/streamline at the top of your stroke, so emphasizing that is good....but only to a point.  Generally, you'll want to press that and begin your next stroke right before you start to lose momentum.  If you wait in a streamline position too long, you'll start to slow down and then you'll just have to work harder to get back to the speed you were already at.  It takes time to get a real feel it, but if you focus on trying to feel your speed in the water, it'll come.  One thing you might want to think about (an I am not certain if you do or don't do this already) is avoiding a pause before your return.  Often, new swimmers will perform the pull, then pause their hands by their neck/jaw while they take their breath.  Avoid this.  Your hands should have a constant motion throughout the pull and return to streamline.  Think about accelerating your hands through this entire motion and drive your hands forward on the return.  Pull, drive your hands forward, press the streamline.    Pull, drive your hands forward, press the streamline.  Notice there's no ""stop for breath"" in there.  You're more trying to fit the breath in where you can rather than taking the time to stop and breathe.  Yes, you do want to breathe on each stroke, but the more you focus on taking that breath, the more likely you'll pause to take it, and sacrifice your hard-fought momentum."
Swimming,38jpgs,KingDamager,0,Thu Jun 4 18:23:42 2015 UTC,"You make some interesting points. I'm not sure what my hands are doing when I'm breathing. I think they're gathering and moving forward, but I'll check next time I get in the pool. I often feel like I'm pushing my head up too far to breathe, or perhaps just not getting it back into position quickly enough, which is very distracting.  I think I might be pausing too long after the kick. I was advised to pause and ""glide"" at that point, but I think I might actually be waiting until I've already slowed down to start the pull. I'll try to focus on keeping a more constant speed."
Swimming,38jpgs,KingDamager,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:06:03 2015 UTC,"Something that should help you long term, on your arm recovery, really focus on snapping your elbows together, so pull, as your arms come into recover really snap them in. It can help a lot with power in the stroke"

Swimming,38clh5,Louie3996,41,Wed Jun 3 10:13:00 2015 UTC,"This is an ongoing dilemma for most swimmers & I'm surprised it's not asked more often.   I've had my clothes thrown in the sea or up a cliff, or had stuff stolen, not ideal in 10C water when I may be very cold. I had one friend have all his clothes/towel etc taken while he was doing a 6 hour training swim.  However I solved this issue for myself a good few years ago. There are two components:   Keypod. I lock my keys in this and attach to my car or to something like railings etc if I am away without a car.  I use The Box. (It's just a basic plastic crate. That's not important). What is important is the overexaggerated & embarassing hyperbolic note I have stuck to it:   ""If you are wondering about this box, it is here because I am a long distance swimmer and I am out at sea swimming.

The first was more of a test-run for myself to see if I could handle ""interviewing"" for a spot on the team. The second and third were during taper, and it was basically the teams were buckling down, getting ready for conference champs. I ended up choosing the school I visited last just because it gave me the opportunity to get way faster, and they also offered a scholarship deal that I couldn't pass up on.   I also went on 3 unofficial visits. Two to the same school, and one to a different school. The schools were close to home so I could take an unofficial without a problem. There was a very big difference between my first and second unofficial. I got way faster this year, and the coaching staff welcomed me back the second time."

All of them were to different parts of the country and all of them were such a blast!! So much fun! My advice:  Just be honest and open about your goals and vision for your swimming career and academic career. There is no right or wrong answer here, it's about best fit for you and for them. Try and focus on the personalities of the team members. Do you like them? Do you see yourself fitting in? What kind of values and goals does the coach espouse, what kind of culture does the team seem to have? Are they really individualistic? Are they super team-oriented? What training methods does the coaching staff rely on? Are they more sprint-team, or distance-team?   They're watching you as much as you're watching them, but remember that the only reason they're paying for you to be there, and you've decided to spend a trip there, is because both parties are interested.    My experience was that you'll probably have a host that's sophomore/junior. Ask them TONS of questions. How are the professors? Do they like their teammates? How are the cops? Whatever you want. Just ask. Make friends. It may only be two days, but try and make a friend or two.    Also, pick everyone's brain about things you'll use on a day-to-day basis (parking, cafeteria/food, showers/bathrooms, computer labs, dorms, RA's, assistant coaches, traffic, night life, girls, etc.). Swimming will be a huge part of your life, but definitely not all of it. Cover as much as possible.  Everyone is usually really nice and the trip should give you a great impression of the best parts of the college experience. Don't be paranoid about having a little fun, but don't 'be that guy.' My dad struck the fear of god into me before I went on my first trip so I played it really calm and cool and didn't partake in anything. It was still fun, but you know...beer. The next two trips I went on I was asked if I wanted to party (they were nervous asking me because they are underage and could get in trouble, too). I said yeah. Basically, if they are doing it and you aren't the one suggesting the partying, then go for it. If you have drinks, they do too, and then they tell on you and they don't want you to attend based on that, then they probably don't have the healthiest dynamic working and you shouldn't go there in the first place."

Swimming,38b93s,SweetJebus731,5,Wed Jun 3 02:29:30 2015 UTC,"Keep at it. You will get it. This is common. Your coach may have already mentioned this, but sometimes the trick is to concentrate on exhaling, not on the breathing. Exhale whenever your face is in the water. If you exhale completely while your face is in the water you are ready to take the next breath as soon as you turn your head. You have more time to breath. If instead you worry too much about breathing, when your face is in the water you might forget about exhaling and then when it is time to breath and your face is turned out of the water you still have to exhale more before you can take in a new breath. Not what you want since you won't have as much time to breath! So exhale as soon as you put your face in the water and continue to exhale until you turn to breath again. That way you maximize the time to breath every stroke. Give it a try."

Just because you CAN swim a mile doens't mean you can swim 1.2 miles with 4000 other people in open, dark, and cold water and then bike 56 miles.   I've lifeguarded quite a few HIM (and done one in Michigan - Steelhead) - one year I was at the first turn buoy, maybe 200m from the start. You would not believe all the people hanging on my kayak. A few called it quits. 200m into a 70 + mile race.  Triathletes often/always underestimate the swim because of the distance and disregard the stress it has on your body. The more efficient/fast you are at swimming, the more energy you have for the rest of your day. People argue with me about this, but I think I'm 100% right.  /rant /soapbox."

Swimming,38cdct,KingDamager,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:45:00 2015 UTC,"I would absolutely not recommend this if you weren't a triathlete. It's awful swimming form.  Presuming you'll be in a wetsuit for race day, don't kick too hard. The wetsuit will provide a hell of a lot of floatation and put you in the correct position. The kick will take a hell of a lot of oxygen out of you but proportionally doesn't provide much power compared to your arms.   You want to probably go for a very slow kick for this given your experience. Equally given you've got the cycle and run after, the less you can kill your legs on the swim the better.  As I say, this is awful advice for swimming, but it'll help for beginner tri swim."
Swimming,38cdct,Jernight,-1,Sat Jun 6 19:22:30 2015 UTC,"1.2 miles of swimming is roughly 2000 yards of lap swimming, or 80 laps. That is a good   You want to build up your endurance and achieve at least 2000 before the week. If your cut time is to do all of that in under 70 minute you can divide your 500 (20 laps) between 17.5 minutes.  If you said you were a swimming before, you'll be surprised how comfortable it is getting back into things. You definitely won't have the endurance, but if you truly want to get back into it I'm sure you can.  Focus a lot on your kick! Your kick is the most important thing to any swimmer. Being a runner and a biker you should have nice built leg muscles and can really maximize your speed in swimming since you may or may not have the best technique with your freestyle and possibly having to use a wet suit."
Swimming,38cdct,gluver,5,Wed Jun 3 10:50:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not a runner, but isn't it odd to suggest that someone should focus on kicking in a long-distance swim, before they go on to bike and run for extended periods?    Kicking uses a lot of oxygen compared to pulling.  You will need your legs later, why burn them out? Take advantage of the efficiency of your upper body in the water, and save the legs for later. Leg effort expended on the bike will have much more payoff than leg effort expended in the water.    Kick is certainly necessary for rotation and body position, but it just seems strong to say it should be the focus of the triathlete's effort in the water. I would say moderate to minimal kick. My two cents."
Swimming,38cdct,TheGreatCthulhu,4,Wed Jun 3 16:24:21 2015 UTC,You are correct. Long distance swimmers have minimal kick. It's not worth the effort for the return.
Swimming,38c1py,WhaleMeatFantasy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:33:10 2015 UTC,"With better technique, your body will struggle less to do the same distance. So naturally, you will burn less calories, as you are now being more energy efficient.  When you have good technique, it's good to move away from long paced swims, and more into short timed splits.  For example, time yourself doing a 100free, at about 80-90% effort. Then proceed to do 6-8 of those as close to that time as possible. With no more than 30s rest between each 100. After that set, you can do a paced recovery swim to give your body a little time to relax before your next set.  By doing that, you should not only cover more distance in the same amount of time, but you'll push your body to build better endurance, faster.  Hope that makes sense."
Swimming,38c1py,Acandis,1 point,Wed Jun 3 10:11:17 2015 UTC,"As stated by /u/Acandis earlier you will be swimming more efficiently meaning you will be burning less calories.  If you are mainting 1k, 1000 meters/yards, that is roughly a 10 minute pace per 500, which is pretty good for never taking lessons and just focusing on technique by stuff you are using online.  A great way to maximize your time in the pool, being as you stay in the pool for only 20 minutes at a time, is try to do 2 sets of 10 minute swims at a 80-90% effort. Swim for the first 8:30 and finish up whatever lap you are on during before that final minute starts to tick down. This will give you roughly 1 minute of rest and you should start as soon as it comes around.  Take count of your laps for the first 9 minutes out of the 10, before your rest minute rest and then take count of how many laps you do for the full 10 minutes to gauge how tired/fatigued you become."
Swimming,38c1py,Jernight,1 point,Wed Jun 3 10:58:11 2015 UTC,"Like the other's mention, you will burn less calories if you swim the same distance in the same time with better technique. But if you swim more distance in the same time, you'll make up those calories.   Getting bored is why lot's of people look at me crazy for loving my 3500yd 1hr swims but I am not bored because I break up the distance with a series of intervals and I swim at a high intensity for most of them.  It's hard to be bored when you're barely holding on to your target pace.    I like what /u/Acandis says with timing your 100 free, I would just add that you could also try a 100m free flat out, fast as you can and then set a new target for it, say 5 or 10 seconds faster.  Check in on it every couple of weeks and as your technique and endurance improve you'll get closer to it.  That's what makes swimming fun for me personally is trying to get my 100m free down to 1:00 even."

Works better on old-timey plastic HR monitors. More comfortable elastic chest straps move too much.  Also, at least Polar has a handle for easier use of the chestband, if you leave it at the pool end. This is marketed as ""Polar Equine Test Handle"" (originally meant for use with horses)."

Swimming,384f0k,graham_m_dunn,3,Mon Jun 1 21:28:30 2015 UTC,"Actually, HR is used in a whole lot of swim training, and has been used for a long time. For advanced swimmers, I'd expect that they know how fast they can swim, and thus can be directed by telling them to do specific intervals. The relationship between HR, speed and effort level can be measured with a lactate test. (You can estimate anaerobic threshold with a well-swum 30 minute test.)  However, heart rate monitors are a useful training aid when you're learning a specific zone. For example, if you've been going too fast for most of your sets, learning to swim endurance. If you're having shorter rest times, it is helpful to have the chestband on, so you don't need to stop, look for the chestband, let's see if the monitor unit gets the signal, etc. etc. With some practice and a clear enough display you may also check HR while swimming during a long set.  If you're doing altitude training, HR monitoring is probably necessary as before your body adapts to the thinner air. Otherwise you run into a risk of overtraining and getting ill, spoiling the altitude training camp."

Swimming,384f0k,HCSarise,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:03:48 2015 UTC,"Suunto ambit3 is a triathlon watch that has a chest strap capable of recording HR while swimming. The problem is that HR straps have difficulty transmitting through the water that breaks up the signal. The suunto ambit3 gets around this by recording and storing HR on the strap until it can transmit (presumably when you push off and the arm is closer).   Apart from that I've heard success with using an optical heart rate monitor immediately next to the watch you're using (or possibly a watch with optical heart rate built in). Notably the Mio brand has had success with recording swimming heart rate and transmitting to the watch in this manner.   Personally though I just use my Garmin swim. It's got just about everything else I could want except open water swimming mode (gps ability) and heart rate...both of which make the unit more expensive. I do value heart rate data though, I am a triathlete and use power/heart rate to train on the bike and running I predominately use heart rate these days after spending 9+ years using pace."

Swimming,380i53,ABabyAteMyDingo,3,Mon Jun 1 07:58:53 2015 UTC,"Usually, the faster you swim, the better you float. This is due to planing forces (hydrodynamic lift).

Swimming,380i53,avataRJ,-3,Mon Jun 1 08:40:20 2015 UTC,"That force is incredibly small. Any physics and coaching discussion I've seen completely discounts it.   http://coachsci.sdsu.edu/swim/bullets/lift29.htm  It's definitely not relevant here, he's clearly not a fast swimmer."
Swimming,380i53,ABabyAteMyDingo,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:43:59 2015 UTC,"That article talks of an entirely different matter. During the glory days of the S-pull, there was a theory (which probably still has some supporters) that on top of pushing and pulling water, the sideways movement of the hand added forward propulsion due to Bernoulli forces (i.e. your hand acted as a wing).  Vertical planing lift should be possible to achieve, as fast swimmers can exceed their ""hull speed"" while swimming. I'm not that good on the theoretical side whether you could exceed the hull speed without planing with good streamlining while swimming, and in addition if the catch pushed down there will be some hydrodynamic lift (due to pushing water down)."
Swimming,380i53,avataRJ,1 point,Mon Jun 1 09:15:40 2015 UTC,"Hull speed:       Hull speed or displacement speed is the speed at which the wavelength of the boat's bow wave (in displacement mode) is equal to the boat length. As boat speed increases from rest, the wavelength of the bow wave increases, and usually its crest to trough dimension (height) increases as well. When hull speed is reached, a boat in pure displacement mode will appear trapped in a trough behind its very large bow wave.  From a technical perspective, at hull speed the bow and stern waves interfere constructively, creating relatively large waves, and thus a relatively large value of wave drag. Though the term ""hull speed"" seems to suggest that it is some sort of ""speed limit"" for a boat, in fact drag for a displacement hull increases smoothly and at an increasing rate with speed as hull speed is approached and exceeded, often with no noticeable inflection at hull speed.  The concept of hull speed is not used in modern naval architecture, where considerations of speed-length ratio or Froude number are considered more helpful.

ESPN just covers all things sports, so they're going to do a good job covering football without spending all their time on the minutia of the sport.

Swimming,37z4cp,SpeedoTan,7,Sun May 31 17:04:24 2015 UTC,"The best way I can sum up galloping stroke is that it isn't something you should adjust your stroke to do, but if you're swimming fast and it happens I wouldn't worry about it too much."
Swimming,37z4cp,KingDamager,3,Sun May 31 22:19:36 2015 UTC,"In some cases having a galloping stroke is better. But it an individual basis.  I am stronger with my right arm then my left arm, which occasionally throws a gallop to my rhythm, especially in my 100 free.   The benefit could be that you pull more water with a gallop with the hand that is deeper, by having a larger surface area exposed. It takes a lot of core strength to do it properly without misaligning the body in the water, creating more drag."
Swimming,37z4cp,bugchild9,1 point,Sun May 31 20:11:57 2015 UTC,I agree. I always thought (and still think) that creating a lope in my stroke for long-course/ open water helps me to maintain my speed. But I could be making that up.
Swimming,37z4cp,globesurfer122,2,Sun May 31 23:51:32 2015 UTC,"Up-down gallop is probably harmful. However, it is probably possible to make asymmetric rhythm to work. For it to work, you'll need to have very good catch on the off-hand, i.e. the arm on the not-breathing side. This is because pushing water down creates drag.  So, Hulk-style bashing and stopping rhythm is bad. Using the stronger arm to do a pull and then steamlining a bit while breathing is better.  There is still tactical advantage on being able to breathe both sides. E.g. if you can only breathe on the right, and you start on lane five, you won't see well the swimmer on lane four when coming back, like on the final pool length. Psychological effect of this depends on the swimmer.  It is worth to remember that a lot of people are good despite some quite visible things they do, not because these highly visible quirks."

Doing 100 on the 2:00 would mean you have 25 seconds rest ( a bit too long if you can do 100 on 1:35) and you start each 100m every 2 minutes.  Generally you are not tracking sets for improvements. The best way to track improvement is a max swim (50/100m sprint, or 200 or 400). You can then use this chart to calculate your pace times at different rates of perceived exertion based on those max times."

To me, the first few or maybe first half warm you up for the rest of the set. After that, we do sets like five 200s of freestyle on the 4:00, which I end up missing the beep on. Last week we had to swim 6-10 (I forgot how many) 50s of freestyle on 1:00, which I also miss the beep on. We also swim 25m IM (switching between strokes after each beep), which I also miss the beep on. I'm slow that I miss the beep on almost everything."
Swimming,380261,Bubbay,2,Mon Jun 1 00:56:58 2015 UTC,"It seems like you're focused on the beep.  I get why -- no one likes to feel like they are behind and this is probably stronger since the people ahead of you are younger -- but that singular focus on the interval (the beep) is probably part of the problem.  When you're doing these sets, is there anything the coach is telling you to work on?  Are they saying things like ""focus on streamlines"" or ""do these catch-up stroke""?  If so, worry about that more than the interval.  Those things are intended to help you improve your stroke.  Improving your stroke will help you be more efficient, so you'll get tired slower.  It will also help you with being faster, so you won't miss the beep as often.  Focus on your technique.  You're at a point where the people in your lane are faster than you.  They are going to lap you.  You are probably going to miss some intervals.  Accept this and move on.  I know that's easier said than done (far easier said than done), but it really is step one.  Talk to your coach.  Ask about how your stroke is doing.  Talk to them about your frustrations and how you want to get better, but are having a hard time because you're having difficulty keeping up.  Ask what you can work on to improve your stroke.  Listen to what they say.  Ask questions if you need to.  Focus on that when you are in the water.  Finally, stop skipping parts of the workout.  If you miss your interval, keep going.  I guarantee it is noticed.  If people are lapping you, that's fine.  Move aside and let them go through.  Try not to get in the way of someone moving faster than you.  Don't take it personally and keep focusing in what you need to work on.  I know that when I was coaching, I would rather my swimmer keep pushing through and I stop them before they are finished so we can move on than have them skip a section so they can catch up.  Don't give up.  It's going to be very hard at first, but if you keep working at it and stop skipping parts of the workout you will get better.  Good luck this season!"

Swimming,37x29c,QsGirl,2,Sun May 31 03:11:48 2015 UTC,"Could it be because I might be starting the pull from when my arm is fully extended? When I watch this video it says from fully extended to 90 degrees is not a powerful movement, but from 90 degrees to when you bring your arm around is the pull. From taking swimming lessons when I was a kid no one said the pull started from 90 degrees, I've always pulled from parallel."
Swimming,37x29c,QsGirl,3,Sun May 31 03:20:49 2015 UTC,"I think the answer to your question is ""probably not,"" but this is why you should get the advice of an in-person coach or instructor. That initial part after your hand goes in the water, what we call ""the catch,"" is not the most powerful part of your stroke, but you are pulling some water there. Your stroke could definitely need some tweaking and that might help, but, again, it's probably best to get the advice of somebody who can see what's going on. Sometimes people over-rotate their arms before the entry into the water and that causes shoulder pain. Sometimes they reach and pull across the midpoint of their body on entry or during the pull. It's just not going to be helpful to speculate without seeing your stroke!  Also, again, since you have pain both in and out of the pool while using your shoulder, you really should see a doctor for the pain and a coach for the technique concerns. You're not going to solve shoulder pain that happens in and out of the water by asking some online swimming experts about something you might do that we can't see."

It may be further defined as the event in which an individual fails to recognize an unexpected stimulus that is in plain sight. The term was coined by Arien Mack and Irvin Rock in 1992 and was used as the title of their book of the same name, published by MIT press in 1998.  Here, they describe the discovery of inattentional blindness and include a collection of procedures used describing the phenomenon.  Research [citation needed] on inattentional blindness suggests that the phenomenon can occur in any individual, independent of cognitive deficits. When it simply becomes impossible for one to attend to all the stimuli in a given situation, a temporary blindness effect can take place as a result; that is, individuals fail to see objects or stimuli that are unexpected and quite often salient.

Swimming,37sqnn,shiroboon,2,Sat May 30 02:17:21 2015 UTC,It will take time to get back to where you where with the endurance and speed. I'd say it will take about a month working really hard in practice to get back to your previous speed. It would help to know what your time in the mile is now and the average yardage your are swimming in practice. Also one thing I can't stress enough is even though your technique feels fine you should defiantly get some critiques on it because its been 5 years and you don't want a shoulder injury.  If you don't have a coach I would be willing to help you on technique if you want to video yourself.

Once you are less nervous (and it only takes a swim or two to realize you are unlikely to be eaten by sharks or a pack of snapping turtles...), concentrate on sighting and navigation. For a 2k, you don't need to worry about feeding/hydration strategies.

Swimming,37nt9p,Shifty03,2,Thu Jun 4 13:51:29 2015 UTC,The best way to do a flip turn is to tuck your head into your chest and let that lead the rest of your body over. Make sure to remember tuck your knees into your chest as well once you've started turning as it helps with the rotation. Keep your arms in roughly the same position from start to finish so you can go straight into streamline. I use to be really bad at tumble turns until i kept practicing and now I've got one of the fastest turns in my squad :)

Swimming,37mc32,PaperTemplar,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:35:02 2015 UTC,Dull muscle aches are normal. These will happen with a hard workout or new exercise. With adequate recovery time your body will adapt to the workload.  Sharp or stabbing pains are bad and may indicate injury or joint issues. If you experience these types you should not continue. Instead stop immediately. Do not add significant volume to your workouts. Instead do this gradually over time.

Swimming,37juof,cptmcdouble,2,Thu May 28 04:35:34 2015 UTC,"Ahhh....the pains and tirals of building up your lactic acid tolerance.  Sounds like you're building up acids in your muscles, causing the 40 minute fatigue and cramping.  Sure, breathing more may help, but your real goal should be to continue to build up to this fatigue point, and try to improve on that.  For now, with the cramps, make sure your post workout contains (obviously water) but also a recovery supplement.  I took Endurox back in the day, and the results were seen within a few weeks.  Stretching, or something like 'Dryland' pilates or yoga may help.  Remember that your pool time is aerobic, so recovery afterwards should be standard practice.  Without proper stretching and recovery, the lactic acid remains, and inhibits muscle growth."
Swimming,37juof,elcalrissian,1 point,Thu May 28 12:38:24 2015 UTC,"What are some ""proper"" stretches that that one can do to help get rid of lactic acid?"
Swimming,37juof,Eggmebabyonemoretime,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:01:13 2015 UTC,"short answer: yes. but don't breath every stroke and try to develop a breathing pattern, preferably one that forces you to breath to both sides. bananas and lots of water will help too like others have said"
Swimming,37juof,allmightygriff,1 point,Thu May 28 06:30:12 2015 UTC,"I would imagine more breathing might increase cramping, since you'll be delivering more power. There are multiple causes to cramp ... but ultimately it's 'overworked muscle'. If your technique is imbalanced then you'll be overworking some muscle ... here, your calfs. When your calf's become fatigued, your tech ique becomes imbalanced in some other way, and the cramp will spread to a different muscle group.  Either you correct your muscles to fit your technique, or vice versa. Trying to work through cramp will only prolong recovery and doesn't strengthen the muscle, and will confuse muscle memory. Avoid.  Calf strengthening exercises throughout the day (outside of the pool) of 10-12 reps, 3 sets, as often as possible ... increasing to 15-18, 5 sets, as often as you like (1000 / day?) will strengthen calf's. Weights are also an option. Obviously you still need pool time. Keep ankles supple and relaxed (do you have previous injury?)"
Swimming,37juof,yangYing,1 point,Thu May 28 10:45:08 2015 UTC,"I would say develop a breathing pattern that you're comfortable with and WARM UP and stretch your muscles and tendons before you start your swim. The muscles that start to hurt and cramp first while you're exercising are the least that you used to work out throughout your life. Give them a good stretch and warm them up and do some deep breathing exercises even before you hit the water to prevent them from contracting. Then don't forget to warm up AGAIN when you hit the water.   You said you are now finally able to do the fly. I don't know about your technique and style, but having a wrong technique while swimming might be one of the reasons why muscles contract and hence, cramp. Doing unnecessary moves or holding and contracting your muscles in a wrong position for long periods would definitely lead to muscle cramps."
Swimming,37juof,sfenderbender,1 point,Thu May 28 13:09:01 2015 UTC,"Part of my issue is that I usually swim at the end of my workout after hitting the gym or courts.  Then, I save the more intense fly and dolphin kick sets until the end of my mile in the pool.  I do drink water poolside during my workout, often finishing off 64oz by the end of my swim (2 hours workout time).  My technique definitely has room for improvement, especially involving my whole body in the dolphin kick.  I feel like I am breathing adequately throughout my swim, except for those longer kick turns when my lungs are screaming for me to surface.  It's usually not until the dolphin kicking that I start to cramp."
Swimming,37juof,sfenderbender,1 point,Thu May 28 16:45:57 2015 UTC,"Does the same thing happen when you start off your work out by swimming first?  When I swim after my fitness and strength training, I end up having less energy for my swim and that's normal. Try not to work out the muscles that cramp that much before your swim, do less reps for instance so you wouldn't exhaust them.  Of course, work on improving your butterfly technique. Is the power required to perform the butterfly techniques correctly equally performed by your upper and lower body? Or are you working out your lower muscles more than your upper ones? Are you flexible enough? I can't really point out where the problem in your technique is unless I see it; but, you can always be your own  coach and critique and we'd be glad to help out more if you provide us with more info or vids.  As for your lungs screaming for air, again, find a rhythmic breathing pattern that you're comfortable with and this comes with practice; keep trying out different patterns and it's also a matter of endurance and you can definitely build it up with persistence and practice.  I would suggest, if possible, that you separate your swim and fitness days for a while until you figure it out. And finally, warm up those muscles before your strength training and before your swim (out of the water and then when you start swimming do some laps to warm up and relax)."

Swimming,37j759,chrom_ed,5,Thu May 28 01:12:56 2015 UTC,"Don't ever waste time or peace of mind worrying about that. Everyone has ups and downs. Phelps has bad meets. The best thing you can do is analyze your races, if you can do something better take note, and move on. Sometimes you can't do anything better because you just didn't have it that day.   Not to say you should ignore opportunities to improve, but don't dwell on bad days/meets/sets. They happen. The people that get stuck on them can let a bad race ruin a whole meet, or a bad set during taper psyche them out. That's entirely under your control and that's what you should avoid."
Swimming,37j759,allmightygriff,2,Thu May 28 03:46:07 2015 UTC,"your on a plateau man. they suck. you feel awful and no matter how hard you try, you just can't get any faster, no matter how hard you work. keep working hard and eventually you'll drop off and feel awesome about your improvement.   you can't always drop time so don't let a few bad practices or meets get you down."
Swimming,37j759,morrah,2,Thu May 28 06:39:30 2015 UTC,"Just a random thought - What time of day do you have practice?  I used to swim 5am and 330pm, so.. right before and right after school.  At 5am no one eats anything before practice, it would just make you feel sick. And I usually didn't have time to eat before practice in the afternoons because of the short gap between class and getting to the pool.  Meets though, those I made sure I had eaten x amount of time before, along with everything mental that goes with racing.  Maybe your practices are slower than your races because you're eating better/more mentally prepared for a meet than you are six times a week, every week?"
Swimming,37j759,ElCapitan69,3,Thu May 28 09:34:20 2015 UTC,"Couldn't have said it better. You are a competitor. Some of the best swimmers I have swam with just couldn't get into practice but when they stepped into the blocks they had fire in their eyes and flew. Don't worry about your practice times because honestly who cares, just continue to give 110%. Swimming is a racing sport. Your a race. Concentrate on that."
Swimming,37j759,Daveyup,5,Thu May 28 03:10:54 2015 UTC,"You and me are completely the same! Finally someone like me! I'm actually just a year older, so I don't think we could be in any similar of a position. What I've found about myself is that my practice TIMES are not what I value. There are 2 aspects to it for me.  A.) Mentality: If I get out of the pool and think ""wow that was an awful practice"" I'm probably right. You know your body better than anyone, and how you feel while swimming is probably how you're doing. So maybe base yourself on how you feel during and after sets.  B.) Heart Rate!: I don't see this mentioned on here a lot, but your heart rate is a great indicator of how hard you're working. Find out what your resting hr is, and then find different intervals based on how hard you're working and use that to gauge.  Times aren't everything in this practice. In meets, they are, but when you're in a meet, if you're getting good results, then you know you're doing something right."
Swimming,37j759,PartyPatComeback,3,Thu May 28 01:15:45 2015 UTC,"Club practices six days a week are no joke; you will be tired, and it will reflect in your meets and practices until you taper. That, or your skill set (backstroke sprinter) isnt as suited for practice (mid distance freestyle) as your teamates. Either way with your dedication and those times, you are fine, stay on the grind."
Swimming,37j759,tamtt,3,Thu May 28 02:20:43 2015 UTC,"On top of everything else, at your age body strength and training ability vary wildly from person to person. As long as you are putting in the effort to improve, not just your fitness, but your stroke technique, the rest will come.  Technique is highly important in training, it is what allows you to go large distances without much drop off on your times. The people I used to beat in training (and still do) would always go faster than me in meets because they could move faster than I could. Once I hit 16 though, all the technique came through and my times improved dramatically.  Now I'm not saying you are bad at technique, but it is certainly something to look at when you are struggling in training. A body length off every turn just because you streamline better than the other guy, an extra couple of inches on each stroke, kicking slightly more than normal etc. pays off big time over a couple of hundred lengths.  Something to think about in your next training session."
Swimming,37j759,tamtt,1 point,Thu May 28 10:06:07 2015 UTC,"I won't deny my freestyle technique is a little different. My coaches are helping me fix it but it's a slow process. They haven't said anything about it being the reason for a slower freestyle, just a less efficient one"
Swimming,37j759,dolphinboy1637,1 point,Thu May 28 14:52:16 2015 UTC,"More efficient means that they won't have to work as hard in training. When racing, until you get strong enough to hold it, your technique will go to shit anyway. That's probably why you are faster in races. I would say, don't worry about being at the front of the lane for a bit (if you are, that's great, but don't make it your main focus), make your main focus what your coach is telling you, your catch on the water, and streamline off the turns (try to get past 5m every time). The little things add up once you get older and stronger, and you will be a better swimmer because of it :)"
Swimming,37j759,dHUMANb,2,Thu May 28 15:09:46 2015 UTC,"I would rather trade with you. I'm one of those people who can work and kill it in practice. And swim with some of the best guys on the team but come race day they demolish me in events. Be proud you can race when it counts and when it matters. If you're working as hard as you can as well as you can then dont sweat it. Cause you're still beating them in the end anyway. I know it might be a bit demoralizing to see them out swim you every day. But just trust in your training, trust your body, and show those other guys up every race day. And take pride in your ability to do so. Don't sweat it kid. (I'd rather be you tbh)"
Swimming,37j759,Rizzo707,1 point,Thu May 28 02:25:31 2015 UTC,"As long as you're working hard with proper technique i don't think it really matters where in the lane you end up in practice. Unless you're stagnating, don't fix what ain't broke. You're already faster than I ever was so keep up the good work! If 100s are your thing maybe you can add in some dry land and see what happens with a little extra muscle but otherwise i see nothing wrong with your results."

Swimming,37hhda,TheGreatCthulhu,0,Thu May 28 00:23:05 2015 UTC,"This is partially due to your mammalian dive reflex kicking in.  As soon as you are submerged, your heart rate slows and blood starts to get shunted away from your extremities.  Once you start swimming, your body has to adjust again by increasing blood flow to the muscles you are using.  I also seem to kick into a ""zone"" after the first 8-10 laps."
Swimming,37hhda,soundkite,2,Thu May 28 16:57:31 2015 UTC,"Ah, this is incorrect in two ways. MDR is an  over quoted mechanism that is likely not at all related here. Pool temperatures are usually >28C so MDR isn't initiated nor is PVC, (Peripheral vaso constriction) which also needs cold water to take effect."
Swimming,37hhda,TheGreatCthulhu,1 point,Thu May 28 18:12:16 2015 UTC,"This is very interesting to me, as I swim in both cold and warm water.  I can't help but think that my body's physiology somehow relaxes as soon as I feel the ""shock"" of warmer pool water.  You are likely right that MDR is  over quoted.  Perhaps other sensory triggers are involved.  For example, some free divers use a trick of blowing air on the nostrils of a blacked out diver because they say our nose has sensors which automatically stop our breathing when submerged.  Then, of course, there could be the simple Pavlovian response for those of us who find comfort in the water.  Also, interesting that you say peripheral vasoconstriction is unaltered in a warmer swimming pool, as warm pools are still quite cooler than our body temp and serve to drop our core temp.  I don't doubt your claim, but it does surprise me."

If you want to learn how to swim you need to get your ass in the pool!  And don't worry if you're with older people or younger, everyone is there to learn and have fun! Remember, everyone started from the bottom.   And, if you get better at swimming, you'll kick your friend's asses!

Swimming,37ewa1,avataRJ,1 point,Wed May 27 20:58:41 2015 UTC,"Our club, for example, has all groups open based on skill level. We have a few 14 year olds at the basic course. Prerequisites include capability to get dressed and undressed themselves, float and ability to somehow move 25 meters in the pool. So if you're ok at learning with people younger than yourself, it's probably a-ok. You should check with your parents directly with the school, swim school or the swimming team what they can offer for you.  There is of course the psychological side, but physically, a lot of issues faced when we're learning to swim are caused by instincts that are beneficial should we try to walk on land. It is possible to unlearn these reflexes under controlled conditions. Most of us float naturally (though not very high in the water, if I float upright I'm in the water up to my eyebrows or so), though some movements (including paradoxically the reflex to pull head up) make it harder to keep the mouth above the surface."
Swimming,37ewa1,sfenderbender,1 point,Wed May 27 21:15:38 2015 UTC,"The Swimming Without Stress YouTube channel is a good way to get started: https://www.youtube.com/user/swimwithoutstress/videos They also dedicated a video for swimming in deep waters: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seHAI4uxbnY  I know someone who used to attend swimming classes for beginners with 5-year-old kids and he was 27 years old. There's nothing to be ashamed of and it's completely normal to feel the way you feel. Take it easy, breathe, relax, and try not to overthink your fears.  I assume you have some basic swimming skills in shallow water. If I were you, I would try to overcome my fear of deep waters in a pool and not in open waters. Start off by hanging on the wall and slowly crawl your way into the deep (if the pool where you swim allows it). Don't do anything that you're not comfortable doing. I know, sometimes, peer pressure might sneak in and get to you; but always be confident and only do what you know you're capable of and comfortable with.   Good luck!"

Try to eat plenty of protein and don't reduce your calories by too much. And rest; to develop your muscle tone, they need to rest and repair.  I had the same problems for years, swimming every day (around 1.5-2km) and always sore somewhere. Either elbows, shoulders or knees. When I realised I'd lost enough fat, I started weightlifting as well as swimming, and started eating and resting properly. I don't get sore at all any more, even with heavy lifting."
Swimming,37eg9t,Danwold,1 point,Wed May 27 05:37:18 2015 UTC,"Sore muscles from swimming longer distances is a good sign. Like former commentators mentioned, some rest would do the job and get you back in the waters and the amount of rest you get should depend on your training load. The more the load is, the more rest you should get and vice versa.  However, some people would get way too much rest which would make them lose the progress they just made and that, my friend, is the tricky part. Don't get too much rest and don't go too hard on yourself. Find YOUR balance. How? This comes with practice, experience, and most importantly CONSISTENCY.  It is also very important to know the difference between soreness that results from training load and between pain that results from training injury. The latter of course requires more rest and some special attention."

Swimming,37cgky,ifallalot,2,Wed May 27 11:13:10 2015 UTC,"On mobile, bear with me.  First and foremost I'm only 22 didn't swim in college but my times were a slight bit faster than yours and I shared your sentiments but only in retrospect (which I have come to regret)  Now it looks like your looking for advice.  There is literally no point in wasting your time with a team that you hate if you know you're not going to swim later and you're finishing up. Now that I've read some comments I also see this is the closest team so switching isn't an option. Now its time to reevaluate and be honest. Do you hate your club because of the structure? The people? Lack of own self success? All of the above?  When I came back to swimming after what I thought would be the end and a 4 year competitive hiatus I started with only technique work. Then I reapproached everything. I swam because I wanted to get faster and because I wanted to be there. I swam on my own a bit and found a swim experience I liked - masters. I would try out some workouts on your own in between club workouts focusing on USRPT or look at Dave salos book on sprinting. Then structure your own workouts. There's a lot you can do between now and the end of your swim season and swim teams can want you. If you find you can push yourself on your own then quit your club team. If not use the yardage at club to create aerobic base to better your individual workouts. Then when high school comes around drop the club entirely and do what your mind is telling you. Don't look back and resent your club years simply because YOU decided to stay. make sure to contact colleges now that way you know what they want and keep them updated through these next few months.  Best of luck and may the black line at the bottom always guide you - lolzerdidoodle"
Swimming,37cgky,codedapple,1 point,Tue May 26 19:44:44 2015 UTC,I absolutely love USRPT! It is in my opinion the most fun part of swimming. The only time I get to do USRPT practices though is when I do them alone.
Swimming,37cgky,kansascrime,1 point,Tue May 26 20:13:05 2015 UTC,"USRPT isnt some magic solve all that it gets talked up as imo. Elite open swimmers still have to have a well rounded set of skills. I definitely dont think there is a need to swim 110km a week like some coaches do, but kick is arguably the most important part of swimming for all strokes. A great kick can hide a lot of weaknesses.  Ultimately training isnt meant to be all fun, your coach is at some point going to ask you to do something that you really dont want to do. That isnt to say the coach you currently have is or isnt good, it is just part of the deal. If you want a sport where everything is fun and easy you have chosen the wrong one."

Swimming,37ai11,sassy_s,4,Tue May 26 04:41:36 2015 UTC,"I started properly about three weeks ago, three times a week, so I've had about ten sessions of between 30-45 mins.   First time I struggled my way up to twenty lengths of a 25m pool, the next few times I worked up increasing by four lengths each time, so 24, 28, 32, and now I'm up to being able to do 40 lengths in about 40 minutes.   I don't think I want to go too much further at this stage, as I only get 45 minutes in the pool before I have to go to work, but if I can get up to 50 lengths I then want to start getting stronger so that I can do those 50 lengths faster and faster. This is probably the part where some technique and coaching might come in handy, but I just want to be able to have the stamina to do the distance first."
Swimming,37ai11,islandbaggers,3,Tue May 26 08:51:46 2015 UTC,"Which stroke are you doing?  It's interesting to hear about your pace as it is roughly the same as mine.

This morning I managed 38 lengths (950 metres) which I was pretty pleased with. The best thing has been how much my technique has improved. I don't have any coaching but have read up on a couple of links on this site which had a couple of handy tips. Also as my weight drops I go faster and faster. I have lost 8 kg's so far.

Swimming,379cb0,aqg10,5,Mon May 25 22:52:58 2015 UTC,"Hey! I also have very long, thick hair (down to my butt) and it's my experience that latex swim caps are a big struggle, but the more matte (non-shiny) silicone swim caps work okay. (It looks like the Speedo long hair swim cap is silicone, but slightly shiny? I am just basing this on pictures online; I have never seen this product in person.)  What I do is put my hair into a bun on the top of my head, pull my silicone swim cap as low as I can (low low low), and stuff in any hair that hasn't made it in as high as I can. Then I adjust my goggles so one strap is across (or sometimes over) the giant hair lump in the cap and one is under it.   This method works okay for me, and I have had a history of having swim cap issues due to my long hair. It sounds like your hair may be curly, though, if you are comparing to Hermione, so YMMV. My hair is wavy at best. For purposes of scale, this is what my hair looks like."

The latex ones certainly pull a lot more on the hair.  A friend of mine buys the 'long hair' latex caps to wear under the mandatory event cap, but her very thick and curly hair is still just below shoulder length. If you have very very long and curly hair, google caps for afro/dreadlock hair styles - they do exist!"

Swimming,379cb0,jiyounglife,1 point,Tue May 26 01:35:04 2015 UTC,I put my hair in a very loose bun. I switched from using a silicon cap to latex because it stays on better for me.

Swimming,379jg4,fattaharif,3,Mon May 25 23:49:39 2015 UTC,"If you want strength without much size/weight then you should go with weight lifting, specifically Olympic style lifting. So lifts like snatch, clean and jerk, clean and press.   Note that this is slightly different to power lifting in that the movements performed are different, as power lifting has a focus on squats, bench press, and deadlifts. I personally train like this, and there really is more of a focus on brute force in really not many muscle groups per lift. This is good for building size and strength, but you just want strength.  Another to obviously avoid is a bodybuilding style routine. Swimming will get you an aesthetic body anyway, and that is the real only purpose of hypertrophy training. You get more size but a bit less strength (given equal amounts of commitment over time).  Olympic lifting is often also often known as just ""weight lifting"". There's plenty of programs out on google. I don't really know any oly programs so I can't much recommend one. /r/weightlifting and /r/olympiclifting are both decent though, with the former being significantly more active.  I recommend reading the FAQ of /r/weightlifting. The non-sub-specific stuff there is pretty good, particularly the section What is [Olympic] Weightlifting?. Commit the 30 minutes and read up a bit and check some of the links and find a program that fits your availability, equipment, and goals.  Adding lifting will change your nutritional requirements a bit if you track that closely. It depends how much you care about that, but basically just add a little protein. I am no nutritionist.  This is just my thoughts on things anyway. I'm no professional, just a guy with an interest."
Swimming,379jg4,modernbenoni,1 point,Tue May 26 00:14:41 2015 UTC,"If I were to choose powerlifting, then what would be a good balance of swimming and lifting? Some people have said doing cardio more than one day a week in addition to 5x5 is overkill. Do you know of any links or sites that talk about balancing this stuff out?"
Swimming,379jg4,intangiblemango,2,Tue May 26 17:55:46 2015 UTC,"Some people have said doing cardio more than one day a week in addition to 5x5 is overkill.   Personally, I do cardio (mixed type-- running, swimming, biking, or occasionally something else) 6 days a week and lift 3 days a week and that doesn't feel excessive or exhausting to me. (Lifting first, cardio second.) Listen to your body. You might need to do slightly less if you are only swimming as your cardio to give yourself more of a break, for example. But one day a week is not enough if your goal is to be a fabulous swimmer..."
Swimming,379jg4,modernbenoni,1 point,Tue May 26 18:48:41 2015 UTC,"Well that's one of the reasons I recommended weight lifting; it's easier to strip down a routine so as to not effect swimming too much, while still getting decent gains.  Your goals are different to normal goals which will be discussed with most powerlifting routines. If you haven't got any experience then you're better starting out on Starting Strength rather than 5x5. They're very similar but SS is better for beginner progress.  For your needs I think you'd be better off just doing a few months of lifting and figuring out how to best do it to fit your routine and goals. Once you get those beginner gains they're quite easy to hold onto anyway. You could alternatively do an upper/lower split, which would enable you to work out just twice a week. Obviously gains won't be as fast as with three or four workouts a week, but this way your swimming won't suffer. Remember what your primary goal is going into this!"
Swimming,379jg4,intangiblemango,1 point,Tue May 26 18:35:27 2015 UTC,What kind of swim workouts go best with lifting? Are there any programs or routines I could look into?
Swimming,379jg4,intangiblemango,5,Fri Jun 12 12:13:56 2015 UTC,"You definitely don't have to gain weight to lift, including powerlifting (I note this since someone else suggested that oly is the way to go if you don't want size, and that is NOT your only option). I am a lady and I do powerlifting along with swimming and running and I have not changed weight at all. I look like this, or if I flex, like this. I am slimmer because I have more muscle/less fat, but my weight is the same.   Also, if you want to stay the same weight, don't go to /r/gainit (which is the other suggestion at the time that I am writing this), because that is literally the point of /r/gainit.   You don't have to train for hypertrophy in a beginner lifting program and, indeed, beginner lifting programs like Starting Strength or Strong Lifts 5X5 are NOT hypertrophy programs-- they are strength programs. They would be perfectly appropriate to pair with swimming for someone who didn't want to put on mass. What weight you end up at is going to be based on your eating, though. (If you eat more, you get stronger faster, but you also gain weight. That's why people bulk and cut.) If you eat at maintenance while lifting heavy, you are doing something called recomp, which is what I am doing, and you'll stay at the same weight but have more muscle/get stronger. It takes longer, but it certainly works. It sounds to me like that is what you want.  Lifting weights will make you faster in the water."
Swimming,379jg4,intangiblemango,1 point,Tue May 26 00:48:55 2015 UTC,Do you feel yourself getting hungry often by eating at maintenance or is it still a filling amount of food?

Swimming,379jg4,peanuts51,0,Fri Jun 12 14:41:17 2015 UTC,"Weight lifting isn't the only way to go, but it is the best way to maximise strength gains while minimising weight gains.

Swimming,379jg4,evanshall,2,Tue May 26 13:47:00 2015 UTC,5x5 is to gain strength not really meant to gain muscle mass. Muscle mass is more through high sets and high reps like 4x12
Swimming,379jg4,Tyler77i,1 point,Tue May 26 01:34:33 2015 UTC,"5x5 with the same weight across all sets can still be ""hypertrophy training."" What determines whether or not your muscles grow is not necessarily the rep ranges themselves, but total volume in a certain workout. 10x3, 5x5, and 3x10 will all cause similar amounts of hypertrophy. The differences between the 3 is that with 10x3, you'll be better at sets of 3, with 5x5, you'll better at doing sets of 5, etc.   Here is a video better explaining this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTDapcklnV8 There's also a study done by Brad Schoenfeld proving these facts."
Swimming,3788qx,InkognitoV,2,Mon May 25 18:06:48 2015 UTC,"You should definitely ask a coach - we don't know your strengths or weaknesses, we've never seen you swim, we don't know what equipment you have available to you, etc. Furthermore, creating workouts isn't a simple task. Coaches go through a lot of training to learn how to do it properly and effectively. Coaches also get paid a fair bit to produce workouts, so asking for them for free is a little presumptuous."

But I can tell you that you can come up with a structure and work from there. For example, start with the same warmup every day. Should be between 700~1000. Then do a kick/pull/drill set. This lets you work on technique every day. Then do a main set. When thinking of a main set, do it by the day of the week: monday is long distance free, tuesday is IM, wednesday is short distance sprint free, etc. You should always close off with a 200~400 warmdown.

You can feel like you are kicking narrow or you swing your arm at a high frequency and then you see a video of you and it looks like you stand still. So you SHOULD try to get someone to film you in order to get sufficient help from this board.  As to the first part of the question there could be a million reasons why you do not move after the arm pull. You could get out of balance, go in with the arms too early or too wide and thus negate the thrust, you could scissor your legs.... etc.  The dolphinkick you should feel in the abs mostly. Try doing it on the back starting the movement under the chest. When you wanna do it the other way around imagine your legs being a whip that is at its fastest at the end of the downward kick.

Swimming,3725ib,tigerk,2,Sun May 24 04:46:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed. There is very little correlation between running and swimming. In the pool, I am a sprinter. No question. On land, I am a distance runner, and I'm sure small children can out-sprint me."
Swimming,3725ib,SteelCityRunner,1 point,Sun May 24 14:48:59 2015 UTC,"I also agree.  Kicking is hard to get the hang of, and all it takes is some practice and commitment.  But exercising your legs outside of the pool definitely isn't bad for you!!"
Swimming,3725ib,mnswimmer,6,Sun May 24 16:58:09 2015 UTC,Are you actually whipping at each kick? A lot of times from what I've seen people without propulsion move their legs up and down steadily rather than with a little oomph at the end.
Swimming,3725ib,dHUMANb,3,Sun May 24 08:41:29 2015 UTC,Breathe as if you are sprinting.  Lots of air!
Swimming,3725ib,roostad,2,Sun May 24 05:39:05 2015 UTC,"also, make sure your kick stays within the streamline of your body."
Swimming,3725ib,roostad,3,Sun May 24 05:40:37 2015 UTC,"Try using fins if your pool can provide a pair for you. They should help you find the right technique by accentuating it (subtle differences in technique may result in a more noticeable change in propulsion).  Also, try streamline kicking on your back. For my final five years swimming (senior year HS and during college), I NEVER used a kickboard because it ruined my stamina. Also, streamline kick is much more realistic in terms of mimicking the motion of actual kick during freestyle/backstroke.  Hope that helps!"
Swimming,3725ib,murderhalfchub,1 point,Sun May 24 13:40:59 2015 UTC,"fellow runner here. Last time I entered a swimming pool I was in a pretty decent shape, running-wise. Got in the water, I could barely do 100mt without stopping. I remember that clearly after several years, it struck me.   Keep going, you will have to adapt a little before being efficient in water.  I always say that you can be a great athlete in any discipline or sport, but if you are not a swimmer when you get in water you suck (in relative terms).  Keep going. I myself am planning to get back at swimming soon, I would not be surprised to face the same problem again."

Swimming,3725ib,Eggmebabyonemoretime,1 point,Mon May 25 14:25:26 2015 UTC,running doesn't translate into kicking. im a terrible runner 1215 mile and a half. and There are some of my teammates that run 16 minute 3 miles and i can kick faster then them when they have their fins on. try some 6 and switch drills. kick six times on one side and switch. try keeping at least one eye in the water while doing this. like others have said try kicking on your back and do it in a streamline position to maintain good posture in the water.
Swimming,3725ib,mattinahat,1 point,Mon May 25 01:21:14 2015 UTC,"don't know bout ur kicking, but i tried 1 kick with 1 stroke method and it worked wonders for me. Alternative to continuous kicking, I just kick in sync with my hand strokes.   And most importantly what about your breathing patterns??  More u breath, less fatigue you have..."
Swimming,3703aj,D_Icedcoffee,5,Sat May 23 16:45:25 2015 UTC,I would always pick someone in my heat who goes a similar or faster time and try and keep his pace until I found my groove. or you could just have your coach raise his hands or something if you are on pace.  Just stay long and strong and you will be fine.
Swimming,3703aj,allmightygriff,2,Sat May 23 20:48:40 2015 UTC,Yeah my advice would be to just pick someone with a similar time to your goal and just draft them until about 1000m and then try to feel out where you're at.
Swimming,3703aj,TheThunderbird,2,Sat May 23 21:20:46 2015 UTC,"What my coach did was have a big red piece of construction/board paper and a green one. When someone was pacing too fast he would hold up the red (slow down) green meant go faster and if you didn't see anything then you were OK.  However it would be better to have, say a yellow paper. Just to let you know that you are on pace, better than seeing nothing."
Swimming,3703aj,IMSamZ,1 point,Sat May 23 20:35:26 2015 UTC,"Give your counter a stopwatch an.d have them keep your pace for you? If you are ahead of pace they can move the counter up and down. If you are behind pace move side to side and if you are on pace keep it still? I normally don't start moving the counter until after the 1st 300 hundred as I usually wait till the swimmer settles into a rhythm.  Edit: for those who downvoted because you think its illegal.

Swimming,3703aj,fiddlestix42,1 point,Sat May 23 23:09:02 2015 UTC,"What you are allowed to do, though, is have a coach or another swimmer working a stopwatch on the side and signaling to the counter."

Swimming,3703aj,ikeandmike,2,Sat May 23 20:28:02 2015 UTC,"Swimming section of the FINA rulebook, section 10 rule 16.  Ever wondered why the pace clocks are turned off around the competition pool at meets?  This rule."
Swimming,3703aj,TheThunderbird,6,Sat May 23 20:38:18 2015 UTC,I've never seen that happen. I've also seen the counters moved and coaches signal at almost all levels.
Swimming,3703aj,allmightygriff,2,Sat May 23 20:53:47 2015 UTC,"Exactly. That rule is in place and the clocks are turned off so that the swimmers dont know their exact time. There's no reason you can't shake their cards to say ""Hey, you need to go faster"" or ""Hey, you're going fast enough""."
Swimming,3703aj,ikeandmike,1 point,Sat May 23 21:21:18 2015 UTC,The coaches signaling to pick it up is generally accepted.  I've never seen an athlete coordinating with a turn judge at a big competition though and I imagine you'd get in serious trouble for that if you tried.
Swimming,3703aj,TheThunderbird,2,Sat May 23 21:19:40 2015 UTC,I don't think we are talking about coordinating with judges. That would obviously be illegal. Just looking up at the official clock.
Swimming,3703aj,allmightygriff,1 point,Sat May 23 21:35:37 2015 UTC,"Sorry, you're right. The athlete can look up at the official clock.  I thought when you said ""the counters moved"" you were talking about the lap counting flip boards being moved.  Obviously it would be illegal to have the turn judge pace you by looking at the clock and repositioning your flip board accordingly."
Swimming,3703aj,TheThunderbird,2,Sat May 23 21:41:07 2015 UTC,Really? I have never encountered anything like this. Just because you know the rules I'll ask you another question. Does that same rule apply to signals the counter gives if the counter is capable of seeing the lap times on the electronic scoreboard?
Swimming,3703aj,gbuck555,2,Sat May 23 21:05:25 2015 UTC,"The counter is not supposed to help or be biased towards the swimmer in any way and given that the counting is done by the turn judge, it would be a big conflict if the official was coordinating with the swimmer.  Now, obviously at bush league meets where you have to supply your own counter and there aren't 8 turn judges, this is not realistic.  But if someone was found doing this in a national final it would surely result in a disqualification."
Swimming,3703aj,TheThunderbird,2,Sat May 23 21:16:35 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call it bush league. More like age group meets. But yes you are right having a coach signal to the swimmer supplied counter is fine.

Swimming,3703aj,TheThunderbird,2,Sat May 23 23:32:36 2015 UTC,Where are you swimming just out of curiosity? Idk where FINA rules apply. I asked a coaching friend and he said international swim meets use FINA so you are definitely right there.

Swimming,3703aj,fiddlestix42,1 point,Sat May 23 23:53:28 2015 UTC,"I swam in Canada but I've been to a lot of international meets, mostly in the U.S. Most NGB's (e.g. Swimming Canada, USA Swimming) use FINA rules with their own rules tacked on top of them. Usually these are just additional organizational rules that add more regulation.  You don't usually see them conflict like this."

Just pick a lane, relax and swim what makes you the most comfortable. As long as you keep swimming you'll get better and will be able to tackle strokes and stroke form!"

Swimming,371boc,ttarragon_man,3,Sun May 24 20:58:35 2015 UTC,"I just started swimming and like you I was SO nervous to do it the first time. Was afraid of making a fool of myself, getting in people's way, etc.   Thankfully it has been no problem at all.  If you don't have to share a lane it is seriously no big deal. Any other swimmers are face down in the water 99% of the time. If any of them have noticed me flailing and flopping slowly up and down the pool, I'm blissfully unaware of it.   Sharing lanes would be the only time I think you might have an issue. I'm lucky that I have a huge pool that always has multiple empty lanes.   I don't think you will want to deal with lane sharing until you've had at least a few sessions to get used to the water. So figure out when your pool is lightly attended.   If you get there the first day and find lanes packed with people lane sharing, consider just skipping it.  I don't think you want your first experience to have the added stress of lane sharing. Talk to the lifeguard or attendant and find out when a better time to come might be, or consider searching out a less crowded pool. (If you haven't already committed, just go over there for a pre-inspection to check out the crowds).  Also, the life guards I have talked to at my pool have always been very nice. I have asked a number of questions like ""I'm new at this and have no idea what I'm doing, could you tell me what lane I should be in?""  Feel free to ask questions about whatever concerns you have."
Swimming,371boc,tidderor,2,Sun May 24 23:27:26 2015 UTC,"Further to other comments, I would suggest that you look to get in the pool when its quiet. My pool is crazy busy between 7am to 9am, 12 til 1 and 5pm to 7pm. You'll still be fine if you go at these times, but if you want a quiet lane to try new stuff in, go an hour before close or middle of the afternoon."

Swimming,371boc,yacob_uk,2,Sun May 24 02:48:18 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a great plan. Let us know how you get on. As a total novice myself, I really enjoy the pool more when there are less people about as I can relax more and focus on what I'm trying to do."

Swimming,36wbh0,Brain_in_a_rock,1 point,Fri May 22 20:55:16 2015 UTC,"I've been a competitive swimmer for around 49 years. I always get nervous before I compete. It is hard. Paraphrasing Tony Blair: just because something is hard doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.  I know when I get nervous, the adrenaline in my system will give me extra energy to swim well. So, all I need to do is focus on technique. Before I swim, I plan how I'm going to do everything in the race. I think about how I'm going to approach the blocks when my heat is up. I think about how I'm going to breath when the starter says, ""Take your marks"". I think about how I start and breath and turn and just about everything in the race. This helps me focus on technique during the race and not on the competition. After all, all I really want to do is the very best that I can. That is the main reason I compete. To find out how well I can do. To learn what I'm capable of.  How everyone else does is their issue. You don't know why they are competing. Maybe they are perfectly happy loosing to you. Maybe they are competing because their parents make them and they are glad to loose because they really don't want to compete. Maybe they loose, but are very happy because they did a good time. You don't know why they compete and you can't be responsible for their feelings. Remember, all you can do is your best and no one can expect more. No one ever swims a perfect race, so don't expect perfection in any aspect. But it is fun to see how close you can get to perfection. Competing also gives me incentive to go to workouts. If I didn't compete, I wouldn't work out as regularly as I do. And full disclosure: I always look at the competition. It isn't all about technique and striving for perfection. It is just that focusing on technique helps me manage the nerves and helps me swim well. TL;DR: Use your nervousness to help you do better. The other swimmers are responsible for their own races."

There is little organization here as I'm just streaming stuff down.  Good luck this year...and good luck with the parents!   Don't make things complex.  Small kids can really only focus on one or two things at a time. Related to that is: resist the urge to correct every little error you see the kids doing.  If you're focusing on streamlines on a particular set/drill, only correct things directly related to streamlines.  Throwing too much at them at once will make them forget everything.  Make a note of it, sure, as it can help you decide what you'll work on in the future, but sometimes you have to let things go to make sure they get today's lesson. Fundamentals are key at that age.  Yeah, everyone loves going fast, but you'll probably find that the majority of little ones churn far more than they swim when they try and go fast.  Giving them the basics will help them better in both the short and long run. Catch phrases often help.  For instance, if I had a kid or kids that were chopping their strokes super short and entering by their face/head, I'd talk about not having Tyrannosaurus arms.  All kids know about dinosaurs and it's a convenient shorthand (HAHA SO PUNNY) to get them to remember to extend their arms.  Plus it gives an opportunity to do funny arm motions which always gets their attention. You will never win the attention battle.  Kids gonna kid.  They will lose focus.  They key is to try and herd those cats while you have it and stretch it as long as you can.  If you've lost them and they have drifted off, usually it's the best time to completely change gears, as you'll often be able to refocus them for a little bit if they are shifting to something completely different. You're there to be their coach, not their friend.  That doesn't mean always be gruff, or that you can't joke and kid around, but remember your job is to help them swim better and enjoy the sport. If you've gotten to a point where you have the be Angry Coach (and there are definitely valid times for that), never make a threat you can't/won't keep.  Like, don't threaten that you'll keep them there until you finish the set no matter how long it takes.  The kids are smart enough to know that you can't actually do that, and will probably call your bluff.  The more your threats don't come true, the less they will believe them when you make them. Don't be afraid to be loud with the little kids.  I don't mean yell at them, just don't be afraid to yell so they can hear you.  Saying ""Jimmy and Sally, I need you to look at me"" can often work when you call them out.  You're not necessarily punishing them, but they hear their name in a less-than-positive light and it can often get them to at least stop being a distraction to others. Speaking of distractions, parents will probably be the worst ones.  If you can, limit their access to the poolside during practice.  Don't let them talk to the kids for any reason while you're teaching them, even if they are trying to tell their kid to listen to you.  It may get them to pay attention now, but it only undermines your authority with the kids. Consistency in practice can help a lot with focus, too.  I used to start every single practice with the exact same thing: a 10 min swim for warm up.  If you're late, don't tell me why, just get in the pool.  We'll talk about it after.  If 10 mins is too much, you could do something more structured, like a 200FR+200K+200CH, but leave it the same every day.  With the young ones, it provides a great switch to put them in practice mode.  It also helps eliminate all the dawdling that kids love to do at the beginning to delay getting in the water. (""Wait, what are we doing again?"" becomes irrelevant when it's always the same).  This can help them have better focus at the beginning."
Swimming,36s50s,Bubbay,8,Thu May 21 20:14:03 2015 UTC,"Oh, and one other thing -- I can't believe I forgot the best advice my head coach ever gave me.  One day, early in my coaching tenure, when I was disappointed and frustrated in my performance as a coach that day I went to talk to him.  I talked about how the day just felt ""off"".  It's not that the kids weren't behaving or that there was anything specific that was making practice fail; I just felt like I never got any of the sets to work and that when things went wrong, I just couldn't right the ship and get practice running smoothly.  That's when he told me the best advice I ever got: ""The kids don't know that.""  It was simple, straight to the point.  Yeah, I knew things weren't at their best that day and I felt like I was failing the kids because I wasn't giving them the best practice they could have had, but the kids don't know that.  They still left happy and tired, chatting away blissfully with their teammates.  They think practice was a success.  Don't beat yourself up if every day isn't the best day ever.  It will happen; it always happens.  Instead, use it to try and help yourself grow as a coach.  Learn from it, figure out what went wrong, why it went wrong, and what you could have done differently to be better, but do not beat yourself up over one bad practice.  Related note: keep your practice notebooks around.  It can help with this kind of review/retrospective.  You're going to be tired.  You're going to be stressed.  But it's totally worth it.  Best of luck to you."

Swimming,36s50s,joeliuzzi,3,Fri May 22 01:49:12 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat! I swam through HS and currently swim with my local masters team. I was the assistant coach for my old high school this last season, and now I'm head coaching a middle school level club team. What I learned from coaching this winter was listening to the kids. Not always giving them their way, but at least nodding and understanding them. I throw out ""good job""s like candy and that seems to help. Positive reinforcement is a big factor. Never pass up a teaching moment."
Swimming,36s50s,broom_people,2,Fri May 22 14:46:35 2015 UTC,"I've been a summer league coach for 9 years, this is my 4th year as head coach for my current team.  /u/Bubbay gave some good pointers. Often trying to get the attention of 30+ 8&unders can be challenging.  Make use of your assistant coaches and split kids up into groups.  If kids aren't paying attention then I'll do ""1,2,3 eyes on me"" and they repeat back ""1,2 eyes on you."" School has trained them to do that.  If i'm trying to get a concept across I will ask them a question and make them repeat the answer (e.g. ""What position do you push off the wall in?"" ""streamline!"" ""What?!"" ""streamline!"" ""WHAT?!!!"" ""STREAMLINE!"" they love that for some reason).  As for coming up with practices, we mainly just do drills with the 8&unders and really break down the strokes. Typically we will focus on one stroke per day and progress through it for a practice, making sure they grasp the concept of each drill before moving on (e.g. for Fly: 25s chest press arms by side, 25s chest press arms in front catch position breathing every 6 presses, 25s 6 chest presses then underwater pull and underwater recovery focusing on pushing hands hard &fast behind them, 25s 6 presses one full stroke, 25s 4 presses onefull stroke, etc.).  It's also important to teach little swimmers how to race. I love doing kickboard races (pairing them up and having 2 go at a time to race to the end) and they love it too.  Hope that helps!"
Swimming,36s50s,meppsman,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:08:43 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat you are. This is my 2nd year coaching, and first year as a full assistant. Even though the season is just starting for my team, there is one thing i have learned that really helps motivate kids of all ages, and it is challenges. For instance, i will tell whatever group of kids i'm coaching that day that is they can all finish a 100 or so before i finish something like a set amount of push ups or a lap around the pool, it really motivates them to try for that set, and also seems to make them feel like you're not some big mean coach, and that you like to have fun. Another example from when i was coaching the five year old group was to just show them what to do while they WEREN'T swimming. Since i cant just tell them to do a set and watch them and critique later, i actually have to be IN the water helping with them, it cause a lot of distraction for the ones who are not swimming at the time. So i showed them how to properly line up on the wall and told them if they did it right after the next lap, i would give them a surprise. It worked absolutely perfectly. I know giving incentives does take away from practice time, but in the beginning of the season i believe that they are very valuable to keep the newer swimmers and not as dedicated swimmers focused. One last idea i may suggest is have a 'Fun Day"" every once and while. My team is a neighborhood summer league with a wide variety of swimmers. From first time swimmers, all the way to top competitive club swimmers, they all have one thing in common. They like to have fun. A great way to have them have a great week of practice is set aside a day (possibly a Fun Friday type day.) and just have them play games. My teams fun Friday has been what keeps some of the kids on the team and has been for years. These are just some things I'm picking up in my first couple years, hope it helps at least a little bit!"

Swimming,36s03d,TheGreatCthulhu,6,Thu May 21 18:40:13 2015 UTC,"Congratulations!  Any time that you hit your personal goal is a good time!  Now if you plan to lower it, I wouldn't think about what a general ""good"" time is because they will vary so much it'll be demoralizing to hear some of them.  Some people here swimming at the top of their teams could probably do a 1000m swim in just over ten minutes but who cares.  I would be about 15 minutes I think.  Instead, I would think about your splits and work on lowering them.  At 28 minutes, you're 100m splits are probably 2:48, maybe a little faster at the beginning, a little slower at the end.  What you want to do is is work on lowering that.  I would say if you are relatively new, you will drop time quickly by a mixture of better technique and better endurance in the coming months.  Those alone should help you drop a lot, so 2:00 minute splits will be an achievable goal, get you down to 20 minutes and make you feel great.  If you worked at it you could probably get there in about 3 - 6 months.    If you like that goal, don't just swim 1000m every time you go to the pool and leave, you won't really drop time that way.  Instead, build a swim or several swims that help you drop your 100m splits.  There are lots of different swims mentioned on this subreddit and swimming sites, usually either pyramids (50, 100, 150, 200, 150, 100, 50) or blocks (5x100s) with short rests (10-15 seconds) between intervals and 30 second breaks between sets.  Don't forget a nice easy warm up of at least 200m.  Good luck!"

Swimming,36qxii,jamalstevens,1 point,Thu May 21 12:31:11 2015 UTC,"I am an amateur enthusiast but I've tried a variety of swims and can say that it would be helpful to identify a specific goal and work towards that, when you get there, choose another goal.  You say you want to be stronger, faster, and healthier, which is a good start.  Strength and speed will help you on shorter swims, so you may decide on a specific goal for your 50m, 100m, or 200m.  For example, my current goal is under a minute for my freestyle 100m.  Once you know the goal, start looking on swimswam and just googling practices to get you to your goal.  For instance, I was doing a 3 pyramids of 25, 50, 75, 100 as my main swim and it got me down to 1:15 but then I plateaued, I looked around the internet and chatted with a friend and I went to one longer pyramid of 100, 200, 400, 400, 200, 100 to build my endurance.  Now that I've done that for a while and built up endurance and honed technique a little, I've dropped to 1:13 and I'm going to switch back to shorter, more intense sprints hoping to drop again. I'm also trying a set of just 50's on the 35s for as long as I can hold it so I can know exactly what a 35s split feels like to get me down do 1:10.  I've also noticed that kick sets are often used as a rest period but they don't have to be, you can activate a kick set by doing intervals (I do 100s) and switching between freestyle, dolphin and breaststroke kick.  Also, fins make this a killer workout for your thighs.  Throwing one or two days in a week where your main set is kicking will help with variety.  Plus when you start kicking past others in your pool who are swimming flat out, you feel kinda good...  Another thing I've noticed is that every since I started doing backstroke at least 400m every swim, my shoulders aren't so hunched so could throw in backstroke at the end of each swim.    Finally, I love my Garmin Swim so much that I bought another 3 days after losing my first one, it just felt weird not to have it and be able to look at my swims in minute detail after."

Swimming,36qxii,adchrom,3,Thu May 21 17:14:07 2015 UTC,"It basically records your swim, with a little bit of help from you.  In the pool it helps you remember how much you've swam and how fast your last interval was.  With the swim, you just look and know where you are in your set which is great cause I always lose count.  It also helps you see what your times are without needing to use the wall-clock so you can adjust when you start to slow down.  I'm trying to drop my 100m so I need to keep my 100m splits below 1:30 across my whole swim, i just look at the watch.  But after, you can use Garmin Connect to look at charts and tables (I know, exciting right... but it really really is!) about your swim.  I find this incredibly fascinating and a little satisfying.  There's more on connect, there's a social network and I joined a swim group so you can see what other people are swimming which has been helpful too."

However, 5 miles per hour over such a long distance is pretty much impossible. The world record holder for the 50 yard free, César Cielo, did it in 18.47 seconds. That's about 5.54 miles per hour.

If your hand enters the water not in line with your body, but slightly shifted, then your body will also go from right to left.  You can try hypoxic sets. Where you breath every 5/7/9th stroke. But I think you need to be comfortable with the water. The best way to do this is just easy swimming."

Swimming,36lyuq,Timo_12,1 point,Thu May 21 10:37:31 2015 UTC,"It is difficult to ensure your technique is correct especially without a coach. For backstroke it is important to kick correctly. Don't let your knees bent to much. Keep your body position high, hips and abs pushed to the surface.  These things are I think in a lot of youtube vids. I'm a fan of the techniques movies made by The race club. I'm not sue if they have vids about backstroke?  A crucial part of the backstroke is the position where your hand enters the water. The position is hard to 'feel' as a beginner and could be the reason your swinging from left to right in the water. Maybe you could ask someone at the pool to see if you hand enters the water inline with your shoulders? Otherwise swim with paddles, the extra drag when performing the stroke wrong indicates if you're doing it right or not."

Swimming,36jfn4,MicahBaby,4,Tue May 19 20:51:02 2015 UTC,"You are doing all the correct things. I would add stretching and deltoids lifting to your regimen.  Stretch as you did with your PT, which i imagine worked on cross body, above body and triceps stretching prior to getting into the water.  If they gave you impingement reducing stretches I would also complete those.   There is a whole series of light lifts you can do with  dumb bells and or coupled with stretch bands that will greatly assist in making your shoulder stronger and more resistant to damage. These include front arm lifts, side arm lifts, ""chicken wing"" lifts and cross arm pulls pull left and right across the body with either bands or cords.  I can PM you with more details if you wish.  Focus first and foremost on your form. Enter with your palm, pinky first, elbow above wrist, simple glide and stretch watch your recovery and keep arms parallel with body with small S curve -all the usual things.  The key is to take it slow and really concentrate this time round on getting good form with even and balanced arm strength to reduce chances of re-injury or new injury.  Practice other strokes and balance out your free with plenty of backstroke if your shoulder can take it- generally this is a good idea anyways to balance the muscles out to reduce shoulder impingement issues.  Spend some quality time on you kicking form and speed, get a pair of short fins like the zoomers or other. Have fun with your workouts and do a great deal of variety.   Have a great time and enjoy your workouts this time round."
Swimming,36jfn4,planet_x69,1 point,Tue May 19 21:38:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all your advice! Whenever you get a free moment, please PM me some of those workouts. I really appreciate it!"
Swimming,36jfn4,boobooaboo,2,Wed May 20 01:19:15 2015 UTC,"Start slow. I had the same surgery on my right shoulder a few years ago, and my left about 2 months ago. If you are 2 years post op you should be fine.   I don't know why you don't have full ROM, some people don't get it back I suppose. I have 98% ROM back, the only limiter is my external rotation, and let's face it...external rotation isn't particularly useful. I expect to have full ROM in my left as well with proper PT and the extra things I do at PT. If you're feeling stiffness in your shoulder post-swim, it's probably inflammation. My $.02  Feel free to message me, as this is now my second time getting back in the water after  a labrum/bicep tear."
Swimming,36jfn4,boobooaboo,1 point,Wed May 20 16:14:08 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, both arms? That sucks.  My doctor warned me I probably wouldn't get full ROM back. It actually took about 2 years to diagnose me and get surgery. I went to one doctor who first thought I broke my collarbone, then thought I had a tumor in my shoulder, and finally decided it was nerve damage... It was a huge mess, but I think that if I were diagnosed correctly from the beginning my ROM would have come back.  I'm probably at around 80% ROM though - which isn't terrible, but every once in a while I notice it. You're probably right about the inflammation. I'm going to try to add some stretches and weight training in between swimming to try to make the muscles stronger. Good luck with your recovery :)"
Swimming,36jfn4,owner_of_steam,1 point,Thu May 21 15:21:48 2015 UTC,"Oh nerve damage...I'm sorry. That's awful, no wonder ROM isn't full. Lots of little exercises to activate your stabilizer muscles. Good luck in your recovery too, it's a long row and I can't wait to swim again!"

Swimming,36jfn4,boobooaboo,3,Tue May 19 21:31:07 2015 UTC,"Any exercise if done improperly can result in injury, that said, in general 2k every other day if balanced between kicking, stroke drills and what not won't usually result in issues.  So watch videos on proper technique, buy a lesson or two or join a masters program if there is one available to have them help you learn good form and you might enjoy swimming more because of improved technique and safer stronger stroke styles."

Swimming,36jfn4,ttarragon_man,1 point,Tue May 19 21:43:38 2015 UTC,"Hi OP,   I dealt with this situation when I was in my junior year of high school. I tore my rotator cuff in my left shoulder in an unrelated (skiing) accident.   I started by staying out of the pool and going to physical therapy (like you). In order to get back in the pool, I started with what was essentially our pre-competition warm up workout for a few weeks, along with much more rigorous stretching.   This was about 2000 yards total in the pool once per day at a very relaxed pace (around 3 hours). Mainly, I focussed on form and never allowed myself to attempt a pre-injury pace. The actual distances were all 200 yards or less.   As for stretches, my doctor recommended a relaxed yoga regimen before and after swimming. What really helped me in particular was to focus on using elastic resistance under the guide of my free arm to slowly reacclimate my arm to its usual range of motion (without using that arms muscles)  Hope this helps. Good luck!"

I wish I had 3 hours to swim (never gonna happen when I work full time and I'm a full time grad student...) but I'm trying to do about 30-45 minutes at least 3 times a week for now. I hadn't thought of doing yoga before, but I think that would be really helpful to help stretch out my shoulder in-between sessions. Thanks! :)"

Swimming,36hwke,BLlNK,11,Tue May 19 14:43:37 2015 UTC,"Notably, breaststroke has the most difference between a competitive and recreational stroke. Among the competitive strokes it is the most energy intensive (even beyond butterfly) and I expect would be the best for an upper-body workout. However, many people end up doing a sort of breaststroke that takes little effort as they aren't concerned about proper positioning or speed, and I don't know how that would stack up against similarly relaxed freestyle.  So, probably breaststroke, unless it's sloppy."
Swimming,36hwke,VerilyAMonkey,1 point,Tue May 19 16:40:01 2015 UTC,"For example, in an hour I swim 90 laps (25 meters each) per hour, should I swim like 50/50 swapping between the 2 styles or what would you recommend?"
Swimming,36hwke,VerilyAMonkey,6,Tue May 19 17:37:55 2015 UTC,"I would do mostly freestyle with some breaststroke, but that's because high volumes of breaststroke carries the risk of knee injury."
Swimming,36hwke,The_Crass-Beagle_Act,2,Tue May 19 18:41:50 2015 UTC,"In line with the previous commenter's thought, I think you can make it any ratio you feel comfortable with, so long as you make sure that you always have enough energy to do breaststroke right and to do it rigorously. It's a great upperbody workout at really high levels of effort, but at a relaxed pace, a lot of the power moves to the legs and it doesn't exert a lot of effort. This may mean that you won't be able to assign a 50/50 ratio to maximize the utility of your workout (at least not right away). Personally, at the peak of my fitness, I could only get maybe a third or half of the distance out of breaststroke as I could out of freestyle when exerting maximum effort for as long as possible."
Swimming,36hwke,mnswimmer,6,Tue May 19 18:25:43 2015 UTC,"I would say breaststroke is the best for upperbody, but keep in mind a huge majority of recreational swimmers do not know correct technique which can seriously injure your knees later in life.  One thing that is really good, is using hand paddles, and a pull bouy (between your thighs).  Over long distances this pull/upper body focused workout can increase strength and speed.  Hope I Helped!!"

Swimming,36hwke,RiddleMeThis1213,1 point,Tue May 19 16:21:34 2015 UTC,I recommend doing a combination of different strokes for your work out. Each one will benefit you slightly differently.
Swimming,36h8la,HCSarise,6,Tue May 19 11:13:31 2015 UTC,"If all you ever do is swim and only swim and you're not looking for a watch for any other sports then I am a fan of the Garmin Swim. It's ability to detect and count all 4 strokes and provide detailed metrics hasn't really been successfully matched by anyone else yet (there are some kickstarter contenders though) . If you are into multisports then I would recommend the 920xt or one of Garmin's other multisport offerings, they all use the same programming and sensors as the Swim for the indoor pool metrics.  Check out http://www.dcrainmaker.com, he really provides the best, most detailed, and unbiased reviews out there currently."
Swimming,36h8la,W5LVN,1 point,Tue May 19 13:01:39 2015 UTC,I second this comment--both the rec for the Garmin Swim and for dcrainmaker's reviews. I've used the Swim for about a year and have very few complaints.
Swimming,36h8la,Konstantin_Levin,1 point,Tue May 19 18:57:38 2015 UTC,What few complaints do you have?  I'm looking at the garmin swim. DC had me sold on it but I want to hear some negatives
Swimming,36h8la,YeahItsLL,2,Thu Jul 2 17:24:03 2015 UTC,"Some people complain that it isn't totally accurate at counting laps. I've found that it is fine, but you have to be aware of what that hand is doing, especially as you approach the walls. The times that it missed a lap or two, I suspect it missed a turn where I wasn't as crisp.  Also, I used to have the habit of rolling onto my back to glide into the wall at the end of a set. If I do that, the watch may sense backstroke and it will count the whole set as ""mixed"" (instead of free or whatever else it was)."
Swimming,36h8la,Konstantin_Levin,2,Tue Jul 7 19:06:22 2015 UTC,Thanks for your input.
Swimming,36h8la,YeahItsLL,3,Wed Jul 8 02:18:15 2015 UTC,"I'd look on dcrainmaker.com at tri watches. I'm not familiar with swim only watches with all of those functions. I have a Garmin swim that does all that you listed but does not have heart rate monitoring or gps tracking (for open water swims). I'd have to check on alerts, I don't use them if it has them.   The problem with heart rate in the pool is that the water makes it difficult to transmit data. Effectively your range is diminished to a foot or less.   The suunto ambit3 is the first watch to support heart rate while swimming in the sense that it records your heart rate and stores the information in the monitor until the end of the lap where it is closer to the watch and can ""catch up"". In this sense your heart rate isn't real time but it can be viewed on a RI or post swim. I do not know if the ambit3 has any efficiency stats though so you'd want to look into that before buying.   Another solution would be a watch like the Garmin forerunner 920xt. This doesn't support heart rate while swimming with a chest strap but dcrainmaker has reported people being successful using a mio link optical heart rate monitor directly next to the 920xt (or any tri watch) to transmit heart rate. Again, you'd want to look into this more to see if it's a possible solution for you.   Personally, I use the Garmin swim. It's the cheapest solution I could find when I was looking for a swim watch last year that could track time, laps, drills, swim pace and efficiency. Hope that helps!"
Swimming,36h8la,redeux,3,Tue May 19 12:56:57 2015 UTC,"One other option for heart rate while swimming would be the Wahoo Tickr X heart rate strap, it's a Bluetooth/ant+ combo strap that supports cycling and running metrics as well as records and stores heart rate data for later upload. The biggest problem with it is that you're stuck using Wahoo's system for data upload and review. It's also nearly impossible to swim efficiently and keep a chest based heart rate strap on unless you are wearing a skinsuit or wetsuit."
Swimming,36h8la,W5LVN,1 point,Tue May 19 13:07:13 2015 UTC,I have a Garmin 910XT. Since the 920XT is out the 910 is a lot cheaper. Stay away from the swim-ovate-pool pro The battery is not rechargeable. It costs $30 to have the battery changed out. I swim a lot and this did not take long. The Garmin 910/920 are good for open water as well.
Swimming,36h8la,hockeystimpy99,1 point,Tue May 19 19:20:40 2015 UTC,"I use the 910xt and my Garmin VivoActive. Both do fine jobs of recording strokes, SWOLF scores, etc.  The VivoActive is a little better than the 910xt for pool swims, mainly because it can handle shorter lanes like those found at hotels. The 910xt has gotten incredibly cheap, and the only areas where the 920xt really beats it are in color display (meh), live tracking and bluetooth uploads to a smartphone (neat, I like this on my VivoActive), and activity tracking (no activity tracking on 910xt, like, at all).  The VivoActive is a really great all-around watch if you're looking for something newer than the 910xt. The fatal flaws are lack of an open-water swim mode (tried it; it lacks the compensation to handle GPS inaccuracy when underwater like the 910xt and 920xt have), and 6-7 hour battery life with GPS.  But the VivoActive is the smallest, lightest GPS watch you can buy right now, and it's my ""90% watch"": I use it for 90% of my activities, only swapping to my 910xt when I plan to be outdoors using GPS for more than 6-7 hours or open-water swim."
Swimming,36hjz3,YeahItsLL,5,Tue May 19 13:06:29 2015 UTC,You could always text someone back home or make a facebook post or something so someone knows where you are and when you expect to return.  It's probably a good idea to get an ISHOF safer swimmer buoy too so you can be more visible while swimming in an unfamiliar place.
Swimming,36hjz3,LinnyWL,3,Tue May 19 14:22:28 2015 UTC,"I'm currently testing three different variations of the ChillSwim equivalent to the IMSHOF buoy. All are good, but I'm always concerned from experience that making myself more visible from a distance increases the propensity of others to panic because I can be seen a longer way off and further out than what most people think is safe.  I feel happier when I am completely invisible to others.   That said, I do recommend OP increases visibility and their options when planning swims."

Swimming,36fflh,koolaidman47,2,Mon May 18 23:38:15 2015 UTC,"Imagine how you pedal a bicycle. Now imagine you are standing, with some shrink wrap from a package stuck to your foot. You want to kick it off, because reaching down there is a hassle.  So you balance on one leg and shake the other one in a whipping motion, back and forth until the plastic flies off. This is much closer to how a freestyle kick is. You're essentially kicking the water away from you. Imagine trying to do a bicycle pedal to get that plastic off - that would be ridiculous, it would be the same motion as climbing stairs. This is why bicycle kicking in the water doesn't work - you're not pushing against the water with your feet, you're moving it out of the way by whipping your legs. That's the general mentality anyway.  Edit: as for breathing, it's not so much about bubbles as it is about pressure. Take both of your thumb pads and block a nostril with each. Now blow through your nose like a normal exhale. You should feel some mild pressure against your thumbs. How long can you maintain this while holding your breath? Water is always putting pressure on you, and it looks for any location of low pressure. This is why if you let up for even a moment, water will rush up your nose. It's not about an excess of pressure.  To think about it another way, fill a sink with water. Now take a plastic cup and flip it over, so that when submerged there is a pocket of air. Now imagine that there is a hole in the top - the water goes straight through right? But if you put your mouth over this hole, you can control the air pocket. This is exactly what you're doing with your nose. If you give in, the water wins. The trick is to use the minimum amount of pressure to maintain that air pocket. I would suggest slowly submerging yourself in the pool and discovering how hard you have to blow to maintain that pocket. If you're upside down you have to displace air thanks to physics (as there's no air pocket), but if you're right side up you don't need to make many bubbles at all to stop the water from coming in."

Swimming,36fflh,icithis,1 point,Wed May 20 23:11:22 2015 UTC,"The good: feeling more comfortable with my face in the water. My instructor took me into the deep end (14ft), and I let go of everything and didn't sink and could doggy paddle back to the wall.  He (my instructor) told me that I was doing a better job of keeping my legs straight.  The bad: When I need to take a breath (on my stomach) i have to either lose balance of floating or turn to the side where I lose straight line direction. Otherwise water gets into both my nose and mouth.  My instructor also told me that I should stretch my ankles more. Not sure if this fixable overnight or even over a few days.   Hopefully, that wasn't information overload. I am going to see if I can get someone to video tape me."
Swimming,36fflh,cburtltop,1 point,Wed May 20 23:22:04 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're making some good progress!  Balance is a bit strange in water. If you have your arms in front of you in a superman pose with your body and your face down, you'll actually float better than if your head is straight up looking over the horizon. This is due to your hip placement relative to your head placement. If you're 'losing balance' it's likely when your head is up, even if that seems counter-intuitive.  I'd suggest grabbing a kickboard for stomach breathing practice. Your legs should stay buoyant by kicking, and your upper body will stay up thanks to holding on to the kickboard. There are two ways to raise your head out of the water for strokes - straight up (like with breaststroke and butterfly) and on the side (freestyle). Straight up is easier, so start with that.  Using the kickboard and your breaststroke kick, place your face into the water while exhaling through your nose and keeping your mouth closed. Continue to exhale through your nose, and when you feel like you may run out of air at some point, bring your face straight up out of the water. Do this until you are comfortable with the sensation of entering your head into the water and removing it without losing your proprioception and not stopping your kicking.  Also watch this video - apologies for the promotions, but the information is good. These drills and concentrating on what he said would be a good start.  As far as stretching your ankles, it's pretty straightforward. You just want to go through the full range of motion. Here's another video. You want your feet to be able to point as you would imagine a ballet dancer, which will increase the surface area you're kicking against.  Good luck!"

Swimming,36dxe4,jamalstevens,7,Mon May 18 16:56:48 2015 UTC,If you're lap swimming you will need to get a swim suit wich has a minimal amount of resistance.

Swimming,36dxe4,MetroSeksualHipster,2,Mon May 18 20:12:16 2015 UTC,"I'm putting my vote for the Jammer, feels comfortable with more room than a traditional speedo, also keeps your POWERFUL thighs from thundering into each other during sprint kick"
Swimming,36dxe4,blondzie,1 point,Mon May 18 22:06:28 2015 UTC,"I wore the square leg in high school as my practice suit, and a speedo for races. Now I'm most comfortable doing laps in the square leg, and will just wear what are basically running shorts with a draw string over it if I want the increased resistance."
Swimming,36dxe4,N34TXS-BM,1 point,Tue May 19 01:21:59 2015 UTC,I did a speedo and running shorts over it and that was perfect. Probably pick up a standard drag suit if the tyr thing starts to fade and whatnot. From what I read that tyr suit is basically the same as what you are doing with the running shorts. I like the resistance as it adds to my workout. Never practiced without drag before really so I figure why start now.
Swimming,36dxe4,k1p1k1p1,1 point,Tue May 19 09:02:21 2015 UTC,Why do I need minimal resistance? Wouldn't resistance be a good thing for practice? I did 2000ish yards last time I went and will probably do the same thing next time.  I always had a drag suit of some kind on when swimming in high school and then took them off for racing.
Swimming,36dxe4,bratislava,3,Tue May 19 09:04:34 2015 UTC,I wouldn't bother with that. Those suits are very low-quality and fade/fall apart easily. You'd be better suited to a pair of jammers or squares for getting back into swimming.

Swimming,36d39p,Christmess,5,Mon May 18 12:41:59 2015 UTC,"24 sec for 25m breaststroke isn't bad for someone who's just started out swimming. It's by no means fast but what can you expect?   I would recommend trying to learn butterfly by yourself first. Look up the technique online and if there are many others that swim where you swim, you can ask them for quick pointers. Just don't be too intruding. However, I would also recommend learning the other two steps before butterfly.   Swimming burns a lot of calories and you gotta refuel. There's a reason why is become a common joke between swimwear about how much they have to eat."
Swimming,36d39p,cyberchief,5,Mon May 18 13:06:18 2015 UTC,"Coach here: Awesome that you are getting into swimming welcome to the life it's a little bit addictive. Ok as for the breast time not bad for your level be proud. As for fly I would say right now backstroke and freestyle are your next step. Fly isn't the easiest and it helps to be stretched out by long free or a good straight backstroke. Watch a few videos online so you can get your forward crawl down (basic name for BASIC freestyle). I would say go to USA Swimming and they can send you to some great aids (I send my swimmers there when a different coach gives them contradictory advice, I like my swimmers to decide for themselves). I suggest these because by the sound of it you are a born breaststroker (there is always one); the thing about a born breaststroker is they always want to whip kick (breaststroke kick) even in a different stroke and that is a bad habit to get into if you are looking for overall growth. So you need to focus on basic technique and constantly remind yourself that to do it with no pain and all gain you need to be focused on doing it right. Finally as for the instructor thing I would say look around to see who is giving private lessons. I personally work with people all the time weather they are older and just want to learn to swim or they are a Master (adult level league, [you should definitely look into a Masters group they will treat you kindly and be a very good influence and mentors]) swimmer and trying To cut a little time. In conclusion I have to repeat Welcome to Swimming and we are glad to have another! Focus on technique so that you can be a more efficient swimmer. P.S. I forgot fly cause I obviously didn't think that it might not be your next logical progressional step, I now regret that assumption (though stand by the thought process). If you are into fly that much watch a few videos (and referenced before) then try to go slow. Focus on four strokes of a 25 then finish in free so that you do t push too hard. Fly is hard on the body until you have great technique so don't focus on doing it the entire pool. Good luck on it and if you need anymore help I'll be around just PM me."

Swimming,36b9kp,soundkite,12,Sun May 17 23:47:09 2015 UTC,"Hello soundkite!!  So some of the so-called ""science"" for why jammers work so well, is because it is partially skin-tight, and will not be catching any water in other places, therefore drastically decreasing the drag as supposed to board shorts.    One thing that I think could be happening is that your current swim suit situation is adding a lot of extra weight and dragging your legs down, which will make your body in a more of a sloped angle.  without as much leg support you don't get the fluid motion of snapping the legs that would somewhat guide the body into a more efficient streamline position.  This lack of streamline position puts a TON of pressure that pulls you down and makes it extremely difficult to propel your body at all.  tl;dr: There is no doubt that you will see giant improvement in your butterfly speed and technique if you switch to a jammer or speedo.    Hope that was helpful!!"
Swimming,36b9kp,mnswimmer,5,Mon May 18 00:46:10 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't use boardshorts for working out with swimming simply because they will add a lot of strain to your shoulders. My setup is a pair of jammers and then a drag suit so I don't feel so exposed ...   Regarding the butterfly, remember, the goal isn't to get your chest out of the water, your head just comes up out of the water for a breath.   Check out this video of Michael Phelps: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IucYlH_gAic"
Swimming,36b9kp,kizdog,5,Mon May 18 02:33:41 2015 UTC,"If you're trying to take swimming seriously, you need to get rid of boardshorts completely."
Swimming,36b9kp,renewedhope,3,Mon May 18 11:58:35 2015 UTC,Board shorts will kill your technique and definitely make butterfly very difficult. I swam fly in college and even for me it becomes very difficult when wearing anything but a Speedo or jammer.
Swimming,36b9kp,ColdPorridge,2,Mon May 18 03:21:28 2015 UTC,Cut the weight from the drag of your suit. As for your breathing make sure you are breathing as close to the water as well as when your hands are at your waist to reduce drag.
Swimming,36b9kp,lime_and_coconut,2,Mon May 18 02:19:22 2015 UTC,"In every stroke, you will notice the difference wearing jammers."
Swimming,36b9kp,magnue,3,Mon May 18 10:26:29 2015 UTC,"It would be nice to get jammers, but if your main problem is your breathing, than it is your technique, not what you're wearing."

Swimming,36b9kp,ifallalot,4,Mon May 18 08:07:25 2015 UTC,"I imagine because being in board shorts drastically increases resistance thus making it much harder to stay in a good position and much harder too breathe.  These things arent independant of each other. I am a solid butterflier, but if I had to swim it with board shorts my technique would fall to bits."
Swimming,36b9kp,jared0h,1 point,Mon May 18 08:43:41 2015 UTC,"OP here.  My main issue is my loss of strength and speed and technique towards the end of my lap (I can only swim one lap BF without pausing).  As I tire, I lift my head up and forward to breathe, but this curves my spine and stalls my momentum.  If breathing is ALL about technique, should I be able to breathe regardless of drag?  Do butterflyers ever turn their head to the side to breathe like in freestyle?"
Swimming,36b9kp,Eggmebabyonemoretime,1 point,Mon May 18 15:16:53 2015 UTC,"more    Yes turning head to breathe like that actually is good tech, but all in all it should not make that much of a different. Swimming in general will be a more positive experience if you get jammers."

With me it's usually oatmeal and peanut butter and a huge cup of coffee right after my swim. Two hours later, four hard boiled eggs. Next two meals are chicken, brown rice, and broccoli. Dinner is something like chili with cheese over a baked potato, or salmon or steak with a sweet potato, spinach or kale.  If I absolutely need something in between meals, I'll munch on some carrots or a banana or apple.  Eat healthy, eat often, and drink plenty of water.

It seems you're pausing to make sure you get yourself in the right position to finish your stroke, but if you time it like this your finish should put you there automatically."
Swimming,36b545,elcalrissian,1 point,Mon May 18 02:10:19 2015 UTC,"best timing is to put the downbeat of your kick when you start your pull   Ohhh ok, I always think the opposite. I'll take note of that"
Swimming,36b545,mnswimmer,2,Mon May 18 02:36:55 2015 UTC,"To be honest, it's hard to tell issues with confidence with such a small amount of time to look at your stroke. You should find someone or somewhere you can film for a whole lap. My suggestions could be due to the fact that you're holding back potential extension or speed because you're trying to get more strokes in the short recording.  You're still dragging your hips in both fly and free, you need to get them up higher, especially when you are going and into your extension. It looks like you're struggling to keep them even where they are now. More extension should help with that, as well as keeping your head/chin down into your extension. You need to extend a little more on your free, your right hand specifically, and smaller faster kicks, feet close together. You should focus on your fly kick, looks like it needs a bit more follow-through/power.  Not a bad stroke, just looks like you're struggling to keep your hips high in the water. Again, I suggest you get a whole lap fined so we can see you have time to get comfortable in your stroke."

You see freestyle has a way of pulling your shoulders in, it is called the swimmer slouch (you can pick a swimmer from 3M away just put how there shoulders point in. Backstroke forces you to push your shoulders back (no other stroke does this well) and helps fight that inward shoulder look. So those of us who have had bad shoulder problems we find that backstroke operates as a rehab of sorts. As a swimmer: sounds like the local fucks can't circle swim you need to fix that shit."

Swimming,36d0lw,Dranzogger,6,Tue May 19 00:48:55 2015 UTC,Backstroke i actually very arm heavy when done correctly. Not only does it do that but it also trains your legs the same amount as freestyle. It also trains your abs very hard since you need to have them flexed so you don't sink.  I used to swim backstroke at a high competitive level before i switched to crawl.

HIIT and other sprint drills than investing in a hardware solution.   Work to control your breath and breathing out slowly during each stroke. Get a training partner, at any age, swimming another will force you to really push yourself. Use the pace clock as well to really push yourself and to limit rest time between drills.   While you might see some limited gain with a restricted breathing apparatus, it will be short lived and the science is still out on effectiveness long term unless worn quite a bit.  Good luck."

Swimming,3692ks,BigBohrs,4,Sun May 17 10:37:41 2015 UTC,My swimming coach has always said it was better to slowly breath out and personally i find it easier as well. It keeps you just that little bit more relaxed and make it so when you take a breath you spend the whole time inhaling. I guess the best way to find out though is to try it out for a couple of weeks and see how it feels.

I have been in competitive swimming for about a year now, and my best event's are the 50 and 100 freestyle (LCM or SCY).  for LCM, it can be hard to hold you're breath for an entire 50, so one thing I always do, whether it be Short Course or Long Course, is plan where I am going to breathe in the pool.  For Long Course you still want to keep the amount of breath's relatively low (for me it is 1, maybe 2, but it depends, a U of M recruit on our team always never breathe's on 50's and goes a 23.49).    While I'm swimming the 50 I hold my breath until about 10 Meters before my 1st breath, and once I reach the start of the 10 Meters, I begin to exhale slowly.  This makes my lungs mostly clear of all air, so I don't have to breathe any out as I go to take my breath.    tl;dr: Hold your breath up until about 10 meters before you want to breath, and then slowly exhale.

For (LCM) the consensus in coaching is to limit your breaths to 1 or zero in the middle of the pool, for for 50 SYC, take a breath right after the turn.  The reasoning is obvious, you are only swimming for 25 seconds or less and for every stroke you take with a breath you eat .15 to .35 seconds of time waiting on yourself to breath and bringing your arm higher than your opposing arm.  For the 100 (LCM)  the idea is to breath 2x on the first 50 with the intent to take 1 on the last 50 and try to limit your breath count to 4 or less times in a complete 100 LCM. In SCY 100, the strategy is 1 per 25 after every turn or 3 or again limit to 4 or fewer for the event.  You are to always do slow continuous release of air regardless of stroke or event or distance so that when you do take a breath you are able to strongly inhale and inhale very quickly and completely."
Swimming,3692ks,planet_x69,1 point,Mon May 18 19:08:30 2015 UTC,"I prefer to quickly exhale as it helps to blow water out of my nose, so I don't end up inhaling it along with my next breath."
Swimming,368x6w,PeakOfTheBellCurve,3,Sun May 17 08:55:48 2015 UTC,"I have all sorts of back issues from having a connective tissue disorder, and I find that swimming regularly is the only way for me to live without pain. And this is from degenerative discs in my neck, to minor scoliosis (12 degree curve), to low back pain from my pregnancies and carrying my kids around, to my ribs partially dislocating by my spine. Swimming is the BEST thing for back pain.   That said, your form needs to be good. For freestyle, keep your spine very neutral, and your head down. When you breathe, rotate your whole torso so one eye is out of the water(hips included) and you can take a breath. If your lower back is hurting, you're arching it too much."
Swimming,368x6w,gertrudeblythe,2,Sun May 17 19:17:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know for sure, but my doctor always said; you can swim if you can swim. But don't train to hard, most of the time you can feel it by yourself what you can do and what not. Please learn first the basic technique of every stroke. You can learn them at your local swimming team, they can help you out. Goggles, some pools a swim cap, swim pants ;) and a sportdrink to not get dehydrated."
Swimming,368x6w,dogewow12,2,Sun May 17 09:05:45 2015 UTC,"1) Oh man, swimming is really good on the joints, but if you tried too hard then it's not that easy on the joints.  2) Lessons. Ask a coach or a local team or something.  3) Goggles are a must. You can get some suits if you want. To be honest in my opinion, anything other than goggles depends on you."
Swimming,368x6w,TimeKeeper2,2,Sun May 17 12:43:59 2015 UTC,"Just start with easy freestyle and backstroke.  Watch a few videos online, although a coach would be better. Start with 500 yards (break it down into 10x50s so you have rest) and add 100 yards every time you go. Most casual swimmers only do about 2-3000 yards per workout. Goggles (swedes are the cheapest), paddles and a kickboard would be a good start for mixing it up. Paddles give you a really good feel for the water. Good luck and give it at least a month, you'll be a completely different swimmer by then!"
Swimming,368x6w,roostad,2,Sun May 17 14:51:36 2015 UTC,"Coach here: 1) it's good on the joints as such (but that is assuming you have decent technique). So I would ask that you watch a few basic videos on Swimming Freestyle on YouTube. 2) a lot of coaches offer Masters (18+) groups as well as private lessons to just knock out the basics. I personally get these jobs often for people trying to get into scuba or for people just trying to get into the sport. 3) Goggles are a good call, probably should get a kickboard but your local pool should have at least that for you to use.

Swimming,368x6w,imadeaname,2,Mon May 18 01:36:58 2015 UTC,"Swimming is pretty easy on your back, but other joints depend on what kind of stuff you're doing. (Breaststroke is hard on the knees, and butterfly can be rough on your shoulders.) Just as long as you pay attention to your form, your back should be fine! Just about any pool will offer lessons on the basic techniques for all of the strokes, which is just about the most important thing you can learn. I don't know how old you are, but most pools offer lessons for all ages. Freestyle is pretty easy to pick up, so it'll just depend on how much you want to learn after that. Goggles are an absolute must. I use Swedish goggles for practice; they're comfortable, easy to adjust, and inexpensive! These are also pretty popular, if you don't like the Swedish ones. If you have a lot of hair, you might want a cap, too. Latex ones are cheaper, but silicone is usually more comfortable. It really just comes down to personal preference for that."
Swimming,368x6w,MercuryMadHatter,3,Sun May 17 22:33:24 2015 UTC,"Okay I'm going to try and answer this as best as I can. Swimming will certainly help with your back problems!! It's usually what they tell children with scoliosis to do to try and prevent it from getting worse (that's how I got into it). If you've recently had a back injury I strongly suggest a swim instructor shows you how to do the strokes. Swimming really helped my back problems though, still does.   Equipment? Well, googles are a staple in my opinion. You'll have to search to find the type you like. Other than that and a bathing suit, don't invest to much money until you know what you want out of swimming"

That breaststroke 100 time is OK, but im for sure not an expert on breast.  23.0-23.5 is pretty 'common' as a sprinter, therefore more competition if you want to swim at that next level.  If you could work on your pacing for the 200 fr, I bet you could quickly go below 1:50s.  Training wise, pacing is the best for mid distance training.  practice 8x100's build to each 4 on a 1:15-1:20 interval.  My 200 FR race was (by 50s, Sprint 1st 50, hold on 2nd 50, build back up on 3rd 50, balls out on last 50."
Swimming,364x1s,elcalrissian,2,Sat May 16 12:01:56 2015 UTC,"200 is still a sprint in my opinion, however, I don't think I could tell you what I thought you excel at before I got to watch you swim, got to know your stroke, and your personality.

Swimming,363rd3,superprokyle,4,Fri May 15 21:27:32 2015 UTC,"Your head is a little high, you want your spine to be more neutral. So your face needs to be looking more at the bottom of the pool."
Swimming,363rd3,gertrudeblythe,2,Fri May 15 21:58:20 2015 UTC,"Your spine is the axis, your shoulders must rotate around it on arcs that are drawn by perpendicular lines. Your hips are too low, head in the water and reach with the arms like you're laying on a car hood and trying to reach the edge. Head should be neutral along the axis that is your spine. Like most people, your left is worse than your right. Try some drills where you stroke with just your left."
Swimming,363rd3,gravitythrone,1 point,Sat May 16 00:29:29 2015 UTC,"I assume by the car hood analogy you mean facing the ground? Or are you referring to how my stroke currently looks?

Swimming,363rd3,gravitythrone,1 point,Sat May 16 01:54:08 2015 UTC,"Like you're laying stomach down on the hood of a car. Reach for the front of it.

Swimming,363rd3,gertrudeblythe,1 point,Sat May 16 19:46:09 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking as well--need to keep my spine neutral and head facing down. I think I'm lifting my head when breathing. Need more rotation on each stroke. I feel like I'm bringing my arms up from out of the water (near my waist) to the front of my head too quickly and it should be more fluid.  I've been trying not to drop my shoulders too much, but it's hard to tell whether I'm getting a good catch or not. I'm wondering if my tempo is too fast, and I should keep my arm extended longer before each stroke.  Lastly, how is my kick?"
Swimming,363rd3,jojojimmy,2,Fri May 15 22:06:37 2015 UTC,"You seem to be scissor kicking a bit, so that means your legs on the down kick are going out to the side too much.  Also you don't seem to have much glide after your hand enters, you can get a better grab on the water for your catch if your hand enters a bit sooner and you extend out more. Think of the water as a fluid ball that you're sculpting, and your hand grabs and pushes that ball to your hip."
Swimming,363rd3,jojojimmy,1 point,Fri May 15 22:45:38 2015 UTC,"I agree on both counts--I like that metaphor, that's a good swim thought to have while I swim. Am I perhaps not pulling hard enough, or do you think it is more that I am not generating enough surface area on the pull?"
Swimming,363rd3,Eggmebabyonemoretime,2,Fri May 15 23:18:44 2015 UTC,"You might try a few laps of brushing you hand against your thigh before you bring it out of the water, that will make sure you're following through on the stroke.  When I'm finishing the stroke, it sends a little packet of water rolling down my leg. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but the water I've moved with my hand keeps traveling. That's where the glide comes in.  Sculling drills might also help you get a feel for it."
Swimming,363rd3,jamincan,1 point,Fri May 15 22:52:43 2015 UTC,"Ah, I like this! I totally get what you mean, kind of like how a hose feels underwater, should be rushing past my leg after each pull.

Swimming,363rd3,Eggmebabyonemoretime,1 point,Fri May 15 23:23:13 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, a hose is a much better way to describe it. I'm not sure the best way to figure out if you've got enough power, but you could try counting your strokes for each lap.  And yes, that video shows the sculling stuff. It helps you figure out how to catch the water. You can also try vertical sculling (as in, get in the deep end and go vertical), and just using the sculling motion to keep your head out of the water.   Or, alternately, try vertical kicking and put your hands out of the water and try to stay afloat. This really helped me figure out how to kick. Remember, kick from the hips!  Best of luck dude, hope your triathlon goes well."
Swimming,363rd3,Rawbbeh,1 point,Fri May 15 23:33:11 2015 UTC,"I've counted strokes previously, and I was averaging about 25 strokes per 25 yds, which is definitely high. I recall from one video that elite swimmers can do 100 yds with that many strokes. I wasn't sure if I should attribute that to my pull or to other factors, but after watching the video I think my pull is definitely weak. I will definitely try the vertical kicking, that sounds like a good way to practice for sure. And also sculling, of course. Thanks for the help!"

My pool had hot tubs in the change rooms, and the one in the women's was so disgusting because it was always covered in an oil slick of a combination of all the disgusting products the women had on their skin."

Swimming,362get,yhwksa,6,Fri May 15 15:13:20 2015 UTC,"Receiving instruction of some sort is invaluable. A lot of pools have adult swimming lessons, or times when someone can offer feedback on your stroke. You might find it intimidating at first, but getting some type of coaching is the best thing you can do.  When you say that you can do a couple laps before having to stop, is that freestyle or breaststroke?  It's also definitely worthwhile getting goggles. Lot's of people swim just fine in regular trunks (though jammers are much nicer to swim with in my opinion), but goggles will make you far more comfortable in the water."
Swimming,362get,jamincan,1 point,Fri May 15 15:30:45 2015 UTC,"I can look into that at the local pool and see what they have. If not I'll see if someone better than me can give me some pointers.  As far as laps goes, that's breaststroke. I haven't really learned freestyle yet, it's more of just splashing in place.  I've looked into goggles and new trunks and found these goggles and these trunks."
Swimming,362get,Krepe,1 point,Fri May 15 16:21:36 2015 UTC,"If your not too self conscious about your body I recommend this type of swimsuit, or the shorter version to avoid tan lines. Not gonna lie you're gonna feel a little weird and exposed the first couple of times you swim in this but they are the best you can wear while swimming they're tight so you don't create any drag or feel heavy like baggy shorts."
Swimming,35zehm,LoneSwimmer,3,Thu May 14 20:12:51 2015 UTC,"I wish I read this 6 months ago. Great article. Thank you for posting this.   I do have two questions for.anyone willing.. A) if you're doing, let's say 2 min 100's or whatever time, what's the length of rest should you take? Is there a comfortable standard?  2) what's a master's minute?"
Swimming,35zehm,YeahItsLL,3,Thu May 14 20:30:59 2015 UTC,"Glad it's useful!  A) I usually say 10 to 15 secs. 20 if you are adapting to the speed which will allow you to push a little harder to make it. As you get used to it, you'll find you are taking 5 to 10.  2) It's a term for Master's swimmers (like myself) who may not be quite so... rigourous about sticking to short breaks between sets. E.g. an intended 60 sec break between two 10x100 sets can take 2,3,4,5...of chatting."
Swimming,35zehm,DannyDougherty,3,Thu May 14 20:57:04 2015 UTC,"I think that depends on a lot. If 2:00 is a pretty intense sprint pace for you, it might be fair to take a little longer recovery time (:10-:15). If it's an easier pace (say 75%) for you, you'll probably want to swim in as close to the interval, using the clock as a backstop to your pace.  By way of example: I'll frequently do 4x4x100 free on the 1:25 as main set. At the beginning of the set, I might finish with 5-7.5 seconds rest, but by the end I might have 1-3 seconds rest. If I ever find myself finishing the entire set with 5+ seconds rest, I might try how 1:20 feels next practice.  But at the end of my practice, I'll throw in some 50s on the :45 where I try to finish by the :30. These are pretty fast (for me) so I'm willing to give myself a quarter of the clock to recover between them."

Swimming,35zehm,andrwsc,2,Fri May 15 13:23:15 2015 UTC,"Question for other masters swimmers: do you prefer fixed rest intervals, or fixed total intervals?  For example, let's say I can swim a set of 50s, each one about 35 seconds plus or minus, as long as I get 10 seconds or so of rest.  Do you prefer a set where you have exactly 10 seconds of rest each time (e.g. touch the wall when the clock is at 17, leave on 27) or do you prefer a fixed interval (e.g. 0:45 interval, so if I swim one in 36s I only get 9s rest that interval.  If I swim 33s, I get 12s rest)?"

I wore it for the 200 IM as well, and it was great there too! It's easier to put on than the Carbon Pro or Flex, and it doesn't have as much of a ""compressed"" feeling in the thighs. (There's definitely still compression, but it doesn't feel as restrictive.) I've had problems with the AP12 and Tracer B-Series messing with my circulation after a while, but the Avictor hasn't given me any problems like that.

Swimming,360pa2,mikegymnastics,2,Fri May 15 02:45:16 2015 UTC,"There are so many variations on combat side stroke its just silly at this point. The SEAL version is a horribly ugly version and I find it terribly inefficient.   That said, you are to always slowly exhale as soon as your face goes underwater.  Same on turns, breath in just before the wall, turn and as soon as your feet have left the wall you can begin to slowly exhale till you rotate over and take your first stroke and next breath.  To stretch your lats and shoulders, relax while hanging in preparation for a pull up with arms slightly wider than shoulder width. Begin to move your hands closer together and hang again relaxing your back letting your lats carry your body weight. The final stretching position should have your hands touching as you hang, hold that position for 5-10 seconds. If you are able place your hands on top of each other with your biceps touching your ears and hold.  Stretch your triceps by raising your arm completely straight up then rotate your palm so that your thumb is now pointing away from your ear and bring your hand down to your should by bending at the elbow, gently push your elbow toward your back.  Raise your ARM till its shoulder height, swing it completely across your chest attempt to keep it as straight as possible and as close to your chest as you can, rotate your palm up and the down and then repeat with other arm.  Lifting both arms straight up above your head, bring your hands together with left palm over right hand and attempt to have your biceps touch your ears and hold, repeat with right over left.  Finally, that burning sensation will slowly go away as you become more efficient in the water and build up your aerobic base. It's very very common to experience that burn early on. It will decrease significantly the more you push yourself and the greater distances  and intensity you do. It will never go away, its the bodies way of telling you it needs oxygen.  Good luck and keep practicing."
Swimming,360pa2,planet_x69,1 point,Fri May 15 13:51:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks, very helpful post! So it is supposed to be a slow exhale until my lungs are empty...  Just wondering what's so bad about the SEAL version? My understand was that it was efficient with flippers and for distance, while keeping your profile low.. You have seen better versions?"
Swimming,360pa2,planet_x69,1 point,Fri May 15 16:24:35 2015 UTC,It's a fairly awkward version of the combat crawl stroke wise and any time your arm has to break water it can re-enter with a loud splash.  Breathing slow and steady out while your face is covered is a swimming basic. Practice doing that and you will find your breathing will normalize like it does when you are running
Swimming,360pa2,StTheo,1 point,Fri May 15 17:40:04 2015 UTC,"It's been a long time since I was in the swim team, but for breathing during the ""American crawl,"" I think I was taught to breath when your arm goes out of the water with each stroke. So, for me, every time I had my right arm out of the water I would turn my head right and take a breath.  As far as the turns, against a pool wall I think what I would do was, right before reaching the wall (which I had difficulty determining since you can't really look forward too often with the American crawl, you kind of have to predict how close you are to the wall), you do a front flip so you are facing the direction you came from and your front is facing upwards, then you push against the wall with your feet and flip around so you're facing down again. It's been a while, but I think those are the correct steps."
Swimming,360pa2,Thatguy440,1 point,Fri May 15 03:13:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I just edited my post to clarify, the turn is open water and the stroke is the combat side stroke. I know when to take a breath, i'm not sure when/hop to exhale."
Swimming,360pa2,tigerk,1 point,Fri May 15 03:17:11 2015 UTC,"My understanding would be that you breath out through your nose while your head is underwater, so that way when your head resurfaces for the next breathe your lungs are empty and you don't waste any time above water exhaling."
Swimming,360pa2,tigerk,1 point,Fri May 15 03:47:55 2015 UTC,"You're probably out of breath the last 25 not because you're breathing wrong, but you aren't in shape yet.

Swimming,360pa2,esmerelda05,1 point,Fri May 15 04:33:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, you want to exhale all air while your head is under water so as to not waste time on your breath. What works for me is to exhale two strokes before I take my next breath so if I l'm breathing every 5th stroke I'll exhale on 3 and 4 so I can get a full and complete breath on 5. Hope this helps!"

""What's your average retention for a recruiting class? in other words, what percentage of freshman typically are still swimming as seniors?"" Always ask to talk to seniors and 5 yr seniors about the program and about their academic challenges.  Your first goal is to find a SCHOOL that you like, not a coach. I say this as I have experienced too many kids bailing and school hopping to find the perfect ride....It's swimming, and unless you are truly in the top 3 swimmers in your stroke(s) there is little to no professional money to be made by you after you graduate so get into a great school and get your education.

Don't hold your breath! Make sure you breathe out slowly so the time to take your breathe is short and it also prevents too much pressure from building in your chest. Finish your strokes! Make sure you make the most of every stroke. Pull until your arm is about full extended to your quads. Technique is crucial. Make sure you are actually pushing water and not swinging your arms, don't go ham the first 50, but don't pace yourself.

You should definitely check out this article on Kayla Wheeler, a girl with only one limb who is a kickass swimmer: http://abcnews.go.com/US/teen-legs-arm-competes-paralympic-world-championships/story?id=19154021  There are definitely people for whom swimming will be more difficult. And yes, being very over- or underweight could contribute to swimming being more difficult (as it would for other sports). But if someone wants to swim and work and improve, they absolutely can.  And, of course, there are people who have a body built in such a way that they get a competitive edge in swimming (again, as with any sport). But that doesn't mean it's worthless for you to swim if that's not you, it just means you're not as likely to become an Olympic athlete..."
Swimming,35wcef,intangiblemango,1 point,Thu May 14 02:54:15 2015 UTC,what about floating? I read that there are many people who just can't float.
Swimming,35wcef,baddspellar,2,Thu May 14 13:18:08 2015 UTC,"Many people can't float, yup! It sounds like maybe you are currently learning to swim and are a complete beginner to the water, is the correct?  Learning to swim as a teen or adult, especially a very dense teen or adult who is not going to float is more challenging, but can absolutely be done. I taught teen and adult swimming lessons 'back in the day' and the very dense people took longer for the earlier portions because you need to have more forward propulsion to keep your body up. However, once you get to that point, it's really no different. I had a friend who was also a swim instructor and she definitely could not float. She could not demonstrate floating because she just could not do it. She was a faster swimmer than I was on the swim team, though. If you have a low body fat percentage either because you are very thin or because you are very muscular... well, that might be where you are too! You can help by filling your lungs as full as you possibly can and pushing your hips up, but if you can't float at all, you're going to have to focus on things like pushing off the wall and gliding in streamline (with and without kick) and other basic movements that give you forward momentum. Once you have a semi-competent stroke together, being dense won't hold you back at all."

Swimming,35wcef,baddspellar,1 point,Fri May 15 01:58:22 2015 UTC,"There is no ""dead man's float"" event in swimming. I have unusually low body fat, and I sink like a rock if I'm not propelling myself or I don't have enough air in my lungs. That doesn't mean I can't swim. I just need to adapt. One advantage I have is that I'm really good at drills where we have to stay underwater. Others tend to float to the surface."
Swimming,35w2oo,Order0fthePhoenix,4,Thu May 14 00:08:00 2015 UTC,"In my opinon, most people should probably should make your college decision based on academics, finances, and job placements for their graduating major instead of the swimming program."
Swimming,35w2oo,pudgypanda69,1 point,Thu May 14 02:04:29 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. However, if a bunch of different universities fit the bill in terms of what you want academically, then why not use the swim program to help you make the choice? If you're going to spend 16+ hours/week in the pool (as a very modest estimate), then you should probably pick a place where you can enjoy it. Over 300 universities and colleges in the U.S. offer swimming, so there is definitely one out there where you can have the best of both (academic and athletic) worlds."

Also, anytime we would tie bunge cords to the blocks and try to pull them as far down the lane as possible then have them pull you all the way back. Anytime we got to use flippers and anytime where we would practice swimming as far as we could underwater. Water polo was fun as well."

Swimming,35u9cx,cc12floz,2,Wed May 13 21:37:31 2015 UTC,We always called those catchup relays!
Swimming,35u9cx,Golden_Eagle,8,Wed May 13 22:20:44 2015 UTC,"Running dives!  One of my coaches had a roll of scrap carpet and laid it out at the end of the lane, kind of like a runway.  We'd have about 10-15 ft of running room and we'd run along the carpet and dive into the pool going for height and distance.    He also tied a rope across the pool for us to dive over.  One end was tied to a ladder or whatever, and he held the other end and would let go if anyone hit the rope.  This also helps with trying to get swimmers to dive for height and distance.  In addition to your swimming in clothes practice...we would do that but turn it into a relay where you would have to transfer the clothes to the next swimmer before they could start swimming.  There are some awesome tricks that we figured out eventually while doing these relays to make the transition faster but I would let the kids try and figure it out on their own.    Ex. Finishing swimmer gets out of pool and holds the wrist of the next swimmer while a third pulls the shirt from one person to the next."
Swimming,35u9cx,DuskytheHusky,1 point,Wed May 13 21:20:35 2015 UTC,"I like that idea. We usually have a relay where each swimmer puts a piece of clothing in the middle. They have to swim out, put it on, and swim back. We also do a survival thing in the deep-end aka every takes their pants and blows them up and wraps them around their necks and after they do suicides to get away from ""sharks."""
Swimming,35u9cx,No-Spoilers,5,Wed May 13 21:36:48 2015 UTC,"Drag races. Different ways of doing them too. For example, we had a drag race tournament where two people faced off each round. You would do 5 pushups, dive in and swim a 50, get out and do 10 reverse lunges, dive in do a 50 kick, then get out and do 15 squats. The winner of that part got to pick what that drag race would be. So then take 30sec rest and the two would race a 50 of whatever the winner chose. Winners face winners and losers face losers and so on."

MLK Jr day, the I am free set. 500 free 400 im 3 times.  As a swim coach now I'd just ask what kind of stuff the like doing the most then just go off of that."
Swimming,35u9cx,Schnoobs69,4,Wed May 13 20:25:13 2015 UTC,"I coach summer league and a game we play that really helps with bonding between age groups I like to call MEGAwaterpolo. Our pool is only 4 ft at deepest so what we do is make a younger kid, around 5-7, get on the shoulders of a older kid (14-18). The younger kids shoot while the older kids move and coach the little kids on when to shoot or pass. Lots of fun."
Swimming,35u9cx,IMSamZ,3,Wed May 13 20:35:05 2015 UTC,"Not really full practices but fun things we did. Kick board duels, essentially one kickboard and two people kicking towards each other, like reverse tug of war.   When tour de france was happening we did tour de twitch, (we called doing an IM with every other length freestyle twitch) so we started with a 200 im twitch and went 400, 600, 800, 1200, 1600 im twtich. After each stage we had a couple minutes rest and the winner of the precious stage got to wear a cap decorated by our coach."
Swimming,35u9cx,Dranzogger,2,Wed May 13 19:45:51 2015 UTC,"By far the team building ones. The younger kids go with the older ones and get taught, and when the practice is almost over, we do relays. Too bad they're only at the starts and ends of the season."
Swimming,35u9cx,black_irishman,2,Thu May 14 02:40:37 2015 UTC,Not my team but a friend of mines.  Basically every swimmer went in the water behind the bulkhead and tried to kick it for 50m. Damn.

Swimming,35u9cx,copperbricks,2,Thu May 14 11:59:06 2015 UTC,"Catchup races. Start with slower swimmers, then the person following them has to catch up.  Underwater fins 25s are always a blast.   Swim through the meet events (works for HS meets), eg you do a 200IM, 200free, 50 free, 100 fly, etc. 5 seconds rest at the wall between legs of a relay (although you swim the relay on your own),  5 seconds between events, 30 seconds rest for diving.

When the coaches write the whole set on the board and we go through it, it just makes for three hours of boring, routine exercise.  The best times I've had in practice were when the coaches switched it up, like 12x25 with a random dryland exercise after each one.  Or when they wrote six things (five brief sets like 3x100 free or 6x50 overkick, one was a 5 min break) for numbers 1-6, and each lane rolled a giant die and performed the corresponding action."

I find this happens to me, too, especially when I do sets like the you described (lots of hard, short intervals). I don't have this problem nearly as much when I do big blocks for my main set. I would just say ""Kudos"" because if your abs hurt that much, you are probably doing a nice job engaging your core to pull."
Swimming,35tonf,Gymrat777,2,Wed May 13 14:03:16 2015 UTC,"Hey :) I know about the subreddit for triathlon but I figured this was a swimming specific issue that this would be the better place for it.   I agree that the issue is caused by the power training that I had. The three blocks of 500 (resistance belt, peddles and pull bouy legs crossed and the push ups) was probably the most intensive training that I had this far. At the end I could barely jump into the pool again after the push ups.   I was just a bit worried that this didn't happen directly after the training but two days after it. But /u/Cuithinien pointed out that it is not quite that uncommon to get sore muscles days after an exercise.   Thanks for the kudos. I try to work on my technique as its the only way to keep up with some of the better swimmers in the club. I guess the legs crossed while swimming with the pull bouy had a big influence on the soreness and I really had to focus to keep my legs from completely sinking."
Swimming,35tonf,I_snot_the_sheriff,4,Wed May 13 14:46:54 2015 UTC,"Sore abs is a likely a sign you're doing at least some things correctly. One of the most basic mistakes many swimmers make is to not activate their core - but it appears that you are. Runners and cyclist (and many other well-trained athletes) learn core strength as a fundamental skill and know how to hold/work it naturally. You're probably just shocking the area a bit with some of your harder or less familiar sessions and movements. I wouldn't be worried.  As an aside, I once coached this high school kid who was a high level kayaker. He held his core as well as the many of the best swimmers in the world. It was simply a built-in skill."
Swimming,35tonf,charlesdickens2007,3,Wed May 13 15:15:48 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear that I'm doing something correctly! With activating your core while swimming, what exactly do you mean with that? I tried to make sure that my body position was good in the water while doing the pull bouy + legs crossed, really focusing on this otherwise my feet would sink completely. This had a lot of impact on my abs I think. Sure the resistance belt and push ups were hard but I mainly felt this in my shoulders/upper arms."
Swimming,35tonf,I_snot_the_sheriff,3,Wed May 13 15:31:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with sheriff.    Holding your core is going to prevent a lot of issues down the road, everything from back to shoulder problems.  I wouldn't stress about being sore.  One of my master's swimmers recently found out she has arthritis in her back at the age of 23 because she never uses her core while swimming.  It's a good habit to have."
Swimming,35tonf,Cuithinien,2,Wed May 13 19:57:16 2015 UTC,"Sorry slow reply.  By activating your core I mean keeping some rigidity in the body. Think of a surfboard - you want it to be stiff, right? You don't want to push a floppy noodle along the surface of the water, it simply won't travel as well.  So how do you do it? Well it sounds like you already are in some way. If I was to lend one tip it would be to hold those muscles that make you stop the flow of pee when you urinate. Focussing on those tiny little, deep-down, lower ab muscles will 'radiate strength'. As a bonus, they can make you better in the sack.  Onwards!"
Swimming,35tonf,CharlatanAlley,2,Mon May 25 02:22:44 2015 UTC,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_onset_muscle_soreness  I think this is what you're feeling.

Swimming,35o3tv,orgasnickk,17,Tue May 12 02:17:04 2015 UTC,"Weight and body composition is a complex science. Swimming is both fantastic cardio and moderate to good strength training. You will need to do a two pronged approach as you begin this. Analysing your diet is essential. As we move to adulthood there are some common changes to lifestyle which affect metabolism and body composition. One is the introduction of alcohol and more regular alcohol consumption. Alcohol is very calorie dense and incredibly easy to underestimate. It is also nutritionally poor. Another factor is that with the sedentary aspects of adult life both ourselves and our friends are less likely to run, play, kick a ball about or generally be passively active.   Swimming and especially high intensity swimming in short busts is the best form of cardio and muscle development you can get in the pool. You can burn fat on long distance swims but a 20 minute session where you go hard for intervals and use active recovery will be better. However if you are over consuming or are eating the wrong nutrients you won't see the muscular development and maintenance you want. You may also find fluctuations in energy levels as fuels are absorbed and accessed in different orders and at different speeds. Simple carbohydrate for instance is processed very quickly and while it can be used for a burst of energy it also converts to fat more rapidly. Complex carbohydrates are the best fuel source for a healthy body but can also be overeaten and should not eclipse your bodies need for proteins, fats and micronutrients.  Weight may be a function of calories in calories out but composition is not. You can easily lose the weight by eating a low calorie diet however without exercise your body will be lighter but appearance won't improve. Your legs and arms will be scrawny, muscle definition will fade and, one people don't like to talk about but are concerned about, your butt will sag.   Assuming you want to improve appearance rather than simply change the number on the scale then you need to consider diet and exercise. Monitor your changes with useful and important metrics like BMI, waist circumference and hip to waist ratio and body fat percentage. When used in combination these metrics are excellent for tracking your body and the improvements you make. When planning your goals look to lose 1-2lbs per week and I'd suggest being closer to 1lb/week. Losing weight too quickly is a fools pursuit and one reserved for those high in the overweight categories or those who are obese with a high body fat."
Swimming,35o3tv,Rorkimaru,1 point,Tue May 12 04:35:24 2015 UTC,^ This guy knows whats up. Especially as it concerns the distinction between calories in-out and actually feeding your body the nutrition it needs.
Swimming,35o3tv,Gymrat777,2,Tue May 12 15:07:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for this comment. Sadly there are many people who refuse to acknowledge the difference between required nutrients and required calories. I assume it's a backlash to the ridiculous HAYES movement but it itself is every bit as ridiculous. To say a calorie is simply a calorie is naive and flies in the face of a wealth of peer reviewed scientific research. While we may never change the mind of whomever downvoted your comment, hopefully we can encourage other people to engage with accurate nutritional information and learn what the body needs to function at its best."
Swimming,35o3tv,Rorkimaru,14,Tue May 12 23:07:58 2015 UTC,"Check out the r/loseit FAQ.  Weight loss is a function of eating at a calorie deficit. Calculate how many calories you need to eat to maintain your current weight , and then eat about 500 cals per day less than that.  Swimming will help you get fit... and burn some extra calories, but it won't help if you don't eat less than what you burn in a day."
Swimming,35o3tv,_o_O_o_O_o_,2,Tue May 12 04:03:47 2015 UTC,"First comes nutrition. Download some calorie counting app like MyFitnessPal to keep track of what foods you eat and how many calories you consume. You'll have to do this religiously. Set a calorie goal you think is right for you and stick to it. Someone said 500 cals under and that's a pretty good goal (this is also my goal). I have the app remind me at a certain time to log in my calories. As for swimming...  200yd free as a warm up   Pyramids: 50yd - 100yd - 150yd - 200yd - 150yd - 100yd - 50yd and 30 to 45 second rest in between. You can tweak the numbers if it's too much or too little but increase them every so often so it's still challenging for you. 300yd IM (kick-drill-swim): 25 fly kicking, 25 fly drills, 25 regular fly; 25 back kicking, 25 back drills, ... and so on The Mile (w/ paddle board): 12 laps of swimming, 11 laps of kicking, 10 laps swim, 9 laps kick, ... down to 1 lap kick. (swim on evens, kick on odds) 200yd freestyle but focusing mainly on your form, long/tight streamlines and good flips at the wall. Swim something different: 100yd fly, 100yd breast, 100yd back, 300yd IM, 50yd free, 100yd free, 200yd free, 500yd free, or 1000yd free   200yd free as cool down  I know I couldn't do these all in one day so mix and match.

Swimming,35o3tv,redditswim,2,Wed May 13 20:32:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not an experienced swimmer like the rest of the commenters here, but I have been swimming for weight loss for about 5 weeks and lost 6kg's (13lbs).   As others have said consuming less calories than you burn is essential. I use MyFitnessPal and have been sticking to my calorific goal (1500 calories per day).  I swim 5 times a week for 30 minutes, and just take it easy. I am doing mostly breast-stroke, with occasional lengths of freestyle. I started out really slow but have seen significant improvement to my technique over the last few weeks. Focussing on that during my swimming and trying to find ways to improve iteratively has made swimming interesting rather than boring, which I was worried about.  My first swim 5 weeks ago I managed about 650 metres in 30 minutes (~280 calories). This morning in the same amount of time I swam 900 metres (~360 calories). It's fun seeing such an improvement, which will only continue as I lose more weight and continue trying to improve my technique.  Finally I use this swimming calculator to work out how many calories I burn:  http://www.swimmingcalculator.com/swim_calories_calculator.php  I tried a few different ones in the first few weeks, and I found this one to be the most realistic. Some were massively over-estimating the calories, and some seemed about right but were giving funny results when I experimented changing different values, which meant I lost trust. The one linked above is the best I could find and I think is a reliable estimate of the calories burned.  On the days I swim, I plug in my exercise to MyFitnessPal, and that allows me to eat more than the 1500 calorie base amount. I don't think it is possible to accurately calculate calories from swimming, as depending on your technique your efficiency might be very high, which will mean swimming further for less calories. However what I am doing is working.  Happy Swimming!"

If you're starting from zero, IME 3x a week for 30mins going easy, then moderately and you will see results after 3 weeks. Just all the little things that are incredibly valuable; breathing better, running up stairs, walking faster, feeling firmer (arms, back and legs) and also looser as your muscles get used to doing what they are designed for.   Do follow a specific work out if you're experienced enough but don't worry if you're not - just doing it, pounding up and down on a regular basis, will make you feel great in a month."

Swimming,35oicj,Axiobelmot,3,Tue May 12 05:36:41 2015 UTC,Go to your local grocery store and grab the ear drops for swimmers. Lay on your side for the ear drops in for about 15 minutes each and I should clear up everything.

Swimming,35oicj,conjunctionjunction1,1 point,Thu May 14 07:27:05 2015 UTC,"If you wear earbuds/ear plugs a lot, it can sting a little, just a heads up. Nothing too bad, just a little annoyance. Try jumping while shaking your earlobe. You will feel SO stupid doing it but it works really well for some people.   I also found putting on a latex swim cap dry and pulling it super far down helped me a lot. Having water enter my ears would distract the fuck out of me and throw my rhythm off. Not completely covering your ears, idk why it works for me but it does."
Swimming,35oicj,Zimoria,3,Fri May 22 23:47:41 2015 UTC,"I use rubbing alcohol after every swim and haven't had ear issues in years, it A) sterilizes and B) reduces the surface tension of water, this makes the water far more likely to drain out of your ear canal.  1/4 of a cap full poured in and then drained 2-3 times per ear.  Takes less than a minute and a half."

Soak a cotton ball in hydrogen peroxide and lay on your side. Squeeze it out of the cotton ball and then wait for absolutely all the bubbling to stop, then dry your ear with a Q-tip. If that doesn't work, my next try would be antibiotics."

Be a supportive parent, don't go overboard - when the sport interferes with you being a parent there is an issue but you can hit a balance where you are the parent and a teacher (of sports)"
Swimming,35mnvz,HaddonH,3,Tue May 12 00:55:22 2015 UTC,I teach swimming as well as coaching kids in their early teens if I think there's anything that needs working I'd speak to you the parent. If a parent comes to me and asks about it I find it disrespectful as it suggests they think there child isn't doing good enough. If they are young like the girl in the video then it's as much a mental difference as to a technical. A happy child will always swim better than one that feels pressured to do better.
Swimming,35mnvz,dcravenor,-1,Tue May 12 12:22:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you are saying, my point was in academics parents are expected to help, in sport parents are expected to stay away? Why the dichotomy?  Both are categories where a child is trying to learn and get better, why treat one different than the other?"
Swimming,35mnvz,HaddonH,3,Tue May 12 13:44:37 2015 UTC,Because they are different. The equivalent in context to an academic scenario would be a child competing in a spelling bee or a physics problem solving competition. If that didn't make sense I'll flip it around. Helping a child to read is a fundamental skill similar to that of helping them to walk or when they start to run. I hope that was clearer as you were right my previous response was a bit all over the place
Swimming,35mnvz,dcravenor,-5,Tue May 12 18:24:49 2015 UTC,"Your clarity is about the same and I still don't know what you are trying to say, make a clear statement :     Parents should help kids with academics because_____. Parents should not help kids with athletics because ____. (not sure why this is going bold srry)  You: ?""The equivalent in context to an academic scenario would be a child competing in a spelling bee or a physics problem solving competition""  One is spelling and one is math.  I see no reason why a parent wouldn't be fully able to help in both of these situations, both are academic undertakings. My contention is that parents are not obligated to operate 'hands off' when it comes to their child's athletic endeavors, they should be involved and supportive.    Anyway I'm going to wish you the best, whatever works for you.  Thanks"
Swimming,35mnvz,HaddonH,3,Tue May 12 18:36:40 2015 UTC,Why are you generalising academic versus athletic?   Learning to read and the act of competing come under those categories but are by no means level within them. Maybe that's where your misunderstanding my point.
Swimming,35mnvz,dcravenor,-3,Tue May 12 19:19:28 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know what you are trying to say, I don't think you are addressing my point and you are answering some other question or talking to some other point.   The thread I answered to stated: ""leave coaching to the coaches""  I disagreed and said that there is every reason parents should be involved in athletic coaching and wondered why we make the distinction between athletic and academic. I'm not at all sure what you are talking about and at this point I'm not sure you are either.   My position: If we find it acceptable / appropriate to be involved in children's academics why are so many of the 'hands off' when it comes to athletics? Both are situations where children learn and need guidance.  If you have something to say to this thats fine, make a solid definitive defensible statement rather than mushy comparisons.   Thanks,"
Swimming,35mnvz,HaddonH,2,Tue May 12 19:32:04 2015 UTC,That wasn't specifically what you said originally especially as you said an example about helping a child to read but nevermind.  Right if you want a straight answer to the question when generalising Academia vs Sports it is because the view of society upon those fields
Swimming,35mnvz,dcravenor,-3,Tue May 12 20:39:40 2015 UTC,"I spoke to reading as every parent feels properly obligated to help their child learn to read, we don't ""leave teaching to the teachers""  why do we ""leave coaching to the coaches"".  ""Right if you want a straight answer to the question when generalising Academia vs Sports it is because the view of society upon those fields""  You seem confused and your inability to just make a definitive statement (you haven't done this yet again) of any sort worries as you claim to work with kids. I don't usually opine that adults should look into taking aderal but you might want to think about it."
Swimming,35mnvz,HaddonH,8,Tue May 12 20:45:52 2015 UTC,"Biggest thing, aside from letting an eight year old develop with time, is body position when breathing. You can see her slow down when she breathes, since she brings her body up. The head should be moving forward.  This video addresses body position."
Swimming,35mnvz,edr247,5,Mon May 11 23:21:17 2015 UTC,"She is only 8, but I'll say she's kicking too hard. In freestyle or backstroke hard kicking is good, but in fly it can screw with the timing. In the video it looked like she was shaking from the overpowered kicks. If she can control those kicks, it would be much easier to get a solid pull too. Think of the stroke as a full body pull: the arms, core, and legs all work together to make a single powerful pull. In contrast to free, where the pull and kick are fairly independent."

Swimming,35mnvz,redredwhiiine,3,Tue May 12 00:52:46 2015 UTC,"I have been swimming competitively since I was 7 years old. We had a good team, and a stern coach and we were fast. Hard trainings, 8K sessions, lots of medals. By the time I was 14 I had to quit because my shoulder was done with swimming. The most talented guy on our team quit when he was 16. A guy I know from my town just qualified for the Olympics this weekend in the 100m freestyle. He only got into serious training when he was 15 years old..  Diversify, include other sports for young kids, let the body develop. I went to play soccer later which is a great sport, also to play in a team was something new to me.  More specific to your question, she's breathing too high and her timing of the last stroke to the wall was a bit unfortunate. Keep it light and fun, focus on technique and confidence instead of speed, competition and hard training."
Swimming,35mnvz,MountainousGoat,3,Tue May 12 06:12:53 2015 UTC,"I know plenty of people who started swimming 4-5 years old and are still swimming throughout college (some went off to make olympic trial times and 1-2 were on the olympic team).

Swimming,35mnvz,lsuswimmer,9,Tue May 12 21:29:55 2015 UTC,"Two major areas: 1. Underwater butterfly kicks off start. Not an easy time-sensitive fix, as it takes lots and lots of practice and consistency. 2. She brings her chest and head way up when she breathes. The goal should be to keep moving forward especially during breathing. Keep chin low and just raise the head enough to grab a quick breath. Neutral head position is the least amount of drag."
Swimming,35mnvz,JGrayBkk,1 point,Mon May 11 19:41:34 2015 UTC,"Good advice... I don't want to confuse her with too much info, but I told her one thing you've mentioned today about keeping her chin low and not coming out of the water as much as she does. Thanks!"
Swimming,35mnvz,MysicPlato,1 point,Mon May 11 23:47:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i saw the same two things (kick and breath). It looks like towards the start she has a couple of kicks where her legs go past 90°  For breathing i always taught my younger swimmers to try breath while looking at the water"
Swimming,35mnvz,mrhandman,3,Tue May 12 00:43:45 2015 UTC,Body position is the biggest thing I saw here. She's pulling up and losing momentum instead of keeping herself driving forward. Body should stay in line and the head should be much lower.

Swimming,35mnvz,teflondon1994,2,Tue May 12 05:04:36 2015 UTC,"Breathing is a bit late, which may cause the loss of speed. Other possible issues are best mended after puberty.  At this point of the ""swimmer's career"", this is probably best mended through a lot of varied basic exercise to improve coordination. If she's interested, try signing her up for gymnastics, which is great for that purpose."
Swimming,35mnvz,dashan987,1 point,Tue May 12 08:08:47 2015 UTC,idk why these people won't give you help. Her head is coming way to far out of the water while she is breathing. tell her to keep her chin touching the water while breathing and not to pause with her stroke in doing so. your welcome
Swimming,35mnvz,obriek4,1 point,Tue May 12 04:55:21 2015 UTC,"She comes up a bit high on her breath, which loses some momentum and strains her rhythm and balance, but I'm sure the coach is on top of it"
Swimming,35mnvz,SpeedoTan,1 point,Tue May 12 14:20:25 2015 UTC,"The timing of the kicks seem to be off.  There should be 2 kicks per stroke: once when her hands are entering the water, and once when her hands are exiting the water.  The stroke should look like she's ""gliding"" or ""flying"" over the water, but because her kicks are not correctly timed, the stroke appears discombobulated.   I would also politely disagree with some of the top comments because there's no way for Internet strangers to tell what kind of attention the coach devotes to each swimmer, if any.  Also, it's never too early to learn proper swim technique."

She did it no problem but was slow (for her). I don't think 1 week of training is going to do much for your endurance anyway. Maybe just run some drills and get reacquainted with the water.

I am a former competitive swimmer who is getting her butt back into shape and swimming a mile was not a huge obstacle right after coming back. (I was running and lifting when I got back in the pool.) I am sure it won't feel great, but I am also sure you can complete the swim. I would probably do sets of 200s or something, or maybe a few ladders, just to get back in the pool this week a few times and remember what it feels like, since a week is not enough time to really get back your endurance. If you can do a short open water swim this week that would also be great, since open water is a little more challenging. But you will be fine."

Instead I spent years of training, you know, like pool swimmers do, and learning to be an expert open water navigator.  And it's not just me.   The feeling against items like this, (and you know, there already exist vrious versions) are such that we wrote it in the first global rules of marathon swimming and many marathon and open water swimmers around the world have written to their various national organising bodies asking them to be banned for open water swim event as unfair technological advantage."

Im sure they could find room to integrate a circut board. after all, they already make 3d glasses and google glass and the packaging is fairly minimal   Overall would I use it...probably not, but if you could integrate google glass into scuba diving i think that would be awesome.

Swimming,35kqaz,JGrayBkk,1 point,Mon May 11 08:03:30 2015 UTC,"Hi there. :) I'm a noob when it comes to swimming (recently joined a course focused on improving form in the different styles at my university so I've been lurking around this subreddit. You guys are all super helpful!), but I've been into fitness/nutrition for quite some time and I just wanted to mention the following:  When starting (or restarting) anything, it's very common to subscribe to the ""go hard or go home"" mentality of trying to do as much as possible as soon as possible. And while that does work for some people, for most it doesn't because they burn out as soon as ""life gets in the way"" for a day or a week. Which it does. All the time. ;)  I don't know what margin is recommended for raising your weekly distance for swimming  (for running, it's about 10% if I remember) but doubling it within 7 days seems like a lot. Especially if you've been starting to decrease calories at the same time.  But yeah, as I said ... very limited experience with swimming, but considering my experiences in other areas of fitness: Don't go too hard in the beginning. If you've been sedentary before, don't drastically lower you calories while significantly ramping up your activity. Your body needs time to adjust to and to recover from your workouts. If you are very overweight, you may be fine on a bigger deficit in the beginning (since you body has a bigger ""storage"" of energy to draw from) but for most people, a smaller deficit which you can do continuously do is better than a big deficit you'll be able to keep up with for just a few weeks.   In other words: Maybe I'm overly cautious, but ... moderation is key. Starting slow and keeping it up is better than going all out and crashing after a few weeks. Don't mess up the great changes you are trying to accomplish by burning out or getting injured early on. :)"
Swimming,35kqaz,TheFiley,1 point,Mon May 11 11:54:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i completely agree with you. i take 2 days off a week at a moment.

I know all too well that the go hard or go home thing doesnt work oit to well. I use to do that and i ended up getting a ridiculously sore throat, terrible coughing, along with a depleted battery for the next three or four days.  Thankfully i think my diet is helping a lot with that, along with ample sleep.  my goals for next Sunday's swim are a step up for sure, but i dont think its pushing me too hard. Especially since with swimming technique makes all the difference in the world. If you can get your stroke perfected you save so much energy and even more time, and that's what i think made the biggest difference for me.  Thanks for the comment, what you mentioned is definitely super important and I hope its useful to others as well!"
Swimming,35j6s0,S0CIOPATH,25,Sun May 10 22:06:38 2015 UTC,"I'm going respectfully disagree about the kick, 2 beat is fine in triathlon, your body position is good, you need to save your legs.   Your pull (bluntly) is weak.   Use a pull buoy to real get a feeling for what your body is doing.   Your hand is slipping backward from the catch, not doing any good until around your shoulders. Your hand should ""catch"" water as soon as it can.  Then you rotate back to flat too soon in your pull, a good drill is to rotate your shoulders completely perpendicular as you catch and leave them that way through the whole pull, it feels like you're trying to touch the bottom of the pool (while maintaining a good flat body position). Switch to the other side, shoulders rotating a full 180, right as your hand is finishing the pull.  Stretch that stroke out, make it long and grab water from the catch to the finish. Good vid  Notice her high elbow early in the stroke, her hand is dropped and catching water early, you're missing that whole bit in your stroke.  For tri/open water, I also spend a lot of time working on swimming in a straight line. It hard when there's no line to follow. Practice breathing forward one per lap, look at the end of the pool just to get motion of sighting the buoy down.  Also, if you're wearing a wetsuit, you can almost completely drop the kick, it'll keep you floating,  your legs have lots of work to do later.  In general though, your form isn't bad, you just need to work on getting some power in that stroke. Work some sprinting into the workout, just so you can feel that hard push on the water."
Swimming,35j6s0,TElrodT,9,Sun May 10 23:25:25 2015 UTC,"About your ""catch"", it's also worth noting, /u/S0CIOPATH, that in this video her fingertips are pointed to the bottom of the pool throughout the stroke, no matter the timing of the stroke or the body rotation. You are starting your stroke by turning your fingertips towards your core and pulling using your forearm along an imaginary line running straight down the middle of your body. Simply put, that's quite inefficient. Instead, your entire arm, not just your forearm, should be moving with your hand. I'd recommend using a pull buoy and slowly swimming, watching your hand entry, catch, and pull with your fingertips down (You'll have to adjust your head alignment for this drill and tilt it up to see your hand go in. But other than the drill, don't make any changes to your head position while swimming. It's great in this video!)"
Swimming,35j6s0,QsGirl,4,Sun May 10 23:55:56 2015 UTC,"QsGirl and TElrod are right on point. Great observations. Get that elbow up. It should really never be below your hand. Aside from that I'd point out that your head position is really good when not breathing, it's helping you keep your hips high and your body in a good spot while moving. Keep it up!"
Swimming,35j6s0,icalltopsolo,9,Mon May 11 00:43:07 2015 UTC,"You have nice body position. It's hard to tell at full speed, but I feel like after your hand enters the water it does a weird slide backward so it's not gripping the water at all. Try focusing on your catch by doing sculling drills, using paddles, and generally being more aware of anytime your hand is not pushing water. Keep it up!  Edit: Oh, and consider amping up your kick. I know it's cool to use a 2-beat kick, but you need some more power, so try a 6-beat for a while and see if you get any more power."
Swimming,35j6s0,Davy_Dee,2,Sun May 10 22:16:19 2015 UTC,"Multiple people have noticed his stroke isn't catching water, but you are the only one to suggest sculling drills :) I like you.  I'd argue that ""catching water"" is primarily based on one's ""feel for the water."" The fastest way to build this up is by sculling, IMO. Furthermore, triathletes are concerned with saving their legs during the swim leg, so developing a strong efficient pull is of utmost importance. Practicing different sculling drills during your swim work outs will help you tremendously.   edit: formatting"
Swimming,35j6s0,OnSteel,1 point,Mon May 11 15:03:55 2015 UTC,"^ my triathlon coach just told me today to not bother with sculling as the latest trend is ""no sculling is just as fast as sculling so why bother with it""...     or do you actually mean to do sculling drills to get a better catch, but not actually scull in real races?"
Swimming,35j6s0,TunaBoo,1 point,Mon May 11 17:16:37 2015 UTC,"Yes to the latter. Sculling drills are much slower than a full swimming stroke and are meant to be done during practice to improve your ""feel"" of the water. Practice, practice, practice, and you will start to understand what catching more water feels like. As this happens, apply it to your stroke and reap the benefits!"
Swimming,35j6s0,OnSteel,3,Mon May 11 19:32:37 2015 UTC,"Wow, 9 responses and nobody pointed out the ""cheque"" in title (just noticed it myself now :p).  I have an Ironman race in 5 weeks, so I won't change my training now too much, but after that I'm getting into winter training and I'll focus on building proper technique. I'll post a updated video in couple of months, hopefully with much better form!

Swimming,35j6s0,mansaf87,5,Mon May 11 18:48:48 2015 UTC,"Your arms are crossing-over on the entry. Your left hand looks like it's piercing the water way too close to your head, giving you very little catch. (It's tough to see from this angle, but I think you have the same problem on the right side too.) It also looks like you're rotating your wrist upon entry, further weakening your catch and making your arm slip through the water. You're not getting decent extension on the catch either. All of this is weakening your pull and making it pretty underwhelming.  Your kick could also use a bit of oomph. You're doing a slightly out-of-rhythym 2-beat but you're also kind of scissoring your legs at certain points and kicking from the knees. All in all, it doesn't seem like you're getting much propulsion out of your legs. If you don't want to employ a 4- or 6-beat kick, then I suggest you watch some videos of open water swimmers and triathletes (or 1500m Olympic swimmers) and see how much propulsion they're generating from their kick."
Swimming,35j6s0,ABabyAteMyDingo,4,Sun May 10 23:13:29 2015 UTC,"That's not that slow for a triathlete if you can do that for 1500m.  As others have said, you are not catching and pulling the water at all. And your hands are crossing in the midline. Your elbow is falling right down when it should stay high.  Your body position is fine. Don't worry about your kick now. In a wetsuit you will be fine.  You need catching and pulling drills. Read this  http://www.swimsmooth.com/catch.html"
Swimming,35j6s0,sysmicShok,2,Mon May 11 06:37:51 2015 UTC,"You body position isnt bad. However, in your pull you elbow is dropping below your hand, you always want to keep you hand below your elbow. The same way you hand enters the water (hand, elbow, shoulder) is the same way it move through the water (hand moving first, always below the elbow, which is always below the shoulder. This is mostly with your left hand, from what i can see your right arm is doing alright. Also with your left hand, you are pulling in under your body rather than getting onto your side and pulling through the water. Focus on keeping that left hip down for longer. Also with both hand you need to finish of the stroke all the way through. This is a minor concern, but for long distance it helps. Also more work on your kick, making sure you always have some form of a kick going. PM me if i need to explain any part of this better"
Swimming,35j6s0,kansascrime,2,Sun May 10 23:07:38 2015 UTC,"Along with everyone else's suggestion I'm gonna echo on your pull but instead of commenting on your technique I'm gonna try to put a visual into your head of what a strong pull should feel like and be so maybe you can apply that visual and understand the actual feel of what is right and wrong.   When you're  swimming you are trying to pull yourself through the water. Now compare your freestyle pull to trying to do a one handed pull up. You are essentially trying to apply the same force to the water as you would a pull up bar in order to propel yourself past your hands. Swimming in water is a lot like trying to do a pull up on a a pull up bar that is suspended from the ceiling on a spring. When you apply that pulling force your body won't move as Much as the pull up bar will. The idea of the ""catch""  everyone is talking about is trying to keep your hand in one place to pull your body past it rather than moving your hand past your body. You want to pretend when your hand enters the water that it is stuck in that place and you have to pull your body past it.   I don't know if that helps or is just confusing, but that's how I like to think about it."
Swimming,35j6s0,FussyParts,1 point,Mon May 11 16:16:49 2015 UTC,"I'm late to the party, but I'll echo everyone here.  The good: 2 beat kick is OK for distance swimming, especially triathlons. As an ex-sprint swimmer, I'm changing my kick from a 6-beat to a 2-beat as I train for a tri. Your hips and shoulders are rotating pretty well, which allows you to breathe easily. That's one of the harder things that new adult swimmers struggle with. Your stroke looks overall pretty relaxed and you're not making unnecessary splashes and waves.  The bad: Your pull. It's weak. It's hard to tell exactly what's going on. I'd say it looks like you're primarily trying to pull with your arms and you're not engaging your back (the main pull muscle for freestyle). This could be from a number of things, but likely boils down to improper hand and elbow positioning (i.e. ""crossing over"" like someone else mentioned). It also almost looks like you're slicing/slipping through the water with your hand as opposed to catching water. Engage the muscles used in this video. It's mostly back with arms playing a support role.  Try swimming with a pull buoy between your legs and focus on getting pull from your triceps and, mainly, your lats and traps. I suspect your hands might be crossing over and your elbow positioning could be placed ""out"" a little more from the median of your body.  You could also try watching videos from this thread"
Swimming,35j6s0,Pattk33,-2,Mon May 11 14:52:18 2015 UTC,"Everyone saying 2 beat is fine, that is good and all but if you really want to be a faster swimmer, kick. Not saying you need a six beat kick, but simply kicking more with help you immensely. Do more kick sets, kick and scull to work on your hand pos/feel for water."
Swimming,35j6s0,TunaBoo,5,Mon May 11 17:04:01 2015 UTC,"Have you ever raced a 70.3 or 140.6 ironman?    How much do you want to kick before you go bike 110 miles and run 26? To save what, 2 minutes on the swim?"
Swimming,35j6s0,Pattk33,-5,Mon May 11 17:17:56 2015 UTC,"Oooh sooo hard!! Come on man, Im giving him advice on swimming, I noticed that he could kick more, to simply make him more efficient moving through the water. Don't try and call people out for dumb shit, you don't know what I race, or what sports Im a coach for.  I could even argue that not kicking through a swim would negatively effect your bike and run, use your arms and core so much you cant stay up on your aero bars? Or keep your back straight and proper form through your run? Dude if your on this sub you should understand balance is key. Is kicking going to negatively impact his performance, or possibly improve it and in doing so make him a better, faster athlete??"
Swimming,35j6s0,TunaBoo,2,Mon May 11 19:11:49 2015 UTC,"Except look at what you said.   but if you really want to be a faster swimmer, kick.   He doesn't want to be a faster swimmer. He wants to be a faster triathlete. Overkicking is not how you do that.  As for   I could even argue that not kicking through a swim would negatively effect your bike and run, use your arms and core so much you cant stay up on your aero bars?    I am not going to dignify that with a response ;)  To clarify I totally do not think his kick is textbook perfect, and sure he could work on it a little. But it seems his pull is so much worse, it seems the obvious place to start, no?"
Swimming,35j6s0,Pattk33,-2,Mon May 11 19:29:54 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't being a faster triathlete mean.... Being a faster swimmer??? Crazy thought, I know.    Overkicking is not how you do that.    What does that even mean? When did I say anything about overkicking? Just add kicking sets to warm up and do a kick set after your main set, that's overboard?? Is making yourself more EFFCIENT is a bad thing now?   I am not going to dignify that with a response ;)   Why? Because Im right and you cant make up some excuse? That is definitely true what I stated.   But it seems his pull is so much worse, it seems the obvious place to start, no?   Kicking is the most important part of swimming, that is what moves your forward. The fastest swimmers are all the best kickers. If you can kick with ease, improving on your freestyle gets easier and easier."
Swimming,35j6s0,TunaBoo,0,Mon May 11 19:55:15 2015 UTC,"A swim is at most 1/4 and as little as 1/10th of a tri. So no, swimming faster at the expense of your race is not how you race a tri."

Swimming,35j6s0,MonsterMeowMeow,1 point,Mon May 11 19:51:26 2015 UTC,"same thinking here...  Yeah, I get that you don't want to ""waste your legs"" as a triathlete, but you can't be constantly pulling with your shoulders and: 1) Expect to swim correctly; thus 2) Not get injured  You can work in pulling with a buoy into your workout - along with kicking, sprints, drills, and other strokes to keep your swimming balanced.  I am just afraid that if swim like that 2000 yards 2-3 times a week your shoulders are going to start barking and get impinged.  Regarding your pull... as someone noted above, don't pull in towards your center line.  You want to keep your fingers pointing down and pull out at shoulders' width with your hands then going back below your ""pockets"" (hips).    You look like you have pretty good body position regardless - I only think it would get cleaner with a more normal kick and an efficient pull.  Remember, don't sacrifice your freestyle stroke b/c you are a ""triathlete"".  Add more pulling/buoys/paddles and don't kick as much during an actual race, but you can't afford to screw up your shoulders because you didn't use your legs."
Swimming,35kowo,DjangoLeone,3,Mon May 11 07:39:29 2015 UTC,"You might want to experiment a bit with this, it really depends on how hard you're swimming and even then it varies by person. I have friends who eat massive amounts of food less than an hour before training and are fine and then there's people like me who can't really eat anything massive (maybe a bagel) for about an hour before training, due to the risk of throwing up. So really, just have a fiddle around with timings and stuff. You should definitely eat sometime before though, maybe have a normal, healthy lunch at about twelve with slow-burn energy so by the time you get to the session you have energy to last you through the session."
Swimming,35kowo,TheMoffalo,1 point,Mon May 11 09:30:42 2015 UTC,"Like you suggest I think experimenting with this is key. I'm going to start playing around with a few of the things suggested here and see what works best e.g. bagel, granola bar, trail mix etc and see how I get on.   I've since found out I've got bigger things to worry about though as I had my stroke analysed and now need to focus on getting rid of my straight arm pull!"
Swimming,35kowo,PartyPatComeback,2,Sun May 24 08:46:10 2015 UTC,"Try getting some carbs in you about an hour before, something light to prevent upsetting your stomach (pb&j, trail mix, bagel, etc). A small source of sugar within thirty minutes beforehand (glass of oj, granola bar, fruit) should help as well. Aslo, dont forget to hydrate throughout the day as well!"
Swimming,35kowo,OnSteel,1 point,Mon May 11 14:39:48 2015 UTC,"Definitely something you will have to experiment with since everyone is different.  I always liked something light before practice like a bagel with jam, a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, or a piece of fruit. I'd usually have an energy bar sitting poolside to take bites off of every now and then throughout practice. I dislike sports drinks, but watered down, they are tolerable and will keep your blood sugar up as well as giving you some electrolytes."
Swimming,35kowo,TheGreatCthulhu,1 point,Mon May 11 15:09:51 2015 UTC,"For the training you are doing, food is not a problem. You have sufficent energy stores for 2 to 3 hours exercise on a average daily diet without having to eat anything extra."

I'd suggest emailing the head coach and getting his/her opinion, or maybe visiting them in person. You'd definitely be able to swim at other D3 schools, but there is a very large talent spectrum. For instance the fastest 100 and 200 breaststroker this year in Division III would've made B finals at Division I nationals. But the spectrum also includes swimmers who are significantly slower than you are. If you're set on Babson though I'd suggest training harder than ever.

Swimming,35ivkx,luckybms,9,Sun May 10 20:27:37 2015 UTC,"It depends on so much ...   The main factor for weight loss is diet. Swimming will up your metabolism - so will weight training ... both will contribute to a calorie deficit if you control your diet  But - are you likely to maintain swimming or gym? Are you comfortable in public in your swimming costume? Does swimming make you happy?! How much do you want to lose / how long will you have to keep a calorie deficit? How old are you? What is your general fitness? etc etc etc  General advice - don't lose more that 2 kg a week ... the stress to the body will affect your mood & psyche too much and you're more likely to fail the diet. Consider joining a with loss support group - dieting is stressful. Equally, consider joining a swim group meet or exercise class - it makes it more fun! Consult with a trainer to build a plan that's personalised and to minimise injury ... learn about stretching and warm ups ... Be prepared to set an hour or two aside everyday to exercise & diet preparation. Have patience :-) remember to enjoy yourself!   Check out /r/fitness ... they have lots of good links in the FAQ"

Swimming,35ivkx,chrom_ed,9,Sun May 10 21:07:14 2015 UTC,"That's still pretty dependant on diet and variations in both workouts. True bodybuilders cut almost entirely by dehydrating themselves. It's not a tenable long term strategy. If you just want to look cut as opposed to doing a true competition cut program than you can do it a lot of different ways.   Your goals should be:  1) minimize fat.   2) build enough muscle to look ""cut""  You burn fat by holding a calorie deficit and ideally working out for extended periods at ~70% max heart rate (although I've seen debate that simply power lifting is an effective fat burning method too, there are lots of different perspectives and many seem to work for various people).  The easiest way to build muscle is weightlifting, and unless you're working really really hard you probably won't be able to build enough muscle to look ""bulky"" rather than ""cut"" if your fat content is low.   As long as you hit those two points you can get the ""cut"" look.   Hope that was somewhat helpful."

Swimming,35ivkx,evanshall,5,Sun May 10 21:11:02 2015 UTC,To clarify you may lose less weight or none at all by replacing fat with denser muscle while weightlifting. You will almost certainly get thinner but if you only want to weigh less you should either just swim or weightlift differently than those trying to build muscle. (Low weight high reps [that's 12-20 reps depending on the exercise don't go crazy] won't build much mass [yay nested parentheticals!])
Swimming,35i0da,Rizzo707,7,Sun May 10 15:53:56 2015 UTC,"In the 50 free virtually all of the best swimmers have zero pause whatsoever. Do not glide or pause in a 50 free.  In the 100 free the top swimmers have some variety. Unlikely the 50 free, in the 100 there is a tradeoff between pure speed and efficiency. Notice that Vlad Morozov has no pause at all, while James Magnussen has a fairly pronounced glide. You can also see a great contrast in this video between the loping Jason Lezak and the windmill of Bernard:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QPYiHi_Vs4  Very different styles, but both men won medals at the Olympics in the 100 free. This should tell you that the ideal stroke timing varies from person to person. You might go faster more of a Lezak-ish style, and you might not.   It is important to note that you can still improve efficiency and distance per stroke without introducing any sort of pause.  Look at Alexander Popov below. He was famous for his efficiency (34 strokes for a 50 long course sprint with few dolphin kicks) , but note that he goes directly into the catch:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soDCVP7P2NQ  One thing that sets most elite freestylers of all distances apart is that they have an excellent high elbow catch. No matter the timing of their stroke, they are able to position their limbs to produce a large amount of backwards propulsion while using their big muscles effectively.   For what its worth, my PB in the 50 free went from 23.0 to 21.7 after reading and thoroughly internalizing this book, which more or less focuses entirely on proper catch position in freestyle:  http://www.amazon.com/Swim-Speed-Secrets-Swimmers-Triathletes/dp/1934030880/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1431285335&sr=8-1&keywords=swim+speed+secrets"

Swimming,35i0da,agent_reddish,3,Sun May 10 21:35:37 2015 UTC,"When you sprint you have to find a good balance between fast turnover and staying long. If you're just windmilling you're not going to go as fast as you would by stretching your stroke out front more. You will never rotate as much in the 50 as you would in the 500, but your stroke should still be long. Without seeing your stroke I can't tell you if your length and rotation are good or not."

Swimming,35ip29,meeksysqueak,2,Mon May 11 04:54:47 2015 UTC,"As long as it's only soreness and no sharp pain, just keep doing what you're doing. Your lats just aren't used to it yet. If it gets to be sharp pain, that's when you need to work on your stroke."
Swimming,35ip29,thewildrose,1 point,Sun May 10 23:42:44 2015 UTC,"Could you define ""sharp pain""? I was swimming a length and I started to feel the pain. Initially, it felt like a cramp for those 5 minutes... then it just stopped but it still hurts when I touch it."
Swimming,35jinr,mintbbx,1 point,Sun May 10 23:54:02 2015 UTC,The 'whip kick' is the only kick worth considering for competitive breaststroke. So much so that you pretty much only ever hear it called breaststroke kick. Be prepared for the possibility of some serious knee pain if you aren't up for it though.  As for breaking streamline I don't understand exactly what you mean.  Edit: if you explain it more i will try help as best i can.
Swimming,35giq7,Tyler77i,1 point,Sun May 10 03:18:44 2015 UTC,I am in the exact same situation as you. Remember to keep your legs straight but other than that I myself have to learn.
Swimming,35giq7,Eddyman308,1 point,Sun May 10 03:38:17 2015 UTC,"Make sure you are kicking both up and own at a rate of at least 6 kicks per hand entry (12 beat kick).  Focus on your quads and not your feet, your feet should just follow your quads. Squats, leg press, lunges.  Also, make sure there is no pause in the tempo of your kick when you breathe, and then carry that fast rythm over to just kicking.  Good luck!"
Swimming,35giq7,roostad,1 point,Sun May 10 04:31:49 2015 UTC,"Kick from the hip with a straight leg and relaxed knee, toes pointed, but not super tense. Your kicks should be short; separating your legs a lot will create drag. Ideally, you should be bubbling the water right below the surface (that's not the right verb because there really won't be any air involved, but it creates an effect a bit like a rolling boil on a pot of water); you shouldn't really have your toes come out of the water when you kick.  Talk to your coach. They can watch, evaluate, and coach you while we can only speculate.  A couple ideas: vertical kicking in the deep end of the pool and kicking with fins can help with getting the feel for an efficient kick."
Swimming,35giq7,QsGirl,1 point,Sun May 10 05:02:35 2015 UTC,When I started doing club sophomore year I was the slowest kicker on the team and could not even do 50's on the minute. Basically you just make sure to bust your ass off in everything you do and ask about kicking technique to your coach. Also if your like me and started swimming this late you probably don't have very flexible ankles so work on that. I now can sprint kick a 34 in the 50. I'm a junior now.

Not sure about how fast you currently do them, but doing something like 10x100free on a hard interval keeps it interesting and is a good workout.

Swimming,35fyil,X_StreetCred_X,1 point,Sun May 10 02:06:04 2015 UTC,"Outside of cardio and quickening your stroke rate with maximizing your pull, focus on creating and keeping your momentum. The dive, the walls/the pushoff (on your back!), the streamlines, the underwater dolphin, the breakout/breakoutstrokes, breath control.   You'll be fine. Come back when you get it."

Swimming,35bw2f,jolls,9,Fri May 8 20:45:59 2015 UTC,I am lucky enough to have swam from a young age but I always find it so humbling and inspiring when I see adults learning to swim! It is an incredible sport and far too many people miss out on it because they are too proud/embarrassed to learn how to swim/swim with good technique. So props too you for learning!   I'm going for my first triathlon this year too! Terrified but what's the worst that can go wrong? :D

I've only learnt the breast stroke, and I'm still a very slow swimmer, but at least I am no longer the slowest swimmer in the pool - am slightly faster than the darling old grandfather who had a stroke last year :)  I really hope you go for it.

Swimming,35bw2f,HaddonH,2,Tue May 12 05:50:03 2015 UTC,"I didn't learn to swim at all until I was 27 (self-taught). I finally joined a masters swim class last year (age 44) so that I could learn proper technique and compete in a triathlon. It was amazing how much I learned and how different swimming felt to me.     I ended up completing the Nautica Malibu Triathlon last year, and that is ocean swimming, which is another level of hardcore.     I'm doing another Tri this year, and I'll probably continue to swim for the rest of my life. There's something about gliding through the water under my own power that's hard to put into words, but it's amazing."

Swimming,35dgpy,Jarl_Herblings,10,Sat May 9 06:40:20 2015 UTC,"In my opinion if the 300 is something you are worried about you should not be a lifeguard. Someones life might depend on your swimming skills. If you feel good about your swimming skills go for it, if you don't maybe spend a little time thinking about the responsibilities you'll have. The test is not to hard after you take the class, maybe a little extra studying but nothing to hard."
Swimming,35dgpy,bubblesorted,0,Sat May 9 08:55:47 2015 UTC,"I mean, I am physically fit such as I work out 4 days a week. I am just worried about finishing it out. I used to swim a lot but no competitively."
Swimming,35dgpy,deantoadblatt,10,Sat May 9 09:04:40 2015 UTC,"Physical fitness by itself doesn't translate to swimming ability.  If you're really interested in becoming a lifeguard, go to a pool and go through the class prerequisites.  If you go to the pool where the course is being offered and explain the situation, they may be willing to let you use the 10 pound weight that's used in the other prerequisites (though prerequisites vary depending on the class you're taking).    As bigbirdbigbird said, the written tests (multiple choice) are on material you learn in the class, so it's only relevant once you decide to take the class and get in."
Swimming,35dgpy,ProperAccount1,3,Sat May 9 14:36:48 2015 UTC,Swimming for fun is not even close to the same thing as swimming competitively.
Swimming,35dgpy,Grapleef,1 point,Sat May 9 16:49:26 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, (take it or leave it) anyone worried about doing a 300 is not a strong enough swimmer to be a lifeguard. You might pass the class, I know a lot of people I took class with were poor swimmers. But when performing deep water backboarding or even just deep water rescue you need a good feel for the water, remember your job is to save someones life"
Swimming,35dgpy,j52t,1 point,Mon May 11 10:33:12 2015 UTC,"If you are looking at the American Red Cross certification in the US, make sure you can do the 300 yard swim continuously, time is not nearly as important as not stopping. The other current aspects of the prerequisites are a two minute no-hands tread and fetching a ten lb brick and swimming it ~20 yards. The best way to go about these is to take your time and be as comfortable as possible, hopefully you will have some time before your class starts to practice a little bit.   In terms of the written/formal test, it will be at the end of your class, so your instructors should be preparing you for it as you go."

If your goal is to exercise in the water, you'll be fine trying to teach yourself.  If your goal is to become a better swimmer, you probably need lessons.    Don't worry about how other people your age swim; the point is that you're learning something that you want to learn.  Also, you might look for a place that offers adult lessons, which probably have a structure you'd like."

Swimming,35atlo,monkeyontheinternet,6,Fri May 8 15:38:08 2015 UTC,"As someone with chronic shoulder pain from swimming, my insight is to go to a doctor.  There is literally nothing anyone can tell you on reddit that will be of any use without actually performing an examination.  Don't let it sit, hoping it will get better, just go to a doctor.  It may be nothing, it may be something, but a doctor needs to look at it if it's bothering you.  As far as your stroke is concerned, talk to a coach in your area.  The same thing applies here -- no one on reddit can tell you what you're doing wrong without actually seeing your stroke."
Swimming,35atlo,Bubbay,1 point,Fri May 8 16:25:06 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply. I understand that only a doctor can give a completely accurate diagnosis (compared to internet forums), but I really appreciate your guys' insight on situations that others have experienced as well."
Swimming,35atlo,TElrodT,2,Fri May 8 18:47:37 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say what the issue is, but ramping up the distance will exacerbate problems.  You should probably continue to do some stroke drills to keep things sorted out...  My shoulder problems were caused by dropping my elbow on the catch. Google ""high elbow catch"" to see a description of what's going on, it's easier to explain if you see a picture. I was getting shoulder pain right where you identified, changing my stroke to a high elbow fixed the problem for me, though it still feels awkward.  Remember to push muscles, not tendons, if it hurts, back off or you're going to swim yourself into a surgery."
Swimming,35atlo,TElrodT,1 point,Fri May 8 16:41:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have had problems with low elbows, and after I changed, it still feels awkward. Any specific drills you would recommend?"
Swimming,35atlo,BlazeTTD,1 point,Fri May 8 18:46:16 2015 UTC,"I don't have any specifically to fix the low elbow problem. It's the one thing I focus on all the time, if I stop thinking about it my elbow drops.  To me, it feels a bit like hugging a beach ball. Even though it feels weird, I find my open water times are quicker- I think because my shoulder doesn't start bugging me after a few K's.  You should have better luck changing, you're only 21! I'm 40, trying to correct 30 years of muscle memory..."

Swimming,35atlo,patchywetbeard,2,Fri May 8 23:15:29 2015 UTC,"I had pain that was similar to what you describe. For me, the long-head bicep tendon was inflamed due to bad posture, over developed pecs and under developed back and tightness in my biceps. I urge you to go to a physio asap. Failing that, I'll tell you what I did for treatment: plenty of stretching of pecs and biceps, lots of back flies, rows, and pull-ups/downs. Of course, I left it too late, and can't swim properly anymore. Which is why I think you should have this checked out."

Swimming,3599yq,lDucks,1 point,Fri May 8 04:23:05 2015 UTC,"I actually quite like the idea. I'd consider it complentary rather than supplementary to a proper swim but agree you could get some fitness benefit from this. And hey, use your pool - that's what it's there for (alternatively heat it and turn it into a Learn-to-swim school and make lots of money).  To the other comment regarding balance, I agree it's harder to balance when static but what you've described is not the same as riding a stationary bike, it's more like riding a bike on rollers. You'd gain some benefit from practicing it as you don't have the same momentum holding you up.  One last thought, once you learn to float/balance properly, you can easily cheat this sort of set up and get less value than it may seem."
Swimming,3599yq,I_snot_the_sheriff,-1,Fri May 8 14:44:20 2015 UTC,"Have you ever used stationary equipment before? Because it sucks. Swimming is a about balance, in order to have balance you need to have forward momentum. Stationary equipment is like trying to learn to ride a bike by riding a stationary bike. You could prolly get ""tired"" but I don't know if it would be a good workout.   Personally that also sounds incredibly boring  too. In my experience, longer term training plans based on boring workouts never lead to much success."

Edit: spelling"
Swimming,358oim,obriek4,4,Fri May 8 01:44:50 2015 UTC,Do you stretch long and often? I found when I started swimming my muscles would get unbelievably tense is I didn't stretch right away. This would cause hip and knee pain for me.  I now do hip specific stretches and feel great!

Swimming,358oim,planet_x69,1 point,Fri May 8 04:27:59 2015 UTC,"As with all sports and activities start slow. You will experience some pains as your body and joints adjust to the new usage patterns.  Somethings to keep in mind at a high level:   Learn good form first then speed 2nd - kick from the hip small short leg motions with minimal knee bend and toes pointed for freestyle kicking action, kick from the waist down with fly and keep ankles together and kick up as hard as you kick down and back kick is much like free - expect to feel the burn in your thighs if you are doing it right and again keep toes pointed Learn to balance - Don't do just freestyle kick, do at least three styles during your work out to balance out your muscle workouts - I recommend Free, fly and back in that order. I do not recommend breast till your legs and muscles are stronger When in pain - stop, rest and see a doctor, if just sore, rest, go slower and focus on form not speed. If a certain action is causing you pain, stop and seek advice. Stretching - learn to do slow long stretch exercises for your thighs, calfs and hamstrings, same for your bicep, triceps and deltoids, spend a good 15 minutes doing long slow warmup stretching will go a long with with making your stroke more relaxed when you are first learning or getting back into the water"
Swimming,358oim,adchrom,1 point,Fri May 8 14:11:20 2015 UTC,"What strokes are you doing and what is your workout like?  Some things that may help: Warm up!! I do an easy 400 frestyle to warm up, take it slow get things moving.  If you are doing all breast stroke, it's been known to be hard on the knees and might stress your hips as well.  Mix it up if you're heavy on Breast Stroke.  My back and hip pain from pre-swim days took a couple of months to go away once I really started swimming, I think my core was just so flabby that my body relied on other muscles to stabilize and that strained them."

Swimming,35a85j,HoxHound,9,Fri May 8 12:26:28 2015 UTC,You don't.  What's the benefit you think you can get from doing this?
Swimming,35a85j,Notanasianswimmer,5,Sat May 9 01:26:18 2015 UTC,you go faster obviously... Glide further and faster.  Getting away with it is a whole other issue though. If you are in a middle lane you can potentially sneak in extra kicks under water on the start and even the turn. Seeing as the start allegedly is no faster and the turn is a lot cleaner it isn't worth the risk.  As for during the stroke if you actually fly kick you will get caught every time. Depending on where your foot position is at the end of your kick you can get a pretty significant kick upwards though (which is legal). but you can't kick down.  While I wouldn't encourage cheating (and i don't purely because my fly kick sucks) that doesn't mean it shouldn't be discussed. Plenty of people will cheat against you and you have to know every advantage you can take to get the best possible performance.
Swimming,35a85j,jared0h,3,Sat May 9 02:47:27 2015 UTC,An upward dolphin kick is completely legal. Just don't kick down.
Swimming,35a85j,bugchild9,3,Sat May 9 06:25:02 2015 UTC,I find this idea abhorrent to my entire idea of the act of swimming competitively. Why are you even swimming to drop time in the breast when you are not even doing the stroke? Cheating in all sports no matter how small is inexcusable in my opinion.
Swimming,35a85j,Eggmebabyonemoretime,1 point,Sat May 9 12:18:44 2015 UTC,Exactly. Once you think of cheating to get ahead you're compromising the integrity of the sport.   If OP wants to drop time he needs to train hard and remain disciplined.
Swimming,35a85j,Notanasianswimmer,2,Sat May 9 13:59:08 2015 UTC,"Professional swimmers constantly are bending and breaking the rules. The love of the sport stuff is great and all, but if you want to win at the highest level you have to make use of every advantage you can get.  For example, In my age group a few years back it was all the rage to not seperate your hands before doing your fly kick in the underwater work in breaststroke. Technically against the rules, but impossible to see and ever so slightly faster. Eventually you will run into someone who works as hard as you do and is willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done."
Swimming,35a85j,jared0h,1 point,Sat May 9 16:29:01 2015 UTC,"Sure I know people will cheat. I've raced plenty of people who have and they've been caught plenty of times. If you're ever caught cheating that just tarnishes your reputation.   I prefer to do what is morally right and win the fair way, without cheating."
Swimming,35a85j,Notanasianswimmer,1 point,Sat May 9 16:47:03 2015 UTC,"Sure. and I would prefer to have an Olympic gold medal like Cameron Van der Burgh. You will also notice if you watch that race carefully that almost every swimmer in the final did extra fly kicks on the start, it isn't a coincidence.  His reputation doesn't seem all that tarnished imo."
Swimming,35a85j,jared0h,1 point,Sat May 9 16:55:48 2015 UTC,"What Van der Burgh did was horrible and he basically stole gold from the swimmer who actually swam the right way. The thing is swimming for me is about swimming, not bending the rules to swim faster, but to swim faster by swimming faster."

In fact I am near certain the only swimmer who didn't do it was actually Sprenger.  Almost everyone in the semis did it. And i bet almost everyone did it in the heats and at trials to make the team. It is something incredibly prevalent in breaststroke swimming.  If we disqualify VDB we would have to disqualify everyone.  edit: can confirm that Sprenger cheated also.
Swimming,35a85j,jared0h,1 point,Sun May 10 01:15:24 2015 UTC,"Unless your form is already to a point where it would be effortless to kick down, it's not worth the physical and mental effort to make it part of your stroke. If there were some type of swimming science to come out that shows a significant difference, that's the only way that could convince me to look at it. I don't care if you're going to try to cheat or not, that's on you and your conscious (and on your conscious while you're racing). I highly doubt it will give you the advantage you're looking for."
Swimming,35a85j,supple,1 point,Sat May 9 23:04:06 2015 UTC,I think there is no doubt adding fly kicks between strokes would be faster. Streamiline fly kick is faster than breaststroke if you are good at it. Problem is that any kick that is sufficient enough to increase your speed is going to be easily noticed by the officials.
Swimming,35a85j,jared0h,1 point,Sat May 9 23:34:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's what I'm taking into account. Streamline kick is definitely faster, but it could mess with your timing or other things for breaststroke. The limited power generated v. effort v. getting caught just doesn't seem to be worth it, mostly from a personal perspective and knowing how my own stroke is. I give leeway knowing that others have a different strokes and it could work better for them. For 200 BR pace I can see it working out a bit more, but I feel like would be more obvious. I will look into it more, but it's really hard to see the benefits outweighing the consequences."
Swimming,35a85j,supple,1 point,Sun May 10 00:10:25 2015 UTC,Drive your stroke recovery (i.e. when shoot your hands forward) slightly downwards and you will naturally do an slight up-kick during the recovery portion (when you bring your feet to your butt) of your breast kick.
Swimming,35788b,DieSchwagerin,11,Thu May 7 18:05:49 2015 UTC,"Are you specifically looking for Division 2 or are you just looking to swim in college?  There are D1 teams where those times would be just fine and D3 teams where you'd be consistently on the B/C relays.  Since you're not really in the range for getting scholarship money (at least, not significant amounts), you're probably better of figuring where you'd like to go for your education, then contacting those coaches  and working from there."
Swimming,35788b,Bubbay,6,Thu May 7 19:30:48 2015 UTC,"Depends what your goals are. If you are merely trying to be on a a college swim team, you are in good shape. If you are looking for a scholarship, this is a much different conversation. There is not a lot of money to go around, and it is very competitive."
Swimming,35788b,Willetscat,2,Thu May 7 18:55:16 2015 UTC,Thanks! What would be good times to get scholarships?
Swimming,35788b,fiddlestix42,4,Thu May 7 19:10:51 2015 UTC,If your grades are up to par some schools will help you find academic scholarships until you get to the point where you can earn an athletic scholarship.
Swimming,35788b,fiddlestix42,5,Thu May 7 19:24:11 2015 UTC,Also look up Jr national time standards. Those times are usually good enough to get some schools at least talking to you. Not full ride money at faster schools but it can be helpful to get schools interested

Like the other two guys in here posted though, money is tight so scholarships wont be thrown at you, but if you go after them you may get something, and keep your GPA up."
Swimming,35788b,majorassholesir,6,Thu May 7 19:23:16 2015 UTC,"I've posted this a couple times already but I think it's probably the best advice I've ever gotten:  I'm currently a senior D1 swimmer at a midlevel program. That being said, I think the best advice I received about swimming in college was this:  Take all your best times. This is usually your top two times and a third if it's competitive  Look at a whatever conference you want to swim in, or think you can swim in  What time did it take in each event to score at conferences (generally top 16)? How does your time compare to this time?  Find a school within that conference that you can see yourself attending  Compare yourself to them, are you within the top two or three in your best events? The top two or three in each event are the ones who are going to get a scholarship to swim  Look at which times are seniors. If a certain team is losing a lot of people that year they're gonna be freeing up a lot of money.  Hopefully this helps! Let me know if you need anything else or are confused about anything on this list!"

Swimming,35788b,devjensen314,3,Thu May 7 18:54:16 2015 UTC,"Back when I was looking to swim D2, I talked to a coach and he said that to be competitive on their team, they were looking for swimmers with AA times. You know, that motivational standards thing that USA Swimming puts out. Idk if that's true for any other team, but I saw it as a good goal to go after in high school."
Swimming,35788b,snrDD,3,Thu May 7 20:29:25 2015 UTC,"Depends on the level you're trying to compete in. I'm not sure how much of a scholarship you're gonna get for division 2, but some d3 or NAIA schools would probably offer a decent amount. But if you have your heart set on d2 then just keep swimming and messaging coaches (most coaches appreciate communication). :)  Source- I'm a sophomore swimming recruit for an NAIA team (and my times were about the same as your own)"
Swimming,35788b,machiodo11,2,Fri May 8 00:16:20 2015 UTC,"are you looking for a scholarship?

I work as the JV Coach and Swim Lesson instructor for a year round team.  We offer a masters program in the mornings, and we had a variety of people in attendance.  There were mostly mothers and fathers of swimmers on our team who wanted a good workout, but there were also other adults training of triathlons or improving skills.  I was the youngest swimmer being 20, but it is mainly people in their late 30's to 50's...  My Boyfriend is actually our masters coach as well as the assistant coach for the team.  He will usually assign a practice and the group get into their own pace.  He isn't really their to lead the practices, more to offer assistance with technique, answer questions, and lifeguard.  Masters usually tend to be more low pressure, and are more about being healthy through the sport as opposed to competition training.  (That's not to say they don't!). Last season our coaches relay set a record at city meet!  I hope you have fun!  Good luck on your first day!"

Swimming,354lhb,LickMeAllOver,8,Thu May 7 01:37:08 2015 UTC,"You can't ""reset"" the suit. It's similar to any fabric you wear, the more wear the more it stretches out or loses its original shape.   The best way to preserve the longevity of the suit will be to minimize the amount of time spent in the suit. Don't warm up in it, put it on about 20-30 mins before your event, or whatever time you're comfortable with it. When done with your race, take the suit off and rinse in cold water to help get the chlorine off the suit. This will help keep its water repellency longer. Squeeze the excess water out lightly and air dry the suit, don't even think about going near a suit dryer with it."

Make sure to change right after the meet is over, and neatly fold the suit and make sure it doesn't get too wrinkled up on the way home. Thoroughly wash the suit with COLD water as soon as possible and lightly squeeze it to get the excess water out (don't wring it). Then hang it somewhere to air dry. While you can't really ever ""reset"" a suit, by doing this you'll make sure that it'll last as long as possible.

We do it dirty in the deep end (more appropriate for water polo, but whatever) Harder, Better, FASTer, Stronger Not the right season for it, but once my team had a 3-day meet in mid December, so we got shirts with our coach's face with a beard and Santa hat with the quote ""he sees you when you're sleeping"" so you guys could do something like that. Swimming: because we're too sexy for a sport with clothes. when was the last time your coach yelled at you for BREATHING? I swim, therefore I.M. Oxygen is overrated. You can always breathe later When life pisses in your pool of dreams, just add chlorine and keep swimming.   Do you guys have a mascot?  Could probably think of a lot more puns if you do."

Swimming,350fia,bmnzn,1 point,Wed May 6 06:44:56 2015 UTC,These are kids anywhere from 4-10 at a beginner level. Most of them know the basics of each stroke but have bad technique and conditioning.
Swimming,350fia,bmnzn,2,Wed May 6 12:07:06 2015 UTC,"Nice! At that age make it all about fun and technique. They've got so much time to develop strength and endurance. There are some certification classes to teach you solid technique but nothing beats having a mentor. Coaching swimmers requires intuition. You have to be able to recognize not only what's wrong but also how to fix it for them. In the case of kids, you have to communicate in their terms which is always a challenge. We need more good swim coaches though so I'm stoked you're asking for help!"
Swimming,350fia,I_fell_down,1 point,Wed May 6 16:22:15 2015 UTC,Thank you! Ill look into certification as well as some off the other ideas you posted.
Swimming,350fia,devjensen314,2,Thu May 7 02:23:05 2015 UTC,"This might help: http://swimmingcoach.org/product/summer-certification/  But certifications are only part of the coaching experience. My advice is to find a mentor in the area and watch them, ask questions, and understand the soft skills of coaching, such as commitment, confidence, and how to understand winning & losing. Most anyone can teach technique. Coaches teach success."
Swimming,350fia,cburtltop,2,Wed May 6 12:41:30 2015 UTC,"drills drills drill drills drills.  When I was a senior I was the head coach of a summer league team of 60. It's hard, but super fun. You will need to teach them a lot of drills, and tell them why they are doing those drills. Don't just let them do the drills and not think about what they are doing. You will also need to spend a lot of one on one time with them. Have them do the drill, and tell them what they are doing right and wrong. This is probably the most important part of coaching children. As far as conditioning goes, kick is a great thing to work on for children. Finally, remember they are there to have fun! So have fun with them once in a while. We didn't play games every day, but once a week we would play something like water polo, or sharks and minows, or tag. Anything to get them swimming, without them realizing that they're actually doing conditioning. Actually my favorite (and the kids) day was when I got in the water and raced them. Me doing a 200 IM, vs them doing an 8x25 free relay. It was so on. There was no way that I was gonna lose to 8 11-12 year olds easily. I pushed it super hard to try to beat them. They were screaming on the side of the pool, cheering their teammates on. Even the parents who stay and watch from outside the pool were cheering. I ended up being within 3 seconds of my best 200 IM time, but I got out touched by a 12 year old girl. Oh the shame. I was so proud of them though. Best experience from coaching ever.  Recap: 1) Drills 2) more drills 3) kick 4) have fun 5) Oh and also be patient. They think that they're doing what you ask, but technique is tricky. Good luck!"

Swimming,34xp97,kategoj,6,Tue May 5 17:58:30 2015 UTC,"I have a mild form of this (well, not sure if it's technically an allergy, but a sensitivity) with rash, skin irritation, sneezing, itchy throat, and runny nose.  Luckily no dizziness.  After years of just dealing with it, I recently started taking OTC allergy medicine (loratadine) due to other unrelated allergies, and surprisingly it helped the nose and throat problems.  For skin, regularly using (non scented, mild) moisturizing lotion after practice also helps, as does showering before practice (which everyone should do anyway!).  My symptoms are less severe in colder, less chlorinated, and better ventilated pools.  Luckily I now live in a city with multiple pools and teams, and this does influence my decision when and where to swim.  I also find that swimming many days in a row makes everything worse, so I try to have one non-swimming day between swimming days (I'm a masters swimmer and also do other sports, so 3-4 practices a week is usually sufficient).  I'm also curious to read others' solutions and ideas on this thread!"

Swimming,34xp97,captive411,3,Tue May 5 16:52:48 2015 UTC,"Coconut oil and its derivatives can cause a(n admittedly rare) contact allergy (1, 2, 3) and vaseline is not water soluble, so aside from protecting your skin, will create a film on the water's surface (as happens in summer pools when lots of sunscreen-wearing people get in), and can cause trouble for some filtering systems."
Swimming,34xp97,majorhosebag,-1,Tue May 5 19:43:35 2015 UTC,"To me, personally, it's worth the ever so minute risk. Unless the pool you're in is seeing a massive, summer-level influx of people using coconut oil and vaseline, the PPM is negligible.

Swimming,34xp97,Spongebobrob,3,Tue May 5 21:34:59 2015 UTC,I have had the same thing for years. Not much on the rash side but sneezing and runny nose. It'd go on for hours after I got out. I mostly just dealt with it since all my other allergies were terrible anyways so I was used to it. But I can say that long hot shower afterward tended to help but not a ton. Maybe 1 benadryl before practice? if you take them a lot like I do you kinda don't really feel the drowsy part of it.

You could go see a allergy doc. Sorry to say but your symptoms will generally get worse with more exposure with these kinds of type I hypersensitivity allergies. Having said that, Allergy does not always follow this predictable course and sometimes a certain amount of allergen tolerance can develop with repeated exposure.   Taking Vitamins will have no affect, but taking anti-histamines should allievate some of the symptoms. Do you feel wheezy or short of breath along with the dizziness?  You are experiencing quite significant symptoms and you could be putting yourself in danger by continuing to swim there."

Swimming,35003g,TheUpset,2,Tue May 5 23:37:28 2015 UTC,"So for me the absolute best thing to do to get the chlorine/chemicals off you is to get into a sauna for a few min. after your workout.  Get a good sweat going and you sweat most of the chemicals out of your pores.  Then you hop in a cold shower to clean the rest of it off.  If you don't have access to a sauna then I would recommend doing a bit of a dryland workout after getting out of the pool.  Do push-ups, squats, burpees, & core exercises.  Anything to work up a sweat.    Finally consider going to a local swim shop (if you have one in the area) to see if they might have specific moisturizing bodywash or after practice lotion.  A final option would be to make an appointment with a dermatologist and see if they have any recommendations.  They are a medical professional who specializes in skincare so they would be the best expert to ask."

Swimming,34vuor,bugchild9,1 point,Tue May 5 00:33:29 2015 UTC,"I would definitely have to agree with this.   When it comes to swimming, there is a limit to how hard you can physically work, but mathematically, you can always be working closer to the achieving smallest drag coefficient possible, while maximizing your power output.   The jump from being good to great isn't just hard work, it's working hard all the time, mentally and physically. It's the little technical things that you perfect over time that will add up to perfection.   Mindful work, not mindless, is the key."

Swimming,34vuor,lrdchaos3,10,Tue May 5 03:59:29 2015 UTC,ALWAYS consider everyone competition. That is a horrible way to race. Your teammates are there to push you in practice and races as well.

Swimming,34vozw,Jooften,3,Mon May 4 23:12:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to tell you to or not to swim in college but the coaches not caring is not true at all. Sure, there may be a few coaches but the vast majority realise school comes first. The doubles will depend on how big/good the college's swimming program is. If they are decent you bet your ass there will be some glorious 4am practices, IT'S ALL PART OF THE SWIMMING GRIND!"
Swimming,34vozw,Shadowslight3x,2,Mon May 4 23:55:50 2015 UTC,"Some of those things could very well be true. Swimming in college is a major commitment, and like all major commitments, if you are not willing to put in that amount of effort (double  workouts, early morning practices, etc) then you should reconsider.  You asked for pros and cons.  Pros:  1. Provided you do your research and pick a college with a good program, the combination of team and culture will be one of the greatest experiences of you life. Very few times in your life will you be able an environment where you have an entire team committed to seeing you achieving your goals, because all of your goals are the same. 2. Scheduling becomes pretty easy, because everything falls into place around workouts and meets. 3. You have an easy in to staying in shape. 4. Resume padding, as long as you can write well and can adequately express your experiences. Cons: 1. Can you commit to the work involved? In addition to some of the stuff I listed above, you have to be prepared to sometimes put swimming ahead of your studies. Some of the notable stories I have heard involve athletes missing their midterm exams, and having their final be worth twice as much. It means you still have to study, and you double down your grade, which is based on (mostly) one test.  However, the first thing your mother claimed, that the coaches will not care for your well-being, is for the most part false. There might be some tough love and the like, but for the most part, as long as you do your research and find a program you are comfortable, with a healthy environment and good coach, you shouldn't have any problems you cannot overcome.  And finally, it's your choice. Don't let your mother influence your choice. If this what you really want to do, then do it. Just understand the full depth of commitment required. Good luck!"

It's just that during college, when one doesn't have much to put on their resume, swimming can be used (as long as it is utilized well)."
Swimming,34vozw,invicta_imperator,2,Tue May 5 01:39:37 2015 UTC,"None of that is true. I am a D1 swimmer and a physics major at a big ten school. I wake up at 5:30 for morning practice 3 or 4 times a week.  Pros: meet new, awesome people Swim really freaking fast Pushing yourself past what you thought you could Cool travel opportunities Opportunity to rise to the pinnacle of the sport Cons Waking up early sometimes is tough Time management can be an issues, but if you care about both school and swimming you will do fine Do NOT let anyone other than yourself convince you about whether or not you want to swim in college. It's a ton of fun but also a ton of work. To me, it's 110% worth it.

Swimming,34vozw,blumdrew,2,Tue May 5 01:44:46 2015 UTC,"Pro:  Once in a life time experience, you only get 5 years post high school to participate in the NCAA.   Travel some pretty cool places.  Have a second family, also known as your team.  Possible monetary value in form of grant/scholarship for participation  Con:  Time commitment  Your team is like your family (Yes this is a pro and a con)  If you don't pick out a team that fits you, you might have a bad time.   Same with coaches.    I don't know how good or bad you are in terms have swimming ability or academic potential. I can tell you my schedule on a normal week would have four practices that started at 5:45, but every team is different.  I can't tell you college swimming is a good fit for you. What I can tell you is that I would encourage everyone to at least try it. You can always quit. There is no rule that says you can't. If you are thinking about not swimming in college, I would encourage you to go to a school you will be happy with NOT swimming at."
Swimming,34vozw,bugchild9,1 point,Mon May 4 23:53:51 2015 UTC,"For DII or DI you will be practicing 20 hours per week (the maximum allowed for any NCAA sport). You will be doing frequent 2-a-days. Typically one starting around 5-7am most days and another starting sometime between 3-7pm. Sometimes this means morning lift, afternoon swim, but that depends on the coaching style.  Many people find it difficult to balance school and sports. If you can, great. If you can't you'll have to compromise somewhere. If your times fall, you may lose a scholarship or a spot on a relay. If your grades fall, then, why are you in college? I swam DIII and had coaches that would yell at us: ""FussyParts, don't you have that big O Chem exam tomorrow? What the hell are you doing here!? Go study!"". This is not true of all DIIIs but was for mine and was what I needed.  It'll be different at every university, but if you're DI or DII between classes, homework/studying, and swimming, you'll be pulling 60+ hour weeks every week. It's not easy, but many people make it work.   Pros: Potential scholarship. There are other pros like camaraderie and such, but you could easily find that in a club team or other extracurricular activity.  Cons: Scholarships usually aren't big unless you're the best of the best. In which case you're not at school to learn. A $500-$2000 scholarship + books and potential for more (common for great-but-not-superstar freshman) might not be worth your time (equating to less than minimum wage)."

Here's an average day for me.   -Wake up at 4:30 to get in the pool at 5:30 for 2 hours.  -Swim anywhere from 6-10k yards -go to my dorm and get ready for class at 10:10 -class from 10:10 - 2:15 -get back to the pool at 4:00 -swim 4k yards sprint sets  -dry land/weights at 6:00 on Tuesdays and Thursday's  -mandatory study hall at 6:00 on MWF, depending on your gpa you either stay until 8 if above 3.0 or 9 if below 3.0 -go home and either pass out or do homework until midnight  Most d1 schools have a gpa requirement to compete and all d2 school have a 2.0 minimum for eligibility.   Fair warning most swimmers have easier degrees, not all, but a good amount. It's very rare to see swimmers graduate with a STEM degree. Swimming is very time consuming, often time freshman start of STEM or pre-med, but either drop swimming or switch to a less demanding major."
Swimming,34vozw,sorry_tomorrow,2,Mon May 4 23:59:48 2015 UTC,"I'll back up the ""easy"" major. I transferred from DIII into a mid DI school and considered swimming. Had a small scholarship. I'm glad I didn't. There were only a handful of swimmers majoring in STEM and they put classwork off to the side. I majored in Biochem and knew I wanted to do hardcore research, so not having time to do volunteer research was a deal breaker for me. Again, if you can balance both, more power to you, but I saw many classmates bomb tests because they just didn't have the time or energy to give the class the time it deserved."
Swimming,34vozw,FussyParts,2,Tue May 5 00:05:17 2015 UTC,"The schools I went to, had an academic center that would keep track of me to make sure I was doing what I had to do, to stay eligible. I have to say, if you want to pursue a STEM degree you have to want to put in the work, plus the academic center basically won't let you fail."
Swimming,34vozw,bugchild9,2,Tue May 5 03:40:24 2015 UTC,Op I would disregard this comment  This is very specific to his own school and it is differs from school to school. Just makes sure you find a school that fits you

For the most part, college coaches get paid a salary that is pitiful at best. They coach because they love the sport and love working with college athletes."
Swimming,34t6ub,teequ,3,Mon May 4 10:39:22 2015 UTC,"I would say it depends on how much you weigh.  Honestly - running especially a marathon is hard on the joints - heavy frames are at higher risk for damage in those long runs (source: am 220/6'3,  ran 2 half marathons).  My recommendation is 2-3x/week running to build impact tolerance and at first 3-4x/week swimming to build cardio endurance. As you get within a month or so of your marathon I would cut back on the swimming to 2-3x or as needed to help maintain a specific level of cardio health / breath control."
Swimming,34t6ub,bzaks1424,2,Mon May 4 13:55:20 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit overweight, but not obese by any means (184cm (6'1) and 88kg (194lbs)). It's more that I don't have similar muscle mass in the upper body that I used to.  I'm already running 3-4 times a week (+30km, ~20miles in a week) and have participate in 10k and 5k races. I introduced swimming as cross training so that I can have another type of endurance training instead of several days of rest when I've joint soreness.  However, I found out that I'm really enjoying swimming, and I would like to take a more goal-oriented approach also to it in addition to running and improve my times. Maybe even participate e.g. in Olympic distance triathlon next year a few months after the marathon.   If there are good plans that fit my planned 1-2 swimming sessions per week schedule, I'd be happy to try them out."
Swimming,34t6ub,MonsterMeowMeow,3,Mon May 4 19:48:13 2015 UTC,"I would agree with BGSloth - take care of your shoulders.  I am in a similar position - training for 2015 NYC Marathon... got back into pool late Dec 2014... have been swimming 4 months now (3-4 times a week)  My 2 cents:   Focus on your form first.  My fat out-of-shape ass was able to quickly get back up to speed not b/c I was in great physical shape but b/c I swam relatively efficiently.  Go to Master's swim lessons, watch YouTube videos, take a couple of private lessons to have someone look at your stroke.  This will hopefully protect you from... Shoulder injuries.  As BGSloth noted, you aren't sporting your high school/college shoulders any more... as much as people love to say ""you can't hurt yourself swimming!"", you easily can with too much yardage and bad form.  If you are anything like me, you are going to need to build a lot of supporting shoulder/back muscles so you can keep stable strong shoulders... 2-3 10 min, very light 4-5lb shoulder lifts can help. Build yardage slowly.  I made the mistake of going from 1600 yards to 3500 yards in a couple of weeks.  My shoulders squawked and I had to shut down for a week and lower my yardage to ""heal"" them.  Take it easy, focus on form over distance and add 5-10% distance every couple of weeks until you reach your target workout in a couple of months.   Structure/mix-up your workouts.  I would guess the ""traditional"" workout includes a 1) Warm up 2) Drill set 3) Main set 4) Kick/sprint set 5) Cool down.  There are a ton of examples out there on the web.  Look around and see what you can put together - but don't neglect your kick/sprints/IM strokes in order to keep your workouts balanced.  Early on - Rest between sets.  I would say that until you feel as if your form is back and you aren't panting at the end of each 100, you should give yourself plenty of rest (30 secs+) between each set/rep in order to make certain you can focus on your form and swim cleanly.  As much as it might be tempting to ""push"" yourself and get your heart-rate way up, you aren't going to get much from the workout if your form breaks down and you are splashing your way down the lane.  You can always lower the interval rest time later on when you are in better swimming shape. Try to find a swimming partner.  Often harder said than done b/c most people aren't that crazy about getting the pool 1-2 times a week, but it really helps keep one motivated and focused on short/long term goals.   Best of luck with your running and swimming!"
Swimming,34t6ub,landofcortados,1 point,Mon May 4 15:07:52 2015 UTC,Nice post. Abide by the rule of 10% always... even for my younger kids that I coach... I try not to increase their yardage by more than that.
Swimming,34t6ub,MonsterMeowMeow,1 point,Mon May 4 16:55:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks, lots of good advice there!  So, to summarize, you suggest that on my swim training, I focus getting back my old technique first and build yardage slowly.   Currently it feels that I can keep a good swimming form from the old muscle memory for 100-200 meters, but due to my upper body not being in good enough shape I start to lose it. However, from what you are saying, it's likely that my form is already bad from the beginning and that's why I get too exhausted to maintain any form?"
Swimming,34t6ub,BGSloth,2,Mon May 4 19:37:30 2015 UTC,"I feel as if form trumps strength in the pool.  Strength will develop as you put in the weeks of laps, but that additional power needs to be focused appropriately or one won't see results/run the risk of hurting one's shoulder. (In my completely uneducated opinion.)  First, given your info above, it sounds like you have a swimmers build at the height and weight (unlike us munchkins) - so now all you have to do is give yourself enough rest to allow that muscle memory to keep on doing its work.  I am almost always thinking about my stroke while swimming.  Hand placement, body positioning, the catch, the pull, especially my exit and arm/elbow placement out of the water... Don't focus on everything at once just one element at a time.  Then piece them together over the months... But as you do you'll find that not only are you getting in better shape but you are more efficient in the water.  (And of course this never will end as your stroke  improves and your lap times drop...)  Again, I might be a wimp, but I am a big proponent of plenty of rest between sets early on.  Focus on your technique and endurance will come next.  It is like the movie Hoosers but the other way around... Focus on your ""shooting"" (stroke) then you can go nuts with sprints and crazy drills!  Finally, YouTube is my favorite resource for inspiration and stroke self-help.  If you can't get someone to directly work with you it is a great place to start the review/thinking process on how you can improve your swimming.  Good luck!"
Swimming,34t6rq,PaperTemplar,3,Mon May 4 10:38:03 2015 UTC,"Swim a bunch of 50's but force yourself to only breathe on the 3rd stroke then the 5th then the 7th then the 9th stroke (3-5-7-9 breathing pattern). Or, if you want to focus on just increasing your lung capacity without worrying about bilateral breathing, breathe on the 2nd stroke then 4th then 6th then 8th.  Another is to force yourself NOT to breathe anytime you're between the flags and the wall.  It's a gradual process but this should help.  It's a mental thing."
Swimming,34t6rq,Purple-Mounted,1 point,Mon May 4 12:07:09 2015 UTC,"We do a few variations of this at Masters practice. Today was 6x75s, 3-5-7 through the whole thing. It definitely helps."
Swimming,34t6rq,gertrudeblythe,2,Tue May 5 21:01:44 2015 UTC,"Sounds like my Masters practice. :)  Swim on, my friend!"
Swimming,34t6rq,Purple-Mounted,3,Wed May 6 13:12:20 2015 UTC,I would spend more time on creating effortless technique. Take a few hundred meters at the start of every practice to drill out smooth relaxed stroke with calm easy breathing. As you slowly get a better feel for the water it will start to bleed into your harder pace swimming.
Swimming,34t6rq,bzaks1424,1 point,Mon May 4 13:59:30 2015 UTC,"Being able to breathe every 4-6 strokes is very helpful. On my masters team, we do a drill where we swim 25m sets where we start at normal breathing pace and decrease by 1 breath each 25m till you try the whole 25m with no breath. It also helps with increasing speed as the last 25 usually results in a sprint!"
Swimming,34t6rq,ZapZip,1 point,Mon May 4 14:36:29 2015 UTC,"Random ideas:  Try 3 stroke breathing for awhile without kick turns.  When you add your kick turn, sneak in a 2nd breath before reaching the wall.  Swim full lengths underwater to improve your mental willpower.  If you're competitive, race against a buddy and you will be more inspired to breathe less.  Add other workouts to strengthen the body parts which tire most easily for you.  Increase the speed of your stroke to reduce time between breaths.  Don't tire your body out with other workouts before you get in the pool."
Swimming,34t6rq,soundkite,1 point,Tue May 5 03:21:16 2015 UTC,"I just got over this very problem! I found that it helped to focus on technique—when I breathed on one side and on every 2nd stroke my form was really lopsided, so my technique suffered, and I wasted more energy which made me lose breath faster. What I did was practice breathing on every 3rd stroke using the pull-buoy, that way I only focused on arm technique and turning my body, and I wasn't worrying about my legs taking up all the oxygen/energy. Eventually I worked up to removing the pull-buoy and now I can comfortably breathe on every 3rd stroke. Maybe try that to see if it helps you too :) Good luck!"
Swimming,34rzfg,mrvoltog,2,Mon May 4 01:32:59 2015 UTC,"A strong rip current can be bad news for even a strong swimmer.    The best option is to avoid, look for signs like a channel of foam and stuffs, or a disruption in the waves.   If you get caught don't fight it, swim parallel to the beach until you're out of it."
Swimming,34rzfg,revawfulsauce,1 point,Mon May 4 04:01:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply but it goes towards what I was saying; Education out there seems to be about rip currents and not the longshore current, which seems to be dangerous in itself."
Swimming,34rzfg,Galvanized_neoprene,2,Mon May 4 17:37:29 2015 UTC,"Longshore currents are generated by oblique incident waves, and will be present except in completely calm conditions. It will be present within the surf-zone, which is within the depth-limited-waves, i.e. with a significant wave height of 2m, the surf-zone is from 0 to 1.5m waterdepth (very approximate and dependent on a lot of other factors). Depending on the seabed grain size and wave climate, this zone can be anywhere from 50m to several km offshore. I have very limited OWS experience, but I'm a coastal protection engineer, and kayak, and my best bet at avoiding it is going further offshore."

Swimming,34qwh8,BitLion,6,Sun May 3 19:51:44 2015 UTC,http://www.swimsmooth.com/injury.php     I agree with the stuff I found there. Focusing on technique prevents injury.
Swimming,34qwh8,revawfulsauce,3,Sun May 3 19:57:29 2015 UTC,"This is great! Proper technique and listening to your body is what prevents injury. In high school I had some shoulder pain and my coach was very good at designing practices to help the injury, improve my form, and make my legs into noodles."
Swimming,34qwh8,murderhalfchub,7,Sun May 3 20:46:31 2015 UTC,"Hey man, dunno what anyone else posted on here, but as a lifelong competitive swimmer who's had shoulder issues in the past, I think I can help you out.  Obviously, good technique can prevent shoulder injuries, but sometimes it's just not enough. Specifically for me, the tons of yards on training trip caused my shoulder to tighten up a lot. It got to the point where I couldn't even take a stroke without excruciating pain. What the PT who was with us on the trip told me was that the rotator cuff muscles in my shoulder were ""glued"" together... She said this was because ""toxins"" were building up from sustained exertion, and once practice was over they were keeping the fibers together. To fix this, I got one of the most painful shoulder massages I've ever had. She focused on the area around my shoulder blades; there was a knot in the area that was contributing to the pain and ""clicking"" I was experiencing in the front of my shoulder.  For about 24 hours or so, my shoulder pain changed from a dull, nondescript pain to the pain you associate with microtears (the normal muscle soreness from exercise), and the next day it was all but gone.  So after this rant, hopefully you can take away that often times pain isn't caused by the exact location where it's felt, and that proper technique, warm down, stretching, and rolling out the soreness is essential! By keeping on top of these things, you can minimize the likelihood of shoulder injuries.  Hope that helps!"

If you do 2x200m kick (great leg workout) then multiple 100m or 200m crawl swims, finished by some solid sprints, you should be very sore after, at least thighs, pecs, back, tricpes. Maybe do a few breaststroke sets too for fun. :) Whatever you do, as long as you focus on proper technique and training hard, you'll be sore.

Did you feel super slow that first 50? I always go out fast, going a 25 on my first 50 and holding 28s, so its kinda strange to me. Have you thought about trying to take it out faster? If you can go a 52 in your 100, and a 5:16 in your 500, I think you can be sub 1:50 by next year. And I think its in your first 50. You can't be afraid to fail. People who are afraid to fail give up before they try it. That's just my advice. Good times though! You're about my speed in high school. Accept my 50 was faster, and your 500 is WAY faster.

Anyway my best 200s were the ones that I was consistent through the last 150. Practice being consistent. Save your legs for the 3rd 50 and really get them going that will help bring that 3rd 50 down.

Swimming,34ow9c,blumdrew,2,Sun May 3 16:26:29 2015 UTC,"Breathing to one side isn't necisarrily bad, I recently switched from breathing every 3 to every other and it improved my stroke a lot mostly by improving my rotation.  Breast role will take some pressure of the shoulders so I'd go ahead and do that. Also, utilize a kick board if your shoulders hurt. Improving legs strength and fitness can go a long way for your freestyle stroke"

Swimming,34nly4,Weird_in_Bed,2,Sat May 2 21:26:25 2015 UTC,"One suggestion on breathing patterns I have is to just do whatever is most comfortable.  I have had a few coaches over the years, some of whom would essentially force us to breath every three or five.  I breath every 4 then every 2 so that averages to once every 3 strokes, however my neck is most flexible to the right and it is just whats most comfortable for me.  Other coaches I have had did not really care and agreed to do whatever is easiest for you."

Swimming is associated with power - you'll see changes & improvements in your physique, but not significnt added weight / strength. Free weights / gym is the only way to achieve bulk / strength (or, at-least, what you seem to be describing)... 2-3 repitions of max. weight to exhaustion in 2-3 sets, twice a week, with a calorie excess.   The closest swimming can achieve is sprinting ... but this is still power orientated (see H.I.T  Personally, I'm only interested in power. Bulk / strength requires a lot of maintenance (it is lost as quickly as it's gained), and though both can be achieved, a lot of balancing between diet and 'rest days' cutting and blahblahblah ... it consumes people.

Swimming,34lsyi,yangYing,2,Sat May 2 16:13:58 2015 UTC,"Shoulder width is determined by bone structure. You can add bulk and definition to your shoulder muscles (your delts, particularly), and bulk and definition to your back (your lats) with crawl and back stroke, but the width / broadness of your shoulders is structural. Power training (e.g. swimming, or weight work ... 2-3 sets, 8-12 reps, 80% of max, 2-3 times a week with moderate rest) will increase definition and size, but 'gains' are only really available through strength / boby building.   Perhaps swimming can be your primary (for general fitness, muscle coordination, alignment ... etc) and you could do some isolated lifts into your delta, traps and late to add some 'broadness' / weight to your upper body. Most enthusiasts seek balance into the body (it's a mistake to concentrate on a single section of the physique) but if it's once a week, something to complement your swimming, there shouldn't be an issue. Weight / bulk training your shoulders can be achieved with a dumbbell set at home.  You might also checknout /r/fitness ... they have the facts on bulking, and what it means  You can't significantly increase muscle bulk with swimming alone."

I ended up with ""swimmer's shoulder,"" which morphed into upper spine issues, which increased migraines. My doctor told me to eat 25-35% of my calories in protein, and that helped my muscle recovery. Also, I learned to ""vary the routine;"" I walk in the current pool now instead of doing laps, and twice a week, we go to the gym for a light workout after the pool.

Swimming,34iayq,porsaskoski,3,Fri May 1 11:57:22 2015 UTC,"GEAR - as i and many people colloquially call it is important to achieving specific things.    paddles - good for building upper body strength. focus should be on pulling correctly and perpendicularly to the bottom of the pool. excessive paddle work can interrupt tempo, cause reliance on arms and shoulder problems fins - good for helping flick the feet out (ankle flexibility). They help carry the motion out of the body for dolphin kick and flutter kick. Also good for building strong muscles in the leg and core. fins however can again cause a reliance on fins to swim, can throw off tempo when removed by returning to a kick that is unable to support the body. focus should continue to be on finishing the flicking motion of the kick despite having this powerful aide to kicking snorkel - good for restricting breathing and providing constant sight on your stroke. through this you can build your aerobic base through working with less oxygen. you can also track head position and pull by having your head underwater the whole time. snorkels can be frustrating to learn how to use but I generally like them as a tool  kickboards - are good for developing a kick and learning certain things about kicking such as how to isolate kick to the lower body. Kickboards however can cause a bit of damage to stroke position due to the head usually being up. In response the hips sink and this can mess with body position. Focus should be on keeping the body long and on top of the water despite the natural desire to sink hips.  buoys - good for isolating the arms and supplementing paddles. Can also again teach certain things by restricting movement to upper body (such as moving arms in butterfly). However by inducing artificial buoyancy the stroke can again be affected so keep these in mind. Focus should rest on continuing to keep the core tight despite having this artificial buoyancy because it's easy to forget to do so.    -- other gear exists like turtle paddes, parachutes, buckets, tubes, bungies, counter weights tied to bodies, limb weights. but in most mesh bags the above are the most common things to find."
Swimming,34iayq,lolzerdidoodle,2,Sat May 2 03:23:33 2015 UTC,"The toys are there to force you to think about some part of your stroke, and then apply it later in the session. I.e. Swim with a pull buoy between your legs and work on shoulder-driven hip rotation. Really think about where you're placing your arms, your rotation and breaking, etc. then apply that to your stroke 5 minutes later. If you use the toys to just go through the motions you'll gain nothing."

Swimming,34iayq,D_Icedcoffee,2,Thu May 7 03:52:16 2015 UTC,"Yes. It is ideal to use toys for every workout for a bit of the session. My favorite is paddles and buoy because the buoy keeps your body afloat and balanced and so your technique with freestyle remains almost perfect because you don't have to worry about kicking. I recommend doing a kick set after warm up and before the main set, and do a pull set after the main set as a warm-down."
Swimming,34iayq,dominotw,2,Fri May 1 13:01:28 2015 UTC,Don't paddles and buoy's cause swimmers shoulder due to compromised form?
Swimming,34iayq,SwimSofa,3,Fri May 1 16:12:46 2015 UTC,"In my experience, it takes a lot training before using paddles and buoy is beneficial. When I take time off and come back it takes a while for my shoulders to get back to what I was capable of before. Size plays a big role here though. If they aren't too large you shouldn't encounter this"
Swimming,34iayq,deantoadblatt,1 point,Fri May 1 17:39:37 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you're working on and if you're in competition.   Buoys are used for pulling sets (when you only use your arms) to raise your hips. If you aren't kicking, your hips will sink, and the buoy helps to compensate for this.   Fins are useful for competition either to get a sense of what it feels like to go fast, work on breathe control on underwater kicks, or just to get in extra yardage.   Paddles: These can put a lot of pressure on your shoulders. I wouldn't recommend using these unless you've been swimming for while and have some experience (edit: otherwise you can tear up your shoulders). When I swam my coach had us use paddles to get a feel for how we were ""catching"" the water on our strokes. If you catch the water the wrong way with paddles, you can definitely tell. They also help you move a little faster on pull sets.  Out of competition, movement is movement. sometimes someone might not feel up to hitting a certain pace without assistance, so out come the fins. or their legs are shot, so out come the buoys."

I would for the first few days suggest just coming to terms with where you are, stamina, technique, muscle strength etc. Make sure to warm up and stretch your muscles (shoulders, arms, hamstrings and calves) before starting your session and also when you end. Eat banana and some protein after your session, muscle repair.   As for routine, I would suggest that you pick that up in your 2nd week. The side bar has a few beginner routine which can be slowly increased. And YouTube is a great place for vids.

I suggest you to begin to swim on mondays, wednesday and fridays and do some stretch on tuesday and thursdays for body recovery.   On swimming days, you must swim at a moderate speed. On the first week rest between every 1-2 laps UNTIL you are FULLY recovered, and then another 1-2 laps. DON'T do fly this week. Just swim and rotate as much as possible between the other three strokes so you rotate your working muscles. At the end of the session do some stretching exercises and eat well.  On the second week begin to lower your resting times and do the SAME amount of laps in every session. If you feel like you need to rest more, do not do it, just respect your resting time and swim slower. Continue rotating between the other 3 strokes and do not forget to do some kick board to rest your upper body.  On the third week you can begin to increase your training volume. Try to introduce some sprints (5 x 15's) to work your anaerobic endurance. Do not forget the stretching exercises.  On the fourth week you can begin to introduce some fly laps and a 4th day swimming day. Start to increase your overall training speed. On one day swim faster, on the other do a recovery session.  I would be more than happy to help you my friend. If you would like a great training program, I can make it for you. My email is dansplanes@gmail.com   Hope that helped!"

Swimming,34fo56,adscott1982,2,Fri May 1 01:20:26 2015 UTC,"What is the ""press""? I am a complete noob at breaststroke. I started swimming for fitness about a month ago, doing breaststroke pretty much exclusively. It has been interesting trying to refine my technique without any external guidance.  I think I have made some improvements, but I would benefit from understanding what the fuck the different terms mean in this article :)"
Swimming,34fo56,planet_x69,5,Fri May 1 09:28:50 2015 UTC,"Take everything written in this article with a large grain of salt. There are such varying styles that every other year there is a new article about whats faster for breaststroke. Bob your head, don't bob, ankles together and kick up, and then back again to kick and keep ankles wide.  From my POV, a great breaststroker simply has great rhythm of movement that allows them to keep their momentum moving forward at a high rate. I believe this what he rambles on about for multiple paragraphs when he talks about ""connectedness"". It's really just about the rhythm of the stroke.  edit: and to actually answer your question: the Press is the motion of the arms and elbows inward toward the chest before launching the arms forward during the arm motion."
Swimming,34fo56,jared0h,2,Fri May 1 15:05:07 2015 UTC,That's it. The techniques vary so drastically it is not even worth writing stuff like this.  Right now Peaty swam a ridiculous time and people naturally are overreacting. Come Olympics next year someone will throw down a sub 58 or 58 very low with him and there is every chance it will be a guy with a completely different technique.

Swimming,34fo56,balooDaBeast,1 point,Fri May 1 15:19:37 2015 UTC,"pretty interested in this, as i coach a masters team and have never been a competitional swimmer my self. What does he mean with the term ""connectedness""?"
Swimming,34fo56,planet_x69,1 point,Fri May 1 22:23:50 2015 UTC,"In short its rhythm. How well you time each part of your stroke and how strongly you carry out each part along with for how long you can maintain a steady and strong rhythm is what he means by ""connectedness"". Nobody I know calls it this, everyone I know calls it the rhythm.  Its all about technique and how fluid (rhythmic) it is and how long you can maintain it before beginning to suffer from muscle burn and lung burn.  For instance Kevin Cordes is able to start his 200 SCY and 100 SCY with a huge turns and a 3-4 stroke pull before hitting the wall. As he progresses however, he has to add 1-3 strokes per 25 off each wall as he breaks down. His strength may begin to wain but his rhythm remains intact allowing him to maintain momentum and speed."
Swimming,34fmj2,porsaskoski,9,Thu Apr 30 19:11:19 2015 UTC,"It's pretty unusual, but hey if that's your stroke you might as well embrace it!  It probably wouldn't stay that way if you spent equal time training both strokes but since you're swimming for fun that doesn't seem like an important factor.  An idea for passing people doing breaststroke: you could switch to a dolphin kick instead of the whip kick until you get around them to avoid kicking people. That's a good drill to practice fast hands and the correct rotation around the hips too!"
Swimming,34fmj2,chrom_ed,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:26:25 2015 UTC,"Great idea! Gives a new kick (pun intended? I dont't know) to my training variety.   By rotation, you mean vertical rotation? My freestyle rotation should be good, but I never bothered to analyze how I rotate in breaststroke, as it feels smooth. Altough, I know that my glide is too short - a swimming couch commented that I compensate that by my immense strength (yeah, I know it's not an actionable aid as such - just a comment to make me feel better about my swimming)."
Swimming,34fmj2,Banana23,4,Fri May 1 11:39:01 2015 UTC,"This.  This was me for sure. I did much shorter distances but I was generaly faster in breaststroke. Now, with that being said, its only acceptable if you want it to be. I LOVE breaststroke. The finesse that the form and timing takes over the typical ""imma kick and move my arms as fast as I can for freestyle"" mentality, it just flowed so much better to me. But I was always content with having a lesser freestyle.   So what are you doing wrong? Probably nothing, although for distance, especially 2km you should be doing a 6 beat kick, but again even that is up to you and personal preference. Its only acceptable if you want it to be, its your body, your skills, and swimming is an individual sport after all.   Tl;dr You probably just focus more on breaststroke and/or need to take less side breathes for freestyle. Its acceptable if thats who you want to be as a swimmer, otherwise get to freestyle training!"
Swimming,34fmj2,fatedplace,2,Thu Apr 30 19:26:25 2015 UTC,Thankyouthankyouthankyou this has been me forever and training 5k of freestyle a day with days where we sometimes do no breastroke at all is horrible... the only bad thing about breaststroke is all the knee injuries haha
Swimming,34fmj2,planet_x69,2,Thu Apr 30 19:51:50 2015 UTC,There's an Asian dude that swims in the next slower lane than me at my master's group that is like this. His freestyle is definitely slower than his breaststroke. His back kick and glide are just so smooth and powerful. He can't get that with his flutter kicks and his freestyle catch lacks power. He really hates buouy sets. Those are the worst for him. Lol.
Swimming,34fmj2,jared0h,2,Fri May 1 04:32:04 2015 UTC,"I am going to be the contrarian here and state that your breaststroke should never be faster than your freestyle.   If it is, then you simply aren't focusing on your freestyle form.  I am assuming you are swimming SCY.  Your pace for your 2K of straight breaststroke is 51sec per lap for 40 laps straight if finishing in 34 minutes.  Your pace for your 2k of straight free is 55.5 sec per lap for 40 laps straight if finishing in 37 minutes.  This tells me that you aren't really focusing on your form as much as you should  or think you are. I bettering you are letting your arms slip vs catching during the pull and are minimally kicking or more likely you are doing mini breaststroke kicks by turning your ankle (and lifting your foot up vs toes pointed to the rear) and bending at your knees when you kick.  But even if all that form stuff is wildly incorrect, your free should never be slower than your breast."
Swimming,34fmj2,jared0h,1 point,Fri May 1 15:41:13 2015 UTC,I broke 40 (LCM) in breaststroke before free and I broke 30 for the first time for both at the same meet. Some breaststrokers are just weird.  To be swimming freestyle slower over that sort of distance is pretty odd though.

I'll never be as good at playing bass guitar or Megaman 2 as I was when I was 15, and someone who has never played either would have a hard time taking it up compared to me doing it at the same time.   Sorry I'm rambling. Too much barley wine and it's past my bed time."
Swimming,34a4ae,OzSix,2,Sat May 2 06:26:24 2015 UTC,"First of all... barley wine?  wow... didn't know it even existed!  Just realize that those 10-14 yr old kids haven't even hit puberty yet.  Their bodies are light and all muscle... for their size/age they can swim extremely well if trained correctly...  But... they all don't go on to be Olympic gold winners ... and frankly many burn out from over training...   Guess the point is don't worry about them... yeah, you and I will never be as good as some 12 year olds are today... but all we can do is have fun trying our best (and hope they do too...)"
Swimming,34a4ae,billandteds69,3,Tue May 5 15:07:23 2015 UTC,"very very very new beginner here -- i was going through the same thing (minus the whole triathlon deal shudder).  I just wanted to get healthier but when i went to swim laps (lengths?) i would get down and back and feel like i had just been beaten and i started watching the people around me and realized that i had that 'thrown off the end of a dock' swim style, so i joined the beginner adult swim class at the Y and it has made a HUGE difference in my breathing, my stroke and even my kick.    So, TLDR, like everyone else on here has said, take a class, or get a coach, or somebody else to watch HOW you are moving through the water."
Swimming,34a4ae,cburtltop,2,Thu Apr 30 14:16:40 2015 UTC,"Can you have a friend record you swimming a lap or two? It's good to watch yourself and see how your form can be corrected. And of course, you can post it here. When I first started, my gym pool had mirrors which were so helpful to tightening up my form. Also, if there is someone who will swim with you to give you tips and keep you motivated, that's something worth trying to schedule."

Swimming,34a4ae,jamincan,2,Wed Apr 29 23:35:33 2015 UTC,"Swim instructor here.  It's difficult to critique your stroke without seeing it.  However, based on your description, I'd say that you are holding your head too high.  This causes your feet to sink which you try to counteract by kicking hard.  Also, many beginners have one speed, all out.  You need to slow things down that first 25 and pace yourself for the second 25.  For now, concentrate on form not speed.  Here are a few videos that may help. Freestyle - Adult Beginners:  https://youtu.be/OogkUMXxA6Q Freestyle Side-Breathing Drills:  https://youtu.be/tKNf-Rp7XYw Preparing Beginning Swimmers for Freestyle:  https://youtu.be/2XQy3pfniKk If these videos are too basic, there are a lot of good resources out there.

Swimming,34a4ae,wapz,1 point,Fri May 1 01:58:11 2015 UTC,"Coaching can help immensely, I can't emphasize that enough. If you can join up with a local masters swim team or a tri team, you'll definitely find it helpful.  As far as triathlons go, it sounds like you have a good grasp on the run and cycle, which is good. They say you can lose a triathlon in the swim, but you win it in the run or cycle, so you are well-positioned in that respect.  From the sounds of it, you are expending a lot of energy kicking. If you are swimming with a wetsuit, the kick is almost unnecessary as you will naturally float horizontally in the water. Your leg muscles use a tonne of oxygen but contribute relatively little to your propulsion. Most triathletes use a very light and slow kick to preserve their legs for the cycle and run, only picking up the kick a bit toward the end of the swim in order to warm up the muscles before leaving the water.  There are probably all sorts of things that you can do to improve your stroke, and have an experienced friend provide feedback, or a coach, would be invaluable to you. In the meantime, try using a pull buoy to see if that helps with the breathing. If you don't have them at your pool and don't want to invest in one (they're definitely worth it), focus on slowing down your kick. Maintain just enough to keep your bottom half floating, but no more. Instead, focus on your upper half; think about a nice, steady rolling motion, a good catch in the water, and efficient breathing (think about your head floating in the water the entire time, you shouldn't be lifting it)."
Swimming,34a4ae,wapz,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:54:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this is really helpful. We do have pull buoys at the pool, but I have read places to avoid them as a beginner. Since my legs use tons of oxygen and don' have the endurance I need yet in the pool, would that be a good idea, or would it simply be worth it to focus on form?"
Swimming,34a4ae,intangiblemango,2,Wed Apr 29 17:02:10 2015 UTC,"I think you have to be realistic on how much progress you can make between now and your first triathlon. If you are swimming three times a week and have coaching, you may very well see significant improvement; without external feedback, I think it would be very difficult to make progress just on your own.  If you will be in a wetsuit for your first triathlon, a pull buoy will actually better help you simulate race day conditions. A wetsuit meant for swimming should be very effective at holding your body horizontally in the water. The concern is that if you depend on a pull buoy too much, you never develop a proper body position in the first place. As always, balance is key and you have to consider what your training goals are. The pull buoy will help you swim longer sets, build greater endurance, and focus on the stroke (which is where most of your speed comes from) while simulating race conditions with a wetsuit. When you aren't using a pull buoy, focus on being as efficient as possible, which in your case will mean easing off on the kick for the time being."

Swimming,34b15r,YeahItsLL,6,Wed Apr 29 20:51:38 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say, without knowledge of the course.  Currents can be a real bear.  I'm no speedster, but I can maintain about 50 yards a minute for at least 1500 yards, and when I did a sprint last summer with a 1/4 mile swim, my time was a slightly-faster-than-expected 8:44 (probably thanks to my wetsuit); when I did an Oly race with a standard 1500m swim (which should take me about 33 minutes) it took me over 45 minutes because of the river's current.  It was brutal.  What you might do is go on the race's website and look for previous years' results.  The fastest swimmers in my local 800yd race average about 11 minutes from year to year, so about 12 minutes for a metric 800; if you notice that the fastest swimmers in your race last year were significantly slower or faster, adjust your expectations accordingly. (If you know you can swim 800m in a pool in about 18 minutes, but the fastest dude in 2014 managed it in 15 because of the conditions, you can safely expect to be over the 20 minute mark when you head towards T1.)  I would suggest focusing less on a specific time or pace than on how fast you can swim while maintaining good form and not feeling too winded; keep in mind you'll be riding and running after your swim is done, so it doesn't pay to blow yourself out in the first leg by trying to stick to a goal time.  If you feel yourself getting a little out of breath, or your swimming form is getting sloppy, slow down a bit."
Swimming,34b15r,ThatLeviathan,2,Wed Apr 29 20:01:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. One question - I just realized that the website doesn't specify 800m, it specifies a half mile. I automatically assumed that meant 800m because of my running background, but could it mean something different for swimming? (Thinking along the lines of 1760 yards is a running mile, but apparently 1650 is a swimmers mile).   The course is on a lake that I have heard is quite calm, so I don't think currents will play a big issue. As for the times, I checked out last year's race, and it seems that out of the nearly 350 participants,    9 finished the swim portion + first transition in the 10 minute range  10 were in the 11-minute range for that some portion 21 were in the 12-minute range 38 were in the 13-minute range 42 were in the 14-minute range (stopped counting after that)   Looking at the running times, I think I could be one of the top-10 runners in this race, maybe top-5, and almost as good with the biking, so I'd like to not be too far back when the swimming ends if I can help it. Seems like that would mean trying to get in the 12-minute range or so. Seems a little daunting, but I'll just keep working and see how things go."
Swimming,34b15r,jak_b_nimble,2,Wed Apr 29 20:38:17 2015 UTC,"They don't have perfect measurements for the swim, plus you won't be swimming perfectly straight. Don't get hung up on the distance because you'll swim more than required.  Couple things to keep in mind:  1) You're gonna be slower in open water than in the pool because you can't push off the wall in open water.   2) Swimming in the pack for the first time is...an experience.   It's your first tri. Don't worry too much about proving yourself, especially on your weaker areas. Just try to have fun with it."

Keep in mind, it's not worth pushing in the swim portion to try and be top-10 there if it causes you to bonk on the ride or the run.  The guy that wins the race is the guy with the lowest total time, no matter how fast his swim was.  The guy that won the 2014 edition of the sprint I'm doing next month was 28th out of the water.  (And the guy who came in 2nd was 28th on the run!)"
Swimming,34b15r,rhymeswithsymmetry,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:54:22 2015 UTC,"Swim and bike for show...run for dough. Make sure you've positioned yourself heading into T2 that you can run that 19 min 5K. If you've pushed to put yourself in position in the swimming and biking and then your legs are jelly heading into the run, you're going to have a bad time."
Swimming,34b15r,andytr32,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:22:40 2015 UTC,"This sums up my thoughts as well.  Don't preoccupy yourself with swim times.  In the bike and run, cranking it up at times cuts down on your overall time because they are the longer portions of the race.  The amount of energy required to cut 2 minutes off of your swim is much greater than the ammount to knock 2 minutes off of your bike or run time."
Swimming,34b15r,myCQI,3,Fri May 1 17:26:19 2015 UTC,"Hey,  That's a lot of background info! I did a sprint triathlon last April, swam a 16:14 800m, and ran a 24:12 5k. I swam twice a week for four months leading up to the race, but hadn't swum before that for a good 15 years. You seem more fit than me, and you're also much taller and younger than me (5'9"", 28 y/o). I bet you could do a 16:00 minute swim. (edit: every course will have slightly different distances and benchmark ""fast times"". For mine, 16:00 would have been top 15/70, but it seems like for your course 16:00 would be slower than you could do)  My advice:   Skip ahead a few weeks in the 0-1650, you can be doing more than 600m total per swim workout right now. (as the other comment said) During your swim workouts, focus on having a smooth, natural form and comfortable breathing. I felt a bit frantic during the triathlon swim and probably ended up wearing myself out unnecessarily with fast breathing and splashy swimming as a result.  Swim in open water twice (or more) before your event to get used to the feeling, and do a continuous 800m for those swims if you can. Don't wear yourself out on the swim in the actual race. As they say, you can lose a triathlon in the swim (if you wear yourself out in the first/shortest portion of the race), but you can't win it (because anybody can make up the gap in the bike and run if they saved much more energy than you)."
Swimming,34b15r,MrsSwimmer,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:44:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not quite sure what to expect from the swimming portion especially since I'm generally fit, but inexperienced with swimming beyond recreation.   Your fitness is EXCELLENT. What I would work on is repetition - get in the pool a lot since it's your weakest area. Get --and stay-- comfy in the water. And get that open water experience. There's nothing like it.   Rather than time, a good first tri goal might be to do your best and have a fun time. Then see where the improvement opportunities are with one or two under your belt."
Swimming,3498o5,surfer808,3,Wed Apr 29 08:45:51 2015 UTC,"Swam competitively in 70’s & 80’s and had to re-learn. The early vertical forearm catch is part of it. Also —  Balance: pushing down with your chest to keep your hips from dragging.  Head position: Looking forward with eyebrows at water level is all wrong now. You'll have to train yourself to look down. After a while, you can start looking forward again, but just a little.  Submerge yourself: You're not tryng to swim over the water anymore, because surface tension is a bitch. Don't be afraid to swim much more deeply than you did before.  Stay completely underwater as much as possible: Watch how young club swimmers or olympians do starts and turns.  Train your core: Propulsion comes from hip rotation. I haven't figured this out yet, but doing lots of core training and some shoulder external rotation exercises allows me to increase yardage without too much ice and ibuprofen. Also keeping your head down as mentioned above, instead of forward, helps prevent shoulder pain.  You'll find plenty more in books and videos. I had so much training to undo from years of yardage-above-everything coaching, that I thought it might help to shake things up even more by breathing to my unaccustomed side. It really did — a lot. I breathe to my ""new"" side now always, except for bilateral breathing drills, because it's my far more efficient, new stroke, broken-habit side."
Swimming,3498o5,iMatthew,2,Wed Apr 29 14:52:53 2015 UTC,"I started swimming in '88, and went on to a club team that focused on thousands and thousands of yards per practice over anything else. All of what you're saying is ringing true for me. I got back into the water last year and had to relearn pretty much everything with regards to my freestyle. My catch, my head position, my hip position, my kick (which I'm having the hardest part with - you used to be encouraged to do a 2-beat kick for distance), my underwaters... It's been a challenge, but a fun challenge!"
Swimming,3498o5,gertrudeblythe,2,Wed Apr 29 18:12:57 2015 UTC,"The amount of strokes is very personal. I shouldn't focus so much on trying to reach for the 11 strokes per lane. This can end up to be very inefficient for you. The number of strokes is indeed dependent on your technique, but also on other factors like arm strength, arm length, body position etc.   Its hard to comment on your technique. Try watching some videos about freestyle catch, maybe this helps. Otherwise try and ask a coach for some advise."

I really don't know what I was so afraid of.  I wish I had tried it sooner. It would have been a pretty nice event to add to my champioship meet list.

Most of us are accountable to coaches who are not on deck so we need some way to track our progress over time. We're also obsessed with metrics :P  What I find super helpful on mine (Garmin 920, in case anyone cares) is the ""repeat on"" feature which lets me more easily see my intervals time (e.g. 100s on the whatever). I suck at remembering when I start and without that, I used to forget how much rest I had.  Is it necessary to become a faster swimmer? Absolutely not. But it IS fun and does have some uses.  That said, this watch has nothing compelling for me. Either my Garmin can already do the feature or it's something I don't want."

The doctor said no swimming for 2 weeks and no ""jumping in the pool"" for an additional 2 weeks- I guess to avoid no abrupt water impact against your face. I don't compete frequently so I didn't dive for a few months. I probably didn't open my eyes under water for a couple months either, since I was always wearing goggles, otherwise I was back in the pool around week 3 (delayed due to laziness :) )  Apart from a month of being cautious, I don't think there will be any need to change your habits!

When I see my swimmers do it at practice, it seems like such an obsessive aspect of their workout that they forget to concentrate on the set, and certainly forget the finish at the wall.   However, I do like the swimsense because I can start and forget. I don't worry about the total yardage being exactly correct. What I do like it for is verifying my pacing, counting strokes, and a guesstimate on yardage in case I've got to get out early. The swimmo looks neat, but unless I can press and forget, I'm not gonna jack with it.   Technology can be good or bad; It all depends on how you use it."

Swimming alone isn't guaranteed to make you lose weight, you have to keep track of how many calories you're consuming in order to have your body expend more energy than you're putting into it. Some really great and helpful subreddits that you can check out with lots of helpful sidebar links are /r/loseit (their FAQ has pretty much everything), /r/eatcheapandhealthy (exactly what it sounds like haha), and /r/fatlogic (this one helped me the most in breaking through all the misconceptions I had about nutrition! Lots of jokes made about the common nutrition myths, but very very helpful in seeing just how crazy and harmful those myths are!), and of course googling ""tdee calculator"" will give you a good estimate of how much energy(measured in calories) your body expends every day just by existing, and the website MyFitnessPal can REALLY help walk you through how to have a nutritious and balanced diet while still eating the right amount of calories in order to lose weight!  I used to look like Lena Dunham too, but since I started getting serious about fixing my diet and laziness almost one year ago I can now confidently say that I look a LOT better than I did then and you will too if you put the effort in to change your lifestyle for the better and healthier :)   Oh yeah and speaking as someone who used to swim competitively when she was younger, 1-2 hours a week of light breaststroke(which can hurt your knees if done too much and/or with bad form btw) will not make you look like the Hulk. Like, you'd have to take steroids and swim while carrying heavy weights or something silly like that for that to happen. Looking like Arnold Schwarzenegger is not something that just accidentally happens, and girls biologically just can't even build muscle in the same way that guys can so you really have nothing to worry about in terms of being ""bulky"" :) Swimming is a really fun and joint-friendly exercise(with the possible exeption of poor breast-stroke form...) and I really hope you enjoy it and it helps you on your path to health!   Sorry for the wall of information I just threw at you, but I hope you can at least get something useful out of this :)"
Swimming,342z6a,betabirdy,4,Tue Apr 28 05:55:39 2015 UTC,"Swimming won't make you huge, but too much breaststroke can be bad for your knees and swimming does tend to make people very hungry. I wouldn't advise swimming a considerable distance of only breaststroke, and make sure swimming isn't making you eat too much as maintaining a calorie deficit is the most important part of losing weight."
Swimming,342z6a,lodlob,3,Mon Apr 27 23:54:20 2015 UTC,"Any exercise is good for cardiovascular health and your long-term well being, and if you find something you enjoy, it's easy to stick at it and very much worth doing.  But exercise is not key to losing weight, your diet is - if you eat less than you need you will lose weight whether you exercise or not. As people have suggested here swimming may make you hungrier.  I started swimming daily to lose weight 4 years ago; I lost a lot initially, but progress slowed (I even put fat back on) because I paid no attention to my diet. There's a great FAQ over at r/fitness where you can learn about TDEE and deficits and other such stuff which is crucial to proper fat loss. Good luck!"
Swimming,342z6a,Danwold,3,Tue Apr 28 06:03:54 2015 UTC,"Swimming will help tone, but it is not very great for losing weight.

Swimming,342z6a,12beatkick,7,Tue Apr 28 00:20:35 2015 UTC,"This. All exercise will help you lose weight, and swimming is easier on your joints than most dry land sports, but if you're looking to burn calories/weight fast, running is a better option than swimming."
Swimming,342z6a,hawkssb04,2,Tue Apr 28 01:25:34 2015 UTC,"Swimming has helped me lost 25 lbs over the course of 9 months - along with proper diet and a small bit of cycling.  I'm an early 30s dude though.  I swim 4 times a week, usually about 15-30 minutes of crawl with a once a week 1 hour swim in."
Swimming,342z6a,wvoquine,2,Tue Apr 28 00:18:43 2015 UTC,"It's taken me about 10 months to lose 26 pounds, not fast but I learned some simple things along the way:  Swimming is the only exercise I've ever loved and been able to keep up.  That is the main reason I keep doing it day in, day out.  I truly love getting into the pool and the better I get with my technique or my times, the better I feel.  If I take a couple of days or even a week off, I miss it and love the first time back in the pool.    Swimming doesn't burn a whole lot of calories until you start playing around with longer or more intense swims.  My main swim right now is a comfortable 3000m in about an hour.  For the first 2 months of my weight loss journey, I played around more than followed a program and had very uneven weight loss success.  I'd say a 30 minute swim is the minimum to burn enough calories to affect weight loss.  The type of swim has an effect on my weight loss in a particular week.  I found the most weight loss when I did HIIT pyramid sets.  It shouldn't matter whether you do breast stroke, freestyle or backstroke, the point of HIIT is to swim short distances with very short rest periods at a high intensity.  My go to set for this was 400m warm up slow, main set: 25m, 50m, 75m, 100m, 75m, 50m, 25m; 3 Sets of this; rest 10-15 seconds between distances and around 30 seconds between sets. 200m cool down.     Everyone is right that diet is the most important part, you must be eating a calorie deficit and without tracking it, you will be inconsistent with weight loss.  That is the main reason why it took 10 months to lose 25 pounds instead of 6 for me, I don't count calories (mostly just lazy to) and therefore eat inconsistently week to week, mostly at a deficit but often not.  Swim watches helped me a lot, they helped track my swims over time and it became fun to collect them and helps me push myself towards whatever goal I've got (my current goal is to get down to a 1:00 minute 100m freestyle). I have the Garmin Swim and love it so much, when I lost it a couple of months ago, I bought another 4 days later because it had become so ingrained in my swim lifestyle.   You will not get big when eating at a calorie deficit.  You will probably gain some muscle in the first couple of months but soon you'll wish you were getting stronger faster than you are.  The only way you'll get big is if you don't track your diet and end up eating at a surplus, but even then, you won't build huge muscles swimming.  If you like swimming, you can use it to help yourself lose weight if you also count your calories and stick to a calorie deficit. I'm about 3 weeks of swimming away from my goal of losing 30 pounds, I feel stronger, happier, I sleep easier, I look slimmer and I'm in control.  Just keep swimming!"
Swimming,342z6a,adchrom,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:31:05 2015 UTC,15-30 mins is definitely not enough for losing weight. You need long (45-60+ mins) and easy (22-24 heart beats per 10 sec) workouts. And I think this won't make your muscles big. A diet is also strongly required.
Swimming,342z6a,lostcpacket,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:36:03 2015 UTC,"I've been swimming for 3 and a half weeks and I have lost 4.2kgs (9.2lbs). I am 33 year old man and weigh 103.8 kg.  To be honest I'm not burning that many calories (~300 for half hour of breast stroke). However it is not as arduous as being on the treadmill or other forms of high intensity cardio. I look forward to my swim each morning, amazingly, whereas before I would dread getting on the treadmill as I always made it hard for myself by running too fast.   The real reason I have been losing weight is using MyFitnessPal to count my calories.  I am budgeted about 1500 a day. Doing the swim each morning gives me an extra 300 calories to eat. Every time I have tried to lose weight I have assumed that if I exercised hard enough I could maintain my unhealthy diet. It was no fun at all, and I always failed. This time things are looking up because none of it is particularly difficult.  The first few days were tough but my body has got used to fewer calories. The weight is dropping off.  With regard to muscle growth, I think you will get toned up, drop fat, but not grow much in size, unless you go really really intense. It's only been three weeks for me. My muscles haven't grown but they are harder.   TL/DR: Yes swimming is good and I do essentially the same as what you are planning. However ensure you watch your calories as the most important thing. I highly recommend MyFitnessPal."

And after lurking a lot on r/swimming and watching videos, i opted to take beginner lessons at the Y so i could swim properly and 1. not hurt myself and 2. be more efficient to get a better work out.    I also picked up the myfitnesspal app and for the last two months have kept my calories at 1200-ish.

Swimming,342z6a,OzSix,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:44:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the advice! I will try calorie counting but the whole idea sounds tedious to me, I do notice that I am a snacker.

I tend to forget about entering my food onto FitnessPal after trying it a few weeks sometime ago."
Swimming,342z6a,_doob_,1 point,Fri May 1 08:47:23 2015 UTC,"Almonds are extremely calorie dense. While they're healthy, you shouldn't be having more than a (small) handful of unroasted, unsalted, unflavoured ones per day (since the calories add up quickly).  Calorie counting may sound tedious but it is useful for a reason. It teaches people who've learned how to eat too much how to unlearn that (bad) habit. And yes, it is learned behaviour. Weigh all your foods, don't eyeball anything. It sucks but it's the way things work. Or else you'll be wondering why you aren't losing weight and give up. Nothing works like the numbers do.  Learn the sensation of actual hunger. Wait and put off eating until you can actually feel your stomach getting hungry, not the idea of a pleasant mouth crunching stuff. That's just psychological, and you can beat that addiction.   Tips for the food: Drink plenty of water - a lot of people mistake thirst for hunger. If you want to snack, snack on a lightly salted cucumber, or a couple of carrot sticks, or steam a few green beans and cauliflower in salt water and have them during the day. Raw peppers, if that's your thing. No dressing, but you can squeeze half a lemon on top and add some pepper to all these. Fill up with veggies - they go a long way without adding too many calories.  I'm sorry to say this, but you don't sound very motivated to lose weight. There's no point lying to yourself; if you haven't made the attempt in good faith, nobody's any the worse off but yourself. If you don't want to do it, don't do it, nobody faces the consequences but you either. Of course, the flip side is that if you do do it, you're the one getting all the benefits too. Choose your destiny."

If you're trying to qualify for nationals, then by all means research whatever high end tech suits and buy the best.  But otherwise, really, there's no effective difference, except the price tag. Because the difference between each year's iteration of tech suits is about the same improvement you see in a Nike shoe. It's redesigned, maybe looks cooler, maybe a couple grams lighter, but really, it's 30-40% more expensive, and that's it.  Personally, going for a Nationals cut is the absolute baseline in my honest opinion for when your choice of suit makes any real difference, and even then, it's not by much. Buy another carbon pro if you see on for sale, it should do you just fine."

Swimming,340qel,SteelCityRunner,2,Mon Apr 27 16:55:28 2015 UTC,"Expecting to maintain your fastest 100 time is ridiculous. Again, this isn't meant to sound harsh or mean, but athletic training is not an exact science. There is no X = Y equation, if there was, there would be no point to competing. Everyone would do the same thing, go the same speed, and get the same results.  Your performance is going to fluctuate MASSIVELY over the course of a season. Elite swimmers don't try to hold their best times for 10x100s free. It's (generally (distance swimmers may simply hold a fast pace or lack fast twitch muscle)) not possible.  As for not being able to ""take it anymore"", I'm assuming this has to do with fatigue. The only way to get better at swimming, hell anything, is to do something you haven't done before. In swimming, this means being more technically efficient, stronger, or both. To get stronger in the water you can either increase how fast you do something, how much you do of something, or how much power you can apply to the water (lift weights, gain more leverage through technical adjustments). To improve your technique, do drills and work with a coach on stroke correction.  There's nothing wrong with you. Stop complaining the second things don't go perfectly and fight to keep going. Don't start at a dead sprint when you're doing a pacing set. 10x100 is definitely an aerobic/anaerobic threshold set. Pick a time, like 1:50 that /u/Saaen24 suggested, and hold that time. Period. If someone kicks you in the face, keep going. If you choke on water, keep going. If you miss a wall, keep going. There should be no situation in which you miss that time, but you also shouldn't try to pass that time by sprinting and then dying off at the end.  tl;dr: 10x100 isn't a sprint, you're not going to go your best time every single practice, sack up"

Swimming,340qel,jirv,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:08:29 2015 UTC,"Sounds to me like it is both mental and unwise swimming. If you continue to think that you are swimming slow, then you will swim slow. Also, if your fastest time is 1:38, you shouldn't expect yourself to hold 1:38-1:40 throughout the set, instead, start on the 1:50 base and hold it for several sets, if you can hold it well, try to descend it! Don't take out a set too fast or you will be dead for the rest of practice, but also don't take it out to slow (so that would be like the 2:05 base) or else you won't be helping yourself."
Swimming,340qel,Saaen24,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:45:08 2015 UTC,"If you are stoping because you feel that your heart and your lungs are being stressed too much then you obviously need to swim slower. Respect the resting time, but just swim at a more comfortable pace. Remember: Not very demanding nor too easy. Remember that you will build your endurance faster by going slow and at your own phase. Specially in swimming, you must go at your own phase. You will see that by swimming at 2 minutes every 100 and only resting 30 seconds, in 2-3 weeks you will be able to swim at 1:53-1:54 super easily.   If you are stopping because your muscles are burning, then take 2-3 days off and do 1 hour of stretching to recover your muscles daily. You will be a machine in your return to the pool. Again, in your return go easy and do not overtrain."
Swimming,3413w2,capitanxx,2,Mon Apr 27 14:01:06 2015 UTC,"The size of a muscle does not represent it's strength necessarily. I have seen very thin swimmers that have a huge strength and very muscled swimmers that can only lift small weights. Personally I enter in the second category. Thanks to swimming, I have a bigger chest than many people who lift a lot of heavy weights in the gym. Of course, they are stronger than me, but I have a bigger chest.  From what you say, you have a small chest and you also lift small weights with your chest. When you do the chest press do you lift small weight because your chest gets tired or because your triceps get tired first? It is important to note that difference because triceps are used a lot in swimming.   Try to do a superset of inclined bench press with dumb bells and pushups with your feet supported on a bench. Then do another super set of chest dips and your regular presses. Do them 3 x 15 reps. Rest between 45 seconds and 1 minute between each super set.   Do not worry too much about your size. Strength comes naturally by working the muscle, so do not get frustrated if you currently lift less weight than others. You will surpass them with patience, but more importantly you will improve yourself every day.  Remember also that when it comes to swimming appropriate technique radically shatters stronger guys."
Swimming,3413w2,Dansplanes,0,Mon Apr 27 16:38:55 2015 UTC,"If you are looking for areas that target the chest go over to /r/fitness and you can find some chest routines/excercises. Make sure when you do them though you use a metabolic set/rep scheme. For example 3 sets of 20, Bench Press, with 15-30 seconds rest."

Swimming,33zegy,TheGreatCthulhu,2,Mon Apr 27 06:07:44 2015 UTC,"I'm a triathlete and am still relatively new to swimming. I started swimming in August last year and didn't have much time in the open water before needing to retire to the pool.  That said, I follow DCRainmaker's blog and a while ago he posted this review where he mentions that some people have been successful in putting their gps watch/phone in it and getting their tracks. Personally, I'm not sure if I'd trust bringing my phone anywhere near the water, but that'd probably be one of the cheapest options for you.   Apart from that, you could get a gps watch (Garmin Forerunner 910xt is an older gen but has solid OWS capabilities, last i checked the 2nd hand market had quite a bit of these floating around for relatively cheap since the 920xt was released in November). I current don't have a watch for OWS swimming so instead I use either my garmin Forerunner 220 in my swim cap or I just forego all watches/electronics and just swim. The pond that I train in is 400 yds when you swim around it and is 50 yds long on one of the stretches if I just want to go back and forth. Either way, I  know the distance so I don't feel the need to track each swim other than the time."

Swimming,33zgmv,throwawayb1tch,3,Mon Apr 27 02:08:23 2015 UTC,"Times can be improved with a lot of different factors. My favourite being technique. This sport is a very technical one. No matter how hard you train, how much you train or how much effort you put in every training. The most probable thing is that if someone has a better technique, he will have the best times.   If you improve your technique, you will be able to swim with less energy so your body will recover faster from every training leaving you stronger for the competitions.  When I swam in competition I stayed in the pool after the training session just to practice every single detail of my stroke, kick, turns, starts. Those corrections will definitely bring your swimming times to where you want them. Talk with your coach and ask him for feedback on your technique and what you can do to improve it.   One day at a time, you will improve your technique and your times will automatically improve. Even olympic swimmers always work on improving their technique. It is a never ending process. Let me know what you think!"
Swimming,33zgmv,Dansplanes,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:36:13 2015 UTC,Hey thanks for the advice! Over the summer I will focus on technique and definitely be talking to my coach more. One of might biggest flaws is hip movement and I want to make that my primary focus while training technique.

I would go with the highest proof rubbing alcohol you can find but at this point it's still something for your immune system to take care of.  If you can't get rubbing alcohol you can use Everclear, but lower proof liquor has too much other stuff in it to use safely. Sleep with that ear down so it can drain.  Hopefully your not the type to suffer too much. Personally I do rubbing alcohol after every swim.   If it gets bad look into the ExPat community, Americans who are working for companies in Cambodia.  They are tight knit and can point you to just about anything (including a western doctor)  mabey: http://cambodiaexpatsonline.com/  American or British embassy might also be able to point you in the right direction.

Swimming,33w5yc,SnareDevil,8,Sun Apr 26 05:10:07 2015 UTC,"I learned to swim as an adult. But it wasn't until two years after my first swim lesson that I began to get it. All thanks to my coach, but I've lost +50 lbs. in the past 10 1/2 months alone. I've gone from being frighteningly obese to being now merely 9 lbs. away from my ideal weight (according to those BMI calculators online, anyway). I feel like I've gotten a second chance in life.  I'm still the slowest out of everyone in the pool at any given time (it takes me 1:05-1:15 to swim a mere 50 yds. / ~45 minutes to swim 1650 yds.), but it's everything to me: my daily de-stressor, confidence builder, cardio, and strength training.  To be able to do something I've always wanted to since childhood--and couldn't until now--and then to find small successes along the way has given me a renewed confidence in my abilities and a sense of pride in my appearance and accomplishments.  I'm in the best shape of my life, and I don't plan on ever going back to being the miserable, depressed, hopeless person I was.  This is what swimming has done for me."
Swimming,33w5yc,Purple-Mounted,7,Sun Apr 26 11:45:25 2015 UTC,"I started swimming when I was a kid (4 years old).  There are just so many facets of my life affected both directly and indirectly by swimming is insane.  I'll list some that are important to me: Self discipline, humility, mental toughness (let's face it swimming is like the hardest sport ever), I'm super healthy, eating EVERYTHING, and last but not least, having an instant connection to anyone who tells you they are/were a swimmer. It's like being a marine, once a swimmer always a swimmer.  Knowing that someone else has also been through the meat grinder of daily 6-8 thousand yard practices just immediately enforces respect and tells you a lot about their character. It is also my favorite method of meditating and clearing my mind."
Swimming,33w5yc,Weird_in_Bed,5,Sun Apr 26 13:42:41 2015 UTC,"I started 9 months ago to lose weight. I went down from 170 kg to 145 in this period. The first day I went I swam in the old people lanes and I got tired after 250 m. I started increasing the times I went to the pool to 3 times a week and 4 in the summer. After a while I heared of a outdoor swim of 2000 m and decided I wanted to be able to do that. So i kept pushing until I actually swam 2k on a cold winterevening, that was a milestone even though it took me 1,5 hour to do. After this I kept going and trying to improve my times and now I swim about 2k-2,5k an hour 3-4 times a week. Swimming has improved my health dramatically. I am now training to do the swimming part of a group triathlon which is also 2,5k but outdoors and I actually feel confident I can do this.   Besides the health part swimming also improved my social life and skills. Being a regular in the pool means people start talking to me, complimenting me on what I am doing and the progress and now I have some regulars I swim with. I also seem more attractive to women and they come up to me on their own which never happened before and I am actually thinking of asking one of those girls out for a drink.   So how has swimming changed my life? In every possible way."

Swimming,33w5yc,rollingintheshallow,3,Sun Apr 26 15:24:11 2015 UTC,"I had a funny start to swimming actually. I was about nine, and I was going through a growth spurt that was giving me lots of pain in my legs. On top of that, I injured my knee while wrestling with some friends at school. Some gentle sports were recommend for me as a kind of physiotherapy. That started out as a dance class because my mom was good friends with the instructor and I was already stuck tagging along sitting there while my sister danced. I wasn't the only boy, there were four of us, and I'll admit it wasn't so bad, I was pretty infatuated with the instructor, so that helped. The fear of my friends finding out felt like a death sentence though, so I didn't do that for long.  A couple friends had recently started with the local swim team, so I switched over to that. I wasn't thrilled about the speedos at first, but it was a good trade for tap shoes! All my close friends were in swimming before long, so my shyness subsided pretty quickly.  I still swim. It's been a good fall back as I moved around for work and school. As long as there is a pool nearby I can go de-stress and workout, I don't have to have company like many other sports. Getting back into it as an adult has gotten me in way better shape. I was very scrawny before hand, maybe even underweight. The motivation to improve got me eating right and building muscle. It also improved my focus in school and connected me with the community. I credit it with getting out of the listless funk I was in back then.   Now I'm trying to make more out of swimming. I want to start competing in masters meets and I've got some lakes picked out to swim across when they warm up. I think about triathlon, but that knee that bothered me as a kid still sucks, so running long distances is a chore. We'll see though. The best part about swimming is that I don't really ever have to stop. When I'm an old fart you'll still find me swimming laps at the pool."
Swimming,33w5yc,High_Tower,2,Sun Apr 26 16:36:28 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie - my rekindled interest in swimming this year started when I watched Free!, an anime about high school swimmers. It takes all kinds, huh?  On a more serious note, what got me to stick with it after the first day, aside from it being really fun, was the realization of ""Wow, I'm terrible at this. What would happen if I fell in the ocean?"". After I swam my first nonstop lap, I started thinking, ""What would happen if someone else fell in the ocean?"".   I swim because I want to have the passion and joy that I saw in the characters in the show, and also so I can someday be strong enough to save myself or someone else if there's ever a need. I'm still slow and have bad stamina, but I get a tiny bit better every day."

Thus I started swimming about 7 months ago - no need to organize anybody just need to be serious on your own. Besides I always wanted to learn how to swim, by this time I was barely able to hold for some time above the water or move few meters.  Found a place, got a coach and started with 2 times a week, but quickly upped that to 3. 3 months later - 4 times a week, I just fell in love with swimming. Maybe that I lost another 20kg with swimming and I'm feeling great - no more overweight, good shape, good health helps with that love?:) Now I am looking forward to every training and I'm very excited (fly here I come to learn the shit out of you:P). Always helps me to release the pressure from work (I swim after work Mon/Wed/Fri and Sat morning).

Swimming,33w1yl,Tyler77i,1 point,Sun Apr 26 04:30:13 2015 UTC,"There is a certain mental outlook you have to take as athlete when training kicking, or endurance training in general. You're trying to find a bittersweet spot, where your legs hurt, but not hurt so much that you can't complete the set. If you're gassing out or cramping mid-set, you're going too hard. Find a medium to medium-high pace. It will hurt, its supposed to. You maybe slower then your group; that's fine, everyone has to start somewhere. Go as hard as you can handle for the entire duration of the set. Once you're able to complete a challenging set, increase the difficulty of the set each day or week. That's how you improve kicking. Its really a simple process, but one without shortcuts. To successfully complete the process, your brain has to understand and embrace pain. Pain is in fact the feeling you are going after and getting yourself familiar with during these kind of sets."

I am awful at kick, so I decided to work on it a bit by doing timed kicking sets. I haven't done a lot, but I'm timing myself so I can get my best 25, 50, 75, and 100 kick time. And from now on, when I do a timed kick set, I know what to shoot for. Find your best times, and try to beat them. Be happy with practice personal bests, because they are important! And if your coach doesn't have you do timed kick, try to see how many 25s or 50s or whatever you can do holding the same time. Treat your kick like it matters! Race yourself."

No tool, coach, or anything is going to help you more than your own head will. Start small, and be honest with yourself. Start by making yourself do 3 kicks underwater off every single wall, warmup and warmdown included. Do that until it's comfortable, then add a kick.  Second: get a snorkel. Not the ocean diving kind, a front facing one. They have small airways, and make it harder breathe. Use it during warmup and during pull sets, it also helps focus on your rotation.

Swimming,33tm4z,Rancis_Fluggerbutter,9,Sat Apr 25 14:42:22 2015 UTC,"Well if you have been swimming since July that's a good start.  -When you swim make sure you take nice long arm strokes -Make sure you point your toes away from you when you kick -When doing the backstroke try to find a comfortable number of strokes to take between the flags and wall -Make sure when you do butterfly to do two kicks instead of one -Remember to drink, eat and sleep well during the tryouts I have confidence that you will do well and tell us if you make it or not."
Swimming,33tm4z,SnareDevil,4,Sat Apr 25 15:29:57 2015 UTC,"don't breathe every stroke - especially butterfly. when I do the butterfly, it feels a lot better to breathe every stroke - for the first lap. Just come up with a breathing patter.  For freestyle I do stroke stroke stroke stroke/breathe stroke stroke/breate and for butterfly I do stroke stroke/breathe stroke/breathe."
Swimming,33tm4z,chris_ryan2,2,Sat Apr 25 15:52:33 2015 UTC,"(Please excuse my english, I'm not good at english)  Dude I was in the same situation as you a few months ago and I really know how you feel. Really. I am now 17 but I was 16 as well when I was in your situation.   It was my first attempt on a swim team. I did have life-guarding experience from the past but it isn't intense. On November 2014 when I tried out, I got 36 seconds on my 50m freestyle, 39 seconds on my 50m breaststroke. It was the first time someone timed me. I didn't know if that was good or not because I didn't know what other people got and so I researched online. I saw a lot of 25-29 seconds at our age. I sucked, but I was lucky because that year the school team was low in numbers and they had no choice.  Throughout this experience I improved my freestyle time from 36 seconds to 32.1.  I changed my diet. Whenever there was a celebration or some special occasion like birthday's I learned to say no to any unnecessary sweets. I started eating two apples, a banana, a few grapes and a lot of vegetables every day. It really helped me develop self control and when you eat healthier you will be naturally happy most of the time.  Advice that I can give you is have fun and sacrifice if you wanna be better. I already mentioned my diet. Eat healthy it will significantly help your mental and physical health. Do some workouts if you can. I did push-ups, dumbbell excercises, ab workouts etc. Most importantly GO TO THE POOL. The more you swim the better. I dont know how many practices you have per week but try to go as much as you can if you wanna be better. I'm currently taking a break swimming only once a week because the season is over and I can really tell how much swimming 3 times of week is way better than once a week. The best way to be a faster swimmer if to swim. Not run, not weights... they may help but swimming in a pool is the best.  In terms of mental state... learn to love that feeling of adrenaline when you go for a race. When I first started out I was scared like you but, if you just keep racing your teammates you will get used to it. Even if they crush you, set your teammates as standards before you think about the whole scene.  Just have fun man. It's gonna be a good experience.  (If you workout enough, you can get a sexy body too lol)"
Swimming,33tm4z,owner_of_steam,2,Sat Apr 25 18:16:40 2015 UTC,"If the coach can tell you have a very good work ethic, he'll most likely pick you over someone who doesn't eben if they are faster. It shows that you're willing to work with this team and become an even betterms swimmer no matter what. Just make sure you work hard everyday and try as hard as you can."
Swimming,33tm4z,PSG10,1 point,Sat Apr 25 20:10:56 2015 UTC,I think the hardest thing about swimming is anxiety. The best thing you can do is just relax slowly focus on your technique until you get better. No matter how weak you are good technique will put you way at the top. Try investing in a snorkel that way you can focus on swimming freestyle without having to worry about a breathing pattern (They're pretty cheap around $10-20 for the low end ones). Relax and don't thrash in the water a fluid stroke is so much more efficient.
Swimming,33tm4z,soy_leche,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:27:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly, go to a nearby pool and do a workout as often as possible. Do a 200 free, 200 kick w/kick board, 200 IM, 200 pull, 200 free. Only 1000 yards but it'll at least get you prepared. Do that 3/4 times a week for a month and you'll be just fine."
Swimming,33tm4z,RiggityRow,1 point,Sat Apr 25 21:52:52 2015 UTC,"Mental Preparation is key. Usually, I would do some of my reading in the morning before practice so that I would have something to think about during distance sets.  Focus on form, not speed! If you learn how to swim fast, but wrong, you will be in a world of frustration."
Swimming,33u0iw,porsaskoski,6,Sat Apr 25 16:53:42 2015 UTC,I overtrained this past season. I do Butterfly and Freestyle mostly and halfway through the season my shoulder started to quit on me. It almost made me unable to swim Butterfly without extreme pain. I then talked with my coach who changed my workouts to be less stressful on my shoulders. I finished my season strong and I'm fine now.
Swimming,33u0iw,SnareDevil,2,Sat Apr 25 21:27:34 2015 UTC,"This!  I am not competitive any longer, same as porsakoski, but last summer I swam 5k/day everyday of freestyle no stops just hopped in and swam 5k.  By the end of summer my shoulder was quite inflamed, been recovering ever since, mostly kicking and doing breast stroke.  Feeling pretty good again almost at 100% but i feel the pain."
Swimming,33u0iw,Weird_in_Bed,1 point,Sun Apr 26 02:09:43 2015 UTC,"When my heartbeats get higher I usually take some drugs containing potassium and magnesium. Actually potassium is required, magnesium just helps to deliver it better. When you train hardly for a long time you sweat and lose potassium so your heart rate gets higher. So may be you should consult you coach or doctor."
Swimming,33qec9,DWIGHT01,14,Fri Apr 24 17:29:53 2015 UTC,"I mean no disrespect to Arizona State, but I don't understand Bowman's move here.  He's going from NBAC CEO to Head Coach of a swimming and diving program that frankly been terrible for quite awhile now. ASU must be paying a hefty price to get Bowman out of NBAC. I saw rumors of this last week, but didn't think there was any merit to it.  Now he has to answer to his AD, has to recruit and deal with all the stuff that he had to deal with at Michigan. Why would he want to give up his power as CEO just to take over at a relatively poor program? He's already coached the greatest swimmer and Olympic athlete in history so it's not like he has something to prove... does he?  Not to mention we're roughly 14 months out of Trials, it seems like such an inopportune time. If it was September 2016 I could understand the move, but not now.  I just don't see how this benefits Bowman other than moving to warm Arizona over cold Baltimore. It's not like he'd have difficulty getting recruits to build ASU into a PAC-12 contender, I just don't understand why he'd want to do it in the first place. And going into an Olympic year, his focus can't be on his college swimmers, it has to be on his post-grads.  It just doesn't make sense to me. It's a backwards move."
Swimming,33qec9,MysicPlato,6,Fri Apr 24 17:48:05 2015 UTC,"I think it might be as simple as he wants somewhere warm to coach.   Legacy is a possibility, but even with him at the helm ASU would be at least 3 years out of being a top 10 contender; and having to recruit against USC, Cal and Arizona would make recruiting on the West Coast harder than just saying ""I coached Phelps, you know you're coming to swim for me.""  I think Bowman is a better club coach than college coach. He benefits from complete control of his surroundings; you don't have that kind of control in college as you do as a CEO coach in club. I'm sure his NBAC post-grads would be more than happy to follow him to AZ and train there over staying at NBAC, but it's just a weird move in my eyes."
Swimming,33qec9,MysicPlato,0,Fri Apr 24 18:56:58 2015 UTC,"It's kind of like what Salo tried at USC, although neither program has been spectacular."
Swimming,33qec9,anoldoldw00denship,3,Fri Apr 24 20:03:34 2015 UTC,"Easy: Tempe is close enough, in terms of conditions, as Rio. He needs a warm climate with an outdoor pool for his post-grad group to train. He said in his press conference that he'd be ""wearing two hats,"" so he is still focusing on his post-grad group. So while I doubt he would publicly say this is the reason, its probably for Phelps and the rest of the Olympians that train with him."
Swimming,33qec9,lrdchaos3,2,Fri Apr 24 21:03:18 2015 UTC,What makes you think he won't still be the CEO at NBAC? We don't know all of the details and he very well can still do both. Just like Dave Salo owns Irvine Novaquatics and coaches at USC. As a college head coach he can recruit without having to deal with club recruiting policies and he can attract swimmers to a warmer swimming environment.
Swimming,33qec9,MysicPlato,2,Fri Apr 24 20:54:33 2015 UTC,"The Salo situation is a little bit different since Salo is still based out of Southern Cal. Bowman would be a CEO of a team literally halfway across the country. I know when Salo first took the USC job he was still running Irvine staff meetings. I'm not saying Bowman couldn't do both, but it would be harder.  He'd have no problem getting more elite postgrads to train with their squad, but he still has to recruit high school kids for ASU, and he's still recruiting in the hyper-competitive PAC-12.  Obviously there are plenty of college coaches who coach their college team and a postgrad group, that's not an issue. It's just for Bowman to start now, so close to Trials seems odd.  Obviously, if I'm a post-grad, I'd love to train in Tempe and not be freezing to death half the year, that's certainly an advantage for sure."

Locally, we are all levels in Masters, and the events at meets are seeded by time, with no single age group event (though they are ranked by age group).   And the time cuts for Nationals are pretty generous and easy to obtain with hard work, so I think you will be ok. I am an ex-age grouper who had to quit swimming at 17 due to a long and involved illness, and I am back in the water after 20 years (coming up on my 1 yr anniversary of swimming again soon). I have good technique, but am not able to swim regularly due to my health (I'm constantly getting sick with colds/sinus infections/ etc). So while I could definitely be faster and stronger, I've just barely made the time cuts for summer nationals in a few events. And that's probably from technique and muscle memory, honestly."

It will make you feel like a slug for a few minutes but just leave it there while you pat dry. If I wait until after I've already started to dry off, the lotion will feel sticky and gross. Put it on while you are still wet!   When I wash my hair, I use much more conditioner than I normally would, instead of just putting it on the ends of my hair."

Swimming,33o22e,daniiielaaaa_,3,Fri Apr 24 02:23:35 2015 UTC,"Heh, no offence but treading water without hands is going to be the easiest part of the thing. If he's out of shape swimming 500 yards at any decent speed is going to be the harder part.  Source: Used to swim ages ago, out of shape now.  Anyway, here's a secret: Just kick your legs very very gently. You never need to do it too hard. Fold your arms across your chests and kick your legs alternately. For 2 minutes, that shouldn't be too hard."
Swimming,33o22e,raddaya,3,Fri Apr 24 11:45:19 2015 UTC,"Just remember, if you don't think he is ready you should tell him. Lifeguards don't have accidents often, but if he isn't physically prepared for one, it could be very bad."
Swimming,33o22e,WolfityWolf,5,Fri Apr 24 14:13:09 2015 UTC,"Just remember that you will float if you have air in your lungs. No treading water required - air floats. For the swim aspect, just push your floating mass along with whatever body parts you feel appropriate (I find arms and legs to be most useful personally).   I get confused by these posts about swimming tests. Are you going for a lifeguard job or something? I really hope the required standard of swimming is higher than these tests would suggest."

Swimming,33o22e,I_snot_the_sheriff,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:19:34 2015 UTC,I guess it depends on what swimming that tested distance is telling the assessor. Being able to swim 50m is very different from rescuing someone 25m away.
Swimming,33o22e,SnareDevil,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:52:43 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure there isn't much physical training your boyfriend can do in such little time. But you should still take him to the pool on a regular basis so that the pool won't seem like an unfamiliar place during the test. The only actual swim advice I can offer is that your boyfriend should start the 500 slow and gradually pick up the speed each 100 yards for a nice consistent swim. Besides that he should also drink plenty of water and get rest before the test. Good luck and if he doesn't pass then it wasn't meant to be.

Honestly though its not like they would check, so if you have an old suit you'd be able to try it out on, I'd go for it."
Swimming,33o7f6,beardybahaiguy,2,Fri Apr 24 03:20:50 2015 UTC,Check FINA and if it goes against the rules (which it probably does) dont....I repeat...DONT do it. You will get caught.

Swimming,33o314,Badgermutt,4,Fri Apr 24 02:31:58 2015 UTC,"Two things.    Breathing is a necessary inconvenience to swimming (kind of like hurdles on the track). You should execute your breath with as little effort and energy as possible. Excess or slow movements here will slow you down and upset your rhythm. With that in mind, keep your mouth low and close to the surface of the water, take the air and get your face back down. If at any point you can see the ceiling, you're doing it wrong.  To practice the above within the context of a high elbow technique, pause your recovery at half way. That is, as your hand comes past your body, point your elbow to the sky and stop when your hand is level to your shoulder. Practice taking your breath and having your face back down before this point. Pause for a count of 3, regain your position, then complete the stroke. Repeat. Now it's worth noting here that this is a core strength exercise. You have to build your foundational skills and it all starts with core strength. Try some kick with your arms at your sides (breathing to the sides) - that'll get you there even quicker."
Swimming,33o314,I_snot_the_sheriff,2,Fri Apr 24 02:52:11 2015 UTC,Thank you for your tips. I will try that.
Swimming,33o314,baddspellar,2,Sun Apr 26 01:17:30 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, as soon as my left forearm starts to pull back as per the high elbow technique, my body starts to sink and my breath is cut short.   Are you making sure to breathe out continuously while your face in in the water?   I'm an adult learner, and for a long while I was making the mistake of holding my breath for a bit when my face went into the water. That meant I either needed to both finish my exhale and inhale while my head was turned out of the water, which was really bad for timing, or I just didn't get enough air. You should be ready to inhale as soon as your head turns and your mouth comes out of the water. See this article"
Swimming,33le26,oneal66,3,Thu Apr 23 13:51:00 2015 UTC,"Definitely breath to both sides. Make it a habit.    Face should be straight down when swimming, when you breath make sure you don't just rotate your neck, the whole upper body should rotate to a degree as well."
Swimming,33le26,revawfulsauce,5,Thu Apr 23 16:29:41 2015 UTC,You should try and get into the habit of bilateral breathing. This should alleviate some of your shoulder pain. It would also be best to avoid picking your head up.
Swimming,33le26,purpleoceangirl,2,Thu Apr 23 15:30:12 2015 UTC,"Breathing to one side is a common problem that is connected to rotator cuff type injuries. If it's more pain in your neck then it has to do with picking your head up as you breathe. You need to work on keeping your head down when you take a stroke. The easiest way to learn this is to practice standing with your face in the water, rotate your head to one side and make sure one of your goggles is under water and the other above. You still might be picking your head up but if you continue to practice this it shouldn't be an issue.  As far as bi-lateral breathing is concerned just make sure that you try to breathe every 3rd stroke that way you get into a rhythm. It will feel awkward at first but once you keep doing it, it will start to become more natural.  The good thing about both of these situations is that learning them will make your stroke smoother and more refined, thus faster. Picking up your head while breathing is a common problem for some of my younger swimmers and really slows them down each time they do it. Bi-lateral breathing isn't necessarily faster but it helps with your form and preventing other injuries."

There will be days when you feel like you can't move you're so sore. But it's totally worth every second of pain. Every day when you look in the mirror, you're gonna see a winner. If you work hard. If you stick it out. You will see someone you are proud of when you look in that mirror. You will be stronger physically and mentally than a lot of people ever will be. And you will not regret a single second of the hell that you went through, because you are now a champion. It doesn't matter how fast you'll go in races if you do them. It doesn't matter if you're slower than others. Because when after every swim you are better than you were before, that's when you're a winner. Losers are the ones that can't handle it and just quit because it's to hard. You won't be a loser. You will be a winner.

I'm a year round couch so take what I have to say and leave what u don't want.  1) yeah you can use a bouyee (sorry for any misspellings I'm on my phone and in a hurry) above your knees to help your hips float as you pull. 2) if a swimmer of mine had bad calf pains I would suggest them to STRETCH THERE MUSCLES OUT, just simple toe pointing stretches while sitting on the ground. It sounds like you cramped hard and are a little gun shy (again haven't read older post but will do during a break), swimming isn't for the faint of heart. You are going to have pain, swimming is very physically demanding and you should expect some pain every now and then. Good luck and remember to stretch and warm-up"

Swimming,33kwaf,Bubbay,1 point,Thu Apr 23 13:05:02 2015 UTC,"simple toe pointing stretches while sitting on the ground.   I'm also a fan of wall presses, both with and without the heel on the ground.  Great way to stretch a calf.  However, if the pain is just residual stiffness from a cramp (which is extremely common with bad cramps), the last thing you want to do is immobilize it.  That will just make the pain take longer to go away.  Stretching and use will be best for recovery.  That said I AM NOT A DOCTOR and no one here has seen you or can properly evaluate an injury or the best method for you to heal from an injury.  If you have any concerns or thoughts that it might be an actual injury beyond a simple cramp, you should probably get it checked out.  Side note:  If you're cramping that badly after one day of swimming, you are probably pushing too hard too fast.  If you're a beginner, you'll be much, much better served working on technique over just trying to go fast.  Not only will you be more efficient, but you'll also be less susceptible to long-term injury if you are using good technique.  Try to do it right before you do it fast."

Swimming,33kwaf,Vaklempt,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:14:02 2015 UTC,"I like to do Joe Defranco's Limber 11 as a good dynamic stretching warmup for any sport. For swimming, because I have shoulder issues, I usually do some rotation exercises (think arm circles, shoulder circles, etc) after my dynamic routine. After any workout you should do a thorough series of static stretches. I usually spend a solid 15 minutes doing this, as it helps avoid horrible cramping during the next workout/day and helps with DOMS.   It also helps me if I use a heating pad (I like the microwaveable gel or clay ones) for 10-15 minutes at home before a swim. Once I've warmed the muscle, I like to gently massage and stretch it. I've found it helps me avoid further injury, but I am not a professional athlete or doctor.   Also, try to make sure you're getting enough WATER, potassium salts, magnesium and calcium. When I swam competitively, I had to take a potassium supplement or be sure that I ate a banana every day. Low magnesium can cause some muscle spasms.   Good luck! And possibly see your doctor or a PT if you feel like the cramping may have caused a muscle tear. It happens. :/"
Swimming,33kwaf,LeukiGamut,3,Thu Apr 23 16:38:41 2015 UTC,I've been swimming with hip injury and subsequent hip surgery and a bouy is a good way to  reduce the strain on your lower half. However that may not be the problem. If you're still new and getting  into swimming regularly you need to focus on your technique and on breathing better.  New swimmers tend to kick way too much and additionally don't have the most efficient breathing technique. Work on relaxing and slowing your kick to a 2 beat kick. Focus on your breathing so you are getting enough air  and decrease cramping.
Swimming,33kwaf,jamincan,2,Thu Apr 23 15:06:32 2015 UTC,"A similar thing happened to me a few months ago.  I usually swim three times a week, one hour each session.  Mostly breaststroke mixed with front crawl and backstroke.    In early March, I started getting cramps in my calves.  Awful cramps that lasted hours.  I ignored it for a while, thinking my body would work through it.  But the cramps got worse, and soon it felt like my calves were constantly cramped.  Every step was painful.  I'm not sure what caused the initial injury.  Could be improper technique with my frog kick (which can be hell on knees), or a combination of other factors.  I ate many bananas.  I've made two significant changes since then:  1) I bought a foam roller and the exercises seem to help;  2) I've been using only a pull buoy in the pool for the last six weeks, no kicking whatsoever.    This week, I'd say I'm finally starting to feel better.  Tried a few kicks.  No cramping, no pain.  The great thing about the buoy is that you can continue to practice your breathing and front/back stroke technique.  It hasn't diminished my enjoyment in the pool, and I think it's even added a little muscle to my upper body.    TL/DR: For extremely sore calves, stretching with a foam roller and swimming with a pool buoy has helped me considerably.  So that's my recent experience, for what it's worth!"
Swimming,33lfl5,peterpayne,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:03:48 2015 UTC,"You lost me somewhere in the middle there. But fly is definitely the most strenuous stroke because you're literally having to launch your upper body out of the water every stroke.    To work on timing one arm fly is the best for me, do three strokes with one arm then go to the other one, and keep alternating to work on timing without tiring out too much."

Swimming,33hvux,deantoadblatt,10,Wed Apr 22 21:04:27 2015 UTC,"If you've spent even a little bit of time with international level swimmers, this shouldn't be a shock. A lot of the big names in swimming work hard and play harder, but that play needs to be kept separate from the swimming world. Especially if that play involves morally questionable choices.   The descriptions of doping in competition and the use of performance enhancers at that level, however, is very insightful and quite depressing. What athletes choose to pollute their bodies with for recreation away from the pool is their choice. The problem is using certain substances specifically for the goal of performance enhancement during competition, and then using tricks like body doubles to hide it. It's sickening and disheartening to up and coming swimmers, because the standard is being set that you need more than just hard work to reach the top; because the top has now been pushed beyond normal human limits."

If that's the case make sure your pull is accurate and that your back stays relatively flat. When you come up to breathe it should be fast, your face should almost always be angled down a little instead of facing straight towards the wall (like 45 degrees-ish), and you should be thrusting your arms forward as you dive. With your pull, the way I learned it was ""scoop the cookiedough bowl, ask for more,"" and not ""spreading the sauce around the pizza."" Your scull should always be in front/under you, never behind you, so the arms should never be pushing water behind you. Hope that helps a little!"

Swimming,33iq3d,harrick,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:09:51 2015 UTC,"I notice that you seem to be ""scooping"" your left hand during the forward glide. You don't want your finger tips to be above the plane of your hand. The drill I use to correct this is to imagine that I'm reaching over a huge beach ball or swiss exercise ball when I extend my arm forward. This also helps with making sure your elbow is rotated correctly and not dropping.  You have nice rotation on your hips and your head looks relaxed. Good work on those two."

Swimming,33iq3d,BadDatingAdvice,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:22:04 2015 UTC,"You've got pretty balance and rhythm.  If you want to go faster, one thing you could do is work on pulling more water with your stroke, and try to get your body a little more streamlined.  With that in mind, here are some things to work on:   Relax your hands a bit.  You'll get better grip on the water if there is a small space between your fingers.  A tight cup like you're making has a smaller effective surface area than slightly spaced fingers.  Play with this while just standing around, find what hand shape and angle creates the most resistance pulling through the water. Try slowing down your stroke rate and getting more pull per stroke.  Once you can pull more water, then you up your stroke rate to increase speed.  Play with different angles for your arms, try to find the position where it's hardest to pull your arm through the water.  This is what you want for propulsion.  Practice some with a pulll-bouy.  Your hips are a bit low and will be dragging a bit, you want your butt cheeks just under the surface, and you should be able to do little flutter kicks to keep your body flat.  Increasing velocity can help with this (more speed generates a bit of lift), but use a pull-bouy to help get the feel for the body position.  You can also do the ""drowned person"" exercise, where you lie face-down in the water, relax, and try to keep your feet at the surface of the water with minimal movement.  Your legs will want to sink, try to figure out how to stay flat with the fewest movements of your feet.  Don't do this exercise without alerting the lifeguards and having a partner handy though, otherwise you might get rescued.   Some drills to try:    Finger drags - when your arm recovers, drag your fingertips along the surface of the water.  You should be able to touch your armpit.  Finger drags with pause - as above, but pause for 3 kicks when your fingers touch your armpit.  Swim with fists - do this to help learn how to get grip on the water with your forearm.  Thigh slaps - make sure you push on the water until your hand gets to your thigh - you're pulling out too early (that's what she said!) and losing some propulsion-per-stroke.  Catch-ups - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fszey7mJSb4 - notice how straight out in front her arms are - do that.  Think about maximizing grip on the water and going as far as possible for each stroke.   Overall, think about slowing down and pulling on more water.  Reach out as far as you can in front, start pulling as far out in front as possible, push water all the way through, and push the water for as long as you can at the back.  Imagine hanging one-handed from a rope holding a 200lb weight in your other hand, that's how extended you should be.  Speed = stroke length x stroke rate.  Your rate is probably about as high as it should go for now, you need to pull more water and reduce drag to go faster."
Swimming,33iq3d,I_snot_the_sheriff,1 point,Thu Apr 23 04:57:43 2015 UTC,"Good job. Self taught and a beginner, you're doing well.   But let's rebuild you a little.   Stand up, somewhere, anywhere with space. Put one arm up and one arm down. Rotate your arms like a windmill. Keep your head still and looking forward. There should be no pauses in your arms' rotations.   Take a break.   Go to a wall. Put your face up close so your nose is almost touching the wall. Raise one hand as high as it will go and touch the wall at that point. Now keeping your head straight, rotate your body towards the wall. Watch how your hand goes higher that it did before (magic, right!).  Back to playing windmill only this time, as you smoothly rotate your arms, allow your body to rotate with them as you did against that wall. Your head remains still. Your back is straight. You are holding your core strong.   This is your new rhythm, sir. That old one had hips going left to right, head going up and down, back bending, butt sinking and arms pausing all over the place.   There is other advice in this thread about fingertips and specific drills etc. IMHO, you're not there yet.  My advice is that if you're self taught and want to keep it that way, you've got to look at the big pieces first. Be the smoothest windmill there ever was.   Keep it up."
Swimming,33iq3d,Winki18,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:39:10 2015 UTC,"you should do the 3 touch drill focusing on a tight stream line and close breathing to the streamline. other than that your form looks good but your kick compared to your stroke is a little weak. rather, you have a strong pull."

Swimming,33etj2,hhaecceity,18,Tue Apr 21 23:07:14 2015 UTC,Use the flags to count how many strokes it takes for you to hit the wall. It usually takes 2-3 before going into a flip turn. If you're not doing flip turns on the last stroke turn onto your side so you can see the wall and just kick to it with your arm stretched out. If there aren't flags you'll just have to count the average number of strokes it takes you to get across the pool and keep track
Swimming,33etj2,zoboomafoooo,5,Tue Apr 21 23:33:24 2015 UTC,"Here is the legal way to save yourself in a competitive race.  When you first turn, stroke judges allow you one stroke.  When your arm is pointed downwards, slowly but noticeably move your arm to complete your one stroke.  This is legal because you're basically milking the one stroke you have while kicking yourself to the wall in the process.  It's what I use and is always a failsafe for my turns"
Swimming,33etj2,rocketdude698,-8,Wed Apr 22 04:03:46 2015 UTC,"This is great advice, but if this is competitive swimming, rolling onto your side/front is an automatic DQ."
Swimming,33etj2,BikeEmeraldCity,9,Wed Apr 22 01:44:21 2015 UTC,"You're always allowed to roll onto your front to do a flip turn. As for finishes, it depends where you live. In Canada, it's legal to roll a bit as long as you don't pass 90 degrees, so finishing on your side is risky, but legal."
Swimming,33etj2,k1p1k1p1,2,Wed Apr 22 02:36:54 2015 UTC,"IIRC, the local rules closely follow the international rule. The interpretation is that you are allowed to turn around for a flip turn, provided that there is continuous movement ending with the turn. So, kicking face down with an outstretched hand is a DSQ. Kicking face down while doing one pull with either one or two arms immediately followed by a flip turn is legal. The loophole is keeping arms moving as if stroking and kicking like hell if turning around too far.  Turning over 90 degrees to finish (including back to breast turn in I.M.) is a cause for DSQ."
Swimming,33etj2,avataRJ,1 point,Wed Apr 22 06:28:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly. The DQ you're referring to is ""non-continuous arm pull"" for back turns. At least one arm must be in motion until your feet touch the wall."
Swimming,33etj2,k1p1k1p1,3,Wed Apr 22 07:17:12 2015 UTC,"In the 1980s it was. You get one freestyle stroke at the turn, that's it."
Swimming,33etj2,steakbitch,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:44:12 2015 UTC,The best way to avoid this is to keep your eyes on the ceiling. it is very hard/impossible to roll your body over 90 degrees with your head looking up.

Swimming,33etj2,zoboomafoooo,3,Wed Apr 22 16:55:07 2015 UTC,Definitely count from the flags.  If I'm lane-sharing with more than one person I usually do regular head-dips (back) to check my proximity to others.  Sometimes I'll do this to also check proximity to the wall if I'm swimming at a crappy gym with no flags.
Swimming,33etj2,mixed_biznits_please,3,Wed Apr 22 01:40:34 2015 UTC,"Using the flags, sticking my head back, intuition... If no flags, then sometimes I'll peek at the lane lines, as they are usually marked differently where the flags would be."
Swimming,33etj2,supple,3,Wed Apr 22 01:45:07 2015 UTC,"Like another user said, stroke count from the flags in. You should have 2 stroke counts for flags...one with a turn, and a finish. My turn stroke count was 1-2-3-flip and 4 to finish. I also had a stroke count for the entire lap so it didn't matter if there were flags or not. At different pools, just get your stroke count in at warmup."
Swimming,33etj2,steakbitch,3,Wed Apr 22 03:43:04 2015 UTC,I pay attention to the ceiling and how many strokes I have between a particular feature and the wall. I tried watching the flags but my college pool had too many red flags that confused me so now I go by the lights.

Swimming,33etj2,rainwater739,2,Fri Apr 24 03:30:35 2015 UTC,If you don't have flags look to see if the lane lines have a pattern change as u get  closer to the wall. And count strokes
Swimming,33etj2,swimmingbelle,2,Wed Apr 22 04:07:45 2015 UTC,"It depends where you are. Everyone else has already mentioned backstroke flags, but really, any visual cue will do. When I was first starting out as a competitor, my team never put flags in. I got used to seeing a ladder out of the corner of my eye and used that as my cue for turns and finishes. It would be better to use something on the ceiling (head position is crucial!), but you need wicked eyesight for that."

Right now, in the midst of competition, the most important thing isn't your technique or anything else. It's your mental game. So, don't worry. Drop the pressure. Embrace the excitement!

Swimming,33dagt,CoutolencRoad,3,Tue Apr 21 17:45:23 2015 UTC,"Fellow beginner here! I can't comment on form since I'm still figuring out f/s myself, but general wisdom is that ""windmilling"" is bad. this video has helped me a lot with my form, so take a look at it and see how the arms should be moving.   I've personally never experienced muscle cramps while swimming, but it does happen, and I'm not well-versed in how or why it does. Keep in mind that you ARE using your muscles in a way they probably aren't used to, and to go fast you're asking quite a lot out of them. Try doing slow warmups before getting into any sprint-type stuff, just to ease your body into it.   As for good times, well, the world record according to Wikipedia is 20.91 seconds, which isn't exactly helpful for you because you're not gonna be anywhere near there. USA swimming has ""motivational time"" standards for all the various events for each age group from 10 to 18 years, and as a brand-new beginner I find these helpful even though I'm well outside those age groups now. For instance, looking at this table tells me that I currently swim slower than a 10-year-old girl. The numbers to pay attention to for what would be ""good"" for an adult are the 17-18 age group, as these are the times from people just getting into their prime - for 50m free we're looking at between 32.59 and 24.49 seconds for men, and between 36.79 and 27.59 seconds for women. These times are from the fastest historical 16th place swimmers in the top 16 of their age group, so if you can beat them, you're ""reasonably quick"".  Also keep in mind that I have been swimming for a grand total of 10 days, so you would be justified in ignoring literally everything I just said. Perhaps ""Armchair Coach"" should be my flair, haha."

Swimming,33dagt,yumyan,3,Wed Apr 22 07:12:27 2015 UTC,"Try to keep your elbows above your hands. A good drill to train this is zip drill. You run your hand up your side from your hips to your armpit and then make your hand entry like normal.  I've found that leg cramps may come up if you are putting too much effort into keeping your toes pointed. Try to relax your ankles and see where that gets you.  Good job on trying to get rid of the windmill, I see far too many people do it and it is frustrating to see how they are getting so little out of so much effort! Stretch out your arm in front of you, rotate your shoulder down on the forward arm to get more reach, and try not to cross your hand to the other side of your body.  Keeping your head still while swimming is often overlooked. Unless you are breathing, you want your eyes down, with your head as solid as a rock. This should help you keep swimming in a straight line instead of fishtailing or wiggling down the length."
