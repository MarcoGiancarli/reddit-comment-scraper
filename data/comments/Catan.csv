Catan,3dwevs,sesinm24,3,Mon Jul 20 04:48:46 2015 UTC,"By far the best expansion in my opinion but adds a lot to keep track of, I'd say seafarers would be a better next step based on what OP stated"
Catan,3dwevs,EmperorOfAwesome,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:09:40 2015 UTC,hey thanks yeah i think for now something that mixes up the game but keeps the difficulty curve and complexity about the same would be nice.  i think i would have to choose between seafarers and the barbarian one.  do you still prefer the seafarers over the barbarian one?
Catan,3dwevs,TheBeneGesseritWitch,2,Mon Jul 20 19:39:37 2015 UTC,"I would opt for Seafarers. Barbarians is more scenario based. Seafarers keeps the whole game the same....but adds a TON of variety.  Our favorite is the ""fog islands"" where all the tiles away from the main island are upside down--your little ships have to go explore and find the hidden islands. Lots of fun."
Catan,3dwevs,EmperorOfAwesome,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:45:50 2015 UTC,I sadly have not done the barbarian expansion but seafarers seems to be the first natural progression in terms of expansions people branch out into. Barbarians is more scenarios from what I gather you can play whereas seafarers is more hard and fast in its rules (although the boards can get super customizable)
Catan,3dwevs,SugarcaneRain,3,Mon Jul 20 19:58:31 2015 UTC,"Seafarers...maybe? That was the first expansion my playing group tried after playing standard Catan for a while. I'd say it has the least amount of new rules and concepts plus it increases the board size while also altering the map layout for every game.  Caveat: I haven't played ""Traders & Barbarians"" or ""Explorers & Pirates"" so I don't exactly have full experience with all of your options."
Catan,3dwevs,bigthirstywalrus,2,Mon Jul 20 13:22:43 2015 UTC,"Catan has done a great job with their expansions and their mechanics. You really can't go wrong with seafarers or Cities and Knights. With that being said, it does add more complexity but my money is on Cities and Knights"
Catan,3dwevs,Yukonkimmy,2,Mon Jul 20 15:28:22 2015 UTC,We have both Seafarers and Cities and Knights. We play with our 14 and 15 year old. They definitely prefer Cities and Knights because there are so many little goals to reach other than just victory points.
Catan,3dwevs,Yukonkimmy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:39:49 2015 UTC,Is cities and knights ok to play with 2 people?  since they usually play just against eachother

Catan,3dwevs,tmo42i,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:39:10 2015 UTC,"It plays reasonably well. In my experience, it's a little bit better of a 2P game than base Catan due to the breadth of strategy. However, if one player loses a city early on to the barbarians, it tends to be a blowout though.  I recommend use the 'easy start' variant from the C&K rulebook for 2P games, at the very least."

Catan,3disfn,shaybah,2,Thu Jul 16 17:50:55 2015 UTC,"Early game, you'll get some trades; they tend to die off mid-late game because it's generally too advantageous to your opponent for you to trade with them."
Catan,3disfn,tmo42i,3,Thu Jul 16 20:00:19 2015 UTC,Seems kinda boring. For me the trading is half the game.
Catan,3disfn,shaybah,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:51:39 2015 UTC,Trading is far fewer but because you are able to put down 3 settlements it's harder to have a problem getting resources.
Catan,3disfn,TimmersOG,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:01:14 2015 UTC,I think that sounds neat. I'll try to talk someone into giving that a shot. It certainly makes for a much longer game than two player with regular rules.
Catan,3disfn,tangerinelion,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:59:55 2015 UTC,"If placing 3 settlements to start, I'd probably bump the VP to 11 instead of 16 and, since I have the Seafarer expansion, add in either 1 or 2 more desert tiles to create a smaller board/introduce resource scarcity.  I'd certainly keep two 6s and two 8s in the number chits, but beyond that 1 or 2 of those number chits is not coming out because of the extra deserts.  Maybe it would make sense to eliminate 2 and 12 for that purpose and go with 2 extra desert tiles.    I'm not sure why you play to 16.  If you have all the cities out then it's a just collecting resources and the basic point of the game is long over."
Catan,3disfn,Moustashe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:06:44 2015 UTC,"We've tried a couple ways. I like one settlement, one city to start ( city is first placement). Play to 12."

Catan,3disfn,TimmersOG,4,Thu Jul 16 17:12:53 2015 UTC,"Regular rules two player is fun, it's like speed Catan, goes really fast. But there's not a lot of dimensions to the game, and it's possible that there's very little interaction on the board.   A friend of mine had an idea for a ghost player, who we both control, with some access the ghosts cards. It's pretty interesting, but it might be too wacky. If we get it ironed out into a decent game, I'll post the finalized rules."
Catan,3disfn,tmo42i,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:53:22 2015 UTC,"That's basically how the 2-player variant in T&B works, though without cards.  Basically as the real players build, they add settlements/roads to the neutral player(s)."

Catan,3dbx49,pton16,8,Wed Jul 15 01:57:33 2015 UTC,"Sometimes you can make house rules. I suggest making it so that the first action upon rolling a 7 is the movement of the robber so as not to forget. But, if forgotten,  no movement occurs until the next 7 is rolled or knight action performed."
Catan,3dbx49,JuJuOnTheMountain,8,Wed Jul 15 02:14:27 2015 UTC,"This is not a house rule. This is how it is. When a 7 is rolled, everyone with 8+ resources discards half of them AND after that a robber is moved. Only then can the player trade cards or buy stuff. You can use development cards at any time during your turn though (not sure about during the 7 roll but why would anyone do that anyway)."
Catan,3dbx49,Sande24,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:28:09 2015 UTC,The rules specify what to do if players forget to move the robber?
Catan,3dbx49,derangerd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:18:59 2015 UTC,The rules actually specify what to do when something is missed on someone's turn. Moving the robber is an example.
Catan,3dbx49,Sande24,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:58:39 2015 UTC,"Ah. So the knights just stays? Also, what happens with resources?"
Catan,3dbx49,derangerd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:27:50 2015 UTC,"The knight stays yes. And nothing will be stolen either because the player whose turn it was, didn't use his ability to move the robber. BUT all the players should remind that the robber should be moved. Otherwise it is cheating."
Catan,3dbx49,Sande24,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:10:23 2015 UTC,I would've thought the robber would be moved to the desert so not moving it can never benefit you (accidental or otherwise).  Does it say anything about if you forget to collect or over collect your resources?
Catan,3dbx49,derangerd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:14:33 2015 UTC,Anything that is missed after it is someone else's turn will not be fixed. If none of the players noticed the mistake (cheating or not) then it stays as it is.  The referees are also hanging around so they can still tell you to change something if it doesn't affect anything.
Catan,3dbx49,Sande24,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:25:28 2015 UTC,If you are going to monopoly a resource anyways you would probably want to do that before drawing a card from someone.
Catan,3dbx49,UBKUBK,-1,Wed Jul 15 21:15:38 2015 UTC,"I have a question around this.  In the rules it states that ""everyone with 8+ resources discards half""....can you 'hide' the fact that you have 8 and if no one notices and asks you how many cards you have are you off the hook or is it an honor system?"
Catan,3dbx49,masuraj,5,Wed Jul 15 12:55:15 2015 UTC,"That would be against the official rules (which I believe are worded that 'each player with more than 7 cards must discard half, rounded down, but someone can check me on that).  Granted, if it happens in a game and we don't notice someone had extra, we let it stand, assuming it didn't seem intentional.  For example, in a recent game, I counted 7 cards in my hand, but I didn't realize I had two ore stuck tgether."
Catan,3dbx49,tmo42i,2,Wed Jul 15 13:57:31 2015 UTC,"This is basically cheating.  Usually in the tournament everyone asks how many cards each player has. If you are caught cheating, you are disqualified (and you have to pay for all the expenses spent on you for staying in the hotel etc)"

Catan,3dbx49,ChiefBootKnocker,6,Sun Jul 19 02:48:39 2015 UTC,"From the tournament rules:  If the robber has not been moved and it's already someone else's turn, the robber stays in place. Nothing else happens.  So it is your duty as a player to remind the other players to move the robber when it should be moved. Also, there are rules about cheating but they are hard to enforce. For instance you can't knowingly let stuff like that happen."

Catan,3dbx49,TimmersOG,2,Wed Jul 15 15:26:59 2015 UTC,"We have a house rule about this. (And yes, we are often drinking when we play, we often play at the bar.)   Forgetting to move the robber can screw an innocent party  For example, you roll a 7 and the robber is on something I'm benefiting from, and you forget to move it, I didn't forget, but it hurts me.   So, if you forget to move the robber, we say that you still move the robber where you want, but you don't get to rob. So the ""innocent"" party isn't hurt by your forgetting, but you are punished for forgetting.   We haven't had to deal with someone remembering it many turns later. If that happened, we'd probably leave it where it was."

Catan,3d93wg,kstacey,2,Sat Jul 18 20:07:28 2015 UTC,I like th fish scenario in Traders and Barbarians. It removes the desert and adds an oasis and fish corner hexes where you collect fish tiles which you trade in for things. Pretty simple adjustment and adds a new dimension to the game.

Catan,3d91hw,Sande24,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:22:03 2015 UTC,How would it create an unbalance specifically?
Catan,3d91hw,Sande24,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:47:25 2015 UTC,"1) The rules basically say that the development cards must always be secret until they are played. You can't show others what cards you have. Trading unused dev cards away is basically the same as showing your cards to other players. Meaning that you can guess which cards are left in the deck. It is a slight imbalance thing but it counts.  2) Largest army - if one player has a strategy to get ahead with knights, it is very easy for the other 3 players to throw everything on another player to steal his knights. Largest army should be hard to steal away. Roads are easier.  3) Selling away victory points would be really pointless unless you can get 2-3 points in exchange somehow. Still, situational.  4) If you could trade already used cards - can you use them again? Well that is the most unbalanced thing ever and I doubt anyone would even think of selling a monopoly to someone. Knights, maybe. But if 3 players basically trade knights and fuck up the 4th player because he is ahead at 9 points, it is really shitty way to play the game."

Catan,3d1eh2,chrylarson,2,Mon Jul 13 14:17:13 2015 UTC,A custom catan board off etsy or if you can find the special edition wood set at a reasonable price. We bought ours when it came out and we love it.  There is also a catan table out there somewhere. A giant lazy Susan (wine barrel or whisky barrel) get it engraved with his/your last name & wedding date and use it to play catan on. Make sure it's big enough though.

Catan,3cu2gg,leblancbabyy,11,Fri Jul 10 19:53:21 2015 UTC,"I generally only allow for re-placement of roads if their placement led to an illegal move. For example, if someone built two roads and a settlement, only to be told the settlement is illegal (right next to another settlement), I'd generally allow them to re-place the two roads he placed since those pretty much are useless now. Of course, that's a beginner move (I play with a lot of beginners so I will eventually have lots of friends who play well). I also allow people to move roads they initially place if they change their mind during the placement process. I'd generally allow it until that player made another ""Catan-related move"" (to borrow a phrase from the NFL rulebook), like passing the dice, initiating trades, playing a development card, and  yes, declaring victory. Once that player moves on from the ""Placement phase"", those pieces are stuck there. Of course, many people will probably say that it's like chess, once you move your hand off the piece, it's officially placed (this is how it works with the electronic versions of the game; once it's placed, there's no removing it).  In your case, he placed the roads, and declared victory. To me, that signals to me that he is satisfied with his placements (similar to passing the dice, initiating trades, whatever).  TL;DR I think you're right. You lose the right to move any pieces once you (strict rules) take your hand off the piece, or (more casual rules) do anything that indicates you're satisfied with your placements."
Catan,3cu2gg,mtrem225,2,Fri Jul 10 20:13:16 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of the ""Catan Related Moves"" rule."
Catan,3cu2gg,iharland,2,Sat Jul 11 00:19:08 2015 UTC,"it's not perfect but i feel its fair. Sometimes people need to visualize the board by putting pieces down, and to me that's fine. But once they're down and you do something else, they're down and there's no going back."
Catan,3cu2gg,mtrem225,2,Sat Jul 11 03:14:20 2015 UTC,"Same, this is how we play. If someone puts down their roads, then immediately realizes that's not where they wanted to place it, we let them switch. If they have placed the roads, THEN do other trading/building, then the roads are set in stone."

Catan,3cu2gg,mtrem225,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:15:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's true.  There are exceptions to what I said.  I guess whenever I play Catan there are usually a couple of casual gamers.  If everyone is hard-core, we're usually playing a different game.  I might think differently if I was playing a super-serious game of Catan."
Catan,3cu2gg,dejour,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:24:20 2015 UTC,I agree with that too but in this case of he went ahead with talking trades or other Catan related moves enterprise would have to inform him that his  roads are illegal as he hadn't payed for them. Then he moves them where he wants and pays if they still don't connect to the longest he just loses. Otherwise he can change and win
Catan,3cu2gg,icydeadpeeps,6,Sat Jul 11 03:54:32 2015 UTC,"My answer to this, keeping in mind I'm notoriously a stickler for rules; Marc should have paid for the roads before placing them. I can't see your hand and even if I could, you need to pay for something before building it. Second, as a fan of chess, I've always lived by the rule that once you make your move, that's it. No, ""whoops, I meant to do this instead when you realize you screwed up."" What is on the board is what you build, if your hand leaves what you are building. Basically, I would have called him out for not paying first. I'm not allowed to just put things on the board to see what it looks like, that's what my brain is for, not during gameplay (or a final turn) at least. That being said, and admitting I side with you, I know I'm a rule junkie, which can come off as me being an ass. I would tell myself that he had, in good spirit and competitive play, beaten me had he not made the mistake, and admitted defeat and say good game."
Catan,3cu2gg,Onoudidnt,3,Fri Jul 10 20:16:57 2015 UTC,"My friends and I play once the piece is picked up and left the player's hand after putting it on a legal spot on the board,  you can't pick up the piece and move it. This is the only thing we are strict about, just like chess, you take your hand off the piece it stays. We're not strict as far as paying before or after you put the piece down as long as you have the resources.   As far as game ending etiquette, we know when the other person has won or not. If they have the resources, we won't require them to physically set down the pieces. Show us you got what it takes... O.K. you won... Good Game  I'd much rather have a close game and come in second then blow out my friends. I seem to get a lot more enjoyment out of a close, last turn game then the satisfaction I get from adding another 'W' to the win column.   I would have never allowed Marc to move his pieces once he took his hand off of them. So if you had the winning hand, you would have won the game."
Catan,3cu2gg,hog-a-licious,3,Fri Jul 10 20:22:16 2015 UTC,"We play that once you take your hand off a piece, it stays. It's the only fair way to do it. If he placed them incorrectly, he didn't take longest road.  You also should have people pay the resources before placing anything on the board."
Catan,3cu2gg,taexi73,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:08:06 2015 UTC,"This. We play chess rules, once your hand is off it's done. If he proclaimed he's buying two roads, puts them down without paying, he's made the assumption that he's going to pay. He fucked up and it's OP's win bc Marc is an idiot."
Catan,3cu2gg,DarkestTimelineJeff,3,Fri Jul 17 20:24:24 2015 UTC,"I always allow people to modify their actions until new information that may impact their choices has come up:    They purchase and look at a development card, or reveal an expansion resource  They ask for a trade (obtaining information about the trade partner's intentions);  The next player rolls the dice.   once one of these things have happened anything that has come before is set it stone."
Catan,3cu2gg,TeebsGaming,2,Sat Jul 11 04:44:00 2015 UTC,"So, two separate issues here.   1) Playing things without paying for them.   Don't.  It's against the rules. Quite clearly.  Having said that, he thinks the game is over, so kind of understandable. I'm guessing he at least turned them over so you can see he CAN pay for them (if not, you have a separate issue entirely). I can see the argument, ""look, I've got the cards, the game is over, what difference does it make that the cards are on the table rather than back in the bank."" Having said that, not having paid for something should not, on it's own, allow for a redo, UNLESS that's your rule (see below).   2) Can you move stuff when you realize, for whatever reason, you wanted it somewhere else?   You need a house rule, and you need to agree to use it ahead of time.  The Catan rules do not address this. Nowhere does it say anything like, ""Once it's down, it's played"" or, ""It's ok to move things until you pass the dice."" You need to come up with a rule everyone can agree on and use it in all situations like this. Surely you've come across something like this before, maybe at the beginning of the game, where someone is placing their initial settlements and, before it's the next person's turn, they realize the want to move a settlement or road. What do you normally do when that happens? If people are generally allowed to move things, then I'd say the same rule applies here, if not, then they stay where they are placed.   Regardless, you need a house rule that answers this in all cases and saves you these kind of questions. You could say, once you play it, it must stay, or as long as your hand is still on it, you can move it, or you can change whatever you want until you pass the dice, or maybe you agree to pay after you place, and once you pay for it it's permanent (that's a weird one, and it wouldn't work for the initial placement, but your current situation made me think of it). I know people who, for initial placement, say you can change your mind about your settlement until you place your road. Really, any rule that's clear and easy to remember and understand is fine, but you need a rule.   TLDR;  I don't really think the paying for it enters into it. If you normally let people move things, he wins, if not, you win. Come up with a house rule to cover moving things.   Edit: formatting"
Catan,3cu2gg,TimmersOG,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:53:53 2015 UTC,"We play you can change things if you haven't passed the die or started your movement phase (E&P), but in this case since he proclaimed victory and I would say that he has finished his turn! As for not paying excuse, that's a bit lame, you played them so now you owe the bank."

Catan,3clpe3,gardev,2,Wed Jul 8 21:52:50 2015 UTC,"I think you made solid choices, what gave you the relatively easy win is the 3:1 + overall great numbers. Because of trades, variety doesn't matter as much as sheer number of cards."
Catan,3clpe3,starts_s_ends_lick,2,Thu Jul 9 01:35:47 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy these. Mr. BGW and I have been playing with each other for so long that we know each other's strategies and often fill in for each other when we are playing and one of us is occupied with the kid or dog or dinner....   We like to discuss these posts, usually in the form of ""I would go here, but I bet you'd go there with the eventual plan to build to here. If we were playing C&K, how would that change your placement? I bet you'd put your city there instead.....am I right--you'd do that?"" :)"
Catan,3clpe3,TheBeneGesseritWitch,2,Fri Jul 10 14:36:30 2015 UTC,"Also I would go 8/5/10 (sheep sheep wheat) and the 6/3/11 (ore wood sheep) with plans to connect them for longest road and to hit the 3:1 port. The heavier sheep monopoly is good, plus it lends itself to ease of development card purchases.   Mr BGW says he's go for the 6/9/2 Ore/Sheep/Brick and ""the clusterf*ck of wood is pissing me off, I almost want 8/3 wood/brick split just because I need a well rounded hand. I think the 8/5/10 sheep-wheat would win out though. Tradesies, after all."""
Catan,3clpe3,TheBeneGesseritWitch,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:45:39 2015 UTC,"The best spots in my opinion would be 2/9/10 (brick/sheep/wheat) and 6/11/12 (stone/stone/wheat). From here you should be able to expand to the 3:1 port on the 2/6 (brick/stone) and completely surround the 12 wheat with settlements, giving you the wood you need and the sheep port. Possible expansion to the 5 sheep makes that sheep port worth having. The only possible problem I see is that orange could place on that 2/6/port (brick/stone/3:1) but I doubt that will happen. Wheat is scarce so you definitely need that. Good variety of numbers with these placements and you will control a good portion of the stone game, which should give you the dev card advantage which means you could block the other wheats as well.    Sorry for the essay, I am just very passionate about Settlers placements."
Catan,3clpe3,j_rando,2,Thu Jul 9 00:53:50 2015 UTC,I just don't think you'll have enough production with those numbers to get on a good start.
Catan,3clpe3,starts_s_ends_lick,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:33:59 2015 UTC,"His would have had your starting hand been 2 ore and a wheat.  If you got one more ore (likely), and another wheat (reasonable chance), that's an early city.  And if your hand size got too big without getting that, you could pare down with a dev card if necessary."

You gotta decide to lose a hex and gain trade. Or just gun for a port as your 3rd settlement. Getting robbed is common and inter-player trades can be ridiculous so as to not have to discard half.

Endless arguing about whether to re-roll 1 die, both dice, or let the roll stand. And obviously, you'll be arguing for whatever outcome benefits you the most. So here's a rule to solve it. When you get a slanty die like that, you gently stack the other die on top. If it doesn't fall, the roll stands. If it falls, re-roll both."

Catan,3boeg1,someguytoo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:56:21 2015 UTC,"Well, the app doesn't let you hide the number of cards you have - just which type (blue, yellow, green) they are."
Catan,3boeg1,TimmersOG,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:24:22 2015 UTC,"I looked in the C and K rules and FAQ and didn't see anything.   I did notice this, I guess it's up to you if you want to follow this interpretation. The C and K rules say ""In Cities & Knights, progress cards replace development cards..."" and in the base set rules it says ""Keep your development cards hidden until you play them.""   One way to read that would be that rules that apply to the dev cards also apply to the progress cards, except where explicitly stated otherwise. So, you could hide them just like dev cards.   Another way to look at it is, it never says you have to show how many or which cards you have, so you don't. Usually that's the sort of thing that would be stated if you did.   Having said that, since there is a limit, it's probably easier to show how many you have, which would mean showing which ones. I suppose you could hide them, and agree that you have to say how many you have, but not show the colors, but it's usually better to adopt rules that don't allow for cheating (or just simple misunderstandings) when that is an option.   Since the app get's to act as a referee it doesn't have to deal with that problem, so while I like that logic (that it's coded match the rules) it doesn't 100% apply here.   Anyway, my two cents. I hope that's helpful, but I'm guessing not."
Catan,3boeg1,TheBeneGesseritWitch,2,Tue Jun 30 21:44:21 2015 UTC,"No, very helpful. The thing I really dislike is when people play a Spy card and decide to go after the person ""with the most green cards,"" and are too lazy to remember who earned what."
Catan,3boeg1,TheBeneGesseritWitch,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:27:28 2015 UTC,"It also says in the base game instruction:   Keep your development cards hidden (in your hand) until you use them, so your opponents can’t anticipate your play   A few weeks ago someone posted about hiding them in his pocket. (That's clearly not what the game meant by ""hiding."") It's harder, imo, to keep a type of card hidden while holding it in your hand or facedown on the table....especially when the number of progress cards you have should be public knowledge (no more than 4, 5 if it's your turn)."

He can take which ever you don't take of the 6-5-11, 9-4-11 and 6-4-3 and  be content building longest road, largest army, or some combination of both. Your problem is wheat is isolated and starting without it will stagnate you in any placement.  6-5-11 is a free road. so take that 2nd. 1st I'd probably grab the 8-10-desert pointing towards that 4 stone. Together they get you the best chance of grabbing all resources and getting some space.  Your 6-5-11 will get sandwhiched with orange taking the 9-4-11, white the 6-4-3 and red the 6-4-11, so don't bother about that road placement or aim to build anything off that. but then you don't get any stone.  so 9-4-11 & 6-5-11, build like hell towards that 5-2 wheat stone spot and pray for the best.  well done orange."
Catan,3bbwro,shadzinator,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:06:05 2015 UTC,I'm not following this.  What if blue went with 6-5-11 (2nd for the free road) and 6-4-3 (point road towards the 8-3 wheat-sheep)?  If someone takes the 8-3 (unlikely) blue can always build towards the 5 wheat.  This setup also has the advantage of the wood port's proximity to complement the two high production wood spots.

Have you thought of implementing the elite 4 somehow?  Can we see more details of the actual cards? I want to look at the pokemon cards you can collect to see more : ] I think this would be so fun to play."

Catan,3azye7,igeteatenbytheworms,54,Wed Jun 24 21:23:51 2015 UTC,"If the orange settlement was there first, the road play is not allowed.  However, if the road was there first, it's a perfectly legal play, and two things to note: 1) the red player CAN continue his road past the orange settlement and 2) the orange settlement disrupts red's road for the purposes of counting roads for the longest road."
Catan,3azye7,moxiejeff,5,Wed Jun 24 21:26:48 2015 UTC,Thanks! Very helpful
Catan,3azye7,darshane,0,Wed Jun 24 22:52:44 2015 UTC,"Um...regarding your 1st sentence, can you please clarify where, in the rules, it says this?  We've played that you can build roads past other settlements and I can't find rules disallowing it.  Thx."
Catan,3azye7,frmatc,6,Thu Jun 25 12:16:51 2015 UTC,"I don't have any other edition rules in front of me but it's explicitly disallowed under the ""Roads"" entry in the 5th ed Rules (warning PDF):   He may build (place) his road on any of the paths outlined in green. Each of these paths connects to either Liam's road or his settlement, and is not blocked by the blue player's settlement (see the path outlined in red)."
Catan,3azye7,jaredb,7,Thu Jun 25 12:57:50 2015 UTC,Assuming orange placed the settlement to break red's road - yes it is a valid settlement placement. Red could still build off the cutoff road.   If red played the road through orange's settlement that is illegal.

Catan,3azye7,dfreshv,2,Wed Jun 24 22:11:40 2015 UTC,Anyone else think there should be a stickied post about this rule?  Full disclosure: I personally house rule that this is not allowed. But it's plain as day in the official rules.

Catan,3azye7,craftac,5,Thu Jun 25 14:16:55 2015 UTC,how do you think harbors work...?
Catan,3azye7,lolugrumpy,3,Wed Jun 24 22:03:23 2015 UTC,Sorry you got downvoted for a simple question.  You can see by each port there are two little harbor things protruding out.  Only those locations receive the port (so it's impossible to get two different ports with one settlement).
Catan,3azye7,Look-over-there1234,2,Wed Jun 24 22:32:21 2015 UTC,Neither one. It simply splits red's road.
Catan,3azye7,splitplug,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:13:32 2015 UTC,Neither.  You have to actually build on the two corners with the port in-between.
Catan,3azye7,mszegedy,-12,Wed Jun 24 23:18:23 2015 UTC,"Officially no. In practice, it depends on the house rules.  EDIT: What do you people have against house rules?"
Catan,3azye7,jaredb,6,Wed Jun 24 22:06:00 2015 UTC,"What? These are well defined rules of the game not open for interpretation.  You are being down voted for being wrong, not because of house rules."
Catan,3azye7,mszegedy,-2,Thu Jun 25 13:26:35 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about? Of course they're not open to interpretation. That's not what house rules are. House rules are just... rules, which the house makes. Since people complain about this rule, sometimes it's house-ruled out."
Catan,3azye7,Violetly,2,Wed Jun 24 22:33:26 2015 UTC,"Officially   Officially, yes you can build a settlement in the middle of an existing road. Officially, no you can't build a road past a settlement (I think). The OP didn't specify which was being done first, so that might be why you're getting downvoted."
Catan,3azye7,mszegedy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:57:14 2015 UTC,That's true. People usually ask about the latter.
Catan,3azye7,Violetly,2,Thu Jun 25 05:29:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm so over these posts! It seems like half of the posts lately are 'can i build a road past a settlement' and 'oh noes someone put a settlement in the middle of my longest road', I'm tired of it!"
Catan,3azye7,DJGingivitis,-3,Thu Jun 25 09:30:37 2015 UTC,THEY ARENT OUR HOUSE RULES! but seriously i upvoted because you didnt deserve down votes.
Catan,3ayrs0,gardev,3,Wed Jun 24 16:11:34 2015 UTC,"What was the order? Blue, Red, White, Orange? Seems like it.  Sucks to be first.  1) Blue's road is in the wrong direction. Never build towards the middle of the map unless you know no-one is going to take both of your destinations. In this case it was obvious you won't get that 8 wheat.  Then again the opponents seem to be really stupid. In the end your location is not that bad anymore (but the road should have still been in another direction).  2) Red messed up everyone else's game with the 8-4 and left blue a lot of room to develop. Should have taken some other location. I think in this situation blue should take 3-6-11 and hope to build the 4-5-11 ASAP. After that 9-12 and go for cities, fill the rest of your section of the map. Get development cards if possible.  3) White is out of the game but orange still has some ways to win. That's why your move should block him. (Don't trade with white yet, though. Might steal a location from you. Make sure you get the initial locations first.)  As the first player I would have taken grain and/or grain positions first in this map. Maybe you could get ore later in the game or somehow with your 2nd settlement. On the shore probably. Maybe you would have even gotten a good port. But since the players made these moves, you can win the game easily. You need that 4 wheat first!"
Catan,3ayrs0,Sande24,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:38:33 2015 UTC,"White is out of the game   I don't think this is true. Sure white wasted a couple roads, but it has good resource diversity and not awful numbers. Not the favorite, but I've won with worse starting positions.  White also has pretty good ability to get new roads with its 8 brick/10 wood. Just gotta get a bit lucky at the beginning."
Catan,3ayrs0,mtrem225,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:55:31 2015 UTC,"Oh, damn. I think I mixed up orange and white there."
Catan,3ayrs0,Sande24,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:09:06 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree that 3-6-11 is the choice.  Everyone else's roads are pointed to the coast, so if you get a quick start you can basically get half the board to yourself. 4-5-11 and 9-10-11 are great 3rd and 4th spots."
Catan,3ayrs0,lupka,2,Wed Jun 24 20:44:40 2015 UTC,10/5/2 on wood/brick/wheat with your road going toward the 9 sheep. Cut the board in half with roads. build for the 8 wheat wood port if possible. You would have a huge wood advantage on the rest of the players.
Catan,3ayrs0,agroene93,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:26:49 2015 UTC,I thought about that.  The issue I see there is it lacks number diversity.  If a 10 doesn't come up then the blue player is boned.
Catan,3ayrs0,agroene93,2,Wed Jun 24 16:28:30 2015 UTC,"True, blue is going to have to sacrifice number diversity or resource diversity. I tend to go resource diversity over number diversity if the numbers are decent enough, especially when there are so few decent wood numbers."
Catan,3ayrs0,Sande24,2,Wed Jun 24 16:44:42 2015 UTC,That 2 wheat is not what I'd consider resource diversity though. 11 brick is not good either but it also gives you 1/3 map control.
Catan,3ayrs0,spkrause,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:53:45 2015 UTC,I understand.  I consider 2/12 to be only slightly better than desert.
Catan,3ayrs0,Sande24,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:32:27 2015 UTC,You're all but guaranteed that 4-wheat though.
