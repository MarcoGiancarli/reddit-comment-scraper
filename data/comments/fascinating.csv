A fun article, but...You didn't get some of the terminology correct.  0) This part is incorrect:  ""According to bpoag, the actual ""hack"" was simple enough to pull off, and didn’t require any advanced or technical equipment beyond what an avid phreaker would already have had in his arsenal"" ... phreaking and broadcast hacking are entirely different sports.  1) Phreaking is a subset of hacking, and has existed long before computers.. Hell, I can point you to books written in the late 1800's of teenagers fucking with people and playing pranks with telephone switchboards..  2) J was a hacker, not a phreak...specifically, a hardware/radio hacker. K probably was as well, but i'm not entirely sure. I believe he worked at a place that had something to do with telephone networks, but i'm way foggy on that.  Also, I wouldn't have characterized myself as an ""avid phreaker"" in the mid 80's. I had done a few things, and had an interest in learning more, but I wasn't full-bore into it as a hobby until the early 90's. There were a million people better than me at it. Way better.

fascinating,3bavam,SarcasticSadist,3,Sat Jun 27 22:02:35 2015 UTC,"I have an econ degree + retired from a career in banking, at the headquarters of a major multinational bank:  Yes, that's exactly how inflation works; ""too much money chasing too few goods"" - straight out of the textbook. Fewer jobs needed = less goods produced + everyone gets an allowance = everyone has more money to spend.  However:   We kind of have basic income already. They're talking about chopping off welfare, food stamps, and social security and replacing it with basic income. That makes less of a difference, and eliminates the government bureaucracy where you have to prove you need these things. Inflation already happens. It happens every year when the lower / middle class gets income tax refunds, it happens when gas prices dip and then come up again, it happens every December because people save up money for Christmas shopping. It's not the end of the world. We also give the upper class tons of money, shiploads of it. We bail out banks, we let corporations exploit tax loopholes, we let their lobbying dollars influence politics to have outcomes beneficial for their profit. This, too, drives inflation. Under certain scenarios, a little inflation is good for the economy and so is welfare. When you give the lower class money, they're not just going to sit on it. It will go immediately into the market and circulate.   Biggest problem with the article is using examples from Namibia and India and thinking that it applies anything to the richest, most powerful nation on Earth and empire in history. If you reduce every problem to ten people on a desert island trading coconuts, you could ""prove"" the moon is made of green cheese, but you're gonna have a bad time applying it.  The biggest problem with basic income is that it will keep going up. When you give people $1000, they won't see any harm in asking for $1010. Finally some politician will break down or some measure will pass and then they'll all have $1010, at which point they will start asking for $1020. THEN inflation will sure as hell kick in, and we'll be Zimbabwe."

fascinating,36as1m,oopssorrydaddy,11,Sun May 17 23:34:11 2015 UTC,"Yea, what they meant was, ""words for which there is no equivalent word in English."""
fascinating,36as1m,heisenbrau,7,Mon May 18 00:08:32 2015 UTC,"Well, as a Swede I can say that I have never heard of ""tretar"". Might be that they are trying to say ""Tretår"" which I still have never heard of, but ""Påtår"" is a Swedish word for ""refill"" (although ""påfyllning"" is more commonly used) so I guess that somewhere in some remote corner filled with pimpled teenagers and snowmobiles there are 60+ people who refer to the third refill as ""tretår""."
fascinating,36as1m,Pihlbaoge,4,Sun May 17 23:08:39 2015 UTC,Came here to say the same thing. I wonder if all the others are as inaccurate and/or obscure as well.

fascinating,36as1m,xix_xeaon,2,Mon May 18 15:54:40 2015 UTC,"I think the big picture of this subject is the really interesting thing though; the fact that different languages express different ideas of things in different sets of words. I feel people often fail to realize that you very rarely can translate something without losing some of the original meaning.  For instance, comparing the Swedish subtitles to the original English, you rarely get the same feeling because even the words which supposedly translate to each other still have different nuances in the different languages. I've rediscovered this while trying to learn Japanese, which I find extremely hard to translate because an Asian language is even more different to a European language, and in comparison makes Swedish and English pretty damn similar."
fascinating,36as1m,PuzzledIdiot,1 point,Mon May 18 17:18:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is what I thought as well. German and English are so similar, part of the reason being that German is kind of an origin of English, but also other languages and cultures like Latin or French had an impact on it.  Other languages like Japanese that had like no connection to European languages, therfore have completely different words with meanings that can't be directly translated.  So language is not like a mathematical system where 1+1=2. 1+1 being the word in one language and 2 being the matching word in another language. Definitely an interesting topic."
fascinating,36as1m,yeritito,1 point,Tue May 19 12:14:15 2015 UTC,"I drink a lot of coffee, and tretår is a common expression in my circle of friends, also, from where I come from, ""påtår"" is more commonly used than ""påfyllning"".

So, we won't be needing as many trucks now because there won't be customers for the goods it carts around anyway. And so the economy implodes in a puff of logic :-).

Fermi's paradox does make sense, but there are some obvious reason we might not see evidence of other planetary civilizations yet.   We have had radio technology for less than 200 years - both to send and receive. The universe is billions of years old. Even we have been broadcasting for a short period of time. It is possible we've just missed broadcasts, because the civilizations sending them out had that capability for a blip of time, in the grand scheme. No one has visited us. Well, it is possible that intergalatic or intersystem travel isn't feasible, or worth the effort. Would you give up your entire life to live on a ship and travel 1/10 of the length of a journey to explore vast empty swaths of the galaxy? We have, and we don't understand/can't comprehend them with our particular senses.   There are many more possibilities, and they aren't at all particularly weird or confusing."

We just have to think if we were in the same situation what would we do? Probably wouldn't send a resource expensive, person to do a job our technology could so easily do.

Even the sharpest metal knife has a jagged, irregular blade when viewed under a strong enough microscope; when examined even under an electron microscope an obsidian blade is still smooth and even.  One study found that obsidian incisions produced fewer inflammatory cells and less granulation tissue at 7 days, in a group of rats.

How much money is lost by people sifting through change in their pockets to make exact change thus holding up a line? Coinage is the worst and I'm happy that all coins have been relocated to some form of collectable or garbage by inflation.   God Bless America!"

Most wallets and purses here have dedicated areas for coins, so there's no need to dig through your pockets. And most people when paying with cash will have it ready by the time they get to the counter, why would you wait? Even if you don't know how much it'll cost exactly, usually you have a tough idea like ""no more than $10"" so you get $10 ready. It's really not inconvenient when you're used to it."

If I pay with cash I just open my wallet quickly thumb through the bills while they ring it up and boom done. In Europe I would pretty much just do the same thing except half way through the trip I realized I had like 50 euros in my backpack and pockets. Also if you are taking coins out you should probably pay with correct change to the best of you're ability right otherwise you end up with a billion 1 cent pieces. It all just feels like a hassle to me.   I definitely wouldn't want a wallet that has more crap in it. If you have ever watched seinfeld please refer to the episode about george costanza's wallet to get an idea about what I'm avoiding.  Coins have little value in the USA most people just stock pile them in a jar at home and then bring them to coin counting machines at the bank and have it converted into more manageable currency or keep it in their car for parking meters. In fact our $.01 coin now infamously costs more to mint then it's worth.

And I guess when you have always had wallets that acommodate coins it doesn't feel like they're taking up extra room. Most people don't tend to have many coins on them at once anyway.

There are references to the color blue throughout recorded history. It is true that there is no use of the color blue in art until long after humans first started doing art but that is due to the lack of technology not an inability to recognize the color blue. Even before blue pigment was invented the color itself was referenced frequently most notably as the skin color of various gods.  The reason greeks didnt have a word for the color blue is because they didnt have a word for any specific color. They used other words to give people a general idea of what color they were talking about. They would describe how bright it was and then compare it to something of a similar color. The description of the ocean as being wine colored is likely due to the color you get when you mix red wine into water; Blue.

These analog signals are broadcast between 7-1002 Mhz, and TV tuners are designed to receive in this range. The CMB peaks in the microwave, at around 160 Ghz, but the frequency of CMB photons can be lower than 100 Mhz (.1 Ghz). Your television antenna is constantly being bombarded by these signals, but when it’s tuned to a specific station the overwhelming intensity of the signal at that frequency makes a crisp picture on your screen, and drowns out everything else. When your TV or radio isn’t tuned into a channel that is brodcasting clearly, it picks up whatever radio transmissions are available and displays those transmissions as the black and white static that is oh-so annoying when you are trying to acrobatically align your TV antenna and stand in just the right place to clearly show your favorite program.

But with the small groove scratched in, all of that force gets concentrated on that one single line, and will break the glass precisely at that point."

They say that chess is evolved as training for war strategy. Well, football is training for actual wartime decision making. You're not always pushing for a touchdown. Sometimes you're  pushing for a field position that will better place your team for a touchdown or to actively hinder the efforts of the other team while they're trying to do the same thing back to you. WWII's island hopping is a great illustration of football tactics. You take ground and then regroup, plan, and execute.

The distance to the moon is 384,400 km (distance to the core would add another 1,737.4 km) and the radius of jupiter is 69,911, so the ""surface"" of jupiter would still be somewhere around 314,489km away from the surface of the earth.

In the photo that went viral, you can see the shadow of one of Jupiter's moons on Jupiter, and most of Jupiter's moons are relatively similar in size to our own moon, so I think that gives a pretty good perspective on just how massive Jupiter would look in our sky in comparison to our moon."

Life is basically a complex organism that replicates itself endlessly. Life goes on because things keep reproducing, perhaps with different variations but nonetheless new things arise from old things.  Imagine that we created AI that operated under the same principles. We made it autonomous and established some method for reproduction/alteration, and then over time the AI would prodcue offspring with slight or major variations that would have more or less chance at proliferating.  ""Intelligence"" really doesn't make sense without some set of goals. You can't 'intelligently' do things unless you had intent to do them, and you can't have intent to do something unless it's a goal that has been set either internally or externally. Reproducing AI would have randomly modified goals, and this would result in an increase or decrease in the proliferation of the AI. And then you have some alternate intelligence (perhaps smarter than humans, but perhaps not) that's man made, and is proliferating in the world at large, essentially man has created life.  And then you've unleashed the demon, because you have no idea if the most successful/reproductive AI's are going to be parasitic to humans or not. Maybe the AI will do to us what we have done to many other species on the planet."

I think my first choice as a solution would be to ween and also make sure to replace his/her extra time with other activities. In a situation like this the goal would be to establish a balanced lifestyle again, not remove it completely. I think almost every parent's move would be to set time limitations first, but then you got this extra time where the kid is sitting there almost in pain because they forget what to do with themselves. A parent should then actively help them seek out other activities to keep the brain occupied.

The man in the video presented in this article was clearly resisting, and although what the cops did was not right, it could have been avoided. No matter how you put it, the cops have the means and will take you down if necessary. They have a taser, pepper spray and a gun. You should know when to give in and there is no point of getting yourself hurt by resisting.  If you are unlawfully incarcerated, resisting throws out your chance for proper retribution in the court. People who resist are usually at fault, and although I don't think cops should treat them like meat bags, I also can't say that they (the individual being detained) didn't bring it on themselves.  In short, if you are unlawfully arrested, don't resist, and then take them to court. Violence only brings violence, and resisting throws away your chance to win in the trial.  Just my two cents."

Shaming words for their meanings is WORSE. Trying to make some weird point by going at the very foundations of logic and communication is like scooping out your brains to make a point that you don't know anything.  Does the word 'slut' exist?  If the word slut exists, does it have a meaning?  What does the 'meaning of a word' mean? A consensus that means, when I say this word, you'll understand the same mental map as I have in my own head?  Let's quantify what the word means: A person (I've been called a slut, and was ok with it, I'm male) who has many casual sexual partners. Some sources put 'woman' here, which people then get to use as an excuse to make this misogynistic and therefore try and eradicate it.  So, we have a word for people with many sexual partners, in fact we have many words - so what the fuck, we should get rid of them? Sex isn't an important part of fucking humanity?

fascinating,2e75jt,quote88,1 point,Fri Aug 22 07:40:19 2014 UTC,Sort of. In a petrol engine the most common way to control engine speed is by controlling the amount of air the engine can draw in.   The engine is always trying to pull on more air and if it was allowed to do so it would just carry on accelerating until it blow up. To stop this a butterfly valve is uses to throttle the air coming into the engine (hence why its called a throttle). The air is then mixed with the correct ratio of fuel either using a carburettor or fuel injectors and then fed into the cylinder for ignition.  Does that answer your question?

fascinating,1pw26h,bg93,1 point,Tue Nov 5 03:50:27 2013 UTC,"They don't. They are simultaneously in all three blobs.

And when it interacts with something, like light that we send in to measure it, it condenses into a single ball-like particle. How? We don't know."
fascinating,1pw26h,bg93,1 point,Tue Nov 5 08:38:51 2013 UTC,"Ah yeah, the big question! It's only been partially settled by science, and I realized I couldn't say too much about it in the video without confusing matters =/ Anyway, the view that's most widely accepted by scientists is that the electron (as long as you don't disturb it) is the three blobs, it is the wave. It only becomes a hard little ball when it is forced to interact with its surroundings (like a detector, or an outside particle hitting it). Before that, it's just smeared across space around the proton, in the form of those blobs.  It's the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, and Einstein hated it. He disliked the statistical, random nature of the wave function, and he summed it up in his famous quote: ""I, at any rate, am convinced that God does not throw dice."""
fascinating,1pw26h,the_beat_goes_on,2,Tue Nov 5 08:39:07 2013 UTC,"Do we have any idea why the electron will end up where it does or why it chooses to collapse in one place instead of another?   The way I'm reading this now it sounds like the electron just pops around within those orbitals, do electrons experience ""motion"" in a traditional sense?  Finally, and this is completely unrelated but I cannot find a consistent answer, can things travel half of a Planck length? I've heard people describe them as ""pixels"" of the universe and I've heard people describe that as bullshit, I just want to know the answer.   Oh, and that video you made is fantastic by the way, I hope there's more to come!"
fascinating,1pw26h,hero0ftime,1 point,Tue Nov 5 23:38:36 2013 UTC,"Oh thank you! :) And I'm working on the next video yeah, I love making this stuff :)  And your first question is really cool, this was a big point brought up by Einstein. And there was in fact a lot of discussion about in the first decades of quantum mechanics.  When quantum mechanics was just being developed, it was Bohr and Heisenberg who started the Copenhagen interpretation, which basically says that the electron decides 'on its own whim' where exactly to appear in the wave function, and that we have no way of knowing in advance where that will be.  Einstein really didn't like this. He pictured the electron as being a hard little ball all the time, moving around on its own within the wave function. He saw the wave function as just an artifact of our own poor understanding of the electron. He called the hidden, unseen location/speed of the electron 'the hidden variable', and this interpretation Realism.  Unfortunately for Einstein, these two different interpretations were actually testable by experiment. In 1964, Bell showed that if there is a 'hidden variable' in a wavefunction, any wavefunction, then the results of measurements on it would be slightly different than if there was no such hidden variable. This was kindof an earthshaking discovery at the time, because Bell managed to say something about something completely unknown (the hidden variable).  Anyway, now they could do experiments to look for hidden variables, and because of that, check which interpretation was actually right. The experiments were done by Aspect in 1982, and they showed a clear result: There is no hidden variable, Einstein's Realism is not correct. After that, scientists began to really uphold the Copenhagen interpretation, because it appears to be the genuinely correct one. As fuzzy as it is, the electron really seems to decide on its own where to appear :3  But, the reason these questions haven't been completely settled is that there are still other intrepretations possible, other than the Copenhagen one. Things like the Many-World interpretation and the somewhat more radical Nonlocal Realism. So yeah, we keep looking :)  Your second question is actually cutting-edge, and hasn't been decided yet. Our best bet so far is that things can travel half a Planck length, we would just never find out it they did. A measurement can never exceed a certain accuracy, the Planck length is kind of a universal limit to how accurate we can do measurements. Things at the scale of the Planck length (or smaller?) would just appear...Planck-length to us. (So I guess you could call it the pixelsize of the universe, that doesn't sound so bad.)  It's actually a theoretical limit, we haven't run into it so far with any of our experiments. To put it into scale, a typical atom is 300 picometers, our experiments can see things nicely in the core of an atom (0.01 picometers), and if we really push our particle accelerators we can see to about 0.0001 picometers. But the Planck length is 0.000000000000000000000016 picometers, much smaller than we can see. Because of this, we haven't really run into any problems with it, but we also can't say anything really sensible about it yet.   But, these are the interesting questions of course, so we keep looking :)"

Name one thing your parents had plenty of but that you have to use sparingly if at all.  People have been assuming these major resource wars battles for the last fifty years and do you see anyone fighting China for resource acquisition?  Something being rare makes it valuable and if its valuable there is a monetary incentive to create something that fills the same role.  Since people like money they tend to attempt to take advantage of this.  This ignores the fact that humans, you know, do science.  Iron is incredibly rare on the planet, at least in a useful form.  Indigenous humans have been using metal from frickin asteroids as sources of iron for thousands of years, then humans developed the ability to make iron using science.  Same with aluminum.  Same with leaching gold using arsenic. Go read a Mad magazine from the 1970s, where they make jokes about Earth not being able to support more than 2 billion people.  Were nearly six billion over that because of, you know, science.  Remember ""peak"" oil? We were all going to run out of oil and gas and be plunged into a second dark age?  Oh right that was before we started finding MASSIVE fields of oil and natural gas almost everywhere on the planet.  The United States just overtook Saudi Arabia as the world's largest producer of oil.  Think about that for a second.

They aren't photos, they're computer-generated images, and the only reason they're ""four-dimensional"" is because they're CG and they can move them around and show the progression of time. The way it is presented leads people (like Sogmo) to believe they're actual photographs, and other people to think we have controlled the fourth dimension somehow.
