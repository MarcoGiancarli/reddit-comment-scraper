AltJ,3czuc3,lemons230,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:23:43 2015 UTC,"Yep! so reserved seating is like rows 25-60. It basically guarantees that you'll have a spot somewhere in there. General Admission, however, is rows 3-24 and rows 61-69. This, of course, is first come first serve. If you are there early enough you can get a could spot with Gen Admission, but it's risky if you're not gonna be there a few hours early.   My experience with reserved seating is that is where all the older people are, who set up blankets and/or bring dates. Being a 18-19 year old, I didn't really like it because I would rather be raging with the younger crowd in gen admission. It's a lot more mellow in reserved (little drug use ;) )"
AltJ,3czuc3,J-MRP,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:24:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for the excellent info! My wife and I are late 20's..but we basically just didn't want to have to show up hours early to get a good spot. We're also coming from SLC so we figured we'd just play it safe when we bought our tickets.   Wait so you can lay on a blanket in reserved? It seems like there's seats or something. We have a row and seat number and everything..
AltJ,3czuc3,lemons230,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:38:13 2015 UTC,"Here's an image of what the ""seats""  look like.  Your seat number is more of a plot number. Many bring blankets and lay them down (but I don't know how well they see). There's no chairs, just a square area that's yours   EDIT: P. S. Since you mentioned it. Keep in mind weed is legal in Colorado but you can't just bring weed into Red Rocks. They'll take it on entry. Of you're thinking about bringing some wear some compression underwear and just tuck it in. Or hide it in your shoe. Being that you're older I doubt they'll spend much time frisking you (it'll be like a pat on the arms and lower back) Once you're in, no one cares that you smoke as along as you aren't blowing it in people's face."

AltJ,3bawue,HankSinatra,2,Sat Jun 27 14:14:06 2015 UTC,He has big looping curls that don't really start to curl until they've reached a few inches. Basically if that's your natural hair texture you can pull it off but I don't know about styling it that way. Right now he's got the back and sides cut very short and leaves the top long and combs it back a bit. He seems to be using some kind of product to keep it in place.  Find a good picture of his hair where it looks great and ask a good hairstylist if they can do it.

AltJ,39xa32,Lokimonoxide,16,Mon Jun 15 15:35:42 2015 UTC,"I have been teaching English in Korea for a couple of years now and this is my favourite story from Nara.   I was playing with the deer in the park and I really only speak English and French fluently. So it was hard for me to communicate in Japan without defaulting to Korean as a force of habit. So I talked to the deer in Korean. I would tell the deer  음식 없어 (I don't have any food) or 하지마 (Stop it/Don't touch me). I kept talking to the deer in Korean for a laugh but I didn't realise that there was a Korean tour group 15m to my south. So, I have 35 Korean, middle aged people watching me speak Korean to a deer. Here is me, a 30 year old, white guy sepaking their language to a bunch of deer in Japan. Now I gotta show off. ""안녕 하세요, 일본 휴일 잘보내세요!"" (Enjoy your Japanese vacation). I imagine the last thing they thought that they would see was a Canadian guy speaking to Japanese deer in Korean. The looks on their faces was amazing."

The next day we were flying back home and lo- we see the entire band and crew sitting on the floor waiting at the same gate as we were! They were all super tired and only Joe was standing up talking to people. We approached him and spoke to him for some time, he was pretty humble and quite shy actually. They were going to Delhi to perform. We managed to get our drumstick and set lists signed by him. The whole thing was a pretty exciting experience!"
AltJ,39kgir,zeabagsfull,6,Fri Jun 12 18:23:07 2015 UTC,"I was really into 8tracks for a while (still occasionally find myself there to diversify my music). Anyway, I heard Fitzpleasure and Breezeblocks pretty often. Although I enjoyed those songs, I wasn't quite sold. At least I hadn't taken the time to look into them. Then I heard Dissolve Me and thought ""Wow, this is beautiful and I've been seeing this band come up quite a bit"". The very next song was Taro....  My life was changed forever. I heard the line, ""le photographe est mort. Three, point, one, four, one, five, alive no longer my amour."" I was smitten. Alt-j was the first band that I ever truly fell hard for. After showing them to a friend of mine she said that she felt Alt-j's music mirrors how she believes I think. And I feel that's true. The rising and falling melodic swirls, dissonant chords, unique sliding lyrics that are more like an instrument painting a story rather than telling one...Everything about Alt-j speaks to me as if they write their music just for me. And I've heard so many other fans say the same.   I went through a weird phase of my life in which I was using psychedelics multiple times a week. Alt-j's music in that situation...it's indescribable.   Anyway, thanks for letting me rant and share my love. I highly suggest that fans of Alt-j check out Glass Animals. Another really innovative group that has a similar yet distinctively different sound."

When he returned home, he was obsessed with playing what he kept referring to as ""the greatest album ever!"" I am a huge music fan and listen to a wide variety of genres. Having been exposed to A LOT of musical artists and acts, I was resistant to believe this band could be all he was claiming. Long story short, after exploring their music further, I have come to love and appreciate it greatly. Their tunes are infectious and, despite all the other tunes I have listened to lately, altj songs are usually the ones floating around in my head all day.

As you have a radio in the office, Listing to artists like Katy Perry, Taylor Swift and so on does get quite tiring but when someone like Alt J is on, as its not played massively elsewhere and that all the songs are different it gets a lot more play than other albums.  Also when us devs are given some free range to put what we want in, such as with the iTunes screen (I don't work for apple so I didn't do that) we put in what we like such film we like or so on. For example a project I'm working on at the moment (I cant say what it is yet - I will say when its announced) will have Alt-J, Bombay Bicycle Club album arts somewhere in the advertising material - that's planned anyway so it may be taken off and replaced..."
AltJ,37mlyf,Captaincadet,1 point,Sun May 31 12:37:43 2015 UTC,"I can see your point, but I'm just saying thay those types of things like alt-j being on a Sonu smartwatch as opposed to Apple has to deal with ownership rights and well-informed marketing techniques moreso than what a developer wants more often than not.  That said, some companies, like yours, may relay on the IT people to relay trends into their work as to provide insight to the higher-up, less knowledgeable people as to what is popular or trending amongst Millenials."
AltJ,37mlyf,I_JERK_OFF_IN_PUBLIC,1 point,Sun May 31 12:52:52 2015 UTC,Usually Bands like Alt-J and there labels are more than happy for us to use their album art as its seen as free adverting. We do get some control over what you see on the internet with marketing material as the Marketing designers are not usually specific of what they want to see - any album will do or what ever - they don't care unless if its something they really don't want to see.

The long standing community has led me to learn many things about older scenes for bands (roughly early 2000s). I can see how it's less useful for new bands comparatively, but what do you say?"
AltJ,36p82k,flintconfirmed,2,Wed May 27 08:31:24 2015 UTC,"Oh, I guess they can be okay sometimes but in my experience it's been less satisfying than Songfacts and Genius because people base their interpretations more on how a song makes them feel and don't include explanations of different little details or statements from the artists or anything. And I've seen people come up with some really weird meanings that make no sense at all because of it. Maybe it was the fan base music I was listening to a few years ago though. They were cool but a little odd."
AltJ,36p82k,birdsy-purplefish,2,Wed May 27 23:09:10 2015 UTC,Yep! Every song is like a puzzle and it's really fun to figure them out. Taro is about a photographer in the war that got his leg blown off by a land mine and is based off a true story. If you have any questions feel free to ask!

AltJ,365mg0,courtabee,2,Sun May 17 17:34:59 2015 UTC,"I've heard Something on High Album.  It's not really similiar to alt-J, vox is good but the music is kinda ""common"", maybe. It's easy-listening, an easy listening song wont last long (from my experience).  But, I like bodies, it's so alt-J at some parts especially the guitar play. Better Man than He is relaxing, chilling and I like it too. And I think this guy has a good message behind his music, he has a character. I like this kind of artist.  Thx anyway, Celiina! :D ~Lo Lo Lo Lo Lo Lo Lo Lo Lo"
AltJ,362bru,bloopityblah,6,Fri May 15 14:35:31 2015 UTC,"I'm from Kansas City and constantly listen to the Buzz. The Buzz is always looking for new artists to play and break into the industry and that is one of the things that helps them pull listeners. That's how The Wombats and many other bands also got their big break. I actually first heard of Alt-J through The Buzz when I heard Tessalate. So, in my opinion I fully believe The Buzz helped them reach their level of success that they have now. Alt-J now always draws huge crowds when they come to town like with the Buzz Beach Ball concert going on this year."
AltJ,362bru,Paulio8,5,Fri May 15 15:17:41 2015 UTC,"The Buzz broke them before anyone on either coasts? Also, they were a big deal in the UK well before their first album came out."
AltJ,362bru,Paulio8,5,Fri May 15 16:20:37 2015 UTC,I guarantee they were being played other places prior I just beleive that The Buzz gave them a healty push into radio play. Alt-J sure showed a big presence out in the midwest through them. I don't think it was only The Buzz that broke them I just think that they definitely helped them significantly more than hurt them. As far as the UK goes that's where Alt-J is from so it wouldn't surprise much at all if they were bigger out there before the US.
AltJ,35w3g4,00button,5,Thu May 14 00:14:44 2015 UTC,"I was there. Honestly,  I was disappointed it was an identical set to Melbourne last year at the forum... play one of the Intros god dammit! I feel like they could do a lot more experimenting on stage.  It's very much ""this is this song,  and this is that song, ok bye [city name]  you've been great."""
AltJ,35w3g4,Anderz,2,Thu May 14 22:37:37 2015 UTC,"you're not wrong with the lack of experimenting or ""this song that song"" but i enjoyed it quite a lot :)"

AltJ,35w3g4,wornmedown,5,Thu May 14 11:37:53 2015 UTC,I'm seeing them on Sunday and I'm beyond excited! 🙌 It'll be my second time seeing them and I feel like I still don't know what to expect.
AltJ,35w3g4,_motifs,3,Thu May 14 12:40:49 2015 UTC,I'm seeing them on Tuesday and I can't be more excited!!! You guys will hear about it I'm sure.
AltJ,35w3g4,TheOldGods,2,Thu May 14 11:11:11 2015 UTC,I didn't go last night. I saw the same show in Atlanta a couple months ago and I want to see it again.
AltJ,35suwa,wornmedown,14,Wed May 13 05:42:19 2015 UTC,BUT WHY?? They have such better songs I would love to play there!!

AltJ,35suwa,Noodle_,3,Wed May 13 19:06:51 2015 UTC,Thank god Im not the only one.. Although they said in a interview that the song was basicallly made in 20 minutes
AltJ,35suwa,_motifs,3,Wed May 13 13:14:43 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming it's because it's what majority of the people like? I mean they did make it so that it's more ""radio friendly"" or whatever.  I do agree that there are infinitely a lot of other songs I would rather play. Shame. Maybe in another GH or maybe an update/dlc. And lol imagine what the drums would be like for their songs? Haha"
AltJ,35suwa,xenfermo,9,Wed May 13 17:53:14 2015 UTC,Playing Taro with a roll of tape hitting the fret board. Opportunity missed
AltJ,35suwa,Towern,1 point,Wed May 13 22:19:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know if that's good or bad...  I think it's worst for guitar hero.   With all respect for the bands work, people shouldn't start knowing them with Left and Free. Come on, this song is alright but NOTHING like 'Alt-j'. But to be in guitar hero, that's the only one who works, the others everybody would find boring. Even me. Guitar hero it's a about rocking the living room!   But seriously, RIP guitar hero. After the third one (excluding metallica) it lost his power."
AltJ,35suwa,fabripav,2,Wed May 13 17:57:28 2015 UTC,"Did you really need to see Left Hand Free in the lineup to say ""RIP guitar hero""?"

AltJ,343uac,L3ED,4,Tue Apr 28 22:15:41 2015 UTC,I thought Hunger of the Pine was a great opener at their Raleigh show. It kinda fit the sound Tycho left the stage with. Plus seeing those blue lights pulse out of the dark was fucking crazy.
AltJ,343uac,NEOOMGGeeWhiz,3,Tue Apr 28 20:35:03 2015 UTC,I think that either of their intros would make a better intro than hunger of the pine. But it was good too as an intro.
AltJ,343uac,Whooptyd,4,Tue Apr 28 09:51:57 2015 UTC,"They opened with Intro (Nod to the Canon) at Reading Festival 2013 while I was there and it was fucking amazing. I suppose the two Intros aren't their most popular songs though, being that they are just meant to be introductions to the albums so thats why they're now opening with HoTP recently. Totally agree though, opening with Intro from TIAY would be incredible."
AltJ,343uac,aweinschenker,3,Tue Apr 28 12:10:25 2015 UTC,"AWA Intro is one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever. I can never get tired of it. Nothing could prepare me for hearing it live for the first time. Simply stunning.   Though I agree they now have more singles to fit in the show, they also like to keep things fresh. They changed the setlist order (adding the encore instead of finishing with Taro) on the AWA tour, so perhaps there's room for this setlist to evolve too. Will have to wait and see. Excited for everyone who's getting to see them live this summer."
AltJ,343uac,wolflambert,2,Tue Apr 28 22:19:53 2015 UTC,"They opened with HotP when I saw them at MSG last month, and I agree. Either into would've made for a better opening song."

AltJ,3388h2,EsseBn,3,Mon Apr 20 12:54:18 2015 UTC,"Cheapest (free) option: walking from Harbourfront MRT. It's about a 600m walk but there are travelators so it'll help a lil and you get a pretty nice view of Singapore. Plus there's free entry to Sentosa for now.  Other option: taking the Sentosa express from Vivocity, the mall at Harbourfront MRT. It's around 3 dollars round trip, I can't remember.  Both of these options requires you to find the hotel on your own so remember to get a copy of the map of Sentosa online. :)"
AltJ,3388h2,captainba,2,Tue Apr 21 03:58:53 2015 UTC,"Taxis are not that expensive here. Around where are you staying? A cab from the central area to Sentosa shouldn't cost you more than 10-15 SGD. Alternatively, walking from Vivo City mall/HarbourFront MRT (look for Sentosa boardwalk, it's the name of the, uh, boardwalk connecting Sentosa to Vivo City) should take about 15-20 mins and public transport here is cheap. Hard Rock hotel is pretty near the boardwalk exit. You can also take the Sky train from Vivo City 3rd floor, but it's 3 SGD plus the MRT fare. The MRT fare price by the way is very unlikely to be over 2 SGD unless you're staying in a location very far from downtown."

AltJ,326s3b,jcareno,9,Sat Apr 11 01:45:42 2015 UTC,"A close friend of mine suffers from panic disorder, thankfully it’s not as worse as it could be. His attacks are “infrequent but intense.” One day in the summer we were out on a field, talking about girls, sharing philosophies, the usual. I was just about to tell him how weird it was that every word in existance had a creator behind it, but when I turned to look, he was zoned out and breathing heavily. I asked him if he was alright. He pulls out his headphones and frantically chooses to play Bloodflood on his phone.  He told me “I’m sorry man, it’s the panic. I’m not trying to be rude. I’m not trying to ignore you, I’m trying to ignore myself.” I told him that it was alright. I was pretty shocked to see him like this but I remember him telling me once that it can’t harm him, but it feels like it will. I don’t know what was going on inside his head but he looked like he had trouble controlling it. I couldn’t imagine battle with my own brain. I asked him what he was listening to and he ripped out his headphone jack and turned his speakers up to full.  He started air drumming to the song. Really well actually, so well that I could imagine a drum set around him. From there I understood why he used music. It made him forget. He loses himself, and in turn, the panic. I’ve heard of stories of kids with devastating cases of tourettes and stutters using music to rid their afflictions but seeing it made it real for me.  “This song makes me feel like a robot.” He said. “It’s really authoritative. The beat is really strong and I always catch myself walking in time with it. When the song tells me to breathe, I breathe. When the beat stops, I stop.”  I told him “Nah man, you’re not a robot, you’re a soldier. Those are war drums.”  He carried on performing his well rehearsed dance. Hitting every snare and cymbal, marching to the beat, and pausing when the song told him to. He had memorized the exact duration of the silences, I know this because he moved his foot a beat early so that he could stamp when the drum came back in. Even on the long pause when I thought the song finished. I think the point was that he’s comfortable with the song.  He told me what the song meant. I asked him why he’d listen to a song about fear when he was in this state. “The irony makes me laugh”  I can't listen to the song without having an imaginary drum set around me any more."

AltJ,31f1ps,rahul047,-5,Sat Apr 4 16:57:41 2015 UTC,"He's literally awful in videos especially the talk show performances, but I went to their show and he was amazing. Not sure what the difference was. IMO the drummer is the weak link. He's ok, but just ok. He can't play left hand free live for shit."
AltJ,31f1ps,Sizzmatic,11,Sat Apr 4 19:18:50 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen in videos, he actually seems to be the one holding it together."
AltJ,31f1ps,moatcroc,9,Sat Apr 4 19:51:36 2015 UTC,"A drummer friend of mine said he probably is the most technically sound in the band.  I've got no clue, though."
AltJ,31f1ps,Sizzmatic,6,Sat Apr 4 21:49:00 2015 UTC,"If they have a ""thing"" like a secret weapon that makes them great it's not that they're virtuoso's but that they don't all need to be the center of attention constantly and they complement each other well. The drums stand out because he doesn't use cymbals which I found myself using less of lately and I'm glad because it brings clarity to the rest of the instruments. I always thought gus was very technically sound because I envy playing keys without looking. Obviously Joe is a talented guitarist but known for his vocals. Gwil/Cameron I'm sure are proficient but really what they do best is play what needs to be played and when the moment is right."
AltJ,31f1ps,Sizzmatic,2,Sat Apr 4 22:34:33 2015 UTC,"I agree all things being equal works well for them. Even if it seems like I'm not, I'm a huge Alt-J fan. I do think as a band they are in the top 5 out right now."
AltJ,31f1ps,WarmFoothills,2,Sat Apr 4 23:20:55 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm not really intentionally hating on the guy. It's a weird thing with me. He's phenomenal on records though.
AltJ,31f1ps,Sizzmatic,4,Sat Apr 4 22:33:20 2015 UTC,Lol what? The drummer is one of the best drummers in the world imo. Left Hand Free was fine every time I saw them live.
AltJ,31f1ps,Sizzmatic,3,Sat Apr 4 21:50:18 2015 UTC,I also wouldn't put the drummer in the top ten out right now even.
AltJ,31f1ps,xtroreddit,1 point,Sat Apr 4 23:17:33 2015 UTC,"Man every video I've ever seen, and when I saw them live he butchers the triplet run down the toms leading into the chorus to the point where it makes me cringe. Especially since the drums are so sick on the albums. I literally love his studio work. I've been a drummer since I was 4 and have been in drumlines and played set forever, I love playing along and learning his parts. He's phenomenal in the studio and mediocre live. I can't remember what song it was but when I saw them live even a non musician friend of mine was like wtf just happened there, he basically just lost where he was in the song."

AltJ,31f1ps,Flint_Westwood,3,Sun Apr 5 13:08:17 2015 UTC,The live concerts are much better than the live recordings. His voice is pretty solid live for the most part. Absolutely worth the money.

AltJ,31f1ps,Flint_Westwood,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:27:28 2015 UTC,No. He's right. I don't know what it is. I watched them live on YouTube a lot and was not impressed because it didn't sound best as good as the studio stuff. But I saw them recently live and they fucking killed it. Much much much better live than in the recordings.

AltJ,30y8vu,kt_e,4,Tue Mar 31 17:58:17 2015 UTC,"Based only on my experience at MSG last night, I would pay $100 for a ticket to see them again in a heartbeat. Their concert made my month. If possible, try and get floor seats, I was a bit further up but it  was still amazing"
AltJ,30y8vu,SlopeDude,4,Tue Mar 31 22:47:49 2015 UTC,"You gotta go, you will not regret it. Saw them last October and seeing them again in May, still blissful after their last performance. Without a doubt one of the best nights of my life.   I know a lot of people talk about their lack of 'presence', and yes they don't jump around the stage and dance, but would you expect them to do that while playing their music? They concentrate really hard, make excellent live music, AND they play all the songs you wanna hear. Hope you go!! Let us know how it was"
AltJ,30y8vu,255255255noise,2,Thu Apr 2 05:42:15 2015 UTC,$100?! I'm guessing that's about £60. We would not pay that for Alt-j over here. Have they exploded in the US?
AltJ,30y8vu,chilo_W_r,3,Tue Mar 31 23:25:00 2015 UTC,Yeah they're pretty big over here now. Definitely one of the more popular alternative bands from what I've seen. I paid around $90 for tickets and it was well worth it
AltJ,30y8vu,255255255noise,1 point,Tue Mar 31 23:37:19 2015 UTC,That's insane! Their tickets were only about £20 a short while back.
AltJ,30y8vu,chilo_W_r,2,Tue Mar 31 23:39:51 2015 UTC,I think the venue was selling them for like $35 though. I had to go through stubhub
AltJ,30y8vu,bergeronowitz,2,Tue Mar 31 23:43:06 2015 UTC,"I just saw alt-J last night at Madison Square Garden. I won floor seats from a contest, so I'm not sure how much they would've been, but I would have gladly paid $100+ for my ticket.  If you're seats are even remotely decent, you won't regret spending a good chunk of change. They sounded excellent. I've been to countless concerts and I'd put last night in my top five ever."
AltJ,30y8vu,crappyfriday,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:10:36 2015 UTC,"Definitely! I paid $80 for mine at MSG and I would definitely pay more to see them, it was one of the best concerts I've been to."

Changing the past can sometimes lead to a devastating future.   One of the most carefully crafted games I've played.  Just google it to find some more info.

Can anyone figure out how to get the magazine through iTunes and tell me if it comes with the EP when you do that? It's probably because I'm in the U.S. or something but when I click that link it just comes up blank."

AltJ,2zrlaw,JabberwockyJake,3,Sat Mar 21 14:38:51 2015 UTC,"Was it the first album, or the most recent one?   I'd really like to think it was the first one; Gwil, for some reason, strikes me as the kind of guy who has the magical power of being able to soothe people out of an unfortunate drug-related situation."
AltJ,2zrlaw,Flint_Westwood,4,Sat Mar 21 17:39:19 2015 UTC,It was both An Awesome Wave and This Is All yours. I needed a lot of musical help ahaha  Note: My favoured album of the two is An Awesome Wave. There's just something so magical and poetic about the lyrics and composition.
AltJ,2zrlaw,Flint_Westwood,-1,Sat Mar 21 20:09:03 2015 UTC,"I was totally enamored with This Is All Yours when I got it in the fall last year. But then I got This Is All Yours for Christmas, and I was pissed! The guys at Capitol Atlantic were basically like,    ""Yeah, so there are few of the lyrics from the last album that we really like a whole, whole lot...so you have to use them again. And there's something about this artwork that we just love, so you have to do all of it exactly the same as An Awesome Wave. The font has to be the same, the little symbol you've invented has to be used again, the multiple-exposure picture of all four bandmates has to be the same (except now there's only 3 of you), oh.. and Bloodflood..yeah, you have to do a second one of those.""   If it didn't have Left Hand Free on it, there's no way it would have been considered for Alternative Album of the year at the Grammys. #pandering"
AltJ,2zrlaw,Flint_Westwood,9,Sat Mar 21 23:53:50 2015 UTC,"While I really do like Left Hand Free, it is my least favourite of all their songs. It just doesn't seem like an Alt-J song to me. It's quite repetitive and the lyrics are much less poetic.  As I say, I do really enjoy it still, it just seems the odd one out.  nottryingtobeedgy"
AltJ,2zrlaw,Flint_Westwood,2,Sun Mar 22 00:03:36 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah. It's without a doubt the track that the producers made them write so that they could have one to feed to stadium crowds and the like. It's just a catchy, mainstream rock song."
AltJ,2zrlaw,Flint_Westwood,4,Sun Mar 22 00:05:42 2015 UTC,"My favourite song from the album has to be Nara, though. So freaking beautiful.  As for An Awesome Wave, it's a toss up between Taro or Interlude I (Ripe & Ruin)"
AltJ,2zrlaw,birdsy-purplefish,4,Sun Mar 22 00:22:19 2015 UTC,"The drum part for Nara repeats exactly 0 times, it's wonderful. It's between Nara and Every Other Freckle on This Is All Yours.  On An Awesome Wave, you're absolutely right. Taro and Interlude I are tied."
AltJ,2zrlaw,birdsy-purplefish,2,Sun Mar 22 00:42:45 2015 UTC,"Oh damn, I forgot about Every Other Freckle.  They some how make licking crisp packets and cats in beanbags sensual.  I think you're right about it Tying with Nara. Plus, it was the main song that helped me yesterday ahaha"
AltJ,2zrlaw,CudiHaze,3,Sun Mar 22 01:01:29 2015 UTC,"I just think it's so ridiculous that if they were from America, that lyric would be ""I want to lick you like a bag of potato chips."" Like what the absolute fuck?"

AltJ,2zk1r2,I_JERK_OFF_IN_PUBLIC,2,Thu Mar 19 23:22:16 2015 UTC,"Jungle is pretty cool.  It's in-line with the electro-funk revival realm of musicland right now.  They are also kinda similar to Alt+J in terms of band composition.  Check out this song, which has been featured in FIFA 15, I believe, in case you play, or this song.   EDIT: Just realized the first song I HL'd is the one mentioned by /u/bivsu."

I also just feel the funk influence from Ohio Players, etc.   Haven't been able to see them due to conflicts with their tour schedule, but I might find myself at a festival that they are at.  Have you seen them live previously?"
AltJ,2zk1r2,bivsu,2,Fri Mar 20 22:01:34 2015 UTC,Nope never been to an alt j or jungle concert. They are both supposed to be at coachella this year though
AltJ,2zk1r2,I_JERK_OFF_IN_PUBLIC,2,Fri Mar 20 22:15:53 2015 UTC,"I'm on the east coast otherwise, I would definitely be there this year with Tame Impala, Brand New, Circa Survive, Todd Terje, and many others there.    I'm going to Governors Ball and Austin Psych Fest, though.  Alt+J is pretty awesome live. I've seen them three times, and I found them to be super enjoyable.  Super Groovy."
AltJ,2zk1r2,bivsu,2,Fri Mar 20 22:26:18 2015 UTC,Is it more of a chill concert with everyone sitting or is it like a jump up and down and scream type? Alt J that is
AltJ,2zk1r2,I_JERK_OFF_IN_PUBLIC,1 point,Fri Mar 20 23:06:15 2015 UTC,"Hopefully, people will stand.  A lot of people in Beacon Theater did, including the entire left wing of orchestra seats, which was where mine were located.    Not many people were ""jumping up and down"" as if you were at a more rock infused show like a Modest Mouse.  It was more so that people either dancing with a partner in a real low-key manner or people were jamming to themselves with the grooves of the music.  However, if I'm dancing like that to myself at shows like Alt+J, Tame Impala, etc., I'm lost in it.  Thus, it could have been more mild with the dancing.  People are definitely more into singing along than anything at Alt+J shows, so that creates a nice atmosphere in terms of crowd energy and involvement removing the potential stale energy from a lethargic performance."

Vincent, Bastille, calvin harris and many others, and me and my girlfriend agreed that Alt-j was the highlight of our weekend, the sound was absolutely gorgeus and they let the music do the show, I dont think I heard joe speak once which was odd but cute in a way.  Ive seen here many times that they dont sound as good when they are playing live. and tomme at least that cant be further from the truth.  Also st. Vincent was our second best show, shes fucking great live."
AltJ,2z8mca,dirntbag,3,Wed Mar 18 01:08:05 2015 UTC,"That's so nice to hear! Whenever I've seen livestreams of their concerts I've thought the same - their sound gives me chills, even more-so live than their CDs, and Joe is supremely cute with his little shy smiles!"

It's a lyrics database that shows a brief resume of the songs meaning as well as part of interviews with the band where they talk about it to support it.  It's not 100% accurate, it doesn't analyse every sentence in the song but gives you an idea for you to work with, I mean, that's the beauty of it. Free interpretation.

Also I can really relate to the ""growing-on-me"" feeling, lots of people I know say the exactly same thing."

AltJ,2xokoe,Duffman-,2,Thu Mar 19 13:22:09 2015 UTC,"I'll give a brief description:  Gerda Taro was a war photojournalist in the late 40's/early 50's. She died in her line of work when a tank collided into the side of a car she was riding on. The other important name in this song was Gerda's colleague, Robert Capa. During the First Indochina War, Capa retreated from his Jeep in a hostile war zone to take pictures. He stepped on a landmine however, which blew apart his left leg. He was taken to a medical station where he died with his camera in his hand.  When Green heard of this story he was captivated, and when he learned that Capa and Taro were in fact lovers aswell, he felt he had to write this homage to their tragic romance."
AltJ,2xg3be,rahulbatra91,8,Sat Feb 28 08:37:19 2015 UTC,About one hour. They basically perform most of their songs and that's it.
AltJ,2xg3be,Dw0,3,Sat Feb 28 13:37:16 2015 UTC,"I have read from other people that they don't have a ton of stage presence, like they don't talk. Did you find that they just played the songs and then left?"
AltJ,2xg3be,Alissamelody,6,Sat Feb 28 21:29:10 2015 UTC,"They don't talk much, true. For me, though, the gig was quite involving experience. But I like them a lot. That helps."
AltJ,2xg3be,Dw0,3,Sat Feb 28 21:34:03 2015 UTC,I really like them as well and will be seeing them in April. Thanks for your answer!
AltJ,2xg3be,Alissamelody,2,Sat Feb 28 21:35:22 2015 UTC,"They talked quite a bit when I saw them at the O2 last month, maybe it depends where they're performing."
AltJ,2xg3be,thegreenpiglet,2,Sat Feb 28 22:46:35 2015 UTC,"I'll be seeing them at the Santa Barbara bowl, which is a smaller outside venue. I hope they have good stage presence, but the music is what I'm there for ultimately. I have heard they are great live music wise, and from what I have watched on Youtube."
AltJ,2xg3be,Alissamelody,2,Sat Feb 28 23:01:36 2015 UTC,I second this. They talked a fair bit when I saw them at Alexandra Palace back in September. It could be due to location.
AltJ,2xg3be,hmandude,6,Fri Mar 6 20:09:51 2015 UTC,Hour to an hour and a half.  Not much stage presence but they have a great light show (and music) to make up for it.  They're cool dudes. None of the cheerleading or cheesey crap some bands try to pull.
AltJ,2xg3be,-internets,2,Sat Feb 28 22:27:47 2015 UTC,"When they were in Oslo a week ago, their show lasted for about an hour."
AltJ,2x33h8,Stoked32,7,Wed Feb 25 06:13:28 2015 UTC,"Two quick designs I just created - I don't know if the grainy/dotted look is what you were picturing exactly but it's the best I could come up with atm. The fonts can be easily changed, of course.  Edit: Here's another version of the second design"
AltJ,2x33h8,zombie_and_loft,2,Wed Feb 25 21:47:06 2015 UTC,"THEY'RE BOTH AWESOME! It's so crazy when an idea that was in my head ends up on paper! Now, the only thing to do is to find a way to simplify the artwork inside the delta.   Bravo to you man, I love it."
AltJ,2x33h8,zombie_and_loft,2,Wed Feb 25 21:52:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'm glad you like them! Maybe the artwork can be further simplified by just filling the ""land"" parts of the delta purple and leaving the ""river"" parts empty, if that makes sense. I don't know if it would still be recognizable as the album cover though"
AltJ,2x33h8,_BigBucketWull,1 point,Thu Feb 26 15:08:49 2015 UTC,"Damn, both are cool, but I really like the second one."
AltJ,2x33h8,zombie_and_loft,2,Thu Feb 26 14:11:46 2015 UTC,Thanks! I feel like the second one would look better with thinner lines because the font is so dainty/delicate. I'm gonna draw up a new version if I have some time tonight
AltJ,2x33h8,effingmarlee,1 point,Thu Feb 26 15:04:00 2015 UTC,What font did you use?

AltJ,2x33h8,effingmarlee,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:55:57 2015 UTC,Thank you! I actually found a software yesterday that could figure out the font for me. I love it (not impact)
AltJ,2x33h8,howfastisgodspeed,3,Wed Jun 10 01:38:18 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm definitely a rookie, but enjoy designing stuff like this for fun, so I'll take a swing at it. What kind of font are you looking for? Also, I'm not sure how well the detail from the cover will transfer to a tattoo, but I'll draw it up anyway."
AltJ,2x33h8,howfastisgodspeed,3,Wed Feb 25 06:48:03 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the fact that I actually got a response. Anything would help. And I didn't choose a font because I almost wanted it to look free handed.  Also, it's hard for me to describe what I meant by the album cover creating the delta, but, I'm imagining the purplish tone with cracks... if that makes sense. But, you're more than welcome to run with whatever you think looks good!   Thank you so much!"
AltJ,2x33h8,ljg2305-uk,2,Wed Feb 25 06:54:35 2015 UTC,"Okay, well I just kinda threw something together real quick on my iPad, but here's what I put together. Let me know what you think. I was able to pull the font that alt-J uses off of the Internet, but it doesn't really have the free-hand look that you were going for."
AltJ,2x33h8,howfastisgodspeed,2,Wed Feb 25 07:05:45 2015 UTC,"I'm mean yea, that's the idea! It's cool to see something in your head on paper. What do you think the text would look like if it was on a thin line of the delta? (The one on the left) Would it be out of place??   Do you think the two thin lines could be thiner? And I saw a cool design online that had gaps where the lines meet that I was interested in.  http://imgur.com/EqLE74F  Do you think that would come across well in a tattoo?  Thank you for helping me out, I appreciate it!"
AltJ,2x33h8,howfastisgodspeed,3,Wed Feb 25 14:45:41 2015 UTC,How about this?? http://imgur.com/Y3peomY
AltJ,2x33h8,howfastisgodspeed,2,Wed Feb 25 17:59:37 2015 UTC,"I like the idea, but I'm starting to agree with godspeed in the idea that the album cover being the actually design probably won't end up working out.  If you have any other ideas please feel free to voice them. I'm building off of everyone's opinions on this thread."
AltJ,2wyp44,howfastisgodspeed,3,Tue Feb 24 06:16:14 2015 UTC,"Their body language is kinda funny to me. When one of them talks the other two look down really shyly.

Alabama had a law against gay marriage as well. This line plays against ""Love is the warmest colour"" pretty well too, as Blue is the Democratic color on voting maps, and Red is republican.   Of course, lyrics are always open to interpretation, but to me this is the most likely explanation."

Either way, definitely a great show.   Edit I feel like it would be a little odd to play to a foreign crowd.

It speaks to me on so many levels personally and connects to struggles in my life between myself and certain other family members. It means something different to me every time I listen to it, there's a sense of a driving force behind it, a desperation to go forward, like fighting through a crowd, or running through mud, or pushing through thick foliage in a forest. A need to just get somewhere. Hard to explain, but I definitely know how you feel.  Every time shit hits the fan, I listen to that song as a kick in the butt in a way as well. It's a song that encompasses anger, resentment, despair, and mourning, but also resolve.  I hold it akin to the Five Stages of Grief, in song form."

That's what I get from the last chorus, those memories of attachment and such.  Much of their music has emotional value, I think that's one of the reasons they are so incredible. So good."
AltJ,2thy2s,schiefer740,5,Sun Jan 25 09:35:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing. Whenever I hear Intro (from aaw) it takes me back to a very specific part of my life and my stomach drops. Not in a bad way, it's more due to emotional reasons than anything. And then as I go through each song I'm reminded of different events because I was able to relate to each song at different times of my life depending on what I was going through.  And now it's happening all over again with tiay and I'm loving it. At times the connection is as vague as this post, but sometimes it's much stronger and I'll probably never stop getting those feelings whenever I listen to their songs. That's why I love alt-J."

Followed by a random combination of Modest Mouse, Kings of Leon, Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, and Portugal. The Man (I guess that's 6)   I feel like it's frowned upon to place a ""new"" band like alt-J ahead of bands like Zeppelin and The Beatles, but I really think I still have to put them first.   I've never been hooked on a band like I have them, I would say the Beatles are a perfect tie but a little behind alt j. I had a friend give me a burned copy of AAW around the middle of 2012 and said to give it a shot. The second i got out of class I put it in my cars CD player and didn't know what to expect.....mid way through the CD I had no idea what language I had been listening to and still didn't know what to expect next but holy shit I was hooked. And I literally didn't take it out for about a year and half.(only because I got my truck and now had an AUX cord) So almost 3 years later they are still a daily listen.   I'm not sure where this is going so I'm going to wrap it up but yeah, alt j is number for sure.  Edit: it's sweet seeing the variety of music everyone listens to, yet alt j finds their way on to the list"

AltJ,2ryqga,BottlesEmpty,9,Sun Jan 11 02:13:17 2015 UTC,Totally agree with you on Bloodflood pt 2. It's perfect and makes me feel a ton of different emotions. Both Bloodflood and Bloodflood pt 2 have such a good buildup.  I also love Leaving Nara and Choice Kingdoms.
AltJ,2ryqga,TheyCallMeToasty,4,Sat Jan 10 18:55:04 2015 UTC,I saw them live in November and they played blood flood part 1 right into part 2. It was my favorite part of the show.
AltJ,2ryqga,Megmadon,2,Sun Jan 11 03:25:15 2015 UTC,"No one has said Matilda yet. I think it's up there with Breezeblocks and Taro as one of my favorites. It really showcases Joe's voice, not to mention the soothing guitar as well."
AltJ,2ryqga,eliseeem,2,Sun Jan 11 10:45:39 2015 UTC,"I can't pick just one. Taro gives me the biggest feels and honest to god gives me flashbacks to when I first heard it/fell in love with Alt-J.   Pusher is beautiful and has so much emotion in it and I connect it with a life-altering night for me so it ranks high up there.   Dissolve Me is just a fucking awesome song. Definitely one of their best songs live, it just invokes a certain feeling in me everytime I hear it.   aaannnddd Bloodflood and Bloodflood Pt. II I don't think they even need explaining. Actually none of the songs do, but these even more. Ugh I love them."

AltJ,2ry27p,jcareno,4,Sat Jan 10 07:31:18 2015 UTC,"I think alt j are definitely a put- earphones-on-and-let-everything-sink-in type of band. They definitely tend to fuck up a lot of their songs when playing live but I think that goes with the territory of the type of music they make. Which makes a lot of the songs harder to play live or sound kinda crappy live.  That being said I still enjoy their live shows, even when it doesn't sound great or someone makes a mistake. It reminds me of how normal they are and that they are just a bunch of artist guys doing what they love.  I also think that they are constantly trying to catch their creativity when it comes to live shows, AAW was difficult to play live, bcz it was so out there.  TIAY is even more out there bcz these guys are always trying new shit, therefore even harder to play. Have u seen bloodflood pt2 live? The band really works to make it sound right. So as alt j pushed their studio music to a new level it became harder for them to push their live shows to that level. Maybe they kinda have their sound in check atm so I don't know if the future will bring the same challenges. Plus they are learning to get better at live shows obviously.   Moral: I don't know, whatever"
AltJ,2ry27p,akhil02,2,Sat Jan 10 14:52:47 2015 UTC,"The few videos of them playing live, I think it was Ok, it wasn't bad, but Hunger Of The Pine is the one that it's always a little disappointing"
AltJ,2ry27p,chilo_W_r,1 point,Sat Jan 10 18:50:51 2015 UTC,"I was afraid going into their concert this Fall because the live videos sounded bad, but in person it was incredible and they did a great job opening with Hunger of the Pine."
AltJ,2ry27p,xNateDawg,2,Sat Jan 24 23:17:11 2015 UTC,"Lately, I agree with you, but I saw them live back in 2013 and the show was amazing so it's weird that they have kinda gone downhill in their live performances since then."
AltJ,2ry27p,peanutbuttervibess,3,Sat Jan 10 15:21:35 2015 UTC,I agree with you. When I saw them live they opened with it and it was really weak. The show became progressively better but I still think that playing live is not their strong suit
AltJ,2ry27p,green_lemons,2,Sun Jan 11 03:40:33 2015 UTC,"First time I heard it live, it was a really weird choice for opening their set. I would think they would start with ""Bloodflood Pt. II"" or ""Dissolve Me"", and the second time, they played HOTP and skipped ""Taro"" completely.   Just weird."
AltJ,2rt76c,CaptainNemo_,4,Fri Jan 9 01:52:14 2015 UTC,"I was happy to pay for This is All Yours. It was cheap for the many hours of enjoyment I have had listening to it. If you live in a country with no access to the media you want, then pirate it, otherwise give the artists their credit due."

I was hoping for someone like Muse, The Black Keys or Foo Fighters (super typical and generic, I know). I would like to see Chet Faker, Kimbra, Glass Animals and Milky Chance.  I wonder what surprise artists will drop in.   I swear if I didn't go and the FFs showed up I would be fucking pissed  Edit for clarity"

AltJ,2qa9r9,Gablovescirca,6,Wed Dec 24 15:53:16 2014 UTC,"I've seen Alt+J at a variety of venues.  It seems they draw all ages.  Once at a music festival, once at central park (so standing), and once at beacon theater (seating, but everyone stood).  If you let the crowd bother you then that is on you dooder :)  This isn't terminal 5 (if you know the venue, then you know what I mean by that), so people who pay to go to the Garden typically go for the band.  Thus, the age of the crowd shouldn't bother you.  As for an Alt+J crowd... PEOPLE FUCKING LOVE THIS BAND. So, everyone there will know pretty much all of the words.  As far as I'm aware, they aren't blowing up on the radio from this album, so it should be the niche crowd as per usual.    GA is more expensive.  In my experience, they split the GA into East and West GA, and you want West GA if you want to be close to the stage while standing.  Otherwise, you might as well sit.  That is, of course, if you don't plan on smoking weed.  If you do, in fact, plan on smoking weed, your best bet is to head down into the GA.  Some ushers don't care and some do, so that is always a luck of the draw situation.  Best of luck.  Peace and love."

Then he can go purchase their second album and appreciate it even more.   I think it helps to know their first album to truly enjoy and appreciate the second. I've never gave anyone An Awesome Wave and they not love every song on it and get enchanted by the album.   Final answer, AAW! He'll love it."

AltJ,2p61f1,peanutbuttervibess,3,Sat Dec 13 12:05:14 2014 UTC,How was Wrex this year? I missed out unfortunately but last year's show was one of the best I've ever seen
AltJ,2p61f1,peanutbuttervibess,3,Sat Dec 13 21:40:51 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I would be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed in a couple of ways, even though it was alot of fun and alt-J was awesome.   I've been going to Wrex since 2010, and every year has had a really solid lineup and a great headlining band. 2010 was absolutely incredible,  and 2013 was the best alt-J show I have seen by far (before Gwil left).    So when I read the lineup, I was a little confused because it just seemed like such a random group, and a couple I had never even heard of (Banks, Schizophonics). Plus I was under the suspicion that a surprise guest would show up. There was no way the lineup could really be that short. And Cage the Elephant isn't really a headlining band to me, in comparison to Queens of the Stone Age and Smashing Pumpkins.   So I bought my presale ticket, got there four hours early, waited in line, did the whole deal.   Not much to say about the Schizophonics, Banks was strange (the bass volume was so high, you couldn't hear her) and reminded me of another Lorde-type singer. Spoon was good, and so was Interpol, but not alot of energy onstage.   Billy Idol killed it though, his lead guitar guy was great. Wish they could have played more.   So I was ready for alt-J to start, and they announced a surprise guest. I was hoping for a bigger band like Arctic Monkeys or at least a solid rock group, someone to kick up the energy.  They brought Vance Joy onstage, where they spent most of the time talking, and then he only played two songs and left again. It was nice (he is very talented), but really random.   What disappointed me was that Vance seemed to have cut into  alt-J's set time. It was a much shorter set than it should have been. They didn't even get to Taro, and this was the third best I have ever seen them. What they did perform was very good.  Cage the Elephant was awesome, but it was my third time seeing them, and I still prefer their 2013 performance.   Was it fun? Of course!    But if alt-J had not been in the lineup, I probably would have skipped going this year."
AltJ,2p61f1,imgettingbetternow,3,Sat Dec 13 23:54:14 2014 UTC,"Thank you for such a detailed description! I also saw Alt J at SOMA so I guess I didn't miss out too much. And honestly, though I love them dearly, they have very little stage presence and generally sound much better in their studio versions. I do regret missing out on Cage the Elephant and Billy Idol though. Billy Idol was a bit of a misfit in this lineup but I'm glad to hear he killed it. Hopefully next year we'll get a great headliner!"
AltJ,2p61f1,fabripav,0,Sun Dec 14 05:19:12 2014 UTC,"I am the biggest alt-j fan on the planet. Honest to god. Their set at Bellyup 2 years ago was incredible, love both their albums, can play all their songs. They're fucking genius.  But last night was one of the biggest disappointments I've ever had at a concert. I was shocked that people applauded - were they even listening?  Half a dozen wrong notes per song - strange sounds throughout each piece and the singer was still in his pajamas - didn't say one word outside of a lyric and had his guitar off and was disappearing back stage before the last note of the set had concluded.   I spent the entire set thinking this is it. Alt-J hate their touring lives, hate their fans and don't want to do this anymore.  What, in your opinion, made this incredible? From what I've seen in the  past they were amazing and everything you described would have been spot on. But last night, I didn't feel any magic. :("

AltJ,2p32yi,selfindex,4,Fri Dec 12 15:35:02 2014 UTC,"In Spotify sessions, the sound engineers usually don't try to correct the vocal track as much because they want to capture the live, acoustic sound. I think the fact that it's not so perfect gives it that raw feeling. Also, during their live shows they use pitch correction in vocal processing (just as almost all major touring artists do), and you also have to consider the fact that we can't tell all the minor differences through 1000w+ soundsystems. Alt-J makes it more about their music and not about putting on a show. I saw them in StL a couples weekends ago and Meg Meyes opened for them and she put on a damn good show. But outside of live music, her music is just pretty unappealing to me."

If you put on a show, make sure you can actually put on a show and do it well. If they have a hard time making specific songs sound nice live, they could just skip them too... Anyway, I'm just disappointed because I'm in love with the vocals on the records. :("

AltJ,2ovd0b,-internets,1 point,Thu Dec 11 17:50:13 2014 UTC,"I actually did a whole 25 minute segment on the album on my radio show last night.   Basically what I narrowed it down to is that all of the first half of the album is ""that average U2 sound"" where nothing really stands out. Everything on it is very well written, the band is great together, but there's nothing really interesting about it, because it's the same sound we've been hearing since All That You Can't Leave Behind in 2000, almost 15 years ago!  The second half has a few interesting songs (Cedarwood Road stands out), but it's very much the same as the first half.   Overall, the album picks up right where No Line On The Horizon left off. A few moments of brilliance, but overall, it's just that average U2 sound.  What sets it apart and makes it something I think every U2 fan or student of music should be aware of, is every song has a much deeper and personal meaning to the band. For instance, The Miracle (Of Joey Ramone) was written about Bono's love for the Ramones growing up. Iris (Hold Me Close) was written for his mom who died when he was 14, leaving him with his dad. The two didn't have a great relationship at all. Cedarwood Road is the road that Bono grew up on, and you can literally hear the leftover angst in his vocals and the music.   Musically, it's all well written and produced, but not terribly interesting. The deeper significance is very interesting, but not quite enough to make this album worthy of being named Rolling Stone's best album of the year.  You with me on this or nah? I think the article Rolling Stone published emphasizes the deeper significance of each song a lot better than I did above, but my point still stands does it not?"

I saw them with Gwil once before and I was a little hesitant as to how their shows would be without him, but it was amazing in every aspect. They were interactive with the crowd, they were having a noticeably good time (Thom especially) and they sounded even better than studio in my opinion. After watching youtube videos I expected Hunger of The Pine to sound a little off at least, but nope, beautiful.   And as for the people asking about getting pictures and autographs they're 100% cool with it. Like the other post said, there were about 20 or 25 people waiting outside for about an hour after the show. When the band came out no one rushed or went crazy, there was applause of course but it was all very orderly, which I think made them even more open to signing and pictures. They hung out for a good amount of time, made sure everyone who waited got what they wanted. And they were very chatty and down to Earth.   Not trying to sound like a fangirl, just wanting anyone who has any doubts about going to an Alt J show for any reason to GO. They were killer and it definitely made me realize why they are my favorite band.  Also, I have a few more pictures if anyone is interested."

In ""Hunger of the Pine"" live, Cameron plays the samples on a drum pad. Which means he can't play the bass... So there goes one part. The singing (bless their hearts, I still love them) is almost never in tune when Alt-J is live. So there goes another part.

I thought the same thing going in, but youtube just does not do them justice.  I've seen them 4 times, and this was by far the best i've seen them.  They got progressively better throughout the show, and Hunger of the Pine is an excellent opener.  They also put on a hell of a show, and are a lot of fun live.  That said, they are much better in enclosed venues (i've seen them twice indoors and twice outdoors) where people are close together and they can really create an atmosphere."

AltJ,2msttm,nurkhz,3,Wed Nov 19 22:13:07 2014 UTC,"Hmm.. not sure we're talking about the same thing.   Only found one live track and it was recorded at Sirius XM.   I'm talking about bringing in my own rig and doing a stereo recording.  Just audio.  I'm going to record it regardless, just want to know if I can get permission bring in something large or if I have to go stealth.   This is kinda what it looks like when a band allows recording: section behind sbd here"
AltJ,2msttm,fabripav,2,Thu Nov 20 04:34:55 2014 UTC,I'd say you should go stealth.

AltJ,2mshrt,grassmakesmilk,3,Wed Nov 19 19:32:54 2014 UTC,really?  didn't see it.  this is exciting!
AltJ,2mshrt,thescientist13,4,Wed Nov 19 22:21:21 2014 UTC,"I was there as well and it was incredible!   It was my 4th time seeing them and this was by far a different band than I saw on the previous tour.  A more confident and mature stage presence backed by an epic new album seems to be serving them well.  Also... The light show!   Incredible, it really captured the mood of all their songs.  Especially the red as they played hunger of the pine and the great visuals during Fitzpleasure.  Really good show, really good show..."

AltJ,2mshrt,eliseeem,3,Thu Nov 20 19:00:32 2014 UTC,Was also impressed with Thom's power on the drums. Surprised he didn't destroy his snare.

AltJ,2mrlps,driftvelocity,2,Sun Nov 23 23:29:25 2014 UTC,It's because of this band I've been researching headphones and DAC's for the past couple months.  The first thing I'm going to buy when my Sennheiser's come in the mail is Awesome Wave from HD Tracks since it's sample rate is way higher than CD quality.  Very excited to hear some extra nuances.

AltJ,2mrlps,deadbeforeitsank,2,Wed Nov 19 15:15:33 2014 UTC,For sure.  There are some crazy amazing sounds in the background of Choice Kingdom and Gospel of John Hurt that don't come through on average/below average speakers.
AltJ,2mrlps,grassmakesmilk,2,Wed Nov 19 20:15:32 2014 UTC,I know exactly what you mean. I just got into them a few weeks ago and I have some pretty nice headphone (V-moda m-100s) and you can every single sound. All the faintest taps in the backround and the low tones that I never knew were even there when I was using my usual speakers.

AltJ,2mev6w,modehead,2,Sun Nov 16 15:11:07 2014 UTC,A guy named Mikky Ekko opened for them in Philly. I assume he will open for them in NYC. He wasn't what I expected but he had a great voice. I looked him up after the concert and I liked his live performance way more than any of his recorded stuff.

AltJ,2magnh,Blaze6181,17,Fri Nov 14 21:33:27 2014 UTC,OH MY GOD.  The band name is technically a delta.  The cover art is a delta.  Learning things is so much fun.

AltJ,2m6onn,hell_yeah_enchiladas,9,Thu Nov 13 15:10:34 2014 UTC,"Update:  I found the answer in this interview here  ""STEREOGUM: How did you settle on This is All Yours as the album title?  UNGER-HAMILTON: It was really quite easy really. I think we saw it on a painting, which was really just a painting with “This is all yours” written on it. I think we were talking about using it as our album cover, then we were like, “Well then maybe we should call the album This Is All Yours. It’s a nice title, it has a nice ring to it.” Then we didn’t use that painting, but we kept the title."""
AltJ,2m6onn,Gercke,3,Thu Nov 13 18:32:07 2014 UTC,"I believe it's from their Thank You section for the album.  The last line is something like, ""And to all our wonderful fans, This is all yours."""
AltJ,2m6onn,BoboShanti91,3,Thu Nov 13 18:23:55 2014 UTC,I could have sworn that I read that it was a dedication to Gwil. I think it was in the blog that Thom wrote about why Gwil chose to leave the band.
AltJ,2m6onn,Kruttekrax,3,Sun Nov 16 16:49:42 2014 UTC,This is all yours is the title of the artwork used as the album cover I believe

It was human, flashy, just... Great. It was Alt-J.   Side note, their opener was the worst part. Mikky Ekko or something. Just... Not good. Very not-Alt-J."
AltJ,2lz2n3,whitemithrandir,3,Tue Nov 11 17:05:33 2014 UTC,"I would personally say not. I saw them very recently, and had the same reaction as you did - that they were fairly good, but didn't really make it worth it with their performance. Certainly not worth $100 in my book. The opener I saw was not Mikky Ekko but was also pretty bad."

AltJ,2lyxvu,FingerLicknGood,7,Tue Nov 11 15:07:29 2014 UTC,"Did we see the same guy? I was up in the Loge Seats by the balcony, and by the time his third song came, the whole crowd up there was done with him. He sounded like Bruno Mars trying to sing like Rhianna in an Imagine Dragons song. His lyrics made no sense, and his songs were the standard Verse, Chorus, Verse, Chorus, get quiet, Chorus X2. My girlfriend said it best: ""This is the most un-Alt-J guy ever."" He sang like 4 of the same type of love song, and his ""best"" one was clearly written to be in the top 40."

Imagine Bruno Mars trying to sing like Rhianna with The XX guitar samples and Imagine Dragons song style. It's worse than it seems. But! It made me yearn for Alt-J even more.

The guy said paint was glued to the front and the more you wash it the softer it gets. There's nothing on the back.  The other CD and tshirt on the bottom right were for the opening band The Acid."

AltJ,2juyyx,cmars118,8,Tue Oct 21 04:38:52 2014 UTC,Musically they are super tight and sound great - but they have little energy or stage presence.  I'm glad I didn't buy tickets to their show in Van.
AltJ,2juyyx,bangin_corners,1 point,Tue Oct 21 14:19:24 2014 UTC,damn. i thought about buying tickets for their show in Van but resale they were like $120+ each

AltJ,2juyyx,eftj,5,Tue Oct 21 09:09:45 2014 UTC,Obviously there's variations into how well they perform. but I saw them recently on the TIAY tour and thought they were better than the AAW show at Reading 2013.
AltJ,2juyyx,Bullsfan13,4,Tue Oct 21 08:37:48 2014 UTC,"That's good news, glad to hear that!"
AltJ,2juyyx,tessalasset,1 point,Tue Oct 21 11:39:53 2014 UTC,"Yep. Bearing in mind that they're show at Reading 2013 was one of the most memorable experiences of my life. They just sound better on the TIAY tour, IMO."
AltJ,2juyyx,Bullsfan13,3,Tue Oct 21 12:48:02 2014 UTC,"The show at the Greek tonight was... boring.  I understand that it is difficult to play new music, but this just didn't sit right with me.  They were just off at times.  Disappointing, as I had been looking forward to today for months :/"
AltJ,2juyyx,tessalasset,3,Tue Oct 21 05:58:58 2014 UTC,"Dude this is my experience EXACTLY. I just came into this sub to talk about this. It was my sixth time seeing them and not even close to the best. I had been looking forward to this for months...seriously thought it was gonna be my show of the year. But yes...something was off. It was boring, exactly. I mean I wouldn't quite say boring but it definitely felt phoned in at times. All I kept thinking was ""they're not an outdoor/big venue band."" It made me happy I didn't get my brother tickets at MSG cause that's gonna be even worse. Nara was by far the best song, and I honestly did enjoy that one a lot and thought it sounded great. It's still just so heavy on their older material, it feels. I'm glad I wasn't the only one to feel this way. I gotta say, I almost think The Acid were better than them. Acid completely blew me away. I went in with high expectations for them and they went above and beyond. I wish I got tickets to their Masonic Lodge show tomorrow cause they're gonna have a light show this time."
AltJ,2juyyx,tessalasset,1 point,Tue Oct 21 16:10:28 2014 UTC,"The acid was quite good.  I had only listened to one of their songs before, ""fame"" I think it was, and they were solid.  I saw alt j at the Palladium and it was 10 times better.  They are most definately a small, indoor venue band"
AltJ,2juyyx,Bullsfan13,1 point,Tue Oct 21 16:34:46 2014 UTC,"Oh shit I forgot about the Palladium show. I guess last night was actually my seventh time seeing them. Nothing will ever beat The Echo for me. Show didn't even sell out til the day of, everyone was in such a good mood, crowd was gettin DOWN, guys sounded perfect. But duh you can't compare a show like that to a show like this. I remember even being a little bummed out at the Palladium show cause it was so big. Hahaha damn I really am just a music snob."
AltJ,2juyyx,tessalasset,1 point,Tue Oct 21 16:38:10 2014 UTC,"Oh but one thing I really do need to include - I think Cameron is a great addition to the band. A lot of the songs last night sounded slightly different, and each time I looked over to him and noticed him playing some cool new part on the bass. I was definitely digging him."
AltJ,2juyyx,The_Spectator,2,Tue Oct 21 16:40:19 2014 UTC,"Hmm interesting, that really is a bummer. I'll be seeing them tomorrow in LA so I guess I'll be finding out for myself"

I've watched a show in the back of the room at the Fox and the sound was totally distorted by the overhanging balcony. It was shockingly bad.

AltJ,2juyyx,theglebman,2,Tue Oct 21 22:24:52 2014 UTC,"This will be a repeat of what I already touched on in another thread... but I just saw them in Seattle last week and they sounded AMAZING in a concert hall setting.  The acoustics made the show for me.  They opened with Hunger of the Pine and Fitzpleasure (probably my two favorite songs) and that got me hooked.  That being said, they definitely seemed to lack energy.  That, and their new bassist seemed to be the weakest link."
AltJ,2juyyx,Perk456,2,Tue Oct 21 18:33:03 2014 UTC,Maybe the tour fatigue is catching up with them? Saw them a month ago in Wolverhampton and they were great.
AltJ,2juyyx,theunderagecritic,1 point,Tue Oct 21 20:03:56 2014 UTC,"More like everyone has their own opinion/the band had a day off... It's not like you saw them twice last month and yesterday.  If anything, the performances of new stuff are likely to improve over time."
AltJ,2juyyx,mr_yuk,1 point,Tue Oct 21 22:40:46 2014 UTC,"I actually really liked their performance in Van. They started off with a rather weak sounding Hunger of the Pine (not the best intro song), but after that almost everything else sounded tight."
AltJ,2jv7p4,tropicsasquatch,6,Tue Oct 21 06:43:30 2014 UTC,"I don't want to rain on your parade but this was down on the list of Alt-J shows for me. That venue is just too big for them, and I don't think outdoors suits them well. They have a very intimate sound and much of it gets lost at venues that big. At times it felt like they were phoning it in, especially with the older songs, which I guess happens when you don't move around on stage at all. I dunno, I was definitely left underwhelmed. Out of the five other times I've seen them, every show has been better, except maybe at Fingerprints in the middle of the day in the corner of the store. I actually thought their opening act The Acid was better. Those guys blew me away. But I'm really glad you loved it. Everyone I know who went loved it."
AltJ,2jv7p4,tessalasset,1 point,Tue Oct 21 16:35:11 2014 UTC,"I saw alt-J at Bonnaroo 2013 and it was amazing! The crowd was much bigger than I expected and I didn't get closer to the front until the last few songs. However, they played all of An Awesome Wave in order with a couple other songs in between. The other two songs were Buffalo and Slow Dre, which I happen to have recorded.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9oy7V1opaA"
AltJ,2jv7p4,anAwes0meWave,1 point,Wed Oct 22 01:54:32 2014 UTC,"First ∆ show here. Fortunate enough to tag along with a friend. AAW I thought was one of a kind, and TIAY an entirely different beast that I ended up liking and connecting more with. Joe's vocal was off during a few select moments, but not too often to categorize the show as a let down. Cared more for the emotional ambience and less for a perfect performance. Vocals always have good and bad days! Also, the two Bloodfloods - gosh, powerful."

AltJ,2jts40,square965,2,Tue Oct 21 16:43:00 2014 UTC,"That was crazy. I'd love to be able to ski like that.  The first I heard of Alt J was Tessellate on a youtube video. At the time I thought Alt-j(Δ) meant alternative Japanese music (like J-pop or J-rock), and that just Δ was the name of the band. The video was just a static image of something, but it wasn't a picture of the band. I thought it was really weird that Japanese people made music that sounded what I was hearing."

And suddenly I found that I couldn't stop listening to the album. My advice: listen to it a couple of times. Maybe the album will sound better with each listen for you just like it did for me."
AltJ,2jlaoi,ps747,12,Sun Oct 19 05:28:23 2014 UTC,as soon as you try to compare the two you have missed the point.... one is incredibly mathematical and structured to evoke certain emotions (AAW) where the other comes straight from the heart (TIAY) not saying that you're not entitled to your own opinion but I just think you should come at the new album with an open mind... you'll enjoy it way more
AltJ,2jlaoi,i_cri_evry_tym,6,Sat Oct 18 13:37:56 2014 UTC,I can't help but compare the two albums... They're both made by the same band and are the only two albums.
AltJ,2jlaoi,Inquizardry,2,Sat Oct 18 16:59:26 2014 UTC,"I .... uh... felt a little deflated as I heard the first songs of TIAY. I did. People can call me a fairweather fan or whatever, but I'm just honest.  We're all going to feel differently about different things, of course."

AltJ,2jlysk,fabripav,1 point,Sat Oct 18 22:20:04 2014 UTC,"I agree... I think it's just inevitable when people have emotional attachments to an album and then the following one takes a pretty dramatic change in direction that people are going to compare them... It's not 'better', 'worse', 'right' or 'wrong', just totally different."
AltJ,2jlysk,Inquizardry,5,Sun Oct 19 01:20:14 2014 UTC,"Man, at the end of the day I'm just so so grateful for their new album, it is one of the best gifts in life. All I can say is that an awesome wave gave made my life so much better in so many ways and this is all yours just made me feel really empowered and beautiful. I love both and I won't compare because they are both excellent albums. I don't remember the last time I felt so strongly for any band, its going to be  a dream come true to see them tomorrow."
AltJ,2jlysk,tsema,4,Mon Oct 20 03:34:56 2014 UTC,"You just can't compare An Awesome Wave and This Is All Yours, you can't. I mean, specially going track by track, with the same number. You can't do ""Interlude II vs. Left Hand Free"" and then ""Something Good vs. Garden of England"". If you are going to do it right you need to compare Garden of England with Interlude II or Interlude III, because they're both instrumentals."
AltJ,2jlysk,RuiThatGuy,7,Sat Oct 18 21:21:37 2014 UTC,I agree completely. I hoped it was obvious this was a joke.

AltJ,2jkybj,Rescue_Whale,6,Sat Oct 18 04:10:48 2014 UTC,I actually reealllyy appreciate and like both!! I don't think I'd be able to choose!!!
AltJ,2jkybj,girlteal,9,Sat Oct 18 05:03:54 2014 UTC,"I think This Is All Yours is better thematically. The album as a whole feels a bit more independent, as most of the songs on An Awesome Wave were written around other references. For that reason though, I think AAW is easier to consume in pieces. Overall I love both albums, and I don't think it fair to say that one is definitely better than the other."
AltJ,2jkybj,No-oneOfConsequence,4,Sat Oct 18 05:16:16 2014 UTC,"Personally I feel An Awesome Wave resonates more with most fans because Alt-J has a very unique sound and that was the first exposure to their style. I think This Is All Yours was an attempt to both emulate that feeling that captivated fans AND expand upon what they were doing and explore possibilities. In that sense, I feel TIAY could be considered a ""better"" album because it represents them growing and fully utilizing what was at their disposal. I love both albums and have no problem listening to either front to back."
AltJ,2jkybj,ladderlegs,1 point,Sat Oct 18 05:57:49 2014 UTC,"I honestly like TIAY is a little better than AAW, but AAW had a lot more themes than TIAY. I usually like dark themes, and TIAY is mostly dark, not very happy and pretty grimy."

They're people just like the rest of us, and people can get sick, or tired, or distracted by something happening in their normal lives. They're not perfect.

AltJ,2jkdkq,RuiThatGuy,2,Sat Oct 18 05:19:46 2014 UTC,"They just need a few more shows with the new album you know, I bet that they aren't feeling extremely comfortable when playing TIAY live.

AltJ,2jguiz,doctaqueef,1 point,Fri Oct 17 02:00:07 2014 UTC,Did the band not state that they will never bring another member into their band?

AltJ,2jguiz,everyotherfreckle,2,Thu Oct 16 23:53:02 2014 UTC,"He's not an official member of the band. He is a touring member, so he has no musical influence on the band at all. They chose him by holding auditions and he was the best one. Before the UK tour in September they were practising with him and they said he seems ""cool"".

AltJ,2jguiz,Inquizardry,2,Fri Oct 17 02:21:08 2014 UTC,"That's why OP put it in quotes:   ""new member""   Though I'm pretty sure the band isn't adding a new member, he is just a touring musician with them."
AltJ,2jguiz,watoosh,2,Fri Oct 17 14:07:45 2014 UTC,"I really think, personally, ^  this gives the band a very disconnected, incomplete feel. I saw the band last night (ill probably start a new thread regarding my thoughts on the show, because it's at least partially irrelevant for everyone else, but feels necessary for me) and ..... Well, I never got to see them with Gwil, but I watched the youtube vids with them performing live and people in the comments were totally flabbergasted that it was a live show because it sounded SO perfect. This definitely wasn't the case last night."

My bf and I are seeing them tonite in Portland.... couldn't WAIT til they came back into town... I wonder, are they going to have someone standing in orrrr...???   'Fans of alt-J, including myself, were curious how the band would sound as a trio now that bassist Gwil Sainsbury left. It was a friendly departure. Keyboardist Gus Unger-Hamilton told us via email that ""Having to write songs as a trio rather than a foursome was a daunting prospect for us at first, but coming up with this song reassured us that — for want of a better phrase — we were going to be OK.""'

Just that some of the songs weren't the best they could be, like Left Hand Free, that was really, really different from AAQ and the rest of TIAY.   I also agree they could've chosen better singles, as a single should be pretty recognizable on its own.  Edit: though I get Left Hand Free was more is their label than them"

I don't know if it was just too much production on the new album that doesn't translate well or what but 'Every Other Freckle' and 'Left Hand Free' sound really empty. I feel like Joe is also a little more reserved vocally, his voice is cracking a lot. Still like the songs but just something I noticed"
AltJ,2jd2h2,Constable_Bartholin,6,Thu Oct 16 01:39:49 2014 UTC,They're definitely not as tight/present as their performances for An Awesome Wave.
AltJ,2jd2h2,TholomewP,5,Thu Oct 16 03:42:33 2014 UTC,"Might be they hadn't toured in a little bit, now they are playing 3 gigs a week. You're right about it lacking; Gwil recorded and could reproduce all his sounds both in the studio and live... Now I notice they have men in black playing basses and guitars at their big stage performances. They made a broader sound on this new album, which I absolutely love... But it seems too big for them to hold on stage."
AltJ,2jd2h2,whitemithrandir,2,Thu Oct 16 02:54:32 2014 UTC,"Also I've noticed from the shakey graves set that KEXP tends to have sets really early (like commute times), so possibly a mix of not sleeping/jet lag is kinda wearing them down a bit."
AltJ,2jcdra,razvanrat,3,Wed Oct 15 19:00:57 2014 UTC,"Their show in Vancouver was awesome, have a great time!"
AltJ,2jcdra,theglebman,2,Thu Oct 16 02:23:57 2014 UTC,Did they have someone standing in on bass? Since original bassist purportedly left?
AltJ,2jcdra,Inquizardry,4,Thu Oct 16 18:53:30 2014 UTC,"It's very likely. I was in the balcony so I couldn't see their faces well, but the bassist was definitely the weakest link last night (Seattle show).  There was a specific song (don't remember which) that required the bassist to pluck his fretboard (?) to make a specific sound.  He was clearly struggling so Gus filled in the sound on the keyboard halfway through.  I knew something was up.  Regardless of all that, they sounded great."
AltJ,2jcdra,akaWhisp,4,Thu Oct 16 20:49:56 2014 UTC,"Oh, snap.... Well. I'm still going to be obnoxiously early so I can be up front and I'm still going to rock out, and yes, I am sure they are still going to kick ass!..... kind of odd that... a band who is starting to become pretty successful ( they are gaining speed on our local alternative radio station) should have a problem finding an awesome bassist.... self-directed sarcasm Surprise! I guess everyone is still human, not musical guardian gods come to earth!"
AltJ,2jcdra,Inquizardry,1 point,Thu Oct 16 20:58:50 2014 UTC,Was the song Taro?
AltJ,2jcdra,IrishFuryHD,2,Thu Oct 16 21:21:51 2014 UTC,Pretty sure it was.  I'm assuming it's this part you're referring to?
AltJ,2jcdra,akaWhisp,3,Thu Oct 16 22:09:46 2014 UTC,Top 3 concert I've been to. Fantastic job with the lights and they nailed pretty much every song.

AltJ,2j8qdb,solebreadwinner,2,Wed Oct 15 02:48:25 2014 UTC,"I think alt-J is really hard to cover without destroying the very essence of the song, and they rarely add anything. The only cover I've found that I've really liked is Mumford and Son's (who I don't normally like) cover of Tessellate.  It's very nice and she's got a lovely voice but it really doesn't add anything to the song, or capture the original feeling, besides making it a cute acoustic version. (But am hugely jealous of her gorgeous voice)"

AltJ,2j7od2,colorful-limbo,1 point,Wed Oct 15 12:26:15 2014 UTC,"So, that's the trade-off.   Its a really great album, especially on vinyl. That being the case, I probably wouldn't present it at all beyond leaning up the jacket while I'm playing the album.   Second to that, I wouldn't have the records themselves up against the glass of a frame, as exposure to light  and the mechanical pressure of the records against the glass would be detrimental in the long run. You're basically grinding dust into the grooves, as well as subjecting the vinyl to unnecessary UV degradation and the potential of warpage.   In the end, my stance is essentially this: records are meant to be played. They are a pain to produce, and represent (typically) the pinnacle of music production. Let them live for what they are."

AltJ,2j4w16,peanutbuttervibess,2,Mon Oct 13 22:09:42 2014 UTC,"I've seen CTE three times, when they're on fire they're amazing, and when they're not, they're not. Fun band to watch."
AltJ,2j4w16,jambispot,2,Mon Oct 13 23:30:36 2014 UTC,"91x really loves cage the elephant. They're a great band live but it feels like they're at every festival they throw. Also, Billy Idol is so left field. I got my tickets though. It'll be a fun night."
AltJ,2isr72,Konqueror,7,Thu Oct 9 21:45:44 2014 UTC,"I think it works well in the song, it adds to it and I really like it. Especially the first time I listened to it where, I was like 'wow what is this?!' And then I smiled slightly. Because I love hearing new and unexpected things in songs. Which is why I love alt j!"
AltJ,2isr72,CodenameBubbles,4,Thu Oct 9 22:17:44 2014 UTC,"It took me forever to understand what you were talking about. I don't think it detracts from the song. I like the rest of the song better, but the quick pause in the percussion sets up the next line nicely."
AltJ,2isr72,tessalasset,1 point,Thu Oct 9 23:05:52 2014 UTC,"To me they just missed such a big opportunity to make a meaningful drop. It just sounds like it's building into something big thennnn the cover girls. It would have been so cool to go into a super groovy part, but then again, Alt-J are the experts and I'm just the pleb listening."

AltJ,2irdo1,redna88,3,Thu Oct 9 14:14:20 2014 UTC,Are you scalping or selling at cost?
AltJ,2irdo1,tessalasset,-2,Thu Oct 9 16:17:03 2014 UTC,yeah i saw they were going for some crazy $100+ on stubhub still trying to make profit as you can understand so the lowest I'll go is $75 a piece we can talk some more if you're buying multiples.
AltJ,2irdo1,fabripav,3,Thu Oct 9 21:13:05 2014 UTC,still trying to make profit as you can understand   No. Don't be a fucking dick and sell at face value.
AltJ,2irdo1,tessalasset,3,Thu Oct 9 22:09:04 2014 UTC,"Nah, cost is fair (ticket price + fees)"
AltJ,2irdo1,fabripav,1 point,Thu Oct 9 22:27:48 2014 UTC,How can the tickets go from 42 (it says so in the site) to 75?
AltJ,2irdo1,tessalasset,1 point,Thu Oct 9 22:37:37 2014 UTC,"I'm not saying $75 is a fair price (altho that's what I paid for tickets to the LA show through the venue itself).   I'm saying the cost of a ticket is a fair resale price as opposed to the face value, which doesn't take into consideration the fees the person had to pay on top. It was a more general statement."

AltJ,2ikv59,tessalasset,2,Sun Oct 12 05:43:19 2014 UTC,"Considering this is the first tour for their new songs, I imagine they'd play them straight, but I wouldn't be surprised if they played around with the AAW songs."

AltJ,2ic73x,Speall,4,Sun Oct 5 05:53:31 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the shout out! And I really love what you've written here as well. It says a lot about how incredibly deep and layered this song is, and just how gorgeously written the lyrics are. There's one layer, with a story, another with references, and yet another about just how beautiful love is. It ties into that peacefulness and that beauty of being ""a deer in Nara"", and how love can bring such peace and beauty when outside forces don't get a say in it's development.  I too love this song. Can't stop listening and thinking about it."
AltJ,2ic73x,Maridiem,3,Sun Oct 5 06:18:39 2014 UTC,"Yes, dude. Im so glad you understand as I do. Two layers, for sure.   It might be my favorite song...  EDIT: I mean three layers, lol."

He then proceeded to sing the part he sings which is fairly close to what gmitiri said below BUT… There are definitely parts live where he says “And I said I will wait for you” and I think he says “though my body may die, I’ll wait for you.” Again, the actual truth is that he improvises a lot of it.

AltJ,2hxkh8,fabripav,1 point,Tue Sep 30 22:58:52 2014 UTC,I only got the email for the presale now so you should be fine.

AltJ,2hxkh8,tessalasset,1 point,Wed Oct 1 17:26:45 2014 UTC,Yeah an hour and a half in. That's not surprising at all. Still plenty of concourse seats.
AltJ,2hxkh8,SeanaldTrump,2,Wed Oct 1 18:51:27 2014 UTC,Should be interesting. I really wonder if they will sell it out. Quite a jump from what they have been doing. Wish them the best! Thoughts?
AltJ,2hxkh8,Masshole224,2,Wed Oct 1 01:07:42 2014 UTC,Pre sale in less than 30 min and still no presale code? What gives?

AltJ,2huxt5,fabripav,3,Tue Sep 30 20:15:22 2014 UTC,Aww mate that part is sick. I said it in another thread but the way the bass and the ghostly drumming work together is amazing. Easily the best 20 seconds of the album.

AltJ,2hsjko,whitemithrandir,23,Mon Sep 29 14:56:52 2014 UTC,Some people think it could be Madison Square Garden if you read it as it's actually shown on the Facebook feed/Instagram page with the M first. Either that or they're trying to warn us about the dangers of Monosodium glutamate.
AltJ,2hsjko,fabripav,13,Mon Sep 29 15:03:00 2014 UTC,I'm glad they're raising awareness about that.
AltJ,2hsjko,Orlando146,7,Mon Sep 29 15:16:41 2014 UTC,About time someone tackled that issue.

AltJ,2hs9ab,doctaqueef,1 point,Mon Sep 29 19:01:43 2014 UTC,Honestly love the cover. Not sure why it is getting so much hate.  I guess they could have been a little more creative (create a guitar track) but I really like it. More than the original even.

AltJ,2ht4ca,beansley,2,Wed Oct 1 23:09:31 2014 UTC,"Me too! At first I loved ""Left Hand Free"", probably because it's the most fun, easy to listen to for just jamming out I guess. However, ""Every Other Freckle"" has stolen the spotlight for me since the album came out.   Also, Bloodflood pt. is great. I love the feel of the album and I've really enjoyed it.   One thing I would like to say is that no two-song combos on this album can touch ""Interlude 1 (Ripe & Ruin)"" and ""Tessellate"" back to back."

AltJ,2hpo5y,L3ED,5,Sun Sep 28 17:46:41 2014 UTC,Ahh. That is awesome! I hadn't even noticed   It makes the album name that much better when you read it that way.

AltJ,2hpgfg,L3ED,5,Sun Sep 28 17:39:57 2014 UTC,"Damn, is that the white vinyl for An Awesome Wave? I only have the boring black pressing. The white is gorgeous."
AltJ,2hpgfg,ladderlegs,2,Sun Sep 28 17:41:50 2014 UTC,"Yes it is. I'm not sure why they would have different colours, what country do you live in? It was the first record I bought because I had some records and a turntable given to me so I started collecting and An Awesome Wave was my favourite album at the time so I thought it would be a good place to start."
AltJ,2hpgfg,ladderlegs,1 point,Sun Sep 28 17:46:55 2014 UTC,I live in the US so that probably has to do with it. And that's a great place to start! An Awesome Wave was actually my third record. So far I have 8 records but I love them all dearly.  Here's what my black pressing looks like.
AltJ,2hriis,rawktail,2,Mon Sep 29 05:13:47 2014 UTC,"I loved both albums and when I heard their single on the radio in America I was so happy for them for finally getting somewhere, and while yeah, it's clearly not Alt J, it's not really bad music either... To hear them talk like that kind of offends me a little bit and makes me lose some respect for them... I understand the pressures the record label must have given them for a 'good single', but let's be honest, we all know how the music industry works for the most part. That song is why they're going to be so well known now - is that a bad thing?"
AltJ,2hriis,fabripav,2,Mon Sep 29 05:15:17 2014 UTC,"That's an old article, they've denied those claims in the meantime. They like the song."
AltJ,2hriis,DarQraven,1 point,Mon Sep 29 09:42:12 2014 UTC,"Even if they didn't, they'd probably have to pretend. I can't imagine the record label being too happy with statements like these out there. From their perspective, it ruins the point of the entire song. Little hard to market and push something if the band themselves are turning it into a joke."
AltJ,2hriis,tessalasset,1 point,Mon Sep 29 11:50:40 2014 UTC,I'm totally fine with them feeling that way about the song and I tend to agree with them.
AltJ,2hp640,Captaincadet,11,Sun Sep 28 14:28:55 2014 UTC,Liam Gallagher did a similar thing where he gradually spelled out OASIS with individual tweets. Caused a whole load of speculation about a reunion until Noel came out to deny it and said Liam was probably just drunk. So maybe the lads have just had a bit too much of Something Good.

AltJ,2hp640,Isaac_Killer,2,Sun Sep 28 14:52:14 2014 UTC,That what I thought! Alt J wont be allowed to release a new single as they just launched a new album and their lable wont be too happy with that! I only known Alt J after Gwil left (I found them out in May).
AltJ,2hp640,howfastisgodspeed,2,Sun Sep 28 15:01:40 2014 UTC,Direct link
AltJ,2hpqg3,finchfinch,3,Sun Sep 28 18:08:49 2014 UTC,"Interesting perspective. I'm very curious as to why they chose Nara. There's like one mention of the deer in the song ""Nara"", and the rest of the subject matter of the trilogy seems...well like it has nothing to do with a city in Japan."
AltJ,2hpqg3,ladderlegs,3,Sun Sep 28 23:20:50 2014 UTC,Most believe that becoming a deer in Nara is a metaphor for becoming free without any societal constraints as the deer in Nara roam free.   See this comment (and the thread).
AltJ,2hjvl8,sickofstew,3,Fri Sep 26 18:54:10 2014 UTC,AFAIK they were kind of forced to write it to have a 'better' lead single for the album.
AltJ,2hjvl8,TholomewP,3,Fri Sep 26 20:50:19 2014 UTC,I thought they debunked that. I remember a Twitter pussy that said they weren't forced to write it and it as born more or less from a jam session.

AltJ,2hjvl8,imgettingbetternow,1 point,Fri Sep 26 22:55:06 2014 UTC,"From this NME article:  ""The band previously jokingly expressed concerns that their new single 'Left Hand Free' could be used at an 'NRA convention' (the National Rifle Association). Speaking about the new track, they called it ""the least Alt-J song ever"", written to appease their American label who didn't think the recently released 'Hunger Of The Pine' was a ""big single"". Discussing 'Left Hand Free' in The Guardian, they say the song was written in 20 minutes and is based around a ""joke riff"" that frontman Joe Newman started playing one day."""

AltJ,2hhem1,green_lemons,3,Fri Sep 26 02:33:27 2014 UTC,"I have to be honest, I didn't like the album the first time I listened to it.

AltJ,2hhem1,_BigBucketWull,2,Fri Sep 26 23:17:49 2014 UTC,It's a bit too syncopated to have sex to though I think. You'd be changing pace faster than a bloody pace changing machine or something
AltJ,2hhem1,cakenpie,2,Fri Sep 26 23:28:53 2014 UTC,"I agree, the more I listen to this album the more I enjoy it. I really love the lyrics as well, especially songs like Hunger of the Pine and Pusher.

AltJ,2hhem1,Kkyyykk,2,Fri Sep 26 23:29:57 2014 UTC,Digging the brood and instrumentation on Bloodflood 2 at the moment.  This is a very good record. They create beautiful melodies and yet show such restraint with them.
AltJ,2hhem1,Admancan,2,Sat Sep 27 00:37:12 2014 UTC,"I personally am disappointed well because their music is a bit different now but I guess bands evolve like that. It's not bad it's just different from the previous, a lot more relaxed and calm vibe. I only liked bloodflood 2, GOJH and Lovely Day."
AltJ,2hh5a5,scmcdowell17,9,Thu Sep 25 22:56:24 2014 UTC,I just think it's cool how seamless each voice passes the next word or phrase to the other singer. Sounds really cool.
AltJ,2hh5a5,L3ED,4,Fri Sep 26 00:19:19 2014 UTC,"Seeing the live versions, I swore this would be my favorite song, and at first i was ultra disappointed in the inclusion of other voices, but after a while I realized that I dont think Joe has a ""sweet"" enough voice to give the song the emotion the lyrics call for. Lyric-wise I think it's the bands most gorgeous song to date. What a beautiful fucking song."
AltJ,2hh5a5,lolarsystem,2,Fri Sep 26 04:16:42 2014 UTC,"I've always thought that the live versions sounded so good were because Joe's voice wasn't very loud compared to the instruments, but the album version is beautiful in a more wholesome way"

AltJ,2hezrx,vuho,8,Thu Sep 25 09:29:20 2014 UTC,I don't think this is particularly well researched or written. If you are going to mention arrival and leaving why not Nara? No mention of the bassist leaving. Hunger of the Pine was the first single. No mention of the Miley sample (how do you not mention that?) and really very little opinion or comparison to previous works.  Does not come across that author has actually listened to it and just felt he had to review it because of how well it's selling.
AltJ,2hezrx,MetricSuperstar,5,Thu Sep 25 13:14:14 2014 UTC,There is barely a review. It's more an Album Description.

AltJ,2hbuuc,Funkbass,11,Wed Sep 24 16:08:43 2014 UTC,They really were.  We knocked on the door of their tour bus before the show and they came out and talked with us for ten minutes.  They were pumped that the new Alt J album was out.
AltJ,2hbuuc,peanutbuttervibess,2,Wed Sep 24 16:51:58 2014 UTC,"I think if they toured together it would probably be the best thing that's ever happened(at least to me). I also met Dave once, really great guy. They seem to be really awesome with their fans"
AltJ,2hbuuc,TR401,2,Wed Sep 24 22:08:03 2014 UTC,"I'm from Des Moines! :D My day was perfect too though. I listened to the album with a bunch of friends in the South Pacific, and a friend threw another friend's phone overboard. It was lovely. :)"

AltJ,2h9m29,jtan484,4,Tue Sep 23 22:58:41 2014 UTC,Can't believe one of the reviewers called it skippable. Maybe he got it confused with choice kingdom.
AltJ,2h9m29,Silly_Wasp,3,Wed Sep 24 00:09:15 2014 UTC,"Yeah so far Choice Kingdom is my least favorite (love the lyrics though), with Bloodflood pt. II and the Gospel of John Hurt being absolute favorites."
AltJ,2h9m29,L3ED,2,Wed Sep 24 00:33:12 2014 UTC,"No, he said Arrival in Nara is skippable. But yeah his review stuck out to me the most in that I don't think he really understands the band."

AltJ,2h5mb6,fabripav,2,Tue Sep 23 23:04:22 2014 UTC,"So AAW is just An Awesome Wave, alt-J's first album. TIAY disc 2 is the second disc for This Is All Yours. For album 2, alt-J chose to make the vinyl a 2xLP, which means instead of having one record with all the songs on both sides, it's two double sided records."
AltJ,2h5mb6,fabripav,1 point,Thu Sep 25 16:32:45 2014 UTC,"Wait, do you mean it is two single-sided records?"

AltJ,2gyw7v,Ralcorite,1 point,Thu Nov 20 05:40:12 2014 UTC,In the BBC Introducing Maida Vale Session you can see Gus using the Yamaha keyboard. I think the keyboard has probably appeared on more tracks than you'd think.
AltJ,2gz3od,MeesterWestside,14,Sat Sep 20 19:39:05 2014 UTC,"Pretty much a trilogy (including Leaving Nara) about a gay man and his lover:   ""In the arms of the warmest colour"", ""Love is the warmest colour"" are both references to Blue is the Warmest Colour, a film about lesbian lovers. ""I'm gonna marry a man like no other"" ""Petrol blues"" is a Rolling Stones song, which contains the line 'Please, Mr. President, say it isn’t so!', potentially referencing legalization of gay marriage. (Thanks Genius.com for that one) ""Love is a pharaoh and he's boning me"" is just a pun, to be honest, haha. ""He's found me, my Aslan"" is almost taunting how conservative Christians are so anti-gay in America, with Aslan being CS Lewis' representation of Jesus in the Chronicles of Narnia. ""Hallelujah, Bovay, Alabama"" Bovay = Alvan Earle Bovay, one of the founders of the Republican party, the party most against gay marriage. Alabama has a law against Gay marriage as well. This line plays against ""Love is the warmest colour"" pretty well too, as Blue is the Democratic color on voting maps, and Red is republican."
AltJ,2gz3od,Maridiem,6,Sat Sep 20 19:53:58 2014 UTC,"I think that's a really good interpretation. But... Alt j are an English band, why would they be targeting America so much for gay rights issues there are certainly worse places for that. (I'm English btw so I'm not going all patriot)"
AltJ,2gz3od,AudacityKilledTheCat,5,Sun Sep 21 07:37:35 2014 UTC,"It was written before the Russian olympics, when Russia banned Gay well... everything (thus the line ""Unpin your butterflies Russia"" in there). I imagine during that the whole American battle over Gay Marriage slotted in well. Some of it may have been coincidence, but it all fits very nicely as a whole, since America is that big legality battle. The Bovay and Alabama references are the most glaring though."
AltJ,2gz3od,Maridiem,8,Sun Sep 21 08:21:33 2014 UTC,"The line ""Unpin your butterflies Russia"" reminds me of the dead butterflies that scientists or teachers pin to boards. Russia is sort of doing the same thing to the gay people there, when they should unpin them and let then be themselves."
AltJ,2gz3od,FrogsSayMeow,2,Sat Sep 20 23:32:23 2014 UTC,I think that line itself is so beautiful.

AltJ,2gz3od,Vu1pus,6,Sat Sep 20 20:47:35 2014 UTC,"Has anyone come up with any idea why they titled it Nara besides the freely roaming deers in parks there? I went to Nara 7-8 years back and it was a lovely place but I don't see any strong connection between the city and homosexuality. Of course, being irrelevant (tolerant) to gay people unlike Russia/Alabama might be the reason why Nara was picked for it. But ""Nara"" appears in the title of three songs of the album so I'm thinking there must be something more than that."
AltJ,2gz3od,finchfinch,5,Sun Sep 21 00:27:04 2014 UTC,"I think the deer was the very reason they picked it, as the deer are free to do as they please without being locked up, shot, or trapped. It draws parallels between the idea of being gay without the targeting, the persecution and the arrests.  Many other places deer are at man's mercy, but in Nara it's almost a sanctuary for them."
AltJ,2gz3od,WookieeSmuggler,3,Sun Sep 28 09:30:19 2014 UTC,"Apparently he read about Nara on reddit and just liked the idea of the freely roaming deer. In a KEXP interview he said ""it suited, it was a nice analogy for equal rights across the board"""

AltJ,2gvtwq,deadbeforeitsank,6,Fri Sep 19 18:37:06 2014 UTC,"My favorite band after Alt-J, these guys are incredible. My favorite track of theirs is Cocoa Hooves, but I would suggest listening to Gooey and Pools to become acquainted with their sound. By the way, could anyone suggest any bands that are similar to them and Alt-J?"
AltJ,2gvtwq,peanutbuttervibess,4,Fri Sep 19 22:30:24 2014 UTC,"Cocoa Hooves is fucking fantastic. That opening bass gets me going every time. I love the static and atmosphere they put in their music.  Edit: as for bands, try the Acid and Royal Canoe. Both amazing groups."
AltJ,2gvtwq,L3ED,3,Sat Sep 20 00:23:25 2014 UTC,"I already like Royal Canoe so thanks for the suggestion! And I know what you mean about the bass, such a killer song"
AltJ,2gvtwq,peanutbuttervibess,2,Sat Sep 20 00:32:42 2014 UTC,"No problem! The Acid is a bit of a stretch but if you like the atmosphere in Glass Animals, you'll fall in love. Really cool music."

AltJ,2gvtwq,L3ED,2,Sun Sep 21 11:38:42 2014 UTC,The acid are amazing but i don't know how similar to alt-j they are
AltJ,2gvtwq,parabolaking,2,Sat Sep 20 02:07:49 2014 UTC,It's more of a similarity to Glass Animals than it is to alt-J. I actually discovered Glass Animals through the similar section in the Acid's Spotify profile.
AltJ,2gvtwq,L3ED,3,Sat Sep 20 02:15:07 2014 UTC,This is exactly what I was going to say! Their cover of 'lock lovedown' is also amazing :)
AltJ,2gvtwq,OnlyRory,5,Sun Sep 21 20:50:38 2014 UTC,"Favourite bands atm: Alt-J, Glass Animals, Radiohead & Foals. Someone recommend Glass Animals on a comment thread about alt-j, thank fuck I read that and actually looked them up."
AltJ,2gvtwq,noahharrison64,2,Fri Sep 19 22:49:19 2014 UTC,I'd say that the song Hazey is also a good representation of their genre. Also kind of reminds me of Alt-J

AltJ,2gvtwq,DylanRhymaun,2,Sun Sep 21 21:31:03 2014 UTC,Yep their sound is probably closer to Alt-J than any other band. Pretty sure the same radio station that made Alt-J popular also found Glass Animals too.  /r/GlassAnimals

AltJ,2gt8fi,AudacityKilledTheCat,4,Fri Sep 19 15:00:30 2014 UTC,"I think the meaning of the song is about having a feeling that there's some kind of darkness inside of you.   I have a feeling it's inspired by that dark, sinking madness you can feel sometimes when you're tripping.  Musically, the band plays around a lot with building a void that you can feel in the song. It's really interesting."

Altho I worked with an artist a couple years ago and we did that exact thing - shipped everything early to make sure they received them by D Day. Some people got them early and we're stoked. Better to have pleasantly surprised fans than angry fans.

AltJ,2gkacw,phunkip,2,Wed Sep 17 07:11:35 2014 UTC,I didn't mean they'd just play as regular but with one instrument missing.  It's not unheard of to simply use a pre-recorded bass track or change up the arrangements to be more of an 'acoustic' set. Though I can't name any recent examples I've seen off the top of my head.  Was just wondering which they'd go for.

AltJ,2ghirk,MatulinHD,2,Mon Sep 15 19:34:01 2014 UTC,"""Weird Alternative Rock with Electronic influences, but it's unique so describing it is useless, just listen to Breezeblocks or Every Other Freckle"""
AltJ,2ghirk,MonkeyDot,2,Mon Sep 15 20:33:58 2014 UTC,I always start with Tesselate and Breezeblocks.  Matilda and Taro are pretty accessible too.
AltJ,2ghirk,InterstateLoveSong27,1 point,Tue Sep 16 04:41:09 2014 UTC,"Listen to An Awesome Wave start to finish. Then once you've listened to it in its entirety, listen to it again. And again. And again (unless you really don't like it).  For about the first 10 times I listened to it, everytime it got better and better until it became one of my all time favorites"
AltJ,2ghirk,-internets,1 point,Wed Sep 17 14:52:19 2014 UTC,"Having converted a number of friends to alt-J fans, I have a formula.  I've given up trying to explain their music right off the bat. They become more interested once they tell the stories in the lyrics, esp ""Taro"", so I show them a couple of songs and them have them read the lyrics and what they are interpreted to mean. They usually fall in love with them after that. Or not. But normally they do."
AltJ,2gg30c,jon1467,18,Mon Sep 15 09:59:55 2014 UTC,"On the first listen, it is nowhere near An Awesome Wave :/"
AltJ,2gg30c,SchartHaakon,8,Mon Sep 15 12:29:17 2014 UTC,"Give it a chance man, it's a fantastic album. To be completley honest, I was a little skeptical when I first listened to AAW, but it grew on me. Same will happen with TIAY, for you."
AltJ,2gg30c,uberdevil,9,Mon Sep 15 12:46:09 2014 UTC,"Yes that happened to me as well. I listened on repeat while working a summerjob last year, mainly because of Breezeblocks. After that I think I've had almost every song in the album as an favourite at some point and time.  I'm giving it a chance, I really like Every Other Freckle, but for example what they did with Warm Foothills I really didn't like. It was so good live, but the mixed vocals, slower tempo and more acoustic feel just made it into a whole other song. It doesn't have the same build up and power to it (I really, really, really hope they release a version closer to the live one as well, maybe in a single). Most of the album is really relaxing, like that song, but it doesn't have the same ""epicness"" that I loved listening to while taking the buss while looking out at the fjords in Norway."
AltJ,2gg30c,SchartHaakon,4,Mon Sep 15 14:06:08 2014 UTC,"I totally understand what you're saying. TIAY is much slower paced and calmer than AAW, with less harder hits. An album by another artist that I recommend is Zaba, by Glass Animals. They have an alt-J feel (but not an exact copy) with the hard hits and similar elements used in AAW."
AltJ,2gg30c,uberdevil,3,Mon Sep 15 14:57:44 2014 UTC,"Oh, Pools! I knew I recognized ""Glass Animals"". I will give it a listen, never really dove deeper than that song, thanks :-)"
AltJ,2gg30c,SchartHaakon,8,Mon Sep 15 15:01:32 2014 UTC,"Even AAW took some time to captivate me. I remember listening to Breezeblocks and wondering what was so awesome about it and the same happened with the other tracks. TIAY sounded strange when I first heard it, but now it feels good. This is what I love about Alt-J. The feeling is never immediate, each song must grow on you."
AltJ,2gg30c,lethaargic,3,Mon Sep 15 17:43:22 2014 UTC,"The feeling is never immediate, each song must grow on you.   HOLY SHIT I've been trying to figure out what it is about alt-J that makes me love them so much, and I think you finally put my feelings into words."
AltJ,2gg30c,uberdevil,6,Mon Sep 15 18:03:26 2014 UTC,"Yep. An Awesome Wave took probably two months of solid listening to completely floor me. When I first got it I listened to it on my computer and thought, this sounds interesting. Some of it didn't immediately sound good to me, but it was unique enough that I put it on my ipod, and got my good headphones out, and walked around for days listening to it closely, and it just opened up for me. These songs are so nuanced you need to listen closely. AAW was totally one of those albums that I loved one song at a time, and I think TIAY is gonna be the same. I have my current favorites, and I know they're going to change. But Nara, holy shit."
AltJ,2gg30c,tessalasset,4,Mon Sep 15 18:37:57 2014 UTC,"Yes, it's exactly like this. You just go ahead, put it on your ipod, and all of sudden you realize you're skipping other bands and repeating every song by Alt-J. Even if I love every song from AAW, i got addicted to ""Bloodflood"" only a while ago. And I'm sure it will happen with TIAY. I didn't enjoy ""Every other freckle"" on the first listen, now it's a song I can't skip (and it totally owns the scrobbles on my last.fm right now). I fell in love with Nara and Intro and I'm sure the other songs will grow on me pretty soon :)"
AltJ,2gg30c,lethaargic,3,Mon Sep 15 18:51:37 2014 UTC,"Haha they've taken over my last.fm, too."
AltJ,2gg30c,tessalasset,2,Mon Sep 15 19:02:35 2014 UTC,glad i did it :)
AltJ,2gg30c,lethaargic,3,Mon Sep 15 18:52:15 2014 UTC,"I agree.. However, it is still good!"
AltJ,2gg30c,bjornetjeneste,7,Mon Sep 15 12:35:33 2014 UTC,"Nara, Every Other Freckle, Hunger Of The Pine and Bloodflood pt. II are my favourites of this album.   AAW will probably stay my favourite Alt-J album, where I liked every single song tremendously. On this album there are more songs that I find bluntly strange, or just not that very good. Maybe it has to grow on me."
AltJ,2gg30c,NeoCracer,6,Mon Sep 15 12:57:51 2014 UTC,The Gospel of John Hurt is great.
AltJ,2gg30c,strickyy,2,Mon Sep 15 14:49:44 2014 UTC,I'm in the same boat as you. I gave it a good listen on a car ride this past weekend and those three stuck out to me the most. Nara is so beautiful.
AltJ,2gg30c,trafficrush,4,Mon Sep 15 14:56:19 2014 UTC,"Totally agree. It's not that it's bad, it's actually some really fantastic music. It just doesn't have the same catchiness that the first had."
AltJ,2gg30c,Grubster11,3,Mon Sep 15 16:43:20 2014 UTC,"Only catchy ones were the song already released though. Not every song on An Awesome Wave was catchy, it took time to get into some songs like Matilda or Bloodflood to be honest."
AltJ,2gg30c,100TimesOSRS,2,Mon Sep 15 20:56:56 2014 UTC,"Ya first thing I noticed was that the three most catchy songs were the singles they released. IDK, I was instantly in love with every song on An Awesome Wave. That album is absolutely magical."
AltJ,2gg30c,Grubster11,1 point,Mon Sep 15 21:02:19 2014 UTC,Ya first thing I noticed was that the three most catchy songs were the singles   That's usually how singles work.

AltJ,2gg30c,Grubster11,3,Tue Sep 16 01:44:28 2014 UTC,Unfortunately marketing doesn't agree with us :/
AltJ,2gg30c,J0E_SpRaY,4,Tue Sep 16 01:46:49 2014 UTC,"Three or four decent songs and the rest sound either like self-indulgent tosh (Garden of England sounds like a reject from the Wicker Man soundtrack) or dismal, forgettable B sides. Really liked the pre-album version of Warm Foothills, but the 'duet' just sounds really clunky and doesn't work at all for me. I'm sure it'll all make nice samples for mortgage advertisements and the like later in the year, but all in all it feels far too empty and devoid of the crispness and catchiness that made An Awesome Wave so good. Maybe it will get me more across a few more listens (AAW certainly did), but so far except for Nara none of the songs are hugely doing it for me."
AltJ,2gg30c,arturbollocks,3,Tue Sep 16 15:45:10 2014 UTC,Pusher is fucking beautiful.
AltJ,2gg30c,PandaSupreme,2,Thu Sep 18 18:37:02 2014 UTC,"I'm in love with 'Nara"". Not listened to the whole album yet."
AltJ,2gg30c,1231988,2,Mon Sep 15 23:54:12 2014 UTC,"Didn't grab me as immediately AAW did, but I can feel that it will grow on me on repeated listens. And holy crap I'm loving Nara and Bloodflood pt.II."
AltJ,2gg30c,NeoCracer,3,Tue Sep 16 08:13:37 2014 UTC,Yay to Spotify! Maybe this is an exclusive deal with the band?
AltJ,2gg30c,bjornetjeneste,3,Mon Sep 15 10:40:34 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure, I can't find as information as to why it's come out early. I thought it might be just for premium users but it seems to be out for everyone..."

AltJ,2gg30c,sheoak4,2,Mon Sep 15 12:35:15 2014 UTC,"Aren't we doing some sort of discussion thread? I love the album, it's beautiful, but I did miss some heavier songs like Every Other Freckle. Most songs in the album are kind of like the interludes from AAW. Not that they're bad, they're amazing, but I wanted more like EOF. On first listen, my favorites were Nara, Every Other Freckle, The Gospel of John Hurt and Bloodflood Pt.2. I don't know about you, but I think I prefer this version of Warm Foothills."

AltJ,2gg892,SchartHaakon,2,Mon Sep 15 13:44:37 2014 UTC,Was just wondering this.. WF is definitely my favourite on the album so far. I think the others will catch up in my love though ∆
AltJ,2gg892,OrchardThief,2,Tue Sep 16 06:27:29 2014 UTC,"For those who haven't heard the live version, here you go. It's way better IMHO."
AltJ,2gg892,SchartHaakon,3,Mon Sep 15 14:16:50 2014 UTC,I thought that live show was pretty bad. It almost seemed like they could not hear themselves through the monitors. The singing was really off.
AltJ,2gg892,fabripav,3,Mon Sep 15 14:26:04 2014 UTC,"At 1:30 (chorus), yes I agree, but I like it way better with that tempo, electric guitar and the powerful drums. Also wasn't a very big fan of the change between singers mid-sentence.  EDIT: I'm sure it'll grow on me in time, but I really liked this version from when I first found the live video."
AltJ,2gg892,SchartHaakon,1 point,Mon Sep 15 14:37:08 2014 UTC,For me the live 2013 version sounds a bit generic compared to the studio one.

AltJ,2gd46h,robrago,-8,Tue Sep 16 22:46:47 2014 UTC,Because paying for music is stupid
AltJ,2gd46h,fabripav,4,Tue Sep 16 23:04:58 2014 UTC,Explain why. Try to convince me. You're not doing a good job so far.
AltJ,2gd46h,robrago,-4,Tue Sep 16 23:40:39 2014 UTC,"Why pay for it when you could literally have it in seconds for free. I'm not saying that all people should steal music, because that's just not realistic.  If I was in a band I would be happy if my album got torrented 1 million times.  But my main point is you shouldn't try and stop people from torrenting."
AltJ,2gd46h,lanciferp,5,Wed Sep 17 22:23:03 2014 UTC,"So because its really easy to steal, go for it. Fantastic logic. And I would be pissed. One million people didn't care enough about me making a living, or didn't enjoy it enough to support me, that they weren't willing to pay 9 bucks for it. Great job guy."
AltJ,2gd46h,robrago,-2,Wed Sep 17 22:41:14 2014 UTC,No it's not that they don't like it enough. It's that they just think it's stupid to pay 10 dollars for music when you could really use that money for something else like gas or food
AltJ,2gd46h,pwndapanda,1 point,Wed Sep 17 23:56:48 2014 UTC,It helps to support the artist so they can continue to produce music.
AltJ,2gd46h,robrago,-2,Sat Sep 20 22:51:22 2014 UTC,Pirating music has never limited an artist from producing music.  They will continue to make money even if people torrent their music.

AltJ,2g7hjn,theunderagecritic,2,Mon Sep 15 00:08:09 2014 UTC,"It's a fun interlude type song, someone said earlier its a sort of palate cleanser and that totally describes it.  It's not meant to be a song by itself but a piece of the album. IMO it's an awesome addition the the album."
AltJ,2g7hjn,S33V,1 point,Wed Sep 17 03:33:34 2014 UTC,I like it too ! It's a very pleasant melody.
AltJ,2g7hjn,Fancy_Doritos,6,Mon Sep 15 02:18:03 2014 UTC,"Hahah, like seriously, the most out of place and mood ruining thing on the entire album. Skip everytime I get to it on the album"
AltJ,2g7hjn,IrishFuryHD,6,Fri Sep 12 15:53:31 2014 UTC,"After Left Hand Free it works, imo. I mean, it HAS to ""ruin"" the mood set up by LFH in order to make the rest work"
AltJ,2g7hjn,fabripav,2,Fri Sep 12 16:11:38 2014 UTC,"I really that if they had gotten rid of ""Left Hand Free"" (for its aesthetic difference from the rest of the album), ""Garden of England"" (because it's rather uninteresting), and ""Choice Kingdom"" (because after listening to the album multiple times I can remember any melody or lyrics from it), this would be a great album instead of a good album. That lull in quality after the orgasm of ""Every Other Freckle"" takes away from the album as a whole just a bit too much."
AltJ,2g7hjn,jchazu,3,Sat Sep 13 03:00:21 2014 UTC,"I mean I guess it's a palate cleanser of sorts, but I seriously thought (and still do think) it's like a fake troll song. They could have made those elements into such a cool Alt-J song, and instead leave it as is. Whatever the point, it goes right over my head."
AltJ,2g7hjn,tessalasset,3,Fri Sep 12 16:15:37 2014 UTC,"I agree with the ""palate"" cleaner. Kind of sets up the rest of the album"

AltJ,2fxpee,2tabsonyourtongue,2,Wed Sep 10 03:03:00 2014 UTC,"Definitely, such a beautiful song."
AltJ,2fwlby,deepit6431,13,Tue Sep 9 13:29:57 2014 UTC,"It's beautiful. I was slightly worried that they'd mess this up but it's just so  beautifully done. Warm Foothills is so fucking good. Out of all the new tracks, Warm Foothills, Bloodflood pt. II, and Nara are currently my favorites. I really want to listen to the whole album in one go but I can't hold off these three for that long."
AltJ,2fwlby,mscarn,7,Tue Sep 9 18:05:19 2014 UTC,"Oh my god, Warm Foothills caught me off guard, but not in a bad way:) I was totally expecting Joe to be singing the whole thing, but when I heard the voices switch off......hnggggg"
AltJ,2fwlby,uberdevil,13,Wed Sep 10 04:51:18 2014 UTC,"Only listened to it once and, honestly, I was a little underwhelmed. It's a lot slower than their first album which i was a slightly thrown off by.  I obviously need to give it more listens"
AltJ,2fwlby,imbetterimback,8,Tue Sep 9 14:42:02 2014 UTC,"Yup, much slower, much more measured. I probably like the old approach better, but I love this as well.   It does grow on you with more listens."
AltJ,2fwlby,Masshole224,6,Tue Sep 9 14:48:05 2014 UTC,"Last album had 3 real rock singles — Fitzpleasure, Tessellate, and Breezeblocks.   This one has Every Other Freckle, Hunger of The Pine, and Left Hand Free. I think the structuring of the albums are VERY similar.   So I agree I'd like more of their rock/upbeat stuff, I don't think this is any slower than the last album."
AltJ,2fwlby,GowsenBerry,6,Tue Sep 9 17:10:59 2014 UTC,"I think the only thing TIAY is missing compared to AAW, is a song like Dissolve Me."
AltJ,2fwlby,bjornetjeneste,1 point,Tue Sep 9 18:40:06 2014 UTC,I don't think I'll ever find a song as good as Breezeblocks!
AltJ,2fwlby,Ivantroffe,13,Mon Sep 15 12:43:43 2014 UTC,"I don't think it comes even close to their debut. There's not enough distinctive material here, too much of it is shapeless and blending together. Yes, there are some standouts; Left Hand Free is energetic and catchy, and I love Hunger of the Pine. But I really don't see it approaching An Awesome Wave. That record was worked on years and every nuance of it was tightened and refined. Every single track on that one was unique in its own way. It may never be topped.  I need to listen to it a few more times this weekend, maybe some more definition will be established. But right now i'm just hearing too much noodling around without the catchy riffs and structure of AAW. And what the hell is Garden of England?"
AltJ,2fwlby,thekingh,5,Fri Sep 12 21:32:43 2014 UTC,"Your response is gonna get buried here, bud. Too against the grain ;)   But in all honesty, I think it's such a strong departure from AAW, that it needs some extensive listening to really gain an appreciation. But I really do agree with you that the songs kinda blend and the other album was perfected over years and years.  For anyone who's heard Silversun Pickup's Neck of the Woods album, you may notice a similarity -- many of the songs start off pretty subdued and really gain force at the end, usually ending in lots of vocal harmonies and all the instruments at once. Not that that's a bad thing, just a recurring theme and a song device maybe a bit tad overused on TIAY.  Overall, after about 7-8 listens, it's pretty solid, but not sure I dig it as much as AAW."
AltJ,2fwlby,Ivantroffe,2,Fri Sep 12 22:23:27 2014 UTC,Ha I figured! Someone needs to go against the norm. I'll have to check out that Silversun Pickup album.
AltJ,2fwlby,Ivantroffe,2,Sat Sep 13 18:32:55 2014 UTC,"A week later and I'm higher on the album than at first! It definitely grew on me. I like all of the tracks besides Garden of England, and it helped big time when I listened to them in the car with some good volume behind them.  One small thing I've noticed is the structure of these tracks, often near the end towards their most intense sections, ends up often being just four swelling chords. It's hard to describe. But these progressions don't have the unique beauty that stood out to me right away on AAW.   I still don't think it will ever touch AAW for me, personally. That thing was a 10/10."
AltJ,2fwlby,jchazu,8,Fri Sep 19 18:38:20 2014 UTC,"After a first listen, I'm really liking this album. I was a little worried that it wouldn't live up to AAW (and it will take a few months of listening to truly compare the two), but it's definitely a great follow-up so far. ""Pusher"" is probably my sleeper favorite so far, but I'm also really loving ""Nara"". Can't wait to spin it again!  Edit: Also, does anyone else's version have a little ""pop"" right before each song?"
AltJ,2fwlby,tessalasset,2,Tue Sep 9 18:56:32 2014 UTC,I agree about the sleeper favorite aspect. There's something special about that one.
AltJ,2fwlby,tessalasset,2,Tue Sep 9 19:05:06 2014 UTC,"And yes, I have a few pops. Didn't even notice til you mentioned it."
AltJ,2fwlby,pandaonmars,5,Tue Sep 9 19:21:10 2014 UTC,"I couldn't wait for my iTunes pre-order to come out, so I have downloaded the leaked version and already listened it once. As imbetterimback already mentioned, the overall pace is much slower compared to An Awesome Wave, yet al the tracks are really amazing. Nara could easily be the best song I've listened to in a couple of years, no kidding."
AltJ,2fwlby,Masshole224,5,Tue Sep 9 16:28:51 2014 UTC,"Same here, I've pre-ordered it but really can't wait so I don't feel bad about downloading :P.  Gospel Of John Hurt is absolutely amazing too."
AltJ,2fwlby,noahharrison64,3,Tue Sep 9 16:30:38 2014 UTC,I think Gospel will be the unsung hero of this album. Bloodflood pt II will be a fan favorite for a long time.

The album as a whole seems a little subdued. I found myself grateful for Left Hand Free because it brightens the album up a bit. The more I listen to it though, the more I appreciate the calm. I will say that I prefer the solitude of the live version of warm foothills. It sings more like a story than a dialog when he sings it alone. The story seems more fascinating to me."

AltJ,2fo7pu,Lets-Tessellate,3,Sat Sep 6 22:36:54 2014 UTC,"Nah don't think anyone would mind, it's on a site, not like you leaked them.  I'm excited to read the write-up but I went straight to the Bloodflood pt. II lyrics to find out what they say during the ""Quelea, quelea"" repeat but they aren't there :("
AltJ,2fo7pu,Isaac_Killer,2,Sat Sep 6 23:18:05 2014 UTC,"Eh I know, but it is some kind of a leak because the site wasn't really supposed to have them up and avalaible (it's a ""press kit""). Besides, it's ""just"" lyrics and not music so yeah."
AltJ,2fo7pu,jambispot,5,Sat Sep 6 23:31:00 2014 UTC,It seems that 'Arrival in Nara' shares the same lyrics as the second song from this short film Joe + Gus did the music for.

AltJ,2fo7pu,Fuckthisfuckyoumothe,1 point,Sun Sep 7 19:51:53 2014 UTC,Well spotted. I guess that's a stripped down / acoustic / early version of it then?
AltJ,2fo7pu,NachoFresard,1 point,Sun Sep 7 18:52:35 2014 UTC,This seems like a possibility!
AltJ,2fo7pu,Abcdety,2,Sun Sep 7 19:50:58 2014 UTC,"When we actually sat down to do the lyrics, I had to really listen to what I was singing on the tape. You know, ‘Ok, I’m saying pharaoh here, and then I think I’m saying bone’. Sometimes, they don’t make any sense; I suspect that people are going to come up with some fairly interesting interpretations of those moments.”  In other words, over to us. Which is, Joe says, the point of the album title. “That’s sort of what it means. Once the record is out, it’s yours. You own it.” And we do. Nerves steadied, fears dispelled. Time to dive in."
AltJ,2fjpdd,fabripav,3,Fri Sep 5 13:10:38 2014 UTC,They're looking bored as hell and the playing overall is lacking any emotion in my opinion.
AltJ,2fjpdd,teleekom,34,Fri Sep 5 14:36:26 2014 UTC,Try playing on live TV
AltJ,2fjpdd,_Winters,6,Fri Sep 5 17:47:42 2014 UTC,"OH SNAP.  I knew Thom was around here, hope you read the NPR thread."
AltJ,2fjpdd,Lets-Tessellate,4,Fri Sep 5 21:45:07 2014 UTC,"I'm not trying to be a dick about it believe me, but the performance seemed kinda weird. I don't think you're late nigh show kind of a band anyway.   Edit: Although much slower song, this performance got a lot more energy then the Letterman one. You really seemed kinda uninterested whether if it is the song or the environment"
AltJ,2fjpdd,teleekom,13,Fri Sep 5 22:40:02 2014 UTC,"Sorry i didn't mean to sound pissed or anything, but yeah it's really hard to actually play well under that pressure, plus we don't like acting like a ""rock band"" anyway, because we're not one"
AltJ,2fjpdd,_Winters,3,Tue Sep 9 02:55:55 2014 UTC,Seems fair enough
AltJ,2fjpdd,2tabsonyourtongue,2,Tue Sep 9 05:20:21 2014 UTC,Could I ask which song you guys enjoy playing the most? Just out of interest :)
AltJ,2fjpdd,CodenameBubbles,3,Wed Sep 10 17:05:19 2014 UTC,Well fancy seeing you here!   But yeah it's nothing like the KEXP show.

AltJ,2fjpdd,teleekom,3,Sat Sep 6 21:30:37 2014 UTC,Seems like this album so far is missing a lot of the power and heaviness they used to have. It worries me.
AltJ,2fjpdd,dragoswastaken,4,Fri Sep 5 16:35:37 2014 UTC,I'm not really looking for heaviness when I listen to alt-J...

AltJ,2fjpdd,MonkeyDot,4,Sat Sep 6 02:26:16 2014 UTC,"What a disaster. From Joe being completely emotionless, to Gus doing a random keyboard...thing. To the bassist repeating the same shit forever. Only Thom was half-conscious in the middle of this. Then Letterman comes and ignores Thom, ""Look everybody, it's Alt-J"", then remembers he has to say something and says the album name.  Besides, they playing their worst song (imo)"

AltJ,2fgllo,Isaac_Killer,5,Thu Sep 4 15:49:40 2014 UTC,"The videos released for ""This Is All Yours"" so far seem to be pretty similar, like telling a single story? They seem feature movement (lots of movement shots and panning), in the wild. Colours look pretty close to each other too. Hmm."
AltJ,2fgllo,wornmedown,6,Thu Sep 4 16:04:13 2014 UTC,Yeah even the thumbnail immediately reminded me of the Hunger of the Pine video
AltJ,2fgllo,ladderlegs,3,Thu Sep 4 16:23:10 2014 UTC,"I love how both versions of the video end - showing the Girl or Boy from the opposite video, as if they are separating after a kiss."

AltJ,2fd4f8,fabripav,3,Wed Sep 3 15:35:14 2014 UTC,"It's not acoustic by any means, but the new album by The Antlers, called Familiars, has some of the most relaxing music I've ever heard. Same goes for their 2012 ep Undersea."
AltJ,2fd4f8,lephosphore,3,Wed Sep 3 22:03:49 2014 UTC,Something of Bon Iver maybe?
AltJ,2fd4f8,BuffetBarbeque,2,Thu Sep 4 07:51:19 2014 UTC,"Just listened to Interlude II again and I was immediately reminded of Spookyghostboy. Pretty chill, lo-fi, acoustic stuff. Check it out."
AltJ,2fd4f8,ladderlegs,1 point,Wed Sep 3 20:14:50 2014 UTC,"I couldn't find it on YouTube from my phone, but there's a song by The Decemberists called ""An Interlude"" from the album The Hazards of Love that is somewhat similar."
AltJ,2fd4f8,Gercke,1 point,Thu Sep 4 00:12:13 2014 UTC,"Not exactly like Interlude II, but I like to listen to AIR, who has tons of relaxing music (La Femme d'Argent, Talisman, for example).  I just started listening to some Chilly Gonzales solo piano, which is great to relax to.  If you're looking for relaxing guitar music without vocals to study to, I always used the Instrumental Folk station on Pandora or other streaming service."

AltJ,2fblfy,Ameroman,2,Wed Sep 3 05:46:18 2014 UTC,You could tell they were really fresh on the new stuff.  Their old stuff seems hurried.
AltJ,2fblfy,HankSinatra,1 point,Wed Sep 3 13:43:13 2014 UTC,I'm getting an error message. Was it taken down or is it just because I'm on mobile?

Will upload the whole thing in the morning, will probably cut up and upload the individual new tracks to my channel too.   Edit: Fuck it, I'm uploading Bloodflood Part II right now, it's so fucking good.  Edit #2: I recorded the audio, not the footage, recording over an hours worth of footage would have probably taken all the memory available on my computer.

AltJ,2fbhkq,noahharrison64,1 point,Wed Sep 3 02:25:40 2014 UTC,Really powerful.
AltJ,2fbhkq,_Pants_,3,Wed Sep 3 02:34:50 2014 UTC,They just said that the radio station and NPR are going to archive it so that people can hear it later. They didn't say when though. I'm going to try to find out. Need to listen again.
AltJ,2fbhkq,WarmFoothills,2,Wed Sep 3 02:15:30 2014 UTC,Nice. Thanks for the heads up. I will refresh the hell out of that webpage.
AltJ,2fbhkq,_Pants_,2,Wed Sep 3 02:18:39 2014 UTC,They said they would upload it in a few days. So good luck refreshing :p
AltJ,2fbhkq,Ameroman,2,Wed Sep 3 02:19:51 2014 UTC,"Haha, shit. That's good to know."
AltJ,2fbhkq,tessalasset,2,Wed Sep 3 02:21:00 2014 UTC,They usually archive all live performances so I'll be looking forward to it as well.
AltJ,2fbhkq,Fatty_McDanger,0,Wed Sep 3 02:19:54 2014 UTC,Its already up.
AltJ,2fbhkq,tessalasset,2,Wed Sep 3 14:03:01 2014 UTC,I never closed the link to the show so I've just been replaying it all night. Still listening right now.
AltJ,2fbhkq,Maridiem,2,Wed Sep 3 03:41:53 2014 UTC,It's incredible.
AltJ,2fbhkq,Maridiem,4,Wed Sep 3 04:00:07 2014 UTC,"It's really rare for me to like nearly every song a band releases, but so far that's been the case with Alt-J. Based on these live, unreleased songs tonight, there's a chance that somehow I like This is All Yours more than An Awesome Wave. Three months ago that would have seemed impossible.   The progression in both ""Nara"" and ""The Gospel of John Hurt"" is truly mesmerizing. And as /u/uberdevil put it: ""Bloodflood Pt. 2"" was some sort of fantastic quasi-remix of ""Bloodflood Pt. 1"" and ""Fitzpleasure.""   Based on how awesome ""Nara"" was, I'm expecting some interesting things from ""Arrival in Nara"" and ""Leaving Nara."" So far, so awesome. September 22nd cannot come fast enough."
AltJ,2fbhkq,noahharrison64,3,Wed Sep 3 02:21:43 2014 UTC,"Loved Hunger of the Pine, Every Other Freckle, Warm Foothills, Gospel of John Hurt, and Nara. Really really liked. Holy shit this makes me so much more excited for the album and the show next month.  Also did anyone notice Gus's interesting in-ears? http://i.imgur.com/7e4db1m.png"
AltJ,2fbhkq,uberdevil,2,Wed Sep 3 02:19:18 2014 UTC,"Yeah! Whose face is that??   And Joe was wearing a Guardians of the Galaxy shirt!  Yeah, I have a countdown widget set on my phone for their gig in October. Stoked as hell.   Warm Foothills was awesome. I like GOJH a little more but they were so different, so it's hard to choose."
AltJ,2fbhkq,GetMeOffReddit,2,Wed Sep 3 02:22:31 2014 UTC,"Almost looks like Stephen Fry, haha!  And yeah, I noticed the shirt and ran downstairs to point it out to my mum, as we'd gone to see GotG the night before!"

AltJ,2fbhkq,WarmFoothills,2,Wed Sep 3 02:26:32 2014 UTC,It was Gordon Brown!
AltJ,2fbhkq,Maridiem,2,Wed Sep 3 10:54:37 2014 UTC,"bloodflood p.II wasn't what I was expecting, but I was blown away. A remix of fitzpleasure and bloodflood(?) Whatever it was, it was great. I'm also pumped as hell for Nara"

AltJ,2fbiqx,Maridiem,2,Wed Sep 3 02:28:21 2014 UTC,"Likely wasn't the best song to open with. They all sounded like they were warming up with it, but once they got into their groove with a few old songs, they were fantastic."
AltJ,2fbiqx,mrbrinks,1 point,Wed Sep 3 03:41:58 2014 UTC,"In general, I thought the whole set at NPR was not very good performance wise. It was very clear that they were rusty. It may have just been the audio, but Joe sounded a bit sick - his voice didn't have the range it usually does."
AltJ,2fbiqx,HarryHagaren,2,Thu Sep 4 21:40:27 2014 UTC,"This is like when you go watching a movie sequel, and they bring back a new version of the previous movie soundtrack!"

AltJ,2fb6ew,IMP1017,5,Wed Sep 3 01:10:16 2014 UTC,Agreed. It seemed a bit too quiet.

AltJ,2fb6ew,verination,3,Wed Sep 3 01:10:33 2014 UTC,I kind of don't want to listen so as not to lose the novelty of their live sound for when I see them in November.... but I'm just so excited to hear the new album!!!
AltJ,2fb6ew,fabripav,3,Wed Sep 3 01:08:50 2014 UTC,"New songs sound a bit rough (understandable), old songs sound better than before."
AltJ,2fb6ew,Maridiem,3,Wed Sep 3 01:25:02 2014 UTC,I'm really digging Nara and John Hunt. This is honestly better than An Awesome Wave. I'm sorry. It's simply spectacular.
AltJ,2fb6ew,fabripav,3,Wed Sep 3 02:02:26 2014 UTC,"So far we've had ""Hunger of the Pine"", ""Left Hand Free"", ""Warm Foothills"", ""Every Other Freckle"", ""The Gospel of John Hurt"", ""Bloodblood Part II"", and ""Nara"" played as of now. Cannot wait to see what else they roll out!  EDIT: Well, I guess that's all we get! Huge chunk of the album, leaving ""Intro"", ""Arrival At Nara"", ""Garden of England"", ""Pusher"", and ""Leaving Nara"" to be heard!"

AltJ,2fb6ew,fabripav,2,Wed Sep 3 01:18:24 2014 UTC,"I'm thinking Joe's mic could use a boost, he sounds pretty quiet tonight, especially on ""Matilda."" But I always thought Thom's work on that song is the best of that song.  Bloodfood Pt 2 Edit - Speaking of Thom, how about that hi-hat?? If this song is as good studio-wise as it is live, we're in for a treat. Plus ""in the C-O-double-M-O-N"" is back, I always loved that line."
AltJ,2fb6ew,radrussian1234,2,Wed Sep 3 01:28:21 2014 UTC,Yeah I think the mixing is off. The keyboard is distractingly loud

AltJ,2f2mgf,WankyFriesman,1 point,Sun Aug 31 23:19:37 2014 UTC,I'm glad I made you laugh! It was so magical being there. My friends and I flew all the way from Malta for that festival. Totally worth it.

AltJ,2f2mgf,out_the_way,2,Sun Aug 31 11:12:46 2014 UTC,What city is this small venue in? How small? I'd love to see them play in a more intimate setting!
AltJ,2f2mgf,eftj,1 point,Thu Sep 25 18:36:24 2014 UTC,"Well, it depends on your definition of small, but I will be seeing them at SOMA in San Diego. Standing room only, one room."
AltJ,2f2mgf,WankyFriesman,1 point,Thu Sep 25 18:43:26 2014 UTC,"I was at the same gig, they absolutely blew me away. I think the fact that Eminem was on at the same time meant the alt-J crowd was that much more into it. It was pretty magical."
AltJ,2f2mgf,eftj,2,Sun Aug 31 18:25:35 2014 UTC,"Yeah the tent was quite empty, but everyone knew the words and everyone was incredibly friendly so I don't think it mattered."
AltJ,2f2mgf,The_Quinn,1 point,Sun Aug 31 18:32:10 2014 UTC,"Yeah, exactly. I'm seeing their new album in Manchester on the 20th of September. Pretty stoked."
AltJ,2f2mgf,The_Quinn,4,Sun Aug 31 18:36:13 2014 UTC,Saw them in Sydney last year. Amazing backing acts (City Calm Down and Snakadactal) and then they were just incredible. The sound guys fucked up their guitars though but they managed to roll with it and still put on one of the best performances I've been to.
AltJ,2f2mgf,battlemetal_,2,Sun Aug 31 11:44:27 2014 UTC,Did you have a standout song out of the set?
AltJ,2f2mgf,fabripav,3,Sun Aug 31 11:56:30 2014 UTC,They were all great but the one that I remember most vividly was a cover of College - Real Hero as a sort of encore performance. Breezeblocks was huge over here in Australia so that was also incredible.
AltJ,2f2mgf,imgettingbetternow,2,Sun Aug 31 12:05:40 2014 UTC,Sounds amazing.
AltJ,2f2mgf,CamCamBigelow,2,Sun Aug 31 12:14:19 2014 UTC,"That's awesome. I can imagine it feels great receiving that kind of recognition, which they rightly deserve."
AltJ,2f2mgf,parabolaking,3,Sun Aug 31 11:24:18 2014 UTC,"Watched them progress from Dajit Dhaliwal playing in pubs around Leeds with my brother's music outfit. Seeing them a few years later at live at Leeds they had a pretty big following, but the sold out Manchester Academy is when I really felt they had become a rock band - they had the lights, gear and power. Crowd was great too. Was crazy hanging out backstage afterwards/in the bars seeing people react to them; I don't think they fully had come to terms with it yet. Their live shows have definitely improved over the years, they carry the confidence to have stage presence now. Both Alexandra Palace and the O2 Arena shows coming up should be great."
AltJ,2f2mgf,tessalasset,2,Sun Aug 31 11:27:41 2014 UTC,"Wow, that's really cool that you got a view into their progress from nearly the beginning. I'm really looked forward to seeing them again in October."

AltJ,2ez134,jambispot,3,Sat Aug 30 05:07:10 2014 UTC,Wouldn't really surprise me if the new Intro is related in some way to the old Intro.
AltJ,2ez134,fabripav,3,Sat Aug 30 07:07:15 2014 UTC,"Why would it be the same version? I mean, they're called the same but wouldn't make much sense to have the same song in two different albums."
AltJ,2ez134,fabripav,3,Sat Aug 30 08:27:31 2014 UTC,Is there going to be an extended version of left hand free? When I google TIAY there's a 6 mins 17 sec version. If there is it could be quite interesting
AltJ,2ez134,CodenameBubbles,3,Sat Aug 30 08:50:13 2014 UTC,"Hmm, that is interesting. I highly doubt that there will be an extended version on the new album, as the shorter version has already been released and people have bought it. Maybe they'll release it sometime in the future?"

AltJ,2er5ih,NachoFresard,3,Wed Aug 27 23:53:49 2014 UTC,Another article I read said 9 pm eastern time. It also says it's audio and video.

AltJ,2e0ou1,tenacious_panda,4,Tue Aug 19 20:52:30 2014 UTC,"I didn't click the link because Verizon, but I like the interpretation. I believe I saw someone from the band mention that it is about a love chase (pine-pining for someone). I like how far you looked into it though."
AltJ,2e0ou1,Fuckthisfuckyoumothe,4,Tue Aug 19 21:52:45 2014 UTC,"Everyone gives the ""I'm a female rebel"" part a lot of flack but after listening to the song and interpreting it like a ""love chase"", it makes a lot more sense. He's pining for her but he keeps getting ""shot down"" (literally in the video) but she's rebelling against it. (Also fits into the ""your heart wears knight armour"" lyric) Despite being shot down multiple times, he continues on. I feel like when he douses himself in gasoline, it represents him making himself completely (emotionally) vulnerable to her, knowing full well that it could destroy him."
AltJ,2e0ou1,gigachicken,2,Wed Aug 20 01:35:09 2014 UTC,"Honestly,  I binged watched all four seasons of game of thrones around the time this song came out,  and the just the line about chain mail always makes me think of the hound for some reason"

On a episode of “Extreme Cheapskates “a Las Vegas man figured out a way to make some money by signing up for medical trials. He saved himself more than $750. That inspired him to take it one step further. Most recently he also agreed to donate one of his testicles. But they didn’t just leave him hanging. They replaced it with an artificial one and paid him $35,000.  It was reported that he used the money to purchase a Nissan 370 Z."

AltJ,2dp50x,fabripav,2,Sun Aug 17 02:31:42 2014 UTC,"Yeah but not in a good way, imo... 65 are the best live band in the world, but they wouldn't really fit with alt-J."

AltJ,2dmv4s,schiefer740,8,Fri Aug 15 19:59:28 2014 UTC,I'd rather it be on /r/Iama. I feel as though with only 1000 users it would be kind of desolate.   They're pretty well known enough to do it in there.
AltJ,2dmv4s,staythepath,4,Fri Aug 15 22:04:09 2014 UTC,Well of course someone would post a link in probably both /r/iama and /r/music to the ama. But I would be happy with a mention. More users here mean more discussions and more posts. I just think that would be nice to see.
AltJ,2dmv4s,akhil02,0,Fri Aug 15 22:08:39 2014 UTC,"I highly doubt it would ever happen, but it would be cool if they did both.

AltJ,2bfmcj,___csj___,5,Tue Jul 22 21:28:22 2014 UTC,"You realize it's just a sample right? It's not like they had Miley Cyrus come into the studio and sing it for them. It'd be about like them getting the person who says ""yeah"" on intro to come sing it live with them in concert.  It's not going to happen."
AltJ,2bfmcj,Carterpaul,8,Wed Jul 23 08:01:39 2014 UTC,"I like the Miley sample! I don't think it sounds bad, and just because it's Miley doesn't mean you have to automatically hate it! She's a fan of the band, and she can sing! With that being said, I highly doubt she will ever perform live with them. If she did though, I'm sure it would be a great performance."
AltJ,2bfmcj,sweetas314,-1,Tue Jul 22 22:39:34 2014 UTC,"I don't hate the sample, I actually think it fits well with the song (probably because the song is built around it.)  My issue is that, after losing a member and putting out singles like Hunger of the Pine and Left Hand Free that indicate an exploration into a broader range of musical genres, the question is posed: where Alt-J is headed and what kind of a band they will become?  Are they sticking to the attitude and sound they started with?  Would they be open to the idea of doing a live show where someone like Miley Cyrus guest performs a song?  Or is this an indication of a complete shift in sound?"
AltJ,2bfmcj,fabripav,2,Wed Jul 23 03:55:05 2014 UTC,Would they be open to the idea of doing a live show where someone like Miley Cyrus guest performs a song?   Why would this happen? It makes no sense. It's just a sample.

AltJ,28k75o,poitinpdx,2,Fri Jun 20 07:38:54 2014 UTC,"I personally enjoyed the more natural sounds on the song.  It was lots of drum machines but without sounding like it was made off of a computer program. Definitely sounds like they could form a large live band to perform the song in a similar sense. Much like when Radiohead performed ""15 Steps"" at the Grammys!  I thought the voice sampling such as the high pitched squeal sample by the end of the track aswell as the Miley sample went against that, without adding to the track. I could imagine a heavier use of horns to add life to express a natural side to it all.  So, there are my thoughts. What do you guys think?"

Let's be honest, if they went in the same direction as AAW, the likelihood of something as good/comparable would have been been rather low and we all would have been rather disappointed.    HotP sounds nothing like AAW while retaining many of the nuances alt j is known for. Not a huge fan of the Miley Cyrus sample, but I'm sure it will grow on me after a few listens.

AltJ,28hcil,deathleeehallows,1 point,Wed Jun 18 19:05:57 2014 UTC,"Yeah, me too. For me it kind of completes the song."
AltJ,28hcil,gaygarbage,2,Wed Jun 18 19:10:01 2014 UTC,"Good stuff, no reason to dislike it just because Miley Cyrus is in it!"
AltJ,28hcil,wornmedown,1 point,Wed Jun 18 19:57:17 2014 UTC,"Yeah I've been listening to it a lot, it's definitely grew on me"
AltJ,28hcil,Ponyboy227,2,Wed Jun 25 06:01:55 2014 UTC,what do you think it means? it sounds like struggles/highs with heroin(?) and convincing his lover to partake as well
AltJ,28hcil,SurrenderAtZero,3,Wed Jun 25 06:54:08 2014 UTC,He said it was about how wanting/loving someone is a hunger. The hunger of pining for someone.
AltJ,28hcil,thermal_socks,1 point,Wed Jun 18 20:31:20 2014 UTC,I enjoyed it a lot. It sounds very Thom.
AltJ,28hcil,WarmFoothills,1 point,Thu Jun 19 20:15:38 2014 UTC,I think they did really well with the direction that they went in. I mean they could've easily gone in a direction where we would all be like wtf. But I think this song was a good little taste for what we should be expecting for their upcoming album.
AltJ,28hcil,magicalhullabaloo,2,Mon Jun 23 10:36:00 2014 UTC,"I expected, and wanted them to change directions, to try something new this time around, just not that direction."
AltJ,28hes6,daniel5151,1 point,Wed Jun 18 18:55:55 2014 UTC,"The lyrics are awesome. However, the song itself was honestly not something I expected from Alt-J. I hope the rest of the album is better because this song is a bit anti-climatic."
AltJ,28h9l4,coffeefirsttho,6,Wed Jun 18 18:09:18 2014 UTC,That was very different.. But it was so so still alt-j!  I love it!
AltJ,28h9l4,smellsmax,7,Wed Jun 18 18:35:51 2014 UTC,I have to endure some horror music to listen to it though...

AltJ,28h9l4,Isaac_Killer,2,Wed Jun 18 18:30:24 2014 UTC,"I have mixed feeling upon the first listen.  I love how it starts with a seemingly out of place beat which then gets layered upon to make something much better.  I did not like the girl rapping sample.  I'm sure that after the album comes out I will learn to love this song, just as I did with every song on An Awesome Wave."
AltJ,28h9l4,Gercke,1 point,Wed Jun 18 20:45:35 2014 UTC,Loved it
AltJ,28h9l4,xenfermo,1 point,Wed Jun 18 18:50:23 2014 UTC,"Meh. I hope this is the worst song on album,need some bass lines some tom tom drumming. Gwil come back!"

AltJ,27pax4,magicalhullabaloo,2,Mon Jun 9 23:00:19 2014 UTC,May I ask when the singles will be released?
AltJ,27pax4,WarmFoothills,4,Tue Jun 10 07:18:53 2014 UTC,Possibly this week
AltJ,27pax4,WarmFoothills,3,Tue Jun 10 08:25:25 2014 UTC,"Really? That is quick, what is your source for this?"
AltJ,27pax4,WarmFoothills,3,Tue Jun 10 11:07:45 2014 UTC,"https://twitter.com/LesJamesCD1025/status/476041839251042304  And a few days ago another radio (96.5 The Buzz) tweeted ""Just listened to new @alt_J fucking amazing."", but the tweet is now deleted.  Usually when radios start listening to tracks it's because they'll put them out soon. So it's either this week or next monday/tuesday."
AltJ,27pax4,Kazlit,3,Tue Jun 10 11:42:07 2014 UTC,Thanks. This makes me more excited then I already am.
AltJ,27pax4,Shamallama1,2,Tue Jun 10 11:56:37 2014 UTC,Yeah. I just hope the single isn't Warm Foothils because a) I don't think it would be a good single and b) I want to hear a totally new song.   My bet is on Nara.
AltJ,27pax4,KuchenFace,2,Tue Jun 10 12:27:01 2014 UTC,"If Nara has an intro and a reprise it will probably be a single, yeah. Second single would probably be one of the other early songs, so Every Other Freckle or Left Hand Free.  Edit: Tweet by Thom"
AltJ,27pax4,eftj,10,Tue Jun 10 13:19:20 2014 UTC,The track listing makes it sound almost like a concept album.
AltJ,27pax4,WarmFoothills,2,Mon Jun 9 17:13:50 2014 UTC,Man that'd be awesome
AltJ,27pax4,magicalhullabaloo,9,Tue Jun 10 03:26:09 2014 UTC,How has nobody mentioned the release of Warm Foothills?!
AltJ,27pax4,Lets-Tessellate,5,Mon Jun 9 17:54:58 2014 UTC,"I was at this festival, chose Alt-J over Eminem. Best decision of my life."
AltJ,27pax4,LadyoftheWood,6,Tue Jun 10 20:07:40 2014 UTC,It was mentioned at the time. There just wasn't enough attention by the casual fans probably.
AltJ,27pax4,LadyoftheWood,2,Mon Jun 9 18:37:05 2014 UTC,"It was mentioned on twitter and tumblr a few times by fans. But the band never really said much about it, if i remember correctly. It was for a small film that they scored that only got released in Britain. I haven't seen it but I don't think it'll ever be release in my area!"
AltJ,27pax4,CalistaDodd,7,Mon Jun 9 22:56:26 2014 UTC,"So very excited, I was hoping the release would be earlier so it would be a summer of ∆.  For those interested, sandbag is offering some cool t-shirt/pre-order bundles. (edit: a couple of the options have already sold out!)   I'm stoked the Warm Foothills made the album, I really love that tune and was bummed when I read it wasn't coming on. Also, does anyone have any word on Gwil? Is it going to be a three man band? Is someone going to replace him? Is the september release instead of the spring release due to him leaving and adjustments?"
AltJ,27pax4,Carterpaul,2,Mon Jun 9 17:48:01 2014 UTC,"When was a spring release ever mentioned? I don't remember about it.  They're pretty much a three piece now, but they might get a 4th guy to help them live."
AltJ,27pax4,wornmedown,2,Mon Jun 9 21:01:54 2014 UTC,What do you think the chance is of more tour dates announced?  I'm in NYC area but Beacon is not my favorite venue.

AltJ,27pax4,Captiankirk03,2,Mon Jun 9 16:03:30 2014 UTC,Are those previews supposed to be working? I can click play and the little GUI shows up but no sound's coming out.
AltJ,27pax4,blarrybob,3,Mon Jun 9 20:36:16 2014 UTC,"Yeah they're silent for now, I asked 7digital on twitter and they said they'll put the real previews on when it's time."
AltJ,27pax4,johandenijs,1 point,Mon Jun 9 20:59:57 2014 UTC,"I'm so excited for this!!! Heard Warm Foothills and I loved it!  Still bummed Gwil's no longer a part of Alt-J. I really, really hope to see them live!"
AltJ,27pax4,magicalhullabaloo,3,Mon Jun 9 18:07:20 2014 UTC,"So sad Gwil's gone, was mad talented, but this should still be a sick experience. I'm just happy I got to see them twice with Gwil still in the bad, I even got Gwil's towel one night!"
AltJ,27pax4,schiefer740,1 point,Mon Jun 9 19:46:33 2014 UTC,Why did he leave? I hope it doesn't affect (worsen) their sound too much.
AltJ,27pp2q,MichaelSchrute,3,Mon Jun 9 17:46:31 2014 UTC,That has been confirmed not real. Maybe it was a previous one before they decided the final tracklist.
AltJ,27pp2q,fabripav,2,Mon Jun 9 21:18:34 2014 UTC,What is the source of this image?

AltJ,27pp2q,WarmFoothills,2,Mon Jun 9 18:58:00 2014 UTC,"It's odd, it doesn't correspond with other tracklists found online. Good find though."
AltJ,27h5ee,fabripav,2,Fri Jun 6 15:31:01 2014 UTC,I think this will be the inner part of the cd/vinyl.

AltJ,27ez9e,helloitsmaya,2,Thu Jun 5 21:08:22 2014 UTC,Can someone tell me which song has the whistling in it? They played it live in September when I saw them and I haven't heard/seen it since.
AltJ,27ez9e,thekingh,3,Thu Jun 5 23:48:16 2014 UTC,"That's Warm Foothills. They said it wasn't planned to be on the next album, though. I guess it's a random song."
AltJ,27ez9e,thekingh,0,Fri Jun 6 01:26:12 2014 UTC,"That's a shame, I really like it. And thanks!"
AltJ,27ez9e,fabripav,0,Fri Jun 6 06:37:08 2014 UTC,I wonder if Warm Foothills is the only song made specifically for the movie

AltJ,24x60n,schiefer740,4,Sun Jun 8 04:54:41 2014 UTC,They're writing right now! Thom has posted a lot of photos on Instagram about them writing in the countryside!
AltJ,24x60n,supesawesome,2,Wed May 7 23:03:59 2014 UTC,"In April, they posted a brief very undetailed post about them being in the studio, but no real info."
AltJ,24x60n,watoosh,2,Wed May 7 18:51:05 2014 UTC,"Hey, mega-fan here. Thom has posted several vines and instagram videos of them in the studio. At the NME Awards, they said to expect the album within their lifetimes. Realistically, I'd say late 2014, 2015. Keep in mind that Gwil just left and AAW took several years."
AltJ,24x60n,illegalinjapan,2,Thu May 8 02:56:09 2014 UTC,"It doesn't appear as if they're touring at the moment and they have said that the departure of Gwil (the bassist) won't break up the band. I think they have a few songs written already, and I bet we'll hear news by the end of the year at the latest."

What draws me to Alt-J is the defined sound that when you listen it's obvious that it's THAT band playing. But I would also love to maybe see them pull a Muse and have a wildly successful second album compared to their first one.

All I've ever managed to do was get a setlist at a Radiohead show, but that required me to know the name of their lead guitar tech and have some witty banter beforehand."
AltJ,1m7xg8,hjc1710,2,Thu Sep 12 17:03:57 2013 UTC,"Me and my boyfriend love going to live shows it is our favorite thing. We don't mind showing up hours before doors and waiting outside so that we can have the best spots. I'm actually kind of spoiled by the front row now. When you are really close it is really easy, just get the tech's attention and ask. Sometimes they are mean and say ""well we don't give them out."" Okay, right. But mostly they are really happy to give them to people. Just be nice. Some people demand them and then make the techs feel bad when they don't get them. Those are general rules but Alt-J in particular, it's a really great story.  The first show they played in Dallas is when they opened for Grouplove. My boyfriend and I really went to go see them and we were the only people there who knew who they were. We screamed all the words and threw up the Delta sign throughout the show. At the end Gus threw us his set list because they could tell we were super fans, we didn't even have to ask!   Then when they played at Granada on St. Patrick's Day we got there super early, front row center and at the end of the show Joe handed me his set list and beads! We went behind the venue to get it signed (usually you have to wait at least an hour for them to come out if they do come out at all) and they were out there by the time we got out of merch. They signed our set list and we chatted. They are just some really nice bros, so chill and down to earth."
AltJ,1m7xg8,hjc1710,2,Thu Sep 12 18:26:05 2013 UTC,"You are preaching to the choir about live shows being your favorite thing to do in the world. I've done a long wait or two, culminating in two 10-12 hour waits for Radiohead shows (the one I mentioned where I got a setlist, I had to wait for 12 damn hours), one of which was tragically canceled by the stage collapse =(. And the front row is just... magical, it really fucking is. There's nothing quite like it and it always makes the wait worth it, makes it that much sweeter even.  I'm glad to see the general approach is just talk to the techs, before or after the show, that's what I was going to do =D.  Gus personally throwing you a setlist is... pretty awesome. And, I must say, I'm quite jealous of you getting Joe's setlist, beads, and them all signing it. I'm going to try the same stuff... would love to meet them =D.  How intense was the line when you got there all day? When did you arrive and how packed was it when you got there?"
AltJ,1m7xg8,Lets-Tessellate,2,Fri Sep 13 14:40:28 2013 UTC,"Well, their headlining show on St. Patrick's day wasn't too bad because the venue was in the middle of the parade route, so a lot of people that were going to the show were doing the parade first. Which was awesome for us because we didn't have to show up long before (4 hours before doors) and we had ample amounts of entertaining drunk people watching while we were waiting! We weren't the first people in line but the most important part of getting your spot it the entrance, you have to be almost running and getting to the stage as fast as you can because people behind you in line are trying to pass you. But the best thing I have learned is that if you are in the second row and you want to work your way forward during opening bands and such, find the people that are together and stand behind two people that aren't together. Because if you try to move up to the railing, there's a good chance they are going to have a problem with you coming between them. So observe people and figure out the optimal spot to stick your foot out and just inch your way in there. Also, being nice to people helps. I'll usually ask on of the people in front of me like ""hey, if a spit opens up next to you, would you mind if I squeezed in?"" And they always say yes. Then you don't feel like a dick, and they aren't pissed when you all get a little squished!  Also, best thing me and my boyfriend ever started doing for waiting before doors: LAWN CHAIRS. Seriously. You kind of look like a douche, but sitting on hot concrete (Texas) for half a day and then having a sore back and butt while you have to stand for the other half, is ridiculous and unnecessary.   That makes me think of the best pre-concert experience I ever had. We were waiting for The Postal Service and we got there SUPER early. And instead of ignoring the other people waiting, we all started talking. And one of the guys had cards against humanity in his car. We bonded as we played and it was really neat becoming friends with people you are usually competing with! All of us got front row center against the railing at the biggest venue in the DFW area. It was amazing. Sorry for going so off topic. Good times!"

Also, I didn't initially respond to this because my method of finding wallpapers mostly includes downloading photos by photographers that are copyright protected which I hate doing.  Here's some stuff:   You've probably seen An Awesome Wave Cover wallpapers from this subreddit. My method of finding photos when I can't find wallpaper sources is normally just a simple google image search. Do an advanced search and filter out only large images. Here is an example searching Alt-J from flickr with photos larger than 1024x768. Shoot The Stage also has awesome photos of a lot of different bands. Here is an album of the pictures I found that worked well on my mac. The first red one was my favourite.    edit: Also if someone could make a minimalistic delta wallpaper that would be amazing."

AltJ,1j6ukh,trafficrush,2,Sun Jul 28 02:43:36 2013 UTC,"I believe its about a convicted rapist. In the beginning of the song when they sing ""tra la"" they are actually singing the guys last name, or at least a part of it.  that's what I've been told anyway   Edit: look up Hubert selby Jr. apparently its about characters from one of his books. So there ya go."
AltJ,1j6ukh,imgettingbetternow,1 point,Sun Jul 28 00:42:51 2013 UTC,"From http://secretsoundshop.com/2012/05/22/interview-%E2%88%86-alt-j/:   What is Fitzpleasure?  Fitzpleasure? Erm  It’s not rude is it?  It is rude, well it’s not rude, it’s graphic and it’s violent. It’s based on a book by Hubert Selby Jr [Last Exit to Brooklyn]. Each chapter is about a different character and they all intertwine throughout the book. There’s a woman called Tralala so that’s why we sing [sings] Tra-la-la-la there’s a character called Tralala and it’s just about her. So basically the phrase is ‘in your snatch fits pleasure, broom shaped pleasure’ so fits and pleasure and Fitz like a second name, like Fitzpatrick so we thought Fitzpleasure, so more subtle. But it’s about the end of the chapter where she gets, er, gang-raped, so it’s really horrible."

It was just something I noticed during the concert and thought that maybe other listeners knew it, because the band might have done the same before."
AltJ,1gmyl1,beansley,4,Wed Jun 19 05:18:42 2013 UTC,"I watched a video of them doing it live, and it looks like he's just using a metal tube, high up on the strings of an electric guitar  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W3YQu00kXY&feature=youtube_gdata_player (I'd make this look prettier, but I'm on my phone and lazy)"
AltJ,1gmyl1,laurenlolauren,6,Wed Jun 19 08:42:12 2013 UTC,Actually this might sound crazy....but it looks like a little roll of duct tape....which would explain how he gets that drawn out sound instead of the hammer on tapping kinda sound
AltJ,1gmyl1,_Winters,6,Wed Jun 19 09:22:55 2013 UTC,"Correct! It's a little roll of tape, just played against the strings I think there's a bit of delay too."

AltJ,1gmyl1,laurenlolauren,1 point,Fri Jul 19 01:29:35 2013 UTC,"That would make a lot of sense! Thinking back, using something metal (like those slide guitar finger things) makes a sharp sound in contrast to using something more flexible (like the wood side of a violin bow), so using something rather bouncy like ductape would further de-tap/twang the sound, right? Good eye!"
AltJ,1gmyl1,CurlyMoonshine,3,Wed Jun 19 09:33:47 2013 UTC,"Apologies for being late to this party, but it's definitely using a roll of electrical tape. There's a video of them doing a live session at a radio station somewhere and he explains it during the interview. Will have a dig around now and see if I can find it. Edit: Can't find the video with the interview I remember, but this live vid shows it pretty well. http://youtu.be/ec8wdTukMkc?t=34m (Action at 34:00)"
AltJ,1gmyl1,Walking_Bandaid,1 point,Thu Jun 20 19:50:19 2013 UTC,"I recently saw them live and I was pretty interested to see them play this song live so I could see how he did this. It was their final encore song and I don't know much about guitar but the guy seemed like he was tapping all over the strings near the bottom of the neck. If memory serves, which it very well may not, it was the same guitar he had used in previous songs. No idea if they did anything special to it. Sorry not much of a help. They were awesome live by the way."
AltJ,1gmyl1,TwoOneEyedDogs,1 point,Wed Jun 19 12:13:26 2013 UTC,"I don't think it's a guitar, more like... a mandolin? I'm not sure either. But a good question!"
AltJ,1gmyl1,laurenlolauren,1 point,Wed Jun 19 06:29:37 2013 UTC,I guess its possible if they ran the mandolin through some effects. But I don't hear octaves and the mandolin has one little tiny octave string for each real one.
AltJ,1gmyl1,laurenlolauren,1 point,Wed Jun 19 06:48:26 2013 UTC,"Sorry man, but you must be thinking of a different instrument. Mandolins don't have octave strings.

AltJ,1gmyl1,laurenlolauren,1 point,Wed Jun 19 08:50:57 2013 UTC,You're right in my head for some reason I read twelve string.....there is no defense for said careless mistake. I even wrote mandolin in my response but it juatvslipped my mind. I bear my shame.
AltJ,1gmyl1,laurenlolauren,1 point,Wed Jun 19 09:17:38 2013 UTC,"Twelve strings are rather awesome, so I think this is a forgivable mistake! (Also, you should definitely look up what I think is called a 'devil's violin'. Double stringed and tuned all weird and thoroughly fantastic)"

AltJ,1ff4sf,burningrobot,3,Fri May 31 21:07:35 2013 UTC,"If you can't hear it, I can't convince you otherwise. But there's a reason all the lyric sites say the same thing.  Fitzpleasure is one of my favorite tracks from alt-j, but I had no idea what they were saying for the longest time until I looked it up. To me the opening line sounded like, ""he knows not fitzpleasure, boom she pleasure"", but the actual lyrics fit the sound and make more sense."
AltJ,1ff4sf,OrangeInACemetery,1 point,Fri May 31 21:33:48 2013 UTC,"I've seen multiple lyrics websites get things wrong before. Also, for whatever reason, sometimes bands sing different lyrics than even the officially-released ones. Just listened to it twice more...even if he's swallowing the ""l,"" the vowels don't match up. I agree that the lyrics to this song (and of course their music in general) can be odd and hard to distinguish, but the rest of them make perfect sense to me."

AltJ,1f2b4i,corbett656,2,Sun May 26 06:23:02 2013 UTC,Because its about rape.  And rape doesn't sell phones.
AltJ,1f2b4i,squanto1357,3,Sun May 26 07:24:21 2013 UTC,Did you even see the commercial? The new Nokia 928 low-light picture settings clearly rape the competition.

AltJ,1dh2d7,deathleeehallows,5,Wed May 1 10:24:05 2013 UTC,"I think it's him reflecting on his past. Like, when you sit down to eat or drink, you just think. So he's thinking about his past while drinking this glass of water. He's relaxing after this ""storm"" of emotions and events (probably with this girl). If you look at it in the context of the song, it's him reflecting. I don't think the water is a symbol.  Oh, also another thought that just popped into my mind: I'm not sure if it's just my unhealthiness, but people usually only drink glasses of water while at other people's houses. It makes me think of the classic scenario where you're working on someone's lawn, then you come inside and ask for a glass of water... He also talks about the girl's estate, so maybe they were living together, but then they broke up, so now he's arriving at his friend's house to crash until things settle down. And he's sitting at his friend's house, drinking this glass of water, and thinking about what happened. I'm thinking the song is about this guy going through divorce.  I'm really not sure about any of this. I'm probably just grasping at straws. All of their lyrics are beautiful, though. Even if you can't understand them at first. :)"

AltJ,1bnmdz,zaylac,2,Thu Apr 4 12:11:33 2013 UTC,didnt understand it till i listened to interlude 1
AltJ,1bnslr,iJScratch,4,Thu Apr 4 14:03:54 2013 UTC,Just listening to their whole album whilst lying on my bed with my MFLB
AltJ,1bnslr,RonanOverendable,5,Thu Apr 4 14:35:42 2013 UTC,Listened to Breezeblocks while giving my first ever bj to a beautiful man in Tel Aviv. He introduced me to Alt-J and to giving bjs! I love and miss him terribly.
AltJ,1bnslr,Etyler,2,Thu Apr 4 17:17:56 2013 UTC,Gave a woman the orgasm of her life to Tessellate.  Can't take all of the credit for it.
AltJ,1bnslr,kylander,3,Thu Apr 4 18:11:38 2013 UTC,"When I watched Léon: The Professional and Léon says ""This is from Matilda"". Matilda was one of my favorite songs, but I never bothered to look up what it was about. I'm glad I didn't, because that blew my mind."
AltJ,1bnslr,schiefer740,2,Thu Apr 4 14:48:55 2013 UTC,My boyfriend finally decided my taste in music wasn't crap. He nearly gave up on listening to my indie favorites. But now he actually likes at least ONE of my favorite bands.
AltJ,1bnslr,Katiek28,2,Thu Apr 4 20:37:29 2013 UTC,"I was at a house party with a smoke machine and blue lighting in one room which most people had left to go to other rooms, so it was just me and 2 other friends and we were pretty drunk and high and we put on An Awesome Wave and just lost ourselves in it, it was intense and serene, just awesome. However we got really lost in it and left the smoke machine on and people thought there was a fire because the smoke went through the floorboards into all the rooms of the house haha"
AltJ,1bo6l6,bananabed,2,Thu Apr 4 17:09:05 2013 UTC,Just came out on their iTunes session yesterday - https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/itunes-session/id630722505

AltJ,1bnrem,magillashuwall,5,Thu Apr 4 13:43:39 2013 UTC,"Hey, it's a cowbell with newspaper taped inside, i also use a tamborine above the cowbell live."
AltJ,1bnrem,_Winters,2,Mon May 6 18:44:07 2013 UTC,"Oh wow, thank you! I'm a big fan of alternative percussion arrangements.  That newspaper is doing well in giving you a signature!"

AltJ,1bnrem,nickntto,1 point,Tue Jun 4 05:24:21 2013 UTC,"Well from watching live videos I'm pretty sure that ""hi-hat"" sound that you hear is the tambourine in his drum set :)"

AltJ,1bnm96,Krae88,1 point,Thu Apr 4 12:08:20 2013 UTC,A little birdie told me that they will be doing a free pop-up show in town that day. Go to 947.fm and sign up for mobile updates to get the word the day of. shhh.
AltJ,1bnm96,larafayded,1 point,Thu Apr 4 18:22:04 2013 UTC,I heard that today too. I'm working on Monday though....and the secret shows usually happen in the day. Thanks for the info though.
AltJ,1bnlmz,papa_monzano,2,Thu Apr 4 11:53:49 2013 UTC,i believe it was because another band of the same name existed in the US. They talk about it in an interview. It might be their NPR Tiny Desk Concert video if you're curious. It's a good listen anyway...
AltJ,1bnlmz,schiefer740,3,Thu Apr 4 11:58:30 2013 UTC,Link here. One of my favorite Alt-J videos.
AltJ,1bhh4b,schiefer740,8,Tue Apr 2 01:46:32 2013 UTC,They just linked to this subreddit omg <3

AltJ,1bhh4b,Nervous_Energy,2,Thu Apr 4 11:56:15 2013 UTC,"Yea, seems like their music is popping up all over /r/Music recently (not complaining)"
AltJ,1bhh4b,BeazKahnees,2,Tue Apr 2 14:53:52 2013 UTC,"Probably attributed to the sheer amount of gigs they're playing in North America. Delighted for em, given the fickle sentiments of N.American tastes for some British bands."
AltJ,19mieh,Orca_AJL,2,Mon Mar 4 06:17:37 2013 UTC,Nice! Thanks for sharing its awesome the whole thing is up on youtube
