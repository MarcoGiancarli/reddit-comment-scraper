Even the worst asshole 15 year old boy will know that that was abuse (unless op explained it really really badly). Also the fact that she even had a boyfriend for a year with a dad like that is highly improbable. Tons of normal dad's don't let 15 year old girls date, let alone abusive ones. Usually abusive people are extremely controlling and would never let someone get that close to the person they are abusing, especially not if they were potentially ""stealing"" sex from them.

And although my state is not Canada, at least here, a parent with sole custody cannot remove their child from the state unless they have consent of the other parent or a court order. The custody doesn't alter their immediate ability to remove the child, only what the court will think of it when they ask for an order. If they do so without consent or an order, it's kidnapping. I would not be surprised if Canada was similar on this.   /u/lawnerdcanada also gave a pretty solid explanation of this being abduction under Canadian law."

""18 months ago they moved back to Canada because David needed to help care for his dying mother. And all living together in her house. ""  Must be a slow illness. A long time to be living with an ill parent.  Maybe there were some financial considerations to move back in with the parent.  ""David has moved out but his wife Beth and son are still living with his mother in her house. ""  That's interesting.   ""most of his family has sided with Beth"".  Why are there sides?  Hmmm... ""take their son and fight for full custody"". Why would she get full custody?  I have rarely seen full custody awarded except when there is substantial reasoning.  Maybe the reasoning is related to the family ""taking sides""  I sometimes think that the activists of Men's Rights are so toxic that, if they were instead fighting cancer, people would cheer for cancer instead.  I can think of no better description than ""toxic"". It is an absolute cesspool of a cause. Not because of the cause itself, indeed there are a lot of men's issues that need addressing, but the movement itself is just so horrible and crass.  I think there is more to this story.  Regardless, what exactly did OP think ""Beth"" should do?   Not pursue the best resolution for herself?  Go back to Taiwan to make David happy?

To be fair, while it may not be easy, it is at least possible-- some people bought a plot of land near my house and then moved their house to it from somewhere else. They apparently transported it in two pieces, because it had been cut in half down the middle. Then, they left it sitting on top of cinder blocks in the area that was supposed to be the back yard, while the foundation for it to go on was actually built... which took a while. Their house was sitting in its own back yard for months.  It was kinda baffling all around. It was a regular house, not a mobile home or anything, but it wasn't exactly a super-nice house, and we never figured out why they didn't just build a new one instead of going to all the trouble to saw this kinda boring-looking house in two and move it. We guessed that it might've been a ""Pappy built this house with his own two hands, I'm not selling it!"" sort of situation, and apparently Pappy was a really thorough architect because that thing held up for ages on its cinder blocks, and they still somehow managed to get it put back together eventually. You can't even tell it was ever chopped up and moved now, from the outside.  But yeah, that's not the sort of thing I'd recommend to someone who's already facing foreclosure. Still gotta pay for a whole new foundation, and at that point, you might as well just pay for a new house to go on top of it."

Cost I'm sure. Moving a house (depending on size and how far you're moving it and the route it has to travel) can vary immensely, but it can be as cheap as $15k. Figure $10k for the foundation and whatever was paid for the plot and the cost of moving a home could be considerably cheaper than building a new one.  This might especially be true if the home is paid off or mostly paid off. Rather than get a full mortgage on a new home, get a loan/mortgage on the cost of half the mortgage (or a quarter depending on house costs in the area) and still have your home.

This is to the point that the Orange County public schools frequently propose (threaten?) to go to a four-day week to save money. But, ultimately, I think Florida both attracts people who engage in non-normative social behavior and has a sub-culture/social system that encourages it. The attraction, I think, is largely a backfire of marketing of Florida as a get-rich/live-fast/vacation-and-party spot. In the past 20 years, they've pivoted to more family-friendly marketing, but there's still a reason people have been going to Panama City and Daytona for spring break for decades. As for the sub-culture, I noticed that there are very few strong neighborhoods in Florida. It's just as common to meet someone who moved to Florida as it is to meet someone who was born there, and it's practically rare to find someone born in Florida whose parents were also born in Florida. So, you don't have the multi-generational social structures in place. Also, the weather and low walk-scores means you drive everywhere, removing opportunities to meet people. Add to that the facts that a lot of homes and apartments are empty during the summer (snowbirds) or all the time (mortgage crisis), many neighborhoods were built within the past 20 years, and a hefty chunk of the economy revolves around tourism. All in all, I think it just incrementally adds up to being a wacky place.  I don't know about Germany, though...."

Even ignoring everything else, the ""I""s would certainly be capitalised in anything that Google spat out, which they aren't here.  The punch/slap thing is definitely something that's coming from the writer, not from Google. There's no context or reason for Google to decide that that second word should be ""slap"" rather than ""hit"" or ""punch"". There are distinct words in Spanish for a punch and a slap, but they aren't commonly distinguished between in everyday speech so it is very unusual for someone with this supposed level to know and use the word 'slap' when they are apparently still directly translating everything from Spanish. For comparison, there are two words for 'ear' in Spanish: ""oído"" is the inner bit and ""oreja"" is the outside bit - can you see how it'd be really odd for an English speaker to know that difference without knowing how to say their age? Add to that the fact that the Spanish words for 'slap' carry much more of a feminine meaning than the English equivalent, more like the phrase ""bitch slap"". It would be unusual to use it when talking about an abusive father.  And that's just one tiny thing. There is a shit load more that makes it so obvious he's not a Mexican."

Some of their errors sound like a Spanish speaker, but some of them clearly don't   i am 15 year child.   Spanish: Soy un nino de 15 anos or Tengo 15 anos Bad English: ""I am child of 15 years"" or ""I have 15 years""   they do not come here by law   Ilegal and legal have direct english equivalents. It's likely that a Spanish speaker would use different English words with a latin origin.   pull my hair with very force   Spanish: Me arranca el pelo con mucha fuerza Bad English: ""He pulls me the hair with much force""  But, at the same time...   this guys are criminal and dangerous guy.   ""This"" and ""These"" can easily sound similar for a Spanish speaker, and it's a very common error to make. (/z/ and /ɪ/ don't exist in Spanish) Arguably the same for ""ran"" vs ""run"".   they will take us to mexico back   Spanish: nos sacan otra vez a mexico Bad English: they take (again/back) us to mexico  I don't want to make conclusions here, because I don't want some Reddit comment kremlinology resulting in the failure to stop a case of domestic abuse, but you could reasonably raise doubt about the user being a native Spanish speaker.    What would be telltale errors to look for?  Indirect object pronouns - ""Can you edit something for me?"" becomes ""Can you edit me something?""  Accidental agreement of adjectives - ""Green tomatoes"" becomes ""Greens tomatoes / Tomatoes greens""  False friends - ""My mother is pregnant"" becomes ""my mother is embarassed"" or ""Our current strategy"" becomes ""our actual strategy"""

And like any addiction, it can be almost impossible not to relapse when it's sitting right in front of you and you're not accountable to anyone. It's not necessarily an easy thing to flush it, or in this case delete it, when it's right there."

Obviously the original seller should have deleted it him/herself, but you'd think the reseller would reformat them as a matter of course. It's not like ebay or something where it's coming directly from the previous owner, at least from the sound of things.  Again, no legal action, but I do think he's got plenty of cause to complain to customer service."

Some people do develop an unhealthy or compulsive relationship with stuff that isn't chemically addicting, and you might as well call that an addiction too since it functions in pretty much the same way. The chemicals involved are just responses in your brain rather than anything the object gives you directly.

bestoflegaladvice,3cy6oj,refreshing_napalm,-2,Sun Jul 12 15:30:47 2015 UTC,"He's talking about intent, not aim.  Your intent should not be ""kill this person"" (and it especially shouldn't be ""wound this person"", which shows a deep misunderstanding of reality), it should be ""remove this guy as a threat in any way possible, up to and including killing him"".  You aim for center of mass because that's the most reliable way to accomplish that goal, but if you miss and they turn around and run the fuck away...mission accomplished.  You can stop shooting.  The threat has been stopped.  If your intent was to kill or to wound, you would keep shooting because you haven't killed or wounded them, but now you're outside the realm of self defense."

bestoflegaladvice,3cy6oj,Smgth,25,Sun Jul 12 04:50:28 2015 UTC,"I think people are coming down on you hard because you've never heard of this.   You can't shoot to wound because you're not an expert on the human body.   I was a very specialized medic. A lot of my learning dealt with triage. If a guy is shot in the lung, I've got time. Even though that's a center mass shot to a vital organ. It takes around 15 minutes for a person to die from that.   If a guy is shot in the leg, that's a lethal wound depending on what I find. He could die in minutes without care.   In a mass casualty situation, you're running around like a hamster on meth trying to stop the immediate life threatening things and prioritize everything else.   I'm an expert marksman and a very highly trained medic. I don't think I can accurately shoot to wound."
bestoflegaladvice,3cy6oj,IntrepidusX,13,Sun Jul 12 05:11:13 2015 UTC,"Absolutely wrong.  If you're actually in danger, you would need to be shooting to stop the threat by shooting at center of mass, not doing some Hollywood movie ""wounding"" shot.  If you're not in danger, then you don't need to be shooting anyone period."
bestoflegaladvice,3cy6oj,ProfessorStein,12,Sun Jul 12 05:11:52 2015 UTC,"The use of a gun is always considered lethal force. Period. That means if the gun comes out and you're going to pull the trigger, in the eyes of the law you're attempting to kill them. If you happen to be a good enough shot to shoot to disable, the law attributes it to poor marksmanship.  So if you're going to be viewed under the law as if you were killing someone, you better make sure the situation calls for it.  It's also in your best interest to actually kill the other person. As sick and twisted as it sounds, dead men tell no tales and also tell no lies. If the other guy is dead there's just your version of things and the evidence to tell a story."

The posher a place, the more overheads it has (fancy linen and silverware, much higher food and labour costs etc), so these owners would open a fast-casual type place with low overhead that turned over a lot of customers per night. A restaurant can be full every night, even booked out three months in advance and be lucky to break even."

This is something done by successful and unsuccessful owners alike, and I would wager that it's even more common with unsuccessful owners.  So many owners are unwilling to make changes to their fancy restaurant to bring it out of the red because of an oftentimes irrational fear of ""lowering tone"" or alienating long-term loyal customers (""We can't switch to paper napkins, that's what they give you at McDonalds!"").  So they open a greasy hamburger joint with no baggage and run it properly, hoping that their losses at the fancy restaurant will turn out to be just a temporary downturn.

He tells you he's opening up a new location.  100,000 gets you a 12% stake in ownership.   Six months later you learn the man had $200,000 in assets and $1,000,000 in debt from the restaurant and his lavish lifestyle that was, in no way, indicative of the success of his business.  Your 100,000 just finished paying the salary of his workforce. The new location never even managed to open before bankruptcy hit.   Happens EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.  Blows my mind.  Turning a big profit in a small business with a lot of labour costs in this economy is hugely fucking difficult.  Some of the best businessmen in the world are spinning their tires trying to make a buck in some major corporations. There are restauranteurs with 20+ years of experience going bankrupt.    I'm skeptical that OP's boss is profitable enough to increase wages that much. New location or not.

bestoflegaladvice,3cvjr4,--u-s-e-r-n-a-m-e--,53,Sat Jul 11 12:39:45 2015 UTC,"I think the point is that if you work for a restaurant as a server, they will schedule you for 40 hours in total shift time, but in actuality you only work 25-30 hours because as soon as it starts slowing down they start cutting people.  For example, I'm scheduled to work from 11:45am-9:00pm today.  But my actual hours will most likely be 11:45-1:30 and 5:45-8.  Unless we get unexpectedly busy or I'm randomly picked to be the lucky server to work through the afternoon, I'll work 4 hours of the 9.5 hour shift.  Servers don't choose to work sub-40 hour weeks most places, they do so because of the nature of the business.  At the same time, you can't schedule another job during the off-hours because you might be working.  Asking for a higher wage to account for the fact that management isn't allowing you to work the hours you are scheduled for and want to work is not that unreasonable."

bestoflegaladvice,3cvjr4,improperlycited,10,Sat Jul 11 21:39:45 2015 UTC,"Logistical difficulties are preferable to financial ones, though, and as far as I can see, the major financial difficulty is that $15/hr just isn't realistic for these restaurants. /u/CujoCrunch had a good point: there's work to do in a restaurant that isn't just limited to waiting tables, work that can be performed on off hours. The problem with raising wages to compensate for a bad scheduling system is that raising wages actually incentivizes the behavior that causes the problem. If waiters are now $15/hr, priority 1 becomes making sure that waiters aren't working when they aren't needed. Another option that I think would make more sense is compensation at a reduced rate for standby hours."
bestoflegaladvice,3cvjr4,--u-s-e-r-n-a-m-e--,3,Sun Jul 12 11:48:33 2015 UTC,"If the restaurant can't afford to pay more to the servers, there is a pretty fundamental impasse that cannot be breached.  Either the servers accept less money than they want, or the restaurant goes out of business.    If the business can afford it but doesn't want to, I think it's reasonable for the servers to ask for higher wages within the framework of how the restaurant treats them.  I think it's also reasonable for the restaurant to counter with an offer of guaranteed hours.  But I think it's more reasonable for the servers to request a raise than for the servers to request that the business change the way they operate.  Fundamentally, I agree with you that the optimal solution is probably for the business to change the way they operate, but I don't think that's the best request for the servers to make."

bestoflegaladvice,3ct5n3,dirtyrogue,44,Fri Jul 10 16:59:36 2015 UTC,Can staying with an employer who behaves like this like this really be good for one's career?
bestoflegaladvice,3ct5n3,carboncle,-12,Fri Jul 10 16:54:20 2015 UTC,"It certainly looks better than getting fired.  If they were an architect getting shit on it might be better to stick to their guns, but they're a receptionist and while it would be best if they started looking elsewhere companies aren't exactly going to actively try to recruit them.  Sometimes when you're the low man you've got to eat shit."
bestoflegaladvice,3ct5n3,AnnaLemma,36,Fri Jul 10 16:56:16 2015 UTC,"I would say the opposite, actually. It's way easier to find a job as a receptionist than as an entry-level architect from what I've seen."
bestoflegaladvice,3ct5n3,carboncle,17,Fri Jul 10 17:04:21 2015 UTC,"For sure - first of all, architects in particular have notably shitty employment rates, and second receptionist jobs are much more generic and therefore adaptable.  An architect has a limited number of job openings. But receptionists? Everybody has receptionists, and it's trivial to switch between industries. Medical, legal, construction, finance - doesn't matter. Maybe hospitality will want to see other hotel-related experience.   Bookkeeping seems to be much the same: you almost never see references to specific industries (with the possible exception of construction - most of those have a ""soft"" preference for bookkeepers who have other construction experience, but it's ""preferred"" rather than ""required""). They just want to know what you've successfully done those types of tasks for someone."
bestoflegaladvice,3ct5n3,smileyman,7,Fri Jul 10 17:13:47 2015 UTC,And even if you have trouble finding permanent employment there's way more of a temp market for receptionists to see you through in the interim. Fill-in architects tend to come from other projects or get borrowed from less busy firms.
bestoflegaladvice,3ct5n3,carboncle,19,Fri Jul 10 19:37:10 2015 UTC,An employer who gave you a bonus and then asked for it back isn't going to be likely to give you a promotion or a raise later on. Additionally it's been my experience that employers which need to be hassled by employees to make accommodations for disabilities tend to dead-end the careers of those same employees.

This isn't ""but what if my son has underaged sex decades away,"" she has reasons for thinking what she thinks and asking the questions she's asking. I don't see a lot of substance in people's replies, even when she adds details that lead her to disagree.   I'd like to know why the company can apparently ask for the money back at any time. That would be useful to know. Can anyone who's given me money demand it back and I have to comply? Or is that professional advice rather than legal advice?"
bestoflegaladvice,3ct5n3,sylban,26,Fri Jul 10 18:49:21 2015 UTC,"If your company legitimately overpays you - which happens sometimes, like someone in Payroll hits the wrong button and you're paid at twice your usual rate or something - they have the right to recoup that money. It's more than you're owed, so you're not entitled to it.  In this OP's case, the evidence suggests that this was not, in fact, an error on the company's part, or that if it was they're pretty well SOL. They gave her a note stating the amount of the bonus and the reasoning behind it, other people in support positions got a similar bonus, it's been 6+ months, etc. So assuming there's not something on their side that she missed, it's unlikely the firm would be able to prove they're owed the money in order to get it back from her."

bestoflegaladvice,3couml,placebo_addicted,9,Thu Jul 9 23:34:11 2015 UTC,"To quote Sir Ernest Bowers, who wrote The Complete Plain Words (which was an effort by the UK Civil Service in the 1950s to stop its officials from writing verbose, incomprehensible texts):   The golden rule is not a rule of grammar or syntax. It concerns less the arrangement of words than the choice of them.  ""After all,"" said Lord Macaulay, ""the first law of writing, that law to which all other laws are subordinate, is this: that the words employed should be such as to convey to the reader the meaning of the writer.""   The golden rule is to pick those words and to use them and them only. Arrangement is of course important, but if the right words are used they generally have a happy knack of arranging themselves.   This guy is basically doing the complete opposite. Choosing the words he doesn't need for the meaning and not even arranging them correctly.  Even keeping the awkwardly formal style in there, his sentence could be rewritten as:   I am writing to you as your experience and advice would be useful to me in a matter I am involved in.   That is the entire core of the meaning of that sentence. The bit about 'hindsight' is just a crowbarred-in idiom for platitude's sake."

I did one day in the NICU on my clinical rotations. It was mostly really boring, but there was one guy who went nuts for some reason and had to be escorted out by security. Apparently that's common. Also probably about a third of the babies there were just basically completely incapable of life, waiting to die, and it felt so cruel that they were being kept alive"

But lots of babies make it nowadays. She's been in the NICU for 30 years and when she started they used to lose the majority of babies. Now, the majority make it out. And there's even research on the impacts of drug addiction at birth and there's treatments to minimize the damage from the drugs.   And if you take the drug addicts out of the equation and look at survival rates, it's something like 3/4 or 4/5! So yaaaay :)"

Things like one kid had his white matter and grey matter in all the wrong places and was seizing 100 times+ per day. Another kid had Down's and three other severe genetic abnormalities that I forget and all of them combined were basically making him grow wrong and his internal organs were failing and collapsing. One preemie's lungs weren't developing at all, and the resident showed me another 22/23 weeker's vitals steadily declining over the past week and said this was pretty much how most preemies die in the NICU and there's not much they can do.  I realized after about 5 minutes I was probably sent on the NICU rotation because my professors know I have basically no soul and the rest of my classmates would probably have spent the whole day there crying."

bestoflegaladvice,3cms6j,C1V,16,Thu Jul 9 07:17:13 2015 UTC,"And the defendant would be found guilty of murder and sentenced to death if Phoenix couldn't establish beyond reasonable doubt that the baby had motive and opportunity, and he can't cause the baby to cackle madly and admit its guilt.  I've been playing through the trilogy collection recently, and while there are some good murder mysteries, this fucking game... The NA localization is most insistent that it definitely takes place in Murica. Y'know, where there are no juries in murder cases. And there are quaint Japanese villages in the mountains filled with women wearing kimono. Oh, and guilt is determined by a plurality of evidence... submitted by the prosecutor. Which the defense is not entitled to know anything about by the trial. And the only grounds for acquittal for murder (and a death sentence) is finding the real murderer and proving such beyond reasonable doubt, including establishing motive and opportunity for the witness to commit murder. Also, it is only actually a death sentence if the defendant is convicted? Maybe? It's kind unclear. But the point is, if there is any hole in the defenses argument that can't be filled, the defendant dies. Like, if Phoenix can only prove that the defendant could not have possibly committed the murder, that isn't good enough. If he can't prove that the witness was definitely at the murder scene and had motive and most certainly definitely killed the victim, bam! Death sentence. Also, I know that ""but they are clearly evil"" isn't admissible evidence in real life, but in real life criminals don't cackle madly every time their lies are revealed. Also, prosecutors are all scum who will let nothing stand in the way of reaching a guilty verdict. Except Edgeworth. Sometimes. And defense attorneys are all good people who will let nothing get in the way of an acquittal. Except that one time.  Ugh..."

bestoflegaladvice,3ck60a,mizmoose,-1,Wed Jul 8 23:45:39 2015 UTC,"Right, but it's still possible, just not overly likely. The best reasons on that infographic are that it's a very slow process, and that the transmission change would have to be dramatic for the virus to keep the mutation, as the transmission is already fairly good / evolutionarily speaking it's already pretty solid. Neither of which make it impossible... particularly that second one, as it's possible to have multiple 'silent' mutations that eventually worked up to a transmission mutation."

You can go to their profile and click the add friend button under their username. You can also just go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/friends/ and put in their username.  One you have them added you can use /r/friends to see any comments and submissions they post.  Not sure about AlienBlue as I don't use that app.

I'm reminded of a vacant lot of land where my mother used to live many years ago (Australia). Almost everyone in the neighborhood would walk through it to get to public transit. And it was just starting to get to the point where access through it would become a permanent requirement based on common law, so the owner of the lot put up a fence. And then someone broke the gate in the fence about a day later, so we all started going through it again.   This went back and forth for a few years after that, with occasional repairs, and I have no idea if the owner of the lot has gotten around to developing on it yet, or if they're now in trouble, but i figured eventually it'd happen, and it'd be fascinating if someone tried to claim that they had through access and the legal battle that'd ensue.  Like, if putting the gate up and having it be there for a day confers ""no through access"" and the clock reset and then started ticking again, or if it resumed ticking from the old value, etc."

He came in and told the teller ""I got an email that says I owe you $600"". The teller was pretty calm and asked if it was a loan or a credit card balance. The guy said credit and she asks if he'd like to make a payment and then this is when the fun started- he said ""I have to pay that back?"". This guy didn't know that a credit card wasn't just free money. He started freaking out and he was starting to get really worked up and kept saying things like ""I have to pay that back? What do you mean? I don't have $600- ect"".  At this point someone I assume was a manager came out from behind the counter and asked the guy if there was something wrong. He was kind of hysterical and asking her how he was supposed to come up with six hundred dollars. To her credit the manager was very calm and tried to explain that it didn't all have to be paid off then- that it could even be beneficial to carry a bit of a balance. But he did not want to hear it.  When I left- which was about five minutes after everything had started- he was still talking with the manager trying to sort out exactly how credit cards worked."

To get it out you either need ID (ID card is mandatory here) or the ATM card with the PIN. The logic being putting restrictions on putting money into an account is pretty meaningless because it's not a problem.  And as of this year, all bank account numbers across the EU have been standardized as IBAN numbers and transfers have moved over to the SEPA (Single Europan Paymens Area) system which works across all EU countries (I would imagine EEA+Switzerland, too). So if I had a bill in another country, I could pay it directly from my local account.  Seriously, the Fed in the US is really terrible about that duty as the ACH system was innovative in the 80's but is a dinosaur now. Aren't certain banks in the US starting to set up a private clearinghouse to make instant transactions possible?"

There are loads of American 50's style diners lime Eddie Rocket's and Captain America which would be much more expensive but some of that is because of server's wage and lack of tipping culture.  I'd say the Irish MacDonald's quality is better than the States (Irish beef is pretty good). The food portions are smaller and the drink sizes are much smaller. But minimum wage is higher so we were doing well on the ""Big Mac Index"" (Looks like we dropped out of the Top Ten fastest since I last checked). Also McDonald's locations tend to be a bit nicer and, yeah, it sells itself as ""good"" food.   Overall smaller but better food at a higher price in a nicer building."

Actually one of my friends who worked at a hardware store got in big trouble for accepting a check that ended up bouncing.  Fwiw I'm only 24 and I use them all the time. Every apartment I've ever had has required checks to be mailed. Every job has given me a physical paycheck. Also I find it by far the easiest way to settle my debts with friends

Though yeah, a lot of my check writing is to individuals and/or small businesses where credit cards aren't really an option. For example, back when I rented a house instead of an apartment I paid the guy who mowed the lawn with a check. I hired a dog walker for when I don't have the time to walk my dog on weekdays and leave a check instead of cash for the dog walker to pick up. When I leased a horse as a teen I wrote checks to the owner and paid for my lessons with checks.  So these were mostly businesses or people who were mobile or not near an electric outlet (aside from those newfangled doohickeys that plug into your phone, but these are also people who don't necessarily adopt technology quickly) so it was checks or not at all. In general, though, I think nearly everywhere that can take credit cards, does so (except for that one damned hipster collective pizza place in Berkeley where I wrote them a $3 check out of spite because they wouldn't take cards when there was no decent reason not to)."

You would put the name and amount in your checkbook and keep a running total of your balance on your own in the checkbook, by doing math. At the end of the month the bank would mail you the checks back, and an account statement.  You would go through and check off each check against the account statement and your checkbook. If all was matching, at some point your running balance for the end of the month would match the bank's balance, and you would put a double line underneath that point.  There would still be checks outstanding that hadn't cleared yet.   And of course you would have often missed something or flubbed up your subtraction and you'd have to go back through and fix the checkbook.  Or a check wouldn't have cleared and you'd have to adjust for that.  It was very, very tedious."

Even if it is true and compensates per capita, which I all-but-guarantee it isn't and doesn't, it is the dumbest fucking argument I have ever seen.  What we can conclude from this statement is, bearing in mind that not all rapists get shot, and (allegedly) the number of rapists shot (some tiny fraction of the number of actual rapists) in America exceeds the number of rapes (presumably exceeding the number of rapists) in Canada, that there are many more rapists in America than in Canada.

bestoflegaladvice,3cdw30,TreacherousBeagle,-3,Tue Jul 7 21:42:35 2015 UTC,"...You are conflating two separate issues. You act as though his [hypothetically] making a joke is part and parcel with therefore not seeking legal advice. It's as though you think the two are mutually exclusive; if he doesn't treat reddit like real life, then he can't take anything on reddit seriously? You're also responding to something you imagine I said, but didn't. I don't care if he was making a joke or not, or how that affects the likelihood of his seeking legaladvice online. I was merely responding to the proposition by /u/Wyartip that the OP was in fact not joking because if Wyartip were the one being accused of real-life murder ""[Wyartip] would try to clarify it."" My suggestion was that some people don't give a fuck and wouldn't try to correct a joke, myself included.   I'll go ahead and get myself some more downvotes here: the paucity of analytical thinking demonstrated by your response, and on /r/legaladvice in general, is staggering. But this is only a recent phenomenon, as the subreddit has grown and attracted many new readers and posters. For whatever reason, ""the law"" holds some allure for people online, to the point that it suffers from an exaggerated circlejerk amongst the already circlejerk-heavy world of online forum posting. There's something that people love about being able to haphazardly give some stilted, hackneyed, legal advice over the interwebz.

Joe knew the other friend smoked pot but Joe himself didn't, so Joe wasn't all that surprised when he got his car back and it smelled kinda like pot.  What did surprise him, though, was that it kept on smelling strongly like pot. For days. Finally, Joe goes to investigate, discovers that the other friend actually left pot in the car, right in the glovebox where Joe would have to open it to get his registration and insurance. Needless to say, Joe was very, very pissed, and very glad he hadn't gotten pulled over for anything in the past week!  And this, kids, is why if you don't want to get in trouble for someone else's actions, you don't let them transport illegal substances in your car.

As someone who is a locksmith who studies locks, I am telling you, specifically, in locksmithing, no one calls safecrackers lockpickers. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""burglary family"" you're referring to the legal grouping of Breaking and Entering, which includes things from willful tresspassers to home invaders to car theives.  So your reasoning for calling a safecracker a lockpicker is because random people ""call opening a lock lockpicking?"" Let's get homeowners and Skyrim players in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a burglar or a thief? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A safecracker is a safecracker and a member of the locksmith family. But that's not what you said. You said a safecracker is a lockpicker, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the locksmith family lockpickers, which means you'd call auto locksmiths, petty thieves, and other lock enthusiasts lockpickers, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

You've said your rent is 999 and included utilities are 53.28 (are you sure it isn't 54.28?).

I've been contesting it since last month, even my bank realized the error they made and refunded their fee back. The complex has no right to charge a fee themselves, it cost them NOTHING to NOT get my money. They never cashed a fucking check at all, it was just an electronic transfer that automatically went through and then automatically came back, nobody actually did anything.  What they're trying to do is just get money out of me over nothing, just so they can have more money, not because I actually cost them anything. I am 1000% sure Chase never charged them a god damn penny over this.  And yea, for the money I'm paying, I SHOULD be getting the amenities I PAY FOR, that's the whole point of rent for these similarly sized units costing several hundred dollars more! I moved here for some peace, and luxury, and relaxation, and I'm certainly not getting that when every day it feels like it's being run by a slum lord that doesn't listen to his residents or take care of any issues until he is absolutely forced to.   I could find even bigger townhomes, some even with more bedrooms, at cheaper prices. I picked this place specifically because of the amenities they offered.  And yes, I did complain about the broken and unfinished stuff since the beginning. It wasn't until recently I actually gave them written notices, but they always heard it from me orally once in a while, as well as many other dozens of times from other residents, politely asking those pieces of shit when they'd finally get around to fixing stuff. Just like all the other residents, waiting for their rent to actually be worth it, waiting to finally pay for what they were advertised and promised when they signed the leasing contract.  I have every fucking right to be pissed off and yell at them in an email. I WANT the court to see the anger, frustration, and emotional distress they are causing over NEVER listening to the complaints by me or ANY of the residents over all these months (some of them years) we've been here. There is a reason this overpriced complex can barely keep a 2 star rating anywhere.   I reiterate: I never said I only complained last month just because of the bounced check. I was complaining to them orally since the beginning, off and on, asking when they'd finally get this shit fixed, and they'd either say ""Later, we called this guy"" or ""Later, we ordered this part"" and never follow through or the big boss would just get all pissy and bitchy and yell at me to get out and stop bothering me. OH I'm sorry for bothering you for not fucking giving me what I've been paying for all these months! And they have done this with multiple residents. Go ahead, and for once, actually read the reviews I kept referring to.  I talked to them, off and on, for months, saying I shouldn't be paying the full price each month they're denying me these amenities that were promised, the sole reason I chose this complex over any of the others I easily could have had for several hundred dollars less per month.  Again, for the dozenth time, this happened LONG before the bounced check. I was demanding for partial refunds the whole time, politely in person, until the day they finally sent me a notice to pay THEM a fee. Fuck no, give me the partial refunds I was owed every month first, then we'll talk about me paying YOU a fee.  Do you guys finally get it? Have I explained like you're five well enough? Did I repeat myself enough in a variety of ways where it finally clicks in your head what happened?"

Fuck no, give me the partial refunds I was owed    You are not owed any ""partial refunds"". They haven't agreed to refund a penny to you at any point, or you surely would have said so.  Quote the section of your lease that lists the amount of the ""partial refund"" they owe you if the sauna breaks down. Go on... Needless to say, it doesn't exist. But there is something about a returned check/payment/NSF fee, right?  And thus you lose in court.

Most rational adults realize that exercising their ""right"" to write scathing, profanity-laden emails is going to work against them, not for them.

There is a reason this overpriced complex can barely keep a 2 star rating anywhere.   Go ahead, and for once, actually read the reviews I kept referring to.

I'd expect at least $2000 for that kind of stuff.  I suspect that it being so cheap is why nothing is getting fixed.  Sure, you have a ""right"" to say what you want in email, but if you show the courts what you posted, they're going to see someone having a temper tantrum.  There are ways to express anger and frustration without resorting to bad language and ""yelling.""  Other people have tried to explain this to you: You do not have a right to ""refunds.""  There are typically rules and laws about when rent doesn't have to be paid or when it can be pro-rated based on but those problems always have to do with the apartment being habitable.  You have no water for more than 24 hours?  That's not a place you can safely live.  You have a broken screen on your window?  That's an inconvenience.  And as to your last paragraph: Nothing says immaturity more than insulting people whom you asked for help.  If you don't like the answers you got on /r/legaladvice then take your butt to a real estate attorney's office and let them explain to you how you have no idea what you're talking about.

bestoflegaladvice,3bze8q,overk4ll,-83,Wed Jul 15 18:51:01 2015 UTC,"Alright... over the months I've spent on Reddit I've noticed a pattern. Few people are going to like to hear this, but here goes: whenever there is a sexually ambiguous situation like this brought up (whether on this sub or /r/relationships and /r/sex), people love to cry PERVERT, CREEP, WEIRDO, etc and shame OP. I know people will likely read this as me being a rape apologist, but bare ^ with me. If a girl said ""No"" to you, but it was a ""Noooooo, we shouldn't. You're so baaad."" *giggle, then you wouldn't stop either - especially if she continues making out with you. Yeah, the girl clearly felt (quite a bit) more strongly about the uncomfortableness of the situation the next day, but that doesn't immediately mean that OP doesn't deserve the benefit of the doubt.  Yes, there IS always the possibility that OP is one of the above stated nouns, but it seems Redditors often don't even consider that OP may have made a human mistake.  Also, to make Reddit hate me even more, this attitude is extremely pervasive in the anglosphere, which would explain its ubiquity here.   Edit: and if you feel like voting, up or down, I would rather hear what you have to say instead.  Edit 2 - added on from another comment: When it comes to legal advice, yes, for a fact I would make myself sound worse to cover all my bases ... OP gives us little to go by and this girl could have just had serious post-makeout regret and be generally ashamed of her sexuality and, again, that OP was not giving us all the details for brevity's and strategy's sake.  My analogies are not the most tactful, so I'll think about formulating them differently. But the general point is: Reddit is quick to shame people for their sexual mishaps etc. without making much effort to put themselves in those people's shoes.. That's the point.   In this case, OP is young, and stupid, yes. But to make him feel like a rapist when he is likely more just immature is wrong IMO. When a girl says no, it means no - something I should point out which I believe in and hold to in my personal life. Mixed signals alone can be quite a turn off. But again, did she say ""No.""/""Stop."" and actually want to stop, or did she continue to make out with him and give him mixed signals?  Edit 3: tact, style"

Take you going did she say no assertively enough? As if that's a thing now, like some woman gets gangraped in a bus and the police should go ""Oooooh, did she say ""No!"" though or just ""no""?""  It's like yeah rape culture does exist, cause guys don't really get boundaries and are not just ignorant as to what constitutes as crossing the line, but get down right defensive about it and go with your route of ""if she didn't want to be touched inappropriately, she should have stopped kissing him"". That, is fucked up.   So yes, in this situation, it's called for. To get the message across to you and everyone else reading it who thinks like you or OP to stop fucking around with this shit.   I mean seriously I'm not even an activist in the slightest definition of the word yet the more time I spend on reddit, the more I realise there's a really worrying huge fucking problem. So yes shame the dude away and get the message across that this shit's a no go.   And just to draw the line, the dude's not remorseful. He's just shitting himself cause he's now been informed what he did was a crime. That's like me killing someone and then worrying I might have to go to jail for killing someone. I'm not actually sat there remorseful about killing the guy, I just don't want to go to jail.

You're so baaad."" *giggle, then you wouldn't stop either    As a girl, if I said this, I would appreciate the guy still checking to make sure whether or not I wanted to stop for real. Giving and obtaining consent is sexy, y'all.    especially if she continues making out with you.... When a girl says no, it means no - something I should point out which I believe in and hold to in my personal life. Mixed signals alone can be quite a turn off. But again, did she say ""No.""/""Stop."" and actually want to stop, or did she continue to make out with him and give him mixed signals?   I'm not entirely sure you understand what mixed signals are, to be honest, or how they (don't) relate to this case. It seems pretty cut and clear, from what the OP said at least. They were making out - fine. They were both active and willing (supposedly) participants in it. Let's suppose they were both getting handsy with each other over their clothing, as often happens when making out progresses - fine again. Still nothing wrong, as long as both the OP and his GF were willingly participating. Let's say the OP takes this as a sign to try to take things to the next step - fine again, still, as up to this point he had no reason to think she may not be up for it. The OP slips his hands inside of his GF's pants, and she says no. Because he doesn't know from previous experiences (supposedly, supposedly - giving him the benefit of the doubt here) that this is where her boundary is, trying once doesn't make him guilty of rape or sexual assault (though it would have been nice if he asked before trying in any case).   But he tries again, multiple times, by his own admission not ""know[ing] how to take no for an answer."" This is where it stops being fine. He should have taken her no (whether or not the making out continued - as above, that was an action she agreed to and wanted to participate in) at face value. If he really wanted to, he could have asked her after the first time if she was sure, and not have continued after she again said no to continuing. Ignoring her ""no""s when trying again (especially after stopping for ""a few minutes"" between tries, which is why your personal anecdote doesn't relate as well as you think it does) pushes this over the line into sexual assault, and his GF has every right to feel violated.  It's entirely possible to be into one activity and draw the line at another, which is something you seem to have trouble understanding (and yes, I've read all of your responses in this thread). You seem to think it's an all or nothing sort of thing - she was making out with him, so obviously it was ""mixed signals"" (even though she said no repeatedly) about going further, since to you (and perhaps to the OP, perhaps not) making out = apparently giving consent/showing willingness for more. Her willingness for making out only signalled her consent for making out, nothing else. Why would she continue making out? I don't know - maybe because she wanted to, or because she expected her boyfriend to respect her boundaries eventually, or because (as another poster said, and I agree with) she may not know how to turn him away. But you're so fixated on using her actions as a way to prove the OP is in the clear, and that isn't the point of the OP's situation. His point is that he did something that constitutes sexual assault, clearly through his own admittance; thus, the ""making out"" argument you're trying to present in support of him is disingenuous at best.  Is the OP a rapist? Legally, I don't know. The definition of rape usually includes some form of penetration, and varies a lot from place to place. Since his post didn't go into too many details about what happened, and we only have his side of things to know whether or not penetration took place (which he says didn't happen), probably not (or at least, not yet). In any case, by his report he is guilty of sexual assault, since he repeatedly touched his GF inappropriately when she told him no.   Edit: Wording and adding content"

What was confusing about the situation is that OP seemed to have more than on opportunity to touch his gf's vagina. With me so far? Which means it seems said gf continued to make out with OP despite being bothered by his behaviour. I don't know what your definition of clear communication and solid boundaries are, but that's not mine.   But apparently not only is the EVIL WOMAN lying in this case, but the POOR OPPRESSED MAN is as well, all in the name of ruining HIS poor, innocent, life in which he has no physical control over his own hands and where they wander.

I mean, maybe the OP lied to try to make himself look worse for some reason, but that seems pretty unlikely to me.  If you do believe all of those things, then why are you trying to write this off as ""bad judgment"" and ""slow reaction time""?  Is it your impression that men are out raping women left and right because of slow reflexes, or maybe because they're literally no more in control of themselves than wild animals are?  If all men were truly like that, I would never hire another man to work for me the rest of my life."

Having an unpopular (and terrible) opinion doesn't mean it's not an open debate. Your views don't need to be catered to.

Because everybody already supports those people vehemently. We live in probably the most anti-rape culture in history, yet many are convinced of almost the opposite.   Saying ""I love rape"" is not the only way to undermine victims; explaining that they weren't really raped has the same insidious effects, and I don't think I've ever seen a rape discussion on Reddit that didn't have somebody who felt the need to counter-balance all the support the victim received.  ""Rape Culture"" isn't about people who overtly, actively support rape and rapists; it's about the fact that the way our culture recognizes and addresses rape is so broken.

It is a very sensitive subject, and I agree - blaming and dismissing the victim is horrible. On the other, I don't want to be called a rape apologist for asking: Guys, is it possible that we need to think about what rape actually is, and if the current concept of rape in our culture is making more people feel like rapists and victims of Earth-shattering traumas than is necessary?   Hell, I'll be really open right now. I was once with a girl (when I was quite a few years older than OP no less), and was inexperienced and desperate and drunk and was making out with her. We went through first and second base, and around third base she pulled the brakes. But it wasn't until she said stop twice that I stopped. About two years later the emotions from that night boiled up and I felt like a molestor. If I had told someone and they would have said, dude you're a fucking rapist - that would have been, well, traumatizing for me - which doesn't seem to matter, naturally. At this point many people will already have locked in their minds a certain type of person they imagine me being. To many I probably sound despicable, narcissistic, and unapologetic for mentioning that I was confused that night, can also get hurt, and believe that my feelings also matter - as if someone can't somehow care about their feelings AND those of another person. I already felt like a creep and very guilty about it, but I was lucky enough to have someone (a woman - German, fwiw) tell me that at my age it's normal to make mistakes - and didn't make me feel ashamed of it. What that did is allow me to process it, instead of living in a perpetually neurotic state battling in my head whether I was actually a rapist or not and never move forward. It allowed me to step forward objectively see how a woman may be affected by what happened. But it seems much less important to help men become more empathic than it is to pigeonhole and shame them. So if you feel like empathizing or, if you choose, confronting a ""perpetrator"" here's your chance.   ""Rape Culture"" isn't about people who overtly, actively support rape and rapists; it's about the fact that the way our culture recognizes and addresses rape is so broken.   Then I would argue it shouldn't be called rape culture. I am all for progress, just the right kind. People have to have a solid sociological axiom - I am against Reddit's taking a very black and white view, ganging up against people and silencing them. Sex is a subject where Redditors seem to resort to group-think.   BTW, I did go back and read the article you posted (I admit I didn't click on it the first time b/c the link name made me think it would be irrelevant).  I'll just say that I'm glad I've been out of the dating scene for 10+ years. Yikes at all that angst! :/   Thanks. But don't forget, we still (well me not anymore really since I'm in Germany) live in that culture."

Good guy was smart, listened to r/legaladvice, retained an attorney and refused to allow it.  A-hole landlocked himself, and we have been waiting months to hear back from good guy, and we all hold out hope that we will hear back from him, since he was really good about updating.  We're all assuming he's listening to his lawyer and not saying a word until it's resolved.

bestoflegaladvice,3brkuz,Potatoe_away,2,Tue Jul 7 03:24:30 2015 UTC,"Huh.  I had the complete opposite experience; in my opinion it was very beneficial.  Of course there were a couple of busts for stupid assholes trying to have sex in the boiler room while on firewatch, but for the most part, it really helped build teamwork (again, imho).  In fact, we could always tell---even years later---which of the guys had gone through an integrated company.    Our field med schools (a Marine-run school for Navy corpsmen to learn about the Marines and some trauma medicine) were also integrated (except for barracks).  I always thought that was good, too.  The guys got to see that we were held to the same standards.  We crawled through the same mud, carried the same ALICE packs with the same weight, went on the same humps, and carried the same sandbag 'patients' through the chest-high swamp and the obstacle courses.  The one thing that was really bad about that, though---due to lack of female billets with the Marines, most of the females who failed out of training just went back to their normal command with no repercussions.  The men, however, almost always had billets waiting for them greenside, and so were recycled until they passed.  That caused unnecessary tension, especially among the guys who weren't there voluntarily and really didn't want to go greenside anyway.  I was one of those who fought for several years to get a billet at the school (limited for females), and worked my ass off to graduate 2nd of almost 250.   Either way, I think it's better to start off as you mean to go on.  If you're going to be serving with the opposite sex, you may as well begin with training."
bestoflegaladvice,3brkuz,thisisradioclash,-7,Tue Jul 7 04:24:43 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it is a slightly more common usage in the UK to call someone ""a female""-- but then again, it's not super-common and usually used only in certain contexts where Americans would use the adjective ""female"" to distinguish sexes/genders.

Considering he gives no timeframe for the initial contact, it's difficult to believe he just happened to start talking to this girl who was no longer in school with his brother via Facebook despite having a girlfriend of his own. Additionally, she still lived close by enough to be a potential ""date"" to his MMA weigh-in, which makes it even less likely that all of that initial contact was after she went to college.  Also, he had only said she was in college a few minutes before it was posted here (check the bot's archived timestamp) so it's probable that /u/akestral didn't see that update before posting."

And you, as a fully grown adult with the ability to determine right and wrong, and carefully think about the consequences of actions, decide to fall for the cries of an obviously emotionally disturbed child?   Let's take a trip down some of your options.   A 13 year old girl messages you and begs you to fuck her, you can A) Call the police and inform them that a child is begging stange adults online for sex. B) Attempt to contact this childs parents to inform them of their childs sexual advances. C) Delete and block the child from contacting you because you have no interest in sex with a child. Or D) By some condoms and decide to pity fuck this desperate child....   You're weak. You're a terrible human being, the absolute worst. As a full grown adult, you should have know outright to ignore the pleas of a child wanting to have sex with you. But you chose to keep talking to this child, you chose to continue listening to her plea because deep inside your fucked up brain you wanted to do it. Who gives a fuck if they were pressuring you, be a fucking adult. What kind of adult falls for the peer pressure of a 13 year old girl. You are not an adult, you are sick little man child who can't even say no to a 13 year old girl trying to make advances on you. They didn't entrap you, they didn't force you to stay in that conversation. You kept coming back for it. Because deep down you know you wanted to fuck that little girl, and that makes you a sick fucked up piece of shit.   Don't try to get pity out of people because you were wronged. No you didn't technically break any crimes, but you wanted to. You showed up to the house. No one forced you to get in your car. Don't try to tell me that you felt bad for this 13 year old girl and that you just wanted to make her feel better. Don't tell me that you just wanted her begging to stop so you folded under the pressure, because if you really wanted it to stop you could have just blocked her from contacting you. YOU made the choices that led to your arrest, YOU chose to go to this house with intentions of having a physical relationship with this child. YOU did this to YOURSELF. NBC isn't responsible for your inability to press the block button on your computer. I don't believe for a second that you said No to this child. Not one fucking second, because you kept replying.   Fuck you dude. Fuck you and your shitty attempt to get empathy from rational adults. Because you aren't a rational adult. You're the lowest form of human filth on the planet, because not only did you attempt to fuck a 13 year old girl, but you can't even admit that it was your fault. You can't even put the credit where it falls, you can't even admit that you have a problem and that problem got you in jail. And you continue to blame someone else for your sick fucked up issues.   Fuck you.   EDIT: Well look what I found. So you refer to this girl as sweetheart. You ask her for a kiss after showing up to the house. You sent her pictures of your dick. And yet the entire time you were saying ""no, I don't want to have sex with her."" You're never going to be forgiven for being a child rapist. No one is ever going to forget about how shitty of a person you are. So you can either deal with and accept your a dirty fuck up, or kill yourself to escape it. Balls in your court shit head."

Usually over the course of months or years after the first time they'd refused.  My suspicion is that the court would find it unreasonable to suggest that someone must cut off all contact with their ""friend"" at the suggestion of illegal activity. In Sorrells v United States, for example, there is no suggestion that Sorrels should have immediately terminated the conversation and kicked the agent out of his home at the first (or second or third) request to buy illegal alcohol. Likewise, Sherman took place over multiple months.   I know of no cases specifically about the internet, but I can't see why they would be any different here. If someone unambiguously rebuffed any suggestion of an illegal liaison at the start, and only wore down because the person at the other end kept persuading them otherwise, then that seems pretty clearly entrapment. (assuming the other person was working for or with law enforcement)."

It would have to be conduct so coercive a person of ordinary temperament would be compelled to act.  For example, ""please!"" isn't that. ""Come over or I will kill your mother, who lives at 123 Home Road, Cityville, Statessippi"" sounds more coercive."
bestoflegaladvice,3bp3nk,ccmulligan,2,Wed Jul 1 13:04:49 2015 UTC,Does Maine specifically require coercion? Because federal entrapment does not.
bestoflegaladvice,3bp3nk,ricree,2,Wed Jul 1 15:29:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know about Maine (I'm licensed in Texas, state and federal, and the Fifth Circuit), and while the federal defense does not use the word ""coercion,"" it does use ""induce"" which in this regard has more or less the same meaning -- the will to commit the offense cannot originate with the actor, but rather must come from the entrapper."
bestoflegaladvice,3bp3nk,ccmulligan,3,Wed Jul 1 15:56:18 2015 UTC,"""the will to commit the offense cannot originate with the actor, but rather must come from the entrapper""  That part I'm not arguing with. But most of the cases I'm familiar with (and again, all are at the federal level), mere persuasion was enough so long as the defendant was steadfastly opposed to committing the crime at the start. There was no need for any ""or else""."
bestoflegaladvice,3bp3nk,ricree,2,Wed Jul 1 16:00:51 2015 UTC,"Oh sure, that was just an example I gave. I didn't mean it to be a necessary feature of the defense."

Or Jacobson, where the agents spent several years trying to get him to break the law before he eventually did."
bestoflegaladvice,3bp3nk,ricree,3,Wed Jul 1 16:08:01 2015 UTC,"Lawyer, generally accepted legal standard for entrapment (though its going to vary slightly across federal/states law):  ""It is an affirmative defense that the actor committed the offense because he was induced or encouraged to do so by a law enforcement official or by a person acting in cooperation with a law enforcement official, for the purpose of obtaining evidence against him and when the methods used to obtain such evidence were such as to create a substantial risk that the offense would be committed by a person not otherwise disposed to commit it.""  State v. Campbell, 265 A.2d 11, 14 (N.H. 1970)  Basically, as you can read, its sort of a gray area of whether you would have committed it but for the officers. In practice, officers are going to have to go to pretty large extremes for entrapment to be found. One good example: officers offer you a million dollars to obtain a small amount of narcotics for em. Yea...  that's entrapment, 98% of the population would've gone at it.   Vast majority of the population wouldn't of gone to meet up with a 13 year old girl if she offered sex.

""because he was induced or encouraged to do so by a law enforcement official""  This is what I meant when I said that ""badgering"" might be entrapment. Someone who was unwilling to have sex initially, but was swayed by the repeated, persistent suggestions of the other person might well be entrapment.

Listen, dude: the best way to be able to move on with your life is to convince people that you don't pose any risk whatsoever of reoffending. Until you do that, people will continue to hound you, because they suspect that you will try to seduce minors again and they don't want that to happen. Everything you do to try to make this go away is just convincing people that you pose a real, continuous danger-- so you have to change that perception, if you want to make any real progress. Your tactics thus far have not worked; so try something different.  What's the best way to convince people you won't reoffend? Become the sort of person who actually won't. That means that you absolutely MUST admit that what you did was wrong-- stop blaming people for entrapping you, when YOU were the one who sought out the encounter and YOU went to a sting fully expecting to have sex with a 13-year-old. Go to counseling, and commit to it, and really try to get better-- and also work really hard on learning to take personal responsibility for your actions. You're an adult. You make your own choices. Recognize that, own that, and then you can ACTUALLY move forward."

Now listen to me...  Your life will not get better until you accept what you have done. Until you stop trying to obfuscate and skew the truth. Until you stop making excuses, and until you stop blaming the 13 year old girl you were trying to rape.   If you truly want to improve your life and repair old relationships as well as get a handle on your anxiety, forget the lie you have told yourself. This is your new mantra:  What I did was wrong. I was punished for my wrongdoing. The punishment was just for the wrongdoing I committed. I don't have to be that person anymore. I can change. I can improve. I will never make those mistakes again. I will never be that person again.  Adopt this mantra. Wear it as your armor. Say it first when you wake up and last when you go to sleep.

The first thing you did was ask a bloody thirteen year old about her romantic life, and pressed for details on who she kissed and where. It was obvious from there what your intent was. What kind of adult stranger asks that of a child?  You then proceeded to ""protect"" her from other potential predators by telling her not to talk to anyone else about the things that you then went on to talk to her about. Were you trying to keep other paedophiles from going after your prey, or were you trying to isolate her online so that it would be quicker and easier to groom her?  The fact that you were so quick to get naked on camera for a supposed child, combined with the fact that you openly asked her to delete her archives, just shows that you knew exactly what you were doing and that what you were doing was wrong. Considering that you thought she was a child, you were particularly manipulative in your conversations with her, and now you're here trying to manipulate the truth.  You are a vile human being. Parents deserve to know who you are so that they can protect their children from you"

bestoflegaladvice,3bp3nk,MundiMori,6,Wed Jul 1 02:18:01 2015 UTC,"I didn't actually look to see what his plea was, but there's something called an ""Alford plea.""  It basically means you admit to the judge that ""yeah, there's definitely enough evidence to convict me, so we can skip the trial and go to sentencing, but I didn't do it!""  It's admitting the sufficiency of guilt while still protesting your innocence."
bestoflegaladvice,3bp3nk,objection_403,6,Wed Jul 1 02:26:18 2015 UTC,"He plead guilty.  He is saying in his appeal that he did not know what he was pleading to and, first, that his attorney did not explore the options with him. Then later he said that he brought up entrapment, his attorney said it didn't apply and that was reason for ineffective assistance of counsel.  I get it, IAC is something everybody serving time in jail tries - because they have a whole lot of time to read books about law without a basic understanding of how to read laws or check with cases to make sure they're even still good. And that's their right. Also, they have nothing better to do.   That being said the bar for IAC is pretty high. It's not enough to say that your lawyer is an idiot, you also have to say that the case would have turned out completely different if your attorney had been an idiot. Maybe his public defender was an idiot - but if he was, it was because he didn't cover his ass. If his client is that adamant that this was entrapment, let him have his trial. It's a loser, everyone knows it's a loser because this isn't even close to entrapment, but ultimately, you do have to defer to your client's wishes. The best you can do is try to talk them out of it. And sometimes, it's just not going to work.  Plus, maybe this guy could have gotten even more time if he'd forced a trial."
bestoflegaladvice,3bp3nk,shrewgoddess,2,Wed Jul 1 02:34:08 2015 UTC,"Right.  There are both prongs for IAC: performance and prejudice.  He basically admitted to committing the crime and is depending on an affirmative defense that legally does not apply.  He can't show he was prejudiced- he actually benefited from not taking it to trial.  Saying entrapment doesn't apply isn't IAC because it's, well, correct."

A nolo contendere plea is when a person also agrees as to the sufficiency of evidence, but they make no claim as to their guilt or innocence.  So they're saying, sure, you can convict me... I'm not saying whether I actually did it or not.  An Alford plea, meanwhile, affirmatively states your innocence along with the sufficiency of evidence."

Consulates handle services for nationals abroad. The embassy is there for inter-government stuff.  It gets confusing because consular services are generally offered at the embassy building.

In the first case, dual citizenship, the US is super picky about when it's allowed and usually requires renouncing the non-US country before being considered naturalized. With the second situation, if her parents renounced her US citizenship on her behalf as a child, she can reclaim her US citizenship if she does so before turning 18. I want to say there's a specific cut off, like six or nine months prior to her birthday, but it's been some time since I've read anything about it."

He became a Canadian as well in 2000 and was able to retain his U.S. citizenship, though I don't know if there were any stipulations put on him.

bestoflegaladvice,3blacl,Magdalena42,5,Tue Jun 30 16:29:37 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to figure out the answer to this question generally, because a TV show I really enjoy (won't name it in case of spoilers) has a plot line about a woman who was raped while trying to conceive a child with her husband and found out she was pregnant shortly after the rape.  Now I want to know the answer for CT as well.    I'm a law student, not a lawyer, but based on my understanding of how paternity works from family law, wouldn't a man who raised a child and held it out as his own be the father as far as any court is concerned, regardless of whatever results came from a paternity test?    Also, what are the chances that a forcible rapist could actually get custody of a child?  I don't want to ask in there, because (1) I'm asking more out of general curiosity and (2) I don't want to upset OP further, he seems like a nice dude.  Anyone have any idea how something like this plays out in real life?"
bestoflegaladvice,3blacl,Suppafly,7,Tue Jun 30 15:23:59 2015 UTC,"Generally if the husband doesn't deny it when the child is born and they are married, he's considered the father forever. Which is what the OP basically said the judge told him. Some states even prohibit a third party from trying to question the paternity of a child that was born to a married couple. Now that they are divorced, apparently that doesn't apply anymore, but still I'm not sure the rapist will get what he wants.   In the show you're talking about, I think the ex-wife was just using that as a threat to hurt him, not because it would make a legal difference. Either that or they are pretending that the law works differently than it usually does."
bestoflegaladvice,3blacl,LeaneGenova,4,Tue Jun 30 20:43:30 2015 UTC,"My state has a revocation of paternity act, which allows an alleged/presumed father or the biological father to change paternity to the biological father. It can also come up in a divorce, where paternity can be brought up. After that, there's pretty much no chance to challenge it.   Unfortunately, the law is pretty new (3 years) so we're still making it up as we go."

Nobody believes that HAES actually means that being fat gives you magical health powers, but there is a certain amount of delusion required to believe that body fat % and medical complications are not heavily related. That's not to say that every thin person is healthy, because that's an equally silly assertion, but if you take an average of people at one medically obese ""size"" and compare it to another, medically normal ""size"", the health of those populations will be dramatically different from each other.  If you disagree with that heavily supported assertion, then you have a tenuous grasp of reality."

bestoflegaladvice,3bk6ve,welderblyad,-15,Tue Jun 30 19:07:43 2015 UTC,"And some of us were fat at some point and decided to get healthy only to be talked down to by other fatties when our goals started looking like they were within reach. When I started my journey to become fit, there was a lot of ass patting and whatnot. When I started swimming in my clothes and had to go buy new ones because everything was falling off of me (I was still medically overweight at the time) they tried to make every excuse possible to get me to eat. I was eating healthy. I was never hungry. I was expending about 3000 Calories a day and only eating around 2000. I made sure what I ate was healthy the great majority of the time with the proper balance of nutrients (sometimes I ate crappy fast food because sometimes I like crappy fast food....sometimes I ate cookies because I like cookies). I was (and still am) very happy with my progress, but that wasn't good enough for them. They made fun of me, called me names, and generally acted like asses. They resented the amount of time I spent running (half an hour, 3-4 days per week). I cut them out of my life once I started seeing their crab bucket mentality for what it was. When I finally got down to a healthy weight, I started sculpting and kept losing a few extra pounds. At 5'11"" and 170-175lbs, I was not (and am not) the skinniest kid in the class by any means. My abs aren't washboard, but you can see they exist. My ribs aren't visible. My arms aren't skinny or flabby, but aren't body builder arms either. I'm what would have, at one time, considered 'normal sized' and slightly on the fit side.  I needed a place to vent about people like this because it bothered me to think that anyone would deliberately go out of their way to sabotage someone like that. I knew people like this personally. When I found FPH, I found a group of people who told stories and shared experiences exactly like those I had been through. I found a broader group of people who were tired of the entitlement (things like taking up a seat and a half at a baseball game and not understanding why the person next to them didn't want fat creeping over the armrest onto the person sitting next to them).   Yeah, there were the people with eating disorders. Not a huge number, but truthfully those people aren't any healthier than fat people. The difference is that I've never had to sit next to a smelly, sweating anorexic person on an airplane.  Yeah, there were the people who had dead/dying/disgusting relatives that they didn't understand who always tried to force the unhealthy, gross lifestyle on them.   Most, in my experience, were just fed up with having to accommodate entitled fat people not pulling their weight (haha, that was unintentionally funny) or were like me and just tired of people trying to drag them down. So we vented. And we enjoyed it. And it was a lot of fun. It's still a lot of fun elsewhere.  Do I hate fat people? Yeah, unabashedly. I used to think some were different. All I found was different levels of the crab bucket mentality and differing levels of entitlement. I recognize that they're not all crazy tumblrinas with weird hair and hipster glasses. I don't care, because it's nice to be able to bitch about them. If I did it anywhere else, my business would suffer. My personal life would suffer. My family life would suffer. It was nice to have a place to just let it all out. Most of us recognized the hyperbole for what it was, a way to get those feelings out.  I've recently made the decision to stop smoking as well. I've stopped before and ended up smoking again, but I'm sure this time it will stick. You know what happened every time I've stopped in the past? Smokers rejoiced for me. None of them tried giving me a cigarette. Hell, none of them would let me have a cigarette once I had pronounced I was quitting. I'll never hate smokers unless the community seriously changes. I already hate the habit, and I hate the smell, but if someone doesn't want to smoke the community of smokers doesn't try to drag them back in. You won't find me in /r/smokerhate (or whatever the popular place to hate smokers happens to be). There's no crabs in a bucket or ""I deserve to have an extra seat for my pack of smokes"" in the smoking community that I know. There are probably a few out there, but they don't make up the vast majority.  Edit (possibly a stealth edit): Damn, I didn't mean for this to ramble on so much. Sorry about that. TL;DR: The majority weren't the way you're describing, at least in my experience, although some of the community was."

bestoflegaladvice,3bk6ve,mizmoose,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:27:22 2015 UTC,"From your link:  Is There Evidence Associating Obesity with Cognitive Impairment?  This study that did cognitive testing on Framingham subjects  found adverse effects of obesity on cognitive performance for men only.  In this study  “Midlife measures of central obesity (WHR in the uppermost quartile- Q4) and of hypertension (BP > or = 140 / > or = 90 or use of anti-hypertensive medication) were each significantly related to poorer performance on executive function & visuomotor skills. Neither HTN nor obesity was individually or synergistically related to verbal memory (immediate or delayed recall).” This does not fit the pattern of deficits in Alzheimer’s disease.  Another study found that obese adolescents had evidence of attention deficits and executive dysfunction. Again a different pattern, which might be either cause or result.  Another study found that abdominal fat in late life appears to confer an increased risk for dementia/CIND [cognitive impairment not demented], whereas overall obesity appears to be protective.  Another study found cognitive deficits in older but not younger obese subjects. It commented that these changes might be attributable to comorbid conditions such as congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, or metabolic lipid abnormalities.  This study found that elevated BMI is not associated with cognitive function in healthy children and adolescents."

bestoflegaladvice,3bk6ve,atomicthumbs,-6,Tue Jun 30 14:01:02 2015 UTC,"This has been thrown around a lot on SRD and everyone has their pet theories.  Mine is that it's more like a cult.   I don't know if you're old enough to remember the Moonies and the cult activities and panics of the 70s in the US (or if you've read about it), but the whole thing reminds me of cults.  At the core are the leaders.  In FPH's case those are mostly the mods (of which there were something like 30, iirc).  These are the people who spout the catch phrases and encourage their repetition. They make sure to broadly punish [ie. ban] dissenters and anyone who says anything that might even imply dissent.  Plus they do the punishing in a public way to both show what happens when you break the rules (ex. commenting on the ban-worthy comment with things like: ""Banned for breaking rule #: No fatty sympathizing."") and to stir up the hatred with a slice of offense (""How dare they show up here?"").  The majority is the cult members.  They are mostly young and still struggling to find their way in life.  [There's a reason why, in the 1970s, cults did most of their recruiting on college campuses.]  They're used to a system of rewards and punishments and on FPH (or its current clones) they can find that easily.  Say the correct things and get piles of upvotes and ""karma,"" along with hundreds of people agreeing with you.  Say the wrong things and be publicly shamed and punished (banned).    The difference is that cult members, usually, eventually shake themselves out of it and wander off to find other things, like a life.  The core leaders, however, actually believe this crap and keep spouting their bile.    There's a reason why the original FPH had something like 150k members but the newer clones only attract a few thousand or so.  When things fragmented a lot of the cult members probably spent a day or so yelling and screaming, then eventually realized they could find better things to do with their lives than sit on a computer 30 hours a day bitching about fat people.   The cults never really die.  Moonies still exist. But it's been years since you've heard the word ""deprogrammer."""

bestoflegaladvice,3bk6ve,DarthRiko,-1,Tue Jun 30 14:52:34 2015 UTC,"I knew someone was going to say this. :)  It's true to some degree, but not to the extent that FPH (and, admittedly, a few others) take it.  There are few places on reddit where a single comment can get you either banned or an almost instant 300+ comment karma, and there's almost nothing in between.  In FPH-land there is no discussion.  Ever.  If you post a picture of some fat guy working out at the gym, every single comment had better be about how gross this is.  Should anyone dare comment that - hey, the guy is working on his health - BANNED.  Even in places like legaladvice you can voice something related but different if you're not a complete jerk or victim-blamer about it.  When someone asks, ""Can I sue my neighbor for this?""  nobody (but the commenter trolls) will downvote people saying, ""Look, this isn't  legal advice, but have you tried talking to the neighbor first?"" and the mods aren't going to swoop in and say, ""LEGAL ADVICE ONLY! BANNED!"""
bestoflegaladvice,3bk6ve,mizmoose,8,Tue Jun 30 17:14:57 2015 UTC,"FPH is very clear about it, though. It's in the sidebar that, if you are fat or try to support fat people, you will get banned.  The point of FPH isn't to support weight loss or make the world a better place, even though some FPHers like to look at it that way. The point is to have a ""safe space"" to mock people that they can't in other ""safe spaces."" It's not for discussion; it's just a place to vent freely. That kind of opinion and mocking would get them kicked out of other communities, so they have their own community to get it out of their systems. It's solely meant to be cathartic."

So if you try to put a SIM card in from a network that the phone didn't come from, it will not work. I.e. You signed a 2 year contract with AT&T and got an iPhone for $199. That iPhone is locked to AT&T and will not work on any other carrier.  Also, there are variations of the iPhone for different networks (CDMA, GSM, different LTE bands, etc.)  To me, this sounds like the person who originally sold him the phone probably stole it (or found it), and it has since been ""blacklisted"" since someone reported it lost/stolen. That means the phone will not work on ANY network in the United States (as far as I know)."

There is one other model with a few different frequencies for use elsewhere in the world.) Whether it's T-Mobile, AT&T, Sprint, or Verizon, it's the exact same phone. It's packaged at the factory with the appropriate SIM, and may be SIM locked, depending on the company and how you buy it.  Verizon iPhones are never sold SIM locked, by the way."
bestoflegaladvice,3b5ct9,Angadar,80,Fri Jun 26 02:37:22 2015 UTC,Looking at this 2 year old post made me realize how the main sub has gotten so much more caustic/schadenfreude-heavy over these years.  People are poking fun at the amateur phiosopher/special snowflake but no one is being as over the top as it is these days.  I mean the way it turned out to be makes for fun for the regulars who choose to blow off steam and better entertainment for me but I tend to think that the way it used to be was better for actual legal advice.
bestoflegaladvice,3b5ct9,polymute,17,Fri Jun 26 04:34:45 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. There should be more advice to go along with the judgemental shit, and maybe even less judgemental shit.

I do get really annoyed with the other non lawyers who try to give advice based on TV shows they've seen. But I'll be honest, there's occasionally a thread that's been linked to from /r/bestoflegaladvice where I can totally understand the OP asking that question because they're unsure of the situation but then they've been ripped into and insulted for not knowing the specific laws.   I'd say a good 95% of the posts here are from idiot OPs who argue over stupid things but there's still the occasional one that gets attacked for just wanting clarification."

User: ""Get a lawyer OP I don't know why you bothered coming here"" OP: ""I just wanted to make sure I wasn't wasting my money, thank you"" User: ""WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE OP I TOLD YOU TO GET A LAWYER!!!!1""    That's what the responses seem like sometimes."

When you're first starting out, you pretty much have to take everyone, because you need the money and you need the reputation. Generally, that means you have a lot of clients you want to fire. As time goes on, though, it won't be important for you to keep every client. So, when someone threatens to fire you, you'll be able to just say, ""Ok."" then let them go.  It's a great feeling, being able to fire clients.  I imagine that it's not an open blacklist. Attorneys just seem to have conflicts of interest when it comes to her.

Just take a look at any number of Supreme Court of Canada cases applying the Charter (anything after about 1985 and forward).  The SCC makes decent decisions on a large number of contentious social and criminal issues."

The resulting case law from Charter also had some interntional influence (I recall seeing Justice Wilson's dissents cited outside of Canada quite a few times when I was researching her).  I'd say Canada has the most developed Aboriginal law, although it hasn't had as mucb influence, due to political differences in how various countries treat Aboriginals.  We're also somewhat influential in Children's law -- in the past 15 years we went from having the highest rate of incarceration for children in the Westernized world to the one of the lowest, due to a massive shift in the way we approach youth criminal justice (and the general trend of crime rates going down).

There's an appalling number of stories about women (usually on the heavy side) who had no idea they were pregnant until they went into labor (though obviously this is very far from being the norm).   And a personal(ish) anecdote - about a year and a half ago my previous company was going through a rather nasty split with one of their major, major clients (without going into too much detail, the client had enough of my boss, and decided to hire one of my coworkers and me directly). My coworker was a couple of months pregnant at the time, and the official split wasn't due to happen until she'd be about 5-6 months along. As you can imagine, the atmosphere in the previous company was... mmm, how do I say this politely?... toxic, and she didn't want the higher-ups to know she was pregnant. Why? I don't know why. She told the client, of course, so it's not like the previous boss could have ratted her out. But - pregnancy does weird things to your brain, as I can attest to first-hand. So she successfully hid her pregnancy up until like the 5th or 6th month. She's really petite, too, but it's amazing how much you can hide with loose-fitting clothes, bulky sweaters, and strategically-held purses.  We still keep up with a few of the people from the old office, and as far as we know the higher-ups never did find out."

Both used strategic layering, billowy shirts, and one of them would do things like wear one of those puffy vests with a scarf over it (it was winter when she quit). None of us had a clue about the pregnancies. Both of them did it because the environment at work sucked and they didn't want the Big Boss saying ""Oh they left because they were pregnant"", when the real reason was ""they left because Big Boss is a tyrant who belittles everyone and believes women don't belong in the workplace""."

To keep it vague a family member of mine was involved in an arson (of their own home, no one was harmed) and the police asked me if I knew how the person did it and I told them I didn't know but I did know the family member had a gas can for the lawn mower. In the police report that turned into ""Cbebop21 stated that family member went to the shed, retrieved the gas can used for the lawn mower, then went back into the residence and set the fire in x room"" at the time I didn't even know how bad the fire had been, let alone know where the fuck it started.

I can remember the moment I started looking at the police differently.

We wrote to someone higher up just asking to confirm the position regarding this visit and what they'd said and my understanding is everyone backed down very quickly and they never came around again.

Before I transitioned, I had (a) a family doctor who told my mom that I was sinning against God, (b) a pediatrician (I was 17) who cried when told that I was trans, (c) a psychiatrist who tried to berate me into doing a course of gay conversion therapy, (d) a psychiatrist who told my mom not to help me in any way so she could preserve her marriage to my bigoted dad, and (e) various other professionals who, though kind and well-meaning, had exactly zero training in trans issues. I live in NYC and there are only two (very busy and booked-up) clinics that specifically deal with trans issues.  In short, I've been transitioned for close to a decade and have had competent medical care for a total of maybe six months. And I'm mentally and physically healthy! Imagine if I needed, say, psych treatment or HIV care. (I don't actually have to imagine it. I'm a social worker and my gay/trans clients get treated like shit.)"

bestoflegaladvice,3av4gj,Gold_Hodler,16,Tue Jun 23 23:21:24 2015 UTC,"In the original thread, I mentioned a friend of mine who is trans. She is a doctor (not exactly the kind of doctor we're talking about here, but an actual doctor with patients all the same), and when she was first transitioning but not out at work, she was discovered at work and the manager started putting pictures of monkeys in dresses on all of her things. After that, she was fired for a truly bullshit reason, and ended up winning a large settlement in a civil suit against them.  I just feel the need to mention what has happened since then. She was really worried about finding a job as her actual self. She found one within a couple months. Her current practice is much larger and more successful, has a wonderful work environment, and puts up with less than zero bullshit with regards to intolerance towards her. The manager once stopped interviewing a potential job candidate mid interview because she kept giving side glances to her. Not only do they adore her, but she has a large and loyal patient base. She had dozens of patients follow her to her new practice, many of which drive more than 30 miles just to see her. She is one of the most sought after doctors in our area, and her patients absolutely love her.  Attitudes in some areas are beginning to change, though slowly. I see all of the messages and cards and notes that she gets thanking her for being so wonderful, and it gives me hope. And the acceptance in tangible form like that means the world to her."

Nicest guy you'll ever meet.   I went to court for him as a character witness twice. The first time was to get all of his rights reinstated. The judge was nice and gave him back everything but his gun rights. He said they'd revisit the issue in a year.

Emily got a summer job at a store and the boss's wife thought Emily and the boss were having an affair, or building up to one, and told her husband to fire Emily.   Emily was a little put off but moved on with her life.  Emily then went back to college and mid-semester her parents were visited by the police investigating a jewelry theft reported by the boss's wife and Emily had a warrant.  Fortunately Emily's parents were pretty well off and hired an attorney so Emily turned herself in and got bailed quickly so she could get back to college(which was also fortunately in-state).  In the end all the charges were dropped and Emily's paranoia of jealous SOs was very very high.  Anyway the backstory is that the paranoid wife had some jewelry go missing from a safe deposit box and automatically assumed it was Emily stealing it out of anger at the ending of the (nonexistent) affair.  She had the bank pull video and it showed a young brunette and based on that information the warrant was issued.  In the end Emily had no knowledge of any of this (until her arrest) and the jewelry turned up in the boss's wife's dresser, and the young woman from the video was just a regular customer."

There is a newly built road running between the shopping plaza (behind it) and the movie theater. A cop sits slightly down the road from the movie theater behind some bushes where he can hide and give tickets for people violating the pointless 25mph speedzone (there is no one at the movie theater during the morning rush hour) Up the road is the new developement on one side and a park on the other. What has started to happen is people speed down the road at 60 mph and then brake when they get near the movie theater so as to avoid the cop. There is very little speed enforcement around the actual populated area and plenty of it for an empty road running behind a shopping center. This is because there is no where for the cops to hide where the speeding actually matters. And of course this is because it has little to do with safety and everything to do with revenue"

Guy had tried to thwart his wife's attempts to pursue divorce by meeting with every divorce lawyer in his area, because he knew he'd heard that once they'd met with him, they couldn't meet with her. Predictably, she eventually found a lawyer (outside the area, presumably), and wanted to press charges not only for divorce but now also for trying to keep her from filing for divorce. His question was about what to do about that.  But along the way, he mentioned he was thinking of becoming a lawyer, and asked if his situation might frustrate that dream. When assured that it would, he asked if there was anything he could do to fix it. The answer, as I recall, was, ""You are going to need a locomotive and a well-timed lightning strike.""

bestoflegaladvice,3alsak,ofthrees,56,Sun Jun 21 22:32:37 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that Cherokee is definitely the most popular tribe for the dubiously mixed white girls.   Two major factors:  One: For much of the 19th into the 20th C., Cherokee were considered more respectable than other tribes, since they were ""more civilized"". This led to a lot of families with branches from other tribes in their family tree claiming to have Cherokee blood instead.  Two: When anyone without actual Indian descent felt they needed some, for whatever reason, the popular tribe for a fictional ancestor was Cherokee, for much the same reasons as above.  In both cases, you should be doubly suspicious of ""Cherokee princess"". Both because it again raises the apparent respectability of the Indian ancestor by giving them high social standing within the tribe, and because white man/other woman was considered less offensive in the society of the time than other man/white woman.  I suspect there are more of the former than the latter. In any event, I suspect that a claim to be a full quarter Cherokee is probably legitimate; that's a grandparent, and with the OP apparently being fairly young the grandparent in question is quite likely still alive and, even if not, it would be hard to fake in this day and age of record keeping."

bestoflegaladvice,3alsak,polymute,5,Sun Jun 21 23:17:41 2015 UTC,"I wonder if there are tribe membeship shenanigans going on - some tribes really limit their numbers by their share of Native blood, that is to say genetics.  Then again, just going from simple geography it makes sense that the Cherokees would intermarry more."
bestoflegaladvice,3alsak,Muspel,4,Sun Jun 21 23:19:24 2015 UTC,"Possibly.  It might also be a cultural thing. I know very little about either tribe, but it could be that Navajos tend to be more insular, and thus wouldn't intermarry as much (independent of any geographical reasons)."
bestoflegaladvice,3alsak,penniavaswen,2,Sun Jun 21 23:22:06 2015 UTC,"Navajo is pretty weird: if you can demonstrate that you have a mother and father from two registered clans (each), you are full blooded. Since the Navajo Nation is so close to Mexico and there has been enough recent intermarriage between Hispanics and Navajos, the Tribe Council just declared that all people south of the border were Mexican and gave them one clan with no distinction between political borders.  While I was learning Navajo, the insularness was pretty start too. There were words for each of the nearby states (AZ, CO, NM, UT, CA), Washington D.C., Mexico (aka everything south of the US-Mexico border, including all of South America), and the countries involved in WWII (Germany, Italy, ""England"", Russia for all of the USSR, Japan, China, France). The nationality literal translations were pretty fun too and very polandball-esque: Germans are angry loud people, Italians are people who talk funny, English are people who drink too much, Russians are people from the country in two lands (ie Europe and Asia), Japanese are slant-eyes, the French were smelly people etc. My teacher claimed there was a word for Canadians that was rooted in ""nice white people"" but I haven't been able to verify this otherwise and was probably even more tongue-in-cheek.  Any place else is clumped into ""over there somewhere"" (literal translation) and accompanied with a vague waving of the arm."
bestoflegaladvice,3alsak,penniavaswen,3,Mon Jun 22 02:45:49 2015 UTC,"A bit of a necro, but the short answer is yes. To be a certified, card-carrying Navajo (it's orange), you must demonstrate 1/4 Navajo blood.  I'm half and technically my (white) mother broke the law while she held my bald eagle feathers in trust until I came of age."

Also, I wish I had a dollar for every white person I heard claiming to be part Native American. I've noticed that Cherokee is definitely the most popular tribe for the dubiously mixed white girls. Is it a Cher thing?   It's because Cherokee were the most ""civilized"" and mixed blood, so it's the easiest to believe of someone who doesn't like Native American at all.  My ex-wife was 1/16 Native American (Cherokee) but her family was white, rich, etc.  When she applied to law school she checked off the Native American box.  For Georgetown (where she ended up going) she had to write one extra essay for being a minority.  I wrote it for her.  I basically said that ""while to everyone else I am the same as them, there is something different.  When I walk in the field I feel that I am a connection between the earth and the sky"" and BS like that.  When she arrived at Georgetown the native american law students association kept calling and calling her.  She kept avoiding them.  Finally one day she answered the door of her dorm and it was two people from the NALSA.  Anyway, they were just as white as she was."

Why would forcing the issue be helpful. I mean what are the people receiving this information supposed to do with it? Are they supposed to sit down and have a nice polite chat with there boss where everyone cries in the end and they come to the realization that they should have been besties all along?  This is the sort of middle school drama that belongs on niche TV and in class rooms. The fact of that matter is that when she left she made completely sure to do maximum damage on the way out, that might not be her vision or intent, but that's exactly what happened there. She ripped a giant hole in the social fabric of that office when she left. Events such as this are the entire reason that references are a thing.  There are hundreds of better ways to deal with this situation. The ones that comes to mind include 1) not saying anything and let business happen as usual, 2) having a nice conversation with the boss about her behavior, 3) talking things out and being supportive off the supervisees, or 4) taking this WHOLE THING to HR and let them sort it out before this whole thing degenerates into a hostile work environment, and that is literally off the top of my head.  OF COURSE, the boss is going to be pissed and warn other people that might find themselves in a similar situation some day. That's a given here. No, the law doesn't make you the grand arbiter of what other people must know about other people and what other people are allowed to know about you. There are no special protections for you and you alone. People can say whatever true things they want, even when you don't want them to."

It's acceptable as long as said boss can keep her professionalism, but in my experience office gossip does blow over at some point or another.  Of course, OP should have just shut the hell up and kept the secret, instead of trying to start a fire with this information. At best, disseminating the information helps no one in particular and sows distrust, and at worst it backfires horribly."

Mom couldn't get the state to take me, so she found a 'private' foster family. Really cool family actually, but I ran away because I felt like a bad person that didn't fit in with 'normal'. Spent my teens homeless, flop houses, living with older boyfriends. The whole time thinking that there was something wrong with me.   Now, we'll adjusted, happy succesful.

If I didn't have amazing friends I certainly would have spent some nights sleeping in my car in some random parking lot.    I still have some real self-esteem issues that I'm working through with a psychiatrist, but at least now I realize that none of that abuse was my fault. I hope this kid gets help too. There's no feeling like your own mother wanting to disown you.    As an aside, I always used to tell myself that I was a good kid. Quiet, straight As, self-sufficient.

I now understand that it's not.   Story time:   My stepfather made me pay rent since I was 14. My first summer after moving to a very hot desert, he made me push a shopping cart around selling soda to construction workers. I paid $40 a month to not be kicked out of my house. Why? Because it was ""time to start contributing."" He kept a detailed ledger, recording every dollar I ever paid him. If I was short, I heard about it. I paid an increasing amount of rent until the day I moved out, when I was 23 (yes, I was cowed into staying, I didn't know how to leave), paying about $300/mo at the time. He also made me pay more when a month had more than four weeks. I bet he still has the ledger.   He would constantly threaten to throw me out of the house. He would constantly punish me for minor perceived slights by taking away everything that made me comfortable in my house. Little things. He'd remove the lint trap from the dryer so I couldn't use it and had to hang my clothes outside (in the desert sun, where they'd feel like cardboard afterward). He'd take my little TV from my room and put it in his bedroom closet. He never let me watch what I wanted. Big things, too. He wouldn't let me use the air conditioning. (Ironically, I just bought him a brand new $3,500 air conditioner--well, my mom, but he gets the benefit.) He would use his intimidating size and booming voice to physically cow me. (He was only physically violent with me once, and I'll never forget it, but his intimidation tactics were far more harmful.)     He'd also constantly threaten my mother by telling her he was going to leave. He did, more than once. He was once gone for days and my mother was a wreck. He was horrible to my mother. My mother now cares for his every need as he is an old man and an invalid and would be dead without her. He is still pretty much an asshole.   It probably goes without saying, but he was no parent. He was my landlord. The house I lived in wasn't mine. ""This is my house and when you're under my roof you'll live by my rules!"" was a constant if clichéd refrain (never mind the rent I paid). We didn't relate to each other at all. He never tried to understand me. He saw something unique, and fragile, and intelligent, and he didn't know what to do with it, so he had to control it. The only way he knew how was to destroy it. I have a lot of issues, and I think a lot of them were directly caused by him. I see him a few times a year now, and I have never spoken my mind about any of this. I will next time.   There's so much more, but the point of this story is to say that I honestly didn't know that trying to kick your almost-grown kid out of your house was such an obviously bad thing to do, until I read this thread.

As it is, hunting clubs are already super strict about the amount of deer or whatever you can hunt on their land in order to keep the populations stable.

One benefit is that we already know how to farm, even the basics are fairly commonly known (but maybe that's because I'm in Ohio?).

Now he isn't a total angel, he does like to bark at other dogs but he's gotten much better about it (mostly big ones cause he has a little dog complex).  I dislike the reputation chihuahua's have but just like with pitbull's its the owners that usually are the reason why they have it.

Kinda neurotic in a needy way, but never bitey, only barks when he's desperately excited because he just loves you so much and you're home and omg that's the very best thing! (and also when the mail comes, because the one thing he loves more than he loves people in general, and almost as much as he loves Dad, is the mail).

bestoflegaladvice,3abv4q,mizmoose,5,Fri Jun 19 03:45:18 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not saying that at all.  It's a dog, not a robot.  You can train a dog as much as you can, but in the end the dog's personality (for lack of a better word) is still going to be the final determination of behavior.  German shepherds are well known to be extremely territorial and can be very aggressive when startled or if they feel threatened.   Sometimes all the training in the world cannot override that. It depends on the dog.   My mom grew up with a Samoyed. They are by nature almost always very sweet-tempered and friendly, and are known to be very good with kids. They're also, usually, very strong willed and no matter how much you train them, if they want to do something, they will DO IT.  My mom used to watch the broadcasts of the AKC dog shows because you'd see all these show dogs prancing around, and then they'd bring out the Samoyeds and half of them would get halfway through their routine and suddenly decide that they had something else to do.  The Samoyed she grew up with  was atypical and used to bite and terrorize everyone, except the person who fed him."

You're on the hook for so many things and even a single shitty tenant can make or break your profit margins. Plus tenants will fight you every single step of the way for everything. So much hassle
bestoflegaladvice,3abv4q,SuperSalsa,21,Thu Jun 18 21:40:58 2015 UTC,"Shit like this is what makes me cringe when I see ""oh, I can just rent the house out if I move""(usually in /r/personalfinance posts). At least the smart ones fob it off on a management company."
bestoflegaladvice,3abv4q,Cykuta,2,Thu Jun 18 23:30:54 2015 UTC,"Honest question from someone living on a different continent: is it really such a bad idea in the USA?  Where I live, people who have flats to rent are in a vastly superior position to those who don't, and basically no one ever said it didn't pay off. Sure, there are risks and costs, but in the end if they have shitty tenants, which rarely happens because people want to live somewhere, they just find someone else. Utilities are paid by the tenants (it's them using the water and electricity, duh) and in general renting out flats is as close to magic money falling from the sky as possible, as the renters themselves say. Cities with a large student population exist mostly on renting them living space."
bestoflegaladvice,3abv4q,cptal,7,Fri Jun 19 13:58:34 2015 UTC,"Cities with large student populations in the US at least have a reputation of having slumlords. Landowners who buy lots of property, charge out the wazoo for a year and don't bother to upkeep the property at all. In my city, people have died from living in dangerously non fire regulation apartments.   The big thing is that making a business out of it is possible. But someone renting out half their home to a family runs very thin profit margins and due to the cost/time of evicting a shitty tenant, it can end up costing money."
bestoflegaladvice,3abv4q,Cykuta,2,Fri Jun 19 14:40:55 2015 UTC,"Well, there are certainly places around here that are also sub-par, because people will rent almost anything in the center of some of the more historic places, but mostly people try to keep things up because they want to keep on renting it. From what I know there's not much property tycoons, mostly people who inherit flats from their grandmas and so on. There's been a few accidents due to dangerous conditions, but they're usually clubs and pubs, which are crammed into every non-living space in cities like that. Also, if someone wanted to buy lots of property in, say, Kraków, they would have to spend so much money they could probably also afford refurbishing and upkeep, which would also be a better business model anyway. Or just build a small city block elsewhere.  I wonder if this difference is due to our cities being older, with very limited space, so it actually pays off to look after it?"
bestoflegaladvice,3abv4q,cptal,6,Fri Jun 19 16:23:44 2015 UTC,"I think you answered the question where property is inherited and kept in family. And renting is more ""free money"" cause you're not paying a mortgage on the property.   In the US, due to buildings continuously being built and growth everywhere even in the hearts of cities and previously credit flying around, it's (was) easy to buy property for cheap and get a mortgage even with a shitty credit score. Which is what slumlords do. Joe Schmoe who buys a house for himself and rents half on the other hand, has a much much slimmer profit margin because he's still paying off the house."
bestoflegaladvice,3abv4q,Cykuta,2,Fri Jun 19 17:56:40 2015 UTC,"People do buy flats to rent out, but it usually is because they've already got the money elsewhere and are looking for a sensible investment. I've never heard of anyone borrowing money to do so, pretty much for the reasons you outline. Be they individuals or companies, the costs would be so huge it would probably be a better idea to just handle what money you have to the bank and go walk the earth, or whatever.   it's (was) easy to buy property for cheap    Yeah I think that's it."
bestoflegaladvice,3abv4q,cptal,3,Fri Jun 19 18:54:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah due to the ""American Dream"", everyone and their mother is encouraged to buy a house with the white picket fence and the works. Plenty of people who can barely afford a house will buy a house and rent half of it away to help pay for their mortgage. Of course, being regular Joe, most don't know shit about renting or renovating or anything. They get hit with shitty renter or the roof collapses or something and start missing mortgage payments and the housing bubble bursts and the banks foreclose their home."
bestoflegaladvice,3abv4q,placebo_addicted,58,Fri Jun 19 19:08:04 2015 UTC,Impossible! All landlords are rich beyond words. They only exist to fleece tenants in order to become even richer and get their jollies off by being the oppressor. Do you even Reddit?
bestoflegaladvice,3abv4q,Cyridius,10,Thu Jun 18 22:10:19 2015 UTC,Well if they weren't making money then why are they doing it?
bestoflegaladvice,3abv4q,MrJenikins,26,Fri Jun 19 01:38:56 2015 UTC,"From the current situation my S.O. and I are in, we are landlords because it's easier to rent than it is to sell some times.  She moved in with me, but also already owned a house. Can't afford to break her mortgage term, and selling would take a long length of time. As we don't want to be paying mortgages for 2 places at once while we only live in only one of them, we have rented her place.  The kicker? The rent that we charge for the house doesn't cover the mortgage, the land taxes and the utilities, so we pay out of pocket to break even. It also is counted as taxable income at her marginal tax rate, so we have to try and save a good chunk of it to pay income tax at the end of the year. That's a HUGE amount.  So, no, you aren't always making money. Sure, equity is built in the property, but if you consider the equity in relation to the amount of work I've put into being a landlord, the pay is absolute shit.  Some people's experiences may be different, but I can only speak from my own. Take it for what you will."
bestoflegaladvice,3abv4q,zapking,16,Fri Jun 19 02:16:28 2015 UTC,"Are you expensing the mortgage payments on the rental property on your income taxes?  It sometimes depends, but the general rule for rental property is that you can expense the costs (mortgage, general upkeep, etc) as much as they do not exceed your income. If you're really losing money on the property, you may want to speak with a tax accountant for in depth advice.  Edit: If you want a quick overview, here's a link to 1040 schedule E and a link to an IRS release giving overall information."

Even if he wanted to take a bath on a sale, there were literally no offers while the house was on the market for 6 months.  Eventually they found a renter to at least defray part of their costs on the house.  Between mortgage + maintenance (which by necessity included someone keeping an eye on the house since they were ~800 miles away) + taxes, they weren't even breaking even, just losing less money."

One bad tenant can destroy your profit really quick. If they quit paying and wreck the place you could have a $20,000 swing in just a few months.  The worst part apartments or rental houses are not exactly liquid assets so some landlords get stuck in a hell where they can't sell without fixing the place, but don't have the money to fix the place. It happened to my parents a few years back. Deadbeat quit paying rent, moved a dog in that tore the house apart and by the time they could evict him they were looking at 7 months where the brought in no money from the house and had $10,000 worth of repairs to make before they could rent it again."

bestoflegaladvice,3abv4q,P-01S,23,Fri Jun 19 00:19:43 2015 UTC,"I've never known any pits, but I think I know what you mean...  The thing that worries me most about pit bulls is how defensive pit owners are. Any mention of a dog attack is likely to have at least one ""ah ha! Pits don't do this! Mine is an angel!"".  Methink the ladies (and gents) doth protest too much.  Anyway... judging a dog by its breed is silly. Watch its behavior. Sometimes the owner's behavior is even more telling. Choker collars, chain leashes, etc are bad signs. If the dog has those and the owner is inattentive, be careful. If the owner seems on edge when they see someone else with a dog, watch the fuck out."
bestoflegaladvice,3abv4q,rabiiiii,10,Fri Jun 19 02:51:49 2015 UTC,"They are often defensive. I don't always blame them, it's hard not to be. The attitudes are slowly changing but they have been a very stigmatized breed for at least a decade or so at this point. I wouldn't take being defensive as a sign of that in and of itself.   As a pit owner I have been lectured by strangers about how I shouldn't let my dog around anyone, how she could just snap and go for my throat without warning, etc. I just ignore them but it gets hard for some people.   The problem I'm referring to is people who act like NO pit could ever be aggressive. Or people who exclaim ""they're such a misunderstood breed"" while sticking their face in my dogs face. Like, my dog is friendly as hell but you don't know that, what the hell are you thinking.   Sorry I'm rambling."
bestoflegaladvice,3abv4q,Chordata1,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:43:52 2015 UTC,"You are so right. To expand further on what you said and when they get down right in the dog's face sometimes the dog doesn't like that and will growl and then the person gets the attitude of that dog is a monster. No, you just got all up in the dog's face and it feels threatened.   The issues I have seen with pits over the years are people do not realize they require a higher level of training, they are big muscular dogs that are eager to learn and don't like to give up easily. They can also be stubborn as all hell at times. They are also not natural guard dogs and trying to make them into one can have bad consequences since they do give it their all."
bestoflegaladvice,3abv4q,rabiiiii,-1,Fri Jun 19 22:09:18 2015 UTC,"Ha-ha yeah guarding is not really in their nature, they either play or attack depending on the situation, temperament, and training.  We actually had that exact situation with a friend's pit. He's a fighting rescue. Pretty good temperament but definitely more easily threatened then our little girl who is also a rescue but was basically hand-raised as a puppy.  Someone came up to him while spouting off about how great pits were and came down over his head and face. He growled at him and the dude backed off and was talking about how dangerous it was to have him out."

But I don't see the reasoning for then to be forced to remove the dog after just one minor incident. Just have them try to be more careful in the future, and if it happens again, then remove it. Seems like the neighbor was a little mad over a little thing. Then again, I am a dog person and that wouldn't bother me so much.

If there's two things I've learned from these folks, it's:  a.  there's no such thing as an unloaded firearm - that is, a smart gun owner always treats their weapon as if it is loaded.  The number of people who have died because someone was 100% sure the weapon wasn't loaded is far too high.  b. If you carry a firearm, be prepared to use it. Guns are not props, toys, or fashion accessories. And they're most certainly not meant to make your truck look pretty, either."

bestoflegaladvice,3a6q27,dumbassthenes,-11,Thu Jun 18 06:44:00 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying, I just don't see court ordered child support as reimbursement to one parent, but rather as money that was owed to the kid and never paid.  Money for which the mom was basically trustee.  My imaginary internet legal academy didn't touch on family law though, so I have no idea how the law sees it."
bestoflegaladvice,3a6q27,3euphoric5u,22,Thu Jun 18 07:33:42 2015 UTC,"... Yes, money that was owed to the kid in the form of material support, which in this case it sounds like he was never lacking. I don't disagree that it's money due to the kid and not the custodial parent. But that money was already spent years ago when the mother continue to maintain the kid's standard of living even when the father was not contributing. At this point the father is essentially paying back money 'borrowed' from the mother that the mother provided to the child in his absence."

Payment of rent without a lease usually makes you a month-to-month tenant, which would entitle him to 30 days notice that he had to move when the house is sold.

bestoflegaladvice,3a78gt,ariiiii,8,Thu Jun 18 01:48:50 2015 UTC,"Would they be able to ticket based on video? A security camera might be a viable option: it would provide a more specific source than a picture, so they might be willing to ticket based on that.   I sympathize with your plight, but booting cars yourself is illegal and likely to get the police interested in a bad way.   The only other option I can think of is a shit-ton of bird seed. You might have to put it down right outside your garage so you're not technically throwing bird seed all over someone else's property, but since your car would be inside and the birds outside, only the restaurant customers' cars would be pooped upon. This is also probably a hilariously bad idea, though, and I only bring it up out of thoroughness. And because it's a kinda funny thing to imagine. But you really probably shouldn't do it. Go with the security cameras first."

Someone on your original thread suggested putting orange cones in the alley in front of your driveway. It's a good idea. One of my neighbors does this in front of his house, and no one moves the cones to park there ever. Adding a sign on your property that's visible from that spot that says the area is under camera surveillance could work in combination with the cones.

bestoflegaladvice,3a78gt,cat_handcuffs,5,Wed Jun 17 22:01:36 2015 UTC,There are signs on the physical spot where they park saying I will tow. They move those signs and park there anyways.
bestoflegaladvice,3a78gt,blackjackel,10,Wed Jun 17 22:47:07 2015 UTC,"Have you asked the management/owner of the restaurant if they will cooperate in dissuading their patrons from parking there? People might pay more attention to a sign posted by a business they frequent than they do yours. It seems they do share some responsibility, and I bet they'd rather help you than have you march in to the restaurant every time this happens, looking for the culprit to move their car.   I feel for you. I used to live in a place (also in LA) where my driveway would be blocked at least once a week. It's really aggravating to be trapped by someone's lack of consideration like that.  But I think you're gonna regret it if you go through with the boot thing. You'll end up getting in legal trouble, or more likely, getting your ass kicked by a pissed off car owner.  Good luck to you, in any case."

However, here is a big life tip: Don't make flippant, offensive jokes which other people would say and be dead serious. And if you must, be really damn cautious about it. Because I'd wager the majority of people who make comments like ""make me a sandwich"" are misogynists and not just poking fun at misogynists. It is absolutely not a laughing matter to many women."

There's kind of a similar logic at work here... If you're offending people on a regular basis, you are the problem not them.  It is an issue of respect. There is no legal right not to be offended, but that is why it is about respect; taking care not to offend others is something you have to choose to do voluntarily.  Complaining about others won't fix the issue you perceive. Being more respectful to others will. People will listen to you more, and you won't have to deal with the fallout that comes from offending them.  And I really don't want to sound high and mighty... It's a problem I have too.

There's kind of a similar logic at work here... If you're offending people on a regular basis, you are the problem not them.   I agree completely with that. Believe in it firmly. But most people that make little comments like I did truly have no intent to be an asshole. Something pops into their mind and they say it.  The problem is (my opinion) the ones that go out of their way to offend people.  I don't try to offend anyone (usually, except my ex, never gets old with them) I just say what I think.  And respect is mutual when conversing with others. Yes people shouldn't try to be an asshole. Yes people shouldn't always say things that might be offensive. But people should first go "" hmmm.... Did they mean this as a joke or try to offend"" and maybe give the benefit of the doubt before getting offended. Unless it happens a lot or is just way past the line.  And if something truly does offend you then politely ask that person to avoid jokes like that around you in the future. With most people being respectful like that goes a lot further than labeling someone as hating X because they said Y.  No one should be afraid to speak their mind under fear of being labeled a hater. Let's face it everyone has some inappropriate humor they enjoy."

Sometimes what you think will offend people if you state it exactly as you think it, even if there is not a good reason for them to be offended.  I'll be blunt: I have an autism spectrum disorder - recently diagnosed. I have (in hindsight) pushed away a lot of people by being straightforward and honest with good intentions. Other people's responses might not make intuitive sense to me, but I understand that those responses do happen. I have some strong feelings about honesty and being straightforward, but such rigid thinking is another aspect of autism...  This sort of thing has been on my mind a lot lately. You can't control how people respond to what you say, but you can control what you say."

You just said you don't try to be an asshole or offend anyone, you just say what pops into your head - you may not purposely try to be an asshole, but you are.

All that aside, modern buildings are designed to give warning signs when they're losing structural integrity, rather than just spontaneously collapsing.  These warning signs include things like sagging floors, major cracks appearing in plastered shear walls, and the BUILDING NOTICICEABLY TILTING AT AN ANGLE.  The major difference between a modern building and a four-story pile of bricks that some idiot built without blueprints, is that the modern building will give out these warning signs before collapsing.  By choosing to ignore these warning signs, OP is no longer benefitting from living in a modern building.  Therefore, they should move to a four-story pile of unlicensed and uninspected bricks, where the rent will be considerably lower."

It seems hard to believe that the smell would linger on clothes or in the car for half a week (assuming OP was honest about the last time he smoked).  It does sound like the officers were trying to nail people who had a residual high from partying on 4/20. First they invent a reason for the stop (to ""give a warning"" probably), then they ""smell pot"", then they grill the possibly-still-stoned driver.

I was referencing smoking as a whole (see my post), no matter the source.  You (I assume) were referencing only cigarettes.  My assertion remains the same.  No matter the smoke source . . . cigars, cigarettes, campfires, weed, smoke-signals, or otherwise . . . if you smoke it often in your car or in some other area, the smell will linger.  No matter what.  Further, you will be desensitized to it.  The smell will linger, and you will probably not notice.  I wasn't asserting some empirical double-blind study regarding weed versus cigarette smoking.  I simply said, no matter the source, the smell will linger depending on how much you smoke."

Back when smoking in bars was legal, I could tell immediately if someone had been to a bar by the smell of cigarette smoke.

They take note and control the when, where, and how they're smoking.  Unless you had just caught them coming in from a smoke, one would never know.  But I also know potheads who hotbox and smoke so frequently it follows them around like Pig-Pen.  There is no hard rule when dealing with this stuff.  All I am saying is that generally speaking, any form of smoke is going to linger.  Further, it is beneficial to assume as much.  If you're smoking something you want to hide, better to assume as much and take precautions.   And no, I don't smoke anything, so I am not desensitized.   I don't smoke pot or cigarettes either."

The blindfold represents objectivity, in that justice is or should be meted out objectively, without fear or favour, regardless of money, wealth, power, or identity; blind justice and impartiality. The earliest Roman coins depicted Justitia with the sword in one hand and the scale in the other, but with her eyes uncovered.[5] Justitia was only commonly represented as ""blind"" since about the end of the 15th century. The first known representation of blind Justice is Hans Gieng's 1543 statue on the Gerechtigkeitsbrunnen (Fountain of Justice) in Berne.[6]"

bestoflegaladvice,39xt3f,carboncle,34,Mon Jun 15 20:18:26 2015 UTC,"The most horrific thing about DV is that it's so hard to see from the inside.  From the outside, it's easy to say ""That person is treating you like crap"" but from the inside?  When they say ""love is blind"" they're not kidding.  Eventually, you hope, something breaks so the abused person can see what's going on. If it's violent abuse, you have to hope it happens before they get killed.  Sad."
bestoflegaladvice,39xt3f,mizmoose,17,Mon Jun 15 20:24:25 2015 UTC,"Stephen King has a great quote about living with an addict, but I think it applies pretty well to living in an abusive situation.   ""People outside such relationships will sometimes ask, 'How could you let such a business go on for so many years? Didn't you see the elephant in the living room?' And it's so hard for anyone living in a more normal situation to understand the answer that comes closest to the truth; 'I'm sorry, but it was there when I moved in. I didn't know it was an elephant; I thought it was part of the furniture.'""  So terribly sad."
bestoflegaladvice,39xt3f,OhPleaseDont,6,Tue Jun 16 14:19:10 2015 UTC,Hell in coming out of a relationship and while I was never happy with how he spoke to me at times but I never saw it as abusive. It's only showing my counsellor a comment he'd made and her asking me 'you know this is abusive right' made me rethink it. It's so hard to see.
bestoflegaladvice,39xt3f,Lozzif,2,Wed Jun 17 09:01:28 2015 UTC,"I understand that victims of domestic abuse are unlikely to see the problem the eleventieth time they get get hit, but I don't understand the thought process whereby people forgive getting hit by their SO the first time..."
bestoflegaladvice,39xt3f,P-01S,18,Tue Jun 16 15:53:32 2015 UTC,"Because there's been a series of escalating acts that you get used to before you're actually hit.  If your completely sweet boyfriend hit you out of the blue, you're going to be like ""wtf, I'm out."" If the boyfriend who you're used to rationalizing when he gets in your face, when he punches walls in front of you, etc. hits you, to rationalize a little further isn't as much of a stretch."
bestoflegaladvice,39xt3f,MundiMori,8,Tue Jun 16 17:05:42 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. I also recall reading an explanation of the differences between violence, fighting, and defense. They described violence as not necessarily physical, i.e. words and actions can be violent without physically harming the victim. It makes more sense to me in that sense... that the first blow is only one more in a long string of escalating violence."
bestoflegaladvice,39xt3f,P-01S,9,Tue Jun 16 17:47:55 2015 UTC,"Because when you're convinced that someone you love would ""never hurt"" you, you make excuses for their behaviour. ""It was a one time thing!  It was just because of [event]!""    Also, abusers tend to be charismatic when they're not abusive.  and full of apologies for what they've done.  ""It'll never happen again!"", usually with gestures to prove how much they love the person they abuse... until, of course, it happens again."

bestoflegaladvice,39xt3f,P-01S,7,Mon Jun 15 19:31:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I can't imagine someone who is severely depressed managing to work up the willpower to punch someone. As a commentator said, the guy was angry and acted out of anger--not depression. Granted, depression hits everyone differently, but it often saps emotions. I pretty much couldn't get pissed off about anything when I was depressed... Or happy about anything. Or even sad."

bestoflegaladvice,39xt3f,Puppy_Spymaster,3,Thu Jun 18 06:06:16 2015 UTC,"As someone who suffered treatment-resistant depression for years, violence is not a normal response to depression. In fact, depression saps motivation and activity levels, so it should have made him less likely to be violent. He was not depressed-- he was angry. And he was unable to control his anger, and took it out on you. For the benefit of everyone else around him, he needs to understand that that sort of behavior is simply not acceptable, not ever, and that means legal repercussions.   I think that we can all agree that violence, abuse, and aggression are never acceptable, no matter what the cause. However, there is research that indicates that anger and aggression are often symptoms of depression. Unfortunately, they may not often be recognized as such and so a potentially valuable treatment avenue may not be explored.  EDIT: I'm tired and posted the same link twice. So now only one link for you!!"
bestoflegaladvice,39xt3f,P-01S,5,Mon Jun 15 17:54:31 2015 UTC,"I think the issue there is that depression is more of a category than a particular illness. Major depressive disorder or acute bouts of depression can literally leave people without the energy or willpower to walk.  People with lower levels of chronic depression can become very frustrated by it, and yes, anger is a possible outlet."
bestoflegaladvice,39xt3f,Puppy_Spymaster,5,Wed Jun 17 02:56:21 2015 UTC,"Major depressive disorder or acute bouts of depression can literally leave people without the energy or willpower to walk.   Yes, it can. But there's a huge spectrum of symptoms and behaviours even within MDD. Many people, often men, express their depressive symptoms in ways that we wouldn't expect of a person with ""depression"".  (Also, I just realized that the second link ended up a duplicate.

bestoflegaladvice,39couc,gasolinerainbow,-16,Thu Jun 11 01:16:09 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Like they say, fucking coontown still exists. The guys who banned FPH went out of their way to say coontown is ALLOWED to stay because they only ban actions, not ideas. But on FPH, what thy were banned for is taking photos of some girl and putting it in the sidebar? Who is getting banned for stealing photos of the people who are put on the subs dedicated to mocking people, like /trashy or /cringe or whatever? Who is getting banned for posting literal, actual, real-for-real hate-speech in a sub like coontown?   There are subs that regularly do the same thing FPH was for. There are TONS of subs that are devoted to making fun of and mocking people that deserve it. Its human nature. Ive seen these guys who are in favor of removing hate speech make pretty shitty statements about how everybody else/other groups of people deserve it. Get off your high horse. I'm not saying ban those other subs; you're right, the guys the mock are detestable, these dudes deserve it. But FPH was at worst, just making fat jokes about people, calling somebody a pork-orc, that kind of stuff. You can't apply your morals selectively.  You call yourselves some bastion of tolerance and friendship or whatever the fuck but hide this huge mountain of skeletons in your closet, that's what pisses me off.  Honestly I never really gave a shit if people were fat or not, it doesn't really affect me. I went there to remind myself how people are actually thinking about you. And sometimes you would just post with the other guys about whatever, exercise tips, camping trips, that kind of shit.  Keep in mind FPH was one of the bigger subs, too. It had 150K subscribers, which put it in something like the top 10 or 15 most viewed subforums outside of the generic ones that you start out being subscribed to. And it never backslid, more people kept joining. That's why it's such a big deal.  Sorry for sperging out; I came here from some other FPH post linking to yours."

Not to decry that experience, but I use throwaways to comment specifically because a similar thing happened to me where either a single user with sockpuppets, or several people kept following me around reddit and harassing me and telling me to kill myself.  I also reported them all, but it leads me to believe that it's reddit's users, not FPH's users, to the point where I delete all comments after a day or less, even on my sockpuppets."

If I'm a hardcore racist, and they deleted the one sub I like to share my racism, I'm still a hardcore racist using this website.  If people attacked you for your views before, they will continue to do so after the subs been deleted, that was my overall point.  Harassment exists on reddit simply for having a differing opinion, removing the place where the shitty people hang out doesn't change a thing.  fatpeoplehate2 has existed for a year, I don't doubt a number of users were subscribed to both.  What percentage of a user base has to harass for a sub to be deleted?  If I went on a spree saying bestoflegaladvice is the only good subreddit and threatened to kill people, would this sub get deleted?  For an analog, 16 people from FPH would have to brigade for the same overall effect.  What if it was really a pissed off segment of fatpeoplehate2 blaming fatpeoplehate, and the admins banned the wrong sub?  I don't like harassment or brigading but this action does nothing but show a disregard for free speech on this website (not the legal 'free speech' but the ability to speak freely).  It doesn't stop the users from attacking each other, and I still have to use throwaways."

I don't understand why there's this 'fat accepting movement' and suddenly it's bad to tell people they need to lose weight.  If we were discussing about smokers you'd agree with me because the're hurting their lungs and bodies. It's the same thing with fat people. Their killing themselves and decreasing the time that have to spend with their kids and families.  Abusing their kids by letting them eat anything under the sun and drinking mountain dew at 3-6 when it's the worst for their health and teeth.    I'm on a tangent, so I'll hush now but that's how I feel."

Instead let's sit here and whine because a website that is free and privately owned is moderating their website.   If reddit removed one of the subreddit I frequent then I can take a quick Google search and go find another one to fill that void.    I hate you if only for the fact you're making me defend a shitty subreddit.   There are at least 2 sides to everything. I understand not everyone will have my opinion. I wasn't trying to attempt to attack this banning I was just looking more at the comments and how childish they were."

bestoflegaladvice,39couc,Anonymoose15,26,Thu Jun 11 11:10:39 2015 UTC,They are. And even in their heyday they never actively harassed people. They are exactly what their title says.
bestoflegaladvice,39couc,kurin,-26,Thu Jun 11 20:27:49 2015 UTC,"Does that mean it can't be harassing?   It definitely doesn't, but the admins haven't exactly been models of transparency in regards to the harassment.  Did they experience vote brigading and if so which posts, was there comments specifically tied to the group, were any users shadowbanned, etc.   Nope. I feel these should be banned too.   ""Yishan Wong, the site's former CEO, has stated that ""We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it.""""  I agree with him, you don't, to each their own.   Why through up a stink when there are a billion other websites and discussion boards you can go on?   If there is a replacement for reddit I'm sure a massive user base would happily switch.  Voat seems to be the favourite right now.  More to the point, plenty of things on this site I find distasteful, but I'm flush with options to filter them and I'm the first in line for responsibility on the content I browse.  If there are a billion other websites then why not the people with the problem leave?  The rest of us will happily not use picsofdeadpeople (just an example), but respect the fact they have a open platform to use.   If reddit removed one of the subreddit I frequent then I can take a quick Google search and go find another one to fill that void.   Kinda defeats the whole purpose then, doesn't it?  If everyone is just going to fatpeoplehate2, then why bother deleting the first one at all?  I appreciate the fact we can have different opinions and have a place to say them, but now I'm worried I have to either join the hivemind or be banned."
bestoflegaladvice,39couc,gsfgf,26,Thu Jun 11 21:38:54 2015 UTC,"Did they experience vote brigading and if so which posts, was there comments specifically tied to the group, were any users shadowbanned, etc.   That wasn't the reasoning they presented for the subreddit ban. From one of the admins:   When we are using the word ""harass"", we're not talking about ""being annoying"" or vote manipulation or anything. We're talking about men and women whose lives are being affected and worry for their safety every day, because people from a certain community on reddit have decided to actually threaten them, online and off, every day. When you've had to talk to as many victims of it as we have, you'd understand that a brigade from one subreddit to another is miles away from the harassment we don't want being generated on our site.   You're free to dispute their analysis, but they aren't using harassment here to mean merely brigading. They're saying that ongoing serious harassment of people was being perpetrated by large numbers of users from the specific subreddits they targeted here.  They specifically did not ban /r/FatPeopleHate because it expressed violently anti-fat views, except insofar as a sub like /r/FatPeopleHate will inevitably draw in precisely the sort of person who will harass people. But that's the FPH mods' problem, not the admins', and it's entirely reasonable to take an approach of eliminating subreddits that are poisoning the entire platform by attracting masses of users who attack other users."

Perhaps in there future there is some cataclysmic event and something akin to an islamic republic takes over, who then declare homosexuality illegal, and also anything said nice about gay people is hate speech because its shows hatred for the government. Another example: Christian's could consider everything coming out of /r/atheism as hate speech, while atheists would consider anything said against atheists as hate speech against them.

Also make sure the clothes you are wearing are from goodwill and scratch the serial number off the gun you have a friend purchase for you. Then walk up to his front door, knock and shoot him twice in the head then walk away(don't run) get in your car(false license plate) and drive away. Reach a distance of 50 miles away from the scene and bury the gloves and dump fuel all over your clothes, mask, and fake license place. Then burn them with a lighter. If police come you immediately invoke the 5th if arrested or request an attorney if they just wish to question you. As illegal advice cannot be offered in this subreddit, this is all a complete work of fiction and I obviously would not or could not endorse the murder of another human being. Please do not take my hypothetical scenario to heart.""  What a fucking act"

That's a supplementary $1500 dollars a month for such a simple program, an aimbot is rarely more than 200 lines of code, my early prototype build(which works ok) only required 3 algorithms, a way to calculate the angle between to vectors, a world to screen, and get 3d distance(d = sqrt((x22 -x2)+(y22-y2)+(z22 - z2))) I coded it in a day.

I can get sued for violating the EULA, but it's a good thing I don't own a copy of csgo, so I'm fine on that front.

Even without the glucose monitoring system a well-seasoned diabetic can, often times, feel what's about to happen before the crash hits. If you're so low that you can't remember whether you paid for a tire or not then you're probably below 60 mg/dl. If you crash fast then you probably started feeling that ~100 mg/dl, which is probably around a 5 minute head start, depending on the diabetic.

Do you have issues getting dizzy when you stand up, or getting dizzy after you've been standing still for too long? Do you drink a lot of water but still feel dehydrated?  If so, it might be because your body isn't processing salt efficiently.  Hyponatremia can be caused/exacerbated by a lot of prescription medications, but doctors don't tend to mention it to younger patients because it's usually only a problem for older people. It can also be an issue if you sweat a lot (working out frequently, working in hot environments, etc.) because when you sweat, you lose both water and salt. Or you can just be born with it, like me.   I carry a salt grinder around in my purse for when I can tell my blood salt is getting low. (Luckily I really like salt, so it's not too much of a problem for me!) You can also drink Gatorade and other sports drinks with salt in them.   It's something to think about, at least. If your anemia causes significant issues, you might want to see an endocrinologist to get blood salt, thyroid, and cortisol levels and such tested. But the salt thing is at least something you can try at home!   But yeah... Just having ""salt-diabetes,"" I can't imagine why someone with actual diabetes would get in a car and drive instead of asking for help and getting sugar right away. People don't even know about hyponatremia, but when I've had to say ""I need salt or I will faint,"" people have been very kind and helped me find salt! And for every place that has salt shakers/salt packets, there are even more places that have sugar packets, because anywhere there's coffee, there's sugar!   If I can eat raw salt out of paper packets when I need to, OP should be able to manage a mouthful of sugar, for crying out loud."

So how does that justify doing a 180 and convicting the girl?   It generally doesn't, which is why this post was so difficult to believe.  In general, to convict someone of making a false report, the prosecutors have to prove that the defendant knowingly lied.  For things like rape accusations, this is exceedingly difficult to prove.  In general, it's only workable in situations where the prosecution can provide ironclad evidence that the original accused could not possibly have done it, and that the accuser had to have known that.  The chances of convicting a pregnant 14-year-old for false reporting are infinitesimally tiny."

Dealers are more likely to cut the drugs to make them less potent, not more, and that is hard to do to weed because of the distinctive look and smell. Nor are they going to add something to make a stronger high without charging you more and making you aware of it. Their business is at risk if they give out bad/adulterated product- marijuana may be addictive (whether it is or not isn't the point) but it isn't like heroin- if you get shitty/adulterated weed from your dealer most stoners will get a new dealer and spread the word that the dealer is messing up.

There are several psychoactive artificial cannabinoid families (e.g. AM-xxx, HU-xxx, JWH-xxx, CP xx) that are used as designer drugs sprayed on herbs and sold as natural highs under brand names like K2  and Spice,  both of which are genericized trademarks used for any synthetic cannabis product.

Synthetic weed otherwise known as JWH-018 among it's many derivatives essentially targets the same part of the brain as THC(CB1 and CB2 receptors) however THC is a bit more benign as it is a mere partial agonist of these receptors meaning it partially binds to said receptors. As opposed to synthetic weed which is a full agonist, pretty much takes over the receptor in full which leads to more instances of paranoia, psychosis,  getting too high which causes panic, etc."

Well, she might be a sociopath, in which case there was literally nothing her parents could do but try to keep her from ending up as a serial killer. Sometimes all the good parenting in the world can't fix the fact that their kid's just wired differently. And it's cruel to comment about their parenting skills when, a lot of the time, they would give anything to be able to fix the problem-- you just can't know.    I mean, it could be affluenza or something of the sort, which could indeed be the result of a parenting failure. But the sheer persistence of her insistence that she's not at fault, plus the impulsiveness and thinking only of herself, makes me think it might be an issue of innate sociopathic tendencies.

But it's not the kid's fault the thing was sold -- it was the evil court's fault!  His punishment includes 25 whole hours of work, but since he's early every day the bosses think he's just the best!  And he should be complimented for offering ""free service"" to the government!  It also includes an evaluation by someone of the court's choosing because, of course, that's how they are biased against everyone. And if the eval finds anything you have to do it.  But they won't, because he rarely drinks so there's no way he could be an alcoholic!  The horrible examiner asked horrible questions to determine if he has a problem but also to see if he has any remorse for his actions, which of course he doesn't, because only drinking on some weekends means you can't be an alcoholic!  And then, when they call back after the originally stated two-week window -- because, as we all know, government agencies run like clockwork -- and tell him he has to undergo treatment, he tells them that despite being told if the eval finds anything you have to do it that he doesn't have to do it.  But, wait!  The courts are now mad that he didn't do the thing they told him to do that he felt he shouldn't have to do.

When I had my DUI I had two years of probation at 40 something dollars a month.  But, I could just pay the whole thing lump-sum and not be on probation anymore, which I did.  That proves though that the probation was just about generating the fee, as opposed to a criminal justice issue."
bestoflegaladvice,38sez2,Brad_Wesley,14,Sat Jun 6 15:42:40 2015 UTC,Same thing with me. I got one and had to do this ridiculously expensive Satop class which even the instructor said is just a money grab. But one thing that they did was have us calculate the final cost of everything and divide it by how many drinks you had. That was actually the part that hit me the most (other than the victims impact panel that I went to. That was actually pretty tough)  So I essentially drank $600 bottles of beer that night...
bestoflegaladvice,38sez2,boblablaugh,10,Sat Jun 6 15:56:30 2015 UTC,"Hmm.. so I spent 4,000 total on lawyers, and I think another 3,000 on probation, fines, and fees for classes.  so, $7,000 total.  HOWEVER, I easily drank 25 beers that day.  So, $280 a beer."
bestoflegaladvice,38sez2,Brad_Wesley,12,Sat Jun 6 16:26:36 2015 UTC,Wow. 25 beers!  Grand total for me was around $8000 and I drank a 12 pack.  It really sucks because I would never get behind the wheel after drinking. I was up late partying with an old friend who came to town. Went to bed but got called into work early for an emergency and got nailed. I totally thought I slept it off. Luckily my job was very forgiving and it didn't cost me that as well.

Anyway, my ex-wife bails me out the next morning.    I said ""thanks, how much do I owe you""?  She said ""nothing, I used one of your checkbooks that I still had"".

Typically deadly force is considered justified, and a defense of justifiable homicide applicable, in cases ""when the actor reasonably fears imminent peril of death or serious bodily harm to him or herself or another"".  The doctrine is not a defined law that can be invoked, but a set of principles which is incorporated in some form in the law of many states.

Also, I don't think he knows how advertising works:   When they clicked on these ads I'd be paid.  Ads aren't evil, it's Google's whole business model!   Google gets money from ads because the companies that are being advertised pay Google to show the ads. Where is this money he's getting for ad clicks coming from? If the companies in question are paying him, then it won'the take long for the cops to get in touch with them (since they are being advertised and whatnot) then they'll be able to point right to him as being the recipient of their money.

Google runs both programs, but several other companies run them too, and there's also companies that will deal with people directly. So you've got either Company>Google>Person, or Company>Person.    Ads on 99.9% of websites are PPC or affiliate ads. Google's program is the easiest, with the lowest barrier of entry. But if your blog/website gets big enough, you'll have companies contacting you directly to place ads. Simply because it's cheaper. Instead of paying Google $0.30/click, they pay you $0.20/click.     Which makes his story even more troll-y. I highly, highly doubt he runs anything large enough to have direct contact with any companies. And Google is far too protective of their PPC program(s) for something like that to slide through.

So if I own stupidwebsite.com and I am an affiliate of some 3rd party advertising, when you visit my webpage, part of what loads are ads served from the TPA (third-party advertiser) and embedded into the page that loads on your screen. These ads have an affiliate number and if you click on one of those ads I get paid because the link contains my affiliate number.  Most likely, OP has set himself up as an affiliate with one or more TPAs and his script merely inserts his affiliate number while removing the original affiliate number. So he is stealing from the original affiliate.  As for where the money comes from. A company like United Airlines, for example, purchases inbound clicks from the TPA for a certain amount and the affiliate gets a cut.  EDIT: By the way, a lot of these hacking scripts exist online and so OP most likely didn't write the script himself (or at least the core of the script).

I paid this late fee many times and it was a flat one dollar, so I'm assuming taxes were taken out 'underneath' the late fee.  Also, 3-day rentals came to $2.10.  On this particular day, the girl behind the counter told me the late return fee was $2.10.  I said: I thought late returns were one dollar per day. Where does the extra ten cents come from?  She said: ""It's tax""  I said: ""But tax is six percent. So if it was tax, the total should be two dollars and twelve cents.""  She said: ""Sir, your late fee is $2.10""  I said: ""I have no problem paying it, but I just want to understand why it is $2.10 and not $2""  She said: ""Sir, you are arguing over a dime.""  I would like to sue her for the ten cents plus twenty-five years of emotional distress she has caused me with her last comment. Do I have a case?

This way the person has some hope of living an otherwise normal life, even if they believe the government is spying on them. They just go about an ordinary day while ""knowing"" they're being spied on.  For example, I heard about a man who believed he was being targeted by assassins or something similar for secret government work that he believed he was doing. Through therapy, he was able to decide that it was unlikely anyone was trying to kill him, so he would continue sending and receiving ""secret codes"" but was otherwise able to live without anxiety and hold a job to keep up his ""cover."" Sometimes that's the best you can hope for.  This is probably why the therapist hasn't told him this isn't happening, because it likely wouldn't be helpful if s/he did."

Sometimes, if a client has good insight and the delusions or hallucinations are relatively mild, it's possible to teach them some reality testing techniques—for example, asking themselves something like, ""Where is the voice actually coming from? Is it realistic that this person would be saying that? What if I just ask this person whether they said anything?"" But you're right that directly challenging someone's delusional beliefs, especially strong ones, can lead to their distrusting you or getting angry.

Therapy dogs are expensive to train, so that's prohibitive off the bat. Then, like all pets, they require a lot of care, and a seriously mentally-ill person can't take care of their own basic needs, let alone the needs of a pet. There's probably also the risk that the owner will hurt, give up, or abandon the pet, either out of anger or because they believe it's in the pet's best interest (e.g., ""I need to let you go before they come and kill me and you""). I'm curious if, like with PTSD veterans and prisoners, it's becoming more popular, perhaps part of more comprehensive therapy regimes."

bestoflegaladvice,38dqvo,SexualHarasmntPanda,3,Fri Jun 5 21:28:09 2015 UTC,"Same thing happened to a couple of friends. They were contracted to a gig and left their cars parked behind the shop. The lot overlooked a creek. No big deal, right?  While they were off at the gig the remains of a hurricane came by (who expects that in frickin' Western PA?!) and dumped One (1) Mega-Shit-Ton of water on the area.  They got back from the gig and found the creek was now a raging river. Everyone's cars were underwater. The shop was underwater. It was horrific. I mean, any place near a river or creek in the area was underwater. Roads, highways, homes.  Glub, glub, glub.  Buying a used car was fun for the next few years because a lot of lots kept trying to pass off flood cars."
bestoflegaladvice,38dqvo,SuperSalsa,22,Fri Jun 5 21:31:09 2015 UTC,I have no sympathy for people who get the cheapest insurance they can. I have a $250 deductible with full comprehensive insurance because I know I'd be screwed if something happened to my car. I don't mind that it costs me a bit more every month.   I totaled my car in an accident a few years ago and it completely saved my ass that I had good insurance.   This is the reason why so many poor people can't climb out of their socio-economic class. No foresight and not willing to pay a little more for much better protection. Like the number of people who post and don't have renter's insurance. It's dirt cheap and can really save your ass.
bestoflegaladvice,38dqvo,itsmyotherface,31,Wed Jun 3 19:26:23 2015 UTC,"To be fair a high deductible doesn't automatically equal shitty insurance.  I work in auto insurance, I know what I'm looking at, and I carry a $1K deductible.  Because I can afford it.  If you select a deductible you can't afford...that's just idiotic."
bestoflegaladvice,38dqvo,meem1029,18,Wed Jun 3 17:36:29 2015 UTC,Yeah that makes sense if you can afford it. But I was luckily told when I was first driving to get the lowest deductible I can afford until I have enough income to cover a higher deductible. Which OP clearly doesn't.
bestoflegaladvice,38dqvo,mizmoose,5,Wed Jun 3 18:00:48 2015 UTC,"It all comes around to people not really understanding their insurance. There are some things it makes sense to save a buck on(skipping small extras you don't care about, routinely looking for better rates, etc), but a lot of things that don't(lowering limits, going with a shady company). And then there's stuff like the deductible, which will vary by your financial situation.  (For the curious: Here's a decent breakdown of car insurance.)"
bestoflegaladvice,38dqvo,meem1029,12,Wed Jun 3 18:08:19 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  I don't know about others, but when I decreased my collision/comprehensive deductibles from $1000/$1000 to $500/$250, it only cost me an extra 15 bucks of premium each month."

bestoflegaladvice,38dqvo,itsmyotherface,12,Wed Jun 3 18:48:20 2015 UTC,"I'm in a better place now where I can afford better insurance, but I live in a place with shitty mass transit, I cannot ride a bike, and my car isn't new.  For a while there $15/month meant less food on an already strained budget.  I mean, I drive under 3000 miles a year, but when I need a car, I need a car."

bestoflegaladvice,38dqvo,SexualHarasmntPanda,-3,Wed Jun 3 20:30:24 2015 UTC,"You're really making some large conclusions about my opinions. Are you just trying to show you somehow  hold the moral high ground? Or did I just strike a nerve?  I see too many people make too many stupid decisions that keep screwing them over in the long run. And at the same time society penalizes those who make the poor financial decisions than those with more resources, or at least those that can live within their means.    If you have bad credit you can only get loans with crazy interest rates that only exacerbates the problem; If at all.   People sign leases for apartments they can't afford every month. They are late a couple times and then suddenly have an eviction on their record which makes it almost impossible to rent a decent apartment down the road.   A person gets a ticket and neglects to pay it because they think if they ignore it it will go away. A couple months later they get pulled over and arrested for an outstanding bench warrant and driving on a suspended license. Suddenly that $150 fine just became $1000+ and they lose their ability to drive their car. Not to mention their insurance will go through the roof because of it.   OP and his car insurance issue, goes out and gets a new car beyond his financial means and has to get cheap insurance because he's spending too much on car payments. Or whatever else consumes his income. But regardless I can safely assume he can't afford the car if he can't come up with $1000.    A little foresight and responsibility goes a long way in life. I look back on my friends from growing up, half of them couldn't plan out the next week, much less plan for the future. It's all about instant gratification. And guess what, they're starting to have a much harder life because they have no marketable skills or experience to make enough money to support a family. And guess how many of them already have kids?   Obviously these are generalizations, and there will always be exceptions. But all the same just spend a couple hours going through people's posts here, a large percentage of their problems wouldn't be problems if they lived within their means and addressed things as they come instead of ignoring them."

Coverage F is medical payments, but it's a super low limit and all your friends have health insurance, right?  So who cares.  The reason renters insurance keeps getting pushed so hard in this sub is coverage E - personal liability with limits of typically $100K+.

Ned Stark of course believes that the man who gives the sentence should swing the sword, whereas Tywin Lannister doesn't consider himself responsible for murders commited by his men, even when it was his direct order. Spoiler alert: The Martells however disagree, and think Tywin is ultimately responsible for the crimes of his men.  So to answer OP's question, it depends on the jurisdiction. Should he hire a hitman in the Westerlands, he'd probably escape liability. But in Dorne, you are responsible for a murder you ordered or allowed to happen. Now in the North it's a bit more complex. You would most certainly be shunned for not doing your own dirty work. There's a line of obiter in the case of Mycah v The Hound (297 AL) where Lord Stark suggests that the person who orders the murder is as responsible for the deed as the person who carried it out. We haven't seen whether or not a court would enforce that, however.  PS, if you're a show watcher but not a book reader, don't check out /r/asoiafreread. There is nothing for you there but pain."

She had worked there maybe a month or two, and knew we had a very strict policy that employees that did petsitting had to be licensed and insured, and have worked there a full year to be allowed to offer their services to clients.   One day, we noticed a random dog in the isolation room, which was in its own corner of the hospital. The dog had no cage card, no tag, no name anywhere on it, no chart, nothing to identify it. It also had no food, water, or blankets. No one had any clue who it was or how long it had been there (it could have gone days without anyone noticing it, no one went back there unless there was a patient there). We don't even know if we can walk it, or if it has some contagious disease.   Frantic calls are made to every employee once we determine that no one there that day knew anything about it. Turns out, dumb new girl had offered to pet sit it for a client and kept it secret. Girl had a bird that she was notoriously irresponsible with allowing out of its cage (she had to be told to stop bringing it to work with her and letting it fly around the office, or it could get eaten by a patient). She left the house with the client's dog running around in it and the bird loose flying around. She came home, and the dog had eaten the bird (shocking, who could've seen that coming?). Her response was to bring the dog to the office and dump it in a cage in isolation and leave without telling anyone anything about it. The poor dog had been alone in an empty cage with no food, water, blanket, walks, or attention for nearly 10 hours by the time we found it, while she collected $75 per day from the client to lavish it with love and attention.  It was a huge mess, and we had to call the client and tell her what happened, and offered to board the dog for free until she returned. Girl was fired immediately, client sued for her money back. Poor bird, but how stupid and irresponsible can you get?  Always check references, license, and bonding for petsitters.

But overall you're probably right that the trespassing is just the lesser rap that they pinned him for when they couldn't prove something else he was doing, cause campus cops just don't go around chasing people off campus for trespassing. Why do you think he's a pharmaceuticals sales rep specifically, though?

I thought the man was some sort of paranoid schizophrenic at first.  He came to tell me that he needed my help because the Hells Angels had taken over his former employer, CN rail. Also, he was an Agent for CSIS (Canadian CIA) and the RCMP (Canadian FBI) had him in witness relocation. The matter was urgent because there were some men going around town selling fish and he thought they were Hells Angels members trying to locate and kill him. Worryingly, he had two pistols he kept with him to ensure his safety (lawfully obtained a decade earlier, which is hard in Canada).  He brought me a binder full of newspaper clippings of oil spills that he claimed were all related as evidence of his alleged conspiracy. I found out later he had been fired from CN rail because he had....gone off the rails (sorry, had to make that pun) and had become obsessed that the organization was persecuting him.  When I asked a Doctor about fixed delusions, he told me that there was no point in talking to the man, trying to reason with him, and that medication was ineffective in treating the disorder. Apparently, there was nothing to be done with him and that whatever you did to try and reason with him was pointless.  He was going to continue his crusade regardless of whatever evidence you offered him.  Someday I see OP in a similar situation, like Don Quixote charging his windmill."

There have been cases where students are sent for involuntary holds and expelled and banned from campus in the first 72 hours of the hold, with no chance to represent themselves. Dorm rooms are sometimes just emptied into dumpsters and in some cases, left open for other students to go through.   It's stunningly unfair and while there have been several cases that have ruled against schools for behaving like this, by and large the  ""solution"" for those with mental illness is hasty excision. Since this kind of action only exacerbates mental health conditions, the majority of cases go unreported.

If that doesn't work, put the rest into a small storage container for the person / their family to deal with within a certain clearly communicated time period - but one that takes into consideration the possibility of being disowned by one's family and the inability of the person to deal with it because they are on an involuntary hold.    Hospitals / inpatient facilities have social workers on staff that regularly deal with such issues and those folks could be contacted. Charge the family for the damage / cleaning / reno / reasonable storage fees and hopefully re-coup costs.   I'm not suggesting a significant difference from what is being done now.

As in, it wandered, still living, into his apartment before he epoxy'd it shut. Though I'm not sure how that would work. Maybe he left the door open and it smelled the (freshish) dead animals...  Edit: on the other hand, could it be that the cat never died? Based on the wording he says there were, ""dead animals, rodents and a stray cat that wandered in."" We're all asumming it means ""dead animals: [dead] rodents and a [dead] stray cat."" But he also states that the animals he picked up were mostly lizards and birds -- so what if it's that these dead animals, plus his own food, that attracted rodents, which in turn attracted a stray cat. Ergo he means, ""dead animals, [and living] rodents and a [live] stray cat."" This is the best possible solution and therefor I choose to believe it."

Which makes me feel better, at least, since there's a difference between accidentally allowing cats to die (and accumulating already dead animals) and deliberately killing or coldly watching them die.

I have could file a dispute but I really think saying ""I didn't give notice because I was improperly evicted"" is waving a big flag in front of future landlords.

This is dangerous because people often do it on the stove, and butane is significantly heavier than air, so it can accumulate around the flame and then catches fire.   I know one person who does this. He had one flare up and mildly caught his face on fire. My dad is a chemist and happened to be talking to me about lab accidents the next day, and mentioned that in almost every lab accident, you have one of two things (or both): someone scaled up a process they had done before without making necessary changes, or someone was doing a process they had learned from someone else without fully understanding the chemistry of it.

He worked as an assistant manager at a dispensary I used to visit.  I remember this incident well.  If it is said person, then he received burns on about 60% - 80% of his body, and fucked himself up pretty good.  Even his fellow employees seemed amazed at the stupidity of his actions.

I'm waiting for the followup post after he's broken into the flat to retrieve his money and drug stash. I'm pretty sure he'll screw that up in some way.   He hasn't returned to work since the fire, the shop is under new management, and I'm guessing that he lost his badge (license issued by the state allowing you to work in the marijuana industry).

So there's this talk radio host who is all about pro se legal representation, specifically regarding traffic law.  It's his firm belief that if you aren't engaged in ""commercial activity"" with your vehicle then requirements like insurance, registration, having a driver's license, etc, don't apply to you.  Those are only for ""commercial drivers"".    He claims speeding tickets can be dismissed not on merit but on jurisdiction (basically, the cop never had the authority to pull you over for speeding because speeding is a civil matter, and (mumble mumble mumble) something about not being able to turn the lights on the top of their car unless it's a real emergency, and speeding does not qualify as a real emergency, so you can actually sue the cop under some law about driving around with emergency lights on when there's no emergency.  Or something.  Because 'Merica.  Anyway, last week on the show there was a guy who said he followed the whole script, got pulled over for doing 50 in a 35, but the cop had no business pulling him over.  Doesn't have a license, insurance, registration, yada yada.  Radio host tells him ""ok, you're going to need to call the county court clerk and ask them to file document 123XYZ"" and the dude says ""Well, I'm currently in jail and have used my one phone call to call your show."""

I meet with him later this week and the case will apparently be partially based on contingency which is more than I ever could have hoped for. Perhaps one day you will hear about this in the news and males will be afforded the same protection against infant genital mutilation as females, wish me luck.   Yeah, the ninth circuit totally takes random cases before one of its district courts weighs in. That would definitely be a lawyer's first move."

Based on the numerous details he gives about the case, I wouldn't be surprised if someone involved in the case is able to connect OP to these posts and have these statements entered as evidence.  For some reason, people think that making a throwaway account make them completely anonymous.      The statements he's making are making him look AWFUL.  Seriously, many of the criminal posts on /r/legaladvice should just be   Q: ""I was charged with this crime, what should I do?""  A: ""Sounds serious.  Hire a lawyer.""  Instead, he goes into depth and says a series of incriminating things."
bestoflegaladvice,35icnv,newprofile15,52,Sun May 10 19:08:28 2015 UTC,"As an interesting aside, while I was working as a paralegal we had a statutory rape defendant client who came in for the consult, signed, and put down a retainer. Two hours later a thread popped up in /r/legaladvice with a throwaway that was clearly him, admitting to all of the charges and asking whether the advice that he'd received in his consult was good advice.   That was a fun day at the office. And since then it's been constantly in the back of my mind that if I were a police investigator, I would always keep an eye on this forum."

bestoflegaladvice,35icnv,akbort,26,Sun May 10 20:51:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah this post was post pretty sad. The only thing that's excusable (IMO and several medical professionals I've spoken with) is the addiction itself and not the actions that result from the addiction. With that said some people in that thread are being pretty harsh calling him selfish and such. Of course he's selfish, he's a fucking heroin addict. His mid brain is telling him he needs heroin to continue to live. The same part of his brain that tells him to get food or water or to get the hell away from a carniverous animal on the plains. Or at least there's solid research that gives evidence for that.   Again, we shouldn't baby addicts when they do shitty things. But people tend to have a really hard time relaying empathy in these situations. They seem to act under the assumption that the addict is acting with the same rational reasoning that non addicts hold. It's a pretty interesting dynamic of human beings when you compare it to how empathetic people can be in other situations. Anyways I expect some dissenting opinions on this spiel of mine but that's how I see it.   Edited for punctuation"
bestoflegaladvice,35icnv,34786t234890,25,Sun May 10 21:25:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I want to agree with you, I do agree with you. But he literally killed somebody. Now he's sitting in that thread rationalizing how none of this is his fault and he shouldn't be held responsible."
bestoflegaladvice,35icnv,akbort,15,Mon May 11 00:08:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's a very tricky situation. I'll admit that I didn't read the whole thread because I kept getting the urge to comment and get involved and I didn't want to come off as morally defending the guy's actions. Because I'm not. I certainly don't feel that he should be given a break of any sort. One could argue (and I wouldn't) that because she consented to him shooting her up then he isn't 100% at fault but that's irrelevant because as I understand the law he is at fault. There's little point in debating the meaning of carefully worded laws.   From what I could tell he feels an injustice has been done to him because the detective recorded the conversation. Again not worth debating as the officer was within his rights (and again AFAIK).   I also hold my own level of bias because I'm a newly recovering alcoholic and I have many friends who are heroin addicts who are great people. So if you don't agree with me then I don't think that should be taken as you not giving a single shit about addicts either. It's all kind of spectrum based.   I guess I was mostly commenting on the fact that people tend to assume that he is acting from the same frame of reference as themselves, so he seems totally selfish and insane. Which I certainly did in regards to other addicts before I determined myself to be alcoholic. Sorry I'm rambling but it's also arguable that his brain can't allow him to feel at fault because it would just be too much in terms of grief and hating himself. Denial is a powerful thing and plays a role in survival and maintenance of mental health.   edited to add a couple details"
bestoflegaladvice,35icnv,Zyom,6,Mon May 11 00:22:32 2015 UTC,"Ya, especially when he kept saying stuff like ""she would've probably died anyways even if I wasn't there"". As if something that possibility could have happened excuses his actions and makes him not guilty in court."

bestoflegaladvice,35icnv,akbort,8,Sun May 10 23:53:27 2015 UTC,Yeah the only one I can think of that's of a similar vein as this one is the one where the guy asked if disclosing to the court system that his soon-to-be ex wife is a rape victim will help him get custody of his kids. Then he kept talking and it just got worse and worse. Just in terms of it not being very funny imagining that guy being involved in those kids' upbringing.

There is a component of that, sure, but it also features the most interesting posts. I think you were highlighted because your glorious misunderstanding of the legal system is both naive and worrying.   In fact I would say most of us just worry for you. You aren't the plucky hero, the government isn't an evil empire, and the courtroom isn't some grand arena (apologies to Serenity/Firefly). I understand wanting to stick it to the man, but there is literally nothing you can do that isn't going to stick it to you worse. A drug crime and jail time in your background check is going to disqualify you from a large number of employment opportunities. That may not mean much now, but I'm willing to bet you have a lot of life left ahead of you. Don't intentionally screw over 'future-you' (screw that guy, he spends all my money!) to take a meaningless stand. Also, drug convictions can bar you from receiving financial aid for college as well, so you're really limiting your future choices to make a point that no one will notice or care about.   Get a P.D., fight to get the charges reduced if possible, or for a diversion/probation/treatment program instead of conviction. You've reached an age where your decisions can and will impact the rest of your life and you won't always know what those decisions and their impacts are ahead of time. Try always to make the very best decisions that you can. Sometimes that means preserving as many options as possible for the future (like job prospects), and sometimes it even means taking advice you don't want to hear from people who have been there and done that (or at least seen it happen).  edit: autocorrect likes to make my ""if""s ""of""s."

bestoflegaladvice,35d37c,placebo_addicted,8,Sat May 9 20:53:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not being contrarian - I don't see what is funny about that. Marijuana is legal in some places, and next-to-legal in most others. He's under 18. His moral culpability for trying to sell some weed, relative to a guy robbing people with a firearm, is pretty fucking low.  Robbing someone at gunpoint is an extremely serious and inherently dangerous offence. In my country, you'd get 5 years minimum on your first go for that.   I don't really get what's humorous about a kid under 18 getting ripped off at gunpoint and wanting the cops to look into it. If the kid had been shot to death over the drugs, it'd still have been awful, regardless of what he was doing when it happened."
bestoflegaladvice,35d37c,terroristambulance,37,Sat May 9 17:29:08 2015 UTC,"I think you are missing the point. No one thinks the kid deserved to be held at gunpoint, only that he shouldn't think his own crime is reduced in severity because that happened. Somehow he has it in his head that, because what his assailant did is worse, he's off the hook, and it just doesn't work like that. Not only that, but Arizona is a fairly sparsely populated place. If OP ends up in prison, he's likely to run into his assailant during his visit. He should have talked to an attorney. He obviously has no idea how the world runs."

bestoflegaladvice,35d37c,Sayting,-24,Sat May 9 19:49:38 2015 UTC,"The point is that people who commit crimes can also be the victims of violence too - and usually are, at a higher rate than people who scrupulously follow the law. It doesn't make them less worthy of equal protection.   The idea that the OP will get away totally free for admitting that he's a drug trafficker to the police is a bit naive, but not really that funny, especially when what we're talking about is a minor getting ripped off by a guy with a gun. That's a serious and frightening crime, especially compared to the pretty pastoral ""selling a couple hundred bucks worth of weed""  I feel like I should draw you a picture or something, you seem to really be struggling with this"
bestoflegaladvice,35d37c,ios_k,20,Sat May 9 19:53:56 2015 UTC,"The illustration that is needed is one of OP calling an attorney to develop a plan for reporting the crime against him without further incriminating himself. Your felony doesn't go away because someone committed a crime against you. They are separate. Absolutely, the guy with the gun should be in jail, but that has nothing to do with OP's crime.

bestoflegaladvice,35d37c,terroristambulance,16,Sun May 10 02:05:09 2015 UTC,"What happened to him is an occupational hazard for illegal drug dealers that he was not prepared for.  The entire situation could have been avoided if he had decided not to sell drugs.  Think about the amount of time and effort went into that sale: he had to buy the weed in bulk, package it, find a buyer, go to meet the buyer... a lot of opportunities to stop, reassess, and make a better choice.  He deserves the punishment he's getting."
bestoflegaladvice,35d37c,Jimmy__Switch,9,Sat May 9 19:40:10 2015 UTC,I'm not a lawyer but your analogy sucks. The kid was doing illegal stuff and the woman was not. Apples and oranges dude.
bestoflegaladvice,35d37c,terroristambulance,-3,Mon May 11 04:04:49 2015 UTC,"So it's okay to blame the victim if they are doing something illegal?  Like if you jaywalk and I run you down, that's totes your fault cuz you were asking for it?"
bestoflegaladvice,35d37c,Ramady,5,Mon May 11 04:24:05 2015 UTC,"That's also a bad analogy. He in the course of an committing illegal act was himself the victim of an illegal act. He has the ability to report the criminal act of his assailant to police but is incredibly stupid because the recourse he would receive from the law is far less the punishment for the illegal act he committed and as such he should have reassessed his business plan if he had no way to prevent himself from being in this lose, lose situation  I also think the OP here is being unfair on the victim because he seems, as I previously mentioned, incredibly stupid."

bestoflegaladvice,35c1wg,Anon3mous1,12,Mon May 11 17:38:04 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the logic was sound. If the cop hadn't seen him take a swig he likely wouldn't have looked twice at the guy. The same couldn't be said if it was a brown paper bag. Though really if you must drink beer in public because you're just that classy put it into a soda bottle or something. Instead of hiding that you're drinking anything at all be as obvious as you would be with drinking something legal, the misdirection should be what you're drinking not that you're drinking.  Again, if you simply must drink in public, better to just not do it."

The comment where someone says the wife will live off of the child support once the alimony stops. That ruffles my feathers. I cannot tell you how vital the child support my mother received was to us. And she didn't receive a lot because they had joint custody. But those $250 dollars every money at various points: kept food on the table, fixed the A/C during a heat wave, bought me new clothes when I grew several inches one summer, and made sure that my mother's home would never be an unstable one for me. What do these people mean when they say the wife will ""live off"" of the child support check? Do they mean that she'll keep the lights on with it? Because good. That's what it's for. But if they think all child support is spent on fur coats and caviar they can fuck off."

bestoflegaladvice,357wm5,poffin,-8,Tue May 12 05:24:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, but there's some people who are perfectly content to live below the poverty line as long as they don't have to work.  I was on twitter the other day and came across someone's profile - she posts publicly about loving child support days because she can get weed and beer with the money.  She also posts about how she'd love to break her sons legs and how she wants to turn her daughters into lesbians because ""it's cool.""  She's not living off it, but she's not using it for the kids either (she has public assistance for that.)   OP may be worried about his wife doing something like that.  I will add though, as a child who's mother raised her with no child support from a multimillionaire father, that extra 100 or so dollars a month would've really helped.  And I am NOT saying all mothers are like this...I'm sure it's the minority...I just can kinda understand where OP is coming from."

bestoflegaladvice,352hle,euchrid3,-55,Wed May 6 23:39:59 2015 UTC,"I would actually like to hear her side of the story ...   If it was EXACTLY like the OP described it I'm quite conflicted about this. A simple ""I'm sorry, I'm not in the mood anymore, could you please call me a Taxi"" woulda made all the difference here. Sure, he may be a scumbag for continuing when she ""wasn't into it"" but that might've just as well been her being shy, worried about what he'll think of her if she just outright sleeps with him, etc ...   The part about taking away the phone. It doesnt sound like ""I took away her phone and put it somewhere she couldnt reach it"". It sounds like ""I was with this girl but she kept playing on her phone so I gently took it from her hands and put it on the table in front of her"". There are girls who go on dates with guys but just end up on the phone the whole time, we all know the stories ... Again, nothing inherently wrong with it.   If a girl were to tell me she wants to hook up with me, then behaves in a way that I dont completely understand (again, there isnt just one possible explanation for her behaviour as detailed by OP) then I expect her to clearly express herself that she doesnt want to sleep with me anymore. Is a simple ""Stop!"" or ""No!"" really this much to ask?"
bestoflegaladvice,352hle,BhiQ,96,Thu May 7 13:25:26 2015 UTC,"The problem is, she DID ask to leave and was reminded about her ""promise"".   She starts talking about how she needs to leave when the movies starts.   I've gone on dates with girls who are on their phone and I interpret it as a pretty clear sign they're not really into me or what we're doing. I would NEVER take a girls phone away just as I would never take her car keys away if she's fiddling with them. If I'm with a girl on her phone I'll stop talking and pull out my own phone. It becomes pretty clear by her reaction if she's just obsessed or is really not interested and it's not threatening at all.   Is a simple ""Stop!"" or ""No!"" really this much to ask?   She was in his place alone acting uncomfortable. She had no way to get home and no way to call or text someone. She asked to leave, he said no. He takes her only means of communication (even though it doesn't work). She clearly felt unsafe not due to circumstances beyond his control but the exact opposite. She felt unsafe due to actions taken by him.  I've brought girls home on a first date and take every precaution to ensure they feel safe. I insist on adding them on Facebook, I make sure they drive to my place separately so they have their car there, I stop the drinking if there's any pretty quick so they can drive home, and stop everything if they act at all uncomfortable. If they act uncomfortable once then I don't initiate anything after that (if she seems uncomfortable with the situation as a whole and not with the pace then I'll ask if she wants to go). All initiations at that point have to come from her. Hell, if she's at my place and she's on her phone I don't even pull mine out like I would if we were out."
bestoflegaladvice,352hle,impy695,41,Thu May 7 14:09:51 2015 UTC,"Sometimes, yes it is. Many women operate under the assumption that the man that they're with could turn violent at any time, especially in sexual situations. They're socialised to believe that sex is something that they owe men, whether they want to go through with it or not. Plenty of things that might seem innocuous to the man can easily be read as a threat or a demand by the woman. If you put her in a situation where she feels threatened or in danger, or like she has no choice in the matter, WHETHER YOU MEAN TO OR NOT, it's rape.  I've been in sexual situations with a girl who froze up, or became non-responsive, or seemed like she didn't want to be there, and you know what I did? Stopped. If she doesn't seem enthusiastic about what's happening, stop. It's that simple."
bestoflegaladvice,352hle,euchrid3,69,Fri May 8 01:32:25 2015 UTC,"A simple ""I'm sorry, I'm not in the mood anymore, could you please call me a Taxi"" woulda made all the difference here.    It absolutely would not have.  OP's original post (which he has edited to make himself look a little less rapey) said, and I quote:   ""She said she wanted to leave, but I reminded her she promised sex and couldn't leave (she was at my place without transportation to get away).""   He also mentioned she didn't have cell reception, so she couldn't call anyone to come get her."
bestoflegaladvice,352hle,_andsoitgoes_,-56,Thu May 7 17:58:18 2015 UTC,"I've told friends a hundred times that I wanted to leave when I got bored. Not once did I actually go when things started getting more interesting.   She seemed quite firm in her interest to sleep with him. Why cant she make it equally clear that this has changed?   If she isn't making it clear (aka verbal - you know, instead of telling him everything is alright) that she doesnt want to sleep with him anymore then, I'm sorry, I don't think she has the right to accuse him of rape.  Compare it to something that isn't rape:   Scenario: I'm out with a friend, we're close to his home, I tell him I'm hungry he offers me frozen pizza at his place. We go to his place and I ask if he's going to make the pizza. He tells me ""You should probably leave"". ""Alright, I'll just get the pizza first, ok?"". He smiles and seems okay with it. I'm a little confused but proceed to make the pizza for myself. He's present the whole time and doesnt complain about me making the pizza. After I eat the pizza I leave. When I get home the police are waiting for me to arrest me for robbing pizza from him.  Does this story make sense? Not to me. Please tell me why this is different from the rape? Her signals were ambiguous at least. Someone who is getting raped doesn't send ambiguous signals. Getting raped is awful. There's no way for him to misinterpret the reaction that I or any sane person would give when being raped with ""She seemed into it"".   Of course, his testimony might be off. Which is why I would like to hear hers. But if it played out the way that OP portrayed it then he may be guilty of not being the most chivalrous gentlemen in the world but not rape."

But was their response ""sorry, you can't leave until you have sex with me?"".  She literally had NO WAY to leave.  He was refusing to take her home, and her phone had no reception.  Also, I'm ignoring the rest of your ridiculous post trying to justify a rapist's actions.  The situations are apples and oranges, eating someone's food without their consent is not the same as putting your penis in them without consent.  You have to exercise more care and diligence when trying to have sex with someone than you do with making pizza."
bestoflegaladvice,352hle,_andsoitgoes_,-37,Thu May 7 18:58:43 2015 UTC,"But was their response ""sorry, you can't leave until you have sex with me?"".    I'm going to ignore that this is not what OP said - he just reminded her that she wanted to have sex earlier, probably expecting confirmation or rejection of which she provided neither.  Obviously that's not what they would say, but if I had said earlier that I was gonna do something with them (let's say playing video games because that's realistic for my situation), they remind me of it, then I make it clear that I'm not interested in it anymore. What I don't do is sitting down with them, playing with them hesitantly, then pretending I have fun only to resent them later for ""forcing me"" to play with them. If I dont have cell phone reception I ask to use the land line to call a friend/taxi to come and get me.   I think the question that decides if it was rape or not is what he would have responded to a clear statement. To me it doesn't sound like OP would have said no if she had said something like ""Sorry, I'm not in the mood anymore, could I use your land line?"". Even if she is already thinking that she is trapped she could STILL excuse herself to the toilet and do exactly what she did after the ""rape"" - running to the neighbors.   I mean come on, who actually asks for consent more than once? I can't imagine a bigger mood killer than repeatedly asking ""Is it still okay if I put my penis into you later?"". What the fuck would he have meant by asking her if she is ok if not that??  And it's not about the pizza it's about consent. Which was given, then confirmed (smiling, telling him ""she's ok"", laughing with him,...).  Again this is only if it happend exactly the way OP portrayed it."

I'm going to ignore that this is not what OP said - he just reminded her that she wanted to have sex earlier, probably expecting confirmation or rejection of which she provided neither.

bestoflegaladvice,352hle,_andsoitgoes_,-37,Thu May 7 19:24:28 2015 UTC,"""sorry, you can't leave until you have sex with me?""   This actually changes things a bit but I still think it's not too hard to say no. It was a stupid thing to say but neither his further behaviour nor hers make any indication that she understood it as a threat.   Do you really believe that if she had made it clear, along the lines of ""I dont want this anymore! Please let me leave!"" he woulda kept her? From the way he describes it I'm sure he would've even driven her home if she had asked him to. Instead she tells him ""she's ok"". How the fuck is he supposed to realize that maybe she didn't understand his joke as a joke if she keeps giving him mixed signals? And yes, telling him she's ok is a mixed signal."
bestoflegaladvice,352hle,BhiQ,22,Thu May 7 19:28:35 2015 UTC,"She made it clear at least once that she wanted to leave and he refused and made what I think, if you are being unbiased, would qualify as a threat. Once the threat was made, even if she acted enthusiastic (which she did not), it's not consent. Her behavior very much suggests that she considers it a threat - what other behavior would you expect to see?  While I concede that it is possible he won't be convicted of rape (although I think he will if he gives an honest accounting of the events) and may have been in fact oblivious, it's hard to doubt the idea that the girl didn't want to have sex.  Look, I'm horrified by false rape stories that I hear all the time on reddit and it even happened to a friend of mine (even after the girl retracted his statement he had to switch colleges because his reputation was ruined). But there's a difference between this and the regret-sex or blackmail stories you hear. The girl literally ran away at her first opportunity."

Unfortunately, we live in a world of billions of people who can sometimes have misunderstandings with each other through no fault of their own.   If I'm on a date and a guy asks me, ""Are you okay?"" and I tell him ""Yeah, I'm okay"" then I do not feel that I can blame the guy for believing me.  Yes, maybe it would be nice if the guy was sensitive enough to say, ""No, you don't seem okay. Are you REALLY okay?"" or something like that - but I don't think that it is fair to put expectations on other people that they may not even be aware exist. I do not think we can blame a man for MISUNDERSTANDING that a woman didn't want to have sex in the same way that we blame a man for NOT CARING if a woman wanted to have sex with him or not."

I want to leave"".   ""I know I said online that I wanted some casual sex, but I changed my mind. Please take me home""   It's unfortunate that this woman felt she could not assert her wishes and needs in a clear and unambiguous way. However, I do not blame the man for that. It's not his fault that he misunderstood that the message she gave him before about wanting to have sex with him no longer applied.   Frankly, I think you are cheapening the seriousness of the term ""rape"" when you apply it to situations where the man had no malicious intention and did not intend to harm the woman or disregard her wishes.   The reason people think rape is such a terrible thing because most people still associate the term ""rape"" with situations where a man is forcing himself on a woman, knowing that she doesn't want sex, and yet he doesn't care that she doesn't want it. That is a cruel and horrible thing to do to someone.   Misunderstanding someone who hinted around about not wanting to have sex but never actually said no is not cruel or horrible.

At that point, saying ""no"" isn't just uncomfortable; it risks turning the situation violent.  It's not exactly a secret that most women are less physically powerful than most men, and that they are brought up being told near-constantly to defer to men. Saying ""no"" to someone who can overpower you and has been socialized to consider his desires more important than yours, and has performed several actions in a row to suggest that ""no"" isn't an answer he's interested in hearing... if you can really still suggest that saying ""no"" would be easy in such a situation, I don't know what else to say."

This is the sort of thing I had in mind elsewhere in the thread as a response to a guy who didn't get why she couldn't say ""no"" more clearly.  I get the woman's mindet (as much as I can anyway), but I'm still uneasy with the idea that an oblivious young man who doesn't understand the factors making it so hard for her to take unambiguous action instead of sending increasingly strong hints is one of the worst types of criminal. He's guilty of being self-absorbed, selfish, lacking empathy, and misreading social cues, but  if in his mind she changed her mind and ended up consenting, and he's horrified by the accusation and strongly believes he would have stopped  if she'd just said so...

I don't really like the ""teach boys not to rape"" mentality because it over-simplifies a complex issue, but this is a great example of a case where it's perfectly accurate - with better sex education, particularly emphasizing the need for enthusiastic consent, this guy might not have ""accidentally"" committed rape.  On the other hand, we only have his side of the story, and obviously he wouldn't want to portray himself as the bad guy. Should we automatically assume that he was being intentionally threatening? Absolutely not. Should we also take it at face value that he was genuinely oblivious to her discomfort and all of this was a misunderstanding? I'm going to stick with a healthy dose of skepticism there.

I froze up said nothing , did nothing even though i wanted to say no so bad I couldn't get the words come out, he didn't ask and just assumed I wanted to have sex with him.

I unlike this girl didn't go to the cops cause the thought of ruining someone else's life killed me. Sorry not everyone gets how bad anxiety can effect people he should of asked and just took her home when she said she wanted to. also I'm glad everyone seems to be on her side make me feel better about what happened to me as the guy still see's it as i made it up or just 'changed my mind'. he even turned my own sister on me."

The incident which affected me the worst, I completely and utterly froze, I was outside my body. Later he chided me for not being into it, since that made him feel bad. But he had literally just done the same actions as had been done by an uncle when I was 5. Completely suddenly, no lead into it, or asking me, or anything. I physically and mentally shut down entirely.  I had just gotten over the idea it was my fault for what happened when I was a kid, since I didn't scream or run. He was my first bf I did anything physical with. I was so angry with myself, blamed myself for doing it again. I guess I was finally able to give child-me a break but not the self I was then... Since I didn't run, I felt (and still feel) like I can't really call it rape. (Plus it was, er, not penis/vagina but I still consider it sex? I don't want to be too explicit. I don't really know if that ""counts."")

bestoflegaladvice,352hle,theladybaelish,50,Wed May 6 20:05:41 2015 UTC,"I kept thinking about a situation I was in years ago when I read this post. It was with a lady I dated briefly. We met online, went out to dinner, had a good time, and she invited me to hang out with her at her house. We were watching a movie and drinking beer and making out. I was under the impression she invited me over to have sex, and I was being fairly aggressive moving things toward where I thought the night was heading. At a certain point, she said, ""I feel like you're not respecting my boundaries right now"". And I'm glad she did. I immediately apologized and explained I thought she wanted to do it when she invited me over. I asked her if she wanted me to leave, she told me to stay and she wanted to hang out and make out, but no more. So we did.  She must not have been too put off by that night because we dated a few weeks longer and ended up having sex two nights later. She was one of those girls who felt it was un-ladylike to have sex before the third date - she told me this herself, later.  There's not really a point to this story, except I kept thinking about it while I read the linked post. I wonder what might have happened if my date hadn't felt comfortable telling me she felt I wasn't respecting her boundaries, or if she was too scared to say no, would I have picked up on it and stopped? I'd like to think so.  We broke up on good terms a few weeks after that, and about a month after the breakup I was chatting with her on Facebook and I flat-out asked her, wasn't she scared I was going to rape her that night? We were all alone, she'd only known me maybe a week. I was much bigger than her (I was 6'5"", 280 lbs at the time) and could easily overpower her even if she did physically resist me. She just told me she didn't get that kind of vibe from me or she never would have invited me back to her house. I asked her if she felt like I was being too aggressive that night. I don't remember exactly what she said, but the gist of it was, ""Guys get dumb when they're horny. You seemed like a nice guy.""  I'll always remember that as the night I could have raped someone. It really changed my ideas of what I thought rape was and what it looked like. She took a calculated risk when she told me she felt I wasn't respecting her boundaries. If she had misjudged me I could have seriously hurt her (for all she knew). And once she said it I immediately realized that she had been telling me so in more subtle ways for the last few minutes. As I was reading the linked post, I couldn't help but wonder... if she'd gotten scared that I was going to have my way no matter what and decided to just clam up and take it out of fear that I'd hurt her if she didn't, would I have picked up on it and asked her if she was okay and if she wanted to stop? I'd certainly like to think so, but you can never know for sure."

I'd like to think so.   And if you didn't pick up on that hint, would that have made you a violent, dangerous sexual predator? Or just a naive, dumb guy who didn't pick up on a hint?   I would argue that this kind of case is the latter. There's a big difference between a man who doesn't CARE if a woman says no and will hurt her to get what he wants regardless, and a man who simply doesn't pick up on the hint, IMO.   (And I am a woman, for the record, so of course I don't condone rape)."
bestoflegaladvice,352hle,ohplease3,19,Sat May 9 21:35:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think it counts as ""not picking up on a hint"" when the girl asks to leave, is actively using her phone rather than engaging with you, is not into it when you make out, and you feel the need to ask if she's OK multiple times during foreplay/sex.   (All of those come from the OP. I've never been asked more than once if I was into sex, so the fact that OP felt the need to ask multiple times says a lot about how the girl was acting).  Any single one of those things could be a signal you could miss. All of them together? That's either someone who is literally socially disabled in some way (to the point where they need intervention), or someone who plain doesn't care about the woman he's with."

He naively continued all the way to sex when he could tell she wasn't into it to the extent he kept asking if she was alright.   And that's not even to mention how he naively set up the scene in the first place- taking her back to his apartment, which he knew had poor enough phone signal that she couldn't call for a ride if she needed to.

He just sounds like a young and naive guy who is not savvy about the current political climate.  I think there is a big difference between a man who is completely aware that a woman is telling him NO and doesn't care that she doesn't want to have sex with him, in contrast to a guy who is clueless about the indirect hints a woman is giving him and doesn't understand that she doesn't want to have sex with him.   If this guy really did realize that he forced himself on someone who didn't want to have sex, do you really think he would have posted here? He apparently honestly thought she wanted to have sex with him. I can see how he got that impression since apparently she had told him online she was interested in casual sex. Yes, someone who was more savvy and mature may have picked up on the fact that she was uncomfortable and would not have tried to push the boundaries, but being a naive and horny young man should not mean your life is ruined by being branded a violent offender IMO."

He clearly sees the signals, but is under some impression that as long as she doesn't vocalise the word 'stop' or 'no' then she is consenting.  I literally do not understand how you can read a post where OP explicitly describes the signals that show she wasn't into it, and still claim that OP was missing these signals. You could claim he didn't give enough weight to the signals, but that doesn't mean he didn't see them.   Heck, even if you claim he isn't a rapist, he's a fucking creep for continuing to shag a girl who wasn't enjoying it (and we know she wasn't enjoying it because even in OP's inevitably-biased description he kept having to ask if she was OK). Even if it wasn't rape- and I unequivocally think it was- it is behaviour that the OP should be condemned for and stopped from pursuing in future."

Like I said, I most definitely had someone take someone I was fiddling with away from me, then proceed to make out with me. I knew exactly what he was trying to get across when he said it. I think it is unfortunate for him that it was a phone because it's making all of you think he was trying to trap her there. You may be right about the not believing she was happy to be there, but that's why he was asking if she was ok.  But isn't mens rea important here? This isn't a statutory crime. The girl was on top for pete's sake. Look my experiences are limited, I'd never get in this situation cause I didn't do casual sex. So maybe that's why I'm trying to be a devil's advocate"
bestoflegaladvice,352hle,carboncle,47,Wed May 6 23:42:29 2015 UTC,"And the fact that he kept having to ask doesn't indicate anything to you? If you're repeatedly unsure if someone is OK, throughout the majority of the encounter, I think most well-adjusted people know to take a step back.  Like I said, I believe he's confused about her consent, and what constituted consent from her in a technical sense. I don't think he was at all confused about her enthusiasm. His real problem was thinking that it was OK to have one without the other, and I think if he hadn't gone in thinking that she'd somehow promised him sex and he was therefore entitled to it, he wouldn't have made that mistake.  But hey, maybe he's genuinely that dense, in which case this is all really sad. But I refuse to believe that this is some honest mistake that could happen to anyone."
bestoflegaladvice,352hle,Anonymoose15,-43,Thu May 7 00:05:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think he felt entitled to it. If she had said no he would have stopped, at least he said in the comments"
bestoflegaladvice,352hle,alynnidalar,36,Thu May 7 00:36:38 2015 UTC,"But she did say no. No, she didn't specifically say the word ""no"", but you should not actually have to say ""no"" for your partner to realize that you're not OK with it. Literally everything OP said about her actions indicates that she was not OK with the situation.  Not saying ""no"" or not resisting physically does not constitute consent. OP may not have understood this at the time, but he should have. The onus of responsibility is on him for failing to recognize that she hadn't given consent."
bestoflegaladvice,352hle,oneonetwooneonetwo,16,Thu May 7 02:08:26 2015 UTC,"For example, her actions afterward are consistent with someone who was putting up with it until they could escape and call the police. Rape victims have been by questioned by sceptics for not reacting in the exact way this woman did, i.e. why didn't you leave immediately and why did you take so long to contact the police.   This is how even men's rights activists think women ought to react to being raped."
bestoflegaladvice,352hle,Anonymoose15,-45,Thu May 7 22:47:27 2015 UTC,"And I think that's the impasse. I think many people think an honest mistake can happen. There seems to be this HUGE resistance to people admitting false rape claims happen a little more often than pop statistics say. I'll say this, he probably should have taken her home when she said she wanted to leave. My thought is this though. What do you think she would have said if he asked her if she wanted to have sex? I'm actually unsure if she would have said no (caveats being this is from his side of the story, also I don't think it would have been an enthusiastic yes)"

bestoflegaladvice,352hle,always-confused,20,Thu May 7 05:39:59 2015 UTC,"Are you doubting that it would qualify as rape because she didn't make it clear enough she didn't want to have sex or are you doubting that she didn't want to have sex? She literally ran out of there as soon as possible and went to a stranger's place. This isn't one of your regret-sex stories, the girl very obviously did not want to have sex.    The girl was on top for pete's sake   ""The girl was on top"" is obviously not a very good defense. Switching to a position where it is easier to get away does not make it not rape if the girl does not attempt to run away. Does that not make sense to you?  The guy seems really bad at reading people in general or just didn't care, you can tell from his biased description that the girl was totally uninterested in him. On her phone the entire time and asking to leave early?"

(and it was the first time with a new partner, which as you note, decent people are more careful with and more explicit) You note the people who are talking about freezing up entirely are extremely conflicted at naming it rape, and did not report.  In NO state are you required to actually say the verbal phrase ""No"" with no other way of stating non consent valid. For one extremely obvious example, there are rapes of unconscious people, for another, rapes of those who do not speak English, who indicate ""no"" in some other verbal word... ""I need to leave"" is clear verbal indication of lack of consent."

Everybody does this.   For some reason when it comes to sex people try to require this extremely technical checkbox version of refusal, when in any other situation a socially aware person would get what was going on. Just because these two people were communicating less directly than a poorly-written textbook doesn't mean they weren't communicating with each other, and using pretty common social signals to boot. I'm not sure why you're being obtuse about it (maybe just to help with your devil's advocacy?).  I'm sure there was some level of genuine miscommunication here, but by the end of his post it rises to the level of serious (possibly deliberate) denial.

I move in to make out with her. She isn't into it at first. I ask her if she is ok. She says she is ok. She fiddles with her phone a bit (reception is really bad in my apartment/area). I gently take it from her and put it down. She seems ok with this. She smiles. I move in and try to start things again. She is into it.   Of course all this could be made up or skewed in OP's favor, but there is a possible interpretation where she is at least implying consent and lets not forget that in reality, implied consent is by far the most common form, although I really doubt it.

Not a good comparison with psychopathy though...

There does not seem to be an easy answer."
bestoflegaladvice,35080a,P-01S,22,Wed May 6 08:30:14 2015 UTC,"Sociopathy is fascinating and scary. Legally, it seems relatively cut-and-dry; sociopaths understand the concepts of right and wrong, and IANAL, but I'm under the impression that that's the part that matters to the legal system, the ability to understand that they did something wrong (or at least illegal). Sociopaths understand the consequences of their actions, but they also believe that they deserve to escape those consequences, or that those consequences shouldn't apply to them because they're capable of rationalizing everything they do really, really well. Essentially, one way or another, they think that they should be able to ""get away with it""-- which is probably what most people who commit crimes think. And though the conviction that they're exempt from conviction (dohoho puns) is far more pervasive and deep-seated in sociopaths than in others, it's still just essentially a trait that exists in basically everyone, magnified to an ugly extreme.   So if you declared sociopaths legally incompetent, you'd also have to consider the competence of other folks who think they deserve to be above the law-- you'd have to debate whether you could even have a trial for people with ""affluenza,"" for example (as opposed to now, when it's just sorta possible to use it as a really, really dumb defense). And the legal system does not have the time or resources to devote to establishing whether any given rich kid is entitled to the point of being disordered, or just entitled within normal limits, any more than it could consider whether or not someone is self-centered enough to be considered a sociopath or just a really self-centered person, before they can even go to trial!   Personality disorders are just... upsetting, in general. What the hell do you do for someone with a disorder characterized by the fact that it's nearly impossible to convince them that they do in fact have a disorder? And when a disorder is just made of normal (if unpleasant) aspects of human behavior, how do you determine how bad it has to be for someone to be really disordered and not just a miserable but mentally healthy person? (Granted, ""how bad does it have to be to qualify as a disorder"" is a tricky enough question for any mental disorder; but personality disorders are particularly problematic in that regard.) They're difficult to diagnose and study, difficult to treat, difficult to think about in general-- and that means it'd be even more difficult to do anything with them legally. (IANAL tho, nor am I a psychologist; so take everything I say with a grain of salt.)"
bestoflegaladvice,35080a,AccountMitosis,4,Wed May 6 17:27:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, legally it is clear that they are legally considered mentally competent.   sociopaths understand the concepts of right and wrong   Isn't it that they understand that the concepts exist, but they don't internalize them?  Looking through the OP's (really, really damning) post history, they seem  absolutely convinced that they are not the problem, or that their actions don't warrant punishment, or that their actions do warrant consequences that are avoidable through morally bankrupt means, and that said means do not warrant consequences despite being told that they are morally wrong and illegal... It's one big self-contradictory clusterfuck. They repeatedly agree with part of what commentors tell them in what seem to be attempts to convince people that they are listening; then they attack from a different angle.   What the hell do you do for someone with a disorder characterized by the fact that it's nearly impossible to convince them that they do in fact have a disorder?   The only things that can be done are leave them be or strip them of their rights as a person and put them in a mental hospital. Neither seems a good solution. If OP were required to seek treatment, they would likely try to extort and lie their way out of it..."
bestoflegaladvice,35080a,neonKow,17,Wed May 6 17:48:02 2015 UTC,"What you're seeing in the OP's post history is rationalization-- essentially, the brain's reflexive attempt to bring conflicting information, like ""I did a certain action"" and ""a certain action is wrong/forbidden/punished/likely to result in unpleasant consequences,"" into harmony. Sociopaths are really, really good at rationalizing. Every human being rationalizes, but sociopaths turn it into an art form and a way of life; rationalizing is as natural to them as breathing.   This rationalization is what makes OP appear to not understand the whole actions -> consequences thing. I bet that if you sat him down and listed all the actions he's taken in general terms, without identifying them as his actions, and asked what the consequences of those actions are, he could tell you perfectly clearly. But if you then say that because he did those things, then he must suffer those consequences, THAT'S where he just can't handle it and breaks down into a pile of excuses. And he is so very good at rationalizing that the logic will just never get through (well, never say ""never,"" but in OP's case I think it's viable to say ""never without treatment, and probably almost never even then""). And this pattern has been reinforced his entire life because of his natural sociopathic charisma; he fucks up, he convinces others to accept his rationalizations, he escapes consequences because people just don't give enough of a shit to deal with him, he now believes even harder that he's special and deserves to get out of consequences. It's actually interesting to see how ridiculous sociopaths can look in text, with their rationalizations stripped of shielding through authoritative voices and winsome pleading looks, because this shit actually works in their everyday personal interactions.   The only things that can be done are leave them be or strip them of their rights as a person and put them in a mental hospital.   Well, this isn't entirely true. Counseling can have some limited effectiveness, depending on how able they are to come to terms with the idea that they actually have a problem that needs fixing (prognosis looks pretty dim for OP in that regard, tho); and interpersonal counseling such as family counseling can help others who are stuck with the patient to figure out how to cope, if nothing else. Medications can ease the symptoms in some cases. When a personality disorder resembles another disorder, meds for the disorder it resembles can help with the personality disorder; for example, anxiety meds that work for OCD might also work for obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, and anti-psychotics could work for paranoid or schizotypal personality disorders. And mood-regulating drugs like SSRIs might work to a limited extent for some, like for histrionic personality disorder.   When it comes to sociopathy particularly, harsh legal penalties can actually be a pretty effective way of deterring its sufferers from crime. Or at least visible, serious crime that's likely to be detected and punished. Sociopaths are impulsive and risk-seeking, but generally avoid huge risks-- otherwise the world would be full of dead sociopaths who risked their lives on small chances. But it isn't! It's full of RICH sociopaths. They've taken risks like investing in businesses and running for office, which involve risking things like money instead of life or years of freedom; much more appealing than crime! By punishing some behaviors and allowing others, you can manage how risky and how rewarding those behaviors are, and essentially ""treat"" a society's sociopaths by presenting legal (and ideally even moral) behavior as the most desirable choice. Of course, many of these folks are rich through legal but morally bankrupt means; but at least that amount of restraint is better than nothing.  The key is that the laws have to be extremely consistent and consistently applied: if a sociopath can avoid legal consequences by becoming a politician, he will do so; if he can get rich enough that he can buy leniency with money and connections, he will; if he finds any loophole anywhere, he will take it, no matter how difficult or unpleasant, because he will want to escape the consequences that badly and believe that he deserves nothing less. So laws must be designed and enforced such that following them is the only way to avoid being punished for breaking them, so they will stick equally to both average people (who would generally follow them anyway) and to sociopaths (who would generally not). Obviously that's not how things are right now, but we're not doing super-terribly either, given the possibilities, and all the complicating factors, like figuring out how to deal with actual exceptions to the law without making those exceptions into loopholes that sociopaths can slip through, and doing it all without fucking too many people over in the end.   tl;dr IANAL(nor a psychologist, yet), but it seems to me that legal punishment for sociopaths is entirely appropriate, because it is an at-least-somewhat effective way to get the idea of consequences for everyone, even them, through their brains' defensive walls of rationalization."

Until then, as ugly as deterrents are in comparison to rehabilitation, they'll be necessary.   Still, I long for a day when we'll be able to fix everyone's mental problems, and have the discernment to understand the nature of every problem and what isn't a problem at all, and still have the prudence to change only what is necessary and not abuse the power to change the minds of others.   Given that not long ago, society attempted to ""fix"" women who expressed a desire to work outside the home, and even now some people attempt to ""fix"" homosexuality, I feel like such prudence is even further off than having the ability to change people so drastically-- but we must have that wisdom, before we can start messing with people's minds in good conscience. Personality disorders make it nearly impossible to tell where the disorder ends and the person begins; if we can't even get over the idea that people can be gay without being disordered, how on earth are we supposed to exercise a much greater degree of precision when it comes to figuring out what part of a person is disorder, what part is personality, and what part is choice?   Someday, we'll probably be able to treat personality disorders effectively, and maybe even ethically. Until then, though, the best we can do is to try to make the laws as effective, as moral, as good as they can possibly be; apply the law as rigorously and honestly as possible; and let people make their choices in that light."

Unfortunately, with sociopaths in general, that sort of advice tends to bounce right off instead of getting through. I hope it does get through, though. As much as I enjoy playing DRM Bingo with the guy (disclaimer: diagnoses of people on the internet via such means as DRM Bingo should never be considered more serious than a suggestion or joke, and one should always seek the opinion of a licensed professional... like the one who diagnosed OP as a sociopath), it'd give everyone a bit of hope to see that someone with such an intractable disorder can turn his act around even a little bit."

Strangely, this does not convince the doctor he does not have ASPD.   Second plan: Try to bribe the doctor's secretary.  Third plan: Steal her USB drive. Install ransomwear that will encrypt her files so you can demand she delete your diagnosis. Hand deliver the USB drive and tell her you found it somewhere.

When they wouldn't give me Adderall and instead diagnosed me with ASPD (sociopath), I started repeatedly harassing the doctor.  When repeated harassment of the psychiatrist who refused to give me drugs and instead diagnosed me with ASPD didn't work, and they basically told me to get lost, I finally decided to bribe her boss.  When even that didn't work, and the boss doctor threatened to actually report me to the university for these multiple felonies (can you imagine? the gall of some people!)

So of course, I broke in and stole the secretary's  computer equipment, infected it with a virus, and then returned it to try and commit computer sabotage against the mental health office (BTW I do NOT have a drug problem) I got caught for all of this but it's not really a big deal (although I did get expelled from school)   Mostly, I just want to make sure that I get to keep my military scholarship at the next school I go to.

I don't necessarily need him to believe that I have no personality disorder. If the records are electronic, they are subjected to the possibility of accidental deletion.

No amount of loving parenting will necessarily fix oxygen deprivation during birth killing off part of a guy's prefrontal cortex, or repeated concussions from playing sports at school, or a traumatic head injury like a piece of construction equipment rocketing through his skull (to use the most famous example). And it can be really traumatic for parents who find themselves being blamed for things that they had absolutely no control over.  Now, of course bad parenting can cause psychological issues, and usually a mental disorder-- or, really, any aspect of a person-- is the result of a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors like parenting (and some factors that are kinda fuzzy on whether they're either ""nature"" or ""nurture,"" like aspects of prenatal development); but I think it's generally better to presume the parents innocent at first."

Mild dickishness, not violence and rape!  I feel terrible for his parents, because I'm sure they blame themselves despite apparently providing a better growing environment than one can ever really expect; but ""your child was probably just born broken, it's not your fault"" is not exactly the sort of thing you can say to console anyone beyond a super-close friend.

For a while there kids were getting handed adderall like it was candy just for ""not sitting still."" It wasn't until they started trying behaviour modification first before trying drugs that the rate of actual diagnoses started to settle down and there were less kids being handed bottles of drugs and being told, ""Here, take this for the next 20 years.""

A personality disorder would be a barrier, though. They are difficult to treat and present a massive liability.  Despite what we get filtered through in media (I'm looking at you, Hannibal), people with ASPD are not that bright. A disorder requiring a prescription to amphetamines would be an obvious no-go at MEPS, but he could lie about the medicine: There's idiot move #1. There's a few medical acts that prevent the military, private sector, and the VA from sharing medical information with each other, so idiot move #2 was blowing it out of proportion. His thought process was ""I can get a waiver for ADHD, but not ASPD,"" when really he could have kept his mouth shut on both and hope it didn't catch up to him in BCT/OCS. It's still an idiot move to lie, but the sharp and dull alike are more likely to go that route. Idiot move #3 was failing to seek a second opinion on the diagnosis.  Honestly? The biggest hurdle now to his enlistment/commission is the actions he undertook. There are plain and simple ways to deal with a misdiagnosis. Even if no criminal charges are brought forth, the school may elect to expel him, and if that contract came from a ROTC program, he'll be holding the check from the US military for his scholarship for failing to uphold his end of the bargain."

I really don't think so.   I take 5mg dextroamphetamine in the evening, and about a year ago there were huge stock problems with it (at least in my area, but a pharmacist told me they were nationwide). I would regularly have to go to 5 different pharmacies to try to fill it. So my doctor started prescribing 15 10mg tablets for me each month instead of 30 5mg tablets. Then there started being a stock problem with the 10mg, and he had heard there were still issues with the 5mg, so he considered prescribing me 7 20mg tablets, but couldn't get confirmation that what they stocked was scored to be split into 4. I assume the pharmacy wouldn't tell him.   It's not like he was deciding whether I would take 10 or 70mg per day based on what the pharmacy had, he was trying to figure out what he could prescribe to get me 5mg per day that they could actually fill.   I don't think my doctor ever called the pharmacy to ask what they had, but it seems like it would have been a reasonable thing to do. Playing the prescription guessing game hoping to hit what the pharmacy had in stock was a huge hassle. Luckily I live in a city with plenty of pharmacies, so filling my prescriptions was usually just a matter of going to enough pharmacies until I could find one that had it, but not everyone lives in a city.

But after the shortage was over, the price of 360 5 mg Dexedrines went from $80 a month to like over $700. :[ So I switched to taking 180 10 mgs instead since it's cheaper.

Man, NOBODY takes Dexedrine, which blows my mind because, hell, I've been on this stuff since I was 5 and I've tried everything else in the book at different times in my life and it's always what I come back to because it's the best in terms of getting the job done and not giving me awful side effects like batshit insane heart palpitations and having to make a run to a toilet 30 minutes after taking it like Focalin did.

If there's some way of proving that he was deceived, would he really have no recourse? Isn't this effectively being forced into having a baby through deception?   Technically the father could sue the mother under a fraud theory. IDK if anyone has tried it, or what the outcome was.   Also, if it were the other way around - are women who give up paternity required to pay child support?   Yes. The child support obligation is gender neutral."

My ex MIL called them anonymously (she later admitted to my SIL that she called, but we knew it was her before that) as revenge when we wouldn't let her take our kids overnight because she's crazy. She told them stuff like we starved our oldest child, let the cats crap all over where the kids played, and for some reason that our kids used an onion as a ball (not sure what was up with that one, maybe the plastic onion from their play kitchen, but who would care about that?).   I felt violated, I felt pissed off at her, I asked if there was any recourse for a totally false report, and I was told no.

She works like 50-60 hours a week; I just hope those kids aren't being left home alone.  Meanwhile, when we were friends, every other post on facebook was either about what a great mom she is, or ""fuck the DEA"" because her Dr. won't mail her her prescriptions to her because they are amphetamines and she's on medicaid.

While some pet crematories allow owners to bring the deceased pets in themselves, it is a highly unusual practice, and I've only seen it when the crematory offers a funeral service at the same time and the owner's whole family/support system goes. The crematories that allow this are generally few and far between, charge a lot more for owner drop off, and are very flexible with their appointment times. There should be no reason to not be able to attend a pediatrician appointment to drop a pet off there.   Almost everyone who gets their pet's ashes back takes the pet's body to their vet for them to send in to the crematory. It's entirely possible that she just is one of those people who felt she needed to do it herself and see the place or watch the cremation to ensure she gets back the right pet's ashes. But after nearly 15 years working with pet cremation services regularly, her statement was specific enough to strike me as odd, as was the fact that it was the only comment she deleted."

Agencies operating under the purview of Title 11A must comply with New Jersey Department of Personnel Rules (N.J.A.C. 4A:1-1.1 et seq.). Appendix Q contains the time table used by Department of Personnel for disciplinary action. While these steps are mandatory for all Department of Personnel agencies, the time table provides a model that should be adopted by all law enforcement agencies. Every law enforcement agency shall have its entire disciplinary process specified in writing. Accepting Reports Alleging Officer Misconduct All complaints of officer misconduct shall be accepted from all persons who wish to file a complaint regardless of the hour or day of the week. This includes those from anonymous sources, juveniles and persons under arrest or in police custody. Internal Affairs personnel should accept complaints if available. If Internal Affairs is not available, supervisory personnel should accept reports of officer misconduct, and if no supervisory personnel are available, complaints should be accepted by any police officer. At no time should a complainant be told to return to file his report. Citizens should be encouraged to submit their complaints in person as soon after the incident as possible. If the complainant cannot file the report in person, a department representative should visit the individual at his or her home, place of business or other location in order to complete the report. The Internal Affairs officer, supervisor or other officer receiving the complaint will explain the department's disciplinary procedures to the person making the complaint. He should advise the complainant that they will be kept informed of the status of the complaint and its ultimate disposition. To best accomplish this, the department shall prepare a fact sheet for distribution to people who make complaints. This fact sheet should include information on the department's disciplinary process and what role the complainant can expect to play. In addition, the fact sheet shall advise the complainant that it is a criminal offense to provide statements which they do not believe to be true. The supervisor or other officer receiving the complaint shall complete the appropriate internal affairs report form. The report form should have adequate instructions for proper completion. The officer accepting the report should then have the complainant sign the completed form. http://www.state.nj.us/lps/dcj/agguide/internal.htm"

She helped me through university by giving me money, helping me pay my bills and buying me what I needed. She was a very generous and helpful woman. We skyped and exchanged photos, I know what she looks like. We wanted to get married in about a year after meeting. Recently, I learned that she lied to me about many aspects of her life. She is married, and doesn't live where she told me she lived. She lied about her job. She invented a life she never had. Problems she never had. Travels that never happened. Please note that I never gave her money or bought anything to her. She gave me money and bought me gifts on Amazon and had them delivered to my house. Two friends of hers pretended to be someone they're not as well to help my ex-girlfriend lie. I also lied to her about some aspects of my life, I dated girls while being with her. I demanded for money I didn't need. But she lied to me about a lot more. What legal actions can I take against her?   There's still a chance he's a troll. But I'd like to pretend he's not.

OP asked for a link to the VA regulations.   OP's question wasn't: How can I sue? The issue of suing was inferred by the two top-level commentors and pretty much directed the shit storm that rained down on OP.   I can see why OP was frustrated and lashed out against some of the commentors.  Notice in that post OP even thanks a commentor who actually attempted to answer the regulations question even though the comment included the snarky phrase ""knock yourself out"".  BTW the commetors link was to outdoor lighting glare and not to proper placement in parking lots.

Common sense dictates that if the OP finds some sort of arcane regulation about parking lot lighting that the first stop will be the lot owner's insurance company.  And realistically, every claims adjuster in the US will laugh at him.  This is the kind of case that an adjuster would share around the office because it is, on its face, one of the most ludicrous claims that any insurance company will see.  There is a 0% chance of an insurance company rolling over and paying the plaintiff - every single one would wish them well in court.  Every state regulation on auto claims I've ever encountered talks about the driver's duty to avoid obvious hazards.  And that's exactly what would happen here - full stop.

I have no idea where the scents are or if there even are scents in that particular course. The first thing they teach you is to not reward your dog until after they ""detect"" and to never, ever, ever indicate where you want them to go.

See, there are plenty of highly intelligent people who disagree, sometimes vehemently, with the Court's Constitutional decisions (Scalia dissents anyone? But not just him, I'm talking about practitioners, other judges, scholars etc).   But you know what? They accept that their disagreement doesn't mean they can ignore the law. Stretch it as far as they can go, maybe, as you see judges in lower courts doing when they disagree with the idea behind a Constitutional rule but the rule is vague enough to conceivably allow for whatever it is the lower court judge wants to do.   Flat out denying that the laws of the United States apply to its citizens is just goddamn stupid and is anathema to the concept of a civilized society. I think that the arguments sovereign citizens and the like make when they talk about the framers and founders and whatever are just indicative of extreme ignorance because most of the philosophical writings the framers' were heavily influenced by (e.g. John Stuart Mill, John Locke) as well as their own writings are pretty much in complete opposition to the dumb shit people say when citing the intentions of the founders etc.   Full disclosure: I don't actually know any of the philosophies of the sovereign citizen movements so I may be wrong about them being the one espousing the idiotic viewpoints above. If so, you can apply it to all the dumbass ultra political junkies who love to invoke the ""framers intent"" and make everything about the Constitution while clearly having no goddamn clue what they're talking about."

I couldn't imagine a better world than one where most people live the lifestyle I described above.   Why? Because no one looked out for me as a kid. My parents cared more about themselves than me. They divorced when I was 3. My dad was absent but available. My mom was in need of mental health services. She had to work two and three jobs so I raised myself. Naturally I got into drugs and alcohol, but only weed. Thankfully not Heroin or meth. I learned my lesson after an arrest, and have been trying to better myself as a person, husband and father ever since, with my NAP and libertarianism lifestyle as my guide. And since then, I've become a better person and that's the only reason my wife is still with me. That's called personal responsibility. That's what I preach.

bestoflegaladvice,32e9cu,marilyn_monbroseph,4,Tue Apr 14 00:15:04 2015 UTC,It had to have carried over. There seriously was a post about an emotional support armadillo. OP refers to his dog in later posts.
bestoflegaladvice,32e9cu,RemoveTheTop,5,Tue Apr 14 00:16:07 2015 UTC,is he saying he doesnt have to pay the fee because it's an emotional support animal? i'm pretty sure emotional support animals dont fall into the ADA as service animals. that'd be a psychiatric service animal.
bestoflegaladvice,32e9cu,marilyn_monbroseph,4,Tue Apr 14 01:19:56 2015 UTC,No. that was a carry over from another conversation that day where there was an emotional support armadillo.
bestoflegaladvice,32e9cu,Anonymoose15,6,Tue Apr 14 01:37:25 2015 UTC,ok good.  followup: what the fuck is an emotional support armadillo?
bestoflegaladvice,32e9cu,littlejib,6,Tue Apr 14 02:47:58 2015 UTC,"Someone (if I remember correctly) wanted an emotional support animal and ended up with ""Max"" (or something like that) and the landlord was freaking out. After /r/legaladvice ganged up and said the landlord was wrong someone noticed that the OP hadn't said what the animal was.... it was an armadillo.  I can't for the life of me find the post. I wish I archived more stuff. That should have been here."
bestoflegaladvice,32e9cu,littlejib,4,Tue Apr 14 02:53:11 2015 UTC,Cooper the Racoon is a similar story... http://www.reddit.com/r/bestoflegaladvice/comments/32olpr/the_saga_of_cooper_the_raccoon_aka_zapopa_bait/
bestoflegaladvice,32e9cu,warm_kitchenette,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:07:10 2015 UTC,wow. just..what? thanks for telling me!
bestoflegaladvice,32e9cu,Anonymoose15,1 point,Tue Apr 14 03:00:32 2015 UTC,someone should archive this and put it in the side bar to say that it is important to tell the truth when asking questions
bestoflegaladvice,32e9cu,clairebones,11,Tue Apr 14 16:08:19 2015 UTC,The first few links show up the same for me
bestoflegaladvice,32a35e,CujoCrunch,30,Sat Apr 11 23:27:30 2015 UTC,"If you can get over the original question, he was pretty reasonable in his comments."
bestoflegaladvice,32a35e,dinosaurs_quietly,6,Sun Apr 12 01:57:03 2015 UTC,"Original OP:   So basically my Father and my Mother never got married but had me out of wedlock, they separated and didn't see each other again. Father got married to a woman whom he started a restaurant chain with and were very successful and had 2 kids together, when they got a divorce he lost everything to her because the judge said that ""it was really not for her but for the kids"".  It's been 20 years now and we recently reunited, my question is this.... Do I have any claim to those restaurants or any monetary compensation? It was suggested by some friends that perhaps I could have some legal right as he is my father and they are my [half] siblings and I was overlooked during the divorce hearings. I know it looks bad, but I've struggled all my life and this would go a long way towards helping me get back on my feet. I haven't talked to my siblings about it, nor my father and I am afraid to even ask because it would seem so bad.   Note: OP is unrelated to the woman with the restaurants and assets."
bestoflegaladvice,32a35e,headphonebreaker,41,Sat Apr 11 23:30:00 2015 UTC,Can't rag on the guy to hard he just didn't know if he was entitled to anything. Even though i think he should have known at least he's not acting 1/100 as bad as some people can get.
bestoflegaladvice,32a35e,sb452,25,Sun Apr 12 01:02:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly. OP asked for legal advice, got it, accepted it, was generally polite, and gets criticized for not knowing the law. On a forum where people ask for legal advice."
bestoflegaladvice,32a35e,KillerPotato_BMW,-6,Sun Apr 12 16:48:54 2015 UTC,Wat?
bestoflegaladvice,325d0u,bduddy,30,Fri Apr 10 18:40:44 2015 UTC,the fact that he edited his post to mention specific people seemed pretty childish. so they say something you think is dumb or disagree with.. who cares? move on.
bestoflegaladvice,325d0u,marilyn_monbroseph,13,Sat Apr 11 02:37:19 2015 UTC,"I don't get it. He doesn't like being outright dismissed without being told the legal background, he isn't  upset at being told it's a bad idea.  He also isn't planning anything, he just wants to know what his options are if he needs to protect his dog. Seems pretty clear and reasonable to me."
bestoflegaladvice,325d0u,dinosaurs_quietly,22,Fri Apr 10 20:09:16 2015 UTC,"He doesn't like being outright dismissed without being told the legal background, he isn't upset at being told it's a bad idea.   Yeah, I can see both sides. He's asking if he can use deadly force when there is no threat to himself. That's pretty dumb (IMO). I'm not really happy with concealed carry permit holders thinking about what non-life threatening situations they can discharge their weapon.  That said, there's no rule against asking dumb questions. So he does deserve a decent answer. But the snarky edit in the post won't win him friends."
bestoflegaladvice,325d0u,Not_for_consumption,-16,Sat Apr 11 03:03:34 2015 UTC,"But simply firing a gun isn't deadly force. Can a farmer put down his own animal? What if you are hunting and hit someone's dog 100 yards away?  I'm really disappointed no one discussed this, I think it would be very interesting."
bestoflegaladvice,325d0u,dinosaurs_quietly,18,Sat Apr 11 03:53:52 2015 UTC,"A firearm is a device capable of deadly force, always.  If I use it, I'm using deadly force, the question is, what am I using it against?  If I'm using it against a person, then the laws that concern attacking people apply, and if there's anything special about attacking someone with deadly force in those laws, they'll apply- for example, agg assault vs. regular assault.  Can a farmer destroy his own property?  Of course.  The question is, if he uses a firearm, does it violate any laws about discharging a firearm?  Does he live in a town that forbids discharging firearms?  Did he violate noise regulations?  Did he disturb the peace?  Did the slug exit the animal and go somewhere afterwards and do damage?  Did he commit the act in a reckless manner, and might face reckless endangerment charges?  Destroying your own livestock isn't a defense to crime.  If you're hunting, you have to comply with hunting regulations, and you're still absolutely responsible for what you shoot.  If you hit someone else's dog, you're certainly liable from a civil standpoint.  You may be charged with some sort of reckless endangerment if you're firing off shots in the woods and hitting stuff you didn't mean to.  Hunting within the hunting regulations isn't a defense to crime."
bestoflegaladvice,325d0u,jkh1232,16,Sat Apr 11 12:01:49 2015 UTC,"It is deadly force, always."
bestoflegaladvice,325d0u,ultralame,-11,Sat Apr 11 09:49:39 2015 UTC,No it's not. Most states let you fire guns on your backyard if you have enough land.
bestoflegaladvice,325d0u,dinosaurs_quietly,16,Sat Apr 11 14:44:44 2015 UTC,"That means you are allowed to use deadly force in your backyard in this manner.   I think you keep attaching the ""deadly"" to where the bullet ends up. That's not how it works.   A gun is designed to end a life. That is its ultimate purpose. Every time it is fired,  death can occur. Every time.  You may decide to use it to open a can. If so, you are using deadly force to open a can. This may be legal where you happen to be (I know it was at boy scout camp in WI in 1987). It sounds to me that you are arguing that if you successfully open the can and nothing else happens, it's not deadly.  Note: as an example of this, when police fire a weapon, it is always considered ""the use of deadly force"". And for those police, there is no excuse for firing a gun unless the intent was to end a life. There's no warning shots, no aiming for the legs, no shooting out tires.  Of course, a policeman isn't target shooting in the line of duty, and usually doesn't have to kill an animal (occasionally), but in those cases that is a legal use of deadly force."
bestoflegaladvice,325d0u,ultralame,6,Sat Apr 11 16:34:35 2015 UTC,I think you forgot the fact that its improper use vs proper use. The gun is ALWAYS deadly force even when used on livestock. The point is its proper use of deadly force because the farmer didn't drag his cow to the middle of a busy street and shoot it right there. He did it in a safe and controlled environment for a proper reason.
bestoflegaladvice,325d0u,leetdood_shadowban,3,Sat Apr 11 19:03:33 2015 UTC,"But simply firing a gun isn't deadly force.   I thought it was, but I don't know much about guns and gun law. I'm not sure if farmers and hunters are the same as this situation; OP was talking of conceal carry of a hand gun rather than carrying a ""working"" firearm."
bestoflegaladvice,325d0u,Not_for_consumption,28,Sat Apr 11 08:06:42 2015 UTC,"He was told the legal background several times, and persisted.  Dog attacks are extremely rare, and pulling out a gun is one of the worst things you could do to stop them. Why would you even need to ask, other than the typical gun nut fantasy of trying to figure out ways to use it?"
bestoflegaladvice,325d0u,Anonymoose15,7,Fri Apr 10 20:50:41 2015 UTC,The top post is someone trying to tell him he doesn't have a conceal carry permit.
bestoflegaladvice,325d0u,qwicksilfer,25,Fri Apr 10 21:23:22 2015 UTC,I think that's because Boston and the surrounding areas do not issue concealed carry permits. And I think the guy said he lived in Boston (though he went back and forth if he actually lived there).
bestoflegaladvice,325d0u,dinosaurs_quietly,4,Sat Apr 11 13:07:19 2015 UTC,"Hardly. The top 3 posts are ""bad idea"" with no legal background. The fifth post down is the first one to attempt to answer the question.  People carry concealed. It's controversial, I get it. It's saved lives, cost lives, caused problems, solved problems, but no matter what it is legal (depending on region and permit)  and not crazy.  Dog attacks aren't that rare, especially against another dog. If you are already carrying a gun, is it not reasonable that you consider using it to save your dog?"
bestoflegaladvice,325d0u,EmeraldGirl,33,Fri Apr 10 22:41:34 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but yes. It's unreasonable in a populated, public area. I own a gun, I'm licensed to concealed carry (I choose not to, but I'm licensed), and I adore my dogs... But there are 101 better ways to break up a dog fight. Quite frankly, it'd be too easy to shoot your own dog or miss entirely and hit someone else. It's just a bad idea.  Edit: Just to clarify, I would absolutely kill another dog if I thought one of mine were going to be severely injured, just not by firing my gun in a public park."
bestoflegaladvice,325d0u,dinosaurs_quietly,-9,Sat Apr 11 02:36:41 2015 UTC,"True, but it would still be interesting to discuss. If OP is a 90 pound girl that can't stop a huge dog, should she let her dog get killed? What if the park is empty? What if it's full?  Neat thing to talk about, but no one was game."
bestoflegaladvice,325d0u,jkh1232,8,Sat Apr 11 03:58:16 2015 UTC,"To answer your first question: Yes. Second: Doesn't matter.* Third: Doesn't matter.*  *Legally, not tactically."
