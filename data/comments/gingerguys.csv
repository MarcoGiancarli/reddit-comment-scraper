gingerguys,248t5u,PieInTheSkye,3,Tue May 13 23:48:38 2014 UTC,"My sister-in-law (a ginger) was thanking the heavens when my nephew was born that he was not a red head. I almost cried. She told me that she ""got picked on for being a female ginger and being a man and a ginger is ten times worse."" It made me so sad to hear that because I am so in love with ginger men. Gimme that sparkly facial hair and freckles every day. I feel bad saying that, because my husband is (much to my dismay lol) a brunette. When I make a comment or someone discovers my secret fetish, I get a lot of weird looks - but fuck, freckles are hot.  So, ginger guy ninja, don't ever feel bad for looking unique. There are plenty of people out there, like me, who are literally obsessed with the way you look. In fact, I've been dying my hair red since I was 14. In the way that some gay men prefer ""bears"" - there's someone for everyone. And all the upvotes we fans sling around are for ALL you ginger guys, especially those afraid of posting. Own it, son. You were born with a gift I wasn't and I'm jealous as hell. The grass is always greener but don't let that fool you. tons of love"

gingerguys,1fkncu,manicmolly,1 point,Mon Jun 3 18:14:23 2013 UTC,"For less than one day--mostly around the airport. I may be visiting in November though, in a quick jaunt around Northern Europe, then to a potential school interview in Switzerland."
gingerguys,1fkncu,manicmolly,1 point,Mon Jun 3 18:52:34 2013 UTC,sounds very interesting! In November the canals might be frozen over and you can skate on them! Amsterdam is very pretty in the winter (and the rest of the year!)
gingerguys,1fkncu,manicmolly,1 point,Mon Jun 3 20:32:44 2013 UTC,"So I've heard! I spent a week in Ireland, then the Shetland Islands off of Scotland, London, then flew from there to Aberdeen, to Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Hamburg, and then, finally, Rome. I want to spend at least a week in Amsterdam next time I visit--you live there, I take it?"
