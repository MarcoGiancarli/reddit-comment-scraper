TheWire,3e5cjz,SangminSunbae,5,Wed Jul 22 03:47:36 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I watched the show, so my memory might be wrong, but I think there's another kid who fits a similar role to that you assign to Michael: the girl who attacks the other girl with a razor.     She clearly needed help or protection from the bullies, but instead she gets bullied over and over until she snaps completely. If she'd acted out sooner, someone might have picked up on her, but instead she kept it in until she reached her ""breaking point"" and went down a path that's not likely to get her much help in the future."

TheWire,3e5cjz,Duck_Matthew5,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:03:28 2015 UTC,"Very interesting perspective! I think if you like at the kids from an external perspective, as in their home life, then you're right that Namond needed the least help. But if you look at their personalities he definitely needed the most help. He was soft and not cut out for life on the streets. Dukie was soft too, but he was intelligent. We saw that when he was learning along with Randy in Prezbo's classroom. Michael was tough AND intelligent. Yes he came from a broken home, but was the most able to help himself.  My take on season 4 was that the moral was supposed to be nature vs. nurture, and that nurture was being neglected. It showed that if a kid like Namond can be raised in a supportive household he can thrive, and without it, well the rest is out there."

TheWire,3dnh6j,j1mb0b,9,Fri Jul 17 18:26:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not a cop, so I can't comment on how widespread using force to generate confessions is but I can tell you that they are supposed to be inadmissible in court. This of course relies on the judge believing the defense and not the police."
TheWire,3dnh6j,TheLizardKing89,7,Fri Jul 17 19:18:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know what your talking about in regards to the ""mandatory recording laws."" All I could find was a few articles that say some stations do this while others don't.  Some of what your asking (regarding false confessions) has been noted as a problem in the past, but The Wire is a TV show and it didn't delve into that area.  Also The Wire was based on 90's Baltimore so maybe that played into it a little too?"
TheWire,3dnh6j,johnycake,5,Fri Jul 17 18:49:14 2015 UTC,"You're hitting upon the theme of the entire show.  I mean, really, that's what The Wire is about at it's heart -- there is a spectrum of ""good"" and ""bad"", and just as often the ""good"" guys who are ""law abiding"" in the eyes of the court are every bit as terrible as the people they are throwing behind bars.  At it's core, The Wire is a stunning reminder of the human condition:  What will you sell your soul for?  You can point to almost anyone in the show and they have a price.  It might not always be money, but it's still there.   I just find it odd that the detectives will rely on evidence they recover after a beating, and don't appear concerned that the defendant will later claim their admission was made under duress and ask for their lawyer to have it withdrawn?   Which is only relevant if you have a court system that isn't looking for political leverage and a police department that isn't doing everything they can to make themselves look better to the mayor, who in turn is doing everything he can to pad his resume to make a run for higher office.  I think it's probably with a wry grin that the series points out that often the most honest people are by no means the ones with the most power.  Often it's the complete reverse.  Even when the series is selling you on how honest Carcetti is, it's destroying his credentials as an honest politician when he wants the crime books to be cooked."

TheWire,3dnh6j,tonyperkissenior,2,Sat Jul 18 03:30:43 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert but if I recall correctly there were no mandatory recording laws in interviews back then and possibly still not today. I believe it's actually a voluntary thing, police precincts can choose whether to do so or not.  The Shield had something similar, the main character is notoriously violent and many of his arrests are brought into question for police brutality. They also use a camera to record all their interrogations but whenever they decide to beat on a suspect they just switch the camera off and it was never really addressed as to whether that affected the case in court or not."
TheWire,3dnh6j,TheDeadManWalks,2,Fri Jul 17 19:58:34 2015 UTC,"They don't actually need confessions from the dudes they beat the shit out of. Bodie was arrested for hitting a cop in full view of other cops, and Bird was caught thanks to his gun.  Even if there were mandatory recording, the recording equipment could easily be made to ""malfunction"".   As you noted, the BPD paid huge amounts of out-of-court settlements in police brutality cases, notably through the practice of ""rough rides"" (putting cuffed people in the back of a wagon with nothing to hold onto and taking sharp turns). A few people even died from it."

TheWire,3dnh6j,GetHighr,2,Sat Jul 18 05:05:28 2015 UTC,"Short answer - No, I don't believe there is any mandatory recording of police interviews. It's certainly not a law on the books, a specific police department may record interviews as police. But it's not a law.   The violence dolled out in the show is usually against criminals who don't follow up with the kinds of complaints featured in that article.  The specific beat-downs I can think of in the show (bodie, bird, the kid who shot dozerman) don't actually provide any evidence post-arrest. They have the evidence, they are arrested, and they are beat up.   Keep in mind, it's the police and if there was an audio tape of the beat down they would certainly destroy it on purpose then claim they lost it.   When they do arrest someone and try to obtain information from them, they don't get beat up."

There are very few times that officers shoot their weapon. In one of the first episodes, an officer accidentally fired his weapon and has to fill out paperwork. That's not to say you don't get any action, because there are but don't expect it too often.  This show is also a lot like reading a book, where there isn't a standout episode, it all just builds. The more effort you put into the show, the more you get out of it. The show doesn't hold your hand to keep up with the characters or the terminology being used. Just know that going in, it's not a show for everybody. But it is very entertaining and there really isn't any other show like it."

If you skip one episode then the next one will not make sense, even checking reddit for a few minutes during an episode will leave you confused as to what's happening (I made that mistake at first).

He was the biggest scumbag on the show in my opinion, all he ever did was kill people and sell drugs. At least with the other drug dealers there were some kind of rules and if you never fucked with them you were not in direct danger, Marlo would kill a man just for being in his way, or just because he felt like it."

TheWire,3cyfse,NotAlaskan,4,Sun Jul 12 15:16:59 2015 UTC,"But do you really think after that happened that he left the game or did he just get more fierce?  The show showed people going to jail and getting out but it was only Cutty that ever managed to quit the game, and he didn't figure that out for himself until he went back for another round and found out the game wasn't in him anymore. You see that most definitely, the fire is still in Marlo and maybe even stronger than ever.  After Prop Joe begs for his life and a chance to leave the game, Marlo responds ""Truth is, you won't be able to change up any more than me.""  I like to think Marlo continued his business but was a little smarter about it."
TheWire,3cyfse,NotAlaskan,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:09:57 2015 UTC,"You have a point. Considering Marlo's character, he probably returned to the game. However, wouldn't the end result be the same?

With Marlo being a lot younger than Barksdale and String it's interesting to see him take a more 'disrespectful' route and just come in and change everything up because he is so full of himself.

I'm not saying its a good code, but it exists. He doesn't allow anyone below him to tell him what to do, and if someone does that he takes it as a sign of disrespect. That's why he killed the security guard, because he tried to tell Marlo what's what, and Marlo takes that as the security guard not knowing his place, therefore foolishness and disrespect, and he got got for it."

The police get lots of calls for the motel and the wal-mart, and the local mayor seems to be blaming the property owners for the disturbances. I don't see anything specific about what policies either one of these businesses is maintaining that encourages crime.   Abandoning a local business to crime is the exact opposite of Hamsterdam. Colvin's plan was to let the drug trade operate in abandoned parts of his district while the law abiding parts of the area could continue about their daily lives. It was specifically local business that he wanted to save. Colvin negotiated an armistice with the drug trade.   I don't understand why the WalMart can't hire off duty cops as private security. I don't understand why the cops don't want to respond to theft calls under $50. What is law enforcement doing to combat what is clearly a systemic crime problem?

Bunk correctly infers that Jimmy never intends on letting Cole have his clearance. Bunk doesn't feel right about it but does it anyway.   Later at the bar when Jimmy is trying to make Bunk feel better about lying, he turns to Jimmy and says ""I'll carry it, fuck it."" There is obvious tension between them at that point so Jimmy pays the tab and gets up to leave.   Bunk, feeling shitty about himself, sees a woman down the bar (who looks and sounds very much like Randy's foster mother, but that's a different topic for a different time) and tells Jimmy to call Nadine (Bunk's wife) and tell her he caught one and is on the street so he can cheat on his wife.  Jimmy gives him a look of disapproval, but Bunk says ""I lied for you didn't I?""  This leads to the hilarious scene where Bunk is wasted in the bathroom of the woman's house burning his clothes because of the trace evidence. Jimmy shows up to take Bunk away and brings him to his own house (because Bunk certainly can't go home in some random woman's pink bathrobe), putting Bunk to bed in one of his kids' bed.  Bunk then says ""Jimmy, you're no good for people, you know that? I mean...everyone around you..."" implying that Jimmy's shittiness as a person rubs off on all the people close to him. Which in this case, is true.  I like this exchange between them and its fitting that Bunk is laid down in the empty Bunk beds. The only reason that bed is empty for Bunk to sleep in is because Jimmy is divorced and only has partial custody. A divorce that was entirely his fault.  The whole thing happens in the last 10 or so minutes of the episode."

Later Frank Sobotka (I don't know what the actor's name is, he's always Frank Sobotka to me) guest stars.  Brief Interviews With Hideous Men is kind of a weird movie, but it has Freamon and Burrell.

Can't wait to see your reaction once you finish it.   As to your questions: not really. I'd just say pay attention to it all; it's written extremely cleverly, so every scene, exchange and line is important and is there for a reason. You don't have to constantly re-watch everything and analyse it, of course, or even read up on the episodes, just watch and pay attention so you don't miss anything. Since you also love True Detective i'm guessing that won't be a problem. Enjoy the rest of the series, it truly is the greatest of all time :)"
TheWire,3cq607,RhllorTheLordOfLight,3,Thu Jul 9 22:19:07 2015 UTC,"I think what has really grabbed me is the setting. Baltimore isn't exactly a sexy criminal city like Miami or LA for a TV show. It shows that crime is everywhere, and wherever there are criminals there will be cops.  From just the the first few episodes I can tell that the writers want to drive this point home, along with the fact that this is a game that can't end. One criminal is killed or incarcerated and three more pop up to fill his spot, serving the kingpins. The guys on the street don't matter, it's guys in the smokey back rooms that are the real 'bad guys'.  Other shows sort of glorify these men in control as misunderstood redeemable characters, but The Wire paints them as they are - intelligent but cruel. Victim of their culture and upbringing? Yes. But that doesn't change who they are and what they do.  The depth about criminal culture and cop culture, combined with the simple but lovable 'cops and robbers' stories make this show really fun to watch. I feel like I live in West Baltimore when I'm watching this show."

TheWire,3cq607,thisishardcore_,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:20:53 2015 UTC,"I like how all these hugely acclaimed dramas choose less glamorous places as their setting, rather than just opting for New York or Los Angeles. Baltimore in The Wire, Albuquerque in Breaking Bad, and although some of The Sopranos takes place in New York, most of it is just random parts of New Jersey.  I guess it's because the cityscapes of these places gives these shows a unique feel. Everyone knows what New York and Los Angeles look like from the amount of films and TV shows that have been set there so it kind of becomes a bit cliche. Whereas the cityscape of Baltimore is a massive part of what makes The Wire so iconic."

Every season we  get a facet of the drug trade/politics/police in Baltimore, we are shown a different part of this giant puzzle. Whereas HoC largely is a personal story about Frank Underwood. The politics is merely the way his story is being told.His personal story is  the real driving force, so the politics and realism take a backseat to his plotting and legacy scheming."
TheWire,3cnegw,allamacalledcarl,4,Thu Jul 9 07:26:14 2015 UTC,"I think HOC poorly portrays how smart and conniving politicians are.

TheWire,3cnegw,Victor_Zsasz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:43:46 2015 UTC,"The Wire uses politics to explain and show the problems of Baltimore, whereas House of Cards, despite being centered around politics, only uses politics to explain and show the intellect and cunning of Frank Underwood.   As an example, look at an event depicted on both shows, a televised debate.   The wire uses this scene to showcase the difference between Carcetti and Royce, the animosity that race causes in the city, and the effect that a dead witness can have on an election. The issues they discuss, crime and education, are central to the plot of the story.   House of Cards uses it's debate to weaken Franks Position during the teacher's strike, and to make the reveal scene with the brick all the more shocking. The underlying political issues he must whip up support for are rarely important to him, and he's constantly mustering support to later revoke it for personal gain.   In summary, House of Cards isn't interested in a debate about entitlement reform, they want to give Frank a vessel to beat up on a Tea Party member using senate procedures, and come out seeming stronger. The Wire very much wants to debate the role of education and crime in today's society, and also wants to discuss the role of politicians in these problems."

Sure, it was better for the neighborhoods where the drug traffic used to be, but what about the people inside there? Everyone who saw it realized what a living hell it was, even Bubbs. In the finale, when he's talking to Colvin looking at the wreckage of Hamsterdam, Colvin says ""it was a good thing, wasn't it?"" Bubbs just looks at him, shrugs, and says ""I don't know, I'm just sayin'.."" To me, the fact that someone like Bubbs who has everything to gain from a place like that won't necessarily agree that it was good, is the biggest damnation on Hamsterdam."
TheWire,3chbps,mcribb_runner,2,Sun Jul 12 19:08:34 2015 UTC,"Late reply, but those people were living in that same situation before Hamsterdam, too, it just wasn't concentrated.

TheWire,3chbps,bayernownz1995,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:31:21 2015 UTC,"True, but that came after. Remember the deacon who visits Hamsterdam, and who asks about clean water, needles, condoms, treatments etc. ?  It's only then that social services get involved. Agreed, since Hamsterdam was never official, Colvin wanted to kepp the least people possible involved.  But still, that place was a living hell until they started working towards that. And still then, it's hard to say it was really ""better"" than being on the streets.  I actually think Hamsterdam was a great idea. Like that's the way to go : stop demonizing drug users, stop this war on drugs that makes no sense, and actually try to fix the issue at the source.

TheWire,3cgy00,Qawi9,5,Wed Jul 8 00:53:34 2015 UTC,"I beg you to watch the HD remaster your 1st time. It gives added detail to the quality of the shots and displays the colors much better. You may think you're getting a ""retro"" or ""original"" vibe when you watch in SD, but I think it actually takes away from the experience. If The Wire is depicting real life, you want the viewing to be as close to real life as possible (widescreen is closer to your eye's natural viewing range, the quality is as previously mentioned better, etc). The 1st time I watched The Wire, I did Season 1 all in SD, and then switched to S2 for HD. I wish I had done it sooner. I also had the same thought process when I went back and watched Star Trek: The Next Generation. The SD doesn't hold a candle to an HD Wire experience in my opinion (ignore the bad music & there are no spoilers in that comparison video, only stills)."

It all seemed pretty below average until Jim 'The fuck did I do?!' McNulty turned up. I think the marketing problem lay mainly in calling it 'John Carter' (and completely forgetting the whole 'of Mars' bit).
TheWire,3cdf4z,Cpt_Tsundere_Sharks,14,Tue Jul 7 01:21:27 2015 UTC,"Rawls is good police. It's showed when Kima gets shot and he takes control of the whole crime scene. He may have started out like any of the guys we see and identify with on the show, but he climbed through the ranks and he has lost touch with what made him police at heart because the politics game got to him. He knows what keeps the department afloat and he is content with just that: keeping it level. Not rising above the chain of command that he's had to endure all his career like McNulty tries to do even if the case matters, and never falling under the desired clearance rate because not only does it mean bad news for him and the department but it also means failure, from him and his officers, and Rawls is not someone to tolerate that. He's one of the more intriguing characters on the show, and he definitely plays A game, but not the one the viewer can easily sympathize with."
TheWire,3cdf4z,Hukka,7,Tue Jul 7 01:32:41 2015 UTC,"No, he's not good police. He's always been this way, but it matters to everyone, especially politically when a police gets shot. It matters to him because he's a person, not a police. Remember in Season 5 when they get the patrol guy to help them out with the fake serial killings?  ""MaQuayle was in homicide and he caught one, a botched kidnapping. He gets there, he finds the area chief sightseeing through his scene, asks him to back off. Cites the GO.""  ""G-3: authority and responsibility to coordinate the investigation shall rest with the homicide detective.""  ""Area chief takes umbrage. Oscar stands his ground and there's quite a dust up. The next morning he's told he's insubordinate. He's gotta work two weeks extra duty pounding pavement up on Monument Street. He told them to go fuck themselves, you know. He'll take the trial board. Well, he eats two weeks, and they shitcanned him out the unit.""  ""Area chief?""  ""Name of Rawls if I remember it.""  Rawls is all about authority. His authority, even when he's in the wrong.  My point with the original post is that he can't see it from outside his own perspective."
TheWire,3cdf4z,Hukka,3,Tue Jul 7 03:42:26 2015 UTC,"I wish you weren't getting downvoted because that's certainly a valid throw back to help understand Bill Rawls.   As it stands you can definitely say he is power hungry and he revels in being in command, no matter whether it requires him overstepping his boundaries. He doesn't like to have his word questioned and he acts pettily as a way to get even with the people that slighted him. I agree that he cannot see past his office and he is not an empathetic character, he doesn't relate to much unless it brings him something, but I believe that doesn't change the fact that he must have been an effective cog of the police department at some point during his career. He simply came upon a fork in the road one time where going one way or the other meant either being effective, or being powerful, and he definitely chose the latter. Whether he did that without scruple, I don't think we can tell from the limited backstory we had on him.   What I love most about the wire is how even the simplest characters (Herc, the yos, everyone) actually grow and change from their actions and the events happening  around them. However, the older characters on the show (Jay Landsman, Butchie, Rawls, other names I forget but the list isn't that long) don't seem to receive that much growth.. but my opinion on that is that it's because they are done growing. They've somehow ended up where they are after evolving the same way we see the changes happening to the other characters, and all they do is maintain now, the only way they know how. For Rawls, it means being a power angry dick kind of a boss and not seeing past his clearance rates; because that's what he needs to do to maintain. But he may have been good police at heart and he certainly has the skills to be one; he's just done playing that game. Whether he is conscious of his neglect for the other types of workings around Baltimore, I'm uncertain, and the point you brought up in the first post sure makes it seem so. My gut tells me that he's aware, but the facts do point otherwise."
TheWire,3cdf4z,Hukka,3,Tue Jul 7 14:03:30 2015 UTC,"I would argue that he doesn't need to have been an effective police at any point in his career with Valchek as an example. The most interesting thing about Valchek is that across the seasons his name shows up a lot where the character is not.   In the first season when Daniels is trying to get rid of Pyrzbo, he goes around asking people and they all give him the same response: ""He's got some kind of suction."" And then he goes to his Lieutenant friend and he says, ""He's got suction with Valchek.""  Season 2 he shows up because he has a beef with Frank Sobotka. Burrell gives him his detail because Valchek's word means a lot in the First District and it would help Burrell immensely to make him commissioner. And when Pyrzbo is trying to tell him about the actual police work they were doing in the Barksdale case, Valchek says, ""Shut up, and listen to me and you might have a career in this department.""  In the following seasons, he is Carcetti's in on the police department. He sets up the meet with Burrell. Later he gives clean stats to Carcetti when he knows Burrell is fudging them, he helps Herc get his stripes through political means rather than being good police, and he's also the Baltimore Sun's most important police source. ""Stan, don't be telling me that Burrell is getting shitcanned today and you don't know all about it. Don't be fucking telling me that Stan!"" And it gets him Police Commissioner in the end.  My point is that Valchek clearly played the political game his entire career as a police. He doesn't juke the stats, he doesn't do real police work, he just gets into people's pockets and digs deep so when they use him they owe him. Eventually, he's in so many pockets that people need him. ""A necessary evil,"" as Burrell puts it. He's basically a white Clay Davis.   So why could the same not be true of Rawls in a different way? He could have always had a head for authority. I'm not really sure where ""area chief"" falls on the ranking ladder, but it seems early on to me. Greater than a police officer first class, but less than a sergeant, maybe about equal with a detective based on the story. Seems pretty early in the career to me."
TheWire,3cdf4z,johnycake,2,Tue Jul 7 17:08:33 2015 UTC,"You're decidedly right. I forgot about Valchek and he is a prime example that you don't need to have any kind of skills to stay at the top if your name has been mentioned enough throughout your career. He seems like one of the very few black/white characters of the show morally speaking. I definitely forgot most things about him because he was so unlikable overall; the actor is amazing though, the writers could've taken the role either way and we'd be none the wiser.   He certainly played the politics game all throughout, slipping through the cracks and eventually reaching a position where he is untouchable because of how far reaching his influence is, or at least with how varied the people he does and expects favor for/from.   I'm not from the US or very knowledgeable about police ranks but you seem to be right too when you say Rawls isn't that high up the rank ladder at the time of the beef with the homicide detective. I can't seem to find anything about what an area chief is; the only thing I read is that it's similar to a police commissioner but that sounds rather unlikely. Or perhaps he was the area chief for a subdivision of the B.P.D. and managed to convince someone he should rank the the detective? I don't know, that is probably not it though.  He could have climbed his way to the top through slimey politics à la Valchek, but I want to believe Rawls has the redeeming quality of actually having been good police at some point in his life, even if he did it just for the authority he knew that would bring him. We know so little about him, it's really open to discussion. I'm glad you brought this up, it's quite interesting to think about. You may be right about Rawls; I'm going to hold onto my hope of him being competent on the field though but we'll see if I don't change my mind on rewatches."
TheWire,3cdf4z,jmarFTL,7,Wed Jul 8 20:32:59 2015 UTC,"Dude Rawls is not stupid. He knows that Barksdale probably ordered the murder but he doesn't want the detectives pursuing that angle because of the media shitstorm that would (and did) arrive when rumors about this get out.  It looks incredibly bad that the city can't protect their own people, and if word got out it would discourage other possible witnesses from stepping forward.

Daniels is trying to build something. He wants to build a unit that will go after the drug dealers in an in-depth manner. That was the deal he made when he took the homicides of the girls in the shipping container in Season 2.

It also says a lot about cops in general that despite how much of an idiot he is, all the mistakes he's made and lives hes ruined, Herc is still beloved by other police officers."
TheWire,3c492v,memefan69,16,Sat Jul 4 18:35:12 2015 UTC,I would say Carver ends up more Bunny Colvin than Daniels.
TheWire,3c492v,Arrow156,8,Sat Jul 4 20:54:17 2015 UTC,"Because of Daniels' dirty years working in the Southeast District, and Carver's bad years in the Western, I always assumed he was more Daniels. Career minded but also a good investigator (by the end).   He might work as Colvin, but Bunny seems like the reform storyline. Carver doesn't seem hugely interested in reform. He's interested in good police work and looking after his people. He will know how to tell a young officer how to talk his way out of a excessive force charge. Doesn't that seem more like Daniels?"
TheWire,3c492v,memefan69,5,Sun Jul 5 01:40:18 2015 UTC,"Didn't he turn in Coochie for police brutality? Also, he did seem willing to reform during the Hamsterdam situation. He didn't complain about it like that asshole Herc. He was civil to the dealers. He even helped move the body of the boy who was killed. He wanted to make it work."
TheWire,3c492v,Mkcn97,3,Sun Jul 5 02:12:32 2015 UTC,"Carver ends season 5 where Daniels begins season 1, the same way that Syndor ends season 5 where McNulty begins season 1. That always made me think of Carver as the new Daniels."
TheWire,3c492v,memefan69,2,Sun Jul 5 02:16:30 2015 UTC,"Well Daniels is more about the career and Colvin was more about the policing.  While Daniels opened his eyes at the end of Season 2, Carver was still pretty much the same guy, maybe a bit more loyal. But after season three and Colvin's speech about how little cops know about real policing Carver changes with season 4; he's talking to mopes instead of just busting head. I think the real clarifying moment when he decides to write up that cop who attacked the teacher in season 5 instead of help him beat the charge.  He tried to pull a Daniels at first by trying to talk the guy through it but ended up not juking the incident, like Colvin not juking his crime stats in season 3."
TheWire,3c492v,Arrow156,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:41:24 2015 UTC,I never even thought of Carver as the new Colvin. You have a point.
TheWire,3c492v,memefan69,7,Sun Jul 5 05:12:53 2015 UTC,"I've heard this said about other shows before.   Herc gets a story arc, in that things happen to him. But he doesn't get a character arc because he's essentially the same person at the end as at the start."
TheWire,3c492v,decerian,2,Sat Jul 4 21:32:44 2015 UTC,"He's basically a metaphor for the corruption and incompetence of the city systems.  Nothing changes, at best when exposed it moves from one place to another."

But The Wire shows that life is funny, and a guy like Herc who makes all the wrong moves can fall into some serious dumb luck and get promoted."

Some go through serious character development in later seasons, some don't. And just like real life, there is never a clear protagonist. If you have ever checked out tvtropes, The Wire reminds me of ""grey and black morality"" where some characters are good guys who do bad things, some are bad guys who do good things, and most are just humans making human choices in circumstances beyond their control!"

TheWire,3c1htp,omeletteparty,2,Fri Jul 3 22:28:19 2015 UTC,"He screws over everybody. He has no knowledge of what's going on around him, he has tunnel vision for his own goals."
TheWire,3c1htp,gramsespektrum,7,Fri Jul 3 22:33:16 2015 UTC,"Who do you think he screws over? He's also pretty moral. Unlike many of the other cops and politicians, he genuinely cares about solving the city's problems. He doesn't just want to bang some heads and get his salary (like Herc for example), he wants Barsdale and Stringer Bell to go down, because he wants to save West Baltimore.  In relation to for example his friends Bunk, Kima, Bubbles, he seems to be a good guy."
TheWire,3c1htp,Mkcn97,11,Fri Jul 3 23:16:51 2015 UTC,"Lol you actually believe that horseshit? McNulty didn't give a shit about the city's problems and didn't want to save West Baltimore. He does what he does for his ego, to prove he's the smartest fuck in the room. Everyone says this about him and he even admits to it. He wanted Stringer to go down because he wanted to be smarter than him, and was frustrated that he kept outsmarting him. He even seemed to be jealous of him and had a grudging respect for him. He didn't care about murders, this is proven in his serial killer plot by how he just used the homeless men as pawns. Also, how he didn't care that Stringer stopped dropping bodies, if he did he would've focused on Kintell Williams who was, but he didn't give a shit. There's so many more examples."
TheWire,3c1htp,gramsespektrum,3,Sat Jul 4 00:14:23 2015 UTC,"Lol, relax dude. I'd say he did give a shit. Sure, I agree with all the stuff about his ego, arrogance, and him wanting to prove himself, but that doesn't make him immoral.  He wanted to take down the drug kingpins, first Barksdale and Stringer, and later Marlo. I don't see why you're holding that against him. I really don't know why you're criticising him for wanting to be smarter than Stringer. I never claimed that he has the nicest personality, only that he has his good sides as well.   He didn't care about murders, this is proven in his serial killer plot by how he just used the homeless men as pawns.   You make it sound like he killed them or something. He used people who were already dead to get means to take down Marlo, remember?"
TheWire,3c1htp,Mkcn97,2,Sun Jul 5 20:50:05 2015 UTC,"I didn't say he was ""immoral"". But by definition he was in many ways. That doesn't make a character unlikable. Anyway, he was rooting for another homeless man to die so he could use them. It doesn't matter if they were already dead. I mean if you don't call that and a lot of what he did ""immoral"", I don't know what is. Why can't I hold that against him? He wasn't smarter than Stringer. My point is he didn't care about the murders, he did what he did for his ego. There are a lot more sympathetic dealers than cops."

I liked him the first season but 2 and 3 I started to hate him. 90% of the characters even call him a asshole POS. He doesn't want to clean the city up, he wants Stringer.

In season 1 I didn't have a favorite and I somewhat liked McNulty. Season 2 I really liked Frank Sabotka. I really think thats when I started not liking the LEOs on the show when they were going after him. He was dirty but he was still innocent when the cops say they're innocent when they're dirty.  So, right now Avon, Stringer, Bodie, and Lt. Daniels.  edit: Can't forget Lester. Lester is just straight up with everything and cannot hate him on that."
TheWire,3c1htp,AlsoBrightened,2,Sat Jul 4 02:48:22 2015 UTC,"I really like Bodie right now for some reason.   I felt the same way.  It turns out, he is arguably this subreddit's favorite character of the entire show."

TheWire,3c1htp,Mkcn97,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:02:32 2015 UTC,"He wants Stringer to go down because Stringer mocked him in the court scene in the first episode.  It's a personal vendetta.  That's why Jimmy was so upset over Stringer's death as he wasn't able to put the bracelets on him.   Also, Bunk and Kima are shown to have the higher moral ground, explicitly depicted in the final season with the staged murders.  Bubbles has always been a pretty honorable junkie, and I'd hold all three of them above McNulty when it comes to altruism.  Remember the shit McNutty pulled with the unstable homeless person.  That was absolutely heart-breaking and really dispicable on Jimmy's part.    edit:  if you want to talk about caring about West Baltimore, the only person you can really bring up is Bunny and from the non-cop side, Cutty."

Perhaps you can take solace in the fact the show is solid enough that not much is ruined in knowing the ending.  In fact, it takes a few rewatches to take the whole show in.  Shakespeare gives away the ending to Romeo and Juliet at the start of the play, but people still pay attention.  Again, sorry for the spoiler, but you'll still love watching the rest."
TheWire,3c1htp,Mkcn97,0,Sat Jul 4 02:40:42 2015 UTC,No problem. The Barksdale crew so far is the most intriguing thing to me in the whole show. McNulty started getting on my nerves in season 2.

TheWire,3c09pr,HeWhoCouldBeNamed,8,Fri Jul 3 16:26:27 2015 UTC,"It's satire. Cracked is all about overanalyzing anything to the point of realizing its boring. Because you can do that with anything. Half the arguments are bs anyways.  e.g. ""Look at NYPD, last 10 years, they've fired less than 100 bullets per year... Even the Wire upped the body count after Season 2.""  Except that they are comparing Baltimore (a city that currently has one of the highest murder rates in the nation) to New York City, a city that has dramatically cleaned up in the last 20 years. I like to look at this website every now and then. This is just one page of the site, but it shows all of the homicides in Baltimore during the year of 2014. It's pretty much all shooting victims and the occasional stabbing.  Then he talks about things like homicide clearance rates, budget bullshit, and other things, but all things that were addressed in the Wire.  Pretty much after the first 2 minutes he stops talking about The Wire and moves on to just all the other unrealistic cop shows."
TheWire,3c09pr,Cpt_Tsundere_Sharks,3,Fri Jul 3 17:28:58 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. Comparing NYC to Baltimore, in particular, is just silly, but I thought the whole thing was interesting."
TheWire,3c09pr,brav3h3art545,3,Fri Jul 3 17:33:57 2015 UTC,They even compare NYC's murder rate Blatimore's in The Wire (IIRC it was season 3 when Burrell and Rawls were chewing out their majors for not getting their murders down)
TheWire,3c09pr,TheDeadManWalks,3,Fri Jul 3 21:56:39 2015 UTC,"Right. That's one of the things where they were wrong about The Wire, but pointed out the same thing: solving murders is hard. There was always a lot of red on the board. That's one of the things CSI: Navy: Hawaii glosses over."
TheWire,3c09pr,rychan,6,Fri Jul 3 22:00:56 2015 UTC,"Yes it's a joke, can we not rake OP over the coals for it? Even if he/she wasn't aware, it's still something Wire-related so I welcome it."
TheWire,3c09pr,w1nter,2,Fri Jul 3 19:01:00 2015 UTC,"We almost never see cops fire their weapons in The Wire and we constantly see them hamstrung by budget issues. How is what he says a rebuttal to The Wire?  The murder clearance rates in The Wire seem realistic, as well, based on the numbers given in this piece.  Also, the Wire constantly shows boring police work.  I don't doubt there are unrealistic elements to the wire. Two that come to mind are (1) The ease at which inmates have unmonitored conversations with visiting felons and (2) The fact that a reporter could fabricate coverage which gets Pulitzer level attention and not get caught.  Actually, (2) is really just one instance of the huge amount of cynicism in the show. If The Wire were an accurate portrayal of the behavior of people and institutions we would live in a truly awful world."
TheWire,3c09pr,sergiio333,2,Wed Jul 8 01:23:30 2015 UTC,"It almost sounds like they haven't seen The Wire, to be honest. My point was they point out all these unrealistic things, but The Wire is actually realistic in those parts. At least people who've watched the show notice that.  About the Pulitzer winning piece, there was a huge thing with a reporter who lied about being in a helicopter that was shot down in Iraq. Here it is. Not quite the same thing (we can all agree the whole serial killer portion of season 5 was a bit over the top), but maybe a kernel of truth? He embellished his own story. I can see all the folks at NBC getting very excited about it and the ratings must not have been too bad either."

TheWire,3c027i,Mrubuto,7,Fri Jul 3 22:43:31 2015 UTC,"A good distinction I like to make between The Wire and the other shows you watch is this.  The other shows are about telling a story.  Every episode is there for the purpose of progressing and furthering the story.  There isn't as much build-up because the stories are fast-paced and exciting.    The Wire is more like painting an all-encompassing work of art.  Zooming in at different parts of the painting tell their own stories.  It is meant to be viewed as a whole.  Most of the episodes in the season are spent giving parts of the painting more detail.  When the season is over, you get to step back and appreciate how all of these stories connect so very deeply with one another and how they tell a story larger than themselves.  Shows like Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones are a ride.  You will be entertained.  The Wire is less of that and more of showing how all the cogs in the great machine fit together.  For that reason, The Wire is my favorite series that I have ever seen."
TheWire,3c027i,avaliantheel,4,Fri Jul 3 21:42:55 2015 UTC,"I hate the fact that everyone compares The Wire with other shows like Breaking Bad, then you have fan wars ""No this one is the best blablabla"".  Forget about comparison, The Wire is a great, deep, and unique show, it can be seen as a very long movie, and the character development is so intense that when you finish these 5 seasons, you'll feel like there's a hole in your life.  Just watch it, don't read any reviews or spoilers, don't have any expectations from something you've seen before, it will be a brand new experience, and you will enjoy it.

It won't leave you at the credits saying, ""Oh my god, I can't believe the episode ends there, I need to watch the next one!"", but it's just as satisfying to binge watch because of its detailed continuity.  Because it's not as suspenseful or cliff-hanger-y as any of those, I'd recommend watching the first half of season 1 all in a row to really get an idea of its nature and what makes it so interesting."

TheWire,3bva79,monsieurxander,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:10:57 2015 UTC,That's not all that interesting. It's pretty common that gay men get married either denying that they are gay or as a cover for social and career reasons.

TheWire,3bva79,UncleBenjen,3,Thu Jul 2 18:35:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's quite subtle. There's a single scene where you see him at a gay club. If you happened to miss that scene, or simply forgot it, then there are no other indicators that he is homosexual."
TheWire,3bva79,wellgroomedmcpoyle,3,Thu Jul 2 19:12:50 2015 UTC,There is one other indicator involving Landsman in the bathroom after Bubbles pukes on him that's more subtle. Although without the previous scene that /u/theederv is talking about it wouldn't really be an indicator.
TheWire,3bva79,theederv,2,Thu Jul 2 19:42:24 2015 UTC,I've watched through three times and I didn't see this one so must be incredibly subtle.. Can you go into more detail - I need to know now!

TheWire,3bva79,b1eb,5,Thu Jul 2 22:36:06 2015 UTC,Exactly. The fact that Landsman looks at it and chuckles to himself which could be just because he thinks it's funny or that it's kind of an unspoken thing in the office that people know Rawls is a closet case. Since they included the scene in the gay bar I choose to believe it's the latter.

The fact that the thugs didn't recognize him just illustrates the nature of the game: you have to stay in it to be respected. You turn your back for a second, another person is going to be on your corners. Even though he technically ""won"" by not going to jail, the lack of name recognition is him losing in his own mind.

TheWire,3bu1wh,Propolandante,9,Tue Jul 7 05:17:44 2015 UTC,"Regarding his nickname of Black, they read it off of his file when they hear about Marlo early on. There are a couple of possible murders on him. Also, Bubbles says that Marlo ""goes by Black"" at one point in the show. I think it's a name he had earlier in his life that he's since abandoned, since he wants to be king, and for his true name to ring out. It did feel odd that they threw that detail out a couple of times, but never really did anything with it."
TheWire,3bu1wh,jortiz682,3,Thu Jul 2 05:43:19 2015 UTC,"""Nicknamed Black. That motherfucker's real."""
TheWire,3bu1wh,LondonNoodles,6,Thu Jul 2 07:49:24 2015 UTC,"As it was pointed out in another post (can't find it again now), Marlo has a real obsession with his name, and he deliberately mistakes other peoples names or give them degrading nicknames (he calls, Props Joe ""Fat man"", calls Bodie Brody ""-You know my name!"", calls Michael ""the boy"", etc), then of course there is the scene in the prison with Chris where Marlo gets upset (for the 1st time in fact) and says ""My name is my name!!!""  My understanding of the whole thing is that Marlo is extremely narcissic, and obsessed by his reputation, and Chris and Snoop knowing that, they deliberately hide from him the fact that Omar is calling his name on the streets (because they know Marlo will lose his mind on this, like Avon did!).  So what String would have thought is a ""victory"" (clean business, loads of money, and name forgotten about) is actually a defeat for Marlo.  That also echoes with the conversation between Avon and String on the rooftop, the day before String got shot.  You can see a parallel across the 5 seasons, around the idea that people can never truly change ""The King Stay The King"". You see that with McNulty who tried to become different but couldn't, Kima who tried to give up on field work but couldn't, but also on a positive side : carver who got corrupt for a while but eventually became his honest self again, Namond who is good inside, got dragged into the game, and eventually got out of it as it was ""not him"", etc.  Of course this is just how I see things, happy to hear different opinions, this show is full of introspective mechanics and philosophy."

TheWire,3bu1wh,chappersyo,3,Thu Jul 2 20:06:15 2015 UTC,"For the second question, the two thugs Marlo beats down are talking about how Omar went down in a spray of bullets or something.

When Marlo and his crew first get locked up, Chris tells him that Omar was calling him out in the street before he died. This clearly bothered Marlo because it meant that he lost respect. Now at the end, Levi is trying to turn him legit, but Marlo clearly feels out of place. I think the scene on the corner was him realizing that, despite his success as a drug dealer, nobody recognized or feared him the way they did Avon or Stringer or Omar. They didn't recognize him for the same reason that he avoided going to prison: he was always behind the scenes. And I think that this bothered him in the end"

TheWire,3bq02l,theaccountismine,5,Wed Jul 1 05:35:13 2015 UTC,"Some other parallels between Hoop Dreams and The Wire are interesting. For example:   Both were basically snubbed by their respective highest-profile awards academies. I assume most everyone here knows that The Wire never won an Emmy. Similarly, Hoop Dreams wasn't even nominated for the Oscar for best documentary, let alone best picture. Both had considerable, high-profile critical accolades. This should go without saying for The Wire. For Hoop Dreams, Roger Ebert in particular aggressively championed the movie. He named it his top movie of 1994—and that was a year that also saw the release of movies from Pulp Fiction to The Shawshank Redemption to The Lion King to Forrest Gump. (Hell, he later even went on to name Hoop Dreams the best movie of the 1990s!) Both were stories (primarily) about black, inner-city people, but without trying to sensationalize or sermonize. (I respect each of the following movies, but this is in contrast to movies like Boyz n the Hood or Do the Right Thing.) Both tell stories that avoid ""happy endings"", though certainly The Wire is far grimmer than Hoop Dreams. Both tell stories that are very much grounded in reality. Hoop Dreams, being a documentary, is obviously ""real"". And though The Wire was fiction, it was fiction drawn from years of real-life observation of Baltimore by (among others) those who worked there as reporters, cops, criminals, and teachers. Neither is set in either New York or Los Angeles. David Simon, creator of The Wire, has specifically called out New York City for its municipal vanity and parochialism. Both benefit immensely from the amount of time spent with the characters to tell as complete as possible a story. After all, Hoop Dreams tracked the Gates and Agee families for at least four to five years, at least through their entire high school years."

I'll be sure to work through the blog when I'm done with the book.  I realize I'm preaching to the converted here in this subreddit but I have to say I love how Simon and The Wire tie together the complexities of a major city and reveal that it's not easy to just say that the police are good/bad, the politicians are good/bad, the teachers are good/bad, the kids are good/bad, etc. etc.  It's far more gray than we'd like to think.  And it's difficult to tell someone to just go and watch the news or go to college or whatever.  But I think shows like The Wire are a good place to start to show people that complexity. And it's entertaining too!  To borrow a theme from the show, it's almost like you're tricking people into learning. Haha."

The stories of the real life Bunk and Landsman are fucking great, against a very depressing investigative backdrop.  You should check out The Corner next, David Simon's second non-fiction book. It's a lot sadder but it gives a great literary look into the lives of those living in Baltimore's killing streets."
TheWire,3bluhp,Expendable_Hostage,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:16:11 2015 UTC,I also just finished my third rewatch of The Wire and I finished reading Homicide last week. The book is just fantastic and really gives you a complete understanding of what it is like for a homicide detective in Baltimore. I'm planning on reading The Corner as well which I've heard is also great.

Then I watched the series, and is also great. Baltimore looks really old and vintage in that show.   Then I read the corner. Great companion to both. And then finally, I started reading  George Pelecanos novels, and they read like wire script a lot of time. I would recommend all of that above."

I was a few years ahead of you at Edmondson, but I know you remember the neighborhood, how it was. We had some bad boys, for real. Wasn't about guns so much as knowing what to do with your hands. Those boys could really rack. My father had me on the straight, but like any young man, I wanted to be hard too, so I'd turn up at all the house parties where the tough boys hung. Shit, they knew I wasn't one of them. Them hard cases would come up to me and say, ""Go home, schoolboy, you don't belong here."" Didn't realize at the time what they were doing for me. As rough as that neighborhood could be, we had us a community. Nobody, no victim, who didn't matter. And now all we got is bodies, and predatory motherfuckers like you.

Marlo represents corporate ruthlessness filling in a power vacuum, and Avon only notices Avon once he loses his towers.

He was a previous suspect in an unsolved case for Homicide Detective Vernon Holley; Holley believed it was Marlo who killed his only witness as well as the original victims, yet no evidence could be traced back to him. The Barksdale Organization already had all the prime territory on the westside in the form of the public housing towers and Avon showed little interest to the street corners. Marlo's established rule and reputation is only noticed by the returning Barksdale dealers and soldiers when the towers are demolished by City Hall and Avon wishes to return to their roots, escalating an all-out war over the best territory of the westside.

TheWire,3b28b7,dilplunk,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:45:16 2015 UTC,"IMO this show isnt really even strictly a police show.   Its a police show first hand, but really it's about life in the city of Baltimore. When a show tackles journalism, street life, schools, docks, and police, then you know that there is much more to the wire than the police.   This is what seperates The Wire from other clichè cop shows like NCIS, CSI, chicago code, law and order, etc. It actually fleshes out other characters besides the cops, every episode doesnt end with the thug getting locked up, killed, etc."

I think the realism and related complexity of the show is what makes it critically acclaimed but also what makes the show difficult to digest for a vast majority of the population.  Anyhow, what I remember from the commentary when the show came out was how real it was... Real-world members of the streets, the police, the court system, school system, newspaper, etc. would all comment how The Wire, more than any other show, makes everything look and feel and sound like the real thing.

TheWire,3b0pj3,Cpt_Tsundere_Sharks,17,Thu Jun 25 01:03:46 2015 UTC,"I doubt he had the ability to take out Marlo, because Stanfield had too many resources and could have just walled himself up if it came to that.  But he definitely could have done a ton of damage.  Hell, he was already a serious thorn in Marlo's side.  Omar in many ways represented a force of nature in the show.  Go back and watch that season and you'll see that even Snoop and Chris were a bit intimidated by him.  He wasn't being sloppy, he was being unpredictable.  He was doing things that no one expected.  And it was working.  Kenard wasn't even on the radar to Omar.  That's why he died.  He lost to a true wild card in the game.  I think even he would have seen some poetic justice there, had he survived the gunshot.  But, gun to my head?  I think the money was almost 50/50.  I'd trend towards Marlo and crew getting him because they had more resources, but only after Omar did a ton of damage to their hegemony.  The fear he instilled alone was enough to carry him through 4.5 seasons of the show.  He survived the Barksdale reign, the law attempting to put him away, and any number of gunfights.  Only something crazy like a kid shooting him ended that, not guile or cunning by the kingpins of Baltimore."
TheWire,3b0pj3,CryHav0c,14,Thu Jun 25 02:23:01 2015 UTC,"But Marlo had the fatal flaw of too much pride. If he had known that Omar was calling him out, I think that Marlo would have went straight at him and gotten himself killed. Omar's plan was simple, elegant and would have worked if Snoop and Chris had told Marlo what was happening on the street."
TheWire,3b0pj3,leveraction1970,5,Thu Jun 25 03:58:39 2015 UTC,"Well said. You KNOW Omar wasn't going out shooting or running the streets.   Might be stretching, but 'man's got to have a code' and the theme of the new generation of bangers lacking one was part of his downfall. 'He's just a boy' ~ Omar"
TheWire,3b0pj3,Trying_To_Contribute,6,Thu Jun 25 02:57:03 2015 UTC,"He just underestimated how early the game was taking hold.  Even Kenard was operating within certain rules/codes, he wasn't going out gunslinging and was just trying to move up in the ranks of respect."
TheWire,3b0pj3,CryHav0c,8,Thu Jun 25 03:02:04 2015 UTC,"Let me start by saying, everyone gets got on the street, that's the game, regardless of what piece you are on the chess board.  ""I can find your people a whole lot easier then they can find me"" ~ Omar  Yea Omar was going to get put down eventually, (that's the game) question was could he get to Marlo first. And it was clear from the prison scene (my name is my name!) that his tactics had merit.  With Marlo on the street Omar would have taken his shot, win or lose, he was going to get a chance to step tooo. And that's a W for Omar.  BONUS Discussion: you know he wasn't going out shooting. The fact that he was popped doing the only routine thing he does all season (getting a pack of Newports and maybe some Honey Nut) is a testament to the shows writing."
TheWire,3b0pj3,Trying_To_Contribute,7,Thu Jun 25 02:49:28 2015 UTC,"Worth noting that, for as reckless as Omar gets at the end, it's clear by the end of season 5 that had Marlo known that Omar was calling him out, it is likely that he would have been as reckless as Omar had become.   But, to approach this from another perspective, Omar's death is predetermined because of the mythos of his character within the show––beginning in season 3, when kids begin to ""play Omar."" He's the hero whose exploits will live on in memory and renown––it will ""ring out"" in all of the ways that Stringer and later Marlo would give up on. Ironically, Omar comes closest to winning the game precisely by losing it.   The real question is, since Michael picks up his mantle, is his end the same as Omar's? And, for that matter, is Michael's beginning anything like Omar's?"
TheWire,3b0pj3,longus318,18,Thu Jun 25 05:18:06 2015 UTC,no. Snoop and Chris would have taken him out. as soon as he started walking around Baltimore with a limp it was game over. Kenard just got the jump on everyone.

TheWire,3b0pj3,johnycake,11,Thu Jun 25 01:41:36 2015 UTC,"Did he abandon his stealth tactics though? Every time he went after someone he had it thought through and never went in head on.  First one he didn't have a gun so he grabbed a bottle off the street and held it to the back of his head so it seemed like he was strapped before stealing the pistol out of his pants. Next one he surprised with a shotgun. After that he was waiting outside for the stash house guys to get lunch before he blew them away. The last corner before the end he got the police to take away the muscle from the corner before he easily creeped up on them and took the stash.  Other than the limp, I don't see your argument anywhere."
TheWire,3b0pj3,hostage_puffing,5,Thu Jun 25 03:43:19 2015 UTC,"The Wire's realism would've come into play and Omar would have lost. Just like no last minute hero comes in to save Wallace (which traditionally happens in other shows) Omar could not have taken on the most powerful drug Kingpin in Baltimore- especially with a broken leg.  Yes Omar is smart because he's much older and experienced than Chris and Marlo, but I think people overestimate Omar's abilities. Chris and Snoop are well trained killers and Marlo is probably just as good (though we don't get to see it.)   There's no way Omar could have beaten them. The Wire prides itself on realism and there's no way one man with a broken leg can kill B-more's most wanted"
TheWire,3b0pj3,johnycake,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:53:11 2015 UTC,"I agree. I even think Kenard doing it was kind of to show how Omar had become emotional, very emotional. To the point he was killing when he didn't need to as far as his code would be concerned. I think Kenard was a representation of how open Omar was to be picked off like that. He lost his battle when he got emotional in his work."
TheWire,3b0pj3,DrunkVelociraptor5,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:17:06 2015 UTC,Agreed. We knew Omar's emotion's were his fatal flaw when Brandon died back in season 1. He could never hold back his vengeance

TheWire,3b0pj3,doomrabbit,6,Thu Jun 25 19:15:39 2015 UTC,"Did he really have what it took to take out Marlo after he jumped off that balcony?    At first, I was about to say ""No,"" but now that I think about it, I think Omar would have been clever enough to find a way to get at Marlo and take him down.  Of course, as many have mentioned, his brazen attitude is what exposed him to getting got by Kenard.  And at that point you start to think about the underlying issues:   If Marlo was the goal, then why did Omar expose himself so publicly?   Then I reach a point where I think:   Killing Marlo was not the only goal.   The goal?   I think killing Marlo's reputation on the streets was the goal. Actually murdering Marlo would be a cherry on top.   From the Barksdale family to Marlo to the kids on the street to the people with political aspirations: The idea of having ""your name ring out"" was tantamount. Street credibility above all.  So, in a way, Omar did kill Marlo.  In the series finale, you see Marlo leave a ""downtown"" party and go to the streets -- suit and tie and all -- and take a corner on his own. When he approaches that corner, the kids are talking about Omar with reverence. Omar is a legend. Meanwhile, the ""Marlo"" name is forgotten.  And that's what will ""kill"" Marlo.  Hell, Marlo wouldn't have been able to even rebuild his reputation because one hint of him being back in the game and the police would swarm all over him, the case against him that was put on hiatus would be pulled off the shelf, Marlo would be charged, sent to jail and ultimately unable to rebuild anything. He'd go to jail with Avon, Bey, Chris, etc. and still remain a small fish compared to Avon. Even killing Avon in prison would only raise his stature in prison and not on the streets.  As for Omar? His job is done one way or another:   He calls out Marlo for being a bitch and has a confrontation? Marlo is dead because he has to face Omar one-on-one and not with the help of his muscle especially with the shit that Omar was spreading around on the street. You can't have the people on the streets saying that Marlo was bailed out by his muscle. But even if Marlo gets Omar in a one-on-one, I think Omar's constant presence in the streets will still make him legendary; Still make him bigger than Marlo in name.   Either way, Marlo is dead figuratively and/or literally.  Omar is Robin Hood. An outlaw with his own code.  For Omar, ""Let justice be done, though the heavens may fall."""
TheWire,3b0pj3,Trying_To_Contribute,6,Sun Jun 28 07:15:04 2015 UTC,"Where there is life, there is possibility. I've always seen it as Omar taking a gigantic risk in jumping off the ledge over the certainty of death via gunfire. Everything after that was the same survival instinct driving him on. The situation was bad, but you keep on persevering. You live in the moment.  Kenard's sudden betrayal is unexpected, but the gunshot to the side of the head is a recurring theme in the show. It's symbolic of the chess theme. Note the L-shaped path that Omar takes to the counter, still a part of the game to the end. Omar's desperation is that he knows the game will get him, the piper must be paid. The when and who are the unknown. He never even looks at Kenard. His guard is down, and his sunny optimism is gone. He is a man resigned, rather than living like a scared rabbit.   Omar never runs."
TheWire,3b0pj3,Simcolluk,13,Thu Jun 25 01:26:07 2015 UTC,"I never bought the theory that he just let his guard down or ""underestimated"" Kenard. Omar has a strict code, he doesn't go after anyone who isn't in the game, especially women and children. Kenard just looks like a child to him. Shit, he is a child. By the way Kenard looks, Omar never would have tried to kill him."
TheWire,3b0pj3,Qawi9,4,Thu Jun 25 01:39:02 2015 UTC,It's a sentence/theme that's been explored before in the show. 'He's just a kid' comes up when Omar spots Michael for the first time.  Speaks to the depravity of their situation

TheWire,3as68i,Grantetons,3,Tue Jun 23 17:23:34 2015 UTC,"Avon gave him the initial bank. Deacon still hooked him up with the right people to get legit money too.   Many organizations get support from government to run if they have a social mission. Cutty's gym clearly had a positive impact, I wouldn't be surprised if he got some money rolling in. Especially since he has a contact who knows people who will sign the paperwork to get him a little bit of money for it."
TheWire,3as68i,MortyMcMorston,0,Tue Jun 23 17:56:55 2015 UTC,"Deacon introduced him to the leader of the ministers, who then introduced him to Odell Watkins, who then hooked him up with Marla Daniels to get her feet wet in public service. So Marla is the only one who took direct action aside from introductions, and her involvement wasn't monetary. It's possible that donations are made through the church, but that means it's the congregation showing financial support, not the individuals who helped him set it up legally. The only way the gym functions financially is through community support, because it's not for profit."
TheWire,3as68i,Grantetons,-1,Tue Jun 23 18:58:52 2015 UTC,"Maybe I got it wrong in the U.S, but I assume that NPO's also get financial aid from government institutions.  I know it's not the same, but in Canada when you're an NPO you can apply for funding and if you've got the right paperwork filled out properly, are applying for funding for the right kind of social initiative, have good contacts or a certain amount of luck. You'll get support.  Considering Baltimore's #1 problem is drugs and Cutty's gym is directly helping with that. Then he's likely to get the funding.  Once again I agree that it's not stated openly on the show. But it's heavily hinted."
TheWire,3as68i,MortyMcMorston,7,Tue Jun 23 19:25:13 2015 UTC,"This is one of the big things that always got me. We like to see Cutty as a person who has done 'right' in the Hood, one who never fell into the drug game and got out as soon as he saw how bad it was, when in reality he was just insanely lucky.   A random 15k from Avon? His grandmother was still able to take him in? If these things didn't happen, he would be desperate for money and would have probably stayed in Avons crew. One of the biggest reasons why people join gangs or deal drugs is for money, Cutty was just lucky enough that he had not one, but two people financially supporting him."

The city usually won't just support the gym and pay for the kids to use the equipiment and get trained. They'd much sooner pay for fostercare. If you look closely at certain scenes with Cutty in the gym, you can see a few adult TRAINERS FOR CHRISTS SAKE. Cutty has to pay the other trainers also. Take it from someone who knows first hand.  Also, the city did not help cutty out. He picked kids up from the street, got their moms involved (another form of sallary to cutty) and generated money his own way.   You guys really think cutty would have a boxing gym and would just train kids for fun/to get them off the streets? And have no financial benefit from it at all?   Wow."

I think Michael's father had molested him at some point too. He is extremely upset after Cutty keeps attempting to find him in the streets to come box. Michael says something like, ""Everybody always too nice and shit."" Chris connected with Michael through this and then some of his own rage came out on Michael's dad.

TheWire,3aorv2,SweaterMop,6,Mon Jun 22 15:12:33 2015 UTC,"Copying my comment from a few months ago:   Bug's dad molested Michael when he was younger. He then went to prison for something unrelated, and Michael became the father figure in his household. The abuse also instilled in Michael an intense distrust of adult men (think of his interactions with Cutty, Marlo, and Mr. Pryzbylewski).  When Bug's dad comes home, Michael not only hates him for what he did to him, but fears for his younger brother, Bug. After feeling like there was no way of getting rid of Bug's dad through institutional means (go to the police, or contact social services), he turns to the only option he has left: murder.  And check out the scene where Snoop asks Michael why he wants the man killed. Michael doesn't say, but Chris seems to immediately understand. It's heavily implied that Chris was also molested as a boy. This is why Chris accuses Bug's dad of touching kids, and beats him to death so brutally (and carelessly).  Minor spoilers ahead, if you haven't watched further (if you haven't finished the show yet, please don't visit the sub!):  Also, later in the show, when Bunk is trying to put Chris, Snoop, and Michael in for murders, he does some detective work and finds that Bug's dad likely molested Michael some years ago (I think it was from documentation of a visit from Child Protection Services). He asks Michael about it in the interrogation room, and even though Michael doesn't budge we can see that it's the truth."
TheWire,3aorv2,Propolandante,2,Mon Jun 22 21:10:47 2015 UTC,"I think that it is clear in Michael's response to Dennis and his feelings about Bug's dad, as well as in Chris' emotional reaction that they were both molested. So that's my own presupposition to start with.  But to stop and marvel for a moment at the storytelling of Simon and his staff––the very subtleness of this itself communicates and conveys the culture that they are describing. This is NOT a culture where this kind of thing can ever even be spoken. And that goes for the audience too.

Just eventually the game play the game role shared by Omar, but only after his time with Marlo. Michael was human, even still a kid when we saw him at the beginning of SEA5, not really your typical ""ruined"" child molested character. To be clear, I don't believe a person is ruined through an experience like that, just that a certain narrative is exposed through such a traumatic experience.

TheWire,3amgkr,hostage_puffing,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:34:34 2015 UTC,Ooh right on. Just wanted to clarify in case of otherwise. My bad.
TheWire,3amgkr,joeinthebox,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:34:45 2015 UTC,"Nice points that got me thinking and rambling...  Upon watching the series for the first time many years ago, then watching it again a few years later and then rewatching it once again very recently, I have come to really like what the McNulty character shows.  Originally, I just saw McNulty the way many people do: A tragic hero.  Many, I'm sure, have also concluded that McNulty is caught in this world where knowing what you are good at doing could be the thing that kills you. Or, to be less dramatic, could simply be something that you don't want to do.  As a big sports and music fan, I have tied the McNulty character to sports and pop-culture.  Too often do you see kids steered towards professional sports because it's what they are good at. So good that they are pushed towards it even if they don't want to do it. But they are pressured to do it for their families or for the greater good.  You often see it in music as well whether it's the story of Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys or Kurt Cobain of Nirvana.  And I think these sorts of complexities in life that is revealed in The Wire is another reason why the show is good damn good.  The Wire constantly puts characters in the position and pressure of doing what is right for the individual and doing what is right for the greater good at the cost of that individual.   Namond doesn't want to run a corner but he has to in order to support his moms and uphold his family name. McNulty is a talented murder police but his knack for solving murders for the greater good may end up killing him. Bubbles usefulness as an informant (a thing that once gave him great pride) was the thing that would keep him on the streets and using.   Etc. etc.  There are many reasons why The Wire is great but one of my favorite things about The Wire is the complexities that The Wire reveals.   Your brilliance and talent that helps the greater good may come at the cost of your own self. Doing the right thing for yourself may not be the right thing for someone else or even the greater good.   It's crazy philosophical battles that people face on a daily basis in that show from the journalists, to the politicians, to the teachers, to the cops, to the kids on the streets.  The sad thing is that any attempt to enact true change (as reflected in Bunny Colvin) is crushed.  Any attempt to live by your own code is rebuffed by society as a whole unless you're prepared to die by the code as well.  I see parallels between McNulty and Omar as well. Both buck the system but they also live by their own moral code that is based in -- what I feel -- is a good place in their heart. But the life of a crusader and a future martyr is also shown as heart-wrenching and lonely. The reward doesn't seem as great as one thinks when embarking on a crusade.  McNulty, ultimately, didn't have the stomach for it. He saw his future and decided to choose life.  Omar, on the other hand, cut from the same crusader cloth as McNulty, accepted that his life will likely end tragically but he was committed to do what had to be done.  I've rambled enough already... but you'll have to excuse me because I only recently finished another rewatch of the series and all this is fresh in my mind. Haha."
TheWire,3ank3u,A-Terrible-Username,9,Sun Jun 21 23:39:34 2015 UTC,"They basically give you snippets over the course of the series. Basically Daniels came up in a bad unit, a dirty unit, with a corrupt sergeant (this is why Daniels later tells Carver that the low guys on the totem pole take all their cues from their sergeant - if the sergeant is bad, they'll be bad). It's implied he took a LOT of money - I think at one point someone says when they looked at his assets, he had hundreds of thousands more than any cop in his position should. It seemed to be what Herc and Carver did when they took some money for themselves when they were seizing drug money during a raid, just on a larger scale.  The FBI investigated it and turned the evidence over to Burrell, but he just sat on it, basically as blackmail/extortion that Burrell can hold over him."
TheWire,3ank3u,jmarFTL,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:43:38 2015 UTC,thanks for asking. i was wondering the same thing. i am rewatching the series and the FBI dude told McNulty Daniels was dirty...but I never found out why/how...
TheWire,3ank3u,69sucka,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:43:47 2015 UTC,Or how dirty?
TheWire,3ank3u,joeinthebox,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:52:34 2015 UTC,"Just to echo the comment made already, yes, there was a snippet somewhere in Season 5 where either Rawls or Burrell stated that Daniels was part of a drug-enforcement unit that was skimming money recovered during raids.  And I think it was a big deal because it seemed as if it was more than just a one time thing. In fact, the implication seemed that it was systemic. And there was large amount of money involved, hence, the FBI investigation.  That, of course, calls into question Daniels' credibility and his motivations for his raids: true police work? or for the money?  Although, I have a feeling that Daniels wasn't running the show or ever that deep into it. I think by the time he got to a leadership position in that particular district, the system was already in place and there was nothing he could do about it and he just let it happen. Of course, since it was ""found out"" on his watch, he may have been implicated as either the ring-leader or the fall-guy.  But, as we've seen throughout The Wire, it doesn't matter what is actually true or not. It's what people have heard on the streets and in the corridors and what they believe.  And the lessons Daniels learned from that was passed down to Carver early in the series which sets the tone and direction for the Carv storyline throughout the series."

TheWire,3albbf,pulp47,8,Sun Jun 21 13:39:50 2015 UTC,I always thought that this motive was less altruistic then he was portraying it to be as well. That he basically was looking for a way to get back into the homicide detective lifestyle and was using this dead woman as a reason to do so.

Of course he didn't mean to dump them on Bunk and Freamon.   3) (And probably the real reason) he really only says to Bunk when they're drunk down on the train track - ""I dunno, guess it was a way of me pretending I was still a murder police."""

The series opened with Bubbles as an junkie and informant, I don't remember them ever introducing him or anything. He'd been working with them.  Here's Ep 3 of S1.. Same episode he talked about how he put the hats on the dealers. Kima already knows him and calls him Bubs. I haven't watched season 1 in a while, but I think this is the first episode you see him interact with police, which would indicate he was giving them information before the series started."

Like there was no follow-up on the scene, Sherrod just died and Bubbles was left crying and it moved on.

TheWire,3ah3wh,niceloner10463484,5,Sat Jun 20 03:10:22 2015 UTC,"Even though in Baltimore, it's not uncommon for any given police oficer to be black, I think making the most despicable cop be black was a very conscious decision by Simon and his co-writers -- and a good one. Or at least, understandable and consistent with how Simon thinks about things. A common criticism of The Wire is that it doesn't give racism enough of a role in the dynamic of injustice. Simon's belief, more or less, has been that yes, racism is bad, but it's outweighed by all the other evils and motivations behind injustice.  And Walker is the perfect embodiment of that. Because he's black, you think he'll have more empathy for the neighborhoods he patrols. But he's actually more vicious and unprofessional, and it's because race isn't always the primary reason for abuse of power. Yet it's the easiest to fixate on.  During the Baltimore riots, Simon mused on this in an interview with the Marshall Project: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/04/29/david-simon-on-baltimore-s-anguish   How does race figure into this? It’s a city with a black majority and now a black mayor and black police chief, a substantially black police force.  What did Tom Wolfe write about cops? They all become Irish? That's a line in “Bonfire of the Vanities.” When Ed and I reported “The Corner,” it became clear that the most brutal cops in our sector of the Western District were black. The guys who would really kick your ass without thinking twice were black officers. If I had to guess and put a name on it, I’d say that at some point, the drug war was as much a function of class and social control as it was of racism. I think the two agendas are inextricably linked, and where one picks up and the other ends is hard to say. But when you have African-American officers beating the dog-piss out of people they’re supposed to be policing, and there isn't a white guy in the equation on a street level, it's pretty remarkable. But in some ways they were empowered. Back then, even before the advent of cell phones and digital cameras — which have been transforming in terms of documenting police violence — back then, you were much more vulnerable if you were white and you wanted to wail on somebody. You take out your nightstick and you’re white and you start hitting somebody, it has a completely different dynamic than if you were a black officer. It was simply safer to be brutal if you were black, and I didn't know quite what to do with that fact other than report it. It was as disturbing a dynamic as I could imagine. Something had been removed from the equation that gave white officers — however brutal they wanted to be, or however brutal they thought the moment required — it gave them pause before pulling out a nightstick and going at it. Some African American officers seemed to feel no such pause."

Surely even if the Dawgs are gone, the Katz (as far as I know, a hypothetical fictional gang) are going to take their territory, but while they're working on that there's some wiggle room for people with better intentions to move in.

He has to do the dirt and kiss political butt and a greedy Clay Davis happened the one he chose.   Sure String had lost a ton of money.
