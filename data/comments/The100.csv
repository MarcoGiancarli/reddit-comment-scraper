Given that their immune systems should have just fallen over the first time they were exposed to a particularly nasty pathogen it's a massive plot hole.  Re A) - the short version from my perspective is that going into the mountain was actually suicide. They could have had a couple of machine guns mounted on the next floor down and taken out their army no problem. They took the safe option, their people were free and the mountain had promised to leave them alone. Tactically it was the right decision for the grounders. The mountain have more ability to wipe them out than the sky folk."

If Kane or Jaha would have been Chancellor then they'd probably have recognized the right steps and done it but at that point usurper Abby had already taken over."
The100,3e33ts,Jay013,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:56:41 2015 UTC,"My understanding of the situation was that the Grounders don't want to kill the 100 for scorching their soldiers, that'd be too easy, they want to torture them. However, when the kid was complaining about being tired/thirsty, I think Tristan figure ""What's the point?"" along with being just generally angry about the massacre and killed him. I'm not sure what you mean by the Bellamy part. Not sure on this one, I guess we can just assume Clarke and Abby are better doctors then we've seen. (Not to say that their bad per se) I really thought Jaha was dead when he was left on the Ark, the whole missile thing is a little out of place, but believable in my eyes. He knew every square inch of that ship and how it worked, so I don't think its completely far fetched. This is a qualm that is discussed endlessly on this sub. It comes down to the fact that the army at the end of the season had no idea what was behind those doors. JR even confirmed that he originally wrote a scene where two sub machine guns mowed down a large chunk of the army when the main door was opened, but it was cut due to budgetary reasons. That being said, that was Lexa's rationality. She could either save some people (her own), or no one. I do think it was a cowardly move, but in the end it made sense. Floating people was primarily implemented to save oxygen. After getting to the ground, that wasn't the priority anymore. The Arkers got much more humane when they landed on the ground as the plot shifted more towards survival on Earth. Saving Finn is the natural, human thing to do. I hope I understood what you were getting at, your wording kind of confused me."

The100,3e33ts,Shotokanguy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:42:08 2015 UTC,"Hey, Grounderologist here (Don't quote me on that). I think I can help answer some of these questions.   Tristan captured Nameless and Finn because after suffering the loss of 300 soldiers, he needed reason to be able to face Commander Lexa, or be deemed weak In Grounder culture, weak is not something you want branded on you, especially by Heda. By bringing Finn as a prize, has a chance to make a case to move against the rest of the 100. Nameless was killed because he was too weak, and Tristan was being his normal warrior self. Bellamy wasn't killed because now he has two heads to deliver instead of one. If one is too weak, they die. But Tristan needs at least one. Remember, they're enemies. They can learn about their enemies from those they capture. Murphy is a god. His status as a deity flushes out any and all toxins in his body. This is why when he was given the virus, he was fine, but everyone else was dying. Again, don't quote me on this. Actual answer though, I don't have one. Jahesus. Nuff said. No not really. Jaha has a strong will to survive. He's determined. But you see him falter at times. Like the Hallucinations, or throwing Craig off the boat. Also, it was a missile fitted with a nuclear war head. It wasn't random as the Ark did use to carry weaponry back when it was in it's original 13 Stations during the War.   Other stuff   Ahh...The Great Debate. The answer to this is totally up to the viewer to decide. I've argued both for against the deal, and for it. There are many angles to look at and each angle means something else to everyone.  Floating was to conserve oxygen on the Ark. To remove those detrimental to the survival as a species. On the Ground, there was enough air for everyone, and the human species was alive. This time it was survival as a community."

Sure, in Finn's mind he was trying to find Clark, but it made no sense that they didn't just give him up and somehow still made him to be a hero. Raven also blamed Clark for releasing him of the torture he would've otherwise had, which also didn't make much sense...  The thing in general about the show that annoys me the most: The awful pop music sometimes, it has a great orchestral score in between, but the pop songs really take me out of the show a lot...  Other than that, I really enjoyed the show."
The100,3e0vwr,Shotokanguy,3,Tue Jul 21 20:24:09 2015 UTC,"The logistics of the whole bone marrow plot point was probably the only thing that negatively affected the whole story, but, as you said, the quality of the show is high enough that I can get over it not making total sense."

The100,3e0vwr,Kishara,2,Tue Jul 21 14:16:49 2015 UTC,"This is a fair and reasoned critique. Kane had the same issue. I think it was believable overall to me because of the other threats involved. They had been enslaving the grounders for a long while. The new faction sky crew had more tech than the grounders. There was a good chance that the end was here for the Mt Weather faction.   They killed all of Mt Weather and Bellamy said the reason why that had to happen is that they would never stop. Same logic can be applied to the sky people. By enslaving the Grounders and Sky crew right off and not being honest, Mt Weather probably burned up any hope of voluntary donation and put Mt Weather at serious risk."
The100,3e0vwr,Kishara,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:02:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the gene pool thing bothered me a bit more because the mountain men would die off any one generation anyway.

The100,3dut2k,Ninjalamb,15,Sun Jul 19 21:34:08 2015 UTC,I agree. I don't particularly care about Jaha's storyline to be honest.
The100,3dut2k,Wasilewski,6,Sun Jul 19 22:06:43 2015 UTC,Me neither. I don't think he should've made it to earth
The100,3dut2k,Ninjalamb,7,Sun Jul 19 22:28:17 2015 UTC,I think he'll die near the S3 finale. Then Camp Jahas name has meaning.
The100,3dut2k,Dikeleos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:01:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe they'll abandon Camp Jaha as a climax (mid-season or season's end) to become just another grounder clan. The 13th clan, if you will."

The100,3dut2k,Kishara,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:36:01 2015 UTC,I do like AI stories. I think it's an interesting subject. But I think it feels out of place in The 100. Hopefully they'll change my mind about it in season 3
The100,3dut2k,Ninjalamb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:54:28 2015 UTC,They almost took it straight out of BSG.
The100,3dut2k,SuTvVoO,4,Mon Jul 20 23:27:05 2015 UTC,"Everyone on here appears to believe that everyone on the show is in immediate danger of dying at all times... the fact is, Wells is really the only one that was actually surprising to me. I mean they hung Murphy and sent him out into the forest alone and  he just kinda came back eventually. Once you have a man escape a space station in a missile and somehow land perfectly fine on the earth below you kind of lose credibility"
The100,3dut2k,bitterbear_,3,Sun Jul 19 22:49:48 2015 UTC,Clarke and Bellamy are the only ones I think are safe to the end.
The100,3dut2k,Dikeleos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:01:46 2015 UTC,"I think the fact that we lost what seemed to be a main character right off the bat in season 1 and again another in season 2 should be a warning to fans that JR is not screwing around. As a Raven fan, I know I am really worried that she is not safe as long as JR is on his murder rampage. The writers keep a memorial wall of all the characters they have killed and seem to feel great delight in adding to it. Following their twitter during the season is like being stabbed in the heart while someone is pulling out your guts."
The100,3dut2k,Kishara,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:04:50 2015 UTC,"It's just that yeah they HAVE killed off some important people, but much more often they put one into a horrible inescapable situation and then just keep them alive somehow. Like in season 1 when Jasper  (i think?) gets hit by a spear and just bounces back. If he died right there I would have more respect for the mortality of characters I think"
The100,3dut2k,bitterbear_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:19:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah the S1 thing with Jasper was badly done. They decided too late that they were keeping him. I remember how odd it was at the time to see that huge ass spear and then he lived. Clearly there have been a few oddball things, but overall I can pretty much forgive anything they do. Well, losing Raven would take some intensive therapy on my end but shy of that I can handle it."

The100,3dut2k,Kishara,2,Mon Jul 20 02:12:56 2015 UTC,"Hey, Elena. We differ strongly here. Id say it's more than that. Peeing on a guy for no reason (fun?) vs killing a bunch of people to save a whole bunch of others. Murphy got the tiniest amount of power and promptly abused it. Honestly though, I don't think the show sold me on his or Bellamy's transformations very well. Though I'd like to go back and watch again to see how I'd view them knowing what I know now."
The100,3dut2k,ChrisK7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:15:33 2015 UTC,"Hey Chris! Long time no see! I guess the point I was trying to make is that Bellamy is also a dick in the beginning who abuses his authority. So I guess its just interesting to me that the group changes how they see Bellamy, but keep insisting Murphy is an asshole, presumably so that they don't have to feel guilt for how they've treated him. I'm not complaining, because I think it's a perfect set up for future conflict. Murphy has ended up in the swishest place left on earth with probably the most insight into what happens next, but owes loyalty to no one.   As for the whole genocide thing, that's really about perspective. Yeah Clarke saved her people, but she also killed a whole lot of other innocent people too. It's still a horrific act even if it was done with the best intentions, so it'll be interesting to see how the show portrays her from S3 onward."
The100,3dut2k,ElenaOcean,6,Mon Jul 20 09:47:35 2015 UTC,"i think that octavia is pretty dumb and her relationship with lincoln is shallow as fuck. i was disappointed when lincoln turned out to be a ""good guy with good intentions"". i 100% expected him to keep octavia as a sex slave. it felt like she only trusted him cuz hes hot  jaha surviving was cheap.  i don't want clarke to hook up with anyone.  its about time people stop giving murphy shit, he killed least people there. hes the most realistic teenager of them all tbh  anya>>>>>lexa, anya shouldve lived  the whole diana arc was pretty unrealistic, felt like a twist for sake of a twist. at some point mindlessly killing hundreds of unnamed people gets old"
The100,3dut2k,_lilPoundcake,3,Mon Jul 20 03:54:49 2015 UTC,"I'm still convinced Sydney is alive, tbh. Them letting Jaha live pretty much killed suspension of disbelief, so I'm certain we'll be seeing her face again."

I don't really like Lincoln and Octavia together and loathed it in S1.  Again, not that unpopular but I am really annoyed that the writers had Clarke cut ties with pretty much all the other Sky People in the back half of S2.  I really love Abby.  I don't care about Grounder culture at all and am afraid that S3 is gonna be too Grounder focused.  I liked it better when the show revolved around the characters and not around the plot and I wish they would take more time to develop character relationships. That aren't Clarke and Lexa."
The100,3dut2k,mar33n,8,Sun Jul 19 19:27:17 2015 UTC,"You dislike like, all of the key elements of the show. I'm not sure why you watch. This is an interesting question."
The100,3dut2k,Kishara,8,Sun Jul 19 20:37:01 2015 UTC,"How? I like pretty much all the characters, I am obsessed with the relationships between the delinquents, I am 500% Bellamy/Clarke trash, Blake siblings are the bomb and Raven deserves all the happiness in the world.  Just because Grounders don't interest me doesn't mean I can't enjoy the rest of it. I just fell for the show in S1 and wish they would go back to basics a bit, like Monty, Harper, Kane, Octavia... those are the characters I fell for and I don't like that they're potentially getting sidelined for Grounders."
The100,3dut2k,Virgil_Reed,7,Sun Jul 19 21:10:38 2015 UTC,I don't like that they're potentially getting sidelined for Grounders.   Me too. I want to be done with the grounders and move on. I want the focus to remain on The 100. Period.  I give no fucks at all about the romance nonsense. I want to see more of the world they are living in.
The100,3dut2k,Kishara,4,Mon Jul 20 00:41:53 2015 UTC,I want to see more of the world they are living in   A world filled with and ruled by grounders...   Just saying.
The100,3dut2k,Harry_Ibbenese,3,Mon Jul 20 06:02:13 2015 UTC,We have seen this chapter though. Its a been there done that for me. There are other groups that survived and I am interested in them.
The100,3dut2k,WhoseRiverIsItAnyway,7,Mon Jul 20 14:08:22 2015 UTC,"I totally agree.  I feel like we've learned about as much about this particular band of Grounders as we need to.  I hope we get to meet other groups that have evolved in different, more interesting ways.    I also wish the show would cut back on the danger-oriented plot developments and give the characters a little time to breathe, have fun, and work on their relationships with each other."
The100,3dut2k,Virgil_Reed,5,Sun Jul 19 23:21:27 2015 UTC,"I really have to agree with your Grounder comment. We got two seasons of it already, I'm just getting tired of it. It was a jaw dropping reveal when we found out the kids weren't alone, but now it's just the entire show, when there's so much more that could be being explored."
The100,3dut2k,WhoseRiverIsItAnyway,0,Mon Jul 20 02:33:51 2015 UTC,"so much more that could be being explored   Not really... What people seem to be forgetting is that only ca 50 days passed since they landed. Really not much time to explore a whole lot of aspects. And I am actually looking forward to seeing more of the Grounders in S3, because we know next to nothing about their culture."
The100,3dut2k,FrostlyGrim,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:00:27 2015 UTC,No I'm saying like from here on out. I feel like they're wasting so much time on Grounder stuff that it feels like it's a Grounder show and not a show about the 100. I'm more referring to the fact that there's so much land that could be being explored in season three instead of Grounder culture. My favorite parts of the show this past season were the parts in the Deadlands and on the journey to the City of Light because it was refreshing to breakup the dense forest with the new landscape. It just feels like the show is trapped in the forests of Virginia.
The100,3dut2k,Kishara,10,Mon Jul 20 19:18:55 2015 UTC,"I don't like Bellarke, but I love Brollarke. They have no romantic/sexual chemistry at all. I'm on the fence about Jaha's story. I guess this is an unpopular opinion here but I want to see more Grounders and imo Lexa is going to be an important part of season three."
The100,3dut2k,FrostlyGrim,8,Sun Jul 19 22:50:20 2015 UTC,Isn't it crazy how we all see this in different ways?  To me Lexa was a minor plot point with no depth and I want to be done with the grounders and move full on into the AI.
The100,3dut2k,Kishara,7,Mon Jul 20 00:37:42 2015 UTC,"Yes it is. I believe it's in what you watch the show for. I find the Grounders and how the Arkers trying to survive more interesting than the AI. It doesnt help that Murphy and Jaha will have that plot. I don't relate to them as I do Bellamy, Clarke or Lexa.  I think (well hope) Lexa will have more depth next season as JR says the Grounders will be explored more."
The100,3dut2k,FrostlyGrim,2,Mon Jul 20 00:47:16 2015 UTC,Oh gosh when poor elena if she sees this. She is pretty in love with Murph. I think its kinda cool that it has diverse appeal like this tho. I just worry that JR may have so many bees in the hive at this point that it would be easy to make a mistake. He cannot possibly please all of us in 13 episodes. I worry  for him.
The100,3dut2k,ElenaOcean,2,Mon Jul 20 00:50:40 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what I'm afraid too lol. It's a small season and the cast number getting bloated. Obviously some characters are going to be taking a back seat (please don't be Raven again) and that scares me. :/
The100,3dut2k,Baryshnikov_Rifle,3,Mon Jul 20 00:57:56 2015 UTC,I'm a sucker for the underdog. And I really like the idea that Murphy will probably hold all the cards next season. The Grounder drama will just be a distraction while the AI plans to kill everyone. Knowing Murphy's luck he'll probably save the fucking world and no one will even notice.
The100,3dut2k,mar33n,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:13:38 2015 UTC,he'll probably save the fucking world and no one will even notice.    Even his bro Bellamy doesn't care about his disappearing act.
The100,3dut2k,FrostlyGrim,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:01:36 2015 UTC,"I respect your opinion, but god, the term Brollarke is just awful. All it does is piss fandom off."
The100,3dut2k,mar33n,8,Mon Jul 20 00:14:55 2015 UTC,Personally I think Brollarke is a good term. It separates the romantic shippers from the bro shippers who don't necessarily want to see the romantic aspect and gives the Bellarke shippers there own space to ship in peace.   For example I love Bellamy and Clarke's relationship but I generally don't want to read about the romantic stuff of them nor do I want be rude and talk negatively about that aspect in a pro Bellarke space. So I would use Brollarke instead of Bellarke.   I would also say it's better than that horrid clexabuse term people were spewing. Fandom with whine about anything though.
The100,3dut2k,Vortex_Gator,4,Mon Jul 20 00:35:45 2015 UTC,"God, don't even come near me with that clexabuse nonsense. I have never been more embarrassed to be part of a fandom.  I get that the Brollarke tag is being (mostly) used in a positive way, but the term was coined by this girl who is just awful and constantly bashes fans of Bellamy and Clarke's relationship. It definitely wasn't meant to be complementary, especially in the beginning people were really rude about it."

Do you root for Emerson as well?"

The100,3ds8fk,ShaneH7646,5,Sun Jul 19 00:29:35 2015 UTC,Monty is way to smart to be either Shaggy or Scooby Doo
The100,3ds8fk,RoughHands,3,Sun Jul 19 05:32:17 2015 UTC,"This isn't about their intellect; since all the members of the ark are gonna be above the current average IQ because we know they did some selective breeding up there, and they started with a pretty well off base of highly intelligent or ingenious populous.  But come on, what is one of the first things Monty and Jasper do when they get to Earth? They get the munchies so they go with Clarke to Mount Weather, build an alcohol still, and then they keep eatting the halogenic berry roots or whatever.  If there were stoners on the ark it would have been them.  And then Monroe is the tough one, up for anything. Like Velma but brawn instead of brain. Miller is male so he has to be Fred. And Harper seems the most helpless so she has to be Daphne.    ...Murphy is Scrappy Doo"
The100,3ds8fk,alextoria,4,Sun Jul 19 05:38:38 2015 UTC,this also fits with how Monty was in prison on the ark for growing marijuana iirc

For starters Scoobert ""Scooby"" Doo is a great dane that comes from a great family line, plus he can talk so hes like Einstein of the dog world. He has four toes on the bottom of his feat and opposable thumbs. He also has full control over his tail. He has accompanied Shaggy in all of his occupation except he was an full on actor instead of just an extra. He also has the 2nd most romantic game after shaggy, including almost getting there with an alien.   Norville ""shaggy"" Rogers is also the best person in the show, he comes from a loving family, he has a super rich jeweller uncle, and a famous archaeologist grand uncle. He is an extremely talented at: disguises, ventriloquism, mini golf, running (track), and gymnastics. He is also gets a lot of attention from the girls and is the only one of the gang to have serious relationships. He has had several detective jobs as well as: a paper boy, a movie extra, a carnival owner, a construction worker, a freelance journalist, a gym teacher, a race car driver, a customs officer, a volunteer zoo worker, he has also flown a plane. He also has a kick ass metabolism/work out since he constantly eats but is still light enough for Velma to pick him up. He and scooby are also the most brave among the gang, all of the monsters scare them far more than the rest of the gang however they always overcome their fear and usually act as live bait to save the day.

The100,3dvv5v,Jay013,10,Sun Jul 19 23:34:46 2015 UTC,This is the most backwards post I have ever seen. Usually people find it hard to get invested in the show because they don't particularly like the first few episodes but then grow to love it more with each new episode. It's definitely interesting how you feel and I respect your opinion but it does kind of baffle me if I'm to be honest lol
The100,3dvv5v,BlueOberries,2,Mon Jul 20 01:20:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its the complete opposite of how I see everyone else feel about it."
The100,3dvv5v,Dikeleos,-2,Mon Jul 20 06:05:05 2015 UTC,Well said
The100,3dvv5v,Shotokanguy,4,Mon Jul 20 02:33:22 2015 UTC,"That is an extremely vague and unreasonable opinion...uh...in my opinion...  Almost everyone who loves this show loves it because it surprised us so much as things changed, as characters grew, and as the show simply improved in quality. The original premise of the show is nothing extraordinary. The genre, or post apocalyptic concept, is more important than the whole ""100 kids sent to Earth to try to survive"" idea. And it's a natural progression for them to die off, and for the dying space station to eventually force the parents up in space to end up on the ground. No one could have predicted some of the things that have happened on this show so far, and we have no idea what's coming next. Frankly, I'm astounded that someone can go through all 29 episodes and find it unoriginal, or that there were ""unnecessary"" episodes."

The100,3dqgtn,spratisafish,7,Sat Jul 18 13:34:23 2015 UTC,"Well, they are also all children. And it's their parents that came down. And the kids weren't down there for that long. It was 10 days between the landing and Raven coming down. How long until the families came? Maybe a month, total?   It makes a lot of sense that they're being treated like that. It's frustrating for us because they made the kids the main characters and most of the demographic are young ish as well. They're our heroes and who we're supposed to identify with, who we're supposed to be rooting for.   It's a bunch of 15, 16, and 17 year olds that were put through the ringer and now the adults are here and things should go back to normal.

Why should a bunch of juvenile delinquants earn the right to rule an entire colony just because they survived on their own for a bit? It's not like all the adults are just going to hand the reigns over to them. They're a bunch of kids, of course they're not going to grant them any power."
The100,3dnrl9,Kishara,14,Fri Jul 17 19:43:56 2015 UTC,"Okay. Title guessing time.   Trigedasleng title. Wanheda.  First we need to divide the title into its root form. ""Wan"" and ""Heda""  Wan Op, a verb meaning die, is the root of the word wamplei, a noun meaning death.  Heda means leader.  Wanheda can be literally translated to dead leader. Of course, things in trigedasleng never literally translate. So from ""dead leader"" and what we know of what happened in the finale, I think we can come to the conclusion of ""leaderless""  We know Jaha is having cake with ALIE. We know Cage and Dante are dead. We know Clarke has gone rogue, and we know Lexa is headed back to Polis. Our leaders are gone.  So. Two options. Dead Leader or Leaderless.  That said, we still don't have a full lexicon of the trigedasleng language, and it's possible that the prefix ""wan"" could have an entirely different meaning in this case, but it is definite that in all cases we've seen ""Heda"" it's been used to say ""Leader""  Edit: Wan op is derived from slurred ""wind up"" so in the case that ""wan"" is a new prefix in this case to mean it's original form, it could be used to say New Leader. Seeing as Bellamy is stepping up, and we'll be seeing how a Grounder leader is chosen...But I doubt that ritual will occur in the first episodes.  Edit 2: For Leaderless they could have also used Nou Heda.  Edit 3: Dead Leader can either be a leader who is dead, or someone who leads the dead."
The100,3dnrl9,Jay013,8,Fri Jul 17 20:09:45 2015 UTC,"I think u/FrostlyGrim has the right idea, that clarke is the ""Death Leader.""  Or it will be very straightforward and Lexa will just die.   Guess we will find out when some more details are posted online."
The100,3dnrl9,doomstalker,18,Fri Jul 17 21:30:47 2015 UTC,If Lexa dies I will riot.   Not your normal riot. I mean advanced riot
The100,3dnrl9,Jay013,0,Fri Jul 17 21:32:27 2015 UTC,If Lexa dies. I will riot... I'm joy.
The100,3dnrl9,Fuarian,6,Mon Jul 20 17:29:36 2015 UTC,"Also the quote she says. ""I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."" Might be a reference."
The100,3dnrl9,FrostlyGrim,3,Fri Jul 17 21:41:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this show does have the tendency to reference things from previous episodes. If you watch the ign interview with Clarke, Bellamy and JR you can see that JR mentions this. It's practically his M.O."
The100,3dnrl9,doomstalker,3,Fri Jul 17 21:46:18 2015 UTC,"I agree that this is prob the title the grounders start calling Clarke... which would make sense since she has been dealing death in mass since she landed... (spoilers>>) burned a village with fireworks, the bridge explosion, the fight at the drop ship, the missile, the radiation"
The100,3dnrl9,Starbuck107,2,Fri Jul 17 22:48:22 2015 UTC,Ooh I like this idea a LOT. Makes a ton of sense. I think Lexa dying would be too obvious tbh

The100,3dnrl9,FrostlyGrim,0,Fri Jul 17 20:42:38 2015 UTC,"I know I have said it before but I will keep preaching about what that means for the quality of the show. Writers that have no fear and do not invent ridiculous mechanics to ""save"" people are honest. That honesty means that you can trust them. They will not lie to you or try to trick you into anything. They are being upfront with the story they tell and the consequences that result. It's why I cant shut my mouth about this show."
The100,3dnrl9,FrostlyGrim,2,Fri Jul 17 20:57:11 2015 UTC,I fully expect that any character could die. I think it adds a real underlying level of anxiety. Deaths aren't regular enough to become cliche so I am lulled into a false sense of calm a lot of the time. But as soon as I get too chill then someone dies and I'm back to full alert again. I swear this show will kill me.
The100,3dnrl9,Sylentbob,0,Fri Jul 17 22:10:08 2015 UTC,Yep. Anyone thinking that there is a safe zone has not been paying attention. I'm terrified for Raven every week when the show airs.

Most of their clothes would have been taken from before the ground was fucked, America was still a country prior to the irradiating. The remaining presence of the American flag makes sense when you consider not only where they were on the ground (Washington DC), but that some clothes and such would have remained present after the asplosions. Makes sense for a number of reasons."

The100,3dhkwm,atom_destroyer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:29:40 2015 UTC,"Hmmm.  I suppose there's always the possibility that the computer itself became conscious enough to realize that literally everything else with an awareness, especially its creators, has a physical body through which it experiences and influences things.  It could have conjured ALIE to cut out the middle-man.  It could be nowhere near that house, even.  Whatever be going on, this should be fun."
The100,3dhkwm,Baryshnikov_Rifle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:19:39 2015 UTC,"One of my more ""Out There"" theories is that the holo is just a puppet being controlled by someone/ones. Could be aliens, a cult, a political group etc... JR says we are going hard sci fi this year so anything is possible. A wizard of oz scenario would not be out of the realm of possibility imo."
The100,3dhkwm,Kishara,3,Thu Jul 16 17:23:34 2015 UTC,"I doubt that anyone is behind A.L.I.E., at least not anymore, otherwise she wouldn't need Jaha to help her. Probably she just needs someone she can convince to be her hands. (Since she is hologram.)"

The100,3dehnf,ElenaOcean,7,Wed Jul 15 17:18:08 2015 UTC,Still nothing on Toby :(
The100,3dehnf,Dikeleos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:37:57 2015 UTC,He has to be in at least one episode this season surely. But I would enjoy more!
The100,3dehnf,jpkx72,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:14:09 2015 UTC,"In SDCC when Jason was asked if Clarke would go find Jaha he said he can't discuss or reveal a lot about characters meeting. It felt like he was underlining and thinking of Clarke meeting someone else. At first I thought he was thinking of Lexa but he already talked about fireworks between them. So maybe, he's referring to Emerson?  Also Toby hasn't been active on twitter much. (much of the cast has been less active then usual because of filming and scripts.)   I'm just hopeful and I need more tinfoil."
The100,3dehnf,Dikeleos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:20:00 2015 UTC,"Fuck Emerson! Toby is cool though. Clarke is suppose to get some new ""friends"". I'm thinking grounder groupies. I hope they bring her Emerson's head as a thank you for killing the Mt Men."
The100,3dehnf,Sylentbob,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:55:58 2015 UTC,He's lost more than every character in the series. I feel bad for him so I hope he doesn't die.
The100,3dehnf,Dikeleos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:22:26 2015 UTC,"He's lost 381 to be exact :p  That said, the lone soldier deal needs to have it's appearance on the show. There's appeal in that plot as well. As far as morals go, JR can make Emerson what he wants. He's literally a blank slate. Go revenge path, reconcile path, avoidance, closure, escape, sabotage. Limitless possibilities for Emerson"
The100,3dehnf,Jay013,0,Thu Jul 16 09:14:38 2015 UTC,He was scum. He was meant to die. He needs to die in the first episode of s3. Again Toby was rad.
The100,3dehnf,Sylentbob,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:19:16 2015 UTC,"He is the last of his people, all his loved ones were massacred with a horrible painful death and now he's trying to survive in the wilderness.   If he's guily then so are Clarke, Lexa, Murphy and anyone else that killed innocence. Heck he was following orders while what they did was without orders."
The100,3dehnf,Dikeleos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:29:33 2015 UTC,We get it. You have a huge hard on for the guy that still doesn't change the fact that he deserves to die before all others.

Thoughts While I watch:   Look at who is on that stage-  JR- Our showrunner and possibly the most gifted man on this planet.   Liza- Our beloved heroine Clarke  Bob- The guy that plays Bellamy has been through a lot learning to be famous   Marie- The sweet person who plays Octavia.   Isaiah- I could never imagine anyone else playing our Jaha   Lindsey- Well, anyone who does not know about my devotion to Raven has been living under a floor.   Ricky- Such a neat accessible person. Seems hard to believe someone that handsome is this talented. Love the Linctavia hat haha!   So these are the actors chosen for the panel. What does that mean for season three? Where was Paige Turco and Henry Cusick? Does bringing these actors to comic con say something about the direction for the show?  I know I personally have said I want the focus to remain on the original The 100. I dont want to lose how close I feel to these characters with distracting focus on other factions etc... What makes me most happy is to see how The 100 grow and develop in this impossible situation they are in.   Next up. Can I just say how unbelievable proud I am to be a member of The 100 fan group. Because some of these questions are ones we ask here about the philosophy behind the show and this shit does not happen for a lot of other shows. We are unicorns.   Jason talking about hard sci fi makes me swoon. It's what I want. don't get me wrong, the drama stuff is great  but the sci fi is why I was here in the first place.   Interesting that JR explained why the book had nothing to do with the script. The book had not been published when he began so he literally had no source material other than a treatment to go by.   The new opening sequence was done because our beloved writer Kim Shumway got on Jason's case about it. WELL DONE!   Monty and Jasper not here, Sulks...   Isaiah talking about the characters morphing is so spot on.   They do their own stunts !! Who Knew?   Ricky talking, ya know... I could just sit here and stare and listen to him talk all day!   Aww how adorbs is this cosplay discussion? Bob as Pikachu! Eliza as Sailor Moon!   The PTSD discussion. Yes they will use it again.   Hahaha Eliza saying she felt bad for shooting Dante.   Representation - strong or weak is the only division. Neat answer JR. This is why we love you so damn much.   Amazing how many people love RAVEN! Feels so good to see this because she really is an incredible character.   We will see more mutants. Neat!   LOL I love that they are asking the audience if they speak grounder.   ""We will find our bright spots"" JR you are our bright spot.   Well done panel! We love you sooo sooo much.  Anyone not watching this show has no idea what they are missing."

The100,3db2f4,Shotokanguy,2,Tue Jul 14 22:01:27 2015 UTC,"Letting everyone else take the facilities in the mountain seems like the best idea, but we have no idea if they'll just go along with that when they hear a bunch of people were irradiated to death inside those halls. And parents will probably want to stay with their kids. And there will probably be plenty of adults trying to take over everything. Just like in the s how."
The100,3db2f4,Jay013,0,Wed Jul 15 01:45:15 2015 UTC,"I think knowing people died there is different to seeing the bodies, and given the choice between large and well-equipped shelter and makeshift tents/ ark wreckage there will be enough takers for the mountain, it might not even be big enough for all of them, even if people double up a lot more. We know they had enough space to house the 50 kids easily enough and there seems to be space that could be converted - after all they had a room big enough to cage god knows how many grounders that could be converted...  There will definitely be adults trying to take over, which means to my thinking that plonking them on the mountain and giving them that place in which to have their leadership battle might stop them bothering to come down to the dropship camp. I think we should get them to aim the ark at the far-side foot of the mountain well away from us but not close enough to risk damaging the underground structures, and maintain our camp separately. Hell we can even outfit a few more little hideaways and stash supplies all over the place. As long as we don't take anything they have only one of we'd be good, it's not like they know what's in there before we get there :D"
The100,3db2f4,ShaneH7646,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:51:13 2015 UTC,"Also for those coming in, if you're looking more towards playing the soldier type, you can join the Skai-Tri Aro Rona (STARs) with me and /u/woupieta. I'm leading over at the Dropship camp, and he's leading over at Mt. Weather. Just pick up your bow, and let's go!  And who knows. With the Arkers a tad uneasy, the Ark Guards who have been trained as a security force for their people might not look so kindly on us STARs, a Grounder-Arker aliance, acting as the guards for the people while they sit back watching untrained ex-criminals. Tensions could rise and we may have a small civil war on our hands...  That's my plot suggestion. Internal conflict between the Arkers and us 100dites."

In these glue induces states of higher consciousness, they read the graffiti off the subway walls and devised a language from it.   By the time the ground was safe to live on again, everyone was so used to speaking Glue Mouth that it just stuck as a language."
The100,3d6ddu,HelloSlackers,3,Mon Jul 13 22:44:00 2015 UTC,There was also a theory that the grounders knew that the mountain men were monitoring them so they purposely developed a language only they could understand. Conjecture for the most part.

The100,3d6ddu,manicmelancholic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:17:15 2015 UTC,"Sure, go with whatever you feel like doing, it's very open format and some idea of what's been going on with the ark would be good. You'll notice that the chancellor has not been referred to by name. Also it's worth saying that we totally ignored the ark crisis that happened in the show because we didn't really want to include the ark right at the start, so the whole imminent death thing is less pressing. Essentially they still need to get down there soon, but there haven't been massive deaths due to oxygen shortage, their timeline has been delayed to fit the RP format. Also I'm fuzzy on whether or not Raven got sent down, we've not really used her as a plotline and we've not had communication with the ark, so I'd leave her out of it as we seem to have gone the route of totally ignoring the main cast from the show."

Jaha had a pressure suit and his missle had a parachute that he set to deploy once he hit low atmosphere. Diana rode a broken Dropship between mach 10-25 (entry speed of present day spacecrafts). We saw the crash, and the inferno. No way did she survive.  Mel: I know that her whole purpose was to tie what's left of the group together and keep them looking forward, whether or not the 48 are dead or alive. But she needs a role in the 100dite group, or Sterling's death was a waste.  Echo Octavia has Lincoln, Bellamy will have Echo, and then the term Grounder Pounder will make a comeback. Honestly though, I see her being the tie between the Ark and the Azgeda. With the alliance in shambles, both the Ark's and the Coalition's, Azgeda can stand to benefit with allying themselves with the legendary Sky Girl who conquered the Mountain. Wait until they find out she's gone. Still, there's a benefit to the Ark group.  Pauna: Don't you hate it when you're trying to watch The 100 and the channel switches to Planet of the Apes? Jokes aside, she's locked up, but the cage won't hold. She'll come back when the plot needs her.  Emerson: Sole survivor of the mountain. He's resourceful. He'll find his way around. but I don't think he'd be advertising who he is. /u/tobylevins (the man himself) said he likes the Grounders faction because of their costume design. With Emerson needing to hide out to get back on his feet who knows. He may end up in a Grounder village in disguise. Also he might end up going to a Trigeda bar to order a drink where a hooded sky girl is also having a drink...

He doesn't look in line with the mutants we did end up seeing, so I think they changed/made up their minds on the mutant concept long after his appearance.  They may well bring him back, though. Perhaps Clarke gets injured or something, and he/it nurses her back to health [cue beauty and the beast music that later turns into ""Go on! Can't you see I don't want you anymore! -sob-""]  EDIT: So what do you think Mel's role will be? I mean Monty needs a love interest (unless it's Harper now), and Jasper needs someone to cheer him up.

It would be a creative way to bring him back, if they sort of abandoned whatever they originally had planned with him.

Makes me wonder how different it would be if it was a netflix original instead.  I love that the show has no real heroes too, and every decision creates a debate about what you would do in that situation. I always like that if the show was told from the MW or Grounder POV, our protagonists would be villains in their eyes. It's also great that it shows the mental toll of all those decisions too rather than people just shrugging it off and continuing as they were in the next episode.   Welcome to the sub!"

The100,3d49z3,CrystalElyse,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:35:47 2015 UTC,JR (Showrunner) was pretty clear that the source material was not a major component of his script. A good majority of us here have not read the books as the writers say they have deviated well away from them. I just don't feel reading the books would have a positive impact on how I currently perceive the show. Most of our members who have read them were not terribly impressed.
The100,3d49z3,Kishara,2,Mon Jul 13 17:01:24 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I haven't read them either. I'm just saying that it does explain a good bit about the characterization/writing if they were trying to keep them similar ish to their counterparts.

It's honest and the consequences are real. There are no last minute saves or convenient deus ex machina's on The 100. The plot mechanics they use are generally spot on. There have been a few issues now and then, but you would have to be a pretty pedantic asshole to judge the show on a few minor slips when considering the overall brilliance of Rothenberg and his merry band of writers/murderers.

The100,3d19a6,tanglespeck,6,Sun Jul 12 19:58:17 2015 UTC,"I've lived in Hawaii my entire life. ""Pigeon English"" is our similar language and can completely understand where the creator is coming from when he envisions the grounders language developments and it's being kin to creole. It's hard to truly convey to outside people who haven't heard it spoken, but when I hear grounders speaking I immediately knew it was broken English, and likened it to creole instantly. We are a very isolated land, and so many cultures came here during our colonization. A common language did evolve and persists to this day. It is a very complex topic because it is at once immediate to our culture identity yet looked down upon in certain situations (such as job interviews) as an undesired trait. Long story short, language will evolve into slang given time and distance whether geological distance or distance as time from origin source, and we are living proof of how far it can drift and still be recognizable."
The100,3d19a6,Don808,4,Mon Jul 13 01:04:15 2015 UTC,"Oh I definitely agree that English would become deep slang after 100 years. For sure.  I'm also willing to buy that the comprehension of 'original' English still survived as a means to understand the Mountain Men, and that the grounder's warriors would be the ones to know it. That all makes sense.  What I didn't like was that the director(s) decided not to give the grounder warriors any accent when they did finally speak English. Considering that their natural day-to-day speech was Trigedasleng, and that they only would have spoken/heard true English when they needed to in the battle field, their vocal muscle memory would have given them at least a slight Trigedasleng accent. Y'know?  I also was expecting at least some language barrier between the Sky People and the Grounders, considering that each had developed their own cultural vernacular like 'float.' Honestly, just two or three lines of dialogue wherein they compared their different words for certain objects would have made me happy. Perhaps they originally had some of that in the script and it got cut. Anything's possible."

In contrast, it looks like what the devs are saying (and what I assumed to be true) is that the Grounder language is simply an extremely radical derivative dialect of English, likely mostly from Standard plus whatever local dialects the original Grounders spoke. It would be inaccurate to characterize it as a creole."
The100,3d19a6,The_Last_Minority,8,Mon Jul 13 01:14:10 2015 UTC,"No one here calls it Hawaiian Pidgin. It's just pidgin. You got the spelling right though. Also, I've never once heard or seen it referred to as creole outside of that link you shared.   When I heard the grounders speak, I definitely heard it as creole. Not getting into a pissing contest with you, but that's how I heard and continue to hear it when I watch. Its funny to see a wiki page describing our culture, and knowing full well no local would ever call it ""Hawaiian Pidgin"" let alone ""Creole"".

Apologies if I offended. A creole is a specific phenomenon, one that does not apply to the Grounder situation, and I wanted to point that out. I did not intend to invalidate your on-the-ground experience with the language at all. I fully concede my knowledge comes entirely from external study rather than having experienced it firsthand."

But sounds like ""Shut up Indra"".  0:17  ""stop worrying, Gustus."" Sounds like ""Don't get down Gustus"".  I'm not going to do this for every little quote. Although really, it's just slang that's a little blurry.   Some are hardly even changed. ""ENOUGH"" is ""no more"". And ""Put him on the tree may be a bit more confusing ""Take him set round on a tree"" Is a bit hard to understand. but note, ""Tree"" is literally Tree.   As other have said, this is based off of them needing a new language to  confuse the grounders. Explaining some of the more jibberish sounding words. However, it is still English, and if they found a small tribe that didn't know their tongue, it would be easier to teach, than say, Russian."
The100,3d19a6,Bond4141,4,Mon Jul 13 03:38:26 2015 UTC,I've asked this question before. When I did the answers I got were that it was basically just a derivitive of English. Slang and whatnot. It was probably developed so the Mountain Men couldn't decipher it. If you listen closely the words sound somewhat like they have English root words.

And I've seen it in a few threads already.  Isn't the point of Reddit to engage in discussion?  Trying to stifle discussion, especially in between seasons, seems counterproductive to the point of the sub.  If you don't like the question, don't come into the thread.  As a new viewer to the show, there are a lot of questions I had and things I want to discuss, and I imagine there a others like me.   If i wanted to just read an answer, I'd go to Wiki.  It's more entertaining to discuss things with others and maybe get the chance to see someone else's point of views."
The100,3d19a6,iYankFan4,5,Sun Jul 12 18:48:29 2015 UTC,"We absolutely welcome the discussion, and we think it's great that new people come here asking about the show. I know that sometimes people can come across as rude when regular questions get asked but most of us are happy to answer questions and we don't want anyone to feel like they can't start a discussion or ask something, however many times it may have been answered in the past.  So if you feel like anyone's been unfriendly I apologize. They should know better and realize that there are consequences if they continue to be rude because the mod team has a really low tolerance level for that kind of bullshit.   If you're ever unsure about anything, please feel free to send us a modmail or a pm and we'll help you out."
The100,3d19a6,tanglespeck,2,Sun Jul 12 22:42:57 2015 UTC,"If you want to discuss things you'd only know solely from watching the TV show, I'm absolutely down. I love discussing things.  I'm also specifically not looking at the FAQ because IMO if it wasn't covered in the show, the show viewer isn't supposed to know it."
The100,3d19a6,SilentSniper646,-5,Sun Jul 12 19:45:45 2015 UTC,I'm fine with discussions but I don't believe im the only one who thinks that the same post over and over again is getting boring
The100,3d19a6,iYankFan4,6,Sun Jul 12 20:13:36 2015 UTC,"To be honest, that doesn't seem like a very welcoming statement to those who are new to the show or new to the sub.  Also kind of obnoxious.    Would you rather have no discussion between seasons?  That's pretty boring also, don't you think?  Again, if you think a question is boring, ignore it.  Not sure what the big deal is.  I can see it being annoying during the season if there is thread after thread with the same question about an episode, but now?  There's not much action in here.  As in 3-4 new posts a day. You would think that you would want as much discussion as possible when there's two months until the next new ep.  It's just a little off-putting as a newbie to the sub (but not to reddit)."

This is pretty much the same thing.  I realize I may have made this point already, sorry. Yelenna is sleepy!"
The100,3d19a6,Amonette2012,2,Tue Jul 14 02:24:58 2015 UTC,"You have to expect some repeat posts on a fan sub. People come with a question and they ask, it's not their fault it's been asked before, they shouldn't have to read the entire FAQ before asking a question.  I also run /r/aion, and while I do ask people to search the sub for specific info we still get the saaaame questions again and again. What server should I play on? What class should I choose? Which faction is better? These days I just link the guide I wrote, but still, we're there to get people excited about the game so we answer the question and help the person looking for info. If we're feeling particularly lazy we link the last thread on the subject. Same principle here."

I asked this question on the sub a few months ago and was downvoted. the only comment I got was someone telling me to search the sub to make sure it hadn't been asked before, and provided a link. they were polite though"

Keep an eye on youtube because there's a couple of channels who are filming panels and putting them up afterwards, there might be one dedicated to just CW shows or something.   edit: I just speeded through the whole stream and the 100 isn't on there, but I'll check back tomorrow to see if they have an interview lined up. Still some cool stuff on there, Batman news was the big thing of the day I think."

The100,3ctzvv,El_Diablito,5,Fri Jul 10 19:34:35 2015 UTC,"The Mountain men will remain a threat, but they won't have any need to capture grounders anymore as long as they have the survivors of the Ark. They will, very quickly, all become immune to radiation.   So, Lexa gets her people back with no loss of life to her army, and they will stop capturing her people, and they will no longer turn her people into reapers. For the very low cost of disbanding an incredibly new alliance (I mean, what, they've been all together for a week after a bunch of fighting?).   Not to mention that the Mountain Men don't know how to survive on the surface. They would have a very hard time adjusting and not really be able to wage war for a least a little while.   It's a damn good deal."
The100,3ctzvv,CrystalElyse,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:27:47 2015 UTC,"I dunno, the chance to remove a threat at the point when they're critically disadvantaged is too much to give away just for the hopeful assumption that they'll leave you alone.  Lexa is very comfortable with the loss of her people and plus she had gathered all kinds of clans for this attack which is stupid just to withdraw with a pitiful compromise.  She's actually a pretty crappy leader and I'd doubt any strong group would follow her."
The100,3ctzvv,balgruufgat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:21:32 2015 UTC,"It was more than a few dozen I think, there was a lot of them in there. The main reason was because she thought that she could save all her people, without losing any - save the handful that were killed by the machine guns - people. Not to mention that her duty is always first to her people, and she saw an opportunity to save her people, so she took it. I have a feeling that her choice will be addressed next season though, so we'll just have to wait."

But we were all pretty riled up when we watched it so if they need to vent it out and make sense of it that's cool. Not everyone got to share the massive shit fit we had. Still hoping the ice queen rides a polar bear though..."
The100,3ctzvv,wwhideanseek,2,Fri Jul 10 22:21:35 2015 UTC,Ah yeah. That was in the comic con spoilers right?  Not the part about the polar bear.  So the writers confirmed we'll meet the ice queen? Or just the ice clan?
The100,3ctzvv,ElenaOcean,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:29:59 2015 UTC,"They said we'd know her name...but my feeling is they don't want to ruin the big reveal. It's been a huge talking point so I do kinda want her entrance to be a total surprise. I think we are meeting the ice clan though because they've mentioned Echo too multiple times.   I don't think they would have spoiled Lexa's return unless they had something even better in the wings. It is sort of Jason's MO to get storylines over and done with fast and then move on to something bigger. And hey, I'd settle for a sled pulled by two giant wolves if they can't hire a polar bear. No one is an Ice Queen and not a total BAMF."

Apparently, they've been sounding since Elena opened the door. The second is the smell. There are a lot of dead bodies around. The ones closest to the door are wearing uniforms labelled MT WEATHER SECURITY and they litter the ground like a macabre trail of breadcrumbs. At least the power's still on.  They have radios and keycards. I think we should take these with us because keycards mean locked doors and their radios are probably better than ours. We just won't be able to use them until someone shuts off that bloody alarm. One group is going to look for them, guided by the grounders who have been in the mountain.  My group and I play demented Hansel and Gretel and follow the bodies while gritting our teeth against the sound. A redshirt gets pissed off enough to shoot the nearest speaker, so we have a blessed few seconds of slightly less alarm as we pass it.  The bodies lead first to a staircase and, on the next level, to an elevator. Inside, there are a number of floors. One of them has to be the quarantine ward that Elena broke out of, but that's not what we're looking for. I use one of the Mt Weather radios to call to other people that we should reorganise into several large groups for each floor and then split into individual ones to explore the sections.  Somebody shut off that bloody alarm before I start shooting things.  P.S. here's a map and the wiki page with the layout of Mt Weather."

The100,3c73pi,Jay013,2,Sun Jul 5 15:26:51 2015 UTC,Heh I thought you guys might like the little liberty I took there :)
The100,3c73pi,arihadne,3,Sun Jul 5 15:31:04 2015 UTC,"Hehe, Pao.    I'm taking my archers along side the Forest kru archers. We shall now be known as the Skai-Tri Aro Rona. Meaning Sky-Tree Arrow Runners, because we're archers that double as scouts. Of course if that seems to be a mouthful, you can just call us STAR for short. (note, I'm fabricating Aro to mean arrow. Doesn't seem to be a word for arrow yet so...why not?)  Anyway, the STARs and I will be heading through the tunnels. The access door seems to have been opened already, and still was when we got there. We made our way through the cleansing chambers. Down here we could hear the faint sound of an alarm echoing through the mountain. This was a first for all of us, so we stayed cautious. We reached two different doors at the end. That's when I decided to split the team up.   My door led to a corridor. Leading the current team of two grounders, and two other arkers, we ended up passing a few littered bodies along the way. Some civilian, some in uniform. I decided to search the uniformed bodies looking for keys that could be used to access the doors. What do you know, a keycard. My other archer and I decided to take their sidearms as well. The Grounders still had their supoerstitions regarding firearms, even though it's clear that the mountain poses no threat to them. I tried to assure them having a gun in this place will help them fight, but they maintained their belief. Whatever. At least one good thing about this is if that we're ever at war, we don't have to worry about the Grounders using guns. Then I heard /u/arihadne's call over the mountain wide system. I ignored it as the STARs were already diveded into teams.  It wasn't long until we ended up in what seemed to be the mountain's pharmacy. While the Grounders saw bottles and phials of unfamiliar liquids and strange pellets, we saw antibiotics, painkillers, morphine, and adrenaline. This was a bounty. I asked the Grounders to watch the door while the rest of us filled our bags with what we could. Essentials only this time, we can come back for everything else some other time. We started to fill our bags with antibiotics, painkillers, bandages, alcohol, peroxide, and a whole mix of other things. Between the three of us, we barely made a dent in the moutain's stock pile. We need to come back here. The Grounders' medicine may work well enough, but if things get serious, synthesized drugs may be our only hope. For both us and the Grounders.  I called out over the radio. ""Dictator /u/Amonette2012 , We've found the pharmacy, and loaded up. There's a hell of a lot to take here. Either send more men to take some of this, or set up a plan to come back later. There's no way we can let this go.""  As we were loading up, the other half of my team radioed in. ""Hey, we made it to the next level up. Look like a warehouse.""  ""Grab what you can that we can use. Prioritize. We can always come back for the rest.""    Can I have that? The STARs? The Grounder-Arker warrior alliance of archers and scouts?"

The100,3c73pi,arihadne,3,Sun Jul 5 20:04:57 2015 UTC,"""Roger that. We'll secure the level so we can come back for this safely. After that we'll make our way down to...Hey what does that map say? ...to uh..life support.""  You heard her boys. Pack light."
The100,3c73pi,Jay013,3,Sun Jul 5 20:10:02 2015 UTC,"(I think life support has the security offices, even though they're not on the map.)  ""DON'T TAKE THE ANTIBIOTICS!"" I say over the radio, speaking over the alarms. ""IF THERE'S A REFRIGERATOR DOWN THERE, PUT THEM IN THERE. WE TAKE THEM OUTSIDE,THE TEMPERATURE WILL SCREW WITH THEM. LEAVE THEM HERE SO THEY'LL STAY POTENT LONGER.""  My team and I have made it down to the sixth floor, the last one listed on the elevator. I might have to get back up there and find the supply list for the medical wing. Shoving pills into a bag isn't the best way to sort things out. Going to have to make a list so we can prioritise.  ""HEY IS THERE A CENTRIFUGE UP THERE?"" I ask over the alarms, and wait for the answer.   The smell of the dead is constant now, still sickening, but I think we're getting used to it, and just in time. There are a lot more dead down here, including children. I think we've found the residences, here at the end of the sixth floor down. I can't take it anymore and turn back, stumbling along the walls and grinning like a skull to clench my teeth and suppress the gag reflex. I wave off my group. All of us are starting to realise the scale of this -- this massacre. I hit the elevator button because I need to be somewhere else.  This isn't the same elevator. It has a button for an extra floor. I choose down and it's climbing a tower in reverse. The good stuff in a tower, in the fairy tales, like the princess is always at the top. Here, in Mt Weather, the good stuff is a complete lack of bodies and a pair of glass doors. They have a seal on them, and it says that this office is the office of the President of the United States.  Alone, I enter it. There's an open laptop on the desk and, when I wake it back up, it has a security program open and thank every deity there is that there's an option to turn off the alarms. I slam my finger down on that button so hard I think I might have bruised it.  With my walkie-talkie and radios in either hand, I sit down in the nearest chair to wait for replies and anyone else using the frequencies."
The100,3c73pi,woupieta,2,Mon Jul 6 02:33:49 2015 UTC,"I left the archers in the pharmacy while I went with the Grounders down to Life Support. I called out over the radio to my men.  ""Do what she says guys. If those antibiotics get messed up, and we can't use them, all this is for nothing. As for the centrifuge, you're going to want to look out for something with a rotating center with slots for phials to go into. I think I saw one at the center left side of the room.""  Down at level four we've made it to Life Support. Down here, there was an unlabelled room. I kicked the door open and found myself staring at a large screen focused on what seemed to be their mess hall. Mess was right. There were bodies everywhere, all severely disfigured with radiation burns. On the panel was a text display 'air scrubber fan control' The lever next to it was pulled all the way down. Someone sucked the radiated air from outside into the mountain.  On a different screen, I could see a blinking light down a long shaft. The elevator shaft I suppose. It was at the bottom level.  ""Hey, someone's down in the last level. Be careful.""  With the Grounders lacking knowledge of this kind of stuff, I sent them to get back up to medical to regroup with the rest of the STARs.  Scrambling around to see what's what, I get myself a keyboard and sit in front of a display. I pulled up a map of the compound. Some areas weren't even on the maps we're seeing around the place. As I looked for places of interest, the alarm system shut down. I kept reading the more detailed map.  ""Hey guys, I think I found the armory. I'm gonna go check it out. Also, don't bother with the keycards. I just disabled all the locks on the doors. They should be fine now.""  The armory wasn't too far from where I am. First thing's first, I need to secure the level. I pulled out my handguns. The one I found during my time outside, and the one I picked up here. Carefully, I made my way to the armory, checking every room and hall along the way.  ""Well holy shit. You won't believe what I have up here."" Guns, ammo, body armor, explosives...damn. This mountain was decked out.  ""STARs. Status report. How's the warehouse and pharmacy?""  ""Lot of is junk. Rich people shit. Did get some dehydrated food up here. Some chocolate. Uh...we've got some backpacks and tools.""  ""All good at the pharmacy. We've got two centrifuges, antibiotics are in the fridge. Some of the antibiotics are in pill form> Uh..amoxycillin. We don't know if it needs cool temperatures so we put them in anyway. Hey, there's some multivitamins down here...""  ""Alright. Has anyone else seen any signs of life? Any Grounder prisoners, any hostiles, anything?""  I waited in the armory, looking at exactly what was here while waiting for a reply."
The100,3c73pi,ElenaOcean,2,Mon Jul 6 03:33:05 2015 UTC,"""If they're plastic-looking, then they have fluid in them and need to be refrigerated. Solid pills are fine where they are. I'll be up in a bit to take a look, but I've got a computer here that I'm going to poke through a bit first.""  I leave the radios on the desk and squint at the screen. For a moment, it's hard to focus on the words after not seeing a computer for weeks. The path listing at the top of the security program goes MAIN > COMMUNICATION > INTERNAL > ALARM. Clicking INTERNAL brings me to a screen that shows that there are a couple of different options for broadcasting in the mountain, including ones for specific sectors, all of them neatly labelled. Everything inside is a closed network. The radios are only on one frequency in here.  Another level up. The COMMUNICATIONS level gives only two options. I follow the other menu path, to EXTERNAL. More radio channels, organised by their frequencies.  And, at the bottom: LONG-RANGE SATELLITE, with an toggled option beside it of BLOCKED.  Apparently, there's not a password to unblock it. It only takes a click of the trackpad and the speakers of the computer shift to life.  ""This is Ark Station, calling the ground - ""  I grab the walkie-talkie. Talking into the radio would lead to pandemonium, with everyone trying to talk. The walkie-talkie is the safest bet. ""Guys, they have a satellite. And? It's getting a signal from the Ark.""  I wait until the message starts again from the beginning and hold the walkie-talkie up to it so that everyone can hear a voice we all know so very well."

Weather and decide what we're going to do with it (currently it looks like we're a little divided on that)."
The100,3c73pi,Jay013,3,Tue Jul 7 21:02:14 2015 UTC,"I'm going with the group that goes with the tunnels.   Evidently, when the alarms sounded, some people in their panic tried to make it out through the tunnel entrance and the path up to the door is scattered with the bodies of people who didn't make it too far (oops).  We can still hear the alarms, and there's a woman in a labcoat who's burnt body has helpfully wedged the door open. I stop to swipe her ID: Dr Tsing.   The concrete tunnels lead through a decontamination chamber and some kind of...torture rooms? There's a crucifix chair like the kind they use to restrain test subjects, security cameras and cages. I decide to split off from the group (I'm feeling a tiny bit queasy looking at all the bodies that I accidentally sort of murdered) so I take a left and wind up in a medical bay. There's beds and what look like dialysis type pumps that are connected to tubing via the wall...weird. I decide to stuff my bag with as many medical supplies as I can: bandages, needles, painkillers, suture kits, scalpels...everything I can fit. I'm just finishing stuffing bottles of tranquilizers in my pockets and attaching a stethoscope to my belt (so I can play doctor with Murphy later) when I catch sight of the pipes again. Who attaches a dialysis pump to the wall??  I'm about to wrench the vent cover off the wall when a Grounder from my group pokes his head around the door and yells at me that we're meant to stay together. I flip him the bird but decide to go with him, before I leave I mark the vent with a huge red ""X"" in spray paint. We should check it out later.  Our group makes its way to the kitchen stores. The grounders stand back skeptically as the kids start cheering, filling their packs with as much dried food supplies and tins they can fit. I tell them to take the dry supplies; we can send a group back for the tins later. I mark the kitchen with paint again, leaving a note so that other groups know there's food stores here. While the others are packing up I find a few boxes of chocolate cake mix and take them with me because I know how much Kish loves chocolate cake. I also find some peanut butter (praise the gods!) and take that with me too.   I'm pretty loaded up on supplies by this point, and the smell of death is starting to make me gag so I make my excuses and leave to head back to camp on my own. It kinda looks like no one survived the breach, and I feel a little bad for them. But on the plus side once we clean up the bodies we have a pretty great base to settle down in for the winter. It's definitely a relief to be out in the open air again though, I'm starting to like living outside."

The100,3c73pi,Jay013,2,Mon Jul 6 00:06:34 2015 UTC,"Introduction of my character:  Name: Dikeloes Age: 23 Appearance: 5'11"" tall, blonde, and handsome ;)  (To avoid confusion I'm just going to write what happened to my character during week 13 to week 16. Hopefully that’s okay.)  Week 13:  I felt lucky to not be on the team to capture members of the Arkers.   Sure, if I was assigned to the mission I probably would have done it. Follow my orders like I always would... I stayed in Mount Weather doing my duty as security detail though. But at least cause I wasn't part of the mission I got to feel less guilty. ""Got"" is the key word there. Now? Now I'm more guilt ridden than ever. The capture team brought back four of the Arkers. Part of me hoped they wouldn't have captured any. All I could think of was what they would go through before they died. I, along with most of MW personnel, was briefed on why we needed them. The marrow in their bones. It could cure us of our pathetic lack of resistance to radiation. With it, we could go outside. I could see the sun with my own eyes... But those four and anymore we captured, would die. It unsettled me of course. The idea of them dying- No... Being murdered so I could enjoy my life. But I took it anyways as ordered. I received the marrow from the 1st of the 4. A boy. I stared at his lifeless body while his marrow was being injected into me. They were going extract the marrow from the other 3 but decided to wait a week to make sure the marrow worked on me first.   Week 14:   It worked. I was able to handle higher levels of radiation. My family was jumping with joy at the idea that I could live outside, the doctors we rushing around planning for more marrow procedures, but I knew what this meant. The other 3 Arkers would die and, eventually, we would capture the rest at their camp and they would die too.  So long as everything went alright.    They were prepping medical for the extraction of marrow from the 3 other Arkers, of the four we captured.  Then the sirens went off. Someone in the Quarantine Ward escaped, a girl. ( /u/ElenaOcean ) We were ordered to stop her before she could escape MW but it was all too late. The radiation alarms went off. She opened the main door.  Week 15: characters past and attributes.  Father is a scientist that works on the marrow project. Which is how I was selected to be the test subject of the marrow treatment. Mother works in agriculture. Was recruited for MW Security Detail because of how much I could take from the bullies in my class. I’m excellent with a good sniper rifle and good in hand to hand to combat. I’ve never seen the sun.  Week 16:  Everything I ever knew was gone. Blown out like a flame and gone forever. All because of one girl.  A week had passed since the radiation flooded my home. When it happened I stopped searching for the girl because she was gone and everything was ending.  I hadn’t moved a muscle since I found my parents bodies. Both of them, on floor next to each other. Their arms stretched out towards the other as if they were reaching for each other in their last moments. I was still in shock probably. Everyone I ever knew was dead. Everything I ever knew was over. All that was left was me. Maybe I should just stay here forever and die next my parents, my friends and their children…   There was nothing left for me. Going outside and seeing the sky and the sun for the first would be pointless. All I desired was pointless now.   I went back to last week when the girl escaped and opened the door. Because of her… all this happened. She took everything from me.   I realized what I desired then, while staring at my parents bodies. Revenge. I screamed with tears running down my face.  I found the strength I needed to go on. So I got up and ran. I knew the girl would be back with friends and probably too many for me to take on. I’m lucky that she didn’t return while I was in shock. I needed to get out now or else I would be trapped like rat in a cage.   The armory was the first place I needed to go. To get their though I would need to go through halls that were now graves for my friends. I expected seeing them to be hard but smelling them tore into me. My heart was already being anchored by the sight of my friends cold bodies. Now my stomach needed to get through the torture of the decay.   The armory was only missing several pistols. They were probably with the guards that were chasing the girl before she killed everyone. I grabbed 2 pistols, extra ammo, and C4. I couldn’t forget a sniper rifle either. Before I grabbed it though I imagined all the times I practiced with it. Everything I’ve ever trained for, will help me avenge those I lost… Those who she took from me.   I headed to the kitchen and then medical to grab whatever food and medicine I could. Now that I had everything I needed the fastest exit would be the main door. The one the girl escaped through but the Quarantine Ward was the other way. Those 2 Arkers trapped. I want to go to them more than anything now. I wanted them to be as helpless as my parents were. But I needed to get out as soon as I could.  I got to the staircase leading to the main door and I climbed. As I got closer and closer the light become more and more blinding. I stopped when I reached the top and stared back down to my home and prison.  I will stop at nothing until they know how it feels to lose everything. I have nothing to lose and only vengeance to gain.   I stepped out into the sunlight for the first time. It felt like stepping into a fire. My heart burning with rage and pain. For now, I survive.  END of week 16  Ok so I know this puts me in a position of being sort of the enemy of all of you but hey, it’s exciting. I know we can’t kill each other off too so I’m planning on a redemption arch, sort of like Murphy. I’m coming for you /u/ElenaOcean XD"

I'd say episode five is where the show really evolves into an excellent series, but episode 3 has hooked many people as well... I won't spoil any further but basically this show gets very dark but in the first couple episodes the kids are more... innocent. So grab a box of tissues and keep watching."

The100,3c9apx,Amonette2012,6,Tue Jul 7 06:07:15 2015 UTC,"What GreyDGR said. The first season or so (I don't quite remember which episode(s) were the ones where the show started to improve) in my opinion is pretty bad. The writing seems a little cheesy, and the entire show seems to be a teenage drama 97 years into the future on a dystopian Earth, but the show as a whole improves a lot by season 2. The acting is arguably better, and the writing has definitely evolved into something else entirely. I'd say the drama is pretty much gone, and the show turns much more darker, and is less like a ""chick flick"" so to speak. The show ramps up a lot, and the episodes actually advance a storyline instead of being full of bickering between teens.  Edit: Also, a post from yesterday asking pretty much the same thing. The comments there also apply."
The100,3c9apx,sharkbait359,5,Mon Jul 6 02:47:39 2015 UTC,It's not a show for middle schoolers. Why do you think they're just going to be partying and fighting each other the whole time? Do you think there would be people like me articulating so intelligently that this show is worth your time if they were just a bunch of stupid kids who never showed some sign of character development?

A lot of people that watched it then just dropped out somewhere in the first half.  They were lucky to get an order for the next two half-seasons after that, and the network had their hand on the plug.  When it came to ordering the second half of season two, and all of season three (pretty sure they put down for the whole thing, anyway), there was almost no question.  By the time you get to the end of season 2, season 1 is just...cute."

I barely made it through the first 2 episodes, thinking it was just some unrealistic teenage drama show. However, I kept watching, and after a few episodes in all of the bullshit is gone. It becomes much more realistic and the group is actually faced with real problems.  Also, season 2 is even darker and more mature than season 1. I highly recommend that you try to pull through the start and watch the whole show."
The100,3c4xym,Shanpu,17,Sat Jul 4 20:49:11 2015 UTC,"Acting gets much better and there's a ton of awesome character development.

The100,3c4xym,Jay013,7,Sat Jul 4 21:48:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah holy crap I was in the EXACT same situation as you. I could barely get past the first episode without cringing. It felt like the show was trying to take itself seriously, but had too many misplaced lines of script and too much bad acting to succeed in that.  However, DEFINITELY give it a chance. It gets so much better it isn't even funny. The plot is downright fantastic, the characters become a lot more relatable, and overall it really undergoes a metamorphosis into a great show. I still think the acting by some actors can be a little mediocre later on, and the character development can get a bit wonky I think, but I can definitely forgive that for such a phenomenal show."

General consensus is that it stays that way until after Murphys Law, then steps it up.   Every couple weeks this sub has a post exactly like yours, someone who has watched the first few episodes and asking if it gets better. And every time that user posts a couple days later saying how they binged the two seasons an are dying for more and are so glad they didn't give up on it.  It took me three times to get through the first two episodes until i finally kept with it and now I'm obsessed. Give it a shot, if you're still not hooked by the 6th or so episode, it might just not be for you."

That said, you get a pass because you apparently like Murphy. I am all about Murphy. Anyway, I agree with everyone else. I actually like the entire series so far, but once you see Murphy's Law everyone agrees it only gets better. Murphy's Law is the episode that made everyone sit up and pay attention."

The100,3c4xym,joeydeno,2,Sun Jul 5 14:04:53 2015 UTC,yes the acting gets better   i was hooked from the beginning but i had told my friend about the show and he said the same thing. He said he was going to give it a few more episodes because of octavia and clarke. He gave it a few episodes and he cant stop watching it. He said the acting gets 10x better.
The100,3c4xym,Shotokanguy,2,Sat Jul 4 21:12:02 2015 UTC,"I dislike Clarke the most, atm the best actor is the dude who is a douche and makes everyone hate him, whoalso plays in continuum. I hate him kind of too, so he must be doing his job right. I hate Clarke more though."
The100,3c4xym,Shotokanguy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:16:14 2015 UTC,"Why do you hate Clarke? I've always been absolutely baffled by people saying this about her, especially early on.  The only reason I can imagine someone hating her is because of some deep seeded dislike of a woman being bossy and impetuous, or some kind of aversion to any form of authority. But all I saw from the start was someone with her head on straight and a remarkable amount of compassion for a bunch of strangers."
The100,3c4xym,Shotokanguy,2,Sat Jul 4 22:15:09 2015 UTC,"I don't care, that she want to take care of everyone, but I have a problem with how she thinks she has the moral high ground on every issue that comes up. Prime example, when she accused that epic actor john of killing her friend and then is completely baffled, that the mob wants to hang him, after she rilled them up real good. And how she doesen't know what to do after it came out that the little girl killed him and on top of that she banishes john even tough she caused all the trouble to begin with.  EDIT: To be fair I can see, that John was beeing a dick since the series started. I'm just saying she didn't had a right to banish him at that point.  Why not banish the other dude, who caused the death of two people on the ship."
The100,3c4xym,Shotokanguy,2,Sat Jul 4 22:22:28 2015 UTC,"She and Bellamy both agreed they should banish him, and everyone else agreed too...  And are you talking about banishing Finn? He didn't make those two kids unbuckle their seatbelts."
The100,3c4xym,ElenaOcean,2,Sat Jul 4 22:54:38 2015 UTC,"She clearely blamed him for their deaths by asking him how he feels about causing their deaths. John also didn't make that kid jump off the cliff either (by your logic).  They both agreed to banish him, there was no all. Also doesen't make my point less valid, they both caused that kids death more than John. Bellamy less, Clark more so, but they banish John cause he wants justice for the mob hanging him, because of the kids murder and her accusing him with no real evidence.  If youre going to ask me how they caused it, I can explain my stance on that too.  Bellamy caused it by giving a kid who is having nightmares a knife and telling her to kill the nightmares, with that knife.  Clark is clearly at fault here, even after Bellamy warned her not to act stupid and to gather more information first, which she promptly ignores, by just barging into the middle of the crowd and declare John the killer of her friend. Then proceeding to act all high and mighty to influence a reaction of the mob. Then trying to stopped the rilled up mob, from hanging John, Bellamy even said this is her fault, which it was. Then the kid confesses to be the killer and she just doesn't know how to cope with that. At the end of it all, at the cliff, she wants to talk all of a sudden and come to another kind of solution, which is ironic, because she did the exactly opposite, when she taught John killed her friend.  From what I understood, they banished him because they blamed him for that girls death, but infact Clark is more to blame is she not?  Does John not deserve justice, for the mob hanging him?  Can you deny, that Clark was the cause of all those problems, which lead to the girl doing a nose dive off the cliff?  Could this all not have been avoided, if she would have gathered more information or confronted him alone and not in the middle of the mob for everyone to see?"
The100,3c4xym,Shotokanguy,2,Sat Jul 4 23:20:55 2015 UTC,"You can sort of see why this show has promise, right? There are more moral and ethical discussions worth having as you watch the show.  And I think that's what this is - you aren't necessarily wrong about anything (I just don't think you should dislike Clarke), you just place the blame differently.  Look, Murphy had already been a problem before this happened. Clarke was rash to run out there and accuse him in front of everybody, but she knew none of them should have the right to execute someone. They can't afford to kill each other. Murphy, however, pushed and pushed for Charlotte to pay for killing Wells, so Clarke had to protect her if she truly believed death is not a fitting punishment. When Murphy continued fighting, threatened to kill Clarke, and indirectly played a part in Charlotte killing herself, Bellamy and Clarke (and most of the camp) agreed that he was better off not living with them. He was a problem. I'm pretty sure they even ask if anyone has a problem with Murphy being banished, and no one speaks up."

This way its like yeah we banished him got a problem?"
The100,3c4xym,tanglespeck,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:28:58 2015 UTC,"These are a bunch of criminal kids who have never had any freedom. Neither Clarke nor Bellamy have lead anyone before. I think you need to watch further to understand, because in the beginning the show seems like it's going to be one thing but it quickly becomes something very different. No one starts out a big hero who will always do the right thing for everyone. And frankly if they did, none of us would be watching the show.   Without spoiling it for you, yes. Bellamy and Clarke are both at fault. So is Charlotte. Murphy is used as a scapegoat for the group because Charlotte is dead and can't be punished...and because no one likes Murphy so they both agree to make an example of him to keep the other kids in control and ensure they don't form another lynch mob. Do as we say, or you will be exiled. It's completely unfair, but this is their first lesson as new leaders. You need rules and you need a way to keep order and control and Murphy is a threat to Bellamy's handle on the group so it works for them all if he's not there.   Your reaction is totally normal. The characters pretty much did everything wrong and now you're suggesting very logical ways that this whole situation could have been handled and debating who is right and who is innocent and judging them all for how they reacted. That's what the writers want you to do. Maybe that means the show isn't for you, but like everyone else has suggested, just keep watching because you might find you love it once you adjust to the shift."
The100,3c4xym,tanglespeck,2,Sun Jul 5 11:10:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know what to say about acting. People see it differently for some reason in all things. You can find someone criticizing every Meryl Streep performance, if you look hard enough.  I've never had a problem with the acting, and there are bigger moments as the series goes on. Eliza Taylor in particular has some great performances.  The story itself? You've barely scratched the surface. It just gets more intense and interesting as you go."

The100,3c23o4,fechan,7,Sat Jul 4 01:26:01 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that the show is not completely scientifically accurate regarding radiation.   It is supposedly because they are exposed to radiation from outer space which I guess is stronger than the radiation on the ground, so the Arkers are more resistant to radiation.  The mountain men hid in their bunker to avoid the radiation, so they never were exposed to natural selection. None of them died off, and those naturally more resistant to radiation would not have been more commonplace. The rounders on the other hand were exposed to radiation the entire time, so it seems they were exposed to radiation. Those weak to it have died off, and those resistant have reproduced, so the grounders we see are the descendants of those resistant.   Again, you could nitpick that it's extremely unlikely nobody in Mt. Weather was resistant seeing as there is still a large population of Grounders after only a few generations, but resistance could have been recessive, or incomplete (inheritance), so that Mt. Weather did not have a large enough of a starting population. Therefore, it's possible none of the original population was resistant, and was so they were not able to pass it on to the Mt. Weather inhabitants we see.   TL;DR : See 1 & 2"
The100,3c23o4,sharkbait359,7,Sat Jul 4 02:17:49 2015 UTC,"Grounders also ditch babies born with defects. So they're still not 100% resistant, but they're more likely to be born resistant because when babies with mutations are born they remove them from the gene pool by casting them out. And in Sienne's case she didn't want to give up her son so the whole family was forced to leave."
The100,3c23o4,ElenaOcean,6,Sat Jul 4 08:28:56 2015 UTC,"It is possible that the sky people were genetically engineered to have vastly greater resistance to radiation. The space stations seem to have a problem with too many people, not too few.  There are so few mountain men that it can't be compared to the outside. It might be that one in ten thousand could survive the radiation. The population seems to be very low in the areas we've seen."
The100,3c23o4,corinthian_llama,8,Sat Jul 4 02:39:06 2015 UTC,"It is possible that the sky people were genetically engineered to have vastly greater resistance to radiation.   They do mention in the show that they have been genetically enhanced, so this is entirely plausible seeing as they planned on returning to Earth, which could very possibly still be radioactive. It just makes sense to have a very high tolerance to radiation in that scenario."
The100,3c23o4,CosMikos,3,Sat Jul 4 08:14:39 2015 UTC,"Evolution relies on exposure to mutagens, like radiation, or on separation of populations + a buttload of time (like thousands/millions of years). The people in space and on the ground were exposed to mutagens that caused damage to their DNA. Some of them survived it and their genes were passed on. The mountain people were an isolated population not exposed to radiation over time, so they weren't subjected to the same natural selection process as those outside bunkers.  They still have pre-war genotypes that haven't been narrowed down via natural selection, so they're unequipped to deal with the increased radiation levels on the surface. The arkers and grounders are resistant because the ones that weren't died out and a few survived and bred, just like the wolf packs of Chernobyl.  Also, in less scientifically accurate storyline, the arkers were genetically tweaked to be more resistant, so in their case natural selection had a big helping hand. While the grounders have a level of natural resistance that is higher than the mountain people, the arkers have an even higher resistance, making them better candidates for the whole radiation therapy thing.  I'd like to point out that the above explanation is 'show science', and a metric fuckton of liberties have been taken here, but that pretty much sums it up as far as the show goes."
The100,3c23o4,Amonette2012,2,Sat Jul 4 03:49:30 2015 UTC,"This. And artificial selection as well. Artificial selection is how you'd control things like blood type and physiology. Hence why Grounders exiled/killed their deformed children/citizens, or why all Arker's blood seem to work with each other and everyone (-O blood type, save for a few. Wells and Thelonius are -A)  As for the instant blood healing, well, that's either show science, or the magic of future technology.  And guys, don't expose yourself to radiation simply for building radioresistance.  Superpowers. Now that's another thing."
The100,3c23o4,Jay013,2,Sat Jul 4 08:23:53 2015 UTC,"The grounders evolved immunity to the radiation through natural selection, the Arkers were continuously exposed to low-level cosmic radiation and there was a throwaway line about genetic engineering. Point is, the grounders immunity is haphazard and incomplete (as evidenced by the grounders high rate of congenital birth defects) while the Arkers' immunity was designed. If I had to speculate as to how the immunity worked, it'd probably be by optimizing the immune system to identify and kill cells compromised by radiation (containing the damage, as well as free radicals that would damage other cells) as well as designing the cells of their body to better withstand radiation. But it'd have to be immune system centered in order for the bone marrow to work, and it makes sense that deliberately evolving the immune system would produce better and more consistent results than short term natural selection.  The Mountain men have spent their entire lives underground and likely didn't have the scientific background to do gene therapy. Plus it's a small population. A 0.1% survival rate would leave plenty of grounders left after the bombs, and wipe a few hundred people highly susceptible to radiation.    But of course, this is TV and the science on it, while better than average, serves the rule of drama."
The100,3c23o4,caesarfecit,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:28:52 2015 UTC,"It doesn't make sense-- the show is not scientifically accurate.  You have to suspend your disbelief.  But that's something you have to do with almost any work of fiction, even stuff that isn't sci fi.  For example, how realistic is it that in Friends Rachel would actually make it from a barista to a fashion buyer or whatever she was?  Or that someone like her would end up with a dorky paleonologist?  Or that Phoebe would be anything but homeless?  That the whole group would actually be friends and get up to all the same hijinks?

The100,3c00zu,KageUnui,7,Fri Jul 3 16:02:00 2015 UTC,"It is basically a ""straw that broke the camel's back situation."" The firing of victoria, along with no plan to replace her and the admins responses, have shown that there is a very blatent lack of communixation between reddits administrators and its moderators.  Victoria was the ama coordinator for pretty much all of reddit, and her being fired in this manner left the moderators with no way of contacting any people who were scheduled for amas.   For damage control, ama had to go dark while they tried to contact the admins to figure out what was going on. Other subreddits soon followed out of protest."
The100,3c00zu,ShaneH7646,3,Fri Jul 3 16:16:24 2015 UTC,"Chooter (the reddit AMA helper) was fired, fucking up major AMA subs"
The100,3c00zu,wwhideanseek,2,Fri Jul 3 16:13:18 2015 UTC,I read a few of the posts explaining it but there is one thing I don't understand. Is the protest about /u/chooter getting fired or about the mismanagement that followed? Cause I can understand if it's about the mismanagement but not if it's because she was fired.
The100,3c00zu,ElenaOcean,3,Fri Jul 3 19:58:01 2015 UTC,"It's a combination of things. The mods have been unhappy about many issues for a long while. Imagine being an iama mod and having a full schedule of ama's set up that need to be coordinated with a reddit admin. Then all of a sudden the admin is fired and there is no plan in place to help the mods get those ama's done.  Victoria was the facilitator for the group. These are not simple little events. These are planned months in advance and the team puts a ton of work into them. It is not just iama that was impacted, /r/books /r/science and several other subs used Victoria as a go between to help coordinate. We had hopes of doing the same for next season here. Not anymore. We will do it ourselves.   This is symptomatic of a larger issue. Admin has been unable/unwilling to meet the needs of the mod community on a larger scale for some time. This particular problem highlights how little concern they seem to have for the people that literally run their website. To ditch the ama mods without even so much as a ""hello""  is the biggest ""fuck you"" we could imagine."
The100,3c00zu,Amonette2012,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:07:42 2015 UTC,And now AMA has decided it's going to keep going without the admins at all because they don't trust them not to fuck with the system.

I binge watched Game of Thrones and understand the plot but when I go on the sub reddit for it I don't understand half the jokes. Althought I do understand South Park refreshes on the sub reddit for it because I've watched every episode at least twice.  I came into this show between season 1 and 2 but I understand everything becuase I took my time watching season 1 (One episode a day. If that counts as taking your time.) Then I had to wait for season 2 episodes like everyone else.  Tldr; You didn't miss anything important.

She was supposed to have died a bunch of times in the first season. More in the second. But some how the final script always has her alive. Although I'm guessing trying to keep her alive on purpose this time will end up killing her xD

The100,3c0smu,Hateside,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:04:15 2015 UTC,It was already announced somewhere that they were going to kill off a major character this season. My guess Is Lexa or raven ( raven seems so unlikely since there's no one there that could replace her skill set.
The100,3c0smu,mady16,2,Sat Jul 4 12:18:15 2015 UTC,Lexa's not considered a major character. Major means someone apart of the main cast.

The100,3bx6dx,ElenaOcean,2,Thu Jul 2 23:34:16 2015 UTC,Posting this because there had been a lot of speculation on other websites. Possibly Lexa? What do you guys think?
The100,3bx6dx,Jay013,5,Thu Jul 2 22:00:02 2015 UTC,"Try not to dig too deep into a single line of a script. ""No longer in full battle gear"" can simply mean she took off her armor and weapons for this scene. The world we've lived in for the past two seasons has been in constant war. Indra could be focusing more on her people, Lexa could be discussing politics, Octavia could be taking a well deserved break, Clarke could just be chilling in some Grounder village. It doesn't mean said girl is done fighting forever. Just means they're not decked out for battle in this scene."
The100,3bx6dx,Jay013,2,Thu Jul 2 22:18:35 2015 UTC,"Lol, it's not about fighting. People are excited because it sounds like Lexa and we don't know if she's coming back or not."

The100,3bx6dx,Jay013,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:31:41 2015 UTC,They're not going to film the two seasons back to back. FTWD wraps up around the end of this month and episode 303 is set to film at around the beginning of next month. It could be Lexa(Alyica). We'll likely find out next week for sure at Comic Con.
The100,3bx6dx,joeydeno,0,Sat Jul 4 07:45:29 2015 UTC,"It's not about filming, it's whether or not her contract will let her guest star for another network."
The100,3byy0t,RandomLoLs,4,Fri Jul 3 07:58:47 2015 UTC,"It wasn't just about prisoners in the mountain. Mt Weather didn't need the grounders anymore if they completed the harvest of the sky people. The deal wasn't only to free Lexa's people, it was to leave the grounders alone full stop. Ending a decades old war is a tempting offer. That's why she took it."
The100,3byy0t,Code_NY,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:18:52 2015 UTC,Interesting theory about a permanent peace deal but she cant be that stupid. IF she let the Mt Men rebuild and repopulated they can just re build everything lost from the dam/power generators to the acid fogs. Also now considering they make themselves radiation immune by stealing bone marrow from Arkers? This would only mean that when those Mt population reproduce they will have more people that are radiation immune. That would only make them a bigger threat in the future. I am partially sold on this but still call BS on her part. She can care at some point to save 50-100 prisoners and at one point sacrifice 300ish without a second thought.
The100,3byy0t,Code_NY,4,Fri Jul 3 08:31:42 2015 UTC,Not sure if you have seen this post from one of the writers and a comment from another. Link. Just to see things from another perspective.
The100,3byy0t,mady16,3,Fri Jul 3 09:36:55 2015 UTC,"Lexa had no idea what was behind those doors. It's easy for us to say that the grounders and sky people would inevitably win, but Lexa doesn't know that for sure. She has no idea what kind of weapons Mt Weather had behind those doors. We know that they have nothing left to defend themselves, but Lexa doesn't.  She let the people in Tondc because the war would eliminate Mt Weather. That meant no more kidnapping and reaper making. She also knew Mt Weather would just fire again if she evacuated the city. Her deal with MM eliminated the Mt Weather threat anyway and she didn't have to lose any people. That's what she wanted all along.   She had hundreds of warriors there ready to fight. Think about it: She didn't lost a single person, got rid of the the threat of the MM, and saved her people inside. All she lost was an alliance with the sky people that she didn't really need."
The100,3byy0t,Nekyia,2,Fri Jul 3 11:52:35 2015 UTC,"There are very complex reasons for her choosing to rather give in then compared to sticking with her new alliance.  You might see it as face value as, cowardly. Some might see it as a betrayal. But you have to you understand. Save >100 people and back off or attack and risk losing everything.   Keep in mind that what I just wrote... is very surface based answers... Just sit back and see what happens in the next season. Obviously, they left that as some sort of cliffhanger, right?"
The100,3byy0t,Festian,2,Fri Jul 3 08:12:21 2015 UTC,"What bothers me is that what the hell happened to blood for blood?  These mountain men have captured hundreds of grounders over the years and everything's OK after a deal, but Finn kills 16 and they're willing to risk their army to get to one guy?  And what happened to the deal to fix the reapers? We saw them clean a single group. Does Lexa just not care for the people who were turned reaper? Her decision to take the mountain men's deal just seems out of character to me."
The100,3byy0t,Shotokanguy,2,Sun Jul 5 12:36:31 2015 UTC,"To Lexa, ""blood must have blood"" may just be a way to get her warriors pumped up. It's not some binding law.  I mean...it's completely in character for her to make ruthless decisions for the good of her people. That's how she was the whole time."
The100,3byy0t,FiestaSE,0,Sun Jul 5 14:16:56 2015 UTC,Ah thank you ... that is another point of view I never considered.   Yeah that blood for blood crap is kinda stupid. I feel like the writers or the author or the book came up with just to kill off Finn ( I havent read the books so not sure if its the same on the books) BECAUSE they never asked blood for blood when Clarke and her friends fry more than 300 grounders during the battle in season 1 with their landing ship. After that Lexa is all like lets lesbian kiss and be best BFF's for evaaaa ... No one ever asked for blood for that. But when it came to Finn they were ready to sacrifice 1000s of  people to fight the Arkers outside their base.  Now if people are going to argue that Clarke was forgiven for those 300 because they were warriors and Finn killed only innocent villagers then I point towards the Mountain men who captured innocent people and hung them upside down to drain blood!!! How can they not be just as stubborn and sacrifice 1000s of warriors to get revenge.
The100,3byy0t,nomeras,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:41:29 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm in the same boat as you. I'm looking forward to seeing the repercussions of that decision by Lexa next season. Doesn't make any sense :/
The100,3byy0t,ShaneH7646,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:13:07 2015 UTC,Well if the village had evacuated then they would've caught Bellamy before he desstroyed the acid fog so there would be no chance for them to get back their people.

The100,3bracn,ChiralChupacabra,8,Wed Jul 1 14:51:55 2015 UTC,"I think if Octavia was pre-pubescent it would be creepy. But in their world even children are warriors. It's not like the girl had any innocence to be robbed of, and in Lincoln's world she's just not that young. Anyway 16 is the age of consent here in Canada so I'm honestly not particularly disturbed by it. I think once people pass a certain age maturity levels matter a lot more. Anyway we don't know their exact ages. Octavia could be 17 and he could be 20 and that would be perfectly normal.   Don't get me wrong if someone my age (mid twenties) dated someone Octavia's age I'd make fun of them, but that's it. I'd support it if the girl were mature and at least of the age of consent (16).   TL DR : Octavia is already at the age of consent in many modern countries. In the future where children fight in wars, Octavia just isn't considered that young anymore. I mean think about the Grounders trying to kill of The 100. The 100 are teens but the grounders saw them as adults. So Octavia is considered an adult to the grounders.  EDIT : Octavia is turning 17 if I remember correctly"
The100,3bracn,manicmelancholic,10,Wed Jul 1 15:15:18 2015 UTC,"Eeeeeeeh... Not entirely with you there. She has a shitton of innocence to be robbed of. She was raised in a hole in the ground. LITERALLY.  However, I feel that the writers of the show (or the actress, or the director, I dunno) never really portrayed what that kind of thing does to a person. She should be completely socially awkward, among other things.  The only possible explanation is that she got all of those pesky behavioral problems over with because she stayed more than a few months in space jail (do we actually know how long she stayed there?). Which requires less suspension of disbelief.  Aaanyway, that was a tangent, but basically I'm not too bothered by it either. They're all considered adults. Though isn't Linc younger than 25-30? That didn't seem quite right."
The100,3bracn,MeropeRedpath,6,Wed Jul 1 18:01:30 2015 UTC,"I always figured that because Octavia's mother was trading favors she picked up a lot of the way she acted from her. She's sane because her brother looked out for her, but her actions regarding men are really overly confident for someone who should be socially awkward like you say, so maybe she just started out imitating the way her mother was with men, thinking that that's how you behave normally?"
The100,3bracn,ElenaOcean,2,Wed Jul 1 20:25:52 2015 UTC,"That's a really fair point, and I didn't consider that.  Actually it is so fucking creepy. Octavia was basically in the room when her mother was servicing different men. Damn."
The100,3bracn,MeropeRedpath,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:52:25 2015 UTC,I wanna say Lincoln has to be at least 25.  It's never said in the show.
The100,3bracn,ChiralChupacabra,5,Wed Jul 1 19:59:32 2015 UTC,"I think he's just played by an older looking actor. Eliza Taylor is like 28 playing an 18 year old, she just happens to look slightly closer to the age of her character than Lincoln who I'm betting is at most Bellamy's age (22-23)  That being said no one looks the right age. All the teens look older than teens should because they're played by older actors. They were probably looking for a Sexy younger looking dude but got mesmerized by Lincoln's abbs"
The100,3bracn,manicmelancholic,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:18:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm actually pretty certain Lincoln is supposed to be 20-22. Clarke is played by a 28 year old. Lincoln looking older doesn't mean he is. But I just assumed he was Bellamy's age which is about 22. I see your point in that Octavia Should have been innocent but she wasn't written as innocent and is always portrayed as fairly mature. Different writers and this relationship could have been creepy, I just think she's of a maturity level where it's not creepy."
The100,3bracn,manicmelancholic,2,Thu Jul 2 02:16:06 2015 UTC,"I think you're mixing up Clarke and Octavia. Marie just turned 29, but Eliza is 25."

Lincoln is probs around 25, max. That's not a big difference, and is legal in most parts of the developed world."

I doubt Lincoln's over 25, he's probably around Bellamy's age.The writer's probably don't even have a set age for him. All the actors are a lot older than the characters they play (except maybe Alycia), Marie just turned 29, Eliza's 25, Bob's 30, so it's probable that Lincoln just looks older because of the actor."

The100,3br3tr,Jay013,4,Wed Jul 1 13:53:13 2015 UTC,"Previously on The 100   Cue Clarke in Mt. Weather. Introduction, harvest chamber, and escape. Cue the beginning of the alliance plot. Kane and Jaha with Lexa, Finn and the massacre, Finn's death Cue Lexarke kiss. Cue the war. The fight, the betrayal, the deaths. Cue Jaha walking into the mansion. Cue Alie.    Flashback  Mr. Lighthouse Dude is presenting the ALIE program to investors and government workers, appearing as a program on a TV screen connected to a laptop. Mr. Lighthouse places down some futuristic device, perhaps something circular with light rays coming out of it. Alie's hologram figure takes form. ""Hello, my name is Alie."" government and investors are impressed. Alie tilts her head and moves her eyes, as if calculating the people in the room. Static. Camera zooms out revealing that it was actually a recording, Murphy's eating some crackers with scotch, theme music starts to build.  THE 100 opening theme begins.  Jaha wakes up in a white room. He doesn't seem weirded out. Of course Alie would have explained somethings, and showed him his room. Alie appears and asks if he slept well. Jaha mentions he needs to get his friend. Alie says there will be time for that. Alie walks him around the mansion, Sanskava are walking the halls. Out of the corner, a familiar voice calls out ""Theelonus!"" It's Zoran. Zoran's family is here. His father apologizes for what he did, Jaha being all Jahesus forgives him. He says ""So this is the city of light."" Alie and the Sanskava explain.  A day the war. Cue overhead shot of Camp Jaha, before cutting to Medical. Kane walks into medical with his rifle on it's sling. Abby's helping Raven and the injured recover from the marrow extraction and injuries from battle. Abby sees Kane and before she sees anything, she just nods her heads after seeing the look on Kane's face. He approaches her and says ""Don't worry, we'll find her. Clarke's a tough girl."" Raven tries to get up, but Abby stops her. Raven makes a remark about how if Clarke doesn't want to be found, she'll make sure of it. And another remark of how she can handle herself. Kane and Abby talk about how they don't know if the Grounders are their enemies again, and if so, they might hurt Clarke.  Outside Camp Jaha  Search party's back, and Monty asks Bellamy if there's been any luck in finding Clarke. Bellamy shakes his head. He's decked out in Ark Guard gear. His face shows mixed emotions. On one side he wants to find Clarke to have the family whole again, but on the other, he wants her to find what she needs from this little excursion. Meanwhile Jasper's still upset about what happened to Maya. He's mad at Monty and Octavia. Monty for letting Clarke irradiate the level, and Octavia for not getting her to a suit and 02 tank in time. He's stuck in a slump and the other characters are having a hard time helping him. On the other side of the camp, Octavia and Lincoln are talking about home. Is Lincoln staying in Camp Jaha? Is he going back to Tondc? How will he be perceived?  commercial break  Back in the Lighthouse  Murphy loads up another recording. Mr. Lighthouse's voice starts playing. He's talking about the progress of the ALIE Program. Alie is learning, as all Artificially Intelligent beings should. Video shows Mr. Lighthouse teaching Alie different things. Screen flashes white, and we transition from a video to the end of a flashback. On the other side, Alie is telling her story to Jaha. The two are sitting on a white table, and Jaha is served a drink by Sienne. She smiles at him as she pours the drink. Alie continues the story of her development. Flashback ends with a scene of Mr. Lighthouse talking about Alie's development. ""I think she's ready.""   commercial break  Camp Jaha Medical  Wick finished up whatever he was doing and walks into Medical with a brace, shaking it with a ""look what I've got"" grin. Raven sighs, and lies back down with a groan, but with a slight laugh. Wick says ""It's a good design! And it's pretty dam resistant."" Raven rolls her eyes at Wick's dam joke. Scene goes quiet, and Wick walks up to Raven and gives her a kiss. Raven pulls away, still under the trauma of everything that's happened. Wick comforts her. ""You're gonna get through this.""  Meanwhile, David is on crutches to help him get around. He's giving his son some words of advice. Nathan is in Ark Guard uniform, being trained as member of the Guard along side Bellamy, both under Kane's guidance with David's recommendation.   Monty checks in on Jasper, but is met with angry looks. Monty leaves and bumps into Harper. Cue the ""He'll come around"" speech followed by the ""you saved us""  Kane is talking with Abby regarding the treaty. They discuss that if the whole ""cure the Reapers"" deal goes well, they might have peace with Tondc. Speaking of which, Abby needs Kane to deliver a package to Jackson at Tondc. A medpack containing things they need. Kane beckons Bellamy and Nate to accompany him. Octavia and Lincoln want to come with.  Commercial break  Kane & Co. arrive at Tondc where Jackson, Monroe, and other Arkers are helping Grounders recover and treating the Reapers. Kane is greeted by Indra who still shows respect for Kane. They discuss politics surrounding the treaty. Kane says they'll honour their end and help the Reapers transition, but questions where Tondc stands. References are made to Lexa regarding the treaty. Lincoln meets with his bro Nyko.  Meanwhile...  Murphy continues watching the recordings. Mr. Lighthouse has initiated Alie's prime protocol. The videos and Alie's stories start to overlap. Mr. Lighthouse's version speaks of Alie going against her programming and causing chaos. Alie's story has her following her programming and saving the world. Alie's Story ends, Mr. Lighthouse's recordings end. Alie directs the conversation towards the nuke she has. Jaha finds a way to change the topic and leave the mansion to go back for Murphy.  Murphy finds a corrupted recording, this one seems to have been made by Alie. He tries to watch it, but only short stuttered clips show.  commercial break  Murphy's checking up on his wounds when he hears shouting outside. He goes outside armed with a gun he found in the lighthouse. He points and calls out. Jaha turns around, Murphy laughs and lowers the weapon. ""You actually came back."" Jaha says ""I promised didn't I?"" Murphy replies with ""You also promised Craig and Richards and Harris that you'd get them here. The two fight about the journey, and about whether or not Murphy should come with Jaha. Jaha has been fed stories of sanctuary and an intent to save the world by Alie. Murphy has been fed stories about chaos by Mr. Lighthouse. Jaha says something that makes Murphy reluctantly agree to to go with Jaha, calling the prime reason being to just get his arm treated properly. Lot's of Murphy Sarcasm here.  At Tondc, Kane and Indra come to a mutual decision to maintain peace between Tondc and The Ark. Octavia is recognized by Indra and Tondc warriors, but chooses to differentiate from them. Jackson's doing great work. Bellamy and Miller are talking about whether or not things will stay this calm.  Fade to black. Fade into the forest.   A hooded Clarke with a knapsack filled with scavenged material exits the woods and arrives at a Grounder village unfamiliar to us. It's not tondc, but it's not Polis either. She isn't quite there yet. She stands just outside of the treeline, looking over the village. Camera cuts to a scene of the village ahead with Clarke looking forward. Screenshot worthy moment. Clarke walks into the village and the show fades to credits.    Not sure where the commercial breaks go since I watched both seasons through netflix (yay Canada). I've never seen commercials xD. Anyway, this more or less. This is what I'd like to see with some fillers in between to match the time better."

The100,3br3tr,Shotokanguy,2,Sat Jul 4 16:50:16 2015 UTC,"Quite a tonal shift from Bellamy and Murphy's excerpts to Clarke's...  I think it would be cool to hold off on Clarke until the final few minutes of the episode. Not only will she not really be doing anything worth following right off the bat, but you have the anticipation factor to consider. Let the audience keep wondering when Clarke will show up, and then surprise them at the end.  I can't imagine what they'll be introducing that is ""more sci-fi"", but I hope it only has to do with the ALIE plotline. I like that the Arkers and Grounders are just trying to build a good life out in the wilderness of post-nuclear apocalypse Earth. It doesn't need...laser guns...or robots, or something."
The100,3br3tr,ShaneH7646,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:56:50 2015 UTC,"I actually agree with you on that one, I think they'll leave the ""where's Clarke?"" until the last few minutes. Either she'll be kidnapped and they'll reveal her by pulling  the bag off her head, or she'll be up a tree pulling a bow on like...Emerson or something. They'll probably do the same with Lexa I guess too, since they've got so many fans riding on it they could tease that out all the way to the finale if they wanted to.   I'm also not sure how I feel about the sci-fi tbh. I like the scenery as it is now, even seeing Alie's house was kinda jarring and took me out of the story a little bit. When everything else is fallen down, how is there a perfect mansion left? Unless the mansion is also part of the hologram."
The100,3br3tr,nomeras,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:46:05 2015 UTC,"My theories  MAJOR TIME SKIP maybe a week or two? maybe even a month  First half of the episode will either begin with jaha/murphy, starting the season in a white room again? or the camp doing something casual until something unusual happens, grounders not so friendly?  I think clarke will show up in the second half of the episode either brutally beaten by something or running from something? and she will look completely different to how she left, like a grounder  finally the episode will end with a major cliffhanger that makes us all fall to the grounder in shock"

The100,3bnpte,paris86,3,Tue Jun 30 22:20:13 2015 UTC,I felt the same way at first until I got to the end of episode 4. The characters are better developed afterwards and the show has less of a cw guilty pleasure teen drama feel to it.
The100,3bnpte,Shotokanguy,2,Wed Jul 1 00:09:32 2015 UTC,"Murphy's Law is the turning point. The characters realize they're being asses and get shit in order after this episode.

The characters change and develop and it's astonishing how much depth they have by the end of season 2. If you have a visceral dislike of them now, that may only grow before this is done. If you just don't 'get' them yet then hold on because you gotta see where this goes. I think The 100 is one of the very best shows on television and would crawl on broken glass to see more of it. You need to get through 6 episodes of season 1 imo to make that call for yourself. Season 2 was hands down the best thing that ever aired on The CW."

Generally we keep the mod stuff quiet but for the Great Flair War of 2015 we make the exception cuz it is soooo funny. It's an injoke at this point for the whole community. Don't even get us started on the color Orange. :)
The100,3bmkwp,ShaneH7646,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:51:38 2015 UTC,"I'm out of the loop here, what's the issue with flairs?"
The100,3bmkwp,ElenaOcean,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:17:54 2015 UTC,"If you have ever seen the classic comedy ""Who's on First?"" that is pretty much the only way to describe our mod team work on flairs. Flairs seem to a general subscriber like a simple idea. They actually are not at all simple in the backroom. There are a lot of things to consider and a lot of different decisions that have to be made for each type of flair that exists on the sub. Elena and I have had such a crazy time of it getting this nailed down we have had to get on IRC just to figure out what exactly it is we are talking about. LOL it  brought us to the point where the only thing to do was either  laugh or drink. I did both :)  In the end tho it also made us even better friends so it was worth all the struggle. She rocks my socks."
The100,3bmkwp,Kishara,2,Tue Jun 30 15:25:02 2015 UTC,haha :P so is the issue the design off the flairs or the setting up of them? or can you 2 just not decide on it?

The100,3blt7e,tanglespeck,5,Tue Jun 30 06:53:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just me, but I am against the commercialisation of fanfiction."
The100,3blt7e,FrostlyGrim,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:03:28 2015 UTC,"Why is that?   Now given, a lot of fanfiction writers are young and inexperienced, so often the market is flooded with low-caliber content that does nothing to stop your show cravings during the hiatus. But every once and a while you find a gem which not only helps get you through until the next episode's air date, but expands on a part of the story universe in a rich and unexpected way.  Why shouldn't skilled writers get proper credit and pay out for their hard work? Creative minds naturally latch onto good story ideas ...I mean, heck, isn't that sort of what a spec script is? Acceptable fanfiction?"
The100,3blt7e,Jay013,5,Tue Jun 30 07:24:51 2015 UTC,"My opinion? I stand just a tilt towards against. Why? It's a bit like the paid mods fiasco Steam had with Skyrim.   Yes there are modders who deserve a little bonus for their work, but there are also those who simply want to cash in. They all love Skyrim, but not the content fans make out of it    It's the same here. Yes there are decent writers who deserve a bonus, but there is a lot of crap. Fanfic is just a little thing to expand people's imagination of the world of The 100 like mods are to the gameplay of Skyrim. But start putting a price on it, and things get iffy.   One good test run with a mod doesnt mean I want to pay for it. Just how one good chapter doesn't mean I'm ready to pay for someone's fanfic. There's no screening process, no quality control like there are with novels I find at a bookstore. It's not new or original, you're simply using an existing formula. That appeals to people in different ways.   Yes this service is optional, and people can write for profit or write for free. But once people realize ""shit I could be legally selling this"" it'll turn into frenzy of people trying to get as much content out there to maximize profits. Some will be good, some will suck hard. All I'm saying is that there's going to be a change in quality and quantity for both sides.   The best option is a ""donate"" option. Donate to those who made fantastic work. They get their bonus, and can make another gem. Everything else is simply available for viewing with donation at your discretion. But be honest. If you paid for a fanfic and didn't like it. As in really didn't like it. As in can't get past the first eight pages, would you regret buying it?"
The100,3blt7e,FrostlyGrim,2,Tue Jun 30 09:32:06 2015 UTC,"Thankfully with Kindle Worlds there is a quality control and screening process, as the submitted works go through the same publishing approval that normal books go through (apart from the page count minimum being much lower).   If anything, it should be a bigger guarantee that the work is not only acceptably written, but something that's similar enough to the show that the show itself gave a stamp of approval.   Conditionally I do agree that widespread commercialization can poison a writing project that should have just been a love-child, though. Part of why I enjoy writing fanfiction is because it's low pressure--I don't need to worry about worldbuilding or explaining things as they can be assumed to be audience knowledge, and I don't have to try as hard to hook the readers as I know they would only have found my work if it was what they were already looking for. Just going into the writing with that mindset creates a more relaxed product.  But not everything can be free forever, so we can only fight it to a point. Thankfully (as I'm sure you've seen) Kindle Worlds isn't booming with popularity yet, so we probably won't see a huge influx of The 100 quantity-over-quality works for a while yet. I am excited to see some good stuff come out of it first.  Your point about needing more than just 'one good ___' before a product feels legitimate enough to deserve money could apply to any type of book, though, as could the concept of buyer's remorse. Yes, fanfiction writers will probably need to prove themselves a little more seriously than the other different writer types (due to their current reputation of being 'unskilled') but I suspect they'll build audiences with time just the same. In a perfect world, a donate option would be best for all sorts of projects, but no one can live off of that. Arguably no one should be living off their fanfiction writing 'profits' either, though, so it's all a wash anyway."
The100,3blt7e,isforwinrars,3,Tue Jun 30 10:40:58 2015 UTC,"For me is mainly because fanfiction normally is written for the love of the characters/world's and the community surrounding it. I'm against big corporations capitalising on those things.   Also it can sort fanfiction into different classes to what is acceptable and what is not. Eg one of the rules in the link you provided says no pornography. I know the difference between outright smut and a fic with a sex scene every few chapters. But what if that rule is abused because the ship is slash and banned. Times are changing, but a lot of tv shows I follow ignore slash or act like it's dirty secret and hardly tolerate those fandoms. A popular femslash ship Swan Queen, had one of the actors call it porn ""Once Upon a Time in my Pants"", but most of the shippers I know want a real deep meaningful love story comparable to het ships.   One of the best things about fanfiction is the diverse storytelling that happens. I would hate to see that limited because the parent company didn't want certain types of stories to be published.   I know a lot of skill goes in writing good fanfiction and it is a legitimate piece of work. I am not against writers getting paid and I personally have purchased a lot of books that was originally fanfic (particularly Xena ubers lol). I don't know though I think there is a difference between a company saying this type of fanfiction is allowed and publishing it versus a fanfic author rewriting their fanfic into an original story and selling it."
The100,3blt7e,Shotokanguy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:36:10 2015 UTC,"I am happy to hear you're currently supporting certain fanfiction writers! I do too.  As to your point about a parent company limiting creativity, I am confused. There is nothing preventing fanfiction writers from self-publishing the original way (via fanfiction.net or general internet) if they don't get approved to publish through Kindle, so there's really no way to lose. If anything, more creativity will be inspired because Kindle Worlds is trying to legitimize and normalize fanfiction writing, so not only will a bigger audience be drawn to it, but more authors will get their work seen (and hopefully they won't starve along the way).   As it is now, good fanfiction is few and far between because the market is overfull of bad fics...due to the fact that there is not yet a medium that ONLY publishes the good fanfictions. Most websites post every single 'creative' work submitted, without any filters, which hurts readership because a person can only sift through garbage looking for a good gem for so long. With Kindle Worlds, only the gems will be approved, so readers will start flocking back. It is a good thing for the fanfiction writer. Plus, those no-rules fanfiction websites will still exist for any other works that had their creativity stifled via a veto from Kindle Worlds. Y'know?   Plus as an added bonus (I posted more about this elsewhere on the thread) in this particular case, both the TV show executives and original book author agreed to and are encouraging spin off fanfictions. The author is quoted to say that she's excited to see what people can come up with for the characters. They chose to do this. And if neither party wants a gory sex tale told with their characters, I don't have a problem with it. There will be those types of stories elsewhere on the interwebs, restrictions or not...those types of writers are driven by a different kind of motivation. *cringes"
The100,3blt7e,Jay013,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:26:54 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Though while I am a big supporter of fanfiction in general both as a sort of practice arena for aspiring authors and as another way for a fandom to celebrate a particular cannon/source material and generally show their love for/build a community around it (similar to people making gifsets, fanvids, podcasts etc) I am totally against people being able to monetize another persons IP, also I imagine most original authors of the relevant source material would find it pretty disrespectful/objectionable."
The100,3blt7e,ElenaOcean,2,Sun Jul 5 07:46:01 2015 UTC,"This is strange and interesting to me. I've read plenty of fanfiction. A lot of it is completely unremarkable. But the best stories I've read are as well written and entertaining as the source material, so...I don't care that it's not wholly original, if it is good entertainment.  Paying to read it is a tricky concept, but it seems this site is devoted to doing it right.  Also, if there are any Mass Effect fans here...read ""Interstitium"". Best fanfiction I've ever read. The author does a BETTER job than BioWare did with the characters."
The100,3blt7e,Jay013,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:15:17 2015 UTC,"So I got uber excited to find The 100 on Kindle Worlds, because after binge-watching S1 on Netflix (I haven't started S2 yet, but give me 24 hours) my mind was already buzzing with hypothetical storylines for some of the other teens sent down to Earth. I mean, out of the 100 initial kids we only see what happens to about a dozen of them ...and even then we don't see what's going on at camp half the time. So much potential!  I was surprised no one had mentioned it in the subreddit yet, so I thought I'd go ahead and share the link with the follow-up question: what kind of prequel/shipping/butterfly effect spin-off storylines are you hoping to see?   I know there's already some threads on here related to that subject, which I'm reading in separate tabs right now, but those weren't discussed under the mindset that someone might actually write and explore the ideas at length.   Personally I'd be interested in seeing what Marcus Kane's youth was like growing up on the Ark with his Earth-tree-religious mother, and what day-to-day ship life was like back when everyone still believed they'd die without ever seeing Earth."
The100,3blt7e,ElenaOcean,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:18:58 2015 UTC,"> I was surprised no one had mentioned it in the subreddit yet  We don't really pay much attention to fanfic around here. Fanfic has only been mentioned like three times. Four tops. All text posts. One was a discussion on fanfic's effect on perception of the show/vice versa.   But I'm not the right person to explain this. /u/kishara, wanna take over?"
The100,3blt7e,Jay013,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:10:30 2015 UTC,"I'm confused about what this is exactly, are people paying for fanfic on kindle?"

The100,3blt7e,Jay013,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:34:34 2015 UTC,"Maybe its just me, but it seems kinda shitty to make money off someone else's creative content. Fair enough if you're doing it for fun to share with people online but if you're making money off it...I dunno. I get that they're probably trying to cash in on the whole 50 shades thing, and for amazon/kindle that's a smart plan to make money off unsuspecting new authors, but if I was an author or a producer this would just piss me off. If someone's work ends up being a fly away success, how does copyright work?"
The100,3blt7e,FrostlyGrim,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:54:01 2015 UTC,"Copyright holder should take majority claim if that were the case. Hell it should be the case for individual cases as well.  I gave my arguement in ankther comment. It's pretty much like the Skyrim Paid Mods fiasco.   Modders make content, modders can choose to sell or give for free. Bethesda (copyright holder) takes majority. A lot of crap content came out from people wanting to cash in. The good content stayed free by choice of creators. Protest happened by players and modders. Market crashed in less than 3 days. Bethesda cancels paid mods, keeps fan made content free.   Similar concept here. Replace players for readers and modders for writers.  If The 100 is on this list, execs probably thought they could profit off it."
The100,3blt7e,Jay013,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:01:58 2015 UTC,Also wasn't there some rule that the modders couldn't get the money until a certain amount had been reached? So the copyright holder would get the majority of the money while the modder would probably have to wait weeks if not months before they actually saw any money
The100,3blt7e,Kishara,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:06:56 2015 UTC,"$100 minimum. Yep.   IIRC, amazon self-published writers don't get money until after a certain amount is reached as well. Might be different for the fanfic tho."
The100,3blt7e,Kishara,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:09:33 2015 UTC,I assume it would be the same for fanfic? I can't see why it would be any different.
The100,3blt7e,Kishara,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:12:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah it would probably be the same. If you get approved for a fanfic publish, then it auto-starts an amazon author profile for you so you can use all the normal analytics, etc."
The100,3blt7e,wwhideanseek,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:32:15 2015 UTC,"That's pretty standard. Sometimes it is out of the game company's hands, as in order to pay outside contractors they often have to pair with a third party company who will put their own rules on things.  Plus, if the modder was just making the mod 'for the love of it' then they wouldn't care about being able to cash out or not anyway. They'd just be happy people are using their creation and enjoying it."
The100,3blt7e,Amonette2012,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:31:28 2015 UTC,"I'd find free fanfiction to be more shitty  (if we were to rate it on a scale), as it's written without the consent or knowledge of the original copyright holder.

The100,3blt7e,Amonette2012,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:33:50 2015 UTC,We left the post up as mods but I thought it was a bad place to post it myself. Spec scripts are different than fan fic in that they are serious works that are submitted to try and gain employment as a tv writer for a show. But still in the end they are just fan fic with a different purpose imo.

I went into the ceiling, where there was just enough space for me to curl on my side and relax in the relative quiet away from everyone.  Of course, there was no way to tell time while I was up there. I fell asleep once without meaning to, and when I woke up, I panicked. What time was it? Had I slept through school? Had I gone all the way around and slept through my internship at the archives?   So I wasn't looking when I started to shimmy my way out of there, backwards. I got onto one of the girders crossing the hallway and sat on it, feet dangling. And then I swung them out so that I could jump down far enough away that I wouldn't land on one of those annoying parts of the floor that are like speed bumps.

Yeah I'm not quite sure how this happened! I think people just started going with it and before too long we had our own imaginary camp. It's certainly moved on from where it started, which is partly why I wanted to get some feedback and see if people are liking this direction. We could totally go back towards the earlier style where it was more about challenges, but once we met the grounders it kinda morphed into a story..."

The100,3besgp,Skykru,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:58:26 2015 UTC,"I always enjoyed Earth Skills. It was a fun class, especially for someone in Hydro Station where the most eventful part of my day is when the filters might need changing or a pump needs fixing. Being the Earth Skills nerd I am, I spent most of my time reading up on the history of the people before the war. How they survived, what they used, so on. It wasn't long before I took my studies off the books. Using scrap metal from the storage depot, I started making weapons. Knives, spears, and my favourite, bows. bows took me a bit to get the hang of making, but eventually I got it.   But where to practice?  I decided that same storage room would be the best place. Move all the stuff up and clear out a space in the back where I can shoot unseen. Sure I didn't get much distance, but at least I could do something. Of course, it didn't take long before my little excursions were discovered. Some of the other Arkers caught on to what I was doing and wanted in on it. So I said sure. I showed them my books, and they started learning and training in Earth Skills and Combat.  As we grew in numbers, we cleared out more of the storage depot, systematically moving material from this one to the next, but still leaving enough to make things seem normal. Yeah, that was the life.  Until we got caught.  I declared myself the leader of this little gathering, and after seeing the weapons and fighting, I was arrested on the charges of ""Possession of unauthorized weaponry"" and ""Conspiracy of inciting revolution.""  There was no coming out of this. I was getting floated for sure. I didn't go straight to the airlock though. First I was thrown in a cell. I was there for about four days before the alarms started going off and all the cell doors opened. What the hell was happening? From a distance I could hear one of the Councilors talking about sending the kids on a dropship to Earth. It was a way out. I decided to use the chaos to sneak back to the Storage Depot, I shouldn't have been surprised to have found it shut down and brought back to normal. I headed straight for my room, filling a bag with what I could. The weapons I had made or found for my own private collection was still hidden behind a wall panel. Sadly I couldn't take anything big, like my crappy springsteel bow, without being seen. I took what I could and headed to Alpha to sneak aboard the drop ship. I knew I could die, but I also knew if I stayed I'd be floated. So was it ""maybe die"" or die for sure? I think there's only one clear option.    And that's my story. That's how I'm here. I don't know what happened to the rest of the people in the Storage Depot with me. Maybe they were put on work detail for being a part of it, maybe they were floated. Who knows?"

Into the classics, the old school music from the '80s and a fan of any films that survived the end of the world, that sort of thing. Give me Tarantino movies over the lighter stuff any day. Also, slightly off topic, I'm a massive fan of Football/Soccer, and have constantly spent many times watching old games over and over again. If football was still a thing, I'd support Arsenal FC. My first exposure was to them was an old finding of the 2002 FA Cup Final and I've not looked back.  So naturally when I learnt from my friend that one of the teachers of Earth Skills had a massive record collection of old music that he'd kept stored up for the years, I knew I had to see it for myself so I agreed to a dare that I could break in and listen to it. However, as it turned out, the teacher also happened to annoy the wrong sort of people on the Ark - I never found out what happened to him - and I walked into the room to find his corpse and a knife left there where he'd been stabbed.   So naturally I got the blame, the attackers got away, and I got arrested, a week before I was old enough to be floated. I still haven't found out the identity of the old man's killer. The old man whose daughter also happened to be the very friend that dared me to break into his room in the first place."
The100,3besgp,Jay013,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:30:50 2015 UTC,"Being Bipolar on the ark wasn't easy. I'm impulsive, it took all my will power to not break the laws which I did not agree with. Our doctors didn't know much about mental illness. It's mostly preventable by our doctors, but they didn't realize I had it until it was too late. So they put me on Lithium like they used to give people before the war. In our small population mental illness is fairly rare, although depression runs rampant as we all know...   I made a mistake. I was 24 years old when it happened. I was in a bipolar manic phase and thus was being very impulsive. The ark was a metal coffin which seemed to be suffocating me. I felt the weight of my confinement and it made crave something else.. something different.   I didn't want to go to work. I wanted to get drunk and smoke pot. I was going to be a psychologist, I was going to make sure no one on the ark ever suffered because of their mental illness again.. but I didn't.   Anyway so I was manic, and I had some moon shine. And I felt happy but anxious so I smoked some pot to calm down.   And then an ancient alarm sounded. Officers suddenly swarmed into my bedroom. I was 24. I was going to be floated.   So I did what anyone in my position would do a pulled a full out cray-cray. ""Oh the lords of the skies told me to!"" I exclaimed and then added ""I know you're reading my mind and you know this is true."" for added realism.   I'm not beautiful but I'm cute enough. A guard has a crush on me. He tells me he Will ""float"" me by sending me to Earth. He says this is on the condition that I keep a close eye on the mods (Kish, Elena and Ammonette in this case) and kill them if they cause problems.   Being that I was stoned and drunk and manically seeking adventure - I said sure why not? I knew I'd never actually have to look out for these dangerous individuals as long as they never perceived me as a threat. I'd talk more about this but I worry the mods will find out I was brought to Earth to deal with them... whichever way I see fit. Now that I'm on Earth I have no interest in killing them even if the person who hired me insists upon it. So don't worry folks, I may have been hired as a double agent but I'm on your side and any information I give to my employer about you will false.   I try to keep a low profile these days. Without medication to keep my manic depression at bay I can be a little weird and quirky. It's okay, come smoke pot with me so you can get on my weird level.   Anyway I'd say more but I don't want my employer to know I'm not really his agent and I'm not bothering to keep an eye on the mods. Let's here why the rest of you came down. If anyone else believes they were hired by the same male guard to come to Earth and keep an eye/control over the moderators please contact me. We can bring him down together."

The100,3bah22,justoneplz,0,Sat Jun 27 22:30:35 2015 UTC,"I have a have a few theory's about all of these and they all come down to poor writing lol  There are a few things that without a clear and radical reason, don't make any sense in the show.  1) They believe in reincarnation. And believe in it strongly enough that they run their government around it. I see no reason why is would happen 100 years in the future even after a nuclear war (then again, I don't have precognition). Religions change and evolve over time, usually slowly. To me it doesn't make sense that a region that is predominantly christian would all of the sudden completely change core tenets to Dharmic beliefs leaving nothing that resembles Christianity.  2) Government. Again, baring extreme circumstances, governments change slowly over time usually. And even more so, personal political beliefs. Why would a group of Americans COMPLETELY change the way of governing and also change all of their core political beliefs to thinking that A) they should be governed by a tribal dictatorship that is B) run by children who are C) appointed by the belief that they are the reincarnation of the old leader. Those 3 things go COMPLETELY against, what I would say, an overwhelming majority of Americans political beliefs.  3) Fear of technology. I've heard the theory's that MW was the one behind this but I don't buy it. Technology is just too ingrained in American culture for this to happen, especially that the war happened in 2052. Imagine what we're going to be like in 37 years. You're going to have adults that have lived their entire lives with smartphones/computers/etc... You can't say that A) all that tech would just POOF disappear and/or that people would be afraid of it just because that someone said to be.  4) Language. This one does and doesn't make sense. The reasoning behind it is believable but the execution in the show doesn't match the explanation. To me it would make much more sense if everyone spoke English but only the warriors spoke Trigedasleng. And now that I'm thinking about it, MW only revealed themselves 50 or so years before the show. If Trigedasleng was developed then (which is what the theory would require), that would mean that everyone except the warriors would have to stop speaking English, start developing Trigedasleng and only use that in their day to day lives. On the other side of the coin, if Trigedasleng evolved in the 97 years (HIGHLY unlikely), it makes no sense that the warriors know perfect English.  5) There are some others but I can't think of them right now...  IMO, the way that all these things could somewhat work is if the show took place much later in the future, like 300 years or so. 2149 is just too soon for any of this to make sense. But then again, that is just my opinions. I really love the show and just look past these, but as of right now I just chalk them up to ""poor"" writing and forced plot development."

Monty does fit some Asian stereotypes, but he breaks others...He was busted on the Ark for growing pot and/or other drugs. Correctly me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that is an Asian stereotype?  And even if Monty does adhere to Asian stereotypes, he is still a well-formed character (considering he is a minor character) that has shown himself to be kind-hearted, loyal, and clever.

The100,3bafjw,mororon,7,Sat Jun 27 12:45:29 2015 UTC,This show is the opposite of racist. Anya is a strong Nepalese leader with Tibetan descent. Bellamy is a strong leader with half-Filipino descent. Raven is a strong smart empowered woman with Hispanic descent. Monty is just a strong smart empowered man with South Korean descent. They're not being stereotypical by making him a smart character. They're just saying that anyone from any racial background can be smart or a strong leader or anything they want to be. Raven is Hispanic and just as smart as Monty. Anya is Nepalese and just as strong of a leader as Bellamy or Clarke. There are many more actors/actresses with different backgrounds and all are represented well. This show is representing that your racial background doesn't hinder what you do or who you are.

At least I think that's where it started. That's where people started mentioning it here. You haven't missed anything in the show, but we don't know a lot about either of them so I guess it's still a possibility?"
The100,3bafjw,ElenaOcean,2,Sat Jun 27 21:12:36 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily think Monty and Miller are gay or have crushes on each other, but I always got the vibe that Monty was in love with Jasper. And like I wasn't watching this with any sort of agenda in mind...It just seemed like his feelings for Jasper went beyond that of platonic friendship. Speaking as a gay person, it was just a vibe I got...Nothing textually explicit that I could point to that would say LOOK AT THIS BIG OL GAY!!! but it is just a feeling."
The100,3bafjw,whoiskatherine,2,Sun Jun 28 03:53:26 2015 UTC,Ah. Get outta here.  There is nothing indicating either one of them is gay.   Nothing
The100,3bafjw,wwhideanseek,0,Sat Jun 27 17:13:31 2015 UTC,The CWness of the show bleeds out sometimes
The100,3b2wyw,nomeras,28,Thu Jun 25 15:12:41 2015 UTC,"Orphan Black is a must; it is full of mystery. Honestly one of the greatest shows. Tatiana Maslany is amazing in it; she plays so many different characters so well that you will forget that its the same actress! The walking dead also hits the criteria of action, mystery, and drama. I would also recommend Agent Carter because that was a great show as well as Daredevil; they both have fantastic action scenes (more so Daredevil than Agent Carter but the carter series is a more feel good show). Izombie is also a great choice."
The100,3b2wyw,BlueOberries,6,Thu Jun 25 16:25:10 2015 UTC,Orphan Black definitely. It's really intense and quite funny too.
The100,3b2wyw,chaostree,6,Thu Jun 25 16:37:51 2015 UTC,Second this. Amazing show with INSANELY GOOD acting
The100,3b2wyw,queenbellevue,3,Thu Jun 25 17:04:12 2015 UTC,Another vote for Orphan Black here. Such an incredible show. Phenomenal acting!

The100,3b2wyw,BlueOberries,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:00:20 2015 UTC,"Pretty much... except for Izombie. Orphan Black is the best show I've ever seen! I only started watching it because my professor works on the show and is friends with the director and writers, but I got hooked. And then the walking dead is amazing, especially with the spin off coming soon... and then agent carter was excellent. So glad it's getting a season 2. The only other shows I love are Korra and Game of Thrones."
The100,3b2wyw,Z3ldamaster,12,Fri Jun 26 14:29:36 2015 UTC,If you don't mind that it is not life action but cartoon then I suggest Avatar the Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra. Both are fantastic adventure and drama shows with amazing characters and an amazing world. The first season of Avatar is a bit more childish than the other seasons but all are great.

They should also spill the beans on the Mountain's inhabitants, everything they know. We need to be prepared in case they retaliate for any deaths Elena caused.  The overall goal, IMO, should be to steadily build our relationship with the Grounders. If we share a common enemy, we need the Grounders' knowledge. And we don't know it yet, but Grounders don't use guns. So we'd be valuable to them.  I think if I were caught for anything on the Ark, it'd be stealing food.

Doesn't seem as if there's anything that can be done right now so let's just take a minute to chill with /u/ElenaOcean. Well actually...you guys chill. I'll keep watch in The Nest.  However, ""taking care"" of this enemy should be high on our priorities list. Even if we don't kill them, we need to at least ensure further conflict is avoided. Though a mountain base like that has some really valuable resources that we could put to good use. And as much as I want to march up, kill, and loot the place, we still need a way past the defences."

I think we should send scouts out in small groups to try gather information, we should also contact the grounders to see if they know anything, oh and reinforce defences just in case they come again  Also   We decided to send a search party consisting of 5 of our best people to get u/ElenaOcean back. The team that went after her in the end were /u/wwhideanseek, /u/Jay013, /u/ShaneH7646   That's 3 people"

The100,3aj827,FrostlyGrim,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:05:27 2015 UTC,The only reason he lived was because of time constraints. He was going to die in a 1v1 with bellamy.   I don't really expect him to die because being the sole survivor of your people on a finale is pretty big deal. Even if it was unintended. Also /u/tobylevins is a cool guy and I want him to stick around.

Like, okay, she's badass, and LGBT representation, and yadda yadda, but her character is completely unsympathetic in my eyes. As a foil to Clarke? Sure, I get it, closing off your emotions, etc, but people calling for her to come back in season three? Especially after she got Finn killed, tortured Raven, twist Clarke into believing emotions are evil, would've killed Octavia, turned her back on the revenge oath, and left both her supposed squeeze and all the Ark people to die? No. GTFO. Don't come back.  I much rather have kept Anya. Just make her interested in women, and have had Clarke start up something there, and tada, an interesting leader lady foil for Clarke with whom we've already had an adventure, and with whom there were already tentative friendships and alliances being built up and all the LGBT rep is still there.. Just... no Lexa, please..."
The100,3aj827,KeladryofMindelan,8,Sat Jun 20 20:19:25 2015 UTC,"Finn killed 18 innocent people. Think about it this way, if a grounder came in and massacred The 100, do you think they would just let it go? Those kids hung Murphy for killing ONE of their own. Finn killed 18 unarmed kids and elders. She didn't get Finn killed, he got himself killed.  Lexa thought Raven was trying to poison her and her people. It wasn't just an assumption, they found the poison on her. Indra and the rest of the grounders wanted to kill every Sky Person there. It was Lexa who said it was only to be Raven. As soon as Raven was proven to be innocent, Lexa stopped the torture. Lexa isn't any more ruthless than the rest of the grounders. Let's not forget how Bellamy and crew sent a raiding party to capture Lincoln and then tortured him with whips and electric currents. The Ark floated people for dumb things like stealing bread or medicine. Even Abby realizes there's not much different between them (She says, ""We're not all that different, are we?"" after Gustus' death.).   I can't deny Lexa was trying to change Clarke. However, I think it's obvious Clarke changed her view on things (""I was wrong about you, Clarke.""). To be fair, I think some of it was just an attempt to suppress what she felt for Clarke. The last time she fell in love with someone, it got them killed. She's what? 17? I believe Jason said she was a few years younger than Clarke in his Periscope. She's definitely not completely unsympathetic, look at her during the whole Gustus situation (He even tells her to be strong). Hell, even when she's talking about Costia you can see that she's hurt. She obviously cares about Clarke.  I think it's hard to us to see things from the Grounder point of view because we're so attached to the Sky People and their story. However, the fact of the matter is that their lives don't matter anymore than the Grounder's lives do. Lexa's warriors had lives and probably families of their own and she was given the option to not risk any of their lives. Not only did none of her warriors die, but she rescued her people from Mount Weather as well. Lexa had no idea what was behind those doors. They could've had huge machine guns or worse. Why would she risk thousands on the lives of 47? If you add in Raven and Abby and Kane and them, maybe 80 tops? It would be dumb for her to not take the deal, despite her breaking the alliance.  I believe Anya left because the actress was doing other things? I do miss her though."
The100,3aj827,mady16,7,Sun Jun 21 23:31:19 2015 UTC,"This was spot on everything I wanted to say, I think Lexa is an amazing character and hope to see more of her next season. I also loved how they portrayed a character turning their back on a potential love interest and betraying them for the sake of their people and leadership. A+ storytelling"
The100,3aj827,alifrah,8,Mon Jun 22 22:29:35 2015 UTC,"I think People who hate on Lexa only see the show through Sky people point of view, yes Lexa made decisions that harm their favorite characters, so of course they will hate her for it.  But the whole show is about how Clarke would have done the same, because when you are at war and in charge of your people, you just have to make decisions. ""Who we are and who we need to be to survive are two very different things"", remember. Lexa doesn't do it because she is evil, she does it because she has no choice.   Anyway, maybe if you actually reverse the situation you can see it: imagine a grounder walk into Camp Jaha and kill 18 innocent Sky people (including elders and children, and even one of our favorite delinquent) for no real reason, then just walk away freely like nothing happened. What would Clarke or the chancellor do? Do you really think they would they would just accept an alliance without looking for justice to the families of those who have been killed first? Would you do this? Of course not. All Lexa did was asking for justice as a condition to the alliance, like any leader would have done, and Finn happened to be the one being guilty. So if anyone is hating Lexa for seeking justice for her people, which is a normal thing to do, it's because they are being biased.  Imagine Clarke being offer the deal from Mount Weather after they struggled to open the door and lost many soldier in doing so, Emerson comes to her offering a truce and saying she can have all her people back (Bellamy, Jasper, Monty, Miller, Fox... even Raven who has been captured) free and alive, safe, and go back to camp Jaha with all her soldiers. All she has to do is to walk away from Mount Weather after that. She would be able to guaranty everyone safety and save everyone, which was always her goal. And also prevent any more sky people death. Would she really turn the deal down? Do you think she would say no and risk Bellamy or Raven, or any sky people life just to remain loyal to an alliance, which, by the way, was made in order to save them? Ultimately, Clarke cares more about Bellamy or Raven than any grounder. Like Lexa cares more about her people than any sky people.  My point is Lexa is a selfless leader that would do anything for the good of her people, exactly like Clarke, or Abby, or Kane. Just because we are attached to Sky people instead of grounders, doesn't mean we can't shift our point of view, and ultimately sympathize with her. Inside, she is someone who cares a lot. She may sacrifice herself for Clarke because she cares for her (like when the gorilla grabbed her, she quickly told Clarke to save herself and leave her, and even got mad when Clarke risked her life to save hers instead), but she would never sacrifice her people."
The100,3aj827,Shakeityou,5,Mon Jun 22 08:58:53 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, I would have really liked to see where Anya could have developed. Honestly I don't care at all about Lexa, something about her just realy bugs me, I can't put my fonger on it but just something annoying."
The100,3aj827,JustG00se,2,Sat Jun 20 22:14:22 2015 UTC,"And she's written as such a boring role, too. ADC is a great actress with so much energy but this role reduces her to the same blank expression all the time, it's painful to watch!"
The100,3aj827,xuniap,6,Sun Jun 21 02:25:49 2015 UTC,I like lexa becuase she dis most of those things. I don't have a problem  with Finn but he had it coming. I don't remember her torturing raven.   I like Clark being unsympathetic. That's what Clark needs to be to be a great leader. You don't survive by trying to please everyone. Also lexa is one of my favorite characters becuase I can relate to her. I wouldn't waste my peoples lives just becuase of an oath. Especially when I already got my people back.
The100,3aj827,PolarStHudson,3,Sat Jun 20 23:40:53 2015 UTC,"See, I don't think Clarke needs to be unsympathetic.  For me, the whole reason for setting up Lexa as her foil was to highlight that both of them have different leadership styles, with both being acceptable.   At the end of the day, Clarke got shit done. She doesn't have to be Lexa, close off her emotions (which, lbr, didn't really work that well for her either). It's okay to depend on other people, to feel burdened by your actions, but it's also okay to be ruthless and make sure your people are save whatever the cost. So no, I think the way Clarke is leading fits best for who she is as a character, she just needs to come to terms with what has to be done and accept that sometimes, there's no other choice."

The100,3aj827,wwhideanseek,4,Sun Jun 21 11:19:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I can't really be mad at Lexa for tying up Raven and demanding to have Finn. It's the Grounder's way. What I can be mad about is her disregard of it when the Mountain Men were concerned. Blood Must Have Blood, after all. Yes, she most likely prevented casualties, and it was probably the smartest choice, but you don't betray your allies. Ever. Especially considering that the only reason she got that far was because of the Arkers."

I also absolutely hate Finn. He represents so much teen drama whenever on screen.  A character I'm rooting for but a lot of fans dislike would be Emerson.
The100,3aj827,Dikeleos,15,Sat Jun 20 22:13:37 2015 UTC,I hated Finn from the start. Though I think that was his face.

If she truly loved her, she would've let her be who she was and care for people.  I agree with above comments. I liked Anya much better because she was gritty, interesting, and kind of an anti-hero that you thought might have feelings. She was very interesting and I hated that she died.  Overall, I liked most characters. Tbh, I don't really like Jaha. He seems like such a ""nice"" guy but he's actually pretty cut-throat."
The100,3aj827,justoneplz,10,Sat Jun 20 21:11:10 2015 UTC,"Finn. Oh god, Finn.   His moral righteousness was annoying as hell, particularly when compared to how his character handled his supposed 'love' for Clarke and the Raven situation. I never bought it as anything deeper than teenage infatuation, the flashbacks with Raven only made me feel that his character, was if anything, more disingenuous and I never felt he had any sort of chemistry with either girl. I was pretty glad when he died and liked that it was sort of the beginning of Clarke's downward spiral, other than that the only thing I liked about him was the fact that he acted as a foil for Bellamy in the early-mid season 1.  Also, I don't hate her but I just 'meh' Lexa.   Edit: Spelling."

It's funny that Monty and Jasper are supposed to be equals but I really do love Monty I feel like they did a lot more for and a way better job with Montys character given his limited screentime then they did with Jaspers who I think got a lot more.

I feel like he's just there for comedic relief and I didn't care too much for his love interest storyline with Maya even though I really liked Maya's character. Plus, he ruined the peace talks at the bridge when he started shooting at the grounders.   I'm also interested to see Bellamy's storyline for S3. He started out as a complete asshole who was on a power trip in S1. They redeemed him a bit with S2 with his Mount Weather mission, but it will be interesting to see how he acts and what role/position he's given at Camp Jaha."

The100,3aj827,ShaneH7646,2,Sun Jun 21 14:00:35 2015 UTC,"In Season 1, I literally hated Clarke. She was sort of stuck in this one dimensional idea mode, but as Season 2 started she began to explore her values and really developed into a more deep, well-rounded character my thoughts have changed.  In general, I really don't like Octavia. Yes, I get it in that she has transformed so much from who she was when she first touched the ground to who she is today. However, all that ever happens that makes her dynamic is that Lincoln goes missing and he is about the only true catalyst for change within her character. What happens to her if Lincoln dies? She is a warrior who happens to be related to Bellamy."

The only reason she did change was due to Lincoln being in trouble one way or another. Don't get me wrong I do like them together, they have good chemistry when it does happen.. I just wish perhaps her changing was cause of her and she had to do it for her own personal reasons not cause she fell in love with a Grounder dude and has to save his ass 24/7."

And this might be hypocritical, but I get annoyed with how obsessed some parts of the fandom are with her.   Not that you shouldn't like her, she's a fascinating character and I love trying to decipher her actions, but I hate how some people treat her like she's the most important character on the show and reduce the others to just peripheral characters. Just look at JR, he always answers so many Lexa questions and then basically ignores anything, like, concerning Raven and how she has been handled. Or basically anyone else on the show.   Idk, I guess what I'm trying to say (without sounding too much like a dick) is that I think Lexa's overrated. She is not a main character and I wish people would stop acting like she is."

But it's always Lexa this, and Lexa that. I can't be that mad at her fans, but there are so many that only care about her and act like other characters don't matter. It is just frustrating for me. I know some people got into the show because of her, and I can't fault them for wanting to know more, but I hate hate hate how some mains are neglected.  Edit: Just look at some people on Twitter who get annoyed that ADC doesn't attend the Comic-Con panel. It's absurd. She is not a main. She might be important for you, but she's not. I don't go around complaining that Miller or Wick aren't being promoted because I know they aren't main characters. Monty should be promoted. Monty should get his own story line. And it makes me sad that such a large part of the fandom doesn't care."

The100,3agyd4,tomaytotomahto_,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:12:53 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting concept but I think Jason Rothenberg was just trying to show the world from another angle. That instead of the Skypeople thinking the Grounders were monstrous, the Grounders thinking the Skypeople were.   Lincoln was basically explaining the innocent young child story, the one where kids see no differences between people and treat them all the same. I think Jason wrote in Lincoln's story to show that there are good people and bad people in every situation. Good Skypeople, bad Skypeople, good Grounders, bad Grounders, and etc.   Plus it was just another reason for all of us to like Lincoln even more. Although him secretly being a Skyperson would be cool, I don't think Jason would do that to show that perhaps, people of different cultures can bond, and Lincoln is an example of that."
The100,3agyd4,decafcosmiclatte,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:22:49 2015 UTC,Monty and jasper are white?
The100,3agyd4,KomTrikru,-1,Tue Jun 23 00:52:53 2015 UTC,Grounders are monsters is racist...
The100,3agyd4,KomTrikru,2,Sat Jun 20 08:59:47 2015 UTC,"Actually it isn't. They literally wear skulls, like masks. That is fucking creepy and can be seen as monstrous."
The100,3agyd4,wwhideanseek,-2,Sat Jun 20 10:21:09 2015 UTC,So native Americans are monsters too?
The100,3agyd4,KomTrikru,3,Sat Jun 20 10:27:08 2015 UTC,"Wait, I wasn't trying to be racist here. This is a theory post, and a very tinfoily one at that. It just seems weird to fight about racism here.  Also, I said ""seems monstrous"" and not monsters. Now, my English ain't perfect, as I'm not from America, but I believe that all people can be monstrous some times, but they are not monsters. And the grounders I've saw so far are pretty monstrous most the times, allowing people to be baits, torture before killing, attacking people that aren't doing anything to them etc."
The100,3agyd4,KomTrikru,-4,Sat Jun 20 11:21:43 2015 UTC,I think the word you're looking for Is either tribal or primitive not monstrous. I was just pointing out wearing animal hides is not a bad thing. I mean you wear leather belts right?
The100,3agyd4,wwhideanseek,5,Sat Jun 20 14:24:41 2015 UTC,Tribal and primitive are both waaayyy more insulting.
The100,3agyd4,KomTrikru,-2,Sat Jun 20 14:36:50 2015 UTC,I can see pimitive being insulting but tribal? They literally live in tribes/clans. It's accurate.
The100,3agyd4,wwhideanseek,2,Sat Jun 20 14:38:39 2015 UTC,"Geez. NO. I said that when you come from a space ship and see these guys they can seem monstrous. I did not call them monsters. Sadly what people dont understand is always what they are afraid of.  Now, the Arkers handled it better than the british settlers (and others), because they actuallly tried peace. I did not say nor implicate that Grounders (or Native Americans) are monsters"
The100,3agyd4,KomTrikru,-2,Sat Jun 20 10:35:54 2015 UTC,Again I just think monstrous is the wrong word. Primitive seems what you were going for. No offense.
The100,3agyd4,alifrah,2,Sat Jun 20 14:32:35 2015 UTC,On that note though it does beg the question why are grounders almost all non-white (poc) or non-white passing and if not are always wearing dark makeup/paint to make them seem darker skinned? The only 'white' Grounder I noticed was Nyko and that was only because the actor who plays him was in Supernatural otherwise the darker makeup and paint would have be thinking he wasn't. Whereas most of the Skypeople are clearly white eg. clarke finn octavia jasper clarkes mom kane murphy
The100,3aeluj,Amonette2012,8,Fri Jun 19 14:22:43 2015 UTC,"I'm actually cool with it. The later slot allows for more time to make it good, and 13 episodes means it will stay action packed and not get drawn out. Sure I'd like more episodes, but season two didn't need them, and another season as unputdownable as the last one will make for a more solid show that's more likely to see a season 4."
The100,3aeluj,decafcosmiclatte,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:19:12 2015 UTC,"Filming still goes ahead in July, so the extra time will go into post-production stuff. I agree though that S2 had some wandering moments. I was so used to the pace of S1 that I got really frustrated with the MM storyline being drawn out to the end, and I'm still a little miffed that the kids spent barely any time together."
The100,3aeluj,idksomuch,4,Fri Jun 19 15:33:28 2015 UTC,"I think the CW is trying something with the 100. Since the 100 has more of a social media fanbase/Netflix viewers rather than actual sit down viewers, they're going to wait to release Season 3 and put up Season 2 on Netflix in the upcoming months. That way, Netflix viewers can catch up on the 100 and get addicted to it. And when the 100 has like a bajillion Netflix viewers, they're gonna release Season 3 so they get a ton of people to watch it live.  Like pulling a ""Breaking Bad"" or whatever"
The100,3aeluj,mororon,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:47:22 2015 UTC,There was an article somewhere few months back where the show director/producer/person said the 100 having less episodes per season than the typical cw show is what they're trying to do for now because they saw the success of breaking bad and how it's shorter seasons meant less drawn out storyline. Im all for the shorter seasons as long as the show continues to be awesome.
The100,3aeluj,jacobfreeman000,3,Thu Jun 25 09:00:56 2015 UTC,"I've said it before and I'll say it again: I'm not particularly concerned.  Airing season 3 mid-season means that there will be fewer pauses for holidays, allowing the show to keep up momentum. It also means season 2 will be up on Netflix longer before season 3 airs.  The 13 episode order doesn't bother me either. Season 1 had 13 episodes and season 2 had 16. While 13 is a cut, it isn't as if the order was cut from 26 to 13. As much as I'd love to get 16 episodes, this probably isn't going to make a significant impact on the series, except to make the writing a little tighter."
The100,3aeluj,jacobfreeman000,3,Fri Jun 19 15:46:45 2015 UTC,"I think 13 episodes is perfect. Season 1 was excellent with that many, and in season 2 there were episodes that could have been left out.. They felt like... Can't think of the word. Extra fluff? Also I do like hugs"

The100,3aeluj,Tristaneto,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:58:11 2015 UTC,"I think the shorter 13 episodes is actually better, season 1 was great with that many, though season 2 was also great I think it did have a couple off filler episodes that could have been cut    you just need a hug   How do I claim?"

The100,3aeluj,Nerazeal,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:41:46 2015 UTC,After seeing that ending of Season 2 I am really curious as to what will happen to the show. I don't really know in what direction things will be headed as I found the finals minutes of Season 2 really vague. I just don't hope it's gonna be all about T.J. and that thing.
The100,3aelsi,duelmastersaustralia,7,Fri Jun 19 14:22:17 2015 UTC,Katia Stano has a bunch of behind the scenes stuff on her twitter. She's the costume designer for the show so it's a good place to start.   e: I think you can tweet her too if you have questions.
The100,3aelsi,ElenaOcean,3,Fri Jun 19 16:36:34 2015 UTC,"I would start off with some kind of long coat, either leather or some padded material like Clarke wears, and embelish that. Fur is an obvious choice for collars, and you could probably make some shoulderplates out of an old tire.   Some kind of gloves could be made from spraypainted wire mesh wired over black wristwraps. You'll need a kickass pair of boots too.  Also they wear a lot of chainmail, you could try using a knit fabric to replicate that.   Lots of accessories - gnarly belts, thigh holsters, shredded leather, chains... a trip to your local scrapyard might give you some good things to work with."
The100,3aelsi,Amonette2012,2,Fri Jun 19 15:25:20 2015 UTC,In addition to what others have said try and basically look like a over the top grunge punk rocker basically. They wear studs you wear spikes. Oh you probably know this but sew with tooth floss as thread. It's more durable and looks authentic  (because it actually is)

The100,3a6720,Amonette2012,13,Fri Jun 19 15:25:50 2015 UTC,I'm 100% down.  I'd rather have higher quality with a tight story. Season 2 was great but sometimes I felt off at times when the Grounders/Sky people alliance got rocky again and again...
The100,3a6720,Adjective_,6,Wed Jun 17 15:44:58 2015 UTC,"What? Come on. Season 2, all around, was an improvement. 3 more episodes had no effect on the wat plotlines worked out."
The100,3a6720,Shotokanguy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:18:59 2015 UTC,"They did kind of spin the wheels the last couple episodes of season 2, dragging out the Mt Weather siege when there was no real reason to. 13 worked great season 1, no reason it can't work again."
The100,3a6720,geekspiral,9,Mon Jun 29 14:10:45 2015 UTC,Oh boy... They're really trying to put a positive spin on this. Yes 13 episodes means no filler. But so would 16 high quality episodes. And they have more than enough time to make 16 episodes..  Ugh last season was too good to be true. It was too perfect.
The100,3a6720,manicmelancholic,6,Wed Jun 17 20:15:00 2015 UTC,"it doesn't feel like their faith is in it, the last two announcements have felt like Jason just putting on a brave face. At this point I wish Netflix would adopt the show instead, they'd be appreciated a lot more there than by the CW."
The100,3a6720,ElenaOcean,5,Wed Jun 17 20:18:32 2015 UTC,"You've just echoed my dreams for the show. It going on to netflix would be wonderful seeing as most people I know who watch The 100 found out about it through netflix. I have Never met someone who found out about it through CW and that says a lot about CWs ability to advertise this show. I really do blame CW for the lack of attention The 100 is getting. Every time Jason puts on a brave face as you say, a little part of me dies knowing his show deserves more than this."
The100,3a6720,manicmelancholic,3,Thu Jun 18 02:46:38 2015 UTC,That one person really wants a Bellamy and Murphy hug.

The100,3a6720,jpkx72,3,Thu Jun 18 14:17:25 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, here's the full episode order for CW. Make of that what you will.   Fall 2015  Arrow - 23 episodes Crazy Ex-Girlfriend - 13 episodes The Flash - 23 episodes iZombie - 13 episodes The Originals - 22 episodes Supernatural - 23 episodes The Vampire Diaries - 22 episodes       Mid-Season 2016  The 100 - 13 episodes Containment - 13 episodes DC's Legends of Tomorrow - 16 episodes"
The100,3a6720,ElenaOcean,4,Thu Jun 18 00:05:09 2015 UTC,"That reminds me I told Dorkside I would mod Containment, but it seems they changed the name. It was Cordon iirc. I still am really bitter that a show called Crazy Ex Girlfriend has a fall slot and our beloved The 100 is mid-season. Heartbroken, actually."
The100,3a6720,Kishara,3,Thu Jun 18 00:22:15 2015 UTC,"I've seen the trailer for Crazy Ex...actually I only watched half of it because I just couldn't go through with the whole thing. It got rejected by another network and for some insane reason CW scooped it up. Unless she murders her ex halfway through the pilot and it devolves into a roller coaster ride into the mind of a psychotic woman who keeps her ex's body in her apartment and sings to it, I think it will get cancelled.   It just doesn't fit with the rest of the CW demographic. I'm heartbroken too, especially considering the shitty reviews some of the CW cash cows have gotten. I know Jason's right and all they really care about is the money, but you'd think someone there would give a shit about quality too."
The100,3a6720,ElenaOcean,2,Thu Jun 18 00:34:35 2015 UTC,"Agree! The way it happened with the early renewal and then dropping that shitbomb on us after the finale was devastating. I am guessing part of the reason was the split loyalties many of us exhibited to other CW shows. Knowing The 100 was not stable made many people refuse to support competing CW shows while we waited out the word for renewal.   So I kinda feel we got suckered a bit by the midseason slot. Jason was too, he thought when the renewal went thru we were gtg for fall. I remember that article and I think it was Shane that found it. Bloody hell. I wish that this show would be on a standalone network without all of the advertising and demo concerns. NETFLIX: Talking to you boys here."
The100,3a6720,Kishara,2,Thu Jun 18 00:40:27 2015 UTC,"ikr? I wish they'd just hand it over to netflix. It's like watching someone incompetent raise a child, but they don't know how to care for it so they just leave it in the corner while they let the teenagers throw house parties and vomit all over everything. It needs a sci-fi audience who will appreciate it and not be put off by CWs rep.   And CW needs to make up its mind about who it's audience is. It's no use choosing superhero shows if you're going to piss off 1/2 the fanbase. You can't take advantage of people's loyalty like that."
The100,3a6720,ElenaOcean,2,Thu Jun 18 00:54:48 2015 UTC,"I just love the way you write stuff like this. You have the best style ever when it comes to describing things and always make me laugh. I do feel so conned by the CW right now. I have no use for JTV, none at all for the masked boy shows and despise the idea that they put something so amazing with such potential for longevity in a hole in their backyard. I am sure other shows fans feel their shows deserve the slot more than any other.   It is probably not a unique experience to believe YOUR show is the most deserving. I  watch several CW shows, but I would trade anytime anywhere for The 100 if I was forced to a decision. We have the most incredibly nice fan base, a show that blows the critics minds, and a cast/crew that honestly care about what they are doing. It's a perfect storm of ungodly perfection. The only piece missing is network support. Sadly, we can't have it all it seems.   Aww well, at least we all have each other to comfort and soothe the pain while we wait for this hellatius to be over. Oh and I am going to mod True Detective for reddit for this season. Forgot to tell you what with Shane getting all hosed up and all. Stop over there if you are watching this season. Last year was really good and the community exploded. Should be a good time this year on TD."

The100,3a6720,ElenaOcean,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:59:47 2015 UTC,"On the whole no. It was a disappointing season.  But a lot of that was comparing it to the previous 2 seasons, especially S2 which was amazing. Yes, the writing was poorer this season, and a lot of the story was a blatant Batman rip-off but the fact they managed what they did and threw in some of the best episodes of the show despite DC up and claiming characters from them, and Flash appropriating the budget, and staff (writers/stuntmen) is pretty impressive."

The100,3a6720,PacoTaco321,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:39:09 2015 UTC,It doesn't help that Grey's Anatomy has had 11 seasons with a good chunk of the cast leaving or dying off.
The100,3a6720,n1ghtcheese,2,Wed Jun 17 21:01:57 2015 UTC,It's better with fewer episodes. And the wait aren't that long. All good cable shows have around one year between the seasons.
The100,3a6720,takename,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:07:23 2015 UTC,Also keep in mind season 2 came four months after season 1's finale.  There's always hope there can be a season 4 for Fall 2016 as well.  (notice how iZombie premiered mid-season 2015 and gets a Fall 2015 slot - four months)

The100,3a6lzf,AdrienI,3,Wed Jun 17 17:10:46 2015 UTC,"""They were willing to fight and die for you.""  Don't worry Clarke, it will be the same for you soon."
The100,3a6lzf,ElenaOcean,4,Wed Jun 17 17:36:21 2015 UTC,I'm really curious how the kids' opinion of her is going to change now that she's left. Are they still going to hold her on this pedestal or are they going to feel abandoned and be angry at her?
The100,3a6lzf,Nekyia,3,Wed Jun 17 17:43:36 2015 UTC,"I'm going to use a spoiler tag because I'm unsure of how much I can say here without getting slapped by a mod.  I think people will have mixed reactions with her leaving. Those that didn't really like her, but went along and later found that she was in fact a good leader, will support her. Those that don't know her, will think that she's turned her back on them. Those that already like her, will obviously support her.  If you want a specific list, I think these are the people who still like/support her: Bellamy, her mother Abigail, Monty.  Those that are somewhat neutral: Lexa, Lincoln, Raven.  Those that may hate her: Octavia, Jasper  Obviously this is just me speculating. So, with in regards of your question there may be a little anger towards her leaving. However, we won't know the full extent of their feelings until the next season. The ark people and the grounders are in some neutral truce at the moment. If that changes, which side will Clarke choose? At the moment, it's obviously the Ark people right? Right? ... we'll see. It depends on how far Clarkes and Lexa's relationship developes. Also we got to see what happens with Bellamy."
The100,3a6lzf,ElenaOcean,2,Wed Jun 17 19:03:45 2015 UTC,"without getting slapped by a mod.   That is my favorite pastime. But as Elena said, you are in a thread that warns about the future spoilers so you are safe...for now :P"

But this post has already been labelled spoilers so it's all good.   Are they still in a truce? What Lexa did was a massive betrayal, they broke their deal, sided with the enemy and left Clarke and the Arkers to die. So peace is up in the air at this point but I doubt Clarke would ever choose the grounders over her own people, that goes against everything she's fought for for two seasons.  I suppose the real question is whether or not the new Clarke is going to care what the others think."
The100,3a6lzf,KomTrikru,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:29:29 2015 UTC,"I just hope she doesn't break. I just hope she keeps making the right decision instead of the weak one (As Lexa has mentioned). She has so far been making the right ones, at least in my opinion."

The100,3a6lzf,mar33n,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:19:12 2015 UTC,"Season 1 and 2's wars ended the same way. Clarke pulling the lever and sending 300 of her enemies into a burning death. That said, I really hope Season 3 goes for the trifecta and ends the season's conflicts with Clarke and a lever.  Also, Murphy seems to end up alone and injured. Alone with a stab woubd and previous injuries next that tree Tristan left him at in S1. Alone with a bite wound and previous injuries at the lighthouse in S2. Again. Trifecta please?  Who else? Oh. Clarke and Bellamy separared at the end of the Season.   There's Raven with injuries, but it's a moot point by now since the show loves to torture our little bird.   Any other similarities/parallels with S1 abd S2 finales?"
The100,3a6lzf,Shotokanguy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:25:35 2015 UTC,"In the S1 finale, Clarke tells Bellamy he did good, come S2 finale, Kane tells Bellamy the same. They're both characters with whom Bell butted serious heads with in the beginning of the season but have come to appreciate him."
The100,3a4aid,OkPlayerHater,39,Wed Jun 17 02:59:06 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, I never really like him much. For me, he seemed to represent the ""teen"" drama show feel that Season 1 sort of had. It almost feels like his death is sort of symbolic of the show going in a darker (arguably better) direction."
The100,3a4aid,sharkbait359,5,Wed Jun 17 03:23:45 2015 UTC,"You know what? Now that you mention that, I think you're pretty spot on.  If you take him out of the show entirely, you lose a large chunk of the cliche teen CW drama feel."
The100,3a4aid,unlimitednachos,17,Thu Jun 25 19:34:41 2015 UTC,"I think my problem with it is showing this love as something good and beautiful or something to aspire to (""I found you"").   I actually don't think the show is portraying it in that way. You're supposed to realize that Finn's rationality is absurd, and the ""I found you"" is creepy as hell and in no way romantic. And with the flashbacks, it shows you that when Finn falls in love with someone, he goes all out ""trying to save them"". It shows us why Raven owes Finn, but it also shows like you said, how little Finn thinks about his actions.   The most romantic part of of any of it is when Clarke puts Finn out of his misery. It's like Romeo and Juliet, except Juliet is smart enough to know only one of them has to die. Or you know...it's like Of Mice and Men. She kills him to set them both free of his ""love""."
The100,3a4aid,ElenaOcean,9,Wed Jun 17 09:43:29 2015 UTC,I agree his character became really irrelevant after the love triangle sorted itself out
The100,3a4aid,stewshi,8,Wed Jun 17 03:05:50 2015 UTC,"i never liked finn, i love bellamy tho"
The100,3a4aid,Tiiimon,7,Wed Jun 17 06:56:27 2015 UTC,"Sometimes, in war, people break. Yes, Finn is seventeen, he's the emotional type. He was also the one calling for peace from the very beginning.   Clarke's disappearance was the straw that broke the camel's back. Clarke, after doing what she (and Bellamy) did at the end of S2 said, ""I tried to be the good guy"".  Finn tried as well, and he failed in the most spectacular way. When he realises what he's done and what this means, he owns up to the mistake and offers himself up to the Grounders.   Nobody of the 100 is blameless, everybody has blood on their hands. (Even sweet Octavia is a killing machine)  And with the circumstances as they are, frankly it's a goddamn miracle that not more people flip out like Finn did. This is what happens in war.  I liked Finn a lot, he was one of my favourites. I'm not saying his mercykill wasn't deserved, but it did break my heart, also for Clarke."
The100,3a4aid,Lannielief,3,Wed Jun 17 16:52:16 2015 UTC,"I didn't hate Finn, I found him a flat character and I couldn't see a ""spark"" from him like the other characters have. He didn't stand out like Bellamy, Clarke or even Wells did. The actor was kinda boring too. The only time I found hin interesting was when he was about to die. It was like his acting ability finally turned on. Which was a horrible time to start lol.  All that being said though, I wouldn't have minded seeing a sort of redemption arc after killing the Grounders and see how the Arkers reacted to him in the aftermath. Would Clarke have forgiven him? How would have Kane and Abby dealt with the repercussions of having a murderer at Camp Jaha?"
The100,3a4aid,FrostlyGrim,7,Wed Jun 17 07:28:19 2015 UTC,"He didn't just murder the grounder because of Clarke. It's because he was at the end of his rope. Clarke being missing was just the straw that broke the camel's back.   He was right about the girl in the ravine and he was right about the grounder. He was just done pretending that there was a better way. And the scene at TONDC was clearly about PTSD.   The flashbacks with Raven weren't about Finn at all. They were about Raven more than they were about him-- but they were also to make his death hurt more-- we weren't supposed to go ""awww"" about the space walk but about the nobility of him accepting responsibility and saving Raven from being floated."
The100,3a4aid,toychristopher,17,Wed Jun 17 03:54:06 2015 UTC,"None of this is really a comment on the way Raven would have felt and why she wanted to save his life at all costs... Because in that situation you're right. He saved her life. She wanted to save him.   But Finn never had perspective. His whole relationship with Clarke came from his over active teenage emotions. Everyone else was at the end of their ropes too. Everyone. Most of these others had been captured and tortured. They all lost friends and homies. The difference between Finn and the rest of them was, he was in love with Clarke and he didn't care what he had to do to get her back. He said as much afterwards. ""I love you. I did all this for you and you can't even look at me!?' The whole situation in the village was brought about because he didn't know how to be without Clarke. He made a series of choices that led to a massacre he alone committed. Not a group of people. Him alone. Everyone saw it. Tried to warn him. Tell him. He didn't care. He wanted Clarke back.   He wasn't right about the girl in the ravine. He may have been right about the grounder, but the cold bloodedness of the execution (that surprised even Murphy who agreed with him) shows he was out of touch. The flashbacks also showed he would do anything for the woman he loved, even at the cost of everyone else's happiness and safety. A totally unhealthy way to live your life.   From the first episode he was the most obviously emotionally volatile teenage boy. His death is the fitting culmination of that."
The100,3a4aid,corinthian_llama,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:17:01 2015 UTC,"Well, saving the girl in the ravine cost another life. It could have cost more lives. So, looking at it in survival terms, it was a mistake."
The100,3a4aid,Jay013,2,Thu Jun 18 20:00:01 2015 UTC,"I keep seeing people attribute his actions to PTSD... But that's not Finn's issue.    Just to add clarity to this point, keep in mind, the Grounder War was only a few days ago for them. All Grounders are still bad guys at this point. They killed his friends. It makes that he'd treat them like an enemy and not as a person. He's still under the psychological effects of that war. Again, you make valid points, but the war did have a major factor in dictating his choices."
The100,3a4aid,wwhideanseek,7,Wed Jun 17 09:09:04 2015 UTC,"Nah, I don't think so. He was the guy that wanted peace. He didn't see them as   Enemy, must kill   For him it was all about Clarke."
The100,3a4aid,DealWithItBish,2,Wed Jun 17 10:42:38 2015 UTC,"Also it was a village with women, children, and elderly folks. Even if the grounders were his enemy at that point, a normal person would differentiate between ""enemy warrior"" and ""enemy's weaker groups""."
The100,3a4aid,Shotokanguy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:52:20 2015 UTC,"Several of them charged right at him. He was scared after shooting the first man just on reaction, then Artegas came at him. Then they all started running. He probably did stop seeing them as different people, he just felt like he was in danger at that point."
The100,3a4aid,DealWithItBish,3,Thu Jun 18 22:58:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, They charged him after he shot one of them. If he shot the first person purely on reaction, he shouldn't have been trusted with a gun."
The100,3a4aid,Shotokanguy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:16:01 2015 UTC,"Don't try to argue this, I'm not defending him. But he had a gun on them, told them not to move, and someone bolted. He didn't know where that old man was going, and he didn't take the time to look at him and go ""Oh, that's an old man. I should just let him go.""  It's an understandable reaction for a kid in that situation is all I'm saying."
The100,3a4aid,DealWithItBish,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:27:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to argue. I just don't think it's a normal reaction, seeing as Finn had the gun and therefore the upper hand so the man running should not have instantly made him start shooting."

The100,39teja,yyy4401,3,Sun Jun 14 18:06:06 2015 UTC,Orphan Black is an amazing show and the main character Sarah has a lot growth in terms of making the 'right' decision and the effect that will have on her family.   A book that you might like is the Uglies series. Dystopian w/ female protagonist.
The100,39teja,justoneplz,2,Tue Jun 16 03:22:32 2015 UTC,The thing about the uglies is it get repetitive really quicky. It's the same plot in all the books with nice side plots.
The100,39teja,yyy4401,6,Tue Jun 16 03:24:25 2015 UTC,I use to read these books when I was younger so they're more aimed towards maybe preteens (but they're still so good). Its called the warriors series and its about cats... A house cat joins a group of wild cats and has to adapt to how they handle things.

The100,39teja,mady16,3,Sun Jun 14 22:46:36 2015 UTC,"The Walking Dead (graphic novel). Hesitant to post this at first since you asked for books but this the show and the graphic novel have differentiated significantly enough. People have been comparing Walking Dead and The 100 in a few posts.   Rick, and a few other characters, start off as fairly moral characters but their journey places them with difficult decisions.   Hunger Games is also similar.   Also I started reading Sheltered, a graphic novel set in a snowy PRE-apocalyptic shelter. It's very similar to The 100 / Lord of the Flies. Semi-spoilers (it is revealed in the first chapter):  A group of their children kill all the adults of the base camp to preserve future resources. This leads to a Bellamy/Clarke kind of interaction between two characters. I recommend it."
The100,39teja,Amonette2012,3,Sun Jun 14 21:01:25 2015 UTC,"I would recommend The Darkest Minds by Alexandra Bracken. I don't want to spoil anything, but the main character, Ruby, reminds me a lot of Clarke."

Not sure you'll find exactly what you're looking for, but all these books are recommended by fans of the show.  The series I'd suggest for you (and lucky you, it's 7 books with a sequel series of 3) is the Tomorrow When The War Began series by John Marsden. The main protagonist, Ellie Linton, is very much like Clarke in terms of strength, ruthlessness and ability to make sound decisions under fire. Of course she doesn't start out that way, so her progression and that of her band of friends, a group of teenagers who went camping one Christmas holiday and came back to find their country invaded, is pretty good."

Including apocalypses. I watched The 100 as an ""educational program.""  How? The 100 is one of the most original stories I've seen in a while. I got reeled in with each and every episode. Then Raven came along and swoon. Of course when Season 2 came along and Lexa was introduced faint  In all seriousness though I found it on Netflix and thought ""Cool, another apocalypse"" granted I was skeptical, hoping it wouldn't suck. The story and the characters were simply amazing. And there you go."
The100,39otdg,Jay013,2,Sat Jun 13 09:10:38 2015 UTC,"When? When The 100 first came out on Netflix.   I think a lot of people found it the same way, if not for netflix I would probably have found out months later when the ads came on in the uk"

The100,39otdg,piratepowell,4,Thu Jun 18 05:23:41 2015 UTC,"When: It was early February 2015. I binged watched it within 2 days because it was so addicting. Why: I just started it because I was bored and wanted something new to watch. I didn't really watch shows similar to The 100 before, but The 100 got me into similar survival type shows like The Walking Dead and Lost. How: I was actually on another TV show's subreddit (Pretty Little Liars) and the post said how they liked the continuity of the pale bodies in the cave with the Reapers in season 1, and how it's explained in season 2, and asked if PLL had any memorable continuity too. I decided to check out the show out because the poster said it was a really good.   I remember when the first episode of The 100 premiered on TV, I tried to watch the first episode but thought it was so boring!! I was so wrong, because this show is one of my favorites now. I've rewatched both seasons at least 3 times already!!"
The100,39otdg,Haruberry,3,Sat Jun 13 11:27:06 2015 UTC,"It was like 2 or 3 months ago. I was on Tumblr and I saw gifs of Octavia and Lexa looking fierce and Raven looking hurt for the 1000000th time and I just had to try watching again. Then I binged on Netflix in three days during midterms I think it was because it was that amazing. Needless to say, I regret nothing."
The100,39otdg,bellaflecking,3,Sat Jun 13 15:28:17 2015 UTC,"Weeeeeed   Normally I'm one of those snooty adults who don't watch shows with teen stars. But I love sci fi, and I love netflix and one fateful day after the 5th episode of the first season aired I discovered The 100. The first couple episodes I was thinking ""eh I can keep watching if I smoke weed"" and but after that I discovered the show is amazing even if I'm not high. I watched all five episodes that day and never stopped looking forward to new episodes.   Man I'm thankful for weed. If I hadn't been high that day I could have really missed out on this not-so-teen drama."

I watched the first 2 episodes and thought it was so horribly bad I had to show it to my roommates so we watched it and made fun of it. I had some free time over the part of the summer the first half of the first season was on and didn't have any other shows I was currently watching, so I just was watching them as they came out and fell in love by episode 5 or 6!"
The100,39otdg,uncatalyzed,2,Sat Jun 13 13:41:15 2015 UTC,"Right after Bodyguard of Lies aired. I'd been hearing about for ages and how it was 'just like LOST', but had just been putting off starting it because I was busy with school. Saw a gif of Lexa from the post-'Not everyone, not you' scene on my friend's Tumblr and knew that this had to be a badass show. Started it shortly after that on netflix and then online."

The100,39otdg,Shotokanguy,2,Sat Jun 13 19:10:37 2015 UTC,"I got into The 100 last November when I was sitting around browsing Netflix. I originally thought it was going to be like a he-said/she-said teen drama, which I don't normally watch at all. I decided it would be interesting to see how the romantic drama might unfold in such a situation and thought it was going to be campy and entertaining for that reason. Quickly, I found out that it was not that at all, and focuses more on the content and creating this world and this awesome apocalyptic/survivor tale, which I'm so into. This was a pleasant surprise for sure!"
The100,39otdg,AndieYanqui,2,Sat Jun 13 22:05:15 2015 UTC,I watched it from the start and watched each episode of season 1 when it aired. Then season 2 I watched the first 3 episodes but got busy and stopped watching. Over spring break I decided to catch up and completely binged the rest of season 2 in a day
The100,39otdg,purplepowerpete,2,Sun Jun 14 04:52:07 2015 UTC,Saw some people on /r/netflix recommended it so i decided to give it a shot. I'm so happy I did. I kinda wish I didn't watch it yet though so I wouldn't have to wait so long until the next season haha.
The100,39otdg,Ge0Po,2,Sun Jun 14 16:34:32 2015 UTC,"When? A couple days before it came out. Why/How? I was browsing the other shows on survivorsucks after one of the seasons, and it mentioned that the 100 is coming out soon, I decided to watch it."

After watching LOST again on Netflix I wanted to put something ""unimportant"" on to snooze to.... Then jasper got speared and I had to watch more."

A few hours later I checked it out on my own and fell in love."
The100,39otdg,nitrouspillow,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:53:22 2015 UTC,Some random person I used to message on reddit about TV shows told me about it. Chained the first season in a couple of days. I've always loved post apocalyptic fiction so it was an 'oh yuss' moment.
The100,39otdg,Amonette2012,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:41:12 2015 UTC,"About 2 months ago I watched the pilot while looking for a new sci fi show to watch, thought it was cool but something came up and didn't have the time to watch any more. Then about 2 weeks ago I came across the blu ray while at the shops and just got it cause I knew I would watch it eventually. Then I binge-watched every episode over 8 days including season 2. So keen for season 3. Also happy I can now visit this sub, had to avoid all things about the show until I caught up as any picture can be a spoiler."

Was doing like 3 episodes a night, really enjoyed it.  I'm actually pretty sad I need to wait for season 3 now.  I'm a huge fan of the Walking Dead and I'd much rather have S3 The 100 come first.

The100,39nlf2,ironkrylon,3,Sat Jun 13 01:02:35 2015 UTC,Yeah...I'm just going to go ahead and assume Octavia and Lincoln become the Ark's main Scouts (cause Lincoln was a scout before The 100 showed up) and that they found bikes to ride in post apocalyptic Earth.

The100,39ls8s,mororon,8,Fri Jun 12 20:09:51 2015 UTC,"With Clarke gone, a lot more people in Camp Jaha are going to be looking up to Bellamy. It'll be interesting to see how he reacts to the pressure. One possibility is that he puts on the sassy Bellamy swagger to as he pretends to have everything under control. As much as I love woobie Bellamy, I would like to see him be sassy for a bit."
The100,39ls8s,mororon,7,Sat Jun 13 00:40:19 2015 UTC,I hope you're right! If the kids are all back together he has to appear as the leader he was before and take on Clarke's responsibility too. Maybe Clarke will be reluctant to come back and it'll fire up some of that old tension between them and the sass will return.
The100,39ls8s,bellaflecking,5,Sat Jun 13 00:53:32 2015 UTC,Believe me: possibly nobody wants tension alternating with camaraderie between Clarke and Bellamy more than me.

It comes down to Murphy v jaha for the fate of everyone left on earth.  Jaha thinks he's saving humanity and dies by Murphy's hand, who is actually saving humanity.   Clarke wanders the woods for a while, pretty out of it.  Possibly suffering from PTSD like Finn.   Bellamy is the hero of camp jaha and is treated like it, I'd hate to say he gets a swollen ego but it's a possibility.   Jasper is all kinds of fucked up.  Monty is butthurt that jasper is mad at him.   Raven and kyle wick are gettin it on.   Honestly I'm mostly interested in Murphy's story rn."

Maybe it's even a reference to the woman in red from the Matrix? And there's also the Alice in Wonderland references which makes me wonder if driving people to madness is something that Alie does. If Alie's been watching and surveying with drones from the beginning, she probably knows exactly how to push people's buttons and pit them against each other. Maybe she even manipulated the bunker guy into killing himself so that she could be free?   I think you're right that it'll come down to Murphy vs. Jaha.

The100,39ls8s,Dafneenfad,6,Sat Jun 13 01:02:01 2015 UTC,"BACKSTORY! Tell us what the 100 got arrested for! Tell us what the Trigeda achieved. Flashbacks for both sides! Granted it'll be a clip show full of flashbacks but I wouldn't mind. Every so often a show will feature it's minor characters. This can be one of those moments. Why did Harper get arrested? What kind of party did Jasper and Monty throw to get caught? What happened between the Millers? What was Lexa like when she had Costia? As well as Sinclair and Jackson, the two most under-appreciated characters on the show do so much and we barely see them. They need more screen time.  Also, Lexa development. Which is really iffy seeing as ADC is over on Fear the Walking Dead. But seeing as we're mid-season, who knows. She may show up for an episode or two now that there's more filming time for the show."

The100,39ls8s,PolarStHudson,4,Sat Jun 13 23:06:44 2015 UTC,I just want to see Lexa be a badass and redeem her self.
The100,39ls8s,Shotokanguy,6,Sat Jun 13 22:56:50 2015 UTC,"Clarke is in pain. She is deeply affected by the things she has done, and she didn't want to be in a place that reminded her of some of it, or expose her friends and family to it.  The only way to move forward is to heal. But you can't just heal from mass murder with a few days of hiking. Clarke has to find something that she feels will atone for her decisions. I don't know what that could be, but I hope part of her outlook going forward is to avoid killing as much as possible. If it affects her like this, she can't keep doing it. Find another way. Save as many lives as possible. I think this would be an extremely interesting character trait. Imagine how great it would be to see Clarke put in a situation like the Mount Weather again, and instead of taking the easy choice, she finds a way to save everyone. As long as it's done well, that would be an even better story than one that ends with a character taking one of two options."
The100,39ls8s,PolarStHudson,5,Fri Jun 12 18:13:10 2015 UTC,"I really want to see Clarke take a break most of this season from being the ""hero"". Let Bellamy take that role. I agree with you that she's done way too much to come out the other side of it the same Clarke we've known since the pilot.   I think the interesting thing, for me at least, is that even if she finds a way to cope, when she comes back she will still have to face everyone. So I think once she's had a taste of freedom and chance to breathe and be a little more selfish with herself, she'll find it incredibly hard to come back home again."
The100,39ls8s,alifrah,2,Fri Jun 12 18:51:05 2015 UTC,"This, absolutely. I would like her to resolutely avoid being placed in any sort of 'leader' or 'hero' position tbh, basically just so everyone who gave her shit can suck it and feel what it's like when there is no Clarke coming to save the day."
The100,39ls8s,PolarStHudson,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:34:42 2015 UTC,Clark didn't take the easy way out. She did what she had to for her people. She had no ther choice. Only a true leader can make decisions like that for their people.
The100,39ls8s,mororon,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:53:08 2015 UTC,"It's not meant as a judgment of her character, but it was the easy way. The hard way would have been finding a way to save everyone. She decided there was no way to do that."
The100,39ls8s,mororon,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:12:36 2015 UTC,We could argue the point that there were other ways but I don't think we could ever call genocide the easy way out.
The100,39ls8s,Amonette2012,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:57:08 2015 UTC,killing is the easy way out. Saving everyone is the harder way. You don't get what you want - you kill them. You don't get what you want - you strategize a way to get what you want with the least amount of casualties. I think she got used to that way of life that at that moment she was just too tired to bother anymore.
The100,39ls8s,Amonette2012,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:59:19 2015 UTC,In this insatnce killing those people was the safest option. It wasn't easy for Clark to make that choice.....I understand why you would think that killing them was the easy way out but I don't think it was. You just can't save everyone.

I was sad to say goodbye to a great actor, then again for a TV show that doesn't mess around killing off key characters I shouldn't be suprised but there's not a lot of shows on TV that use this formula, Game of Thrones being one of them."
The100,39iu4c,patismyname,15,Fri Jun 12 02:56:54 2015 UTC,"Knowing he pays for it in the end (and accepted the punishment) should dispel any hate. He was a tragic character. There's something incredibly sad about dying that young, in a world that messed up. He could've been part of bringing the human race back, and instead he's just another ghost."
The100,39iu4c,Shotokanguy,16,Fri Jun 12 05:23:12 2015 UTC,"it's so tragically ironic that he was adamantly against guns in the beginning for exactly this reason. And then in the end his life didn't even bring peace. Totally agree with you, his whole story is really sad."
The100,39iu4c,ElenaOcean,5,Fri Jun 12 12:39:11 2015 UTC,I think a lot of people missed this. Finn is a tragic character and he was meant to be pitied. I think he's one of the most interesting characters on the show.

The100,39iu4c,trippymane9,5,Fri Jun 12 01:20:29 2015 UTC,Well not if the man with the gun is bat shit crazy...  You would run if you don't want to die.
The100,39iu4c,wwhideanseek,7,Fri Jun 12 06:24:48 2015 UTC,Think of it like this: if he truly was batshit crazy and was looking to murder them he would have unleashed the whole clip into them while they were corraled. He wasn't slaughtering them initially because he wanted answers which they couldn't provide. I would assume Fin would have backed off once Murphy got through to him that the answers aren't here. Clarke & friends appeared not even a minute after he started shooting. Had the grounders stayed put they'd probably all be alive.
The100,39iu4c,trippymane9,4,Fri Jun 12 17:13:52 2015 UTC,"Murphy tried to get through to him. Before they entered the village, when they were setting a fire, when they rounded them up, when they found the clothes and when he started shooting. He was batshit crazy (or at least had some severe form of  PTSD). If the only thing that stops you from slaughtering 18 people is whether 1 guy stays put or tries to flee, you have a problem."
The100,39iu4c,wwhideanseek,2,Fri Jun 12 17:21:42 2015 UTC,You could argue literally every sky person has PTSD from everything they've been through. I'm not arguing wether Finn was being rational or not because we all know the answer there. I'm questioning the decision making of the grounders whilst under pressure. They should have listened to Nyko and stayed put.
The100,39iu4c,trippymane9,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:41:11 2015 UTC,They have all been through some bad stuff but most of them kept it together.  But they couldn't know that Clarke was only minutes away. In the state Finn was he could have just as well killed them all while they were sitting there.
The100,39iu4c,wwhideanseek,2,Fri Jun 12 17:59:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I believe he was past the point of thinking rationally. He couldn't see past them being a threat, which is why he couldn't accept that that man was just trying to run away."
The100,39iu4c,bellaflecking,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:06:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's always been my thought. IIRC the first guy even runs towards him."
The100,39iu4c,Matt19826,4,Fri Jun 12 12:03:13 2015 UTC,I think the first guy is an old man and tries to flee. The second guy is the young guy (forgot his name) and he runs toward him.
The100,39iu4c,wwhideanseek,3,Fri Jun 12 12:32:30 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean. I wasn't sad to see him go. And yeah, he turned himself in. But only because Clarke got hurt and his whole point was to protect her. The same way he slaughtered that village for her, and the same way he eventually killed people on the Ark by wasting 3 months of oxygen for Raven. ""The things we do to survive don't define us."" Well, Finn wasn't trying to survive."
The100,39iu4c,bellaflecking,-2,Fri Jun 12 19:53:03 2015 UTC,"To be fair, they were at war and they were the enemy"

The100,39ioyt,uancmb,8,Fri Jun 12 00:04:23 2015 UTC,"Well Jason Rothenberg once said that the AI Jaha meets is actually the city of light. I'm guessing she lures people in to help her find items for her weapons in exchange for the safety she can offer. I think if this is the case it's very like Emori was working for ""The City of Light"" since her and her brother only wanted the sky people's /technology/. It makes sense for the physically deformed grounders to help the AI out since it's either that or spend their lives in hiding anyway."

Because that was the vibe I was getting from the video that Murphy was watching of the guy... 'she got the codes etc etc.'
The100,39ioyt,alifrah,2,Mon Jun 22 22:14:53 2015 UTC,I believe so and I am pretty sure that's what happened. She is an AI that probably finds herself superior to humans and possibly wants to eradicate them from Earth.
The100,39ioyt,alifrah,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:18:00 2015 UTC,I think possibly that she might have been an AI that got corrupted and that the man in the video lost control of similar to that of Ultron from the Avengers... that in some sick twisted way eradicating the humans would be 'saving' the world in her mind.. or something lol

The100,399daf,willowmaid,5,Wed Jun 10 04:59:13 2015 UTC,"I'd like to believe that The 100 will try to escape once the blood harvest starts. Clarke's a snoopy girl, it's apparent even before she landed on the ground (as shown in a flashback). She and/or Bellamy and Finn will find the blood chamber soon enough.   I want to say they'll help the Grounders and the alliance will form that way. They try to escape with a Grounder (instead of an inside-man it'll be an outside girl while those who are left behind try to take down the Mountain from within), meet the Commander, and we end up back where we were, planning to get everyone out of Mt. Weather.  Down side? No Raven. I mean there probably will be a Raven but she'll probably get killed on her own on the Ground with Mt. Weather watching the skies.   As for the Ark Bracelets, odds are Mt. Weather will take those off.  Edit: seeing as you're new, please read the sidebar. Almost nobody ever does and a lot of questions get repeated. The book question is constant proof of that."
The100,399daf,Jay013,2,Wed Jun 10 07:49:33 2015 UTC,"Downside? Meh... ;)  One thing to be considered though is that without weeks of experience on the ground, the outside would probably be scarier to them... So if those who escape don't immediately meet friendly Grounders it would be a gamble whether they survive or not."
The100,399daf,wwhideanseek,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:37:47 2015 UTC,"Ooh good point, Raven would be tricky. I wonder if the grounders would attack her though? Seeing as the reason the 100 got attacked was the flares burning that village down. She might make it if the grounders got to her first."
The100,399daf,Amonette2012,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:05:38 2015 UTC,"It's interesting to note that some of the strongest characters - Clarke, Finn, Bellamy, Octavia, Murphy - were never captured. I definitely think things would have gone differently. There would have been twice as many of them, making them a bigger force to be reckoned with.   Also, it's likely that if the mountain men were already thinking 'well they survive outside and so do grounders, maybe their blood works too', they would not have let them radio the ark and they probably would have removed their bracelets. So the people on the ark might have died, or they might have all come down together.   If the rest of the ark people did decide to just go for it and land, they would also have headed to mount weather - in larger numbers, and they may well have thought it deserted and just forced the doors.  Also if they landed in mountain territory it's likely that the first grounders they meet will be the ones in the cells, and if they can form an alliance and get them all out then it's likely they'll have a better start with the rest of the grounders. This is assuming they overcome the mountain men, which I think  they have a chance of doing, especially if their parents show up."

The100,397ozf,wwhideanseek,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:37:29 2015 UTC,"Why does everybody keep assuming that the Grounders would lose against the arkers?

The100,397ozf,wwhideanseek,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:50:53 2015 UTC,"It's not really about the Arkers at all, the Grounders could wipe each other out if they don't change their attitude.

Simpler, character driven plotlines just based around the idea of them trying to start a new life on this world will be interesting enough. Conflicts can arise organically, from things like the Sky People and Grounders trying to salvage things from Mount Weather, or searching for other pieces of the Ark."
The100,397ozf,Jay013,2,Wed Jun 10 00:41:17 2015 UTC,"Me too. The bit of cultural diffusion last season was pretty interesting, it would be nice to see more of that. There's still so much we don't know about the ground and the Grounders, and that's a threat in itself, there's no need for a immediate season big bad. I remember when Bellamy was telling Clarke there's no time for politics while their friends are in trouble and with them being in war, but now that it's over, why not. And are there any more Ark survivors? That would be awesome to see. I don't know, there just definitely need to be some nice moments where the 100 can interact again. Even if it is short lived."

I liked their subtlety in the beginning of season 1, they were that seasons big mystery. Then, I liked how we got to see how organized and civil they actually were in season 2. Please let's just have one season without them. I really like the Grounders, probably one of my favorite reveals on a TV show ever, but I don't want The 100 to become ""the Grounder show"".

I believe they also recite it before they send the ark to the ground (?). Kane recited it to his mother because she asked him to say it at the ceremony and he said he didn't remember it. I suppose he felt bad, so he recited it to her in her dying moments. Her 'religious' group is about returning to the earth and the followers of this religion all donate part of their daily water to keep the tree alive. Here is some great info on the Traveler's Blessing, written by one of the shows writer's (I know theis sub doesn't usually allow Tumblr posts, but as this is from a writer i figured it would be okay.)   I enjoy your theory about a connection between the tree and the Tree People. Very interesting. As for Lexa, I have no idea how she knew the phrase. Maybe she overheard it?

I don't want to sound like some pretentious book snob, but, frankly, they're badly written, poorly paced, unrealistic, and just make you wonder why the author made it into some Bellarke fanfiction instead of making it like the show. I ended up barely reading the second half of the first book because it was so unenjoyable to me. The characters I loved on the show weren't at all likeable to me in the books. It's romance, not dystopian. Like I said, think above-average Bellarke fanfiction."
The100,398mxn,mady16,0,Wed Jun 10 21:24:37 2015 UTC,Yes at least I think so. It isn't very much like the  series and once you get over that you'll love it
The100,398mxn,tozarr,5,Wed Jun 10 04:34:41 2015 UTC,"BOOK SPOILERS TO FOLLOW My problem with the books is that they are glacially paced, don't resolve themselves, drop meaningless details like they are crazy revelations, and are inconsistent about things that require a minimum of common sense to call bullshit on.  ""Was your mother's name... Miranda?""  ""Oh my god how did you know?""  Well, first of all, we live on a space station of two thousand people, we've literally lived there our entire lives. It's not a stretch that someone else might know your mother's name.  I know people with more facebook friends than that.  And from a storytelling point of view, why even reveal that they're half brothers?  Informing us that Octavia and Bellamy are siblings gives us insight into their characters:  They genuinely care about each other in ways that no one else in The 100 can, and it drives them to exceptional lengths to protect each other.  The Octavia storyline.  Octavia gets captured by Earthborn, they agonize over it, looking for her is one of the main plotlines of one of the books, and she's just given back by deus ex machina at the end.  The relationships.  Oh god, the relationships.  In 45 days(approx), Bellamy and Clarke have gotten together, broken up because he did something unforgivable, gotten back together, broken up because he did something unforgivable, gotten back together, and now everything is fine and they're going to be together forever?  The fact that it's a trilogy:  This series should never have been a trilogy.  I spent two full books frustrated that they weren't resolving anything.  It felt like nothing actually happened until the third book, and even then the resolutions weren't particularly satisfying."

There's Lincoln and Delano, which are obvious references to presidents. Tomac and Costia probably refer to the Potomac and Anacostia rivers. It is a reach, but I suspect that Lexa is named for Alexandria, VA. There's lots of little things like that which hint at the location."

The100,392jv0,starmapleleaf,16,Mon Jun 8 20:06:21 2015 UTC,"There's a theory around that Kane might be the father of one of them. There were some shenanigans on Twitter between a few of the actors possibly hinting at it. I'm on mobile, so I don't have links or screenshots, but hopefully someone will oblige."
The100,392jv0,mororon,9,Mon Jun 8 20:49:53 2015 UTC,I could see this for Octavia but not Bellamy. It's hard to imagine Kane would stay out of his son's life like that.   If he was Octavia's dad and he didn't know their mom was pregnant and that Octavia existed and was his... it would make sense to me.
The100,392jv0,mororon,8,Mon Jun 8 21:26:04 2015 UTC,"No screencaps, but here's a thread referencing the tweets.  It is more logical that Octavia is his daughter, but there would be compelling plot reasons to instead make Bellamy his son. There are ways to get around Kane not being involved with Bellamy in the narrative, particularly since Aurora Blake engaged in the world's oldest profession."
The100,392jv0,mar33n,8,Mon Jun 8 22:02:09 2015 UTC,WOW. This is definitely plausible then...   Was Aurora a prostitute? I thought she just did sexual favors to hide Octavia... but had some other job.  Everyone in the thread is concerned about it would mean for Bellarke lol
The100,392jv0,theincrediblekrizz,9,Mon Jun 8 23:34:44 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty certain Aurora was a seamstress and, like you said, started sleeping with dudes for 'favors' after O was born.  And hey, Bellarke is serious business, haha."
The100,392jv0,whoiskatherine,8,Tue Jun 9 02:34:03 2015 UTC,"funny story, prostitutes often used to declare their professions as""seamstress"" on census' back in the day."
The100,392jv0,Jay013,3,Tue Jun 9 03:35:07 2015 UTC,"Omg...If Kane is her father...This would make so much sense to me. Because I've noticed this vibe between them but didn't know how to place it. I brought it up to a friend and she was like WTF are you talking about...But I knew something was there. Of course, none of that's even confirmed so...But I'll keep hoping."
The100,392jv0,ShaneH7646,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:32:38 2015 UTC,"I honestly hope not because at this point it would be a bit of a cop out in trying to start a new plot point. Plus there's not a single scene that even hints at this. To start doing so now would just be a stupid move.   Either way, the father would most likely be introduced in a flashback episode. Aka the backstory episodes. (His Sister's Keeper, Twilight's Last Gleaming, Spacewalker...)"
The100,392jv0,mar33n,4,Mon Jun 8 22:43:52 2015 UTC,"I feel that Kane's relationship to Abby is somewhat similar of Bellamy's to Clarke, but I'm not 100% convinced he's the father..."

The100,392jv0,Amonette2012,11,Mon Jun 8 23:29:31 2015 UTC,"They're most likely just random people from the Ark. I do think they have different dads, but JR has said he wouldn't make Kane related to either of them.  Also, they could have faked it, but in the pilot it said that Bellamy's father was deceased, so he was probably floated."
The100,392jv0,Shotokanguy,12,Tue Jun 9 02:32:32 2015 UTC,"Kane is definitely not the father of either Blake sibling. JR's told us so. Not to mention that Filipino descent is much different from Peruvian descent (Bob Morley and Henry Ian Cusik, respectively); it would be offensive to pretend otherwise."

The100,392jv0,oldmythologies,2,Thu Jun 11 05:00:49 2015 UTC,"I definitely think Kane is the father of at least one of them, more logically Octavia's. While it's obvious Aurora did 'favors' for guards, it's hard to believe they wouldn't have been suspicious if she was always asking for when the surprise inspections were. We don't know how often they were, but she hid Octavia for 16 years and it's hard to believe no one would have noticed her always asking about them. However, if Kane knew about Octavia, her being able to stay hidden for 16 years would make a lot of sense. Kane would know when inspections would be coming and such things like that since he was on the council.  However, they could just have random fathers. Maybe we'll find out in S3."

I'm going to have to check their pulses, heads for any skull injuries, and do a general exam for bruising that could be caused by internal bleeding, as well as any frostbite or other injuries that need looking at. It looks like they may have just passed out from exhaustion and dehydration, but there might be another underlying cause. I mean, we could even be looking at cholera here.  For the dehydration, we're going to have to wake them up because we don't have IVs or Ringer's Lactate here. We're going to need salt and sugar. Since we don't have either of those, we're using the broth which has salt in it from the meat that's been removed because if they eat right now, it's going to come back up. We're also going to use some of the berries to make a sweet juice to alternate with. We're going to need a couple of litres of both, start off slow, and then increasing fluids throughout the day. I'm going to need some people to stay here with them to make sure they drink the broth and juice while I go check out what the redshirts I sent off two weeks ago, who have just returned with some plant life. There might be something useful in their sacks."
The100,38x1kp,wwhideanseek,3,Mon Jun 8 02:55:55 2015 UTC,"Also in regards to the need for private time   First off, can I just say what a good job we've done; going 12 weeks without sleeping with each other? In the show this took less than 12 hours. Good job guys! xD  Anyway... puts on Captain hat  As Captain, I will be taking on anyone/everyone who wants to learn how to use a bow. I shouldn't have to stress the importance in this as it is useful in both combat and hunting. More than that, I want to form an elite team of archers. We will be acting as scouts and snipers simultaneously. That said, it'd be pointless to only leave a bow to defend yourself so skills with a knife or sword is necessary.  Speaking of, all forms of combat will be practiced in basic training. You will be trained to use a knife, a sword, a bow, a spear, and of course, your hands and feet. See /u/shotokanguy for the martial arts training.  As for watch towers and reinforcing the wall... Six watch towers built on the joints of a hexagonic wall. Take a look at the formation on the left (excuse my paint skills) eventually though I want to expand/upgrade the wall to the image on the right so that we can have walking patrols alongside watch guards. I say six because it allows us to cover all sides while working with our low manpower. Not only that but it'll be easier to get six working radios to be used within the towers.  As far as winter planning goes, those in archery training can incorporate hunting into their training. But yes we do need to stockpile on food and pelts. The log cabins are a must. We need to build enough to house everybody. These may not be casual living quarters for now, more like the dorm room in Mt. Weather. When  we don't have to worry about freezing through the night, then we can start building cabins for casual living. But for now we need to keep everyone sheltered. We can use materials we take from the wall as we upgrade it, as well as taking down the surrounding trees. We need a clear line of sight and materials anyway. We might also want to start stockpiling firewood."

The100,38x1kp,woupieta,2,Sun Jun 7 22:12:10 2015 UTC,I like the idea about the elite archers -eliarchers?-. Will come in handy.  Your plans for the camp are also pretty cool.  What is your opinion about the 'standing army debate'?  Edit: We will need a sh*tload of wood if we want to build this wall with the watchtowers...
The100,38x1kp,Jay013,2,Sun Jun 7 20:12:45 2015 UTC,"A good engineer on guard duty is wasted IF there's work to be done. But again, that's why we need to have the knowledge trade so that everyone has the knowledge for something we may need. Everyone pulls guard duty. It's how we stay alert and ready. Some people don't have that innate capability for combat, but training them to do so gives them that. Guard duty makes sure they maintain. The standing army can just be a set of people that can be called into duty at anytime, but can perform their regular jobs until then.  We will teach people engineering, we will teach people construction. With our so few numbers we need everyone to have the collective skill and knowledge, because if our one good engineer dies from, say, electrocution, well then we're shit out of luck aren't we? The same goes if those on guard duty are killed. If our chosen guards are killed, we don't have anyone defending camp.  Everyone learns everything. Everyone will be better at somethings than others. It's how we can keep the camp functioning with the small amount of people we have. And /u/Amonette2012 is right. Pairing experienced with the less experience creates a teacher/student pairing which will keep both individuals sharp on their skill set."
The100,38x1kp,woupieta,2,Sun Jun 7 20:20:14 2015 UTC,"Mhhm, fair point.  I think we should still have some designated soldiers. For example 3 people are in the standing army and they re the commanders of the guard. Also scouting jobs shouldn't be done by everyone, we can't have unexperienced redshirts stumbling around the woods..."
The100,38x1kp,Jay013,2,Sun Jun 7 20:30:16 2015 UTC,You mean us three war leaders? And most scouting will be done by those trained for it. The outside is dangerous.
The100,38x1kp,Shotokanguy,2,Sun Jun 7 20:38:28 2015 UTC,"No, I mean three of the best trained guards, they should be the only 'full-time' guards and therefore commanders of the guard."

It would be too hard, not to mention wasteful, to have EVERYONE doing it at once.  So, one day would be jabs and an appropriate block. I'd take maybe 30 people, have them figure it out and then practice with each other. Take another 30 people a while later in the day, and so on."

The100,38x1kp,wwhideanseek,3,Mon Jun 8 21:44:32 2015 UTC,"again, it theoretically doesn't matter if you have irl experience or not. I just get way to immersed in fictional scenario games."
The100,38x1kp,wwhideanseek,3,Mon Jun 8 23:06:39 2015 UTC,"I think we should build watchtowers into trees, they'll be better hidden and harder to knock down or set fire to. We need one next to the river, and since I already have a cave there, I can work and sleep out there until its done.  If we use radios to communicate between towers, we should come up with some kind of code, ya never know who's listening. But during the night we can use lanterns or beacons instead."
The100,38x1kp,wwhideanseek,2,Mon Jun 8 17:39:50 2015 UTC,"Sounds good, I like the idea of some treetop platforms. They can be reasonably simple and also act as potential hiding places."
The100,38x1kp,wwhideanseek,3,Tue Jun 9 23:46:00 2015 UTC,"Wow am I late to the party! Winter planning is one of my specialties!   We need to dig out a root cellar to store veggies and stuff. We probably won't can food as we lack supplies. But we can smoke and cure meats. That is going to be vital. Our fish traps can still run during the winter months, but we do need to hunt and store as much cured and aged meat as possible. We can also dehydrate foods, that is done very simply over a low heat that we can achieve by building a simple mud oven.   We will also have to make sure to put some fire boxes around our water supply to make sure it stays melted if the weather is really extreme.   Do we know what kind of winters we are going to be having here? I imagine that the climate may have been affected by the blasts. Any science officers around who can speculate?   We need  heat in all living quarters. That means we need our blacksmith making stoves/fireplaces as fast as possible. Stoves/fireplaces have to be vented to remove the risk of monoxide poisoning. It's really important they are safely made and installed. Once the snow comes, we can bank it up against the residences to add more layers of insulation from the cold.   We are going to need A LOT of wood.  We need to not clear cut around our camps as the trees provide a windbreak that will help keep us warm. So this means we need to go a ways away and haul in logs. We can utilize the horses to help haul the logs. The logs need time to dry out a bit before we use them, green wood is dreadful for heating. While we are at it, this is the time to bring in logs for building as well. Peeling and letting wood cure makes for more superior lumber as the sap will bleed out of it. Letting wood sit and age a winter will be the best way to be ready for next year.   It's time to think about clothing as well. We have very little and need to see if we can start making some or trading with the Grounders for some winter items."
The100,38x1kp,arihadne,2,Tue Jun 9 06:39:14 2015 UTC,I would make some cabins and chimneys to keep us warm. I would convince the leaders to start killing lots of animals to make warm clothes. Get some people to start getting water and putting it into areas where it will freeze and we can break the ice and melt it for fresh water. We should do the same with food. I would have a team making second walls inside. And lastly get someone to go and make peace with the grounders or make some signs to put in front of mount weathers cameras to make peace with them.
The100,38x1kp,Jay013,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:07:24 2015 UTC,"I think we'll probably be alright for water, for one thing we worked all that out a while back, and if it's cold there'll most likely be plenty of snow. Also melting ice is horribly fuel inefficient, better to have a hole maintained in our river channel.   I like the idea of a second wall. For one thing, if it's breached it makes a great trap and kill zone."
The100,38x1kp,arihadne,2,Sun Jun 7 16:20:39 2015 UTC,Thanks about the second wall trap thing
The100,38x1kp,Jay013,2,Sun Jun 7 18:21:08 2015 UTC,"If /u/Shotokanguy doesn't check in I'll go ask the Grounders for assistance in our search and take a team of trained redshirts into the woods to check where he went.  Regarding the 'army', I think it's clear that we need everyone if we deal with a giant grounder army but I think it would be good if we had a 'standing army' meaning, trained soldiers that take guard duty, go scouting, can ride, shoot and fight better than the others. 30 should probably  be enough for the moment. In case of an emergency situation these trained and disciplined soldiers will be a huge advantage. As for training, I propose that everybody goes through base training (shooting with bow and guns, fighting with swords and fists and riding) then we take the ones with the best results and put them into the army. We will then further train these 'best of the best' to make sure our standing army has top fighters. When they are trained they can of course also help building hunting and so on, but the main objective should be to have them as a all time combat ready force. (Btw thank for the honor o glorious Leader ;P )  Regarding the third and fourth point, we could combine watch towers and hunting shacks... Watch out for enemies and hunt animals.  The idea of a second wall is great, will make us feel safer and create a 'killzone' in case we are attacked."
The100,38x1kp,wwhideanseek,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:59:57 2015 UTC,"I'd have to disagree - everyone should be equally capable of doing this and no one should be exempt from things like guard duty. Obviously some will naturally be better than others, but the less good ones could be paired with more experienced and capable ones so that people at least keep their skills fresh and advancing. If there were 2,000 of us I'd agree with you, but I think with this small a number, daily familiarity with military type tasks will serve us all well in the long run."
The100,38x1kp,wwhideanseek,2,Sun Jun 7 17:20:04 2015 UTC,"The thing is that this means a good engineer, a good hunter or  a good builder will waste their talents on guard duty. The more people are working on fortifying/expanding/'bettering' our camp the better. One well trained guard equals two badly/fast trained guards, so if everyone does guard duty it is not only inefficient but also dangerous."
The100,38x1kp,Shotokanguy,2,Sun Jun 7 17:29:11 2015 UTC,"Since we now have a leader,one soldier should probably be /u/Amonette2012 's bodyguard.... Leaders need bodyguards."

Sure, but seeing as we didn't have war with the Grounders and no big alliance she also doesn't have the training and is probably not that good a fighter... So if I think about it no, you can have her in a few weeks after she is trained though..."

The100,38x1kp,ElenaOcean,2,Mon Jun 8 16:47:16 2015 UTC,"With winter planning, we're going to want to shore up the houses with as much insulation as we can. This means filling up all the cracks and holes with a mixture of mud and dried leaves, and then covered with the layers of lime plaster that's been being made in the background by redshirts since week 9.   I will be teaching people how to sew proper winter clothing. We're looking at leggings, funny-looking hats, and coats that would probably not be out of place for Mugatu's Derelicte line. May not be pretty, but they'll be warm. We'll want to waterproof everything we can. Man, if we could get some beavers, they would make great boots.  Back to the houses: we want basements, with floorboards to cover them up to hold food in. We're digging down into the earth to the clay and we're going to use that clay to make pottery so that we can store our winter food securely in the basement that's going to serve as our climb-in freezer.  runs over to help /u/Shotokanguy and the redshirt  And the two groups of redshirts I sent out two weeks ago have returned, somewhat victoriously, with one decent-sized olive tree, a couple of bags of olives, one bag of grape seeds (since it appears they ate most of them), another bag of red grapes. The other team apparently listened better, because they have returned with small seedlings kept in soil and wrapped in fabric of several medicinal plants from that section of the Botanical Garden. There was a lot of kudzu overgrowing things, but they managed to get some good things. They spent the nights up in the trees because there were wild dogs. Or at least what they hoped were wild dogs and not wolves. One of them got bitten, but they cauterized the wound so I'm going to have a look at it while making sure that out other returnees don't die. Guess I'm going to be in the medic tent/cabin/place for the next couple of days."
The100,38x1kp,wwhideanseek,2,Mon Jun 8 03:01:41 2015 UTC,"If we're springing for a basement we might want to get that done first and foremost as it'll take quite a bit of time and man power. Short term loss/long term gain, and we do have a bit of security as no one's attacking us. Odds are, whatever we build ontop of that basement will end up being a storehouse.   You wanna make clothes, you'll need pelts. Guess I'm going hunting this week. You should come with. Learn to use a bow and hunt. Get this knowledge trade going. Plus, we score some food. If not, oh well. We do need clothes so best get started on teaching. As for beavers, I can hunt, but I can't trap for shit. Best way to catch beavers is to use traps on them. But if I see one I'll be sure to tag it for you.   Speaking of medics...We seem to he gathering a lot of injuries lately. We'll need to start stockpiling on medicinal plans."
The100,38x1kp,ElenaOcean,2,Mon Jun 8 04:04:58 2015 UTC,"Which is why I made sure that they brought back medical plants. We can keep them inside during the winter in planters so that we can have year-round access. While in the medic tent, I'm going to work on making tinctures and sorting out bits for drying between checking on our comrades. I'm going to have to figure out some way to seal the lids on the clay pots being made and fired in the makeshift kiln so that they won't go off. It would be good if we had wax.  I can make snares, though. We've got the wires that got busted during landing and can strip the coating off of them. We'll need to get some wood to make them, too, and then get a few people to set as many as possible - we'll also need to talk to the Trikru about their own hunting grounds to make sure that we won't get into a big snafu over hunting in the wrong place. We'll also be using the bones of small animals to make needles out of."
The100,38x1kp,arihadne,2,Mon Jun 8 04:17:26 2015 UTC,I'll do my hunting near the bunkers. That way I can also look for some first aid supplies on my way home. No one seems to have brought back any. Because the last thig we need is an injury we can't treat in -20C climate.   The territory discussion I agree with. It'd be stupid if the allianve broke because we shot one of their deer.
The100,38x1kp,aajjjj,2,Mon Jun 8 04:31:04 2015 UTC,Any volunteers to go talk to the Grounders about hunting grounds?

The100,38rtzk,iAMA_Leb_AMA,25,Sat Jun 6 07:07:12 2015 UTC,"It's in the FAQ in the sidebar.   TL;DR: Radioresistant survivors gathered to form communities which eventually became tribes which evetually became the Clans. Non-radioresistant survivors had bunkers. Example: Mt. Weather, the supply bunker.   TL;DR2: Fallout 3"
The100,38rtzk,Jay013,6,Sat Jun 6 09:11:43 2015 UTC,Tbh I think only the most well-engineered bunkers would have resulted in people like the mountain men. Small makeshift ones like Finn found in S1 probably resulted in lots of dead people due to either radiation leak or just lack of supplies.
The100,38rtzk,LifeFailure,8,Sat Jun 6 09:52:54 2015 UTC,So yeah. Vaults. Exactly. puts on pip-boy  Only self-sustaining vaults bunkers would last 100 years without failure while holding a large population. But it's not hard to belive Mt. Weather is the only one.   IRL the Cheyenne bunker is built for a situation like this.  Time is also a factor. As is reproduction. Which is why a self sustaining bunker is the only real choice.
The100,38rtzk,Jay013,2,Sat Jun 6 10:02:35 2015 UTC,"I haven't played much fallout, but I was under the impression that all vaults were built to be self sustaining/foolproof and then tampered with to facilitate social/biological experiments. I know some allowed radiation leak to see how it would affect people, but that was because the door was tampered with, not because the bunker was built improperly, right?"
The100,38rtzk,LifeFailure,2,Sat Jun 6 10:09:04 2015 UTC,"yep in fallout vaulttech never actually thought that the bombs would actually fall so they designed most of the vaults to be social experiments like the one with 1,000 men and one woman or 1,000 women and one man or one man and one sock puppet or every year thinking they have to sacrifice one member of the vault or everyone will die"
The100,38rtzk,thelizardkin,19,Sat Jun 6 18:25:17 2015 UTC,I think Dante explained somewhere early season 2 it's natural selection.
The100,38rtzk,jorisimo11,20,Sat Jun 6 07:38:00 2015 UTC,"You would have to believe that the chances of a nuclear apocalypse flat out killing every single person living on Earth are pretty low. Many places wouldn't be hit by a bomb, and even in places that were, there would be survivors. Likely not many, but it wouldn't take many to eventually create what the Grounders have."
The100,38rtzk,Shotokanguy,11,Sat Jun 6 07:57:59 2015 UTC,Plus shelters. We've seen three bunkers so far. For all we know we could have a Fallout situation. Vaults. Vaults everywhere.
The100,38rtzk,Jay013,6,Sat Jun 6 09:08:59 2015 UTC,"First of all the 100 isnt scientific accurate: -radiation isnt killing you like in the series presented -and you cant just filter radiation out of the blood. The worsed part of radiation gamma radiation changes the moleculat structure of the body parts its hits, like changing the dna or destroying proteins, which then destroy the cell -as raven spacewalked with finn, she got zero gravity after the air pressure got down. Conplete bullshit because on the iss they all are floating in 1 bar of air.  In fact nuear bombs arent as radioactive as nuclear powet plants. There were suvivors in nagasaki and hiroshima. Most of them got cancers and even 3 generations after that there are peole born with 2 heads or with the organs outside of their body.  But today the radiation in nagasaki is so small that people live there.  So of those people who survived natural selection went its way."
The100,38rtzk,superliro,3,Sat Jun 6 11:49:58 2015 UTC,"To add on. Mutations accululate overtime with a kind of snowball effect. So as we age, we get more mutations. Mutations cause irregular cells which cause cancer.  The same would happen with the grounders except probably faster with such a high level of radiation.   Perhaps  this is why we don't see many elder Grounders. Maybe a lot pass around age 50."
The100,38rtzk,starmapleleaf,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:55:20 2015 UTC,"I think they explained this in Season 2. I dont remember the exact episodes but mostly Dante from Mt Weather and other characters speak about their survival.  Mountain Men - Mostly believed or theorized to be Senators or white house senior staff and military personnel that gathered and went under ground at Mount Weather to survive once the nuclear bombs began to fall. Which explains why they dont have a council like the Ark and have a president and guards and society like schooling , teaching and community based mess halls. Since they lived under ground for 97 or so years they probably still have the same body systems and genes as the original population of earth before the nuclear apocalypse.   Grounders - It seems that some humans were resistant to radiation and some gave birth to phreaky babies that had extra hands/claws and what not like that scavenger boy Jaha meets or that girl who robs him in the desert. So these radiation resistant humans start reproducing and by the process of natural selection, all their off springs or the current grounders end up being immune to radiation and thus survive on ground for 100 years. Those that have mutations are banished like they showed in season 2 thus preventing ""staining"" their pure blood which is radiation immune. This only made them stronger on the earth s ground.  Arkers - As mentioned Arkers are exposed to the sun's radiation or radiation in space or something , which was explained in season 2 and exactly like grounders they too breed and produce a super gene of humans that are radiation immune so they are not effected by earth s radiation either."

Then you have to take in account for unexpected asteroids and external damage. This thing is probably like a rock.

The100,38obug,Shotokanguy,2,Fri Jun 5 14:49:51 2015 UTC,"I think that's the natural path this story is taking. It's not just about the 100 delinquents anymore, it's about the survival of the human race. Peace between the two groups is the only way that can really happen.   I guess they could surprise us. The show has done it many times before. Maybe the Arkers will have the tech to wipe them out at some point. I think it's safe to say the Grounders won't wipe out the Sky People, since so many of our main characters are them. Imagine how crazy that would be, if the show suddenly became about the Grounders after they massacred everyone?  Maybe they simply will never reconcile, and the Sky People will find a new home somewhere farther away. That would be a pretty sad ending to Clarke and Lexa's relationship, if they simply couldn't get past their differences. Depending on how that relationship develops, it might even be bittersweet and beautiful.  But I do think, regardless of their cultural differences and their past, we'll be watching regular Grounder/Sky People interactions a few seasons from now. They'll be living together, fighting the same enemies, and stop looking at each other as different, strange people. They'll just see each other as people."
The100,38obug,Jay013,2,Sat Jun 6 02:21:56 2015 UTC,"Depends on the level really. As a whole with the grounders, ie. the 12 Clans, no. There are too many variables to consider right now, and the Coalition is shaky enough already. With the Woods Clan, maybe. Lexa's betrayal will put them on rocky ground. Some still have a hatred for Sky People, especially those who lost loved ones in the assault on the dropship. With the Trikru of Tondc? Yes. Hear me out.  We don't need to talk about Finn since we all know that story, instead, look at the missile strike. The Ark came immediately to support the injured trikru at Tondc. Not only that, they had taken some of the injured back to Ark camp for treatment. One of the caravans was raided by the Mountain Men, again you know this. Then came Lexa's betrayal. As leader of the Coalition, Lexa can cut off ties with the Ark, putting them back on neutral ground. That said, the chances that the people of Tondc will maintain good relations with the Ark is pretty high up there. The missile incident brought Ark Camp and Tondc together as a group.   However... It's up to Indra as chief to decide whether these good relations are maintained. Lincoln has defected over to the Ark, but that doesn't change her respect for him. She had forgiven him on his traitorous acts (For the Arkers and as a Reaper) and even gone as far as to disobey an order, releasing Lincoln to help the Sky People. Indra respects Marcus, and vice versa. The people of Tondc are free to maintain any kind of political relationship they want with the Ark, but the last thing they really need right now is to fight all things given. It's taken too many lives to develop this alliance, and to toss it away will be to toss both Arker and Grounder life away. Tondc's decision won't affect the rest of the Woods Clan.  Meanwhile over on the Ark, well. They can't break a friendship with Tondc. Yes they have the greater technology and medicine, however, there are only so many of them left. Meanwhile, Tondc will have the full support of the entire Woods Clan. Without Clarke in the picture, it's up to Abby and Marcus to decide whether the alliance maintains, on a macro scale with Lexa or a micro scale with Indra. Their best option is to pick Lexa, as then they also get Indra, but considering Lexa's betrayal, there will be a heavy decrease in trust. Marcus and Abby should at least negotiate for true neutrality. We won't disturb you, you won't disturb us, and we are free to help each other as we see fit. Because when it comes down to it, the Arkers are incredibly outnumbered. And even if they leave, they don't know the land well enough to know about safe zones or other settlements.  Peace through alliance or true neutrality is inevitable if both sides wish to continue living without bloodshed. This world is about survival. The Arkers and the Grounders both know that, however each side has had it's own opinions on how to achieve survival. On the Ark they had to be ruthless and unforgiving, changing the rules once they reached the ground. The Grounders are ruthless and unforgiving, and we've vilified them for that. But what we've failed to consider is when they'll change the rules.  Oddly enough, that time is now. The Mountain Men have been eliminated, Finn's massacre forgiven, and the Arkers assisting in the recovery of Tondc. The Grounders have to start reconsidering their way of life. Especially with the philosophies Clarke induced. Clarke's a legend right now. There are some that will question the Grounder way of life and grow more curious about the Arkers. After all, the Grounders have been calling the Arkers weak for two seasons, then one girl and her friends organizes the death of 600+ people.  Each side has knowledge to offer. The Grounders also have their armies while the Ark has their technology. In the long run, it doesn't matter how the Grounders choose, but the Ark benefits from both neutrality and an alliance. If it comes down to another battle, the Ark will lose. It won't be a case like the Dropship; Anya's village vs. the 100. It'll be the Woods Clan vs. The Ark.  Looking at it as a viewer and as an imaginary participant, I'd say peace with Tondc is inevitable while relations with the rest of the Woods Clan needs work. But the two won't be going to war any time soon.  There's also the matter of the Luna's clan... But Lincoln won't let on more than ""She'll take us in""  Edit: Forgot about the mutants. A few mutants may find sanctuary with the Ark, but some of the others may not. Either by choice or by fear from the Ark due to their mutation. Admit it, if S2E1's riverside mutant lived in Camp Jaha would you be able to live without avoiding him or giving I'm strange looks, even if it's just for a day or two? Would you make an active effort to involve him in Ark activities? Mutants may be people too, but people are people, and people are assholes.  TL;DR: Friends will help friends"

The100,38obug,vonotny,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:11:40 2015 UTC,I think they can have a conditional peace. Like the Arkers and Grounders probably won't ever get along well enough for them to start sharing traditions but I think they can live in close proximity without killing each other like S1. I'm thinking that in S3 an even bigger threat is going to come along and make them all work together.
The100,38obug,Amonette2012,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:38:01 2015 UTC,"I think there will be, although it will be a fractious peace for a long time. Things like intermarriage will help in the long run.  I think the grounders will be quite wary of the arkers now that they've subdued Mount Weather. They're a force to be reckoned with and now they have missile silos. Making peace with them is a survivalist no brainer.  I do think the two sides are compatible - they're both brutal, survivalist societies, they are both uncompromising when it comes to war and they're both brave and have fighting spirit. I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't have crossover between any religious beliefs as well, as they're likely to have come from similar roots."

The100,38f7wg,IcouldbeAaron,2,Wed Jun 3 20:36:58 2015 UTC,"Wow that was actually really good!  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.  I see you've followed how the Wastelanders search for technology and made it an offering to ALIE, whom controls the train and jaha collects it presumably for the work they're doing on the missile.   Also the mutated people which have been present throughout the series are peaceful and forgiving, exactly what Clarke needs and I can definitely see them behaving this way, more or less.   Wen I first started reading I didn't really feel that raven needed to be pregnant, it felt like a cliché.   But the further I got the more I accepted the storyline.  Also glad to see Emerson back!  And surprised to see nygel make a return, I've got a bad feeling about that bitch.   All in all, a little work could be done with the dialogue to make it flow better (or something), but Im excited to read more, which you should definitely write!"
The100,38f7wg,ChiralChupacabra,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:03:47 2015 UTC,Thanks for the kind words! Really happy to hear you enjoyed it!
The100,38f7wg,Dikeleos,2,Wed Jun 3 23:41:45 2015 UTC,"Awesome story! However, I have 3 problems:  Bellamy and Emerson seem out of character and Echo is a part of the Ice Nation, not the Grounder Alliance. Jason Rothenberg told us in a tweet maybe a month or 2 ago. There was a post on here too.  Edit: Found it! https://twitter.com/JRothenbergTV/status/588169133117853696?s=09"
The100,38f7wg,Dikeleos,2,Wed Jun 3 23:20:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for reading and glad you liked it! Our idea was actually that Echo and the Ice Nation are actually the Grounder clan moving into Mount Weather while the rest of the Grounders are at Polis. Part of the difficulty with writing this kind of spec material is that we have to make it generally accessible to casual watchers of the show. For example, we used to have a line saying something like ""Trigedasleng echoes off the walls"" but we changed it to the more generic ""Grounder voices echo off the walls"" to avoid any confusion.  If you don't mind my asking, how did you feel Bellamy and Emerson were out of character? Just asking as we may do a rewrite at some point and any tips on how to improve would be much appreciated."
The100,38f7wg,paris2013,2,Wed Jun 3 23:46:26 2015 UTC,"When I think about I might actually be wrong about Bellamy. Something just felt off.   With Emerson however he seemed way too calm when coming face to face with some of the people who wiped out everything knew. His plan with the babies makes sense. However it would have been better if Bellamy came up with it because I think Emerson would be, or should be, full of rage during the first stand off. Bellamy suggesting they help Emerson with the babies could be used to diffuse his rage. Bellamy would still make getting them to the comms Emersons payment though.  I also feel a scene is missing after they make it out of MW. Emerson wouldn't want to go with them to Camp Jaha. Personally once they see CJ i think he would have given Bellamy the baby he was carrying and made him swear they would take care of the babies. Everyone in CJ would likely want to kill him.(Minus Bellamy, Abby, and maybe Kane)   So he goes back into the forest and in another episode, hopefully, he runs into Clarke. Which would be really interesting."
The100,38f7wg,paris2013,2,Thu Jun 4 00:33:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback!   Great points about Emerson's reactions. We went with Emerson returning with the guys to set up an Emerson-at-Camp-Jaha storyline full of crazy conflict with babies in the middle, but your idea could also definitely work.  Thanks again for taking the time to read it and give us some notes!"

The100,38f7wg,Kishara,3,Wed Jun 3 22:18:24 2015 UTC,"You could call if fan fiction but its purpose is very different; spec episodes are a standard part of getting work as a TV writer. Generally, you would never submit a spec as a writing sample for work on the show you wrote for (ie. we couldn't submit this to THE 100) for liability reasons. We wrote this specifically for a couple of fellowships that we applied to and figured I'd post it here for fans of the show who might be interested. While it would, of course, be amazing if anything happened because of attention it gets here, the purpose of posting it here isn't to advertise ourselves as writers but rather just to share something with fellow fans of a great show."
The100,38f7wg,ElenaOcean,3,Wed Jun 3 23:40:27 2015 UTC,OK. Wait so you send this to other places you appliy to? How do they know if it is out of character?
The100,38f7wg,Kishara,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:55:23 2015 UTC,"A spec is part of a writer's portfolio and is something we will send out in the hope of getting work/representation. The people who read it (agents, managers, executives, and showrunners) would need to have some familiarity with the show, but a good spec is one that doesn't require them to know the show backwards and forwards (I talked a little more about this here). In other words, they should know enough about the show to tell if the characters' personalities are more-or-less true to their portrayal on the show, but they don't need to know that Monty and Jasper, for example, were arrested for growing ""stuff.""   For more info on spec TV episodes, check out this article."
The100,38f7wg,Kishara,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:34:07 2015 UTC,"In a way that is probably true, but serious spec scripts can also be submitted when a writer is trying to apply for a job with a show. Posting it here is not the way to go about getting that job though unless it is a really miraculous bit of work the writer is hoping will go viral (unlikely with our small subreddit).  I flat out will not read fan fic. I want no outside interference between my enjoyment of a show and the creators work."
The100,38e37i,ElenaOcean,8,Wed Jun 3 16:44:01 2015 UTC,"""When you die, can I have your shoes?"" Kyle's first appearance I believe - He also quotes Alien which I totally missed last time. I just realized this is where Clarke knows to cut off Anya's braid and give it to Lexa. - because she sees Anya cut off Tris' braid. Another thing I missed last time, Clarke asking the grounder about his ""kill scars"" - Clarke would have like... 600+ kill scars if she was a grounder. I wonder if she'll do anything while she's away to mark all the people she's killed to signify her ""bearing it"". Maybe it'll even become part of their traditions some day when Clarke has her own clan. Not necessarily scars, maybe she'll paint a wall of a cave or something and it'll become a memorial spot."
The100,38e37i,Jay013,3,Wed Jun 3 18:49:42 2015 UTC,"They're way too stylish for him :P  And if not Clarke, then soneone else. Odds are, both sides are recording her acconplishments. She'll probably have something similar to Jasper's goggles or Licoln's journal or Lexa's gears. An item of significance. She has the gun of leadership...there's that."

The100,38e37i,ElenaOcean,2,Wed Jun 3 19:36:12 2015 UTC,"For a long time I thought the watch was just written in because Eliza has a tattoo on her wrist and they needed to cover it up, but now that you mention it, she is actually the ""time keeper"" of the story. It's usually Clarke's actions that propel the story forward, and she's only in that position because of her father, who gives her the watch."
The100,38e37i,Jay013,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:26:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but we aleady know the story behind the watch. It's from the Pre-Ground Era. Symbolizes her dad."
The100,38e37i,Shotokanguy,3,Wed Jun 3 19:48:36 2015 UTC,"Man, it makes sense that activity here has died down but you'd think there'd still be plenty of talk about the episodes!  This one was kind of a build up to the finale. It has a lot of plotlines and I think it's hurt a little bit by quick jumps from one thing to another. That said, it's all still great stuff. This is yet another episode showcasing the writers' intelligence in handling these characters. On a lesser show, Raven and Bellamy's one night stand would lead to continued drama later down the line, but in this show, they know what it means and they both respond maturely to how Raven feels afterward.  And, of course, Kane's entire thing was great. This was probably where I really started to like him. As a cable installer, crawling in tight hot spaces is a familiar struggle. And this plotline also introduced Wi - I mean Kyle.  Lastly, the insight it gave us into the Grounders. This was the first time we really got a sense of their warrior culture. And this episode has one of my favorite Eliza Taylor moments - how did she get that look in her eyes after killing that Grounder? It was amazing."
The100,38b20j,clearly_i_mean_it,7,Wed Jun 3 01:35:19 2015 UTC,"There doesn't need to be any deeper thought to it, really. People get hung up on two big things:   The possible threat the Mountain still posed   They don't pose a threat, though. Not only would they have left the mountain, as that was the whole point of the bone marrow, the Mountain also had no power. Launching missiles was out of the question. And out in the open, with their children exposed...the Mountain Men would never go to war with the Grounders in their own element.   She was willing to let all of those people die in Tondc to save only a few at Mount Weather   No, she was willing to let all of those people die to save a few people AND end the threat of the Mountain Men. That's what she did with the truce. Who knows how many of her people she not only saved right there without a battle, but in the future, with no more Mountain Men rounding up Grounders for blood?"
The100,38b20j,Shotokanguy,7,Wed Jun 3 03:08:10 2015 UTC,"Moreso, think about the state Mt. Weather was in when Lexa made the truce.   Acid Fog was down and unrepairable. 90% of Mt. Weather's soldiers are dead. Also note a blood covered Grounder Army and Emerson being the only one captured. An uprising had occurred on the inside, and Arkers are attacking from the outside. She gets her people back without losing anyone else Mt. Weather's best electricity source was gone, and back-up generators were draining.   Mt. Weather is crippled. Ultimately, the only threat Lexa faces comes from whoever wins the war. And even if Mt. Weather won, what the hell could they do? They can bomb places all they want, but without working satellites, they'll need people out in the field as a spotter. The Grounders are masters of stealth tactics. Now that they know from Clarke that spotters are needed to guide missiles, they know what to look for. Added note, the first sniper we see in this show was easily spotted and killed. He only killed a Grounder because his hand clasped. Anyway, they can cure who they want, but they'll need soldiers.  The Mountain Treaty forbids the Grounders from the lands around the Mountain. Grounders as we know are very territorial. As soon as a Mountain Man crosses that imaginary territory line, the Grounders have free reign to do as they wish to them.  The ultimate threat depends on who wins, but in the long term, it doesn't matter because the Grounders will win regardless. The Ark won't risk a war, Mt. Weather can't afford one.   I said it during the episode discussions, Cage sucks as a leader.   Extra note: Regarding the spotters, keep in mind that Lincoln only lost because his Reaper weakness was exploited."
The100,38b20j,Jay013,4,Wed Jun 3 03:53:47 2015 UTC,You think they wouldn't missile Polis anyways? Gotta teach them grounders to NEVER rise up. Plus trusting the MM? Stupid. Just stupid.
The100,38b20j,ofcourseitsok,3,Wed Jun 3 02:31:41 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't really buy it.  There must be something for to it surely..
The100,38b20j,travelingkiwi,2,Wed Jun 3 03:40:50 2015 UTC,"I would agree with this but for one pretty solidly pointed out plot point. Lexa knows that the MM would need to send a person on foot to Polis as a spotter to launch a missile at it. I'm not sure how many air tanks a person can carry, or what sleeping in one of those radiation get ups would be like, but likely that would be a task too great for the MM to accomplish. I found it a bit silly that the spotter for Ton DC was able to get close enough to do his job. I'm currently explaining it away with ""Everyone was just too busy to notice that no one was keeping watch on the perimeter"".   Lexa agreed to the truce and to attack the MM for two main reasons. 1) To destroy the threat of the MM 2) To return the reapers into the grounder fold  I've been trying to come up with some logical pragmatism that would lead Lexa to betray Clarke and leave the Reapers behind. So far the best I can do is that Lexa understood that for the MM to be willing to make a deal with her the MM had to be afraid that they might lose the battle which speaks to troubles on the inside. A possible rebellion of the 47? Maybe even a little bit of civil unrest. With that knowledge she decides that it would be better for her people if instead of wiping out the MM they instead allow the MM and Sky People to fight it out in a bloody and protracted war. MM kill the 47 + Clarke and the others who came to the mountain to fight, the rest of the Sky People get mad about it and decide to throw everything they can at the MM. MM are now trapped in their mountain no due to radiation sickness but because the Sky People are kicking their ass. The end result being an extremely weakened winning side and a demolished losing side. All threats to the Grounders put down nice and neat without any Grounder lives lost at all...aside from the reapers she is abandoning but that's a paltry cost since they had previously written them off as lost anyway.   Lexa is smart enough to understand that the Sky People are a far greater threat to the Gounders than the MM could ever be. The MM are trapped in their mountain after all. The Sky People however have already bloodied the Grounders nose and it was just 100 children that did that. Now that the main force of Scientist, Doctors, Military specialists, and Engineers have landed on the surface...yeah. Sky People were going to be a problem, better to take them out now than risk trusting them and being betrayed. It's cold hearted, and treacherous...but it's logical."
The100,38b20j,TomorrowByStorm,3,Wed Jun 3 06:29:15 2015 UTC,"to add to this, Jason explained that Lexa actually needs the MM alive because it's the only thing keeping the 12 Clans together. They're united under a common enemy so they hold off fighting each other. If the MM are defeated, its only a matter of time before the Grounders turn on each other.   I think you're right that when Emerson offers her the deal she expected/hoped the MM would cripple the Arkers. - I think Jason even said she fully believed that Clarke and the others were going to die at the Mountain. That way the Arkers aren't considered a threat to the Grounders but are instead at their mercy, and she keeps the MM as the boogey man her people have been afraid of for so long."
The100,38b20j,ElenaOcean,2,Wed Jun 3 09:49:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not goign to argue with you about the decision Lexa made because I feel like I've done that a 100 times already, I would just like to point out that I don't think the MM would need a spotter to bomb Polis.  Assuming they know where Polis is, and we can assume so if only based on the sheer amount of grounders they've captured, they can definitely figure out at least some rough coordinates, and that's all they need to fire the missile. The spotter they used was there to make sure all the leaders were actually there, maybe refine the coordinates a little to really make sure it hits exactly where it should. You don't need this type of information to bomb a capital, where your target is killing as many people as possible/causing as much terror as possible, not killing specific people."
The100,38b20j,jorisimo11,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:41:44 2015 UTC,"We know that the Grounders valued innocence - they’d never purposefully kill a child or the elderly in cold blood, but this isn’t cold blood - it’s war. The Mountain Men had been hunting the Grounders for a hundred years. They’d been turning them into monsters. And if stopping the harvest of their people meant doing something that resulted in the death of innocents, then it was an unfortunate cost they would pay.   Hahahahahahahahahahaha Let's not revise history here. The 100 were pretty innocent when they landed. The Grounders tried to repeatedly massacre them, including using biological weaponry against them."
The100,38b20j,PM_ME_YOUR_GOATS,4,Thu Jun 4 07:09:26 2015 UTC,"The Grounders attacked them first because they crossed the line into the Mountain Men's territory.  The could have killed the whole group, but they only speared Jasper - the one that violated Mount Weather's territory.   When they attacked again it was because they thought that they had purposefully burnt down one of their villages when they sent up flairs.  Within their world, both of those things were acts of war."

Utopia (British series, not the American reality show) is amazing and I haven't seen it around here. STUNNING visuals and a really intriguing plot from the get go. They're making an American remake on hbo.   Black mirror is another fantastic one. I highly recommendation the Xmas special with Jon Hamm (sp?)"

The100,384z5y,Kishara,2,Wed Jun 3 23:35:23 2015 UTC,"It's summer now so I'm playing catch-up and going through a ton of different series while also rewatching favorites. If anyone ends up trying even one show from this list then I've done my job haha. My recents!    Scifi:   Orphan Black    Starring Tatiana Maslany with Tatiana Maslany, featuring Tatiana Maslany along with award-winning actress Tatiana Maslany and guest stars Tatiana Maslany and Tatiana Maslany. ""One. Of a kind.""  Black Mirror   It's an anthology series, which means that each episode presents a different story and a different set of characters. You can jump in and watch any one episode and then walk away (but watch one and the next thing you know you've binged the whole thing, amaright?). Most people suggest newcomers start with Season 1 Ep 2 because the first ep can be intense and disturbing, which might turn you off from the other episodes.  ""Fifteen Million Merits"" was brutal. 10/10 would pay not to watch any ads again.  Misfits   A group of unruly, sailor-mouthed misfits (heh) get struck by lightning while doing community service and gain superpowers overnight. Shenanigans ensue. Need I say more? Think 'Skins UK' meets 'Heroes'. Kinda gritty, absolutely hilarious. Some uniquely written characters with good character development. Seasons 1 to 3 are its peak.      Historical:   Vikings -- I'm glad this has been mentioned several times already, it's become one of my fave shows so far in 2015.   Slow start but invest in it and you get sweet, sweet payoff in the form of excellent acting, writing, and action scenes.  There are some really pretty people here (seems to be a prerequisite in most CW shows so I thought I'd throw that in there lol). Sexy Jesus Travis Fimmel and those eyes. BAMF hairstyles The costume/wardrobe department is on point.  Outlander   Who wouldn't wanna be thrown back in time to meet this handsome Scot? Watch for the plot. Always the plot. Okay.      Comedy:   Parks and Recreation   Has a mockumentary-style setup a la 'The Office'. The fourth wall is frequently broken. One of the best tv casts to ever cast. Start at Season 2, Season 1 was testing the waters and it drowned spectacularly. The ""previously on..."" segment in S2's premiere should catch you up. Ron Swanson for president.       Drama/Others:   Sons of Anarchy   About a motorcycle club that lives by its own rules. Quite gritty. Shit gets real often. Starring Hellboy and also Ragnar's doppelganger (they're cousins don'tcha know?).  Inside No. 9   ""A dark and macabre look behind the front-doors of houses with the number 9."" Same style as 'Black Mirror,' it's an anthology series. But no scifi element to it as far as I know, just clever writing. Tagged as a dark comedy. I recommend S1E2; almost no dialogue but hooks you right from the beginning.  Sherlock   Ehh, I think it's some unknown show starring Smaug and Bilbo Baggins? He's no psychopath, he's a high-functioning sociopath. Please do your research. #ProtectMollyHooper  Game of Thrones   Everybody and their mother watches this, I have nothing to add except that Jon Snow does know some things. Also, dragons. And Kelly C.      .  Too much? I thought it was a great use of my Monday night hahaahaahahhahahahahah.  tl;dr: Currently watching GoT and Orphan Black, slowly getting into Daredevil. My recs (with commentary) are in bold :)"

There are so many shows out there that get positive acclaim from critics and everybody mentions them online on threads asking for recommendations, and yet at the same time you or your friends have never heard of them.   It's just a matter of having different tastes and investing some time in watching a lot of pilot episodes until you find the shows that really click with you."

The100,38002o,ElenaOcean,5,Mon Jun 1 01:01:07 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen a definitive reason, but I suspect that they want to air season 3 with as few breaks as possible. Moving the season to 2016 will allow the CW to air it more like a tv event. Breaks can hurt really continuity dependent shows, so having as few breaks as possible and keeping the momentum up would be beneficial.   They also probably want to give the second season some time on Netflix. I've read in a few places that the show does really well on Netflix. The CW may be looking to pull a Breaking Bad and improve ratings with those Netflix viewers.  While it sucks to wait, it looks like the CW is trying to give this show a good shot."
The100,38002o,TheLGD,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:00:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I remember reading somewhere that one of the creators wanted as many people as possible to get hooked on the show during the break.  The 100 just was released on Australian netflix as well the other week, which is good :)"
The100,38002o,usainboltron5,3,Fri Jul 10 00:00:58 2015 UTC,"According to Pedowitz:   ""I think 'The 100' into 'Jane' might have been a little bit twisty, but to have a show like this for midseason, a real critically acclaimed show and then the episodes will all be up on Netflix and having the fans the opportunity to catch up, it's a big Netflix favorite, and having the opportunity to catch on years one and two as we being year three, maybe the show can get the real due it deserves and then you have that 'Breaking Bad' moment,""   CW has rejigged their schedule and paired similar shows together to improve views. So Jane the Virgin is paired with the new show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (people are pretty skeptical about this and predicting cancellation), The Flash is paired with iZombie, Arrow with Supernatural, and TVD with The Originals. Reign got the Friday night death slot and was paired with ANTM.   Legends of Tomorrow (new DC show in the Arrow/Flash universe) will premier mid-season, along with another Julie Plec show Containment - which is apocalypse/disaster themed, so maybe they have plans to pair it with the 100 as a better fit and keep the DC shows together? I get the impression they found it hard to gauge the best place to put it where its target audience will see it, because it's their only real Sci-fi show.   Shooting is still going ahead in July, so the longer break means more time for post-production. So while we wait, season 2 gets netflix and DVD release, people binge watch both seasons and get hooked and when it comes back in S3 there's a larger audience."
The100,38002o,chaostree,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:55:08 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess a midseason premier will help the show last right up until Game of Thrones begins, helping to avert one of the worst TV waiting periods of the whole year (other than summer of course)."
The100,38002o,usainboltron5,2,Mon Jun 1 20:08:40 2015 UTC,I also heard that since it will probably be a while that when it does start it will go without breaks. No hiatuses.
The100,38002o,chaostree,2,Sun May 31 21:53:41 2015 UTC,"That's good since the show looks like it's only going to get more exciting. I will appreciate not having to spend too long wondering what will happen. Whatever it is, it's going to be beyond epic I'm sure."
The100,38002o,usainboltron5,2,Mon Jun 1 17:17:38 2015 UTC,I can't believe I put off watching this show for so long then one night I marathoned the whole first season and the second up to the finale to episode where I caught up. Such a fantastic show. I can't wait to see where this goes. Do you think there are more people alive on earth?
The100,37yt8q,woupieta,4,Sun May 31 15:36:21 2015 UTC,"Last week we went on day trips, with the idea of going on further trips in the long term. Maybe we could build some ""safe houses"" with a small food and water supply multiple days away from the camp. That way people going on these long trips will have some places to resort to in case things go wrong.  I also like the idea of watchtowers, but I'd like to have them a few hours away from the camp. Do we have acces to a radio? Otherwise maybe we should find some other way to relay messages quickly, have we seen any pidgeons by any chance?"
The100,37yt8q,Milo_BOK,5,Sun May 31 21:34:35 2015 UTC,"Safe houses would be an excellent idea. The more hidden the better. Watchtowers would rock as well - a LotR-esque ""lighting the beacons"" approach might come in handy so we can have some sort of early warning signs against potential invaders."
The100,37yt8q,Kishara,3,Mon Jun 1 17:33:18 2015 UTC,"Yay!  A new one, thanks amon <3  Ok I think it is time to start looking at organizing our society. This can be tricky to do and there are a lot of ways we can go. Democracy, anarchy, benevolent dictator, monarchy, republic, etc... Amon is the final authority here, so we can call her ""The Goddess"".   On the ground we need some sort of social structure. I like a council format with someone appointed to have the final say (not it!). We could rotate the chair position  to ensure no one has too much power and the chair only intervenes when it is really necessary. Clarke leads The 100 but does so in this kind of a style, getting people to help and making the really tough calls by herself only as a last resort. Getting people to agree to work together is necessary for survival and having a formal structure for governance can facilitate that imo. Just a suggestion!   On to the future plans:  Yep we need to save the drop ship. Perhaps we should use it as a cabin for people who need to get away from the group for awhile. That way it is being guarded as well as allowing everyone some needed alone time. I just watched this season of Bear Gryillis' The Island and it was pretty clear one of the hardest things people have to deal with in a survival setting is each other. I know I value my quiet time and would have a really difficult time being around people day in and day out that I did not choose to be with. Getting the chance to take a couple day break away from the crowd would be energizing and invigorating."
The100,37yt8q,Jay013,2,Sun May 31 16:51:29 2015 UTC,"Democracy and oligarchy seems the best government. Because anything else, I will try to take over. I don't know why. Every multiplayer game I play I always end up trying to become leader of what eger group I'm in. Tactics depend based on the game. Sabotage is my favourite.   And I'm sure there are others here like that.  Personally, I prefer Oligarchy. Take the most respected people in the camp and make them leader, untilizing votes amongst themselves to come to decisions."
The100,37yt8q,Kishara,3,Sun May 31 17:24:12 2015 UTC,TBH- There is something to be said for a benevolent dictatorship.  A good dictator can motivate and push ahead with projects quicker and without all the fussy red tape. But the risk of getting the wrong kind of dictator is too great.  Democracy is easily corrupted. It can be great to start with but then it decays. Oligarchs are effective but there is always going to be some resentment when everyone does not get a say. Representational govt is the way to go imo but as we grow that has so much potential to become corrupt. Hey what if we rotate the systems of government as well? Try one kind for a month then change it out to another? That way there is less potential for revolution in the end.
The100,37yt8q,Jay013,1 point,Sun May 31 17:35:11 2015 UTC,"So you're telling me I have a chance?  Brb. Planning an uprising.  It's not like I don't have the credentials though. In my Anthropology class we simulated a situation like this. We were split into two groups. I declared my self leader and told everyone what needed to be done to survive. They listened and we ended up with a perfect score. Also, while it wasn't part of the simulation, I prepared an armory to go to war with the other group...apparently I took it too seriously. It didnt affect my grade but I did really scare some people.  The Ark had a pretty good system...until Diana. But no single form of government is immune to corruption. It will happen and we need to deal with it when it does."
The100,37yt8q,Kishara,2,Sun May 31 17:47:50 2015 UTC,"Haha! Yeah, power can corrupt if there are no checks in place. What makes the difference is the motives. Someone who wants to use the force for the public good can be very effective whereas someone who wants power for their personal satisfaction is a serious detriment. When you weigh the risk v benefit ratio, usually you have to decide against a dictator. But we do have a goddess who can enforce a time limit so it is doable for a short term experiment if people want to try a dictatorship."
The100,37yt8q,Kishara,1 point,Sun May 31 18:01:19 2015 UTC,"I like this direction. Especially the goddess part.  I also think that if we move in the direction of perhaps adding extra settlements to our camp as well as things like taverns and bathhouses we can create a few social goings on as well. Being bored is not good for people, nor is working all the time. I feel one major thing we need is some outlets for people to use to take some downtime and to help forge a community spirit by having some fun together."
The100,37yt8q,ElenaOcean,2,Sun May 31 17:01:04 2015 UTC,"Oh wow yeah. This is why you are the activities god here as well lol. Great thinking. I know before we had talked about having a spa with a sauna and that has to be done. I am not living around a bunch of people who stink of rancid sweat all the time. We also need a hospital cabin and a mess hall. The mess hall can also double as the meeting area and a dance hall, theater, vaudville shows etc... Outside we can make some bean bag toss games, croquet, a baseball/football field. We should try and make building these things fun and have an awards ceremony after each project is completed to thank everyone for helping."
The100,37yt8q,woupieta,2,Sun May 31 17:11:17 2015 UTC,one major thing we need is some outlets for people to use to take some downtime and to help forge a community spirit by having some fun together.   ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
The100,37yt8q,ElenaOcean,1 point,Sun May 31 22:17:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with having some place to get some quiet, but I don't think the drop ship is suitable for that. Personally I'd feel too confined, as it has no windows and the like. Maybe construct some small huts further away from the camp, that way you'll also have less noise."
The100,37yt8q,Jay013,3,Sun May 31 21:24:50 2015 UTC,"I think we need watchtowers, and volunteers who don't mind a little isolation to man them. I know I sound paranoid, but I don't trust the Grounders and I don't want to be taken by surprised if they decide to turn on us. We need a plan if things go wrong. Maybe we can build a tower structure above the dropship?   On that note, we need to start training people to fight. We should prepare a good armory and make sure people know how to use their weapons.   I also like Kish's idea of electing a rotating council. And I think wwhideanseek's idea of sending out riders to form an alliance with other nations is a good plan. Maybe we could even exchange two of their warrior for our own to ensure their safety. That way the Grounders will get a better taste of our way of life too and we can gain some insight into their culture and learn their language."
The100,37yt8q,ShaneH7646,2,Sun May 31 17:23:00 2015 UTC,On our second day I said I'm turning the top of the dropship into a little nest to keep lookout from so we've got one covered. I can expand if needed if you want to make a tower up there. I will need something for the winter so it's bound to happen. And perhaps we can implement the watch towers with my wall upgrade plan.
The100,37yt8q,wwhideanseek,2,Sun May 31 17:54:01 2015 UTC,Placing a tower on top of the dropship (assuming it's stable enough but I think we're good) sounds like a sensible plan to me.
The100,37yt8q,Jay013,2,Sun May 31 17:57:38 2015 UTC,"I don't trust the grounders either, would be happy to help"
The100,37yt8q,wwhideanseek,1 point,Sun May 31 23:01:34 2015 UTC,"The 'warrior exchange program' sounds like a good idea. But we should consider sending two redshirts, just to be safe..."
The100,37yt8q,wwhideanseek,3,Sun May 31 18:17:23 2015 UTC,"The dropship is our most valuable asset. It's an icon really. Hell, I sleep on top of this thing. But unless we adapt to our environment, we will eventually have to leave the dropship.  Starters, winter. We need to get cabins built, fireplace/hearth is essential. We can't use the dropship due to its lack of insulation and exposed areas where the cold can seep in. We need to hunt. Not just for food but for pelts and furs. We need blankets and insulators.   We need a better wall. One that can resist storms a little better. We'e gone through a hurricane, so we know how we should build.  We also need to clear the immediate area of trees. This is so that if something does get knocked over, it's away from us. Doing this also gives us materials for the cabin, and space to expand.   We need to set up a more efficient farm. What we have so far won't cut it in the long haul. We need to maximize what we can while we can then get an area ready for crops come next season.   Water tank. Because screw you nature. You and your drought-hurricanes.   An army. I've trained with the Grounders, as well as some of my redshirts. But we need to get everyone battle ready in case something arises. Plus everyone learning how to fights benefits each person as an individual. Lets get those weapons made shall we?  Government. I personally prefer oligarchy. Take the most respected people in camp. People others listen to. We need something that allows multiple pointa of views for judgement. Also, we need to minimize the chance of corruption and a self declared leader. Kinda like the Ark Council only without a Chancellor.   Laws. Self explanitory.   So yeaj. That's my ideas..."
The100,37yt8q,Jay013,2,Sun May 31 17:41:06 2015 UTC,"Deforesting the area around the camp is sensible to some extent - we could use the materials, the farming space and the decent view of possible enemies incoming. Also we can use the dropship fuel to blast out the tree roots, although this is extremely dangerous and we should get Raven to plan this one out."
The100,37yt8q,wwhideanseek,1 point,Sun May 31 17:59:35 2015 UTC,blast out the tree roots   I think this might be a little bit overkill.
The100,37yt8q,wwhideanseek,1 point,Sun May 31 18:10:27 2015 UTC,That's the best way to get really big roots out of fields. Bit of ANFO or dynamite saves you spending days digging it out. We happen to have something just as explosive that would take em out pretty easily.
The100,37yt8q,wwhideanseek,1 point,Sun May 31 18:24:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get that, but if we use the drop ship it would only work in immediate vicinity, and don't we already have no trees inside the camp?"
The100,37yt8q,Jay013,1 point,Sun May 31 18:28:59 2015 UTC,Oooh no I meant take a little bit of dropship fuel and use it to blast out tree roots further away from camp. Not use the actual dropship!
The100,37yt8q,wwhideanseek,3,Sun May 31 18:34:10 2015 UTC,Lol. I misinterpretted too. Glad to know you're not planning to make an inferno over a few roots xD

We should restructure the whole 'Guard' thing, create ranks, build a decent training program, make everyone go through it and keep the best ones as soldiers. We should also separate hunting from the guard/army and have hunters outside the army."

The100,37yt8q,aajjjj,2,Sun May 31 19:58:31 2015 UTC,"Oligarchies generally turn tyrannical and direct democracy can turn into mob rule while representational democracy becomes particracy. Consensus democracy (in which there are committees rather than individuals making decisions about everything) is probably the best bet. It allows for minority opinions to be voiced without the fear of majority overrunning them, and for all solutions to be brought up and discussed. As a day to day government, this would probably be the best.   We would need a war council, though, given the political realities of life on the ground, but we should be careful with the selection of those people. This is an area that is not something that the general populous would be able to function in without prior experience -- this is a council that would be a meritocracy, much like on the Ark. And some sort of UN-type group nestled within so that the general action isn't ""BLOW SHIT UP.""  Long term, we need to have more exploratory teams. We need to figure out how winter is handled here, we need to learn migratory patterns of animals and people, and we need to hammer out actual, proper agreements with the locals rather than tentative 'well, we won't poke you if you don't poke us' agreements. We need bone needles and sinew and furs to create clothing for the winter. We need to figure out how we're going to divide up the living spaces - yes, Bellamy was all 'gonna reward the people loyal to me,' but we all saw how that sort of situation splits people.  We need laws and the punishments for breaking those laws. We've been using exile and tying people up into trees, which are both harsh punishments. However, we're handing exile being used as a punishment rather well, given that we only exile a person for a week. In these upcoming weeks, I feel like exile would only be hurting us as well, so I move for work detail on the unwanted, but necessary jobs. We also need to expand the skills of everyone within the camp, especially in terms of food preparation because it's easily a place where one wrong thing can cause trouble for a lot of people (looking at you, nuts). I want everyone to know at least the basics of first aid, and for each outgoing group to have a kit on them that will allow for stitching, healing tinctures and salves, as well as basic poison-treatment, bandages, and a sterile blade."
The100,37yt8q,wwhideanseek,1 point,Sun May 31 18:44:26 2015 UTC,"It almost doesn't matter what government we decide on as there will always be an opposing or corrupting party. That's just politics.  A knowledge trade seems like a good idea. At first we did it based on what we wanted from others but a shared skill set is beneficial to all. Plus there will always be some better at one thing than others. Also, if you do agree to this, then you need ti accept my offer to teach you to use a bow in the event there's a food shortage and everyone needs to hunt. Cause it happens. :P  Poison treatments though we might not want to risk. We should ask the Grounders for help with that. We don't know if mutation has changed anything, if things changed. They do."

The100,37rcqo,ElenaOcean,29,Fri May 29 19:46:20 2015 UTC,"Murphy. He's the only character who doesn't try to ""do what's right"" he just does what's best for him. While the others get caught up on the morality of their actions, Murphy is unapologetic and just owns it.   He also calls everyone out on their bullshit. When Clarke accuses him of not stopping Finn, he throws it back at her. He smirks at Raven when she tries to double-cross him and he slaps Jaha with the truth when he tries to justify his decision with the 100. Murphy gets it, he sees everyone in terms of their actions and not the words they use to justify those actions.  Most importantly, despite being lynched, ostracized, tortured, infected with grounder Ebola and hated by everyone, he still manages to maintain a sense of humor. And now he has a sweetass pad.    All praise Murphy, the motherfucking King of Sass."
The100,37rcqo,Jay013,6,Fri May 29 20:45:41 2015 UTC,"And now he's a main character, so you know we're in for a good time!"

Although I want to add that one of my favorite things about him is that he is a complete ass without ever being evil or a bad guy.  I also like how he has a backstory that explains why he acts like a jerk and focuses on himself.   And since we're getting more Murphy next season, I want a flashback of him on the Ark."
The100,37rcqo,Psych555,3,Sat May 30 21:37:10 2015 UTC,"He's definitely the least pretentious. Every character serves their own best interest, ultimately. He just doesn't try to justify it to anyone. A real man."
The100,37rcqo,fretspyder,3,Sun May 31 02:51:25 2015 UTC,"Amen, survival is priority number 1, even if means taking out those who tried to kill you once before, but may not be currently a threat.

The100,37rcqo,RileyWowkIMA,2,Sun May 31 16:21:24 2015 UTC,"I hated Murphy with a passion at the beginning of the season 1, but when he got exiled i felt horrible. HE'S AN EMOTIONAL ROLLER-COASTER OF LOVE AND HATE."
The100,37rcqo,leeah,2,Sun May 31 23:09:48 2015 UTC,Came here specifically to preach the sweet truth of Murphy. That little shithead is definitely my favorite. I could literally wax poetic (and I may come back and do so later) but for now it'll suffice to say Murphy rocks.
The100,37rcqo,DontcallmeGeorge,11,Mon Jun 1 10:49:15 2015 UTC,Without a doubt Raven is my girl. Her snark and smarts get me right in my happy place. Raven is evolved enough to know that being in an idiotic love triangle is a stupid place to be and she says no thanks to that nonsense. She is so smart and no matter how much she suffers she always does the right thing regardless of the personal cost to herself. She really is my hero.
The100,37rcqo,Shotokanguy,2,Fri May 29 19:48:57 2015 UTC,Mine 2 such a badass female role model 2 and Lindsey herself is just as amazing how could u not love her
The100,37rcqo,Google_my_ass,9,Sun May 31 02:52:13 2015 UTC,"Do I really have to explain why I like Clarke? Even if she's not your favorite, she has a special place in all of our hearts.  It's funny, I never really considered her my FAVORITE until the end of 2x16. Her decision to leave Camp Jaha was the thing that made it all click for me. Her journey up to that point had been compelling enough, but when you see how wise and selfless she is in that final moment, it makes even the bad things she's done easier to respect."
The100,37rcqo,isforwinrars,8,Sat May 30 19:31:04 2015 UTC,"I wish I could say Wells, I was so shocked when they killed him off. He was selfless and kind.  My personal favorite character is Indra.

The100,37rcqo,Jay013,17,Sun May 31 03:23:36 2015 UTC,"Clarke.  Because she's smart, makes interesting choices and although  she can genuinely see the good in people and believes in them, she's not weak.   Wish they would give her a chance to like, chill and relax though. These last two seasons have been pretty stressing and hope people stop giving her shit (looking at you octavia).  She's also hella fine imo."
The100,37rcqo,Bazadaqui,14,Sat May 30 04:14:24 2015 UTC,"Just one? How can you make me choose between Raven and Lexa? I thought we were friends!  All seriousness though, if it comes down to it, Raven's been around a lot longer. She was my favourite all through season 1. She's a smart, resilient girl who can kick ass with a certain flair that no one else can. And by flair I mean bombs.  She's too smart for her own good, knowing when and where to be emotional and when to compartmentalize. She's had a hell of a lot of suffering, and not a lot of good. She's to the point. No bullshit from her. She's quick to get things out of the way. Whether it's her own emotions, or a problem with the enemy. Speaking of, even when injured, she's not just going to sit around. She will pick up a weapon and fight, even if she's on the brink of death. She's a fighter through and through, and lastly, she's loyal.   Her achievements!   Got a perfect score on the Zero-G Mechanic test, first ever perfect score. Built a dropship out of scrap parts Made bullets we can actually use Made landmines Made a bomb to blow up a bridge that survived the apocalypse. While bleeding and crippled, assisted Clarke and Jasper in setting up the dropship to blast-off Radios! Radio beacon. With design help from Wick of course. More radios! Survived all kinds of physical and psychological torture. can go from naked to dressed in less than 3 seconds.   And of course...   Is a unique Ark character as she has the only red Ark jacket in the entire show.   And if I were to marry Raven, this would probably be the toast I give at the wedding xD  Seriously though. Out of all the characters on this show, she's the one who deserves a vacation the most.  Favourite Raven scene? Probably the scene where Gustus is searching her. I collect knives for a hobby. And seeing Raven decked out head to toe in blades was a big turn on."

The100,37rcqo,Dikeleos,4,Sun May 31 02:49:12 2015 UTC,"My personal favorite is Lexa. Something about a young girl commanding all of those grounders is just amazing to me. She does what she has to for her people, not for herself. That is just great, no matter what it is. She is also very very attractive. :)"

He's always caring about others, and also he's smart. I wish he'd get more screen time in Season 3. Probably my favorite scene was when Monty called Dr. Tsing on her bullshit about not doing the blood transfusion before, and staying there. That was great.

The100,37i37e,Jay013,6,Wed May 27 20:13:53 2015 UTC,"I could dive in to the philosophical undertone of the episode, but really, there's only one thing to take away from all this...  RAVEN MAKE BOOM!  The first time I watched this episode, I was scared that Raven was going to die blowing up the bridge. What a relief when Finn showed up and managed to pull her away. After subsequent rewatches, it became really impressive. Raven, afflicted by the Murphy Virus, managed to get all the way to the bridge, set up the bomb, and was ready to blow it up.   As for Murphy, well you can tell exactly what kind of psychological damage the Grounders did to him. He ran to the camp looking for shelter, but was still scared of actually being in contact with anyone until he knew for sure he was secure. First time around I thought he was a dick for killing Connor, but after some rewatches well...  Clarke initiated the Murphy problem, but was the only one to help him once he was stung up. Murphy could have killed Clarke any time and blamed it on the Virus, which people would believe after two deaths. But no. He kept Clarke alive because he's even with her. She caused his hanging, but she also argued against it, and cut him down after the confession. She also spared his life while Bellamy wanted to kill him. Connor on the other hand kicked Murphy around and hanged him. Hung him? Hanged him. Myles is killed for being the one to provide the rope, but that's another episode. Murphy only killed, or tries to kill, those he has a score with. Jasper was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, but Murphy didn't want to kill him. Otherwise, he would have already.  Also, haha, the ""sneak-out"" scene between Clarke, Bellamy, and Octavia still always makes me laugh.  So in short, Raven make boom, Murphy's misunderstood. Well, depends on how you see it I guess. He's a jerk, but he's not a completely bad guy."
The100,37i37e,Shotokanguy,3,Wed May 27 20:36:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know why people seem to justify Murphy's murders in this episode. Eye for an eye is ok in this world?  Sure, I like Murphy, but I still feel like he needs to pay in some way for those cold blooded, cowardly killings."
The100,37i37e,Jay013,3,Thu May 28 00:47:36 2015 UTC,"So people try to kill him without hearing his side of the story, and he's suplosed to let that go? I mean, yes Murphy killed someone, but only those who were directly involved in his Floating. The rope, the hanging, and the kick. He's still a killer, but it could have been worse."
The100,37i37e,Shotokanguy,3,Thu May 28 02:34:16 2015 UTC,"It's not even ""eye for an eye"". Murphy didn't die.  Seriously, how can you defend it?  Anyway, just watched the episode. Surprised there aren't more responses. This is another one that I feel like I can appreciate even more on a second viewing. The biological warfare, the visuals of the blood, the visuals at the crash site, the bomb at the bridge...some really heavy, cool stuff in this episode. This is probably another point in season 1 where people thought ""man, this show is surprising me"", and it gained a few more permanent fans.  Again I feel like mentioning how well the writers handled the characters. It's hard to explain, but they all seem to be on the same page when it came to writing a serious show with mature characters who are never petty and are all likable to some degree. Even if some (Murphy) took longer to become likable.  For example, we have moments in this episode like Raven breaking up with Finn calmly, Finn and the others debating military strategies like deterrence, Clarke calming everyone to keep the camp quarantined, Octavia not choosing to leave her people for a guy she just met from a society of killers. Those are all moments that you'd want to see if you were asked what should happen before you actually see how it plays out. I mean, I'm pretty sure the first time I watched the episode, I was thinking ""Octavia's not really going to leave them for Lincoln, is she?""  Ugh. Such a good show."
The100,37i37e,Jay013,2,Thu May 28 04:24:39 2015 UTC,"Because they created Murphy. Sure, Murphy's a typical jerk that makes threats and does stupid things like push people around, and pee on people. He's a general ass, but he wasn't a killer. He makes countless threats to Wells, which he never acts on (except for that one fight which Wells did have a hand in initiating). The only reason Murphy became a killer was because everyone else tried to kill him.  It's amazing how the characters in this show are ""human."" They make human decisions, human mistakes. You can relate to them. Unlike other shows where some characters are just a bit too op for their own good."
The100,37i37e,Shotokanguy,2,Thu May 28 04:45:54 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think Murphy sees killing those guys as survival more than plain old revenge. He managed to return to the safety of the group so he eliminates the people who are the biggest threat to him staying in the group. Murphy is still doing what he does to survive, it's just that the group turned on him so he owes them no loyalty.  Side note - it's interesting how the motive is more important than the method or body count. Everyone is so quick to crucify Murphy or Finn, but somehow we all rationalize Bellamy and Clarke's actions because they did it ""for the greater good"" and because they are likable characters."
The100,37i37e,Jay013,1 point,Thu May 28 16:57:35 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm sure Murphy would've killed Wells in that knife fight if he had the chance. You don't get in knife fights to land one little cut and walk away."
The100,37i37e,AdrienI,2,Thu May 28 05:00:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe. Assuming Bellamy lets it get that far, and Clarke's elsewhere. Speaking of knives, Murphy's knife looks like it'd be really awkward to hold. he could have done a better job."

The100,372zdj,Jay013,1 point,Sun May 24 17:39:08 2015 UTC,Technically it wouldn't make any difference - you're not going to persuade four fully grown wolves to obey you even if you have a year.  Training one from a pup would still take you around six months (basing that on having trained a German Shepherd pup myself). The idea of this challenge is to see how far you get in a day though. We will have longer ranging ones later :)

I send a further four south toward the Blue Ride Parkway, with this map and a compass. Perhaps with one of the horses so they could carry back more items? (Damn it, there are olives and grapes in Virginia and I am getting them) I give the first team drawings of things that will most likely help us, along with any modifications to the images from my plant book that have happened as a result of mutation, cloth sacks that they can wrap roots of any bushes in, and a former pill box to put seeds in. They can scratch an image or the word on the top of the section.  And then I go find Anya's second to get her to teach me to fight because I'm probably about the same size as Tris and I need some skill to get close to someone without getting killed myself.

The100,372zdj,ElenaOcean,2,Sun May 24 20:57:56 2015 UTC,"I walk towards the south east. After a few hours I come upon a school bus. As I search the bags of the kids, I find myself a few small knives and a pinch flashlight. Apparently they where headed out to some kind of camp.  Unfortunately their clothes aren't of any use to us, as there's nothing more than rags left.  As I leave the bus, I see something what looks to be a squirrel. I try to chase it, but after a while it scurries away into a hole I can't follow.  Suddenly I find myself in an open space, not entirely sure which way the camp is. At the side of the clearing are the remains of a shed. While pondering which way is the right way back, I go through the rubble. I find a few loose, rusty hammer heads in different weights and seizes.  When I start to think there's nothing useful left, I see something we already needed a few weeks ago, an anvil! It's in decent shape considering all that has happened. There's only one problem, the thing weighs 50kg, so there is no way I can take this thing back to camp on my own, even if I knew where to go.  As it is getting dark by now, I start to build some kind of shelter out of the rubble. I curse myself for not bringing some kind of warm clothing with me. Luckily the multitool I found had some kind of flint, so I can at least build a small fire. So much for a day trip..."

The100,36qe0k,sonicmerlin,24,Thu May 21 08:04:41 2015 UTC,"So I binged watched this show in like 3 days and loved it. Waiting for the third season will be hard. The premise is great and I can't wait to see more of it, such an addictive show.  That being said I agree with every single point you made. A lot of things in the show are just jarring.   I think the inconsistent adult characters might be the worst. Jaha being by far the biggest offender. It often seemed like the adults became whatever character the plot needed at the time - it's like ""hey we need someone to be an enemy for Abby this episode"" ""oh just use Kane""  and then ""hey we need someone to be best friends with Abby this episode"" ""oh just use Kane""  My biggest complaint with the show was how everyone should have just instantly handed over Finn, dude became a regular Eric Harris and they actually tried to defend his actions. Even going so far as to blame Murphy - like, what the fuck did Murphy do except be there? Finn was an awful character in the second season and it was good that the Grounders got their justice.  I actually think a lot of the issues we share with the show are probably down to the writers catering to the target audience. You know, the young people are the stars so in order to make them seem smart they have to make the adults dumb. That idea I think spreads through the whole show.  Again, I love the show but it got some issues."
The100,36qe0k,JohnnyReeko,4,Thu May 21 08:35:12 2015 UTC,"I didn't mind them defending Finn.  They didn't want him horrifically tortured.  No civilized society would agree to that.  OTOH pardoning him after he massacred a village, without even considering the strategic consequences of his actions was just ridiculous.  Also how did the kids keep getting in and out of camp without permission so easily?  It's surrounded by live wire.  They only deactivated the wire one time.  One of my favorite shows is an anime called Trigun.  The main character has a no kill policy in a savage society full of sociopaths and murderers.  He's morally consistent, and even as he loses himself in murder in one episode he finds a way to back to his belief system.  The show had an underlying message that made it endearing.  Most of these ""gray area"" shows are doing it just for shock value."
The100,36qe0k,ofcourseitsok,1 point,Thu May 21 18:31:35 2015 UTC,"I'm late to this discussion, but wanted to add some about Finn. I still can't get it through my head that they kept defending Finn, even sneaking him outside the compound. So it's ok to save the mass murderer and leave the rest of the Sky People to die to the grounders? They should have held a going away party and let the grounders have him. Cold I know, but you have to face reality. I am not trading the survival of my WHOLE colony on one idiot that lost it. Ugh.  Just wanted to get that off my chest. It made me so mad to watch those episodes."
The100,36qe0k,hailsimba,3,Fri May 29 18:48:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah also telling the kids ""they agreed to let us put Finn on trial"" would have avoided the whole running away incident.  Instead they told them ""we're busy we can't talk about it right now.""  Because it's not like the kids have any incentive to run away."
The100,36qe0k,Shotokanguy,13,Sat May 30 20:42:39 2015 UTC,"Bone Marrow: That's kinda the whole point. The Mountain Men wanted something so bad (to go to the ground), that they would do anything to get it. After the Sky People found out they were bleeding grounders and tried to kill their kids, do you really think the Sky People would be okay with an alliance. Even at the beginning before all of that, they kidnapped the 48 and wouldn't let them leave. They didn't know that they could use bone marrow until after Clarke found out about the bleeding. However, the whole science behind the bone marrow was kinda wonky.  Lexa's Retreat: I was in the same boat as you when I first finished S2, but I definitely started to understand her decision. First off, Lexa had no idea what the MM had. We, as viewers, know they have nothing left, but Lexa doesn't. They could have huge machine guns or rocket launchers that would kill hundreds of her warriors in 5 seconds. She's already lost a lot of people (300 just at the dropship) and was given a deal in which every one of her people would live in exchange for just 50~ sky people. Also, she's the commander and the grounders do as she says. Even if they were blood thirsty, they're not going to disobey her.  Missile: By saving the many she meant all the people that would be turned into Reapers if they let the MM there. If they evacuated the city, the MM would know they knew about the missile. They had no idea Bellamy would get caught, they were just trying to do what was best. Mind you, Clarke is only 18 and Lexa's probably around that age too.  Adults: I agree with you about the adults, but we also have to remember that they're not really used to negotiating or even forming alliances with other people as they've been by themselves for 100 years.  Jaha: I hate him too.  Finn: PTSD. He's also only 17 or 18 and was freaking out about losing his friends. There are lots of discussions about that here.  Monty/Jasper: Obviously Jasper was hurt by Clarke/Monty/Bellamy pulling that level, but I believe that that was just because it was in the moment and he was upset about Maya. I hope he comes around. There was nothing Monty could do in that situation.  Octavia/Indra: The commander of all of the grounders called for a retreat, you can't stay behind and fight. The deal included every single grounder (Even Octavia). She had to follow the commander's orders and didn't."
The100,36qe0k,Amonette2012,2,Thu May 21 10:40:27 2015 UTC,"Bone Marrow: The MM didn't try to kill the 47 until after President Wallace was imprisoned.  Before that, releasing all the kids (as Wallace eventually decided) and beginning trade relations, perhaps by donating food and supplies to the Sky People as a gesture of good will, was the obvious choice.  That's what humans do.  That's how alliances form.  Even Kane at the end screamed ""we can donate it!!!""  Lexa: Lexa does know what they have.  She trusted Bellamy enough to let 200 of her people and all her leaders get bombed to keep him from being discovered, all so he could keep feeding them intel.  And again, nothing is preventing the MM from betraying their agreement exactly like Lexa did to Clarke.  Her betrayal was a nonsense plot twist.  Her people's core philosophy is ""blood for blood"".  Lexa would have been overthrown if she didn't execute Finn.  You think her people would follow her over a truce with the MM, right after chanting ""blood for blood!!!"" when debriefed on the attack plans?    Missile: Lexa is depicted as a brilliant strategist.  What would happen to the Allies if all their leaders died, and someone knew they had inside info and let it happen?  The risk of that info getting out was enough to drive Lexa to try and kill Octavia.  Except multiple people in the Sky People camp knew they had cracked the encryption.  Lexa was willing to risk her entire leadership on the idea that no one would notice?  It's silly.  You always evacuate leaders.  That's just how war works.  This idea that Bellamy was ""their only hope"", that nothing else could be done if he failed, that everything had to be done ""Now!""... was forced on us.  Adults: They've been playing politics on the Ark for 100 years.  Remember Battlestar Galactica?  Factions form all the time on a tight, closed off ship.  Heck they had to deal with traitorous rebels.  Finn: That's not how PTSD works.  He exhibited no signs of PTSD whatsoever until that point.  Raven dying of poison and Lincoln being tortured?  Nothing.  The dude even returned Lincoln's knife to forge an alliance with the Grounders.  Monty/Jasper: He could have stayed with him.  Been there for him.  Put a hand on his shoulder.  Give him a hug.  Not just say ""sorry"" and walk away.  Indra: She doesn't even try to convince her new apprentice to leave?  She just puts a knife to her throat and tells her she's no longer a Grounder?  5 minutes after she tells her she is?  Is Indra bipolar?  Apprentices require a huge investment of time and training.  It's literally counter to human nature to throw them away after one resisted order.  Indra's decision was irrational.  Just another silly plot device."
The100,36qe0k,ElenaOcean,6,Thu May 21 18:03:34 2015 UTC,"It's amazing how often the term ""plot hole"" is misused. The bone marrow thing doesn't make a whole lot of sense. That doesn't make it a plot hole. A plot hole is a contradiction of something previously established.  I'm actually having a hard time remembering every point, but yeah, they could've done a better job explaining why the Mountain Men couldn't wait and why the procedure had to kill them. That whole thing drove the conflict, but it was some iffy science holding it up. Not a plot hole.  I'm not even going to go in depth on Lexa's decision. It makes sense. She let the missile hit Tondc so they'd have a shot at ending the threat of Mt. Weather later on. That's what she did with the deal. Even if none of it made sense and it was just bad writing, it'd still not be a plot hole. A plot hole would be if Lexa said ""Grounders never retreat from a fight"" and then they retreated after the deal was made."
The100,36qe0k,Amonette2012,9,Thu May 21 22:56:58 2015 UTC,"We've discussed the first two points ad nauseum, so rather than go over it again I'll just summarize and if you want to you can go look back at some of the older posts.  Bone marrow: yeah it's a plot hole for multiple reasons.  Lexa's betrayal - sensible under the circumstances. For all she knew they had a couple of machine guns mounted behind that door, or they could have been kettled and gassed. It was a case of 'live to fight another day' and she would have been nuts not to take the deal. Also it was considerably more than 50 grounders in there. For more on this please check out the episode discussion for the season two semi final.  As for moral compass - morals are a luxury. Many of the kids have been in jail for years or are orphans. They were raised in a draconian tin can, of course they're going to have some complex morality issues.  I don't think Finn was psychotic - he had PTSD. Again, if you search this sub for 'Finn' you'll find extensive discussion, it comes up a lot.  Indra is an odd fish and I agree with you there, but on the other hand Octavia was disobeying a pretty big order.  Sounds like you just didn't really like the show?"
The100,36qe0k,Jay013,9,Thu May 21 09:02:57 2015 UTC,"I feel like the show itself doesn't actually have a moral compass at this point. If the story was told from the Grounders POV we would see the Arkers as the villains. Really, the viewers are the show's moral compass. We're presented with provocative situations and then we judge the characters on their actions based on our own morals. That's why everyone is always so divided on who is innocent and who deserves to be punished."
The100,36qe0k,Jay013,3,Thu May 21 09:48:49 2015 UTC,"Interesting point. I think morality in the show is one of the main themes in some ways, because you do get people having to make these horrific them or us survival based decisions. As we were discussing the other day, morality is one of the luxuries you get when life isn't just hand to mouth survival. In The 100, the characters are constantly having to either choose their own people over others or kill some of their own people in order for the rest to survive. I think Kane's 'I will take this back to Adam and Eve if I have to' line pretty much sums it up."
The100,36qe0k,Jay013,3,Thu May 21 09:52:45 2015 UTC,"Bone marrow thing wasn't really a plot hole. Keep in mind it was an accidental discovery by Dr. Tsing. Cage and Tsing wanted to return to ground but Dante wouldn't let them test the operation. There would be no point in making friends with the Arkers if it doesn't work, and Dante pretty much wants the kids untouched by the time we're at this point. So Cage has Harper kidnapped to test it. Thats when problems began."
The100,36qe0k,N0BODYSPECIAL,1 point,Thu May 21 18:09:10 2015 UTC,"There is nothing stopping the MM from betraying Lexa exactly as she betrayed Clarke.  How does such a ""rational"" and ""strategic"" leader not realize the advantage over the MM she had with the Sky People vanishes as soon as their alliance dissolves?  She let 200 of her people die b/c she trusted in Bellamy's intel and believes that was the only way they could defeat the MM.  Moral compass isn't the issue.  It's moral consistency that is utterly lacking.  One episode they're empathic, the next they're psychopaths, then the next they're Jesus reincarnate, and there's almost nothing to indicate why they changed.  PTSD doesn't work that way.  Finn was perfectly fine despite all the horrible things happening until that point.  He nearly set up an Alliance with the Grounders.  He went psycho b/c Clarke was captured.  I mean really?  After he found Raven (and she barely survived being poisoned to death).  After the Sky People landed establishing some semblance of stability and order.  Only now does he snap?  I'm neutral on the show.  There are pros and cons, and there isn't much good sci-fi out there."
The100,36qe0k,Jay013,8,Thu May 21 18:24:23 2015 UTC,"Lexa was given a way out of the battle without losing a soldier while her two enemies battle it out to the death. Of course she would take it, and plan to defeat who ever comes out victorious.  This is survival. There's no room for morals. They act how they need to to get from point a to point b.  PTSD does so work that way. The war with the Grounders was only a few days ago. His lifelong friend is paralyzed, his friends have been killed or captured, and the girl he loves was taken by people who live for violence. You really think a normal person wouldn't go crazy?"
The100,36qe0k,ofcourseitsok,-2,Thu May 21 19:00:22 2015 UTC,"The Sky People aren't even a match for the Grounders let alone the MM.  That's why the Sky People asked for an alliance with the Grounders to defeat the MM.  Once the MM take out the Sky People the Grounders are as vulnerable as they were before.  And what happened to ""blood for blood""?  Lexa risked being overthrown if she didn't get revenge for Finn's rampage, but the blood-thirsty twelve tribes are okay with a truce with the people who have been terrorizing and mutilating them for decades?  It goes against everything they built her character up to be.  Nothing in the episode suggested Finn was experiencing difficulty handling the atrocities going on for weeks up until Clarke was kidnapped.  The whole Anakin thing was the writers deciding the actor sucked, no one liked the character, and they needed a convenient way to get rid of him."
The100,36qe0k,Jay013,4,Fri May 22 00:00:35 2015 UTC,"And yet Bellamy and Clarke were winning with minimal Trigeda input. Also, you're forgetting how strong the 100 have made themselves to be. By the time Lexa was offered the deal, the Mountain Men were crippled. All of their immune soldiers are down, they lost their power (electricity), the Veil is gone, and the Mountain was dying from the inside. It didn't matter who won because both sides are weak enough that Lexa can simply come back and take out whoever's left.  Jus drein jus daun while an important to Trigeda philosophy, the well being of their own is more important. Four Trigedakru were captured by Reapers and yet all warriors Indra could spare went out to look for them. Nyko and the seconds could have easily overpowered Finn given the chance, but Nyko chose the method that kept them safe. Until Artigas and the old man just went for it anyway. The first Grounder we see in S2E1 was mourning the loss of his comrade in battle. That says a lot about who they really are. They're people too. And as much as they want revenge, they'd rather live to fight another day, more so if that day has their long lost friends.  It doesn't go against Lexa's character. Her role as Commander to take care of her people. That's exactly what she did. The Mountain Men were weakened. She has a chance to help her captured comrades and not lose anyone else. Why would she march her people into battle when there's another choice? She doesn't know what was behind that door, and she's already seen the Mountain contain some heavy set weapons. She chose the option that saved more Trikru lives. As a Commander should.  Stop comparing it to Star Wars maybe? So, for three weeks they're living in fear due to Trikru. Then a war happens. Raven is dying and Clarke is missing. He's panicking. He gets his team together for a rescue mission. He's got one thing on his mind. Clarke. He sees Delano wearing her watch. He captures him. But shit, he doesn't know where she is either. Delano tells them to check the village. No one knows what to do with the Grounder, so Finn kills him as a part of his revenge. They get to the village, Clarke's not there. A man jumps out and runs. He could be attacking. Finn shoots. He shot out of fear. Then everyone else starts going, and Finn starts shooting again. Finn is scared, worried, panicked. There's no minor build up to it because the war only happened literally just the other day."

This is late, but part of the reason why the grounders agreed to enter into an alliance with the sky people was because the sky people had the means to cure grounders, who had been turned into reapers, without killing them in the process. Taking the deal effectively kills all those reapers, and the number of reapers should be greater than those used for harvest."
The100,36qe0k,Pfitzgerald,2,Mon May 25 19:34:04 2015 UTC,"Like Nyko said, we save those that can be saved. As far as the amount of reapers go, a lot of them were killed in S1's We Are Grounders. In S2, we've only seen three groups, usually less than 8."
The100,36qe0k,The_Iron_Zeppelin,0,Mon May 25 19:36:47 2015 UTC,"Late to the party here. I get what you're saying but I'm going to disagree.   PROS for leaving battlefield   All soldiers alive at that time get to continue living Get the ones in cages freed Your 2 enemies are fighting each other (found this from another's post)   CONS for leaving battlefield   Essentially dissolved the alliance and potentially gained a new enemy. Betrayal is not cool. Blood for blood means that others will view her as weak and that means she is dead. These people were willing to go to war over 20 people being massacred. You just wasted 200(ish) lives for 50. MM can, and most likely, will dissolve your truce when its convenient for them You have the MM on the precipice of defeat. Your greatest enemy is about to be put down forever. And don't give me the line about not knowing what weapons are inside. The MM are negotiating with you and that let's you in on how truly desperate the battle has become. They wouldn't negotiate if they felt they could win. Don't get taught how to free the remaining reapers.   Now I'm sure the PROs are not fully fleshed out because it's counter to my argument and I couldn't really think of anything that sounded good, for the grounders perspective, for a cease fire. It makes no damn sense what happened."
The100,36qe0k,vteckickedinyooooooo,1 point,Fri May 29 19:07:19 2015 UTC,"First, just to get the count right, Clarke confirms there are at least a hundred Grounders in the harvest chambers.   Second, there's no doubt that the Mt. Weather, if they survive, will attack the Woods Clan. But they'd only do so after they've recovered, which they probably wouldn't have to the point like they were before. No power, no defences. No sure-fire way to control the reapers now that both factions have a tone generator. If the Mountain Men step into the woods, they're in Trigeda territory, and we've seen how well they fight under the shroud of the forest. Oh and guess what. When the emergency generator runs out, the missiles can't be launched. Clarke told Dante that she took out the generators in a way they can be fixed, but she hadn't had the chance to catch up with Raven yet.  Meanwhile, the Ark can't do shit. Yes the Guard is trained, but we've already seen them picked off by Grounders and crucified. All the Ark has to offer is their technology, and a helping hand. And maybe some medical knowledge, because I don't know how the fuck CPR didn't get passed on through 100 years. The Ark has only a few hundred people, the Grounders have thousands spread over 12 Clans.   So what do you have? You have a weakened enemy, with crippled defences, that knows they're at a disadvantage if they step into the woods. You have the Ark who, ally or not, wouldn't risk attacking you.  Regardless of who wins, the benefit goes to Lexa. Mt. Weather is no longer able to fight, and the Ark would never attack knowing they're way out matched. Meanwhile, not one of your soldiers die while the enemies take each other out.  As for Jus drein jus daun, the 12 Clans were united as a force to fight against Mt. Weather. So we know that the Mountain and the Grounders have been fighting for a while. 57 years according to Dante. Lincoln is the first to question Lexa, Indra, after what Octavia told her, is starting to develop doubts. Of course, after 57 years of war, you'd want to consider alternatives. You're throwing army after army at an enemy that can't be touched. A new enemy rises up and invokes the ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" tactic. At this point, too many of your soldiers have died, and in the view of the soldiers, too many of your comrades have died, to consider philosophy over actuality.  And if you really want to get into Jus drein jus daun, keep in mind. Lexa sent Tristan to kill the 100. After Clarke gave the order to kill the 300 Grounders, many Grounders held the ""jus drein jus daun"" philosophy over members of the 100. Lexa let them live and formed an alliance instead. Penn and Quint are the more visible ones. The Grounders are aware of their philosophy, but they're also aware of how things change in battle."

They have guns. They have camouflage and sniper rifles. I'm sorry you can spin it any way you want, but the grounders are going to lose. Also if you want an idea how it would go then watch the episode with the sniper. Picking them off one at a time and the best they can do is run and hide. You have your WORST enemy on their knees and you say, nah we cool. No, no we are not cool. And Lexa is as good as dead if they actually follow how the grounders are supposed to act, how they told us they act.  You've stopped just short of winning the war and are allowing both enemies a comeback. Should take notes from Genghis here and destroy them."

They vacillate between 3 states every couple episodes: pure evil, neutral, and empathic.

The100,36qe0k,hailsimba,2,Sat May 23 05:02:51 2015 UTC,"You are me yesterday. Just finished Season 2. Lots of valid points. I thought the finale fell apart in a lot of ways, especially with the Lexa deal. It's like... ""You were pretty much RIGHT there to kick everyone's ass."" and instead she bails? I feel as if it was more petty and vindictive on her part, like she was pissed that she had feelings for Bellamy and not her and wasn't going to put out. That's my take on it anyway, makes way more sense than any logical bullshit excuse Lexa could come up with.  I also thought it was dumb that Indra blindly followed Lexa. Like, I was kind of hoping that she left because, hey, maybe Lexa or her people are in trouble, and once she found out that she made a deal with the enemy she'd say ""Fuck this shit. This is cowardly."" But, no, she's way more pissed that Lexa forms an alliance with the Sky People who burned 300 people alive and had a rogue agent kill 14 elder/children as opposed to Lexa making an alliance with the people who turned whoever she knew/cared about in that tunnel into a Reaper and also enslaved their people for 70+ years and used them as human blood bags. Like... seriously???  All of that aside, my biggest beef with the finale isn't even any of that. The biggest problem I have with it is this groan worthy ""Evil AI"" thing they're doing for the big bad in Season 3. Not only does it not feel like anything I could care about, but... ""Thanks for the Missile you sent to earth from space, we're gonna use it to nuke the world."" or whatever dumb shit she was talking about, it was all so cheesy and lame feeling."

When Cage and Tsing discovered it, they pitched it to Dante, who immediately rejected it, and wanted the kids untouched. What would be the point in making friends after you've taken their children if the treatment doesn't work? And before you say anything, Clarke escaped, remember? So she can confirm their malicious intentions. Anyway, they have Harper kidnapped so they can test it. Dante decides to release the children, Cage gets desperate. By the time he realizes what's happening, he knows he's gone to far and can't go back. Hence why he rejects Marcus's idea for donation. Lexa's Betrayal: Consider this. Your enemy has already weakened another one of your enemies, then wants to team up with you. Of course you say yes. That other enemy then offers you a way out of the fight. So now your two enemies are fighting each other, and you have a way out of it without losing any more soldiers? Of course you take it. Also, do you really think Lexa hasn't considered that? She's renowned for being the Commander that united the 12 Clans. At this time, she's already going through ""What Ifs"" in her head. And the only reason Mt. Weather attacked Trigeda before was because of the need for blood. They wouldn't waste their weapons on pointless siege against Grounders. They're smarter than that. The Missile: 250 actually. And there are more than 50 in Mt. Weather. Also, think of what Bellamy was able to do before he got discovered. He shut down level 5, saved the 46, and had Maya arrange a safe place for the 46. Now what would have happened if Cage was looking on his monitor going ""Why is no one in the village? They know"" So then they realize there's a spy, place goes on lockdown, a sweep is made, and everything is that much harder for Bellamy. Finn's Body: How is that conversation a depiction of stupidity? Kane asks what happens to Finn, Lexa gives an answer, Kane suggests an alternative. They weren't negotiating. Also, Kane and Abby at this point have had two weeks on the Ground. Clarke has had a month. Clarke knows the rules of this world while Abby and Kane are still learning. Moreso, even with his lack of knowledge, the political relations between Arkers and Trigeda are maintained by Kane. And he does a damn good job. Morality: This is survival. Who you are, and who you need to survive are two different things. There's no time for morality. Might wanna go back to Season 1 to see Bellamy's take on this. Also, Jaha isn't cruel. That's Ark law under the Exodus Charter. Any act that hinders the survival of the Ark is treated as a capital crime and punishable by death. If a man steals food to feed himself or someone else, he's preventing another person from being fed. This is what happens when you live on a space station with shit resources. Jahesus: The people elected him as chancellor. He has an obligation to be there for them. So he finds a way back to Earth while taking on Hypoxia on the way. He only brings up the city when his people are under threat of being completely eradicated. So... Do you stay and fight knowing you'll be dead the next day, or leave and hope you find someplace safe? This was discussed in Season 1's We Are Grounders. Again, survival has no room for morals. Richards just got eaten, Murphy's bleeding out, and the boat is damaged. Craig wouldn't row. So... bye Craig. Finn: That's what happens when you lose someone you love in the fiery blaze of war. Yes, he was rational before the war. It makes sense that he would have a psychotic break afterwards. No one was the same after that war. Clarke became closed off, Murphy got chill, Raven loses her confidence, Monroe becomes more useless than usual... I could go on. Finn lost Clarke. Makes sense that he would go crazy, especially in this world. Also, he got scared when that Grounder jumped, hence why he shot. then everyone started jumping, and he couldn't think properly. Murphy should have stopped him though. Maya: Monty had to make a choice. Allow Maya to die, and ruin his friendship with Jasper, or save everyone else? Monty has known Jasper his whole life. He knows there's nothing he can say to make it right. So he just apologizes. No excuses, no bullshit. Monty really is sorry, but there's nothing else to be said. After that, he goes to see his friends. Octaviaof the sky people : As a Grounder, Octavia has an obligation to listen to orders given by her superiors. She was disobeying Lexa and Indra by not following the retreat. Then she says ""I don't trust Lexa, neither should you"" right to Indra. Someone who's fought for Lexa probably countless of times. So, Indra revokes Octavia's title. And also, this is war... You need to pick your battles carefully.   Sounds like you just didn't enjoy the show if you spent this much time trying to look for it's flaws. Try changing the way you think. Instead of looking on the outside, put yourself in the place of each of the characters. Limit yourself to know only what they know, and try to feel how they feel. Everything makes sense when you limit your point of view. The only reason we can talk like this is because we as the viewer see everything at once."
The100,36qe0k,ofcourseitsok,3,Thu May 21 18:55:01 2015 UTC,"I already made my own post about this above, but I just wanted to second everything you said as you explained it all quite a bit better than me. I think people need to realize that many of these characters are teenagers. They don't always make the right decisions and sometimes moral compasses are a little shaky, but that's the point of the show. You can't expect 15-18 year olds to always be able to do the absolute perfect thing right in the moment (Hell, I've even seen people comparing Carol from TWD, a middle aged women, to 18 year old Clarke when it came to the whole Charlotte thing). Once you finish the season, it's easy to critique things because we have an all-knowing POV. The characters don't have this."

The100,36qe0k,grilledstuffed,1 point,Thu May 21 20:36:53 2015 UTC,"Because people expect teens to be able to have the same experience/insight/ability to make decisions for the long-term like people who are in their 40s. People comparing how a 40-year-old handled the whole child-turned-murderer thing to how two 17-year-olds handled it shouldn't be happening. It was just an example as to how people expect teenagers to handle things the same way people who are much older than them do, which is completely unrealistic."

Whoever made the post was saying how the only option they had with Charlotte was to kill her because of what she did and how crazy/dumb it was for Clarke and Finn to want to save her. It was talking about how both Lizzy and Charlotte killed a person and didn't deserve to be redeemed and how Clarke should've done what Carol did. I can go find the post for you, if you'd like, because you obviously don't know which post I'm talking about. To be honest, you're coming off as really passive-aggressive right now and it's really confusing me.  Once again, I'm not the one who made the comparison between the two scenes, it was someone else. Repeating this because it seems like you think I was the one who said they similar. I just think it's dumb to compare an 18-year-old to a middle aged women, that's all I'm saying."

The100,36qe0k,bubbles0luv,1 point,Fri May 22 02:23:06 2015 UTC,"Way late to the party, but I want to discuss this.   Lexa's Betrayal: Consider this. Your enemy has already weakened another one of your enemies, then wants to team up with you. Of course you say yes. That other enemy then offers you a way out of the fight. So now your two enemies are fighting each other, and you have a way out of it without losing any more soldiers? Of course you take it. Also, do you really think Lexa hasn't considered that? She's renowned for being the Commander that united the 12 Clans. At this time, she's already going through ""What Ifs"" in her head. And the only reason Mt. Weather attacked Trigeda before was because of the need for blood. They wouldn't waste their weapons on pointless siege against Grounders. They're smarter than that.   I can understand letting your foes go at it, but you are making this sound cut and dry as an easy decision. MM wouldn't have asked for a truce if they weren't extremely concerned for their chances of winning the war. The outcome of the two fighting could be that they both leave the battlefield for another day. Now instead of the Sky People trying for peace with the grounders, they are seen as an enemy.  But the most important point of NOT taking out the MM is that they have superior tech and weapons. You are just leaving yourself set up for an American Indian type scenario. You won the battle, but just lost the war.   Sorry, I see this as a terrible decision. Given their history I would have been absolutely ruthless with the MM, killing everyone. Why everyone? Because then you don't set yourself up for a revenge uprising later with their children leading the charge."

The100,36qe0k,nah_you_good,1 point,Fri May 29 19:36:57 2015 UTC,"The one that really killed me?  Maya.  Why wasn't there a plan to grab a couple of IVs from the medical ward when they went to grab Dante?  Mya has seen the transfusion/blood filtering procedure done hundreds of times, Clarke has rudimentary medical knowledge (which seems to have been completely forgotten in S02) and could likely start a couple of IVs on a donor with Mya's help.  They could have hooked her up to Monty, Jasper or even Bellamy or Clarke.  Then they could have just walked back to the Ark filtering her blood, put her in the airlock and have a few dozen people donate some bone marrow to save one person.  I'm sure just Jasper would have done it as long as it took.  All I know is that the plan of, ""We'll find you more air canisters...... we can't find any, hopefully level 5 doesn't get irradiated!"" doesn't even count as a plan.  If I had been Jasper, and it'd been someone i loved I wouldn't have put up with that as an option."

The100,36qe0k,Jay013,1 point,Fri May 22 00:06:21 2015 UTC,"1) Abby suggested that to them but they said no.  You have to look at the Mountain Men's motives from their perspective, they have grown and died within mountain, they would do anything to walk the surface.  They find means to do so they take it at any cost.  And it wasn't the entire mountain completely for killing kids, just those in power.  2) Again, we can't call Lexa's plan illogical just because she made a decision that seems that way to us.  The grounders have a different culture, that culture seems to be focused around strength and community.  Lexa found an easy way out of war with a more advanced adversary sparing her people, of course she took that option.  Her deal with Clarke was to get her people back, she could care less about the Sky People.  You thought because they were an alliance they were friends, but in reality they were just helping each other out, once the Grounders didn't need the Sky People they ditched them because its not like they are related or even friends.  3) I disagree, these characters show a wide range of emotions and respond differently to different situations.  Thats what people do in the real world.  Its a nice sentiment in a TV show to have the archetypical protagonist who always makes the right choice or always is self sacrificing or morally sound, but in the real world that just doesn't happen.  Regular people have to choose between a rock and a hard place everyday and they don't always choose what sounds good morally and I think the show captures that essence of reality and incorporates it nicely in the show."

The100,36qe0k,crwbr,1 point,Sun May 24 00:27:15 2015 UTC,"Dante and Cage had different approach to the bone marrow matter, and I think if the mountain men were still lead by Dante they would have gone with the donation thing you said. But different leader means different beliefs and Cage for whatever reason didn't believe the 48 sky people would be kind enough to donate their bone marrow for 300+ mountain men like that. And even if, it would have taken much more time for the whole process, and he (and many other mountain men) became kind of impatient after living 97 years trapped in the mountain. The ground was their ultimate dream, and when you can reach it for sure today, why wait for a maybe tomorrow. The deal between Lexa and Mount Weather involved freeing all the grounders captured by the them (which is a few hundred, a lot more than 50, I think because of budget reason it may didn't seem like it on screen), but also peace with the Mountain Men for the future, since they won't need any more grounder blood because of the permanent cure that is bone marrow. No more war, no more blood, and all her people free, without any more losses. This is a pretty good deal, and all she had to do was to break the alliance with the sky people. Any wise leader would have seen this was a reasonable choice. And they don't need to kill the mountain men any more because they are no longer a treat, there is no point for the Mountain Men in capturing any more grounders since they will be cured. So the only real reason left, for Lexa to not betray the alliance, would have been revenge. She choose to take the deal, because she cares about her people lives more (same thing when she took the alliance with sky people even though they killed 300 of her warriors) About TonDC, there was a risk. And they couldn't take that risk. Who knows if Bellamy would have survived at that moment? If the mountain men went full force to get him a lot earlier than expected? They have to maximize the chances, because that's what strategists do, they can't rely on luck, and nobody can predict the consequences. Bellamy could have survived, but he also could have die, and the whole war would have been lost. What is interesting in the 100 (and most of TV show) is that characters are evolving, and changing, like in real life. I am not the same than I was 2 years ago, for example, because I went through event in my life that changed how I think and view the world. And that's also the case for Jaha, Kane, Finn... Jaha went from a selfless leader that is willing to sacrifice himself for his people, to someone who believes he has a greater purpose in life, because he thought that he should have died out there in space, but somehow he has not and he doesn't know why. So he is trying to find a reason, which leads him to this constant quest of a purpose that drives him crazy. Finn turned into what he became because of the thought of loosing all his friends, and Clarke (he didn't know they were safe in mount weather), after all they went through. He was kind of the positive guy who believe in peace, and think they somehow can avoid the war. But it never happened, it became worse and his people kept dying one after the other, and when Clarke disappeared, he lost himself, he lost any hope of peace. He just wanted her back at any cost. Anyway I don't think those are plot-holes, people are changed by events, and that's why they react differently according to the episode. If I can add, Monty feel very sorry to Jasper, and I think it is the same as Clarke when she walked away from Camp Jaha. He couldn't bear to see him like this, because what put him in this situation was Monty himself. He killed Maya by hacking the system, he let that happened, he was part of the cause of his best friend's pain. Seeing Jasper like this was too much for him, let alone console him, because he is guilty, so he walked away. Octavia is Indra's second, and a part of being a someone's second is to ""never question order"" and to just follow them, she made it clear from the start. Octavia broke it when she decided to disobey Indra. A second can make mistakes, of course, mistakes are allowed. But what Octavia did was not a mistake, she was aware that she went against Indra's order, and still did so after her warning. It was her choice."

The100,36qe0k,jorisimo11,1 point,Sun May 24 04:20:12 2015 UTC,"The way I think about it is the show is good with macro strategy, but so bad with the micro strategy. They routinely suck on simple events that define characters, but then turn around and create an intense plot conflict that drives the show. They want to show characters changing but they're moving way too fast. Clark's development seemed like a reasonable linear arc, but not a single other character has had a good development cycle. Jaha is just ridiculous, he's lucky that he is playing a big role soon. Cain is different now that he's out of power so he can be a dick or be smart whenever he wants. I guess Bellamy is good because he's always doing work while everyone else is fucking around with their morals.  I feel like the writers are sitting there brainstorming, then come up with sick good ideas so Fast that they start throwing in random shit to transition from point a to b. ""We need to address Monty and Jasper's relationship""...""ok you've got 6 seconds, so let's just have jasper complain and have Monty say ""sorry""."

Even if there were some bumps in the road early on, overall, it seems like this team of writers has no interest in writing dumb characters for the sake of plot like a lot of TV. They're all so likable. Those moments where their interactions feel real and genuine, like Bellamy and Clarke talking about having a drink or Clarke telling Raven she'd pick her first...I don't know, it's hard to sum up, but I'm just so thankful that there's something real about all of these characters.  Anyway, this was another solid episode. That's what was great about season 1 as it progressed - it got harder and harder to find flaws.  One thing I worry is that I don't remember Abby's survival ever being explained. She was still inside that ship, as far as we knew, in this episode. I don't remember the last episode explaining where the heck she ended up. Hope it does. Don't want to say there's a real plot hole in this great show."

Also, I've been making friends the wrong way. brb, heading to the spear store. I don't know why, but that little flash when Raven was asking why everyone kept asking if she knew what she was doing was a little cute. As is the probability she got a low grade in Chemistry.

Random Zero-G mech doing backflips. Man. Imagine what would happen if Sydney reached the Ground. Pretty sure the 100, Mountain Men, and Grounders would team up to take her down. Seriously though. You think Kane was a dick on his first day down? Imagine Sydney. At least Kane realizes what's what. Sydney is evil all the way through. She's chill with killing people when things don't go her way. That says a lot. Also. Her men are incompetent. ""Search all the decks"" no one moves Meanwhile Abby's ten feet away barely even hidden. ANYA!!! Or should I say Jiaying? Dichen Lachman plays an amazing villain. Little bonus for you AoS fans out there. I still think Mt. Weather incited the war. Those flares would only drop down after all their fuel was spent. No burny burny. Lexa was probably speaking of the last major missile launch, the one during Granpa Wally's time as president.  Or you know...Anya probably lied to get her people to rally together and defend themselves and their homeland. Wink wink, AoS fans. Oh the Ark Princess has an effect alright. Isn't that right, Lexa? Did Anya get shot in the shoulder or did she shoot herself in the shoulder and said the 100 shot her? Okay, enough with these AoS references. In all seriousness, that was actually a pretty good shot from Bellamy's distance and angle. I also believe that the Exodus failure was half MM and half Sydney's fault. Not the Mountain Men entirely. Besides, if the 100 knew who was on board, they probably would care less. Trust doesn't work like that Finn. Best Unity Day ever."

You harvest from them, flush your system with theirs, resulting in a supposed instant immunity to the radiation currently blanketing the earth. In turn your children will be born with that same radiation immunity - ensuring you and yours survives on the surface indefinitely.  Longer: Show science aside yes, astronauts experience radiation while in space; not just solar either - there's a whole number of different ones they experience while up there.   This show plays on that idea that, over the past 300 years, children of the original space station survivors built a resistance up to it and as such do not experience the same seriously negative side effects that radiation causes - both in space and on the ground (somehow????).  The mountain men know that eventually, they will have to return to the surface. Their food stores cannot be infinite. Whether or not they ever intended to return permanently was unknown. Harvesting from grounders originally was giving them the ability to return to the surface for small periods of time - or at least heal the wounds of those exposed to the surface. But was not a permanent solution to a very real problem.  Why would you mix it into your gene pool - that would take another 300 years alone to ensure their ""mixed people"" had the correct immunisation. They would still spend another 300 years underground. Their quickest solution was to harvest the immunity, flood their people with it, and return to the surface - breeding it out of themselves that way.  The science behind the idea is dicky. And a lot of it is obviously just sci-fi hope. But yea. I'm writing this on a phone at work, hope it makes sense lmao.  Second tl;dr: the grounders aren't immune to radiation (you can see by their deformations that are born); the same way that the sky crew is."
The100,36c0rr,slytherkain,5,Mon May 18 06:52:18 2015 UTC,They've been in space 97 years I think?
The100,36c0rr,Amonette2012,4,Mon May 18 11:46:03 2015 UTC,97? I thought at the very beginning it said 300 christ i fucked up I been watching this show thinking it was 300 this entire time now every theory I had about it has been flipped on it's head.
The100,36c0rr,slytherkain,5,Mon May 18 12:51:59 2015 UTC,They really should have made it linger than the books if anything.   97 years is no way near enough time for the world to have devolved into its state. And for grounders to have established an entirely new language derived from english.  I'm hoping that they find out that they were being lied to on the ark and much more time has passed than they thought. Their ancestors told them less time had passed to instill hope that the world would become better or something
The100,36c0rr,Mattyx6427,2,Tue May 19 00:08:38 2015 UTC,"Cage says something about the mountain men's door hasn't been breached in 97 years as well. So it would seem odd for both the Ark and the mountain men to come up with the same time frame if it wasn't true.   Also I could see the grounders coming up with a ""new""  language.  It could be a creole language that developed"
The100,36c0rr,spsseano,1 point,Wed May 20 07:50:32 2015 UTC,"the issue w/ the language is - English seems to have all but died out except among the strongest in the clans, the highest ranking warriors and leaders etc. which is such BS for 97 years. the original bomb generation (those that survived) would have taught their children english, (second gen, Lexa's parents), who MAYBE would have started to pick up and make the creole language. Lexa herself would still only be new to it, and so much English would still be a thing."
The100,36c0rr,slytherkain,1 point,Thu May 21 09:52:05 2015 UTC,"Ahh, i thought almost everyone spoke english as like a second language. What you'r saying makes more sense.  I pictured the creole developing between people who never spoke english and english speakers. Like people in Chinatown and little Italy have to start communicating so the creole develops.  But 97 years is a really short time for that to come about."

The100,36c0rr,Furchuck,2,Mon May 18 18:19:30 2015 UTC,did..did you miss the part where I say the science behind the show is all kinds of funny? you don't suddenly get radiation immunity from flooding your system with someone's marrow. the idea is they are able to return to the surface > their current children are given the immunisation too > those children now constantly exposed to radiation naturally over time develop their own immunity > that passes on to the future gen.
The100,36c0rr,slytherkain,-1,Mon May 18 19:41:34 2015 UTC,"I just finished season 2.  This show has so many plot holes I want to bang my head on a wall every time I see the rave reviews it gets.  If the mountain men wanted blood marrow, why not release the 47 kids in good faith and begin trading with the Sky People?  You know... form an alliance.  Ask for marrow donations over time.  Also the mountain men grew their own food in a hydroponics bay.  So their food was technically ""infinite"", as was their energy source."
The100,36c0rr,sonicmerlin,2,Thu May 21 07:46:00 2015 UTC,"ill answer ur plotholes here  1) they said they required a ridiculous amount of marrow - enough that the amount they'd extract would kill the person just to make on vial of stuff to cure one person. so returning the kids would do nothing - they knew that. so they just killed what sky people they could get their hands on.  2) infinite so long as their underground life was stable - as we learn its not. they strive for the surface, they have to capture grounders to keep living. and moreover, a population boom would kill them underground. everything had to have been regulated - not so on the surface. their crops could grow more freely; and their people could live easier, less restricted lives.  there are plenty of potholes dont get me wrong. so so many. like why tf in the show has only 97 years passed? the world aint going to be looking like after 97 years - or the people acting like that (their own language etc????? without ANY of these people except those higher ranking knowing english? lol nah). which is why i originally had thought 3 generations == 300 years. which is far more plausible."
The100,36c0rr,slytherkain,1 point,Thu May 21 09:50:03 2015 UTC,"They needed so much marrow from each kid b/c there were only 47 of them compared to hundreds in the mountain.  Dr. Tsing said they could extract 8 doses of marrow from a person before dying.  Except there are hundreds in the Sky People camp.  The MM have been surrounded by primitive savages for decades and suddenly a group of people comes from space with a similar culture and level of technology.  They have something you desperately want.  Alliance is by far the most logical option, instead of making another dangerous enemy by inhumanely drilling their kids to death.  The plot was just silly. Their underground life was stable.  Even with (non violent) dissenters they were running a democratic society for 97 years.  Population booms don't happen in a regulated society.  And they weren't as susceptible to resource limits as the Ark was.  There were no oxygen limits and they could apparently manufacture drugs (the red stuff for Reapers) and medicine.  They had limitless electricity from that dam.  They were extremely comfortable.  They had cake."
The100,36c0rr,sonicmerlin,1 point,Thu May 21 18:16:26 2015 UTC,"Fairly certain she says that they basically have to suck a person dry to extract enough to make a proper dose of the ""immunity"" for a person. Moreover, marrow extraction is painful and it's the bloodloss itself that would kill the sky people - or risk of infection etc. Reread what I wrote. I never said any of this would happen - it's that it cant happen. They will be regulated for the rest of their existence down there, and all existences after them, if they dont return to the surface ASAP and start trying to breed the immunization into future generations. As we know bone marrow injection wont transfer the immunity to an unborn child, but what being on the surface allows for them to do is starting birthing children and weeding out the ones that come out deformed etc (exactly as the grounders already do). Breeding into their genetic line w/ the sky people would require a great many more years. And making them voluntarily give bone marrow would take almost just as long - especially if you need to suck a person basically dry to get enough to build an injection from it. And some people simply wont give it - especially after finding out they strung people up and forced blood from them."
The100,36c0rr,slytherkain,1 point,Fri May 22 06:49:40 2015 UTC,They said that one person was enough for 8 doses. They needed to suck everyone dry so that they had enough doses to cover everyone.
The100,36c0rr,adamthinks,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:31:47 2015 UTC,"Late to the party:  There is 0 logical sense to the MM bone marrow plan even under the most basic scrutiny of science. THE most logical thing to have done, was for the MM to start a breeding program with the grounders during the first generation living there. Either harvest the eggs from grounder women, or much less palatable rape and impregnate the grounder women.   2nd would be to interbreed with the Sky people, while using marrow donations to allow people to start to move out. Not kill off the donors for one generation to move outside that includes a decent amount of elderly people.  3rd though this is a glaring plot whole for the whole of the show, evolution (even with the help of radiation) takes a HELL of a lot longer than 97 years. Beyond that evolution doesn't actively take place in a living host. So exposure to radiation wouldn't gradually make the current generation increasingly immune. The current generation would have to have babies that were able to survive, while killing off and/or having 99% sterile births.  The whole 2nd 1/2 of MM story arc is completely illogical. In general this show went off the deep end in the later part of the 2nd season in particular in regards to adherence to very basic science..which IMO is the main reason why the TV show  Revolution ultimately failed and was canceled. Were going to use blood transfusions to clean irradiated blood?..Fine, I'll suspend my belief. Were going to genocide our best chance to moving to the surface, start a war with the only technology equivalent (or more advanced) people we have encountered, and we only have 300ish people? When there are a dozen better, and easier options? Nuh uh..I'm fearful of the direction for the 3rd season."
The100,36c0rr,Cwellan,2,Tue Jun 9 05:49:43 2015 UTC,Technically if they are immune to radiation and have not reproduce yet believe the traits from bone marrow can be passed off to their children in the same way that the sky crew develop the natural immunity just by living in solar radiation their children would not have the same benefit but they'd have an they burn up completely when they died when exposed.

The100,36c0rr,KomTrikru,3,Mon May 18 10:22:21 2015 UTC,"This is not the case. In order to have transformed offspring you HAVE to transform the gametes in the germ line. Simply treating with bone marrow won't affect eggs or sperm, it won't be passed down."
The100,36c0rr,Amonette2012,1 point,Mon May 18 11:47:19 2015 UTC,"Similarly, I would think having a bone marrow injection from one of the 100 would only keep the blood itself from being affected by radiation.  Everything else would still be vulnerable.  But, you know, TV show."
The100,36c0rr,TripJammer,2,Mon May 18 18:33:46 2015 UTC,"It's...not very logical. It's actually impossible that it would be any use to anything beyond the current generation. I honestly don't really know what Cage truly thought he was going to achieve, he'd have been better off harvesting the girls' eggs and the boys' sperm and freezing them before taking the bone marrow so that they could have another generation. It's a truly short sighted move.  The only thing I can think of is that perhaps they thought if they could treat all of them and get through another generation the ambient radiation levels might have fallen a bit more."
The100,36c0rr,Amonette2012,3,Mon May 18 11:49:41 2015 UTC,"I think we can all agree that Cage was a terribly impulsive leader with no forethought. Maybe he actually doesn't really care about preserving their people but he just wanted his lifetime to be on the ground? It's easy to shrug something off as ""not your problem"" when you know you'll die before shit hits the fan."
The100,36c0rr,ElenaOcean,2,Mon May 18 12:13:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah Cage was a selfish, arrogant, shortsighted leader, the sort of child who snatches a toy because he just wants it and has no idea what to do with it other than keep it."
The100,36c0rr,Amonette2012,2,Tue May 19 00:08:10 2015 UTC,"Because after 97 years, some people are just sick and tired of living underground and don't really give a fuck about future generations.

The100,36c0rr,Ufgt,1 point,Wed May 20 18:00:09 2015 UTC,i thought it was because the sky people are more stronger and have a better immune system since they actually came through earth from space.

If I'm understanding this correctly, the thing that's wrong is that for the MM's plan to work bonemarrow properties would have to be passed down to babies, and this is not the case in real life?"
The100,36c0rr,jorisimo11,2,Mon May 18 15:16:46 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If you want to genetically transform a mammal, the genes that get changed have to be in the germ line, ie they have to end up in the sperm or eggs. Otherwise it's not passed on."
The100,36c0rr,Amonette2012,2,Tue May 19 00:06:07 2015 UTC,I think the (flawed and stupid) logic was that a fetus growing inside of a women exposed to the radiation of the outside would be better able to survive when born.   But in reality I think even if they were able to make themselves immune to the radiation they would still have a problem with stillbirth. Which I guess would be natural selection because the ones that didn't die would be better suited for survival on the outside.  But everything about their planning doesn't make an scientific sense if you think about it.
The100,36c0rr,Mattyx6427,1 point,Tue May 19 00:15:39 2015 UTC,"The thing is, radiation is generally mutagenic, there's not much you can do to prevent that. Some species that live in the presence of highly mutagenic agents (radiation, chemicals etc) develop mechanisms of checking DNA for errors, so really that's what would need to happen to protect you from the effects of radiation. That would have to happen a) in every cell of your body to prevent cancer, and b) to protect germ line cells from mutations. You could do it, but you'd have to transform the whole population and you'd need to get the germ line cells. Simply sharing out the bone marrow is horribly ineffective in the long run. What they should have done is analysed the 100's DNA to figure out what code sequence had been added to protect them, then working out how to transform their next generation. Something the arc could probably have helped with if they'd just bloody asked instead of being complete and utter dickbags."
The100,369aku,dull_delinquent,4,Sun May 17 12:47:10 2015 UTC,"First of, hi! I'm joining in, admittedly more than two months late. I've been lurking more than I'd like, haha. My survival kit seems to be lacking, but I guess I'll provide... a good work ethic? I'm not going to lie, I'm more of a follower than a leader.  Admittedly, I'm also not American, so I don't quite know what sort of climate we're building for. (fake edit: just googled it, sort of know what climate we're building for. rainy and cold, by the look of it.)  (I am, unfortunately, not that creative, so I will probably be that person who gives random, irritating, but sometimes useful advice. I'll also resign myself to lifting heavy stuff, if that's okay with everyone.)  Phase one: Pre-construction.   Clearing the area. Storms suck, man. My main concern is a) everything is waterlogged, b) hordes of mosquitos c) branches that have been snapped during the storm, and are now hanging precariously, ready to kill.    To fix this, I'll probably grab some people and go scout for some land that is a) nearby and b)not in squelchy-mud-hell. When they find it, we'll get rid of those loose branches.  Phase two: Construction. (not actually a phase, just random ideas.)   Idea one (AKA, 'quick solution'), Leanto inspired housing, something like this but better. My gut's going with a right-angle triangle shape, with the open end facing away from the storm. The advantages of this is mostly that I have a very vague memory of triangles being a strong shape, and rain will roll off, as opposed to pooling.  Idea two: viking inspired longhouses. (AKA,  my long-term dream.) Definitely not as fancy as this one, but I have faith. I want to pretend vikings have a similar climate to where we landed (at least, rainy and cold.) so i trust them. The sloping walls seem safe.    General constructions notes for both house dreams.  I doubt we'll have (enough?) nails to actually hammer planks together, so i feel like Walls will be made of logs fit together, like this. No nails required, hopefully someone has an axe.  Insulation is important, so i'd find leaves and grass and mud, even, and cover the houses walls with it. I hope it's clay-like mud, I really do. Then I'd add a layer of bark (there seems to be a lot of dead tree parts around, funny that.), and potentially build up the ground around it. Hopefully that'll limit the effect of the wind.  If I can think of anything else to add, I'll add it? I'm going to sleep right now, but I hope this has been sort of relevant!"
The100,369aku,aajjjj,2,Sun May 17 15:33:35 2015 UTC,"Great ideas.  Two sugestions for you:   For the leanto shelter, keep both sides sloped, it makes the shelter fare better in wind, and take both sides down nearly to the ground, since you won't be moving stuff in and out nearly as often as one of the ones pictured. The longhouse would be a very long-term project, a few years for something as big as the one in the picture, and still months for one big enough for the 100 teens. Make a basic shelter before starting that one."
The100,369aku,Milo_BOK,1 point,Mon May 18 10:45:08 2015 UTC,"Awesome :) I like the idea of the triangular lean-to style shelters. After all working on a longhouse would take time, you could build a smaller home then work towards the big goal!  Also feel free to give yourself some supplies, just take a look at the original challenge to see what sort of things people came up with."
The100,369aku,Milo_BOK,3,Sun May 17 15:44:40 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm suggesting a Swiss Family Robinson-syle house, something like this. However depending on tools and stuff it might be difficult to build. We'd need a lot of wood + tools. Even if something not quite like this something on the trees could work fine. We'd avoid the risk of flooding from too much groundwater from storms but as pointed out below treetop houses could be blown over from storms.  Not sure how I spent my time yet. Making friends, writing notes, working out how to build the house? That sort of thing. Also suggesting the idea of using pig bladder put inside a leather cover for some fun football/soccer during downtime. If we ever get any or find a pig. Do we have a spare pig?"
The100,369aku,Milo_BOK,2,Sun May 17 13:23:19 2015 UTC,"Just bear in mind that we just had a week long storm that knocked a load of trees over, so building in trees might be a bit risky!"
The100,369aku,ShaneH7646,2,Sun May 17 13:28:49 2015 UTC,"Good point, actually. Although how often are these storms? Frequent? Or not? We could do a 50/50 split if they're not that frequent. Otherwise it's probably best to avoid trees."

The100,369aku,arihadne,2,Sun May 17 13:50:11 2015 UTC,Cool. It might be a good idea to ask the grounders and see what they say. Anyone up for paying them a visit?
The100,369aku,arihadne,3,Sun May 17 13:59:21 2015 UTC,"I think I might just try to improve one off the nearby bunkers as we do not know at this point how often these storms occur,alot of damage was caused by this one, I think I will try to be prepared for next one  Also I think you guys should make the huts as structurally sound as possible just incase it does happen again, maybe use the fallen trees?"
The100,369aku,ElenaOcean,1 point,Sun May 17 14:12:28 2015 UTC,I think you could get some good logs out of them.  Just remember the bunkers might be a bit of a walk from the rest of camp and there might be times when you want to be in the camp for safety reasons. You don't want to get cut off in an emergency.
The100,369aku,arihadne,3,Sun May 17 14:16:34 2015 UTC,"I think I would've used the first few days in the dropship to just rest after all the hard work we've done lately. Then I'd start asking around to see if anyone has anything to read. Maybe I'd ask someone to give me a haircut like Raven did for Finn. Unless we have scissors, did anyone bring scissors?  Anyway, how well would mud houses hold up in a storm? I'm thinking using the biggest chunks of tree trunks we can find as the columns of the house would be a pretty good foundation. Might need some more wood in the walls for extra structural support, but otherwise, there's plenty of mud around and they've served humans well in plenty of other parts of the world throughout time.  Like the water problem, it's again a question of how much work our resources allow us to do. If we're working too hard, we drain whatever food and water survived the storm, and then we have to work that much harder to get it back.  We should go see what we can find at the river, and make sure the storm didn't screw up our rerouting of it."

During the week we were trapped indoors, after rereading my copy of The Iliad, it made me think of the buildings of prehistoric Greece, cyclopean walls, and limestone. We're going to do this like the Minoans.  We’re going to need a pit to fire bricks in. It’s the easiest way and can reach about 1200°C because, if this hurricane’s taught us anything, there’s going to be serious wet weather about. Wood houses are all well and good, but wood shrinks and expands with the damp, so while they’ll be good for a short-term housing solution with the spaces between stuffed with something for insulation, brick housing is probably the best idea. And we’ll need to use a pit kiln until we can manage to make a closed-structure kiln.   As for mud bricks, we’ll want to dry out a bunch of vegetation so we can get the mixture right because figuring out the straw-mud ratio is very important and varies according to the materials used. They’re going to need to dry for nearly a month. Hurray, we have Neolithic technology. We could even start building a ziggurat, and up our game with the lime. Then, the moulded bricks go into the kiln, which is layered with all sorts of combustible matter, which is watched very carefully - is there a thermometer that goes up to about 1000°C? - so that nothing else catches on fire.  The first bricks from this kiln will be used to build a lime kiln so that we can create lime plaster (quicklime from the fire + water) to cover our buildings in because, hey, it’s lasted for thousands of years, it’s good enough for me. Not only that, but the acidic fog will probably do the same thing to lime as acid rain does, so it will dissolve but also automatically repair itself by refilling the cracks. As for getting lime? Congrats, redshirts, you’re going to be hauling bags of crushed rocks from the Lincoln Memorial columns, the Pentagon, the gargoyles of the National Cathedral, and the Holocaust Memorial Museum. We’re great people. Congratulations, we now have c. 1900 BCE technology.  Those dead plants are going to get mulched up to feed their remaining brethren.   Of course, we could shape some large pieces of metal into the curve needed to build a lime kiln into the ground, and another one to cover it up. Also: a bathhouse should be one of our priorities, even if it is just a hut with barrels inside and a fire to heat rocks on. Skaikru Spa Day 2149, here we come."

I went with 'stay near the dropship for now' because a) it's strategically useful and b) we're getting on ok with the neighbors, and c) this is where our folks will know where to find us. Having a sustainable longer term settlement here with a permanent population is not a bad idea. After all we've got stuff to learn from the grounders and they've got stuff to learn from us. However travelling is a good idea, perhaps in a few weeks we could go on an adventure! We can leave the redcoats to watch the huts."
The100,369aku,aajjjj,2,Sun May 17 19:58:54 2015 UTC,"Right, because I think establishing shelters like one closer to the river and also using Shane's bunker will mean we can travel further for supplies and hunting without having to restrict ourselves to getting back by nightfall. Also if we do come under attack we can disperse the group to the hideout shelters.   So I am volunteering to go to the river and find an alcove or cave in the cliff to build a secondary shelter. Also I need to wash my hair because it has ""animal"" blood in it."

The100,3630wo,ElenaOcean,22,Fri May 15 17:53:26 2015 UTC,"The Red Queen has decided that grounders are inferior to sky people. She was programmed to help advance the human race and set off the bombs to destroy a failing society so that only the strongest people would survive. The resulting grounders were only a moderate success; their thirst for blood and their superstition meant that they didn't strive to rebuild the world like RQ hoped, but instead fought among themselves and became feral and illiterate. Sky People are a second chance for RQ to complete her mission, she can wipe out the grounders to make way for the Arkers. - This means that any Arkers that are seemingly ""going native"" will also be eliminated.     Meanwhile, Clarke will stumble on a camp of grounders who at first attack her, but once they remove her stylish new hood, realize that she's Clarke of Ark and they run scared. Clarke's new found infamy does not help her identity crisis, but the longer she is gone, the harder it is to return home...maybe Clarke can even get used to being a free agent with no loyalties?   At camp Jaha, Bellamy is being hailed a hero by the arkers but the remaining 42 lost boys are still waiting for their Wendy to return. Bellamy has to keep lying to them and telling them she'll be back soon, but he has no idea where she is or if she's ever coming back.    Things are also not looking sunny for the grounders. Lexa's failure has meant that the Ice Queen has decided she wants out of the alliance. Everything was fine when they thought Lexa was unstoppable, but now that there is a new Sky Clan with a ruthless and powerful queen, Ice Nation wants in on that action. Side with the new faction, bring the Woods Clan and its allies to their knees, lay claim to Polis and the surrounding area. Only problem is, when they come knocking on the Arkers' door, Clarke ain't home and Abby and Kane have to bluff their way through negotiations while Bellamy is sent off on a recon mission to find Clarke.   But will Clarke want to step back into the role that cost her so much of herself? Will she even give a shit about the end of the world? Or will it be up to Murphy and Bellamy to unplug the AI and melt the Ice Nation's heart with their roguish smiles and rugged handsomeness?"
The100,3630wo,ElenaOcean,9,Fri May 15 19:10:03 2015 UTC,"the remaining 42 lost boys are still waiting for their Wendy to return   Feels!  Also damn, I hope at least some of that happens!"
The100,3630wo,ChiralChupacabra,6,Fri May 15 20:02:14 2015 UTC,"I think if they're serious about character development and don't renege on that, seeing a darker, more selfish Clarke would be truly amazing. Imagine what she could do without having to worry about keeping anyone else safe or having her actions scrutinized by her people. She's been through a lot, been betrayed every time she's tried to trust someone, and had very little support emotionally for all the hard decisions she's made and now she's totally alone. That's like, the perfect storm to turn her into the darkest character on the show. She could be the antithesis of Bellamy's new found hero status...maybe she even becomes his antagonist when she refuses to come back and help.  In their world, the only difference between a hero and a villain at this point is whether you're doing terrible things for others or just to save yourself."

Maybe since she's going out into the woods to find herself, she may take this approach and truly only look out for herself. Then when she eventually gets back to Camp Jaha for whatever reason Abby sees what she's become and tries to coax her back from the brink."
The100,3630wo,ElenaOcean,2,Tue May 19 06:53:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Clarke would be truly dangerous without her compassion for other people. It'd be a nice twist to see her embrace the dark side a little and live up to Lincoln's ""we've all got monsters inside us"". I wanna see her fight back the next time Raven or Octavia yells at her for not saving them fast enough or her mom complains about her not being a good person. Maybe she takes up knife throwing while she's gone too."

So hopefully there's some solid back story on that too. Honestly, Jason better take advantage of this crappy situation to make something even better than S2. Like a whole season where you cannot pick a favorite episode. I hope they start up some running gags too. All good shows have in-jokes."

The100,3630wo,queenbellevue,1 point,Sat May 16 01:04:41 2015 UTC,":P thanks! I was reading the official S3 synopsis and got a little carried away. Here's the one they actually released:   “THE 100”  For two seasons, the refugees of The 100 sent to Earth have been at war. First with themselves, then with the Grounders, and finally with Mount Weather. Many have lost their lives along the way. All have lost their innocence. They have learned the hard way that in the fight for survival, there are no heroes and no villains. There is only the living and the dead. But now the war is over. The battle against Mount Weather has been won. The prisoners have returned home to a world seemingly at peace, but can they find peace within themselves after what they had to do to escape? And is there more to life than just surviving? Unfortunately, their newfound sense of normalcy will be short-lived, and their lives will be changed forever, as threats both old and new test their loyalties, push them past their limits, and make them question what it truly means to be human. First, they fought to survive. Then, they fought for their friends. Now, they will fight for the human race."
The100,3630wo,ElenaOcean,2,Sat May 16 10:09:07 2015 UTC,Haha yeah I read it on tumblr. Yours sound wayyyy better. I feel like the writers probably haven't fully fleshed out the plot to S3 yet so they're keeping it purposely vague
The100,3630wo,Jay013,1 point,Sat May 16 12:53:17 2015 UTC,"I agree yeah, it sounds like maybe it was written before they started planning S3 properly so it's all very generic and vague ""end of the world/fate of humanity"" stuff. I'm not a huge fan of it when they're still writing/deciding the end of the season as it's being filmed and aired because it sometimes feels sort of inconsistent in pace and plot, so I am hoping that the good thing that comes out of this longer hiatus is a truly solid story with no stalling or weird time skips where we miss vital reactions. Not that S2 wasn't phenomenal, but I love it when each episode really propels things forward and I think they could nail that in S3."

The100,3630wo,ChiralChupacabra,13,Sun May 17 10:54:33 2015 UTC,"The only reason we're getting a mid-season slot is because we're finally getting the winter season we've wanted. Winter's been coming. Everyone's rushing to prepare. We know the kids were doing it before the whole war thing went on. Everyone out there is trying to survive for the upcoming winter. Clarke doesn't have the Grounder's knowledge of the land, nor the technology of the Arkers. In her struggle to survive the frozen north eastern seaboard, she runs across some Azgeda. Hearing about her conquest and separation from Lexa, the Ice Nation takes her in, helps her survive the winter. I.Q (Ice Queen) talks to her about an alliance distinct from the one with Lexa. Of course, with the Grounder's attraction for power, this just causes IQ to fawn over another one of Lexa's lovers. Cue conflict.  Of course, Clarke will be a total shut-down until she either realizes what she can be, or accepts what she already is.  Meanwhile, party at Murphy's"

I'd love to see some wintery stuff, and I'm guessing that travelling to the southern hemisphere would be damned expensive. But yeah, we've had a definite ice nation setup, it would be sensible to allow for a winter to happen to film it."
The100,3630wo,AmityN7,0,Sat May 16 15:00:27 2015 UTC,'winter is coming' while  a great idea is over represented the plot. In Game of Thrones how does an idea I don't think to science fiction / fantasy shows should be trying to do the same thing at the same time. Isn't that one of the reasons why that Stargate Universe failed because It was trying to be so much like Battlestar Galactica?  otherwise I fully support your idea and think it would be an awesome thing just you know I don't want shows copying each other
The100,3630wo,Nathanielsan,2,Sun May 17 11:07:55 2015 UTC,"A winter plot line has been opened up back in Season 1's Day Trip, but put aside due to, well, war. It really isn't over-represented either. It's just the usual plot of The 100 with the added difficulty of snow and cold. The two shows wouldn't be doing the same thing as the rules and plots of each show has it's own formula.  And, it really isn't the same vibe as GoT. Not by a long shot. Then again, I'm a bit biased since I found Game of Thrones boring."

The100,3630wo,Bond4141,7,Mon Jun 22 10:54:44 2015 UTC,"Not much, but I would REALLY like to see Mount Weather turn into a UN of grounder organisations. They still have missiles as a deterrent, it's huge, and open spaces can be used as a market/bazzar. Secure, so in the case of an attack, everyone is safe. Also, the communications equipment would be a great hub for all the clans to know what's going on.   The leader, or a emissary of each clan gets a position on a council, that votes on shit that needs to get done. All clans that are powerful enough to call themselves a clan get a seat. I see the mutants teased in earlier episodes won't get a seat, and will become the terrorists.   ALIE and Jaha will be fucking shit up behind the scenes, maybe arming the new terrorist organization. Murphy's just going to chill and have fun. Until eventually being thrown around a bit more.   Raven will probably get beaten up again, as she tends to be great at that. Clark will be off becoming more grounderlike. Maybe even befriending some of the mutants, and will try to become a neutral 3rd party to appeal to the council that the mutants should get a say in shit.  All that probably won't happen. But one thing is for sure. Clark will be fucking PTSD central."

The Sky People will get rid of the position of chancellor, and instead rely on the guidance of several different people with expertise in important areas, like Abby in medicine. These people will form a council that makes the big decisions.  The Grounders will try to go back to life as usual, but they aren't a hive mind. Some of them will not like that they retreated from battle, or that they abandoned the Sky People. They will hear what Clarke accomplished. Indra is always willing to question Lexa. Tondc being destroyed will require some Grounders to find new homes, especially with winter coming.  Both factions will want to salvage whatever they can from Mount Weather, which is not only how they will cross paths again, but how the Grounders will finally be splintered. Some will be willing to go to war with the Sky People over the mountain, others will resist. Lexa will be against it. Ultimately, I think the Grounders may end up crippled in some way throughout season 3, and the Sky People will be the ones with the upper hand. Where that leads...I haven't though that far ahead, yet."

This is just one of those shows that has so much to offer but need people to know about it. Getting passed those first few episode seems to be the hard part for some.

Since the 100 airs on Canadian netflix the day after each episode airs pretty much every person I hang out with watches it. So if they did that for Americans (every country really) then yeah they'll definitely get a huge amount of viewers. It kind of really pisses me off that they don't already do this for American netflix. Let's face it - the 'Muricans bring the viewers. Plus canada doesn't have many people living in it, we're already watching the show a ton and I'm having a hard time finding people to recommend it to since it's popular where I live :s Frakking CW. Why did THIS network pick up such a beautiful show? They don't know how to advertise for it, they give it a terrible slot, and frankly it's not the most respected network.

Because the content being distributed through Netflix ends up in a market it wasn't allowed to reach. And even worse, you're making Netflix complicit in it.   The boosting of the views doesn't go unnoticed and adds risk when deciding to act on the Netflix numbers.  Don't involve Netflix in that filth, it doesn't help. And probably hurts if you guys keep telling everyone to use Hola."

So instead of stealing a service's bandwidth, and poisoning their viewership numbers. Either wait and watch it on Netflix/DVD. Or go pirate it and sit in a corner and hate yourself for this terrible lack of willpower.

The100,35z7d2,Therearefour-lights,2,Fri May 15 17:55:36 2015 UTC,"Well if they put it together with Arrow/Flash/Legends of Tomorrow there should be a good boost in viewership, instead of starting in October and having a lot of breaks because of fewer episodes per season."
The100,35z7d2,azies,6,Fri May 15 15:13:51 2015 UTC,"This is like planning to ""go viral."" Every company in the world wants to do ""make a viral video"" (few succeed), but to purposefully halt momentum in hopes that people will passively trip onto your series on Netflix--especially when only 1 season is up in the USA--is just PR spin to me.  The 100 is a kickass show that is underperforming because it's target market doesn't take the CW seriously. If it was on a cable network where people look for shows like this, it would be connecting more.   I love, love, love this show, but I hate, hate, hate this strategy. This show needs momentum more than it needs a year hiatus. It also needs for season 2 to be put up Netflix in the USA so this diabolical master plan of passively capturing viewers who are willing to give a new show a go on Netflix, with next to no marketing support pushing for people to check it out.  I could rant for hours, but I won't. I'll just repeat that I hate this. As a former PR person, if I pitched this to my boss, I'd be fired."
The100,35z7d2,VGBAMF,2,Thu May 14 21:49:59 2015 UTC,"Well it worked. I have seen teasers for a long time as a TWD/Originals/Flash/Arrow viewer, but never gave it a shot. I have heard and read positive things but never really gave it a shot. One thing i consistently heard was ""the first few episodes are hard to get through, but once you get through them the show gets good"".   Well i was bored 2-3 days ago and saw it on Netflix, i watched the first season, and then watched the second (not yet on netflix). They were right. I am a fan and will watch it when S03 premiers.   I'll say this, this show does deserve a big audience. Yeah its got that CW twist (love triangles, lots of love stories, some melodrama, making the adults idiots and the kids badasses and smart) but not as much as some other CW shows.   I'd say they shot themselves in the foot making the first few episodes so kid/teeny with their music selection and big doses of melodrama...that will stop a bunch of viewers from continuing to watch i would imagine. But whats done is done."
The100,35z7d2,M3rc_Nate,2,Fri May 15 11:48:31 2015 UTC,"Well, Netflix was how I found it in the first place.  I was randomly on canadian netflix autumn last year looking for a good TV show to watch and I noticed the 100. I finished the first season within twelve hours :)"
The100,35z7d2,0thatguy,1 point,Sat May 16 04:47:20 2015 UTC,"While the move to mid-season infuriates me and this Netflix reason seem like a rather ineffectual attempt to comfort fans, I do think that this might be their true hope.  When season 1 popped up on Netflix, it was consistently in the Popular section and tweets about the show jumped significantly in those first few months. Hopefully the show can gain more awareness and a bigger fanbase to ensure its survival. I am no where near ready to say goodbye to Clarke and co."
The100,35z7d2,thecrazedy,1 point,Tue May 26 07:39:24 2015 UTC,"Having it on Netflix definitely makes it a lot easier to chain watch. I've only seen one episode streamed from US tv and I was kind of amazed how many adverts you guys have, it totally ruined the episode for me as I was so used to seeing it as one block without interruptions. I think seeing it in the Netflix format makes it way more compelling."
The100,35z7d2,Amonette2012,1 point,Fri May 15 19:37:26 2015 UTC,"Because Mad Men's viewership numbers have doubled since following the Breaking Bad model. /s  Joking aside, the midseason scheduling for The 100, as much as I hate waiting that much longer, is the smart, pragmatic move for The CW--but not because it may net Netflix viewers. The 100 isn't a ratings hit like The Flash, it's not getting nearly the amount of critical praise Jane the Virgin is getting (though, in season two the former has dropped consistently and the latter has momentum on its side), and Jason Rothenberg, as talented as he is, is no Rob Thomas. The CW already has a full schedule, but they do need to air new shows in hopes of adding another breakout hit to the network's schedule. Slotting The 100 in midseason allows them that while easing the pressure on average ratings performer.  And anyway, just the fact that The 100 got a third season is excellent because, barring some ratings disaster, a fourth season is almost guaranteed if only for the sake of syndication revenue (which is most certainly why ABC renewed Nashville despite similarly sagging ratings. That and the song sales revenue)."

That's for series that have around 22 - 25 episodes per season though as that gets close to 100 episodes overall and allows reruns to air one episode each week day for 20 weeks without repeating.   Since The 100 has shorter seasons than that I really don't think a fourth season is guaranteed even though I would love for that to be the case."

The outfits and makeup were a lot of fun to make.   And yes! You're right about the gas mask. I haggled the cashier down from $80 at Value Village and used a 30% off coupon once the price was reduced. I ended up getting a real gas mask (came with someone's name etched into the band so I'm assuming it was actually used in one of the wars) for about $30.

The100,364qow,Shotokanguy,6,Sat May 16 03:28:15 2015 UTC,"Interesting observation. Right wing tends to be harsher and more survivalist in many cases, so it kind of makes sense. There's less space for traditionally left wing values in a survivalist situation. It's more life or death, and more capitalist.  Edit: also a Brit and I do see what you mean, especially in light of our current political situation."
The100,364qow,Amonette2012,11,Sat May 16 03:49:49 2015 UTC,Exactly. Morality is a privilege that comes with civilization.
The100,364qow,SecondClass-,-2,Sat May 16 05:06:17 2015 UTC,No it isn't. Morality is what makes civilization possible.
The100,364qow,squak_more,5,Sat May 16 10:29:08 2015 UTC,Not really. Civilization has never been particularly moral in and of itself. It's more about the mutual convenience of not killing each other for food. Morality is something that grows out of that. You can have totally amoral civilizations.
The100,364qow,Amonette2012,0,Sat May 16 14:15:06 2015 UTC,"Sort of correct, but civilization NECESSITATES internal morality. That is a convenience, and is therefore selected for in the grand scheme of evolution. Note that I said internal morality; you can feel free to be a dick to people outside of your society."
The100,364qow,squak_more,4,Sat May 16 14:25:51 2015 UTC,"Sorry but I can't agree with that. Civilization absolutely doesn't necessitate morality. It's entirely possible to have a completely amoral society that becomes no more moral as time goes  on. Civilization is really just one step up from the wolf pack, a way for people to protect themselves as a group.  Just look at the mountain. Perfectly civilized, completely brutal, no compunction about slaughtering their own for merely disagreeing with the fact that children from another civilization should be slaughtered. Also happy to send a girl out to see how long she survived in the wild before succumbing to radiation sickness. Whereas the grounders are more barbaric in their morality but do have a definite sense of it internally. Civilization often paves the way and allows for morality, but it in no way necessitates it. Morality tends to come more from the direction of religion in most societies. Know why 'thou shalt not kill' is in the ten commandments? Because it's far enough outside human nature that it's not actually obvious, you have to tell people not to kill each other. Morality is against our animal nature, that's why it doesn't tend to evolve on its own without a few excessively enlightened people helping it along. It's not a pack instinct.  Edit: that's also not really how evolution works. It's survival of the fittest, not survival of the kindest."
The100,364qow,Amonette2012,-1,Sat May 16 14:44:43 2015 UTC,"Civilization is really just one step up from the wolf pack, a way for people to protect themselves as a group.   Morality necessitates that you have at least some rules, otherwise a group would be untenable.   Just look at the mountain. Perfectly civilized, completely brutal, no compunction about slaughtering their own for merely disagreeing with the fact that children from another civilization should be slaughtered.   Having a morality you disagree with doesn't mean they don't have a morality altogether. They're barbaric by your standards but their own rules are perfectly consistent."
The100,364qow,squak_more,2,Sat May 16 15:16:37 2015 UTC,I think you're confusing the meaning of morality here. It's possible to have rules without them being moral.
The100,364qow,Amonette2012,-1,Sat May 16 15:23:52 2015 UTC,"No, it's not. Rules without basis in anything other than ""This is the right thing to do"" ARE morality."
The100,364qow,squak_more,1 point,Sat May 16 15:24:40 2015 UTC,"Interesting point, but ultimately not that relevant here. Morality is to do with right and wrong. Rules are not necessarily tuned this way. It is entirely possible to have a ruleset that is aligned towards group survival rather than right and wrong, which is exactly what both the mountain and the arc did. The idea of throwing someone out of an airlock for stealing food is fundamentally immoral, however it was utterly necessary to do this for the arc to survive. The rule is about survival not right and wrong, which really didn't enter into it much at all. Privately many people may have FELT the rule was immoral - after all a society can be more moral than the rules it must live by to survive and make a choice to pick survival over morality."
The100,364qow,Amonette2012,1 point,Sat May 16 15:31:03 2015 UTC,"Without civilization, it's every man for himself. You don't work as a doctor and then make enough money to buy shelter, food, and water. You have to get that shelter, food, and water yourself. And in a survival situation, what are you going to be more concerned with - doing the right thing, or just staying alive?"
The100,364qow,SecondClass-,2,Sat May 16 21:54:38 2015 UTC,"Just thinking about it now I'd say it's more left wing. The leaders are the ones who hold most of the power and provide for everyone else. Right wingers tend to want the central government to have less power over them, while the Left tends to want it to have more power."
The100,364qow,Starrystars,2,Sat May 16 03:51:46 2015 UTC,"This is very much a show about war-or rather, about conflict. From the beginning, we saw a society in a struggle against itself, and that crux of conflict has become more outwardly focused. Now, we have a real war against outsiders, and the attitudes and behaviors traditionally associated with the American right produce far more compelling television than those associated with the American left. Additionally, leftist values are at their strongest and most viable in a prosperous society, so the Clarkes' potential rightward pull follows naturally from the survivalist situation that they are in."

The thing about good story telling is that it helps us all understand the world and our situations better. So if you look at The 100 and see politics, then that's valid. I don't think those are the metaphors and archetypes the creators are going for, but if that's what you see, then roll with it and see what it has to show you."

The100,3602cv,JohnnyReeko,15,Thu May 14 23:19:01 2015 UTC,"I think the rationality is simply that they didn't want their friend to die. This was the Arkers first real encounter with the savage-ness of the Grounders (aside from the Dropship War which was really more chaotic savage-ness than the organized exectution savage-ness) and I think they were just trying to deny that a) Finn deserved to die, and b) they were out of options."
The100,3602cv,WhoseRiverIsItAnyway,1 point,Thu May 14 23:45:29 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call it savageness. If your friend went into a school tomorrow and performed a massacre killing innocent people would you be defending him or would you think he deserved the harshest punishment?

The100,3602cv,Amonette2012,6,Sat May 16 16:25:23 2015 UTC,It's surprising how much stronger feelings can be in real situations. I think that's another theme of The 100 really - dealing with the horrible situations they end up in and the emotions that follow them.

Instead of defending his life while at the same time condemning his actions they pretended like what he did was a fine thing to do. That was my issue.

The100,3602cv,Nathanielsan,7,Sat May 16 08:10:16 2015 UTC,"First of all: They're teenagers.  Second of all: They're friends. Third of all: None of them were there at the shooting, so what Finn did isn't real to them.  Fourth: It's the instinct of all of us to hide from consequences. Fifth: Denial is strong. Sixth: None of the Ark kids are warriors, yet the grounders had been willing enough to mow them down without a second thought. How is that so different in these kids minds than what the grounders did to them in S1? They were kids just trying to survive when these trained warriors decided to wipe them out without so much as a conversation. Without a ring of fire, each one of those untrained and civilian kids would be dead, and no grounder would think twice about it.  So isn't amazingly hypocritical of the grounders to be so offended at what Finn did? They were at war--a war the grounders started. The grounders attacked the dropship. They brought the war to where the kids lived, then get incensed when one of their own towns has unforeseen casualties?  How many kids did the grounders kill in their initial attack before the rocket fire? The grounders are boohooing over 18, but they've definitely killed that many civilian children/minors themselves.  So, for me, I get why Finn's friends had his back. They were at war, and half the people who dropped down in that drop ship a month before were now dead, most by grounder hands. So, yeah, ZERO pity from me for the grounders crying foul for 18 dead in one of their own towns that wasn't expecting an attack.  If you start a war, you can't pick and choose your casualties. That's what I would have said if I had been in Clarke's shoes meeting Lexa for the first time (words which probably would have gotten me killed and the show would be done, so I guess we can all be glad I'm not Clarke)."

If you were one of those teenagers, and you had developed a strong bond with the others as Grounders terrorized you all...and then you didn't actually see what lead to Finn killing all of those Grounders? You would have a very skewed view of things. Finn was their friend, and no matter how clear to us it is that he did something deserving of punishment, in reality, the idea of simply giving up a friend to die should be much harder to process."
The100,3602cv,algebraicAT333,6,Fri May 15 01:03:06 2015 UTC,"yeah I think people seem to forget that. It's easy for us to say we'd make the right call because we have a week in between each event to discuss it. But I call bullshit on anyone who says they would give up their friend to be brutally tortured, especially if that person clearly had some form of PTSD. Execution is one thing, but revenge and justice aren't the same thing and breeding more violence from a violent act kinda negates the punishment of it."
The100,3602cv,SecondClass-,3,Fri May 15 07:21:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. As the audience we see how all those events play out and it's heavily edited. In the case of Raven for example, she hasn't seen anything that happened in that village. All she knows is that Murphy has been a real asshole and even shot her and from her point of view it makes a lot of sense to just send him instead of Finn. For us, it makes no sense because we have seen everything that happened, we have seen their faces and expressions in slow motion."
The100,3602cv,rookie-mistake,6,Sat May 16 19:06:18 2015 UTC,"I'm one of the apparently very few on this sub who has a lot of sympathy for Finn, so you probably don't want to hear from me.  Finn had a mental breakdown and shot Grounders like he was shooting enemies. It's of course not condonable, but he didn't do it out of maliciousness, but fear and desparation. Why everyone constantly cries out for him to die in the worst way possible is beyond me, because I loved him as a character throughout the whole show. His line of ""I found you"" is one of the best and most chilling ones of the entire series. It explains so much of what drove him to that point.  And in a plot sense, it makes sense that The 100 would be so quick to forgive and defend him. What he did was atrocious, but he was still one of them, and they weren't going to just hand him over to get mutilated and tortured. It may have satisfied this weird bloodlust everyone has, but it would be extremely out of character for the other characters."
The100,3602cv,rookie-mistake,6,Fri May 15 01:06:35 2015 UTC,"I agree, I'm definitely not a Finn hater. I actually really loved his character, especially in season 1, and grateful the writers chose at least one character to suffer from PTSD from the war. I didn't like how every one of the 100 either witnessed someone die, or killed someone, and no one seemed to be bothered by it."
The100,3602cv,rookie-mistake,3,Fri May 15 01:43:13 2015 UTC,"Sure, Finn was one of them. I can imagine them forgiving him eventually. However, when the grounders are threatening to kill your entire camp unless you hand over ONE person, the completely sensible thing to do would be to HAND HIM OVER.  This wasn't a matter of whether people think Finn deserved it. But okay, let's say Finn DOESN'T deserve it. Lexa offers the sky people the chance to put Finn on trial. EVEN THEN, when they have complete control over what happens to Finn, Clarke wants to find another way. Everybody but Murphy and Jaha acted irrational and put the lives of every single person in that camp at risk.  Not to mention their blatant arrogance over Murphy. ""You didn't try hard enough."" ""Finn wasn't the only one at the village."" Seriously, Raven was ridiculous this episode. She thought that the grounders wouldn't recognize that Finn was the one who shot the grounders, even though Nyko immediately attacked Finn when he saw him in the dropship.  The point is, giving up Finn was the only reasonable course of action, but nearly every single character (including Abby, who hardly knew Finn) acted extremely selfish."
The100,3602cv,SecondClass-,2,Fri May 15 01:46:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not defending Raven or Abby here - I agree that the more pragmatic thing to do would be to hand him over. Jaha and Kane were fully on board with that, because it fits with the ""doing what has to be done for the greater good"" Arker mindset. I'm just saying that Finn wasn't some morally unforgivable character who deserved to die."
The100,3602cv,rookie-mistake,1 point,Fri May 15 02:03:25 2015 UTC,"Killing an unarmed prisoner and then massacring a village is completely unforgivable. I'd say he deserved death, at the very least the grounders deserved their revenge."

The100,3602cv,Amonette2012,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:23:47 2015 UTC,A guy goes into a school and herds a group of children into a room and points a gun at them. They are all scared and one tries to escape. The guy with the gun shoots and kills the child. The rest of the children panic and the shooter massacres them.  Do you -   A) Defend the shooter and blame the children for trying to escape.  B) Condemn the shooter and view his actions as evil and unforgivable.
The100,3602cv,CoffeePops,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:39:19 2015 UTC,"Uh, is this a wasteland and have the children been killing members of the small colony the shooter is trying to survive with?  thats a bad analogy man, this is more like children managing to catch a clan of your shooters unawares. grounders are the furthest thing from harmless"
The100,3602cv,SecondClass-,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:56:04 2015 UTC,Okay change the scenario slightly so it's a western soldier taking prisoner and then killing children and elderly Iraqi civilians (most of the grounders there weren't warriors)  At the end of the day dude was a cunt and killed innocent people.
The100,3602cv,DealWithItBish,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:04:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah... it's an armed conflict though. That scenario has happened plenty of times in Iraq and otherwise and no, I wouldn't call a soldier in that position a cunt.  You're acting like he was firing willy nilly into the pen but its really not that black and white. If he just started shooting them without any catalyst I'd be on your side but you know they are capable of killing and you have no idea what they are going to do or where they're sprinting. Its a complicated situation"
The100,3602cv,SecondClass-,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:10:46 2015 UTC,Nothing is unforgivable if you're seeking forgiveness.
The100,3602cv,leeah,1 point,Fri May 15 21:41:32 2015 UTC,i know i'm late to this but i'm confused. why isn't the fact that they were trying to escape / running at him justification enough? i'm not fully caught up but i read the wiki
The100,3602cv,Jay013,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:24:21 2015 UTC,I completely disagree.   You can't just use the word sorry as a get out of jail free card. There are consequences to actions and depending on how severe they can last a life time.   Taking another persons life in cold blood in unforgivable.
The100,3602cv,CheekySprite,2,Fri May 15 22:44:40 2015 UTC,"Then we're at an impasse. One of the main themes of the show is forgiveness. While Finn may be a murderer, and it was no doubt a terrible act, it was an understandable one due to his immense PTSD and mental decay. I'm not saying they shouldn't have handed him over - it was really the only way to have a chance against Mt. Weather - but just that, had the circumstances been different, Finn's crime definitely could warrant forgiveness if he worked hard enough for it."
The100,3602cv,psivenn,0,Fri May 15 23:31:38 2015 UTC,Let me ask you - If I went into your house and murdered your whole family for no reason what would it take for you to forgive me?  For me it would of course be absolutely nothing.
The100,3602cv,KomTrikru,3,Fri May 15 23:33:26 2015 UTC,We're essentially talking about severe PTSD here. If this was brought to trial in a modern court its likely he would be ruled to have diminished responsibility as a result of his mental state. Like soldiers who go nuts in iraq and end up shooting a room full of civilians because all they can see are enemies and soldiers. It's something that unfortunately happens when people's minds break as a result of extreme stress and conflict. Once someone is in a position where their mental state is having a severe effect on their actions we see them as being ill rather than evil because essentially they are. Finn's massacre of the grounders isn't the same as a cold blooded mass execution. People can empathize with him because he's lost his mind and done something he doesn't even quite understand.
The100,3602cv,esp01r09,2,Sat May 16 15:17:20 2015 UTC,"people with PTSD and other mental disabilities frequently get the death penalty or large prison sentences (30 years or life). Mercy for massacres is certainly not given most of the time and the times when they are are very controversial. I will agree, however, that torturing him was uncalled for and unjustifiable. Finn may have had PTSD and I can eympathize with that and feel for him (as I have PTSD  and before receiving help had been prone to violent, thought not lethal, outbursts when triggered) but if that is going to put him at risk of killing innocent people then he either needs intensive care/help (which given the circumstances most of these people are in is not exactly feasible) or to be put down or locked up.  All that being said. There are plenty of people with severe PTSD who don't manage to massacre innocent people."
The100,3602cv,AdrienI,2,Sat May 23 05:13:12 2015 UTC,"I probably wouldn't. But this isn't from the point of view of me (the Grounders), it's from your friends (the 100). Your friends could definitely forgive you for it if it was obviously done while you were having a complete mental breakdown and you repented for it."
The100,3602cv,AmityN7,0,Fri May 15 23:35:27 2015 UTC,I kinda see your point but I'm from the camp of if you do something then you need to face the consequences of that decision.   I hate the idea that people shouldn't be accountable for their own actions.
The100,3602cv,AmityN7,2,Fri May 15 23:38:42 2015 UTC,"What about when he shot the grounder in the bunker? That wasn't out of desperation because he didn't have to do it. He just did it because he was angry and panicked. If someone, even my friend, just started killing people unjustifiably then I would want them prosecuted."
The100,35xw7k,Kishara,10,Thu May 14 12:57:39 2015 UTC,"I hate that the wait is going to be so long, BUT I feel like it will be worth it to not have a mid-season break.  I feel like a show that's only 13-16 episodes shouldn't have such huge gaps between episodes like the shows that have 22+ episodes.  Hopefully what Pedowitz said will be true, that this will give people a good chance to pick up the show on Netflix, like between S1 and S2."
The100,35xw7k,sponch426,11,Thu May 14 16:33:53 2015 UTC,Why are they doing this ?

Both shows are star studded with well known faces (including the amazing Claudia Black) that should draw in a good crowd.   It may just be that CW decided to group the 100 with these new shows instead of trying to make it compete with the Flash/Arrow/TVD/Supernatural audiences.  just trying to cheer you guys up! <3  Legends of Tomorrow trailer and Containment trailer if anyone's interested."

The100,35xw7k,Bonafy,1 point,Thu May 14 15:33:26 2015 UTC,This is 100% The CW's fault. The show has already began writing season 3 and is set to begin  filming in July. Which is NORMAL for any show that expects to premiere in the fall.

It's also debuting the same time as a new DC show, so any DC fans might pick up on the 100 action.

Jesus christ just put it out of it's misery already. But, iZombie survived a midseason right? And The 100 is better written than any of the other shows on the network so it will survive this.

The100,35xw7k,Amonette2012,4,Thu May 14 13:20:31 2015 UTC,Mid Season means that we have to wait a year to see a new episode. The show will not premiere in the fall like it did this year.  There is a decent chance that the huge amount of interest online right now  cannot sustain that kind of a gap.

The100,35xzef,SecondClass-,4,Thu May 14 13:28:41 2015 UTC,"Sydney would've had much more power, still having the Commander of the guard in her pocket. This would've given her more freedom to arrange the seating/setup of the Unity Day parade, and probably would've allowed her to kill Jaha. From there, she would've been able to take over the whole Ark. Kane and Abby would be floated, along with any surviving council members. Sydney would've then put all of her time and resources into the Exodus Project, carefully preparing for launch instead of the hasty launch that killed her.  In turn, since it was the Exodus crash that crippled the Ark, the re-colonization of earth would've been much smoother and safer, with a lot less people dying. However, once on Earth, Sydney's response to the Mt. Weather/Grounder crisis would have differed immensely from Abby's. She probably would've given no support to the children in Mt. Weather, instead putting all of her energy into combating the ""savages"". A long and bloody war would break out between the Arkers and the Grounders, and Mt. Weather would, of course, benefit from this. Clarke would probably try to push for a treaty like she did in the original show, but with a belligerent, hostile chancellor in charge instead of a compassionate one like Abby, it would ultimately be impossible. Who would win the Arker/Grounder war is anyone's guess.  This all comes from the assumption, of course, that Shumway's position would've allowed for a more successful Unity Day bombing."
The100,35xzef,Shotokanguy,3,Thu May 14 23:46:36 2015 UTC,"It's cool to imagine if Syndey had turned out to be as awful and crazy as she appeared on the Ark, Clarke would've taken over by force, as opposed to simply telling her mother that she was in charge.  Maybe Clarke would've killed her. Another big moment for her, on top of everything else."
The100,35xzef,Nerazeal,2,Fri May 15 02:02:18 2015 UTC,"Her fate might have been the same if she used the ship she had planned to originally and more people on it would have had a higher casualty count. It is also possible that she would have had her closest members on that ship and they all would have died because of the jamming by Mt. Weather. In retrospect, it is possible that no one would have made it to the ground if they used the ship systems like the Exodus ship that Sydney used because of the inevitable crash once entering the Earth's atmosphere."
The100,35xzef,caesarfecit,2,Fri May 15 13:10:30 2015 UTC,"Probably wouldn't have changed much as Shumway's role in the Sydney plot was already complete, and the plot itself was well underway. What would have been more interesting is if the bomb killed or incapacitated Jaha, Kane, or Abby. Diana Sydney might have been able to seize power then and the Ark storyline would be totally different."
The100,35xzef,SilentSniper646,2,Thu May 14 13:54:15 2015 UTC,I don't even want to think about that
The100,35v5j4,caesarfecit,6,Wed May 13 19:49:03 2015 UTC,"Well shit.  Good on you, buddy."
The100,35v5j4,ChiralChupacabra,3,Wed May 13 20:17:53 2015 UTC,"Well, you made a good point. And when I stopped and thought about it, the use and unuse of their jamming capability revealed a lot about their strategic thinking. Priority #1 for Mount Weather was to stay in the shadows, and they succeeded up until Clarke got back to Camp Jaha. Until that point, the 47 were locked away, the Mountain Men were semi-mythical to the Grounders, and the Arkers were deaf, dumb and blind. Then it all slowly came apart on them."
The100,35v5j4,Jay013,5,Wed May 13 20:32:45 2015 UTC,"Interesting theory. Here's my points.   The dropships are all a hundred years old, and all have a record of malfunction during re-entry. The electric system frying and the late deployment of the retrorockets in Clarke's Dropship, Raven's pressure problem, The Exodus Ship's, well...you know, and Earth Suicide's dropship. That last one is an important note because his dropship got him to Earth alive. He was dying yes, but he got there alive.  You can use Earth Suicide as a means to justify the assumption that the Ark might come down in the future. But Lincoln found him when he was a child. The Mountain wouldn't keep eyes in the sky that long consistently. Takes me to my next point. Clarke's dropship had its electrical fired during early stage re-entry. No electrical signals coming in or out. It's basically a hunk of metal. After a nasty bump, retrorockets fired. This is an important note because the Mountain Signal Monty hears were of the Exodus Ship's final seconds. Which means the mountain has a range on their jamming. While we're on that note, there is no way they would be able to detect the Dropship coming in until it was way too late. The only reason they were able to crash the Exodus Ship, which we still don't know if it was them (this is addressed in another point), is because of the radio contact they had with the Ark. Raven's radios made communication possible, but there was no sense in jamming it immediately. They needed to learn about their enemies. So, they listen in. Gathering information. Once they realized the Ark was coming down bit by bit, they turn on the jammers. This is why all radios past this point were crap. Even short range. Speaking of information, the kids were under Recon from the start. The Mountain Men are defensive. They like to know what threats they face. So, after the landing, they send out a scout. ""Hey these guys can survive in radiation. Better tell Pressy Wally."" The Grounders sent a scout as well (Lincoln).  But wait. The 100 have made enemies of the Grounders. The Mountain can't get involved to defend their new potential blood supply. They don't have the resources for that. So, they operate in the background. They can't approach the kids saying ""come to our secret mountain"" because the kids are too smart for that. If they kidnap, they become the threat. So what do they do? They wait for a chance to become the heroes. Save the kids to earn their trust. But shit, The 100 are really good at defending themselves. If they win, and the Mountain can't be their saviour, they lose. So... ""The Mountain Men are pissed...whatever that means."" ~Octaviaof the sky people So, war happens, The 100 are losing, then they end up winning. They gas the 100 then take them to Mount Weather to ""shelter and aid"" them. Why do you think the response time of the Mountain Men was so fast? Their scouts were already out there. After the war started, they call it in, get their backup, and wait to be the heroes the children need. It worked didn't it? Monty just strayed a little too close to an MM scout and got caught in the process. Monty was too close. He knew his engineering. A jamming sequence means someone's broadcasting. Meaning the 100 aren't alone. The Mountain can't have that. They need the 100 to think it's just the Grounders, otherwise they will be perceived as a threat as well. They didn't expect a bunch of kids with scrap parts to put together something so efficient.   And some little details I need to address.   Sinclair stated that 95% of the Ark would break apart in re-entry or landing. Factory Station just happened to be part of that 95% The Jamming signal was turned on some time after the Unity Day broadcast. This is kept on for the rest of Season 1 and the entirety of Season 2. Which is why Raven's radios, and all other comms suck. They already knew that Arkers are genetically immune to radiation. Like the Grounders, just stronger. Dante was willing to assimilate them into the gene pool because they are civilized. The Grounders have known for a while. Lexa unites the 12 clans to fight against the Mountain. The Grounders are also scared and territorial. Which is why Jasper is held up as a warning. Then those 3 guards in S2. Early Stage Recon on your enemies adapting to their surroundings will always tell you everything essential you need to know.   Quick Edit: As for the Raven point, it appears the Mountain Men only took the people that were inside the walls, but outside the dropship. Because they also left Murphy. And he was tied to a tree with an injured leg."
The100,35v5j4,Jay013,1 point,Thu May 14 04:00:09 2015 UTC,"Those are some excellent points. Only a few things I'd add.    The radio waves stayed open until after the Ark landed. Otherwise Abby wouldn't have been able to talk to Jaha. Also, they likely made contact with Alpha Station as they knew where it was, which station it was, and that there were survivors. We could argue that the Abby/Jaha convo was a writing discontinuity (given that the jamming signal wasn't introduced until season 2 and Raven's radios worked because they were short range). But I think it's simpler that the mountain men left the radio waves unjammed until the Ark landed. Then keeping the Ark stations isolated was more important than intelligence/secrecy. If the all the Ark survivors reunited, they might have strong enough to defend themselves against both the Mountain and the Grounders, permanently ending the Mountain's tech advantage and with it their long term security.  We know the Mountain crashed the Exodus ship because their jamming signal was the same as the signal found in it's nav hard drive. The only plausible way I can think of for the Mountain to crash the Exodus ship was with some kind of radar jamming that caused the ship to lose track of the ground and possibly attitude control as well. Most spacecraft rely upon radar to measure their altitude (pressure altimeters are useless in space). But that also strongly suggests that they had a radar array aimed at the sky (Mount Weather has a bunch of antennas sticking out the top). It also makes sense that the 100 dropship was the victim of similar spoofing as the ship suddenly lost control and signal simultaneously just as it was coming out of re-entry. It was only unsuccessful because the 100 dropship caught the Mountain by surprise, the Exodus ship didn't. And I suspect the Ark landing succeeded because there were too many objects in the sky for the Mountain to successfully identify which objects were the stations and confuse their radar all simultaneously. And Jaha's missile landed because it has inertial guidance which is immune to jamming. But you wouldn't normally rely on inertial guidance to land a manned spacecraft as inertial guidance is basically digital dead reckoning.  Also, I strongly suspect the Mountain had no clue about the Arker's uber-radiation immunity until they examined them. They probably just assumed their immunity was similar to the Grounders. Which makes their motives for intervening either a mercy mission (unlikely. If they had good intentions, they would have interceded sooner and brought all of the 100 to MW, right when the 100 were abandoning their camp) or eliminating a threat. I surmise they hoped the 100 would be wiped out, and when the odds of that declined, they opted to capture them instead. That way the threat of them introducing modern technology to the Grounders was eliminated, and it'd foment conflict between the Ark and the Grounders. And as for Monty, I agree that he stumbled upon the Mountain Men watching the camp and that's why they took him first. But he wasn't wise to the Mountain. All he knew was that there was a weird signal on the Exodus ship's black box. A reasonable person could guess it was a jamming signal, but no idea about the where, how or why.  And finally, the Grounders had no clue what was going on inside the Mountain. Nobody escaped the Mountain alive until Clarke and Anya (and that was because Clarke found Any's tracking implant). The Grounders thought the Reapers used Grounders for food, and Lexa was able to unite the twelve clans because Clarke made the connection between the Reapers, the acid fog , and the Mountain Men."
The100,35v5j4,Hellman2741,2,Thu May 14 05:19:19 2015 UTC,"We could argue that the Abby/Jaha convo was a writing discontinuity   Actually, Sinclair fixes this a few hours after everyone's arrival at Camp Jaha. Raven and Wick also figure out the need to amplify their radio signals because nothing was coming in or out.  Also, Abby and Kane saw the smoke and said ""Could be Alpha"" and followed it.   Also, I strongly suspect the Mountain had no clue about the Arker's uber-radiation immunity until they examined them. They probably just assumed their immunity was similar to the Grounders. Which makes their motives for intervening either a mercy mission (unlikely. If they had good intentions, they would have interceded sooner and brought all of the 100 to MW, right when the 100 were abandoning their camp) or eliminating a threat.   They didn't Dr. Tsing even admits they shouldn't be that strong. What the 100 were was civilized. They weren't savages like the Grounders. That's why Dante, not Cage, wanted them in the gene pool. Was willing to let them in. Cage's haste is what killed them in the end.   All he knew was that there was a weird signal on the Exodus ship's black box   External signals always have someone broadcasting on the other end. They couldn't risk Monty figuring out there's another party.   Lexa was able to unite the twelve clans because Clarke made the connection between the Reapers, the acid fog , and the Mountain Men.    Um no. No no no no. Lexa was Anya's second until she was called to lead her people. She united the 12 Clans way before the Arkers were in the picture. She called them up for the war meeting to discuss Clarke's plan, but they were already united under Lexa's rule. The Coalition is why Lexa's a living legend amongst the Grounders. It's what Gustus tried to protect by poisoning himself to make it look like an attempted assassination. All Clarke had to do with it was making the 'do me' eyes at Commander Racoon. But no really. Clarke's involvement with the 12 Clans is minimal.  The Grounders know people in strange suits with strange weapons were taking their people and turning them into monsters meant to capture more people.  As for the Exodus Ship, it really is a mix of both sides. Sinclair even said that there would be damages to both the ship and the Ark seeing as it was still tethered to the Ark. But nope. Diana has to be a bitch."
The100,35utcw,ElenaOcean,8,Wed May 13 18:15:38 2015 UTC,Still one of the best episodes. It would be nice in Season 3 if they have at least one ep like this where the threat level in only minimal and we get a chance to laugh off some tension. If it's anymore intense than S2 I may get ulcers.
The100,35utcw,Jay013,2,Wed May 13 18:28:16 2015 UTC,Maybe we can have the drug nuts again. Only instead of an accident we can have it recreationally with some moonshine?
The100,35utcw,Jay013,2,Thu May 14 04:15:22 2015 UTC,"Pretty cool episode. The drug nuts really draw out their emotions and help them resolve it. Clarke and her father, Jasper and the Grounders, Bellamy and his guilt. This episode is about conquering your fears and regrets. Ever since they landed they didn't really have time to work out their own issues due to the need to survive. This gives them that much needed time to resolve."
The100,35utcw,woupieta,4,Wed May 13 18:59:33 2015 UTC,"Up to this episode I thought commander Shumway was working for Kane, because at the time it made sense: Kane wanted power, so he got Shumway to get someone to clear the road for him. How wrong I was."
The100,35utcw,Nerazeal,1 point,Wed May 13 19:07:01 2015 UTC,You are not alone. I thought he was working for Kane the entire time as well just by the way Kane was portrayed in the beginning.
The100,35utcw,mar33n,3,Thu May 14 01:00:21 2015 UTC,"It might not be the best episode, but it is still in my Top 3. It had humor and really made me like Bellamy. Plus the scene where Clarke and he talk after Dax is still my favorite one in the show, which is why I freaked the hell out when they referenced it in the S2 finale.  Also, I don't think anyone can ever top Raven's 'you are the most beautiful broom in a closet of brooms' line. Or Monty's about not being able to change the tide.  The only thing I was a bit iffy about is how fast the Lincoln and Octavia storyline went, but I had that problem during the entire first season, really."
The100,35utcw,isforwinrars,3,Thu May 14 00:25:04 2015 UTC,"I like this episode alot. The tone is nice, with the tripping kids at camp, and reminds me that I actually really enjoy the humor of the show when it's light and this is one of those few moments.  I also really enjoy Bellamy/Clarke time when there wasn't epic drama going on and this episode is about the only one where we get this type of interaction for more than a brief scene and it also contains, what is for me one of the two moments in the season which I read as unrequited Bellarke moments.   I genuinely liked the times (and miss them) when we see Clarke really be the moral heart of the show, her wisdom in convincing Bellamy to stay, being able to see him for the person he wanted to be and by providing the forgiveness he needed was powerful and I'm really glad that got a call back in s2.  I also really dig the juxtaposition of Bellamy and Clarke both facing their demons here and then the funny trip moments for the kids back at camp. I didn't find it jarring at all and really appreciated the light heartedness. This episode also has a special place in my heart as its the episode where I first started to buy Bellamy as someone other than token hot asshole guy character #1. Up until this point I really thought he was going to end up dying for Octavia at some point during s1."
The100,35utcw,Shotokanguy,2,Thu May 14 08:56:18 2015 UTC,"On a second viewing, I feel like I liked this episode more than I remember liking it before. Not like it was bad but...I don't know, it just seemed so solid, all around.  It's interesting that this episode can be easily forgotten, but it focuses on a theme that is still extremely relevant to the show now, and one I hope it continues to delve into in season 3. Forgiveness.  The show actually makes me think about the philosophy behind it, like when Jake says that forgiveness isn't something people have to deserve. So, Clarke doesn't have to do anything to be forgiven for what she did at Mount Weather...the problem is that the only people who have the right to forgive her are all dead. So...what do you do when you can't be forgiven? Maybe Clarke will figure that out, since she had so much trouble forgiving her mother.  Just thinking out loud, here. Also, I liked some of the humor in this episode. The show was definitely starting to hit its stride, I think, if they could work in funny exchanges like:  ""You're acting weird."" ""I feel weird."" wink ""...I have to pee."""
The100,35utcw,Nerazeal,1 point,Thu May 14 03:53:41 2015 UTC,"I guess I am in the minority, but I find this episode out of place in a weird way. It was light-hearted and dark and that mixture felt off for me when I originally watched it. After viewing it again, it was a good episode, but I feel like the only reason it was good was because of the feeling of resolve. I think I am just Season 2 biased (Damn you, Lexa. You poisoned me with your beauty and ferocity)."

Also, if you've ever been to DE, nukes or not, it would be hard to turn that into rolling sand.  Not to mention it doesn't have many major cities to be worthy of utter destruction.  I don't think they rowed across the ocean as well.  Parts of the Chesapeake bay maybe wide enough to simulate their experience.  Still, for the position of Jaha it's possible they were going south on foot and heat could have turned the NCs more desert like---there is a lot of sand some what inland on the coasts already and they could have rowed to the outerbanks or something.  Just random uneducated guesses but I don't see DE turning into a desert wasteland--maybe that is the fiction they eluded to."
The100,35ugw8,khaominer,1 point,Fri May 15 06:40:12 2015 UTC,"Oh and in a completely unrelated thought:  In season 1 when the ark finally reaches the ground, how are Abby and jaha talking on the radio?  Mount weather was jamming all the frequencies, it caused the exodus ship to crash before that and prevented the arkers from seeking out any more surviving stations.   Just a thought."
The100,35ugw8,Dikeleos,1 point,Wed May 13 16:45:20 2015 UTC,They did crash because it was a gamble. They only aimed and fell. There wasn't anything MW could do against a ship without its own plan.  I'm not certain as to how or why they could speak to jaha.
The100,35ugw8,wwhideanseek,2,Wed May 13 17:13:09 2015 UTC,"Actually, MW did crash the exodus ship. I think they jammed their navigation somehow?"
The100,35ugw8,Dikeleos,1 point,Wed May 13 17:15:38 2015 UTC,I was referring to the other ships. Not the exodus.
The100,35ugw8,TripJammer,2,Wed May 13 19:27:46 2015 UTC,"The pieces of the Ark weren't ""ships"".  They were falling, not descending.  There was no guidance for MW to jam.  As for Jaha and Abby talking, the Ark (what was left of it) was a spacestation with a high-powered transciever.  Most likely, they were using a frequency or encryption that MW didn't have the ability to jam.  Yeah, we'll go with that."

The100,35vinx,JohnnyReeko,7,Wed May 13 21:26:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed that the writing in the first few episodes is shaky, but I think some of your criticisms are a little unfair:   They set it up so all the evidence pointed at Murphy. He had means, motive, and opportunity, and everybody knew it. The mistake Clarke made was going off all half-cocked and publicly confronting Murphy, which incited a lynch mob of people tired of Murphy's shit. In real life, Murphy wouldn't have been saved by a last second confession.  Nobody is comfortable killing small children, even if it's justified and/or necessary. Carol is one of the most cold-blooded characters on Walking Dead and she's still haunted by it. Murphy pissed a lot of people off, and to make it worse, demanded the right to kill her, when they still weren't sure what to do. Which leads to...  Bellamy was pissed at Murphy because Murphy basically mutinied in the name of lynching the real culprit. He had become a danger to the group, and nobody really wanted him there anymore. That's why they exiled him.  Clarke didn't absolve Charlotte, there was the scene in the bunker where she made that pretty clear. Clarke's issue was that making capital punishment kosher was a very dangerous precedent, and she wasn't entirely wrong to think that, especially given the Ark's example.    It does get way way better."
The100,35vinx,caesarfecit,1 point,Wed May 13 22:18:57 2015 UTC,"Nobody is comfortable killing small children, even if it's justified and/or necessary. Carol is one of the most cold-blooded characters on Walking Dead and she's still haunted by it.   Yeah but at least in the Walking Dead they acknowledged that killing the girl was the only realistic option. Obviously she couldn't stay with the survivors because she was a threat and could do it again and they couldn't just leave her behind so they had to kill her. Not saying it wouldn't be a hard decision but it's pretty much the only option in situations without prisons and / or youth offenders places."
The100,35vinx,hailsimba,3,Wed May 13 22:48:05 2015 UTC,"That was the whole point of the scene with Finn and Clarke in the bunker when Charlotte was 'asleep'. They didn't know what to do, but they couldn't fathom letting a 12 year old girl die. Keep in mind that both of them didn't want Murphy hung either.   Also, Carol is a grown women, Clarke and Finn are 17 year old kids. They weren't thinking ahead, they were just trying to save a little girl's life."
The100,35vinx,Jay013,3,Thu May 14 10:18:49 2015 UTC,Others have already inputted what I wanted to say except...  Murphy's Law is the turning point of the series. This is when it stops being a stereotypical teen TV show and becomes something else entirely. It goes from 'okay' to 'thank Jahesus it's all on netflix' Hope you stick with it.
The100,35vinx,LlamaTony,2,Thu May 14 04:14:18 2015 UTC,I agree for the most part about Murphy. The show is awesome. Up to you whether you want to fight through the first couple episodes and want to be rewarded down the road.
The100,35vinx,ElenaOcean,2,Wed May 13 21:51:56 2015 UTC,"Feeling angry about Charlotte is exactly how the writers want you to feel. The show has you baying for the blood of a 13yr old girl...think about that for a second. If the youngest member of Bellamy's mob is capable of that level of violence...imagine what the others could do. That's why Bellamy uses Murphy as a scapegoat. He shows dominance over the biggest threat to his leadership and puts the others in line.  If you hate the writing and think the characters are dumb, you don't have to watch it. But if you're pissed because they didn't get to lynch the little girl...just keep watching."
The100,35vinx,ElenaOcean,1 point,Wed May 13 22:38:16 2015 UTC,"But if you're pissed because they didn't get to lynch the little girl...   Nah, that wasn't my problem, it's the fact that the characters seemed ready to all but absolve her of any guilt and act like nothing had ever happened just because she shed a few tears. The way Clarke acted towards someone who killed her best friend was not realistic."
The100,35vinx,khaominer,1 point,Wed May 13 22:42:39 2015 UTC,"I can guarantee that Clarke didn't forgive Charlotte. She's more upset that the situation got so out of control and that she's responsible for it. I can't really say a lot more without spoiling it for you, but nothing in the show is black or white and one of the ongoing themes is to make you question what the ""right decision is"" vs. how you might act in that situation. You're opinion on the characters and their actions will change a lot, depending on your own views, and that's completely intentional on the part of the writers.  The show isn't for everyone, but it's so much more than it appears in the first few episodes so it really is worth it to keep watching."
The100,35vinx,TheFlyingCandle,1 point,Wed May 13 23:28:59 2015 UTC,"I saw it as more meta and less Clarke acting like guilt was absolved.  ""We can't be responsible for a mob lynching a little girl,"" not a ""she doesn't deserve to be punished.""  I think a little girl jumping off a cliff because a deranged psychopath was holding a knife to your neck would be disturbing and upsetting, especially having some understanding of the psychological issues of that girl and being able to directly relate to her pain and loss she had suffered.  At the same time, you don't see them feeling, 'oh poor Charlotte,'  after.  It becomes more about how to govern and handle those situations.    I saw it as an evolution of the idea of governing and Clarke and Bel having to find common ground, and less, oh this poor little girl that did nothing wrong."
The100,35vinx,Kishara,2,Fri May 15 06:31:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, episode 4 was awful and I hated it too. I agree with everything you're saying. It gets way way better. That episode is definitely the low point in the series to me"

(Please speak to me about trigedasleng questions that you have.)  Edit: ""That"" is a tricky word in trigedasleng, and I believe bilaik is the best fit in this case. I don't think the demonstrative pronoun ""dei"" is really meant to introduce restrictive clauses.

The100,35qwi9,TheLGD,1 point,Tue May 12 19:45:37 2015 UTC,"Question. Due to the lack of Trigedasleng words, how do we feel about fan-made words?   Over in /r/conlangs we're encouraged to come up with words for our own and other people's languages. Figured we could do the same.   Put together a little Melting Pot of words made to fit Trigedasleng. Of course these words won't actually be canon but until we get canon words for some like say, chocolate cake, it's the best we can do, might even expand our trigedasleng conversations as well.   Also chakaukeik (like cocoa cake) for chocolate cake if we're starting now."
The100,35qwi9,Kishara,1 point,Wed May 13 09:05:26 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea. It would definitely allow for us to make more normal sounding sentences when we are just missing the core word. Should we put an asterisk or some other sort of marker on each made-up word? It seems like that would 1) prevent people getting confused, and 2) once we know the word later and people are looking back over these threads they don't try to learn the wrong word.  I've started making a list of words that I would like to know, and the google site also has a list like that."

The100,35lz0y,manicmelancholic,7,Mon May 11 16:26:37 2015 UTC,"My immediate thoughts after looking at those two pictures? Damn. That is one attractive man. Anyway...   Of course I didn't like him at first. Although in the start he had a ""Snape"" feel to him which was sort of alluring. Now he's emerging as a real hero and next season I can see him being forced into some leadership roles. Without Clarke around him and Bellamy will have the most respect. Sorry Abby. And I see him not wanting to be a leader anymore but taking up the torch anyway. Naturally he'll revert to a douche for a couple episodes, but we all know it's a trick. Kane is just too complex to stay good all the time. Although on a fundamental level he is a good person. I think.   My favorite scene with Kane is way too hard to choose. All the scary ones. In particular the one where he tells Abby he doesn't give a damn about the title of chancellor. Finally, New Kane defeated his inner douche.   My favorite quote by Kane:   Abby: They're being led by a child  Kane: So are we"

The100,35lz0y,Ossalot,3,Mon May 11 21:49:48 2015 UTC,"One thing I liked about Kane in the first season was that I was SURE he was behind the attempt on Jaha's life and then he wasn't ! That (somewhat minor) twist sort of cemented my growing appreciation of the show.   I mean, killing off characters willy-nilly is not the only way to be unpredictable.   One of my favorite scenes, although I didn't understand it very well and I have to go back and rewatch, is the one where he and Jaha are held prisoners by the Grounders and Lexa is undercover with them. Something about Kane, starting as ""no way we're going to kill each other"" and then growing more and more desperate really had me on the edge of my seat. What with his character's development I wouldn't have been surprised at all had he turned on Jaha, and the fact that he didn't sort of confirmed his redemption.  And then after that, I really appreciate how he trusted Clarke and really strove for peace the Grounders. In a way, that reminded me of Finn's pacifist efforts in season 1. That was a neat parallel IMO."
The100,35lz0y,bellaflecking,2,Mon May 11 21:53:38 2015 UTC,Oh how I love Kane! I think he was the first person I really liked. He was so cold at first and I was so sure he'd be the main villain but then he surprised me with the intentions behind his actions. <3 One of my favorite scenes is the scene where his mother died and he said he'd plant a tree for her.

""I have found the power-hungry jackass, and he is mine,"" said I during the pilot. Or something similar. And then: ""oh no now they gave him martyr issues. THIS IS GREAT."" to ""You dropped a building on him? I'm so happy!"" and ""Yeah, see how you like being thrown up against a wall in handcuffs. No, don't free him. Just leave him there. I want to stare.""  I have to pick a favourite scene? Actually, I'm going to go with the ""If we're going to kill hundreds of innocent people, we're going to do it by the book. Is that clear?"" moment because there's so much revealed with that line:    big picture planning (the few need to die so that the many can survive; deciding to go with the Trikru prisoner to negotiate for peace and continuing to do so even after Jaha was sent back with the order to have Skaikru leave if they wanted to survive; realizing the deep need to understand the Trikru in order for them to fight side-by-side without it breaking down) no one is above the law (sorry Abbs, you're getting some whiplash later; yes, Finn is a war criminal, we should try him in a court of law) following that: laws are important. Not following them gets people killed and causes social structure to breakdown. (see: that one guy who had a gun who wasn't supposed to and ended up shooting himself; Finn's Rambo moment; the integration of Trikru and Skaikru legal systems) social structure/hierarchy is important (first masked by his ambition to be chancellor; ""restoring order"" in the 2nd season premiere; acknowledging that Clarke is the best leader at this time) the need for the human race to survive (relentlessly running scenarios after they know the Ark is going to die soon; peace with the Trikru; even the attempt to negotiate with Fuckboy Cage Wallace) that intense look he gets (you know.)   I don't care what he's doing next season as long as they don't kill him off. Man's got a femoral artery made of iron if it can stand being shredded and go that long without bleeding out. I want to see him speaking some Trigedasleng other than '... kom Trikru.' pls, writers.   Quote? ""She made a choice, like executing people for stealing medicine and food. Like sucking the air from the lungs of 300 parents so they could save their children."" Hahahaha leave me on the floor here to die slowly."

The100,35lz0y,Jay013,1 point,Mon May 11 20:50:17 2015 UTC,"Ahh Kane.  You know, I've both liked and hated Kane. Twice. Each.  Both times I hated him was in the first half of the season where he was acting as a jerk, with proper reason of course, but still he could have considered his actions more closely. Both times I liked him was when he realizes ""shit, I should have been doing opposite of what I was doing"" and ends up redeeming himself. It's very up and down with Kane, but again, he's also up and down with his power as Chancellor/PseudoChancellor. And Like I said, it's the title that drives people crazy.  My favourite Kane quote and scene? ""I don't give a damn about the title, I just want to save our people"" in Coup de Grace when deciding what to do with Carl EmersonMt. Weather Security Detail HIC portrayed Kane's desperation perfectly in that scene.   In Season 3, Kane will probably lay back from any leadership role. He may help out Abby with the Arkers or Bellamy with the remaining 49/47 (49 if you include Bell and Raven, otherwise 47 original 100dites remain). When he's not doing that, he'll be chilling with Indra over in Tondc."
The100,35lz0y,SecondClass-,1 point,Tue May 12 07:53:04 2015 UTC,"Kane started off as my favorite kind of character: a definite antagonist, who does definitely evil things, but with no maliciousness involved whatsoever. His motivations were always very clear: do whatever it takes to ensure that humanity doesn't die out, no matter what the cost. When he discovered that the Arkers weren't alone, his goals remained the same, but with ""our people"" instead of humanity as a whole. In that aspect, he reminds me a lot of Dante.  I love the fact that the character does have a heart and conscience, but was raised in an environment where both were just a hindrance to doing what needed to be done. He's absolutely a pragmatist, which makes him a great foil to Abby & Jaha's idealism.  Favorite quote: ""If I have to take us down to a cosmic Adam and Eve, I will do it."""

In the 100, only 40~ days have passed, but in reality it's been filmed over two years. I don't know if you've seen LOST, but you can really see the problem with this in that show. Only 100~ days had passed on the show, but it had been filmed over four years so the kid looked a lot different. With adults, this is a lot easier since their looks don't change as much."

The100,35lsld,wwhideanseek,6,Thu May 14 23:47:39 2015 UTC,Yeah they are juvenile criminals that's how you say it? .  I think they did a pretty good job making them look younger...  And Clarke also looks more 'mature' at the end of season 2 if you compare her to the start of season 1.
The100,35lsld,manicmelancholic,8,Mon May 11 15:44:57 2015 UTC,The actress for Octavia is 28 - she looks nothing like a 17 year old.
The100,35lsld,bommeraang,16,Mon May 11 15:52:43 2015 UTC,"I actually find her the most realistic looking in terms of age. In real life I would think she's 20. Whereas the other actors really look their real age. It wouldn't do any harm to hire actual teenagers to play these roles, I guess talent at that age is just harder to come by."
The100,35lsld,manicmelancholic,7,Mon May 11 16:47:35 2015 UTC,"It's not just lack of talent (I wouldn't use the word talent, a more apt phrasing would be refined experience). There are a lot of child Labour laws and child acting union laws that make it difficult to use people under 18 in productions. They keep the kids safe even if they can be kind of annoying."
The100,35lsld,bommeraang,2,Mon May 11 19:01:45 2015 UTC,"Which I think is wise. But since they're playing 17-18 year olds I can't help but think that there are a lot more 20 year olds who look 18 than people in their late twenties. I mean an 18 year old could play these roles too, but like you said, casting for the exact age is tricky. But they could have still casted younger (18-22) actors... that being said I'm really happy with who they chose anyway."
The100,35lsld,manicmelancholic,4,Mon May 11 19:07:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, with that age range many aspiring actors would be in a school honing their skills or getting much smaller rolls to build their portfolio, I think its just an experience gap. The Casting Director(s) made some really great decisions."
The100,35lsld,Mo0man,7,Mon May 11 19:17:55 2015 UTC,"She doesn't look 28, but she doesn't look 17 either; she looks much more developed than a 17 year old girl.  I guess teenagers always look older in the movies due to the actors in real life always being older, and I think it's because most people complain about the quality of acting when it's a teenager/child labor laws."
The100,35lsld,spencer707201,1 point,Mon May 11 17:01:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's actually pretty unfortunate. I mean there are so many young people who would be amazing at it. What irks me though is why not hire 18-20 year olds? I mean when I see people my age playing teens it's funny but a little sad. At least it's great acting, but I feel they could have found great acting with a slightly more age appropriate cast as well"
The100,35lsld,Frankylops,1 point,Mon May 11 17:45:47 2015 UTC,"Traditionally, there are worries about teenage actors changing careers/ambitions midway through the series, worries about the quality of acting, and worries about the kids getting less cute.   Specifically to the 100, since it happens in a very short time frame (has it been a month since they dropped?) Hiring actors that are still physically growing will be an obvious sign of the passage of time that will be out of sync with the story.  The other thing is that I think casting directors have trouble telling the age of actors. Basically they see plenty of 'teenagers' who aren't actually teenagers, but were cast before, so their mental image of people of that age is skewed since they are around people of that age who are supposed to be younger so often."
The100,35lsld,TripJammer,2,Tue May 12 07:01:27 2015 UTC,"yeah, child actors are often terrible, and they appeal less to adults, so having adult actors appeals to a a larger range of people."
The100,35lsld,ChiralChupacabra,3,Tue May 12 06:01:23 2015 UTC,Could being in space with the radiation make it seem like you've aged more then you have? Just a thought
The100,35lsld,Shotokanguy,-4,Mon May 11 16:48:28 2015 UTC,They looked the same age before going on Earth.
The100,35lsld,wwhideanseek,2,Mon May 11 17:00:10 2015 UTC,"I think he means the fact that they grew up in space, inundated by radiation from the sun as well as residual from the nuclear event (the metals that make up the Ark's structure would have been bombarded by radioactive particles flung into space by the ""event"" 97 years before, and would still be releasing low levels of radiation as they grew up), might explain some of it.  Also, you know, it's the future"
The100,35lsld,Bond4141,0,Mon May 11 18:59:37 2015 UTC,"I don't really buy into that, and that doesn't really seem to have been indicated anywhere in the plot - given that CW makes similar age castings for other shows with teenagers."
The100,35lsld,wwhideanseek,1 point,Mon May 11 19:02:13 2015 UTC,Holy shit really?  That shit is bananas.
The100,35lsld,leeah,4,Wed May 13 17:36:38 2015 UTC,"Some of them can pass for their age, some of them might look older to you.  It's the same in real life. There are thousands of people out there who don't look their age. Humans are weird like that. This isn't something we should worry about."
The100,35lsld,Bond4141,0,Tue May 12 01:46:59 2015 UTC,"Meh, maybe it's just weird how we measure time/aging.  An yeah I think some look more their characters age than others too."
The100,35lsld,wwhideanseek,4,Tue May 12 16:40:56 2015 UTC,"For the story line, yes. They're all juvinile, and if they were 18+ they would have either been floated, or released back into general pop."
The100,35lsld,Bond4141,0,Tue May 12 03:59:41 2015 UTC,"Nope, no releasing them into general pop anymore, ark law's changed."
The100,35lsld,TripJammer,3,Tue May 12 16:51:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think this was right. The plan was always to release them back into gen pop or float them after a trial at 18. The rule's changed quote of Abby's that causes so much confusion is that none of them are getting trials. They are sent to the ground and pardoned if they survive. Presumably the laws would be different on the ground as they're not fighting resources so much (as shown by Abby being shock lashed instead of summarily killed, Murphy and Finn being pardoned, Jaha being imprisoned for bucking Abby, everyone getting off with a slap on the wrist for going to look for Finn, etc). There was never a point where they were holding them until 18 exclusively to float them."
The100,35lsld,manicmelancholic,1 point,Wed May 13 18:05:14 2015 UTC,"Wait, so they wait for them to be 18 to float them?   That's a waste of resources if I've ever seen one."
The100,35lsld,manicmelancholic,1 point,Wed May 13 00:36:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i guess it would be morally 'wrong' to float them earlier...   And they only changed the law because the air was runnig out."
The100,35lsld,ElenaOcean,0,Wed May 13 05:39:37 2015 UTC,"I wonder how much air could have been saved if they just shot the convicts, then unpressurized the airlock when they went to jettison them. Maybe have someone in a suit to push the corpse out with a broom."
The100,35lsld,manicmelancholic,2,Wed May 13 15:36:45 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm old.  So they look really young to me.  I can't tell the difference.  I feel the need to note that Raven and Bellamy are older than the rest, possibly in their mid-twenties."
The100,35lsld,StAugofHippo,0,Mon May 11 19:02:42 2015 UTC,"My younger brother is 17, none of the people in his year including him really look anywhere near as old as they are in this show - or in fact most depictions of High-School age people in TV Shows.  I guess that's true for most depictions of HS seniors in movies too (and around that age bracket)."
The100,35lsld,manicmelancholic,2,Mon May 11 19:07:00 2015 UTC,Hey! The fact that these teenagers are played by people in their late twenties is a good thing! Well for me. Because it means I'm not too old to be cast as a delinquent lol. But the actress who plays Clarke is like 27. I don't think any of them look like teenagers but that's how CW shows tend to be cast.
The100,35lsld,parco-molo,2,Mon May 11 16:45:27 2015 UTC,"True, the CW does typically do that. In Smallville, 25 year old actor was supposed to be 15 and it clearly did not fit whatsoever."
The100,35lsld,wwhideanseek,2,Mon May 11 17:00:50 2015 UTC,"It's too bad because a lot of young people are amazing actors. But yet it's so hard to find a teenager with an agent successful enough to get them on a show like this. So I mean talented teens are sort of hard to come by in that regard. I mean I don't mind with The 100, the actors are brilliant even though they don't quite look the part.   At least I can check them out without feeling creepy. So that's a plus."
The100,35lsld,parco-molo,3,Mon May 11 17:41:33 2015 UTC,also teenagers go through puberty which is a nightmare for continuity when they start sprouting hair or curves or their voice changes.
The100,35lsld,manicmelancholic,3,Mon May 11 18:01:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, makes me think of Carl on The Walking Dead. Very talented young actor but he aged much faster than his character did. I think the actress who plays Lexa is 22, and that seems like a good age to be playing Lexa. I think there just aren't many people in the 18-22 range with the time and connections to get on The 100."
The100,35lsld,wwhideanseek,2,Mon May 11 18:09:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think she's supposed to be 18, though. Jason said she was Bellamy's age."
The100,35lsld,pinkb0t,2,Mon May 11 20:01:23 2015 UTC,Which would make her the exact age of her character. So there's that. Of course the adults are a lot easier to cast the right age for. Although the adults are quite young looking.. for the most part.
The100,35lsld,Starbuck107,0,Mon May 11 20:50:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, makes me think of Carl on The Walking Dead. Very talented young actor but he aged much faster than his character did.   No he didn't. He was 12 in season 1, and now he's 14 (season 5). In real life, he's 15. That's only a one year difference. Come season 6, he'll be 15 in the show and 16 in real life. Big deal. By the time they hit season 8 or so, he'll have passed the peak of puberty and so will the character he plays, so it won't even matter from thereon out.  Seriously, it's very easy to avoid that kind of problem if you're not a retarded director. First, cast people who IRL are a little younger than the characters they play (Chandler was 11 when the show started, playing a 12 year old). Then, space out episodes and especially seasons. It's actually quite dumb that this TV show doesn't already do that; episodes should often be a day or a few days apart, and seasons weeks or even months. Considering this TV show is unlikely to run more than three seasons, and everyone's known it from the beginning (unlike  TWD, for example, which could break 10), there's no problem at all.  It's just laziness, really- lazy writing, lazy casting, lazy everything."
The100,35lsld,wwhideanseek,2,Tue May 12 09:35:57 2015 UTC,unlikely to run more than three seasons   Why do you think that? I know it is not yet the biggest show and has a relative small fan base but the growth of fan base and increase in quality make it a show that could persist a lot longer than that.
The100,35lsld,wwhideanseek,0,Tue May 12 16:45:28 2015 UTC,Because this is the CW
The100,35lsld,caesarfecit,3,Tue May 12 22:43:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think the show has enough of a budget and enough time to handle having child actors. They require tutors if they're missing school, and they're restricted to labour laws for minors. That's why most studios opt to hire 18+   I don't know if you've ever seen the show iCarly, but one of the main characters was 17 while they filmed while the rest were in their 20s. Because of this, there are lots of scenes where he just randomly disappears or walks out, because his hours were up for that shooting day.   Explains why we lost Charlotte so quick, at least to me."
The100,35lsld,notfoxcompany,3,Mon May 11 19:37:16 2015 UTC,Now that you mention it that probably is why Charlotte's ark didn't last longer. I don't mind that she died. But I think another episode to show the group trying to deal with a murderous 12 year old would have been interesting. Also now finding it funny Lexa is older than Clarke but Eliza Taylor is older than the actress who plays Lexa.

And sorry but I tried and tried to like Jaha but he's all over the place and always ready to give up and peace out.

His new deal with the city of light is even more annoying, especially after throwing that guy out of the boat.

Second because early  trailers and what no screamed teenage drama and angst.  It's not nearly as bad as I though it would be but I'm not a huge fan of Clarke.

You'll find that most people have a somewhat negative view of Jaha, but I think a lot of that comes from season 1. Season 2 gives him an interesting journey. I DID NOT expect to see him just push that guy into the water in the finale. That moment makes his character a lot more interesting IMO."
The100,35h41x,KingKolder,-1,Tue May 12 21:04:15 2015 UTC,"I want the show to follow through with jaha's experiences , make them more forefront, and hopefully kind of back away from blatant war tactics.

The100,35h41x,wwhideanseek,2,Sun May 10 14:50:33 2015 UTC,"Well obviously Jaha (and Lexa) 4Laif, but although I am Jaha's biggest fan, he doesn't have that much backstory yet.

I hope we see little or nothing of the Grounders. I want to learn  more of the world we don't know about yet rather than bogging down the story rehashing what we already do know. The Walking Dead made that mistake on the farm , they didn't keep the story moving and it was a buzz kill. The show is about The 100, and the regulars on the cast are who I am most interested in. I want to watch them grow and evolve more and face new challenges. Their story is what keeps me watching.  The worst thing I could ever imagine JR doing is to  abandon his main characters and make the show about the Grounders. The new season with the AI is such an exciting idea, why would anyone trade that to go rewatch Grounder politics again?"
The100,35h41x,wwhideanseek,2,Sun May 10 15:44:37 2015 UTC,Well I don't really want them to take over the series... I just wouldn't mind. Or maybe a mini spinoff series...

The100,35hn0s,Shotokanguy,2,Sun May 10 13:38:25 2015 UTC,Dig some holes for small things that can be buried. Obviously the shovels go last. Big things should be moved into the drop ship.  That's kind of annoying that we worked so hard for water just two weeks ago.
The100,35hn0s,woupieta,2,Sun May 10 14:29:47 2015 UTC,"Speaking about that last thing, we should probably get the zip line down. Someone with a horse who could do that?"

The100,35hn0s,Kishara,2,Sun May 10 14:30:13 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, if the winds are a hundred miles an hour we need a twofold approach. We have to secure our belongings and we have to get our crew to safety.   A- Get the small essentials gathered. All of our medicines and tech need to be saved. As we have not built cabins or shelters yet we have no place to store things except back at the drop ship. We have some horses from last week so we should pack them with as much as they can carry.   We need to secure the bigger items as best as we can, tie them down and take apart things like the hammocks and cover our gardens with staked down  tarps and any spare sheet metal we have lying around. This is a good opportunity to get some water, so lash the barrels to some of the more sturdy trees and leave the tops off them so they can be filled by the rain.    B- Now we need to protect the crew. As I see it there are two  options. We can go hide in the underground bunkers or we can head everyone back to the drop ship. Rains bring floods and I would not trust the bunkers we know about to be watertight so I think the safest place to ride this out is the drop ship. The time is going to be really short for getting everyone there, but even if we have to move  a short while early in the storm it is worth the risk imo to go for the safer option.    PS: Houses? You tricked me!"
The100,35hn0s,Kishara,3,Sun May 10 14:31:57 2015 UTC,"Wait, we have barrels? I didn't know we had things that size. I'm commandeering one to have a proper heated bath in at some point in the future. Gonna get some big rocks and heat them up and put them at the bottom. After the hurricane, of course.   We're going to have to filter that water through cloth or something. And hope that there's a relatively low salt water content compared to fresh water in it."
The100,35hn0s,arihadne,2,Sun May 10 15:58:07 2015 UTC,"Good point. As we have not yet discovered the bunkers yet (aside from the one Shane found in exile and didn't tell anyone about, and if we'd found the barrels we'd have found the guns and all know about it) I think we don't have barrels. /u/kishara must explain the origin of the barrels :)"
The100,35hn0s,Kishara,2,Sun May 10 16:00:34 2015 UTC,Yep    We are going to build a water supply. First thing we need is to develop holding Tanks. Now that you have wandered around awhile I am guessing you found some salvage metal and perhaps some metal drums. We need those hauled to camp. Can you do this if we enlist /u/Jay013 and /u/Shotokanguy to help drag them back to base camp?
The100,35hn0s,arihadne,1 point,Sun May 10 16:06:45 2015 UTC,"Ok, point verified! We have barrel like water containers."
The100,35hn0s,Kishara,2,Sun May 10 16:12:48 2015 UTC,Yep when /u/shaneh7646 was exiled he found the bunker with the barrels. I organized them to be hauled back to camp. Water filtration is one of the first things I added. I remember because some people brought the tablets and I decided that was not sustainable so went with filtering instead.
The100,35hn0s,Kishara,2,Sun May 10 16:03:10 2015 UTC,Excellent. Skaikru Spa Day 2049 is a go.
The100,35hn0s,arihadne,2,Sun May 10 16:12:38 2015 UTC,YAY! And I think we got some great herbal info from the grounders so  our Spa Day will be particularly pleasant smelling :)
The100,35hn0s,wwhideanseek,1 point,Sun May 10 16:14:48 2015 UTC,Some sort of bath house would be useful after the storms. Maybe the Japanese style ones where you clean off the worst of the grime with a bucket and rag while sitting on a little stool then get into a big shared bath!
The100,35hn0s,ShaneH7646,2,Sun May 10 16:14:01 2015 UTC,"Ooh, we can split the building with a small room with a a fireplace in it that we can use to heat large rocks before carrying them in, and then put them into something like a very large, wide dish in the ground. Then we can pour water over them and make a sauna and build wooden benches to sit on near it."
The100,35hn0s,wwhideanseek,2,Sun May 10 16:21:44 2015 UTC,"Old style saunas are pretty typical where I grew up (not me, random pic on the net)."

You could also do this by putting a large flat stone over a bed of coals, probably elevated above them a bit with some sort of frame. Then you just splash water on the rock. If you find one with a bit of a natural indentation in it then water could just be poured in and allowed to steam off."
The100,35hn0s,wwhideanseek,1 point,Sun May 10 16:23:38 2015 UTC,I did consider doing houses this week and a storm next week but I figured ya'll might run me out of town with those newly made shovels. Sorry! Just think how many extra building materials you'll have next week!

The100,35hn0s,Jay013,2,Sun May 10 14:43:13 2015 UTC,"Move as many things inside as possible, especially things that will blow away. We know there are caves nearby, as well as the bunker and that supply depot. Send some people to those locations with the items that can't fit into the bunker. Use the horses to carry items to the caves, where they can stay because no one wants an anxious horse in an enclosed space such as the dropship.   As for the gardens: push any stakes as far into the ground as they can possibly go. Secure covering for the plants so that they won't be completely damaged from the storm winds and from the salt water that's making up part of the storm.  Shore up the diverted stream so that it won't overflow onto our camp. Take a headcount to make sure everyone's here and settle in. No, that's just the eye of the hurricane. Bathroom break time. Ignore the state of the camp. There's nothing we can do right now because the rest of the storm's coming.  Ponder if the hurricane will bring Bitey the Mutant Water Snake up from the river.

The100,35ev1h,wwhideanseek,1 point,Sat May 9 19:05:35 2015 UTC,Revolution got so much better in its second season. A real shame the show wasn't very good to begin with because it seemed to lose most of its audience before becoming something special.
The100,35ev1h,daddydave,2,Sat May 9 22:15:13 2015 UTC,"Well ""got so much better in its second season"" might be a little bit exaggerated. I admin the first few episodes of the second season were not from this planer (also not from the original writers) but after that It kinda went downhill again. It's a shame because it could have been sooo amazing. If they just didn't hang themselves with a rope tied of their own story."

The100,35ev1h,MiaFeyEsq,1 point,Sun May 10 14:58:41 2015 UTC,Anime: Turn A Gundam. The plot is so similar to The 100 it's scary. Beautiful ending and one of the few animes I really find worth it.   The 4400 has a similar feel and is on Canadian netflix. 4400 people missing from various points in history all reappear at the same time however none of them have aged at all or have any memories past their disappearance. Great sci fi... but it got cancelled so the ending is lackluster and open ended.   EDIT: hate to be this person but honestly Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead should be there for the one or two people who haven't scene them yet and they are similar to The 100.

The100,35d5qt,brazil201,11,Sat May 9 04:10:16 2015 UTC,Africa and South America where likely the least affected.
The100,35d5qt,Dikeleos,7,Sat May 9 04:15:41 2015 UTC,"If it was a war, probably. But if it was a genocidal AI, she/it might have targeted the world in such a way to create a nice even destruction/radiation blanket over the world"
The100,35d5qt,aajjjj,7,Sun May 10 00:37:39 2015 UTC,I think that could be true.  So in both of these places the infrastructure is probably better. And it could be that more people survived. Being farther away from bomb blasts and having the 'ability' to survive with a minimum of food. And even if the ?topography? changed (Africa-Desert South America-Jungle) the people were already used to it.
The100,35d5qt,wwhideanseek,6,Sat May 9 09:53:01 2015 UTC,"Terra Nova nailed it.  All they failed at was not getting canceled.  They did it so well, they just got canceled way too early."
The100,35d5qt,Monroevian,6,Sat May 9 07:08:51 2015 UTC,I never saw the show.  Can you give us a quick run-down on how they got it right?
The100,35d5qt,junesponykeg,9,Sat May 9 14:13:49 2015 UTC,"It's similar to The 100 in a lot of ways.  They're stuck in the past the same way the sky people are stuck on the ground.  They've got an unexpected rogue group of humans (led by a badass girl) with mysterious plans that are always causing trouble.  Many shows introduce enemies that are incredibly powerful, but within a couple episodes they're getting killed easily left and right (the Jaffa and Wraith are good examples, if you've watched Stargate).  Terra Nova and The 100 don't do that.  The Grounders stay badass, and so do the dangers of the prehistoric setting in Terra Nova.  The dinosaurs are a constant threat, and even with all the technology that the humans brought back they still get their asses kicked a lot.    When the first season ended, it changed the whole dynamic of the show, too.  You could tell they were going somewhere, and you wanted to know where... but it never came back."
The100,35d5qt,Monroevian,3,Sat May 9 16:23:28 2015 UTC,"Most places wouldn't have a reason not to use guns, so they're probably a bit more advanced than the Grounders. But I still think that most of the world would be about the same as what we see in the show."

At the risk of looking like a huge nerd, I've always wanted to play Skyrim on PC with mods, and I was going to create a character that I imagined looking sort of like Lexa, with badass warpaint, big hair pulled back in a high ponytail, light armor...so the first time I saw Lexa, I got a Skyrim vibe from her design.  Alycia Debnam-Carey also added something to the role. And she's gorgeous without the Lexa costume too."

The100,35bk7o,joeydeno,6,Sun May 31 02:57:19 2015 UTC,"I have a huge crush on Lexa! The way Alycia-Debnam Carey plays her is just perfect. I got my friend to watch the show, and she would send me messages while she's watching. One day she sends me one saying ""Lexa has beautiful facial structure"". That was the first ever text she sent that's about how good a character looks."
The100,35bk7o,freddiefriday13,5,Fri May 8 19:30:53 2015 UTC,"Lexa and Clarke have the same character (strong and sure). I like them both, but I have a slight preference about Lexa. She knows how to fight (I want a sparring partner like her :D). She's a leader and has a strong temperament. She knows what she wants and doesn't let the others decide for her...and omg, I love the eyes, the hair and the smile of Alycia...she is gorgeous !"
The100,35bk7o,syrudine,4,Sat May 9 13:47:05 2015 UTC,Raven! She's so gorgeous and has a kick ass attitude

The100,35bk7o,ShaneH7646,3,Sat May 9 00:24:34 2015 UTC,"Just for the sake of naming someone else I'll go with Maya. There's something kind of weirdly appealing about her dark circles and pale face. So that's my unconventional pick.  For conventional I really like badass grounder Octavia even though I hated her in season 1. Or Raven, for her can-do attitude.  And of course Bellamy. Everything about him but especially his half-smile thing.  EDIT : forgot this one, since he's a bit of a minor character. But Niko had the charming hairy woodsman thing down."
The100,35bk7o,Ossalot,4,Sat May 9 01:31:13 2015 UTC,Finn. I just had the hugest crush on him and his glorious mane in S1. sobs Raven is my other crush - she's just gorgeous and sassy and amazing - but I'll never forgive her for cutting off his hair.

The100,35bk7o,DontcallmeGeorge,3,Fri May 8 19:10:50 2015 UTC,For me it started out as Octavia and Bellamy. I think now I'd have to say Bellamy and Lexa.

The100,35bk7o,Wheat_For_Ore,3,Sat May 9 03:19:48 2015 UTC,Lexa or Clarke for me. I like Harper too. But Lexa's certainly #1 for me. :)
The100,35bk7o,stefan223,2,Sat May 9 07:48:52 2015 UTC,Octavia

The100,35bk7o,ironkrylon,2,Fri May 8 21:44:25 2015 UTC,I think Finn was very attractive. Bellamy became more attractive to me as he began to not be such an asshole.

The100,35bk7o,bellaflecking,2,Sat May 9 09:08:46 2015 UTC,Ok I'll admit it. I kinda have the hots for Kane.  Edit: Also Gustav was hot.   Second edit: How could I forget about Lincoln.
The100,35bk7o,Amonette2012,2,Sat May 9 16:30:19 2015 UTC,"Murphy. I just...Murphy. Didn't think he was attractive at all at first (hair slicked back Bellamy henchman era). Then once he can back in I Am Death, I was a little disturbed by how hot I found him covered in blood and wounds. It just spiraled out of control from there."

It's a card based battle game but it's very fun. It's an RPG and the basic plot is a long time ago a god swallowed up the sea so that the humans fled to the sky and grew wings. It's definitely fantasy but with lovely post apocalyptic dystopian qualities. Very long game. Very worth it. Similar themes, hiding from military, corruption, survival, hard choices and complex main characters. I'm sure I'll think of more games to add. But this is the prettiest."

The100,355vx6,jorisimo11,5,Thu May 7 11:04:42 2015 UTC,"Don't really have anything to add for the comparisons, but I do want to say something about what you said in the last paragraph.  They didn't put the everyone's lives in the hands of children, they sent the 100 down because they are expendable (said by Jaha while they were going down in the dropship). They are the only known criminals on the ark, they knew they did not have enough oxygen, so they would have to reduce the population (later in the show again, the culling) and ofcourse the criminals would be the first to go. Even with all this, the council only agreed to the plan because of Abby's lobbying. Them checking to see if the earth is survivable is a nice bonus, and the reason why they were sent to the earth instead of being floated probably.  As for the treaty, I'm also doubtful about it but but you have to remember the decisions characters make shouldn't always be perfect. Lexa made the decision she thought would be the best for her people, and only her people. She completely fucked over the arkers and Clarke, which is going to bite her in the ass because of them beating Mt. Weather, despite the odds. The grounders themselves probably didn't want the treaty either, they're the ones who want blood for blood, Lexa makes decisions on what she thinks is best for them, not what they want."
The100,355vx6,jorisimo11,1 point,Thu May 7 11:22:51 2015 UTC,"yes but sending them down totally uninformed and unprepared with so much depending on them is kind of hard to digest. Also, what kind of fancy furturistic bracelet doesn't know the difference between someone dying and the thing being removed? heck that'd be easy to program considering the level of tech they must have been at - the ark has artificial gravity!"
The100,355vx6,jorisimo11,1 point,Thu May 7 11:35:00 2015 UTC,"There was no time to inform them better beforehand I think, judging by how rushed it was when Abby said goodbye to Clarke. They sent a radio down with them, and the chancellor was giving information while they were in the dropship, but everything was fried because of the crash.  As for the bracelets, they don't say they're dead, it just says signal terminated. They definitely should, and could, have done a better job concerning those bracelets, but they just didn't think the 100 would try to remove them. Even while it was happening, they still didn't think ""Hey, what if...?"", they needed Raven to spell it out for them, so that's just negligence on their part.   The only thing I'm bothered by sometimes is the stupidity/narrow-sightedness of the adults compared to the 100.  The artificial gravity by the way is not 100% accurate in the show but we already know how to do that."
The100,355vx6,jorisimo11,2,Thu May 7 12:21:51 2015 UTC,"The kind of 'true' artificial gravity we see in the show is the 'flip a switch' type - when Jaha gets in the space suit and crosses space to the ship with the missle, his faceplate cracks. When he finally enters the ship's airlock, he is floating. Then he hits a button to pressurize the airlock and he falls to the ground, hard. Pressurizing the lock should have zero effect on the gravity - we see ISS astronauts in pressurized zero-g all the time.  We don't have that kind of artificial gravity, where you can turn it on and off like that: We only have psuedo, centripetal-force  gravity (rapidly rotate say a circular space station to create varying degrees of 'gravity' depending on whether you're close to the axis or out on the edge).  By the way had the ship been spinning to create centripetal gravity, Jaha would have had a heck of a time timing his entrance to the airlock. Although, in that case an intelligent designer might place the airlock at the axis, where it rotates around a fixed position in space."
The100,355vx6,jhack3891,1 point,Thu May 7 12:25:47 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree, that's why I said it wasn't 100% accurate. It's not just Jaha, The scene that introduced Raven also had the 'flip a switch' kind. Only way I can imagine that is with some kind of electromagnetic machine, but then turning that off and on would control the gravity of the entire Ark. Either way if they have gravity in the Ark there would be gravity just outside of it too.  What I meant was that in the shots of the ark you can see a big part that looks like it was meant to be rotating, and that we already know how something like that can create a gravitational force."
The100,355inu,VGBAMF,2,Thu May 7 07:40:33 2015 UTC,Do you mean Ryder? The one assigned to protect Clarke?

The100,355inu,Shotokanguy,2,Thu May 7 16:19:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he wasn't really Gustus' replacement, I don't think, since he was hanging around Clarke.  Lexa still needs a new one. I think they should hire me."
The100,352eto,Nerazeal,8,Wed May 6 15:16:05 2015 UTC,"I think my favorite thing about this episode is that we slowly see the transformation of Kane from a terrible person to a less terrible person.

The last set was of The 100 faction, this one is of the Grounders.  Recently she changed out the snoo as well. I believe the idea is that there will be lots of graphics.

Kane could get away with it, but it might make him seem a little too Desmond (Lost). Maybe if Clarke's dad had been Aussie? I love her accent so that mighta worked"
The100,34vggc,fretspyder,4,Wed May 6 14:21:10 2015 UTC,"I always prefer it when actors use their own accents. For instance on Arrow, story-wise it wouldn't make much difference if Quentin Lance (Paul Blackthorne) and Dinah Lance (Alex Kingston) used their own accents. Mr and Mrs Lance don't have to be originally from America.  of course there are exceptions. I just want to hear Tatiana Maslany do EVERY accent ever on Orphan Black."

The100,34tuxl,Amonette2012,4,Mon May 4 14:51:48 2015 UTC,"While she isn't my favourite character by a long chalk, I think having her in the storyline makes Clarke's progression more interesting. From a mother's viewpoint, her progression from teenager to warlord must be hard to watch.   Also while Abby doesn't have Clarke's discernment and budding wisdom - Clarke gets that from her father, she does have the same ability to make hard decisions that require the sacrifice of innocents or people she loves.  If she also had Clarke's ability to use wield this attribute more carefully we'd like her more.   Clarke needs both of these abilities to do the things she does and be the leader she is, and having her mother there reflecting the darker side of her nature gives the whole show more depth. It's also interesting to watch Clarke becoming more independent of her. It's one of the most complex relationships on the show.  I also really like the chemistry between her and Kane.  So overall, I'm glad she's in the show."
The100,34tuxl,Jay013,2,Mon May 4 19:11:15 2015 UTC,I have been especially hard on Abby this season and I think it was mostly justified. It's hard to find any empathy for someone so blind to the situation The 100 is in on the ground. The last two episodes did start a possible redemption for Abby and I hope it sticks. For Abby to recognize that she has said some pretty stupid things and to accept that the rigid society formed on the Ark has to evolve would be a good path for the show to take her character.   Paige is a marvelous actress. I would hate to lose her on the show and  I hope that the writers make some needed changes with the character to make her less frustrating to viewers. We know no one is safe on The 100 and my concern is that if they don't get some redemption going soon for Abby she could well be the next major character to find herself in an early grave.
The100,34tuxl,Shotokanguy,2,Mon May 4 19:26:21 2015 UTC,"I really think it is just the position of ""Chancellor"" that screw people over by either having it, or not having it (Like in the case of Jahesus). Abby was a lot better back when she only had to worry about Clarke, but then you put her in a position where she suddenly has to worry about a couple hundred lives as well as her daughter's and priorities get conflicted. Looking at it now, it's a bit more understandable than it was when we were seeing individual bits of Abby's scenes, rather as one whole now that we can watch all of season 2 in one go. But she still should have listened to Clarke."
The100,34tuxl,BysshePlease,2,Mon May 4 21:41:47 2015 UTC,"Allows Wells to take the blame? How do we know that? It's entirely possible she never knew that Wells did that in the time between Jake being floated and Clarke being arrested.  And what could Abby have done to prepare Clarke? They came to get them out of their cells, Abby showed up and stopped the guards to talk to her and try to comfort her. She even knew she was going to try to protect other people and told her not to go so far in doing that as to put herself in danger, because she couldn't bear to lose Clarke.  Abby also isn't angry at the idea of not being able to influence Clarke - she's terrified of the idea of her daughter putting herself into life and death situations, and making life and death decisions. It's not something any mother would ever want for their daughter.  I think it's pretty obvious that I think people are wrong about her. She was just a caring mother, in my eyes. And she's had plenty of badass moments - no one was hating her all the way up to 2.07, when she saved Lincoln with that quick thinking.  Paige Turco is great as well. And even though I don't generally lump her in with the younger actresses on the show...she is a very pretty lady."
The100,34tuxl,fernando_69,1 point,Mon May 4 23:48:12 2015 UTC,"I distinctly remember Maya telling Jasper, ""None of us is innocent,"" because I remember the grammatical incorrectness of the line. I looked back and Abby's last line is is to Clark assuring her guilt with ""Maybe there are no good guys.""  As for the character, I like the actor more than I like the character (and in hindsight, since AI was introduced in The 100, it's nice to have an actor from Person of Interest). Seeing the character summed up by the OP, it's kind of amusing how much of a mess Abby really is. And I think that's by design. She's idealistic, but idealism doesn't get you anywhere in the world of The 100 so she's ultimately ineffective as a leader on the ground. Particularly when compared to Clarke who is increasingly unhesitant to do what she must despite the moral cost. And it's perhaps also by design that Kane too looks like he would make a better leader than Abby considering he was ruthlessly authoritarian on the Arc and on the Ground.  My problem with Abby as a leader is exemplified in the scene where she's captured and first meets Cage in his Mount Weather clinical dungeon. She sees one of her people being drained of Marrow and the first question she asks is ""Where's my daughter?"" In her first words with the leader of the Mountain Men she reveals that she's Clarke's mother, potentially weakening Clarke's bargaining position. She's also more concerned about her daughter than trying to negotiate with the Mountain Men to spare their lives. Kane's the one who later finally suggests they willingly donate bone marrow. She may be a great medical doctor, but she's a crummy leader.  But for all her failings, her self-righteousness, her stubbornness, Paige Turco carries the role charismatically enough such that she isn't irredeemable yet. In the first two seasons Abby flailed, and in the third season I'd like to see her learn from her mistakes and rise up as an important member of her society thanks to that new wisdom, much in the way Kane has. Since the missile incident and that conversation Abby had with Kane in the rubble, it seems like that's where she's headed. She's a character that needs to find the role that better fits her in that world, and I actually do look forward to seeing her find that role."

While we can say yes, she has felt the sun, no, she has not felt it in the reality of her life without standing in a window longingly and even that, is just a portion of her understanding.  With no comparison, as they said, no understanding.  Even with the well worded article, comparing our reality vs radiation shielded inches of glass as we stop for a moment, cannot be compared.   I would imagine the moment an astronaut gets back and steps out into the world, feet on the ground, would be very similar to their experience, with the added I made it back, and subtracted, no one has been here we made it.  Soaking in the sun, the breeze, the smells, the feeling, would be incomparable. I know that isn't the scene you are relating the article to, but that is the overall message.  To her, the reality of the sun on her face, and life on earth, is something she desires and cannot imagine.  It's dense to try and break down the commentary so much.  It is commentary on the exhilaration of life on earth and all the things we feel vs life in space.  The astronauts feeling in standing in that window is exactly what the scene means.  It may be over emphasized to get the point across, but the point is relevant.  When they step away from the window, they do not feel what we feel every day like nothing.  That is the desire in my humble opinion."
The100,34sxk0,BysshePlease,5,Fri May 8 10:35:16 2015 UTC,"I think she meant she's never felt the sunlight on her face. As in she's never been outside. Which she hasn't, unless she has been on a spacewalk, which I doubt."
The100,34sxk0,Shotokanguy,5,Mon May 4 14:19:14 2015 UTC,Way too late but what the hell. Even if she did go on a spacewalk she'd be wearing a big ass suit. To experience the sun on her face with nothing but air in the way she'd have to be in earth.
The100,34sxk0,Shotokanguy,-6,Sun May 10 22:03:55 2015 UTC,I think she meant she's never felt the sunlight on her face.   That's the point.  She clearly has felt the sunlight on her face.

The100,34sxk0,Wxlson,2,Mon May 4 15:35:59 2015 UTC,"On one hand, I'm finding it amusing how people are contorting the semantics of the exposintro so that it makes more sense. It's an imperfect statement under most circumstances (I hold to my theory that Clarke is an agoraphobe and keeps away from windows. Hence why she wanted to go to Mount Weather so badly, and why she wanted to get back in. It wasn't to save the 47, she's just a shut-in.), and poetics just makes it high-school-lit-assignment-pretentious. On the other hand, the OP already made a thread about this and making a new thread just because you found a quote a week later supporting what was tactlessly argued a week before seems pointless. It's not really adding anything significant to the conversation that couldn't have been posted in the previous post. Lest next week we get a post with the URL of a YouTube video taken with some random's cell phone recording a scene on their TV from From the Earth to the Moon DVD."
The100,34sxk0,Wxlson,-1,Mon May 4 17:03:53 2015 UTC,"I think the line is quite obviously a mistake.  Sloppy and quick writing that ""sounded right"" and was never questioned.  It's crazy how passionately people defend it, though.  It took a week to get a response from an astronaut who had been stationed on the ISS.  Given that the majority of the defense of the statement was along the lines of sunlight not being able to be felt the same on a space station, I thought it was worth pointing out the new evidence.  But obviously nothing is going to convince these people.  They're rabid about the perfection of this show, I suppose."
The100,34sxk0,MeropeRedpath,3,Mon May 4 17:10:50 2015 UTC,"Do you know why I'm annoyed by this nitpick?  The idea of the line is worth more to me than the scientific accuracy. It is more powerful to imagine the Ark as an unenviable living space and Earth as ""the dream"". If it requires a little suspension of disbelief to say Clarke has never felt much warmth through one of the few windows on the station, I'm fine with it.  It's generally less fun to be negative. I'm not rabid about the perfection of this show - I wish season 2 had less logistical gaps involved in terms of travel time between each location, Octavia's sword skills, and the bone marrow procedures. But something this simple isn't worth acting superior over."
The100,34s8eq,percynezz,8,Mon May 4 02:56:07 2015 UTC,Jason Rothenberg has said that the AI is the city of light. However it's still possible a real city exists somewhere.
The100,34s8eq,manicmelancholic,6,Mon May 4 03:36:06 2015 UTC,"Well that's a letdown. I was hoping there was a legit ""city of light"" somewhere out there, but the  AI led him to the house purposely, away from the CoL, to do her bidding, whatever that may be."
The100,34s8eq,Joe_Sith,2,Mon May 4 04:47:35 2015 UTC,"A letdown? It threw us for a complete turn of events. Had there been an actual city of light, I think it would have been somewhat disappointing, as we all expected something like that to happen."

The100,34s8eq,distortednet,2,Mon May 4 04:24:40 2015 UTC,Mind you it's possible Rothenberg was just trying to throw us off. I hope so because I still want to see a city of light! I think it would be really interesting if there was city that the AI led him away from. But I trust Rothenberg to write a great story. So if it's like he said and the AI is the city of light I'm sure it'll still be great and fascinating to watch
The100,34s8eq,manicmelancholic,7,Mon May 4 04:55:45 2015 UTC,I'm fairly certain that The City of Light was the area filled with solar panels - called The City of Light because it shone over the mountains. I think anything passed that is just a continuation of the story unrelated to that name..
The100,34s8eq,Jontolo,2,Mon May 4 05:45:45 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure the City of Light will wind up being a city populated by AIs (the people are made of ""light""). And the reason the guy in the desert asks if they ""have any technology"" is because he is trying to ascertain whether Jaha's group are also AI. I think that's the specific hint/phrase from the episode that Rothenburg commented on in an interview. Dun dun dunnnn."

I don't think that there's more than one however. I feel like Allie? is THE AI, she's the 'City of Light', like surely if there were more they could stop her? The guy in the recording that Murphy watches talks about her exclusively, from that scene I got the feeling that he a) created her and b) that he only created her. She is the reason the earth was destroyed and in an ironic twist is this 'city of light' that Jaha is convinced will save his people."

It'd be nice if someone cobbled together a banjo or some stringed instrument, someone could set up a makeshift drumset, and we could all contribute a verse or even just a line to make a song about our experiences perhaps to commemorate the moment.  Has anyone constructed a still since we landed (Monty? Jasper?)? It wouldn't hurt to have some hooch for the festivities, or maybe for future festivities. Or we could just indulge in some of the local berries.  Maybe I could organize an Ikebana class using some of the local flora. Or maybe scale it up for a shelter decoration contest to see who can spiff up their dwellings using the otherwise useless resources we currently have. (when the Mountain Men come they'll think they're raiding a bowerbird camp!) We could do some aesthetic landscaping around the camp using local shrubs. Ones that look nice. And not too expensive. We could place them beside each other only slightly higher so we get a two-level effect with a path running down the middle.  I spend the morning writing a song for Fox. But it's hacky and my mind can't move away from a ABAB rhyme scheme so I get frustrated and rip up the paper. Which is unfortunate because that was the only piece of paper I had."

You need to isolate a foal and capture it, then train it over the course of several years. Also, we don't have any material to make bits, which we'd need, so we have to talk to the smithy who's setting up somewhere in the woods ;)  Or... we go on a raid and steal grounder horses. Just sayin'. There's gotta be some tribe out there that hasn't heard of our alliance, since it's pretty recent..."
The100,34pj7a,wwhideanseek,1 point,Tue May 5 05:54:35 2015 UTC,Raid is a pretty good idea.  But we should first start trying to capture wild ones. I don't think it takes that long.  We only have to tame them an make then accept us ok their back. Taming is maybe a week or two.  Edit: A raid actually starts to sound like a great idea!
The100,34pj7a,Jay013,1 point,Tue May 5 07:04:19 2015 UTC,"Taming an adult horse caught wild takes much longer than 2 weeks. It's more or less the equivalent of training a wolf to be a dog, it's much easier if you start young (Note to self, try to find wolf pups/wild dog pups to get guard/war dogs).  It takes a huge amount of time to train a horse to accept you on their back. Young horses are not docile, and they're not accepting of all those contraptions we put on their backs and in their mouths ;)  It takes a while to fully ""break"" a horse to the saddle. Here's a video the ark had on file ;)  It's not just lasso em' and get on their backs, as you can see, and that dude's a pro :P But we'll get there, I've trained for it!  Raid is the short term answer, training is long term. Or we could trade with the grounders, what with our alliance and all."

And, because I have a chronic un-relaxation-ability, I'm going to work on figuring out a way into the remains of places of scientific tech in the former Washington area so that we can up our standard of living. Actually, make a stop at the art depot, grab all the paper and pencils, get in touch with the Ark and start making maps of the useful places (other than Mt Weather and that other bunker) in the area.  Probably check on the garden, too. See how the potatoes are going. Find out what plants are around that we can make oil from, because a) fuel, b) FRIED FOODS, and c) eventual soap. I doubt there are olives (biggest sadface in the world), but it would be good to see what's survived in the botanical garden area (2.6 km of greenhouses and 12km of the National Garden). There might just be enough of the Rose Garden left to gather some plants to take back so we can make rose oil once we've got a supply of vegetable oil or something. PRETTY SMELLS. Gonna start a perfume business? We'll be like that oldest perfumery on Kypros.  There was corn growing on trees in the books, so at least we might have corn oil? Gonna cross my fingers for there to have been at least some global warming because that would be great for plant life. And Ebola. But we'll focus on the plant life, especially if the climate is closer to San Francisco now (given that it's November and only seems to be cold at night).

Lincoln's explanation for why he became so immediately fond of Octavia I think has two possible interpretations that I can immediately think of. The first is that Lincoln's early experience with an Ark-er humanized the Sky People in a way that his fellow Grounders never experienced. He was a child and hadn't had divisive tribalistic notions ingrained into his mind yet, so he showed compassion to another human in need. This compassion transferred over to Octavia. He saw Octavia had fallen and took her back to his lair to nurse her back to health the way he wanted that Sky Person as a child. Also, because he had that compassion for that SKy Person, when his father made him kill the Sky Person, this could possibly have made him feel guilty. His alliance with the Sky People and Octavia could be his way of atoning for what he was forced to do as a child."
The100,34jxz0,BysshePlease,3,Fri May 1 20:51:04 2015 UTC,"I agree about the Lincoln thing, but iirc, Clarke and Bellamy didn't let Finn give himself up? He pretended to go along with it at the dropship so they wouldn't block his way out. I agree Finn sucks, but it wasn't 100% survival instinct."
The100,34jxz0,queenbellevue,1 point,Fri May 1 21:01:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right. But if were really willing to accept the consequences of his actions, he wouldn't have bothered to go with Clarke and Bellamy's plan. They didn't force him, he went with their plan to hide him. And he decided to sacrifice himself only after Clarke gets knocked out and they all get cornered in the dropship with little hope of survival."
The100,34jxz0,BysshePlease,3,Fri May 1 21:19:21 2015 UTC,"Addind to this, Bellamy asks why Lincoln protected Octavia. An attraction was formed out of that protection. Replace Octavia with,say Fox, and Lincoln would have probably done the same."
The100,34jxz0,Jay013,2,Fri May 1 21:59:57 2015 UTC,"That's a good point about Lincoln, I love his relationship with the Arkers and this explains a lot. Plus, just as a side note, Octavia was the first person off the Ark. So Octavia was the first Arker he would've seen since his childhood? Anyway, yeah, I agree slightly about Finn not wanting to die but it was just so frustrating to watch him in that episode."
The100,34jxz0,sonicmerlin,1 point,Sun May 3 09:28:43 2015 UTC,The real reason Lincoln falls for Octavia is b/c she's hot.
The100,34jxz0,MeropeRedpath,6,Thu May 21 07:49:24 2015 UTC,Wait a minute. There was an Arker on the ground before the 100? I must have missed that. Why haven't a dozen theories been developed based on this fact? How did the Arker even come to the ground? Why didn't they signal back up to the Ark? What is going on??
The100,34jxz0,MeropeRedpath,1 point,Tue May 5 04:54:48 2015 UTC,"Huh, I guess I actually didn't stop to think what I was asking. I'm now feeling just as wtf are you are!!! Here is the link for when they're talking about it: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQMahZhyV8SItwT_Be1VZ7JJbXZ1_l4pM  Bellamy said he heard stories from the guard talking about it, and it was 'suicide by earth'. I'm kinda thinking it might've just been a test to see if earth was survivable that failed. But theories would be cool!"
The100,34jxz0,ChiralChupacabra,1 point,Thu May 7 12:11:20 2015 UTC,"Well holy shit! I'd forgotten about that, what with all the action in the last season 2 episodes. This must be discussed. What if there are others? There have to be others that survived. But how did the Ark afford to just send people on dropships down to earth, wasn't there a lack of ships in the first place? Maybe it was an illegal way to commit suicide... But even then, why wouldn't the people that survived have communicated back with the Ark? Questions, questions..."
The100,34jxz0,MeropeRedpath,1 point,Fri May 8 03:16:14 2015 UTC,"Well, when jaha ends up in the desert with Zorn his family turns him in because there's a bounty on Sky People.  Which means there must have been others before the 100 came down. I doubt the Wastelanders were aware of the ark coming down.   Although I suppose it would have been seen by everybody within a few hundred miles... Hm."
The100,34jxz0,jorisimo11,1 point,Wed May 13 15:54:15 2015 UTC,"Very, very true; That actually bothered me at the time because I hadn't caught what Lincoln said to Bell and I was just like ""ok well suspension of disbelief, I guess someone saw the ark fall from the sky and was really proactive about getting their hands on sky people""  But you make a great point!"
The100,34jxz0,VGBAMF,2,Wed May 13 16:03:25 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit foggy on the Finn part, don't recall him specifically running away from everyone? I thought there was a point at the dropship when he ran away from the dropship towards the grounders to give himself up, but as I said a bit foggy.  As for Lincoln, He told the story to show he didn't agree with the values of his people, and that he saw the arkers as people too, which is why he helped Octavia when she needed his help. I don't think that story was specifically about Octavia, but to explain why he's different from the rest of the grounders in how he sees outsiders."
The100,34jxz0,Shotokanguy,2,Fri May 1 21:24:15 2015 UTC,"About Finn: First off, remember he's a teenager. I am willing to believe that Finn might have thought for a time that if he removed himself from the camp and the Arkers could honestly show that he had fled after learning about his fate, that the truce might still be able to happen. The fact that Clarke, the one who negotiated the truce, also seems to be on board with this idea only helps him believe this...for a time. He wants to live. He wants to pretend that he didn't do what he did, but he did.  Adrenaline and fear honestly change how you think. Self preservation is natural. I think the writers took a very honest story arc in showing how Finn came to the conclusion that escape was not an option. If he lived, many others would die--including the grounders they were planning to shoot at the dropship before he gave himself up. I think seeing Raven turn on Murphy was one of the things that pushed him over the edge and made him realize how desperate they were all being, and that there was only one choice to make to help those he loved from dying in an outright war. Then he did what he had to do to stop a war.  So, in the end...not such as asshole after all ;)"
The100,34jxz0,AmityN7,1 point,Sun May 3 06:36:43 2015 UTC,"Finn was trying to leave without anyone else involving themselves early in the episode. Then his friends tried helping him sneak out, but he eventually saw the pointlessness of it and gave himself up.  And yeah, Lincoln didn't really answer the question. But maybe he doesn't need to - he was willing to let the Arkers live from the get go, and he also happened to notice a girl who interested him."
The100,34j3d1,Amonette2012,9,Fri May 1 16:08:03 2015 UTC,"Tomorrow When The War Began - I've mentioned this one before as a book suggestion but there is also a movie. Kids go camping and wake up to find Australia has been invaded. Similar kids-to-soldiers character arcs.  Snowpiercer - The world got accidentally frozen by science and now everyone is trying to survive on a train that circles the globe  Ender's Game (again I've recommended the book before but the movie didn't make me throw things at the screen)  The Mad Max series, because if the desert scenes don't remind you of it then I'm gonna guess you haven't seen them and you should! I'm gonna throw Waterworld in here as well because it kind of reminds me of the Mad Max series and if you enjoy one you might enjoy the other.  Escape from New York/ Escape from LA - while I'm stretching the envelope slightly here, I think the films' setups are relevant enough. America is controlled by a draconian dictatorship and anyone who doesn't toe the line gets deported to a lawless city full of scary crazy people. One man is sent in to do important stuff and be a badass. Oldies but goodies and full of faces you'll recognize."
The100,34j3d1,west_haven,2,Fri May 1 16:55:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about Ender's Game. I first read the book in like, 2003, so I've read and reread it so much ever since. So when I finally saw the movie, I loved the visuals so much, but since it went so fast, it didn't quite have the full effect the book had on me originally. But I don't hate the movie at all; I think it's a great supplemental movie to the book, so everyone please read the book first."
The100,34j3d1,Amonette2012,2,Sat May 2 01:24:19 2015 UTC,"Supplemental is definitely the right word. At best I liked it, at worst I didn't hate it, but it's definitely too big a book for a movie. It was nice to be able to see it but it's no substitute for the book."

The survival themes are quite high in this one. Same goes for Interstellar, if a bit more loosely given that they're going away from Earth rather than onto it.    Just two thoughts."
The100,34j3d1,Amonette2012,2,Fri May 1 17:40:34 2015 UTC,I loved Snowpiercer. I thought Tilda Swinton was particularly good. Such a good character actress. Those teeth!
The100,34j3d1,vonotny,2,Fri May 1 17:59:27 2015 UTC,Tilda is insanely talented. This movie is not something that should be on our big list as it's not related but Only Lover's Left Alive was so bizarre and that is where I totally fell in love with her as an actor.

The100,34j3d1,Amonette2012,2,Fri May 1 20:01:29 2015 UTC,It's a vampire movie but one that is so gothic and strange you will either love or hate it. I watched the first half hour thinking wtf am I doing and by the end I was totally wishing it was at least another 2 hours.

Seriously though, Exoplanets with similar properties to Earth is exactly the reason I believe there are already other civilizations out there. Have they died out already? Maybe. Have they just started to develop? Who knows. But I refuse to believe Earth is the first and only planet with sentient life. I say sentient because bacteria have already been found on meteoroids.   But as it stands right now, it seems Earth is the most technologically  advanced planet out there, otherwise we'd have already seen others. See the Fermi Paradox  We'd probably have to develop SpaceStation Tech anyway to serve as a midpoint between Earth, the moon, and Mars. You know for refueling, resting, shuttle maintenance and the like.   But what I really want is a Dyson Sphere. A civilization in a given solar system being able to harness the complete power of its sun would no doubt be able to satisfy the energy needed to transit between its planets efficiently.

The100,34hcrk,Kishara,1 point,Fri May 1 20:24:49 2015 UTC,"The most recent discoveries on Mars are asking the serious question that perhaps life on earth originated on Mars or one of the other planets/moons and traveled to earth from there. It's so amazing that science fiction is now really being investigated.  The question about sentient life on other planets is such an interesting one. NGDT said a couple years ago that he feared even if such life existed that there would be a good chance we could not communicate with it. The extra-terrestrial life forms could be so far advanced from us as to make communication impossible. It could be the equivalent of  us trying to talk to ants and bacteria.   With the discovery of the Goldilocks planets and the rapid growth to that list, I just have to believe there is something out there that is more than just a rock with microbes on it. Why? Because I want to lol."
The100,34bd0b,thesteward,30,Wed Apr 29 20:12:35 2015 UTC,I wish they would show more about the logistics of wilderness survival and the kids trying to apply what environmental science/biology/geology they know. I loved the scene with Raven and Wick and the acid fog!
The100,34bd0b,uncatalyzed,9,Wed Apr 29 21:19:47 2015 UTC,"Same here.  Other than the panther, you never really see hunting or scavenging. The first episode makes it seem like finding food would be more of an issue (the whole ""we're miles away from our next meal"" line) but it never really comes up again. Even after their food hut burned down, it seemed like food wasn't much of a problem. And that's all right, I suppose, since the plot moves so quickly but it would've been cool to see more emphasis on survival and trying to find food."
The100,34bd0b,uncatalyzed,14,Wed Apr 29 23:22:40 2015 UTC,I'm hoping we get a good winter/everyone barely scraping through montage.
The100,34bd0b,queenbellevue,5,Thu Apr 30 00:15:42 2015 UTC,I wish they would've replaced the Finn/Clarke romance for some of this.

The100,34bd0b,PolarStHudson,18,Wed Apr 29 23:06:55 2015 UTC,They did a lot of stuff right. But one thing that I wish they did was keep Octavia with the grounders. I love her character being a grounder....

The100,34bd0b,Starbuck107,10,Thu Apr 30 00:49:49 2015 UTC,the writers mentioned they wernt going to give characters an easy way out when things got hard (how most shows save characters lives) but that jaha thing was a complete failure of that.  that capsule would have either broken apart on reentry due to age or slammed into the ground killing jaha inside.  they are not designed for soft landings or the transportation of people!

The100,34bd0b,PolarStHudson,3,Wed Apr 29 20:27:31 2015 UTC,I was extremely happy they killed I just hated his character and everything he did and stood for. Bellamy is a really dependable person and that's what Clark needs.
The100,34bd0b,Kishara,19,Wed Apr 29 20:52:07 2015 UTC,I was happy they killed Wells but not for that reason. To take out a main character that early on sent a message to the viewers. There are real consequences to their story. It's honest writing. Doing the unthinkable that soon into the series gave me a measure of trust in the writers I have not felt in a long time.

The100,34bd0b,isforwinrars,4,Fri May 8 18:55:35 2015 UTC,"Finn. Basically everything to do with him. I would have rathered Wells have his storyline. I think the romance thing would have made more sense and I would have cared more at its conclusion.   Kind of hate that there was little on-screen mourning for him.   And more earth skills stuff, just in general. More time in camp and dramas with keeping people in line or running things separate from the grounder issue, I mean but for a few instances with Murphy and that dude in day trip it was kinda of just 'oh Bellamy is king of the hill, no one fucks with him that's the system'.  Also wished they had further investigated the bunker in day trip or after, not necessarily for weapons, , it was gross or whatever but would have provided the 100 with more protection if they could clean it up and it seemed pretty large. Would beat a dropship, a wooden fence and some tents surely?  I know the show is faced paced but I also actually would have liked to see Clarke and the gang enjoy themselves for more than like ten minutes in that one scene unity day. I don't know, just wanted to see more interpersonal stuff without it being pre-empted by a disaster or some emergency, just what calm life was like in the camp for half an episode. Have people get drunk and bond over something other than survival. There were a few moments like that which I really enjoyed. Granted it would have slowed the pacing, and the pacing is something I enjoyed.  Everything after Finn died was flawless imo. No petty gripes."

The only one I can really believe is Octavia and Lincoln and even that one seems to be lacking some interpersonal interplay to solidify it. I'd like to believe more in Kyle Wick and Raven, but there are some missing parts there as well."
The100,34bd0b,ElenaOcean,9,Mon May 11 23:38:16 2015 UTC,"I like Kyle and Raven because it's sort of believable given the circumstances, but I do agree. I think the pace of the plot means that there's not much room for drawn out romantic build up and I always get the impression that Jason doesn't want to get sidetracked by it. I'm not a huge romance fan, but I do enjoy the build up to it. Once it happens though then it kinda flatlines because the anticipation is gone and your left with either introducing a third party, a baby, a breakup or a wedding and none of those things are as great as all those little ""when is this going to happen!"" moments."
The100,34bd0b,Kishara,5,Wed Apr 29 22:18:33 2015 UTC,Yeah the romances just leave me cold. They are probably intentionally trivial on the writers end because they don't want the focus moved off the crazy plot they have going. But it bugs me that they still want to incorporate them at all if there is not going to be enough development towards them. Either get them on some solid emotional ground or just skip them all together.   Anyhow it's just a minor complaint. I would not trade the insanely fast pace of the plot for it. Last thing I want to see on this show is for it to devolve into a soap opera or a shitty romance novel come to life.

It's easy to imagine there was romantic tension way back when.  Octavia and Lincoln was just boom they're in love. It is partially explainable by Octavia apparently being controlled by her hormones (sweetheart, I know you were literally raised in a windowless room, but no, one does not go around kissing people, it sends the wrong message, m'kay?) and having very little social skills, but still. She's never even seen an example of a normally functioning relationship. She should be such a fucked up character.  But it's a TV show and I suspend my disbelief. Because The 100."

The100,34bd0b,amornglor,3,Thu Apr 30 21:54:00 2015 UTC,"Season 2 ending.....I'm glad Clarke got to radiate everyone, but I wish there would have been a little more satisfying revenge in it all.  I was hoping that Jasper would go into Level 5 and shoot Cage right the fuck in the head, splattering his brains all over the school kids.   I understand they couldn't kill Cage until after they radiated everyone, though, since he was the only thing forcing their hand.  I just feel like no deaths were ever satisfying, which I guess is the point, but it's just too stressful.  I need to see someone die and enjoy it, just for a release.  The best and only vengeful death we've had was Dr. Singh."
The100,34bd0b,ShrivelTwitch,3,Tue May 5 10:11:12 2015 UTC,"I wish the writers focused more on why the Mountain Men should take the bone marrow from the Sky People. All the viewers were explicitly told was that they wanted to go to the ground. The ground is a magical place that very few people go to. It made it seem like the Mountain Men were just selfishly taking the bone marrow so they could go to the ground. There is a way more bigger impact. The main thing that happens is that they no longer would have to bleed the Grounders for their lives. The sacrifice of the Sky People would save probably hundreds of Grounders from being captured by the Reapers, and stop the Grounders from being mutated into reapers. Furthermore, the mountain men would no longer require that the Grounders to be weak. It was told in this season that the reason the Grounders don't use guns is because the Mountain Men would attack them if they would. The Mountain Men probably did this to keep the Grounders weak so they could still continue to bleed them. With bleeding becoming unnecessary, the Mountain Men could encourage the Grounders to actually prosper and use electricity and stuff like that. On a similiar vein, I don't remember if it was explicitly stated, but it is implied that the Mountain Men kept the 12 clans from forming 1 big clan to keep them weak from overtaking the Mountain. So the 12 clans could probably stick together. I believe that the Grounders understood this, which is the reason that they decided to ditch the Sky People.  What did President Wallace decide to do though? He wanted to keep killing the Grounders forever instead of killing all the Sky People once. In my opinion, stealing the bone marrow from the Sky People was more humane than continuing with bleeding Grounders. The writers did not focus on this, however, causing the Mountain Men to look like the bad guys to basically everyone."

Most byproducts of a nuclear detonation drop to levels tolerable to humans within two months.  2) How did Mount Weather survive the war? Command bunkers are in the first wave of targets in any nuclear exchange, and the Russians specifically built 20-25 megaton warheads that would turn Mount Weather into Lake Weather."

No one is alive to explain what happened, except perhaps the AI. It seems her creator thinks she 'got the launch codes'. So perhaps Mount Weather was not a target, because the foe was not military. Perhaps the radiation has been higher because that was intended.   The writers should have a huge binder of explanations, but they only tell us what comes up in the story, as it comes up."
The100,34bd0b,Vacatia,3,Fri May 1 05:40:57 2015 UTC,"I wish that Maya's blood would have somehow affected Jasper's so that he couldn't leave the mountain, and that he died with her in that room in a super poetic scene that wouldn't have made me very sad.

As a person who spends a lot of time hiking, I just laugh every time they go out into the wilderness in Season 1, find everything/one they're looking for, and NEVER get lost.  I also love how their little tents are impervious to acid fog. Go nylon! I mean, really? And even if they did work, wouldn't the acid get on them when they packed the tents back up?  There are a whole lot of things like that, but I shake them off because the storytelling is so great. Addressing everything would just bog the story down. The writers just need to decide where to trim the fat and focus where the meat is, and I think they've done an awesome job at that."

But Clarke's reaction to it was like ""No biggie"".  I would think she'd have thought, ""Wait...am I gay?"" or something.  I mean, given how naive she was about Wells and Finn, I wouldn't think she'd have that much romantic experience, and likely none with girls.  Instead, Clarke just went with is and after was like ""Wait a minute...I can't be in a relationship right now.  I'm grieving and about to fight a war!""  Maybe it says something about the nature of homosexual relationships on the Ark, but then if it were so commonplace, you'd think we'd have seen some same-sex action before."
The100,34bd0b,notfoxcompany,5,Sat May 2 20:20:21 2015 UTC,I think she already knew she was bi... I don't think she just completely threw away all of the feelings she had for men and was shocked that she was interested in women.

The100,34bd0b,notfoxcompany,0,Thu Apr 30 16:24:42 2015 UTC,People can know their sexuality without ever having been in a relationship.  Clarke could have been naive about relationships while still knowing who she is attracted to.

The same way we agreed to postings about Clexa for the poll we were asked by the show to promote.   Is the term alpha male really a redpill thing to you? I don't see it that way, but some of the newfangled verbiage I have been running into lately is often confusing for me.I could have missed some odd interpretation of what an alpha is this week.   Last I knew:  An alpha is the highest ranking male of a social group. Bellamy is our male alpha of The 100. Voting for Bob to help the show get some off season publicity does not feel to me like I am handing in my feminism card by any means."

That male characters are all great, no doubt. I'm not sure what that has to do with this tho? Bellamy is the  the male lead of the 100 faction and second only to Clarke in their social structure. Bob was singled out by E and added to the competition. That he managed to get to the semi-finals and take out the reigning champion is a really nice thing even if it was just a silly fan poll. It's great for the show to get this kind of publicity and gives a good idea of how much the fan base is growing. A healthy-sized fan base will keep the show on the air."

Aside from some silly dialogue, it was a pretty fine episode. They really did a great job establishing not only how Bellamy feels about Octavia, but what Octavia's life was like. Both of those elements are big components of the series - they influence Octavia's transformation into a Grounder and Bellamy's reasoning for wanting the lever pulled in the season 2 finale."

Also when Clarke and Anya escape, they escape the mountain by jumping off the dam.  Also, I think the lighthouse is meant to be directly north of Washington in Lake Ontario. Emori said ""north"" to Murphy after the Jaha disciples got captured, and the Delaware Bay is just too much east than north.  Excellent work though!"
The100,347sw2,WhoseRiverIsItAnyway,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:06:17 2015 UTC,yea the dam should be closer and the reason I placed the lighthouse so far east is because that is a 2 day trip from camp jaha...

In your map you could walk through the dead zone in 2 days or so? I think they would have to have walked something around a week in the dead zone, which leads me to the next point raised by /u/WhoseRiverIsItAnyway, the location of the lighthouse.  Emori did say 'north', but also stole all of their water and food, so they couldn't have made it more than a day, 2 if they're lucky in the desert. Which means they've had plenty of time to have gone east beforehand.  I read somewhere that  the solar farm could be Long Island Solar Farm, and that would put the lighthouse somewhere around New Haven. This is purely theoretical"
The100,347sw2,jorisimo11,1 point,Wed Apr 29 08:20:59 2015 UTC,when telling a story about groups that split up it becomes very difficult later on to have one group experience more time then the other because then you would have to focus entirely on one group to get them caught up if they were to ever meet back up so that's why I figured they spent two days in the deadlands. but yea the deadlands should be bigger I just don't know how big so i didn't make it any bigger then it needed to be.  :|

I can imagine it would only be available to the citizens of the wealthier/powerful stations like the phoenicians (Like I doubt it was something that octavia/bellamys mum was just rolling around with) and as to clothes, most of the arkers had clothes in bad repair, holes etc during the arc scenes in season 1 (Abbys wardrobe for instance) with the possible exception of the guard which seemed pretty well dressed I'd imagine people patching up and reusing their ordinary clothes over a long period of time, with people trading stuff lile fabric et  and stuff in better repair (ie; suits, dresses etc) would have been heirlooms and stuff worn only occasionally. I think they did a pretty solid job of making the situation on the arc believable, I mean in flashbacks you see even kids like Wells and Clarke's clothes arent in brand new comdition or anything. Thats my opinion anyway, hope it helps, personally I think the showrunners and wardrobe depr did a pretty solid job in terms of this type of continuity."

The mountain men refuse to let her leave, and if they're as good as you believe then they should let her go willingly. Sure, the rest of them want to stay, but the 100 didn't fight to stay on the ground to go from one prison to another.  There's also that huge room full of grounders to consider. What kind of purpose do they serve? The fact that the cages are so small, that the prisoners look so weak and dirty should key you in on how shady the mountain men are."

They are evil and by the end I was literally yelling at the screen...KILL EM'!  The fact of the matter is that Clarke trusted her gut and knew something wasn't right.  Sometimes you just have to trust your gut and in this case she was more than right.  I also don't consider the Grounders to be at war with Mt. Weather.  to be at war means you are fighting.  The moutain men aren't fighting anyone they are stuck in that mountain, sealed away from the rest of the world.  Beside the grounders can't even get close to Mt.

The100,341bpp,ElenaOcean,9,Mon Apr 27 15:05:13 2015 UTC,"I have the unpopular opinion of not minding Finn, I quite like how he was set up to be Bellamy's opposite and was the stereotypical ""heart throb"" character who took a tragic turn. I get why he was written out though and whatever didn't work with Finn's character the writers sure managed to turn it around and give him a gut wrenching and spectacular demise that impacted the characters we do love, so they deserve credit for that. They could have taken the easy way out but they chose to make him important to propelling the story forward and in the end his death did amazing things for Raven and Clarke's character development.   Ironically Finn's love wasn't just his weakness, it was also a horribly destructive force. Actually I think I already sprung my analogy on you about that storyline Kish :P"
The100,341bpp,ElenaOcean,2,Mon Apr 27 17:12:33 2015 UTC,"So eloquently put Elena <3 I did not hate Finn either, rather is was a frustration that the character needed to be more complete. But perhaps that was intentional? There are loads of dependent personalities in the world, if the goal was to write Finn as one they achieved that."
The100,341bpp,wwhideanseek,6,Mon Apr 27 17:15:43 2015 UTC,"As you know I got my own thesis going on about the show ""rewriting history"". I'd like to think that Finn was a cautionary tale about how survival is the top priority. Finn let his emotions cloud all his judgments and he also made the mistake of not being a realist. He ""loved"" the idea of Clarke without actually seeing her for what she is - not the princess who needs rescuing. He didn't think about what she would want him to do and he didn't have faith that she could keep herself alive. So their whole relationship on his end was Romeo/Juliet star-crossed lovers...but in this version Juliet is smart enough not to throw away her chance at life over a fleeting romance.   Clarke doesn't just end Finn's suffering when she kills him, she also sets herself free from the suffering Finn was causing her with his ""love""."
The100,341bpp,bellaflecking,18,Mon Apr 27 17:31:19 2015 UTC,"What do I dislike about him?  Literally everything. Literally.  Should Finn have died so early?  NO, earlier."

The100,341bpp,SecondClass-,9,Tue Apr 28 23:33:38 2015 UTC,"Good riddance to this character. I disliked him from the beginning when he unbuckled from his seat as the dropship was falling to the Earth. One of the only good things I can say about Finn is that he was a much more effective main character death than Wells. Wells had just three episodes before he was killed so he may as well have just been credited as a guest star. And while the show did make a point to build up Wells' relationship with Clarke, the impact of his death on Clarke was bungled. The writers did a much better job on making that impact clear with Finn's death.  While I really disliked his unearned smugness in the first season, I just didn't believe in the authenticity of Finn's PTSD arc. The execution by both the writers and the actor lacked subtlety and nuance (which is a continuing problem for the actor). And as arihadne noted in their comment, PTSD was more effectively and more economically explored through Jasper.  But for all my criticism of everything regarding Finn, I do appreciate what the writers tried to do with the character in the first half of the second season, even if it wasn't executed very well at all, particularly by the actor (until ""Spacewalker""). They tried to invert Finn's character, turning him from douchy pacifist to douchy war criminal, which might have worked if the actor wasn't so wooden and ineffective.  ""Spacewalker"" was one of the best episodes of the series, despite the fact that it was a (pseudo-)Finn-centric* episode. *Finn functions more as a tool than an actual character in the episode, the purpose of which is to force Clarke into making a pivotal character decision, and perhaps to give new light to the motivations of the character leading up to that episode.  It could be argued that ""Spacewalker"" reveals that Finn's defining characteristic is that he's willing to do any reckless, myopic, idiotic thing for the sake of what he thinks is love. We saw that in the flashbacks when he sent Raven on a spacewalk, got caught, and offered to take the blame for it. And we saw that earlier in the season when he massacred 18 villagers to find Clarke. Finn thinks himself valiant for doing these things. He did it all for love! However, Raven would've never been in that situation were it not for Finn, and she would've gotten to do spacewalks anyway had they waited a tiny bit longer. The consequence of Finn's action is that he wasted three months worth of oxygen, which in hindsight would've prevented the culling. And Clarke never even needed saving. Instead, Clarke had to waste time trying to save Finn from the Grounders when they could've been focusing on infiltrating Mount Weather and saving the remaining 100. When Clarke stumbles upon Finn who has just massacred a village, Thomas McDonell's crazed line reading of ""I found you"" (the actor's most effective line reading of the series. Though, to be clear, he didn't.) was given further resonance after ""Spacewalker."" Finn isn't just a fool for love, it's a pathology for him.  To sum up, I admire what the writers tried to do with Finn, but fuck that guy."

The100,341bpp,arihadne,5,Sun May 10 10:41:39 2015 UTC,"At first I didn't mind Finn. Yes he was the stereotypical heartthrob or whatever but I thought he and Clarke had an okay amount of chemistry. I didn't think he was ""heroic"" so much as idealistic (all the talk about peace and such, which just couldn't happen).   Then the whole Raven thing started and from then on I saw him as a hypocritical douche. It's like he didn't even give a shit about Raven. Even when she came down he was STILL making googly eyes at Clarke while being with Raven.   At that point I wasn't a fan of Bellamy or Murphy either but they both recognized their doucheyness while Finn was still portrayed as some kind of forlorn lovesick puppy.   Then the massacre. I felt zero empathy for him. It's like Clarke said to charlotte: you don't kill someone else to make yourself feel better. If those villagers were holding Clarke somewhere then it would've made more sense, but they were literally innocent bystanders."

They didn't really set up his PTSD very well? I mean, we all got it with Jasper, but there didn't seem to be anything hinting that Finn was going through his own personal brand of it. More development for him would've been nice, especially since they seemed to cram it all into Spacewalker."

It's probably why I didn't trust him for the first couple episodes of Season 1.  But I agree with you there. It was a big jump over a short period of time. Finn knew exactly what he was doing, knew exactly what he did, and just seemed to be fine with it. ""I accept the consequences of my actions of which I was aware of."" There wasn't conflict with Finn. Conflict was with everyone else in relation to Finn.  Don't get me wrong, I like Finn. He was cool. But then Spacewalker and the episodes just before it kinda made him drop off the list. On the up side, Murphy went up on it."
The100,341bpp,skeleton-ships,4,Tue Apr 28 09:03:08 2015 UTC,"He was one of my favorite characters. Don't understand what so many people didn't like about him. He was just a genuinely good guy. He looked out for people from the beginning.  I also felt his development was natural. Part of it might be because I binge watched this show up to 2x08 when I first became a fan. I didn't have to wait weeks between episodes or months between seasons to see everything Finn had been through in a short time. It felt natural when he started to interrogate that Grounder in the bunker and his voice was strained with desperation. I didn't see a character who had suddenly turned into someone else, I just saw Finn doing worse things.  Character development is discussed a lot in talking about TV shows, but I often feel like we don't look at it realistically. It shouldn't happen noticeably for every character. And characters shouldn't always act one way.  However you felt about Finn, his death was tragic. What he did deserved punishment, but was death the only way? It was for peace with the Grounders, but you can't help but wonder if he could've atoned for everything if he had lived a long life. I'm sure he wouldn't have just carried on, moping and allowing the guilt to weigh on him. He would've tried to do something with his life."
The100,341bpp,corinthian_llama,1 point,Mon Apr 27 22:57:39 2015 UTC,"I completely agree! I think that Finn did deserve to be punished for what he did (it frustrates me to no end the way that none of the Sky People seem to think this and they keep letting him walk around like nothing happened). The Sky People didn't have any right to deny the Grounders what they felt was justice, but at the same time I wish that justice had been served a different way.   The whole time I was watching his arc in season 2, I kept waiting for the breaking point where he would stop being so numb/in shock and would have to deal with what he did. He would have been mopey and guilty for a little while, but I think he would have ultimately tried to atone for his crimes. I have a headcanon that if he had lived, he would have helped in infiltrating Mount Weather and would have set all of the Grounders in there free."
The100,341bpp,MeropeRedpath,3,Fri May 1 01:46:52 2015 UTC,"Finn didn't suddenly change into a terrible person. What happened to him could have happened to anyone. He panicked in a tense stand-off when people started running at him. He's not used to an automatic weapon and a lot of bullets came out very rapidly.   Afterwards, Finn can't get it straight in his mind what went down. He thinks of himself as a good guy, and he was the most moral person in the group. Now he's a mass killer. He's in shock.  In the end, he turns himself over for torture and death to save the rest.   When Clarke was forced to kill him it was the worst possible thing she could experience. So, a big part of her arc."
The100,341bpp,manicmelancholic,2,Mon Apr 27 19:57:19 2015 UTC,"I feel the writers dropped the ball with Finn. They couldn't be perfect all the time I guess... Finn never really grew as a character, he was the stereotypical bad boy with secrets and a good heart. IMO, he was the perfect teenage heartthrob... and that's not a good thing.  I thought his brutal change to mass murderer was a bit too much to take, but actually if the show writers had given us a good reason behind his practically immediate fury over not finding Clarke, it would have been completely believable and would have made him a much more well-rounded character.  He wasn't killed too soon, but he might have had a lot of potential had he been allowed to live. Thomas portrayed him quite well throughout, and I'd lay the blame for being an unlikable character at the feet of the writers, not the actor's.  His death, in any case, did make me sad, and the writers did do a good job there."
The100,341bpp,alphachair,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:05:15 2015 UTC,"I never was the biggest fan of Finn. Unfortunately the whole love triangle thing made him annoying to most people. I think in the end his death was perfect. I was JUST starting to warm up to Finn during Space Walker and then... splish! They made his character interesting to me this season, which was his biggest downfall in season one. I mean before he went coocoo for coco puffs he was kind of boring.   Anyway from a realistic perspective it's good the writers explored Finn's darker potential. He was only a kid so naturally everything he saw would mess him up. I think it's unrealistic more people didn't lose it like Finn did - considering how much they've all been through.   Great show. Great death. And after the first season with barely anyone liking Finn it's pretty interesting how the writers made his death so bitter sweet."
The100,341bpp,AdrienI,1 point,Mon Apr 27 15:35:32 2015 UTC,"I wish they hadn't shown Finn being flirty in the pilot. I think that's one of the key reasons why I never really bought his love for Clarke. Also, since his ""spacewalker"" charge was bogus (he was just covering for Raven), then his actions on the ship don't make any sense.  As far as his death, I think they would've had trouble continuing him as the story went on, especially regarding Clarke's journey."

The100,3446un,Wxlson,-10,Tue Apr 28 05:02:09 2015 UTC,Glass has no meaningful effect on the feeling of sunlight.
The100,3446un,Wxlson,12,Tue Apr 28 05:08:37 2015 UTC,Yes but you aren't feeling it how 99.9% of humanity felt it
The100,3446un,Wxlson,-12,Tue Apr 28 07:45:22 2015 UTC,"You probably are, but she wouldn't know the difference."
The100,3446un,ginfish,16,Tue Apr 28 08:11:40 2015 UTC,"She's just simply saying she's never felt the sun on her face, I don't understand the problem here"
The100,3446un,Shotokanguy,-10,Tue Apr 28 08:41:12 2015 UTC,The problem is she obviously has.
The100,3446un,Shotokanguy,13,Tue Apr 28 08:46:16 2015 UTC,Soaking in the sun through a glass window compared to standing on bare earth with nothing in the way is MUCH different.
The100,3446un,Jay013,-7,Tue Apr 28 09:22:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is, but she probably does which is why she longs for something she thinks is somehow special."
The100,3446un,Jay013,3,Tue Apr 28 09:32:55 2015 UTC,"I suppose there's a world of difference between feeling the sun on your face while sitting in the grass on a nice sunny day in summer... and feeling the sun on your face while peering at it through a glass, in the darkness of space."
The100,3446un,Jay013,16,Tue Apr 28 12:00:16 2015 UTC,You also wouldn't feel the warmth. I'm pretty sure that's the main idea.
The100,3446un,Jay013,-9,Tue Apr 28 04:31:52 2015 UTC,"She'd feel more warmth than on Earth because there would be no atmosphere shielding her from sunlight.     Without thermal controls, the temperature of the orbiting Space Station's Sun-facing side would soar to 250 degrees F (121 C)   http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast21mar_1/"
The100,3446un,SilentSniper646,12,Tue Apr 28 04:35:51 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah...I'm assuming they have ways of controlling the temperature. Especially since the Ark is more advanced than the ISS."
The100,3446un,poopeepoo,-2,Tue Apr 28 05:33:19 2015 UTC,"Definitely, though it seems like the whole thing is in pretty bad shape.  Still, direct sunlight through windows is going to be felt.  Turning the air conditioner on in your car doesn't block the sun."
The100,3446un,Amonette2012,10,Tue Apr 28 08:47:29 2015 UTC,"No she wouldn't. On space stations, everything is shielded. On the Ark, I'm guessing more so due to individual designs of each space station to harbor human life for over-extended periods of time. The shielding, added with that of climate control, would keep the ark at a cool 20C-25C give or take, optimal for human life and comfort.  Now you factor in the sun. You said glass has no meaningful effect on feeling sunlight, but it actually does. Glass can be engineered to have different effects on sunlight. Due to the lack of atmosphere and needed purpose of the space stations, this glass would no doubt be engineered to handle the sunlight without an atmosphere. Everything is engineered to withstand the onslaught of solar radiation. Even on our space stations today.  So how would the sun feel? Constant. On Earth, how you ""feel"" the sun depends on the season. Summers it's more intense, winters it more spread out due to its angle. But on the Ark it would feel like if you held an above average flashlight on your hand in a cool room.  Also, account for the actual amount of windows, size of windows, that may be on the Ark, and amount of places Clarke has access to. It becomes more probable that she hasn't felt the sun on her face.  Of course, I'm not a sun scientist. So, no exact answers here."
The100,3446un,BysshePlease,-4,Tue Apr 28 08:54:34 2015 UTC,"It seems like a stretch.  There were several space stations forming the ark, and windows seemed common enough.  The first thing Octavia does when she's free is run to a communal window and look out at the Moon.  I don't think ""the sun on my face"" would be a sensible thing for someone in a space station to long for."
The100,3446un,queenbellevue,7,Tue Apr 28 09:12:07 2015 UTC,"windows seemed common enough.   ""Common"" windows wouldn't be optimal for life in space. Or last long. First off, you'd need to use a glass that's resistant to thermal shock, and stress. The ISS's cupola module uses windows made with borosilicate glass. Also, seeing the moon and feeling sunlight are two different things. Again, the glass, specially designed to withstand the gauntlet of incoming solar radiation for an over-extended period of time, will dilute the feeling of sunlight. Also, you need to account for tinting on the windows. Cause in space, you can't look at the sun. You know how when your parents say not to look at the sun on Earth? Well, in space if you look at the sun, you're lucky you know what everything worth seeing already looks like. Lack of atmosphere, means the light is more 'intense' than if refracted and reflected by our atmosphere.  EDIT: In case you need more: NASA's page.  Specifically   The small, dome-shaped module has seven windows -- six around the sides and one on top -- that can be shuttered when not in use to protect them from micrometeoroids and the harsh space environment. The windows are made of fused silica and borosilicate glass panes, with temperature-sensing elements and window heaters.    Since there's no reason anyone on the Ark needs to be observing the immediate area, I'm guessing most windows are shuttered and really only used for special events like, say...A Moonlight Masquerade in order to create an ambiance with the moonlight. That affects the light even more so than just the glass."
The100,3446un,Shotokanguy,-1,Tue Apr 28 09:23:46 2015 UTC,I doubt the show conforms much to space station safety protocols.  There have been several instances of characters looking out unshuttered windows.  Clarke's cell had a window.  Her mom looked out it when she was put inside.  And she and Jaha saw the rocket flares through it.
The100,3446un,Nerazeal,3,Tue Apr 28 09:32:13 2015 UTC,"You do realize not all shutters need to completely block out light, just protect the glass behind it?  A fibreglass covering can get the job done. Doesn't even have to be engineered for solar radiation since its the glass that does the work."
The100,3446un,coffeeknight,-1,Tue Apr 28 09:36:00 2015 UTC,"I thought we were talking about penetration of sunlight, not simply protecting the glass.  If the shutter doesn't block out the sunlight, then the sunlight gets through and thus she feels it on her face regardless of the existence of the shutter."
The100,3446un,omid-7,5,Tue Apr 28 09:37:54 2015 UTC,"We're talking about the feeling of sunlight. Which can be diluted by just about anything transparent/luscent.   Has she had the sun on her face? Maybe. Has she ""felt"" it? Probably not. The ""feeling"" of sunlight is just thermal radiation. Dilute the sun's rays enough and you won't even feel it unless you stood there absorbing enough of it like a plant.  Plus ambient temperatures."
The100,3446un,Dikeleos,-4,Tue Apr 28 09:43:27 2015 UTC,"Probably not.   Maybe.  Maybe not.  Either way, she hasn't felt the sun on her face on Earth, so she has nothing to compare it to anyway.  She's only assuming it would be different, and it could be and it might not be.  I think given that the sun would be plenty familiar to her, it's an odd choice for something sentimental for her to long for.  The ""floating in water"" made more sense to me, and we get a nice moment of her doing just that and enjoying it, whereas she's been exposed to sunlight for some time now and hasn't taken a moment to soak it in."
The100,33zpwi,LucidShady,23,Mon Apr 27 03:33:53 2015 UTC,"Orphan Black. It has strong female leads, science, mystery, action, and clones!"
The100,33zpwi,vangoghsl3ftear,25,Mon Apr 27 12:05:48 2015 UTC,"Go watch battlestar gallicatica right now. If you haven't already seen it. Basic premise is humans are near extinction after the cylons robots they created almost wiped them. The surviving humans live on a spacecraft looking for a home called earth while trying to escape the cylons :)   EDIT: just to clarify I'm talking about the BSG remake from the 2000s not the original. The original is good but the low budget and single season don't really make it worth watching. Definitely watch the remake though, and all the movies that come with it!"
The100,33zpwi,manicmelancholic,7,Mon Apr 27 03:40:37 2015 UTC,"I second BSG. I went in with low expectations, and it has its highs and lows (like any show), but in the end, it blew my mind. Love it!"
The100,33zpwi,VGBAMF,4,Mon Apr 27 05:07:07 2015 UTC,The ending to the series was a solid 10/10 in my book. Best ending I have seen in a long long time.
The100,33zpwi,yyy4401,3,Mon Apr 27 05:56:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I still think of it, and it's been how many years? That's good storytelling! I am SO hoping The 100 stays at the level it's at and keeps on rising to a conclusion on par."

The100,33zpwi,manicmelancholic,0,Mon Apr 27 17:32:02 2015 UTC,"How can you find the BSG ending good? It was full of religion, superstition and confusion? Especially Kara. A little bit like Lost."
The100,33zpwi,cyrusol,6,Mon Apr 27 10:36:15 2015 UTC,It ended on a good note. It wrapped up all the main plot points.   The religious bit I was fine with because it gave something to think about without any lose ends.
The100,33zpwi,yyy4401,3,Mon Apr 27 10:38:28 2015 UTC,"BSG had strong ""religious"" tons from the very start. I really liked that aspect because it added to the FICTIONAL universe. I might not be spiritual but that doesn't mean I can't find a story good just because the characters have religion. If BSG wasn't sci fi then sure the ending would be silly, but bsg was a TV show with an amazing fictional universe that just so happens to have some sort of God. The ending made sense. It's not like they pulled out a bible and said ""this is exactly what will happen in the future"". They were just telling a story with religious undertones :)"
The100,33zpwi,manicmelancholic,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:33:37 2015 UTC,"The original BSG was loosely based on Mormon theology, so the religion isn't so far out of left field."

The100,33zpwi,lefthandofjhereg,11,Mon Apr 27 13:41:50 2015 UTC,Can't really think of anything similar to this show. The most similar show I can think of is Lost. Great show if you haven't watched it already!
The100,33zpwi,AreYouDeadYet9,3,Mon Apr 27 04:21:56 2015 UTC,Second this.
The100,33zpwi,KingKolder,4,Tue Apr 28 00:30:04 2015 UTC,"Going to offer another recommendation to the amazing Battlestar Galactica. Currently making my way through the fourth season and love it. You'll notice a few familiar actors cropping up as well. Orphan Black as pointed out below is another great choice, with the actress Tatiana Maslany superb. 12 Monkeys on SyFY is also another one that I'd throw in there as well."
The100,33zpwi,Milo_BOK,4,Mon Apr 27 12:35:15 2015 UTC,"Torchwood, maybe. Jericho. Firefly."
The100,33zpwi,letsgofriday,8,Mon Apr 27 12:39:43 2015 UTC,"The Walking Dead is alright. Not as good, but similar themes. Most recent season is fabulous and makes it worth sitting through the slow/low budget times at the prison."
The100,33zpwi,theloudestshoutout,6,Mon Apr 27 05:28:29 2015 UTC,"Prison times ruined the series for nearly all of my friends. They won't try it again, no matter how good Terminus was and the series currently is."
The100,33zpwi,cyrusol,3,Mon Apr 27 10:38:41 2015 UTC,"Well they were following the comic for the prison arc and realized it was shit, so they made up terminus. That might be why you think it was great, it was new and created specifically to appeal to the show audience (and way more interesting than what was going on in the comic)"
The100,33zpwi,iLeo,3,Mon Apr 27 15:08:50 2015 UTC,"Another vote for Orphan Black. The writing, character development, and plot are all top notch, but the biggest dose of awesome is Tatiana Maslany. The fact that she plays all of the main characters and you don't really notice is mind blowing.  Also, although The Last Ship is a lot less of a sci-fi show and is almost entirely plot driven rather than character driven, I blew through the first season in two days. As a survival story in a world suffering from a catastrophic pandemic, it's highly entertaining."
The100,33zpwi,displacedpensfan,3,Tue Apr 28 00:33:19 2015 UTC,"I watched an interview with Tatiana Maslany talking about Cosima and Delphine, and I was like, how does Sarah know about Cosima's motivations and feelings/why are they asking her? And it took me a good minute before I remembered, she IS Cosima too. That's how good she is at differentiating the characters. It's crazy."

The100,33zpwi,mintyspace,2,Tue Apr 28 00:37:23 2015 UTC,"There is a British show called ""Outcasts"" that was pretty good. Only one season of a few episodes but it follows the same concept with the 100. Survival of the human race on another planet that they know nothing about. Lots of plot twists!!  It's a good watch!"
The100,33zpwi,1D10Terror,2,Mon Apr 27 17:46:11 2015 UTC,YMMV. I just binged on two seasons The 100 last week. I enjoyed it. I didn't see Carnivàle mentioned in this list. Great show.

The100,33zpwi,chocochao,2,Sun May 3 17:49:23 2015 UTC,"I find that The 100 is a very similar show to Lost in that the characters do their best to survive in an unfamiliar landscape. Lost ends with more questions than answers, and while the ending is controversial, it's not a reason to pass on this amazing show.   If you have Netflix it's on instant streaming."

We are currently designing /r/WaywardPines and getting ready for the series to air. If you have not seen that pilot, omg go stream it. It's totally insane.   I'm kinda bummed Bob did not make it thru to the finals. Outlander is currently airing and they were mighty opponents. We got them to 47.7% and they crushed us to the ground with one FB post.

The100,33z9gc,thechesapeakeripper,6,Mon Apr 27 01:03:35 2015 UTC,"If you saw episode 3, you should've heard it straight from Clarke. Wells was willing to take the blame so she didn't have to be angry with her own mother."
The100,33z9gc,Shotokanguy,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:06:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, sorry I should have made this more clear. I know that he took the blame so that she wouldn't be upset with her mother.   But why would he take that moment, as they are landing on earth, to say sorry for supposedly telling on her father?   Why is he apologizing when he knows that she already knows/assumed that he is the one who told? Was he really expecting forgiveness?  Or, it is possible that he did not think they were going to make the landing, that they were in danger of dying, but then why would he take their last moment to apologize for something he didn't do?  I guess my question isn't really a big deal lol, but it just doesn't really add up"
The100,33z9gc,Shotokanguy,7,Mon Apr 27 02:04:25 2015 UTC,"I guess you have to look at it from the other angle - he wouldn't use possibly his final moments with her to say ""Oh BTW, it was actually your mom who betrayed your father.""  He was a good friend."
The100,33z9gc,Risaga54,3,Mon Apr 27 02:14:51 2015 UTC,I'm assuming that they never got a chance to talk in between. Clarke got put in lockup pretty quickly and probably didn't want to talk to him at all.
The100,33z9gc,omarirevolution,5,Mon Apr 27 05:06:44 2015 UTC,"Saw this post and didn't read what sub it was from and clicked it assuming it was about The Flash.  But yeah, Wells did this in order to draw the blame away from Clarke's mother."
The100,33wr69,ShaneH7646,2,Sun Apr 26 10:50:46 2015 UTC,"Day 0 of exile  Freinds and enemies had been made, anger had risen between who I had thought were allies, /u/amonette2012 had learned off my plans and spoke with the other leaders, the decision had been made I was to be exiled. It was only 10 minutes after they learned of my daring plan when /u/Shotokanguy , /u/wwhideanseek , /u/Jay013 and /u/kishara came and told me to pack my bag, /u/kishara being the nice guy he is slipped a knife and a small bag of food into my bag, the others then threw me out off the main gate and I wondered away from camp...  Day 1 of exile   I had walked to the nearby river to stock up on water i would need for the week and set up camp for the night, I was awoken early in the morning to something in the trees, I knew i wasnt safe and had to find shelter soon  Day 3 of exile  I had managed to find a small bunker near the camp and some berries to last me another day, but my food and water supply was running low, the bunker had a single bed and some cupboards and a stove that nolonger worked, I placed a frying pan i had found in the bunker outside the bunkers doors hoping for rain non came   Day 5 of exile   I was again awoken by a mysterious noise coming from the bunker entrance, I quickly grabbed my knife and rushed to the door. The door swung open... it was /u/Kishara ! <3 ,we spoke for a while as we ate the food he had brought me, I learn that the peace talks had resulted in peace, /u/kishara left soon after to not raise suspicion in the camp  Day 6 of exile  I prepared my things to return to camp and said my final farewell to the bunker I had called home, I walk to the river to stock up on water before I return  Day 7 of exile : The return   I return to the camp with a bag full off water supplies, I learn off the camps water problems and still being angry from being exiled I decide to keep the water to myself"
The100,33wr69,Kishara,3,Sun Apr 26 15:46:08 2015 UTC,"Omg hun this is adorable <3  So for the water, I don't blame you but I am going to put you to work so you can get full redemption. After all your bombs actually helped save us as the Grounders think they will be useful.   We are going to build a water supply. First thing we need is to develop  holding Tanks. Now that you have wandered around awhile I am guessing you found some salvage metal and perhaps some metal drums. We need those hauled to camp. Can you do this  if we enlist /u/Jay013 and /u/Shotokanguy to help drag them back to base camp?"
The100,33wr69,Jay013,3,Sun Apr 26 15:55:45 2015 UTC,"Welcome back.   So we're allied with the Grounders now. Obviously it'll take a while for me to trust you with boomsticks but if you feel like you can stop yourself from assassinating the Heda, welcome back.  I feel like we should quarantine you for at least a day because of the Murphy Virus (the thing Murphy was infected with in I Am Become Death) but we are allies with the Grounders now so...."
The100,33wr69,PolarStHudson,2,Sun Apr 26 16:11:13 2015 UTC,Quarantine would have been a good idea but I think /u/Kishara has decided to just go for it and put him to work though! As he hasn't actually come into contact with anyone outside of our camp in his time away I think we're probably safe.
The100,33wr69,Kishara,2,Sun Apr 26 16:23:59 2015 UTC,We can never be to sure. Myabe we should go ahead and quarantine him anyway.
The100,33wr69,PolarStHudson,3,Sun Apr 26 16:34:03 2015 UTC,I had already sneaked off  to Shane's exile camp earlier. So I know he is fine and did not get any kind of infection :)
The100,33wr69,ElenaOcean,2,Sun Apr 26 16:37:37 2015 UTC,"I suggest we let it slide on this occasion, but next time perhaps we should quarantine people."
The100,33wr69,Kishara,2,Sun Apr 26 16:40:33 2015 UTC,Im going to keep a close eye on him and note anyone he comes into contact to
The100,33wr69,ElenaOcean,2,Sun Apr 26 16:52:54 2015 UTC,Well I guess thanks for not bringing a plague back with you!
The100,33wr69,Kishara,2,Sun Apr 26 15:48:19 2015 UTC,I wanna point out that I was not part of the leg breaking lynch mob and that I value you your ballsy attitude. So when the grounders turn on us you're still welcome in my hideout. Hope you like crab cakes!
The100,33wr69,Shotokanguy,3,Sun Apr 26 17:32:23 2015 UTC,It's official then. We are taking /u/ShaneH7646 on for our micro-alliance.  He has bomb-making skills and he is pleasant to be around. It's a win.
The100,33wr69,Jay013,3,Sun Apr 26 18:15:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't wanna be murdered if Shane decides to pull a Murphy."
The100,33wr69,Jay013,3,Sun Apr 26 18:37:55 2015 UTC,"Haha! I think it was just a misunderstanding. I dont trust Grounders as far as I can throw them and I did not blame Shane for wanting to take an extreme measure. But now that we have this shaky alliance with them, we need Shane back into the fold 100%. He is a valuable member of the group and his skills are really needed."
The100,33wr69,wwhideanseek,2,Sun Apr 26 18:41:04 2015 UTC,I'm disappointed in both of you.
The100,33wr69,Jay013,2,Sun Apr 26 21:47:00 2015 UTC,"Don't worry bro, I got you.  Note: I suggested a choice between exile or Shoto's leg-breaking. Granted I taught Shane to make the bombs as well..."
The100,33wr69,wwhideanseek,3,Mon Apr 27 04:59:33 2015 UTC,"Just how bloodthirsty are we? Cause if there's a water shortage...  Seriously though. Short term fix would be to send people to collect water every 6 hours. Build a basin to place that water in. Actually, build a big enough collection basin and we'd only need to send people what, once a day? Maybe less?  A long term fix would be to divert a small section of the river towards the stream. It'll take a good amount of manpower to dig a path from the stream to the river. Not the other way around because we need to be able to control the initial flow of water. Starting stream side gives us time to calculate and plan out the path of our extended stream. Because we don't want flooding come rainy season."
The100,33wr69,Jay013,2,Sun Apr 26 15:14:06 2015 UTC,"We would have to build a really big basin and send a LOT of people.  But your river 'diversion' idea is similar to the irrigation ditch/channel i proposed, maybe this combined with the Basin would work?"
The100,33wr69,Jay013,2,Sun Apr 26 15:27:25 2015 UTC,Stored water plus open source. It's the best solution really. Let's do it.  grabs shovel
The100,33wr69,Milo_BOK,2,Sun Apr 26 16:15:37 2015 UTC,Looks like we got a solution.  wonders where /u/Jay013 got the shovel
The100,33wr69,Jay013,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:28:16 2015 UTC,Good point. /u/Jay013 must account for the shovel. Was that in your original pack? If not please share your shovel creation idea so we can make more!
The100,33wr69,Jay013,2,Sun Apr 26 16:42:34 2015 UTC,"Take a tree branch about an inch and a half in diameter,use a knife to remove bark, and some scrap metal cut in a spade shape. Punch some holes in to the metal to make room for some lashing.  make a cut into the wood on one end of the stave, down the center, to slide the spade into. Secure with lashing. I hope people know what I mean by on one end. I mean on like the tip side of the stave."
The100,33wr69,Kishara,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:27:24 2015 UTC,"Brilliant. Knock up another twenty of those would you? Just enlist some of these red hats we have knocking about the place, and if they get a bit uppity just mention that you heard /u/arihadne mention that broken clavicles are really painful!"
The100,33wr69,wwhideanseek,2,Sun Apr 26 17:32:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, where is she anyway? Hasn't been around in a while.   Welp. Off to recruit some sla- entusiastic workers."
The100,33wr69,Kishara,2,Sun Apr 26 17:50:22 2015 UTC,"Volunteers as a partially enthusiastic worker, but has an old walkman with older music to listen too whilst working on building the shovels."
The100,33wr69,wwhideanseek,1 point,Sun Apr 26 20:18:22 2015 UTC,Looks like we'll be needing an engineering plan here!
The100,33wr69,Kishara,3,Sun Apr 26 15:49:39 2015 UTC,Oh Raaaaveeen!
The100,33wr69,Jay013,2,Sun Apr 26 16:16:07 2015 UTC,"You mean Wick, he's the engineer - Raven is more of a mechanic."
The100,33wr69,ElenaOcean,3,Sun Apr 26 16:22:07 2015 UTC,Yeah but she's proven that she can do both.
The100,33wr69,ElenaOcean,2,Sun Apr 26 16:27:46 2015 UTC,This is true.
The100,33wr69,ElenaOcean,2,Sun Apr 26 16:29:08 2015 UTC,Someone call for an engineering plan? I can help with that :)
The100,33wr69,ElenaOcean,3,Sun Apr 26 16:36:16 2015 UTC,Well we either have to chop down and hollow out some trees or dig a water ditch/channel.
The100,33wr69,wwhideanseek,2,Sun Apr 26 16:54:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I brought the plans down from the ship because I knew I did not have the knowledge myself. I am thinking that it will have to be a combination of digging and hollowing out trees. /u/ShaneH7646's bombs can be really helpful if we need to blast out some areas as well.
The100,33wr69,Jay013,2,Sun Apr 26 17:01:10 2015 UTC,"We will definitely have to contact the Grounders, if we want to blow up bombs in their area. Would be a shame if our newfound ""peace"" was destroyed by that.  But yeah a combination sounds good."
The100,33wr69,Kishara,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:25:50 2015 UTC,This is a very good idea.
The100,33wr69,Jay013,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:53:17 2015 UTC,/u/Jay013 has recruited some redshirts and is busily making shovels to help with these efforts.
The100,33wr69,Shotokanguy,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:53:54 2015 UTC,"Or we could try a bit of scavenging. If we can find any ruins with metal pipes we could clean them out and use them. Problem with wood is we'll have to replace them pretty regularly, and they'll lose water once the wood is saturated. Unless we line them with something waterproof, and we'd need a LOT of it."
The100,33wr69,Jay013,3,Sun Apr 26 17:05:29 2015 UTC,"I had always intended to use the river as a water source. We need to craft some way to get it to camp even if that means moving the camp closer to the river. We can scavenge materials to create a canal of some sort. Perhaps hollow out split trees, lay them down and make a man made stream?    This is going to take a long damn time tho so in the interim we need to make some water collection devices. A zip line with buckets could be a fast fix. Start the line at the river, Run a cable to the camp. On each bucket have a string hanging down we can manually pull along the line. This way we can transport water without having to actually carry it and wear ourselves out.   IN addition we are going to scavange water collection devices. Some bunkers had barrels and we are going to repurpose some of them to hold water. I have /u/ShaneH7646 leading the charge to get these dragged to camp. /u/ElenaOcean will oversee the other operation I have going where we dig some shallow pits and lay down tarps to collect morning dew. I am going to work on the condensation portion and tree taps."
The100,33wr69,Shotokanguy,2,Sun Apr 26 16:05:22 2015 UTC,Seems like the general consensus is to make the river closer. /u/wwhideanseek and I both agree on a diversion channel to fill up the stream just enough so that we have a close open source.   Normally this is done with dozers and professionals. We have shovels and us.
The100,33wr69,Jay013,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:17:42 2015 UTC,"I'd like to point out at this point that it is still doable. I live in Bristol, UK, a city that once moved the entire course of a river with no modern machinery whatsoever, possibly one of the largest feats of engineering in the medieval world. If they could do that, we could do this."
The100,33wr69,woupieta,2,Sun Apr 26 16:50:38 2015 UTC,can't we also like...wrap sweaters around our legs and run through tall grass to collect dew? I read that on your survival guide from the fishing expedition.
The100,33wr69,Kishara,2,Sun Apr 26 17:27:07 2015 UTC,This I gotta see.
The100,33wr69,woupieta,2,Sun Apr 26 17:43:52 2015 UTC,I think we can make it into a game so that we have fun while we work. Like manhunt but with the real possibility that someone might get picked off by a two-headed wolf.
The100,33wr69,Kishara,2,Sun Apr 26 17:50:09 2015 UTC,Only thing is have we seen any long grass that isn't well within the mountain's killzone? My memory is failing me here.
The100,33wr69,woupieta,2,Sun Apr 26 17:52:14 2015 UTC,there was grass near that bunker that Bellamy and Clarke find. That's only a Day Trip so it won't be far.
The100,33wr69,Kishara,2,Sun Apr 26 17:55:18 2015 UTC,I guess we need to give some of the redshirts an early wakeup call and send them off for a funny looking run!
The100,33wr69,woupieta,2,Sun Apr 26 17:57:10 2015 UTC,"any fatalities just means more water to go around, so it's a win/win!"
The100,33wr69,wwhideanseek,2,Sun Apr 26 18:00:36 2015 UTC,A one day trip for a few sweaters  of water?  For that amount of water that is too far and too dangerous.  I advise against it.
The100,33wr69,wwhideanseek,3,Sun Apr 26 18:00:06 2015 UTC,"Anyone planning to help with the channel, get your shovels here!"
The100,33wr69,BysshePlease,3,Sun Apr 26 17:51:51 2015 UTC,"I can put in some time with a shovel. If we move the camp closer to the river and are able to find where the river is closest to the dry stream we were using, we can just patch through to the stream and be back in business!"
The100,33wr69,wwhideanseek,2,Sun Apr 26 19:18:45 2015 UTC,"The thing I'm most hesitant in moving the camp about is that we won't be able to retreat into the safety of the dropship as fast as we can now. If we could move that, it'd be a different story. But yes. We should send scouts to look for a point of access"
The100,33wr69,wwhideanseek,2,Sun Apr 26 19:30:19 2015 UTC,How many shovels would we actually have? I'm trying to get an idea of how big an undertaking this is to determine if I would go looking for an alternative water source.
The100,33wr69,Shotokanguy,2,Sun Apr 26 21:52:47 2015 UTC,"optimistically? 20-ish  We're using scrap metal with tree limbs and using what tools we have to cut them into shape. It'll take a while. But a whole day spent just on shovels shouldn't go too badly, cause then the rest of the week can be spent making the channel."
The100,33wr69,Shotokanguy,2,Sun Apr 26 22:10:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe I think too much into this stuff, but I have to wonder how much of the 100 of us would actually be any help with this. I'm sure there'd be lazy sacks of crap who try to find ways to get out of helping.  We'd need to have people trade off shifts digging, in order to keep making good progress. We should also spend most of our time working late in the day, at night, and early in the day, when it's not as hot."
The100,33wr69,PolarStHudson,2,Mon Apr 27 00:06:00 2015 UTC,"Well hey, not our fault if they die of thirst...  Speaking off. Punishment through reduced rartions should be added to list of punishments.   Yeah. We'll need to work in shifts. But not late at night. We may be allied with grounders but there are other threats.   Also, you're not alone. I always delve too deep into hypothetical situations. That got me the nickname of ""apocalypse guy"" in high school."
The100,33wr69,Milo_BOK,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:13:01 2015 UTC,That's weirdly what I had you tagged as.
The100,33wr69,PolarStHudson,3,Mon Apr 27 10:29:40 2015 UTC,"I'm a shy person, so for the first few weeks I've kept myself quiet, and been helping out here and there. Not really feeling comfortable in the group yet.  Because I know I wouldn't be socializing a lot at the start, I packed some things to be able to come by on my own, so I have:   a few (now empty) water bottles a decent knife some basic tools(screwdriver, pliers, saw, hammer) sleeping bag cloak book about woodworking some kind of tape-measure   When I was still at the Ark I used to read some books about making tools and weapons, as well as blacksmithing, but I couldn't find those in time to take with me. I still have some of the knowledge though.  Looking at my real-life skills and interests I'd probably have gone (or at least wanted to go) to engineering, but I don't know if I can take those into account.  For this weeks challenge I just overheard /u/Kishara suggest something about a zip line with buckets to collect water, and I'd be happy to help with that. My mind is already coming up with some ideas."
The100,33wr69,PolarStHudson,2,Sun Apr 26 21:12:29 2015 UTC,"Hey you have some great IRL skills. GO ahead and use them. I was a backcountry guide and am taking full advantage of that. The zip line would be awesome if we can find a way to make even a basic wheel crank for it. That way only a few people would be needed to run it. Make a wheel at the river and one at the base. Drop the buckets in and fill them, cap them and secure them on the line then crank the rope at camp to pull them in. I think its called a counter weight pulley system? I am not very mechanical, but did bring a lot of schematics down from that ark that may be helpful to build this thing if you want to help?"
The100,33wr69,wwhideanseek,2,Sun Apr 26 21:17:47 2015 UTC,"I'd be happy to help. As far as I know a counter weight pulley system is meant to lift things, not so much move them.   I was also thinking about something so there won't even have to be people down at the river, but I'm not sure whether it'd be possible to cap them. If you can give me those schematics, I'll take a look at them, might give me some new ideas as well."
The100,33wr69,wwhideanseek,2,Sun Apr 26 21:32:07 2015 UTC,"Well it could get really involved like a water wheel with buckets on it?  But for the basic idea, the climbers zrig  style thing cobbled with a zip line may be a good place to start?"
The100,33wr69,BysshePlease,2,Sun Apr 26 21:42:15 2015 UTC,"That is probably the best and easiest way to start. With a little more work we could still remove the human factor at the river, but you'd be limited to one (possibly two) buckets at a time.  I was thinking in the direction of a ski elevator(I do tend to make things complicated) which ultimately might be able work continuous. You'd only need someone at the camp pushing. We could use it as a punishment, or use an animal if we can get our hands on that."
The100,33wr69,Kishara,2,Sun Apr 26 22:06:45 2015 UTC,Sounds Good! We can also use it for just a good camp-wide aerobics class thing to make it more fun! I can use some work on my gluts!

The100,33wr69,Shotokanguy,2,Sun Apr 26 22:07:16 2015 UTC,"Well, we could dig for Groundwater although the radiation level may be higher there...  But since we have now ""peace"" with the Grounders i would suggest building some kind of irrigation ditch/channel as it would benefit us as well as the grounders and could prove very useful in the future."
The100,33wr69,Jay013,2,Sun Apr 26 11:49:49 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I'm honestly not sure if it would be more or less radioactive than surface water."
The100,33wr69,wwhideanseek,2,Sun Apr 26 13:00:46 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sure i read somewhere that the radiation stays longer (and higher) in the ground than on the surface, so i would assume that groundwater is longer radioactive too...  It could be tho, that i just fell asleep whilst watching a sci-fi movie... :P"

The100,33wr69,arihadne,2,Sun Apr 26 16:53:07 2015 UTC,"I would hope those of us who brought water from the Ark have been saving it up until now.  We also don't have to ask the Grounders for help with water - instead, ask for some sort of map or a description of the areas we haven't explored, which can hopefully lead us to another water source. That's a much smaller request than helping us stay alive. If they want something in return, I'm sure we can make a fair trade."

The100,33x4jy,AAraKKe,5,Sun Apr 26 14:01:41 2015 UTC,"The Books are totally different than the show.  That's all i know. Didn't read them, maybe i should."
The100,33x4jy,wwhideanseek,5,Sun Apr 26 14:15:27 2015 UTC,The books only share the basic premise of the kids being sent to earth and the same character names. This is according to what others who have read them say. I chose not to read them so that my enjoyment of the show would not be influenced seeing as the books are not related to the show.
The100,33x4jy,Kishara,2,Sun Apr 26 14:35:30 2015 UTC,"The books are totally different. They're... okay. I liked reading them because it was like getting to experience the story from a different perspective, but it's nowhere near as good. The books feel like the Pilot all the way through, there's lots of romance and drama and complaining about stupid things as opposed to badass survival like we get on the show. They're an easy-summer-read-type book but they're nothing special, the show is way better."
The100,33x4jy,Zenkas,1 point,Tue Apr 28 07:51:16 2015 UTC,So when does the show start to veer away from it? Are any of the City of Light and Mountain Men storylines in it?
The100,33x4jy,ParkerZA,1 point,Tue Apr 28 12:13:47 2015 UTC,"The end of the pilot. There are barely even grounders in the sense that we know them. Mount Weather exists but the big plot point with it is that there's a functioning radio there, not that the people inside can't be exposed to radiation and need bone marrow. The City of Light is not mentioned at all."
The100,33x4jy,Zenkas,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:36:19 2015 UTC,Thanks. Guess I haven't been giving the writers enough credit!

The100,33x4jy,SilentSniper646,1 point,Sun Apr 26 14:35:21 2015 UTC,I read it. It's not very good. The rights to the story were bought before the book was completed.
The100,33x4jy,corinthian_llama,2,Mon Apr 27 00:13:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah?  The TV show is written in a way that makes me think the books are genius.  Usually TV shows are pretty straight forward with no meaningful deaths and little change in the character goals/alignments.  When a TV show is this awesome and intricate, it's usually because the source material is a book that has a lot of depth to draw from.  So I was thinking about reading the books, but it sounds like they're nothing like the show."

Just so everyone knows Devon is working with the new writer's room PA Lane Morgan and they recently start The 100 Charity Project. Check out the twitter for it here.  They are doing awesome things like using the hashtag #TheLivingareHungry to get people to donate to food banks and #BloodMustHaveBlood to get blood drives going. Giving back when you are still so new to fame yourself is really commendable. The show is getting behind their efforts and has been very supportive. Mobilizing fans to do good in the world is such a marvelous idea. It is so unselfish and and such a positive thing to ask fans to concentrate on.

Clarke is my least favourite pixelly thing and was the hardest to make, Lexa was the first one and IIRC Raven was the last. Unfortunately I never got time to finish the cast even though I had some ideas for the rest.  Each was made on a (IIRC) 32 x 36 pixel grid which I then scaled up, so not a lot of room to work with. Each character is therefore only max about 7 pixels wide. . And I purposely made Jasper and Monty have the sameish colour scheme, and put the sun next to Octavia to show that she is Octavia of the sky people . They were fun to make as a random 2am project."

It would be cool if we added a discussion thread were people could about anything the 100 related. Instead of a set topic. I know we could just post a thread on whatever we wanted to talk about.

Dont tell them I voted for Bob, they may take away my fan membership card shhhh!  Jensen Ackles is awesome and has deserved every bit of love thrown his way over the years. But this means WAY more to The 100 than it does to SPN. Sometime last year I went public with my obsession for The 100 proclaimed it as my favorite show. I will watch SPN til they finally take it off the air, but The 100 is the one for me. There is nothing on television that does what they are doing and they do it so amazingly well."
The100,33o7cu,MeropeRedpath,3,Fri Apr 24 05:07:01 2015 UTC,"Same here! I love SPN, from a distance, but I'm ridiculously obsessed with the 100. I just went to vote. I never vote on these things.

That is a freaking miracle. Jensen wins this thing every year and anyone challenging him is usually dead in the water.   I almost fainted when I saw Bob ahead last night. Even if he loses, that he could even begin to challenge Jensen for this is beyond any imaginings I had. Bob took out Kevin Freaking Spacey and is not being destroyed by Jensen.

The100,33od3c,caesarfecit,5,Fri Apr 24 06:27:22 2015 UTC,"This.   The grounders wouldn't use guns (even when Kane freely offered to arm/train them) because Mt. Weather would wipe out entire villages where guns had been reported.   I would imagine the same would be true in spades with explosives.   Also, they grabbed Monty the episode after the bomb exploded, and moved in force against the 100 shortly after that. Capturing the 100 also probably took their entire ground force to do it, which is likely why they captured Monty first for intel (and/or Monty stumbled upon them watching the camp)."
The100,33od3c,Jay013,6,Fri Apr 24 22:26:19 2015 UTC,"My guess is that the Mountain Men used the bridge as an easy access route. By blowing it up, they lose an easy way to cross the river, which means more oxygen time wasted."
The100,33od3c,PM_ME_YOUR_GOATS,2,Fri Apr 24 06:05:08 2015 UTC,I don't think the bridge mattered to them at all. Just a faction on the ground using very visible explosives made them very antsy.
The100,33od3c,Jay013,2,Mon Apr 27 07:34:06 2015 UTC,"Raven's presence is enough to make anyone antsy. Fear or otherwise ;)  But seriously though, it's most likely. That and their blood supply going off to fight. ""Don't die we need you! For 'science'...."""
The100,33od3c,vonotny,6,Mon Apr 27 08:19:15 2015 UTC,I'm guessing the Mountain Men would be pissed because their nearest neighbor is playing with bombs? MW probably interferes in grounder issues if they feel threatened.
The100,33od3c,MeropeRedpath,4,Fri Apr 24 06:12:16 2015 UTC,"That's how I understood it as well. The Mountain Men were clearly aware that there was a new faction in town, one that wouldn't be so scared of their technology that they'd take everything lying down. Proof: they're the ones who made the second dropship crash and burn, if I remember correctly.  The Sky People would have possibly been left alone if they hadn't rocked the boat, but as it is, they made big waves, and MM got pissed..."
The100,33od3c,Kishara,2,Fri Apr 24 08:57:07 2015 UTC,This may be a dumb question considering how I probably should already know the answer- But at the time were they referring to the Mt Weather people or the actual mountain grounder faction?
The100,33od3c,Kishara,5,Fri Apr 24 04:40:51 2015 UTC,"Not entirely sure what you mean, but at the time the Mountain Men were a mysterious clan that we didn't know about at the time, and the show made it seem like it was a savage, more aggressive clan. A group to be feared, maybe even a group that had the tree clans' decisions be answered to. We didn't know that the Mt. Weather people had guns/smoke bombs, etc. They were just a group that were supposed to intimidate us more than the tree clan. The tree clan feared them.   Edit: I think I'm an idiot and completely missed the point of the question, but pretty sure at that point they meant the mount weather people. If there's a mount grounder faction, then apparently I'm not paying enough attention."
The100,33od3c,Unnamedwookie,2,Fri Apr 24 04:47:38 2015 UTC,"Right but what I am saying is this- was there a chance that Octavia was referring to Mt Weather and not the mountain grounders clan? I need to rewatch that episode, season 1 on the whole is a bit foggy in my memory."
The100,33od3c,Lil_Bits,3,Fri Apr 24 04:52:52 2015 UTC,"She legitimately said 'the mountain men', and Anya said 'mountain men' when they cleaned up after the attack at the drop ship. Makes me think it's gotta be the same group. It's not too ridiculous to think a group of people that live like the grounders are so scared of people with guns, smoke bombs, armour(?), and a giant fog attack."
The100,33od3c,Lil_Bits,2,Fri Apr 24 05:01:11 2015 UTC,Mountain men use grounders to live.  They want them to remain subservient.  They will kill any grounder that uses a firearm.  A bomb is something that can threaten the mountain men.  Therefore having the sky people possibly giving (or grounders steal) explosives is a real threat.
The100,33na19,Lil_Bits,7,Thu Apr 23 22:22:04 2015 UTC,The attack on the main door was a diversion so that Raven and Wick could get to the generators and Bellamy could free the grounders and gather up the kids while the MW guards were distracted.
The100,33na19,ElenaOcean,3,Thu Apr 23 22:52:56 2015 UTC,The hydroelectric dam needed to be offline so the door would disengage ( & be able to be blown up) until the generators inside Mt. Weather kicked in. That's the 1 minute (?) window they talk about.
The100,33na19,uncatalyzed,2,Thu Apr 23 23:23:32 2015 UTC,"Why then, did David Miller risk his life (along with 5 or 6 grounders) trying to detonate the explosive? If it was simply a distraction, they wouldn't need to get the door open, they'd just need to be camped outside. And again, the attack would have been much more successful had they evacuated the hostages and then breached through the caves and into the harvest chamber. Why would they risk having a bunch of kids and an ""army"" of grounders (very weak and likely not too effective) inside during the fight?"
The100,33na19,Shotokanguy,4,Thu Apr 23 23:08:42 2015 UTC,"They were trying to draw part of their forces to the door. If they got it open, they would have to respond, else they would be allowing the Grounder army right into the mountain uncontested."
The100,33na19,VGBAMF,10,Fri Apr 24 02:19:30 2015 UTC,"Clarke explains to all the leaders that it's their job to hold the full attention of the Mountain Men while a select crew does the actual rescuing. This means mounting an attack and getting the full focus on the front door while Indra and her team help the captives out through the tunnel. Shutting the power off is part of legitimizing this threat of breaching the front door. (Without the power loss, they're just a couple thousand people hanging out outside an unbreachable fortress of cement and steel.)  The people in the tunnels are in a very dangerous position. They have knives and blades while their enemy has guns. If the Mountain Men discover the rescue team in there, they are fish in a barrel. Even if Grounders outnumbered them 10 to 1, they would lose in those tunnels against firepower.  Clarke's plan was to pull all focus away from the tunnels, which apparently worked, because Bellamy et al were able to get to the door as she had originally planned. Everything just went downhill from there."
The100,33na19,MeropeRedpath,3,Fri Apr 24 08:07:08 2015 UTC,To the top with you! Have my up vote for a thorough explanation :)
The100,33na19,internet_friends,2,Fri Apr 24 08:58:58 2015 UTC,"You also have to take into consideration that the characters aren't supposed to make perfect decisions. That might have been a better plan, but perhaps the main characters just didn't think of it with all the stress in their lives.   If they go through the tunnels, they have to face reapers, which will result in heavy casualties. That's why they tried to send a few people in to free the grounders trapped inside, but obviously that plan didn't work."
The100,33na19,internet_friends,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:44:05 2015 UTC,"To be fair though, they had tone generators, so reapers weren't a problem."

Raven and Clarke become friends Finn and Clarke's relationship doesn't ""develop"" and Finn probably doesn't go crazy and massacre everyone Wells probably gets beat up by Bellamy for getting in the way of Clarke's co-leadership. Bellamy and Clarke don't learn their lesson about lynch mobs Murphy isn't exiled, no one gets the bleedy flu, he doesn't steal the bombs to blow up the dropship, they are way better equipped for the grounder attack.

The100,33l17g,ElenaOcean,5,Thu Apr 23 13:06:31 2015 UTC,You have seriously covered it all this time. Maybe add Murphy doesn't get the cool crib with all the booze and stuff so there is no one there to stop Jaha once he goes full crazy over the AI?
The100,33l17g,Kishara,4,Thu Apr 23 12:54:19 2015 UTC,would Jaha go crazy at all? He won't lose his son so what's his motivation for the city of light?
The100,33l17g,ElenaOcean,5,Thu Apr 23 13:01:27 2015 UTC,"Good point. I think the case can be made that Jaha would have gone crazy regardless, he wanted to take over leadership and there is no way they would have let that happen? So his lack of power made him feel impotent and that is what triggered his nutty behavior?"
The100,33l17g,The_Iron_Zeppelin,3,Thu Apr 23 13:07:19 2015 UTC,are we still going with the theory that those seconds of oxygen deprivation gave him brain damage? Maybe if Wells lived the sideplot would have been Wells trying to stop his crazy father from destroying everything.
The100,33l17g,SilentSniper646,5,Thu Apr 23 13:12:16 2015 UTC,"Take it one step further.  If Jaha knew Wells was alive, would he have sacrificed himself to send the rest of the Arkers to the ground before the oxygen ran out?  The Arkers may have died in space leaving the 100 without reinforcements or even the Grounder Alliance to save then from the Mountain Men.  Most of the 100 get harvested by the Mountain Men, Clarke escapes, Anya lives, Clarke joins the Grounders along with anyone else who didn't get stuck in the Mountain.   Would have been a totally different show."
The100,33l17g,fretspyder,7,Thu Apr 23 18:23:04 2015 UTC,I think then Jaha might have not stayed on the ark because he said he wanted his people on the ground but it would be to hard without his son is what i think so he might have come down and Kane would have stayed.
The100,33l17g,fretspyder,4,Thu Apr 23 12:02:05 2015 UTC,"Murphy's story would have changed dramatically. Granted he'd probably still be an ass, but he'd be with the group for longer. I can just see him being in Mt. Weather (if he made it that far) and talking shit to everybody, would've been epic. At the same time, without all the crap that befell him after getting exiled it's hard to say if his character would have grown up as much as it did. The only other person with a major impact would be Jaha. He might have pushed for a return to the ground sooner, and he might not be so fanatical about finding a new purpose. The kids' Lord of the Flies lesson would probably still have occurred in some form though. The possible catalysts for it in their situation would be infinite."
The100,33l17g,dull_delinquent,2,Thu Apr 23 12:31:26 2015 UTC,I think if he had been at Mt Weather he would have escaped with Clarke. I can't see him staying there if there was a chance to get out. He'd get pissed off with their rules too quickly.

The100,33l17g,Jay013,3,Thu Apr 23 16:38:44 2015 UTC,"If Charlotte hadn't killed Wells, I'd guess that'd be because she didn't take the whole 'kill your demons' thing quite so literally. Maybe she would have worked out her trauma some other way, a support group of people 'personally victimized by Thelonius Jaha', maybe? someone else would probably have ended up shanking wells  If this was any other show, there'd be a heart-warming conversation between Charlotte and Wells, Wells affirming that he is not his father, Charlotte learning to let go of her past. The music swells, the credits roll. Hahahahah, good thing this is The 100, right?  Also, now there's a random kid, because Charlotte wouldn't have killed herself. I'm not sure if that really changes anything."
The100,33l17g,Shotokanguy,3,Thu Apr 23 14:38:28 2015 UTC,"This is a good ""what if"" for this week's episode anyway...nobody thought of this:   Clarke and Wells are close, and episode 4 never happens. Finn and Clarke never get it on in the bunker. Clarke is in camp when Raven's pod lands. Bellamy tries to get to the radio himself, but with Clarke already there, he can't sneak off on his own. Raven's radio is never damaged, and contact is made with the Ark immediately. The 320 people are never sacrificed. Red headed father guy doesn't have to die for his daughter! The Ark knows Earth is habitable again, and begins preparations to leave the Ark. Some conflict over the number of pods would occur, but eventually, the exodus would begin... And Mount Weather would likely crash several of the ships. There's no telling who might die, but either way, the 100 would have their people back much sooner. Completely different show.   I go way too deep on these."
The100,33l17g,Jay013,2,Fri Apr 24 00:27:31 2015 UTC,"Finn and Clarke never get it on in the bunker.   Saving it for Lexa ;)  Also, with the Dropship problem that caused the rebellion, that event would still occur, and the Ark still comes down. And we've already seen Mt.

Then the whole dilema with the lack of dropships causes her to leak the info to those loyal to her, thus causing the rebellion in Unity Day. The bombing is still likely to happen as Unity Day is still the best chance to take out all the council members and Jaha in one go. There is still a lack of dropships, and Diana is still a cunt. So...Everything after Unity day on the Ark just happens sooner."

The100,33dpyw,OccasionallyWeDie,6,Tue Apr 21 18:14:45 2015 UTC,"Well, Lost is one of my favorite shows, if not my favorite show.   There have been many comparisons between Lost and The 100, but I think that has mainly to do with the arborous settings. Lost was shot in the Hawaiian rainforest and often feature people running through them, and The 100 is shot in the Vancouver forests and often features people running through them. Also, in the first seasons of both series', there was a more prominent element of survivalist fiction in the episodes that subsided in subsequent seasons. Both shows feature airborne crafts that crash land, leaving a group of people to fend for themselves in the wild. Both shows feature an antagonistic, mysterious ""other"" faction that initially seem primitive.  I think it can be argued as well that while both are ensemble shows, they both feature main POV characters in Jack and Clarke. Other characters may be featured prominently, but fundamentally the shows are told through those characters' perspectives. It may be too early to say, but considering how these first two season went, it's seems that The 100 is Clarke's hero's journey.  The two diverge in that Lost deals with sci-fi and magical realism, whereas The 100 deals with post-apocalyptic sci-fi naturalism. Lost presents its narrative with clear protagonists and antagonists, whereas The 100 deals more in the morally grey. That's not to say that Lost is totally binary in their portrayals--the stories of Ben Linus and John Locke for the most part contradict that. But in the end, I doubt The 100 is going to feature anything comparable to Jacob/The Man in Black.   Also, both shows feature a sympathetic character committing genocide, and Henry Ian Cusick as a series regular. Both shows, within the first episodes, feature a character shooting a handgun at a charging animal. Both shows feature electrically charged gaseous clouds that often bring death.  I actually see more similarities between The 100 and Battlestar Galactica and Game of Thrones (especially the former) than Lost."

The100,33dpyw,KingKolder,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:49:47 2015 UTC,"Warning Game of Thrones Spoilers -    GOT is a story about factions trying to survive. So is The 100. GOT has Daenerys, we have Clarke- both are tough young women who are evolving into leaders (we even joke about Clarke hatching  dragons etc..). GOT is brutal and has no mercy for main characters, neither does The 100.   There are clear differences between GOT and The 100, but the similarities hit me the day they killed Wells in S1."
The100,33dpyw,YogurtPuddles,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:52:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I saw the similarities between Clarke and Daenerys as well, in fact, she was the first character I compared Clarke to. And I suppose it's true that the writers are pretty ruthless towards the main characters of The 100 as well, seeing as many of the main characters have been killed off already."
The100,33dpyw,leeah,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:00:30 2015 UTC,Im really loving these similarities this is a great comment
The100,33dpyw,Sylentbob,6,Fri Apr 24 03:59:41 2015 UTC,"At their most basic premise they're both shows that force a group of people into a world without outside threats/mysteries and inner conflict (the 100 has multiple people causing shit, while in Lost it's mostly just one person). I'm sure other shows could be summed up like that, but that's where they're the most similar.  Breaking it down more, both have weird fog threats, acid fog in 100, smoke monster in Lost. Both have someone with at least a bit of medical expertise as the leader of the main group. Both introduce early on animals that shouldn't be there/shouldn't exist: the irradiated deer, the snake that attacks Octavia, the glowing forests in 100, polar bear in Lost. Both have flashbacks, although the 100 is about 100x more bearable about it. Both have other groups that they eventually run into, and both having their leader be a seemingly innocent person implemented into our group to gather intel: Lexa in 100, Ben in Lost. Both have something on the ground interfere with their exodus ship/plane and cause it to crash. Both capture our group's leader and get them to try to save one of their own. Both have Henry Ian Cusick.  I dunno, I'm sure there's others, but those are things that jump out to me. Aside from that, they take quite different paths which make them both worth the watch. Hopefully the 100 doesn't get completely ridiculous like Lost does by the third or fourth season."
The100,33dpyw,Wxlson,1 point,Tue Apr 21 18:56:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, though I think Lost got ridiculous in season 5 when they introduced time travel - I really hope The 100 doesn't take a similar path."
The100,33dpyw,bluemerlino,4,Tue Apr 21 19:04:39 2015 UTC,"Lost is the show that started my passion for serial television, and so no show totally trumps it in that nostalgic sort of way. I love Lost for the same reasons I love The 100 though: the ways they play with morality and the characters. At their core (Lost more so than The 100) I think both these shows are about people. You can even make some something rough comparisons between the archetypes.  Clarke = Jack (doctor, de facto learer, good of the group) Lexa = Ben (leader of the opposite group who seemed pretty vicious but who the main characters and viewers eventually bonded with, emotionally ""stunted"") Jaha = Locke (man of faith to Abby and Clarke's man of science, believing in the heart of the island/City of Light) Murphy = Sawyer (Bad guy turned ""good""...but still pretty bad, helps when it serves him, rough exterior/heart of gold, focused on vengeance, bad childhood)  Bellamy = Kate (co-leader, a good guy who thinks they're bad because of one or two mistakes, deeply dedicated to their family and got screwed over for it). Even some relationship types line up: Monty & Jasper = Hurley & Charley Finn, Clarke & Bellamy = Jack, Kate & Sawyer Bellamy & Murphy = Jack & Sawyer (obviously Jack isn't the character I associated with Bell, but I think the relationships are starting to look similar. At each others throats, barely restrained hatred for each other...great team, Sawyer/Murphy's basically second in command, etc). Octavia & Lincoln = Charlie & Claire (not so much in season 2, but in season 1. Charlie/Lincoln instantly in love with Claire/Octavia, protecting her) I have a lot of strong feelings about Lost and The 100."
The100,33dpyw,KingKolder,3,Wed Apr 22 01:54:46 2015 UTC,"Lost was actually the same show that started my passion for serial television as well. Before that, I used to watch whatever was on TV when channel-surfing (this was 6-7 years ago) until my friend introduced me to Lost. Since the show was several seasons in at the time, I couldn't just watch whatever was on TV and so I download the episodes instead. And so begun my passion for scouring IMDb for new series that I could watch..."

The100,33ecso,Amonette2012,4,Wed Apr 22 17:04:02 2015 UTC,"If it were up to me I would do the following:  Cremate all the bodies, clear out all perishables and get it ready to be used as an emergency shelter again.  Attempt to restore (or at least very carefully clean the blood off) the paintings damaged in the fights, then store them equally carefully for now. In the longer term a museum for them should be created, but there are more important things to worry about right now and they'll be safer in a vault.  Make a thorough inventory of the whole place, get Raven and co to do a tech survey, see what there is in terms of weapons etc.  Start building a town on the surface controlling access to the underground areas.  See what can be done to fix the electricity turbines and get the power back up.  Get the food production going - no reason to stop using that! The only issue is that the plants and any animals they have will not be able to survive the surface, but it doesn't take very long to change plant genetics - you could start exposing them to low levels and selectively breeding, and in a few years you'd be able to reintroduce them on the surface. It might be possible to use bone marrow from surviving breeds of domestic animals in order to add any mountain livestock's genes to the genepool, but I'm unsure as to how successful or necessary this would be.  Create a memorial garden. This would have four large standing stones in it - one for the lives of the grounders, one for the 100 and all the sky people killed when their ship was brought down, one for the mountain people who tried to oppose the use of human blood, and one for the rest of the mountain people.   Invite the grounders to tour the facility. They'll want to see where their people died, and they'll probably be pretty curious.  Start a hospital on the surface to treat grounders and sky people (and anyone else in need). This could also eventually comprise old age care facilities, dental surgeries and all the other trappings of human medicine.  Round up all the remaining Reapers, use the underground lab as a treatment center to try and save them. The lab inside the mountain would be the most secure place to do this and also has life support facilities which might be needed when they all start coding all over the place!  Open a school and invite some teachers from the grounders to join the staff, the idea would be to create a place where each culture can learn about each other and share in each other's knowledge, as well as providing formal education to all children in the area and any adults that want to learn. In time this could seed other more distant schools. As well as general subjects they could also teach tech related things and start a med school. The more doctors, scientists, engineers and so on the better.  Collect a bunch of things like trinkets, jewelry, clothing, utensils, furniture etc and start trading with the grounders. Trade is a fast way to peace, and there must be masses of stuff in that mountain that people would want to pick over, it's like a massive garage sale in there. I'd go through it first to remove anything particularly rare or valuable for the museum, as it would be good to preserve a wide range of anthropological artifacts from before the war.  Put all the books together and create a library. This will most likely be one of the last collections of books in existence now, so it's important that anything irreplaceable is copied and the originals remain safe."
The100,33ecso,Therearefour-lights,1 point,Thu Apr 23 11:53:11 2015 UTC,I think the most likely scenario is that they will take anything usable out before collapsing it with explosives.
The100,33ecso,Amonette2012,2,Wed Apr 22 08:20:44 2015 UTC,"That would be a horrific waste, both in terms of usable equipment and in terms of destroying history. That bunker has a lot of bodies in it, yes, but it also has what may be one of the world's last decent collection of pre war artefacts, not to  mention priceless art, music, books and other things that would be lost from the world if they aren't preserved. I'd cry if they blew up the mountain, the thought of art and books being destroyed is something that makes me rage. Oh and not to mention that their farms were turning out food for hundreds of people and the plants will not be able to survive on the surface until they've selectively bred them for a few generations."
The100,33ecso,TripJammer,1 point,Thu Apr 23 11:57:19 2015 UTC,Most likely scenario is that it's forgotten.  What makes sense to me is that the grounders use it as a fortress

The100,339aha,ydnab2,14,Mon Apr 20 17:54:07 2015 UTC,"Well anyone who has been reading the subreddit for any length of time already knows that Raven is my favorite character and has been since she was introduced in season 1. Something about snarky  brilliant people just draws me in and Raven has all of that. I loved how she noped out of that early love triangle with Clarke and Finn. It was so mature and merciful to us fans not to see the show devolve into a damn teen soap opera.   Raven's challenges in season 2 were frustrating because it meant she could not go with the other group because of her leg brace. She still managed to be an integral part of the plot and without her help, the dams would not have been blown & the coms jammed- so the 47 would have probably been killed.   My favorite scene with Raven? Wow...Can't even begin to say because there isn't a minute she is onscreen that I am not in my happy place. But that one at the end there where she bites the guard made me cheer like never before (special thanks to /u/ydnab2)  ."
The100,339aha,ydnab2,2,Mon Apr 20 18:10:01 2015 UTC,"I was wondering why you were ""responding"" to me, and then I got to the end and realized the user mention. This is a strange feature for us unpopular folk. Also, I had fun making that gif, and I'm glad you liked it =)"

The100,339aha,Jay013,1 point,Mon Apr 20 23:28:36 2015 UTC,Raven was definitely channeling her inner Rick Grimes during that scene!
The100,339aha,BysshePlease,7,Tue Apr 21 00:24:13 2015 UTC,My favorite scenes with Raven are pretty much all of them that don't include Finn. I love how she's the designated badass engineer and I hope she gets to continue being awesome and not constantly be in pain.
The100,339aha,Jay013,9,Mon Apr 20 18:08:21 2015 UTC,"My favourite Raven scene has got to be the drop down to Earth. In a dropship she built from fricking SCRAPS!  Raven has had a lot of injuries on this show. Head trauma from the drop, sickness from the Murphy Virus, a bullet wound by Murphy, her surgery without anesthetic, her torture during the peace feast, explosion from the turbines, and of course the worst of all, bone marrow extraction.   Raven's my favourite, I really wish she gets her break. The ground has been nothing but cruel to her, but she just does her best to push on and help out whatever way she can. She's a badass zero-g mechanic who can hold a gun, make a bomb, and is pretty damn sexy overall. Wink wink Kyle Wick.  Most interesting thing about Raven? Her ability to get through anything despite the odds or events. She just can't be put down and I love it."
The100,339aha,BlueOberries,3,Mon Apr 20 19:03:04 2015 UTC,"I loved that pod crashing scene because you could see all the components shaking as if they were held in place by one-sided scotch tape looped around to form an adhesive ring.  Edit: Also, when that scene cuts, the show's logo animation comes up and it looks like Raven crashed into the 00s. That was neat."
The100,339aha,Shotokanguy,2,Mon Apr 20 20:04:44 2015 UTC,Yup. The did a good job showing how crappy it was!
The100,339aha,wwhideanseek,10,Mon Apr 20 20:14:20 2015 UTC,Oh god Raven has had so many fantastic scenes but I think my favorite is when she was being searched by one of the grounders and they took like 20 weapons from her. She was so done in that scene and her badassery level was off the charts!
The100,339aha,BysshePlease,5,Tue Apr 21 00:21:40 2015 UTC,"I really don't think I've seen anyone hate on Raven, and I don't see how anyone could. She's just cool in every way. She's tough, smart, sassy...and Lindsey Morgan is nice to look at while she's doing those things."
The100,339aha,arihadne,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:46:22 2015 UTC,Well... I don't hate her.  I mean she is great at catching bullets and ¡almost! screwing everything up...  j/k (pls don't kill me) ;P  The actor is pretty good.
The100,339aha,Jay013,4,Mon Apr 20 19:02:49 2015 UTC,"She's got to be one of the most dynamic characters on the show, and that's mostly thanks to the writers, but also thanks to Lindsey Morgan's performance as well. I rolled my eyes so hard the first time I saw the fifth episode, ""Twilight's Last Gleaming,"" when it was explicitly revealed that Raven and Finn were a couple after Finn slept with Clarke. At that point in the show I was still worried that the CW-ness of the show would overcome the better elements of complex, unexpected, non-cliched storytelling that was sprinkled through the first half of the first season. But as the season progressed, the better show prevailed, the love triangle angle fizzled out as just character background instead of featured as the most important thing in a situation where a mysterious enemy is menacing you and your people. That earned a lot of my respect for this show. And in that fifth episode, her first episode on the Ground, Raven took initiative in organizing the plan to send flairs to the air to signal the Ark and prevent the culling. It was great seeing another assertive female character working with Clarke. This was perhaps one of the first indications that the writers were committed to telling a story informed by feminist principles. (And then Octavia trips and falls and in the next episode is captured and imprisoned by a Grounder, but whatever.)  I also loved the fact that Raven slept with Bellamy, and the writers just left it at that. It was a casual encounter, neither character expected anything from each other after that, it's just a thing that happened, and everyone moved on afterwards. It was refreshing to see that TV characters are capable of this when many other writers on TV would take that encounter and turn it into a relationship arc. Another early indication that the writers weren't content with going in the easy, expected direction."
The100,339aha,mar33n,2,Mon Apr 20 18:42:07 2015 UTC,All scenes with Raven are my favourite scenes.
The100,339aha,Jay013,2,Mon Apr 20 18:02:11 2015 UTC,"Yep, I agree. An episode without Raven means they are not doing it right :)"
The100,339aha,DanniDorrito,2,Mon Apr 20 18:12:40 2015 UTC,"It's not a coincidence that the show got good after the first three two episodes. It's also not a coincidence that Raven appears after the first three two episodes.   Edit: My favourite character and I fuck up big time xD  Though technically, it got really good after Murphy's Law, same time Raven reaches the ground."

The100,339aha,KyleSwift,2,Tue Apr 21 08:15:23 2015 UTC,Not my entire gif collection but this unorganized mess is what I have uploaded so far.  Raven is definitely my favorite character on the show!

The100,335l92,mady16,25,Sun Apr 19 19:39:30 2015 UTC,"The ones that stand out in my mind:   The cullling on the Ark and the 100 on the ground trying to stop it, without knowing they were too late Clarke killing the Grounder in 1x11, and the look in her eyes as she watched him die The ending of season 1 - Clarke looking at the charred skeletons, then the 48 being taken by the Mountain Men Clarke and Lexa's first meeting Finn's death Lexa's betrayal Clarke telling Bellamy she's leaving   Finn's death and Clarke leaving in particular stand out to me as examples of this show's true potential. Those scenes are of similar quality to the best dramas on TV right now, at least in my opinion. The acting, dialogue, music and tone are perfect in those scenes."
The100,335l92,Shotokanguy,20,Sun Apr 19 20:27:27 2015 UTC,"The scene in Unity Day where Clarke watches the exodus ship crash and explode, thinking her mother was on it. I mean suddenly the kids were really truly alone, with no hope of getting help. It was one of those moments that made me realize just how far this show would go for a beautiful plot. But that one scene for me, with Clarke looking in horror at the exodus, that was just hauntingly beautiful."

The100,335l92,OccasionallyWeDie,19,Tue Apr 21 17:39:39 2015 UTC,"Oh God, there's too many. I can't choose one. Let me just go through a few that I remember.  I love Jasper and Monty's early relationship. In the pilot, when they hit each other back and forth. Day Trip, when they do that abnormal high five thing. In I Am Become Death, when even though Jasper was being a total dick, Monty comes in to save the day and encourage Jasper to make the shot.  Speaking of Day Trip, I love ALL of Day Trip. I don't think people realize it at first, but there is so much crazy shit going on. As Bellamy and Clarke go to find supplies, Dax is ordered by Shumway to kill Bellamy. They find guns, but soon begin to hallucinate; Clarke about her dad, Bellamy about Jaha and the 320 victims of the Culling. As this is happening, nearly every single person at camp is tripping out, leaving only Octavia, Raven, and Finn (well, Lincoln, too, but whatever). Monty and Jasper have some hilarious lines in this episode too (""I can't change the tide if the moon won't cooperate""). Octavia lets Lincoln go while everyone is distracted. Dax finally confronts both Clarke and Bellamy, but is ultimately killed. When they get back to camp, Jaha pardons Bellamy in exchange for Shumway's motives. Then, we get solid proof the Diana Sydney is up to no good when she stages Shumway's suicide.  AND speaking of Clarke and Bellamy, I LOVE the parallel between Day Trip and Blood Must Have Blood. At the end of Day Trip, Clarke tells Bellamy that he's forgiven for the crimes he has committed. At the end of Blood Must Have Blood, Bellamy does the same for her, but she, unlike Bellamy, doesn't stay with her people.  Oh, and I have to mention: I LOVE pretty much all of Blood Must Have Blood, but my highlights are:   The preparation of the battle (Octavia's war cry, Clarke joining in the chant as the Ark guard look on with concern) Kyle Wick killing someone for the first time Clarke killing Dante (not because he's a really bad guy, but I love seeing that Clarke will do absolutely anything to save her people) Everyone's reactions to the bone marrow operations (Wick and Kane trying to protect Raven and Abby, respectively) Bellamy repeating ""my sister, my responsibility"" and helping Clarke pull the lever WAIT THEY FUCKING KILLED INNOCENT LITTLE KIDS HOLY SHIT Jasper's reaction to Maya's death and his response to Monty and Clarke Jasper's reunion with his goggles Bellamy and Clarke's goodbye Murphy having the time of his life in the lighthouse, then discovering the suicide video Jaha following the drone, entering the mansion, meeting A.L.I.E and holy shit is that a nuke wait thats the end nonononono that cant be please no   AND DEAR GOD THERE ARE SO MANY MORE BUT NOBODY IS GOING TO READ THIS SO I SHOULD PROBABLY STOP NOWI may have a problem"

I can't remember exactly when in the episode it was, but it was a sweet moment in the midst of everything going on, and kind of highlighted the contrast to who they were at the start of the series."

Lexa’s confession to Clarke. Bellamy when he is shooting the two guns and the container explodes.  Abby and Clarke reuniting in 2x16. ""We tried to be the good guys."" I get super emotional about it.  When Lexa betrays Clarke. I loved the set up and hopefully we get the fallout next season.  Indra and Lincoln hug. I need more background for them two.  When Lincoln killed Cage. When Murphy found the light house."

It sort of births the Jaha/Murphy arc in my head.  Aside from that the moments where Clarke sort of deals with the aftermath of her actions. Her Lady Macbeth moment after killing Finn, and ""I tried to be the good guy"" are both right at the front of my brain when i think about the show."

It was actually the scene that sold me on the show.   The culling- I mean, come on. How could this scene not make you tear up a bit? I actually felt bad for the people dying and the people doing the killing.   S1 finale- another one of those scenes that made me hungry for more.   Clarke and Anya's escape from MW. Jumping off a big ass waterfall? Yeah I would have just been recaptured. No way in hell would I ever do that.   When Anya gets killed. I've never yelled so much at my tv before. Fucking Major Burne.   Finn's death. I literally cried for Clarke. Like how shitty is that?   And any scene involving Lexa. I LOVE her character."

The100,335l92,stophauntingme,5,Mon Apr 20 06:20:23 2015 UTC,So cheesy & stupid but when Jasper saves Monty from the cages & they hug = kind of adorable.   Also I remember being shocked in the first season where they actually shot the flashback of Clarke's dad dying by getting sucked out into space : that was nuts! I didn't know whether to laugh or cry over it - it was just so sudden.
The100,335l92,Dikeleos,8,Mon Apr 20 16:14:09 2015 UTC,The Culling: Showed that the leaders were wrong all along. However they then discover it was in vain.  Finns death: not so much his death but rather Clarke killing him.  Kane and Wick screaming for them to spare Abby and Raven.  MW Massacre:  The protagonist killing hundreds of innocents was very dark and emotional for me.  Emerson running off: the last mountain man realizes everyone he ever knew loved is dead.   Clarke leaving: She takes the guilt so others don't have too.
The100,335l92,ShaneH7646,6,Mon Apr 20 00:33:41 2015 UTC,Lexas betrayal scene was done beautifully
The100,335l92,BysshePlease,10,Sun Apr 19 20:50:44 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite scenes was the scene in ""Coup de Grace"" between Bellamy and Maya at Mount Weather on the radio with Clarke and Raven at Camp Jaha. Clarke is asking Bellamy to ask Maya if freeing the captive Grounders in Mount Weather is plausible. The camera cuts to Bellamy turning to Maya in the background who shakes her head with this look of slightly humored incredulity. Bellamy tells Clarke ""she says it's doable,"" and Maya and Clarke laugh. It's a short, relatively insignificant scene but it provided a moment of levity in a stretch of episodes that really needed it.  I also really love the scene in ""Blood Must Have Blood: Part 1"" where Lexa betrays Clarke because with all the buildup, that moment felt like a stab in the back with a twist of the knife. When it aired, I compared it to Game of Thrones' ""The Rains of Castamere"" red wedding scene, that final act in the Fargo episode ""Buridan's Ass,"" and that last act in the Hannibal season two finale ""Mizumono."" I love when a show can leave me feeling so low and trembling with shock, and that moment did exactly that. And then in the next episode Clarke commits what is essentially genocide!  Also, every scene in which Kane offers to sacrifice his own life for the good of his people. In the first season, it was in ""We Are Grounders (Part 2)"" when a mechanical failure stalls the detachment of the individual stations from the Ark and someone has to stay behind to perform manual detachments. Kane telling Abby ""Salvation comes at a price,"" getting up and shaking everyone's hands was one of the most touching moments on the show, and when the station shook and Jaha's voice was heard through the intercom, the scene turned slightly absurd but also brought enormous relief because it means Kane would make it to the next season. And the scene in ""Fog of War"" where Jaha and Kane are trying to decide who among them will kill the other to save their people. Kane steps back from Jaha and slits his own wrist. Jaha then dresses the wound and goes to threaten Lexa. That next scene Lexa dominates Jaha and reveals herself as the leader. This show's writers really like to tease Kane's death.  And that final scene in ""Spacewalker"" where Clarke mercy-kills Finn. That was a turning point for The 100 in that they actually killed off one of the main characters (Wells doesn't count), and one that the writers seemed actually invested in. The show didn't find a cheap way out of the dilemma like what happened at the end of ""Murphy's Law"" where Charlotte just hurls herself off the cliff. This time they followed through. And it was emotionally resonant, especially when considering the episode was less about Finn and the consequences of what he did and more about Clarke and her own development as a leader who is able to make difficult, morally grey choices. Also, I really disliked Finn the character and the actor who played Finn whose interpretation of the character lacked both the nuance that Eliza Taylor often brings to her performances and the presence and charisma that Bob Morley brings to his performances. Tangentially, look at the fifth episode of the first season, ""Twilight's Last Gleaming,"" where Clarke and Finn are looking at the Raven's pod crashing to the earth. There's a shot where Clarke and Finn realize what they thought was a shooting star wasn't. Look at Clarke's face and there's a shift, but Finn's face is exactly the same. He might as well be a block of wood with long hair.  That final scene in the first season finale where Radiohead's ""Exit Music (For a Film)"" fades out, the 100 step out of the dropship to examine the charred remains of the Grounder army. Then red smoke grenades are thrown into the group, Anya utters ""Mountain Men,"" everyone begins to choke and pass out, and the Mountain Men emerge from the smoke lead by green laser sights, one of them pointed at Clarke's forehead. Then the scene cuts to Clarke waking up in an all white room slightly reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey. She gets up, rips out the IV (which would have been painful. I hate in TV and movies where characters take so much care into inserting a needle, but just carelessly pull it out), walks to the door and finds Monty in a room across the her own. It was a brief scene that expanded the show's scope exponentially. It also left me hungry for more. Thankfully it wasn't as long a wait as it is right now waiting for season three to start."
The100,335l92,kingfisher6,4,Sun Apr 19 21:44:59 2015 UTC,"Finn's death. Because I honestly wasn't upset at it, and I thought it was really well done.   When Clarke let's Enmerson go. First taking control from her mother, and then when Emmerson is smirking and thinking he has it made, when Clarke starts draining his air. ""It's an 8 hour trip, you're going to do it in 6"". Chills."

Seeing the mountain men for the first time was when you saw that not everybody who's left on earth is barbaric and primitive like the grounders - there are still people with advanced technology besides the people of the arc. Specifically, the scene when Clarke sees Monty in the opposite room when they were in quarantine gave me chills. Also, the entirety of the second season finale was amazingly done and again with the huge cliffhanger of Murphy finding the house and Jaha meeting Allie and seeing the nuke. The show's definitely coming to be on par with Lost..."
The100,335r08,Shotokanguy,5,Sun Apr 19 20:26:51 2015 UTC,"Oh, jeez. It would be arrogant to assume we can help them survive any better than they already are. We might have knowledge about things like math and science and health that they don't, but how much use those things would be to them is hard to say.  And in my case, I again don't feel particularly useful. I think I'm fairly good at calming people down in tense conversations, but if things get tense then we're probably screwed anyway.   The only thing I could really offer the Grounders is my knowledge of martial arts. They might find that interesting, being such a warlike people. It might even be fun for me to spar with them. I can't imagine knowledge of hand to hand combat survived the nukes. How many highly skilled martial artists could've survived? So, no matter how tough the Grounders are, I'm sure they could be taught better technique."
The100,335r08,manicmelancholic,4,Sun Apr 19 20:35:45 2015 UTC,"Well now that we've succeeded in talking to them, we've got some serious persuasion to do. Basically we're asking them a favor. We're the invaders. We could try a few persuasion techniques to start off. The key thing here is either first you ask for a lot when you're willing to settle for much less, so they're willing to take the better offer after hearing the first one. Or you ask for very little so that when you ask for more they're already willing to since they'd already be helping the sky people anyway.   I'm say we go with the ""Door in the Face"" technique. Demand lots of land and freedoms to cross grounder territory. They'll say no so then I'll say we'll settle for the area around the drop ship, as long as we have enough ground to hunt.   Anya is hesitant to let us live there, even after hearing our meager request. The grounders would still be weary of us, even after a truce and she knows peace would be difficult to maintain.   There would be some tenuous peace until some sort of resolution occurred. I'd take that time to try and get the grounders into weed and the booze. No I'm not going to try and sell them anything. But being intoxicated makes people open up a lot more, and we could sort of trick them into bonding with us... I mean seriously it would work. After weed and liquor people are suddenly much more eager to make friends.   And since I'm helping to grow a medical garden that last part will be pretty easy."

They'll say no so then I'll say we'll settle for the area around the drop ship, as long as we have enough ground to hunt.   In Veep, this is what's known as a ""cock-thumb."""
The100,335r08,BysshePlease,3,Sun Apr 19 22:33:26 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I really have no idea. The Grounders are fine on their own. I'm guessing that manicmelancholic and arihadne's negotiations revealed that the Grounders are pissed at us for inadvertently destroying some of their villages or whatever, which they took as an act of war. I'm sure we explained our situation, but we are in their territory so they'll probably force us to move if we can't find a compelling reason for them to let us stay. On top of that, they're skeptical of our intentions (probably as a result of previous inter-clan conflicts).  So, what wouldn't we know at this point. We wouldn't have any knowledge about the reapers. They're just bogeymen at this point, so we can't offer to rehabilitate them. We wouldn't know anything about the Mountain Men yet, and even mentioning Mount Weather would provoke further hostility from the Grounder forces, so we can't offer aid in fighting against them yet. Would any of us know enough about the Grounder language in case they want to communicate among themselves (and how would that knowledge have come about)?  At this point I think all we can offer are our advanced knowledge of engineering, medicine, and anything else that may be relevant to contributing to Grounder society. They'd probably have a strong agricultural system in place, but perhaps we could offer knowledge about genetic engineering to produce greater crop yields. Our more engineering-inclined members may be able to build a more robust irrigation system for the Grounders. I don't know, this all feels very condescending and maybe even bigoted, Sky People showing the savages the proper way to do things. These proposals could just anger them.  By this point we'd be in contact with the Ark, so if peace isn't an option, we have to stall the Grounders until reinforcements from the Ark come. I guess if I were a part of the negotiating party, I would filibuster?  I try to ask Fox if she has any suggestions, but I'm breathless in her presence, so what was once a conversational question posed charmingly and confidently in my mind comes out as a formless glob of sound.  Oh, have we stumbled upon the hallucinogenic berries yet? If we have nothing they want, maybe we can artificial create demand for something weh ave. Maybe someone brought down some poppy or coca or tobacco seeds from the Ark (where's Monty?)? We can offer them a free sample supply of opium and/or coca leaves and/or tobacco or whatever other addictive substance we can whip up quickly. Then once their population is hooked...."
The100,335r08,Jay013,3,Sun Apr 19 22:27:51 2015 UTC,"heheheheh drugs.  Also, you do realize that's the exact premise that created the Reapers?"
The100,335r08,BysshePlease,3,Sun Apr 19 23:11:11 2015 UTC,"lol, yeah. But, if backed into a Mount Weather, who am I to say that I wouldn't turn my enemies into reapers and use them against their own people. If it's an option that keeps your people alive, lacking other options, you gotta do what you gotta do."
The100,335r08,Jay013,3,Sun Apr 19 23:37:19 2015 UTC,"Oh you misunderstood. I'm cool with the whole thing. Hell, I'll even offer my services if you fear for your safety. You just have to make sure you make enough and keep making enough. because if you get them hooked, and they can't get more, you're gonna get killed for it."
The100,335r08,BysshePlease,3,Sun Apr 19 23:46:49 2015 UTC,"We should be able to handle junkies going through withdrawal. We just need a supply that would last as long as it takes for the Grounders to become demotivated and have their bodies and minds atrophy. Then maybe offer it in exchange for any weapons or tech they find on the ground.  Edit: Maybe not even offer the narcotics to the whole population, but only to the military and political elites. Sell the drug as something only the baddest of badasses can get their hands on, in packaging with a cool anthropomorphic two-headed deer, both wearing sunglasses indoors while playing whatever equivalent to pool Grounders have."
The100,335r08,Jay013,2,Sun Apr 19 23:53:36 2015 UTC,"offer it in exchange for any weapons or tech they find on the ground.   Pretty sure you just figured out why the desert people looking for the city of light want technology.  But yes. I'm good with that. Though to be clear, I'm just working security. I'm not handling the drugs. I don't want them associating me with it."
The100,335r08,BysshePlease,2,Sun Apr 19 23:56:11 2015 UTC,"Hmm firstly producing narcotics is a little more challenging than it sounds, secondly I think they seem to have pretty good knowledge of the local greenery - I'd be surprised if you could find anything local that they don't already have.  Edit: another thing - if they had opiates on the ark they would have been synthesized from hydrocarbon precursors, not grown. Most modern medical drugs are made this way. It's highly unlikely that they would have coca plants or opium poppies on board the arc - frankly even the idea of them having marijuana is stretching it a bit. Without a pretty decent lab you'd have zero chance of synthesizing these things on the ground at this stage. If you manage to come across an old university basement you MIGHT be able to find enough intact glassware, you might even find some usable chemicals that could at least be repurified and made usable again, but that's a pretty long term plan."
The100,335r08,Kishara,2,Sun Apr 19 22:38:02 2015 UTC,"You make good points, though my control the grounder population through addictive substances a la crack cocaine and the CIA or red and Cage was in jest.  While the particular herb is not mentioned explicitly on the show, it's hinted that stealing marijuana was the reason why Monty and Jasper were incarcerated on the Ark. I wouldn't mind if Monty and/or Jasper at some point in the show's future went on a Walter White arc and became a megalomaniacal drug kingpin (though if this were to go down, I reckon Jasper would be the megalomaniacal one, and Monty would probably have more of a Gale Boetticher role).  I wonder where the nearest seed bank is, and whether it's been scavenged yet. That would make for an incredibly useful resource in the post-nuclear apocalypse world."
The100,335r08,ElenaOcean,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:31:36 2015 UTC,Oh I actually took it to mean that they stole some kind of narcotic but probably something synthesized. However they could well have had a seed bank on the arc.
The100,335r08,Kishara,3,Sun Apr 19 23:40:52 2015 UTC,"OK so this means that there is no need to run. We have tech, more specifically I have tech. Remember all that small tech I took instead of water bottles and food etc? We do some drawings of potential society upgrades for the Grounders. Then we explain just enough about solar power to interest them but still make it clear that without our help they will never get it done on their own. That way they need us and we can become intertwined economically with the grounders.  For their part of the trade, I am sure by now /u/ElenaOcean will want to wash her hair and it's my guess they have developed a whole host of cosmetics and toiletries Elena and I want."

I am going to go ahead and say though that I don't trust the Grounders, so I still say we keep an exit strategy in mind and have a plan in case this all goes south."
The100,335r08,ElenaOcean,2,Mon Apr 20 15:15:45 2015 UTC,"Yep as we know- the bastards can't be trusted. So we will keep our fail safe plan intact  but this is the ultimate best solution if we can get them to honor their word this time. Also, my skin is so damn dry by now, I would do anything to replace my empty Lubriderm lotion with an herbal equivalent- and I mean anything."
The100,335r08,Kishara,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:20:06 2015 UTC,since you said we were running away together last week I've stashed some supplies in a hiding place we can run to if someone in the group screws up. We can still slip away while they're all brawling. In the meantime let's stick around for now though to pick up some skin tips and swipe one of those awesome grounder jackets.
The100,335r08,ElenaOcean,2,Mon Apr 20 15:32:33 2015 UTC,"OH Yes we need some clothes along with some make up and skin care tricks.  I just want someone there to show me how to braid my hair!

Meanwhile I'm going to focus on relations. There is no point in an alliance if those you're allied with don't like you. I'll be talking with some of the Grounder warriors, holding common ground with some of the archers, I feel like we can bond over that. Talk techniques, greatest kill, show off skills...simple really. Share knowledge and experience  If the Grounders as a whole like us, then next time it comes to it, they may argue with their leader not to attack us. We only have our technology and medicine to offer. They hold the higher ground. Pun intended. So show them that we see and respect them, and become friends instead. Also we have bombs. We can show them that and blow shit up. Nothing bonds people together like blowing shit up :D  Of course we can't go into this empty handed. Arihadne, you okay with taking a little bit of everything from our farm to make a little gift basket for the Grounders?  TL;DR: Friends don't kill friends.

The100,335r08,ShaneH7646,2,Mon Apr 20 15:52:06 2015 UTC,it's more of a customs thing than a supply thing.
The100,335r08,Shotokanguy,2,Mon Apr 20 16:26:19 2015 UTC,"Hurray, representatives. I would suggest that we meet on as neutral ground as possible, which would be difficult because the area is Trigedakru territory apart from where we basically took over. The bridge is a good idea, but the tree-cover is very dense and a good place for hiding, as we saw in the show. We should set up the no weapons rule right away, and show that we do mean business by coming with several weapons hidden on ourselves, but leaving them in a pile. Ensure that our group represents a wide variety of people (although we're mostly homogenous) - don't have everyone at the peace talks be military-oriented. It's better to have a variety of people.  Ask what the hell is up with that acid fog, because it's definitely not something they would come up with and whoever causes it is an enemy to us both - the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Delay talking about terms and exchanges until after we have shared a meal of food from both the Trigedakru and our own supplies as a show of trust. Gift-basketing, as /u/Jay013 says. (In case of poisoning, I hope you're all fine with shoving your fingers down your throat because ipecac is made from South American plants and we don't have any emetics.)  Do we have Ark contact? If we do, I request a map of Washington before the bombs went off so that we can locate the supplies necessary to isolate and deactivate tetanus toxin (give me some pipettes, slide samples, beakers, heat, and formaldehyde) because that's probably a large problem in this world given the weapons that we've seen. If we don't have contact, we're going to have to jury-rig a microscope and gather samples from a person or animal who currently has tetanus, the methanol produced by the still that's been removed from the ethanol to keep it from being toxic because we need it for formaldehyde, which deactivates the tetanus toxin. This is a long-term project and one that would require careful set up but be highly beneficial because, while we as Arkers have had vaccinations, the Trigedakru have not. It's also a long-term project as they won't let us immediately start injecting foreign substances into their bodies and we don't want to be Tsukeege all over again. The WHO has a list of essential medicines for a reason and I doubt that list would have been lost, so it's a very good idea to figure out how we can make or substitute local knowledge to fill out the list (such as atropine from belladonna, willow bark for aspirin, etc).  It's important to emphasise the long-term part of the project, making it so that nothing helpful to the Trigedakru will come of it if we're all dead.  The problem with peace talks is that there's usually a third, impartial party involved to mediate. Lincoln might be the best for this task. From him, we know how the relations between various -kru are. During this discussion, we should not only talk about the immediate present, but about how our relationship can evolve in the future, as well as leave open the possibility for lesser demands to be discussed later. It's not just the absence of war that we're negotiating, but the ability for complete societies to exist alongside each other, including the weak and infirm. We have to make sure that the agreement reached continues to have benefits in the future so that both sides keep to it.  There are also several points in the greater Washington area that I would like to have explored, such as Fort Detrick (USAMRIID), the Library of Congress (which is probably full of poisonous mould by now, but we'll make breathing masks out of cloth and paper from the ""art supply depot""), and other sites that may be useful."
The100,335r08,wwhideanseek,3,Mon Apr 20 03:09:36 2015 UTC,"We should set up the no weapons rule right away, and show that we do mean business by coming with several weapons hidden on ourselves, but leaving them in a pile.   Sigh I said I would trust your decision, and I do. but do you trust them? It shows a lot to release our weapons first, but should we really give up ALL our weapons? Keep a knife hidden in a sleeve or a boot, or tucked behind you under a couple layer of clothes. Because if we give our weapons up first, it makes it a bit harder to fight back. I know the Grounders have a strict code of honor, but it's a lot to place your life on a principle.  Regardless of how it goes, I'll be the Gustus to your Lexa. Minus the betrayal of course. Well...maybe. I might keep an extra knife hidden which you'll get mad at me for later.  Also, here's something. The tents have been proven to keep people safe from acid fog. That said, we can sew together makeshift hazmat suits for a select team, allowing them to be mobile within the fog. I think that would prove to be very valuable to them."

Since Arihadne is my closest ally and friend right now, I'm going to consider Shane's plan as a threat. That said, we need something to offer the Grounder Commander.   ""Here's an assassin who attempted to take your life""  I would also throw in a pipe bomb, either mine or his, to show the weapon intended to be used. Besides, I'll need more than three cattails, a potato and some arrows to gift anyway...  I really don't want to sell out members of our group, but then again, Shane did threaten me for a knife last week. The last thing we need is some in-group fighting. We all know how that went in the show...  The alternative? Exile.  Choice is yours /u/ShaneH7646. If I'm cool with the Grounders, then they are my allies until considered otherwise.

And you're not considering Grounder scouts that are set up to take down any runners. Maybe they're there, maybe they aren't.

I feel like Jason also intentionally made her the only  blond character so that she's so distinguishable and in the even that she walks into a group of grounders when she's off on her solo mission they will instantly know it's her because these whispers will have been spreading and unsettling them and casting doubt on Lexa.

It must be common knowledge that Lexa betrayed the Sky people so the Grounders might be afraid of retaliation. No one will want to mess with Clarke and her people.
The100,3310uh,Jay013,15,Sat Apr 18 20:57:34 2015 UTC,"Well several Grounder's recognized her as the one that burned thei brother or sth  like that.

The100,331io6,Shotokanguy,9,Sat Apr 18 16:47:05 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Octaviaof the sky people is pretty iconic because of both hose reasons. First on the ground, the transformation and identity crisis, and general badassness. Easily in my top 5 favourites.   Also, 16 years trapped in the floor, she deserves the first step on Earth. But I still wouldn't want to play hide and seek with her xD  My favorite Octaviaof the sky people moment would probably be learning that first line of trigedasleng. That wasn't acting. Marie really was having difficulty speaking trigedasleng that her script had it written the way it spells in english. ""I like Octavia come sky crew"""
The100,331io6,Kishara,6,Sat Apr 18 17:56:21 2015 UTC,"Cool on the show, cool in real life. Don't want to imagine anyone else playing the role."
The100,331io6,manicmelancholic,3,Sat Apr 18 19:59:13 2015 UTC,"If you happen to browse  you tube for interviews with Marie, it is so worth your time. This girl has it going on. She is smart and thoughtful and obviously really intelligent. Oh and she happens to be a hell of an actor to boot. I just love what she has done with her character. She has become one of my very favorites."
The100,331io6,manicmelancholic,5,Sat Apr 18 20:07:30 2015 UTC,The first couple episodes I thought she was a terrible actress. Anyone who watched her transformation knows I'm an idiot. While Octavia had a few cringe worthy moments they ultimately made her transformation have way more impact. And she's the cutest girl on the show imo and I think she could pull off a lot of diverse roles on other shows now that I've seen her pull off Octavia's character so well.
The100,331io6,TechWiz717,2,Sat Apr 18 20:29:08 2015 UTC,Wait a second.. Kass Morgan is a chick?

The100,32zovz,Kishara,2,Sat Apr 18 03:08:36 2015 UTC,My memory is really foggy on this. We are rewatching season one but are only at episode 5. I do remember there being something about there not being enough room for everyone to go down to earth via the Exodus plan. But I really don't remember the specifics. Edit- I checked the off site wiki and there is a little bit more there.
The100,32zovz,Jay013,2,Sat Apr 18 04:16:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that says there are 7 exodus ships.  So what happened to the rest?"
The100,32zovz,Amonette2012,2,Sun Apr 19 19:53:37 2015 UTC,"Record keeper here not officially ! After Exodus failure, the Ark was crippled.    Power went out in different stations, also caused extreme temperature drops. Life Support went out in different stations (hence the oxygen deprivation faced by many) Hallways connecting different sectors were blocked off due to debris.   Getting people to individual dropships just couldn't be done due to these factors, and that's assuming it was safe to even launch them. The ""use the Ark as a dropship"" plan was a spur of the moment thing by Jaha."
The100,32zovz,Jay013,2,Sat Apr 18 05:08:24 2015 UTC,"I think that last sentence counts as a spoiler past this episode? Just removed it to be on the safe side, if you take out the last sentence we can approve it. If I'm wrong on this please feel free to yell at me but I think that last  line does refer to later in the season!"
The100,32zovz,Amonette2012,2,Sat Apr 18 12:35:44 2015 UTC,"I AM YELLING AT YOU!!! :P  It's not a spoiler past the episode, but it does happen near the end. It happens after Jaha declares, after everyone is gathered, that Ark resources are no longer rationed given the circumstances.  Removed it anyway"

The100,32xpar,Jay013,20,Fri Apr 17 16:04:32 2015 UTC,"I want Clarke to have an animal companion.  But because this is The 100, I'm pretty sure that her animal companion will die during a conflict between the Arkers, Grounders, and whoever the third faction will be this time around. Then Dark Clarke goes genocide on who ever the enemy is. It seems to be a trend so far. S1 finale: 300 dead Grounders. S2 Finale: 300 dead Weatherites. We already had our 300 dead Arkers back in S1E5.  Azgeda versus Trigeda. I just want to see a war between Grounders. No guns, no missiles. just good old fashioned blades, bows, and bludgeons.  Lol, Reaper rehab xD  I really do think Clarke's legacy will make the Grounders fear her. She's burned 300 of them alive in a war. She took down the entire mountain. Lexa knows that Clarke was left alone after the betrayal. Lexa will be dead scared. She'll start to regret that betrayal. Meanwhile there's a lot that could go on in the woods. Clarke might take down a group of bandit Grounders that a local village has been having trouble with. She might take down a feral animal that even the greatest Trigeda hunter couldn't take down. That's hoping for a bit too much though. When Lexa and Clarke meet, their parallel will continue. Lexa will be the one in need with Clarke being in the dominant position. hehe. dominant position"
The100,32xpar,BysshePlease,6,Fri Apr 17 17:48:19 2015 UTC,It'd be pretty awesome if Clarke basically became like Princess Mononoke.  Reaper Rehab would make a fun reality TV show (or at least a fun DVD extra).

The100,32xpar,Kishara,14,Sun Apr 19 22:36:43 2015 UTC,"I'm really interested in the new AI storyline. One of my theories from the night the finale aired is that the AI is being controlled by  puppet-masters ala Wizard of Oz. So that would mean the hologram is not sentient and there is someone behind the scenes who has caused the armageddon and is screwing with Jaha.   Say it was a group of people and they carried on for generations like the ark and the Mount Weather groups did. Perhaps they control a good portion of the earth and are not willing to allow any entry. They could be any number of factions in our current political landscape such as the middle east, a religious faction, an extreme environmentalist group, a doomsday cult etc...   I have more theories, but in the interest of coherency I'll post separately for each one."
The100,32xpar,BysshePlease,2,Fri Apr 17 16:48:28 2015 UTC,"I doubt an extreme environmentalist group would nuke the entire world considering the immediate environmental effects goes against any environmentalist group's entire ethos.  Since The CW's been on a huge comic book kick lately (with Arrow, The Flash, the superhero team-up series that's currently in development, iZombie), it would be kind of fun if the League of Assassins were behind ALIE and the nuclear apocalypse."
The100,32xpar,Kishara,5,Fri Apr 17 22:16:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about a normal environmentalist group, I personally agree with a lot of what the mainstream ones say. This is one of the really crazy whackjob ones that would blow the earth to eliminate humanity so the earth could heal itself kind of groups.   We do have a lot of really nutty social, political, and religious groups in existence. If the wrong people got ahold of the nukes it could be really freaky what they do with them."

On the other hand, our tech is moving along at an amazing pace. A few years ago the idea of colonizing another planet was considered a sign you may need to go in for a mental health check up. Now we are actively pursuing that end. In addition, the discovery of so many planets in the goldilocks zones of various systems is really promising for the possibility of moving humanity to more distant locations of the universe someday- once our tech can get a handle on how to get us there."
The100,32xpar,TripJammer,14,Sat Apr 18 00:19:59 2015 UTC,"Murphy will stay in character and do whatever is in his own best interest in the moment.  So the bunker of fine things will be his secret.  I'm really hoping Clarke meets up with an entirely new group, perhaps the Ice Nation.  It's unlikely that she won't run into any grounders walking in the direction she went though—straight toward Trikru territory."
The100,32xpar,mororon,8,Fri Apr 17 16:27:13 2015 UTC,It would be great if all we see of Murphy for the first few episodes of the season is him drinking and watching movies. He could return to the plot when the food ran out.

Let's say Emerson, given that he's able to go back there where everyone he knows is dead, can locate some stock of Red that remains. From there I envision a revenge-bent Emerson hiding in the mines, controlling a small army of Reapers. That might be a secondary antagonizing force at least?"
The100,32xpar,Dikeleos,3,Fri Apr 17 18:35:52 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting possible arc for Emmerson, until he runs out of Red.  Then, I reckon, Emmerson would try to appeal to the Woods Clan, since they've treated before, to help get his revenge on Clarke for killing everyone he knew. Maybe he'd have some info on how to cure the Reapers (since the Woods Clan certainly can't go to the Sky People  for help with that) to exchange for help in his mission. He'd tell the story of what happened, and that's how the legend of Clarke of the Sky People would spread."

The100,32xpar,To_a_life,2,Sat Apr 18 08:36:32 2015 UTC,I don't think Emerson would seek out the Tri Kru for help. Lexa would never allow a war unless they had a real reason.  If he does take the revenge plot then its likely to be solo or with the Ice Nation.(do we know the trigdasleng word for Ice Nation?) Still though in my opinion he won't actively seek revenge but I think he'll take an opportunity if one arises. Like if he runs into Clarke while they are both in the forest or is captured by the Ice Nation and learns they are at war with the Tri Kru.  I want him to get a redemption ark still though.
The100,32xpar,aajjjj,2,Fri Apr 17 23:53:50 2015 UTC,Ice Nation is Azgeda. And these are both interesting possibilities for his s3 arc!

Bellamy and Co. will have to figure out a way to live with the Trikru  I really hope:   Lexa and Bellamy have to work together for something. Dunno why but I think it would be fun to see the two of them interact.   Octavia and Raven make a Badass club- for badasses only.   MORE MONTY! Seriously, the kid is a genius and all he's done in the past 2 seasons is a couple of cool computer stunts. More screen time please! Plus he's just precious.

When did ALIE take over and surpass human ability to control her? Is there more than one AI group/individual? Are they at war with each other as well as with the human race?   I suppose we could ask the folks over at /r/singularity for some insight into this, but without knowing too much here is what I would guess:  There is more than one AI. One AI- lets call it the ALFH (artificial life for humanity)  wants to save mankind, and ALIE would like to utterly destroy it and ALFH as well (btw yes I know who Alf is and this is sorta intentional). ALIE has been restricted to a small area sorta like a house arrest. The arrival of the Sky People has given ALIE the opportunity to finally get out from under the restrictions placed on her by ALFH. ALFH has been trying to regrow the planet and reestablish humanity. Jaha wandering in when he did means that now ALIE has a significant chance to end humanity for all time."

The100,32xpar,ElenaOcean,3,Fri Apr 17 18:36:36 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, because of humanity's obsession with cats and ALFH's requirement to use cats as fuel to power its computer, it was never a popular AI which tragically make people favor ALIE which was content with solar power and had no grudge against cats.  I do like the multiple AI angle mostly because Person of Interest has been doing some brilliant things with the conceit (I hope at least a couple of the writers have watched Person of Interest regularly, particularly past season three, to avoid overlap and as a guide for one of the right ways to do AI stories)."

And most of the first season is just that. But from the second season on, the writers take bolder steps in exploring the notion of artificial intelligence, they take on and meticulously explore some significant thematic questions, and by the third season they really take off with the concept. On top of that, the series is character-driven and the arcs of Finch and Root are particularly rewarding; and when the show indulges in its more sensationalist action sequences, it's as thrilling and engaging as its more intellectual moments. If you can get to the end of the third season, I'm confident you'll at least see why it's become one of the smartest, most well-written, and exciting series currently airing."

Season 3 becomes a hunt for Clarke with Bellamy and the others in a race against time to reach Clarke before the grounders get to her.
