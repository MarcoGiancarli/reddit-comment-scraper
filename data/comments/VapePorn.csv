Although you can remove and spray paint the black ones.  The tank is bought on various websites such as Fasttech.  The black rings are also bought on Fasttech.  *I should note that an easier route can be taken by getting a silicone wrap on Sweetvapes and exchanging the tank for one found on virtually any vape site that has them. As for the battery showing through the back, use either black electrical tape or any color you want."

VapePorn,3dkugu,Jafacacke,2,Fri Jul 17 03:53:56 2015 UTC,"Isn't battery stacking a bad idea? When I switched to vaping and started building, every guide recommend avoiding stacking. Also why did you choose stacking over using a single 18650? Is it a size thing or is there more to it?"
VapePorn,3dkugu,Jafacacke,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:36:00 2015 UTC,When people say stacking is a bad idea they're normally referring to stacking in mech mods. In this mod the batteries are powering a chip(the chip needs at least 4 volts )and the chip is controlling the voltage

Holding this mod feels 10 times better because of the rubber texture and grip. I also have peace of mind that I don't have to super baby this mod.

VapePorn,3ddqxq,evergonitenitenigga,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:27:06 2015 UTC,All just Vinyl. But if you do it right you can't tell the difference without taking the sleeve off.
VapePorn,3ddqxq,zanloveless,2,Wed Jul 15 20:39:38 2015 UTC,looks nice man! i did the same thing with my zero but in wood grain

VapePorn,3dbv6y,GabrielGaetano,2,Wed Jul 15 01:42:10 2015 UTC,I want one of those so damn bad! Did you get a clone or autentic?
VapePorn,3dbv6y,snowphoto420,3,Wed Jul 15 01:43:07 2015 UTC,Have a clone and a authentic both perform the exact same tbh hardly any difference
VapePorn,3dbv6y,FatManLittleCoat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:54:42 2015 UTC,How long have you had the clone? I've read that the screws on the clones strip pretty easily.
VapePorn,3dbv6y,FatManLittleCoat,2,Wed Jul 15 03:50:26 2015 UTC,Mine have been good but only because I knew right away the tool they send isn't the right size so I just used a L wrench that was the right size
VapePorn,3dbv6y,FatManLittleCoat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:05:59 2015 UTC,"That was another thing. I mean, really? That's pretty cheap of them, even for a clone lol.   So, just make sure to use the right size wrench and all should be well? Any actual gripes about the clone in comparison to the authentic?"
VapePorn,3dbv6y,MLevin89,2,Wed Jul 15 04:08:53 2015 UTC,The only other thing besides the screwdriver is the lock isn't as smooth as the authentic. I got the clone from tobeco and honestly its worth 15 bucks no doubt
VapePorn,3dbv6y,Redbaronz360,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:28:57 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Not trying to nit-pick a $15 clone to death.

VapePorn,3d9l0l,eyeisdasteve,2,Tue Jul 14 15:54:34 2015 UTC,Which rda is that?
VapePorn,3d9l0l,FatManLittleCoat,5,Tue Jul 14 17:48:58 2015 UTC,Production RDA.
VapePorn,3d9l0l,Zamibe,2,Tue Jul 14 17:58:20 2015 UTC,Thats the 1.
VapePorn,3d9l0l,Zamibe,2,Tue Jul 14 18:11:07 2015 UTC,"I've heard it's nice, may pick up a clone."
VapePorn,3d9l0l,Zamibe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:41:38 2015 UTC,Its around $50 for the authentic. Which is not a bad price. Its similar to a tugboat. A little more airflow and the cap is slighty reduced.  Great atty overall so far.
VapePorn,3d9l0l,RangerRick61,-2,Tue Jul 14 19:46:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah I vape cheap, if I could afford the authentic I'd gladly buy it but $50 here $30 there and $70 here adds up quickly. Downvote all you want because $50 for a RDA is a lot IMO."
VapePorn,3d9l0l,Zamibe,2,Tue Jul 14 22:12:04 2015 UTC,"I agree it's expensive when there is something new each week to try. Best way is to buy the clone and if you like it, but the authentic. I myself am wanting to buy an authentic Aeolus."
VapePorn,3d9l0l,RangerRick61,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:56:55 2015 UTC,I really want to get an an authentic Twisted Messes RDA and a authentic Mutation X V4.
VapePorn,3d9l0l,Zamibe,2,Thu Jul 16 02:03:04 2015 UTC,Authentic Mutation X v4 is at a very comfortable price point actually. I just bought a black one my self. Great RDA when it's not leaking.

VapePorn,3d9nuo,jdiamond1122,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:20:23 2015 UTC,Got the evil monk yesterday so I haven't had that much time with it.  So far I like it.  It's only slightly taller than the derringer but theres not really any spit back.  Theres a slight learning curve when building it because you have to cut the leads VERY short so that the coils aren't too close to the top cap but they can't be so low that they touch the deck/airflow tubes.  It has great flavor and produces decent clouds.  Im not a cloud guy but Im running about a 0.3 ohm build and its really decent vapor production considering how good the flavor is.
VapePorn,3d9nuo,jdiamond1122,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:07:41 2015 UTC,That's good how's the flavor compared to the Derringer I have one running at about the same resistance
VapePorn,3d9nuo,twoshotracer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:10:06 2015 UTC,I think it's better all around than the derringer but i also might be kind of biased because i think the derringer is a piece of shit. lol

VapePorn,3d7ebu,nomer2,2,Tue Jul 14 03:56:32 2015 UTC,Vulcan is the company that makes the Vector.   Vulcan also made a self-titled atty a while back.

If you take the 5 minutes to learn how to build the RBA, it is cheaper and the flavor/vapor production is miles better. Of course it takes a few times to hit your personal sweet spot since user variation and error can occur."

It has the shops name on it. I just use it inside out. For the all black look. Helps with taking the vape out of my pockets as I have something to grip on.  He also said it was good to have on, to protect the glass.   Does anyone know where to get these rings online? Or even know the proper name for them?  Thanks."

VapePorn,3d61uw,Gunther_W,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:16:52 2015 UTC,"Facebook for the most part. Couple are painted/inked by a guy on facebook, same with one of the other patinas. One patina is done by Carlos (the creator of the mod).The Damascus sleeve is a versa. The one with the skulls is custom hydro-dipped, it glows in the dark.   Sleeves are expensive if you want nice ones, if you got the cash to shell out for em then by all means. But one or two sleeves (depending on the sleeve) would end up costing more then your clone you have.  You can always get a blank and get a vinyl on it or jwrap as a temp fix. I have that currently on one, but im going to be sending it to get turned into a comic sleeve."

VapePorn,3d3cvk,r3mus3,2,Mon Jul 13 04:53:29 2015 UTC,"A 100% VG juice had me intrigued so I went to their site to check out their juice. They say:   Our e-juices are made with VG only. We do not add PG and our juices are flavored at 15% for a smooth flavorful hit.   So I am assuming this means that it is just max VG with 15% of flavoring, so that would make it an 85/15 VG/PG blend, correct? Unless they are making their own flavor extracts using VG it isn't possible for a 100% VG juice, right?  If I'm wrong please someone let me know. If they're making their own extracts and it is 100% VG I will definitely be making a purchase."
VapePorn,3d3cvk,rwm5236,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:27:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I found that odd too when I saw it too. But I'm assuming their using VG for the flavoring since they say no PG...?

VapePorn,3d3cvk,rwm5236,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:52:43 2015 UTC,Regardless 85/15 is still a very high VG juice. Did you get anything else along with the Blackberry Custard? Thinking about getting that and the Bananas Foster. I dig the professional looking branding they use. Not a bad price too.

VapePorn,3d1p7n,MLevin89,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:38:18 2015 UTC,Its like a mixed fruit smoothie. It has the flavour of fruit but with a cereal undertone that makes it taste like a smoothie!

VapePorn,3d1p7n,24_newhere,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:55:43 2015 UTC,"The juice is made by Cosmic Fog, its part of the Lost Fog collection and the flavour is called Streak. I dont get what you mean by protruding 510. Its just screwed into the normal 510 on the ipv. If your on about the insulator for the drip tip i have that protruding, just put it the other way (screwed from the inside) and its doesnt sit right, mines a clone though so might be shoddy compared to the authentic."

VapePorn,3czkjs,static_motion,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:42:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but they should heat up at the same rate as well.  Probably want to try tightening up the screws on the coil that doesn't heat up as fast.  Just play around with it until you get them heating up at exactly the same rate."

VapePorn,3cuieu,patwesleyd,2,Fri Jul 10 21:54:27 2015 UTC,I'd also add to open up your airflow. It looks a bit tight. Make sure you are drawing air in fast enough to cool your vapor down.
VapePorn,3cuieu,Oceans_And_Plains,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:43:50 2015 UTC,"when i first got the delta 2 everything was fine, but my juice started to taste burnt so i changed my atty. after two or three consecutive hits, its tastes dry and burnt. my atty is reading .6 and i usually vape at 25 watts but turned it down to 21. can anyone help me, and not make me feel stupid about it haha"
VapePorn,3cuieu,SnapCrack1ePop,3,Fri Jul 10 21:56:33 2015 UTC,"Not familiar with the Delta 2, but it could most likely either be a wicking problem from using too thick of a juice, or your coils could be getting burned out. Also, when you change the coils, make sure that you give the juice time to wick the cotton and coil before you fire it to prevent prematurely burning the cotton."
VapePorn,3cuieu,MLK15,2,Fri Jul 10 22:00:06 2015 UTC,"What he/she said. Chances are you may have fired it before it was fully wicked, thus burning the cotton. Unfortunately, if thats the case, the coil will most likely never taste right."
VapePorn,3cuieu,4X4_FORD,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:08:13 2015 UTC,"I had the same issue when I first started man. Most likely you cooked your coil, like previously stated, make sure that you're giving the wick lots of time to soak up the juice. Close off your air and inhale without firing the vape to get it nice and wet. Let it set for around ten minutes just to be sure."
VapePorn,3cuieu,Elturiel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:49:34 2015 UTC,How long did you wait from changing the atomizer until you actually vaped it?
VapePorn,3cuieu,xlilshady,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:50:53 2015 UTC,How long have you had the coil? It might be time to get a new one.
VapePorn,3cuieu,Dogtired30,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:21:48 2015 UTC,Also make sure the juice channels on the delta 2 coils are fully opened if your using a higher VG.
VapePorn,3cuieu,33427,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:13:20 2015 UTC,i think it might be an issue with the delta coils. I had the same thing happen to mine. Everything was fine for like a day or two and then I got a burnt taste. I had the airflow all the way open and everything.   I just gave up on it.
VapePorn,3cuieu,koukiboi,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:43:47 2015 UTC,Looking at the comments it seems like the tank is the problem. But I own the Eleaf 50w with a OBS tank and for me it seems like the Eleaf is the problem. My coils go bad in a few days but when I put the tank on my snowwolf or Evic it lasts for weeks. Also the temp control doesn't work with the tank since it doesn't use nickle coils.   Worse is when the Eleaf starts to get low battery. The coils either get too hot too fast (and tastes burnt) or doesn't even fire at all. (talking about 15%-20% battery life) But who knows maybe its the delta 2 tank.

VapePorn,3cqs1r,Jesse4Lyfe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:36:39 2015 UTC,No problem! Enjoy it! I love that tank!
VapePorn,3cqs1r,Jobe422,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:40:05 2015 UTC,"Thinking of getting this clone, but I'm extremely new to mechs. What happens if you screw the pin back up? What pin are you even referring to?"
VapePorn,3cqs1r,Jesse4Lyfe,2,Fri Jul 10 19:07:38 2015 UTC,"This SMPL mech is know has a Hybrid type. What that means is, the part where you screw on your tank, or RBA, there is no pin. Just a hole, and the bottom of the tank, the pin, is what makes contact with the battery.  The issue with these mechs, is that, if you are not careful, the pin from the bottom of the atomizer/tank/rba, if it is not LONG enough, protrudes out the bottom of the threads, it will not make solid contact with the top of the battery, and bad things can happen.  The pin, that is your positive, the deck is the negative. If the top of the batter makes contact with both the positive and negative(as in the pin is screwed up into the threads, so the bottom pin is flush with the thread housing), you can have a short, or a really bad failure, like a venting battery.  This is why hybrid mechs are not recommended for those who want a first mech, tho, the reason is just knowing what you are doing. You have to understand not only ohm-law, making coils for your battery specs, etc, but understand the power you have in your hand that is unregulated. Making sure the pin on the bottom of whatever atty is long enough to make contact with the battery. Its all about staying safe and having a great vape experience!"
VapePorn,3cqs1r,Jobe422,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:47:48 2015 UTC,"So what type of mech would you recommend for a first mech? I really don't want to mess with something I'm not ready for yet.   This is great information by the way, thanks. :)"
VapePorn,3cqs1r,Jesse4Lyfe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:26:06 2015 UTC,"Ya know, that's kinda hard to say, if you posted this question into r/ECR you will get a lot more input.  My suggestion would be to look for something like a Nemisis or Stingray, it has a 510 pin on top.  You will also see people talk about magnets. Well, for a lot of mods, the bottom switch/button usually has a spring inside to make it stiff. This is a piece that needs to be taken out from the switch from time to time and cleaned, to make sure you have solid contacts. People will upgrade these springs to magnets for a more ""reliable"" switch and solid feel to the button.  You can get a good one from $20-$40 and not break the bank. But you need to use quality batteries in them. Make sure you know the Amp limits of your batteries, not your pulse rate. Example, a Sony VTC4 has a 30a output, where as a Samsung 25r is rated for 25a. So, you can safely build a 0.20Ohm coil on a 30a battery but it would be a big no no for 25a, pretty close to the limit the battery can take.  http://www.steam-engine.org/  This is a great site to calculate ohms/resistance, watts, amps, volts, etc to make sure the coil you use is safely within the limits of the battery.  And please, ask questions if you are ever confused! :D"
VapePorn,3cqs1r,Jobe422,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:44:12 2015 UTC,"Fantastic!!!   Thanks so much! I already posted on there once asking for suggestions and everyone told me the SMPL, but I guess I'm not ready for that yet, haha.   I'll ask again and have them keep that I'm a beginner I'm mind. Thanks a lot!   Also, where would I buy these upgrades? For the magents instead of a spring?"
VapePorn,3cqs1r,Jesse4Lyfe,2,Fri Jul 10 23:55:32 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, the SMPL is great. I have two of them. One is a clone that came with magnet switches, and the other is the AMOD WOTOFO SMPL clone.   http://www.supermagnetman.net/index.php?cPath=135&osCsid=554306bb4370c24d74d6be70638baa15  This site has been linked before to find magnets of the right size for your mod.  www.vapecrawler.com is also great for looking for vape gear.  By all means, I'm not trying to scare you away from hybrid mech like the SMPL, you just need to do a lot more research, ask a lot of questions and keep safe. If you don't feel comfortable, just don't do it. Safety is paramount, learn to be safe first and the rest will follow."
VapePorn,3cqs1r,Jobe422,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:00:08 2015 UTC,"Wow! You're a person who replies fast!   OK, last question for you!   Why did you put ""reliable"" in quotations?   Do the magnets cause problems or something? I'd honestly feel a lot safer with magnets than a spring.   Ok, I think I'll pick a SMPL after I've dealt with another mech. Hopefully /r/ecr can recommend me something. Yeah, I still need to buy an ohm checker and I need to build my first coil!   I'm using a subox right now and while I really like it, I just can't get over how sexy mechs look. I'm not really in the market right now, I'm just window browsing, but it never hurts to know what you want!   Everyone is right, I don't think I'll be saving money by vaping, haha."
VapePorn,3cqs1r,betweenthebobbynlee,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:05:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm hanging out right now. :D  If you get a SMPL, make sure you get an atty that has a protruding pin, if you get one that is adjustable, notice my comment way above, you can have an issue of hitting your fire button and slowly twist that screw back up and become flush with the threads, and that's a bad time. There's a lot to keep in mind with a hybrid. ;)  I put it in quotes because, springs will wear out. Magnets won't wear out like a spring, thus making it more ""reliable"" in that sense. But, ya still gotta keep it clean and you can break those magnets if you are too rough with them!  Make sure you have some Iso 91% or higher around, and depending on the mod you get, it wouldn't hurt to have something like Brasso around to keep the metal clean, it could be brass, SS, copper.  And yes, get that OHM reader before you build on a mech, get some Sony's or Samsungs, like I said, mind your Amp rate, use the calculator.  https://illuminationsupply.com/  A great place for batteries and chargers.  My SMPL and Derringer  Edit: There will be a learning curve, like anything...but a tip if you get a SMPL, when you hit the fire button, always hit it directly in the center to avoid a mis-fire. You can sometimes hit it at an angle and it won't fire. Also, if you ever feel your bottom switch get hot, and I mean hot, you'll know, put it down, if you can take the battery out, take it out, if it's too hot, try to put it somewhere safe and let it do it's thing."

VapePorn,3cr797,betweenthebobbynlee,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:01:35 2015 UTC,"My main tips fromt hat picture would be, first try to pinch the coils closer together unless you're going for spaced coils. The best way to pinch them and keep them together would be to dry fire the coils then just squeeze from bot sides with a pair of tweezers or needle nosed pliers. Second try to center them more, it may sound a little redundant, but if they are centered it wicks exponentially better because if the cotton strands are different lengths on either side of the coil one side will wick faster, leading to uneven amounts of juice on the coil causing one side to be more likely to burn. Happy vaping, and good luck with your future builds!"

VapePorn,3cove9,I_CRY_WHEN_JIZZING,0,Thu Jul 9 17:12:28 2015 UTC,I've been steering clear of the Milk & Honey flavour recently due to the high diacetyl levels.
VapePorn,3cove9,Cheesusaur,5,Thu Jul 9 17:09:46 2015 UTC,Here's what I think about diacetyl. Tell us its in there so we can make our own decisions to vape it or not. Me personally I couldn't give a flying fuck I'll vape it anyways. but I wanna know if its in there and how much.

VapePorn,3cm67k,Joelou123,3,Thu Jul 9 01:45:59 2015 UTC,You probably get one that fits it when you buy it?

VapePorn,3cnah4,EddardTheImp,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:07:19 2015 UTC,The main thing that bugs me about the tugboat boxes is its just a reused hexohm box with a hole filler where the potentiometer and chip removed. They could've done something cooler but I appreciate that they do have an official tugboat box instead of just a tugboat edition hexohm. I can respect that.
VapePorn,3cmqs9,frito_love,4,Thu Jul 9 02:51:04 2015 UTC,That is an odd build friend.

VapePorn,3cmqs9,U_DONT_KNOW_MY_LIFE,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:16:52 2015 UTC,I would think so. The velocity doesn't have airflow for single coils.

Love the atty, this has become my new daily driver. Only complaint is that the size of the grub screws is different from most and it was difficult to find a hex driver that fit it. But, home depot carries a $15 precision screwdriver kit that has it in it."
VapePorn,3cltj4,mcSATA,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:32:21 2015 UTC,It does get hot because it's made of metal. I just use the derlin 510 adapter and throw on a cherry vapes wide bore drip tip... But the RH awesome and the honey comb chuff really stops juice well

VapePorn,3cjjdi,sunnydubz,3,Wed Jul 8 12:10:09 2015 UTC,"wait, the kayfun nano bell cap fits right off the shelf on the goblin? How about a goblin mini?"
VapePorn,3cjjdi,cloudrazer,2,Wed Jul 8 15:21:00 2015 UTC,It certainly does! The exact same as the Silverplay. Works with the nano chimney that comes with the Goblin. I'm pretty certain you could also use the other Kayfun V4 bell cap with the larger chimney.
VapePorn,3cjjdi,dak_181,2,Wed Jul 8 15:47:14 2015 UTC,"Wait but the goblin doesn't have a threaded base, does that mean the tank is just kinda press fit on there?"
VapePorn,3cjjdi,dak_181,2,Wed Jul 8 17:43:16 2015 UTC,It does thread. There are threads under the bottom metal piece. You just need to remove the bottom piece (not AF or the small section above it) See photo and you'll understand the bit I'm talking about.   FYI mine is a v1.2 however I don't think it would matter what version. Kayfun parts are still interchangeable throughout.
VapePorn,3cjjdi,msixtwofive,2,Wed Jul 8 17:53:44 2015 UTC,Hmmm I just got rid of my goblin or I'd check. Maybe I had the 1.0 cuz I don't remember anything I could have taken off like that. It used the chimney to tighten itself down and seal on the o rings.
VapePorn,3cjjdi,OHIOhms,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:26:47 2015 UTC,"almost all recent tanks I've known of built off the kayfun base, I've got a ton of frankenstein setups from this fact."

VapePorn,3cjjdi,derivitiv77,2,Wed Jul 8 13:25:25 2015 UTC,I got mine from an eBay seller for £4.99. I'm pretty sure you could get the exact same one off Fasttech or eBay US.

VapePorn,3cft2f,spade1s1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:31:48 2015 UTC,I like it pretty well. Like anything it's not perfect. It's definitely a less messy tank. It took longer than expected for the taste to be perfect but it's now my favorite tank.
VapePorn,3cft2f,spade1s1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:42:57 2015 UTC,Update: I woke up last week with a hangover and a shipping confirmation email lol. So now I have the Atlantis V2 and although I only have one day of use under my belt I have to say hollllllllllly shit this is a well designed device. And the .3 coils work sooooo well. Hope they don't blow out fast though.

VapePorn,3cg5p9,oldbay410,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:58:07 2015 UTC,I use the zephryus on one of my setups. I love it. Great flavor and airflow but not too much airflow like the Atlantis v2 in my opinion. I like the top fill a lot too.  My only issue with it is that it leaks from the bottom from time to time. Besides that it's great.   Haven't tried the rba yet however

I bought some replacement 0.5 OCCs, but they were the old horizontal style, and IMO they are subpar in flavor compared to the vertical."
VapePorn,3cc1fm,DarthRasta,2,Tue Jul 7 14:56:54 2015 UTC,I just received today a pack of .5 OCC but the old style as well.. I figured I should have some in between trying to make my own builds

VapePorn,3cc9z0,A_Supple_Leopard,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:39:20 2015 UTC,I've seen multiple builders recommend you build your coils as far out from your post (Closer to the wall of the atty) so the molten hot juices spitting up doesn't go up the drip tip lol  Helped reduce a lot of spit back on my derringer
VapePorn,3cc9z0,LemonsFoSho,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:12:19 2015 UTC,Do you get a full puff off of it?
VapePorn,3cc9z0,rmbarrett,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:47:48 2015 UTC,Why the hell do you need 200 watts? It's not like you can really hit it at that high
VapePorn,3cc9z0,Rromeo87,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:20:39 2015 UTC,I think everyone thinks so lol  But this mod also has Temp control for a affordable price compared to other mods like the DNA40/SXMini which cost $200+.  Snowwolf looks nice + 200w and accurate temp control so It's a great value really.

VapePorn,3bxf7a,zanloveless,2,Fri Jul 3 06:03:51 2015 UTC,Did you ever have one of the others? Like a v2.1 for example?
VapePorn,3bxf7a,jliehr,0,Fri Jul 3 01:38:52 2015 UTC,"No, this is my first flask but I'm loving it"
VapePorn,3bxf7a,vapingatfifty,2,Fri Jul 3 07:22:33 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you like it, I was just wondering how it compares!"
VapePorn,3bxf7a,White-runner,2,Fri Jul 3 14:47:45 2015 UTC,Very cool ... Looks like the screen might be bigger as well .   How are you liking the Triton ?
VapePorn,3bxf7a,vapingatfifty,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:40:04 2015 UTC,Yes the screen is bigger now but the tank is alright to much air for me but i still need some more time and i need to try out the other coil

VapePorn,3bxf7a,wessiide,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:24:13 2015 UTC,Yes they teamed up with vapor flask
VapePorn,3bxf7a,SickerThanASneeze,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:22:56 2015 UTC,The OCD screw still hasn't been moved :(
VapePorn,3bxf7a,I_CRY_WHEN_JIZZING,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:16:46 2015 UTC,Which screw?
VapePorn,3bxf7a,skunkworx,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:49:29 2015 UTC,"The chassis screws near the 510. They are aligned to the center of the curve of the entire device. When an RDA is attached, the closest one gets half covered. I would have used the 510 as their center instead."
VapePorn,3bxiy1,Victorious666,3,Thu Jul 2 23:44:27 2015 UTC,Black looks SEXY on that mod... Did you do it yourself or is there a black option?! Definitely wasn't when I bought mine...now I'm jealous.
VapePorn,3bxiy1,rabidbasher,2,Fri Jul 3 04:23:08 2015 UTC,It's a option all black or stainless and black
VapePorn,3bxiy1,mcSATA,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:28:37 2015 UTC,Wow. Yeah that wasn't even an option on the site I got mine from.  Have you pulled your charging board out yet?

VapePorn,3bw5ne,kDAVR,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:15:33 2015 UTC,I am enjoying it. The thing I'm learning about White Label is that they're very hit or miss.

VapePorn,3bxefq,PigeonFetus,2,Fri Jul 3 00:19:44 2015 UTC,Yeah definitely the best priced mod for the amount of power! Have you tried temperature control? is it as bad as they say?
VapePorn,3bxefq,G_Art33,2,Fri Jul 3 00:22:13 2015 UTC,"Not really. A few people said NOT to use Ni200/Nickel with it, only Kanthal so I really don't know what to do. I used it once with my RDA at 450F - 60W and dried my cotton out, didn't really get a strong burnt taste but I decided not to take my chances using it with Kanthal and I don't have any Nickel and don't care to bug any as I'm perfectly happy with Kanthal and normal Wattage mode."

VapePorn,3btp21,Naturalgut,2,Thu Jul 2 01:47:11 2015 UTC,How do you like that Thundercloud Plus? I've been dying to get one but I haven't heard any reviews on it. I also want to pick up their mod too called the Guillotine.
VapePorn,3btp21,_Dotty_,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:56:54 2015 UTC,The thundercloud plus is a great atty. the deck is very easy to build on with a deep juice well. The airflow options are solid. Adjustable horizontal airflow is nice and you can run it at 70 watts shutdown half way for good flavor or you can crank the watts way up and use the plus sign airflow to chuck clouds with decent flavor. The build quality is top notch everything fits well and it is snug in all the right spots. I run a twisted build at .3 flat in it and it is just about perfect. I don't run it in mechs very often as I would have to build lower than I am comfortable with to get the warm vape that I like but it is my everyday atty on my sig 150.
VapePorn,3btp21,_Dotty_,2,Fri Jul 3 18:39:15 2015 UTC,The only thing that I'm wavering on is the fact that the post holes seem a little small. I usually build with 22g and sometimes like to go down to 20g. I'd like to comfortably able to fit dual coils with 20g in the center post.   Any insight?
VapePorn,3btp21,_Dotty_,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:43:09 2015 UTC,"Should be no problem, in fact they actually ship them with 20g coils installed. I have had no issues running dual triple and quad twisted 28g in it so a standard dual 20g would be no problem. Also pick up the JMK drip tip specially made for it, they are just about perfect if you are into delrin tips."

VapePorn,3btg3h,DJRIPPED,2,Thu Jul 2 08:33:54 2015 UTC,Almost worth it...if there's none in the stores in my area I may have to grab it. I'd try fasttech but the last couple tips I got from them were a bit shoddy.

VapePorn,3bt54s,LemonsFoSho,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:20:58 2015 UTC,"Well, you can see the vapor in it. And the cooling effect it has is actually legit to an extent. It's less than an inch tall, so it only had so much effect, but I do notice my 2 ohm builds are easier to hit, because the vapor is just a bit cooler. I like it, but I've heard people say they didn't notice any change. So, I'd say, try it out! Doesn't hurt, and you paid for it, so why not hook it up once or twice?"
VapePorn,3bt54s,Prison_Vape,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:54:51 2015 UTC,"Oh I haven't purchased it yet lol  Might pick one up soon, but just been wondering since I've seen a lot of people with it on and off."

VapePorn,3biq4p,DarthRasta,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:07:59 2015 UTC,"Very flavorful. I'd recommend the Bambino or the Derringer for the Kbox. It was getting hot when I chain vaped it, so since the Kbox has a fixed 510, I unscrewed the 510 on the RDA a little tiny bit to make a slight gap between the box and rda to reduce any heat conduction. Works like a charm doing that. Banging flavourful clouds from a compact VW device."

VapePorn,3bctcs,jayembee67,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:21:12 2015 UTC,How is it working out for you? Would an all-nickel clapton work even better?
VapePorn,3bctcs,Bobz216,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:08:04 2015 UTC,"It's working pretty darned well. I think that the Kanthal throws off the sensing in some way as I am running the mod at a lower temperature than I had expected (folks talk about 420F as a good starting point but I have settled on 360F which seems plenty hot for me) but the TC kicks in just fine and as the wick dries out it kicks in earlier and even when the cotton is pretty much exhausted I am not burning anything. And no dry hits. Not quite sure how an all-nickel Clapton would affect the TC but I suspect that you might end up with too few wraps on the coil. Not sure. But the benefit of the Kanthal core, as I see it, is that it makes the wire stiff and easy to work with and there was no leg slicing when tightening down the post screws."
VapePorn,3bctcs,Bobz216,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:10:35 2015 UTC,"Oh, I thought you did a nickel core with kanthal wrap. Why would you end up with too few wraps on the coil?"
VapePorn,3bctcs,Bobz216,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:14:32 2015 UTC,"No, most of the current will flow through the nickel as it is lower resistance, so that is what will heat up and so you want the wrap as nickel. But you are right, I am wrong (it's early yet, not enough coffee...), a nickel core would lower the overall resistance again and result is MORE wraps needed not less.  At least I think... But really, I was more concerned about adding mechanical stiffness and preventing the post screws from slicing the legs, I had read a lot about how delicate and tricky all nickel coils are, hence the Kanthal core.  Plus I have been using normal Claptons recently and really like the taste improvement, so Claptons plus TC seemed a good plan!"

VapePorn,3b4lc4,g000dness,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:31:08 2015 UTC,"I love dolomite, but it's probably because I enjoy that thick bourbon vanilla so much. I'm a big scotch/bourbon drinker so it's perfect for me :)"

VapePorn,3b34ft,IAMA_SWEET,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:14:04 2015 UTC,"Try poking a hole straight through the wick with a needle. If not a hole, just loosen up the cotton a bit. Kanger supposedly packs the wick pretty tight in there, but both of my friends who have sub tank minis never have this problem with the occ coils. It tasted fine to me too without tampering with it. Are you positive your purchasing actual Kanger coils and not some type of clone."
VapePorn,3b34ft,joshuageralddaigle,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:43:10 2015 UTC,Flavor is alright with the Kanger heads. I threw a clapton in in my rebuildable deck and man she is delicious.

VapePorn,3b37fs,nomer2,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:27:46 2015 UTC,I can't say enough great things about them. I started with a 2 bottle subscription and moved to a three. Most recently they accepted me as a tester for their house juice line that is very good. I get an extra free 15 ml every month and review it for them.  If you do sign up use my referral code 27ab8a1! It will get you 20% off your first month and me a 5$ credit.  I wrote a review with all the juices I had received solar and posted it to reddit a while back.

VapePorn,3b3shh,ihateaggies,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:02:07 2015 UTC,nice. My gf just got the subtank mini today in black but she has your same istick 30w and she loves it. I was wondering do you use the RDA? I cannot tell in the pic. I am using the v1 RDA and it is clunky if you do not build it just right. My gf has the v2 with the new air holes. Lastly what flavor profile is that juice?
VapePorn,3b3shh,Dharmabum12,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:13:19 2015 UTC,"Got the tank used and didn't get an RDA with the tank.  Its the Nano, not the mini.  I will try out the RDA on the new subbox I ordered when it arrives.  Juice is called Kraken and is basically a smooth subtle orange crush flavor."

VapePorn,3b0hrd,g000dness,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:20:23 2015 UTC,I have a smpl that I use with the royal hunter. I want a derringer pretty badly. Could you tell me the pros and cons? What build do you use? If I put a .1 build in there would it be OK or too hot you think?
VapePorn,3b0hrd,g000dness,2,Thu Jun 25 12:29:14 2015 UTC,"Pros: tiny, easy to build on; good sized post holes, holds together nicely; not too tight or loose. Good airflow and juice wells for its size.  Cons: can splatter in your mouth sometimes due to low clearance from coil to tip, but that only happens when you put too much juice in. Sometimes juice accumulates on the roof of the top cap and drips down when you remove the cap, but that wipes off just fine and doesn't leak when the cap is on.  You could probably run a .1 coil in it. I run a .2 Ohm 24ga dual Kanthal coil and it does fine in terms of temperature."

VapePorn,3awglc,Oceans_And_Plains,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:29:39 2015 UTC,"It is basically an OKR T10 regulated mod with the source lead going to a power supply rather than a battery sled. I found a 5V 10A power supply that could handle it and then used a laptop jack for ease of connection. Also, you don't need some of the fail safe items such as a zener diode since there is no risk of battery damaging low voltage or polarity protection as the jack always goes in the same way and cannot be accidently reversed.  http://i.imgur.com/2qbeFi7l.jpg  No batteries means that there is so much room for activities."

I already had all the parts from previous builds (except for the OKR T10) or else I would've ordered this kit and simply used a different power connector.  https://nonameboxmods.com/OKR-T10-Passthrough

VapePorn,3ascs9,CreatorofNirn,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:10:16 2015 UTC,Is there any benefit from the rubber ring around the Atty? I've seen them before and they look badass aesthetically just wondering.
VapePorn,3ascs9,happytor,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:11:36 2015 UTC,They are good for tanks and rdas because if you happen to to drop your vape then the rubber band (vapebands) should absorb the shock and prevent damage to your tank/rda

He hand carves the wood and hand burns the pictures into it. The battery slide is made out of purple heart wood and the rest is bubinga (not exactly sure how to spell it). The wiring is super durable because he hollows out paracord and feeds the wire through that. It's unregulated and hit like a monster with dual parallel 18650 batteries. I absolutely love it. Totally worth every cent."

VapePorn,3aq8ni,nyteryder79,2,Mon Jun 22 21:06:25 2015 UTC,Honestly if it's for flavour and clouds and you can take lung hits I would go for the sigelei and atlantis. I can only do 3 nic max with the sigelei and atlantis v2 combo. I prefer to use this at home because of it's monster clouds. I feel uncomfortable to be blowing that big of a cloud in public.  I love the new kanger kit but I don't know how to explain but I feel that you taste the tank or paint with Kanger. It goes away after awhile but it's still kind of there. I take this unit to work and out because it's not too big and does the job. I can go higher in nic with this mod too.  both are good both are good to have.
VapePorn,3aq8ni,nyteryder79,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:39:21 2015 UTC,Thanks for the comparison.  I'll stick with my Sigelei and Atlantis for now.

VapePorn,3ar374,El_DuderinoDan,2,Tue Jun 23 00:10:51 2015 UTC,It's the competition cap and drip tip from the same company that makes the Aeolus. Makes the Aeolus both a cloud chasing and flavor chasing atty.

VapePorn,3apoie,whyisitnotworking,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:56:13 2015 UTC,I'd highly suggest the Aeolus over all of those. The Mutation is nice for cloud chasing but lacks flavor compared to the Aeolus and can be leaky at times. The Tugboat is nice all around but for that kind of money you might as well get something innovative like the Aeolus. Just my two cents.

Here's a pic of the build   http://imgur.com/VrH9vsS  http://www.sweetspotvapors.com/category_s/1854.htm  Thank me later"

VapePorn,3ammq6,HolyResErection,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:10:45 2015 UTC,"ohms are a measure of resistance, so normally the higher the resistance the less power is allowed through. You're just recreating that concept.   tldr; Consider it a inverse relationship, ohms and necessary power."

Just never charge it unattended and with an atty on and also take the atty off if you won't be using for a while. I also turned it off a lot when putting in my pocket cause it accidentally fired off a few times and the lock feature doesn't apply to the power button, only settings."

VapePorn,3ale9k,Jw20VT,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:34:04 2015 UTC,I bought mine the day my shop got it in. They have them online for around $80 but that's the cheapest I found. Got mine for $100 in shop so I didn't have to wait for shipping. It's so worth the $80 man I have been using it every single day as my daily vape. Pretty light too so it's portable and fits in your pocket

VapePorn,3agt1n,Mucho_gennaro,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:38:40 2015 UTC,LOL This just happened to me! I bought a new stereo and they took out the big and bulky stock Honda radio and the new Alpine came with a little section under it just like that. So perfect for my Sigelei :)

VapePorn,3ag8mh,afuriouspuppy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:14:03 2015 UTC,How's the actual mod. I have had my eye on this for a compact little travel set up as well. But I had an original Kbox and the battery life was garbage.
VapePorn,3ag8mh,Tednewjam,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:17:57 2015 UTC,"Battery life is ok.  I can get a full day out of it, with moderate use.  If I want to go out that night I will usually charge a new battery.  The one time I forgot to switch out the batteries, I was able to use the usb charging for the night and it wasn't too much of a hassle.  I noticed that the usb charging doesn't give the same ""quality"" of charge.  Meaning that the battery life from USB doesn't equal the battery life from the charge station."
VapePorn,3ag8mh,afuriouspuppy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:43:00 2015 UTC,How's the flavor?
VapePorn,3ag8mh,FuckThePhalanx,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:10:37 2015 UTC,The flavor is really good if you adjust it correctly.  I used the same juice on my unregulated mod and it failed to compare to the subtank + box kit

VapePorn,3afba1,DJRIPPED,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:19:40 2015 UTC,Both mods have an origenny v2 on top
VapePorn,3afba1,coquio,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:11:25 2015 UTC,Origenny masterrace
VapePorn,3afba1,DJRIPPED,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:28:19 2015 UTC,"Honest question here. The most I've spent on an atomizer is $100. How is an Origenny better than a run of the mill RDA with a bottom fed squonk pin, or without it? I see most people who spend $350.00 + on a mod also tend to go for Norbert Atomizers. And my conclusion [somewhat prejudiced and biased] is that some people will always say give me your most expensive ____. I imagine the flavor must be very good, but I have a Vertex 2, a Hobo V3, a Mini Haze RDA, a Royal Hunter and a Bambino Atty. [Not exactly the cheapest RDA's] I've played all over the Ohm Range from 0.16 - 1.7. I've played with Claptons extensively as well, and I can honestly say that I think I know what I'm doing, and that what I'm doing is ""the way to go."" How am I missing out? Why should I spend $170 on a atomizer with a billion parts that is more complicated to set up?"
VapePorn,3afba1,Enyawreklaw,3,Sat Jun 20 15:28:59 2015 UTC,"Why the Origen Genesis? Well for me, looking into authentic Genesis tanks, the Origenny is the most versatile. It works well with cotton, mesh, rope, etc. Norbert is an extremely well known designer and if anything happens to your device you can contact them and it will be solved.   Think of it this way..... You're a factory worker that is on his/her feet all day. Would you rather spend $50 on decent boots that run the risk of wearing a hole in the sole in a year or get a pair of $200 boots that will last you a lifetime?"
VapePorn,3afba1,DJRIPPED,3,Sat Jun 20 21:11:48 2015 UTC,"For one, it's not difficult to set up at all. The origenny is one of the easiest atties to build on IMO  For me, the origenny is the absolute perfect balance of flavor and vapor. Not matter what new hyped atty comes out, I always end up back with the origenny. It more than meets the price tag  Norbert's drippers are second to none as well"
VapePorn,3afba1,foodbudglasslife,-4,Sun Jun 21 04:25:21 2015 UTC,"Same reason people buy Roberto Cavalli and Louis Vuitton. The name, and the justification of the ""better materials"" is an afterthought."

VapePorn,3afba1,psychogenicc,2,Sat Jun 20 21:12:01 2015 UTC,"way off. those ""luxury brands"" are a poor comparison and have no real application on every-day use/performance. just a waste of money for fashion.   norbert makes atties for more than just looks. they are designed to last and to perform.   when you've used a lot of cheap RDAs and arrive to a Norbert, the quality is next to none. makes you think twice how much other companies have cheaped out and/or overprice something bc of hype."

VapePorn,3af4pi,Maddbammer,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:39:21 2015 UTC,The only thing I have to say about the doge is it gets hot cause of the lack of heat sink fins. The air flow is great. Super easy to build cause the huge holes in the posts and it looks great. I'm a big fan of the chuff tip too. Reservoir isn't big but the height of the posts works out in that you can use more cotton because the coils are higher up  Edit: it also looks really really good on 22mm stainless steel mech mods. I have an SMPL and the only reason I don't use that combo is cause I like VW.

VapePorn,3a7bhj,T4COF4CE,2,Wed Jun 17 22:42:37 2015 UTC,Actually I love it. It's easy to build holds a good but of cotton and doesn't really leak. Decent flavor and good clouds. And I'm not even to low. Just siting at a .3 ohm dual 24g.
VapePorn,3a7bhj,carrote,2,Wed Jun 17 22:56:30 2015 UTC,"Awesome! I'm getting my first RDA soon, and this was my too choice. If you don't mind me asking one more question, how many wraps are you running?"
VapePorn,3a7bhj,OHIOhms,2,Wed Jun 17 23:06:24 2015 UTC,My normal dual could build is 6 wraps of 24g around a 2.7 mm rod. All though I might put a 22g build on this box mod.
VapePorn,3a7bhj,trifluoperazine,2,Thu Jun 18 00:17:30 2015 UTC,Does your dark horse catch a LOT of juice in-between the air flow control and the actual cap itself? I can't change my airflow without juice seeping out :(
VapePorn,3a7bhj,theswiveler,2,Thu Jun 18 02:22:52 2015 UTC,It does but I just keep it on the same setting prettying all of the time so it doesn't bother me.
VapePorn,3a7bhj,trifluoperazine,2,Thu Jun 18 16:37:45 2015 UTC,It that a clone castigador? Got a yesterday and it's nice but a little sharp around the corners. And the springs on the bottom makes it hard to get the battery in.
VapePorn,3a7bhj,theswiveler,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:38:50 2015 UTC,I have both the Vaping Dream Castigador clone and the authentic eVe Castigador.  The corners are a little sharp on both my clone and authentic. The corners on the bottom are a bit more pointy on my clone than my authentic.  The door on my clone doesn't swing out far enough so I have to compress the spring near the hinge to remove or insert a battery there. The door on my authentic swings out just far enough for straightforward swapping of batteries. The springs on both are quite stiff.  I must have gotten really unlucky since the quality on my clone is absolutely horrible and my device has every single issue described among all the reviews currently posted on Angelcigs. I consider my clone pretty much dead on arrival.
VapePorn,3a7p46,DEMT22,2,Wed Jun 17 21:45:40 2015 UTC,What ohm are you running? I tried the sigelei 150w with my V2 but it got super hot very fast even at alike 30 watts. So hot my lips were feeling burned.
VapePorn,3a7p46,Flyingsoggynoodle,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:34:18 2015 UTC,I usually run at 50w-70w.  I use the .3ohm coil.  I haven't had any problems at all.  I run the tank wide open.  What coil are you running?
VapePorn,3a7p46,Flyingsoggynoodle,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:15:11 2015 UTC,I tries the .3 and .5. Maybe I got a bad mod or more likely bad coils.

VapePorn,3a2r42,Zamibe,2,Sun Jun 21 14:32:04 2015 UTC,Yes! Go to outerbanksvape.com and you can look though the flavors and descriptions. I promise you wont be disappointed be this juice line. Its my all day everyday vape.
VapePorn,3a2r42,Zamibe,2,Mon Jun 22 20:01:13 2015 UTC,I've heard it's great juice but I never could find it online. Thanks so much!!
VapePorn,3a2r42,Zamibe,2,Mon Jun 22 21:41:00 2015 UTC,"I actually work in the shop and would love if you ordered some. If you buy over 25$ worth you get free shipping!! A 15ml will cost you around $8 and a 30ml is about $13.50. If you like fruity flavors, we have a fantastic Green apple, and I would grab a bottle of sweet satisfaction which is a bowl of mixed fruit  lightly drizzled with honey and endless summer is fantastic as well, its a grape apple kiwi that turns into fruit striped gum. If you like savory flavors we have everything  from cinnamon roll to a captain crunch that is to do for. There is one called Vincent van squash that is a vanilla butternut squash, maple pecan and a little brown sugar that is one of our  best sellers. And if you are ever in the Gastonia area in North Carolina, stop in and say hello:) we would love to see you."
VapePorn,3a2r42,Zamibe,2,Tue Jun 23 01:21:27 2015 UTC,"Very cool how you work there! I love fruity and savory/desert flavors but fruity flavors take the cake. I actually checked out the site as soon as I saw your first reply and I bookmarked a few flavors already. Sweet Satisfaction, Sweet Carolina, Captains Berried Treasure, and Landfall are all right up my alley (Vincent Van Squash sounds interesting!) but I gotta use up more of the juice I have now and make room in my budget before I place a decently sized order from you guys. If I'm ever near North Carolina I'd gladly stop in but I rarely go that far south (from Michigan)."
VapePorn,3a2r42,Zamibe,2,Tue Jun 23 03:31:45 2015 UTC,"Michigan?!?! That's so amazing that you have heard  of our juice all the way up there!! If you don't mind me asking, how did you hear of our Juice line? You also picked a lot of good different flavors, most of those are my favorite :).  We have a facebook page and once you try some juice, we would love to hear what you thought! Also, if you give us a like, you'll  always know about new flavors coming out, which is always a plus. Oh! And just for you since you seem so interested in trying out our juice, when you go to order, if you type in ""got the card"" in the code box. You will receive an extra 10% off your order.  Only people that come into the store have our business card and know about the 10% off, but since you have been so awesome, I think you should know:)"

It's a prototype so it doesn't have the adjustment buttons and the body is made of plastic, but it gets the job done!  The actual stratum group on facebook just had a list go up last week and I hear that it was up for a few minutes until the 100 units were sold. If that's true it might not be too difficult to get considering lists for other mods can fill in less than a minute."

VapePorn,39xopk,twoshotracer,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:37:59 2015 UTC,Just bought a couple Sony batteries for my new (to me) segeli. Love them. And the were fairly cheap too. No complaints
VapePorn,39xopk,dragonczeck,2,Tue Jun 16 04:58:42 2015 UTC,"They might be fake. On the bottom near the negative terminal there should be what looks like a QR code. If that ""qr"" code is half faded near the bottom they are fake it not they are real. Careful fake batteries, while are the same in all stats, sometimes cant handle lower ohms and they short themselves or blow up. Most vape shops don't build coils under .5 ohms now simply because a lot of the clone batteries they sell are actually quite deadly. Unregulated business is dangerous kids no matter what people say do your research and make sure they are rated for at most .2 ohms like efest and sonies. This only relates if you are building your own coils of course for any atomizer. Make sure you are safe friends lets not give any more reason for big companies to lobby agaisnt vape.  My mech mod is a dual coil .15 ohms and i use sonies and efest. My sigeli with a lemo 2 drop i use the sonies usually they seem to last longer than efest. Mech for home use or showing off :P. Sigeli for nic or out and about days."
VapePorn,39xopk,dragonczeck,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:41:30 2015 UTC,"The sony's might be fake, I don't use them much except when my efest's are dead, and I don't push them hard... my daily vape build is .5ohm.  The QR is faded on them, but equally faded all around, not half faded (if that makes a difference in the likelihood of being fake)"
VapePorn,39xopk,dragonczeck,2,Tue Jun 16 15:19:58 2015 UTC,Why does everyone leave the batteries exposed like that?  Why not just get a few of those 2/4 battery holders and put those in the foam?
VapePorn,39xopk,dragonczeck,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:41:57 2015 UTC,"I considered that too, and might go that route.  I do have a few of the 2 battery plastic holders, and it fits into the spot just as well."

VapePorn,39z4tl,Zeybrin,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:48:31 2015 UTC,Awesome news! Thanks for the reply.  Any wicking issues from the coils? Those juice holes look tiny.

VapePorn,39wpp8,dinklenerg,13,Mon Jun 15 12:38:44 2015 UTC,"Solid set up, my friend! Good start! Watch out though... the rabbit hole is deep. It starts with juice. You'll wanna try ALL the juice. After that, you'll want more flavor or better clouds. You'll experiment with different RTAs, and coils, move on to RDAs, twist your first Clapton. But now you need something else for dual Claptons, and get some over powered box mod... then you'll see all the new mods, RTAs, and RDAs coming out and get those. Soon, you won't wanna pay for juice anymore and get into DIY juices..... someone please help."

I tried building myself a dna40 in a 1550p box so it would look like this, but I failed miserably. This is spot on for everything I wanted in a mod. I'll probably ditch a few of my other mods to make up for this. :)"
