solar,3e45r9,zenchowdah,3,Tue Jul 21 20:36:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert, but for starters:  The federal tax credit is 30% of the installed cost, which does work out to about $10k in this case. The tax credit goes to the owner of the system, which in a PPA is Solar City, not you. Under the My Solar loan program, you are the owner and get the tax credit, but you get screwed on interest payments.  You need to look at your electric bill and figure out what you're currently paying per kWh, then compare that to the $0.12/kWh Solar City is offering. $0.12 is right around the national average. If possible, also add up how much electricity you consume in 12 months, and compare that to Solar City's quote.  With your electric bills that high in the winter, you must have electric heat. You might save more money in the long run by changing the heating system, if possible.  Solar City's business model is to provide you with electricity just slightly cheaper than the utility currently does. Purchasing a system yourself will save you a lot of money compared to SolarCity over 20 years, but it's a lot of money to pay upfront by yourself. Solar City's biggest selling points are ""no money down"" and ""slightly cheaper than your current electric bill""."
solar,3e45r9,cleansweep9,4,Tue Jul 21 21:20:46 2015 UTC,"To add to the the excellent points made above:  The $0.12/kWh is a locked in rate, but utility provider rates historically increase. So while it is ""slightly cheaper"" now, it could be significantly cheaper 5 years from now."
solar,3e45r9,mopagalopagus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:42:43 2015 UTC,"Maybe, OP doesn't specify if the $0.12/kWh is tied to an annual increase. Most SolarCity PPA contracts include a 2.9% increase year over year, adding to your bill by the end of the agreement.   The best price for your energy would be to purchase the system, but if you can't afford it the PPA is a good route to go Solar and save on electricity. Also I would get at least one more quote. SC uses cheap panels/inverters to offer such a low price."
solar,3e45r9,House66,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:15:21 2015 UTC,"Yup, contact states no more than 2.9% increase per year.  As far as the cheap equipment goes, they take care of maintenance and repair, so would that really even be a factor?"
solar,3e45r9,fengshui,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:38:41 2015 UTC,"I would be careful about that.  Although utility rates have gone up significantly recently, there's no guarantee that they will continue to do so.  With natural gas expected to be cheap due to fracking for some time, we could see a long-term price trend of 1%, or 3% or 5%.  There's just no way to know.  The lower you can get the increase, the better. if that's a negotiable item."

Read the fine print on Solar City's proposal to make sure you don't get screwed if your utility changes their net metering policy.
solar,3e45r9,pipdubya,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:17:33 2015 UTC,"You might be getting locked into a certain kW amount, but are they guaranteeing system performance? I ask this because you might get sold a big system that can 'theoretically' post huge numbers, but you've also got a big tree that might cast a long shadow later in the day, and during the winter, lord knows you won't be producing like you are in the summer. Check to see if they provide any performance guarantees, and how they 'make it right' if they oversell you on a system. I know some companies do this, so if you're leery that they were just trying to sell you the biggest system possible, get a quote from another provider like Sungevity or SunRun. I know Sungevity will give you a guaranteed system efficiency quote (ie - ""We guarantee you will produce enough solar power to take care of 98% of your utility bill""), so if they oversell you, they'll make up the cost for your system's under-performance. Make sense?"
solar,3e45r9,solarjunk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:17:08 2015 UTC,Agree here.   I'm in Ontario which isn't that much different from an insolation standpoint.   10MWh is quite a lot. My 8.96kW system does about 8MWh. Maybe you'd hit 8MWh of you get rid of the tree on the East side but you have some shade

If you have a tax liability where you can use the tax credit your better off buying. If not I would do a full prepay ppa where it is similar to as if you purchased. Do not believe they will sell you a system for a dollar after 20 years. If something had value they won't give it away for free.

First is your price per kilowatt hour in NY seems very low.  If you are only paying on average $1,000 a year in electricity for around 8800 kwh a year, you are only paying around $.11 a kwh for electricity which is very low.  Also, the system rated 8.745 and only producing around 8800 kwh tells me that the azimuth is not great or there is significant shading.  Those factors extend the ROI."
solar,3e2len,hliz70,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:25:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback.

I don't have any shading and the azimuth is excellent, however, I have heavy snow from December through February.  I live in upstate NY....way upstate, almost to Canada.

solar,3e0uzw,anekin007,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:25:02 2015 UTC,"As with every solar company I've worked for, they likely have a deal with the module manufacturer (in this case Solarworld) where they get a bulk deal for a cheap price, that or they're trying to get rid of old product, hence why they might be dancing around giving you a price breakdown. Given that, I've never worked at a place where they didn't give the customer a price breakdown, but nor were those price breakdowns ever an accurate representation of what the company actually payed for each item (sales usually manipulates the profit margin to hit a targeted $/W for the system and then cover it up in the breakdown by manipulating the costs).  TL;DR, you should be able to get a cost breakdown but I wouldn't put too much trust in it.  A more useful metric would be to just convert the end quote into a $/Watt unit (which they usually do for you) and use that to compare quotes of different companies, assuming you do your research on the quoted equipment quality to take into account as well.  EDIT: I'd like to add also that if you like a certain company or the type of system they proposed but have a cheaper $/Watt from another, this is the metric you would take to the one you like and say ""your competitor offered me X$/W, will you meet that?"" Salesmen hate this shit but almost every solar installer manipulates their $/W from job to job."
solar,3e0uzw,relemhcs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:03:46 2015 UTC,"That comes in at $3.80/Watt. Which is on the high side, depending on the difficulty of the install.   For module pricing, the difference in price really comes in volume.   I can buy 150kW worth of Solar World modules from my distributor at $0.69/W. I can also buy 5kW of them for $1.10/W. It's a volume game.   Labor is labor either way. It should take 3 guys and an electrician a full day to install, whether its 4kW or 8kW.   Modules will most likely come in for them at $0.75-$1.00   Inverters should be $0.20-$0.35/W  Electrical Commodities for another $0.10/w-$0.30/W  Installer Labor $0.20/W-$0.40/W  Permitting/Engineering $0.10-$0.15/W  So you're anywhere from $1.35 to $2.20 on their hard project costs before any markup, and you're also paying for the company overhead as well.   I know that this doesn't translate to smaller companies, but on the larger scale, some of the numbers ive seen on the cost of customer acquisition is between 3 and 6 thousand dollars per project.   It should be easy enough to find a $3.00/W installer, and save yourself 5 grand."

Honestly I'd worry more about inverters, do they mention what brand they intend to use? We use SMA, we've dabbled in a few others in the past, steer clear of micro inverters unless your situation calls for a few panels here and a few more there spread over different places. But otherwise make them do the work of string sizing, a lot of installers use micro inverters as a crutch so they don't need to do string sizing calculations or dc wire sizing, but micro inverters cost more in parts and labor, and are far and away less reliable.

solar,3dtvtw,pman555,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:28:53 2015 UTC,The PSE&G Solar Loan Program. Works by having your SRECs pay off the loan at a guaranteed price.
solar,3dtvtw,noahio,2,Sun Jul 19 12:40:40 2015 UTC,Am I missing something? The interest rate is over 11%. Doesn't sound like its a benefit.   Is there an advantage to the PSEG loan over paying cash or even getting a home equity loan?
solar,3dtvtw,noahio,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:56:17 2015 UTC,"You don't pay it  back with cash, so the interest rate isn't a big concern. You have a guaranteed SREC price for 10 years which is significantly higher than the current market price (which is not guaranteed in any way). Less risk for you, much quicker break even time."

solar,3dtvtw,hliz70,1 point,Wed Jul 22 10:35:25 2015 UTC,"Not in NJ.  Only the federal tax credit and SRECS.  The PSEG loan is expensive and they will only lend a portion.  Yes the SRECS price they agree to give you for the 10 years pays back the loan, but you still have to finance the difference and you pay more in the long run with their higher interest rate, application fees and SREC trade fees.  You are better off with a loan program though a contractor.  A common loan program is 12 years at 2.99%"
solar,3dsh4e,fencing49,6,Sun Jul 19 00:50:18 2015 UTC,"Not sure what advances you are talking about.   Solar is very mature technology and advances are very modest at best.   Further there is the federal incentive which ends at the end of next year, at 30% that is pretty significant."
solar,3dsh4e,ButchDeal,2,Sun Jul 19 02:05:17 2015 UTC,"Agree with /u/ButchDeal, any solar technology that's significantly ""advanced"" enough to make a difference to you in terms of performance is either in a lab or in space right now.  Nothing will one up you in 6 months, technology-wise.  Do it now, because that federal tax credit going away at the end of 2016 is way more of a reason not to wait.  That all depends, though, on whether you plan on purchasing your solar system yourself, or if you lease it from a solar installer.  If you lease, the company you go with keeps the tax credit and all other rebates and incentives and you pay a set rate for a 20 year period with option to extend for another 5 years after that.  CT has pretty good state programs, so if you can afford the upfront cost, owning yourself would give you the most value."
solar,3dsh4e,jditsky,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:58:30 2015 UTC,"That 30% will have been erased in at least a few years again. Those ""modest"" advances still accumulate. Plus, I'm not from the US but I believe the US is also in the very peculiar position that a large portion of the costs is unrelated to the equipment, so ""administrative"" changes alone could perhaps have a major influence on installation costs.  It's also worth noting that so far, most, if not all PV equipment cost reduction predictions have been overly conservative, and there's every chance that we haven't really learned from that mistake yet, regardless of how much ""mature"" we think the technology is.  [EDIT: Note that I'm not arguing for waiting, just remarking that the loss of tax credit won't make PV suddenly vastly less desirable.]"
solar,3dsh4e,gngl,3,Sun Jul 19 12:39:32 2015 UTC,"Do it now. The technology will improve, but it doesn't matter. If you're buying or leasing a system in CT, there are caps on how much solar you can get .... If you are able to get 100% (or close) offset now (depending on your usage, shading, roof space, and orientation), the degradation factor on most solar panels is minuscule... At the end of 20 years, your panels will still produce a ton of power. also, with the chance of the tax credits going away and the solar rebate constantly dropping (not sure if there is one in CT), you should go solar now, lock in your rate, and start saving on your bills."

solar,3dsh4e,jditsky,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:11:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for pointing that out! Looks like you're talking about the NY- Sun PV Incentive Program which is an awesome way to provide incentive to the business side for cost reduction to the consumer.  Unfortunately nothing like that in CT, although there are some other great programs.  The main state incentive in CT for residential is the Residential Solar Investment Program.  On a 5kW system installed for $20,000 (assuming rough estimate of $4/watt here), OP would be looking at $2,700 back from the state and a $6,000 credit on his taxes if he purchases on his own.  /u/itothea is right on that database, DSIRE is the absolute authority on all U.S. renewable energy incentives by state.  I'm not too in love with their new website though :/"
solar,3dsh4e,anomalous_cowherd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:01:23 2015 UTC,"I'm in the UK so the incentives side is different, you'll have to judge that for yourself.  But I've been watching solar tech for 30 years and there is always some super new technology just round the corner that will make current systems obsolete, some pay off, some don't. But they never pay off quickly enough that getting a system rather than putting it off is a good idea.  I'm just at the point where I have a house that points in a sensible direction and can raise enough cash to buy my own system. There will be a 6-7 year payback period based on the local subsidies and incentives, then 15 years or so of free money. A good investment, long term.  What I've seen is that as the new technologies feed into the system, the subsidies etc have been revised downwards such that although the systems are cheaper the combination means there is still a 6-7 year payback period.  If you don't have it, it isn't making power for you, simple as that."

solar,3drpyp,sanjugo,2,Sat Jul 18 20:34:59 2015 UTC,"Are you Japanese?  Do you live in Japan? Or do you speak Japanese fluently?  Kyocera is Japan's ""ichi bahn"" (sp?) of solar panels.  They have a manufacturing plant in Japan. You could call Kyocera and ask for any B grade or reject panels.  Or ask about used panels from them or any distributors they could get you in contact with- used Kyocera panels would be better than crap Chinese panels.  I would be wary of Chinese panels for a couple reasons- the specs might not be totally right.  Often times when I test no name Chinese B grade panels they don't put out as much power as their specs claim.  So make sure to buy 10% extra if you go Chinese.  Also, manufacturing processes and quality of materials can dictate how long a product lasts.  So when a no name, brand new company (from anywhere in the world, not just China) who are not ISO9000 certified for example, start manufacturing, you don't have the peace of mind and don't have great faith that the panel will still hold together and be outputting as it should in 5, 10, 15, and 20 years down the road.  Also, there's the warranty- again, do you have peace of mind that if the panel fails in 1 years that that no name Chinese generic knock off company is still going to be in business in 10 years to service the warranty?  Disclaimer: I used to sell a ton of Kyocera panels as I am one of only 3 companies with their license to sell them in Baja Mexico.  While they are extremely high quality panels, there are other panels that are just as quality and much cheaper.  Many of the Mexican families I sell to are cattle ranchers and fisherman who can't afford Kyocera.  I do sell Kyocera to the Mexican government when I do projects with the CFE, but prefer name brands like Sharp or LG that are cheaper but the same quality as Kyocera.  Anyways, PM me if you have any more questions, about power inverters or batteries or sizing the system- we did 38  off grid systems in Mexico last year and I designed every single one of them personally, and we had 0 failures.  Love to help out any how I can; I am super pumped that so many people are getting solar- it's not just business for me, it's my passion as well."
solar,3drpyp,PhytoRemidiation,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:57:48 2015 UTC,"I'm aware of the Kyocera brand, however their panels are too expensive for what I need (I cannot wait 20-25 years for these solar panels to pay themselves back).  Basically I want to migrate to solar very slowly starting off with powering the garage (hence the low cost option) just to see if it is something that is worth investing in on getting more panels.  I am looking at an off-grid option to start off.  As I am a complete newbie in terms of anything electric, I will have to rely on internet FAQs and manufacturer's support.  PS. I've read that Sharp is like the GE of Japan, not great quality but works just like the Chinese brands."

I ran the lighting with standard 14/2 wire and used perfectly normal light switches/etc.    I currently only have a 20W panel hooked up to it (I have a pair of 65W panels that will be installed as soon as time permits!) but that has been sufficient for my lighting needs over the last 18 months.   Now I am currently running 4 bulbs out there but we only use it for an hour or so nightly most days.    With a larger panel and more battery storage I see no reason why doing lighting for your workshop would not be trivial.  I have those 2 65W panels in my barn for the exact same purpose!    For the laptop/tools. I have seen some info on the net but do not know how useful it is.  This is the best article I have found thus far.  Good luck with your shop!      Edit:  One other thing I had a bit of difficulty with was sourcing the correct 12vdc led bulbs.  If you google them you will get many options, I chose to use ones with an e27 base (standard light socket available anywhere.) simply so I could wire the area with easily replaceable components.

solar,3dns2u,jacksheerin,2,Fri Jul 17 20:48:40 2015 UTC,Search Amazon and you will likely find a car charger for your laptop and battery powered tools. Then just hook up the battery as described in u/jacksheerin's linked article and you are good to go. No need for an inverter.
solar,3dns2u,klocks,4,Sat Jul 18 13:19:40 2015 UTC,"LED lights are easy.  Just buy 12vDC lights and hook them up directly.  I know you're trying to avoid it, but the easiest way for everything else is to just buy a cheap modified sine wave inverter.  The tool battery chargers and laptop transformer will not have any negative effects from running off a modified (square) wave inverter like a motor or compressor would.  These types of inverters are way cheaper than pure sine wave inverters.  If you really want to have your laptop and tool chargers connect directly to your DC powerbank, it is possible, but not necessarily cheaper or easier.  You can actually buy car adapters for some laptops, so search for that first.  If there isn't one for your specific laptop, you can make one using a DC to DC voltage regulator.  This will keep the output voltage consistent and clean even when your solar panels are charging your battery bank (at 13+v).  The battery chargers for your tools will be a little more complicated.  If they are NiCd, you can charge them just like a car battery (apply ~10% more than the max voltage until it is within 5% and then disconnect or float the charge).  If they are Li-Ion or LiPo cells, then you need a smart charge controller since there is a little more to it.  You could probably just bypass the transformer in the existing charger and supply whatever DC voltage it was converting to, but I've never tried this.  Hopefully someone else here can give you some other suggestions."

I think the cost without the electrical upgrade was around $3.80/watt installed.  We went with SunPower 335W panels so we could get squeeze the entire 6kW system on one plane of our roof. 6kW should cover 95%  of our current annual usage.  We're paying for the whole thing out of pocket, to avoid loan fees and interest. Even so, it looks like it will take us around 15 years to break even on the purchase.  One thing to keep in mind: the utilities aren't going to keep offering free net metering for the next 25 years.

You didn't include any details about your house, so I'm assuming it's not a 5 storey building with a super-steep roof, 50 miles from the nearest gas station, or anything similar that would make the labor expensive.  You didn't mention anything about financing. SunPower offered to finance our system at 2% interest over 12 years, but the fine print showed they would charge an extra $5000 upfront for the privilege.   It could be market demand has driven up the price in the region. It could be that you ranted about SolarCity to the GeoScape people, and they figured they had your business locked up if they smiled nicely.  SRECs aren't part of my quote. That might have something to do with it.  We don't have a production guarantee, either. Maybe that's costing you extra? I'm speaking from ignorance here, but what is the scenario where you would need the production guarantee? Damage should be covered by the warranty.  We got three quotes before deciding anything.

I have a co worker who used to work for a Sun power dealer and he had to sell above 4.30/watt.   If I understood you correctly, you said you would be paying 40,000 or so over the next 20 yrs as is for electricity. This seems like a pretty bad ROI based on the prices you stated. Inverter replacement is going to be necessary.   A flat rate PPA is generally what I would recommend. Also, an 85 percent offset is going to be fine if your local utility is set up on a tiered system or if they offer a time of use rate schedule.

If you try to file a claim they will clean and test the module separate from the rest of the system and normalize all factors so that it's equivalent to their factory testing.

AFAIK, SunPower and other Tier 1 vendors only warranty their panels when sold through and installed by an approved partner.  If you buy those panels on the open market, you're buying seconds and left-overs, and are not eligible for a warranty."
solar,3dmzmo,Ferndiddly,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:57:37 2015 UTC,"While Sunpower has been around a while, but there are plenty of other large, actual tier 1 manufacturers who will be glad to sell, and warranty, your panels. Check out Sony (US or Japan) Sharp, BP, Kyocera, Mitsubishi, LG, Kaneka, etc. A search of any reputable dealer will quickly turn up prices for these manufacturers, but they will be more expensive than the semi fly-by- night Chinese manufacturers.  If you really can't find a location, PM me and I will point you to a few examples."

solar,3dmzmo,ButchDeal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:29:18 2015 UTC,"If you're space constrained, SunPower is the only way to go.  However, I wouldn't feel like I had to replace 100% of your power.  Does your power company use tiered pricing?  If so, you can generally get the cheapest option by only replacing 80% of your power, and paying the Tier 1 rate for the remaining 20%."

solar,3dlbwz,Ditchingwork,3,Fri Jul 17 07:01:38 2015 UTC,"Right now, SEIA is working hard to get the ITC extended commercially and lose the residential aspect of it for the ""greater benefit"" of ITC extension.  Solar hasn't expanded as quickly for businesses, so it makes some sense, but I think the main draw is that it allows leasing companies to continue to rely on the ITC.  Personally, I think this is bad because its forcing a homeowner into  financing through a lease instead of having a better financial payback with owning it themselves. This is mostly just from my paranoid soapbox complaining about Big Money and securitized assets getting into solar."
solar,3dlbwz,SolarExpert,2,Fri Jul 17 19:30:44 2015 UTC,I think the gov money should go to the home owners more and less to the large scale solar companies.  Control your own power destiny!

The ITC is 30%. If prices keep going down shouldn't be too much of a problem, if it happens at all."
solar,3dlbwz,nebulousmenace,-4,Fri Jul 17 21:41:12 2015 UTC,"Remember SolarCity is unlike every other solar company out there. We're completely vertically integrated which gives us cost advantage. By the time the ITC expires, our costs will be very low and we should be able to survive. Additionally we're working to lower cost of acquisition per customer by driving referral based selling which should help as well.  Not to mention our installations are blazing fast due to the Zep system we use, so we're able to hit almost 3 installs per day per crew, no other company is that efficient with their time.   Basically when the ITC goes away you're going to see the solar industry consolidate like crazy, but we'll still be around.  But really, the ITC isn't going away. I'm almost sure of it."

They're opening up their own module manufacturing plant in... Buffalo? and will be able to control that cost of their business, and implement the newest manufacturing tools to reduce cost. This will help them keep distribution costs in house and order quantities won't matter as much to different regions because its their own supply.  With Tesla's battery packs, they'll likely position themselves to be the lowest cost dealer of Tesla batteries with further economies of scale by including solar. With the business market, the batteries are going to be a game changer that can result in A LOT of savings that SolarCity will be able to build into their leases and make less profit elsewhere by lowering costs... maybe.  With the new developments in New Energy Metering around the country (but I speak of CA's NEM2.0) solar is going to make a much better payback when integrated with solar.  Until battery costs are down though, it won't make sense. Solar City is not currently offering the daily cycle Tesla battery because its not cost effective.  Hard Numbers... 2 8  25 93.54"

solar,3dlbwz,andres7832,-3,Fri Jul 17 15:21:59 2015 UTC,"There's a reason why SolarCity acquired zep solar. It's the best mounting system in the industry, and we wanted it for ourselves. I think the stat is something like 2.4 installs per day. I rounded up too much but whatever."
solar,3dlbwz,House66,2,Fri Jul 17 20:26:17 2015 UTC,"Zep is great, sure. You still have a roof top installation, with roof penetrations, conduit runs and bends, wiring, optos/inverters, moving mods up to the roof, etc, etc.   You have 8 hours in a day. say you only lose <1 hours in traffic. Say 7.5 work hours and you have 2.5 jobs per day. Thats 3 hours per job, from installing anchoring, to rails, to inverters/optos, to wiring, to panelization.   If you can do a 3 hour job on a typical residential job (6kw) with a 3-4 man crew, I would say that is very impressive. Most likely, I would call BS, since I know what a system takes to install and although Zep is cool and faster, you cant do 3 hour jobs IMO."

Their sales process is the same thing, yes they are a cheaper route than the utility, but the way they go about it is very slimy. They don't want you to have sales experience because they have a script/format for you to follow. Once customers try and dive into real numbers, they don't have the knowledge to fall back on.

solar,3dfxyg,lick_spoons,3,Thu Jul 16 02:25:56 2015 UTC,"First, a few questions.   What is the humidity? Is there a big difference between day and night temperature? How many cubic meters of air are you trying to cool? (square feet of house space is what people here might ask) What is your target temperature?   Here is my thinking.  The least expensive solution is usually a mass market product that has the ""economy of scale"" going for it.  If you just want something you can plug in to the power grid I think it would be one of these ductless mini split systems.  You pay your money, simple install and it works for both heating and cooling relatively efficiently.  If access to water is inexpensive, there are evaporative coolers that are very inexpensive to run, but work best when the air is HOT and DRY.  If you are building NEW CONSTRUCTION or thinking LONG TERM, a geothermal heat pump system is most efficient.  Our home (Moncton, Canada) uses a combination of active and passive techniques for managing heat / cold.   Shade - we have big trees that shade our house in summer, but lose their leaves in the fall, allowing passive solar heating in fall, winter and spring.   We also close our blinds on the sunny side of the house through the day, and close windows when it is cooler inside than out.   Air Exchange - in the hot season we bring in LOTS OF COOLER AIR AT NIGHT.  We use an air exchange system but simple window fans on a timer will do. Evaporative cooling.  We simply spray water on the roof of the solarium to cool things down if it passes 40 deg C. Moving air.  We use ceiling fans to move air so it feels cooler.  This only works if the inside temp is below body temp.  We also move air from the cool basement to the main floor using the air exchange system.  It is about 12 degrees C cooler in the basement than the top floor. Insulation - we need loads of insulation because of cold (-40) winter temperatures.  This makes a big difference in helping fight the heat as well.  We have had outdoor temps of 38C, and the indoor temp of 24C Without using an electric air conditioner"

What is the humidity?   34% right now at 4:49 AM CEST We are kind of far away from the sea or a lake, so the air is rather dry.   Is there a big difference between day and night temperature?   Max: 40 ºC. Min: 20 ºC.   How many cubic meters of air are you trying to cool? (square feet of house space is what people here might ask)   i reckon the whole house is about 1 000 square feet (90 m2)   What is your target temperature?   just get the room temperature a couple of degrees lower, if possible. at 40 ºC outside, the house is about 32 to 35 ºC, if we can get that to 30 ºC, that'd be great."

solar,3dfxyg,mikethemofo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:51:35 2015 UTC,Why would it matter the source of the power?  If power created by solar is cheaper per kWh via Solar then it shouldn't matter what the source of that power is.  Sure your upfront cost will have to take that AC into account but in the end it is just another appliance using power.  Of course you should find a more power efficient method of cooling to lower that demand.  It is the same way you should replace your lights with CFL or LED lights to reduce house electricity usage so you don't have to build more solar capacity than you need.

solar,3ddldo,superintertroll,6,Wed Jul 15 13:05:49 2015 UTC,"Commercial or Residential market?    Sunpower manufacturers the most productive modules on an energy density basis (Watts/Square-Foot or Watts/Square-Meter), but you cannot get these as a DIY consumer.  Sunpower is maybe 50% more productive per exposed surface than most poly-crystalline silicon products.   But they are only available through Sunpower authorized dealer/installers.      Sanyo HIT modules are higher power density than most other lines, producing about 10% more watts/SF than - but then you should expect to pay a premium for these or any higher range units.    Both manufacturers use multi-junction layers of mono-crystalline Si.    Best is to size your system based on more salient project scale criteria, then look for modules that best fit the project.  How much space do you have (roof, yard, etc.)?  How much can you afford?  If you have more space than money, then focus on standard productivity ranges.  If you have more money than space, then focus on higher power density units.  (To figure out power density, simply divide the rated wattage of a module by its physical area.  Most poly-crystalline modules can produce about 11 watts/SF under standard conditions)."
solar,3ddldo,nrgxprt,3,Wed Jul 15 13:29:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to answer.  I'm a residential user.  I prefer the best bang for the buck, opposed to answering the question of how much I can afford to a salesman.  That's a dangerous question.  For production, I'm fairly certain the size of my due-south facing roof will be enough to support the power requirements of the home during the day, and I could always invest in that new power wall unit from that certain company with a certain factory somewhere, but removing myself from the grid isn't my goal.  I'm trying to capitalize on the market of electricity - I expect prices to remain high, even as more and more people convert to solar.  Toward the end of a solar panel's life span bought and installed today, I would expect the price of electricity to come down, but not down far enough to make the initial investment in 2015 a negative.  And I understand while a panel will lose efficiency over time, it's not like the panel will stop working entirely, like a GM car the day after the warranty runs out.  Thanks for the intel on materials used - that is a great question and separator of manufacturers."
solar,3ddldo,nrgxprt,3,Wed Jul 15 14:18:15 2015 UTC,"No problem.  And of course you don't furnish to a sales person what you can afford.  Since you indicated you're preparing to forge ahead on your own, you're best first step is to estimate the size of your system.  There are 3 basic alternatives for initially sizing a system:  Space available, budget availalbe, or load to be served.  An off-grid system requires you to use the third approach.  A grid-tied system with battery back up requires at a minimum these things additional to a simple grid-tied system:  An automatic transfer switch, an inverter that can operate both grid tied and in island mode, an often HUGE investment in batteries, and most of all, knowledge and skill at maintaining the batteries safely.  In time, battery back-up integrated with grid-tied will get simple enough to just plug it all together and forget about it, but there is no off-the-shelf system that simple and safe like that right now.    You have already received good advice from others here, but here are some other important basics for planning/evaluating a project, though.    1) INSTALLED price per watt is WAY more important to focus on at first.  Rebates and tax credits are important to know about at this point. Where I live, we have a 25% installed cost rebate available, and the 30% US income tax credit through next year.  Example:  Raw cost installed at $4/watt is then really, only about $2.20 out of pocket installed.  If you do all the work yourself, whew!, you may be able to get that down to $1.75/watt installed (Note rebate and tax credit do not apply to the value of your own labor).  But then, if you're absolutely fixed on a dual mode system (battery bank), you might be back up in the $6.50 to $10/watt installed (my state's rebate program offers nothing for <edit - battery portion of> battery backed systems.)    2) Sizing: To estimate the size of your system by space available:  Figure what is the limit of your yard or roof with good solar aspect (no or very little shade year round).  Discount that figure by 10% or 20% depending on a number of things (e.g.:  Typical in CA is to allow 4' of width along the ridge and maybe the edges of your south facing roof free and clear, but that code fine point has not reached the midwest yet.) Based on budget, take what you can afford and divide that an the approriate $figure per watt installed. Based on grid tied with batteries:  Can easily double or more the $figure per watt installed of a simple grid-tied system.  The extra gear, especially the batteries, and expertise to maintain it all, can be daunting.    3) Heed the advice you see from others here:  If you want to be legal and in code, you gotta know lots more than what it may first appear.  I suggest you first do a small off grid system, like a nightlight system for your yard, or maybe a little waterfall for a pondin the yard.  It will teach you a ton, and you get to keep it after you step up into the house scale system  Side note re. information from others:  As to what personnel certifications are needed to get a legal install done to code, I am only familiar with what is required on a statewide basis in some midwest states, Arizona, New Mexico, and California.  Basically, though, all areas of the US do not require a NABCEP certified installer, but some do and that is a good thing.  A friend of mine has been NABCEP certified for almost as long as there has been a NABCEP & told me the local officials in Mississippi and Puerto Rico, where he has done work, never even heard of NABCEP."

solar,3ddldo,ButchDeal,2,Wed Jul 15 22:45:31 2015 UTC,Bang for buck is very different from effeciency or performance ratings on the modules.   bang for buck you are probably looking at Canadian Solar CS6P-260P right now.

Look at price-per-watt for your best comparison shopping. Most grid-tie panels have similar warranties, so that is not a major selling point either. Wholesale Solar, Mr. Solar and Affordable Solar are all online sites that will get you as close to the manufacturer as the public can get (installers go straight to the distributors, but they won't sell to you unless you are buying volume). They also help with system design and will sell the balance of system items you need (racking, inverters, cables, other necessary safety equipment).   Please note that most utilities will not allow you to hook to the grid on your own. In the US, you will need a NABCEP certified installer to sign off on the install and make the final connections. Permitting and building codes will vary by location, and most of the online guys will probably not have knowledge of the finer points of code on your particular municipality. If you are going to do the system on your own, it will take some serious homework on your part, or at minimum a consult from a NABCEP installer in your area."
solar,3ddldo,Ferndiddly,3,Wed Jul 15 13:33:28 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of price per kW, opposed to per panel.  Thanks for helping me keep my eye on the prize.  I have no intention of connecting to the grid without a permit or electrician, complete with license, etc.  But I want to avoid paying the electricians rate for installing the grid and panels themselves.  Similar to running a new outlet and leaving the final connections at the panel for the electrician who can confirm adequate work was done, assuming experience leads to a quality circuit which an electrician will sign off on.  It helps minimize the cost of an electrician working in your walls...  Thanks for the info!"
solar,3ddldo,selmorefl,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:21:33 2015 UTC,"No problem. Just be aware that it is not as simple as putting the panels on the roof and wiring them up. Local codes can be pretty complicated, and your municipality may have extremely specific rules for panel setback, length of home runs, quick disconnects requirements, lighting arrestors, etc. Your are paying your electrician for their expertise and knowledge, not their labor. If you don't do your homework first, you may have to resubmit for permits multiple times, and would have saved more by simply hiring an electrician who knows the codes to design the system and pull the permits."

The company I work with has spent a lot of time making spreadsheets about this, and have found SolarWorld to be the best value where we are. Not the lowest cost or highest output, but the highest lifetime production per INSTALLED price. At the end of the day, you want to buy production, not panels, right? Most cheaper panels don't produce as much and have lower percentage guarantees and therefore take more panels - parts and labor - to match the lifetime output, and the best panels just flat out cost more."

Realistically,with current mono/poly modules, they're all the same.   Mass produced modules are still about 5-10 years behind actual levels of efficiency that are possibly today.   You can get high efficiency modules (aka sunpower), but it's really not worth the money unless you're terribly limited in available project space.

Of course part of your margin will go to them, but then expecting to out-engineer them, out-finance them and outperform a company with tons of solar expertise, experience, manufacturing capacity etc without experience yourself from scratch is a bit like saying you want to build your own smartphone without working with any existing manufacturer, I mean hell to stretch this analogy further even Apple buys most of its parts from Samsung, procures its materials from other suppliers, lets Foxconn assemble everything and lets another company ship it across the world and lets carriers do most of the sales. In short, this isn't a one man operation so I'd suggest working in the industry to get up to speed, and then either starting your own company or partnering with an existing one.   If it's really small scale, I'd suggest reaching out to the equivalent parties at that level, like the <1MW solar farms or even < 0.5 MW solar farms.

solar,3d6w2y,khrystuffer,5,Tue Jul 14 00:07:17 2015 UTC,"I'm a NABCEP-PV designer and I'm decent with AutoCAD, though definitely not an expert. The full version of AutoCAD does indeed have baked-in three things that might be of interest to you:    its tables can perform calculations like what you'd expect from Excel (though with a much narrower range of functions - but it could certainly do your ampacity checks). It has a built-in scripting language (based on LISP) that allows you to extend the program in a huge variety of ways. For example, you could create a drag and drop custom ribbon that allows you to rapidly assemble three-line diagrams from a predefined menu of elements (this house has a subpanel, this one is a line-side tap, etc etc etc) You can name and track your drawing elements (""blocks and extractions""). So if you say, draw a line that represents conduit, AutoCAD can tell you how long that line is. If you draw a hundred such lines, AutoCAD can add them up on-the-fly and tell you how much conduit to order, in a table cell that updates as you draw. If you spend enough time prepping this, your BOMs are basically generated instantly when the design is finished.   Basically, AutoCAD is heavy-hitting software. Not everyone will need it. There's no reason to switch 'just because'. Gearing up will take time and money. But if you've got the volume and the complexity, it's worth it."

I assume it could be the same for 3-line diagrams, but again, I think you'd only need this if you were doing large numbers of systems with many different potential combinations of parts.  This is the guy I talked to when I was exploring getting some custom LISP work done for my company. He seems very sharp, and very busy. In the end, it was more cost-effective for me to just hone the hell out of my template - our volume is relatively small, and we only really do a few kinds of systems.  http://www.lee-mac.com/"

I think I'm going to start looking into it sales have been sorta slow and I'm finding myself with some down time from time to time. I've spoken to other designers at larger solar companies ( Solarcity, Sungevity, etc. ) who say they have a bunch of tools for automating some of the process of putting together plans, but I think they were all custom made at the companies.  Just curious, is there an advantage to having a NABCEP certification as a PV designer? I'm based out of Southern California, I'm likely going to be switching companies next year."

But I haven't really had to look for a job in 6 or 7 years, so I'm not sure how much it would help today.  Yeah, you get the idea of the scale required before tools like that make sense.. Sungevity is doing something like 8MW/month, mostly at the residential scale. Can't even imagine what SC is doing."

Makes permit preparation basically consist of drawing a site plan, as well as some occasional minor modifications.  AutoCAD is pretty standard for architectural drawings, some electrical drawings, and some mechanical drawings. So it's good to be at least  familiar. Note that for much of the 2D work required for solar permits, you'll probably only need AutoCAD LT, which is significantly cheaper than the full version."

However, yeah, it has no battery or way to keep the charge going, if a could passes overhead.  I've had issues with that in the past with certain solar chargers.  Of course, add a battery, and then the panel goes back to being large. On the other hand, being able to add thin panels (magnets it looks like?) to increase power....You can still get a compact system with a battery, to keep things going.   But come on, kickstarter is full of things that already exist, and people want to make their own. Also gotta remember, there are a crap-ton of cheap shit chargers out there.

solar,3d3bux,zenodub,2,Mon Jul 13 04:42:50 2015 UTC,The higher your DC voltage is the less you will lose over distance so most likely the answer is solar to battery run should be the longest. Find a voltage drop calculator online that makes sense to you and go from there.   If by chance you are going to invert to AC as well; the AC run should be your longest wire as the loss will be much less.
solar,3d3bux,NoSkillHW,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:54:22 2015 UTC,the AC run should be your longest wire as the loss will be much less.    Not actually true. AC has an added resistance due to skin effect. Its likely negligible in this case.
solar,3d3bux,who_dat_who_der,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:25:29 2015 UTC,Depends on your charge controller.  We specifically bought a high voltage MPPT controller because our panels are about 100' from our house.  This approach lets us use a much smaller gauge wire (from the panels to the charge controller) than a lower voltage charge controller.
solar,3d3bux,thirstyross,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:23:01 2015 UTC,Formula used for AC is (2 x K x L x I / CMA).  A high I(amps) means a greater voltage drop. Voltage drop calculator and advanced voltage drop calculator halfway down page.
solar,3d3bux,rcrracer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:38:48 2015 UTC,"What everyone else says is true. My two cents is that if you have three lengths of wire, 1) solar panels to charge controller, 2) charge controller to batteries, 3) batteries to load, then the length #1 is going to run at the highest voltage amongst the three choices. So that's the one that should have the longest run, because if the wires sizes are equal, it'll have the least amount of voltage drop.  Here's my Voltage drop calculator"

solar,3d1egx,solarloco,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:25:40 2015 UTC,"Regarding van roofs. Just drill. Get some metal bits and drill. If you make a hole where you don't want it, plug the hole with weather-proof caulk, a metal rivet, an epoxy patch, or whatever you like. You're in a dry climate, you can make mistakes and fix them after/if it rains.  There aren't many good roof rack plans on the internet. If you don't already have this knowledge and aren't eager to experiment, there will certainly be a mechanic near you who can recommend a car body/detailer who does this sort of thing.   http://www.instructables.com/id/Mobile-Solar-Power-Station/ https://www.google.com/search?q=van+solar+panels https://www.google.com/search?q=van+solar+panels&tbm=isch http://www.traipsingabout.com/2014/04/21/solar-panels/ http://www.goalzero.com/solarlife/2014/06/25/the-van-life-travis-burke/   As for affixing panels to a rack, there again, ingenuity. You want to ward off theft and make sure they don't tear off the van in a strong wind / at high speed. You'll be using lots of angled brackets, long bolts with nuts sandwiching everything together tightly, maybe some super strong adhesive and spray foam to give you both mechanical and chemical joinery.  Also: I've never tested this, but legend has it that if you block (cover up so it can't see the sun) a small part of a silicon-based panel like yours, the nearby cells, or perhaps the entire panel, will malfunction. On houses this happens when leaves fall unevenly on the panels, or if a shadow blocks part of the system but not the rest. This doesn't happen with ""thin film"" cells. So don't use any brackets that wrap around the panel and block the edges of the PV surface."

We're building another one (SW Austin) which should be complete towards the end of this year.  I'm looking at solar on that house too.    What I'll be looking for (after going through the process once) is the following:   How long does it take to install Solar from the time I write you the down payment check?  I was disappointed in how long it took with my previous installer. Monitoring.  This should be included and not an add-on cost.  Sure, you'll make up the difference in your price, but I had to pay more than I'd have liked to just so I could make sure the system is working.  My previous installer had packages with and without it, so they didn't hide the cost at all, but considering how little the monitoring stuff actually costs (in comparison to everything else) it should just be included. Warranty / Reliability.  I really liked the 10 year full-system warranty from my installer.  I also liked that they had been in business (not solely as a solar installer) for 20 years already.  If for some reason your company is new, look into a 3rd party-backed extended warranty for peace of mind. As other posters have said: money.

solar,3cx4i1,thegauntlet,2,Sat Jul 11 15:33:31 2015 UTC,"if anything it'd be bad wiring I would think.  I know FUD articles point out ""risk of roof collapse, fires, and herpes"" as things that can happen with solar panels, but I've never actually heard of anything real other than money in my pocket."
solar,3cx4i1,RockMeetHardPlaces,2,Sat Jul 11 15:47:30 2015 UTC,"My guess would be faulty electrical installation could cause a fire, otherwise it's very unlikely. The National Electric Code is pretty strict about how wiring is done; anything that meets code would be extremely unlikely to cause a fire."
solar,3cx4i1,tyrel,2,Sat Jul 11 16:10:28 2015 UTC,"Oh boy... you know... this could be a few things, as it's definitely the array based on that picture.   Your neighbor's solar panels might be Centex, which was recalled for causing fires. Even without a specialized module, a faulty module could dump the entire string's power into the ground. Often it's a faulty junction box - a 3rd party component of the typical solar module. Such was the case for BP Solar. Even without a faulty module, an uninterrupted ground fault event could occur. This particularly applies to solar arrays with many circuits -> such as a residential thin film array. A ground fault occurs, but not one large enough to trip the fuses or inverter protection system (which has to make increasing allowances as # of circuits increase). If the problem runs unabated, laterm it will inevitably cause additional faults which turn the inverter off. The problem is that depending on where the faults are, you could force an entire system's worth of power down the face of a single source conductor from a single string. It isn't sized for that, burns up, and you're on fire. Here we go. There's bad design. It's common to perform wire sizing calcs with 90C ratings only to land onto 70C terminals. A designer might not realize a -ER weatherproof rating is necessary, and instead go with a standard cable.  Then there's normal wear and tear (squirrel/weather damage).  Then you get into how the design might impinge a firefighter's ability to fight the fire effectively. If you don't have proper clearances, they just might show up and let your house burn down.   For all these reasons, higher fire rating standards are being pushed to the industry. Module-level electronics significantly reduce fire risk, and updated to NEC essentially mandate them in most rooftop designs. Additionally, more module manufacturers - particularly solar shingles - are seeking Class A fire rating certification.  So no, solar fires are not common. However, the topic needs to be given more attention - particularly by installers who think it's no big deal."
solar,3cx4i1,VoltMate,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:19:37 2015 UTC,I snagged a picture of it. The install was done at the time the house was built in 2009/2010. It is a solar panel that is flush with the roof too. Looks pretty sweet until it burns your roof.  http://imgur.com/7oeUxWi
solar,3cx4i1,pecenak,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:06:44 2015 UTC,Depending on how long ago it was installed seems unlikely to be wiring if it is out of the blue. In the past I've seen fires caused by cloud enhancements which the inverter receives an overvoltage and can catch fire. If it was a broken cloudy (and cool) day that could be the cause.

There have been very few fires documented as caused by solar arrays, and there have been certain improvements in the applicable electric codes since some of them.  The only two I can think of off hand are the 2013 fire on the Dietz & Watson warehouse in New Jersey (and I'm still unclear whether the panels caused the fire, or just made it hard to fight, but someone here should know) and the more recent fire at the Apple data center in Mesa, Arizona."

Those guys make nests under the panels and the babies teeth on the either the panel wires or home runs and if they get too close to the racking or panel frame.. they will ARC all day, every day..   only real indicator, besides looking under every week is production..  and tracking it to see if a string is down or under producing...  we install a squirrel guard on every job we install on Resi..  pretty much a wire mesh..  Spiffy Solar sells a good one.."
solar,3cx4i1,VoltMate,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:15:29 2015 UTC,"I thought DW was having roof maintenance performed at the time of the fire, which would as easily suggest oily rags as solar. However, Apple's recent fire certainly seems like a ground fault error.  The real issue with DW was that the concrete ballast blocks crashing through the roof made it impossible for the fire department to enter the building. Commercial racking systems in low seismic areas can significantly reduce fire risk (while also reducing structural concerns) by eliminating these blocks and penetrating directly into the roof.   Of course, these elevated systems double racking cost and increase the engineering. In other words, safety is being ignored at the pursuit of cost-effectiveness."

The number of modules is not important so much as the size of the total array.  12V battery is just not going to work for something this size.   Just about anything beyond an RV should use a 48V battery bank. You need to find out and plan for what loads need to be covered on battery.   What is the required load to be able to run, what is the peak draw, and peak start power requirements.   Once you have that you can then pick an inverter/charger and battery bank size.   Solar and charge controller size will fall out from that."
solar,3ctmqq,ButchDeal,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:15:49 2015 UTC,"Ok that definitely makes more sense, if i use 48V that would give me a storage requirement of 215Ah --> 55A design current which give me 7 Modules!  the loads are typical household loads in a hot environment, given the airconditioner i guess the peak load would be quite high, maybe 3KW or so. How would that affect my design? would you advise for days of autonomy? the grid power schedule is fixed and always available at the schedule in the pic i shared in the original post."
solar,3ctmqq,ButchDeal,2,Fri Jul 10 18:36:25 2015 UTC,"You are not going to run AC on a 215ah battery bank nor with a 2kw array.  Don't worry about how many modules. You are going to need a lot more power to run the AC, if no AC, you might be on track but I would  oversize the batteries so that they can be cycled just once a day. If all that is required is 120V then you could get by with an OutBack Flexpower 1 and likely 400ah bank with 3-4kw solar."

It's pretty straightforward. Buying has huge upfront costs, but in the long run you will come out on top. Leasing has no our little upfront costs but the majority of savings over the life of the system go to the leaser, that's how they can afford to do this. It's more of a moderate decrease in bill and satisfaction of going solar. I guess it depends on how long you're staying in your house, how much value you yourself puts on going solar, and what kind of financing you could get if you buy.  Good luck to ya!"
solar,3cpsdi,duncandonuts99,2,Fri Jul 10 11:51:33 2015 UTC,"It depends on the terms of the lease. Leasing is probably a better bet if you own a normal home with a normal roof and if the lease does not create onerous penalties for selling your house or other confounding factors (weather damage, insurance, vandalism, probably other things I can't think of).   The cost of panels will continue to go down, but at this point they are not the limiting cost factor in setting up your own off-grid system -- the batteries, inverter, charge control, and system maintenance are the problem with a system you buy and operate on your own. If you have the option to grid-tie lease on good terms, financed through your electric bill, paying as much or somewhat less than you otherwise would, that makes the most sense in my eyes.

Leasing them locks you in at a discounted rate for your electricity that is produce from the solar panels, if you use more than what they produce them you pay your regular rate to the Dept. of Water & Power. Leasing also makes the solar company 100% responsible for the maintenance and upkeep/repair of the panels. SunRun guarantees the panels will produce at least 80% of what they state, if the panels under produce they will credit you the difference since it wasn't your fault.   I got 19 panels (4.9 Kw/H) in Oregon"
solar,3cpsdi,Zero_Skellington,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:16:57 2015 UTC,"Depends on:   What is your current average electric bill every month?  More than $250/month is better for purchase. Can you come up with the cash to purchase?  If yes, purchase is better. How long do you plan on living in your house?  More than 10 years is better for purchase. Does your lifestyle allow using much of your electricity in off-peak hours during the summer (early morning and late at night).  Yes is better for purchase. What do you think utility electricity rates will do in the future? Lease will have annual increase baked in that could exceed the actual rate utility rates increase. How will AB327 be implemented?  Big unknown right now.   Personally, I think leasing is a bad idea because there are more unknowns than purchase.  Also, when looking at cost, don't forget that purchase builds equity in your home. You might only get 30%-50% of purchase price back when you sell you home, but leasing does not add anything to the value of your house. In fact, leasing could be a liability when you sell your house."

I thought about buying, but then started thinking about what happens in 20 years. the panels will not be producing near enough power to cover your use, since the quality deteriorates year over year, also you would be responsible for removing them. so in my mind, you have a piece of junk on your roof.  with leasing, they will remove them and heck then you probably need 1 panel.

They and GoalZero has other sizes as well, some with battery chargers.   Mind you, I believe that you need some sort of battery pack!!!   Some phones don't like the variation of input power, and can shutdown charging even on a sunny day, if a cloud passes the sun.   Battery packs will soak up all the power without throwing a hissy fit, and then you can carry the pack around and charge your phone when you are roaming around.   Battery packs can range in sizes from a pack of gum, to a thick tablet.  All have their own pros and cons (small, portable, but might not charge a dead megaphone, OR large and cumbersome, but can charge your phone AND tablet all weekend long)...  So, it depends on what you think you need.   I'd start with a 10-15w panel, and a 10,000mAh pack.

solar,3cf6e1,Vew,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:35:21 2015 UTC,"You are right about digital electronics being mostly DC power, but not necessarily with appliances. The reason is because a lot of them can and are designed to be run directly off AC - heating elements, compressors, motors, etc. Only the digital electronics need DC.  I think you're going about this wrong. Having all DC in your house wouldn't necessarily be a great thing. The size wiring would have to increase significantly, more with longer runs. The only reason people would want DC is for running off battery or solar, which usually means efficiency is the most important factor. I think Sundanzer makes a super insulated ice chest that's heavily insulated for these reasons. Not only that, you're running into territory that people haven't standardized connectors and outputs. It would be a lot more dangerous and large companies would not release a product where their users could hurt themselves from incorrect installation. With 120/240VAC it's plug and play. Having two versions of the same product would not be cost effective for them. It's easier taking the 7-10% loss off efficiency running a PWM inverter."

solar,3cdv8a,gngl,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:00:12 2015 UTC,"Short answers- they generally do not absorb much infrared light because the most efficient solar cells stop absorbing close to the edge of visible light (red light). From highest to lowest energy, it goes gamma rays, x-rays, ultra violet, violet blue green yellow orange red, near infrared, far infrared, microwave, radio. So basically its the reverse of Roy.g.biv.  Long answer- Solar cells only absorb light above the material's "" band gap.""  This is basically the amount of energy that is required to free up an electron. So, a smaller band gap means lower energy light is needed to free up an electron.  One might think that it would be best to have the lowest band gap possible, to produce the most electrons possible. However, the band gap also determines the energy of the electron given off. Basically, all the extra energy contained by light with more energy than the band gap becomes heat and is wasted. So that means that a low band gap produces more electrons and a high band gap produces electrons with a higher energy. Scientists have shown there is an optimal band gap that's a little below red in the near infrared. Silicon solar cells are slightly lower band gap than this optimum and thus absorb a little near infrared light but leave a majority untouched.  Also, generally the closer light is to the band gap, the more material is needed to absorb the light. This means the blue might be absorbed almost completely in the first 1% but the red might not be almost completely absorbed until you are 99% of the way in, and the infrared might never actually be almost completely absorbed because the cell would need to be made much thicker than the extra electrons are worth."
solar,3cdv8a,agkuba,0,Tue Jul 7 19:28:50 2015 UTC,"Higher frequencies have higher energies. Infared has less energy than visible light and ultraviolet has more.   Edit: More:  Because nothing can go faster than the speed of light dumping energy into a low energy radio wave can't make it go faster. Instead of going faster it moves up the power band. Radio becomes microwave, then infrared, then visible, etc all the way up to Gamma rays."

solar,3c9wkt,thegauntlet,3,Mon Jul 6 06:18:02 2015 UTC,"Congrats on the new install!  Solar equipment generally loses efficiency as the heat increases, so you should produce MORE power on the 70F day as the 100F day.  I'm in the PNW and even though we are in the middle of a giant heat wave my system is not producing as much as it does when we are in the 70's.  A recent study I read said that cleaning panels usually is not worth the cost in time to do so.  You usually only capture 1% extra output from cleaning your panels unless you are in a VERY dusty area.  My approach has been -- if I'm up on the roof for another reason maybe I'll clean off the panels.   Then again I'm in the PNW so we get heavy rain in the fall/winter that does a decent job of clearing things off."

The average amount of electricity consumed in the US is about 30 kWh per day and 15 kWh in Europe, so your system is generating enough peak power to power 2 average European homes.  Solar cells lose efficiency as they get hotter, so you will generate more energy in winter than in summer assuming the sun is out an equal amount of time.  You generally don't have to do anything in terms of maintenance unless something breaks. If your modules are easily accessible you can clean them every month or so but if they aren't just clean them if you notice a drop in energy generated each day."

solar,3bz2pk,catsfive,3,Fri Jul 3 17:53:22 2015 UTC,"Sadly not. Mostly it's just because of the chemistry though, same as with the bigger variants.   You have to charge lipos and LiIons (almost the same thing) pretty carefully with a specialised charger. Even with that, if the individual cells get out of balance certain cells can get overcharged or worse reverse charged and will go bang with fierce flames that burn underwater.   In large packs with fast chargers such as my radio control plane power packs a separate wire is brought out from the junction of each cell to a 'balance connector'. The charger takes this connector as well as the high power input connector and monitors the individual cells and can stop the charge if this happens. It can also do a  'balance charge' where it slowly charges all the cells using the thin balance wires to get them back to exactly matching.  Lipos are good in some ways but it comes at the cost of complexity compared to lead acid cells."

If you want to use it to optimize your time of use billing that'd be great, though.   In particular, storing them at a high state of charge or low state of charge for a long period of time (weeks) results in faster degradation (loss of capacity) due to migration of the chemicals inside. Ideally you'd want to discharge and recharge between 30% and 80% every day or so.   They also don't like heat. At all. You'd want to ensure they never exceed about 40 C (100 F) or you'll get rapid degradation. The same goes for temperatures very low (close to -40 would be very bad)."

We use a orion BMS to balance the cells and control relays for charge and discharge so it can shutoff the lines if anything goes wrong.

I can connect you with my colleague who manages the 3rd party ownership program in SE, including GA. That means our firm pays for system and development/install/insurance etc. - building owner receives 'roof rental' fee.  I will note that - especially at the low power purchase prices being offered by GA Power - just roof rental is not very lucrative, but is non-zero.  Hosting/owning your own system requires capital/loan - i.e. $1.5mm per MW (10,000sqft would yield between 750kw-1mw) - and sufficient tax liability to monetize federal tax benefits (30% or $300k for 1mw) and federal depreciation values (~36% or $325k over 5 years).

solar,3bw7bk,MiiQ,3,Thu Jul 2 17:34:04 2015 UTC,"For lights - particularly small LED lights - you can get away with a really small system.  Even watching movies on an small LCD - you'd still be able to get away with a smaller system.  But, as you say, adding the refrigerator complicates it quite a bit.  I have no idea how much electricity a small refrigerator uses.  But this page: http://www.sunfrost.com/blog/off-grid-refrigeration-solar-electric-vs-propane/  which is trying to sell an off-grid electric refrigerator, says that you can get this: http://www.sunfrost.com/R10_efficient_ac_dc_refrigerator.html  and run it off something like this: http://www.mrsolar.com/170w-small-remote-power-system-kit/  and make enough power in 4 hours to run the refrigerator for the whole day.  Alternatively, despite what the first webpage says, you could get a propane refrigerator.  In general, as the webpage above mentions, a propane refrigerator will cost less initially but probably cost substantially more over the long-term if you use it a lot.  But it depends on if you will be turning the refrigerator off and leaving it off for a long-time (while you are away from the cabin) and if so, then it won't actually get used all that much and the cost-benefit between the electricity vs. propane looks a little bitter.  If you went propane for the refrigerator then set up a very small PV system like this: http://www.mrsolar.com/85w-small-remote-power-system-kit/  To run the light and LCD TV.  You could do a couple of reasonably sized LED light (or CFL) and still have plenty of power left over (to avoid excessively cycling the battery for long-life)."

solar,3bw7bk,onomaxristi,2,Thu Jul 2 18:08:43 2015 UTC,"In a nutshell: ~2 kW of panels for all year round or 1kW for summer use only, any type will do, 2 x 200Ah to 250Ah batteries of any deep cycle type, a Steca PI 1100/24 inverter and any Chinese MPPT 24V charger you can find (I recommend EP solar). ~4000€. Expect to get 7-9 years out of the batteries. During the summer you will have tons of energy for laptops phones etc. Please find an electrician to do the installation, it can make a real difference, you wouldn't believe the shit I've seen. Also a typical small-medium fridge draws around 0.9kWh of energy per day."
solar,3bw7bk,onomaxristi,2,Thu Jul 2 22:47:51 2015 UTC,I was thinking of getting 4x 100Ah as they already have 2 of them. Is there a possibility to hook them up in a way that 2 of them are connected to the grid inside house (1 dedicated to fridge and 1 for all other things) and the other two are being charged by the panels and you could just flick some switch to change the one used for grid and the being charged. And if there is some part that could do that automatically by measuring the remaining Ah in the battery?
solar,3bw7bk,gngl,2,Thu Jul 2 23:07:48 2015 UTC,"There are chargers that can manage 2 different battery banks, but I have never installed one, sorry. Steca makes one as well as Phocos, but dont expect them to be in the same price range as with the simple ones. The inverter can be connected to all 4 at once (2 parallel 2 series). The planing you have in mind is wrong. First of all you need 2 batteries to get 24V which you need (instead of 12V) in order to keep the amps down and the cable cross sections small. Secondly a battery must only be discharged at half charge if you want it to last more than 2 months, so 100Ah12V0.5= 60Wh and we said we need 90 for the fridge. EDIT: you cant mix different age batteries even if they are identical, the new ones will ""try"" to charge the older ones. Max difference is aprox. six months"

There are small highly efficient DC refrigerators that can easily run off of a single solar cell.   Full time off grid living requires a generator and car batteries are in no way going to work. You could likely get away with a DC fridge, LED lights and some electronics on a 12 or better 24V system and 1 to 2kw of solar modules, any larger and move to 48V battery.   With a generator you can keep the solar smaller as you can always top off the batteries on cloudy days."

solar,3bstg4,gb2leddit,5,Thu Jul 2 05:17:10 2015 UTC,"Amorphous silicon was roll to roll fast and should have been cheap. By the time it was coated with a long life plastic it got almost as expensive as crystalline silicon and now silicon mounted modules might be cheaper. Roll on solar roofing was expected to speed installation, eliminate mounting systems but membrane roofing isn't as simple as it might seem. The amorphous modules I tried have had problems with the coating after a few years, while the tempered plate glass on my 35 year old crystalline modules and anodized aluminum  might out last the steel angle iron supports. New mounting systems can be assembled rather quickly and micro inverters solve a lot of wiring and provide on-line trouble shooting.  However work on improving silicon materials and processes along with other cell chemistries and designs should of course be continued as well as more development and installation of solar thermal systems. Solar thermal has been Americas forgotten solar power that can displace vast amounts of fossil fuels used for water heating, space heating, industrial processes. Higher temperature solar thermal may provide cost effective firm electricity especially if the heat can be utilized, solar thermal powered cooling with absorbtion chillers is a natural match in hot climates. Solar thermal distillation shows great promise for desalination of brackish or sea water in desert areas.  Just as existing technologies like current Li Batteries should not reduce development of superior technologies the claim that far better products will be available in a few years should not block investment now in that which works fairly good."

An order of magnitude improvement is insane on that kind of time scale. Perovskites MIGHT offer an incremental improvement in cost and performance in a decade or two, or they might end up being a high potential technology that missed its opportunity to matter since conventional solar surpassed it on its own."
solar,3bstg4,gluten_free_asbestos,0,Wed Jul 1 23:20:08 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, that $0.50/watt isn't an installed price, it's a price for modules. According to http://www.gosolarcalifornia.ca.gov/, the average cost of solar installations in 2015 was $4.72 for projects >10 kw.   One of the big benefits to perovskite solar panels (and thin film solar in general) is the possibility to greatly reduce that installed cost, by reducing the cost of mounting hardware."

solar,3bstg4,AmpEater,2,Thu Jul 2 03:37:32 2015 UTC,A partial answer to that can be seen with thin film in general. After a certain point in cost instead of buying asphalt roof shingles for your house you just buy solar shingles and the mounting/install cost for attaching them to the roof is $0 higher than regular shingles.   They would still be more complex/expensive than regular shingles and you still need an inverter for it but the system but total cost is now much much lower than regular panels. It would hit a point where it doesn't make sense not to use them for new construction.   At some cost point even solar siding in place of vinyl siding could potentially make sense. They could potentially be useful to supplement power in the late evening when the sun is at a low angle.
solar,3bstg4,BICEP2,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:56:08 2015 UTC,"This would work better if you weren't talking about installing a high voltage electrical system. You're ignoring two details that drive the cost up considerably. First, you need to evacuate the power, so some sort of series wiring is required. Second, building codes for installing high voltage equipment require that certain electrical isolation, grounding and safety standards need to be met. Also, with shingles, you can hammer nails right through them wherever you  need to, with a PV shingle, one misplaced nail and at best you have a dead panel, but more likely you have a dead string of panels and a fire hazard."
solar,3bstg4,gluten_free_asbestos,2,Sat Jul 4 13:51:08 2015 UTC,"Dow powerhouse sells something like this today. I'm not sure how much they cost but it's definitely possible.    Also, with shingles, you can hammer nails right through them wherever you need to, with a PV shingle, one misplaced nail and at best you have a dead panel, but more likely you have a dead string of panels and a fire hazard.   Have you ever seen a shingle? Only half the shingle is exposed to the sunlight so you have a 50% area to work with to land your nails on. You can attach them with a nailgun in a couple seconds and you would have to be a special kind of moron to miss by enough to put the nail through the panel.   I'm sure once a row is installed you could connect it up to a meter and probably see that one of the shingles is grounded out from a nail."
solar,3bstg4,BICEP2,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:08:51 2015 UTC,"It's not about being grounded out, it's about a defect in the PV substrate causing a short circuit, causing the entire unit to fail. You can build in ways to prevent this, but these add significantly more cost, and the DOW solar shingles do exactly this. As far as I know, the cheapest solar shingles on the market cost approximately triple the cost of a normal solar panel, and are considerably less efficient."
solar,3bstg4,gluten_free_asbestos,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:28:30 2015 UTC,"You were right to call BS on the mounting hardware costs. I pulled some stats from an article dated early 2014, which broke down the costs of a solar installation as:   Hardware: $1.76 per watt (44% of total cost) Install Labor and Electrician: $0.68 per watt (17% of total cost) Permits: $0.08 per watt (2% of total cost) Marketing/Outreach: $0.82 per watt (20% of total cost) Overhead/Profit: $0.66 per watt (17% of total cost) Total cost of system: $4 per watt ($16,000 for typical home) (http://www.solar-states.com/breaking-down-the-cost-of-solar/)   Now, granted, I was way too fast attributing the difference between the 60-70 cent / watt solar modules and the $1.76 listed there as hardware entirely to the mounting hardware, but another article from around the same time period cited racking and mounting as one of the single largest cost categories for benchmarked rooftop residential installations in the U.S.  So, at $0.12/Watt, it's a small but not insignificant direct cost, but there's potential for the lighter weight to allow simpler installation, leading to reductions in the labor required to install the panels, and possibly smoothing out the permitting process."

solar,3bstg4,tau-lepton,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:25:17 2015 UTC,"Even if perovskite panels magically were weightless, that wouldn't lead to cheaper mounting hardware or installations. Mounting hardware is not designed to resist panel wight, it's designed to resist wind force, which for conventional PV can be up to 16 times higher than the panel weight. You start deploying cheap rickety frames with perovskites and they'll rip free in the first wind storm.   Sorry. Perovskites are a worthwhile technology, but they're not likely to be a game changer. A small chance of offering a small, incremental improvement a decade or two from now is it."
solar,3bstg4,gluten_free_asbestos,2,Thu Jul 2 11:24:09 2015 UTC,"Now, it sounds like you know more about this than I do, but if solar panels were weightless, (and thin like perovskite films are), is there any reason you couldn't safely mount them on roofs with little more than a plastic sheet and some roofing nails? Maybe some glue?  Wouldn't there be a benefit from being able to take up the entire installation's worth of panels at once, since they're so light?   If the panels did get blown off, wouldn't there be significantly less risk of breaking whatever the panels fall on than there would be for heavy silicon panels?  What do you think the major contributors to falling solar panel prices will be, or do you think the price is going to bottom out around where it is now?"
solar,3bstg4,Vengoropatubus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:35:36 2015 UTC,"There are many important differences between solar shingles and regular shingles. The fact that solar shingle generates electricity means that for safety as well as building codes, they need to be properly electrically isolated. This electrical isolation is either built into the shingle or the mounting structure, but it adds a considerable cost if you build it into the shingle itself. You also can't simply mount them like a normal shingle, because one misplaced nail through the PV material and you at best have a dead string of shingles, and at worst, you have a fire hazard as well. It's also non-trivial to make them robust enough to have people crawling around on top of them. They also need to be wired up of course, which is tedious and expensive when you have lots of little shingle sized panels (not to mention your cost of electrical connectors just skyrocketed). Finally, now you have a situation where if your roof leaks, you need a roofer and an electrician.   Perovskites might eventually lead to marginal improvements in PV, but I've always thought solar shingles were a terrible idea, and in practice, the solar shingles on the market now are much more expensive themselves, and more expensive to install. These cost additions won't change just because you're using a different thin film."
solar,3bstg4,gluten_free_asbestos,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:47:28 2015 UTC,"Forgot to answer the second part of your question about costs and cost reduction potential. There I'm in less firm footing as there are many people smarter than me who disagree. Most of the cost declines from around 2008 to 2012 were based on supply chain improvements (mostly clearing out supply bottlenecks in ingot and wafer production), manufacturing process improvements (thinner wafers, more automation overall, better quality control etc), and the biggest fact - better economies of scale and more competition driving margins down. Currently, the raw material inputs plus energy requirements account for something like 75-80% of the current market price of a panel, which is absolutely insane. By contrast, the raw materials and energy inputs for a new car account for something like 5-10% of the sticker price of a car. So after paying for raw materials and energy, solar manufacturers need to cover OPEX, depreciation on assets, labor, overhead, shipping and profit. The efficiency of some solar companies is insane when you really think about it.   All of that said, without significant new technologies, there are some opportunities for price reduction. In theory, wafers could get slightly thinner, and wafer dicing could get slightly cheaper. Reductions in the amount of silver, lower costs for glass and other process tweaks and improvements might still yield marginally better results, and as efficiency slowly creeps up to an industry average of 18-20%, prices across the board get better. But without new technologies, either in PV materials, or in processes, prices can only get slightly better. The biggest cost reductions on the horizon are in installation costs as well as cost of capital. People underestimate how big a contributing factor financing is to overall costs    In terms of next gen technologies, perovskites are exciting and have potential, but it's WAY too soon to know how much potential. There are literally thousands of complexities and unforeseen barriers between the lab bench experiments that are happening now in perovskites, and a mature technology that can be wrapped up in an actual product (with 20 year warranties that financial institutions will trust). I've been through the mill on solar product development, and it's like anything else, 95% of experiments fail and 95% of ideas are bad ones. (Luckily there are hundreds of people working on different concepts, so I'm confident something will squeeze through to market in a decade or two.)  Personally, I think there are some high potential CPV technologies for utility scale on the short term horizon, and honestly, think that the steady incremental improvements in conventional PV will continue to improve the overall market outlook in the meantime."

I believe that mono/polycrystalline cells with long life and little need for replacement/servicing will reign supreme. Shirking on any part of the system is undesirable. Slightly increasing the efficiency in a reasonable, cheaply achievable way and prolonging the lifetime of the cells/limiting the degradation seems like the most sensible future way of lowering total cost per kWh. Achieving only a fraction of the lifetime could cost you extra money even if the less-durable cells came for free. 40-60 year lifetime for a well-made Si panel sounds achievable, and would reduce the portion of the cost for cells in the total $/kWh perspective significantly without forcing you to pay for extra servicing labor instead."

However, a kWh is a kWh, regardless of what produced it. It will get credited at the same rate in the meter, it will count as a kWh regardless if its produced by a $4,000 space station module or a cheap B class module, a kWh is a kWh regardless.   We like to point our customers to EPBB calculator since we are in CA as it is a third party tool to get rid of the BS ""sales pitch"" stuff.

Modern cells probably perform better; SunPower estimates its newest generations are at significantly less than -0.25%/year, and it is probable that the industry average has also improved.  For an independent test (non-quantitative) of simulated rather than field-tested reliability, you can look at Fraunhofer's PV Durability Initiative report, in which SunPower was the only company to get the highest possible mark on every accelerated life cycle tes."

As a company we have made strategic partnerships over that time with only 3 manufacturers, and the company also worked with Solarworld and Sanyo before.  From the monitored systems, most of them with SMA inverters and monitoring (meaning the readings can be a little skewed to the lower end due to damaged panels/diode issues) the production does not drop anywhere close to the 1.25-1.5%.  The big drop we see is between year one and three with about a 2% overall drop in production but then much more linear after. There's a lot of variables in real life like customers keeping systems clean on a regular schedule, etc that dont allow for exact scientific tracking, but your claims are way off, at least from what I've seen in our company and also on my personal system.

solar,3br605,sweintraub,6,Wed Jul 1 16:26:32 2015 UTC,"This. If you have limited space, sunpower will help you make the most of it. If you have enough room on your roof or ground array to reach your production goal with other tier 1 panel manufacturers, that will be cheaper than sunpower every time.  To give a specific example, I would have gotten 15% more production at installation with sunpower for 30% more cost. Sunpower claims less deterioration in performance over time, which might have lifted lifetime performance, but that is all projection. For me, another provider made more sense."
solar,3br605,fengshui,3,Wed Jul 1 16:40:45 2015 UTC,"They are no where near 75% more efficient, they do cost about that much more though.   But what is much more important is that solar efficiency is pretty much the ratio of area to output.   So the difference of 15-18% for most to 20% for sunpower really amounts to a small bit of space on the roof.   Solar PV systems are sold by the Watt, and they produce over time watt/ hours or kwh.  Basically any system of the same installed size in watts that fits on your roof will produce over time about the same kwh.   So what you want to look for is a decent $/watt price.   No Sunpower will push that their modules last longer and degrade slower.   They make the claim that in 30 years their modules will have degraded less than others.  This may or may not be true but their literature and sales pitch is comparing them to pretty much the worst competition from 5 years ago. I highly recommend getting 2 to 3 quotes."
solar,3br605,ButchDeal,2,Thu Jul 2 12:38:30 2015 UTC,I just signed up with them. It might be 75% more productive over its lifetime based on the system size and equivalent kWh. Compared to other solar panels.
solar,3br605,E2daG,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:30:47 2015 UTC,"I still dont understand how that makes sense. The PV manufacturing is a mature industry and SP is not utilizing much different technology. 75% is a ridiculous amount of extra production and I would easily call BS on that claim. I would understand 5-10% due to higher quality control/cell segregation/etc, but 75% is a stupid claim."
solar,3br605,andres7832,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:37:57 2015 UTC,"I work with them on a daily basis. Their modules are the most efficient on the market, but you pay through the nose for that gain in efficiency. Their per kilowatt price is much higher than the competition. you'd be better off getting a few quotes from different installers and comparing their $/kW pricing. SunPower is often over $5.50/kW while smaller installers can be down in the $3.25/kW range. with that price difference, you're getting the same 10 year warranty on your inverter and 20 year warranty on your modules (in California that is). so, it's tough to justify the higher price. that being said, if your leasing your system, SunPower is a great option."

There are infinite choices of equiptment and installers to choose from and your experience will vary with those options.  You could get a really low quality, cheap panel installed by a certified installer and have no problems for years. Or you could have problems from day 1.  My point is: going with a panel like sunpower will lower your probability of any issues arising down the road, and will produce the most power per sqfoot of panel space. BUT some people will tell you it is not worth it. and it is truly impossible to guage if that is true.  it is a value argument.   Where is the value to you?"

When there is a warranty issue and the company has gone out of business, Sunpower systems in full are covered and they will find you a dealer to take over the warranty.

A solar lease is for 20 years. During that time, the solar company is responsible for repairs related to the array. Any leaks are easily repaired.    Tile shingles? Those things last forever. You don't need to worry about a tile roof. The modules are stronger than your roof. In a perfect world, roofs would be made out of solar modules. Then there wouldn't be any worry about penetrations."

Whenever I look at the cost of solar, I get some salesman telling me how much it will cost to have the whole system.

solar,3bmsj1,movalca,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:22:22 2015 UTC,Unfortunately it just is not like that anymore.   They should give you a breakdown of materials and labor and stuff but not until after they have given you a full shade and site analysis along with electrical bill and usage analysis.   Most installers can also give you a price/watt but not right away because then people JUST shop on price.   Which doesn't sound all that bad but then it just turns into a price war which imo is not the best really for the industry
solar,3bmsj1,pacollegENT,2,Tue Jun 30 15:02:43 2015 UTC,Of course people shop on price. Why shouldn't they be able to shop by price. Isn't competition good?

It is not like you are going car shopping and there are a few manufacturers and everyone dealer is selling the same truck that has a certain cost.   There is a lot about each site that makes it unique and that can affect cost.   There are also a ton of different components to a system that change and are made by different manufacturers.   Just getting the sticker price of the $/watt does not give you all of the picture.   The number one question I get is : how much will it be. And then if I start to explain why there is a big range of potential costs everyone acts like it is some kind of sham and that there has to be a price!   All I am trying to say is that yes, this is somewhat true, but in reality in order to get a full answer you need to know a LOT more about what is going up there and how in order to make an informed decision.   And the truth is most people do not have time or fucks to give to do that. So they choose on price.   So a quality installer will lose deals to someone putting up shit, all because of price.   Does it matter right now? Probably not.   Will it matter in about 5-10 years? I think so"
solar,3bmsj1,pacollegENT,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:21:09 2015 UTC,"Equipment costs, price to install, price per watt, etc vary from company to company due to how they run their business.  For example: Company A may be able to get their panels for much cheaper due to the volume they buy versus Company B. But Company B is more vertically integrated with things like inverters and install so they drive their price per watt down that way.  Price per watt balanced against quality of installation should be at the top of anyone's list when shopping around. If the sales person can't tell you the price per watt and prove their work is top notch, they're wasting your time."

solar,3bmsj1,caymanj13,0,Thu Jul 9 19:18:27 2015 UTC,I got a bid for a 7kW system in Indiana from a contractor. Started looking online and realized the parts were less than half. Bought everything and did a 14kW system for just under half their quote. Shop around. Shop around. Shop around. Worst case you go to an online site - but everything - hire a roofing company to install the hardware - and then an electrician to do the final hookup. Was it a PIA? Yup - but I saved 1/2 of what they wanted to charge me and I did all the research and know my system inside and out. Good luck! Also - the paperwork / permits / and working with the electric company was super easy (EASY).
solar,3bltc7,meandrunkR2D2,3,Tue Jun 30 06:55:30 2015 UTC,I have it from my power company ($49 a month) on my 14kW system. Sucks - but I knew it going in and I am OK with it. It pays for the meter - the meter man (yes he comes to read the new digital meter on solar installs). It also pays for the transformer and the trenching and cabling (I live 1/2 a mile off the main road). I ran the numbers and the Tesla batteries really don't provide any benefit to me even with the $48 bill. Without the solar install my bills would be 350-550 a month (all electric geothermal). So I look at it as a lease payment on a really nice generator. I think I should get props for spending the money and setting the example - but I know I can't beat the system. $600 a year is much better than near $600 a month and the return on my investment was better than the stock market where the money was sitting..

They are a scumbag company and full of incompetent management. (I know, I worked for them briefly and couldn't escape quick enough).  I was planning on putting solar on my roof next year, but if this goes through I'll likely have to hold off for the time being until battery backups are viable and affordable in residential.  The Koch brothers don't have a direct influence in this decision as they don't and won't benefit from it directly.

I perform research in alternative energies and the largest problem is that not everyone can afford them (as well as energy storage as you mentioned). If we want to strive to become 100% alternative energy,  then we need to work together to power everyone. Hence the grid. Now don't get me wrong,  I'm not a huge supporter,  but they are simply trying to even out the rates for everyone by decreasing the cost per kWh and increasing ""maintenance of the grid"" fees.

solar,3blko0,in_theory,2,Tue Jun 30 14:09:01 2015 UTC,"The main changes between vehicles and buildings are that:   exposition is usually not optimal, and is typically wrong for winter (horizontal roof mounting); putting your panel under the sun means it's going to be as hot as in a stove inside the vehicle. That's often impractical.   As a result, and depending on how you plan to use the van, it can make sense to make the panel standalone and easily detachable from the roof, with enough lead to be parked in the shade and have the panel under the sun in summer; You also need to plan for less-than-ideal exposures. Globally it's fairly easy to get everything towork in summer; if you want to go solar on winter, you'll have to massively overdimension your installation.  You're talking about 20W × 8h = .16kWh. That would be provided with a 60W panel on a yearly average (using southern French exposure figures, but that's ballpark estimations). For horiaontal panels, there's a 5 times difference between summer and winter, so you'd need about 160W to be self-sufficient in winter (horizontally mounted panels, Toulouse (southern France) climate, always exposed). A 30W panel would only work (and barely so) in summer.  You don't need to be 100% self-sufficient all year long, it's OK to complement with the engine alternator on winter. For that you need a battery coupler, which lets the alternator load the servitude battery, but won't let appliances drain the starter battery."

Also is this a 12 volt fan or a 120 volt fan? An inverter will add a small draw too.   The 250 watt panel is not intended for 12 volt battery charging, it's not the best option but there are ways to charge a 12 volt battery using it.   I'm assuming you're looking at a residential 250 watt panel. I'm assuming it will be a 30v panel. This is going to kick out 8.3 amps at 30v but it's not helpful unless you're running a 24 volt battery bank. Assuming you want a simple 12 volt system for a van, you'll need to have a device that will kick it down to charge a 12 volt battery.   You have two options, the first is likely better, is it's less equipment - probably more expensive.   Get a charge controller that will accept the voltage of your panel and charge a 12 volt battery bank. It will do the converting of the panel voltage as well as charge your battery correctly (if it has the settings for it - AGM/WET/GEL - find out what battery you are going to use and get one that will charge that specific type of battery). You're likely going to need to get an MPPT controller, more expensive but will accept the higher voltage. Don't listen to people that say MPPT is better - yes it's more efficient but that only counts if you run your battery down and need the power.   Option 2- Get a DC to DC converter that will accept your input voltage and then kick out a voltage of around 18 volts, then connect that to a 12 volt solar charge controller specific for your battery type. (A converter may or may not be easy to find depending on how versed you are with small electronics.)  In each system you will have efficiency losses due to converting the power. A controller that will convert from the higher voltage to the lower voltage might be slightly more efficient.  Your panel can likely charge a 12 volt battery bank at around 12 to 14 amperes when converted down to charge a 12 v battery bank. There will be some losses but it is what it is. Expect between 70 and 84 amperes a day in good sun (more for long clear days) - you're battery bank should likely be about 100 aH to accept this potential power."

solar,3blko0,red8reader,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:45:36 2015 UTC,"If you used two 12 volt batteries in series it would make more sense with a 30v panel - regardless of wattage. Then you could easily find a 24 volt solar charge controller. I have a few.   The issue would then be using your power from a 24 volt DC battery bank. You either need to convert the 24 volt DC down to 12 volt DC for any device that runs on 12 volt DC, or you can use a 24 volt inverter to run 120 AC devices."

solar,3blko0,red8reader,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:13:59 2015 UTC,"I would check the input voltage of the controller. Looks like there might be a misprint - 30A where it should state a voltage. If the controller will handle the voltage of the panel then you can give it a try.   Cheap controllers are a hit and miss. See what the warranty is - or it's only $30 so just go for it.   Also - this is only good for a lead acid, wet, type battery. In a van you might want to go AGM. Open Cell Wet batteries release hydrogen - it can be explosive when the gas builds up without proper ventilation and you wouldn't want to inhale it. Either have the battery in a battery box with a vent outside or just keep it outside. Many prefer to have them in a metal box incase they may explode.  AGM is maintenance free and doesn't spill or expel gas but still should be taken care of the same way."

I've heard of 'lease' programs, where you pay the solar company, and they pay your electric bill & part of your installation. Now, I realize that to some degree, this is a rip off b/c they make $ for lots longer. But . . . if it saves me $ too, I'm ok with that until I can manage to own the install.

More on PPA's: Your Prepayment, Purchase and Transfer Choices During the Term:  If you move, you may transfer this agreement to the purchaser of your Home, as specified in the agreement.  At any time during the Term when you sell your home you may prepay the remaining payments (if any) at a discount.  At certain times, as specified in the agreement, you may purchase the System. Your Choices at the End of the Initial Term:  will remove the System at no additional cost to you.  You can upgrade to a new System with the latest solar technology under a new contract.  You may purchase the System for its fair market value.  You may renew your agreement for up to ten (10) years in two (2) five (5) year increments.  Otherwise, the agreement will automatically renew for an additional one (1) year term at 10% less than the then-current average rate charged by your local utilities"

solar,3bksxp,WholesaleSolar,3,Tue Jun 30 04:02:06 2015 UTC,"Hey there! Wholesale Solar here.  Thanks for checking out our systems!  You asked a good question and I spoke to our sales technicians about it.  TL;DR: Our included racking costs a little bit more than plain metal tubes, but meets structural code requirements across the country. It is what we recommend by default because we know it works well and is up to code, but you can configure systems with different (or no) racking if you prefer and if your area allows home-brewed solutions. Our systems also include very good tech support, the necessary cables and professional wiring diagrams, assistance figuring out tax incentives and local rebates, etc. Give us a call and we'll gladly work with you to give you exactly what you need.  Long version: The IronRidge racking we include is a professionally engineered solution designed to pass structural code requirements in all 50 states -- whether that's strong winds in Florida or heavy snow load in Montana. In many states, a home solar system needs to pass building inspections, and to do that you'll need a stamped engineering letter for your racking (which IronRidge provides).  However, if you live in an area that doesn't impose structural building requirements for solar systems and the climate is mild enough that there are no safety concerns, you could also consider skipping the IronRidge racking and building your own out of cheaper parts. I've seen panels installed with everything from the super professional IronRidge racks to a few loose 2x4s and nails... not that I'd recommend that. For our pre-built systems we like to recommend the stuff that we know works well and is up to code, but if you have different requirements or preferences, feel free to give us a call and we can customize any system to your needs -- whether that's a different kind of racking or no racking at all.  Also, although pricey, the racking isn't quite 1/3 of the system price. We also include things like a professional, custom electrical wiring diagram (necessary for some locales), installation and post-install technical support from our tech staff, permitting assistance, help figuring out various tax incentives and rebates applicable to your area, etc. Basically, we don't believe that all solar is made equal, and we don't just combine random panels and inverters for the cheapest price-per-watt. We've been doing solar for 20+ years, and not many solar companies survive that long if all they care about is the absolute lowest prices without regard to quality and fit.  We put a lot of thought into each system, everything from the basics down to the nitty-gritty like the wiring and cables, flashing (parts you add to the racking to protect your roof from the weather), system monitoring, etc. And if you call in (instead of choosing one of the pre-designed systems on our website), we will gladly further customize all that for you based on your locale, power needs, and individual preferences. We test all our configurations to make sure they work well together... and keep in mind that the systems are designed and warrantied for 25 or so years. It's made to last.  Our number is 1-800-472-1142 if you want to speak to a live person about any of these questions, or if you want a custom system that's different from our website listings.  Thanks again for considering us :)"

However, my new house has 4 large trees on the south side of the lot! During the summer, the roof top gets sun all day long, but during the winter the trees lose their leaves, so it may work anyway. I don't mind DIY at all so I figured if I can just get a system together cheap enough, and use microinverters  so the shady parts don't disable the whole array, that's about as good as I can make it.   So far, after lots of looking, this is the best deal I've been able to find. This kit has no mounting hardware, so there's that still to worry about. I'd be putting it up next spring, so I'm thinking it might make sense to buy the panels and microinverters for 4 panels and measure the actual output of the panels for most of a year before going for the full system.   Thoughts? Has anybody here done anything similar?"
solar,3bksxp,WholesaleSolar,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:08:58 2015 UTC,"even a branch is a shadow and will drastically reduce output.   You will need full permit, inspections, and interconnect application.   Probably need a licensed electrician to do some part of the installation, and do not forget about the outside disconnect and 3' setbacks required in CA.   I suggest you look at ironridge to design the racking system and make sure you get decent flashing for the mounts (ironridge has nice flashfeet)."
solar,3bksxp,WholesaleSolar,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:09:34 2015 UTC,"If you're not sure about how shading will affect your particular location and you don't want to hire an installer for a site analysis, you could also DIY it with something like a Solar Pathfinder -- basically a fisheye lens with a special sun chart underneath that you use to trace (from your roof) the surrounding obstructions to see how they will affect your insolation through the year. This requires no installation of any sort, just getting up (safely!) on to wherever you'd want to install the panels and spending fifteen minutes or so with a pencil. Example picture here and videos are on their website.  Some places with municipal/county renewable energy efforts might loan these out for free. Or maybe check to see if a nearby college has anything similar, or I think there are also smartphone apps that do similar things now.  It's not the BEST data, but it's a lot better than just blindly guessing.  EDIT: It looks like PG&E has these on loan in their Tool Lending Library.

solar,3bjfo0,VoltMate,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:13:20 2015 UTC,"For 2-axis trackers the most simple way is a mechanical clock, you just have to remember to wind it up daily. A bit simpler to operate is an (50/60Hz) electrical clock, but you get the added complexity of wiring and electricity cost, and if you have a (unnoticed) 'power outage', it could take some days where the panels are pointing in the wrong direction, unless you complicate things further with a position feedback, which makes it even more complicated as you need a micro controller and variable frequency to re-position the panels. This kind of control can't be bothered with clouds in front of the sun, and will happily ignore the (higher energy) blue sky next to it.      Using photo-resistors/sensors with '>1% difference between East-West comparators' makes it a self-adjusting 'install and forget' system, and having them move only when needed limits wear-and-rear on the mechanical parts. If the panels are pointing 5⁰ off, they still get SIN(85⁰)=99.6% energy.      If you have some spare time, http://www.redrok.com/main.htm might be interesting."
solar,3bijkm,deleted_tomorrow,2,Mon Jun 29 14:46:39 2015 UTC,Have you figured out how much power you panel is actually producing?  A panel rated at 100w at STC may actually produce 50w in typical conditions where you are.  It will be even less in the low insolation months.
solar,3bijkm,BargainManatee,2,Mon Jun 29 16:09:34 2015 UTC,First thing I would do is to determine how much power your pump is actually drawing. How do you know it is running at 1/4 power? Did you measure it?

solar,3bijkm,cleanpowernow,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:35:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, first step is always to figure out what your actual load is. Even at 1/2 power, we have 1.5A x 12V X 24 hours, or 432 watt-hours. Not exactly an insignificant load. If you have an ammeter, measure the actual running amps during the day, and figure out your daily load in watt-hours.  Second, what kind of batteries do you have? Are they true deep-cycle batteries, marine batteries, or starting batteries? If it's a true deep-cycle battery, you maybe be able to discharge to 50-80% of the capacity. If not, you might be able to discharge closer to 20-50% for a marine battery. You want to make sure that your average daily load can be served by the battery bank without heavy discharge. Also, batteries are not the most efficient--I usually count on 80% efficiency, though this will vary depending on the state of charge of the battery, and the battery type.   And as /u/BargainManatee said, odds are you aren't getting anywhere near to 100 watts from your module due to cell temperature higher than standard test conditions (STC), and lower irradiance."
solar,3bijkm,ButchDeal,2,Mon Jun 29 17:41:23 2015 UTC,"you don't have enough solar to charge and run the system.   The batteries are a bad design, get a single 200Ah 12V battery instead of 3 different batteries in parallel.   Make sure that your DC wiring is of sufficient size to prevent voltage drop for the length you have. You don't want to discharge your batteries as deeply as you are, or they will not last the year.  If you can shift the water pumping to daylight hours with a larger tank and larger pump it would be a lit simpler."

As it is, even if your battery is 100% full by 5:00 pm, by the time 10:00 am rolls around, you've used up  51 AH, and that's nearly at 50% depth of discharge.   Hmm...

solar,3b9boh,hmspain,3,Sat Jun 27 01:04:13 2015 UTC,"Why is this important to solar?  Well, capacitors are essentially two thin metal plates separated by a thin (in this case very thin) non-conductive material.  Capacitors are light, and relatively cheap.  Normally, the plates are rolled into the cylinders we expect in a capacitor, but they don’t have to be.  They can be flat, as in solar panel flat.   The higher the capacitance, the more ENERGY you can store, and a solar panel can have layer upon layer of plates on the back without becoming overly heavy.  And of course, capacitors can be charged and discharged infinitely.  No battery replacements every 5 or so years.  OK, imagine a solar panel (built with this kind of capacitance spread across the entire back surface of the solar panel) to store energy right on the panel itself.  You would have the off grid solution we are all looking for.  The solar panel stores energy in the capacitor, and discharges to the micro-inverter when you need the power.  If this 1MegaFarad capacitor guy is successful, a solar panel/super capacitor combination may be in our future."
solar,3b9boh,SnickeringBear,4,Sat Jun 27 01:05:18 2015 UTC,"The problem with super capacitors is that they are leaky, the longer they store a charge, the more of it leaks across the dielectric barrier.  This is not a problem if the charge is stored for minutes or even a few hours, but when you get to 14 hours which is a typical night for a solar system, the leakage will be enough to make current super capacitor designs impractical.  This will change as material science advances.  Eventually leakage will be brought under control and storage on the back of a panel will become practical."
solar,3b9boh,caseigl,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:00:59 2015 UTC,"Isn't he suggesting you'd be discharging when you need power, which would start near the end of the solar day?"
solar,3b9boh,SnickeringBear,4,Sat Jun 27 05:26:52 2015 UTC,There is a peak power demand between 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. when folks get up and ready to go to work.  Solar potential that early is limited which means power has to be stored overnight.  Meeting that early demand is where leakage in a super capacitor becomes a problem.
solar,3b9boh,caseigl,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:32:59 2015 UTC,"Couldn't you just supply enough power to the super capacitor from the grid to prevent leakage overnight if you wanted to cover that peak load period?   The amount of power needed to reduce leakage of your goal is to cover your morning is probably.   For that matter, fully charge before dawn and the high load period using cheaper more efficient base load sources like hydro."

If super new efficient panels come around in 7 years, you'll still be producing 100% of your needs but will have already recovered your investment instead of having to pay out let's say half of what you did 7 years ago. The only reason to switch to new technology would be if you need the extra space allowed by more efficient panels, which is unlikely.   Solar panels do not become obsolete because their function does not change, only their price and space occupied.

solar,3b8nfm,gluten_free_asbestos,2,Sat Jun 27 11:47:13 2015 UTC,"There are literally tens of thousands of academics doing research in solar. Many (most) of these are brilliant, dedicated researchers and a small number of them are doing truly cutting edge stuff with next gen solar concepts in a bunch of different fields. Quantum dots, organic PV pigments, perovskites etc.  But, and this is a big but, they're all dependent on research grant funding, especially the guys doing the cutting edge stuff. Part of what funding committees consider is media coverage, so EVERY TIME they get good results from some lab bench experiment, they go to their university's PR department and issue a press release. And often, some lazy journalist who needs to fill in some space will wet themselves like an excited dog over the announcement. It doesn't matter that it was a bench scale proof of concept that is at least 10-20 years from ever being commercialized, the headline is something like ""OMFG!! All energy solved forever like, tomorrow, with this one weird trick"".   This is reality.   Now, at the same time, new solar is getting incrementally better every year, the legacy of similar research that was being carried out at the lab bench scale one to two decades ago, and is just now getting to market. But the realities of turning bench prototypes into real products always mean those OMFG results from 10-20 years ago, where ""in theory"" they could double solar efficiency, in the real world mean around 0.5% efficiency improvements per year, at 2-3% lower prices.   Right now you can get 260 watt panels for around $169 each. If you wait until next year, you might be able to get 265 W panels for $168 each.  Get them now."

solar,3b8nfm,rroberts3439,2,Sat Jun 27 20:27:18 2015 UTC,That's like $5 a W.  That's crazy talk :)  They didn't want your business to bad.  I mean you could have Sherpa's bring the 5 panels to the top of Everest for that amount.
solar,3b8nfm,gluten_free_asbestos,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:23:48 2015 UTC,"I'd take my numbers with a huge grain of salt, and you're paying for way more than just panels when you contact an install. But that said, $8000 for 5 panels is crazy."
solar,3b8nfm,caller-number-four,2,Sat Jun 27 20:34:20 2015 UTC,That's what I told them.  Considering they quoted $6k about 18 months ago.  They do come from about 3 hours away and would be in town.  I won't be adding any more at that cost.
solar,3b8nfm,ButchDeal,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:56:19 2015 UTC,"Adding on to a solar system is costly and often requires a lot of retiring, possibly replacing inverters, possibly getting older matching modules, new permits inspections, and interconnects."

solar,3b8nfm,ButchDeal,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:04:02 2015 UTC,"SolarEdge and micros expand simpler than others but you still have permit, construction costs, inspections and interconnect applications.   Some interconnect allow one time 10% expansion with out changing terms but that is rare and others would have to switch to new interconnect terms.   There are fixed construction costs that make small solar systems and small solar additions costly as well.   Far cheaper to install 6kw than to install 3kw and expand to 6kw a year later."

I am keenly aware of the costs that go into building a roof top array.  :)  Still for them to quote me $6k 18 months ago and $8k+ 2 weeks ago is a significant jump for 5 panels where all they have to do is rack and wire into the existing infrastructure.  They would be on the roof for an afternoon, max.  Plus ... my array is nearly 3 years old."
solar,3b7tg4,ajswdf,7,Fri Jun 26 17:45:25 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, no.  This is for one very important reason called ""islanding"".  This is when you are producing electricity into the grid that would normally be dead which can be extremely dangerous for workers who might be repairing the lines three or for houses down.  There might be grid tie interfaces that work around this but as far at I know they aren't in use yet."
solar,3b7tg4,BarcodeNinja,6,Fri Jun 26 17:53:02 2015 UTC,"UL 1741 is required of all inverters that they shut off in the instance of a power outage so they don't backfeed into the grid where there's a potential for electrical shock for someone working on a power line.  http://www.metlabs.com/blog/emc/ul-1741-safety-testing-of-inverters-includes-anti-islanding-requirement/  If you want your PV to work when the power goes out, you'll need an automatic transfer switch and some battery backup.    SMA does have inverters that allow you to install an outlet as a ""secure power supply"", but it only gives you 1500W of power.  It's fine for plugging in a few things, but it's not meant as a whole house backup."
solar,3b7tg4,malohi,7,Fri Jun 26 19:23:54 2015 UTC,If you use an SMA inverter there is a secure power supply switch that allows you to directly use the power from the solar (up to 1500 watts with 2 plugs) after the grid power has gone down. We have been installing them for about 18 months now.
solar,3b7tg4,wildewisdom,2,Fri Jun 26 18:27:50 2015 UTC,"Cool, do they provide any other use? A quick search shows they're about $1,500 for 1,500 watts, which seems like a good chunk of change to provide power in the rare instances when the power is out in the middle of the day."

Rooftop solar is only a competitor in so far as there is a rigged market to buy trivial amounts of home produced energy; if the solar homeowners had to compete with the utilities on a level playing field, and actually find a buyer and negotiate a price etc, they'd be stuffed.   Walmart stores are very different; they are using solar to reduce their utility bill, and can use every watt they can produce, no exporting and buy back.  They are getting the very best value from their investment."
solar,3b7rkc,Fileobrother,2,Fri Jun 26 17:31:04 2015 UTC,"I am learning that batteries are around 30% effective and that grid tied solar may be better in most situations  If your utility buys back extra power you have some benefits.   Grid tied lets you start small, and add panels as you go. Grid tied (with generator) gives you a complete backup and high usage security without the cost of batteries. If you utility will purchase power, you can sell back power generated at generating peak times, while using their power at your usage peak times. If an installer in your area has experience with your grid and any incentives it might save you loads of work or $$. If you are going with grid tied with net metering you can calculate your break even point per panel(this panel pays for itself in X years).  Remember the utility buys at a lower rate than they charge you."

solar,3b2xov,perpetualjon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:18:01 2015 UTC,"In the senerio you provided it can happen. It's likely that the A/C unit wouldn't be consuming 500 watts max all the time, they generally cycle on and off - this also depends on how well insulated the van is. If you can effectively get the temp down.   The A/C pulling off a 12 volt battery would be about 42 amperes - 800 watts of solar could supply 45 amperes. You would want a large battery bank for your calculations and you'll need an inverter. There are loses in the the system - but again your A/C unit will turn on and off (the condenser anyways).   Calculate volume of the van and the volume that the A/C can work in. When working with such small margins you might consider only running the A/C unit when the sun is shining bright. Your A/C unit can kill the battery fast if you don't have an effective charging system.   You might also consider playing with micro inverters and running it direct.

solar,3b2xov,TurnbullFL,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:38:07 2015 UTC,"It's definitely doable. Don't know of any instructables I can point you to though.

The heat will be a problem in your location -- solar panels generate heat while they operate, and prefer to operate below 25C (77F). You may have a local solar dealer who knows a good model that works at high temperatures (probably well over 120F in the mojave at the surface of a solar panel).  Your cheapest option for immediate savings is to insulate your van. But if you have the cash to dabble with the solar power, go for it. Ideally you'd find a DC air conditioner so that you can avoid an inverter. Unfortunately this whole project will probably cost over $1k, with more than $500 just for the panels.

That means that it may be possible with 3 of the 245W panels listed below (along with a battery bank) to keep this system running for a good long time!  3 x 245W panels: $825 1 x DC AC unit: (between $600 and $1200)  So it looks like a project that could be anywhere from $1500 to $2000 depending on my ability to find a good deal on the AC unit.
solar,3b2ii2,cavemanus_maximus,6,Thu Jun 25 13:13:16 2015 UTC,"Both of the points that youve found online marking support of solar in Florida are flawed in the interpretation theyre giving you.  Net metering in the state of Florida means you will get paid for all energy you pump back into the grid - more specifically though, what it means is that you will get paid at the retail rate for your electricity - up to but not greater than - the amount of electricity you use. Afterwards - all energy, in excess of your use, will be paid the wholesale rate of about four to five cents per kilowatt hour. If your solar system were to be paid only at the wholesale rate your return on investment would be somewhere between 75 and 100 years, beyond the lifetime of the system by about double. This is why we max out on solar systems around 101% of the customer's energy usage.  Secondly, that $20,000 incentive is gone. It lasts literally for less than 2 minutes, comes once a year and the last year of the program just passed.  There are two benefits to going solar in the state of Florida - we have a relatively low installation cost and fairly solid solar resources. Your return on investment will be between 10 and 12 years."

I'm getting something closer to 7 years, but I don't know what the installation costs in Florida are.    Also, what about getting something like a PV film for a metal roof and going a more DIY route?"
solar,3b2ii2,acusticthoughts,2,Thu Jun 25 14:58:48 2015 UTC,"Cost per watt of $3.25, wattage of 10,000. Cost $32.5k - incentive federal $9750, new cost $22.75k.  Production in best aligned systems about $15 per kilowatt per month. 10000 watts x $15 equals $150 in savings per month, $1800/year.  $22.75/$1.8= 12.6 year ROI  DIY is cool with the sticky stuff - but they have a lower efficiency, this produce less energy per square foot. If you're OK with that, and a shorter lifetime, it's a good product."
solar,3b2ii2,dabenpb,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:23:55 2015 UTC,"How is that cost broken down between inverters ,  panels, and install?  Would it be feasible to install less panels now  and add more later?  I have held up on install especially do to the FPL  incentive disappearing in like 1 min. Can it be retroactive ?"
solar,3b2ii2,acusticthoughts,2,Thu Jun 25 18:14:23 2015 UTC,"Hardware ~ $1.70, Install/Engineering/etc - $1.60.  You can add panels. I recommend not adding extra hardware like a larger inverter or railing, just install a regular small system squeezed into one corner on the roof. Make sure the electrician maps out future cable runs and spacing for further inverters. Using a micro inverter could potentially make this an even easier upgrade. As a solar contractor I would definitely not bet on anything being retroactive. As a redditor, I still wouldn't bet on there being retroactive incentives."
solar,3b2ii2,acusticthoughts,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:21:12 2015 UTC,"How hard is the install for a DIY system?  Obviously the electrical needs to be permitted and such, but is it a big deal to do the racking and such (on a metal roof) by yourself?  Any issues with winds/insurance/etc in FL doing that?"
solar,3b2ii2,acusticthoughts,2,Thu Jun 25 18:57:09 2015 UTC,"You need to be precise while drilling holes, hundreds of them, into your roof. If you can do that - the rest of the project is a breeze.  You will need a PE to sign off on your structural drawings. That can be done for $350. you will be legally liable to follow the directions in those drawings. Electrical drawings can be gotten for $120 - no PE stamp needed."
solar,3b2ii2,trejewchet,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:11:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks!    If I go the PV film route, is there any PE sign off needed?  Or could I literally slap those on the roof myself, hook up all the DC stuff myself, and then just have an electrician do the actual AC/tie work?"
solar,3b2ii2,acusticthoughts,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:21:18 2015 UTC,It doesn't make sense that you would need a mechanical or structural PE for a film. I've never installed the product - so I'd suggest you submit your permit before buying hardware and see what happens. I bet the manufacturer could give you great guidance on how to minimize costs when installing their product. Local jurisdiction might require an electrician to do the final grid connection - by law. And do be conscious that DC voltage can hit 600V - its not a 12 or 24 low voltage situation.
solar,3b2ii2,Forkboy2,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:33:21 2015 UTC,"It's all about interconnection and permitting.   Many states have net metering and incentives but it's all in how easy the actual experience is.   Here in California, it's the building department and the utility that make solar difficult. Like LADWP, their estimated time is 4 months before you can actually turn on your system.   Florida got a lot of heat the last few years, so hopefully they'll be changing quickly"
solar,3b2ii2,acusticthoughts,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:59:28 2015 UTC,Interconnection takes about 2 weeks in Florida
