feminisms,3dtd90,87x8gfh,2,Sun Jul 19 07:03:56 2015 UTC,"If the main argument of this post works, it should be acceptable to liberal feminists. They might have to change some of their practice, but they can keep the ""liberal"" part of things.  Consider this analogy: I think it is wrong to lie to someone. Do lies by omission count? Bad question - if you focus on this, you're going to end up lying more often than if you just didn't omit relevant info.  I'm not convinced that asking questions like these does make sexual harm more likely than it would otherwise be, considering the state of things. But I'm happy to grant it. In that case, we should reject the ""black jack"" view of sexual morality. If accepting the ""black jack"" practice were part of liberal theory, that would be a bad thing. But it's not:   You can hold that SM is liberating without saying that there's anything wrong with vanilla sex. I don't think we should accept that SM is liberatory, but that's a different issue. In the same way that very few radical feminists have ever called for sex to be two women politely nodding at each other from across a room, very few liberal feminists think that sex should be as brutal as possible short of rape. I've never heard anyone say anything close to that, except when heavily qualified by ""Speaking only for myself, I personally find that this kind of sex is fun for me, and this other thing isn't"".  So I thought I should check out the previous post. Maybe there was an anti-liberal argument there?  The bulk of the content there is positive. I think that's a good thing! There's not enough alternatives to ""principle of consent""-type sexual moralities. I take it the main negative arguments of that other post are:   Volenti non fit injura wrongly says that non-consensual shoulder touching is as bad as sexual violence. But this is clearly not a consequence of volenti. A theory of the type of wrong committed is not a theory of how harmful things are. I guess you could say that non-consensual shoulder-touching shouldn't even be in the same category as sexual violence, even though they are very different as matters of degree. I don't see what merits that view has, though. Some sex acts are degrading (or otherwise wrong), regardless of whether they are consented to. This is a very old question for people who want to give a liberal sexual morality. I have a very hard time seeing how an argument of this kind can ever be convincing (even if it is right). Respect for a person and respect for their consent seem to be all caught up with each other."
feminisms,3dtd90,topoi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:58:20 2015 UTC,"The author critiques liberalism as a collective phenomenon, so while it may not make sense because liberal feminists say ""speaking only for myself"", the author has observed many liberals ""speaking only for themselves"" to, as a whole, exhibit the black jack sexual morality. It is a feature of liberalism to look at the trees instead of the forest.  Even as someone with a (perhaps unfortunate) attraction towards BDSM myself, I won't say that BDSM is liberatory, because by framing it as a positive thing you encourage people to do it. And since it's so positive, and people love freedom, they'll want more -- so let's increase the intensity, right? So they'll do more daring, risky things, to push the envelope. Black jack is all about pushing the envelope. People will be tempted to do more daring things just by virtue of desensitization, so you don't have to encourage them. And you know what they say: it's all fun and games (and perfectly consensual), until someone gets hurt (and/or until it stops being consensual). Moderation and all that. We don't say that skydiving or fighting for sport is liberatory, we say that it is risky. BDSM is like that."

The study that found this pay gap took the median annual salary of men and the median annual salary of women and compared them. This is a very ineffective way to determine if there is a pay gap, as the female-dominated jobs like healthcare, teaching, and secretaries make significantly less than the male dominated jobs like construction, mining, and utilities. There is definitely a gap for some women compared to similarly skilled men, but this ""77 cent for every dollar"" is based off of a study that compares apples to oranges. More men work as lawyers and CEOs then women, so comparing them to a nurse will cause a huge gap in salary to be seen."

Men are devalued for it and always have been, and women are more and more being devalued for it (""oh, you're just a housewife?""), and the result is both men and women work, and the home duties of cleaning, cooking, and childcare are very often outsourced, with the predictable poor results of that, and the overall higher stressful lives both men and women live as a result.  Many would argue the traditionalists did value that work - enough to shame women who didn't do it.  Of course, that approach has its own problems.

Sexual activity may have occurred, but fairly often many men would pay me for my emotional labor, as it were. There were a few johns who paid for a few hours just to hold hands and tell them that they aren't bad, they aren't a total fuckup, that everything would be okay. Others paid me to tell them the truth. Others yet paid me to degrade them since nobody else in their lives would and they felt they needed it.

Can such work be monetized? The article states that therapists have more or less done this already, and barkeeps and sex workers have been doing it longer than that. But I think that the value of this work is recognized more widely than the article suggests, though not monetarily. Hardly ever is this kind of service sought from strangers, it occurs almost exclusively within the confines of a relationship be it with family,friends, or lovers. Within this context it is considered a two way street and emotional work is both given and received. The people who do this work for us and for whom we perform this work are often considered the most highly valued among people we know. In this way the value is recognized. Do I think that emotional work within relationships should be monetized? No. Do I have a problem with people paying service providers for this kind of emotional labor? Also no.  The article also mentions that women are considered to be more emotionally savvy as opposed to men and are thus expected to provide more emotional labor in our sexist society. I think this is a fair point. I think mainstream society is biased in this way and does expect more from women in this regard. However, the article then praises the #GiveYourMoneyToWomen for demanding compensation for women's attention. But doesn't that attitude only reinforce the idea that emotional labor is the sole domain of women, and they should thus be more highly valued? I feel like a better message to deliver would have been to encourage men to take that emotional burden on themselves more often in order to support the women and other men in their lives."

If so, I guess I'm not down with their vision of a just world.  Also the author's analysis is pretty fucking weak if referencing having a nice car is interpreted that the rap song is not about self survival. Rap responds to the winner take all hierarchy of capitalism by creating a vision where the individual, despite being a member of a stigmatized group, is able to experience the life of the very most privileged.  Sure, it may not mean they will start knitting Marxist sweaters anytime soon, but the image is empowering in a context where the individual is forced to participate in a capitalist frame.  If the point of the article is the just that the BBHMM video is not written from a feminist frame, well, I guess duh.   Maybe I'm just missing the thrust of post though. If so I would appreciate guidance."

To use a quick & dirty example: Far more marriages are cause for personal regret than abortions, but no one calls for the banning of (Hetero) marriage because of the high Hetero divorce rate. Why? Because the government should not be legislating based on individual levels of regret for an autonomous, legal decision, and it's a no brainer for the majority. That abortion is somehow different and regret should be a factor in legality indicates to me a need to distract from a lack of true, cogent argument against abortion rights. Even if this study revealed the vast majority of women regretted their abortions, I would still fail to see the relevancy as it relates to our laws and freedoms.  Too bad for the huge disconnect between what is and what should be."

Pro-choice people believe that abortion being illegal infringes upon the rights of women, and pro-life people believe it infringes upon the rights of the unborn. It is imposing individual morals on others. The only decent argument that exists is whether or not ""life begins at conception"".   We have settled this moral/ethical decision via Roe vs. Wade.  It is absurd that this is continuing to even be a political discussion instead of a hypothetical one. It's like reassessing Civil Rights, or 15 years from now saying ""hmm, I think we need to rethink gay marriage""."

feminisms,3d7syj,twoweektrial,3,Tue Jul 14 15:58:43 2015 UTC,"Um...actually, I don't think that was an aspect of her bracelets. What was an aspect of her bracelets was that if a man bound them together, she lost her powers until someone else could unbind her.   I was listening to an episode of Fresh Air and the women discussing this thought it was symbolism on the part of William Moulton Marston and the rising feminist movement. That could be, but I think it's also important to note that Marston was also a proponent of BDSM as a healthy sexual component, and having a superheroine bound might have been him indulging a kink on his part.   Of course, now, Wonder Woman's bracelets actually act as a limiter on her power, according to the most recent reboot of her in the New 52. She takes them off, and her divine power comes out in full, making her powerful enough to take on a Greek god. She's also the Greek goddess of war after inheriting the title from Ares."

feminisms,3cvouu,Outsidethetriangle,2,Sat Jul 11 21:32:35 2015 UTC,"As Meghan Murphy says in her response to same-sex marriage in Ireland:  Marriage is not a progressive institution. It is an institution founded on the idea of women as property, traded among men, and it continues to be a site of oppression for women today. More than a third of women murdered around the world are killed by their partner. Domestic abuse kills more people than wars. The most progressive thing we could do would be to abolish the institution once and for all.  ... [Sycamore] is probably right that the push for gay marriage is a boring attempt to assimilate with a heterosexist, patriarchal institution of ownership and domination.   Basically, because they (the author and the activists she mentions) cannot see marriage in any but one light, they assume anyone who wants it is just conforming to the dominant culture. It's not a particularly convincing argument, especially since it essentially calls for the destruction of the institution rather than just clarifying that it's a choice and not a necessity. But the rest of the argument still stands: if you accept premise A, then premise B logically follows."
feminisms,3cvouu,IAmTheShitRedditSays,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:27:37 2015 UTC,"And it is presumptuous to assume lesbians replicate straight marriages. Matter of fact, data shows that when it comes to housework, lesbian households tend to divide chores equally. I assume the same is true with gay men. I think this is straight feminist projecting the issues common in straight marriages as inherent and universal. It is hetero-centric to assume so.   Plus unmarried women that cohabitate with men are not less likely to be victims of domestic abuse. So it is not marriage that somehow creates this issue.   The fact that marriage in the past was about property is irrelevant. Dowries don't exist in any western country anymore. Marriage is about hospital visitation, taxes, and inheritance nowadays.   The problem with straight marriage is not relevant to gay people. The problems with straight marriage would still exist if marriage went away. And wanting the legal rights that come with marriage equality, doesn't mean gay people will start acting like a stereotypical ""leave it to beaver"" lifestyle.   I think that some straight feminist(mostly the radfems) are just upset that their position on marriage is only relevant to straight people, and this somehow invalidates their dogmatic views.   Of those lesbian feminist that are dogmatically against marriage, I think it is because some gay people put so much stock to being different, that it has become a part of their identity. Now that  they are getting more rights, they will have to stop pretending that they are inherently interesting. I always roll my eyes when gay people talk about ""boring straight people"" as if they or most gays are skydiving or climbing the highest mountains."

I disclosed to my family that my older brother molested and raped me for most of my childhood. It didn't go well and it was extremely traumatic. Thankfully, my husband, kids and therapist fully believe me. My abuser's son even believes me. My parents and younger brother have scrutinized my life as to why I would make this up. It has been decades since the abuse and rape happened but I will always be dealing with the ramifications of the abuse and now, the disclosure. I am still glad I told them. It is good to have that toxic secret out in the open instead of festering inside of me. I admire these women who have come forward. They are incredibly brave. I am sure there are many, many more that will never come forward and that is their right & choice. We all do what we have to do to survive. Victim silencing is common. My family would have preferred me to stay silent and won't let me even talk about it anymore. my mom is the worst offender in this area and she was a victim of rape in her past.

Yeah, there isn't a ""Boys with Gluten"" account, but there is a ""Cute boys with Cats"" account, which is also ""artistically photographed"" and often sexualised.  Just because we’re women doesn’t mean we get to cry sexism every time a pretty, half naked (which, I like the little jab at the girl who made her “career by wearing underwear”. Yep, people do that you know?) girl is in shot. The rules aren’t that we can have Men being shown doing “girly” things in a sexualized or visually appealing way, and that everyone is banned from creating any content where the opposite is true.   2)  It doesn’t need to have girls in period panties (wtf) If you're going to make a popular instagram account then of course it's going to have nice imagery. I don't WANT to look at period panties. I never do. That's not something I want society to start enjoying either, because who gives a shit about when I am doing that?  Is there some feed of “Men with chubby bodies in stained shirts while holding cats” that I should know about?  3)  It has this quote in it.  ""…it’s highly unlikely any of these sexy donut-loving ladies actually eat donuts, but even if they did happen to indulge once in a while, the need to document this consumption tells us so much about the purpose of this indulgence."" Way to make assumptions about someone because of their looks.  OH, which is exactly what you’re fighting against?  I am not present on this specific instagram, but I am a fit (cyclist), reasonably attractive, long-legged woman and I eat pizza and I exercise, and I am a normal person.  Sometimes I have people take photos of me eating pizza, too. Sometimes I get excited about eating carbs, too!   4) It’s not there to offend, it’s not there to annoy. It’s an instagram feed. It’s not doing anything against the “good fight” (which, by the way is more than just women eating pizza, in photos, in undies). If you think it’s stupid: don’t follow it.
