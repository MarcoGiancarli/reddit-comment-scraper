To be honest, most of it carries over pretty well, and most of the confusion I've had has just been differences in terminology. For landscapes, having a low division count, triangulating the mesh, and using deformer tools will get you 99% of the way. For other objects, my process isn't any different from doing high poly modelling, except I don't subdivide and keep adding details and simply triangulate the low poly mesh. The only other Maya unique thing I do is use Mental Ray for rendering, and I use the sun and sky feature to give natural light with good final gather and other goodies."

For example you can displace a very dense plane into a mountain by applying a height map to it. Parallax mapping is more or less an improved version of bump/normal mapping which is used to fake depth on objects.

Your friend might actually be better served by a quadro card if he is only running CAD applications.  The performance characteristics are a bit different between the types of cards, gaming cards are great at fill rate and spamming tons of textured polygons at the monitor, where as workstation cards are better at parametrically calculating tens of millions of triangles on the fly to display complicated CAD files efficiently.

To start with it sounds like you have rotational symmetry, so we only need to model one hole, and 1/4th of the top hole. We also aren't concerned with thickness since we can add that uniformly with a shell modifier at a later point.   If you want quads only topology, start with a spherified cube, then delete half the faces to make it a hemisphere. Decide on a good sub division level at this point. Make this object semi-transparent and create proxy mesh cylinders as if you were going to boolean, and be sure to instance them so you can control the radius to make it the size you want.   Using your proxy cylinders, go back to the hemisphere and try and create loops that are close to where the cylinder edges intersect but don't add too many, try to keep the topology even, you can remove a loop for every loop you add.  From here, cut new verts into your hemisphere where the cylinder intersects it in a circle pattern to create your new edges, then delete the center when you are finished. Do a similar procedure for the top hole. If your topology is good, you should be able to use symmetry to avoid having to do all 4 sides.   Once you have the paper-thin version, apply a shell modifier to get the correct thickness."
3Dmodeling,3dbzhn,particleman1010,4,Wed Jul 15 02:55:59 2015 UTC,"Is this what you mean? http://imgur.com/6NhH2lF  If so, here's how I did it in Maya (based on /u/particleman1010 's method)   Create a default sphere. Create a cylinder. Make sure it has 14 axis subdivisions and >1 height subdivisions. Delete the sphere down to 1/4, exactly like /u/particleman1010 says. Rotate the cylinder 45 degrees in two axes so that it interpenetrating the remaining part of the sphere, like so: http://imgur.com/Z03B1NX. Using the cylinder as a guide, delete the faces that intersect with the cylinder, like so: http://imgur.com/ikIvE2j Now, move one of the cylinder's edges (use Object as your move axis) so that the edge lines up with the hole you just created. This will allow you to vert snap the edges of the hole to the corresponding verts on the cylinder. This is why we gave the cylinder 14 axis subdivisions. To get better topology(although this is still far from perfect, I'm not really an ace topology guy), you can add a few of edge loops, like so: http://imgur.com/x6AZLVQ You can also slide some edges at this step to get a more even topology. Delete the necessary faces to create 1/4 of the top hole. Extrude your object to get some thickness. Delete the faces on the thin edges of the extrusion. Mirror/join your geometry."

3Dmodeling,3d5ug2,Shirghazaytiger,2,Tue Jul 14 15:43:37 2015 UTC,"Model the basic shape of the blade using your preferred technique (like box modeling), and once you've got a good base, hit ""3"" to see the smooth-mesh preview. The geometry will probably look like an unrecognizable blob, but that's where you go into mesh tools --> insert edge loop tool, and start adding in edges to sharpen up the parts you want sharper. The closer a loop is to the outer edge, the harder the edge will be and vice versa. Some people call this method ""fencing"". If you're not restricted to a certain amount of polys, it's great. This will also help keep your model mostly (if not all) quads."
3Dmodeling,3d5ug2,BrianD_NYC,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:59:50 2015 UTC,Oh yeah I've used that technique many times! I guess I didn't use it because I wanted the round edge to be round before smoothing it

Just need to get used to how placing edgeloops near other ones, will hold or not hold detail together if you smooth it.  Bevel tool can be hit or miss, even if you know it's foibles well.  Its just far from perfect compared to similar tools in other programs.  Some cases its perfect for what I need.  Other cases, just split it by hand where you need to.  Modeling comes down to doing it by hand, or needing to be precise with loops/vertices at some point."
3Dmodeling,3d5ug2,the4thaggie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:13:21 2015 UTC,"I've found that it's good to ensure you have good topology and a complete edgeloop in the areas you want to bevel.  You also want to bevel the complete loop at the same time.  I usually use Cntrl+shift with multicut and 10% snapping to lay out supporting edges instead of bevel tool.  This achieves predictable and repeatable supporting edgeloops (which are used in smoothing), and it also shows me if I have topology errors."
3Dmodeling,3d5ug2,thebubz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:53:14 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! I'll keep that in mind but the problem is beveling border edges usually creates n gons in and of itself so I'm looking to avoid it

3Dmodeling,3cydnu,reddit1024,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:37:31 2015 UTC,"Haha okay. I have a question regarding your project, pardon me as this is coming from someone who has very little knowledge of shading/texturing... when you say you are 'working' on the skin shader, do you mean that you are tweaking the parameters of a pre-existing shader or are you coding your own custom shader."
3Dmodeling,3cydnu,reddit1024,4,Sat Jul 11 22:42:06 2015 UTC,"Im not coding a new shader, I use the existing sss2 shader because I hate the new vrayskinmtl.  But I'm also doing more than plugging in maps when I say ""working on the shader"".   I've been making tiling micro-displacement maps that mimic the very subtle skin textures of different areas of the body, and making a master micro displacement map using layered texture nodes that mix the micro displacement using blend maps.  The micro displacement maps have corresponding specular and gloss maps that tile over the displacement exactly, and I mix those procedural layered textures into the overall gloss and spec.  So when I start a new human, I can use my skin shader which does all the micro (and some mid-range) detail for me, and then just replace the albedo, spec, glosss etc. maps for the large range details.  Thats the goal anyways.  If I rendered this out for example, at full resolution of the displacement map, I could print it at 300 pixels per inch (standard print resolution), and it would be over 20 feet tall with no pixelation because each pixel of each map would = exactly 1 pixel of information. And in future projects I would be able to keep all that detail for free (as long as my uv's dont change.)  My math might be wrong so feel free to correct me:  1024 disp maps tiling 160 times = 163,000 pixel displacement map + the same for gloss, spec, and SSS weight.  160,000 pixels divided by 2 because only 1/2 the body is visible at any one time (front or back). = 80,000  80,000 pixels / 300 DPi = 266 inches of pixels at that resolution.  266 / 12 inches to a foot = 22 feet."

3Dmodeling,3cydnu,klonkish,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:12:39 2015 UTC,"Hey there - great job so far.  I'm working on some skin-tech at work at the moment, and have learned stuff over the last few months that I think you could benefit from here (?)  Firstly - the balance between translucency and SSS. You could take some steps to make the main area of her ear translucent to light behind. It currently looks very solid, even when we know it to be very thin. It will let light through in a lot of lighting circumstances, so consider adding that.  The SSS is good, but it's a little out of control in areas. Over her eyes, it seems to be taking light where light would usually get trapped and not bounce out. light would escape through slipper areas, and less-so in the folds over her upper eyelids. it also seems to be creeping through the bottom edge of her top lip (although visually, it kinda almost reads as a reflection of her lower lip... )  Consider using a tiling skin detail bump or normal map over the base normal (think, micro-detail, over the pore and pock-mark details you already have) - it adds a lot to the overall perception of detail. Modulate it so that it's never dominant, and mask it away from stuff like the ears and lips.   SSS on face skin is never consistent, so if you can make a mask to control how strong the SSS is around her face, it would make it react more realistically (if that's the intent).   try using a small, but bright light source (the flashlight from a phone, or a bright LED pen or something), turn it on, and press it against your skin around your own face, and in a mirror, see how dispersed the light is at different areas of your skin - you'd be surprised how counter-intuitive it is.. some areas you'd think wouldn't scatter any, scatter loads - and vice-versa - then put those findings into an SSS mask.   You can stop the glow from inside her nostrils by bending those normals, so that they face forward a little, thus stopping light bouncing off those pixels perpendicularly.Also, you could kill the specular response on those pixels - different ways of achieving the same thing. With bent normals you can still have a correct specular response, however.   Also, if you can, consider having a broad, white-ish falloff in the diffuse of the shader, so on the glancing angles you can simulate velus-hair around her face.. She currently doesn't have any 'fluff' on her skin. if this ends up being a realtime model, that's a quick way of achieving that.   Consider tinting the AO you have, so that it can emulate bounced red-orange light coming off her skin, and reflecting back onto it. The shadows around her face are very black - helping the skin look very solid and plasticcy.   Finally - consider using an IBL to light it - your metals will really sing when they have stuff other than lights or lighting cards to reflect - also, the variety of light colors you get from an IBL will really help the response from the skin look more believable."
3Dmodeling,3cydnu,klonkish,2,Sun Jul 12 05:59:21 2015 UTC,"Hi Zender,   Firstly - the balance between translucency and SSS. You could take some steps to make the main area of her ear translucent to light behind. It currently looks very solid, even when we know it to be very thin.    Yeah, I just transitioned back to the SSS2 shader from the newer vrayskinmtl, and I was trying out the raytrace settings, so some of my thicknesses are off - in the end I am hoping to have accurate thickness of my model to get some of this, vs. relying on radius maps, but its gonna take some experimenting.   Consider using a tiling skin detail bump or normal map over the base normal (think, micro-detail, over the pore and pock-mark details you already have) - it adds a lot to the overall perception of detail.   I'm sorta surprised you can't see it. I replied to a commenter above about it, but thats actually the whole exercise of the skin shader hear. Right now I have three levels of displacement, the lowest micro level is equivalent to 160,000x160,000 pixel map, so I estimate I could print this out at 22 feet tall without coming up against any pixelation problems. Overkill I realize. I have 10 zones of unique micro geo detailing.  I was able to find samples at that level on a couple sites dedicated to cg research funded by universities, and also ran into some some research papers that have helped me a ton.  It is very subtle because thats just how skin is, but its there in a big way.   try using a small, but bright light source (the flashlight from a phone, or a bright LED pen or something), turn it on, and press it against your skin around your own face, and in a mirror, see how dispersed the light is at different areas of your skin - you'd be surprised how counter-intuitive it is.. some areas you'd think wouldn't scatter any, scatter loads - and vice-versa - then put those findings into an SSS mask.   The sss mask is called a radius map, and although I do have a general one, I am trying to use the raytrace functions a bit more fully. Its gonna take some effort though. It wont mimic things like interior density though, so a radius map is always going to be necessary in some way.   You can stop the glow from inside her nostrils by bending those normals, so that they face forward a little, thus stopping light bouncing off those pixels perpendicularly.Also, you could kill the specular response on those pixels - different ways of achieving the same thing. With bent normals you can still have a correct specular response, however.   Thats not light bleeding or glow, actually. I have a couple lights in the scene, one is lower and it is emitting specular bounces only, which isn't physically accurate but it produces a better specular effect in my opinion - things like this are the trade off. In areas with deep shadow, you still see some specular hits, which is what you're seeing there. You'll see some on the underside of the neck as well, and in some other areas.  The lip is just a reflection of itself.    Consider tinting the AO you have, so that it can emulate bounced red-orange light coming off her skin,   There is no AO or GI right now, for render times and a couple other reasons (AO doesn't play well with SSS and intersecting objects in vray3 right now, I hear its being fixed).  For other people reading though I really wouldn't suggest using AO to mimic skin scattering. This was done heavily back in the day for games, but we don't really do it like that anymore if you're following a proper PBR workflow, and for rendering stuff it breaks the physical affect of actual scattering. A lot of people think scattering is an effect of red/orange light escaping, but the actual effect of SSS produces almost as much blue light scattering as well. The reason we see red light is because the light absorbs the blue and scatters the red back out into our eyes, but the effect of absorbing blue light changes the perceived albedo color quite a bit. The depth of blue/red depends on the angle of the viewer and the light source, and while some fake AO is predictable (like the ears), it can really mess up the look of your skin from other angles, if you have a false red overlaying a subtle blue, for instance. Again, maybe not so much of a big deal in games, but for rendering its a bad idea, and most PBR engines that I've used have a skin shader now to mimic this effect, to reduce the need for this (marmoset, unreal, and cryengine probably has the best one).   Finally - consider using an IBL to light it   Yes, there are several lights, all IBL. The main one is from a guy whose name I cant remember now, but he captures an amazing dynamic range even with Linear Workflow I could use a burning gamma to get better shadows, I love his stuff, I wish I could remember his name.   Also, if you can, consider having a broad, white-ish falloff in the diffuse of the shader, so on the glancing angles you can simulate velus-hair around her face.   In the end she will have actual peach fuzz, id rather do it this way with PFX. So for now she's going to look a little more oily than normal, but that will cut down and also create a different sort of falloff.    if this ends up being a realtime model,   She wont be. Realtime characters is my day job, I do more physically accurate realistic rendering stuff on my weekends to blow off steam."

3Dmodeling,3cwgeg,Calvinatorr,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:09:14 2015 UTC,"Oh sorry it's not a Blender specific thing - basically you have a texture map which describes how transparent or opaque each part of your texture is, so generally black would be transparent and white would be fully opaque (alpha value of 255).  So you would fill in the shape of what you want opaque as white and fill the rest in black, for say a chain link fence on a single face without adding extra geometry.  http://xeolabs.com/images/scenejs/leavesAlphaMap.jpg - for example this is a transparency map for a tree branch, and you would apply this as the transparency colour along with your regular diffuse texture etc."

The only thing that looks a bit off to me is the amount of bump on the floor - in my mind that kinda flooring should be laminated/lacquered, and so wouldn't show so much of the grain detail.

3Dmodeling,3cs6h8,joshtempte,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:50:57 2015 UTC,You might be right. I was going for a little older floor though wich actually would be a little bumpier since the top layer lacquered would have been brushed of over time. But maybe I should lower it a bit.

In fact you have to be extremely good or unique to make a living in those fields, but because of that they haven't become obsolete, they have just been elevated as an art form."

3Dmodeling,3cgl6r,CaptainStarmander,4,Tue Jul 7 19:55:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the compliment, I wouldn't say I'm all that good yet though.  No tutorials I know of in particular. I would just say make sure you have the basics down in zbrush and know basic anatomy. Don't dive head first into big projects if you're just starting out and take things slowly. Start with simple characters or bring your focus even smaller and work on sculpting a hand or something, and after you get the shape down really focus on getting the details.  My work flow is generally roughing out the shape I need with dynamesh and retopologizing in Maya, then going back into zbrush. I found having a clean base mesh to start from makes everything cleaner.  The biggest thing is just putting in the time and showing people your work that will critique and tell you what you need to improve on. Having good reference images is definitely recommended. Going into zbrush and sculpting something out of your mind doesn't normally turn out well if you are a beginner."
3Dmodeling,3cgl6r,thelordyface,2,Tue Jul 7 20:43:22 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, my own experience with Zbrush sculpting has always been...  I've gotten ok in blender, but character models are a struggle for me. I once modeled a cat, it came out great until the face, which was terrible....  Anyway, I've just gotten Zbrush again, gonna give it another go, see if I can model anything. I'm taking your advice and starting with a hand."

3Dmodeling,3cdpvn,photogjunkie,4,Tue Jul 7 02:50:48 2015 UTC,"This is an impressive first sculpt, very nice, although there are alot of things you can do it get it to a higher quality.  It's difficult to crit, as a T-Rex can be open to any intrepretation, but here is a general overview of how i'd improve it.  I'll compare it to this : http://www.zbrushcentral.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=273018  Correcting the Form. I think there is too much detail yet the form isn't to scale or proportion. Eg. eyes area needs to in alot more, mouth area needs definition. Jaw needs more muscle definition.  I'd recommend building it up by blocking in bones, then muscle, then skin. At the moment it looks like fat and skin with no muscle groups.  Needs more detail on the top of skull and sides of jaw. The small brush lines under the line are too one dimensional, it needs more wrinkles/scales of different sizes.  Generally too flat, the extrusions needs to more defined (brow/under brow/nose lip.  Needs scales/wrinkles everywhere, no patches of smooth skin. Can be as simple as getting a suitable alpha and brushing over the smooth patches.  Its a great first sculpt, but I'd focus on a better overall form of the skull and more secondary details like scales/wrinkles"
3Dmodeling,3cdpvn,drbearthon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:50:39 2015 UTC,Thank you! I appreciate this. I went straight from a sphere to blocking it out and then the outer skin details.   _^
3Dmodeling,3cdpvn,BrianD_NYC,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:52:20 2015 UTC,"I'd say its too much surface detail, not enough form.  Meaning you could push the form more, get more of the surface slanting or angled or pushed or any of that.  The eye ridges are looking nice.  But if you squint and discount the eye ridges, its kind of a big blob.  But first sculpt, not bad at all."
