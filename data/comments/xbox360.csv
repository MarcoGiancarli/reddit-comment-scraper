I would never recommend any converter for playing Street Fighter, especially if you're playing online. A few frames is the difference between you starting a combo, or your opponent. I have used converters in the past, but we're talking Xbox 180 or SNES to PC. I don't remember there being a super horrid delay.  Why is it that you want to use a PS controller for 360? Just preference?"

You can pay for Live Gold if you want multiplayer, but all the media functionality and online store will work without it. The cheapest place to buy a 360 would be a used game store, who might offer an optional extended warranty. New consoles come with a 1-year warranty, unless the retailer wants to sell you an extended warranty on top of it."

xbox360,3e2oo9,justeducation,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:28:47 2015 UTC,"I am unfamiliar with that, though I get Gold through the redemption card because I heard that getting it through credit card allows Microsoft to keep auto renewing it.

xbox360,3e2oo9,gk3coloursred,2,Tue Jul 21 14:57:33 2015 UTC,"For where to buy, depends on where you are (you mention neither city, country nor continent).  If you have CEX used game stores in your country they give 1 years warranty on everything they sell.  Pretty damn good for used hardware, though you'll find cheaper machines for sale privately in your local online adverts website (without warranty)."
xbox360,3e2oo9,gk3coloursred,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:27:38 2015 UTC,CEX looks really good. So let's say I wanted to buy this: https://us.webuy.com/product.php?sku=SXB3XBOE015   Looks like the old white console. Is that the one that's super prone to the RROD?
xbox360,3e2oo9,gk3coloursred,2,Tue Jul 21 16:38:15 2015 UTC,"Older white ones were, but I can't say for sure they all were.  Depending on how low your budget is, it'd suggest trying to stretch for one of the slim machines (the black ones, 4gb or with HDD), such as this one.  They are quieter, more reliable,will last longer and have built in wifi and HDMI.  HDMI offers a massive picture quality boost over RGB/Composite if being used.  Regarding wifi, if you are planning to use it note that some, if not all, of the old-shape consoles required a wi-fi adaptor - which will weigh in at another $10-30 (making it cost the same or perhaps more than the newer and better version.  As for the hard-drives, depends on what needs you have as to what size to get.  Also remember that USB drives can be formatted by and for the 360 and attached to the 360 for game installs etc though I think it may cause issues with larger installs.  I'm not sure as I have had the HDD since day one and I mostly play on disk, with the rare install - so most of what takes up space on my HDD is updates and Games with Gold.  In the last year have filled well over half of my 250gb HDD, mostly with Games with Gold.  That said, I could easily delete 90% of that content as I am not playing it for various reasons."
xbox360,3e2oo9,gk3coloursred,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:15:56 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely get the slim version then, thanks for the advice. Does an external HDD work for on the xbox?"
xbox360,3e2oo9,gk3coloursred,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:18:34 2015 UTC,"I've never used them, but they do, as do USB pen drives.  There's an update coming, I think in late summer, which will allow for bigger drives (up to 2tb?) but the limit is lower for now.  That said, 2tb would be overkill for a new user and I'd imagine browsing a 2tb drive full of content would be slow compared to a smaller drive.  No idea what the current limit is, and I assume that internal drives are slightly faster but maybe someone else can fill you in on the pro's and cons (if any).  Also note that with the 2x case designs of xbox 360 HDD placement and required casing differs.  'Slim' drives for Slim consoles (and E models?) use internally placed HDD's and the older Arcade and Elite models have their HDD's on the side/top."
xbox360,3e2oo9,CallMeBinks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:32:55 2015 UTC,So you can't replacement the HDD on a slim? And I have a 2tb so I guess I'll have to wait for the update haha.
xbox360,3e2oo9,CallMeBinks,2,Tue Jul 21 17:38:59 2015 UTC,"The internal drives can be swapped.  With the 4gb slim it doesn't come with a HDD fitted, however one of this tyre can be fitted.  This type however will not fit due to casing and placement.  With a custom HDD case from ebay or the likes and a compatible drive (SATA I think, but am not sure) a regular computer HDD can be fitted BUT will not have the ability to play normally backwards compatible games from the original xbox as these MUST have an official HDD fitted.  Though I'm sure if you are technically minded there are unofficial ways around even this."

xbox360,3e1ahv,gk3coloursred,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:59:26 2015 UTC,Catherine would be a huge get. I'm playing through it and think it may be a little sexually risqué to make free. I really hope this means news on the Persona 5 front because I'm contemplating getting a ps4 to play that series since I like Catherine so much.   In other news this may be the catalyst to me getting a second 360. I really want to play more system link games since the honeymoon of online gaming has all but died for me.
xbox360,3e1ahv,puckpilgrimVs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:58:55 2015 UTC,"Split Screen or system link is so much more fun than online, but in terms of the logistics of getting a game (be that with strangers or  friends) online does have huge advantages.  I'll play online, but MUCH prefer local multiplayer.  Online means playing games your friends don't have, or when your friends aren't around to play - but also means putting up with squeaky shithead kids in non-kids games and having to turn off my mic to avoid swearing in kid-friendly titles."
xbox360,3e1ahv,gk3coloursred,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:32:33 2015 UTC,I'll probably keep gold as long as they are giving away games on 360. The loan thing on the One isn't enough to entice me.

I see the Gold as a negligible cost as I use the online gaming and I get the free games, though it is a shame they can't be used without Gold.  When I get a One it'll be no big change and the online saves means I can play on my saves at friends places too.  Plenty of life in the 360 yet, and a big backlog to dig into first though!"
xbox360,3e1ahv,gk3coloursred,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:23:02 2015 UTC,"I have about 40 games in my backlog. Its really nice being able to play a game and if it doesnt grab me right away then I can just put it down and pick something up. I used to think having fewer games let me experience games to the fullest. Now i think having a ton of games  means that I only play what truly interests me.   Right now that is Advanced Warfare, Max Payne 3, Catherine, GTA V and Halo 4 multiplayer. I think gaming a generation behind suits my personality well. Like you said I am building my library for when i do inevitably grab a one. The promise of backwards compatibility is definitely fueling some wreckless 360 purchases though. I'm not mad."

xbox360,3dwznf,sape21,11,Mon Jul 20 05:55:36 2015 UTC,"I am on Gold on my 360. Microsoft currently allows 360 owners to bank XBox One Games with Gold into their accounts. What this means is that Black Flag was offered as a XBox One Games with Gold download sometime back and I was able to use my 360 to claim it in my account at that point in time so when I do get my XBox One in future, it will show that I already have it and can download it for free.   As for the games on 360 itself, who knows what will come out next for its Games with Gold? If you don't already have a huge library then this is a relatively cheap way to get to play two new 360 games a month.   Furthermore, Gold also gives you greater discounts on the weekly sales.  Regarding which games will be Games for Gold,  I have noticed that they typically reveal it in the last week before the next month."
xbox360,3dwznf,justeducation,2,Mon Jul 20 06:15:26 2015 UTC,I can confirm this. I just bought an Xbox one a few days ago and it's so nice to already have a library of about 10 games thanks to the ones I've banked off GWG.
xbox360,3dwznf,NickyNichols,3,Mon Jul 20 09:45:20 2015 UTC,"Yes I don't have a library at all atm which is why I am giving Gold a serious look. I hadn't realized that they transfer to the XB1, so that is comforting to know.   GoW3 also intrigues me and I should be able to use the free trial to bank 2 games within 30 days.   My most pressing concern is signing up for a year only to have MS essentially abandon 360 users."
xbox360,3dwznf,justeducation,2,Mon Jul 20 06:54:52 2015 UTC,"I think Gold applies to your Microsoft account so once you have Gold, you hace it on both 360 and One. I'm sure someone will correct this if I'm mistaken.   Just to be sure,  360 games don't transfer over to One. What you can do is to click on the free Games with Gold offerings for One to save them to your account."

xbox360,3dwznf,BShrew,3,Tue Jul 21 02:30:06 2015 UTC,"usually in the time frame of a couple weeks early they announce the free games with gold. it's a great console and what's great is that your XBLive account transfers over to XBONE so when you upgrade, you already have it locked in. gears of war 3 was free this month, and it's been a blast playing it again. 360 is such a great console with tons of great (and now really cheap!) games. you can usually get a year of gold for around 30-40$."
xbox360,3dwznf,pathfinder35,2,Mon Jul 20 06:43:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. I primarily play games on the PC, so it's the Xbox exclusives that interest me, as well as sports games.  GoW3 is certainly something that I want to play, as well as the halo games.   Again my main concern is getting a year's sub only to be left  high and dry this late in the game."
xbox360,3dwznf,BShrew,2,Mon Jul 20 06:57:01 2015 UTC,"word on the street is that the 360 will be supported until 2016 through a quick google search. so yeah... days could be numbered. like I said though, if you plan on upgrading to a Xbone any time in the future they still release free games on that as well.... and with backwards compatibility rearing it's head it looks like a sweeter picture."
xbox360,3dwznf,pathfinder35,2,Mon Jul 20 09:14:40 2015 UTC,Yep 360 is only supported until next yr (same with ps3 I believe) but its worth getting gold if your going to upgrade. Not only to bag the free gwg on both consoles but also as they share a gold  membership
xbox360,3dwznf,Decyde,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:48:23 2015 UTC,"How is the backward compatibility going to work? I will be able to play the games I get with gold on the 360 on the One?   Also, can anyone confirm that you can only play games with gold titles on the xb1 if you have an active subscription? Ie if your sub expires can you play the games still that you have gotten for free?

xbox360,3dwznf,Decyde,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:42:32 2015 UTC,I think they mean they will only support hardware till 2016 but you can still get the games free or buy them cause its essentially free money for them
xbox360,3dwznf,CheatedOnOnce,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:10:18 2015 UTC,So what exactly will they support after 2016? Was thinking about getting a 360 again to play Halo online. Is this a waste of money if there not gonna support after 2016?
xbox360,3dwznf,SirMaximusTR,3,Mon Jul 20 23:32:26 2015 UTC,no one knows but I think it'll be exactly the same as it is now except no software updates of the OS.  They'll still give free games out and stuff for Gold.

xbox360,3dqv8a,justeducation,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:44:41 2015 UTC,Get one that is 2TB and is USB 3.  XBox 360 will not recognize anything larger than 2TB. It cannot use a 3TB drive even if you partition it.
xbox360,3dqv8a,justeducation,5,Mon Jul 20 03:53:03 2015 UTC,360 doesn't use usb 3 either.
xbox360,3dqv8a,banshoo,2,Sun Jul 19 05:08:14 2015 UTC,That was something I learnt when I was plugging thumb drives into my 360. The USB 3 thumb drives were more likely to be able to transfer data more quickly and so they would actually hit the maximum USB 2 data transfer speed. The USB 2 thumb drives were mostly transferring at below the maximum speed and end up getting the warning message that the 360 found them too slow and indeed when I played games off those they were perceivably slower.

xbox360,3dmetd,kerj,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:26:23 2015 UTC,"It feels less fluid probably because it introduces input latency/lag. A delay between your controller input and the image on the screen.  Since your TV is a HD ready TV and has a native resolution of 1366x768, selecting 1920x1080p causes the TV to downscale the image. This introduces a delay since it has to process the image. It could also be that your TV is simply not very good at downscaling an image.  This has nothing to do with interlacing. In fact, plasma and LCDs can not even display interlaced directly, so it has to deinterlace the image first if the signal is interlaced. This deinterlacing process causes a very high input latency on most TVs. In my opinion, you should NEVER select a interlaced signal for a game console, unless it's an old CRT TV.  I recommend leaving it on ""optimal resolution"". That's what your TV reports to your Xbox as the best resolution. Although 720P may be better in some cases, depending on how good the scaling is and how many options are disabled at the 1366x768 setting. Usually PC resolutions like 1366x768 put the TV in PC mode which can make some color adjustment options unavailable. It is better for latency though.  EDIT: I just realized the reason 1080P might look sharper to you might be because the PC resolution (1366x768) disables the sharpness enhancement on your TV. If you want this enhancement, the best option is to choose 720p, since that resolution is closer to your TVs native resolution. It could also be that 1080P feels less fluid because some of the artificial enhancement are enabled, which are also disabled on PC resolutions. Disable those in the menu if you want to use the 720p resolution."
xbox360,3dmetd,reerden,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:22:48 2015 UTC,"The latency/lag might be it. It just feels off somehow. I do believe ""optimal"" disables the sharpness, and I do have to switch the reference colors to ""expanded"" to get a proper black level.  I've probably gotten so used to artificial sharpening, that's really the only reason 1366x768 looks ""blurry"" to me. It's not actually blurry, I bet, and in fact games might look better now that sharpening isn't highlighting any ""flaws"".  Thanks for the thorough answer!"
