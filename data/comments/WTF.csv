WTF,3e0s56,iamshiny,3,Tue Jul 21 15:23:10 2015 UTC,"If someone has their appendix out and the develops recurring digestive issues, like diarrhea, usually a probiotic is used to balance out the gut bacteria. Probiotics are cultures of the healthy bacteria that reside in your gut.   For example, the friendly bacteria that reside in your gut have a number of very important functions, such as:  Digesting and absorbing certain carbohydrates.  Without good gut bacteria, your body cannot absorb certain undigested starches, fiber, and sugars. The friendly bacteria in your digestive tract convert these carbohydrates into primary sources of important energy and nutrients.  Producing vitamins, absorbing minerals and eliminating toxins. Probiotics help in the production of both vitamin K and B vitamins, and promote mineral absorption. They also aid in metabolism and the breakdown of toxins.  Keeping bad bacteria under control.  A large part of the influence of the ""bad"" bacteria is on your intestinal lining (mucousal barrier). Simply stated, friendly bacteria compete with the bad guys for room and board, but since beneficial bacteria are more at home there, they win most of the battles for nutrition and attachment sites within your colon.  The good bacteria tell your body how much nutrition they need and your body responds by supplying just that much and no more - so that any excess bad bacteria are starved out. The helpful bacteria also produce a substance that kills harmful microbes.  Preventing allergies.  Friendly bacteria train your immune system to distinguish between pathogens and non-harmful antigens, and to respond appropriately. This important function prevents your immune system from overreacting to non-harmful antigens, which is the genesis of allergies.  Providing vital support to your immune system.  Beneficial bacteria have a lifelong, powerful effect on your gut’s immune system and your systemic immune system as well. The bacteria play a crucial role in the development and operation of the mucosal immune system in your digestive tract. They also aid in the production of antibodies to pathogens.  However, some recent studies have shown that the appendix is more vital to maintaining your health than just being a haven for good bacteria. Over 80% of your immune system resides in your gut as well. The appendix is partly responsible for the making, directing, and training white blood cells.   Also, FUN FACT: over 70% of primate and rodent species has some form of an appendix. Australian marsupials have them as well.    Makes you wonder why we ever thought the appendix was useless..."

WTF,3e0s56,tubbytucker,4,Tue Jul 21 15:38:01 2015 UTC,"I did this ONCE. Our dog needed to have her glands expressed regularly or she go into snail mode scooting around the house leaving a nasty smelling slime on all the floors.  I normally have the groomer do this, but we just bought a house and put down the full 20%. Because of this we were couch cushion searching for our next meals  (side note, don't ever empty your entire bank account to get the 20%, it's not worth the stress, we had to switch to DSL because cable was too expensive. we were THAT broke).   Anyways I looked up the directions (very slowly) on the internet and decided ""hey this looks easy, I can do this no problem"".  So I put on some latex gloves and put my dog into the bathtub.  I explain to her that what I am doing is a MEDICAL procedure and should not be taken in any undesired context. She looked at me with uncertainty and dread.  I bathe her and follow the directions on the internet.  I slide my finger into a place on my dog I never in a million years imagined doing. I felt the giant sack of doggie snail ooze, and squeezed as instructed on the video.  NOW the video led me to believe that a thick ""slightly pungent"" liquid would slowly be squeezed from the glands.  I will tell you this right now THAT VIDEO LIED.  It lied on TWO counts.  The first was the ""slightly pungent"" part, the moment that odor hit my face I nearly vomited onto my poor dog with a finger up her ass.  The smell was akin to a thousand skunks composting in the sun with rotten eggs and the shit of a thousand bovine.  The second and possibly sinister lie from the video was the gentle ""OOZING"" of the fluid.  There was no OOZING, nor was there anything gentle.  The fluid of a thousand composting cow shit skunks exploded everywhere; it was on my chest, my chin, my arm, the walls of the bath tub, the dog and very possibly the ceiling.  No there was nothing gentle about this.  I'm sitting here gagging trying to keep my lunch down (we are broke I can't afford to waste a lunch) finger stuck up my dog’s ass covered in the cow shit skunk and all I can think is.....""I still have to do the OTHER gland"".   For the second gland I decide to cover it with a wash cloth.  Great idea but unfortunately I did not take into account the special unpredictable behavior of dog rectum fluid dynamics.  I squeeze expecting the cow shit skunk fluid to exit in a manner similar to the previous gland of death. NO NO NO this one did not explode like a flak cannon as the last one. This one decided to take the stream right into my face right over the wash cloth method.  I involuntarily gagged, but thankfully didn't eject my prized lunch. Never again, will I do this.  If I am ever that broke again I will walk around town picking up cans, beg on the street corner with a sign saying ""Need money, don't want to stick finger in dog ass"", or maybe even start a cow shit skunk composting business (as that would surly smell better and not likely explode into my face).  Leave this to the groomer and vet.  Also you should tip well, after all they just had to stick their finger up your dog’s ass and endure the wrath of the thousand skunk/cow compost.  TL:DR Exploding dog glands ruined my day"

I can go through my insurance who will replace my bumper and fix the side of my car, that's what I can do. He ignored every letter they sent him about it, so I opened one that he left in the trash. The near thousand dollar total had gone into collections and was a mark on his financial record because he refused to make contact with them.

WTF,3e0w3n,Diabetesh,30,Tue Jul 21 12:59:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, but the full story from the live show keeps on going.  You see, for a lot of things, most of the flavour goes away when you swallow it. Sure, there's rremnants and aftertaste, but it's a small amount, compared to having the thing in your mouth. Not so for blended fish-head ice-cream. The only thing achieved by swallowing was that he had more room in his mouth - all the flavour stayed.  He asked for water. Now he had fish head ice-cream all around in his mouth and all he can taste is fish.  He figured that since water didn't touch it, maybe it's fat-soluable, so he asks for some oil to rinse with. It didn't mix, so now not only can he taste fish, but there's an oily layer on top of that that's not mixing with it.  There's really only one other solvent readily used in cooking - and that's alcohol. So he asks for vodka or evercler, or something similar - no point using anything good for it. They bring him a (nicely presented) shot of vodka, and he rinses his mouth out with it, and spits.  His mouth is a little numb, but there's very little taste of fish. Success!  Until he burped.  The moral of the story - fish does not belong in ice cream.  Hopefully ninja edit: Yes, I'd try the stuff in the original link."

Besides, if we're talking about weird shit that people eat, Zimmerman (the Bizarre Foods dude) has said that far and away the worst thing he's ever eaten is Hakarl, (rotten shark meat preserved in lye) which is from Iceland  Fourth of all, by your logic you should own up to all of the weird shit your country eats/does.  Based on the ""everyone in reddit is white/male/American unless proven otherwise"" theory, I'ma hold you personally accountable for roadkill chili and peopleofWalMart  Fifth of all, you're a moron and an asshole.  Fuck off"
WTF,3e0w3n,greywolf2155,-9,Tue Jul 21 15:52:22 2015 UTC,"You're on Reddit, so it's not China,or Indonesia. Your English is passable, which means you're either an Asian American/British/Australian (which means you're not even fucking asian, and you bitching is just like when black people bitch about people talking shit about africa), Singaporean, Japanese, or Korean. (Close possibility of Thai).  Basing everything off your syntax and diction (if i'm wrong good on ya) you're Asian American. I'm also going to guess you've never actually been to asia, or if you have, it was a week or two. Let me assure you that mince fish, where the entire fish is boned and blended, and not just all tuna, but tuna salmon, shrimp, any leftovers, is VERY common and not seen as weird or gross. Live octopus isn't seen as that weird at all in korea. Same with dog in both korea in china (though it is becoming a rather heated debated in both countries, some see it as perfectly acceptable, other see it like most of the western world).  Just because other countries eat weird shit doesn't mean Asian countries don't. There is a difference between what country people who live 100's of miles away from civilization eat, and me being able to go to dongdaemun and see a pretty much full dog carcass, and live octopus restaurants.  Also: guess how many of these all come from Asia? ( a majority)  http://www.hostelworld.com/blog/the-50-weirdest-foods-from-around-the-world/158695  You're just butthurt and want to cling to a sense of culture that you don't really have."

I amend that to say that you're a judgmental moron and a self-justified asshole.  You appear to have decided that, based on what you know, and what you ""know"" about me (you missed a few possibilities though, for instance I know a number of Filipinos with very good English), your opinion is vastly superior and more well-thought out--and that that justifies racism, blanket judgment, and general douchebaggery.  Because you have the experience and facts to back it up.  Whatever  Plus you never discussed roadkill chili, I was really hoping to get a stirring defense as to how it's not weird to eat squirrel that's been run over by a truck (or Hakarl, since again assuming that you're white you should have as much connection to Iceland as I do to Kazakhstan)  Anyways, ""debating"" with you is not a very good use of my time, so I'm done.

WTF,3e0w3n,greywolf2155,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:38:00 2015 UTC,"Nope, just annoyed that the first reaction to seeing something weird is to assume its Asian. That culture is connected to us, even if we haven't lived there, as people connect the images and connotations they have of Asia and its people to the Asians living in the western world, and that is something legitimate to gripe about. Also youre just talking in circles, retreating from what you said with unrelated facts. Our problem was that we did not like that people automatically assume that weird foods are from Asia because ""weirdness"" generally reflects negatively on a culture that we are always going to be connected to whether we like it or not, and you said we shouldn't have a problem with it yet you provide no valid reasoning for why people should assume that weird foods are from Asia, and you even agree that there are weird foods from other places.

In insurance right of way is king and the car crossing the road definitely should have yielded. He'll even the car recording looked like they would have been close to hitting him too. Obviously with this dash cam we can see the cyclist speeding but that doesn't give the right to the other vehicle to just pull out into the road.

That is what the motorcyclist thought, and is the reason why they, as far as they were aware, were able to slip through and overtake.

As he was driving down it there was a Jeep Cherokee in front of him, about 20 feet between them. The speed limit is 50 down this road so they were both going at a steady speed and the Jeep driver in front of him slammed on her brakes and swerved into the middle of the road, leaving my father no room to even avoid the accident. So instead of going head first he decided to tip it and slide into it to avoid further injury. There's a bar to keep the motorcycle from crushing the driver. Anyhow, he slid 20 feet into the Jeep going about 50, his head whipped up and broke the left tail light, and his body bounced off the Jeep about 15 feet back up hill, rolling feet over head. He was unconscious for about 10 minutes, the driver of the Jeep thought he had died and called Paramedics, when he woke up she was extremely apologetic and said there was a deer. Painter's Hill is a farm land, no chance there was a deer. Even if there happened to be a deer, she was kept at fault for insurance because she shouldn't have swerved and stopped so abruptly. He was in the hospital with a few broken ribs, cracked vertebrae, and a lot of pain, scrapes, bruises, and headaches.

Every new employee is required to take a short defensive driving course during an onboarding period. They hire retired and still in service experience cops who come and talk to us about stuff. Then we get in some cars and they teach us how we can avoid shit in the road (escape routes) without flipping the car and how ABS actually work.   One of the instructors told my class a story about how 18 wheelers have a hard time seeing smaller vehicles in the rain and that's why you should have your tail lights on. He had to go to a couple of scenes to clean up because the 18 wheeler smashed into a silver car that braked really hard and the 18 wheeler didn't see him in time.  Aside from that, I've started driving with my back windows down so I can hear cars/bikers around me better. Have avoided a couple of accidents since I've started doing that."

WTF,3e14zm,MX956,5,Tue Jul 21 05:41:49 2015 UTC,indeed. If you are rear ended and in turn rear end someone else. it CAN be your fault for hitting the one in front of you. now if you are launched extremely far it wont be. but ~8-10 feet or so (at a stop).

WTF,3e14zm,MX956,4,Tue Jul 21 05:43:38 2015 UTC,Although i'm not sure how this would be handled with a motorcycle. Im thinking that with the speed of the guy behind him the bike would have gone much farther(as in it would have gone 20-30 feet without the car in front). Now he also has video of it happening so that makes it easy to see that he was a pretty reasonable distance back when he was struck. All in all I'd say the cyclist isnt at fault for the front cars damages. But it is entirely possible for a guy in the cyclists situation to be held responsible for being too close to the vehicle in front of it. I just don't think it was this time.

Having been on a swim team, after just a week of vacation, you get tired like 8x quicker than before. Kind of funky how it works, but if you just keep at swimming for about a week or two, swimming long distances ends up being even somewhat leisurely if you are not swimming quickly.   I just remember we would have an annual swim-a-thon to raise money where you would swim for an hour and a half straight with no breaks. It was actually, by far, the easiest practices and everyone looked forward to them.   Also, swim trunks weigh you down like a mofo. It feels like I'm just flailing in the water when I wear those."

It can also happens (although for lesser degree) when you are on the internet for too long. This condition is known by the public as a brain fart.

Also some of the paints used are toxic to them. The little guy would be much happier if you find him a natural shell to change in to. They also need a lot of humidity and dechlorinated plain water and marine water.  A good website to learn about their care is hermitcrabassociation.com.
WTF,3e0p2e,TennesseeGal,7,Tue Jul 21 01:38:33 2015 UTC,Upvoted for useful information for once on this sub.
WTF,3e0p2e,Zaulankris,5,Tue Jul 21 03:25:39 2015 UTC,:-). Thank you.
WTF,3e0p2e,AbsolutelyPink,4,Tue Jul 21 05:01:50 2015 UTC,"Wasn't there also something about how the painted ones are often moon shells, which are too thin-walled and the opening not round enough for purple claw hermit crabs (the kind you usually see being sold)?"
WTF,3e0p2e,TennesseeGal,9,Tue Jul 21 05:21:30 2015 UTC,"Certain types of hermit crabs like certain shells.  Some with oval openings and some with round. Please get it out of that shell.  Additionally, the crab needs moist substrate (EcoEarth mixed with play sand) 1 and 1/2 times the height of its size at minimum.  Extra shells of varying size, a tank at least 10 gallon for a crab that size as well.  Temperature around 80 and Humidity the same.  Please visit HCA  I'm also happy to answer questions, but the website is awesome."

WTF,3e0p2e,fire--starter,3,Tue Jul 21 15:51:47 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's not that bad. The hermit crab doesn't grow it's own shell. It finds one that another animal has left/died/outgrown and claims it as it's own. They sell these fancy shells at the pet stores because the crabs grow and will need new bigger shells."
WTF,3e0p2e,seafoodgar,3,Tue Jul 21 16:33:44 2015 UTC,"Do you know how they get into the shells?  they'd be ripped apart if you tried to get it out, so they chill them, forcibly remove them, and put them into shells that could still be wet with toxic paint."

WTF,3e0p2e,ManiacSpiderTrash,5,Tue Jul 21 11:38:18 2015 UTC,Actually painted shells are really bad for hermit crabs. The paint is toxic to them and it can chip off and they can eat it. And hermies eat everything.

Add to that, living in an environment that promotes this style of life, and it should come as no surprise. The media puts it out due to demand, parents let their kids be raised off their TV's without really monitoring what kinds of media they consume, and this is one of the results. A kid trying to be like the big guys he sees in all the movies and music videos surrounded by money, guns and friends.

Because he is wearing a T-shirt under the dress, he may have no sexual desire to do this and this is something he is only doing as a gag/play-time with gran-daughter/something casual. The T-shirt is actually a pretty significant indicator here. adult baby's/sissy's would have no reason to wear a regular old cotton T-shirt under their dress/whatever as it would detract from the immersion.  It does actually look like he is wearing a diaper under the pantyhose, which really throws a wrench into my theory that this man is not doing this as a fetish... However it could only be a pair of white briefs, which would support my theory.    The conclusions i've come to in this post were reached because I myself am into sissy play, so i have an eye for these things."
WTF,3dyq1t,diaperboy19,2,Tue Jul 21 15:14:45 2015 UTC,That's definitely a diaper and he's definitely a sissy.
WTF,3dyq1t,abbadus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:05:56 2015 UTC,"well if he is, then he must be just starting out. Either that or his taste in sissy-wear could use some refining.  Edit: i guess is shouldn't bash his taste, its just that as a sissy myself, i wouldn't consider his choice of wear to be the least bit arousing. Secondly, how are you so sure he is a sissy? if anything he is an adult baby, just look at all the baby bottles and baby paraphernalia . Sissy's love petticoats, and usually a matching color scheme. This mans assembly is all mismatched and looks to be thrown together haphazardly. Maybe im being too critical."
WTF,3dyq1t,diaperboy19,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:40:13 2015 UTC,"Well he's dressed as both a baby and a girl.  Not every sissy goes for lace and frills.  I indulge in a little sissy play myself and while I don't mind a little,  I don't like a ton of frills either.    Plus I'm pretty sure I've seen him in much more girly outfits on Fetlife."

People get hung up on representations (with NO respect to reality) and then can't say anything even bordering on factual.  Nobody is stoping ANY individual in the U.S. From being a fool and supporting this damned flag.  Saying do makes you a fool and a lier.  It's like gay marriage, don't like gay marriage, then don't fucking get one.   Your precious manufactured sacred ""marriage"" in not harmed in any way."

I had to do a double take and yes this car was actually rolling down a hill on fire.   I immediately stopped and got out. I ran over and the guy (only person in car) was rushing out clearly dazed from smoke inhalation as thick smoke was coming through his ac vents. I would've pulled him out if I had to but I'm glad he got out because the dashboard was in flames about 10 seconds after he got out.  He lost his brakes going down the hill so he actually was just rolling down in flames before finally ripping the E-brake and getting out just in time. I helped him move away from the burning car and called 911 and then gave him my phone to call his Dad.   Overall I was glad I could help, just yesterday I read a story about how people watched a lady in a burning car and didn't help. As soon as I saw this car fire I decided to help.

I water jetted the  main  line going out to the street and it unclogged and has been fine since. The main cause apparently most of the time is tree roots growing into and around the pipes

From Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality:   ""What's Quidditch?""  Asking this was also a mistake.

""Catching the Snitch is worth one hundred and fifty points? ""  ""Yeah -""  ""How many ten-point goals does one side usually score not counting the Snitch?""  ""Um, maybe fifteen or twenty in professional games -""  ""That's just wrong. That violates every possible rule of game design. Look, the rest of this game sounds like it might make sense, sort of, for a sport I mean, but you're basically saying that catching the Snitch overwhelms almost any ordinary point spread. The two Seekers are up there flying around looking for the Snitch and usually not interacting with anyone else, spotting the Snitch first is going to be mostly luck -""  ""It's not luck!"" protested Ron. ""You've got to keep your eyes moving in the right pattern -""  ""That's not interactive, there's no back-and-forth with the other player and how much fun is it to watch someone incredibly good at moving their eyes? And then whichever Seeker gets lucky swoops in and grabs the Snitch and makes everyone else's work moot. It's like someone took a real game and grafted on this pointless extra position so that you could be the Most Important Player without needing to really get involved or learn the rest of it. Who was the first Seeker, the King's idiot son who wanted to play Quidditch but couldn't understand the rules?"" Actually, now that Harry thought about it, that seemed like a surprisingly good hypothesis. Put him on a broomstick and tell him to catch the shiny thing...  Ron's face pulled into a scowl. ""If you don't like Quidditch, you don't have to make fun of it!""  ""If you can't criticise, you can't optimise. I'm suggesting how to improve the game. And it's very simple.

So you can adapt the designs to different animals without too much drama, but you would need to rebuild all the transfer parts that contact to match your new animal size/shape and ensure you have enough range in your cutting tools.  You can imagine that even rib rack lengths can vary dramatically when you change animals.  The vision systems were still in their infancy when I was there.  We were primarily using lasers to show and check cut lines at that point.  The financial drivers were consistency of product and savings in meat weight over more manual methods.  A good butcher is faster, but not every butcher is a good one."

That left a whole lot of people out of a job. I used to make extra money taking extra shifts doing data entry for temp services. Most data entry type applications are now done by the end user on their phone or home pc or the data is mined automatically via various apps. These types of jobs were whole industries which no longer exist and this type of automation will only improve.   There is no doubt in my mind the jobs you mentioned will not exist in 20-30 years.

WTF,3dw63h,_demetri_,19,Mon Jul 20 03:09:25 2015 UTC,"Rebecca O'Connor took care of her grandfather since she was 12 years old, who was blind and suffered with a bad case of diabetes. When she barely graduated high school, her abusive father persisted on her not attending college so she can continue to tend to him while he continues smoking crack and disappears from time to time, to Rebecca's relief. But she made a promise to herself that she would be a normal girl, become a normal woman like her friend Stacy and Yasmine, who continued on to college. She would call them when she had her prepaid phone, and she didn't have things like Facebook and stuff online because she didn't have internet and she couldn't really post anything that made her happy. Though pretty she just spent all her time using the money she made at the grocery store down the street to tend to her grandfather, whose social security and disabilities paid for the housing, and she used water little money she had left shopping in places like Rainbow and Flavor just to maybe find someone who may love her enough to not even take her away from this life she was living, but to just help...  His name was Rico Vasquez and he saw her one day while she was taking usual walk from work after she locked up to her small 1 bedroom home, and he followed her a lot longer than she noticed. But when she did see him giving her interested glances, she got so overwhelmed and elated that she read nothing into how he was just watching her from across the street, not closing their gap. Rebecca eventually got to her home, and hesitated to enter hoping he'd come maybe say something, but he just stood therefrom across the street staring... So she just entered her home, and quickly went to go help her grandfather with his diner.  Just as Rebecca was putting her father into bed, there was a knock on the door. In her mind she was still thinking of the man that followed her the same way a person thinks of the one time they found money on the ground as a child. She finished tending to him and went to the door.  He was standing there. Rebecca hesitated, her stomachs fluttering as she says hello. He responds with a hello back, in that way where someone is trying far too hard to sound pleasant and appropriate, yet Rebecca noticed none of it. He said he noticed her walking home the same way for a few weeks now and thought she was one of the most gorgeous woman he has ever seen. Rebecca was at a loss for words, as she pictured her new life unravel before her. She began to feel this ease off her shoulders as if maybe it will get easier, maybe she can work less and feel like a normal girl. He told her his name was Rico and if she wanted to go out to the local bar for the night, which she replied okay, if she just can get ready really quickly which he said sure. She ran back inside and got what she thought to be her nicer clothes, one of said items being Yasmine's old moccasins she gave her, and she left the house. They walked together as she was in a completely new dimension. Her nerves quickly took over her, she just wanted it to work, she wanted to believe this is real, so she kept rather quite as Rico persistently just side glanced at her. When they got to their local bar, another couple was sitting way to their right, but besides that they were alone and started on drinks.  Rebecca had never drank before, but she could keep down every variety of drink Rico persistently ordered, ushering closer and closer to her as the night went on. She reached a point where she just didn't care about what she was saying, and she started to think of anything to tell him. Her father and her grandfather, and even Yasmine and Stacy who were on their way to bigger better things, that she just couldn't reach. At around 1 am Rico grabbed her by the wrist and guided her out of the local bar and together they walked and walked and walked, Rebecca losing feeling on her left hand, feeling the spring air blow her long, normal brown girl hair.  Rico showed her his car far into the woods not very far away from her home. She actually caught a glimpse of it in the very very distance, as he lay Rebecca on her stomach on the trunk. Rebecca tripped on a woman's high boot that was on the ground and thought about how beautiful she would look with a pair on, maybe Yasmine and Stacy would actually say that any man would be a fool not to have her. She felt her jumper rip from the back, she heard the buttons bounce off the metal trunk, as she felt his hand push her face towards the cold dewy metal. She smelt something horrid, like that one time she found a dead squirrel stuck in the fence of her backyard, but the smell was oddly different, coming from either under the car or in the trunk.  She felt a sharp hot pain in her lower back, and screamed a short scream stopped by a grip to the mouth, then a violent punch to her temple. She phased in and out of awareness, with each thrust of Rico raping her, she thought of a big house with a dog and the mailman who knows her by name, and her friends living next door and her degrees hanging over the wall on the way up the stairs to her large bedrooms, and each burst of pain, she moaned thinking it was all normal, this is normal, sometimes it gets like this. Once the pounding stopped and he ran a blade across her throat, she thought she was throwing up. It was what girls felt when they went out, like all the stories Yasmine and Stacy tell her of what they do. ""Oh I held her hair over the toilet! She felt a burning in her throat and just puked her face off..."" That's what's happening to me, Rebecca though, it's all part of her change, part of this miracle man, who was going to change everything for her. As he opened the trunk to reveal some other woman wearing only one beautiful red boot, a Valentine's Day card, some pills, and ripples of old mysterious stains, Rebecca choked up her last image of her new Heaven as her head slammed forward, and the trunk was slammed closed."

WTF,3dv3mb,beefsupreme13,0,Mon Jul 20 18:31:24 2015 UTC,That is an entirely different argument.  Belief is based on faith because it is unsubstantiated by fact.  Therefore to believe in anything theistic/deistic disqualifies one from being an atheist.  Whereas nihilist specifically believe that there is nothing after life.  They have faith that their belief is fact.  They make a positive claim that there is nothing beyond this experience.  Atheists make no claims.  They make zero assertions about what happens next because we can't believe in something without compelling evidence of that thing.

Up above was a large flock of birds, ranging from Sparrows to the occasional hawk. All gathered for one purpose.  ""Loud and Clear, Chirp Three""  The reply echoed in his ear, and he chirped his message.  ""Copy. No Sign of the Target yet."" Some brief hesitation, and then ""Are you sure we can do this?""  The response from Delta Flock was almost irritated in tone, ""Chirp Three, I assure you we have gathered the finest flock this side of the hemisphere. We're all just waiting to strike. Focus on your part.""  Taking a hop and continuing to scrutinize the surrounding damp earth, the Sparrow bobbed its head as it accepted the advice.  ""Roger... hang on Alpha Flock, I think I see something""  Some wet clumped earth shifted and the Sparrow hopped closer, curiously.  ""Alpha Flock, are you seeing this?""  The response from above was brief. Clipped in tone, even. ""We have no visual of target off of you, Chirp Three.""  Realizing that the Flock above was currently useless, the intrepid scout Sparrow hopped closer. Almost on the shifting earth now. Clouds above, that rain had really made the ground soggy.  ""Yeah, I guess you're right. I just saw this and thou*""  With a furious roar a huge beast, the target, burst from the ground. It was thick around the middle as any Hawk, and Alpha Flock heard a startled cheep and the snapping of hollow bone. Then rushing earth and the hushed static of a lost signal.  High above the ground, the Flock held silence for a long moment. Just a moment though, and then a sparrow broke that silence.  ""Oh Shit! Guys I think he's dead!""  A Parrot a few lengths off its right wing responded with amusement, ""Of course he is! That monster eats birds all the time!""  Silence broken the entire Flock burst into laughter. Occasionally a burst of something understandable would find its way through the raucous squawking.  ""Holy Shit I can't believe he fell for it!""  ""Alpha Flock?! I almost lost my shit right then!""  ""Oh shit! He never saw it coming!""  After a few moments a large hawk let out a piercing cry, gathering the attention of the Flock.  ""What you all just saw. Lets all remember why it happened. That Sparrow forgot what it means to be a member of this flock, which is why he got that mission! Never forget!""  The final shrill cry from the Hawk was answered by chirps from every beak in the air, ""Never forget the pecking order!"".    I'm so sorry Reddit. I just couldn't help myself."

That might take like 2-4 weeks, which is probably a few million right off the bat in lost revenue (Qantas for example, earns ~$1.215M per flight at ~78% capacity on a single A380), and that's not even factoring in parts and labour (the ribs in an A380's wing are something like ~$200k a piece, and there are 23 per wing)."

My grandmother and great grandmother on my mom's side all lived to be well into their 90's and they didn't have dementia. They died of old age. My mom doesn't have Alzheimer's though. She has Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus. Basically it's fluid on the brain. The fluid build up causes the brain ventricles to enlarge and this presses up against the nerves, killing them off. I'm sure she also has plaque build up in her brain as well. My mom is 85 and doesn't have long to live. She went downhill two weeks ago and never recovered. Two weeks ago my mother was able to at least hold her head up and talk. Now she can't. All she does is sleep and if she is awake two hours out of 24, that's a lot. I have to wake her up to feed her and even then she falls back asleep.   Dementia is a terrible disease as you well know and when my mom got sick six years ago it literally tore my family apart. My five siblings cut all ties with me and my mom and no one has contacted us since. I will never forgive them.  Why are you taking care of your grandmother and not her own children?"

When my siblings discovered that my mother was getting confused and it wasn't safe for her to live alone in her house any longer, they all bailed. I lived about 35 miles from my mom then (six years ago) so my sisters all decided it would be me to take care of her. Not one of them have ever sent my mom a birthday card, Christmas card or Mother's Day card in all those years. What pisses me off is the fact that none of my sisters and brother held down a job. Their spouses provided for them. I was forced to take an early retirement from my job as an artist (Seaworld) to take care of my mother and when I did, I lost my house to foreclosure. I lost my house, my husband (no loss there), my four dogs, my Jeep, a new Harley and I had to sell almost everything I had to make ends meet.

WTF,3dsojg,Pesty63,148,Sun Jul 19 05:46:47 2015 UTC,"Late reply, I know, but I had this condition for 5+ years so I know a thing or two about it. It is a fungal growth which is particularly resilient to external medications.   I did not have health insurance during that time and I was regularly unemployed, so everything I tried was DIY.   I regularly chipped away at the nail and cleaned out underneath with anything that I thought would kill the infection (hydrogen-peroxide, isopropyl alcohol, iodine, sprays for foot infections, etc). These attempts resulted in nothing more than temporary relief as the fungal growth would always return within weeks. What I later found is that I was simply removing some of the growth. The fungus was rooted at a deeper level. Short of removing layers of flesh and nail bed, these treatments were having little to no impact on the condition.   I found various solutions/ointments sold for this purpose which had no effect. One of these was tea tree based, another I don't recall.   Eventually I started reading online medical journals about these types of cases. I read hundreds. Nearly every one resulted in a prescription for ""Lamisil tablets"". This is an anti-fungal, which taken internally, fights the fungus from the inside. It is harmful for your liver and is not recommended for anyone with existing liver conditions or who consumes a lot of alcohol.   It is a prescription drug so a doctor would need to be consulted. When I did this I managed to find an online pharmacy which sold it to me without a prescription (the package came from China IIRC).   I took one tablet a day until the bottle was empty (as the medical journals generally suggested) and the fungus gradually went away. That was 6 years ago and I barely remember ever having the problem to begin with.   Hope this is helpful."
WTF,3dsojg,Kuriente,23,Sun Jul 19 12:37:43 2015 UTC,I second that. It's fungus. Get something that kills it and the nail(s) will slowly recover.

WTF,3dsojg,ru3,134,Sun Jul 19 07:16:33 2015 UTC,"No.   The nail is always growing, so anything which isn't being constantly produced--anything singular--falls off.  For her condition, it's constantly producing more cheese.  If you carefully cleaned it out, you would have exactly what you'd think: a cave, probably reasonably stable on top in terms of crush resistance, but inevitably she'd snag that nail on something while walking barefoot, and rip it halfway off, with a lot of blood, and then have to remove it all the way.    Then there'd be a raw torn nail bed, which would be sensitive for a week or so, before the keratin started to accumulate.  Something quite similar to the Combos cheese cave will grow back within a few months.  BTW, just tearing the nail all the way out doesn't help either; it takes a while to start from scratch, and the new nail it produces will probably be kinda wonky and mutilated, but the only way to stop it completely is to dig back under the skin where the nail starts, and use something like acid, or excavating physically, to destroy the ""nail matrix"", the cells which actually pump out the nail material at the very start.  Source: had stuff like this happen with both of my big toes, lived with the aftermath for years now.  Had the doc destroy the nail matrices--he thought--but he underestimated their resilience.  What I have now is ... something that shouldn't be.  Brundlenails.  Only on the big toes."

There's no fucking way that over 90% of the people that download this are ever going to make in a fraction of the asking price off all their projects combined in a year. Most won't even make a dime.

WTF,3dtfru,warmpoptart,7,Sun Jul 19 09:14:22 2015 UTC,"I disagree I think software like this having a torrent likely helps the company in the long run.  No one is going out and buying this for personal use, it is to costly for a person just to play with at home.Anyone using it for work is buying the license because it isn't worth losing a business over a lawsuit.  I haven't used this particular program but I am guessing like most suite software of this caliber you wont be very good with it just watching a youTube video. So you need people practicing and likely even going to school for it. In order to get companies to want to use it there has to be people to use it and generate quality products from it. None of that will happen if people aren't familiar with the product.   There maybe a small group that falls in the section of possible clients who could buy the software but don't because they pirated it but I bet the sales based on its familiarity more than make up for it. I would relate it to advertising. Sure the few lost customers are an expense but the gains probably outweigh any other marketing technique in return on investment here."

If you were running a large production facility, then it MIGHT be worth it.  I think the best approach is to buy bundles that fit your specific needs. Especially if you don't have to write in every genre, like I do.   Software pirating sucks because if this was a piece of hardware it would be RIDICULOUSLY expensive, and the pirates have no clue the value of what they are stealing. They really don't give a fuck about those who are trying to develop these tools. If they ever saw the cost of development, maybe they would understand why they cost so much.  Oh, forget it... They won't. In my experience pirates really don't give 2 fucks and will give me some line like 'I'll buy it when I have money'  Yeah, sure you will.  Best part of this all is that you could learn your craft, buy Logic Pro X or Live or whatever and for a relatively low price get a professional product. They have great effects right out of the gate, and you don't need a bunch of specialized plugins to get started.   It doesn't matter how good a 1176 FET compressor simulation is if you don't even know what 'Ratio', 'Threshold', or 'Gain Reduction' means.  I love it when I get questions about plugins and find that these folks don't even know what they have. Believe me. I have spent plenty of money to get my studio together, and EVERY decision was deliberate. Every plugin has a purpose.

I started working on myself, diet and exercise, and I'm liking myself more in any type of clothing.  I've been dressing up fully for almost a year. The clothes seen though on reddit are just the sexy ones.  A majority of the clothes I have are just everyday wear, but the modest dress isn't sexy enough for a post.   As for the sharing? It's a way for me to safely get attention while still being a hermit at home. I haven't made any money off my lifestyle, I just keep a strict budget.

WTF,3dqy3e,IRNobody,8,Sun Jul 19 12:05:49 2015 UTC,"You've got a lot of down votes at the time of my writing this and I don't know why. I read the source you cited and you are right -- it seems inaccurate to say that most homeless people have mental health problems.  My gut tells me this: People hear ""homeless"" and they think of beggars on the subway, dudes in dirty clothes with cardboard signs, guys living in a box under a bridge. Perhaps ""most"" of those have mental health issues but a large portion of the homeless population are ordinary, healthy, people in extraordinary circumstances. 50% of people in shelters every night are families. That site has a lot more facts and information as well."

WTF,3dqy3e,IRNobody,2,Sun Jul 19 13:52:24 2015 UTC,"I think the reason people take comfort in that is that they want to distance themselves from the possibility of ever personally experiencing the same fate.

WTF,3dqy3e,heiferly,-1,Sun Jul 19 14:24:34 2015 UTC,"they don't have to face the reality that it's something that could happen to them.   Eh, I think it has more to do with a belief that homeless people either put themselves in that situation or are there as the product of extremely bad, internal, provable faults, such as mental disorders. They put it on the extremes. There are people in the middle who just have depression, anxiety, or other hard-to-live-with problems though, and that's a legitimate problem; they want jobs, and they do need help."

WTF,3dqfxe,tehgr8supa,18,Sat Jul 18 18:34:30 2015 UTC,There's a bold line between mistake and negligence.    There are thousands of children in the city I live in who are apprehended by the police for negligence every year. One baby I saw was left in his crib for days with a bottle of spoiled milk while his mom was out drinking.   I've met four year olds who know how to use the stove to cook dinner because they are always fending for themselves while the grown ups are high on meth.   If you talked to a police officer or social worker about this they could probably recalibrate your sense of what is and isn't negligence.
WTF,3dqfxe,universl,20,Sat Jul 18 19:53:48 2015 UTC,"Negligence isn't a binary value.  On a sliding scale of negligence this does not rank as highly as leaving your child alone in unsanitary conditions and going out boozing, but definitely ranks somewhere on the scale."
WTF,3dqfxe,Raenryong,6,Sat Jul 18 21:21:18 2015 UTC,"I'm a social worker and I have had to remove kids from their homes due to parental negligence. One case that stands out in particular...I had to take custody of a 4 & 5 year old who could only talk in grunts, were eating out of the garbage can, and had been tied up outside their trailer for hours on end while their mother went who knows where. It was very hard to put aside the bad taste in my mouth after that.  There is a pretty wide array of negligence, whether the kids' caregiver is neglectful intentionally or is unable to take care of them, it all has the same effect on kids.   Intentional neglect means they're lazy or don't care, aren't ready or willing to be a parent, they withhold basic necessities just to punish their kid, etc. An inability is usually due to mental illness, drug addiction or other impairments. The caregiver is so incapacitated that even if they wanted to, kids are too demanding for that caregiver to cope with their needs. I see it neglect happening most often in families with parent(s) who aren't taking care of themselves, which then radiates out to their kids.  Either way, a broad view of negligence is when a child's needs are not being met, food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and education. But there are so many other situational factors that play into that, it is very complex.   So tl:dr  neglect is multi-faceted and far too common."

How quick they are to want to criticize and express a hatred or rage about an observation they've made. Why are people like this? Why can't they realize that we're all capable of doing things that others may not agree with. We make mistakes, we make poor choices, sometimes we act before we think.

I had to remove it because the new nail was catching up to it. Ripping that piece off slowly wasn't fun.  I guess the point is, take care of your nails! It will hurt like a bitch otherwise."

WTF,3drna7,TudorGothicSerpent,32,Sat Jul 18 20:43:59 2015 UTC,"Onychogryphosis.  It's an abnormal thickening of the nail, sometimes caused by injury or vascular disease, and sometimes by neglect.  It can also be congenital, especially on the small toe, where it's fairly common (I actually have congenital onychogryphosis there, and have for my entire life)."

WTF,3drna7,TudorGothicSerpent,3,Sun Jul 19 06:43:29 2015 UTC,"Onychogryphosis is actually pretty hard to treat once it happens.  Some cases happen when someone doesn't clip their nails, but most (normal) cases come from unusually restrictive shoes causing thickening and odd growth of the nail.  Because the nail thickens, it becomes difficult to cut.  In most cases, the nail has to be outright removed.  The most extreme cases are often congenital, though, especially when they affect the hand."

WTF,3drna7,TudorGothicSerpent,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:36:32 2015 UTC,I don't think that the nail bed could unless maybe someone had a mutation that affected where it started to begin with.  The best that I can figure out is that maybe the nail's thickened to the point where it looks like it's growing from a point further back on the finger.
WTF,3drna7,Yuuichi_Trapspringer,3,Sun Jul 19 14:19:10 2015 UTC,"Look at the thumbs in the picture, the way it looks is the nail is growing out of the full length of the thumb and including some of the wrist.  The index finger also seems to split off into 2 different ends that went wildly divergent directions.    So I'm pretty sure this is fake, some sort of art project or some shiz about some twisted statement about beauty or the artist making herself as useless and helpless as possible.  If that is an actual medical condition, this person cannot bend their fingers at all and would have to have all bodily functions taken care of for them by assistants"

The normal ratio of water to syrup is 5 to 1. So a 5 gallon bag of syrup (640 oz) would yeald 3,840 oz of finished soda. Roughly costing around 0.013$ per oz, or costing the theater around .83$ per half gallon. At my theater it is around 5 bucks for a 24 oz soda, so the markup for the 64 oz would put it up at (rounded up) 13.50. The theater pays .83$, you pay 13.50$ The theater is making around 1526.5% profit off of your diabeetus. Give or take the actual cost of the syrup and whatever the cost of the soda actually is."

WTF,3dqjtm,AAA1374,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:32:04 2015 UTC,"The CO2 is also a factor. Not a huge one, I've never seen them replaced, but still a factor.  But you also have to look at it like this.  Movie theaters make practically no money from the box office- most of that goes back to the producers and investors that make those wonderful films happen. Very little of it goes back to the theater, which means we have to make all the profits, maintain the premises, and pay all the employees with either what little we get from the box office, or with what we can get from concessions.  So now you see, we have to get money from concessions. But the question is then, why make it so expensive?  Well, yes we don't necessarily have to make it so expensive, but you have to see it through here. You know that not everyone is going to pop in and grab a drink, some people just don't want something with their movie- no judgment. It's all well and good, but we can safely say that 10%-15% of people probably aren't gonna grab something- instead choosing to go straight to the movie.  So now you have to make 95% of your money off of 85%-90% of your customers. So the price has to go up.  Now factor in the cost of all the supplies to begin with, and you see why shit gets so damn bad for pricing.  But that's not 100% of the reason, oh no, that would be too simple.  You see, they still increase the price for no reason. That's right, we increase prices sometimes just because corporate said to. Just for the money.  So yes, there is some legitimate concern to be had with the prices being from a place of wanting too much money, but there is also a legitimate and completely not terrible reason, too.  Please don't complain to us by the way, we just sell it. It's not up to us, and many of you guys know that, but there are seriously only a few basic things you have to do to make our job 1000x easier, and one of them is not complaining about the price."

I have two friends who have it; one is in her late 20s, the other just turned 40; both weigh no more than 70-75 pounds.  The older of the two has two children, one a teenager.  She doesn't drive, but everything in her part of the city is within bus or walking distance so every day since they've been infants and since, she pushes strollers, walks miles daily to run errands, and manages to stay status-quo weight and health wise (for the most part).  But to see what they go through just to exist and then to live as normal lives as possible is intense.  it breaks my heart that my friend doesn't have a single family picture with her children; she won't allow herself to be photographed because she is so self conscious of the way she looks.  I've tried on a few occasions to ask if she would even consider posing in one with them if I or another close friend took it, just so she could have it for herself, but she doesn't even want her kids to look back later and see her that way.

WTF,3dru31,Gleeful_Weasel,8,Sun Jul 19 19:07:15 2015 UTC,I'd be very suspicious that she actually has anorexia. SMA Syndrome and gastroparesis are common adverse effects of chronic anorexia. Also she was a model and at her healthy weight only had a BMI of 20.1. Even with SMAS people should gain weight with enteral tube feeds and in my experience treating patents with eating disorders if they fail to gain weight with tube feeds it is because they are not actually taking them.

WTF,3dphqm,msobelle,23,Sat Jul 18 05:19:34 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. I'd never really stopped to think about the fact that such a large population could know so little about the Holocaust. I seem to recall reading that India had more than 2 million soldiers fight in various theaters of the war, but I also know there were movements of independence from the British Crown and a little collaboration with Axis powers going on, as well. I'm sure it's all more complex than I'm aware and that there are probably many reasons why knowledge of the Holocaust is limited in India.  Is it related to the education system, political difference, or something else entirely?"
WTF,3dphqm,the_spicy_wookie,46,Sat Jul 18 06:50:27 2015 UTC,"Well, knowledge of India's history is limited in American schools. Knowledge of the controversial stuff Indira Ghandi did is not taught. Japan's Rape of Nanking wasn't part of my high school curriculum. It just depends on where your focus is."
WTF,3dphqm,msobelle,9,Sat Jul 18 06:58:18 2015 UTC,"That's true — in high school, the amount of Indian history that was taught didn't extend much farther than its British colonial era and the East India Trading Company. And for American high school students, I can understand that much more detail wouldn't serve a huge benefit — there's only so much kids that age can be expected to learn about other countries' histories.  And the revisionism issue makes sense, too. Japanese children probably aren't taught about Japan's actions in Nanking for the same reason American children aren't taught about the genocide of the Native Americans — they're ugly and embarrassing parts of nation's histories. But they should still be taught and not sugar-coated.  I guess what confuses me is why the major events of WW2, the Holocaust and what Hitler was responsible for isn't widely known in a country like India. I know there are plenty of great schools and very smart people in India, and that this isn't exclusive to India. There are other countries where that chapter of history is glossed over.  Plus, it was only 70 years ago. And it involved such a massive proportion of the world's population that it's difficult to find people that weren't affected even if it was a tiny bit. Granted, Hitler was a dirtbag and part of me thinks he deserves never to be mentioned again — someone that rotten deserves to be forgotten forever — but at the same time, I think there's truth to the notion that those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.  I think the majority of my surprise comes from the fact that what Hitler did had such a huge negative impact and it was less than a century ago — the world needs to be taught about and collectively continue to condemn Hitler for a long time, lest we let history repeat itself, not use his visage to sell ice cream."
WTF,3dphqm,the_spicy_wookie,26,Sat Jul 18 16:25:43 2015 UTC,"Most portrayals of WW II in the west make the Western allies out as some kind of lily white heros, and the Axis powers as super villains. This narrative does not fly in India simply because  what the British did to India was nearly as bad. Further, while the axis committed nearly unspeakable atrocities during the war, the unjust system of colonialism, preferential trading etc. which led to the great wars was very much a system put in place by the allies. France did not vacate her colonies until she was physically thrown out in the 60s! What the Belgians did in Africa was as bad as what Hitler did in Europe. What the British did in India, South Africa was pure perfidy.  The 'super villains' in India are the imperialists who put this racial system in place, where people of one race or country with better weapons could enslave others. Hitler merely brought this system to its logical conclusion by trying to do in Europe what the imperialists had already done in Africa and Asia. Why should Indians adopt British and American goggles when looking at history?  Current attitudes in India about Hitler and the fascist regimes are not adulatory, they are similar to what your attitudes might be to Chengiz Khan, also a great murderer of his time. Despicable, completely unacceptable, but not 'one whose name shall not be taken'. His crimes, while done on an unmatched scale, were more or less the crimes of colonialism.  So Westerners getting all 'high and mighty' about Indian attitudes need to get rid of their adulatory attitudes towards Colonialism, their Churchill busts and King Leopold stuff, enshrined in the mainstream of their culture before they get concerned about some random, silly picture on ice cream cones."
WTF,3dphqm,RrrahmanRrrahim,2,Sat Jul 18 16:50:12 2015 UTC,"Certainly didn't mean to come across ""high and mighty"" – I definitely don't have any love for the ideals of colonialism or imperialist governance. It isn't right, regardless of the name its given.  And I can absolutely appreciate the strong feelings that come along with foreign occupation and rule, especially for as long as India was colonized by Britain. Again, not defending hundreds of years of imperialism – not right at all.  What I'm really curious about, however, is how Hitler is portrayed in Indian culture. I think I recall reading that his likeness is also used pretty freely in Indonesia due to many people not being familiar with his role in history – he's just another historical figure.  So is the usage of his likeness in India a product of not fully knowing his role in the war, or do Indians not see him as being as ""bad""? I'm sure that British figures like Churchill are seen very negatively and held responsible for many deaths in India, so I'm curious where Hitler ranks.  For Westerners like myself, we were brought up being taught that Hitler was responsible for 6 million deaths, Stalin was responsible for many millions more, yet the countless Native Americans we killed on our way west to achieve ""manifest destiny"" go completely unmentioned. So I realize that vilification of historical figures can be very subjective and regional....I just like learning different perspectives, so I apologize if any of this seems obtuse."
WTF,3dphqm,the_spicy_wookie,6,Sat Jul 18 18:49:03 2015 UTC,"Oh I am sorry, my 'high and mighty' wasnt directed at you, but at some gasps of horror that many western people emit when they see that Hitler isnt the symbol of pure evil and is not hated as much as he is in the west.     What I'm really curious about, however, is how Hitler is portrayed in Indian culture.     He is not. I cant really recall anything in popular culture that has anything to do with Hitler at all. This also means that occasionally, people do stuff that would be in very bad form in the west - like putting his face on an Ice cream cone packet.. :-D  In the west, Hitler personifies evil in the dichotomy between good and evil, while in India, that dichotomy is between the freedom fighters and the British. This doesnt mean that Indians think he is a good guy at all..      I'm sure that British figures like Churchill are seen very negatively and held responsible for many deaths in India   Actually, come to think of it, even the Brits are not vilified as much as Hitler is in the west. There is a 'they taught us English' and 'railways' meme.      For Westerners like myself, we were brought up being taught that Hitler was responsible for 6 million deaths, Stalin was responsible for many millions more, yet ..   These dudes were pretty nasty pieces of work, but what I dont understand is the pretense that their evil just arose out of nothing or at best came about because the Czar was a douche and the allies over reached in Versailles. What is missing is, that if you organize the world on the basis of racism and conquest, eventually you will run out of places to conquer and races to subjugate and then you will not have anyone else to conquer but your neighbor. To me, Hitler came about because of British wickedness and yet, when you read history, they come out as 'the good guys'. Hitler wasnt the first to invade foreign countries, he wasnt the first to decide if people deserved to live or not on the basis of race, he wasnt even the first to put europeans in concentration camps - that honor goes to Victoria in the Boer war.. He was just the apotheosis of the race and conquest based European culture at the time."

WTF,3dphqm,Whorethag,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:41:56 2015 UTC,"Congratulations. I payed attention, too. But 20 years ago when I was in high school, it was glossed over. We were taught about ""westward expansion"" in a vague and heroic sense – that Lewis and Clark were the leaders and trailblazers of a peaceful migratory expansion. And the Indian Relocation Act of 1830 was taught from a perspective of the U.S. doing the Native Americans a favor by ""giving them their very own land to live on"". What wasn't taught were the thousands of people who were killed or died along the way during the process of 'relocation', the Army raids that killed, wounded or displaced countless more, or the enslavement and buying and selling of Native Americans as property.  Maybe your school did a better job of not whitewashing history and gave you a more complete understanding of the brutal tactics that the U.S. used to achieve its ends – and that's great, well-done to your school. Mine, however, taught from a curriculum that swept much of that unpleasantness under the rug or didn't mention it at all.

The fire has, so far, destroyed up to 20 vehicles on this highway.  News article at http://ktla.com/2015/07/17/15-freeway-shut-down-in-cajon-pass-due-to-30-acre-north-fire/ (warning: autoplays a video)  The reasons that there're cars just parked on the highway in the burnpath are twofold: one, cars slow down when it gets smoky, causing the already slow Cajon Pass to become even slower, and two, the fire quickly rushed the pass, leaving little time for firecrews and DoT to help the people in the path."
WTF,3dr52j,Randoodle,2,Sat Jul 18 17:42:13 2015 UTC,I grew up going down the pass all the time. I know right where they're at. Fire is nothing new to that area. Many times the highway really helped fires get under control because they couldn't jump the road.  Growing up in southern California the scariest thing I could think about burning would be a city like big bear. It's super dry forest and if it took off it'd be so hard to put out. It's almost burned before in the past too. It's the mountain back road if you didn't wanna take the pass.

It was always petty shit like someone's phone going off during shift or supervisors catching wind that someone was talking too loudly/interacting with other production lines.  If you ratted the person out they were in a very real position to lose their job over something insignificant and stupid.  You'd have to either be ignorant of the rules or a real piece of shit to do that.  Hoping to take advantage of that because you're incompetent at your own job (supervisors/management) is deplorable.

I admit it's a bit overwhelming getting into it at first and it takes a little while to find what suits you. I know how you feel except for the nausea.    Usually retailers are extremely helpful though. Definitely speak to them about the nausea.  It seems to indicate too high of a dose of nicotine or maybe a reaction to the flavor.   For flavors I recommend to stick with a mild tobacco flavor and eventually mix a bit of vanilla, coffee or caramel to sweeten the deal. You can mix directly in the ecig reservoir as you fill up.

If you smoke the e-cig the same amount as you smoked cigarettes (meaning not more than), you've already dropped nicotine consuption by between 60-80%.  As someone who quit smoking, I can say with confidence that the biggest hurdle to overcome in quitting is stress management.  Most smokers are used to using smoking as a way of mitigating stress, and have gotten so used to it that smoking is a stress reflex.  Before you start quitting, develop strong stress handling habits such as meditation or exercise. If you can make something like that your go-to for stress, you will be shocked how much easier it is to quit.  Best of luck!"

About a year in, my old manager for promoted up into corporate and some woman got hired because she was a friend of another manager in our district. This woman had been a manager of a KFC, however it became abundantly clear that she was fucking incompetent not long after she started working there.   You would think there would be some transferable skills, right? People management, scheduling, inventory... That stuff shouldn't be too different between chicken and coffee, but surprisingly for the two years she worked there she never got any of that right. We were constantly out of product and our schedules were ridiculous. The only time she paid any attention to scheduling was when she was mad at someone and wanted to make them miserable by making them close the night before and then open, or work split shifts all a week, or other vindictive bullshit.   Another sign she was completely unfit for the job was that she basically never made us do any cleaning, ever. Never assigned it, never scheduled for it, never told anyone to do it and didn't train people for it. At first this wasn't so bad but she fired half of the store to try and weed out all the people who knew how incompetent she was, and all the new people didn't even know our old cleaning procedures.   At one point when we finally DID get inspected we got down garlanded to a B.   One thing that happened that was fitting for this subreddit is that we have a machine called a ""sure-shot."" The sure-shot dispensed Frappuccino mix into pitchers and kept it refrigerated. This machine was supposed to be cleaned thoroughly every day, and emptied out at the end of the night, and once a week it was supposed to be broken down and deep cleaned.   This didn't happen for months.   And the metal plate on the bottom of the inside refrigerated area began to swell and bulge up into the machine, until one day it expanded until the caulked seal opened up, revealing a small dark hole that smelled bad.   I worked a shift sometime after the hole appeared and the people I was working with were old-crew, so we decided to finally deal with the sure-shot, since we figured it must not have been cleaned for maybe 9 months.   I started spraying ""Spirit,"" a bleach cleaner, inside the machine, and as I sprayed the interior, I noticed the hole and sprayed a shitload of Spirit in there.   About 10 seconds later maggots began to flood out of the hole, covering the inside of the machine and falling out onto the counter. My coworker vomited.   Long story short, corporate came and took that machine away. And they sent experts in to retrain our manager on cleanliness standards. Then she fired my friend who had reported the issues with the machine... And the maggots."

Like it's just wild that HIV treatment progression and cultural progression add to the whole bug chasing thing. There's just such a myriad of reasons that people participate in that subculture, but all seem so odd for me.   I think the folks that scare me the most out of the whole thing are those that lie, manipulate, or rape to spread HIV or whatever they have.

WTF,3dmcmq,Capn_Ratch,84,Fri Jul 17 14:44:50 2015 UTC,"Using three 2x6 Lego bricks, one green/blue/red for a pixel, each pixel would be 4.8cm length and width.   The 4k image would be 18432cm long, or ~184m.  It would be 10368cm high or ~103m.  I've no idea how far you'll have to stand back from it to appreciate it though.  The structure would require 24,883,200 lego bricks in total for the image alone, not including all the blocks you'll need behind those to lock them all together.   The only place in the UK I could find bulk buying of Lego bricks is shop.lego.com on the pick a brick feature.   You'd need 8,294,400 of each coloured block so around 8.3million, buying 830 of each block came out at ~£600 so x 10,000 it's £6m for the lego bricks alone.  Hope they do bulk discounts..."
WTF,3dmcmq,soapstud,28,Fri Jul 17 15:31:05 2015 UTC,"It will take you forever to build it too. Alone, laying bricks at 1 brick per second, it will take you 288 days of non-stop brick laying.   If you only work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, it will take you 3.3 years.  Let's say you want to complete this job in just 4 months, it will take you and 9 other people to complete. At minimum wage, you will spend $45,100 employing these 9 people for 4 months. Pretty small compared to $6.5M but still a big chunk of change.  Not to mention paying for insurance and renting a facility large enough to accommodate a 184m x 103m LEGO structure because let's be real, you won't build this outside with wind and weather at play.

Also, we are assuming that you have backed up far enough that there is a perfect 30° angle from your eyes to the top of the image.   I'm using a trig calculator to save a little bit of time, so: tan30°=[101.5/a]   a is approximately 58.6 meters.

WTF,3dmcmq,Capn_Ratch,2,Fri Jul 17 19:02:24 2015 UTC,"Forgot about those bricks, I don't know how because you have to scroll past the 1x3s to find the 2x6s on the lego shop.. anyway on the pick-a-brick feature on Legos website they didn't have any green 1x3, i've no idea why.   But looking at the price of the red/blue 1x3s the price would be exactly half, and you'd still need the same amount of bricks, because you're aiming for the same amount of pixels, it's just the pixels would be smaller. The amount of bricks would be the same for the image. You'd only need less in connecting them behind but I haven't even included any of that in the original."

I feel that's a significant difference in size, especially when you need to think about location and viewdistance.

These are unidentified to us, but could be identified to air traffic controllers.  My guess for not being aircraft is formations are usually closer together that that... at the speed of movement compared to the distance apart, they would be very far. Plus aircraft would normally not have a bright white light, unless you were looking at them head on (landing lights or taxi lights), instead you would see red and green lights denoting the wing tips and direction of flight, as well as strobes warning of their position.   I'm still not writing off civilian or military aircraft, but it does seem odd.. though the video quality is extremely low quality."

Also dragging a fish backwards keeps them from getting oxygen from the water since the gills expel the water out and they can't get enough water in through their mouths.

Actually like... 4-5 larvae are fed Royal jelly, which makes them develop into a queen instead of a worker. What happens is when the first queen hatches, she goes on a mission - to murder her unhatched sisters. Swarming doesn't happen every year if I recall, just under certain conditions.   half if the bees go with this new queen while scout been are sent out to look for a new his location.   Actually, if I recall, it's the old queen that goes out to start the new hive. The new queen stays.   Once that location has been chosen, they'll follow the queen there.    They do this by dancing, by the way. Basically, the more enthusiastic the bee is, the more she'll dance for the spot when she comes back, convincing the other scouts. The bees basically vote as to where to go!  Although sometimes they'll mess it up and the swarm will split and get confused. The swarm then reconvenes, or if the queen is lost, they head back to their original home.   Beekeepers love swarms. It's basically a free starter hive. They basically take a box that has ""I love this place"" smells all over it and dump the bees in. The bees are pissed for a little bit before they realize ""Oh yeah, this place is nice..."" and stick around.   I highly recommend Honey Bee Democracy to learn more about bees."

There aren't many facts that are blatantly wrong in the book, but many behaviors are described with the disclaimer 'no one knows why they do it, but...'  It's fun to see how much we've learned since it's publication in the 50's.   Theories about their navigation in the book do not even mention the important role that the bee's magnetic sense plays in finding direction.  If you can find a copy of the first edition, it's a great read.  It's like talking to one of the old school beekeepers."

So the cause of the flora lasting for countless generations due to the forest fires helping to germinate the seeds and evolutionarily selecting for plants that grow in dry environments, subsequently helping to cause forest fires and thus continue the flora is due to the climate change that in terms of Earth's recent climate history is new and doesn't encompass past generations of said flora and not natural selection for their niche? Did I get all that, or are we going back to you slapping yourself with bologna?"
WTF,3donar,readyno,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:05:17 2015 UTC,"Yea, see, obviously scientists wouldn't call this an extinction event if there were just an average amount of forest fires in California; that would be pretty silly. There are thousands of individual trends that have led them to this revelation. It's largely to do with the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. They go through ice layers with a drill, and can examine the distribution of different elements within the atmosphere throughout time.   So, while the climate has always been cyclical, the concern lies more in the rate of change. For instance, the ocean heating up .7°C all at once, or the diminishing polar sea ice, or the mass extinction of sea life. Since our entire ecosystem is reliant upon the oceans, the collapse of one ecosystem poses a very visible, obvious threat to the ecosystem on land, where we live.   The opposition to taking action to mitigate this event is entirely motivated by greed. One of the larger contributors, the US, has its legislation strongly influenced by big oil companies, for instance. Large oil companies have a vested interest in preventing tightening of environmental regulation, for reasons that I hope are obvious.   The biggest problem with this, is that there is an entire segment of Americans who disregard science entirely, and accept what is told to them by people who have demonstrable links to the oil industry. Things like, 'there has been no increase in the scale or frequency of natural disasters in recent history.' This is, of course, an insidious lie. That is one of the major costs that come with an uninformed democracy. It leads to a system in which experts in any given field of inquiry can be and often are disregarded in favor of political or economic interest, with the population remaining none the wiser.  If we had adequate scientific education in this country, the debate would have ended around 1980. Sadly, this is not the case, and here we are. A mass extinction event. The world doesn't care whether you deign to acknowledge facts. We will preserve ourselves, or we will go extinct."
WTF,3donar,sicsixgun,2,Sat Jul 18 22:25:15 2015 UTC,Show me peer review then...
WTF,3donar,readyno,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:45:27 2015 UTC,"It's all in already, ykno?  I do sometimes tend to berate or antagonize my opponents, and this is regrettable. I do understand the huge diversity in outlook and worldview that exists; and that everyone, with few exceptions, honestly does want to support the truth. It's easy to start seeing each other as enemies, forget that we are all brothers and sisters trapped on the same rock.  I will admit that I could be wrong. I often am, and will reassess any belief or opinion I have in accordance with new data. Forgive me, I'm out to dinner and can't fish for any legitimate links at the moment. But if you're not an oil baron, and like me are always willing to adjust your belief, then I hope you'll look into it.  Just look for 'scientific consensus on climate change.' It is an important matter, and there will be many conflicting accounts. But as you asked for peer review, I assume that you are an intelligent person. There are religious sites that tend to disagree; but science is not their specialty. Then look at the others who disagree, which countries they're from, what political groups they align with. Then find what the actual scientists say, and try to do the same. Determine which side has more to gain through dishonesty.   We need more wise, rational people on our side in this matter. Anyway, good discussion. I hope you'll consider what I've said."
WTF,3donar,sicsixgun,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:55:10 2015 UTC,Provide proof through peer review like any true scientist would or stfu. No credible scientist would say search google in their article.  If you want anyone to ever believe you then back up your facts and stop pussyfooting around the issue.
WTF,3donar,readyno,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:34:02 2015 UTC,"I am not a scientist. It doesn't matter whether I cite particular articles. If you do not understand by now which direction the scientific consensus points in, then what is the sense in pretending you care about evidence?  You don't cite peer review, anyway. You cite peer-reviewed studies. In the scientific community, a study's legitimacy is often seen as relying on it being peer-reviewed. This is not a conspiracy to keep creationists out; it is a pragmatic means of honing the scientific process in order for it to produce the best possible models with which to describe reality.   For scientists to look at a particular body of work and judge its legitimacy, there are usually three main things that are taken into consideration. The first consideration is what sort of academic citations the publishing scientist has had. Also reliability, regarding peer-reviewed studies with a control and reasonable mitigation for confirmation bias. Lastly, there is the number of studies participated in, and general contribution to the field. It is for these reasons, largely, why studies that find results like, 'climate change is not happening,' are not afforded respect within the community. They simply do not meet these criteria that would make their work legitimate. It is a similar case with biological evolution. The point is that everyone who actually cares about evidence will already be well aware of what evidence exists on this issue.  If your argument is that you doubt the fact that such evidence exists, then it is a terrible argument. I am amazed that so many still find ways to disregard something that actually endangers our entire species. The side you're arguing for is the side that says there are too many restrictions on factories and power plants and waste disposal facilities. Now, as a non brain damaged, normal human being; can you really argue that there should be less concern for the environment? Have you not seen species hunted to extinction by humans, holes in the ozone layer, deforestation?   How is it possible to really actually believe that humanity has no impact on its environment? It is an absurd thing to think.  It is an argument based literally entirely off of being dishonest, refusing to acknowledge evidence that does not suit a particular agenda. It is folly. There is not a single element of legitimacy anywhere on that side. Even if you don't believe we are in immediate danger, surely you acknowledge that less pollution is a good thing, right? But if you don't care, you don't care. Fine, and understandable. That just means you're deliberately ignorant. The demand for evidence is just an ironic pretense, at this point, isn't it?"

There is science, with repeatable, observable data. There are some people who tend to adhere to the conclusions of the data; these people show a better understanding of science than people who do not adhere to the conclusions of the data.   I could understand if we were discussing film, or clothing. But we are not. We are discussing real data that exists independently of anyone's willingness to acknowledge it. I consider myself to better understand science in this regard than the people who disregard the science. That seems pretty cut and dry to me."

The notion of saying, '99.999...% of peer reviewed, legitimate scientific studies point one way; but Ted Cruz says it's a political scam, so I'll just regurgitate what he says without even remotely trying to examine the evidence myself,' is at the heart of this debate.   It's your choice, if you wish to blindly serve those in control at the cost of your own environment. But it's galling that you all pretend that you have your own science backing it. The science is all on one side.

We don't know the backstory for one, and I can relate to it personally.  I broke my back many years ago in a horseback riding accident.  I recovered, but not without complications.  I have massive problems that only allow me to walk for short distances as a result of my injuries, and the older I get, the harder it becomes.  As it is hard to exercise due to my injuries, I have gained weight over the years.  When I go shopping I am forced to use the scooters provided or there is no way I can manage in such large stores.  So to me it is a convenience provided by the store to assist me since I am disabled, but to the people around me, they only see a fat lazy bitch riding a scooter, hey that's hilarious, lets post pictures of her on the web...  I am overweight but not because I like to feast on crap food and lounge around all day.  I have to use a scooter not because I'm too lazy to walk, but because I have a medical condition that limits my mobility.  So without the back story, there isn't any way to know what is really going on."

Simple fact is you don't know what was going on before the video started.  The guy could have attacked the driver physically, then when the driver got away or closed his window decided to be an idiot and put himself under his car to stop him from leaving.  Or he could have been going after the guys brake lines.  Either of these scenarios gives a perfectly legit reason for what was done.

WTF,3digk5,Chibler1964,35,Thu Jul 16 19:18:49 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. The powder may not burn as cleanly, which can lead to fouling and jams. The cartridge and bullet may not be machined/moulded as precisely. The primer might be shitty and prone to failure. Powder load size or burn rate can be inconsistent, as might bullet weight, which causes inaccuracy and inconsistency. You get the picture. Consistency is important with ammunition of all sizes."
WTF,3digk5,bclelandgt,47,Thu Jul 16 18:46:32 2015 UTC,"Consistency- in the amount of powder between rounds leads to more consistent speeds and therefore accuracy.   Materials - brass cases are superior to steel because they can be reused (reloaded)   Bullets - there are a ton of different shapes and purposes, you have heard of hollow points of course - hollow points are antipersonell /defense bullets, require more engineering and higher quality materials than FMJ (full Metal jacket), which is basically a lead ball wrapped in another metal. The ammo shown here is FMJ. Even within a certain caliber of FMJ, there is a great variation in bullet weights (you can buy 9mm in anywhere from 95g up to 147grain and higher) , and the more consistently shaped the bullets are, the straighter they will fly.   Also, the primers have to ignite the powder charge every time.   To give a real world example, the cheapest shit 9mm ammo goes for about $10 per box of 50. The high quality stuff is $30 for a box of 20.  Op- there is nothing wrong or illegal about having ammo, assuming you don't live in NYC or DC.

Lets say 3 stabs is probably the equivalent to one bullet (give or take a couple). this means you would have to get 2100 stabs out of the knife for it to work out as 700 rounds of bullet.   A stabbing knife would be completely worn out by the time is on its 1500th stab so you would essentially only be able to stab 500 people 3 times before looking into replacing your knife. where as you could shoot 700 people once.

On the Mohs Scale of Mineral Hardness, basic steel is a 6.5 while a human fingernail (ostensibly the hardest thing in the body along with bone and teeth and who the fuck is stabbing people in the teeth) is a mere 2.5 This would allow for a virtual infinite number of stabs into soft tissue where only the finest edges on the blade may lose their hone but the overall stabbiness (holy shit, no red line - that's a real word) wouldn't be affected.  In peer review, I therefore reject your entire premise and await your rebuttal. If you even have one.  Edit - Thank you for the gold medal. I would also like to shout out to my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, for helping me get through this comment."
WTF,3digk5,PatHeist,12,Thu Jul 16 18:56:54 2015 UTC,"Using only hardness to guesstimate abrasion rates only works if the contact structures of the materials are similar. When talking about knives the fact that the blade edge is really thin matters a lot more. Looking at things like needles through multiple uses demonstrates this reasonably well. Edges also dull a lot faster being pushed against something than when slicing, and you can probably ask a chef about how often they need to hone their chopping knives.   Stabbing is kind of different though, and doesn't have much to do with how sharp the edge of the blade is. You're putting a lot of force behind a very small point, and it's not going to matter whether it's a tiny fraction of a square millimeter, or a slightly larger fraction of a square millimeter. And once you get a puncture it's not going to matter much whether the cutting edge of the blade is sharp or not.   I really don't think there's going to be a resonable numerical limit to how many stabs into humans you can get with a steel knife."

For whatever reason my feet and hands started peeling, and I mean large flakes of skin. During school I had been stealthily peeling large chips from my feet and hands and stuffing them in my pocket. Later in the day I took them all out to show my buddy how many skin chips I had gotten. He immediately advised I eat them out of jest. Super strange. I decided to keep them longer and show my mother in case I needed to see a doctor. Once I got home from school, they were all dried out and crusty. After staring at them for a while, I fell into the temptation.  I ate a large crusty skin chip with added butter and salt. It did not crunch, and the texture was not pleasant. Actually, it kind of just folded up into a little ball while chewing and became impossible to actually eat. The taste though was meh. Perhaps I needed to eat them while they were fresh and in smaller pieces like this lady.   Anyway, thanks for resurfacing those memories OP!"

They can't take your assets or garnish your wages in most states.  A hospital would rather you owe them $10k than $100k because with the former they have some chance of recoup the expense. When someone owes then six figures they usually know that there's no way that's getting paid back and they'll likely try to collect and then sell it off to a collection agency in order to at least make some sort of money for the services rendered.   You can always declare bankruptcy, bankruptcy lawyers can help you with this for a reasonable fee. In, 8 years the bankruptcy will fall off your credit report and you'll be back to normal.

Actually I've worked with CPS (helped foster my cousin's kid while she was in prison) and I have found the opposite to be true. They practically bent over backwards to try and give my cousin's kids back to her even though she almost killed her daughter by passing out on top of her in a drug-induced fugue when she was a year and a half. She almost smothered to death and would have if my aunt and grandmother hadn't found her. CPS allowed my cousin to have her second baby in a halfway house and then LET HER KEEP HIM THERE for months while she underwent ""treatment"" (after which she left and promptly relapsed, losing custody of her second kid too).   So after having to deal with fetal alcohol syndrome and being born with withdrawals, he also had to spend some of his most formative months as an infant in a fucking hellhole full of hubcap thieves and addicts.   Meanwhile CPS fought my family any time we tried to restrict contact between my cousin and her daughter, claiming parental rights.  When you call me in hysterics because you think your baby might have gotten into a solo cup of meth because you're so far gone you can't even keep drugs out of your kid's reach, you don't deserve any parental rights."

This means that they must report anything suspicious or face (possibly) losing their license. So, in order to cover there own asses they report everything. My wife is a child counselor and she reported a kid whose mother threw a fish stick at her as a joke because it left a small mark on her lip. She knew it would amount to nothing, but if it had turned out to be abusive in nature and my wife had known but done nothing it would have cost her her job.  As a side note, She's worked with probably hundreds of CPS workers and is well-versed on how the system works and overall it really does SOOOO much more good than harm. There is no way to avoid false reports with any system that allows for reporting abuse, but CPS does a good job.

WTF,3di3ai,themadxcow,15,Thu Jul 16 22:55:07 2015 UTC,"Some of that might be CPS, sure, but how much of it is due to the extreme social/political outcry whenever CPS misses a real case of abuse?  Departments like CPS are put in a really difficult position:  Give parents a lot of leeway, and when a false negative happens you get crucified in the media and in the statehouse.  Take steps to minimize false negatives and you have to deal with the (often accurate) perception that you are unreasonable, draconian monsters that exist to destroy families.  I think of the case with the ""free range"" parents who have had their kids taken by CPS a few times:  http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/13/living/feat-maryland-free-range-parenting-family-under-investigation-again/  That's insane, right?  But consider it from CPS' perspective:  They receive calls about potentially abandoned/neglected children and probably know there's a 95% chance that there is no issue here.  However, if they don't act and there IS an issue, state senators will be calling for their heads on a platter.  So to cover their ass they have to make sure all the bureaucratic boxes are checked before they turn the kids back over.  The real core of the problem, to me, is not CPS but a culture that treats any and all parenting decisions (and individual decisions in general) as open to public scrutiny, and a legal system that uses discipline, sanction, and incarceration as a first response to legal transgressions.  CPS is a product of that system, not a cause of it."
WTF,3di3ai,SANDYSQUID,-4,Thu Jul 16 22:58:22 2015 UTC,"CPS is a part of the system. If they do not have to get involved, then there is less for them to do. Less hiring, less moving up.

WTF,3di3ai,AbigailLilac,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:34:53 2015 UTC,"Nah, I know first hand that that isn't true. I really didn't want to get into my full story but basically my ex-wife and I had one child, a daughter. She left me after the child was born and went on to have twins with a violent person. So, basically at this point there were two separate families. We lived separately, me and my daughter, her and her boys.   So, an incident happened between her, her boyfriend/father of her kids. I was sitting at home, an average Friday and CPS shows up. They asked a few questions about my history. The big mistake that I made was admitting that I had tried marijuana in high school. This was enough information for them to take my kid. Admitting that I'd tried weed in high school, obviously not fit to be a parent right? /s. The very next day I was ordered to the local police station to take a drug test, which I did, and passed. I haven't tried any drugs since high school, so I passed. It didn't matter. Even though I had nothing to do with the original situation with my ex in another state, and I never pissed dirty on a test, my kid was in the system. I was put on color code after that. I had to take random piss tests for 9 months, I never failed once. Not initially, not ever. They eventually released custody of my daughter to my grandparents as I continued with the color coded drug testing. I've never been arrested, served in the military honorably, and at the time was working for a successful business. None of that mattered. Maybe this is a strange case that's abnormal, maybe my particular case worker was a true shitbird, either way this has been my only experience with CPS so it's what I draw my conclusions from. If it could happen to a law abiding citizen without a violent bone in his body such as myself, it could happen to you."

However, I can imagine a different scenario.  I gave a similar example on another thread.  Your child falls and gets a bad bruise.  He goes to school the next day and shows it off.  Teacher calls CPS.  CPS comes to the home.  Not knowing their rights, the parents let the CPS worker in to the home.  From here, CPS can make up anything they want.  For example, the CPS worker can report that they smell weed in the home.  With no right to counsel, no right to trial, no gathering of evidence, the state can take your children.  If the worker thinks that one parent is smoking weed or doing literally anything that might have a negative impact on the children, the worker can demand that the parents divorce before the other parent will get custody back.  And I find the people that go into this profession are just creepy as hell.  Your job is to go into people's home and make snap judgments about their lifestyles.  WTF?  I know someone who transferred to social work because she couldn't hack it in the education program at her school.  That just scares me.  You can't teach children their ABC's but you're going into a profession that makes life-altering decisions for children and their families.  That doesn't make any fucking sense!!!  Meanwhile, most real abusers are playing the system because most real abusers are master manipulators.  Most real abusers do everything they can to make their world look perfect to outsiders.

And people wonder why oftentimes such things are setup with a lawyer or something similar, and they will only send checks to the college or boarding house as bills are presented instead of putting the student in control of the money.  Every scholarship I got out of high school I wasn't handed cash, I was asked who to make the check payable to, and it had to be the institution I was attending.  I didn't get a bunch, but it did cover the first 2 quarters of Tech School almost, and every single loan company you get student loans from pays the institution directly as well usually.  If I ever set up a trust or something for my children or relatives children, it will be administered in this fashion for this reason.  Incidental spending money will be limited and thats all they will get.  Nice blaming the parents though, since I guess schools don't teach it anymore.  I learned it the hard way, my old man made me get a job when I turned 15 and if I wanted anything outside of what was required to live, I had to earn it, and I had chores to do for allowance from age 10 on.

Of the 214 lobsters I harvested last season I had a number of big ones like this, and let me tell you they all taste the same.  The biggest issue with big males like this is taking the raw meat out of the shell and cutting it up so it cooks evenly.  There are also PLENTY of trophy sized bugs like this one in every breakwater or shallow rock reef along the Southern California coast and at the islands, not to mention incredibly old lobsters haven't actually been proven to be more critical to the breeding population than smaller lobsters and are known to cannibalize their smaller peers."

If you let your dog run free, you have no argument when it gets returned in a plastic bag. Your animal may have been aggressive or attack another person/pet. Animals are both smart and dumb, like many people we see in these subreddits. The difference is that they usually respect they masters. But when those masters are negligent, they have no argument to fall back on when their pet is harms/killed. Animals are not easily predictable."

I don't see how that could possibly be a stretch, as the most common word(s) to see on a dog's bowl is their name.  Therefore, it seems pretty racist to me.

WTF,3dkvyh,PyjamaTime,8,Fri Jul 17 03:51:30 2015 UTC,Watch more of it. There's a part where a lady is telling a story and she has to explain what a grocery store is. Because we (the children watching this shit on the daily) didn't go to the grocery store. This is what they shoved down our throats in an attempt to convince us our way of life was okay. No I am not religious whatsoever. Being raised without any correct knowledge of the real world makes it difficult to function as an adult in society. This cult did some very real damage to a lot of people.

I'm all fine for believing what you want to believe, but when those beliefs start interfering with how you treat others you need to be careful. One of the hallmarks features of a cult is self-seclusion and ostracization of members when they choose to leave or believe otherwise.    Organizations like JW & Scientology really take this to the extreme under the guise that the person has become ""controlled by the devil"", a ""suppressive person"", or some other such nonsense. It's a total control tactic used to manipulate/control people. Really unfortunate."

""Don't do that, because if you do then the most evil being in all of existance will torment you for an eternity in a different dimension where only pain, torment, suffering and sadism is present.""  At first, this came off as boring and just redundant about how good Jesus is to them. Then later on they drift off to more strange and almost disturbing stories.  I'm sorry that this happened to you. These things can really do a number on children and youths.  Just out of curiosity, what was your story like when leaving this? (If you don't mind me asking) Did you have doubts? How did your family react?"
WTF,3dkvyh,osap,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:10:27 2015 UTC,"I had no doubts. Most of the adults (""aunties and uncles"") I knew as a child were abusers, molesters and/or sadists. I knew deep down that someone who will smack a little girl into a wall because she said ""ouch"" while getting her hair braided is probably not going to any sort of heaven. I actually tried to get out when I was around 7 or 8. Ran away with my best friend. It was unsuccessful because she was so afraid of the outside world that she refused to cross the street. I didn't actually make the jump into normalcy till I was 14 and demanded to be sent to school."

The whole flipping it over with his pole was pretty ridiculous.  Sting rays don't have teeth and can easily be lifted by sticking your pointer and middle finger in its mouth and gripping the top of the head with your thumb.  It was quite clear that the fisherman was not accustomed to handling rays.
