wii,3e2gwj,mertman,4,Tue Jul 21 13:17:32 2015 UTC,All of the servers for online capable Wii games were shut down when the hosting company went out of business. Nintendo and other publishers opted not to relocate their servers for the dying Wii hardware. Google can get you more details. Sorry to break the bad news.
wii,3e2gwj,toasterovenly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:40:31 2015 UTC,This is only true for games that were hosted on gamespy servers there are still a handful of games whose online are still up. It is also possible to continue to play the games that were hosted by gamespy by using Wiimmfi like /u/ivaerak said.
wii,3e2gwj,XxXGodXxX,3,Wed Jul 22 09:00:29 2015 UTC,"However, Wii fans are sucessfully running alternative Wii servers called ""Wiimmfi"". You can play many Wii games online without a problem there, however, Homebrew installation is mandatory in order to connect. More info here:  http://wiimmfi.de/  http://wiimmfi.de/stat?showall=1  (click on blue ""i"" icon to go to corresponding support forum thread for each game)  As you will see, Mario Kart Wii, Smash Brawl and Animal Crossing City Folk are by far the most played games there. For others you will need to arrange times for play via chat or messages.  Also Activition games work same as always, because they are on third party servers, so you can still normally play Black Ops and GoldenEye online as you always could."

Search on Amazon for the Japanese classic controller pro because it's cheaper, and works just fine on American Wii's. As for the games here are my suggestions. Personally I feel gets a ton of flack but it's honestly a suburb console with many great looking games. It's not just a casual gamer party box, there are plenty of hardcore games for it.  My suggestions. All these games are decently priced and are essential to own imo.  Rail Shooters: House of the Dead Overkill, Dead Space Extraction, Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles, Sin and Punishment Star Successor.  Action: Mad World, Murasa The Demon Blade, Resident Evil 4 (arguably the best version because of Wiimote controls)  FPS: Red Steel 2, Metroid Prime 3  Adventure: Twilight Princess, Okami  Platformers: Donkey Kong Country Returns, Super Mario Galaxy  Fighters: Super Smash Bros Brawl, Tatsunoko vs Capcom, Samurai Showdown Anthology  Racing: Mario Kart Wii, Excitebots  And that's all I can think of off the top of my head. There are plenty of other games that are worth checking out. The Wii is a great little console and if you combine it with GameCube games you got one awesome library at your disposal."

wii,3ci1fq,BangkokPadang,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:07:28 2015 UTC,"The Zapper feels very strange to use, because you have to pull the trigger with your FRONT hand.   Try this: Act out holding an imaginary shotgun right now. Now look down at your hands, and imagine pulling your imaginary gun's trigger with your front, supporting hand. It just feels weird.  If you want to pull the trigger with your dominant hand, you have to hold the gun in a way that will feel completely backwards. If you want to hold the gun in a way that feels natural, you will have to pull the trigger with your secondary hand, and this will also feel very uncomfortable.  Perhaps, though, you can find a way to enjoy it. Maybe the controls are configurable so you can have Z and C be your fire and grenade buttons.  I just know that I bought the zapper and tried it with the Zelda shooting game that it came with, and ended up loving that game. However, because of the problems I mentioned, I just hold the wiimote in my right hand and the nunchuck in my left like normal. Maybe Goldeneye is much more configurable."

wii,3bw6ng,Neocronic,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:12:18 2015 UTC,So I believe the wii remote is an IR camera that looks at the sensor bar (which is just an array of IR lights/LEDs). So technically you could do a DIY solution ?  Typically the sensor bars I've come across are battery powered :/
wii,3bw6ng,stringfree,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:40:16 2015 UTC,"I don't entirely mind the battery powered. It's just the few I have had stopped functioning all together after a few weeks. If there is one that works, I am all for it."
wii,3bwe9a,Jasonparker17,3,Thu Jul 2 18:25:05 2015 UTC,"The sensors are in fact in the Wii remote. The sensor bar just emits UV light, therefore you can use any two sources of UV light as a sensor bar! This is most commonly done with two candles. So that could be a good short term solution.  In the long run, yes a classic controller can navigate it IIRC (might want to get someone else to confirm that, I may be misremembering). You can get crappy knock of ones for cheap on eBay, I'd go that direction!"
wii,3bwe9a,ausnick2001,3,Thu Jul 2 18:39:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, classic controller can navigate the menu. Used it all the time when I carried my Wii for Smash Bros. That dang sensor bar was such a pain."

I had to buy a sensor bar for the family wii though and HIGHLY suggest buying one of the nicer ones if you're going to play Wii games, especially with children. It's soooo much better for them.   Short version: It depends on what you're going to play long term - Classic controller if you're going to use the Wii store games, or sensor bar if you're going to use Wii games sometimes."

The balance board is quite useful, not enough to make exercise fun, but still a good thing.   Amazon used section is probably your best bet for price/reliability. I find that people on there are overly honest about the condition; and if they are not it's super easy to get your money back.

wii,3bjy3t,gliz5714,2,Tue Jul 7 21:12:27 2015 UTC,"Wii was the first console I bought myself. Totally worth it. Wii Sports is a lot of fun with family. You also never need to leave the house if you want to go bowling. No stinky shoes either.   I grew up with PS1 and PS2, but Wii was by far the most fun I ever had on a console. Driving in MarioKart is amazing when you drive with an actual steering wheel. I also grew up playing Tomb Raider on the playstation, but still, to this day, I feel like Tomb Raider Anniversary on the Wii, was hands down, THE BEST Tomb Raider expierence I've ever had.  There was dusting off artifacts, breaking away wall to free artificats, and manually turning stuff in puzzles.   I think you can easily get a Wii system for very inexpensive. There's the red mini wiis (did they come to the US yet? I know they're in Canada and Europe), which are super cheap. If you get an original Wii, you can even use it to play Gamecube games.  But if you have some extra money, I would recommend Wii U. Being the current system, you get a few more benefits. It also supports Wii games. And you also have access to the Virtual Console, so you can buy old (S)NES, N64, GameBoy, and GameCube games, right on your Wii U.  Wii U games also have working online functions. (For most Wii online stuff the online servers have been shutdown, but if you're not interested in multiplayer stuff, then you don't really need it) But it is a little more expensive."
wii,3bjy3t,Nymunariya,2,Thu Jul 2 13:03:52 2015 UTC,"Can't recommend Amazon used enough, it's simple to use, and Amazon have a pretty solid reputation with a no quibble refund policy.  The Wii is a really solid choice right now, because it's incredibly cheap. There are a great many articles talking about the ""best wii games of all time"", so you won't be buying crap, and it has a big enough library that most anyone can be catered for.  If your last interaction with gaming was i the 90s, then you're rather in luck, because Nintendo allows you to play NES / SNES / N64 and even some SEGA games on the Wii which is really cool.  The beauty of the Wii is it's price right now, and how cheap the games / accessories are. If you want the better games system, get a Wii U because it's totally backward compatible. I wanted to, but it was too much for my budget, went with a Wii, didn't regret it :) x"

wii,3at41o,TayRay420,2,Tue Jun 23 10:29:56 2015 UTC,"It's probably just the ac/dc transformer that's fried. Out of curiosity check the marking on your power adaptor and it will tell you if it accepts input higher than 120 volts or not. Sometimes transformers are made for an international market and accept anything from 110 up to 240 volts, and just ship with different power plugs for the wall socket. If yours accepts 220v then something else happened."

wii,3at41o,Headshot_,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:32:43 2015 UTC,"A Class 2 circuit is defined as the low voltage wiring between the power source and the end device.  Probably just fried the power supply, cross you fingers the one you ordered will work."
wii,3at41o,elvis2012,2,Tue Jun 23 20:29:18 2015 UTC,"I believe the power brick for the Wii has a fuse in it. The fuse SHOULD have essentially saved your Wii from getting fried, by burning up and not letting any power to get the console its self. A new power supply should work, but there is a small chance that the fuse did not save the Wii in time. Just make sure you double check the label on the supply to check that its 220v so it doesn't happen again. Let us know if it works!"

You should get a spare controller while third-party made ones are still plentiful, and you should use BootMii (I recommend using the LetterBomb exploit to install it) to insure that your Wii is recoverable if it ever gets bricked. To tell you why I think the Wii will be a trooper: I've seen instances with a 2007 Wii taking an occasional 4 foot drop and continue working just fine to this day. The Wiimotes are physically very durable too. One of my original controllers from 2007 stopped working about 3 years ago (no idea why). The other one, which still works, was pitched a couple times into the edge of a stone table, and all it has is a minor fracture on the back and a crack along the B button."

The Wii Classic Controller is probably the closest thing to what you're describing, but it's up to each individual game to provide support for it - and IIRC not many Wii titles did. It was mostly designed for use with VC games.  There are also third party equivalents out there, especially now that the Wii U Pro controller is out. I think I've seen a third party controller that claims it's usable as either a Wii Classic or Wii U Pro, but I can't remember what manufacturer or model.  Again, though, most Wii games only support Wiimote + Nunchuk controls. You'd have to check on each individual game to find out if it would support a different control scheme.

If you were super-nice actually update the mods first then remove the card. The end result is then a nice properly modded console that the kid can't mess up or use Homebrew on as supplied but if he ever wanted to add USB loading himself in the future he can just whack a loader app and some games on a USB drive and be away with no risk of him messing up the console himself.  That's a much better gift than giving him something you've gone out of your way to make harder for him to mod and increase his likelihood of bricking in the future.
wii,38oo42,Christendom,2,Fri Jun 5 16:11:44 2015 UTC,You can just re-download the games if you can't recover them.
wii,38oo42,sportsziggy,2,Fri Jun 5 17:10:43 2015 UTC,There is no hard drive in the machine.  It has flash memory on the system board.  I have a bad feeling that if it was all erased it probably means they ran the procedure to erase all user info.  If that is done then there is no recovering.  Unfortunately Nintendo links all licenses to a console id.  Basically if you run the clean the console in the settings it will delete all the info and give the console a fresh id.  So I hate to say it but she is probably SOL.
wii,38oo42,Kmac09,2,Fri Jun 5 22:45:23 2015 UTC,"If it's really a hard drive that was formatted, the kid probably had a hacked Wii with downloaded games.  Or, this was a Wii U, not a Wii, in which case the games were probably legit and will need to be redownloaded."

wii,37mmce,Just_B1aze,2,Thu May 28 19:06:39 2015 UTC,Always ask about the disc drive and sd card. I've found a lot of the original white wiis had the problem. As long as you aren't getting a family edition (those are the ones without GC support - they don't have a stand so the buttons and letters are different than the regular wii) you should be fine.   Missing drive doors isn't a huge deal you can always go online and grab them. It is riskier but you can always try flea markets. I just picked up a wii plus two controllers for $35.

wii,37mmce,Saysbadman,2,Sat May 30 12:28:42 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/uO2Z3.jpg  You want the top one for the GameCube compatibility. The missing covers probably aren't going to make much of a difference unless the previous owner's house was filthy, and the last time that I checked, you could buy replacement flaps on store.nintendo.com anyway.  The only real ""problem"" red flags that you would see, you wouldn't really be able to see without powering the thing on first. If it doesn't get to the home screen or the display looks really staticky, that's your red flag.  The only physical red flags that exist are that the middle model in the photo above will be missing GameCube ports, and the Wii mini (not pictured) will be missing those and just about everything else."
wii,37mmce,bigsphinxofquartz,2,Sun May 31 03:07:06 2015 UTC,"Why are you buying it? What are you looking to spend? What games are you going to play? If you just want a cheap Mario cart box, grab one of those $99 Wii minis. They come with a remote, are brand new, and play games just fine. The problem? No web access. Just a thought, that would have a warranty and would be brand new, no risk of getting bit.   As far as things to look for, nothing as far as I know. Whenever I buy a used console I try to pick it up from someone's house, main reason is I want to see it work before I leave. if their house is discussing and they dont take care of their stuff, I'm out. Tbh I would look at the condition of the remotes, those are essentially worth more then the console.   This seems like a good deal and is guaranteed to work."
wii,37mmce,rochford77,2,Thu May 28 20:01:42 2015 UTC,"That seems like a great price for that bundle.  I want a first gen Wii so that I can play gamecube games and avoid buying a gamecube controller adapter.  The Wii will be for our family fun time, so the games I am looking to play are mostly mario kart, mario party, fishing resort, wii sports/resort and all the Zelda games. I am staying away from the mini Wii because they are not backwards compatible (gamecube discs).  I have done a little research and now I am looking for this subs personal experience in owning a Wii and/or buying a used Wii."

Got a ps4 with any game if my choosing (the last of us) and a remote with a 30 day warranty for $299.99usd 8 months after launch."
wii,37mmce,metroidfan220,1 point,Thu May 28 21:14:01 2015 UTC,Not really.  There is gamestop and gorilla games.  I have not purchased anything used from either.  I have heard bad things from gorilla games and I pre-ordered an arkham knight special edition ps4 from gamestop.  Almost every used Wii that I have seen has missing covers or does not come with any cables or remotes.
wii,37mmce,noflamingo,2,Fri May 29 01:24:53 2015 UTC,"Just a note that the Wii Mini also doesn't output component video, which makes it look terrible on an HDTV. You're better off with a used standard Wii from GameStop."
wii,37mmce,noflamingo,1 point,Fri May 29 05:45:15 2015 UTC,I bought a used wii off of Amazon for 40 dollars and 8 dollars shipping. It came with two wiimotes and nunchunks and all the original cables. Just read the description listed by the seller and check that they have good ratings. Mine was listed as acceptable condition but it came with all it's covers and no visible scratches on the white surface. The usb slots are very dusty but after cleaning they worked. I can play disc games just fine.
wii,37mmce,godis1coolguy,1 point,Thu May 28 22:16:51 2015 UTC,"Went back and read most of the descriptions and most of them state that they are only offering the console and nothing else, also the covers MIGHT be missing and they have some MINOR scratches.  I am reluctant to buy anything because there is so many stating that they are missing covers.  There is a few that don't state they are missing anything but they don't have much info.  Its usually ""Nintendo Wii, it works, you buy NOW""."
wii,37mmce,Saysbadman,2,Fri May 29 01:36:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with your reluctance, don't buy anything that has too vague a description. The more description provided the better, especially if there are pictures. You can wait around for a good deal to pop up on Amazon or eBay ( I find the deals more expensive on eBay  even with only the console provided).  The offer posted above is a good deal. Call up the game stop with the bundle available and ask if the console provided can play GameCube games.   The wii I bought from Amazon was from FNEM Auctions. If you like to wait, keeping an eye on the seller wouldn't hurt."
wii,37kqpn,Dktje,16,Thu May 28 10:06:15 2015 UTC,Why is it worth it?   Because it's one of the best SP games on Wii  /thread
wii,37kqpn,frisch85,11,Thu May 28 10:21:02 2015 UTC,Yes. This is such an amazing game. The gameplay and story are spot on. You will never regret owning this.
wii,37kqpn,LuFoPo,7,Thu May 28 11:53:11 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on how patient you are. Skyward Sword is good, but it takes SO LONG to get going.

wii,37kqpn,Krustoff,2,Thu May 28 11:24:33 2015 UTC,The controls are the only thing stopping me from getting this. The last thing I feel like doing after work is swing my arms around while relaxing playing a video game.  Do you need to have the more advanced wiimote for SS?
wii,37kqpn,Conjugal_Burns,6,Thu May 28 12:38:39 2015 UTC,"The Motion Plus attachment OR the upgraded Wiimote (any new one you find in a store is guaranteed to be Motion Plus at this point) is required, yes.  Also, don't worry about the swinging. Even small movements from the wrist can suffice. I was chillin' out for most of the game, only really getting into it for some bigger battles.  The game is amazing."

wii,37kqpn,Nomnom_downvotes,3,Thu May 28 14:04:11 2015 UTC,"I personally hated it, as the ""Navi"" in this one is hand-holding to the point of being condescending. She'll pop up CONSTANTLY for the most mundane things. And revisiting old dungeons feels cheap."
wii,37kqpn,Tokeli,6,Thu May 28 16:20:14 2015 UTC,"Skyward Sword is my least favourite out of the Zelda games.   I felt the controls were less than inviting: I didn't enjoy using them in the repetitive ""enemy is blocking horizontally - strike vertically or get zapped"", and it was tiring trying to do a skyward strike and the game registering you as pointing half up. (see Mega64's take for an example :P : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4DeHTo6hUI)  I personally felt the culture that was captured in the earlier titles was lacking in this game. Something felt forced about every quest, and the relationships were relatively superficial.  And lastly, the repetitive boss battles, empty skies, and ""the same 3 levels in low resolution"" quickly turned SS into a disappointment for me."
wii,37kqpn,Groggeroo,2,Thu May 28 19:12:32 2015 UTC,"I still plan to buy the Golden Wii SS bundle so definitively for me more than worth it. Can't wait. It is the game where motion controls were ""done right"", similar to how in Zombi U the gamepad features were ""done right""."
wii,37kqpn,ivaerak,2,Fri May 29 04:06:18 2015 UTC,"A huge piece of advice that I feel a lot of people overlook: Remember, the Wiimote is a controller, not a sword. I've seen a lot of arguments saying they can't get their sword attacks to work right. Wave your arm in a straight line and not too hard. You'll have zero problems with the controls. But, overall, I love the game, and you won't regret owning it at all. By far one of the best Wii games."

wii,373hir,WitBeer,8,Sun May 24 15:36:24 2015 UTC,"This is most likely the problem, OP. Get some Wii component cables. If you're using the old school composite (yellow/red/white) cables it'll look like butt."
wii,373hir,badwolf422,2,Sun May 24 17:27:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm still using the yellow/red/white cables that came with the system. Just found some component cables online for not too much. Im just wondering how big of a difference this would make. Do you know where I could find like a image to compare the AV cables to the component cables?"
wii,373hir,badwolf422,3,Sun May 24 21:59:31 2015 UTC,"I don't have a comparison image, but I've hooked a Wii up to the same TV via both AV and component, and I can vouch that it makes a huge difference."
wii,373hir,ThatGraemeGuy,1 point,Sun May 24 23:14:12 2015 UTC,Its a BIG difference. Image is sharper and the colours more vibrant. Make sure you set the Wii's video output to 480p after changing to component output.
wii,373hir,Phil_Bond,1 point,Mon May 25 08:50:55 2015 UTC,"This is elementary A/V technology basics. Coax was the connection standard for NES and SNES, and made a pretty fuzzy picture. Composite was also possible, and was the standard for N64, GameCube and Wii, and was cleaner. GameCube, Wii and Wii U all support component, which is a whole different type of signal. HDTVs generally assemble old pre-component signal types all wrong, by zipping the lines of the alternating video frames together in a sloppy way that creates a weird horizontal blur effect. Get some component cables for your Wii, and it'll still be an SD picture, but it'll look better than it did on your old TV, because it won't look like it was put through a paper shredder and then taped back together.  Also make sure you have the right shape of TV (widescreen) selected in the Wii system menu, or everything will look proportionally squashed. That goes for whatever cables you use."
wii,373hir,Yonimitsu,1 point,Mon May 25 19:51:42 2015 UTC,Played Metroid: Other M yesterday though. Still looks gorgeous.  What do you recommend for maximum quality? My TV is a LCD but I still use the component cables.   Edit: Never mind. Misread the comment. I should buy component cables.

So I pulled out an old Commodore Monitor to play my Wii on.  I have used composite & component cables on it.   It could be my Samsung does a horrible upscale, or could just be I'm picky.

wii,36uvgt,Spodegirl,1 point,Fri May 22 08:55:44 2015 UTC,"I didn't even know the Wii was able to completely eject discs and it definitely shouldn't do that if it's working correctly. Your drive probably needs to be replaced. A replacement drive is about $20 on eBay (plus ~$2 for the necessary tools) and the replacement is pretty easy.  It's pretty hard to get the Wii's drive lens dirty. If you still want to clean it, don't bother with the official lens cleaning kit from Nintendo. It costs about half as much as a replacement drive and does virtually nothing. Try compressed air instead.  Does this happen to all games or just this one? (If it's the latter, which game is it?) Are the discs you tried in good condition?  Does your Wii have a Modchip (or any other hardware modification)? Certain chips and mods can cause problems with some games.  Does your Wii have any kind of softmod? If it's a bad one it can mess up the way your drive behaves.  How old is your Wii? Some old Wiis have problems with dual-layer discs or in rare cases give up altogether."

If Castlevania and Metroid are available on Virtual Console, I'd recommend those too, especially if you dig retro games. And I think there are some ""Art Style"" games available on Wiiware for 500 or 600 points. The Art Style games were a series of puzzle titles that debuted (if I remember right) on DsiWare. If the Wii games are as inventive and clever as the Dsi titles, I'd recommend those as well. And BIT.TRIP.BEAT is cool if you dig chiptunes and/or unique rhythm games, and I think it's available for around 500 or 600 points. There's some awesome stuff on the Wii shop, for sure."

wii,34dbra,SubredditReddit,2,Sat May 2 00:56:06 2015 UTC,"I think this is definitely possible. A few questions:  Did you use an SD card for any Wii data?  Do you have the transfer channel installed on the Wii, or would you need to install it after updating the system?  Is your Wii softmodded (with HBC/BootMii)?  Edit: According to Nintendo Support, you need a Wii Remote to control the transfer channel. There's some other interesting info there as well, I'd recommend you read it."

I assumed I'd need a Wii remote, but it doesn't specify if you can navigate through the process without using the sensor, which would be next to impossible if I can't see where I'm pointing.

wii,334m99,13zath13,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:24:45 2015 UTC,If you're worried then you can just not bother with the update. Install some homebrew disc launcher (I know Riivolution works for this purpose) and launch your game through that. That way you wont get prompted to update. You can get Riivo off the homebrew browser.  That said I think updating to 4.3 via the official method is safe (which is why it advises that on Wiibrew) but I take no responsibility if this turns out not to be the case.

All a new update will do is remove homebrew, including priiloader (if it exists) and remove any Custom IOS installed on the console and replace them with STUB IOS.   From there you can mod again using letterbomb or Other method of your choosing :) replacing the cIOS is harder with STUB IOS existing, but it can be done by deleting them first Using an IOS manage manager.  You will have to install priiloader again in order to block updates as the wii will ask for updates before you can play retail discs if you delete STUB IOS :p  Easy when ya know how I guess XD"

There are a few subtle but distinct differences between  the Wii mini and the WiiU, the two most notable in this case are that the mini has no usb ports and that it can't play Super Smash Bros for WiiU.  If you're talking about some third party adapter to connect the GC controller to a Wiimote to act as a classic controller then it will act as a classic controller and thus function with any game that supports a classic controller.

wii,32qhu9,j1ggy,2,Thu Apr 16 02:02:39 2015 UTC,"Sigh. Let me explain better for you. ""Homebrew"" is a codename for unofficial software. When you softmod your Wii, you're running an exploit that installs a channel called ""The Homebrew Channel"" to your Wii. It's an unofficial channel not supported by Nintendo, and acts as a launching pad to run unofficial software. On my Wii for example, I run emulators such as Snes9x. It runs literally every Super Nintendo game from existence, either from an external hard drive or an SD Card, with tons of extra features that the SNES didn't have. I also run emulators for NES, Genesis, Game Gear, Sega Master System, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance and Turbo Grafx-16. And I have every game in existence for each. It's a legal grey area, but it can be done. /r/wiihacks is a good place to start if you're interested in looking into this. I also recommend getting a couple Classic Controller Pros. Make sure you DON'T get the ones for the Wii U, they won't work."

I said to do that first as if you install homebrew and then install a new System Menu version your homebrew will be overwritten (or the Wii might get bricked, not too sure).  Homebrew is basically like Wii Channels. I haven't seen an OS replacement for the Wii other than the Linux distros for it."

Softmodding allows you to do emulation and allows you to rip your games to load them off USB. The USB will load faster than disc plus young'uns won't be touching and messing up disc. The first wiis are the best because they also play GameCube games.

Thanks very much! went to her house up in snobbytown yesterday, tried the thing with various outlets, tried with and without each accessory plugged in. No dice. Will try this because its a new power adapter we bought recently and does not smell burned. I did, however, notice a light burnt plastic smell from the step up adapter we use (it's a 110 wii we are 220) so i think it may be that!

Basically despite it being technically possible it just isn't.  They are designed to be soldered in place using a precisely placed part and balls of solder underneath which are melted to make contact.  They are not designed to be removed and attempting it will make things worse.  Honestly if you don't have a whole load of digital items you should replace it.  That sucks but it is probably the best you can do...

My biggest issue is the fact that it is a launch Wii, and not one of those locked boot2 or gimped systems without gamecube compatibility.  It sounds like my only options are to either somehow remove all traces of Homebrew and see if Nintendo can repair it without replacing it, or just try to find a launch Wii that does not have any artifacting."

With the Wii I believe it is basically the motherboard and then additional boards for the gc controller ports, wifi, bluetooth.  I think the storage is on the motherboard so any replacement of that would mean you probably get a copy of your data but anything else would be gone and probably updated firmware and system software."

Don't update the System Software, since there are no useful features, and avoid touching cIOS and other files to avoid softbriks.

You may have to buy a game that allows you to hack your wii (The Twilight Princess hack is not listed on there but is a viable option)  if you don't already own one though. After that it's just using game backups to load onto your USB or SD card and play using the backups using USBLoader or similar.

wii,31cu4f,FudgeRoDuck,1 point,Fri Apr 3 21:36:26 2015 UTC,What method did you use for modding? I'm not an expert but 'unmodding' should be as simple as deleting Homebrew Channel from the system and updating Wii system from system settings.
wii,31cu4f,ivaerak,1 point,Fri Apr 3 22:34:13 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I had no experience back then and took it to a guy to mod it for me. He installed some sort of different app to run games for me, not homebrew."

You wouldn't get many games and the home brew on an 8gb SD card. 8 gb SD card is enough for the home brew and a usb loader, but you're going to need a usb flash drive or, even better, a hard drive to store the images on. Get something like USB LoaderGX, and on your PC get WBFS manager or similar to format the drive and transfer the images.   Also, legally you're supposed to only backup games on HDD that you own, but who's got space for all those DVD cases..."

wii,3123ut,The_Cunt_Punter_,1 point,Thu Apr 2 02:21:47 2015 UTC,"It is a beautiful looking game, also very intuitive and enjoyable for playing, motion controls for paint & thinner make Wii version without a single doubt the best out of all 3 consoles (ps3, x360 and wii U) on which epic mickey 2 was released on.  Camera can act a little bit weird sometimes, but this presents only a minor problem once you learn how it works. The music will hook you up instantly, sometimes I go back to the game for the music alone. The concept of Thinner and Paint Path (michievious and well mannered decisions) and branching of the sidequests accordingly makes this game even more addictive for people who like to achieve all possible achievements in a game. It is very easy to get lost in this game for 12 hours straight without even noticing it, and even after the main story completion.  Great take on the concept of ""revisiting the old story"" in a sequel. Not a generic 'what you would expect out of a' sequel."
wii,30zls2,ArokLazarus,2,Tue Mar 31 23:44:48 2015 UTC,"Nope. Composite to USB or HDMI would have to be active and therefore certainly worth more than just jacking around with the TV again.

wii,2zswaf,NanoComputer,2,Sat Mar 21 20:50:11 2015 UTC,"What's 'hidden' can be very relative and subjective.  I'll go for some of the ones that are less known...These aren't 'perfect' games (except Klonoa, in my opinion), but they are worth a try.   Fragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of the Moon Klonoa (One of the best games on the Wii) Mushroom Men: The Spore Wars Dewy's Adventure Disaster: Day of Crisis Dokapon Kingdom Conduit (1 & 2)   I'd say Batman: Brave and the Bold is fairly well known, but it's quite underrated - really solid title."

I'm not sure if the 3DS experience will be as good as the Wii experience, but the game is supposed to be the same.  Personally, I found Xenoblade Chronicles to be a console-making game. That is, I got so much gameplay and enjoyment out of it (>180 hours), that it justified buying a Wii. If I didn't own Xenoblade already, and was unable to find it for a reasonable price for Wii, I'd consider buying a 3DS just to play the 3DS version."

You lose the everyone making an ass out of themselves using the Wii Remote on their body as an elephant nose, an umbrella, etc., but you also gain people knowing instantly that they need to use the joystick and big green A button to control it. Some of the Smooth Moves games can be frustrating for new people that don't know how each minigame wants you to handle the Wii Remote.  Or do like I do and get both!  Also recommend the Wii disc of You Don't Know Jack, and Tomena Sanner, which is only $5 for download on the Wii Shop Channel and is four-player."

That looks like one of the official ones as well, but I've seen some really close knockoffs as well.

Your placement in the actual race just nets you a certain number of stars, which is what you get for completing tricks as well."
wii,2y5klj,penciledindotcom,4,Sat Mar 7 04:53:00 2015 UTC,"Like Excite Truck before it, the game is not about finishing first as much as getting enough stars (though finishing first helps).  Doing tricks earns stars, so that's something you need to do.  I don't remember the single-player being especially hard, but I have to admit I preferred Excite Trucks a lot more -- Excite Truck managed to keep its sheer white-knuckled racing action even while you were doing insane stunts (do multiple 360-degree spins while vaulting from 10,000 feet! EXCITE!), and I think the tricks in ExciteBots ultimately detracted too much from that. I 100% completed Excite Truck, but couldn't be bothered to finish ExciteBots."

wii,2xubex,ivaerak,2,Thu Mar 5 23:12:24 2015 UTC,also look up Dead Rising. Many say that exactly motion controls make this game better than x360 original.

wii,2xozgm,SpecialU,1 point,Wed Mar 4 16:22:11 2015 UTC,"Carnival Games:       Carnival Games (known in Europe and Australia as Carnival Funfair Games) is a video game for Nintendo's Wii console and the Nintendo DS. It was published by Global Star Software, before GSS was absorbed into Take-Two Interactive (and what is now 2K Play).  Despite poor reviews by most gaming websites and critics, the game was a commercial success. The Wii and DS versions of the game have combined shipped over 7 million copies to date,  which according to the NPD Group, is the third best-selling third-party game on the Wii.  As a result of the original's success, a follow-up for the Wii was announced, and launched in the fall of 2008, titled Carnival Games: Mini-Golf.  A proper sequel, New Carnival Games, was released on September 21, 2010 for the Wii and Nintendo DS.

If it is the one that has the original GCN plug at the end, then it is literally a Gamecube Controller made probably a decade ago, but was just never sold by Nintendo and this is identical to the ones you would have bought with a GCN (with a Smash logo stuck on, of course). If it is the one that plugs into a Wiimote, then the Wii treats it like a Classic Controller and is therefore compatible. Have fun smashing!"

I bought one like this: [http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B00EUWREQ2?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00] you should be fine at around 30-40 Euros but make sure it converts component to hdmi and not the other way around.

If not then as others have suggested the HDMI converter is the next best bet. However a lot of TVs don't seem to support it for some reason (mine didn't), and people say the colour isn't quite as good as component."
wii,2vshlv,PhotoJim99,4,Fri Feb 13 23:01:01 2015 UTC,The HDMI converter will also create a little lag versus using component video straight into the TV.
wii,2vshlv,ausnick2001,1 point,Sat Feb 14 00:48:12 2015 UTC,Now I'm glad that I have compenent :). What was the idea behind it actually? An alternatuve besides hdmi?
wii,2vshlv,fuzeebear,1 point,Sat Feb 14 07:36:51 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, I'm not sure. I think component was around before HDMI. The PS2 could be plugged in via component and so could the Xbox 360, but I think it only supports resolutions up to 1080i. So for the heavy hitting consoles (PS3, X360), HDMI became the standard.   So in short, I think when the Wii was being developed, component was the standard way of getting higher resolutions. HDMI wasn't really a standard thing back then.  Anyways definitely get a component cable. It's cheap and is natively supported, so it will give you the best results rather than using a 3rd party HDMI converter which washes out the colour and introduces delay."
wii,2vshlv,basiamille,1 point,Sat Feb 14 11:25:42 2015 UTC,"Ah ok. I remember the first 360's would only support component, not HDMI.   I just ordered a component cable for the wii.

I'm enjoying my Wii U now. It has the Wii built-in, but I barely touch it any more.  The Wii was truly magical. I remember getting one about 3 months after it came out in a cold January morning in 2007. What a cool system. It could have been so much more, but it was still amazing for what it was.  The launch title of Wii Sports was so darn cool. Even the stupid weather app had this magical quality to it. And then Zelda came out a few months later. And then a couple years later Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 and New Super Mario Bros Wii and Mario Kart Wii. (And if you can still get the game ""Fluidity"" from the Wii Store, buy it!)

wii,2v0ssl,TheNostalgiaBomb,1 point,Sat Feb 7 07:52:08 2015 UTC,"What I did was that I bought a used WII and softmodded it, which is also the cheapest alternative, since you can pirate all games.   Be sure to check if it's the older model with gamecube controller ports if you want to play GC games on it.   In total I've bought a used WII console, 4 gamecube controllers, a cheap USB (to store the pirated gamecube/wii games on), a GC memory card, an SD card, and I was good to go. And it wasn't that expensive. What was most expensive was the gamecube controllers really, since I wanted them in mint condition, but you can get pretty cheap unoriginal GC controllers.  If you buy a WII and don't want to softmod it, then you'll have to insert the disc when you want to play gamecube games everytime. (and remember to buy a GC memory card. Gamecube games don't save on the WII.)  The WII games aren't stored on the console, but the emulated n64 games (and older emulated games) however are stored on the WII (they might be stored on an SD card plugged into the WII, I'm not sure.)  No you don't need to have access to the internet to play them, and yes you could bring your wii to your friends place to play. But I'd recommend going the softmodding route and save a whole lot of money."

wii,2v0ssl,bigsphinxofquartz,1 point,Sun Feb 8 08:37:19 2015 UTC,"So first detail: the Wii U doesn't play GameCube games unless you mod it, and then it only plays the ISOs with a homebrew app. So going the official route, if you want a device that plays games from any Nintendo generation from NES to Wii with GameCube included, you're still going to want to hang onto that Wii.  For Virtual Console games (SNES and N64 downloads), as long as you download the Wii U Transfer Tool app from the Wii Shop Channel, you can indeed transfer them over to the Wii U, but that also deletes the games from the Wii and prevents you from re-downloading them there without paying again. On the Wii U, the transferred games work in the Wii U's ""Wii Mode"" -- basically, a mode where the Wii U has no access to the Wii U Gamepad's buttons or touchscreen beyond it just showing the same thing as what's on your TV, and where only the Wii Remote, nunchuck, and Classic Controller are usable. You're supposed to be able to ""upgrade"" your old Wii Virtual Console SNES games to better Wii U versions that don't have to deal with Wii Mode for a small fee, but there still aren't any N64 Virtual Console games on the Wii U, so those are stuck behind Wii Mode for the foreseeable future.  tl;dr: If you get a Wii U, probably just use it for Wii U games if you bought a lot of things on your Wii already"

wii,2uk87m,Felaktigt,4,Mon Feb 2 21:34:40 2015 UTC,"So, seems like I've just realised the thing with virtual console. And my question is, how it works. Is the wii able to emulate classic games from start or is that something that comes with each classic copy that you buy.    Based on the file size of Virtual Console games vs the known ROM sizes of those games, I'm fairly certain that emulator software comes packed with each VC title you buy.  They're a ROM with an emulator wrapper.  I think I read something recently of people finding a way to swap the ROMs in VC games to play any game you wanted (not legally), so that would confirm each game is both a ROM and emulator.  The Wii definitly does not have native system support for NES, SNES, etc. games.   Is a backedup wii game same as a downloaded virtual console game?   What do you mean by ""backedup""?"
wii,2uk87m,SecretToEverybody,1 point,Mon Feb 2 22:54:50 2015 UTC,"Well the way I understand backedup games is that you're able to rip a disc copy of a game onto a harddrive, thereby getting a digital copy of it, which then you can use to play on a hacked wii with a backup launcher such as Usb loader GX. You're also able to pirate a backed up game in ISO format for your backup laucher to play."
wii,2uk87m,916253,3,Tue Feb 3 07:38:48 2015 UTC,"Every virtual console title is wrapped in an emulator. A backup wii game is the same as a virtual console game in the sense that it is a digital copy of a game that was once sold on store mediums, but you running a backup wii game on a wii isn't emulation its hardware bypassing"

After 2010 the Wii was pretty sparse in terms of big games, or any games for that matter.   Not only that but many consider it the one of the better Kirby games, up there with 64 and Super Star since it's very traditional and has a good set of post game content and collectibles so it encourages replay value if anything.  Final though/possible reason is that it maybe just had a low print run. Nintendo has been slowly but surely making less and less when it comes to physical games."

wii,2tjvil,zfa,2,Sun Jan 25 10:23:33 2015 UTC,"The guides you've seen must be old or wrong. I hope for your sake they're just old. Really anyone modding their Wii should be using Modmii (PC tool) if you ask me.  FAT32 is better for lots of reasons but briefly it allows you to use standard tools to recover data in the case of a problem with the drive, it can be used to play not just Wii bakcups, but GameCube backups and VC/WiiWare via an emuNAND. It can be used as your NAND giving you virtually limitless space for games and saved game data. It means you drive isn't just Wii-specific and can be used to hold any other data if you need it to. You could put music or video on it and play it back through your wii using WiiMC. Yo can put old skool ROMs on it and play those via emulators. Over and above all of those simple usability benefits it is most importantly simply better supported for playing Wii backups from (so it is more stable, more games supported - if you have an issue loading a game form WBFS and ask someone for help the first thing you'll get is 'put it on a FAT32 drive and try again' before anyone would do any further troubleshooting).  To apply Wii .ISOs to a FAT32 drive use the PC tool 'Wii Backup Manager', this shrinks games and puts them in the correct place on your drive for your Wii's backup loader to find them. Wii Backup Manager can also format your drive to FAT32 as it was removed as a native window format option in MS Vista."

wii,2tjvil,ProofRope,2,Sun Jan 25 10:53:16 2015 UTC,32kb.  Wii Backup Manager will put games in the correct place (as well as convert/resize).  Wii backups go into USB:\wbfs\ and GC backups in USB:\games.

Have it usable on the gamepad for one user and on 3DS's for the rest.  Crystal Chronicles was the best, but the other Crystal Chronicles games never captured the perfection of the original. I actually had 3 link cables, so I can attest that the multiplayer on that game was freaking fun. It's too bad that not a lot of people could experience it because of the need for those cables. Also, the graphics were some of the best on the Gamecube, on par with Metroid Prime."

The Wii U controller (the ""tablet"") is a different beast from the Wii U Pro Controller, which is optional and provides an XBox 360-style layout.

wii,2rd5wq,RangerPretzel,6,Mon Jan 5 07:42:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, it would have been clearer. But I'm confused as to why people got confused to begin with. I didn't really follow the Wii U story very much, being poor at the time and unable to afford one anyway. But even my limited experience with them indicated to me that it was, in fact, a separate console, and the controller was...well, the Wii U controller, not the Wii U itself. I don't know where people got the idea that the Wii U wasn't an entirely new console."
wii,2rd5wq,ivaerak,0,Mon Jan 5 08:02:57 2015 UTC,"I get the sense that the public didn't know what the ""U"" meant. It was too clever. (Whee-ooo!) Heck, even the name ""Wii"" (Whee!) was too clever at the time, but thankfully it was a simple enough name that the public was still able to grasp the name and remember it.  Along the same lines, I think MS messed up calling the 3rd-gen Xbox, the Xbox One. They should have called it the 720 or the 1080 as it's a much higher number than 360. (2 to 3 times higher, to be exact.)  Given that tablets are so small, it's entirely plausible (in some people's minds) for the Wii U to be just the Wii U controller. I can kinda see how people would have come to that conclusion.  Ever play with a Chromecast or FireTV stick? Just plug the thing into an HDMI port and pair your phone or tablet with it and off you go. I can see how people might think the Wii U controller was the whole device or perhaps just an add-on to the existing Wii."

As far as I've ever seen, there is no credit card information to remove from the Wii Shop Channel. Every time I've ever bought a game, I've had to re-enter payment information.

That isn't how it works. Game consoles use proprietary systems and drivers that are incompatible with other systems.  It isn't the same as the PC environment where you have class compliant USB HID devices that don't require drivers.  You need to  buy singstar mics that are branded to work with the wii.

Many of the softmod/homebrew software allows for USB devices to act as input devices for games, but that is because they have used an open source HID driver.  Audio drivers for specific devices like that are less likely to be supported by the home-brew community. I have a softmodded Wii, and am actually a moderator at /r/PS2 and have written several of the softmod guides for that system as well.

I am asking this because I had a similar message pop up right after I booted up Wii. I clicked on the Homebrew Channel ""Start"" button very shortly after the system booted up, and a message appeared. Rebooting solved it.

wii,2r15s6,bigsphinxofquartz,2,Sat Jan 3 17:44:46 2015 UTC,"This happens to me after running the Netflix app most of the time. Usually after the third time getting the message, it just lets me start up into the home screen as usual, but you can also try going into maintenance mode by holding the + and - buttons while hitting A on the health warning screen. After doing either of those, it usually would just work as usual playing any disc or channel games until I run Netflix or another video app again.  I think in theory that this tends to happen via some sort of corruption of a Wii message board message, but I've deleted pretty much every message that a game or such has ever sent me since the day that I bought it, and it didn't seem to make any difference for me getting the corruption message after running Netflix. So if you run maintenance mode and get your Wii back up and running, you might try going into your message board and deleting pretty much everything, but y'know, don't expect too much.  Cheers!"

I have an old SNES which he's played with, but he gives up quickly. Same with the DS, he just ended up wanting to watch me play it instead. He is getting older now, and all his friends have game consoles. His best buddy at school is already playing Call of Duty! I don't want him to be left behind- all the boys his age seem to have consoles. Wii Mini seems better suited for younger children which I think fits with something he could use"

This is a little different, but have you thought of getting some board games? Boardgames are getting really popular again, even with youngsters. My little brothers who are much younger than me and in grade school are into them.  Maybe he'd find boardgames to be more fun because there is generally a set of rules to strictly follow, rather than the open ended nature of many/most video games.

You don't really need to play the other two to get the story and the trilogy pack is super expensive. Prime 3 however is super cheap, about $10.

It has all kinds of downloads from fat32 formatter for your computer, and all the way to applications for your wii (like emulators or homebrew channel). You can find a bunch of guides online."
wii,2q3pid,Saysbadman,1 point,Tue Dec 23 03:02:42 2014 UTC,I'm just afraid of bricking the wii.  Hmm...
wii,2q3pid,frisch85,1 point,Tue Dec 23 08:03:25 2014 UTC,modmii has a pretty good manual that even idiots would be able to understand and iirc you'll hardly be able to brick the wii using modmii. My tip here is to first read the whole manual and afterwards start it again while simultanously doing the steps to mod your wii. I always read whole instructions first before operating something just in case of safety.

wii,2q28qg,XxXGodXxX,2,Mon Dec 22 23:23:18 2014 UTC,I came here to say Tatsunoko v.s. Capcom but it seems you have shit taste. Anyways guilty gear and smash bros are the only other decent fighters on the wii. Soul caliber II and Smash bros. melee if your wii is backwards compatible.

wii,2q28qg,Cairnstorm,1 point,Tue Dec 23 10:23:28 2014 UTC,"The thing with this game that i think is turning you off most that you may not have realized is it is very beginner friendly. Meaning you can do exactly what you described, but this game is pretty deep and you should definitely give it another try. It's very similar to Marvel Vs Capcom 3 if you've played that game or watched high level play of it. They both have very easy beginner level combos and tactics but the more competitive aspects can be easily missed."

The Plus version has some additional content, but it's a little harder to come by these days. If you don't want to hunt down a copy of Plus, vanilla Accent Core can be found for about $15 or so."

Am I right?"
wii,2p8mne,shelcod,3,Sun Dec 14 05:42:00 2014 UTC,"Not in stores generally, no. They are no longer being produced, and most major chains stopped carrying them somewhere around a year ago. If you check GameStop's website for local stock of Classic Controller Pros, you may win the lottery for your city and find that one or two nearby-ish locations still have a new one or two in stock in the back somewhere for the original $20 MSRP, but most locations seem to be well past having been picked over at this point. Your best bet now is checking Craigslist, eBay, or shopgoodwill.com for some now, since they were very, very common. They're still very much in demand now, so $30 for a used one seems to be the going rate for them these days, but deals on them are hardly impossible. I bought one that looked virtually unused from a pawn shop for $3, and the same sort of deal could be a possibility on Craigslist.  I will say for my part that yes, the D-pad is great, and feels like a slight improvement over the D-pad on the original Classic Controller in some way that I can't quite identify. I've never really had a problem with the D-pad on the original CC though, so if your CC isn't one of those bootleg ones missing the Wii logo on it, I don't know that you'll see too much of a difference. The real main improvements to the CC Pro are that the handles provide much better ergonomics, the L-R-Z buttons layout is much better, and the analog sticks are spaced out to be closer to your thumbs. The CC Pro may be my favorite controller ever made for retro games, though. Good luck searching!"
wii,2p8mne,bigsphinxofquartz,1 point,Sun Dec 14 06:29:23 2014 UTC,"Darn, so does the CCP D-pad still feel cheap and is hard to go diagonal?"
wii,2p8mne,bigsphinxofquartz,1 point,Sun Dec 14 07:05:11 2014 UTC,"Not at all. Neither feel too cheap to me, but the CC Pro's matte surfaces on the back maybe make it feel a bit less cheap? I've honestly never had a problem doing diagonals on either of them. I just tested their D-pads side by side, and the best stab at the difference that I can make is that maybe the D-pad on the CC Pro feels a bit less raised and a bit more comfortable? It feels a bit more ""mushy"" to me in a positive way, a way that reminds me of NES and SNES controllers. It seems like maybe the center of the D-pad may have a slightly more pronounced dimple or downward slope than the original CC did, but if there is a change, it's very subtle. I think that to the extent that there is a change on the D-pad, it is among the things that subconsciously causes me to favor the CC Pro, but above everything, it's those handles that are the big improvement. That, and the curved back of the original CC made my hands cramp out after using it for a while."
wii,2p8mne,Azul788,1 point,Sun Dec 14 07:23:54 2014 UTC,"OK, that mushy feeling is what I was hoping for. I live in a fairly small Canadian town that happens to have 2 EB Games. So maybe they will have some left over."
wii,2p8mne,RH2427,2,Sun Dec 14 07:30:21 2014 UTC,"The Classic Controller has one of the best D-pads I've ever used, and I've used a damn lot of them. Regardless of how you feel about them though, the CCP's D-Pad is the exact same."
wii,2p8mne,dzenebetice,1 point,Sun Dec 14 17:27:48 2014 UTC,"They've been discontinued in the big box retail stores like Walmart and Target, and are known to be out of production from the manufacturer. If you're willing to settle for used or generic controllers, you can find them cheap. If you want the real Nintendo official one in new condition, you might have to pay more than MSRP from a reseller from an American website.  I just looked and the listing on Play-Asia has them listed for a very reasonable price (before shipping costs). I believe this is an official Japanese version of the CCP. Don't worry about it being in a Japanese retail box because all Wii/Wii U controllers and accessories are region-free (with the exception of the Wii U Gamepad)."

I love mine."

Quite an interesting approach.  However, why complicate the solution? To me, by far the best and most simple solution was produced on the Wii wheel by Nintendo. It is not the tightness that secures the Wiimote, but if you look closely enough, it is the four little spongey-rubbery pads on each side of the Wheel which create friction when the Wiimote is inserted into place.  This is the interior of RE Magnum, and it doesn't even use that, yet it still holds the Wiimote completely tight when closed https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/62424385/element-3b.jpg"

I've still got a backlog of nearly 40 Wii games that I haven't played yet, so if there are other people out there with a stack of unplayed games we could do a kind of backlog blast; same format as the book club idea, but with the aim of getting our backlogs down a bit. We could start with the games that most of us have in common, and work down from there. That would depend on if there are enough people with enough games in their backlog to make it worth it though."

wii,2o1n7u,Ta-Kumsawa,3,Tue Dec 2 13:59:58 2014 UTC,Mario Kart can be played with 4 players with 4 Wiimotes (held on their side and used like steering wheels) Wiimotes with nunchucks (If you're not a fan of wiimote steering) or 4 classic controllers if you're more of a traditionalist. Or any combination thereof. Classic controllers plug into the wiimotes so you will need at least as many wiimotes as you want classic controllers.  So the absolute minimum for 4 player Mario Kart is 4 wiimotes.
wii,2o1n7u,The_Darknut_Rises,1 point,Tue Dec 2 14:13:26 2014 UTC,Thank You very much for such a quick and full answer. Are You maybe aware how it looks when playing in Mario Galaxy 2 with two players.
wii,2o1n7u,The_Darknut_Rises,3,Tue Dec 2 14:30:54 2014 UTC,"Player one needs a Wiimote and nunchuck, Player two needs a wiimote and a good book for when they get bored of what boils down to watching someone else play the game while they occasionally point at enemies to hold them in place."
wii,2o1n7u,ivaerak,1 point,Tue Dec 2 14:33:23 2014 UTC,"lol cmoon, being player 2 is pretty cool, you can collect and shoot stars like a first person shooter, and affect enemies, at least that is like in Mario Galaxy 1, and I love this kind of ""asymetrical"" co-op."
wii,2o1n7u,BangkokPadang,1 point,Tue Dec 2 19:22:08 2014 UTC,"The 2nd player mode in MG1 and MG2 is for children who are just old enough that they can't be fooled into thinking they're playing by being handed an unplugged controller anymore, and need an absolutely bare minimum of interaction and influence to be sated."
wii,2o1n7u,ivaerak,0,Tue Dec 2 22:48:36 2014 UTC,"Okay I can understand your point of view, if you are looking for hard core co-op interaction for both players equally, Galaxy doesn't have that. But to me it is honestly cool fun when playing the 2nd player in local multiplayer in smg, and I'm an adult. It's just a simple, layedback partaking, great for socializing with a friend.  I mean you can say this ""fooled into thinking you are interacting"" stuff for any game, take Last of us, basically the game is designed to fool you into thinking that you are actually cautiously escorting another human being somewhere, yet the enemies couldn't care less about your escort lol."
wii,2o1n7u,GoldMoat,3,Fri Dec 5 08:48:21 2014 UTC,"To clarify what others have said about Galaxy 2, don't buy it to play multiplayer. It's not bad, but it's very limited and more of an afterthought. The second player can just do little things to help player one, but they're very little and not very useful altogether. It really is a single player game at its core. But Mario Kart is a really good choice and only needs an additional Wii Remote per player, nothing more (unless you want to add more).  If you're looking for a good family multiplayer game, I'd highly recommend Boom Blox, Wii Sports Resort, Super Smash Bros Brawl, or most especially Kirby's Return to Dreamland. These are all matters of personal preference though, and there are lots more good multiplayer games out there.  For Kirby you only need one Wii Remote per player. No other controllers are necessary or possible.  Smash Bros can be played with Wii Remotes only but it's more fun with Classic Controllers for each player.  Boom Blox only really needs one Wii remote total for most of its game modes, from what I can remember. You don't even need extras for each player because most of the game modes are turn based; if you wanted its full value, though, you'll need more Wii Remotes.  Wii Sports Resort can also be played with Wii Remotes only, although you'll absolutely need to have the somewhat newer Wii Remote Pluses and not the older ones in order for it to work. And you'll miss out on a couple of the games if you don't buy more nunchucks but it's still plenty of fun without them.  In short, all of those games I listed can be played at bare minimum with just Wii Remotes, but nunchucks and classic controllers can enhance the experiences. Hope that wasn't too much info, but I just wanted to be helpful. If I'm wrong on any of these things I hope someone will let me know. Good luck and Merry Christmas!"

The difference between a regular CPU and an Amiibo is that an Amiibo will remember everything that happened in a battle.

wii,2nb1h3,BangkokPadang,1 point,Mon Nov 24 22:17:36 2014 UTC,Really inspiring! Did you have any nintendo games or machines when you were a kid? Also congrats! :)
wii,2nb1h3,placeholder,3,Mon Nov 24 23:14:25 2014 UTC,"Yeah I had an NES, SNES, and N64 as a little kid. For reference, I'm 29 now.  Then I bought a Dreamcast and a PS2 and became a cynical teenager, and suddenly Nintendo products seemed a little to childish for me.  Gradually I got an xbox and then built my own computer.  I never owned a Gamecube or a Wii (until I bought the one I own now in 2010) and have since realized that as much fun as I have playing hardcore games and engaging in a long single player campaign, the most fun I truly have with video games is when 3 or 4 people get together to play wii sports and Sonic and Mario Olympics and just flail around and have silly fun in the same room together.  Any other console you have to explain to non gamers how to play. The wii lets people who aren't ""Gamers"" just start flailing their arms and still engage and have fun.  The cynic in me sees this as being a little bit ridiculous, but the person I'm growing into sees this as being a wonderful thing that can bring anyone in a diverse group of people into silly fits of laughter together. What could be nicer than that?"

Not only motion controls but the ability to play classics through online downloads and backwards compatibility. The wii was nintendos first widely available online console (outside of the few GameCube titles that took advantage of online). It also brought me a lot of joy seeing people playing in the same room just like the old days when only local multiplayer existed. I think wii sports was the primary reason families and friends started getting together person to play the wii."

The Wii came out, and as supplies were short, we had to wait about 4 months after the release to get one.... but it was worth it.  Why would I buy one now?  Easy to soft-mod, LOTS of homebrew is being made, LARGE community of support for it ongoing, even if Nintendo is shutting the doors to online games."

Homebrew allows developers and game makers to make games when they don't have access to lay down several hundred or thousand for an 'official' developer station from Nintendo, and lets them get their feet wet and an idea of programming and game making.  Homebrew also allows a central share point for people to share out their homebrew games and apps for everyone else to use/play/enjoy."

Before the Wii I would occasionally get together with friends and play old NES games or something but I usually just stuck to the newest gen console.  Once I got the Wii it was so easy to play old games through the virtual console that I probably used it about 50% for new titles and 50% for VC titles.

wii,2nb1h3,The_Alpha_DragNaut,1 point,Tue Nov 25 03:16:53 2014 UTC,I've always been a Nintendo person so the Wii was a day 1 purchase. I was really looking forward to Zelda in 480p widescreen (the wiimote controls never bothered me). I had high expectations given it was following the N64 and GCN and it fulfilled half of that with its first party games. The promise of Virtual Console was so enticing.
wii,2nb1h3,killcrew,1 point,Tue Nov 25 00:48:24 2014 UTC,"I didn't buy one. My Wifes family bought one primarily for Wii Sports, and I'm not sure they bought more than two or three games for it total.  Once they got bored of it I modded it and threw on a few emulators, and used it to play snes games. Even then, I very rarely get any use out of it, and could probably stand to look up some decent games.  I get a lot more use out of my ps3, but even then I use it for emulation and as a media center. I barely have any actual games for it, and it's rarely worth buying any without first researching if I'd need to upgrade the console, or if online is required to play, or things like that. Sony hasn't been very friendly to the modding scene, and if I have to make a choice between buying new games or keeping my emulators, I'm going to pick the emulators every time.  (Kind of funny, come to think of it. If they just stepped back and let me mod my ps3 without fear that they'll stop letting me play games, I'd probably buy more games, knowing that I'd actually have the ability to play them.)"

I'm a great arcade fan, used to play a lot of Hotd2 light-gun cabinet in the local mall, so actually prior to buying the Wii I first bought RE Umbrella Chronicles, then the RE Magnum & Knife bundle and then the Wii.

Games that I know how to play in real life (baseball, hockey, golf, tennis) I basically could not figure out the controls on.

I believe it retains everything that could not be transferred over, like the YouTube/Amazon channels.  I can only assume Nintendo saw the message board features as redundant, being that the Wii U has an improved friends list, messaging (Miiverse), and video chat.

It can show an entirely different image, so one player sees something the others cannot. It's also motion sensitive and can work like a scanner or viewfinder.  The TV mirror feature is also nice if you want to play games while someone else is watching television. And being backwards compatible means you can play all those Wii games you might have missed."

The controller with a screen can do all sorts, it's a touch screen so you can draw etc in some games, it has a motion sensor so you can tilt it and make things in the game move and it can duplicate the image on TV, meaning someone can watch TV and keep playing.  Most importantly though, it plays all old wii games. So you can get a wii remote controller and some games and play whatever wii games you want all the way back to 2006."

wii,2mf14c,idkmybffljill,3,Sat Nov 15 22:48:45 2014 UTC,Yes its very possible.  First Update to 4.3u  Home Brew Instructions:  -Go here and enter your mac address. Download the letter bomb.  http://please.hackmii.com/  -Place it on your card and boot up the Wii. Next go to your messages and look for the letter bomb icon could be on the next day or the day before. Start the letterbomb and follow the onscreen instructions. After you are done you should have the Wii Homebrew Chanel.  Disclaimer Use PriiLoader or Bootmii before the following to backup your Wii in case anything goes wrong.  USB Loader GX Instructions:  -Next add this to your SD card. Put the stuff in \apps into the SD:\apps folder the wad folder in the root and the iso236.wad file in the root. https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jls1z26agz003u0/AAC3_FeE00dZpG2HhoF5QDzea?dl=0  -Go to the Homebrew channel and run the iso236 program. Use the wad file from sd card.  -Use the Wad manager next (Its not in english but A to go forward B to go back)  -Select the 236 Option and install the 247-250 in order  -Next install the Forwarder if you want the USB Loader Channel(Otherwise you can access it from the Homebrew Channel)  That will get your USB Loader GX all setup.  Plop your Wii game backup on the SD card and it should run. I personally use a usb drive though through WBFS manager so not too sure how to get your Smash backup to work on SD Card maybe someone here can help?  -edit- just realized you have hombrew already so just skip first step

wii,2mdbs1,XerSOn,3,Sat Nov 15 10:12:16 2014 UTC,"Although it is always good to have the latest version of your loader software for stability's sake, the version of USB loader you're using actually doesn't have anything to do with the particular issue of loading MPT from the start of the disk.  You want to install a newer version of cIOSes.  I too have been softmodded since the days of using alt dols to run troublesome games, but those days are no more.  https://code.google.com/p/d2x-cios/downloads/detail?name=d2x-v10-beta53-alt.zip&can=2&q=  This page has the latest cIOS files, which are full of wonderful functionality that Wananinko and Hermes cIOS files didn't have.  With this installed and the latest version of Wiiflow (which I discovered, after using CFG for 3 years, is much nicer in appearance, more feature-packed, and more functional when loading Gamecube games, since you can configure individual games to use different loaders, such as dios miss for one game and nintendon't for another.) I am happy to announce that you can now load the ISO for Metroid Prime Trilogy just like you do every other game.  What a time to be alive."
wii,2mdbs1,BangkokPadang,1 point,Sat Nov 15 15:16:42 2014 UTC,"Awesome. Thank you. Will I have to install the usb loader again after the install of the ciso? Thank you for your help! Will I lose my save files? Also, do you know any simple guide on how to install it for simple people like me who don't understand too much in how the Wii system files work."
wii,2mdbs1,BangkokPadang,3,Sat Nov 15 15:34:49 2014 UTC,"All your save files for your games, and all your configuration files for your USB Loader will be safe and sound. You won't have to reinstall anything else.  I actually just wrote up a simple guide for another guide who needs these files.    It sounds like you did not add the correct cIOS files. This is basically the custom system files you need to launch retail Wii Games from your HDD. Here are the Instructions.   Put your SD card into your computer You need to download the D2X CIOS INSTALLER Extract it into the apps folder of your sd card. Extract D2X-V10-BETA53-ALT.ZIP to your sd card or usb device into the folder /apps/d2x-cios-installer. Put your SD card into your Wii, and turn it on Open HomebrewChannel and launch the D2X cIOS Installer Your cursor will be on the cIOS D2X Version. Use the D-Pad to change it to the newest version (all the way to the right).   Move down, and change the IOS Base to 56   Move down again, and change the IOS to slot 249.   This version is only used by the Wii when checking updates. Set the version to maximum (65535).   You are now ready to install, so press A to continue. You will land on an overview with the available cIOS slots. The slot you just selected should be blinking. Several other slots may be highlighted in red.   Press A to start the installation.   Wait for the progress to complete.   Once it finishes, you will land on another IOS overview screen. Your freshly installed cIOS should be highlighted in a green color.   Press the A button to go back to the configuration screen.   Next, you want to configure the second cIOS. This time, use base 57, and slot 250.   Again, press A to install it and wait for the process to finish.   Once everything is installed, press B to exit the application.  Please be aware that this tutorial has you install the CIOS files which are better for USB loading your games. If you have any interest in NAND emulation, you should probably read the details about choosing your CIOS files, which can be found HERE.  Additionally, more detailed instructions about the install process can be found HERE.  Good Luck!!    Afterwards, you may need to go into CFG USB Loader's settings and make sure that iOS 249 is chosen as the default iOS games are launched with, since that is the one you just updated.  You should also go into the settings for Metroid Prime Trilogy to make sure it is pointed at iOS 249 (since you probably have one of Hermes cIOS 222/223/224 loading its alt dol. Also, either point CFG USB Loader at the regular .dol file or disable loading from an alternate .dol altogether for Metroid Prime Trilogy. You don't need to load the alt one anymore.  If, after you install the cIOS files and update CFG USB Loader's settings it still does not work, I recommend switching to WiiFlow, which can be downloaded from HERE"
wii,2mdbs1,BangkokPadang,1 point,Sat Nov 15 15:55:38 2014 UTC,You are awesome. Thank you so so much!! And then I should just install wiiflow?
wii,2mdbs1,BangkokPadang,1 point,Sat Nov 15 16:03:07 2014 UTC,"That depends.  If USB Loader correctly launches MPT after installing the correct cIOS files, then I would say keep using it. You're familiar with it and it is already set up.  However, If you have a whole day to get everything set up, have a need to install multiple GameCube launchers, and want to end up with a nicer looking loader, then I would say switch to Wiiflow.  At the end of the day it is really what you are comfortable with. Just keep in mind setting Wiiflow up for multiple Gamecube loaders is fairly complicated, because you have to initialize the loaders (it gets especially complicated if you use Devolution to play games with streaming audio)."

wii,2lqu4n,Zakworm1,2,Sun Nov 9 07:06:59 2014 UTC,"I use wjoy and program it with Controllermate  Both work in 10.10 Yosemite, and wjoy is completely free. It lives in your task bar at the top and has easy syncing for your wiimotes. It also has native support for your classic controllers (even supporting the analog shoulder buttons on the original classic controllers)  As far as Controllermate, it costs @20, but it is my single favorite piece of OS X software out there. I have used it to program individual, detailed control sets for one controller for countless programs. I use my Classic controller to play Super Meat Boy, OlliOlli, and even for several FPS games. It automagically detects what software is currently running (whether it is running in front, in back, or just running at all depending on what I want) and loads the appropriate configurations. Controller mate has a wonderful set of options, and it even has 100% programmable acceleration curves for mapping your joysticks to mouse axis so you can make first person shooters feel PERFECT for yourself. I'm currently playing through Bungie's Marathon series, (which has notoriously poor mouse-look support) and it feels phenomenal the way I have it set up. I would never ever go without controller mate on any mac I own from here on out.  It also lets you program any midi devices, and even create a myriad of keyboard shortcuts based on timing, holding keys, double and triple clicking certain keys, etc. I use it in Garage Band and Logic as well as to have universal control over my iTunes controls.   It is phenomenal."

wii,2lont8,BangkokPadang,2,Sat Nov 8 16:48:52 2014 UTC,"Honestly, man, they're pretty finicky.  The issue you're trying to avoid is an enclosure and/or a drive with a power saving feature that spins the drive down when not in use. If this happens, it causes a buffer underrun problem the next time the wii tries to seek the drive, and it freezes up and crashes.  For example, in Twilight Princess, it seems to load each ""area"" along with all its resources at once. If your drive spins down, and you try to walk into the next area, your wii will crash because it is expecting a near-immediate response from the disk drive, and when this doesn't happen it locks up completely.  Flash drives generally don't have this problem, but are smaller.  I tried several enclosures, and finally found a simple tech pro drive with a 1tb drive that works perfectly."
wii,2lont8,BangkokPadang,1 point,Sat Nov 8 19:54:23 2014 UTC,Thanks for the tip.  What would your recommendation be for most space for around $40-$50?  Flash drive or external?  The hard drives I'd be using are cheap so they probably won't work right?

wii,2lgde2,ivaerak,2,Fri Nov 7 03:47:41 2014 UTC,"I bought this same exact bundle. Let me tell you, it is worth it for the looks alone. It DOES look & feel badass when holding it. However, the built is not made from the same quality material as was shown on E3 2010 (http://youtu.be/o7ESaiTDiEo). The feel is more plastic than in this video, and in my case, the inner ""slider"" part of the gun that activates the Wiimote's B button, broke, cause it's a very thin plastic part, so I am looking to make a metal replacement for this part, or a 3D printout of that part but from a stronger material. You can see on this photo of mine : https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/62424385/element-3b.jpg that the breakage occured between the trigger and the rest of this long really thin slider.   I played Umbrella Chronicles very heavily with this thing, and it broke right about when I reached 80% of the campaign.  One more thing. Slicing zombies with melee attacks by slicing the knife through the air with the nunchuck, and then shooting from the gun with the other hand, it's just great classic arcade immersion right there.  edit: other than that, I researched extensively prior to buying this, and my choice would also fall on the following two models:  1)  http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B003500VLK/ref=s9_wsim_gw_p63_d99_i3?pf_rd_m=A3JWKAKR8XB7XF&pf_rd_s=center-3&pf_rd_r=15ZE5TH4X6RQCDW4WDG8&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=463375153&pf_rd_i=301128 (This one has built-in wiimote, it is NOT the shell, it is the real deal, as real as it gets :))  2)  http://www.amazon.de/BigBen-Wii-Pistole-Walther-P99/dp/B0041NWAT6/ref=pd_bxgy_ce_img_z (This one is the shell, just like the ""Resident Evil"" one)"

The little metal spring in the picture (https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/62424385/element-3b.jpg), it made pulling of the trigger too stiff, so I replaced it with a softer one (I used the spring that you can find in any generic pen).

This one.  I have some pistol looking thing, and I don't like it.  Generally Shooters use B for the trigger, which you'd expect a trigger to be, you know, where a trigger is on a gun."
wii,2lgde2,BangkokPadang,1 point,Thu Nov 6 15:03:55 2014 UTC,"The nintendo one feels awkward and backwards when you're holding it.  In order to use the joystick with my left hand, I have to hold the back end with my left hand, and aim with the right hand which feels weird. (as a right-handed person).  If I try and use my right thumb to move the joystick, this feels weird too.  Additionally, pulling the trigger with my frontmost hand feels strangest of all...  There has got to be one which lets you pull the trigger with your right trigger finger near the back of the gun, that also allows you to hold the gun with your left hand near the front, and work the nunchuck's joystick.  Otherwise, any single gun solution, such as the blue and white one from Nyko that looks like a pistol is soon much nicer to use (minus having the analog joystick control, of course)."
wii,2lgde2,crashdummie,1 point,Fri Nov 7 00:50:46 2014 UTC,I just checked the sizes and you are correct; both types of controllers are the same size. I don't know why I thought the Plus controllers were bigger

The only games remotely worth bothering with that require Motion Plus are Skyward Sword, Wii Sports Resort and Red Steel 2. There are many better games where it doesn't make the slightest difference.  Games that use the nunchuk you should check out are Twilight Princess and the Mario Galaxies."
wii,2lddqr,bokonos,3,Wed Nov 5 20:47:00 2014 UTC,"The nunchuck is used in a lot of games - so it's worthwhile to have one of those. The motion plus has very few uses, and I don't think it adds any ""sensitivity"" to games that weren't designed for it."

However, a remote with motion plus is $15, which means that you get a savings of $20 if you buy from your boss. What I would do would be buy from your boss for the nunchuck, sell the extra remote or keep it for a backup, but get the remote plus either way."

Honestly if you consider Reddit a factual source, the Wii had the least hardware failures of the generation from what I've seen.  [Edit] I haven't checked US prices lately, but if you only want homebrew channel it may be cheaper to import a used console from eBay or something.

A used wii with one controller and nunchuck (which come with any Wii, and yes, that includes WM+ - you lose points if the WM+ isn't built in), a used Wii balance board and a 2GB microSD card. And a cheap plastic steering wheel.  So, basically: this. $50. Except that comes with four Wiimotes.  Oh, my bad - a used 2GB microSD card as well.

Yeah, well I could play a Fist of the North Star game for that if that's all you're going to tell me. Detail, people, detail!  The combat is clunky? How? How does the game play? Why would anyone call it frustrating instead of challenging?  And if I'm not looking for something terrifying or action-packed, why is there so much combat and why did you compare it to Silent Freakin' Hill?!  I'm not going to sugar-coat this!

You don't really learn anything about the apocalypse itself until the end of the game.  The combat is clunky because it's just...clunky. Slow-paced, difficult to aim, and difficult to hit.

wii,2ii1fo,snivybeatseverything,2,Mon Oct 6 23:28:16 2014 UTC,Did you try it on a different TV? is the TV HD?
wii,2ii1fo,Will12239,1 point,Tue Oct 7 17:23:44 2014 UTC,I've tried it on every tv in my house. 2 old sd crts and one fairly new hd.
wii,2ii1fo,mylittlenpc,1 point,Tue Oct 7 17:54:42 2014 UTC,My guess would be that the system is set to 480p (requires component video) and you're trying to use a composite av cable (you said you just replaced the av cable).
wii,2ii1fo,mylittlenpc,1 point,Tue Oct 7 19:28:32 2014 UTC,"the cable im using is a composite. red, yellow, and white connectors. so if i get a component cable i should get video? and then can i switch it back to using composite?"
wii,2ii1fo,mylittlenpc,1 point,Tue Oct 7 19:39:47 2014 UTC,"Was it hooked up using component before?  If yes, then yeah, that's probably all you need to do.  The system is trying to output 480p, which isn't possible through composite.  You should be able to snag some wii component cables online for pretty cheap."
wii,2ii1fo,mylittlenpc,1 point,Tue Oct 7 20:04:04 2014 UTC,"Ok, I got a composite cable and I'm getting a video signals now but how do I switch it to output through component? I've went through all the settings and couldn't get it to work."
wii,2ii1fo,mylittlenpc,1 point,Wed Oct 8 22:17:53 2014 UTC,"I assume you mean ""how do I switch it to output through composite"" since that's what wasn't working before.  Click on the ""Wii"" button in the lower left corner of the screen.  Find ""TV Settings"" and you should see options for resolution and aspect ratio.  Set resolution to 480i (480p only works through component cables, 480i works through both).  I'm assuming you're going to plug this into an old standard definition TV (hence why you're using composite instead of component), so go ahead and set the aspect ratio to 4:3 while you're at it."

wii,2ibxwn,BangkokPadang,3,Mon Oct 6 06:13:56 2014 UTC,"If your wii is softmodded, you can actually load the game through a USB loader (you can still load it from the disc if you don't have external storage) and use the ""no more memory"" (aka NMM) function built in to simulate a memory card.  Wind Waker works with this, and it will just write the save file to your SD card."

wii,2ibxwn,IAmTheBauss,1 point,Mon Oct 6 06:13:44 2014 UTC,"I take it your Wii isn't soft-modded yet? Personally, I used ModMii and it was surprisingly easy to do. You download ModMii and then run it. ModMii will ask you a few questions (what system version your Wii is, which way you want to mod your Wii, which USB loader you want, ect) and then it'll download all of the files you need and place them correctly on your SD card and USB. It will also put together a guide for you to follow.   There are also written guides in the side bar here and and at /r/wiihacks."

EDIT: It turns out that Wiiflow/DIOS MIOS comes with NMM but it's not compatible with Super Smash Bros. Melee."
wii,2i9yd4,ivaerak,4,Sat Oct 4 14:03:53 2014 UTC,"Your concerns about softmodding at this point likely come from a place of misunderstanding, and are completely unfounded.  What you're saying is like ""I don't want to risk stepping on any Legos, so I'll only play with the red ones.""  It's like taking the red pill in the matrix, but saying you don't want to do any badass flips and/or slow motion kung fu.  First, do a bit of research, then keep your current homebrew channel installation, install the cIOS v10 r53 package and Install priiloader, along with the hacks_hash.ini file, and disable both online updates and disc updates so it will never ask you to update.  Then don't do anything else if you don't want, or go ahead and enjoy all the benefits of having it modded.  For me, the greatest benefit is having all my discs loaded onto a hard drive, so my copies of Smash and Metroid Prime Trilogy never have to even risk a scratch.  The cost of the whole system is worth less than the value of a single high-dollar game.    But, if you do decide not to install priiloader to disable disc updates, then if you do update it will not brick your wii, as long as your homebrew channel is 1.8 or higher.  If your home-brew channel is 1.8 or higher, everything is handled by a modified cIOS 249, and updating from this cannot brick your wii, and the only thing the final update will do is stub any cIOSes that aren't stock.  I did this myself from a fully modded 4.2U system menu to the latest 4.3U. I only had to reinstall the cIOS v10 r53 cIOS pack and everything else was still on my SD card, and worked just like it always did, except now I have the latest wii system menu.  Your home-brew channel will even still be there after the update, although you may need to reconfigure your wifi settings to work with wiimfi."
wii,2i9yd4,BangkokPadang,1 point,Sun Oct 5 01:21:00 2014 UTC,And bootmii - if he's going to install priiloader and mod properly then there's no reason to not 'trust' bootmi.
wii,2i9yd4,zfa,1 point,Sun Oct 5 04:12:18 2014 UTC,"Yes I agree, and thanks for the pointers. I did and still am deeply researching on the Homebrew, it took me 1 month of intense reading on it just to feel okay with even installing only the HBC. The problem is most articles don't really explain what is it from the inside, what happens in the code and where in the system code/firmware it makes the changes.   Most tutorials and wikias just outline on how to install it and the numerous possibilities these applications provide once you install them. However, they do say that once you install the HBC, there are really no ways to uninstall it completely. That there will always be traces of it left on the system.   Now I don't know does this refer to the BootMii/Priiloader and similar installs, or only the HBC? I am guessng that the exploit methods themselves (like LetterBomb for instance) don't do anything permanent to the system other then opening it up. Most apps are on SD card so they probably don't do anything permanent neither. Only installs leave something permanent I guess?  The thread http://forum.wii-homebrew.com/index.php/Thread/8260-Einleitung-und-Basiswissen/ and links from there are the most detailed and informative I have found so far, even though it is a bit hard to understand for me using Google translate. It provides history of the HBC, and even touches the code specific principles of how the exploits work. However I have yet to understand how exactly is HBC ""nested"" in the system, in form of code, that is why I thought it was an IOS, since my LetterBomb installer.log txt file says in the beginning:  ""launching IOS 58 for the installer... IOS launched... IOS versions: Installer: 58, HBC: 0""   and then later when it finished:  ""Using IOS versions: Installer: 58, HBC: 58""  When I open it, in my HBC it says ""1.1.2, IOS58 v24.32"". Normally I would think that version ""1.8"" which you mentioned would be a newer one, but I'm guessing you ment ""1.0.8""? Because according to http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Homebrew_Channel#Changelog the version ""1.1.2"" is the most recent one. Am I correct, or is the version 1.8 a newer one?  I will try my luck this time and use the method of having the most recent HBC and run the update once the disc asks me, and see what happens. I will post the result once I get the Skyward Sword, it might take a while, maybe months from now."
wii,2i9yd4,zfa,2,Sun Oct 5 05:32:25 2014 UTC,"It will likely uninstall your cioses if you have any and possibly uninstall the homebrew channel (this is not installed as an iOS, in answer to your question).  Now on to some advice from an old hand.  Firstly you should have installed bootmii add it allows you to recover a bricked system. Not doing so because you only want to install the minimum is misguided and foolish. If an update did break your system with that installed you could recover, without it you're screwed.  Next you should also have priiloader installed - this has a setting to disable disc updates which can break your mod. Again I'll stress if you mod a system do it properly and fully, don't just cherry pick based on what bits you think you want or need.  Finally, in your situation you could just run an update now online (if that still works) and then remod once you're at the latest version if the homebrew channel were to be deleted. There will be no further updates to what the latest is at this time so you will not encounter any of these disc updates even if you don't bother with priiloader, bootmii etc."
wii,2i9yd4,zfa,2,Sat Oct 4 21:26:23 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the informations. I need to confirm differently however, regarding the system update. I did have the latest 4.3E and afterwards bought Black Ops, and the disc asked me to update nevertheless. I believe these disc update prompts are built into the disc and made mandatory regardless of the system version."
wii,2i9yd4,zfa,2,Sun Oct 5 05:39:36 2014 UTC,"That isn't the case - things are slightly more complicated... Some discs have new or updated ioses on them which you may not have even if you have system menu 4.3. However if these ioses are installed either by other discs, or online, or manually via modding tools such as iOS downloader or modmii or simply by wad files obtained from any other source then the disc does not update them again.  4.3 is simply the system menu version and not the version of the whole system (iOS 56 could be delivered on disc, say, but didn't necessarily bump your system level). There isn't an 'overall version' you can quote simply.  Black ops will have patched an iOS but you could have done this manually via modmii, say and it would not have done so. Because you're at the latest system menu does not mean you have the latest ioses. However the fact that the Wii is effectively eol is why I now say it is unlikely to receive patches (be this ioses, system menu, or other channels) not because you're running 4.3.  This is why personally if i mod a system i do so fully, including updating all the official ioses so I know an update is never (fingers crossed) going to be applied and undo any of my work or brick anything. If your system was modded in this manner then Skyward Sword would update nothing at all, even without a Priloader block on updates as it wouldn't need to."

wii,2i3p4e,ivaerak,2,Fri Oct 3 15:29:05 2014 UTC,"Yes I had this happen to me few times before. I even have a video of it somewhere, I might upload it for future reference, if I find it.   My Wii was never modded and bought brand new unsealed in early 2013 and I used it maybe for 6 months when this happened. It happened only during Mario Kart Wii online play. I used to think it had to do with hackers over-spamming the race with items. One time it was the high pitched buzzing sound, the other time the sound was just looping the short sequence of the background song from the game.  One word of advice: before unplugging the power cord, did you try to press & hold the power button on the console for 5 seconds? It might turn off the console without the need to unplug the cord.  I cannot help regarding what is causing this, but I suspect that it is the Wii's memory issue, and therefore, completely normal. Because it reminds me of the Wii Internet Channel - it also freezes up and makes everything unresponsive if you try to visit heavily coded web sites.  Edit: Okay I found both videos. First is buzzing sound coming from console: http://youtu.be/0ZnrN77y0k8 the second is track loop coming from game (I guess a normal freeze): http://youtu.be/f07R6qR0OPo"
wii,2i3p4e,ivaerak,2,Sun Oct 5 20:29:04 2014 UTC,"Yeah, my issue is what's happening in the first video.  I don't think that holding the power button down for 5 seconds turns the console off, either."
wii,2i3p4e,Bladley,2,Mon Oct 6 12:36:21 2014 UTC,"I agree, in my case I couldn't power it off with holding the power button either.   Other than that I can only advise to get an extension cord with a power switch on it, I think it is much safer to shut the electricity down with the switch on the cord than by pulling the plug directly from the socket, cause of surge of voltage."

wii,2hqm83,BangkokPadang,3,Sun Sep 28 23:31:10 2014 UTC,"Wow you responded quick. I was in the middle of researching an answer and you got back within the 4 minutes it took me to find one.  You can install Priiloader (which was probably already part of your homebrew installation if you followed a good quality guide) which will allow for a password to be required before it boots into the Wii System Menu.  Additionally, the Wii System Menu has an option to require a PIN number, which you could probably use to accomplish the same thing."
wii,2hqm83,BangkokPadang,2,Sun Sep 28 23:35:10 2014 UTC,The Parental Controls PIN doesn't allow locking of channels. It just locks games of a certain rating.
wii,2hqm83,BangkokPadang,3,Sun Sep 28 23:38:39 2014 UTC,"Ahh.  What about Priiloader's Password protection? Did you try that?  I think it is ""protect auto boot."" or something similar to that."
wii,2hqm83,BangkokPadang,1 point,Sun Sep 28 23:42:34 2014 UTC,"I'm trying to figure it out right now. Apparently I need to create a password.txt, which I thought I did, but it doesn't open for whatever reason. It's telling me it's just unable.  EDIT: I set on Protect Auto Boot but it says this could lock me out of the Wii. It didn't ask me to input a password or anything so I'm afraid of shutting down."
wii,2hqm83,Vikingfruit,2,Sun Sep 28 23:53:52 2014 UTC,"Yeah, this solution can conceivably lock you out of your wii temporarily, but not permanently. There is a ""backdoor"" solution built in for when this happens, which I will explain shortly. But first, about the password.txt file:  On the first line you type your password with letters and numbers only. There should be only one line to this file, and there should be no extra spaces or anything. Just the Password. Nothing else.  The password.txt file should be in the SD://apps/priiloader/ folder.  As far as the backdoor:  You can't really brick your wii this way, because you can make it launch any program as a ""backdoor"" by renaming any .dol file to wii_secure.dol and putting it on the root of your SD card.  For example, if you forgot the password or it doesn't work right, you could launch windows, put your Wii's SD card into your computer, take WiiXplorer's .dol file and rename it to wii_secure.dol, copy the wii_secure.dol file from your PC to your SD card's root, put the  SD card in your Wii, and then reboot the wii.  When the password check fails, it will launch the renamed version of WiiXplorer automatically, and then you can  launch priiloader from within WiiXplorer and disable the password, or rename the password defined in password.txt using WiiXplorer's text editor.

Either way, reread my last comment, because I edited it and added a bunch of notes about what to do if you forget the password.  There is a backdoor function built in, which lets you add a .dol file to your SD card after you get locked out, and it will launch that file, making it impossible to brick your Wii with this method.

It offers virtually lag free video from input to screen.  I can't recommend it though, as it only seems to work well with their software, which is fairly horrible.  As far as video capture cards go, you can either go internal (plug in a card into your motherboard), or external (more often than not they'll be USB).  Personally I can't recommend any other capture cards, as I haven't used anything other than the Hybrid Volar Max.  For me, it gets the job done.  EDIT: I forgot to mention, I also have an older model of this K-World device that can take composite from my Wii, and convert it to a VGA signal for a monitor.  It offers no noticeable lag also."

It would be clunky using a couple of adaptors but it should work.  You'd need to also check that your monitor is going to be able to display 480ihz or whatever the NTSC equivalent is.

It is just misleading to someone who is looking for a solution to say that it has ""no lag.""   Any software scaler of this nature is going to add lag, because not only does it have to add at least 1 field of latency, while it waits to get the second field before it has all the information it needs to produce a complete frame, but once it has that complete frame processed, it then has to interact with the memory bus and the GPU in the computer, and this signal chain is inherently much slower than a signal being beamed through a CRT TV via a standard set of cables."

wii,2h8ovl,stoelwinder,1 point,Tue Sep 23 23:12:34 2014 UTC,"Here's my advice: Don't buy a system just to play a single game. Make sure the system you buy has AT LEAST five games you'd like to eventually play. If money is a concern, you can get a used PS3 for really cheap these days, and you'll be able to play Disney Infinity 2 and countless other games.   On the other hand, if you got lots of Wii games, a Wii U makes more sense since you'll be able to play your old games on it.  If you bought the Wii fairly recently, chances are you didn't play all the good games it's got to offer. No need to get rid of the Wii until you play them! Browse the recommended games list and see what you can get.  TL;DR if there's kids in the house, the Wii just can't be beat (gamecube + ps3 + wii + wii u owner here).

wii,2grbj0,ImSpurticus,6,Thu Sep 18 13:17:26 2014 UTC,"I recommend Wii Fit U. It's much more accessible than the Wii version because of the gamepad - off TV mode is good and mirror mode lets allows you to see yourself on screen alongside the trainer which is cool for some exercises. Its a game you might want to download and the 8GB model will be fine because the file size is under 5GB. I heartilly recommend the download over the disc version because you're going to play some really good games on the Wii U and don't want to change discs everytime you exercise.  If you do get the basic model get a Wii U starter pack or something because you need to obtain a stand for mirror mode and that doesn't come packaged with the basic model.  You want at least one standard wiimote to use as a controller but there are a couple of minigames games that require two motion plus wii-motes. Rock climbing and advanced Hula hoop. Honestly these are not necessary and if you want you can add the at a later date.  Finally, if your wife likes to jog or walk places she might have fun with the fit-meter but ideally it's clipped to a belt. It's liable to ping off if she's waring leggings or the wrong sort of clothes. Again, that's something that can be added later on."

Some of the games/exercises do require a Wii remote, but by and large things are done solely with the balance board. If you do end up getting Wii Fit U, a lot of the dancing routines require two Wii Remote Pluses, just fyi.  The basic Wii U model would probably be more than acceptable for your needs, the only difference is the internal storage space."

The Wiimote uses the two point to triangulate where you're pointing on the screen. The sensor bar cord is just a power cord for the lights.  I've seen many home made sensor bars where it's just two lights and a battery. Some people have even used two flash lights in a pinch.
wii,2gp3wa,xdeadzx,2,Thu Sep 18 11:54:03 2014 UTC,"Candles also work.  Two of them, placing them about a foot apart makes a sensor bar work.  But def. I agree on the wireless sensor bar.  Amazon has the official Nintendo wireless ones cheap, and third parties have some even cheaper.  It'll allow the console to be behind you without wires, and your wii(u) will still work just fine."

wii,2ghwoi,HaemoRage,1 point,Wed Sep 17 02:52:02 2014 UTC,"Composite is the worst thing to be converting to VGA, for the record.  S-Video would be better; component video would be best.

It really needs CRTs to look half decent."

The Gamecube component cable actually has a dedicated chip at its base that does some kind of gypsy magic that really does make the games look great and far less jaggy then Wii games running in 480p. I think Nintendo really skimped out on the Wii video output components."

Modding your Wii with a USB Loader is intended for backups of games you already own. There are also emulators available that you can use if you somehow are able to legally acquire Roms for those."
wii,2fi5lp,josephgee,3,Fri Sep 5 01:23:32 2014 UTC,You need a memory card unless you play gamecube games using Nintendont: http://gbatemp.net/threads/nintendont.349258/.   Also I did find a noticeable difference with the component cable. I would recommend them if you can get them cheap like Monoprice.
wii,2fi5lp,GentleObsession,2,Fri Sep 5 01:39:23 2014 UTC,You don't necessarily need a component cable but it comes highly recommended as you will be able to achieve higher levels of clarity with the visuals in both Wii and Gamecube games.  Composite cables are still acceptable.  In order to save your progress in any Gamecube games you will need a Gamecube memory card.  There are two slots on the top of the Wii assuming you have an older white model.  The newer black models do not have Gamecube support whatsoever.  Wii store is still up and running.  You can access it from the Wii's main menu assuming it is connected to the internet.  The homebrew scene for Wii is alive and well.  The possibilities are nearly endless if you're willing to fiddle around a bit.  There are plenty of foolproof guides for modding any model of Wii to install the Homebrew Channel which is your portal for all Wii Homebrew.  It is highly recommended you do this as it really opens up the possibilities for your Wii.

Then i got a PS1 and PS2, then got away from console gaming and locked in on PC gaming.  I got a wii because i got the itch to play Skyward Sword. i thought it was a steal at $60 for the console. I enjoyed playing the wii so much that i went and picked up a Wii U once i heard it had backwards compatibility and that i could get ready for any new Zelda games.  I may still be a PC gamer, but the Wii U has probably brought me more joy and good memories then any PC game did."
wii,2fg55l,Boose77,3,Thu Sep 4 15:43:14 2014 UTC,"It's the opposite for me. I grew up with the NES and SNES. Loved the N64 and later the Game Cube. Didn't own a single non-Nintendo console until 2006 or so.  When Nintendo introduced the Wii I was interested but skeptical. The controllers seemed gimmicky... the name was just plain weird... I hated that the controllers required batteries... the console specs were a far cry from what the competition had to offer. I held out for a while but eventually gave in and bought a Wii for Mario Galaxy and Mario Kart. I was excited about the Zeldas but it turned out I didn't enjoy playing them nearly as much as the older titles -- mostly due to the controls.  Well... and that was about it. Since then my Wii has literally been gathering dust. I probably used it to stream videos to the TV more than for playing games. Eventually I had enough and got a PS3.  I'm still interested in Nintendo's games, but I will not buy another gimmicky, underpowered console from them. For that reason the Wii U isn't even a consideration for me.  Edit: Yes, yes, downvote the post. Fuck me for having an opinion, right?"
wii,2fg55l,arbaminch,2,Thu Sep 4 19:29:25 2014 UTC,"My experience was similar. Unlike you though, I had tried a Wii at a friend's and was very excited about the motion controls so I picked one up (being lucky to find one at my local store). I loved Mario Galaxy and Resident Evil, but Twilight Princess was definitely underwhelming. I mostly played with the Virtual Console and GameCube games after that.  What really did it was when new, quality releases started to dry up. The lack of strong 3rd party support was also really frustrating. I started to look at release calendars and was worried about my future with the console. A few friends suggested I try a Xbox 360 and since I loved the original Xbox I picked one up. My Wii was like yours after that, a dusty relic on my shelf. I ended up selling it to a friend (who paid extra to have the VC games) and used the money to buy a PS3.    It was the first time I was ever truly disappointed with Nintendo and to be frank, I still have that bitter taste in my mouth, despite some of the improvements made with the Wii U (which I only bought because my wife wanted to play it and to have a kid-friendly console)."
wii,2fg55l,Lokiren686,2,Fri Sep 5 09:58:18 2014 UTC,"that bitter taste in my mouth   Yeah, it's really that.

It's a thoroughly underrated little gem that's actually really solid and deeper than it looks. The visual style is lovely, the thing is crammed with atmosphere and reeks of charm and the combat is varied, fun and upgradeable. Plus, the simultaneous co-op is ace with 2P playing Gandalf!   Riding over the plains of Rohan - for there is horse combat - with the Fellowship to dismantle Orc outposts is pretty neat. It ends up feeling a bit like a cross between the feel and engine of Zelda - along with RPG lite elements and little sidequests - and the setpieces and combat-focus of the licensed Lord of the Rings games on PS2/GCN/XBox."

wii,2f6350,aidotato5,3,Mon Sep 1 13:47:54 2014 UTC,"Definitely post things like this in /r/WiiHacks next time, as they know much more about modding than this sub.     If you need some help with getting started with softmodding, I've answered a question like this before. This might help you if you're not too sure on where to properly go (like I was when I first started).    Use this guide to softmod. Don't be put off by the sheer size of the guide, as it offers amazing content on your wii and buffs it into a little beast! I love that guide. Once you've done all that you'll be set for a HUGE amount of options for your wii, including an extraordinary amount of old games thanks to emulators and USB loaders. I'm not sure what you've done already and haven't done, like setting up your SD card and the folders, so using that should tell you where you are. You've already installed homebrew channel, so you can skip step 1 (unless you haven't done some step such as backup up your wii NAND, which you should definitely do).  For wii games, this guide has worked for me. If you followed the guide I posted above, you should have USB Loader GX and two other usb loaders, just for preferences. Using that should make the games work on the wii!   And heck, if you want, emulators. For emulators, this guide offers the basics. The basic instructions in that guide can also be used to set up different emulators, as they share the same structures. You would need certain controllers for the different emulators, and I've heard that for SNES games the wiimote is terrible. I have a gamecube controller, but you could invest in a Classic Controller Pro if you only have a wiimote, as it does the job of playing old games fairly well too.     There are also quite a few emulators for the wii, including:     Wii64 - Emulator to play Nintendo 64 games. Snes9xGX - SNES emulator. VBA GX - Visual Boy Advance emulator. WiiSX - Playstation 1 emulator.  And even more.   These apps are pretty popular too, try seeing what they all do.    These tutorials also offer plenty to help you with..    But yeah, go up in /r/WiiHacks for more people who know about this kind of stuff. Any more questions and you can PM or reply to me; I'll be happy to help.   Hope I helped!"
wii,2f6350,HaemoRage,1 point,Mon Sep 1 14:27:13 2014 UTC,Does the N64 emulator work well?
wii,2f6350,GentleObsession,1 point,Mon Sep 1 21:23:26 2014 UTC,"Honestly, Wii64 is just passable. If you're fine with playing the game at non-constant framerates, don't mind the occasional lag and music glitches, and texture glitches then it's good enough. It's far from perfect and quite buggy, but the N64 is an awkward console to emulate anyway. If you're only planning on playing a few 64 games, it would be better to see if it's on Virtual Console and install a wad (a Wii channel) which is much more suited for the Wii. I make Wii64 sound terrible, but it's alright for what it tries to do."
wii,2f5ofn,Moon4u,2,Mon Sep 1 09:42:26 2014 UTC,It depends on which games you would like to play.    But in general procontroller is good for many games so it might not be a bad idea to buy it one or two.

The old school Wii Remote and Nunchuck will work on many multiplayer games and are also necessary for playing any Wii games  However, if you want to play Wii U games, you can also choose the Wii U Pro Controller.

Only for Wii U titles)  I have found that owning one of these isnt necessary, I have been able to get by with 4 players on my Wii U using only the supplied gamepad and 4 old Wii motes (nintendo land, mario kart, mario bros can all work with the old wii motes*).  It's also probably worth mentioning that this is a Wii subreddit, and your question relates to a Wii U. I don't mind one bit...but you know what people can be like :)   *the old Wii remotes were upgraded towards the end of the life of the original Wii, so if you plan on getting Wii remotes, make sure you get the Wii Remote Plus models, to ensure you can use them on everything (some games require the added ""Plus"" functionality to work)"

wii,2e4ev4,immewnity,3,Wed Aug 20 21:56:52 2014 UTC,"A media streamer is probably your best bet, though I don't know if there's much besides Netflix as that sort of thing varies by region.  You say you have the homebrew channel though so id suggest WiiMC - plug in an sd card, USB stick or hard drive and it can read loads of files so it's great for watching any downloaded movies or tv shows.  It also has a pretty cool streaming radio feature with, id guess 100 channels or more sorted by genre which is pretty nifty!   And ofc, if you're into classic games, the Wii virtual console will still work just fine - and there's also plenty of fun to be had with emulators on the Wii. If you haven't got homebrew browser I strongly suggest downloading that, it's pretty much a Wii shop channel but for homebrew apps and let's you download stuff direct to your Wii, so you can see if anything interests you in the homebrew scene!"

wii,2dubww,curiositor,3,Mon Aug 18 00:27:56 2014 UTC,"The main difference is the ability to play wii u games, price, and the use of online services. I have both, one for legitimate wii u gaming, and the other for Homebrew and gamecube."
wii,2dubww,DoTheRustle,3,Mon Aug 18 00:35:32 2014 UTC,"Okay. My wife and I just wanna play some sports game and dancing game together. I guess Wii should be enough?  I am new to this Wii thing, what is the purpose of installing Homebrew?"
wii,2dubww,DoTheRustle,3,Mon Aug 18 00:38:55 2014 UTC,"In your case I'd recommend the wii u, simply because it's also fairly cheap and still has online services.   Homebrew is akin to jailbreaking for phones. You install software that lets you run a multitude of programs and games at no additional cost. For instance, a wii could play any Nintendo game since the original Nintendo, as well as almost any game released since the 80s with the use of emulators and roms. I highly recommend doing this if you get a wii, since you won't need to ever pay for a game, just hardware. Nintendo has all but ended the life of the wii officially, and doesn't stand to make any more money from it."
wii,2dubww,muzaq,0,Mon Aug 18 00:47:57 2014 UTC,I am confused. Is it typo? you said wii u at beginning but wii at the last sentence.
wii,2dubww,Romymopen,6,Mon Aug 18 07:44:25 2014 UTC,"DoTheRustle didn't have a typo. He recommended that you get a Wii U. He later states that if you were to end up getting a Wii, then you should hack it for various reasons, especially since he believes the Wii's life is over by now."
wii,2dubww,milk_bag,-3,Mon Aug 18 08:08:38 2014 UTC,"There's no reason to softmod the Wii unless you want to pirate games. There is some useful software but it's old and outdated at this point.  If you want to play dance games, you'll need to buy the mat anyway, so you could just spend $2 more dollars and get the game with it.  Used, loose original Wiis will only get cheaper, so buy now or buy 6 months from now, it won't really matter."
wii,2dubww,GentleObsession,2,Mon Aug 18 12:16:35 2014 UTC,"Honestly, if you're only looking for sports and dance games then I'd suggest the original Wii. The Wii U is great if you're a big Nintendo fan (for games like Mario, Zelda and Mario kart) but if you're not fussed by them then there's not much point, especially for the massive difference in price (I know in the UK, second hand Wiis are like Â£35)  try to get a Wii with Wii sports as that's a lot of fun. Any EA tennis or golf game is also great fun if you're into those sports.  Dance-wise, just dance is by far the best series to get. The first isn't great, but 2 to 4 and just dance 2014 are great fun and dirt cheap. They also offer 'sweat' modes that track how many calories you burn if you want them for exercise purposes as well as a bit of fun.   If you get Wii motion plus remotes (they're a bit more expensive but may come with slightly newer model wii's, it will say on the bottom of the Wiimote under the 4 led lights if it's a motion plus) then Wii sports resort is also great, especially in multiplayer."
wii,2dubww,jccinc,2,Mon Aug 18 12:43:36 2014 UTC,"To add to your last point, the motion plus remotes are a great choice because they work with the WiiU as well so if you ever decide to upgrade to the U you won't have to buy controllers for it."

wii,2d6lye,Hambone76,8,Sun Aug 10 22:54:35 2014 UTC,"I suggest selling it on ebay/craigslist over giving it to a store like gamestop. I would ask for at least $450 for the total package. I would list it at either $500 or $550 and lower the price if it doesn't sell. The Wii + 1 wiimote + 1 nunchuck + cables will get you around $60, the Wii U should get you over $200, and the large number of games and accessories should fetch you the rest. Finally, I must ask why you are considering the xbox one. Unless you are looking for exclusives, the PS4 will be the more powerful console. Also, note that kinect is a gimmick that isn't worth getting the console for. I'm not a fanboy, but it's the simple truth that the PS4 is a more powerful console for the same price. Good luck with the sale!"

If I can't sell it locally, then my next step is ebay, but I wanted to make sure I was in the ballpark at least."
wii,2d6lye,TheNostalgiaBomb,6,Sun Aug 10 23:45:05 2014 UTC,$200 is insanely low for all that. Realistically you might get 300-350(?) from Gamestop at best but if you decided to go that route wait until they have trade in bonuses. Sometimes they'll run stuff like 30% more trade in credit if you put it towards a particular game coming out.  Another option is storing all of it until around November/December and retry Craigslist with the price tags /u/lakerfan1997 suggested.

To entice more buyers you can do free shipping, but you have a lot of girls games and those don't sell that well so I suggest calculating shipping for this lot.  Selling all at once will get you 75-80% of the value you would get if you sold them separately, but there is a lot more effort involved in selling them separately.

Only a few shovelware titles are still being released but on the upside, no new updates mean no new nasty antipiracy measures, so now is the time to start modding. Also, on June 28, 2013, Nintendo has shut down online services for many of the channels on the home menu. These channels are the Forecast Channel, News Channel, Everybody Votes Channel, Nintendo Channel, and the Check Mii Out Channel. WiiConnect24 services were also shut down this day, so keep this in mind if a game you are thinking of playing uses this. Additionally, on May 20, 2014, Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection was shut down, essentially disabling on-line multiplayer on the Wii and DS for first party titles. The Wii Shop Channel (including Virtual Console) still exists for the moment tho, so grab what you want while you can.Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

wii,2d0yop,Soccadude123,2,Mon Aug 11 22:38:11 2014 UTC,The original Wii with letterbomb will work with SDHC. I modded mine with a Samsung 8GB SDHC micro. Really you only need an SD card if you are using a game exploit. Also get a regular controller if you don't have one. Like without motion plus. You can't get the mod managers to work without them.
wii,2d0yop,JRPGpro,1 point,Wed Aug 20 08:39:02 2014 UTC,Yeah I ended up being able to install the homebrew channel via Letterbomb using an SDHC. Only thing was some issues with bootmii.

wii,2d0yop,13zath13,1 point,Sat Aug 9 01:06:02 2014 UTC,"But the info on that page isn't about whether or not people were successful in modding the console/adding the homebrew channel with an SDHC card. It's whether or not they were able to access the Homebrew channel on an SDHC card after it was already installed by a different SD card.  It's pretty clear right here:   Homebrew Channel: Yes or no, successful usage of Homebrew via the Homebrew Channel using your card? (Not initially installing the channel, just using it once it has been installed)   The only other thing it mentions is the Twilight hack which isn't how I plan to mod my Wii."

What it actually is, though, is a garbage cash-in on the concept of ""Super Mario All Stars""  It doesn't even have Super Mario World included. It is basically the lesser of the two SNES Mario All Stars Roms thrown onto a Wii Disc.  Nintendo could have made a really awesome ""New! Super Mario All-Stars"" with every Mario release from Super Mario Bros. all the way through Mario Sunshine"" and included super cool unlockables like Doki-Doki Panic, and the original arcade version of Donkey Kong and had an awesome collection that would have been worth every penny, even at whatever inflated price it would go for now.

wii,2c40uh,I_LIKE_VIDEO_GAEMZ,1 point,Thu Jul 31 00:56:15 2014 UTC,What problems do you mean?   I didn't like MP9 because you had to get on special fields for minigames. That lead to some boring rounds.
wii,2c40uh,FunkyFreshJayPi,1 point,Thu Jul 31 09:58:12 2014 UTC,"In my experience with MP9, minigames are generally just as frequent as past entries in the series.  Usually if nobody lands on a designated minigame space, someone will ""find"" a minigame inside an item or a dice capsule.  90% of the time there's a minigame at the end of each round."

""Treasure Island Z: Barbaros' Secret Treasure"") in Japan, is an adventure/puzzle video game published and developed by Capcom for the Wii video game console. It was first released in North America on October 23, 2007, and was later released in Japan, PAL regions, and as one of eight Wii launch games in South Korea. The game stars the aspiring pirate Zack and his monkey friend Wiki. Shortly after joining a pirate gang called ""The Sea Rabbits"", the pair discovers a talking skull belonging to the pirate captain Barbaros. In exchange for helping find all the pieces of the captain's cursed body, Barbaros promises to lead Zack and Wiki to the coveted ""Treasure Island"" and his legendary pirate ship.

wii,2by6jg,jnoirv,4,Mon Jul 28 15:01:14 2014 UTC,"The Wii U has a Wii mode. So if you want just Wii and Wii U, don't bother getting a Wii. The older models of Wiis had gamecube support (you could play GC games and plug in GC controllers, and for Wii games that have GC controller support such as SSB Brawl, you could use them). If you want GC support, it's probably just as much to buy a Wii U + used GameCube than to buy a Wii U + Wii. Not sure. Wii Package: Wii system, power brick, composite cable, remote, nunchuck, sensor bar, Wii Sports  - However, a new Wii would be much more expensive than a used one, if you really wanted one. Wii U Package: Wii U system, power brick for console, Wii U Gamepad controller, Wii U Gamepad charger, sensor bar, charging cradle for Gamepad*, Wii U console stand*, Gamepad Stand* * Only for the black deluxe 32 GB version. The basic white 8GB version is mostly gone now, though. Kinect is xbox, so no. You can play MK8 with either the gamepad, a wiimote, or a pro controller. If the gamepad works fine for you, then nothing. You don't need to buy anything additional besides Wiimotes+Nunchucks, however they do have a Pro Controller that feels and works very nice. Nintendo sells refurbished Wiimote+Nunchuks for $25, which is the best place to get them.   Here's a list of the controllers for each system and where you can use them:    - Wii Wii U Wii U Wii Mode    Wii Remote + Nunchuk Yes Yes Yes   Classic Controller Yes Yes Yes   Classic Controller Pro Yes Yes Yes   Gamecube Controller Yes1 No2 No   GamePad No Yes No   Pro Controller No Yes No    1  This is only true for the older models of Wii.

wii,2bqs8f,maine_forest,1 point,Sat Jul 26 01:08:19 2014 UTC,I'm not sure of that type of tv but when you play certain games I think you are better of with a smaller screen so that the graphics don't get to stretched. This also helps with games that weren't made for a widescreen. I use a smaller tv in my room for gaming when I can't use my big tv. The Wii itself can only go up to 480p and in my opinion doesn't look right on a huge screen.  If you can play sitting close enough to see it then why not. On the v.c some games have to be changed like sonic 3 looks horrendous unless you switch to 16.9. I would give it a try to see how it is.

At first I hated it. It didn't have the same aesthetic that the mode-7 SNES version had, and I didn't move forward with it for like a month.  Then, I saw a review online from someone who loved it, and what they loved about the gameplay really overlapped with what I loved about the gameplay from the SNES version (especially on the harder difficulties where you find yourself thinking the tracks as the opponent, more than the other drivers.)  I gave it another shot, and decided to spend a whole evening with it. And you know what?!  I loved it. It was crazy-difficult, pretty much from the get-go.

The wiimotes sync via bluetooth.  First, please make sure when you say you are syncing with the ""red buttons"" you are using the red buttons on the remote at the same time you are using the red button under the SD slot door on the front of the console. These must be used in conjunction with each other. If you were doing this correctly, and it is not working, the next solution is try syncing the remotes to a computer, to see if their bluetooth radios are working.  If you have a mac, this is very easy. Just download OpenEmu and go to Preferences > Controls > Input and choose 'Add a Wiimote'. This will allow you to easily sync and test the functionality of the wiimotes.  I'm sure there is a similarly simple solution for Windows, but I do not know it.  If they work, but won't connect to the Wii, try unplugging the Wii for a few minutes, and then try again. Once the Wiimotes sync with your Mac/PC you will surely need to resync them to the Wii using the Red button on the front panel of the Wii.  I hope this helps."

First is that the survey took a little bit longer than ten minutes but not very much, maybe 3 or 4 minutes.  The other thing is that, in my opinion, only five categories for how much I agree or disagree to something is not enough, but that is just me. others may prefer having 5 choices for simplicity, but I often found myself stuck between two choices, wishing that there could have been another choice.  Other than that, I enjoyed participating in your survey and I wish you luck in finding your results."

wii,2bf82x,brudda,0,Tue Jul 22 19:43:53 2014 UTC,"So a bartender is washing a glass, minding his own own business, and an unusual customer walks in. The man has been frequenting the bar all week, wearing a different and expensive looking suit every night, drinking only the finest scotch in the house, and tipping excessively well after closing out his tab. There was something incredibly unusual about this man, however, and the bartender had fought the urge to ask the man all week about his strange condition. See, the man had a florescent orange head.  The customer sits down at the bar and orders everyone in the house a drink, as he tended to begin each night so far. He pays for it from a roll of hundreds and orders himself a double Macallan.  The rest of the patrons in the house give the man strange looks, but none look like they have the courage or rashness to ask. Finally, after 6 nights of wondering, the bartender can hold it in no longer.  ""Excuse me,"" says the bartender, ""I can't help but notice that you're obviously fabulously wealthy and successful, but - and excuse me, this is definitely a forward and possibly rude question - but you have an orange head. How did that happen?""  The man gave the bartender a hard look, downed his scotch and beckoned for another.  ""I'm sorry,"" the bartender started. ""I didn't mean to cause offense. Here."" He poured the man another double. ""It's on the house.""  The man with the orange head sighed. ""Don't be daft. I know how ridiculous I look. Frankly, I'm impressed you held it in for this long."" He slipped a $50 on the table for the drink with another heavy sigh, this time a bit softer, and looked the bartender in the eye. The rest of the bar was silent, all were staring at the odd pair at the bar. ""Oh hell, why not? I'll tell you if you really want to know. The story is never far from my mind. I replay it in my head every day trying to think of what I could have done differently."" He downed the second glass of scotch and began his tale.  ""20 years ago, I was merely the son of a half-employed plumber. My mom had died when I was 5. I can barely remember her hair. Black as the midnight sea. My dad took to the bottle hard and had a difficult time holding down steady work. He never hit me, my old man. He rarely even yelled at me, though I wish he did more often, it was one of the few times I saw glimmers of life in his eyes.""  The man stopped speaking for a moment, he was staring behind the barkeep into the mirror behind.The bartender poured the man a glass of water. The man took a sip with a grateful smile flashing on his sorrowful countenance.  ""See, he had never truly recovered from my mother's passing. So when he completely lost himself in the bottle around my 15th birthday, I was already independent enough to figure things out on my own, to support the both of us. I got a job in town as a mechanic. I always loved the way the hot metal felt in my hands. It wasn't easy, but we were getting by. 5 years passed, and my dad got somewhat better. He found a job at the local grocer. Cleaning, stocking, bagging - whatever they needed. It was around that time I decided I had to leave, go somewhere new, somewhere that was warm in the winter and cool in the Summer. So I packed up my what little I had, and went West to California.""  ""I won't bore you with the the tragic story that was my first marriage, but let's just say I turned 30 a penniless, beaten down, and broken man. Then one day everything changed. I was walking down the beach near Santa Barbara when I saw a glint of gold in the sand. I dug it up and to my surprise it was this old lamp, looking as beat to hell as I felt. I picked it up and gave it a clean, and POOF! out popped a genie. The genie explained that he had been trapped in that lamp for two hundred years, and that he was so grateful to me for freeing him that he would give me three wishes.""  The whole bar was leaning on every word. You would think some would have laughed at the man, but the heaviness of each word stayed their jeers and left them with a curious, mournful silence.  ""For my first wish I asked for what I felt I had been missing all my life. Something that would make me whole again, and allow me to finally - as I thought - live my life as I wanted. I wished for an unlimited fortune. The genie said 'It is done!' and from then on, whenever I needed money, it was there. I reached into my pocket, and sure enough there was a roll of hundred dollar bills. 'Your pockets shall never be empty,' said the genie. And with that I knew what I wanted next."" ""For my second wish I asked for the most beautiful, interesting, and intelligent woman in the world to be my wife. The genie said it was done, and immediately the most incredible women I have ever met was at my side. What became of that - well, that is a story for another night I'm afraid.""  The bartender unblinkingly poured the man another scotch, and took up the bottle himself with a large pull, but never once took his eyes of the man's great orange visage. All the air had been sucked out of the room. The silence was deafening. The man took the glass and considered it in his hands for what seemed an eternity. Clearly he had reached the part in the tale that he did not wish to tell - or maybe he didn't know how. After all, the bartender thought, it seems the man has still not found the salvation that comes with hindsight, even after many years.  The man took a small sip, this time, rummaged around in his pockets for another $50 and laid it on the bar next to the other bills. He looked again in the mirror then at his own hands, then turned his eyes back to the bartender and finished his tragic story.  ""For my third wish -- and, this is the bit where I cocked things up -- I asked for an orange for a head."""

Think of it as Call of Duty + James Bond + Metal Gear Solid and you'll get the idea.  The Lego games are one big joke to whatever the source material is, not unlike a family-friendly version of a Robot Chicken skit.

I rarely see GC memory cards and they are far more expensive than PS1/PS2 memory cards possibly because of their scarcity (most places around here charge a few dollars - $5 for a PS1/PS2 memory card, but GC memory cards are almost always up around $10).

wii,2atolr,DontBendYourVita,3,Wed Jul 16 02:47:56 2014 UTC,Actually if the tv has a small 3.5mm phono input labelled as VGA then it would have come with a proprietary adaptor to VGA socket. It is a trifle to adapt component rgb (RCA red green blue) to VGA (15pin hd15). They are the same signal standard just different plugs.   It is also common with modern TVs that they supply different adaptors for the analogue input so you can choose between composite VGA (yellow RCA video) and component (rgb RCA) and VGA (hd15 rgb). If so that makes your life even easier.   Worst case scenario you need to figure out how to make a three pole 3.5mm phono jack to three RCA red green blue YpBpR sockets and then use an aftermarket wii to YpBpR component breakout lead.
wii,2atolr,JopHabLuk,2,Wed Jul 16 10:36:54 2014 UTC,"Could you be confusing VGA with RCA? If you're talking about RCA, then most TVs have a spot in the component connection that can accept an RCA composite signal. Nevertheless, a component cable would work the best in your situation."
wii,2atolr,kcchan,1 point,Wed Jul 16 06:27:58 2014 UTC,does it maybe have component (rgb) input? the best quality you can get out of the wii is 480p via component
wii,2atolr,mzajac14,1 point,Wed Jul 16 03:12:21 2014 UTC,"The Wii won't doesn't even output a VGA signal in the first place, so fortunately for you, the TV's lack of VGA input won't be the slightest problem at all.  If your TV has component inputs, buy THIS CABLE for $3 from monoprice.com. It is a Wii Component cable, and will allow you to output 480p to the TV. It is the best output the wii is capable of.  Otherwise, buy this device called 'Wii2HDMI' which will convert your wii's component output to HDMI. It should be roughly equal to the component cable in quality, but will probably introduce a small amount of lag into the signal. Unless it is being played by hard-core gamers this will be completely unnoticeable. The upside is that HDMI cables are way easier to deal with than anything else.  Good luck."
wii,2atolr,BangkokPadang,1 point,Wed Jul 16 04:45:26 2014 UTC,"What I think your saying is the wii's cables are rca (yellow, [red, white]) and the tv does not have a spot to put those cables. All you have to do is look on the back of the tv where the rgb (red, green, blue[red, white]) cables go and plug the red and white audio cables where they go and the yellow cable in the green spot and it should work."

wii,2atolr,jared1981,1 point,Wed Jul 16 20:43:32 2014 UTC,"Both.  Nintendo made them (and might still, although they don't fit the Wii Mini), and lots of third party suppliers seem to have them.  If you're in the US, monoprice seems to have them for US$3."
wii,2asrdy,Nannose,2,Tue Jul 15 21:13:25 2014 UTC,"The ""color stream inputs"" (Toshiba's trademarked name for component video) will support 480i over component. Color Stream is actually YCbCr. Most component outputs, including the Wii, are actually output in YPbPr. They are similar signals, with the main difference being that YCbCr also supports digital colorspaces.  Most people think that the R,G,and B component cables represent Red, Green, and Blue color signals. This is not true. Y (Typically Green) is actually brightness (aka Luminance), and R and B are the Chrominance values for Red and Blue, not the red and blue signals themselves. The color Yellow would have been used because at the time, there was really no color standard for Component cables yet, and Toshiba usually shared a second composite input with it's ""color stream"" inputs, which is why it is yellow.  What this means, practically for you, is that 99% of YCbCr inputs also support YPbPr, but they will only support 480i signal types.  The benefits of this are brighter, crisper colors, but it will still not be  ""progressive scan.""  It is definitely worth doing, though, because you can get component cables for the Wii from monoprice.com for less than $3.  THESE ARE THE $3 CABLES"
wii,2asrdy,BangkokPadang,2,Tue Jul 15 23:35:42 2014 UTC,"Component (YpBpR) supports higher than 480i. Up to 1080i commonly in fact, and beyond 1080p in theory.  The wii doesn't output higher than 480p though, I would presume its outputting YpBpR.  Cannot find any source to back up what you're saying about ycbcr and 480i limitations though.  Even Wikipedia (fwiw) says component video is capable to over 1080p without any distinction made between the two even though the writer was careful to distinguish between the two at the start of the page."

When the online connection for the Wii was about to go down, Last Story was the game I chose to focus my online gameplay efforts, and while everything in multiplayer felt like it had a dauntingly high barrier to entry at first, I wound up completely loving co-op and deathmatch, and felt disappointed that I hadn't gotten into them sooner, and that I won't be able to play more of some of these other characters in the main game. Playing Last Story online was ultimately definitely one of my favorite experiences with my Wii.

wii,2almhp,ShaNayNay00,3,Sun Jul 13 18:26:34 2014 UTC,"No.  The connector you have linked would connect a PC with a video card that could use it's software to send a composite/s-video signal out of its VGA port to a CRT-style Television. This is a non-traditional use of the port, and any monitor expecting to recieve a VGA signal will not be able to read Luma, Chroma, or Composite NTSC/PAL signals via VGA.  Here is the pinout for VGA. You'll note an absolute lack of Luma, Chroma, or Composite video pins. One of the reviews for this adapter on Amazon says it will work to go from composite-> VGA. 30 say it won't.  This will absolutely not work to connect your Wii to a VGA monitor. Also, you seem to be confusing composite with component. I see you have searched for 'component' and yet selected a product with 'composite' connections. They are very different, please be aware. I also couldn't help but notice you searched for 'VGA to component.' This is the opposite of what you need to search for, since you are looking to go from 'component to VGA.' In the world of video converters, these minor points matter immensely!!  Since the Wii, even when softmodded, doesn't support VGA resolutions, you will need a component-> VGA transcoder, LIKE THIS ONE  You will also need to make absolutely certain that you have COMPONENT CABLES and not COMPOSITE CABLES.  I hope this information helps."
wii,2almhp,BangkokPadang,2,Sun Jul 13 18:57:25 2014 UTC,Thank you so much so i should get the transcoder and is there and problems and how is the experience with it in terms of lag and what not.
wii,2almhp,BangkokPadang,2,Sun Jul 13 19:07:53 2014 UTC,"That is a huge can of worms.  Then short-story here is that this device will probably add a frame or two of lag.  If you are connecting to a CRT-style monitor, the lag will be less (only what the transcoder adds to it). If you are connecting to a flatscreen LCD monitor it will add another frame or so of lag. Just make sure you set the transcoder's output to match your monitor's native resolution, so the monitor itself doesn't have to upscale the image a second time, (i.e. from 640x480 to 1024x768)which would add even more lag.  3 frames of lag is 48ms of latency.  The average time it takes a human to respond to visual input is 215ms.  This means that it will probably increase the time it takes you to respond onscreen by about 25%.  This should be fine for most games, but if you were playing, say, super smash bros online against someone with less lag on their screen, they would have a notable advantage, being able to respond 25% faster than you.  With that said, though, HDTVs usually have waaaaay higher lag than monitors do, because of all the processing they do, so it will probably not be noticeable in the long run, and may even be less than you would experience plugging the component cables right into an HDTV."
wii,2almhp,tehsage,0,Sun Jul 13 19:14:42 2014 UTC,"No. Component cables use three plugs for video and two for audio.   The link you posted would allow you to use the Wii's composite cable (three plugs, one yellow for video and two for audio) into a VGA. Granted, this will only do video, so you'll need to plug your audio plugs into something else."
wii,2almhp,BangkokPadang,2,Sun Jul 13 18:48:11 2014 UTC,"There are almost no monitors on the market that would accept a composite signal through the VGA port this way. VGA monitors expect progressive VGA signals.  The lone reviewer suggesting this device will let you view composite video via VGA is outright wrong. If this device was capable of converting a composite 480i NTSC signal to 30khz VGA for 87 cents, no one would ever buy a composite to VGA transcoder. It wouldn't exist.   What this device is for is PC laptops with GPUs capable of sending S-Video and Composite signals out of their VGA ports. It is simply a way of having greater output versatility without having multiple outputs on the side of your Laptop."
wii,2alqwi,cerebrix,4,Sun Jul 13 19:19:37 2014 UTC,"Well, Baten Kaitos and Baten Kaitos: Origins for GameCube might appeal to you, though I don't know if they are exactly what you are looking for. They are JRPGs with a card style battle system that it's pretty fun and unique.   They look fantastic with wonderful music and a unique setting. Story wise they are pretty fantastic, subverting or turning on their head a lot of classic JRPG tropes. The only major complaint I have is the awful voice acting, especially in the first game. You have the option to turn off voice acting and you might want to consider it."

They all wear the batteries out very fast, and they all have intermittent problems with stopping/starting charging. They also drain insanely fast. Way faster than their man ratings would indicate that they should.  From my personal experiences, I've decided that induction charging is just not ""there yet"" at these low price points.  Get yourself some name brand rechargeable batteries, and charge them in a wall charger.  You can usually get 4 batteries and a charger form duracell for about $20, and then get 4 packs of batteries themselves for $10 - $15.  The benefit here is that once you get about 20 batteries in your home, you'll never need to buy batteries again (or at least for, say, another 10 years or so, tip they wear out)  NINJA EDIT:   4 pack of batteries, with charger on Amazon.com  4 pack of batteries, by themselves on Amazon.com"

To answer your question, I wouldn't pay anything more than about $175 for that lot, although personally I consider the guitar/band instruments worthless, because I see them (wii versions in particular) all the time at goodwills for 99 cents.  Your best bet would probably to be to sell the whole lot, minus Mario Galaxy 2, Smash Bros, and Mario Kart Wii, to your family for @ $160, and then sell them separately. You should be able to get an additional $50-$60 for those three bundled together on craigslist."

The thing about the drumset that astonishes me is that it was $425 when I bought it. It sucks how the console being old makes the goodies that come with it ""old"", therefore the price gets brought down too."
wii,2a6hao,rockman99,2,Tue Jul 8 23:05:28 2014 UTC,"I would argue that it was obscenely overpriced to begin with.  You could've gotten a 4-5 year old set of Roland V-Drums for that price, which are actual studio-quality musical instruments.  I saw that exact Wii drum set, again, at a local thrift store this afternoon for $7.99, and I have passed on it for the three weeks it has been there for. They also had a bin of about 10 guitars for various consoles, including PS2, Wii, and Xbox 360, for .99 cents each.  I think culturally people are over the whole ""rock band phenomenon"" so the instruments are nearly valueless at this point."
wii,2a6hao,Clavo_PR,1 point,Tue Jul 8 23:29:11 2014 UTC,"Is it some kind of special drum set like the one from Ion? The Rock Band bundles (drums, guitar, mic, game) were US$200 when they came out, and I don't think the drum sets themselves were much more than US$80 standalone back in their heyday. If it is an Ion kit then I'd probably try selling it separately since they are rather hard to come by (though again, a Wii version would be much less desired).  For reference, in this picture the Ion is on the left and the standard Rock Band kit is on the right."
wii,2a2wy5,BaconHead12,3,Mon Jul 7 20:37:09 2014 UTC,"If you are in the US, I suggest you look at the nearest Craigslist page and read several listings for Wii systems. You could also talk to local pawn shops and used video game shops. The larger chains will have online calculators for estimating the value of your ""trade-in,"" and you could use those as well.  Different entities will have different ideas about what your system is worth, so it is worthwhile to do the research and find out where you can make the most money with the least hassle."

wii,2a0kdj,Will12239,1 point,Mon Jul 7 10:26:58 2014 UTC,"Just breaking it down a bit, the value of the games makes up the largest part of the price of this auction.  To anyone that says wii games are worth nothing because they can be pirated doesn't know what they are talking about.  NES and SNES games can be pirated very easily and yet they somehow are being sold at ridiculous prices.  Taking a look at the games, they are around $190 if you bought them individually, but in a lot that price should be lowered a bit...I would say $175.  The wii with connections is worth around $50.  I would also add another $20 for the wiimotes/nunchucks/classic controllers...individually they sell for more, but this is in a huge lot.  The wii wheels and silicone covers are worthless.  The guitar is worth something, but the price of shipping that guitar is more than anyone is willing to pay for it so I would put a $5-$10 value on it. With all that, a fair deal for all this stuff would be $255.  If you bought it for $225 (opening bid + shipping) you would probably not make your money back if you sold it all on ebay individually.  If you actually wanted all this stuff, $250ish is a good deal.  Not great, but good.  I probably wouldn't pay $310."

wii,29r14r,GILLHUHN,7,Thu Jul 3 17:02:00 2014 UTC,I think a used Wii remote plus is worth more than the system at this point.
wii,29r14r,-kunai,2,Thu Jul 3 18:05:35 2014 UTC,That's kind of what I was thinking as well. If you have 4 wiimotes and you like having 4 then there is no point selling one so you can sell the system just to buy another one later.
wii,29r14r,GILLHUHN,1 point,Thu Jul 3 21:49:09 2014 UTC,"I ended up buying new black controllers to go with my Wii U (my Wii is white) but it's nice having Motion Plus built-in instead of via an add-on cube.  Reason enough to get new controllers, unless one's Wii is new enough to have these controllers already."
wii,29r14r,PhotoJim99,2,Fri Jul 4 15:32:35 2014 UTC,This says $30 for the newer version: http://www.gamestop.com/trade-values/mobile#nwii  So probably less for the older version.
wii,29r14r,darksiderising,3,Thu Jul 3 20:12:59 2014 UTC,"But doesn't the older model have more value, with its GameCube compatibility?"
wii,29r14r,basiamille,4,Thu Jul 3 20:45:39 2014 UTC,Not likely from Gamestop. But perhaps if selling directly to someone via Craigslist or other means.

wii,29qyk3,milk_bag,7,Thu Jul 3 16:59:39 2014 UTC,"I know it isn't ""Zombies,"" but Sega AM2's Ghost Squad is probably the finest lightgun type game on the console. It has branching paths through multiple missions, so the replayability is really high. And it is a Sega brand arcade title, so you know going in that it is good.  Also, Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles was suprisingly good. It is good intense action, and the graphics and lighting effects really push the console. I wasn't expecting a graphical powerhouse when I started playing this title, but in the relative terms of the Wii, this game is astounding. It also has multiple collectables, and a whole arsenal of different weapons, so the replayability is pretty high here as well.  I think Umbrella Chronicles has a sequel, too, but I haven't played it."

You can also use This Ocarina Code instead of Brainslug if you're using a USB Launcher.  Not All games work, and it is unknown which games do and don't work. Right now, the only ones that work for sure are Mario Kart, Smash Bros Melee, and Endless Ocean 1 & 2. For any others you really have to test it out. Generally games with specific functionality, such as advanced matchmaking, do not work.  For example, I know for a fact that Mario Strikers Charged does NOT work.  Right now, you pretty much have to arrange games in advance with your friends, and both log on at the same time in order to see each other.  I also know that for Mario Kart, there is a patched ISO floating around which has more people on it than this DWC Network Emulator does.  It isn't as good as it was when WiFi just worked, but it is progress, and you've got to admit it's getting better. Getting better, all the time (can't get no worse).  P.S. A more in-depth guide, as well as more information, is available HERE  EDIT: There is also something called Wiimfi. This is the service which runs within the patched Mario Kart Wii ISO that is floating around, and It is always immediately able to connect me to full races, so it is definitely worth checking out. Apparently, it currently supports THIS LIST OF GAMES  I have not set this up manually for other games, though, so I can't really offer any help. It does seem to have greater support than the first option I listed.   TL;DR: PES 2013 apparently has FULL SUPPORT using Wiimfi!  Good Luck!"

wii,29afu2,Surkow,2,Sat Jun 28 13:02:27 2014 UTC,With this you are wrongly suggesting that people not selling second hand copies strongly impacts scarcity of new copies. All you could reason about is that people unable to buy second hand copies will have to resort to buying new copies.   Artificial scarcity describes the scarcity of items even though the technology and production capacity exists to create an abundance.   I.e. Nintendo not producing new copies is creating the real scarcity.
wii,29aa0v,FrNoelFurlong,7,Sat Jun 28 00:14:31 2014 UTC,"The Wii one is enhanced in every way.   The controls feel great. They are mapped to similar buttons on the wiimote, placing your power ups on C and having passing still use the A button, while shooting is now on the B trigger. The only motion-controlled element is body-slams, and it feels really good. The gameplay is much wilder, because you can now pick each teammate individually, instead of having one ""type"" of teammate. Also, each teammate now has their own special charge shot, which isn't quite as powerful as the team captain's charged shot, but is effective in its own way. For example, Birdo turns the ball into a giant egg, and boo teleports/vanishes and reappears closer to the goal to have a better chance of making the shot. It gives you way more opportunities for strategy, instead of relying on using your teammates just to pass the ball back to your captain. Also, there is more going on. There are thwomps floating above some of the fields, lightning strikes crashing down on others, and you've always got characters doing flip moves and different stuff while they run. There is sometimes so much going on that at first, after being so used to the GC version, it can be disorienting. After about an hour, though, the GC version just feels boring in comparison. The speed is much faster. Like, maybe 40% faster, and this is welcome. The gamecube game feels like absolute molasses after playing the Wii one. There are about the same number of weapons in the Wii one, but because each character has their own charge attack, and you can have 3 different team members on your team, you feel like there is just so much more to do, that you don't notice how few weapons there are, the way you do in the GC one.   Overall, I loved the GC version. I had avoided it for years figuring it would be a mediocre cash-in, and just played it for the first time last month. My cousin and I played it for like 7 hours together and had a blast. Just this Wednesday, we tried the Wii one together for the first time, and it blew us away.   The only complaint I have, and this is the same for the GC one, is that the charged strike shots have a really really long animation time, and when you get good at doing them, you're going to spend half of the game sometimes watching these matrixesque slow motion shots. It would be nice if you could skip them, but it is a small gripe in an otherwise perfect multiplayer game."
wii,29aa0v,BangkokPadang,2,Sat Jun 28 00:30:15 2014 UTC,I will whole heatedly agree with this. I started with the gc version  obviously and then then the win version. The base game is the same but the win version feels polished. Rest assured if you liked the 1st you'll like the 2nd.

wii,291vif,risaaaa,8,Wed Jun 25 12:25:46 2014 UTC,"Make sure you set your Wii's settings to 480p and 16:9.  Just plugging component cables in will only send the 480i image to your screen, which is literally 1/2 the pixels per second of a 480p image.  Also, make sure when you say component you mean YPbPr (Green,Blue,Red,White,Red) and not composite (Yellow,White,Red).  Additionally, Resident Evil 4 Takes the letterboxed widescreen mode of the gamecube version from which its ported, and internally upscales that to fullscreen/widescreen. It was a cheap lazy way to handle this, and is unfortunate for the version which was supposed to be the ""definitive"" version of the game.  This makes RE4 one of the worst looking games on the whole console, when played on an HDTV, because it just looks like a blurry mess. This gives it nearly 1/2 the vertical resolution of a game like Mario Galaxy, which was properly designed from the ground up for a 480p 16:9 screen.

wii,291vif,PhotoJim99,1 point,Wed Jun 25 19:22:22 2014 UTC,"This could be it.  If it's a really huge HDTV, it'll exaggerate the poor quality of the Wii's video.  My Wii U looks alright in Wii mode on my 46"" 1080p plasma and my Wii looks excellent on my 32"" 720p LCD.  But the bigger you go and the closer you sit, the worse off you'll be."
wii,291vif,bigsphinxofquartz,1 point,Thu Jun 26 01:51:28 2014 UTC,"480i on the Wii looks great on your 480i SDTV CRT because you're maxing out the available resolution of the display, so of course it will look sharp. On a 1080p display, you're working with more than double of both the vertical and horizontal resolution, so by design, you're going to be dealing with your TV either processing the Wii's smaller resolution into big, chunky aliased pixels, or into a blurry image. The Wii is in SD, and the Wii U when playing Wii games is also just upscaling 480p content (the chunky pixels approach), so unless you're emulating what you're playing through your computer on Dolphin, that's just the way it is.  Personally, I think that the Wii looks pretty great on an LCD if you're realistic about what you're doing and what you're getting, I just hate the lag on the 240p Virtual Console games."

They made the roster more balanced, added Roy and Mewtwo, more stages, and vastly improved the gameplay. Think Melee, but more characters, better balance, and orgasms. You don't have to soft-mod it for Project M, unless you don't have a copy of Brawl.  Also, soft-mod it. This opens up a lot of fantastic homebrew and emulation opportunities. The potential for piracy is also nice, but at the very least, you get to try out the vast library of neat homebrew software. It's very easy to soft-mod a Wii at any firmware these days. Alls you need is an SD Card.  As for real games, Red Steel 2, Kirby Return to Dreamland, Resident Evil/House of the Dead on-rail shooters, Madworld, and Rhythm Heaven."

wii,28b6v2,EdmundKeppler,5,Mon Jun 16 20:44:02 2014 UTC,"I definitely dont regret owning the component cables as it also allows you to play some gamecube games in progressive scan mode, which costs about $100 if you try to do it with the actual gamecube.  If you plan on using SNES emulators then the classic controller you want is probably the one that is similar to the SNES controller. I believe its just called the classic controller, not the pro."
wii,28b6v2,swilliams508,3,Mon Jun 16 21:59:30 2014 UTC,"The CC Pros are still more comfortable than the original CCs for SNES games, in my opinion. The original Classic Controllers kind of stick out in a rounded way in the back in a way that the SNES controllers didn't, so the feeling in your hands still isn't quite the same, and honestly, the original Classic Controller would make my hands cramp out after a while a lot more than the original SNES controller ever did. This has never been a problem with the CC Pro, and I would argue that it's actually more comfortable than the SNES controller."
wii,28b6v2,bigsphinxofquartz,2,Wed Jun 18 07:17:03 2014 UTC,I have the regular classic controller that you are referring to and i love it. The only downside to it is that it has to plugged into the bottom of a wii mote. Somewhere I had read that they were no longer selling the classic controller tho so I'm not sure how hard to find it will be but I highly recommend looking for one.
wii,28b6v2,pfly50,2,Tue Jun 17 01:27:56 2014 UTC,"A few weeks ago I checked several brick and mortar stores including Target, Walmart, Meijer, Best Buy, and Gamestop, only one location nearby had any White CC Pros and no black versions left. Amazon has the official Nintendo controllers for $40 each. They are officially no longer in production and it has been confirmed by Nintendo."
wii,28b6v2,RH2427,4,Tue Jun 17 01:57:38 2014 UTC,"Component cables can be had for less than $5 on monoprice.com. They make the Wii look so much better. The vivid color separation these cables provide is well worth the couple of bucks. Plus, a 480p progressive image literally renders twice the pixels per frame, compared to a 480i signal (which is what composite carries). For the low price, it is absolutely a no-brainer.  As far as the classic controller, until the WiiU Pro controller came out, the classic controller was, to me, the absolute best controller Nintendo had ever put out. The joysticks feel firm and springy, and the quality of the controller is just really nice. The layout is a basic gathering of your ABXY buttons, Shoulder buttons and Z buttons (on each side of the controller, finally!) but the thing that shines is the D-Pad. The feel of this particular D-pad is, quite possibly, the finest in all of Video Gamedom."

They're amazing, much better than the regular Classic Controller, although I like that hard-to-grip option too.   Component cables are a must unless you use a fat CRT TV like me. ;D"
wii,28b6v2,Presto99,2,Tue Jun 17 09:28:32 2014 UTC,"Classic Controller Pros can sometimes show up used in local shops or Craigslist for much cheaper than eBay or Amazon. I actually just picked up one from a pawn shop today for $3 that didn't look like it had been used much at all, and my girlfriend found one for $15 recently. It's very worth it, one of the most comfortable ""traditional"" controllers I've ever used.  I would say that if you're going to cheap out on one or the other, I would advise you to cheap out on the official component tables. All sorts of companies have made versions of Wii component cables, and my understanding is that most generally work just fine, but virtually all of the third party Classic Controllers have wretchedly poor reviews. Stick official on the controller."

Now admittedly its still only 480p with them but that p makes a crap load of difference to clarity. Not as sharp as say a Dreamcast on a VGA box but damn pretty compared to without. The loss of blur is win alone. I would say that component is an actual necessity for the Wii.  The classic controller is also excellent though so many original Wii games do not support it, its only really worth it if you are going to use wiiware and virtual arcade too, on saying that I could not play Mario Kart Wii without it."

The jacket felt flimsier, but the larger 1 and 2 buttons and larger D-pad were nice to have sometimes, and I used the Wand frequently in beating New Super Mario Bros. Wii and Punch-Out!!, even if the shape of the D-pad and the buttons were a little different from what I was used to. I did feel like the diagonals on the D-pad were occasionally a bit wonkier than on the official remote, though. The speaker was actually clearer and louder than on the official remote, so that's a plus.  I'm really not sure what, if anything, Nyko does visually on the Wand controllers to differentiate between the MotionPlus-included versions and the older ones like mine without MotionPlus, so be forewarned to specifically keep an eye out for MotionPlus versions of the Wand, if you're going that route."

I'd recommend trying though, it is a fun relaxed series."

It is the most recent and most refined. Rune Factory Frontier is fantastic, except for runey management where you have to balance 4 types of spirits in each section of your world. Get's old. I really liked Tides of Destiny, but it is the least like a traditional Harvest Moon game. If I could get only one, it would be a toss up between Animal Parade and Rune Factory Frontier."

Not only can it not just plug into the wall anywhere (it has to sort of daisy chain itself to the normal Wii power supply, though if you have an extra one of those you can set it up somewhere else) but it's pretty much already broken.  The one battery seems to hold its charge (when you put them in the cradle, the LED starts out as red and it will change to blue when fully charged) but the other one is seemingly useless already (I've had 360 controller battery packs eventually not be able to hold any charge whatsoever as well, though after years, not after using it twice).

It is crazy, and you are constantly doing arcade-style beatemup missions, as well as fighting mini games, all while doing it with a crazy-upgradable light saber, and anime-style over the top blood going everywhere. When you cut a guys head off, it sprays out blood and mario-style coins. No other game comes close to being as fast paced and off the wall as this one, and all the fighting and jobs, etc build up for some pretty amazing boss battles.  Also, Sega's Ghost Squad can be found for like $5, and is a great on-rails shooter game (like a military virtua cop), with each mission having various branching paths, yet only taking about 7 or 8 minutes to complete. The goal is to replay each mission a bunch of times, ultimately taking each path, so it is fun to play for 30 minutes to an hour, and then pop something else in, but it is endlessly fun to come back to. It is actually one of my favorite casual Wii games.  The Conduit is a pretty incredible first person shooter, and is probably the very best looking game on the wii console. There are all kinds of lighting and reflection techniques used to simulate more advanced techniques like bump mapping, normal mapping, HDR lighting, and depth of field effects. At a glance, it looks like an early Xbox 360 game. Another great thing about it is that it lets you adjust the controls in minute detail, adjusting not just ""sensitivity,"" but specific details of the controls such as the turn box, dead zone, etc. The story is pretty typical ""Aliens attack and a weird sci-fi artifact gives you powers"" type story, but taken as a whole package, it is really great to play through, not to long, and just the right level of difficulty. If you really like it, there are collectibles in the form of ""artifacts"" to come back and find/scan.  Finally, I suggest Scarface: The World is Yours. It is pretty much a GTA-clone, but it is the best one for this console by far. The story is enthralling, and most importantly, the shooting mechanics feel phenomenal. The music has that great 80s vibe, and the game is always motivating, with constant gang wars to fight, and new missions to play which unlocks new real estate, etc. It is also really cool to just run around as Tony Montana, unlocking new vehicles and guns. Plus, you can make a little extra money running around town dealing cocaine, and laundering the money, which has a fun skill-based mini game to determine how good of a deal you buy/sell coke for, and how low an interest rate you get on your laundered money. Everything about this game is better than I would have ever imagined, when I first looked at what I thought was an obvious GTA: Vice City clone. This game is absolutely it's own game, and worth playing because there is just so much to do.  I hope some of these suggestions help."

wii,27ikim,raintheory,1 point,Sat Jun 7 16:05:22 2014 UTC,Sin and Punishment is an N64 game on the Wii Virtual Console. Its actual Wii sequel: Sin and Punishment: Star Successor is also supposed to be very good. They are in the same genre as star fox where you have to shoot at enemies while dodging.  Little King's Story is a sort of RTS game where you command an army that has a lot of good action and strategy. It plays a lot like Pikmin.  Speaking of Pikmin: New Play Control! Pikmin is a Wii re-release of the original.  Pandora's Tower is an action game with enough story to be interesting. It doesn't really get bogged down with story but there is kind of a weird dating sim thing going on at the same time. I would recommend watching a detailed video review.  Donkey Kong Country Returns is a challenging 2D platformer. I don't think it needs a lot of description because it's exactly what you would expect it to be.

There is a nikita battery that can be used but if you search you'll find people have had problems installing them. It's up to you how you wanna power it.

wii,27ffmb,longjohndevine,1 point,Fri Jun 6 08:26:41 2014 UTC,"I've tried 3 different charging stands like this and they are all awful.  They all share the same huge problem. The power drains from them so quickly between charges that they are almost never charged when you need them. The reason is because they only check to see if the batteries are charged when you first set it down on the base. If the base sees they are low, then it will charge them. Once the batteries are full they stop charging. Then, for whatever reason, the batteries drain very fast (within 2 or 3 days) and once they're drained, the base station won't check to see if they're full again until you manually pick the wiimote up off the base and set it back down.  You would have to make it a point to pick all your Wiimotes up about once a day to make sure they're charged when you need them.  The other problem this creates is that your batteries sit around in a totally drained state a great deal of the time, which is terrible for the resiliency of the batteries. Within a year, the battery packs would only hold a 15 minute charge.  The final issue is that THIS is the closest thing to ""colored"" battery packs I was ever able to find. You'd have to buy the white battery packs and spray paint them with a  close enamel to have anything close to what you require.  About 3 years ago I switched to just swapping out rechargeable batteries whenever I needed to, and I have never been happier.  So far, 3/4 people have said, from experience, not to buy these charging stations. Take our advice."

wii,27ajkc,Hoban9331,13,Wed Jun 4 14:18:34 2014 UTC,"Yes and No.  The Wii U has a option to go into Wii mode, and you will be able to access your Wii games there if you do a Wii System Transfer.  This permanently moves the games from your old Wii to the Virtualized Wii on the Wii U.   Then, if the games you purchased on Wii are available on Wii U, you can pay a small fee ($1 or $1.50) and have the Wii U virtual console version.  This adds off screen play, better save state options, and 1080p resolution."

wii,2788o1,khanweezy1,1 point,Wed Jun 4 04:40:44 2014 UTC,"There's lots of them on Craigslist. If one seller looks a little skeevy, try someone else.  Friends and family are a great way to find one. Everyone bought a Wii, it seems, and after a month a lot of them went into storage because the novelty wore off. As long as the batteries in the Wiimote didn't leak all over the place, they'll be in great shape."
wii,2788o1,Novaova,1 point,Wed Jun 4 18:24:26 2014 UTC,"Exactly. Most people don't even want em anymore, leaving us plenty of opportunities to get out hands on one!  Also, on the Wiimote battery topic, I use rechargeable ones that came with my Apple Magic Mouse, which in turns works out cheaper than constantly buying batteries. :)"
wii,2788o1,CeejayMode,3,Wed Jun 4 21:34:59 2014 UTC,"Best spot for cheap ones I have found is Craigslist. You can find complete collections with controllers and a bunch of games for much cheaper than most stores and you can bargain the price down a bit usually. But again, you are taking a gamble in terms of reliability. Maybe look for more recent models, like the black or red colored ones? But I don't know if they are any better in terms of reliability and I think you lose GameCube compatibility with the more recent releases. Most CL sellers I have dealt with will let you test out the console before you buy it from them."

wii,275v8u,NintendoGuy128,4,Tue Jun 3 09:58:33 2014 UTC,"I really liked the level design and the roster, but the driving wasn't nearly as much fun as Double Dash. The Wii version was also more item-centric than it's predecessors, which meant that the skill of the driver wasn't nearly as important as the luck of the draw with the items. Of course, Mario Kart has always had a heavy focus on items, but I feel that in the earlier titles (especially Double Dash) a driver's skill could be more than enough to compensate for a bad item draw."
wii,275v8u,aninfiniteseries,5,Tue Jun 3 02:28:22 2014 UTC,"I only played Double Dash a little but I do remember that I always felt slightly out of control with the driving, because it really felt like the kart was leaning out when you turned.  It probably had the most realistic driving physics of the Mario Kart series."
wii,275v8u,I_Actually_Hate_You,2,Tue Jun 3 04:56:20 2014 UTC,"One thing that always gets me about this game is that the items are absolutely brutal, as well as the computers. I think it definitely says something that I beat 150cc in MK8 in a couple days, but I still haven't beat 150 in MKWii.

wii,275qx1,tempestjg,3,Tue Jun 3 00:38:18 2014 UTC,"Well, you need to point in order to choose which star in a level you are after,  and some stars require you to point to use the pull stars.  Most of the time you'll just be using the control stick and A and B buttons though.  Pointing is one of the things the Wii does really well so I'm not sure why you're worried about that."

wii,275qx1,NintendoGuy128,3,Tue Jun 3 17:34:57 2014 UTC,"Nope. They act as a sensor bar. The wii remote picks up the ir radiation from the candles and thinks it's a sensor bar. Very useful if you've ever had one break, like I did."

Cords and the like will cost another 10 dollars. A refurbished wiimote and nunchuck combo from nintendo is 20 dollars. MKWii, which comes with the mini, also can be found for 10-20 dollars used. That's a $70 dollar total, maybe 80-90, possibly 100 dollars depending on your location.  Also, the original wii can display at 480p, while the mini can't because it only uses composite. The mini also doesn't have an SD card slot, which without it, you can't homebrew and take advantage of emulators or media programs on the wii, nor can you expand your wii storage. The wii mini also lost one usb port, so it only has 1 instead of two on the original. Also, it's red and matte black, with a top loader instead of a slot loader. Hope that helps."

It can play natively wii, gamecube games, It can officially emulate N64, GB, GBA, NES, SNES games. It can unofficially emulate PS and almost any other older console and act as a media device. That's the best wii you can have. Most wii owners would say the same.  But to answer your original question, all wii's are buffed gamecubes. But the wii mini only accepts composite and only supports 360p. (the original wii with a cheap third party cable supports 480p). So it also depends on your screen.

Plus got a USB loader and can play wii games. Not sure if you can do it on WiiU (can you?) but ended up getting 10,000+ new and old games for $80. So yeah, all morality and ethics aside, home brew FTW!"
wii,272nwf,choof3199,2,Mon Jun 2 13:36:35 2014 UTC,"Being in Europe, I can't speak definitely on the price, but I think you should easily be able to pick up a used Wii for under $50. Look for the older model that came with the stand, the newer ones have some features removed including internet access in the latest revision (the Wii Mini).  The NES and SNES games are sold through an on-line store (the Wii Shop Channel) that you access on your Wii. NES games are $5 and SNES games are $8. You can pay by credit card or by using a prepaid Nintendo Points Card. Though I imagine those won't be available for too much longer.  Once you've paid for a game, it's downloaded automatically to your Wii and you can launch it from the console's menu. All Wiis (except the Wii Mini) have built-in WiFi and I don't think there are any specific internet speed requirements. I was able to use the shop fine with a 2 Mbps connection back in 2007.  One thing you'll definitely need to get before you can play SNES games though is either a Classic Controller or a Classic Controller Pro. NES games you can play with just the Wii remote, but the Wii won't even start up a SNES game unless you have one of the classic controllers connected. (A GameCube controller would also work but it's button layout makes some games like Donkey Kong Country harder to play)   And something else to consider: there isn't a massive amount of storage on a Wii (only 512 MB) so if you're planning on buying dozens of games, it might be worth getting an SD card so you have more space to play around with. I think the biggest size that's supported is 16GB, but it might be more."
wii,272nwf,JiliK,4,Mon Jun 2 21:58:28 2014 UTC,"Honestly I'd buy a wiiu pro controller, a mayflash usb adapter, and google ""snes emulator"", then go download roms galore."

Rock Band 2, from my understanding, should have simply lost online play and leaderboard functionality from the Wi-Fi Connection shutdown.  If the game did use the Wi-Fi Connection for paid DLC, I'm not sure what to tell you other than to talk to Nintendo themselves."

wii,26u6k5,Cornerb0y,3,Fri May 30 04:44:37 2014 UTC,"I have to throw out a relevant comment for all older console users (pertaining to the ""throw out your composite cables"" part): it is probably overlooked by most people other than the hardcore collectors/gamers, but there's often better cables available for your favourite systems.  Case in point, I grew up with Sega Genesis but only ever had the RF connector, but there's composite available and it looks so much better.  For PS2/OG Xbox/Gamecube/Dreamcast, they all have S-video options (for SDTVs) and for the first three, component (great even on SDTVs if your TV has the inputs, even better and pretty much required if you have an HDTV, though the Gamecube version is very expensive unless you just play them on Wii instead, which is a good option) - for Dreamcast you'll need a VGA box for progressive scan/higher quality stuff than S-video.  Even the NES and Sega Master System has composite which is leaps and bounds better than the RF that a lot of people might be used to (for both, you can use adapters to split the mono to two channels to plug into a stereo setup, still mono but nice to have it come through both speakers)."

wii,26w1w7,JopHabLuk,0,Sat May 31 10:34:43 2014 UTC,losing weight is 100 percent diet. if you aren't calorie counting then exercise is worthless.
wii,26nr8z,ambi94,5,Wed May 28 01:50:12 2014 UTC,Best suggestion I can make is Craigslist. Nintendo games tend to hold their values so it doesn't surprise me that it's selling for between $30-40 still. Amazon shows a few disc-only versions in the $20+shipping range. Might also find a reasonable priced copy at a mom & pop local game store. I'd normally suggest Half Price Books (if you have one nearby) but they just had a 20% off weekend so I'd imagine most are picked over.
wii,26nr8z,ZzyzxExile,3,Wed May 28 02:19:00 2014 UTC,"Why do Nintendo games hold their value, whereas PS3 and XBOX games do not?"
wii,26nr8z,PontiusPirate666,3,Wed May 28 18:55:43 2014 UTC,"I'd say it is due to the quality. Nintendo almost always makes really good games that people are going to want to play years down the road. I would guess that people also tend to hang onto them longer/trade them in less, and when they do trade them in I tend to not see them on the shelves very long (at least that's the case with the game stores I frequent). So even though millions are printed, the demand and lack of supply (comparatively speaking of course) keeps the used game prices higher, especially for mainstays like Mario or Zelda titles. There are certainly exceptions to this (Kirby's Epic Yarn and Metriod Other M spring immediately to mind as titles that are in the sub-$10 range now), but overall I'm much more comfortable with purchasing a Nintendo-made game and knowing it's more likely to keep its value.  Of course, Nintendo also tends to not lower their prices on older games as often (or ever, in some cases), so that doesn't help things either.   And just to be clear, I'm talking about the actual company Nintendo as opposed to an entire console - certainly 3rd party companies wouldn't hold true to this just for being on a Nintendo system."
wii,26nr8z,ZzyzxExile,1 point,Wed May 28 20:57:51 2014 UTC,"Nintendo rarely reduces the prices of their system seller games (Mario Kart, Smash Bros, Zelda). The people who buy them rarely re-sell them, because they play them forever."

Buy quality, not Chinese crap, though there's Chinese non-crap. Check Amazon user reviews for this.  Saves you a HDMI port as well because likely nothing else uses the YPbPr input anyway."

I'm looking for a worst case scenario solution in that I can avoid using that port entirely and just stick with HDMI for everything."

I love that guide. Once you've done all that you'll be set for a HUGE amount of options for your wii, including an extraordinary amount of old games thanks to emulators. Also for emulators, this guide offers the basics: http://www.howtogeek.com/139638/how-to-play-retro-nes-and-snes-games-on-your-nintendo-wii/ The basic instructions in that guide can also be used to set up different emulators, as they share the same structures. You would need certain controllers for the different emulators, and I've heard that for SNES games the wiimote is terrible. I have a gamecube controller, but you could invest in a Classic Controller Pro if you only have a wiimote, as it does the job of playing old games fairly well too. There are also quite a few emulators for the wii, including: Wii64 - Emulator to play Nintendo 64 games. Link: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Wii64 Snes9xGX - SNES emulator. Link: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Snes9x_GX VBA GX - Visual Boy Advance emulator - http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Visual_Boy_Advance_GX WiiSX - Playstation 1 emulator: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/WiiSX Even more: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Emulator These apps are pretty popular too, try seeing what they all do: http://www.codemii.com/hbbstats.php These tutorials also offer plenty to help you with: http://www.wiihacks.com/recommended-faqs-guides-tutorials-only/ Hope I helped!"

If so you might be out of luck. If the Homebrew Channel option works (even if there are no apps at the moment) then the simplest option would be to install a homebrew disc launcher. I'd go with Riivolution as I know it works and will boot games normally unless you tell it otherwise.  Step 1) Use the download link on the following page: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Riivolution  Step 2) Make a folder on an SD card called 'apps'  Step 3) extract the riivolution folder from the zip file you downloaded in step 1 and put that in the apps folder.  Step 4) put the SD card in the Wii, boot it up and select the homebrew channel.  Step 5) if you've done the above steps correctly an option for Riivolution should appear in the homebrew list. Select and load it.  Step 6) select launch game, your Wii will now play whatever is in the disc drive as normal.  ""But now Priiloader doesn't even appear for some reason what do I do?""  If this happens just hold the reset button the next time you boot up the Wii, that should take you to Priiloader.  Good luck."

wii,2628sv,metalknite,3,Tue May 20 20:50:07 2014 UTC,"If your feeling kinda adventurous/stupid/brave you can pop the guy open and re apply some better quality thermal paste, and clean it out really good.   http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Nintendo+Wii+Heat+Sink+Replacement/3458  It's not a hard job just a time consuming one, and there very well might be some minor damage done. But I would only attempt this if your willing to loose it to the possibility to messing up. Make sure you have all the tools you need first as well as some new thermal pads or paste. And the reasons most these modern consoles die is due to not using lead on the processor pins anymore and to major heat buildup causing said non lead covered pins to wear down faster  It is a lot of fun opening stuff like this up and seeing the inner workings and all so give it some thought!"
wii,2628sv,JakeOLantern,2,Tue May 20 22:54:00 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the tip, I have applied thermal paste to computer processors before so I think I can manage this :P and If my console die I have a reason to buy a Wii U  :D"
wii,2628sv,JakeOLantern,3,Tue May 20 23:29:00 2014 UTC,"I would hold off on the Wii U a little longer if it was me, I got a launch console and have a hunch a price drop or newer model might be coming soon since nintendo isn't doing so hot from it."

wii,26150b,King_Card,2,Tue May 20 15:12:33 2014 UTC,"This is my fear of sending my Wii in for service.  I'm probably more paranoid because my friend's Wii stopped working all together, and somehow, Nintendo was unable to retrieve any of his data.  I will never understand how they couldn't just transfer the contents of the broken Wii's hard drive to the new one.    I would get on the phone with Nintendo Customer Service and make absolutely sure that your data won't be lost.  If it wasn't for the bullshit restrictions that don't allow you to copy some types of data to an SD card, this wouldn't be an issue."
wii,26150b,I_Actually_Hate_You,2,Tue May 20 15:47:00 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the Wii I have is actually a replacement from an old Wii I think shorted out. I had a case that stuck around the Wii, and they couldn't open it. Boom, goodbye save data. So I'm a little pararnoid.  You know, it's not like the whole wii doesn't work, it's just the disk drive that malfunctions. So I've got some hope."
wii,26150b,King_Card,1 point,Tue May 20 15:56:00 2014 UTC,What kind of a case was it?

wii,260eli,NOBLExGAMER,2,Tue May 20 06:35:47 2014 UTC,I have one. They increase the resolution but it's still not HD. Things may look a bit crisper but that's about it.
wii,260eli,olioster,3,Tue May 20 09:09:01 2014 UTC,Ok would you recommend getting the component cable instead then?
wii,260eli,ThatGraemeGuy,3,Tue May 20 11:42:26 2014 UTC,"I have a 32"" 1080p TV. The difference between composite and component is significant. The picture is sharper and the colours more vibrant. Definitely worth it. I don't see that HDMI would be better, the only real reason to use it I guess is if your TV can't do component for some weird reason."
wii,260eli,olioster,1 point,Tue May 20 20:14:30 2014 UTC,Oh definitely component over composite.
wii,260eli,olioster,2,Tue May 20 21:35:03 2014 UTC,About the same result far as I can tell. Go with either.
wii,260eli,olioster,2,Tue May 20 13:28:34 2014 UTC,I just want to add that the only reason I got an HDMI adapter for my Wii is so I could hook it up with the rest of my consoles to an HDMI switch.
wii,260eli,I_Actually_Hate_You,2,Tue May 20 21:35:53 2014 UTC,"No, it only upscales the resolution, and if you're playing on an HDTV the TV will probably do that for you anyway.  Stick with the component cables."
wii,260eli,bigsphinxofquartz,1 point,Tue May 20 16:14:47 2014 UTC,"What if, given that most modern TVs have 3-4 HDMI HDMI ports but only one shared component/composite set of jacks, you just want to use an HDMI port instead to keep the composite open for a VCR or NES or something? These converters don't have really poor quality upscaling or anything that would make a person not want to use one, right?"
wii,260eli,I_Actually_Hate_You,2,Wed May 21 00:46:54 2014 UTC,"I would assume you're right.  Of course, there are bad products everywhere so just do your research before buying."

The online minigames (all those channels) never were that great to begin with. Online play was rare (but awesome with things like Kart I'll admit).  Other than that, I have about 30 Wii and GC discs (plus there's homebrew) that still play fine.

If you ask me,  Nintendo still is the king of couch multi-player fun.  I keep the system hooked up to play Project M and Mario Kart Wii as well as all my N64 virtual console games and entire Gamecube library.  Those games are timelessly fun and as long as I still have friends around,  I don't think I'll boxing up my Wii any time soon.

Both are really chill games that are actually fun and educational (yeah, really). When my daughter was around 7 though, she thought the sharks were scary in Blue World. The first Endless Ocean doesn't really have aggressive creatures.   Animal Crossing City Folk. Even though the online component is gone, it is still a sweet game. You can both have houses in the same town.  Rhythm Heaven Fever. Fun Rhythm Game. Generally only uses 1 or 2 buttons, but can get tricky later on. Early levels are easy though.   Another Lego game that is really good is the Star Wars Trilogy. I think it is the best of the Lego games, and is pretty easy."

Epic Yarn is very easy (to the extent that you can't die), but is still a charming game in its own right with fun gameplay.  Adventure Wii/Return to Dream Land (depending on your region) offers more challenge, but is a fairly lengthy and very solid game, as well as a bit more variety in terms of levels.  If she's into series like Batman, they might be a little cutesy for her, but don't write them off on looks alone, they are both a lot of fun. Hope that was of some help!"

If that doesn't solve the problem, many times ejecting the disc and putting it back will let you continue without restarting."

wii,25eesz,Fjohurs_Lykkewe,2,Tue May 13 01:12:06 2014 UTC,"I don't think that deleting and redownloading will do any good. I think that both of these two games were released before the Z + A + 2 (or was it 1?) trick to switch Virtual Console games into 480i (instead of 240p, which some HDTVs can't handle) started getting added to VC games, and I'm not sure that they were ever updated. Are you definitely entering the button combination on the Operations Manual screen?  If all else fails, I'd call Nintendo. Their customer service is always really gracious and generous, and if they don't have a way to fix the games for your TV, I'm sure they would probably offer a refund, or an exchange for other games that are 480i-compatible."

wii,259ijk,Ullabb,2,Sun May 11 17:01:39 2014 UTC,"GameStop had more ""used"" (actually new) copies made, or at least made more available, but they're still $50."
wii,259ijk,bigsphinxofquartz,2,Mon May 12 08:25:30 2014 UTC,"The Mario Galaxy games definitely have mandatory point and click sections. Sometimes you have to collect star bits to open a path, and you can't always collect them strictly from Mario picking them up, and then there are the sections where you have to point and beam from star to star.  SMG2 is arguably worse in this, because anything involving Yoshi's tongue is point and click."
wii,259ijk,bigsphinxofquartz,1 point,Mon May 12 08:22:25 2014 UTC,"Are the pointing sections very frequent/lengthy?  I was interested in the Galaxy games, but yeah that concerns me."
wii,259ijk,bigsphinxofquartz,1 point,Wed May 14 08:55:01 2014 UTC,"They generally aren't longer than a minute apiece, but as I recall, there are at least a couple of hidden levels that use the point and click star-beaming exclusively, so at least getting the full 120/240 stars may be out of the question.  The beaming sections don't appear as frequently as the shaking to be launched out from a star sections (which are basically in every level and one of the core mechanics of the game, it's what Mario is doing on the cover, after all), but I'd say that they still turn up on average about every third level.  There may be a longer mandatory point and click section that I'm forgetting,  but at least for just playing enough to see the ending, accumulating stars is pretty flexible about letting you choose what you want to beat.  There is plenty of necessary shaking the remote though for one task or another throughout the game though, so if you're wary of motion controls, keep that in mind..."
wii,259ijk,Ullabb,1 point,Wed May 14 09:05:18 2014 UTC,Xenoblade looks good (though pricey).  Thanks for the suggestion.
wii,259ijk,Aeidios,2,Wed May 14 08:53:20 2014 UTC,"This was actually way harder than i thought it would be. The only ones i can think of right now where you don't need motion controls would be mariokart and brawl.   If I remember correctly, you can play fire emblem perfectly fine with one hand, I'm not sure if you can play that with a nunchuck attached or not.   The lego games might be an option.  Most racing games can probably be played without motion controls.    You could always take a look at the e-shop for some virtual console games.  One other thing you could try, is looking for games which support the classic controller, you could find quite a few of those with minimal to no motion controls."
wii,259ijk,Ullabb,2,Sun May 11 15:48:31 2014 UTC,"One of OP's main problems though was that holding a traditional-style controller requires their arms to be very close together whereas with the Wiimote+Nunchuk combo, you can hold them much more comfortably."
wii,259ijk,Aeidios,1 point,Mon May 12 23:59:33 2014 UTC,"I feel like you misunderstood me a little bit, I thought that mabye (just mabye) games with support for the wii classic controller would have less focus on motion controls. And as far as i know, you can use the wiimote+nunchuck combo on most games where you can use the classic controller.  I was just throwing things out though, so it's probably a bad idea either way."

I'd thought of this before, but I lot of the classic controller games I looked up actually didn't support the Wiimote+nunchuck, just the Wiimote turned sideways.  Could still be promising though, as there's a lot I didn't investigate yet."

I enjoyed the campaign's levels and story and I replayed levels trying to get high scores, higher difficulty, and medals in it. The gameplay is really arcade'y and the motion controls work well (although like the new ace combat games, I think it gives you a bit too much of a scoring bonus for using the ""automatically get behind them ability""). The story is really cool, it's about a world where world peace has been established but people love war too much so 2 companies war with each other for the amusement of the citizens. It's a prequel to an Anime movie, so there are even a few cutscenes of really high quality. The dub on them is okay, but overall voice acting is pretty good (After playing the game I Netflix'd the movie and personally preferred the game, I kinda expected more combat in the movie based on one of the trailers, but the movie was just kinda trippy)  The only thing that was really disappointing was the lack of split screen (or online) multiplayer, although you can have a second person act as a gunner in the style of Super Mario Galaxy 2.

wii,23xayu,longjohndevine,3,Sat Apr 26 20:01:21 2014 UTC,"I think that Skyward Sword is the best Zelda for the Wii. Mainly because it was designed for the Wii and utilizes the wii's feature set quite well.  http://www.edge-online.com/review/legend-zelda-skyward-sword-review/  The music, dungeon design, gameplay and boss battles are the highlights of this Zelda (for me) (THE BOSS BATTLES WHERE AMAZING IMO - Scaldera rocked (pun intended) the music for that boss was brilliant)  Story wasn't best in series (but it was still good)  ps. Are you a Zelda fan? Have you played the old ones?  Zelda is Zelda, you should have an idea of what to expect if you've played them before. They are all very, very good games. Honestly, I'd recommend that you play both Twilight Princess AND Skyward Sword.  Do not consider Link's Crossbow training. It's only an enjoyable distraction. Nothing more."
wii,23xayu,cnskatefool,2,Fri Apr 25 08:23:54 2014 UTC,"Ahem... The Story WASNT THE BEST?!?!?!  What the hell game were you playing, there is room for opinions to debate this for all other Zelda games except SS.  No other game put the attention to detail in to making the world raise so many questions, while never directly addressing them until far FAR later.  Fuck my mind is still blown"
wii,23xayu,longjohndevine,2,Fri Apr 25 09:58:14 2014 UTC,"I loved the story. I just didn't think it was the BEST.  Do not attack my Zelda opinions sir. I'm pretty sure my knowledge, love and experience of the Zelda series are very likely to outweigh your own.  I just thought Windwaker, Link's awakening and Majora's Mask had better storylines than Skyward Sword, that is all.  I loved the story in Skyward Sword myself. I wouldn't personally rank it as the best Zelda story.  Personally the story in Windwaker is my fave.  Raising questions is fine, I'd have preferred if more of them had been answered by the games conclusion."
wii,23xayu,cnskatefool,2,Fri Apr 25 10:17:50 2014 UTC,"Wind Waker knocked down some huge Zelda conventions.  The fact that they made clear link doesn't have to be link and Zelda doesn't have to be Zelda was bold, so bold.  It helped lend credence  to the timeline and open possibilities for the series.  It was also my favorite game until I played SS.  The only thing which really pushed me in to the SS bandwagon was my eternal desire to be link was brought closer to fruition with motion controls, and the story was just stupefying.  It crushes the WW story like a bug under my shoe... Imo. Full disclosure, WW didn't make me cry, twice like SS did... And not to take anything away from WW but the best part was BY FAR the intro where they recap OoT with the flute.  So good, and it's a shame they started so strong because they couldn't too that emotion at any point in the game."

wii,23xayu,The_Darknut_Rises,1 point,Fri Apr 25 04:28:44 2014 UTC,Your options are Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword (or Link's Crossbow Training). Both of them are considered pretty much perfect and scored plenty of 10/10 when they were released. Who can say which you'll enjoy more?  The differences are in art style (quite significant) and motion controls. Skyward Sword requires motion+ and probably has better implemented motion controls.

It is the thirteenth installment in The Legend of Zelda series. Originally planned for release in November 2005, Twilight Princess was delayed by Nintendo to allow its developers to refine the game, add more content and port it to the Wii.  The Wii version was also released alongside the Wii console on November 19, 2006, in North America, and in December 2006 in Japan, Europe, and Australia. This made Twilight Princess the first Zelda game released at the launch of a Nintendo console. The GameCube version was released in December 2006, and was the last Nintendo-published game for the console, as well as the final official GameCube game released in Japan.

That site is also good for finding mods you can do to the case/controllers and whatnot.   before you do any of this, know that it voids the warranty and has the possibility of bricking your wii  Check out the homebrew site here and see what applications are kicking around.   You can transfer Wii game files to a USB drive and play them directly from the Wii. Use this guide.   Lastly, if you do this, update the system before you soft mod it.

You'll have to install cfg usb loader and plug into the back of the wii. Now here is the sad part, I have no idea where you would download your games from as I ripped mine to the hard drive from the my wii. This allows for faster load times with a bonus of the young ones not messing up the disk.  In total you will need a sd memory card (I like a 8gb), and you'll need an external hard drive. Not all external drives work with the wii though. You can pm me with any questions, and I'll try to answer as best I can. I am not an expert though."

The chief benefit for me is that I run all my devices through a Monoprice HDMI switch box, and then one single cable from that box into my AVR, and finally an HDMI cable to the TV.  Since my AVR doesn't convert to HDMI, it meant running Wii cables (Component or Composite, what have you) into their own port on the AVR and a second set of cables to the TV. Much messier."

Sometimes you don't really know until you use the thing and the buttons/sticks don't seem to respond 100% correctly. But the box could just be a repackaging job from this particular seller.

The interface on Wii isn't especially great for searching or browsing (I don't think that you can look at a specific channel's profile or its videos without subscribing to them), but YouTube Remote does offer at least a bit of a cure for that issue.

The reality is that when these products are first made, they are not all fully tested. They crank them off the line as quick as possible, and do lot samples, so they only fully test one in so many hundred or thousand.  Refurbs are units that were faulty and sent back. They have to be fully tested and repaired because the company begins losing money at that point. They make sure it is ready to go, because the more it has to be repaired, the more labor they have to pay a technician.  Buy refurb from the shop on Nintendo.com. You get the same 1 year warranty a new unit gets and you can be assured that it was properly repaired.  Source: I'm an Environmental Stress Test Technician, so I do this very thing described above."

Its not that great a point to say future 3D Mario games are better than the first one that came out in 1996. They were emulating the first game and building on it, like sequels should.   Of course they SHOULD be better, they had many years to improve on the formula.. And to be honest, I would still say that controlling mario is better in SM64 than the rest. SMS was very good and someone could argue that SMS is better. But Galaxy and Galaxy 2 didnt have better control. Sure they have better graphics or better levels and atmospheres, but there wasnt that much you could really do with mario (compared to the previous 2).  But if you look outside of the 3D mario games, there are few games that match them. Many 3D platformers on the PS1 or N64 were good (some great) but they were limiting in regards to the true amount of platforming. Most games had jump, or double air jump or backflip.. but SM64 is total freedom and plays very well. If you assembled a true list of GREAT 3D platformers, there are few that arent made by Nintendo  But we all have our opinions. Respect yours none the less."

wii,215x97,battletactics,1 point,Mon Mar 24 00:18:17 2014 UTC,I have an old WD 500gb elements HDD. It is more than enough if you get scrubbed ISO files. It also is quick & doesn't require an external power supply. Here is a compatibility list for USB devices for Wii: GBAtemp link

wii,215x97,BUBBLE-POPPER,1 point,Mon Mar 24 04:05:56 2014 UTC,"an .iso image that has had all of the ""filler"" data removed to save space and bandwidth. A direct 1:1 copy of a Wii game will always be 4.37gb, but if you ""scrub"" this unnecessary data, when you archive the file (eg. for storage) the total file size will be equal to the actual amount of game data on the disc, which varies from game to game. If you're looking to save space though, converting your disc images to .wbfs format can result in you being able to pack a lot more games onto your HDD before it is full."

If you like the collecting part of Lego, this game is for you. (40 red bricks, 450 gold bricks, 290 characters, 110 vehicles, super bricks, & challenges)   My first run through took 80 hrs to complete the game.  I'm on the second play through now and it's been 12 hours and I've only finished story mode of all the levels. Think GTA meets Lego."

Even if you don't use USB loading for pirate games, you gain the benefit of WAY faster loading times.  And if you want to play GameCube games, the RVL-101 is just useless."

I read that there is a lot of dvd driver model for the wii: D2A, D2B, D2C, D3 etc...  is there a one more reliable,  optimised for dvd with double layer (smash bros brawl,  donkey returns...)?"
wii,2006k1,reg_pfj,2,Mon Mar 10 07:25:43 2014 UTC,"Sorry up front because my comment won't directly address your original question.  In my opinion, you shouldn't worry too much about which version you get.  They made 100,000,000 of the damn things.  If it breaks 28 years from now, it won't be any harder to buy than an NES is right now.    So just play it and enjoy it.  When it breaks, buy another and use your broken one for spare parts or something.  It's also Nintendo's smallest console so far, so you could buy a spare right now for $40 or $50 and stick it in a closet."
wii,1zydq7,HittingSmoke,3,Sun Mar 9 08:18:45 2014 UTC,I used a Wavebird for N64 games and it was great. Using the C stick as C buttons took some getting used to but with Mario 64 and OOT it's not an issue.
wii,1zydq7,Sabin10,3,Sun Mar 9 14:05:18 2014 UTC,"The 64 virtual console games are playable, but far from ideal. The controls require a classic controller (or gamecube) and cannot be re-mapped.  The A/B buttons are on a different angle compared to the N64 pad. You can't alternate between A/B without moving your thumb, whereas on the N64 pad, you could just use the joint in your thumb to hit A  The right-stick acts like the C-buttons. So lets say you're playing Ocarina of Time and you want to use an item on the C-buttons, you have to be careful to hit the stick correctly."

I JUST finished it (after bricking it TWICE). It takes a lot of trial and error, my friend. You have to first download the homebrew channel, and then after that you'll need to look at tutorials on how to replace some files with custom files. These files are called IOSes. Basically, they are modules that the Wii relies on each one for a specific task. It takes a lot of frustration to get this stuff working, but oh boy it is worth it in the end."

wii,1zumhi,brkun,1 point,Sat Mar 8 12:46:25 2014 UTC,"The only reason it took so long was because I literally knew nothing about hacking (my dad is the one who added the homebrew channel) so I basically had to look up all this stuff and it was trial an error, mostly. But it is done finally, and now I can properply load usb backups. The only problem I am having is trying to get a good burn for DVD-Rs. I turned 3 into coasters already, so I just gave up."

Yes, if you turn all the options up for highest realism, it is pretty amazing. However, I find it hard to play with a regular Motion Plus controller. I keep a standard Wii Remote along with the plug in Motion Plus adaptor for TW - the addition length allows you to hold it much more like you do an actual club."
wii,1zfdm3,Conjugal_Burns,6,Mon Mar 3 11:34:06 2014 UTC,"Final Fantasy 4 is one of my all time favourites.  Its worth a play through,  but it is pretty long.    I found the after years to be a bit underwhelming.  It does star many of the characters introduced in FF4,  so you might get more out of it if you play the original first.   I say if you plan to play both anyway play FF4 first."
wii,1zfdm3,star_witness,3,Mon Mar 3 16:03:56 2014 UTC,"I've played FF IV, IV Interlude, and IV After Years.  Don't play After Years if you haven't played FF IV. It's ONLY fan service for those who enjoyed FF IV, and barely has any merit whatsoever as a stand alone game. Without an understanding of FF IV, After Years will be awful.  EDIT: I was rushed with my original post, so here's some more info. After Years expects you to have an understanding of the characters and their back stories. You also have to care somewhat for the characters in order to feel invested in the game. I won't recommend it unless you're a fan of FF IV."

For example you could play FF X-2 before playing FF X and still have alot of fun playing them.  Square Games are quite good when it comes to ""do i need to know what happened before playing it"".

I have a gameboy emulator on my wii, but I prefer the controller on my ps3, which also has gameboy and snes emulators. Because of that, even though I could play those games on the wii, I play them on the ps3 instead.  There's no current way to use a ps3 controller on a wii. I'm sure it's probably possible, but it'd likely need to be a hardware implementation and be way too much trouble.  I do use my ps3 controller on my computer though. Works nicely."

wii,1zb2bc,Will12239,3,Sun Mar 2 08:28:13 2014 UTC,Battle Revolution was pretty cool. It even worked with Heartgold/Soulsilver (those were released after BR). You could battle with your pokemon that you trained on the DS game using the DS as a controller. The battle animations were pretty good and it was the first Wii game with Online. I used to stomp people with my Ev pokemon.

So much functionality is removed from the Wii mini, I couldn't justify ever spending more than about $30 for a used one. Most of the included games aren't that great, either. They might fetch around $5 each used for a lot of those, but that's if the person would even want to play them.  If you're going to buy a used Wii lot online, get one of the ones with the GameCube ports on the side and the Wii logo on the far edge, to the right of the disc slot (when the Wii is set horizontally). It will probably sell for the same prices and can do so much more."

Despite being bought out they still are offering their servers and Nintendo can keep it how ever they are choosing to get rid of them. My guess is that in addition to the games and systems ages they are doing this so that they can help push wii U sales.

Nintendo, it turns out, was one such partner company for the games and services produced during the ""Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection"" era. This may be the ""behind the scenes"" reason for it."

wii,1yvmvj,KogaHarine,3,Tue Feb 25 12:20:17 2014 UTC,Wii Shop Channel only. It is WiiWare.  @OP: I beat this twice just cause it was super addicting and I got highly invested in my main hired characters. New game+ is where it is at once you beat your first playthrough since you get most of your adventurers back (They keep stats and equipment from the previous playthrough) and have the option to raise the difficulty to Hard or Very Hard.

wii,1yt66p,Charlemagne712,2,Tue Feb 25 02:04:29 2014 UTC,Endless ocean is super relaxing and easy to play. You just scuba dive underwater. You can't die and only need a Wiimote. it's fun to explore and find new fish.   Wii party or a Mario party game might go over well.   In the bargain section you might find a game called let's tap that has you put the Wiimote on a box and just tap the box to make it gently vibrate. It isn't amazing but for the $3 you'll probably pay for it I would say it's worth a shot.  I am going to mention an rpg called opoona just because you can play the whole game with just the nunchuk. I love the game but it probably isn't what you are looking for.

Orbital and Cubello might fit the bill, though there might still be a little bit of a learning curve to ""match colored cubes together on rotating core of cubes"" or ""use gravitational forces along different orbits to merge planets together"". The Endless Ocean games sound like good candidates too, though the time when I rented the second one, I couldn't get too into it, myself. I was pretty bored.  I don't often find myself recommending the Wii Play series, but I feel like those two also tend to be one-handed and intuitive in a similar manner to the Wii Sports games, and they do have the Nintendo level of craftsmanship and quality to them that you don't often find in simple Wii games developed by other companies."

I am interested in working out at home and making it fun enough for me to stick to it and not get sidetracked with housework.   I am totally not a gamer so I would only use the wii for dancing with my child and working out. My children might be interested in playing other games in it as they grow older, but i just want to get these big ol' bones moving.   I have actually also heard of people being very motivated when they start and then gradually slack off till they quit altogether... but they are not married to the fitness nazi I  married LOL (he's in the army)  if I quit he'll shame me into starting again. :)  So maybe I'm not being realistic here but as of now I don't think i'll quit.

If you are motivated and determined to not quit using the wii then go for it. I recommend getting Wii fit with the balance board. It will get u sweating faster than Just Dance. It'll also track your weightloss and provide positive comments on your progress. Also has some yoga moves. A really good review that I think is representative of the wii fit is IGN's video review by matt.

wii,1yfrnr,KyuubiReddit,-1,Fri Feb 21 01:30:20 2014 UTC,"I know your probably not going to want to hear it, but you should just mod your Wii put an external HD on it and Download the game and play it rather than buy it at this point. The only person whos going to see any of the money your going to overpay for is the seller of the game not Nintendo. The game really was fun not quite as fast as the NES version of punch out which is still my favorite game of all time, but it's definitely worth playing. I can pretty much say this applies to all games on the Wii at this point unless your going to DL them from Nintendo or buy it new from them or a retailer."
wii,1yfrnr,smeghammer,3,Thu Feb 20 14:44:24 2014 UTC,is it that easy to mod a Wii without any hardware modification?  Is there a specific tutorial/method you'd recommend?
wii,1yfrnr,KyuubiReddit,1 point,Thu Feb 20 15:11:39 2014 UTC,Yes it is .. Checkout wiihomebrew.org (I may not have that URL right) and click the tutorials section
wii,1yfrnr,smeghammer,1 point,Thu Feb 20 18:51:17 2014 UTC,"is it this by anychance? http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Homebrew_Channel  LetterBomb seems the way to go.  I already have an SD card with existing games on it (purchased via VirtualConsole), do you know if I can use it for LetterBomb AND if I can also use it for emulators and stuff, without formatting it and/or losing existing data?  thanks"
wii,1yfrnr,KyuubiReddit,2,Thu Feb 20 20:12:43 2014 UTC,"HBC is simply for launching apps, it doesn't install the custom firmwares required to run backup games.   Have a look through the tutorials here http://gbatemp.net/forums/wii-tutorials-faqs.235/ there's usually a recent tutorial that provides everything you need to get started.  You will probably have to format the SD card to make things easier, but if you install everything right and you get an 120gb external hard drive,  you can run every single wiiware and VC game off that with something called ""mighty channels"", have full sets of emulators on it and still have room left for the 30 or 40 wii games that you play regularly."
wii,1yfrnr,smeghammer,1 point,Thu Feb 20 21:24:26 2014 UTC,"thank you very much.   I would only run backup of wii games if they share the same saves as the regular wii disks, as I already own tons of Wii games, and only have very few left to buy.  If it works I would do it because it's more convenient.  VC is definitely what interests me the most."
wii,1yfrnr,KyuubiReddit,1 point,Fri Feb 21 09:42:15 2014 UTC,They use the same saves if they're the same region game. I dunno where you're from but PAL games make PAL saves and NTSC make NTSC. So if you had PAL backups and your previous saves were from PAL versions then the saves would be unaltered. But an NTSC version would create new saves..if that makes sense..
wii,1yfrnr,digdat0,1 point,Fri Feb 21 11:27:54 2014 UTC,"yes, it does, thanks.  but I suppose mixing PAL and NTSC games would not be a problem now.  and hopefully I can run PAL Gamecube and Wii discs on my NTSC Wii after the hack."

wii,1yfrnr,JakeOLantern,2,Fri Feb 21 13:00:40 2014 UTC,"Yeah that's the one .. I did letter bomb and then went from there, it's super easy. Just copy what ya need to the sd card and no need to format. The only time you need to format anything, if I recall, is if you want to play backed up wii games and need to create the right file system on a USB hard drive."

wii,1yax69,Turbokill,8,Wed Feb 19 02:25:24 2014 UTC,"I was never too big on Smash Bros Brawl (or the series), but that game is a staple. I was never too big on that series since I've grown up with games like Street Fighter.  Tatsunoko vs. Capcom helped fill that void for me on the Wii. If you enjoy fighters do not hesitate with that. Smash Bros is of course, fine, but go with Tatsunoko if you're like me. (So much fun, and my friend who struggled picking up Super Street Fighter II and IV picked this game right up. Fun times were had.)  Also:   Metroid Prime Trilogy (But it's expensive, Red Steel 2 isn't bad on the action either, Wii Motion Plus though.) Rhythm Heaven Fever WarioWare Smooth Moves Mario Galaxy Series Any Zelda game, really. They all (both) have merits Megaman 9 or 10 if you want to re-experience the old days of ""Nintendo hard"" Friends of mine swear by Muramasa Red Steel 2 (Again, if you can't get Metroid PT) Tales of Monkey Island Cave Story (Pretty sure the original PC version is freeware though) No More Heroes 1 and 2 Okami Resident Evil 4 House of the Dead: Overkill Silent Hill: Shattered Memories (Hailed as the best since the first two iirc) Kirby anything and Donkey Kong Country Returns    If you're into RPGs these are the most celebrated:   Monster Hunter Tri (Definitely research before buying, this game is amazing and can be worth hundreds of hours, but only if it's your style) Xenoblade Chronicles The Last Story Final Fantasy IV- The After Years"
wii,1yax69,dchrisd,2,Wed Feb 19 06:30:45 2014 UTC,"Definitely the Mario Galaxy and No More Heroes series.  Mario Galaxy is a return to fun 3d mario (wasn't really a fan of sunshine) and No More Heroes is just a silly, fun, actiony game that incorporates using the wii remote as a sword really well."

wii,1y2kcv,MisterKeeks,3,Sun Feb 16 17:25:55 2014 UTC,"Wow, this is a real coincidence, because today I hooked up my Wii to my home theater projector with a VGA cable for the first time - I was using an RCA cable, then an S-Video, and they were just a fuzzy mess.    Initial impression is that - surprise - it's really low resolution.  I almost considered going back to RCA because at least the jaggies would be rounded off.  When I flipped the Wii on and my projector announced the resolution was 640x480, I laughed - I've never seen it show anything that low.    I might be able to monkey around with the projector settings to get a less hard image, but the Wii is 2006 technology - this is probably as good as it's going to get.  Also, why hook up a Wii and Gamecube?  Or does your Wii not play Gamecube games?  Anyway, here's the cable I was using, and aside from natively having a female end (it comes with a male-male coupler), and aside from some of the prongs on the coupler being mildly bent so you had to gently move them back into the right position, it was fine:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015MISAG/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  Edit - Don't know about ebay, but at least with Amazon you'll have an easy return if you hate it."

I've posted this in other threads, but I'll post it here again because it is just easier to repost. :)  It's not hard to repair a Wii. If you can handle a screw driver and are gentle with things, you should have no problem replacing the drive.  You'll need a few tools:  a small Philips-head screwdriver (#00) Tri-wing screwdriver (Look for the ""Silverhill Triwing"" on Amazon for ~$4 -- It's a good model) a sharp edge/knife (to peel back a few stickers.) and maybe a set of tweezers  I got a replacement DVD drive for my Wii from this guy on eBay: http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=300490891251 (It was $26. Used, but it works great. No relationship with this seller. I just thought it was a good deal.)  Beware of sellers selling only the DVD drive WITHOUT the DVD controller board.  I then followed this guide on iFixit: http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Nintendo-Wii-DVD-Drive-Replacement/5164/1  My only warning with this guide is when you've removed the old drive and hooked up the new drive and you're putting the screws back in (following the guide in reverse order), don't get ahead of the guide and start putting the screws in whatever order you feel like. There are one or two screws that if put back in too early will prevent you from re-attaching the faceplate or other parts.  Other than that, it's a piece of cake. Took me about 45 minutes, start to finish. And should only cost you $35. (Far cheaper and faster than sending it to Nintendo for repair. Or buying a new one.)

wii,1xhvxf,adammostbeast,2,Mon Feb 10 05:17:07 2014 UTC,Ideal filesystem is FAT32. NTFS will work for Wii disc rips but you can't use it for Gamecube rips or NAND emulation via NEEK.  WBFS should be avoided at all costs. If you see it mentioned anywhere online just forget you even saw it.  You can use Wii Backup Manager to put games on a FAT32 or NTFS formatted drive without affecting any existing data. It will convert games and put them in the paths expected by the main USB loader.

Obviously it's an old game, and it's not a FPS, but they managed to still make the motion controls clumsy.   I don't have the manual. Can you do a 180 turn in this? RE4 is the best game in the series, so I'll give the game pad a shot."

RE4 is not an easy game by any means on your first play through. Some of the puzzles will require a strategy guide. Turn 180 and flee from enemy's, then turn 180 back around and shoot them in the knee. While they're kneeling run towards  them and perform a kick. This conserves ammo, and can push a group of zombies away. The one thing about RE4 that is not cool is you can't reload while moving. Just gotta watch your ammo consumption."

It seemed from what I saw at retailers after the holidays that outside of maybe the Skylanders/Disney Infinity stuff, the new Wii games from 2013 really weren't selling at all. Maybe one more Just Dance? I think the tapering off is pretty much complete at this point, though."

No sales means no quality games getting released going forward, it would be a waste of money for the publishers.  Unless the Wii version of Dragon Quest X ever comes out outside of Japan (it won't), Rhythm Heaven Fever and Pandora's Tower from last year are basically the last good games that will ever be released for the Wii. Anything else will be shovelware."

My advice is to hack your Wii and import the European version of Inazuma Eleven, and the Japanese version of Captain Rainbow and hope that this team finishes its English patch for it for Riivolution. I see no signs of the Utage version of Sengoku Basara 3 ever having been planned for western release.  But seriously, in terms of new software, the Wii is really, really dead here now."

I've never done it myself but seem to recall that there used to be some homebrew called 'AnyRegion' or something to do it for you. Maybe better software out now too.  You could also just look into using NEEK2O if you didn't fancy the first option. This allows you to build a 'virtual' emulated Wii on an external drive. You can boot into this and the system behaves exactly like the Wii you built. You can use the PC tool ModMii to install NEEK2O and build Wii images from the various regions. Just build a US or PAL one, say."

Devolution also lets you choose whether you want to play GC games with GC controllers or Wii Classic Controllers (or Wii U Pro Controllers, or Dual Shock 3s), which is really nice for GC games that rely on the D-pad. The tradeoff from DIOS MIOS is that Devolution requires you to insert the GC game the first time that you run it (but not when running it thereafter) to confirm that you actually own it, but that doesn't sound like a problem in your case."

wii,1wkb6k,LocalH,1 point,Thu Jan 30 18:23:47 2014 UTC,"Pretty sure you need a memory card. The Wii doesn't play the Gamecube games itself, they just managed to fit a Gamecube in there along with the Wii. You gotta use Gamecube controllers plugged into the ports and Gamecube memory cards."
wii,1wkb6k,Beamerjld,3,Thu Jan 30 16:33:23 2014 UTC,"That's not exactly true, it's not like the older PS3s that really did have chips inside for the sole purpose of PS2 support, and thus could be said to have a PS2 ""shoved inside"". The Wii is more like a ""super-Gamecube"" that runs the GC games on the very same CPU that runs the Wii games. Switching it into GC mode disables access to the extra Wii hardware, and makes the system appear to be a Gamecube to the code. Theoretically, it would be possible to run GC games in Wii mode if a homebrew coder made such a framework. In fact, there are two such projects that I know of under development.  If you're familiar with the Commodore 128 computer and it's backcompat with the C64, it's very much like that."

wii,1wijss,JosJuice,2,Thu Jan 30 21:14:16 2014 UTC,You did get a GameCube compatible Wii right? Not all Wiis are backwards compatible.
wii,1wijss,DaAmazinStaplr,4,Thu Jan 30 06:02:07 2014 UTC,"yessir i did. gamecube compatibility was a high priority for me, i did my homework to make sure i got the right machine"
wii,1wijss,bigsphinxofquartz,2,Fri Jan 31 02:33:22 2014 UTC,"Yeah, one thing to keep in mind is that with the exception only of (some of) the arcade games on Virtual Console, and a few games that allowed you to change button layout in the original game's options menu, the Wii Virtual Console provides no way of changing button assignments on controllers. For GameCube controllers on VC, this means that for SNES games, GC controller maps Y to Y, B to B, X to X, making classics like Super Mario World deeply awkward to play.  However, it's great for N64 games, moderately good for NES/TG16/MS games if you're okay with mostly relying on the analog stick for 2D games, and tolerable for Genesis. Some games with in-game-options configurable controls can actually really benefit from the GC controller, too. Secret of Mana, for example, felt great with attack mapped to A, run mapped to B, menus mapped to Y/X, and the analog stick, maybe better than the SNES controller.  And to answer your second question, yes, you need a GC memory card unless you're going to hack the Wii. Get one of the black 251(?) block ones, because the 1000-whatever block white ones have been known to fail or short out when used with the Wii. 250 blocks is plllleeeenty of space."
wii,1wijss,SkullKid100,0,Sat Feb 1 05:55:10 2014 UTC,"When you're going to download a vittual game, it lets you know which controllers are compatible. I believe you can use the wii memory since it still goes as blocks."

Rail shooters like Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles. Telltale Adventure games like Sam & Max. The Phoenix Wright games on Wiiware. Opoona.  You've probably never heard of it, but it apparently can be played with only the nunchuck. Rhythm Heaven Fever. Zack and Wiki."

For some quick fun, WarioWare: Smooth Moves I hear can be played one-handed up until the very end (which is optional anyways).   You mentioned rpg's further up; a lot of turn-based or tactical rpg's require both hands to play but have (usually) simple button layouts and menu navigation, as long as you can hit the d-pad and the A button. Fire Emblem is a series enjoying a revival of sorts thanks to Awakening on the 3ds, and has an entry on the Wii called Radiant Dawn. It's a touch rare, but I've found it for more than reasonable prices. It features character permadeath and a somewhat drawn-out tutorial (hallmarks of the Fire Emblem series), but also a long, deep medieval-fantasy story. Can be played with just the Wii remote, one-handed.  The Wii's Virtual Console is chock full of RPG's, some require a classic controller which may or may not hinder you (again, if you can straddle the d-pad and the a button with the controller in your lap, you should be good to go). Chrono Trigger is widely regarded as a masterpiece, but it is real-time, meaning you'll have to quickly navigate menus while enemies are attacking you. Phantasy Star is a series worth looking into , so is Breath of Fire. I've tried to get into the old Final Fantasy games, they're just so antiquated at this point I can't stand it. The list goes on though, SNES (and even NES) rpg's were the shit."

wii,1w30ug,LordSocky,2,Sat Jan 25 19:24:20 2014 UTC,"Smash Bros has combos, but not in the traditional sense;  it generally revolves around either attacks that can quickly link together efficiently, usually at low percentages, or pursuing your opponent after a big hit to follow up before they come out of hitstun.  Brawl has pretty much destroyed both of these situations with the floatiness of the game.    Check out Project M, it blends the best of Melee, like many of the old mechanics, with the best of Brawl, plus nerfs, buffs and even complete or partial reworks.  It's so much more fun and has way more viable characters.  The game is freaking amazing to watch at the tourney level now."
wii,1w30ug,LordSocky,2,Sat Jan 25 02:50:07 2014 UTC,What do you mean floatyness? I think you know what you mean. And I got the game so I can hack my wiiu and get project m. Is that was it is. Brawl with melee comboes and not just the single button and direction arrow attacks?
wii,1w30ug,m1ss1ontomars2k4,1 point,Sat Jan 25 04:06:13 2014 UTC,"What do you mean floatyness?   By floaty, I mean it feels like there's less gravity. You jump higher, you take longer to land, and you generally have tons of air-time. Melee, and Project M, have significantly increased gravity (I believe Project M is still a bit floatier than Melee, but I haven't played in years so I can't really confirm that) so you fall faster and have less time to plan in the air, and it also makes it far better for following up with more attacks before they can recover.    Brawl with melee comboes and not just the single button and direction arrow attacks?   Basically, yeah. The game was heavily modified to be closer to Melee, which brought back proper combos and juggling. A bunch of characters also had their moves changed (Or got entirely new extra moves, like Samus being able to swap her fire bursts for powerful ice slashes) to help perform combos.  Edit: Oh, and they're also a new mode called Turbo Mode. Basically, it plays kind of similarly to other fighting games. When you land an attack, you can instantly cancel it into any other different attack. This lets you chain multiple hits together before the opponent is knocked away, but it's very hard."
wii,1w30ug,arcturum,1 point,Sat Jan 25 11:30:10 2014 UTC,increased gravity   FTFY.
wii,1w30ug,arcturum,1 point,Sat Jan 25 19:27:10 2014 UTC,"In melee there is a trick called ""fast falling"" when you tilt down on the control stick after a jump to make your character move towards the ground faster. The result is you spend less time in the air. Brawl has this but you can't do it on a dime as easily, so characters are in the air longer hence floaty."
wii,1w30ug,LordSocky,-2,Sat Jan 25 19:25:37 2014 UTC,That match was really boring to watch.... X_X Project M is such a sham.

Personally I get enthralled watching Wizzy's Sonic, because the sheer technical skill and reaction time the dude has is incredible.  Maybe Turbo Mode would be more interesting for you, since it's incredibly fast paced and the technical skill required is insane?"
wii,1w30ug,LordSocky,0,Sat Jan 25 11:38:03 2014 UTC,"The instance of turbo mode you linked looks slower to me than melee.

I think it sounds like a problem with the console, possibly the disc drive laser has misaligned but I would expect it to say unable to read disc or give you an error code.   You could try cross posting to /r/consolerepair to see if someone over there could help. You could also contact Nintendo customer service, from what I have read about them they are really helpful. If you exhaust all you can do, send it back to the seller telling them its not working and find another one.

I'm unfamiliar with Devolution, so I'll be speaking about DM(L).  Dios Mios can only use a FAT32 partition, there is no way around this nor will there ever be due to memory limitations.  Dios Mios is used for USB drives, whereas Dios Mios Lite reads the SD card.  To the best of my knowledge you cannot install both at the same time.  Not all games are compatible, and some don't work with memory card emulation.  You need a GameCube controller, not a classic or classic pro, and thus it only works with older Wiis that stand vertically and have the two flip-open flaps on top that reveal GameCube controller and memory card ports.  Again, this will never change in DM(L) due to memory limitations, however development on something called Nintendont may replace it with a far better solution in the near future."

I'm unfamiliar with Devolution, so I'll be speaking about DM(L).   well i found that my games are full of scratches due the moving i had last summer. so on my gamecube they aren't able to play but i found that it is legal to have a backup version of your game if it is in your region. i have PAL version of Super smash bros. melee and ripped my own version of super smas bros brawl. now i want to set them up on my USB and play the games using USB loader GX (dios mios is also installed but my USB is formatted to WBFS and i got WBFS manager 4.0 so the GC games i have can be transfered to the USB)  TL;DR WBFS manager succesfull wii games but gc games didn't work"
wii,1vlbbw,LordSocky,1 point,Mon Jan 20 11:35:44 2014 UTC,"It's completely legal to back up your own games, no question there, but Devolution is hard coded so that you have to rip and verify your own disks within the program itself to prevent piracy.  It's unfortunate for those of us who no longer have functioning GC disks, but them's the breaks.  Dios Mios can only use FAT32 because the program must be small enough to fit in 96kb of memory and it's almost completely taken up already, leaving no space for drivers that support other filesystems.  There will never be WBFS partition support, nor NTFS support, possible in Dios Mios or Dios Mios Lite.  If you can't reformat your hard drive, you can replace DM with DML, and put the Gamecube games on a FAT32 SDcard instead, and that will work just fine.  WBFS partitions are outdated anyways, it's a much better decision to use individual .wbfs files instead and put them on a FAT32 or NTFS (FAT32 has far, far better support in Wii homebrew) drive.  It's also worth mentioning, you have to use a special program that comes with DM called DMToolbox.exe to convert and organize the gamecube ISOs for DM to recognize them.  He had to work with extremely tight memory requirements, so just about everything is hard coded to only work one way because offering customization would take up space that doesn't exist."
wii,1vlbbw,LordSocky,1 point,Mon Jan 20 12:19:58 2014 UTC,hey lordsocky thanks for the help so far! i hav installed Dios Mios and it works it is only black and white. i heard that i can have multiple partitions of my 64 gb usb (2 of 32GB) so i can format 1 for WBFS manager and 1 for Fat32 with a 32kb? this would work i think?  Edit: Nevermind i failed to make it work i tought i had dios mios working but it certainly didn't
wii,1vlbbw,LordSocky,1 point,Mon Jan 20 15:08:20 2014 UTC,"You can have multIple partitions, but if it's a usb stick and not a full hard drive, Windows gets really antsy about it and you'll have to force it to show both partitions, not really sure how to go about that anymore and I don't have a Windows computer handy right now to check.  I think it also tries to force you to use their exFAT on usb sticks greater than 32Gb so you'll likely need a program for that instead of the built in Windows tool.  But FAT32 & 32kb is the way to go.  I'd still recommend just using a single FAT32 partition, much easier to manage, and works with any and all homebrew if you decide to do more stuff with the Wii in the future. There should be a program for Windows that just turns .isos into much more compact .wbfs files, which act like tiny little wbfs partitions, just as regular files that anything can see."
wii,1vlbbw,mtama22,1 point,Mon Jan 20 15:42:48 2014 UTC,i have forced my usb into fat32 with 32kb i have put ssbb (NTSC_u) and Fire emblem Radiant dawn(PAL) on my usb by using Wii Backup Manager. i put Pickmin 2(NTSC_u) on my USB in the map USB:\Games\GPVE01\game.iso now here is the next issue.  i tried Fire Emblem and it works perfectly played it for 15 minutes no strange conditions.  Super smash bros has a problem with not showing the true colors of the game instead of that it puts it in a charlie chaplin movie (black and white ALIAS greyscale) perfectly playable but it isn't as much fun as i remember it. same goes for pikmin 2  is this due the fact that i play an NTSC_U version of the game on my Pal wii? if so do you know any solution for this issue?

If you're looking for a Zelda game that changes the standard Zelda ""formula"", skyward sword would indeed be the correct route to go.   Skyward Sword had a much larger emphasis on the actual environments around the dungeons, and exploration of them, rather than the dungeons themselves, and there was quite a bit more time spent doing more than just dungeoneering when compared to other games in the series"
wii,1vbkn0,ChuchuCannon,3,Thu Jan 16 02:46:34 2014 UTC,"Skyward Sword was the first Zelda game I put down in anger.

wii,1vbkn0,projectdano,6,Thu Jan 16 09:09:21 2014 UTC,"Zelda's bread and butter is pretty much what you said in your last sentence, though boring puzzles can be subjective. The big difference is how each game's gimmick/mechanics are incorporated into the puzzles and dungeons or even into the over world.  And that they start out slow, like really slow - the modern ones are all like that to accommodate for those new to Zelda  as well as new to games in general. The forest temple for example is the ""Tutorial temple.""  Twilight princess though is a slow paced Zelda game. Fastest would be Skyward Sword (subjective choice, of course). Slow/fast is relative to the Zelda franchise, so don't expect some devil may cry or ninja gaiden craziness."
wii,1vbkn0,2002120141,4,Thu Jan 16 05:09:16 2014 UTC,"I found that if I didn't have a walkthrough open on my laptop the entire game, I couldn't beat it.

I kept getting lost and then would have no idea where to go next.  Ocarina of Time was the best one. It would be awesome if they could re-release Ocarina of Time with better models, more detailed textures, and add the motion controls for WiiU. Then I'd have a reason to buy the WiiU.

wii,1vbkn0,RangerPretzel,3,Mon Jan 27 06:41:18 2014 UTC,It's valid in that it's letting you know they already released an updated version of Ocarina of Time within the current console generation and thus are unlikely to release another update quite so soon.

Then again you do get some far more interesting items than the Gale Boomerang later on.  Skyward Sword is a little bit more action focused but I imagine you'll probably have the same complaints.
wii,1vbkn0,The_Darknut_Rises,3,Thu Jan 16 14:13:06 2014 UTC,"Zelda is mostly about figuring things out on your own by exploring and doing stuff, which inherently will require you to run back and forth once you connect the pieces and say, 'Ah-ha!  I know what to do there now!'    In between doing the stuff in the 'overworld', you eventually need to progress by hitting the various dungeons, which are a mix of battle and puzzle solving.

Certainly one of the least enjoyable Zelda temples I have played.  I think TP is one of the most ""one off"" zeldas in the series.  I think skyward sword is much much better.  The Wii mechanics are better, which leads to some interesting boss/regular mob battles.  If you have a Wii U and like the lighter/cartoonish zeldas, I would say windwaker.  That game just oozes art style.  I enjoyed TP, but I would have to say it was one of the weaker ZELDA games... I think as a non branded Zelda game it would have been more well received, as it didn't have the classic Zelda formula as MUCH vs other series.  I enjoyed the wolf mechanics, but the game felt more forgettable than other Zelda series games to me.  Again, all this said, the forest temple is the least compelling imho."

BootMii is great because it enables some failsafe features should you screw up somewhere along the line, like making a NAND backup and giving you the ability to boot into a recovery menu (if you have the right type of Wii for it, needs a vulnerable boot2 to work). It doesn't overwrite anything other than a few ""IOS slots"" that aren't being used. You won't lose any saved games or Miis.  But to answer your question more specifically, YES, you can use a USB loader without using BootMii if you use a different exploit than the one that comes with the hackmii package, its just that they did such an nice job of it that most people prefer it.  Upvoted you back to zero, but you may be receiving downvotes because we try to direct modding related discussions to /r/wiihacks now I think."

The newer systems have a newer drive that does not read normal burned dvds. The ironic thing is that I paid for brawl and had to download and burn a pirated copy just to play it. The wii wouldnt read the store bought duel layered disk but it was fine with the burned dvd.

The objective of the game is to find all the buried treasure of some famous pirate and become the Pirate King or some such.

Nand = onboard Wii memory, emunand = fake onboard memory stored on USB drive (or SD card, but that sort of defeats the point).  As far as I can tell, you shouldn't need the emunand stuff unless you're planning to screw with the nand and don't want to risk bricking it, or if you're planning to install a ton of Wiiware and you don't want to use or have a suitable SD card.  As to the pack as a whole, I can't really help as I'm not really a fan of all-in-one packs and prefer to just install the bits I need myself;  I currently use Wiiflow and plan to install some emulators and a couple of handy plugins this weekend when I get some new batteries to hold me over until my charging dock gets here.  Do keep in mind that a lot of the emulators included in that don't seem to be particularly reliable or stable;  DS and PSX particularly, and I think N64 had some bugs too, not to mention emulation is taxing on the hardware and the Wii isn't exactly packing a lot of heat, though I haven't personally tested them myself.  This is just an assumption from years of using emulators on various devices and reading around.  The older systems should work great though, SNES/GBA/GEN and earlier emulators have been pretty much fully solved for years now and should be a simple case of porting them over, so you could reasonably expect them to run nearly everything.  I'd personally recommend installing the bits yourself rather than relying on a pack.  You'll get a better understanding of how it works so when something breaks, you'll have an easier time fixing it, and if he messed something up, you don't have to suffer from his mistakes.

wii,1utc49,LordSocky,0,Thu Jan 9 22:33:56 2014 UTC,"My FAT32 Partition of my USB HDD Crashed last night.  Thankfully my WBFS Partition wasn't affected.  When I was upgrading my apps, I came across this Package.    Preface: I'm a rather new Wii owner, so my understanding of everything isn't absolute; If I'm wrong, feel free to correct me.   Wii's entire directory structure is very easy to understand.  Applications go in apps and some apps have their own directory on your device root or via an ini file, you can place it else where.  (Point made for later)    Nand = onboard Wii memory, emunand = fake onboard memory stored on USB drive (or SD card, but that sort of defeats the point).    Your exactly right on Nand vs EmuNand.  I would always just followed all the tutorials and make sure that I always had a way to recover from a possible brick.   As far as I can tell, you shouldn't need the emunand stuff unless you're planning to screw with the nand and don't want to risk bricking it, or if you're planning to install a ton of Wiiware and you don't want to use or have a suitable SD card.       Nand mode in Wiiflow allows users to launch their favorite Wiiware  (Games made by Nintendo) / VC (Virtual Console) games installed on  their Nand or on an EmuNand (on SD or USB)  Since the Wii has such a tiny internal memory 512MB, install WW on  the real nand and you'll be faced by lack of nand space very soon,  copying or moving WW/VC channels to SD is always an option but again  free space issues will arise when using SDs with small capacities like  2GB or less. In order to move WW and VC to a USB HDD, you need  an Emunand. A Emunand offers the following features:          1. Store your games on SD or USB         2. Store as many as you wish as long as you have free space         3. Play out of region games         4. Use cheats         5. Play games on different Wii         6. Test themes and custom channels         7. Play GC and Triiforce games in addition to Wii games and WW/VC   I personally don't have any WiiWare or Virtual Console Apps and could skip the whole EmuNand part.   Do keep in mind that a lot of the emulators included in that don't seem to be particularly reliable or stable; DS and PSX particularly, and I think N64 had some bugs too, not to mention emulation is taxing on the hardware and the Wii isn't exactly packing a lot of heat, though I haven't personally tested them myself.

The older systems should work great though, SNES/GBA/GEN and earlier emulators have been pretty much fully solved for years now and should be a simple case of porting them over, so you could reasonably expect them to run nearly everything.   I'm right there with you; anything >= 64 Bit doesn't perform or look well.  Though, since the Emulators are already there and there is a Rom folder, I'll drop a game in and test it out.   I'd personally recommend installing the bits yourself rather than relying on a pack. You'll get a better understanding of how it works so when something breaks, you'll have an easier time fixing it, and if he messed something up, you don't have to suffer from his mistakes.

It may just be a thing of preference but I rather have someone build me a building and I'll just knock down walls and remove floors where I want to.  The amount of customization needed to have each plugin, Emulator, work with WiiFlow; let alone all of the ini files and paths.....  Please do it for me and I'll change your path to mine.  On another note, I have had success getting everything up and running loaded, have yet to try and launch a SNES Rom yet.  I'm about to try to fix my problem I'm having with the SNES Cover Art not being imported.  Either way, let me know if you want to jump in and give it a try.

For composite my Samsung requires another adapter. http://i.imgur.com/p76YyZw.jpg  Small edit: and also a different plug on the back of your TV."

Did that one came with yours?  Edit: Nevermind. This is what I'm missing. I remember seeing it when I bought the TV but apparently I've somehow misplaced it. Thanks anyway.   Edit 2: Found it. Thanks for the help guys."
wii,1undza,PhotoJim99,1 point,Wed Jan 8 17:55:25 2014 UTC,"Yes, mine came with the component adapter that you first showed and the composite from my pic. It is certain that your TV would've included one, or else had a standard composite hookup and not required the adapter. I don't know what your last pic shows, but I can't identify a composite video plug on it. My two cents, if you're now shopping around for wires, forget trying to find some dumb Samsung proprietary adapter (until you really need it), get a $5 Wii component cable off amazon, and connect it to the adapter you do own. Component is the best video Wii supports, it's a worthy upgrade.  Edited to say: new Wii mini doesn't support component, so I've read."
wii,1undza,PhotoJim99,1 point,Wed Jan 8 19:07:34 2014 UTC,Is the difference between component and composite noticeable? I've been playing around on a different TV and I don't mind the kind of outdated looks since I knew what I was buying. I knew this wasn't a PS3 or a 360. It's an original Wii. Bought it used.

wii,1ufidi,chaos9001,1 point,Sun Jan 5 02:19:34 2014 UTC,"Since wii's are fairly cheap these days, I would say you have nothing to lose by modding it.  When you mod it, you get access to tools that will let you make a backup of the NAND, as well as let you work off a virtual NAND.   With bootmii and priloader, you can backup your NAND, and change where you boot to. (Homebrew channel, post loader, ect.)  This is just one of the many reasons to mod your wii, above and beyond just playing emulators and backups."

wii,1u2yhb,bigsphinxofquartz,3,Tue Dec 31 08:45:39 2013 UTC,"I can't vouch for the copies sold online, but virtually every Best Buy that I've been to lately has scads of copies of Lost in Shadow in the ""pre-owned"" Wii section, but all of them look as though the game inside the plastic wrapper has never been touched by human hands.  Lost in Shadow was generally well-liked and had an interesting gameplay mechanic, and it's one of the very last games released by venerable developer Hudson Soft before getting subsumed into Konami last year.  Again, I can't vouch for the copies that are sold online, but I just came across 6 or 7 of them in-store, and all of them looked untouched in comparison with the other pre-owned, re-wrapped games on the same rack. I bought a copy, and upon opening it, found that it indeed was completely mint and appeared to be new. Not a mark on the disc, it felt like the disc was being taken out of the case for the first time, and the manual had clearly never been touched.  Did I experience a fluke, or is Best Buy selling a good Wii game new for $5 right now?  I haven't played it yet, but if anyone is interested in a player's thoughts, I can play a bit of it sometime over the next few days and report back."
wii,1u2yhb,nealbird,2,Tue Dec 31 09:04:33 2013 UTC,thats an extremely common practice. a few years ago i bought guitar hero world or something used and it came in all original packaging. They took off the outer box and cut the bar codes off.

wii,1u2yhb,nealbird,1 point,Wed Jan 1 16:34:36 2014 UTC,"The most sense that I can make out of it is that if they have a lot of stock of a game with an unfamiliar name and cover that's been sitting in the new racks for a while, it might make it look like an undesirable game, but if it's used, surely it's good enough to at least have between purchased by someone once?  You would think that leaving it labeled new for $5 would look like a better deal, but what do I know?"
wii,1u2yhb,C0mput3rs,2,Wed Jan 1 22:22:47 2014 UTC,its to clear out something without upsetting the publisher. New things extremely marked down looks bad compared to used things marked down.
