Roberts posted a double-double (14 points, 12 rebounds) in the opener July 10 against Sacramento.  Roberts spent the 2014-15 season with the Delaware 87ers (NBA D-League), Santa Cruz Warriors (NBA D-League) and San Miguel Beermen (Philippines Basketball Association).

Drafting Delon and Norman, and Roberts and Michale Kyser.  Granted, Roberts is one year out of school as he went undrafted last year, but even still, with the other addition of Axel Toupane(23), another undrafted player from 2014, Masai is really going after ""young veterans"" with upside to fill out the end of the roster opposed to older veterans on minimum deals.  Guys that will work hard and make for a competitive atmosphere in practice to push internal improvement.  I really like what Masai is doing."

torontoraptors,3e30nf,thefightingmongoose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:56:20 2015 UTC,I'm surprised it's a multi-year contract.  I figured it'd be one of those partially guaranteed deals for a camp invite and then to 905 if cut.  I don't imagine anything more than only the first year is guaranteed though.
torontoraptors,3e30nf,karedogino,3,Tue Jul 21 16:14:11 2015 UTC,"Just because it's multi year, does not mean even the first year is guaranteed.

torontoraptors,3e59g1,Bballers,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:40:38 2015 UTC,"I'm very excited for this season just to get the Ross question answered. I love how our lineups looking and would love to have him in it for years to come, but only if he will contribute. I think he will."
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,blake32griffin,9,Tue Jul 21 17:52:17 2015 UTC,"Ross should be gone by early 2nd part of the season if there is not a significantly improved consistency in his game. And by that I don't mean he has to drop 15pts/7 rebounds a game.  He just has to find a consistency on both ends of the floor. Too many times his defense was poor, shot selection horrible, etc. Find what you can do to benefit the team and stick to it.  Personally, I think he should be driving to the basket more with his athletic ability. Much more effective if he learns to deal with contact than to just camp on the 3pt line.  Casey is on the same boat as Ross: he has to get the team firing on all cylinders from the start otherwise Ujiri will look to replace him should we start off slow (Thibs?).  DeRozan is going no where this season unless we get a big-name player in return."
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,nemki,2,Tue Jul 21 18:25:45 2015 UTC,"I agree with Ross' poor shot selection and inattention to defence at times.  Personally, I think Casey has firmer ground to stand on. He fits the team's identity of defence first, while Ross is kind of isolated in his style of play (especially without Lou Williams now)."
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,alexredekop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:28:30 2015 UTC,"Well his past says he fits that identity, but honestly our defence was poor for that 2nd part of the season. I'm not sure if it was the injuries, lack of confidence - player's not knowing their roles...but it was way off compared to season before.  That is why I think if he was to get canned that Thibs would be a good replacement (defense oriented coach) that gets the most out of even ordinary players. We'll see how the first 2 months go..."
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,nemki,4,Tue Jul 21 19:43:17 2015 UTC,"My opinion on Ross and Derozan:  For Ross, we should wait and see how well will he play this year, last year was pretty bad because he was playing out of position and injured. Derozan's case is pretty much like that, but i think we'll sign him anyways, unless he has a pretty crappy year, if he leads our team to the 2nd round he is going to get paid whatever he wants, and 25m/year is not that bad for a top 5 SG anyways."
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,gabriel1073,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:04:36 2015 UTC,Lets keep them both. Ross and Derozan complement each other nicely. I hope Ross woes last season were due to his ankle issues. Derozan needs to pass the ball more if this new offense will succeed. Carroll was good on Atl because they passed the ball really well and he got good looks.
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,kushblazers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:18:55 2015 UTC,"I know im beating by head against a brick wall here but I have to mention this again. DeRozan is not that guy.  SG's who were ahead of DeRozan last year by RPM - the best all in one metric:  Harden, Middleton, Korver, Green, Butler, Matthews, Thompson, Dunleavy, Ginobili, Evans, Morrow, Lou Williams, Beal, Dudley, Shumpert, Roberson, C.J Miles, Reddick, Igoudala, McCollum, Anderson KCP, McLemore, J.R., Henderson, Terry, Ellington.  Thats 28 guys.  I know a bunch of them are bench guys so it's skewed, but still, he doesn't sniff top 5.   He's net negative every minute on offense. Our #'s with him and no Lowry or Lou were horrific last year.  He clogs everything, takes terrible shots, and his FT do not make up for his terrible FG% and lack of 3's.  If we sign him to a max deal, we're toast for the length of that contract."
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,thefightingmongoose,4,Tue Jul 21 18:36:29 2015 UTC,"The question is, for the Raptors, is DeRozan easily replaceable? He's a twenty point player, and, historically, the Raptors haven't had luck with attracting DeRozan like talent. So, the only way to replace him is through the draft, and I don't think Maisi wants to go through a semi rebuild.   I say if he averages twenty again, we should sign him.   EDIT: also hes a forty percent shooter, he's just not a good 3 point scorer."
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,Da_Jibblies,-4,Tue Jul 21 18:55:45 2015 UTC,"First, basketball is a zero sum game. That means when someone takes a shot, someone didn't. So if you get someone else, I'm not sure who, but a shooter type who is not a '20 point scorer' the shots get more evenly distributed and all those players who are more efficient take more shots. Maybe their efficiency goes down because usage and efficiency have an iverse relationship, but not as much.   Right on our own team we have JV whose offensive metrics are awesome. Right up there with the best post players in the league. Without DeRozan wasting 20 seconds hunting down a fallaway jumper there would be so much more room, time, and opportunities for him to operate.   Second 40% from the floor is terrible. For reference his FG% was 41.3% good for 99 out 111 qualified players last year. FG% sucks though because it doesn't factor in FT or 3s. But is TS% he's still really bad coming in a .510 good for 249th."
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,thefightingmongoose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:16:50 2015 UTC,"Right, but JV is also a terrible defender who you can't afford to have on the floor late in the game.   I'm also not sure why you think shooting forty percent is terrible. League average is thirty seven, so at the very least he's an average shooter on the floor. But you also have to factor in that he had a pretty severe groin injury which certainly affected his play and efficiency for an extended period. Add to that the Raptors were 6th in the league in true shooting %, so I really don't think Demar is negatively impacting the offense as much as you are making it seem. Not to mention he is one of the better defenders on the team as well.   Again, who do you replace him with if he leaves is the question you need to answer before you can let him walk. You answer seems to be ""anyone"". If you don't have an answer, you shouldn't let him go. JV isn't Boogie, and right now I think making him the focal point of the offense is a mistake."
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,Da_Jibblies,3,Tue Jul 21 19:46:38 2015 UTC,Me again.  Also we had good efficiency overall because Lou Williams and Jonas were very efficient and Lowry was pretty good. Most of our role players like 2Pat and Amir are also quite efficient. All the more reason for DeMar to give up the damn rock. Now think how much better all those players would look with a guy who spaces the court.
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,thefightingmongoose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:57:51 2015 UTC,"JV's offensive numbers are amazing but this is where numbers fool you.  (edit by ""you"" i mean people in general)  He doesn't have polished post moves and I think those numbers take a dip with more usage, because of the lack of an offensive arsenal.  He's got a decent hook and is active on the offensive boards, but he's far from a sure thing when you dump it to him in the post.  He doesn't have a mid range to keep defenders honest.  Enes Kanter has better post offense than him.  Still love JV though lol."
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,creepypaster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:52:14 2015 UTC,"Dude. League average is not 37% I don't think anyone shot 37% from the floor last year.  Do you mean from 3? It could be from 3, but from 3 Demar shot 28% last year 27%for his career."
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,thefightingmongoose,2,Tue Jul 21 19:55:32 2015 UTC,"Sorry, you are right, its was 44%. My mistake."
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,Da_Jibblies,4,Tue Jul 21 19:57:24 2015 UTC,"To be fair he was coming off a serious injury and definitely wasn't close to 100%. Plus a bunch of those guys are; bench players, one dimensional, inefficient or old. What you get out of Demar as a package makes him a top 10 sg at least."
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,mocha-thunder,0,Tue Jul 21 18:51:44 2015 UTC,"He actually played better after injury.  What i don't think people get is that it's not all about talent.  DeMar can do a bunch of things on the court so it's seems like he's helping. But if he's taking a shot, then somebody else isn't.   I just don;t think you can build a really good team with a player that inefficient shooting or turning the ball over on 26.7% of possessions. If you look at the other guys that high you'll notice two things.  All of them are undisputed stars who are really really efficient or they are guys who are maligned by at least half of NBA fans, and guess what, play on bad teams.  Point is if you have a guy that shoots this much he better do it well."
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,thefightingmongoose,3,Tue Jul 21 19:22:27 2015 UTC,"I agree he's not a franchise player by any means, we haven't had one since Chris Bosh.  But if you're rebuilding a team out of that list who do you take ahead of Demar? I take Harden, Thompson, Butler as a sure bet.  Middleton and Beal you can argue are better (younger dudes with better 3 point shooting) as well.  Other than that the rest of those guys are role players, and even though Demar's numbers may be inefficient, he's still way better than all of those guys."
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,creepypaster,-2,Tue Jul 21 19:22:08 2015 UTC,"'better'  I bet you a million fake dollars that if you traded DeMar to Atlanta for Korver they get worse.  Demar would score more than Korver did, but lo and behold their offence would be worse.  Is TRoss better than Rudy Gay? We know how that trade turned out. Is Kyle Singler or Luigi Datome better that Josh Smith. We know how that one turned out too.   Edit: Lists are fun how about Jameer Nelson and Rondo, or Andrea Bargnani and literally any living person."
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,thefightingmongoose,2,Tue Jul 21 19:28:28 2015 UTC,"it's contextual, which you seem to agree with.  Hard numbers here don't tell you the whole story.  Not all of those 28 guys would make the Raptors better if you replaced them with Demar.  Your arguement here works both ways."
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,creepypaster,2,Tue Jul 21 19:35:08 2015 UTC,No for sure they wouldn't but none of them makes 25 million a year.
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,thefightingmongoose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:37:57 2015 UTC,"neither does Demar.  Those reports that he's seeking max money are only just that.    Part of the problem with him and why he has such a high usage rate is because of the make up of our team.  We have no threat at the low post to anchor our offense, and we really can't play an inside-out style of game.  Teams can easily shut down Kyle and Demar because no one else can create shots for themselves.  I'd like to see how the team performs with a more balanced attack and a lower usage rate for both Demar and Kyle, but steady low post offense is hard to come by."
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,creepypaster,3,Tue Jul 21 19:46:51 2015 UTC,Next year 26 teams at least will hav over 20 million in cap space. If Demar doesn't get within a few mill of the max I'll eat my hat.   We absolutley have a low post threat. JV is pretty dominant when someone passes him the ball. One of the main reason we have no 'inside out threat is because or SG can't shoot. Most teams rely more on drive and kick to generate 3's than low post touches in todays game.
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,thefightingmongoose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:53:09 2015 UTC,"JV is nowhere near dominant as a post player.  He's got a very limited arsenal of moves and still gets pushed out of the paint way too easily.  His numbers are inflated, just as Demar's are with more usage - JV's numbers look great with limited usage."
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,creepypaster,3,Tue Jul 21 20:45:03 2015 UTC,"He was 2nd in the league in FG%. His points per post touch and points per post shot were very high. Can't find them now, but top ten.  He has a long long way to drop to even be average.  TBH, most of the good post player in the league have a limited arsenal of moves. He's 7'1"" for real. He rolls hard. Our guards don't find him. We had one of the lowest assist to basket ratios in the league. (Maybe last) and we were 22nd in assist rate.  I'm not saying he'd be Hakeem down there, but he's the only real young talent on the roster, and we clearly need more balance."
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,thefightingmongoose,2,Tue Jul 21 20:51:53 2015 UTC,"Look I have my own arguments against maxing DD but you can't seriously all those guys are better than him, right?"
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,noodlehed,3,Tue Jul 21 21:09:25 2015 UTC,"No, but saying he's top five is crazy.  Also, it's all about context.  Better is just stupid concept. Rudy Gay is better than Terrance Ross but our team was better without him.  Jameer Nelson is basically done, but Rondo was a huge downgrade.  To me the best example is D.J Augustin. Put him on a team with no offensive players a he looks good. He has the ball all the time and he puts up good numbers. But obviously a team where D.J. Augustin is your primary ball handler is never going to be good. And the reason he isn't a starter in the league is because if you put him on a team where he doesn't have the ball in his hand constantly the fact that he sucks at every single other part of the game is pretty evident.  Basketball is a team game. Just because someone can score a lot of points does not mean he is a helping the offence."
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,thefightingmongoose,0,Tue Jul 21 21:42:50 2015 UTC,Derozen isn't a top 5 SG. He was tied for 48th last year among SG's for TS%. He gets to the rim well but he doesn't shoot well at all for his position.
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,seaoflizards,4,Tue Jul 21 22:07:33 2015 UTC,"There's a year left in Casey's contract. I think Masai's mindset is: if nobody is available (who is clearly better) then f it. I'll give him another shot. Cause tbf to him our team last year couldn't guard a college squad and hold them under 100.  As for our wings we'll probably resign Ross sometime in October unless he wants to test himself this season, like Jimmy B. Hes still a valuable piece IMO and we can't just let him walk.  DD is a UFA and if the rumours of him wanting 25/year are true then we let him walk if another team offers that. Unless DD goes nuts this year and carries us to theECF then we give him his max"
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,thehumantorch0,0,Tue Jul 21 17:58:28 2015 UTC,you guys dont think hes worth that much considering hes the franchise player?
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,thefightingmongoose,6,Tue Jul 21 18:01:12 2015 UTC,"Haha... oh man.  You might get some agreement here, but DeRozan is no franchise player.  He scores points. Badly. Plays pretty good D, and does pretty much nothing else. He's a net negative on O by RPM because he's such a high usage player. His FTA don't make up for the fact that he never shoots 3's. DeRozan is much more like Corey Magette than he is like Dwayne Wade.  Lowry is out best player by far. I guess he's not a 'franchise player either' but he is the guy who makes it all go.  Also JV is really damn good on offense but we basically never use him becasue our guards shot about 9843759847953 times a game.  EDIT: Okay, I know, I know you guys all love DeRozan. He scores dem buckets. I once seen dat game where he scored lik 40 pts. But seriously guys, i'm not making this stuff up. Look at some numbers besides points per game. Look at his similarity scores on basketball reference. Names like Wes Person, Kendall Gill, Ray Felton (I'm sure because of the FG% not the ast), and O.J. Mayo. He's and inefficient scorer that happens to have a really big role."
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,seaoflizards,4,Tue Jul 21 18:29:13 2015 UTC,Too much real in this post. Derozen is really talented but his strength is the long 2 and that's what makes him so inefficient. He isn't a great shooter to begin with yet he takes 10 contested long 2's a game and usually makes 3. A healthy Kyle Lowry is far more important to this team than Derozen IMO.
torontoraptors,3e3hr4,thefightingmongoose,3,Tue Jul 21 21:58:51 2015 UTC,theres high talk about JV and the hate Casey gets for underutilizing him. Why not run pick and rolls with him?

torontoraptors,3e3c0b,yiga,2,Tue Jul 21 17:13:19 2015 UTC,I live in Van my only guess is that some players are getting rehab and training at the Burnaby Facility. I know last summer before the pre season game Casey said it was one of the best gym facilities he has ever been to in the world. It's so beautiful in Van right now who wouldn't want to come here for a few days and train?

torontoraptors,3e0hy2,CrucialXP,8,Tue Jul 21 01:05:38 2015 UTC,"thats not gonna happen.  he will be a career energy guy off the bench but honestly if he gets solid minutes thats unbelievable.  the fact he made it considering what people thought about him going into the draft is incredible on its own.  I actually remember watching him in at baylor and he basically lived under the basket at like 6'7, so its understadable why people werent sure if his game would translate to the NBA but he has definetly suprised alot of people.

torontoraptors,3e1ndk,Sebkins,3,Tue Jul 21 11:31:30 2015 UTC,"I'd say he's a bit over rated by us. We all dig his energy and hustle and demeanour, but since we like him so much, I think a lot of fans, over estimate what he can do on the floor - and quite honestly, I think JJ does that on his own as well.   He tends to over-help, which can be problematic when he's guarding 3s that can shoot the 3, or stretch 4s, and he leaves his man giving a wide open look to them.   and on offense, I think there are times when he tries to do too much on his own, and gets in these zones where he drives to the basket. When he's on, he's scoring and it's great, but when he's not... he continues to do it and it's like watching a bull in a china shop.   Further, since he can't shoot the 3, his man can sag way off when Raps are on offense... that can cause spacing issues for our drive and kick game."

torontoraptors,3e1ndk,TreChomes,0,Tue Jul 21 17:52:50 2015 UTC,His ability to take it to the basket is uncanny and his finishing ability around the rim is nearly unstoppable. He is extremely efficient and if he is in the zone almost unguardable. I think he should have CONSISTANT minutes off the bench and he could help this team develop into a contender in the east.  Also I think Casey is boneheaded and should definitely have been fired after the last two playoff performances.

From what I understand, partially guaranteed deals get you about $25-$50k and an invite to training camp.  If you're cut, you can go down to the team's D League team as an ""affiliate player"" (3 per team).  Salaries down there are only $25-$50k too, I think so getting a partially guaranteed deal is a nice little salary bump and a job at the D League the next season.  Along with Michale Kyser, we've also signed Ronald Roberts and Axel Toupane to similar deals this summer."

No way they wear the old uniforms there... right?  If not, most likely some SSH event...  Another likely reveal date would be during OVOFEST in early August. Have Drake wear it while performing ala JayZ."

torontoraptors,3dx5uk,king_lloyd11,2,Tue Jul 21 03:40:14 2015 UTC,Let's hope it's soon. It's gotta be soon. I'm excited. Praying and hoping it's at least half decent. And wouldn't be surprised if Drake did something like that.. He's usually following Jay Z in most things.

torontoraptors,3dueh9,creepypaster,2,Sun Jul 19 21:13:45 2015 UTC,This is just like after the wizards playoffs series where Casey says JJ is one of his best players but played him for about 2 mins the whole series. Casey loves giving Raptors fans blue balls!!
torontoraptors,3dueh9,kushblazers,23,Mon Jul 20 04:17:24 2015 UTC,Well just as long as keep benching him for the remainder of the game when he has 10 rebounds and 16 points at the half.
torontoraptors,3dueh9,King-Bruce,37,Sun Jul 19 19:31:39 2015 UTC,You don't have to participate in shit. Just win the games however you need to and for this team that probably means playing JV. Stop letting the other team dictate the fucking game and force our guys on them

We've never had a legit C this decade and now we have a young one that the coach just gives up on? I don't get it, how is JV supposed to improve?"
torontoraptors,3dueh9,nnDMT420,3,Sun Jul 19 16:51:45 2015 UTC,I don't have a problem with the pump fakes as much as the lack of a threatening mid ranged jumper to complement them.

And he usually does it like twice or thrice in a row like as if the first attempt didn't work then the second or third might.   If he had a mid range jumper like DD the. Those fakes will be deadly.

torontoraptors,3dueh9,Ramsesthesecond,2,Sun Jul 19 22:45:15 2015 UTC,Here's a novel idea then:  Give him the ball in the low post instead of in a face up 12-14 feet from the basket.  Then we don't have to worry about the pointless ball fakes.
torontoraptors,3dueh9,EricArthurBlair,12,Sun Jul 19 23:00:41 2015 UTC,"This is from the Q & A with Casey posted in the sub a few days ago, in its context it honestly doesn't sound as bad.  Edit: on mobile here's the Link"

torontoraptors,3dueh9,Ball4Life,3,Sun Jul 19 17:35:02 2015 UTC,"which sucks because casey just wants to keep his job, so giving younger players minutes is not his priority."
torontoraptors,3dueh9,Simorebut,6,Sun Jul 19 18:12:32 2015 UTC,I know. I wish player development was a bigger priority.. we are going to lose Val in free agency.

torontoraptors,3dueh9,thehumantorch0,3,Sun Jul 19 21:44:26 2015 UTC,who the hell will play center then?  or does he seriously think of going 5 small
torontoraptors,3dueh9,dfsaqwe,3,Sun Jul 19 23:17:58 2015 UTC,"Regardless of whether this is Casey's opinion or whether it's right or wrong, the fact that he comes out and says it in the media shows his lack of intelligence and shitty coaching ability. The last thing you want to do is fuck with your players heads and lose their respect. Turns into a cancer in the dressing room.

torontoraptors,3dueh9,talentpun,14,Mon Jul 20 04:37:27 2015 UTC,Andrew Bogut played 3 minutes total in the final 3 games of the finals.  The league is changing.
torontoraptors,3dueh9,_bigcity,28,Sun Jul 19 17:23:45 2015 UTC,Easy to say when you have 2 of the best shooters in the league and a bunch of role players that played out of their minds
torontoraptors,3dueh9,deadskin,12,Sun Jul 19 17:43:53 2015 UTC,"That wouldn't happen if Cleveland could put a competent big man on the floor. There's more to it than just ""the league is different now""."
torontoraptors,3dueh9,JoeFlacco05,4,Sun Jul 19 18:31:09 2015 UTC,"exactly, Cleveland was easy to go small ball against because they don't have a dominant big man, or even a scoring minded big man.  You can get away with playing Barnes and Green vs Mosgov and Thompson because those guys can't create offense for themselves.    Warriors still played their bigs vs. Dwigth Howard and the Brow.  Small ball is a trend but it's not like small ball teams are doling those line ups for extended amounts of time.  They're not even starting games with them, except for the finals vs. Lebron."
torontoraptors,3dueh9,creepypaster,2,Sun Jul 19 19:23:31 2015 UTC,And he started in the rest of the series in the playoffs averaging 25 minutes per game. One series doesn't change the entire league.

I think we need to have JV in the game as much as possible as he is our most skilled big man and then space the floor with shooters. We do not have the right players to follow what the GSW are doing."

torontoraptors,3dueh9,dangerzone117,4,Sun Jul 19 16:54:05 2015 UTC,Let the flow of the game dictate who finishes. Why does Casey need to have a strict plan in place. Let the game unravel itself and play the hot hand. If Jonas is playing well then leave him in...
torontoraptors,3dueh9,Life_Of_High,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:51:36 2015 UTC,"Jonas needs to play better in order to earn the crunch time minutes, they are simply saying they will not give him the minutes by default.

Frankly, at this point and in the current league he is un-skilled and the biggest thing is (as was already said) he gets tired and turn-over prone late in games.  And this isn't news Casey has never played JV big minutes late in games, which I agree with.  Of course the coach wants to keep his job and he's going to employee any strategy that might aid him to keep it."

torontoraptors,3dueh9,PurpleZeppelin,-5,Sun Jul 19 19:10:20 2015 UTC,"I personally think we should all give Casey a break. What he said was completely logical. What's with everyone jumping on the JV bandwagon anyway? The guy hasn't proven himself, and while he is deserving of minutes late in games, the direction in which the NBA is moving makes players like JV a liability. I understand the mentality that we should force other teams to match us but JV really isn't as dominant as everyone seems to think. However if he developed some kind of midrange face-up game it would be a different story."
torontoraptors,3dueh9,queryquest,4,Sun Jul 19 17:12:10 2015 UTC,"He's actually working specifically on his face up game this summer... Which is why I don't want Casey automatically defaulting to the same practice he did this season past. Growth is experience, training is preparation, but all the preparation with no experience will continue to stunt his development process even further."

I know sports illustrated projected them to finish 14th, but I don't see why they can't realistically finish 7th with a healthy Melo and RoLo.  Porzingis could also be the steal of the draft, for all his flaws he's still a 7 footer who can drain 3s and block shots.  They're not world beaters in any way, but I don't think NYK will do as poorly as many suspect."

torontoraptors,3dwu6q,mocha-thunder,10,Mon Jul 20 05:05:11 2015 UTC,"Scola produced more than Amir last year in 8 less minutes per game. He's also an iron man who's a legit post option, money from mid range and held his opponents to 12 PER (better than Amir and Pat).  He was 12th in the league in charges taken.  I think people will be surprised at how much impact he has on our team, on the court and off. He's the veteran presence we've needed for awhile now and should be a great mentor for JV. If Jonas can pick up just a small amount of post moves from Scola his offensive game will take off.  JJ should also see more minutes at the 4 this year, he'll be very effective there. Suits him better than playing on the perimeter.   We have PF by committee now, but we have 3-4 guys who can play the spot and all add something different."

B) Biyombo is a Casey guy (defense first), and can sort of cover for JV.  If you recall, JV was learning how to play more like a PF and stretch the floor. One thing I'm a little worried about is JV's passing and if he'd learned enough from Amir/will learn from Scola about making the right reads. But...  I think we'll see them both on the court when facing some bigger frontcourts (Chicago, Memphis, etc)"

Or James Johnson/PPat somehow step up big this year. I think JJ should be given the chance."
torontoraptors,3dwu6q,nhui06,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:18:47 2015 UTC,"I'd keep my eye on Luc Mbah - for some reason his contract was voided with the Kings due to a failed physical, but he is a solid PF who can play D, not to mention the African connection with Masai (basketball without borders).  Apparently his contract was 1 year 1.5 mil with the Kings - Raptors can afford that provided he does pass the physical with us."
torontoraptors,3dwu6q,RetartedMooseGas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:13:48 2015 UTC,"Patterson was a better defender than Amir last year. He is an amazing hedger in the PnR. Rarely, if ever, makes a mistake. Rotates better than anyone on the roster. Patterson is in no way an objectively worse player than Amir. They specialize in different things and complimented one another well, but I wouldn't go as far as to say one is certifiably worse than the other on a day-to-day basis. Also, Hayes is gone. Our PF rotation will probably look something like this: Patterson/JJ/Scola/Demarre Patterson will probably also get the 5 spot in some lineups with JJ/Demarre at the 4."

torontoraptors,3drchp,JustLooking4now,-4,Sat Jul 18 21:31:58 2015 UTC,I was for trading DD earlier in the summer but after some thinking I want to keep him. He already has that playoff hunger in his eyes and its only Drew League. It looks like he added 5-8 lbs of muscle this summer. I hope he becomes a better passer we really need that from him. Our team is going to be pretty nasty defensively. DD can guard most 2s in the league. I hope JV can mesh with our starting 4 and better recognition on D. Can the season start already?

torontoraptors,3drchp,Togonnagetsomerando,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:01:11 2015 UTC,biggest problem with DD is when someone else starts taking the most shots. He starts throwing up shots when ever he gets the chance. That's why in 2013 he went off after Gay trade as DD got the shots he wanted so there was no need to throw up any
torontoraptors,3dufon,iamwearingashirt,6,Sun Jul 19 16:11:50 2015 UTC,"soccer chants work b/c there's a game like once a week...and there are defined supporters sections...so it's roughly the same group of people in the same section for each game....so season seat holders have a chance to practice/perform chants b/c they get to go to almost all the games, are organized, and are in the same section.  whereas in the nba, there are more games per week, the season seat holders are snobby rich asshats, and people like me who would be down for chants have to buy per-game tickets so i'm not always in the same section everytime i go to a game.  also, there's a dj that plays music throughout the game...  as much as i would LOVE chants to happen in the nba, i dont think it's going to happen...unless MLSE allows for a supporters section."

torontoraptors,3drhrk,DaveyBaby27,24,Sat Jul 18 19:23:22 2015 UTC,"So you're planning on the Raptors getting 0 boards, right?"
torontoraptors,3drhrk,kashman23,-11,Sat Jul 18 19:44:27 2015 UTC,Who would you have rebound for us? You know JV gets no run at the end of games. You want Biyombo out there in the dying minutes? Plus Carroll is a great rebounder for his position. Have you seen an NBA game in the last two seasons? Small ball to close out games is the way things happen now.
torontoraptors,3drhrk,TheDarkLight,15,Sat Jul 18 19:47:31 2015 UTC,"Small ball to close out games is the way things happen now   lol you don't shoehorn your players into a scheme just because 'it's the way things happen now'. You do it because you have the right personnel for it, which this lineup is clearly not cut out for."
torontoraptors,3drhrk,RetartedMooseGas,6,Sat Jul 18 20:06:50 2015 UTC,What about this lineup is wrong for going small ball in  your opinion
torontoraptors,3drhrk,TheDarkLight,8,Sat Jul 18 20:15:39 2015 UTC,For starters there are very few teams in the league that can successfully compete at a high level going small and force other teams to adjust. Carroll being a decent rebounder at the SF position doesn't mean he can bang with big men inside and grab boards. Even if you're going small you need someone at the 4/5 that can actually be physical inside like Dray.
torontoraptors,3drhrk,RetartedMooseGas,3,Sat Jul 18 20:48:25 2015 UTC,"That's not a starting lineup. That's a 5-10 minute MAX in a game lineup. Not a most used lineup but an efficient one. Teams don't platoon swap, when they don't have a big starter in sometime during the 4th, you put this lineup in and run up the score."
torontoraptors,3drhrk,TheDarkLight,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:51:31 2015 UTC,This thread is about this lineup closing out games. In any case what about this lineup is efficient? And what makes you think it can run up the score?
torontoraptors,3drhrk,RetartedMooseGas,5,Sat Jul 18 21:01:30 2015 UTC,"Because there is shooting/playmaking at every position. You can run a PnR with almost every combination of players. On defense (when Lowry is healthy) these are all above average defenders. 1-4 can switch. 3-5 can switch. Yeah, this is a pretty deadly lineup for 5 minutes a game."
torontoraptors,3drhrk,TheDarkLight,3,Sat Jul 18 21:06:39 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I can see this being used sparingly but definitely not to close out games like OP is suggesting."
torontoraptors,3drhrk,RetartedMooseGas,6,Sat Jul 18 21:19:54 2015 UTC,"I disagree, which is okay"
torontoraptors,3drhrk,anothergimmick,3,Sat Jul 18 21:20:23 2015 UTC,And the Warriors got raped on the offensive boards. They only overcame that by having not only two of the best shooters in the game but playmakers and virtually every position. They were playing Dray at the 5! Raptors do not have the personnel to play small ball for an extended amount of time.
torontoraptors,3drhrk,RetartedMooseGas,3,Sat Jul 18 20:40:36 2015 UTC,"Why does everyone feel like the Dubs were the only team to have success with going small at certain points? Playing small is always going to be about where you land on the scale. Does the increase in space for spread PnR's as well as being able to switch outweigh the pounding on the boards? Thats a question specific to every team and you can't predict it without giving your lineup run against different squads. Again, it's not an every-game, most used lineup type of thing."
torontoraptors,3drhrk,kushblazers,2,Sat Jul 18 21:13:26 2015 UTC,Please tell me who on the raps can shoot as good as curry and thompson? WE ARE NOT THE WARRIORS!!! They creamed us when we attempted to go small against them at their home last season.
torontoraptors,3drhrk,RetartedMooseGas,2,Sat Jul 18 22:56:43 2015 UTC,Your reply indicates that You either didn't read everything I said or didn't understand everything I said.
torontoraptors,3drhrk,kushblazers,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:02:45 2015 UTC,Hahaha sorry read it wrong its 4:20 pm on the west coast. But still that lineup will not get us boards. Seriously lacking in size. I would rather put JJ at the 4 if you were going to run that lineup.
torontoraptors,3drhrk,RetartedMooseGas,2,Sat Jul 18 23:06:40 2015 UTC,You can't know they would get dominated on the boards until they play. It's too difficult to predict. I'm sure we will give run to this lineup with JJ instead of DC as well. It's not a one or the other thing
torontoraptors,3drhrk,kushblazers,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:09:08 2015 UTC,"Well in order to get to the finals we would have to beat the bulls or cavs. These are the cavs bigs Anderson V., Kevin Love, TT(restricted), Mozgov, LBJ(he can play the 4 we all know this). Bulls bigs Taj Gibson, Gasol, Noah, Nazr M., Nikola Mirotic. I doubt these teams will go small ball during the playoffs with their quality bigs. The only reason Blatt went small in the finals vs warriors was because he didnt have Anderson Varejao and Love. So tell me you still want to go small when Noah and Gasol are playing??"
torontoraptors,3drhrk,kushblazers,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:23:02 2015 UTC,Agreed cavs sans kyrie and love really hurt them. Warriors barely escaped the cavs sans 2 all stars. It looks tempting on paper but probably not in reality. You think that lineup works against the bucks? And Bucks are projected by SI to be the 9th seed. You tripping bro.
torontoraptors,3drhrk,TheDarkLight,-1,Sat Jul 18 22:54:45 2015 UTC,Im not saying that you do. Im just saying that when another team goes with small ball it forces you to do that as well. And obviously masai agrees with me because he was even considering going with Carroll as our full time starting PF when he was pursuing wes matthews.
torontoraptors,3drhrk,king_lloyd11,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:49:15 2015 UTC,Very few teams have the ability to go small and actually compete so I doubt we'll be seeing small ball often enough at the end of games that we see your proposed lineup make many appearances. And playing Carroll at the 4 would have at least made some sense if we landed Matthews but we didn't
torontoraptors,3drhrk,king_lloyd11,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:56:40 2015 UTC,"When most teams go small, they have at least 1 guy out there who can rebound well, usually an agile big."

torontoraptors,3drhrk,Duuhh_LightSwitch,2,Sat Jul 18 21:53:59 2015 UTC,"Thats fair, although defensively this lineup is better on D than most of the ones we rolled out last season when GV and lou will were on the court for extended periods of time, and on the offensive end this is a really difficult lineup to contain. Try picturing the spacing and flooring these guys can create. While ill admit that some are undersized, as long as the other team doesnt have a center in all of these guys can do pretty good jobs of containing their man."
torontoraptors,3drhrk,Ball4Life,3,Sat Jul 18 22:04:51 2015 UTC,JV needs to play in these situations if the Raptors want to be successful in the long run.

torontoraptors,3dorh0,avericks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:46:45 2015 UTC,"I recommend it. Try to find some decently priced tickets. The original value for the cheapest seats is 25 so hopefully you can find some on Craigslist that aren't too marked up.   I watched canada women's cuz canada men's was sold out (on ticketmaster) last time I checked.   The skill level varies immensely between countries. Canada is pretty good and USA was even better, they were at the skill level I'm used to seeing on TV. They were in separate matches so I don't know how they would be against each other. The womens teams for Argentina, Venezuela and Dominican Republic were no match and were behind their rival teams (Canada and US) by a huge margin, like 40-15 in the 2nd quarter.   Included in the ticket is 2 games, just check the schedule online. I can guarantee any game with Canada will be exciting and the crowd will be great. The venue is awesome and legendary (Maple Leaf Gardens) and most seats are quite close with great views.   Another bonus tip is that for the second game, if many people leave, you can move to the best seats if they are empty."

Bad court vision. He gets beat a lot of defnse b/c he has slow feet and relies on his wingspan -  which will get him into foul trouble so fast and mess up the defensive rotations."
torontoraptors,3dps7a,HomelessBurrito,9,Sat Jul 18 13:35:54 2015 UTC,"The 0 assists is concerning. I know his responsibility isn't to create for other players, but passing is an integral part of the game and it's actually harder not to get an assist in my opinion than to get one or two. It shows he still isn't seeing the court like he should."
torontoraptors,3dps7a,BurningOculus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:23:35 2015 UTC,"He got virtually no experience playing real basketball this last year. You can practice shooting, practice man to man defense, practice rotations, but you can't practice reading your teammates movements and the defense and making the right pass too much without playing actual games. He's not a natural passer, but this is far from his ceiling."
torontoraptors,3dps7a,ohgosh_thejosh,8,Mon Jul 20 16:54:43 2015 UTC,I've never seen someone score so easily but look so bad positionally. Also people think he's easy to beat on the dribble but he's so long they have trouble scoring in the end.   Edit: He looked more raw than thought he would
torontoraptors,3dps7a,HockeySwag,9,Sat Jul 18 08:31:50 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, he isn't good at all. Below average if anything.   People need to stop praising him.  There's people with real talent out there."
torontoraptors,3dps7a,passiveparrot,3,Sat Jul 18 15:16:05 2015 UTC,"he's turning 20 and unlike college kids, hasn't played basketball nearly as long or as often.  Talent = hard work, what he does have is a freak physical body that's ideal for thee sport.  Give him to develop and learn the game."
torontoraptors,3dps7a,creepypaster,2,Sat Jul 18 21:56:08 2015 UTC,he's one year away from being two years away
torontoraptors,3dps7a,fkndead,6,Sun Jul 19 01:17:15 2015 UTC,Let's see how he handles the d league
torontoraptors,3dps7a,shiny_dittos,2,Sat Jul 18 07:12:57 2015 UTC,"He just doesn't know the game.  His time with the 905ers this year will probably tell us all we need to know by April.  If he gets it, on his way, if not, could be a let down."
torontoraptors,3dps7a,locdogjr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:56:03 2015 UTC,"Still very much a catch and shoot type of player. Hopefully he works on his playmaking abilities in the D-League. On a positive note, he's bulked up, and his rebounding and defensive intensity seem to have improved."
torontoraptors,3dps7a,ZachK92,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:35:31 2015 UTC,"Bruno is a good kid but I really don't ever see him becoming a rotation guy in the NBA. He has poor feel for the game and outside of his shot, has almost no ball skills to speak of.  I know he's young, but certain things you can't teach or learn. He won't suddenly become more coordinated or get quicker feet, those things are pretty much you have it or you don't.  Masai was enamored with Giannis the year before and took Bruno because he saw similar physical tools. Problem is, Giannis is an elite athlete with the ability to handle the ball at a high level. He had that ability at 18-19. He had instincts without the ball, Bruno doesn't.  Hood or KJ would have been much better picks, youth is overrated."
torontoraptors,3dps7a,JWiLL552,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:27:36 2015 UTC,"Seems pretty on par for a kid who didn't grow up playing basketball, and has very little competitive experience.  Not sure what people are expecting here, it's gonna take a while for him to learn the nuances of the game."

torontoraptors,3dpepi,Togonnagetsomerando,7,Sat Jul 18 14:57:27 2015 UTC,"Cool article.  I am glad we took a chance on a young player with upside.  All this kid needs is minutes.  If he gets it and becomes a baller, great! if he doesn't? Well, it was a cool experiment and we all enjoyed the process more than drafting a dude who was a 10th man and averaged 5 pts a game for a few years before leaving/being traded.  The Bruno ride is fun, he is OUR dude, we all love him and support him. With the 905ers this year, it'll be very fun to see how he develops, I know I'll be watching periodically on youtube just to see if he can turn into a baller.  He has the body, the shot is getting there, but he just doesn't have the basketball acumen yet.  If he was going into his sophmore season at Uni, it  wouldn't be a big deal so he has time.    Hopefully by year 4 we have an idea what he will be and if we need to resign him or call it a failed experiment.  Either way, this is more fun than some random SF from a NCAA school who is just ok."
torontoraptors,3dpepi,locdogjr,6,Sat Jul 18 15:54:50 2015 UTC,"At this point, it looks like Capela was a stronger choice. Backup PF who might fit well with Jonas and looked very good for the Rockets in the playoffs in short stints."
torontoraptors,3dpepi,DrLyleEvans,2,Sat Jul 18 07:49:34 2015 UTC,Bruno/Drizzy mixtape confirmed
torontoraptors,3dpepi,shanghaisneeze,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:14:57 2015 UTC,"I hope Bruno pans out, but I don't think NBA is structured to successfully facilitate such long term projects. In soccer, you see European teams signing like 14 year old kids in hopes of developing them and eventually getting them on the first team. Bruno is not 14 years old but he is extremely raw. Even assuming that he ever develops into a full-fledged NBA-calibre player, I don't see that happening anytime soon. His rookie-contract will probably expire by then and any other team in the league would be free to reap the benefits of our labour. In the world of basketball, the NBA is not the place to develop such raw talent. You either do it at those basketball specific prep-schools in North America or within the development academies of European clubs.  On the flip side, my hope is that the new D-League team really accelerates his developmental process. His progress this upcoming season will be absolutely crucial."
torontoraptors,3dpepi,AndronicusYYZ,-7,Sun Jul 19 03:41:48 2015 UTC,"good read. he's basically fighting Ross, Johnson and Fields for minutes off the bench at this point. thats a nice step from year one."
torontoraptors,3dpepi,youretellingme,13,Sat Jul 18 05:13:49 2015 UTC,"Is this 2014? We don't have Fields any more, and Carroll is our starting small forward."
torontoraptors,3dpepi,benhan23,7,Sat Jul 18 06:14:12 2015 UTC,"To be honest, Bruno should just stick in the D League. There is not enough minutes for him to mature on the NBA team especially if we are looking to contend. I don't think there is any point in rushing it when he is only 19 years old."
torontoraptors,3dpepi,TangoMyMango,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:14:31 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, and apparently so does management/ownership based on their acquisition of our own D-League team. The guy is as raw as they get, having little experience playing the game of basketball, let alone organized high-level basketball. There are probably AAU players that have more experience than he does. He needs a lot of time and a lot of reps before he's ready to contribute on the big stage."
torontoraptors,3dpepi,benhan23,-1,Sat Jul 18 07:27:28 2015 UTC,"my mistake, for some reason Fields is still listen on the roster on the NBA web sight. I Know Carroll is starting, I mean't Brunos fighting with other players off the bench for bench minutes. on the wings who's in front of bruno on the bench rotation?"
torontoraptors,3dpepi,youretellingme,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:21:30 2015 UTC,Not at all. He's going to be given a lot of minutes... in the D League. He won't be challenging anyone on the Raptors for meaningful minutes at this stage. He's still too raw.

That corner possession comes to mind, a little pressure and he coughed it up.    Hope he works on these things in the development league."
torontoraptors,3dp2ne,no1ninja,0,Sat Jul 18 04:22:13 2015 UTC,He is a year away from being two years away from being an bench player.

That said, he is still not NBA ready, but he is incredibly young... 19 years old.  Norman Powell for instance is 22, 3 years older.

torontoraptors,3dm4vh,synackSA,-4,Fri Jul 17 12:26:12 2015 UTC,good riddance. Not a good basketball player.
torontoraptors,3dqwn6,Omnivirus,16,Sat Jul 18 16:20:15 2015 UTC,Likely a top 10 pick. You have to remember Denver has the right to swap with NY and it's unlikely they both finish bottom 5. So I wouldn't go as far as to say probably a top 5 but there is a small chance it happens.
torontoraptors,3dqwn6,TheGursh,2,Sat Jul 18 16:27:07 2015 UTC,"Even if it falls to 10~14, it'll still be a nice pick to have especially since we got it for Bargs who left the Knicks in free agency."
torontoraptors,3dqwn6,Thimble,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:57:45 2015 UTC,Very nice piece to have! Even if it's traded the Raps are getting a good player
torontoraptors,3dqwn6,TheGursh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:05:16 2015 UTC,"There's not much indicating to me that either of those teams won't be competing with the Kings, Lakers, and Sixers for worst in the league."
torontoraptors,3dqwn6,creepypaster,10,Sat Jul 18 16:30:12 2015 UTC,"NY is a lot better than they were last season.  Aflalo and Robin Lopez are quality starters to play with Melo.    PG - Jose, Galloway  SG - Afflalo, ??  SF - Melo, Lance Thomas, C. Early  PF -  Derick Williams, Kristaps  C - R. Lopez, K. O'Quinn  As long as Melo stays healthy they have a chance to be a 7-8 seed imo.  Hope I'm wrong, but they won't be throwing out D League line ups like last year if Melo's healthy."
torontoraptors,3dqwn6,TheGursh,4,Sat Jul 18 16:39:34 2015 UTC,"Melo is the only true starter from that group. The rest would be best off the bench as a 6th-8th man on a good team. I can't see them competing for a playoff spot at all. I have ATL, CLE, TOR, BOS, CHI, WAS, MIA and MIL easily ahead of them. IMO they're going to be duking it out with ORL, BRK, CHA, IND, PHI and DET for the bottom of the East."
torontoraptors,3dqwn6,creepypaster,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:59:15 2015 UTC,"out of the 8 teams you listed, I think Boston will be the odd man out.  Rolo and Aflalo are quality starters (and have been for the past few seasons), they're not stars but they compliment Melo's game and most importantly, bring a veteran presence and stability to the starting line up.  They have some huge holes still, but a super star with the right role players is enough to compete in the east.  I really see NY, IND, DET, BOS, and ORL as all capable of competing for the 8th spot, hovering around .500.  They've all improved tin the offseason and you can make a case for why each one will have their chance.  The East will not be the same shit show as it was last year, it will still be worse than the west, but it will be more competitive too - even our own division has more competition than last year."
torontoraptors,3dqwn6,therealbgreen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:06:43 2015 UTC,"NY has absolutely no chance in making the playoffs next year. Their ONLY scoring option in their starting 5 is Melo. Afflalo as your second leading scorer wont get you far (cough Denver).   Boston finished the season hot, and even continued to play great in the playoffs even if they did end up losing. Theyre miles ahead of NY.   I was shocked Melo signed his extension. NY wont be relevant for 3 years. I believe the bulls would have made the Finals with Melo."
torontoraptors,3dqwn6,TheGursh,2,Sat Jul 18 23:14:53 2015 UTC,I think the NYK will finish somewhere around 5 (Melo is coming back and they added Prozingis) but could finish higher. I don't think the Nuggets got any worse and see them finishing in the 5 - 10 range (which is likely where the Raps will be picking for them) next season.
torontoraptors,3dqwn6,RileyCola,3,Sat Jul 18 16:36:56 2015 UTC,Lmao I thought you meant top 5 for a second there
torontoraptors,3dqwn6,JoeFlacco05,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:49:05 2015 UTC,I don't think the Lakers will be bottom 5 next year.
torontoraptors,3dqwn6,Dammit81,8,Sun Jul 19 00:12:58 2015 UTC,"Knicks are not going to be a bottom five team next year.  They've made some decent additions this off-season and I'm sure Carmelo will be healthier.  Besides, they have absolutely no reason to tank this year since they have no pick so they won't be packing it in early like last season.  I see the Knicks challenging for a playoff spot in the east but ultimately falling short.  I'm thinking we get a mid to late lottery pick between 7-14."
torontoraptors,3dqwn6,creepypaster,6,Sat Jul 18 16:31:10 2015 UTC,yep 8 - 10 **seed seems more plausible than a bottom 5 pick.
torontoraptors,3dqwn6,jphvm_,2,Sat Jul 18 17:20:18 2015 UTC,East:  1) Cavs 2) Bulls 3) Raptors 4) Bucks 5) Hawks 6) Wizards 7) Pacers 8) Heat  Knicks will be terrible
torontoraptors,3dqwn6,handsomechandler,4,Sun Jul 19 01:04:04 2015 UTC,I think the Heat will be better than that
torontoraptors,3dqwn6,Vimmortality,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:23:57 2015 UTC,"Considering that the Knicks actually have competent starters in Afflalo and Lopez coming it, Melo should actually play the full season. Let's not forget this guy was in the MVP conversation for a while just 2 years ago. There was just really nothing to play for last year, the Knicks hung him out to dry. They've also got two really smart guys as the coach and president, who didn't have much to work with last year, and they've got useful pieces like Calderon and high upside assets like Porzingis. I think it's quite possible that they scrape into the playoffs as the 7th or 8th seed. I think people are underestimating this team a bit and as a result are overestimating how good our pick will be. The Knicks should have a better record than the Nuggets (because the east), and they should definitely be in contention for the playoffs. We should just be hoping they miss the playoffs and get a lottery pick, the top 5 is pretty unlikely. The most likely scenario for that to happen is if the Knicks are the 10th-14th worst team and we somehow luck out with the lottery balls (i.e Bulls: Rose, Clippers: Blake, Detroit: Darko)."
torontoraptors,3dqwn6,Kineptic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:49:45 2015 UTC,"Melo was in the MVP conversation 2 years and a knee surgery ago.   What you get out of Melo this year is completely up in the air. He has the type of game that doesn't really hinge on a huge amount of athleticism, so he should be okay...but it's still a surgery that put him out for 6 months, so you never know.  Calderon is older, slower, and was only decent before. I think it's pretty clear at this point that he is not a starting PG- it was debatable a few years ago, but definite now. They have NOTHING behind him.  Porzingis, good as he may or may not be, is a Euro playing as a rookie in NYC. If he's the number 2 option, they're in trouble. Afflalo will be asked to do something he has never done. They have the shittier Lopez.  I dunno. I don't see the Knicks even coming close. And if Anthony gets the injury bug again, they might shut it all down again. It's the Knicks. Stupid shit happens.  Philly will be worse. Detroit will likely be worse. But after that, everyone else has gotten slightly better or remained the same. By my count, the playoff teams in the East are the Hawks, Cavs, Raptors, Bulls, Wiz, Pacers... with the Bucks/Heat/Charlotte/Nets all bringing up the rear, and the rest really bringing up the rear."
torontoraptors,3dqwn6,Vimmortality,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:18:13 2015 UTC,I think the Heat could be better than us next season honestly...

torontoraptors,3dk3ri,kushblazers,0,Sat Jul 18 15:49:18 2015 UTC,I really should get League pass...
torontoraptors,3dk3ri,kushblazers,2,Thu Jul 16 22:40:51 2015 UTC,Honestly I purchased the league pass after the 1st summer league game for the Raps. It was about $18.99 and they should of just started off at $6.99. You get to watch every game and all the replays. Obviously sucks now cuz summer league is over but I thought it was worth it to watch Bruno and NP. I still hate NBATV for their outrageous and unfair pricing. Maybe a discount to all Canadians who already pay for NBATV Canada???

torontoraptors,3dib9a,Dammit81,2,Thu Jul 16 14:47:25 2015 UTC,He definitely hasn't stood out enough to really be considered for the big team. Chances are he's good enough that Mermuys wants him in Mississauga though.

torontoraptors,3dib9a,benhan23,5,Thu Jul 16 14:46:24 2015 UTC,Huh...  My bad then.
torontoraptors,3dib9a,BeesPhD,9,Thu Jul 16 14:56:57 2015 UTC,Partially Guaranteed contract only means that he gets a summer league invite and bypasses the DLeague draft. This means that we get to sign him as part of our DLeague team when the time comes. We're not signing him to our NBA team.
torontoraptors,3dib9a,Human_Traffic_Cone,2,Thu Jul 16 16:14:07 2015 UTC,Gotcha thus makes more sense to me now.

torontoraptors,3dksgo,russandkev,5,Fri Jul 17 01:57:37 2015 UTC,from what i could gather from others is that hes a good spot up shooter and that there has been improvements from last year but again he is still raw.
torontoraptors,3dksgo,Asentry_,6,Fri Jul 17 02:24:43 2015 UTC,Have to agree with that assessment. Meanwhile Norman Powell is killing teams
torontoraptors,3dksgo,Bizzare10,-9,Fri Jul 17 02:41:54 2015 UTC,He killed OUR team today though.
torontoraptors,3dksgo,gabriel1073,3,Fri Jul 17 03:51:46 2015 UTC,"He played poorly in the fire, but he picked it up in the second, and made those clutch back to back threes."

torontoraptors,3dksgo,Bizzare10,0,Sun Jul 19 18:23:16 2015 UTC,also much stronger and more confident. some people think he got taller but I believe that is unconfirmed
torontoraptors,3dksgo,This_is_what_you_ge,7,Fri Jul 17 04:13:04 2015 UTC,"Overall he's improved, but he is noticeably slower which is disconcerting. As a perimeter defender above the arc, he just gets blown by over and over again which sucks. Right now he's a good weakside defender to come and tag the roll man with his gigantic wingspan."
torontoraptors,3dksgo,RetartedMooseGas,5,Fri Jul 17 03:52:40 2015 UTC,classic raptors training staff. Ruined JV's speed now Bruno's.
torontoraptors,3dksgo,mixxAOR,5,Fri Jul 17 04:54:20 2015 UTC,"Damned if you do, damned if you don't type situation, no? I agree the speed sucks, but if they left him a stick people would kill our staff for not making him out on muscle. Now he's too slow. It's a weird balance. It's the risk you take when you draft a guy for his undeveloped body I guess"
torontoraptors,3dksgo,RetartedMooseGas,-3,Fri Jul 17 04:57:33 2015 UTC,I just think they don't know what they are doing.
torontoraptors,3dksgo,mixxAOR,5,Fri Jul 17 04:59:53 2015 UTC,"There's no way bruno is too heavy at this point. He's still fairly skinny, so it's not like they bulked him up past the point of any reasonable NBA player. What I'm saying is maybe bruno was passable in the speed department when he was a twig, but at anywhere near normal weight he is truly a slow guy."
torontoraptors,3dksgo,RetartedMooseGas,0,Fri Jul 17 05:07:13 2015 UTC,yeah maybe being a stretch 4 is more realistic goal. But he's kind of a tweener then. Big chance that he'll never amount to anything.
torontoraptors,3dksgo,mixxAOR,4,Fri Jul 17 05:29:00 2015 UTC,I think he is still couple years away.... I think the game is moving a little too fast for him. I think the Raptors 905 will really help him out.  We gotta realiaze that Bruno never played college ball and that he is very raw on terms of his body and his skills. The Dleauge is where he will grow into a solid player.

So I guess raptors have 14 players on their roster now? + Robberts, who was signed to a non guaranteed deal. I imagine the last spot will go to a PF after training camp. Wouldn't actually mind seeing Psycho T taking that last spot at PF, the guy is a fighter but don't think it's likely.   Absolutely LOVING how this team looks. Add a rebounding PF and we're ready..  PG: Lowry, Joseph, Wright  SG: DeRozan, Ross, Powell  SF: Carroll, Johnson, Bruno  PF: Patterson, Scola  C: Valanciunas, Biyombo, Bebe"
torontoraptors,3dfcqx,karedogino,12,Wed Jul 15 21:17:58 2015 UTC,I heard there's going to be a lot of JJ at the four this year
torontoraptors,3dfcqx,DaveyBaby27,5,Wed Jul 15 21:24:08 2015 UTC,"Sounds good, I'd love to see the guy get more minutes. If he improves his 3, he could be a seriously good stretch 4. Still think another big at PF man could be useful. The season is long, injuries can happen and don't think we need any help in other 4 positions. Since Joseph can play PG and SG, Ross can play 2 and 3 and so can Demarr and we got 3 decent centers. Don't see the last spot going anywhere else than PF"
torontoraptors,3dfcqx,karedogino,5,Wed Jul 15 21:27:32 2015 UTC,"Why not bring back Hansbrough?  I know that he's nothing special, but he's still a young-ish energy big we can sign for cheap, and beggars can't be choosers."
torontoraptors,3dfcqx,talentpun,4,Wed Jul 15 22:42:29 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind bringing him back. Just don't think it's likely he'd sign a non guaranteed deal and go through training camp without a guaranteed contract. And I think that would have to be the case, since  raptors already signed Robberts"
torontoraptors,3dfcqx,karedogino,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:46:10 2015 UTC,Of course. Didn't know we're out of spots already.
torontoraptors,3dfcqx,talentpun,5,Wed Jul 15 23:05:36 2015 UTC,"We're not.  Roberts deal is only a partially guaranteed deal, meaning he gets anywhere between $25-$50k and a training camp invite.  If he makes the team, it's most likely a minimum salary for two years with a team option, I'm sure."

torontoraptors,3dfcqx,JoRo_,3,Wed Jul 15 23:55:38 2015 UTC,Meh it was the DeMar injury that gassed him
torontoraptors,3dfcqx,benhan23,3,Thu Jul 16 00:31:39 2015 UTC,I'm more concerned with the way his attitude deteriorated as the season went along. Hopefully he continues to buy in and doesn't resort to hero ball.
torontoraptors,3dfcqx,JoRo_,2,Thu Jul 16 06:09:01 2015 UTC,Yeah it was strange.. It went from being the heart of the raptors to being non existent. I think all of our questions will be answered this season. Will Lowry return? Is TRoss a reliable scorer in his natural position? Will JV ever take the next step? Is DD a Allstar? Can 2Patt start? Should be fun. Our new pieces will certainly help.
torontoraptors,3dfcqx,benhan23,2,Thu Jul 16 06:11:33 2015 UTC,"We need to go back to our fundamentals. Casey's Pound the Rock gave us an identity where we played at our best. This season will prove a lot of things about a lot of players on our roster this season, I'd hate to see them blow it."

This is very similar to the contracts Houston signs their second rounders to (it's how they had Parsons as the league's biggest steal). Also gives a bunch of team-friendly moments: If he isn't cutting it after 2 years, just don't pick up the option. If he is an asset after the third (non-guaranteed) year, he's restricted."
torontoraptors,3dgd3r,kushblazers,7,Thu Jul 16 15:26:37 2015 UTC,"The important note on this deal is that Toronto signed him into it's remaining cap space, so they could give Powell a 3rd year and get his Bird rights and match offers if the Raptors are over the cap when he becomes a free agent.  If Toronto was out of cap space, the most they could have given him is a 2 year deal with no Bird rights, and if we are over the cap when he's a free agent and he signs another offer sheet, we could only match if we had the free space."

torontoraptors,3diijp,iamwearingashirt,7,Thu Jul 16 15:28:51 2015 UTC,"You are forgetting arguably our greatest 2nd round pick in the history of the franchise, the Red Rocket. Chicago picked him but we traded for him on draft night, so he deserves to be on this list if Pape Sow is there. PJ Tucker has turned out to be the best player overall, but obviously he barely played when he was on our roster.  I don't see any reason why Norman Powell won't turn out to be better than all of these guys. That's really not saying much, but I really like this kid's game. He's a standout defensively, insane vertical, great slashing ability. If he can tighten up his handle, and develop 3 point range, he could easily end up being the steal of the draft. I don't understand why 4 year college players seem to always slip so far in the draft, but I'm not complaining. Powell seems like he's more NBA ready than a lot of the guys who were picked before him, and he looks like he has some nice upside as well.  As for the question, I say he lasts over a year for sure. He fits in perfectly with the defensive minded culture we are trying to create, seems like he has a great head on his shoulders, and has to have really impressed our management with his summer league performance. We just signed him to a 3 year contract I believe. So it's safe to say he will become our longest tenured second round pick"
torontoraptors,3diijp,ZachK92,2,Thu Jul 16 15:47:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I just did a quick wikipedia research for my info. Anyway, Norman will stick in the league for more than a year for sure. But he might make a good trade asset, so who knows how long it'll be with the raptors. Ukic signed a 3 year contract and only stayed one. So far Norman looks good though."

torontoraptors,3dgjye,ElCaz,0,Thu Jul 16 03:39:50 2015 UTC,How does it take this long to find a CEO... I wish they'd just put their differences behind them and keep him.
torontoraptors,3dgjye,phorner23,3,Thu Jul 16 05:00:23 2015 UTC,It's less a differences thing than he misses L.A. and stuff. Because of that he's not in a huge hurry to go.
torontoraptors,3dgjye,MaximusCawkus,5,Thu Jul 16 05:14:20 2015 UTC,"It is a differences issue. He was willing to spend money for the fans to build on the brand and the culture of winning Toronto sports teams. Larry Tanenbaum as well as the board of directors of Bell and Rogers don't give a fuck about spending more money although it may benefit them in the long run. They're happy with mediocre teams as long as it still fills seats and sells tickets. Not to mention every decision he makes has to go through a 3 way vote, two from Bell and Roger and one for the intermediary. This really puts him on a short leash as CEO and it's hard to get things done the way the system is.   “Critics against MLSE . . . maintained they did their job and created profits for shareholders,” Powers said. “Leiweke brought in change and invested in fans. He spent on behalf of the fans. The fear now is (MLSE might) revert back to shareholders instead of fans, and they don’t have to do much because their arenas are full."""
torontoraptors,3dgjye,hyperd0uche,0,Thu Jul 16 06:10:56 2015 UTC,"That's a very stupid and shortsighted way to look at MLSE.  Can they practically print money even when the Leafs are playing like shit? Yes.  Would they make even more money if the Leafs/Raptors were contending for titles every year? Yes.  However, they don't set out to stay mediocre when there is more money to be made being successful.  There's a salary cap in the NBA and NHL, they can't just go out and spend over the cap without financial repercussions, or at all in the NHL's case.  The CEO of MLSE, as shitty as this sounds, doesn't work for us fans.  He works for the shareholders.  Masai and Shanahan also seem like they have complete control over their operations, can you provide an example of the owners stepping in and causing any of the Raptors/Leafs transactions to fall through?    How about MLSE letting Leiweke spend to his heart's content to bring Giovinco and Altidore to TFC this year, 1 year after bringing Bradley and Defoe and going ahead with the BMO Field expansion.  But yeah, keep spinning that ""LOL HURDURR, DAE MLSE ONLY CARES ABOUT $$$$$, NOT WINNING"".  Yeah they care about money, as any business owner should, but they also care about winning and how winning will increase your profits."

torontoraptors,3dgjye,MaximusCawkus,2,Thu Jul 16 10:08:20 2015 UTC,"Hopefully it stays that way.  I found it interesting when they announced a while back the Leiweke was staying on, on a Friday afternoon like they were trying to bury it.  The optimist in me says that whatever differences MLSE and Tim had is now buried and Tim is staying on a semi-permanent basis, and the only reason they're trying to keep it on the down low is because MLSE doesn't want to embarrass itself since they were the ones to go out of their way to make press announcement a year ago to say the Tim Leiweke is leaving and they will find a replacement within a year(which has come and pass)."

torontoraptors,3datxz,thatdudecalledZZ,33,Tue Jul 14 21:01:04 2015 UTC,I don't know why everybody wants to trade him so badly. Lets give him 1/4 of the season to show us what hes got. If he doesn't show any growth then trade him. I really like the way our raptors squad is filling out with potential players from the Dleague team. I think Ross is a nice fit he just needs to be more consistent when it comes to scoring. I think it wasn't fair to put Ross on some of the defensive matchups he had last season. Maybe that was getting in his head and messing with his offense. This year with JYD2.0 on the team Ross doesn't have to be the best or 2nd best defender on the team. He can just focus on scoring. I still think hes a freak athletically and deserves another shot. From the beginning he has always been down with the Raps and has confessed his desire to stay.
torontoraptors,3datxz,kushblazers,6,Tue Jul 14 21:50:15 2015 UTC,They want to move him b/c he's decent and you'll get something decent back for him. Not too many guys on the team with his value that are redundant.
torontoraptors,3datxz,TheGursh,9,Tue Jul 14 21:55:07 2015 UTC,"T-ross has all the tools.  Doesnt sound like he really understands how drastically his game needs to change from last year in order for him to be an impact player in this league though.  I believe its all mental with him.  He doesnt need more athleticism, just the basketball IQ to use it properly"
torontoraptors,3datxz,Broonskk,6,Tue Jul 14 22:06:09 2015 UTC,"thats exactly it, its all mental. i hope he can put it together this upcoming season. IF he gets better and we keep him awesome if he gets better and his value goes sky high for a  trade that's great to :D, but if he goes to shit we wont get anything for him. Its his last chance to show everyone he is a legit well rounded player enough with potential its time."
torontoraptors,3datxz,superiorfox,3,Tue Jul 14 22:40:52 2015 UTC,"He really is oblivious which gets us fans all riled up. Doesn't seem like the type to learn quickly. He's a father now though, which helps a lot of guys in the league figure it out. I hope TRoss does too"

torontoraptors,3datxz,bballi,5,Wed Jul 15 09:42:28 2015 UTC,"His development has been horrendous. Going into his 4th year and doesn't have a consistent jumper or any real ""style"" to his game. You never know what you're going to get from him... He doesn't even dunk, he'll softy attack the rim and lay it up. He can't defend most 3s, he can't shoot 3s consistently, can't create a shot for himself, doesn't move well off ball. There's just nothing you can count on him for each and every game. Like you know when Demar backs down into the post and shoots his turnaround J, its a good percentage of going in. I couldn't tell you what a good shot for TRoss would be besides a dunk.  He has 1 year left on his rookie contract, his stock is low as fuck so there's no point in trading him. If he performs well this season and his stock rises then I'd want to trade him and get someone with more consistency... Otherwise let him go at the end of the year."
torontoraptors,3datxz,michaelsp9,5,Tue Jul 14 22:08:54 2015 UTC,I mentioned him having to guard the opposing teams 1st or 2nd options on offense? That means he is usually guarding someone 5-15 lbs heavier and a bit taller. He had a chance to take over during DD injury but how could he when you have iso Lou on the team. He didn't shine when DD was injured but again I think it goes back to him having to guard bigger/taller players. I don't think Casey liked that style of play with Lou but was stuck with that personnel and he even said himself the team wasn't good enough for playoffs. You are just hating. TRoss trade value at its lowest in his career why would Masai trade him for basically nothing? Ross will probably have 2 months to beef up his trade value or to prove to Masai hes worthy.
torontoraptors,3datxz,kushblazers,2,Tue Jul 14 22:26:56 2015 UTC,"I'm eager to see him play against fellow 2's.  He was solid guarding 3's 2 years ago but everyone knew that wasn't his natural position, and he came back down to earth last year.  He's easy to blame but I'm gonna wait for some coaching adjustments before I'm ready to ship him out.  He's still young, and I think the main problem is that expectations for him are pretty high, being the 9th pick and all.  It was clear after his first year that he had big holes though, and those don't get fixed over 2 seasons."

He doesn't have ""all the tools"" like a lot of people here are saying. He's undersized and is scrawny. Just because he can jump out of the gym, doesn't mean he can be a good basketball player. He's not assertive or aggressive, doesn't have a high basketball IQ, and doesn't have the mental fortitude to not let the ebb and flow of the season bother him.   He's probably going to still continue to almost exclusively shoot jumpers rather than using his jumping ability to be aggressive and draw fouls, and he's going to do so at a higher clip than last year since he's supposed to be filling in Lou's role. Expect a less efficient version of last season. Trade him for some value now while other teams still think there's something there worth trading for, rather than let TRoss prove them wrong."

torontoraptors,3datxz,Broonskk,2,Wed Jul 15 20:22:15 2015 UTC,"I like that we're putting team success over loyalty to dwindling assets. It's a huge step in the right direction. Loyalty should be earned by on court production and ability, not expected because you wore the jersey.  It's not a mistake. TRoss isn't strong or big enough to go in and take contact. He's scared to. He's not just going to start randomly attacking the hoop with reckless abandon at this point of his career. Jumping ability makes you a great dunk contest dunker. Strength and size along with jumping ability makes you a great in game dunker. He doesn't have the tools to do it."
torontoraptors,3datxz,king_lloyd11,-6,Wed Jul 15 22:15:12 2015 UTC,So that was Ross trying to be a good defender last year? Yikes will be funny to see him not have to focus on that.....

torontoraptors,3datxz,chiggity,-3,Wed Jul 15 04:21:50 2015 UTC,"Terrence Ross is GOAT. I'd rather trade Demar and let Ross take over than visa versa, if we are thinking about the long term future of this ball club. Hear me out. Demar's stock is WAY higher than Ross's so we could get something much nicer in return. When Ross attacks the basket yea its unpredictable right now but he takes so many less shots than guys like Derozan and Lowry that people just arent even giving him a chance to develop. Through 3 years Ross has only attempted 1961 shots. Comparatively, Derozan took 3,628 shots his the last 3 years; thats almost twice as many shots as Ross took. If Ross becomes our main SG I could see him outperforming Derozan by a LARGE margin.  I know that's a pretty unpopular opinion around here but yall saw what Ross is capable of when he is let loose. Everyone just needs to have his back and he WILL tear shit up. I'm not hating on DD here, I'm just saying Ross has talent, major talent, and we just need to tap into it and let him loose."
torontoraptors,3datxz,Life_Of_High,6,Tue Jul 14 22:47:40 2015 UTC,"Ross had his chance when Derozan went down to injury. Ross didn't step up at all, instead it became the Lou Williams/Kyle Lowry show."
torontoraptors,3datxz,kushblazers,2,Tue Jul 14 23:11:07 2015 UTC,"You guys forget that TRoss plays better when DD is around because opposing defenders focus on DD. Ross is not a primary scorer on any team lets be honest. Once you add Lou Williams to this picture I think it kind of ruined that complimentary effect DD and TRoss had on each other. Maybe it was the switch to iso style basketball. If you look at TRoss draft combine they mention his ""habit to disappear at times throughout his high school and college career"". Ross needs to get his mental game right because he has all the tools."

torontoraptors,3datxz,creepypaster,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:47:39 2015 UTC,"he didn't step up because that's not his role or his play style, so far in his years in the league the coaching staff has been coaching him to be a 3 and D guy, not as a main offensive threat guy."
torontoraptors,3datxz,chiggity,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:28:45 2015 UTC,Exactly my point brotha
torontoraptors,3datxz,chiggity,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:49:59 2015 UTC,Ross hasn't developed because I don't think he is confident enough that DC trusts him. He's super young in this league and has always had those vets that will take more shots than him (and get more minutes too). I'm just saying if he grows and gets that confidence and takes good shots and a lot of them he can be a really really good player.
torontoraptors,3datxz,Toront06,3,Tue Jul 14 23:32:39 2015 UTC,There is absolutely no way this happens. Derozan works way harder than most players in the entire league. The guy is always in the gym working on something and comes into every season improved (except on 3s). Ross has done nothing to show you he'd be better with more minutes.
torontoraptors,3datxz,chiggity,0,Tue Jul 14 23:05:42 2015 UTC,"Ya DD works way harder, but if Ross gets the mentality that its his team to lead I feel like he'll develop a way better work ethic and just look 100x more confident out there."
torontoraptors,3datxz,chiggity,0,Tue Jul 14 23:34:13 2015 UTC,"Ya DD works way harder, but if Ross gets the mentality that its his team to lead I feel like he'll develop a way better work ethic and just look 100x more confident out there."
torontoraptors,3datxz,mocha-thunder,2,Tue Jul 14 23:36:28 2015 UTC,"He has had chance after chance to improve and he never has. When DD got injured he didn't step up and that was a huge chance. They even benched him for a bit in the hopes of getting his head right and maybe being more productive, which has worked for lots of guys in the past. Instead he completely shut down. He isnt mentally strong enough to lead a team or mature enough to be a difference maker."

torontoraptors,3dfftk,doctordiddy,2,Wed Jul 15 21:28:25 2015 UTC,"I'll pass...in our situation, Patterson, Ross,and a 2016 1st is too much for Ibaka imo"
torontoraptors,3dfftk,lilmulla1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:28:24 2015 UTC,"I would have to disagree. Ibaka is 25 years-old (technically younger than Patterson) and a top rim protector with a serious shot now. He's a great player who would cover a lot of our deficiencies. What's mentioned in the trade is quite steep, but you have a guaranteed talent in Ibaka who's still young, too. I love Patterson, and maybe an alternate arrangement would be possible (we would still probably have to eat some cash for it to even be considered), but I would still be happy with the trade if it happened (which is unlikely)."
torontoraptors,3dfftk,CallMeDoc24,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:02:20 2015 UTC,"I mean, if Denver wanna rebuild and tank, they'd want a 1st round pick but I think OKC would also want a 1st round pick + why would they ever want to give up Ibaka? He's a great fit for them"

torontoraptors,3dfftk,B-Rabbbit,3,Wed Jul 15 21:20:28 2015 UTC,"So the Raptors biggest need right now right is a PF who can space the floor and protect the rim in order to perfectly compliment JV... and you want Faried?! Ibaka is not only a much better player, but a much better fit."
torontoraptors,3dfftk,Vimmortality,2,Wed Jul 15 21:21:58 2015 UTC,im not sure if there are any bigs who can both space the floor with shooting and defend the paint like Ibaka (Bosh maybe?) Usually stretch 4's are weak on defense and rebounding.
torontoraptors,3dfftk,creepypaster,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:27:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly, just goes to show how valuable of a player Serge Ibaka really is. However, my point was just to emphasize that Faried doesn't fulfil either of those criteria."

torontoraptors,3d8sxj,RileyCola,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:20:48 2015 UTC,I don't think he sees the floor more next year. He's still very clumsy and uncoordinated and Id imagine that'd drive Casey nuts.
torontoraptors,3d8sxj,PowerForward,6,Tue Jul 14 18:01:44 2015 UTC,"in the first summer league game Masai was interviewed by the commentary dudes, he actually said they were going to try and get him more minutes next year.  He doesn't look clumsy to me and actually has shown great hands and solid footwork for a big man, but he does get out of position a lot and gets left scrambling."
torontoraptors,3d8sxj,creepypaster,2,Tue Jul 14 18:22:13 2015 UTC,"Idk I'm just really down on the guy. He's  almost 23 and his skill set is still very limited. He doesn't look like an NBA player to me and I wouldn't be surprised if he got cut or traded as filler by the end of the season.  he's a nice dude and I like him, but I think management recognizes that and they're only keeping him around for Bruno."
torontoraptors,3d8sxj,PowerForward,3,Tue Jul 14 18:36:52 2015 UTC,"7 footers will always have a place in the league no matter how small ball oriented it becomes. So he may not look like an NBA player but he sure looks like one, and sometimes  that's enough."

To me, his skill set for a big is pretty standard - and actually similar to Biyombo, exchanging athleticism for length though.  He's a solid rebounder and shot blocker who I think can contribute on an NBA team pretty soon.  From watching him this year and last, I'm happy to see him improve year to year.  Some guys are just late bloomers, 23 isn't old imo."

In my opinion I feel like he will grow more with the farm team by playing more games. The only way I see him coming up is if we trade one of our guards (TRoss) and he slides in.
torontoraptors,3d7kr9,thatdudecalledZZ,4,Tue Jul 14 03:25:18 2015 UTC,He covered a huge amount of ground with his last 2 strides. What an athletic freak!

torontoraptors,3d7kr9,naderon,3,Tue Jul 14 05:01:11 2015 UTC,once he starts catching and driving like this more often he will be hard to stop.

torontoraptors,3d7ucs,dealin92,15,Tue Jul 14 20:28:18 2015 UTC,"Missed watching Delon play tonight. Bebe is a serious rim protector/rebounder. He threw a pass out of bounds today on the roll after the defenders blued the PG. It was actually a good pss and generally a hard one for the big to make when tagged, the corner shooter just moved, which he shouldn't have. I really liked that from bebe. Bruno is just so slow and flat footed. Above the arc on the perimeter, he gives the Ballhandler a side of the floor to completely drive straight to the rim. He's compensating for poor lateral quickness IMO. Missed a ton of wide open threes today, but he's ""proven"" he can make them so it's not terrible. The boy sure has confidence. Loved his take to the rim when he got pissed off. He needs to work on a lot of stuff but as per usual, I like his upside.    I love Norman Powell. I worry stuff he does now won't translate without being the primary Ballhandler in an actual NBA situation, but right now he looks great. Honestly feel that even if teams sag off him, he will still be able to finish in the paint a la JJ. Would like to see him as primary on ball defender more next game just to get that kind of a look on him. He's good though. Even dropped it off to bebe when the D collapsed on him in the paint. Kid can ball."
torontoraptors,3d7ucs,RetartedMooseGas,11,Tue Jul 14 04:59:07 2015 UTC,Another positive is Jesse Mermuys' coaching so far. He's calling the right timeouts to stop the momentum and drawing up excellent plays involving Bebe coming out of it. Can't wait for his coaching to develop as well.
torontoraptors,3d7ucs,xC6H1206x,6,Tue Jul 14 05:18:24 2015 UTC,"I'm liking the horns flex stuff, high post split cuts with bebe as the decision maker, 21 pick and roll in transition that the dubs use. A lot of this stuff isn't being run as well as NBA level, but the base is there."
torontoraptors,3d7ucs,ModernPoultry,2,Tue Jul 14 05:24:53 2015 UTC,Seems like a good sign... I recall hearing that the Raptors and 905 will be running almost the same stuff.
torontoraptors,3d7ucs,Old_Runescape,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:52:14 2015 UTC,That's the idea to help make the transition smoother. Make them buy in too
torontoraptors,3d7ucs,shiny_dittos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:25:02 2015 UTC,It really suits Powell. He was beasting and feasting off the those plays
torontoraptors,3d7ucs,xC6H1206x,7,Tue Jul 14 23:33:18 2015 UTC,"Bebe looked like a man among boys when playing D and rebounding. Powell played great again. Bruno needs some work. Terrible shot selection at times, his D is lacking, (although nice block because of impressive length), and he needs to drive more. Still very young, has upside."
torontoraptors,3d7ucs,jyh123,7,Tue Jul 14 05:14:23 2015 UTC,It must be tough to make a name for yourself when your last name is scrubb
torontoraptors,3d7ucs,JeahNotSlice,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:44:15 2015 UTC,It's incredible he even got this far without his name psychologically taking him out of it
torontoraptors,3d7ucs,jyh123,10,Tue Jul 14 13:26:29 2015 UTC,"Powell's alright, but I'd say Bebe was even more important anchoring the defense.  Bebe's a +/- monster.  Hope Ujiri was taking notes from the stands and ask Casey why he preferred playing Chuck and Steamer over this kid."
torontoraptors,3d7ucs,Hiya_tiger,6,Tue Jul 14 05:07:14 2015 UTC,"4 blocks , some nifty passes, was great tonight"
torontoraptors,3d7ucs,gabriel1073,3,Tue Jul 14 05:09:02 2015 UTC,"C'mon, beebs is still raw as hell, and skinny as a rake. Steamer (love the nickname BTW) and Chuck were the exact opposite, and more what the team needed. The thing that we have to keep in mind is that players like Bebe and Bruno need time to develop, and have the luxury of time. Like, years. Why hurry?  That said, this is Bebe's season. No one has mentioned his outlet passing, but it's on point - not afraid to spit it out quick, but safe."

torontoraptors,3d655z,kushblazers,3,Tue Jul 14 02:27:37 2015 UTC,"Since there are only two courts at the LSVL, I think they have to wait for the previous game to be completely done and have the players off the court."
torontoraptors,3d655z,Vimmortality,11,Tue Jul 14 02:30:14 2015 UTC,So NBATV Canada screws us over by not broadcasting 2 summer league raptors games. What does NBATV do.. charge Canadians $18.99 for a summer league pass while they charge Americans $4.99. I get the exchange rate but still don't understand how they came to that pricing SMH!!
torontoraptors,3d655z,kushblazers,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:51:39 2015 UTC,"I don't know how the cable TV deals work. But as far as what I knew about League Pass, it was the worst option you may consider comparing to even firstrow etc. No Raptors coverage throughout the season (WTF!). No National TV coverage (ABC, TNT etc). No Playoffs. And super expensive. I would prefer a ballstream or reddit/nbastream all day than League Pass. LPLP is just horrible (at least in Canada)."

torontoraptors,3d2ics,quietraptor,6,Mon Jul 13 01:17:38 2015 UTC,I might be looking too far in to the future but I believe that Delon Wright will be the back up PG in the near future. I think that Cory will be starting in about 2-3 years when Lowry declines. It is early though.
torontoraptors,3d2ics,TreyGrant10,5,Mon Jul 13 02:15:20 2015 UTC,I think you could be correct. they could be set at point guard for the next 5 years or so.

torontoraptors,3d2wvw,Fitment,3,Mon Jul 13 05:27:20 2015 UTC,lots of mid-range jumpers.
torontoraptors,3d2wvw,Al_O_Pecia,2,Mon Jul 13 12:04:39 2015 UTC,his shot has improved alot just from watching his college highlights
torontoraptors,3d2wvw,ahobbledehoy,3,Mon Jul 13 05:42:33 2015 UTC,"On the one hand, you take what the D gives you. And he does have nice elevation on his shot. I can see the smith comparison (/u/yiga ).There is something a little bit DRose about his shot, but that is pure cosmetic; Powell has nowhere the speed, explosiveness, handles, etc of Rose.  On the other hand, this team does not need a Nick Young or a Lou Williams. It needs guys who will buy into a system.   It can be hard to distill what a player is actually like, and how he will fit onto a team, from SL. Powell is trying to showcase his talents, and doing a great job, too. But I am sure the work he is doing in practice, and the impression he is making on his coaches (listening, teachable, interpersonal skills) is ultimately more important.   Although almost missing that breakaway dunk was not a good sign."
torontoraptors,3d2wvw,JeahNotSlice,2,Mon Jul 13 13:43:21 2015 UTC,The reason he was drafted was defense and it will continue to be his calling card. His shot is just gravy
torontoraptors,3d2wvw,JeahNotSlice,0,Mon Jul 13 14:14:46 2015 UTC,"Fair enough point, but he's taking a lot of shots for a guy who wants to make a name for himself with his D."

Powell might be a nice choice one of those end of bench spots. Powell, Roberts, Bebe, Bruno and Wright should fill out spots 10-15 nicely, some youth there.   People need to remember this is summer league."
torontoraptors,3d2xt2,locdogjr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:13:51 2015 UTC,Pretty sure if he's not on our roster anyone in the league can sign him off our d-league team.
torontoraptors,3d2xt2,LinuxF4n,2,Mon Jul 13 20:49:49 2015 UTC,I don't think that's the case.  You can draft and stash a player in the D-League
torontoraptors,3d2xt2,iatemyredcrayon,2,Mon Jul 13 21:10:41 2015 UTC,"A call-up occurs when a player is signed by an NBA team. An NBA team is allowed to sign any D-League player as long as they are eligible to play in the NBA under the current Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). However, an NBA team cannot call-up a player whose draft rights are still held by another NBA team. A D-League player is usually signed to a 10-day contract, a short term contract which expires after 10 days. A player can only sign two 10-day contracts with the same team in one season. If the team wants to retain the player after the second 10-day contract expired, the team must sign the player for the remainder of the season.   http://www.nba.com/dleague/santacruz/dleague_faqs.html  Looks like you're right."
torontoraptors,3d2xt2,LinuxF4n,6,Mon Jul 13 21:20:21 2015 UTC,exactly. most of his shots are wide open midrangers cause its summer league. he plays good D tho

Make of it what you will. What I made of it is that Powell is very deserving of a roster spot since Ross has played plenty in his rookie season coming off similar college and summer league stats. Is he better than Ross? Maybe not now. Is he on pace to become a player like Ross and possibly better? I think so.
torontoraptors,3d2xt2,nikola_i,2,Mon Jul 13 19:52:06 2015 UTC,Agree. Anyone recall Dwight Buycks?
torontoraptors,3d2xt2,CrucialXP,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:31:04 2015 UTC,Yea at the end of the day he's still a prospect.  We should keep him in the organization for now to help him develop.

torontoraptors,3d2gb6,enraged_platypus,7,Mon Jul 13 00:19:59 2015 UTC,I would too but I want him to play the full year in the D-League. More playing time will allow him to grow.

torontoraptors,3d2gb6,imdahman,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:27:51 2015 UTC,quick question about D league. Is it like the NHL where you can all players in the team are signed to you and can be called any time up?
torontoraptors,3d2gb6,Togonnagetsomerando,2,Tue Jul 14 00:32:06 2015 UTC,"I think it works more like that now... up until a few years ago it was much harder to bring ppl up to the NBA from the D-League and vice versa, and then they changed the rules to make it easier and much more similar to the NHL model."
torontoraptors,3d2gb6,imdahman,0,Wed Jul 15 00:22:31 2015 UTC,so we can up to 30 guys signed then?
torontoraptors,3d2gb6,Togonnagetsomerando,2,Wed Jul 15 00:46:16 2015 UTC,Powell also got two blocks. Defensive and offensive summer leangue machine
torontoraptors,3d2gb6,DivinityGod,-7,Mon Jul 13 12:12:04 2015 UTC,"I am not saying this just cause of his poor performance now, this is more of an observation....did we made a mistake by drafting Caboclo ? I know it's too early, but I think that 6-7 years from now we'll be looking at players drafted after him and saying we've done a huge mistake.  Overall another ok game, I like how well we're playing in the Summer League both last year and this one.  Bebe had a great game.  Wright had only his 2nd game so I won't judge him still...but if he has another poor shooting form I  think he won't see a lot of playing time this season much like Caboclo last year.  Powell was decent, and lol that Scrubb guy went it just so he can get some seconds next to his statline   Seeing the stat line it seems like Roberts had a great game...now I can't remember what he did last match but +30 is great +/- to have. I'll ceratainlly keep an eye to him in the next game."
torontoraptors,3d2gb6,dragonsky,15,Mon Jul 13 00:16:54 2015 UTC,It's too early to say. Bruno is only 19 years old. From watching him right now he looks really RAW. All he can do right now is spot up and hit 3s if someone creates a shot for him. On defense he looks like he's running around without knowing what he's doing. He was also leaving players wide open on 3pt line then running to cover them when they were already in the shooting motion.  I personally wanted KJ McDanial but I think it's too early to say. We wont know for another couple years if he can be anything. He has the physical tools though and his jumper looks pretty decent. His English improving should also help him improve over the coming years.
torontoraptors,3d2gb6,LinuxF4n,10,Mon Jul 13 00:26:27 2015 UTC,I was never a fan of the Caboclo pick but I'll support the kid no matter what

torontoraptors,3d2gb6,cheechw,2,Mon Jul 13 03:57:44 2015 UTC,If you look at the people drafted at 20 they're more missed than hits so you might as well take a risk if it is there. He is still a 19 year old kid. He will improve with our Raps staff developing him and he will be guarenteed minutes.
torontoraptors,3d2gb6,TreyGrant10,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:07:11 2015 UTC,"anybody would look raw if you just let them rot on the bench for a year.  on top of that, the kid didn't have that much basketball experience.  it's on the organization and the coaches that a guy who clearly needs developing wasn't afforded opportunities to do so.  the in game situations, the pressure, the reads, running sets... they need to be done in a real game environment which is hopefully what D-league will provide."

That's if they don't trade either of them.  If anyone is familiar with the CBA and our current situation, please shed light on possible max contracts on the team."

If the cap balloons up to the projected $100M, that's functionally $25M and $30M yearly."
torontoraptors,3d35ps,butipoopfromtheredoe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:55:19 2015 UTC,"I think Jonas would get 25 a year in that scenario. That's the equivalent of 17 a year, which is what Monroe and Kanter got.   If we give Derozan 30 a year I will cry manly tears."
torontoraptors,3d35ps,DrLyleEvans,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:43:49 2015 UTC,"The max is based on years played and is calculated as a percentage of the cap. Val's max will be similar to Kanter, but DeRozan's max will be much larger. I really don't think DeRozan is a max player. However if his game continues evolving he may get the offer from someone, especially considering the darth of SGs in the league."
torontoraptors,3d35ps,firekil,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:39:43 2015 UTC,"This contract is also a product of the increasing cap next year. Right now its a ""max contract"" but next year it will only be a 15% contract. If my napkin-math is correct that's like the equivalent of ~10 mill/year in this year's cap."
torontoraptors,3d35ps,iguelmay,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:34:54 2015 UTC,Also to take into consideration big man get paid alot more than wings and gaurds.. They are considered rare.. That's why guys like Manroe and Kanter get max deals.. JV should be getting near that.. But we will see when the new salary cap comes out
torontoraptors,3d2eur,DaveyBaby27,12,Sun Jul 12 23:52:31 2015 UTC,People said he couldn't shoot. I have seen plenty of evidence to the contrary.
torontoraptors,3d2eur,DrKevorkean,5,Mon Jul 13 00:09:14 2015 UTC,He has an unorthodox form and a long release which is not great against NBA defenders.
torontoraptors,3d2eur,fazon,8,Mon Jul 13 02:59:48 2015 UTC,its summer league boys calm down. Didn't JV win summer league MVP once? Norman looks really good still needs to work on his 3 but can contribute immediately defensively. I want him to develop a bit more with the 905. We are already stacked at sg/sf. okafor/towns/curry/bruno MVP
torontoraptors,3d2eur,kushblazers,9,Mon Jul 13 00:14:08 2015 UTC,He was a senior so at like 23 years of age idk if development is really the right course of action with a guy like him
torontoraptors,3d2eur,benhan23,2,Mon Jul 13 00:21:00 2015 UTC,Well he won't be seeing games right away in the NBA assuming everyone comes in healthy. He can dominate DLeague in the meantime.
torontoraptors,3d2eur,SuminderJi,2,Mon Jul 13 00:24:02 2015 UTC,Hes been on fire.  Maybe.
torontoraptors,3d2eur,pangify,2,Sun Jul 12 23:55:36 2015 UTC,"Hes playing honestly so well, I am surprised he is a 2nd round pick. If I was Masai and I watched the LVSL before draft, I would have taken him at first even. He is playing much better and with much more confidence than everyone else.   I think if he continues playing like this, he definetly earns a spot on raptor bench. Watching him with biyombo, ppat, scola, and ross would be a blessing."
torontoraptors,3d2eur,RetartedMooseGas,-6,Sun Jul 12 23:59:44 2015 UTC,He may already be better than Terrence
torontoraptors,3d2eur,nazthetech,17,Mon Jul 13 00:01:19 2015 UTC,Simmer
torontoraptors,3d2eur,mrmartis,-1,Mon Jul 13 00:03:27 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying, I wouldnt be surprised if he was All NBA 3rd maybe even 2nd team."

torontoraptors,3d2eur,jqsonl,2,Mon Jul 13 00:11:21 2015 UTC,"Ok we can't say he is better than Ross till we see him against NBA players and not shitty d-leagues. But yea, the way he is playing I can see him surpassing Ross. and Lol at your NBA 3rd team comment. (i know you are joking)"
torontoraptors,3d2eur,This_is_what_you_ge,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:15:55 2015 UTC,T$ scored 51 once.  He's still a kid with a substantial upside. I for one haven't given up on him.
torontoraptors,3d2eur,HatTrickPony,0,Mon Jul 13 20:24:48 2015 UTC,agreed. Better than Ross. He's playing really well
torontoraptors,3d2eur,Kineptic,5,Mon Jul 13 00:06:10 2015 UTC,"Lol, if Ross played in SL right now he would score like 30+ a game. I mean he did have that 51 point game vs LAC seasons ago and that is an actual NBA game."
torontoraptors,3d2eur,bballi,2,Mon Jul 13 04:19:22 2015 UTC,The problem is he's thriving on mid range jumpers and hes getting wide open cause SL.  If this was against NBA competition most of his shots are contested mid-rangers which are the worst kind of shot. Still happy he's hitting them though and LOVE the defense. I definitely think we will see him this season and I could see him finding success
torontoraptors,3d2eur,superiorfox,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:20:54 2015 UTC,"Not out of the question, but there's going to be a lot of competition. Smart looks fantastic, and Mudiay just had a great game too, just to name a couple others."
torontoraptors,3d2eur,Hiya_tiger,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:54:14 2015 UTC,Pretty sure the league is high on Stanley Johnson. He hasn't broken into the Top10 on NBA.com so far... but there are games left to play.
torontoraptors,3d35sy,simple7on,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:47:25 2015 UTC,"He'll be in the league for sure.  Works hard, is self aware and is a two way player.  Reminds me a lot of JR but without the off court shit."
torontoraptors,3d2j4h,benhan23,11,Mon Jul 13 00:28:21 2015 UTC,"Tough break for DeAndre, no pun intended.  He breaks his foot and the guy starting in his place on the Summer League squad just signed a partially guaranteed deal.  Hope DeAndre gets well and that Ronald Roberts takes advantage of this opportunity."

torontoraptors,3d2j4h,IKetchBodies,5,Mon Jul 13 05:05:10 2015 UTC,"Coming over in peace from the Knicks board. Went to St. Joe's with Ron.  First off he's a great, funny dude and everyone on campus pretty much loved him. Based on his personal experiences with females him and Aubrey are going to get along just fine haha.   Now to basketball. Ron is an insane athlete. Just look at some of his highlight reel dunks in college. He was a double double machine his senior year. He's tenacious on the offensive boards and has potential to be a really good help defender. I think he can become a poor man's Tristan Thompson.  He improved every year of school and I don't see that stopping. If he can develop a jumper he can be a very serviceable bench piece for any NBA team. You guys got a good diamond in the rough."

torontoraptors,3d1dl8,TxksDQZN,3,Sun Jul 12 22:22:59 2015 UTC,I know Casey said he wants Ross to come off the bench in the Lou role but I'm convinced Powell's gonna take it away from Ross.

torontoraptors,3d1dl8,imdahman,5,Sun Jul 12 23:52:38 2015 UTC,To think that we got Powell and a first round pick out of Vasquez. Bucks got fleeced for sure.

torontoraptors,3d1dl8,Luciious,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:55:13 2015 UTC,We drafted him. We gotta sign Roberts
torontoraptors,3d1dl8,ModernPoultry,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:13:00 2015 UTC,don't they still have to sign him to a contract before hes on the roster though?
torontoraptors,3d1dl8,Luciious,2,Mon Jul 13 00:36:21 2015 UTC,when you draft someone you hold their rights for 4 years and if Im not mistaken he already signed his rookie contract. So we at least have him locked down where as this Roberts guy as far as Im aware is just here on a tryout

Bebe's a great kid, I feel like the staff is mismanaging him.  If TRoss got an arm around him from Casey, Bebe's getting the shove away."
torontoraptors,3d35wj,jyh123,2,Mon Jul 13 13:39:52 2015 UTC,"yeah, those Bruno questions were cool last year but Bruno himself has improved his english a ton - why not ask the man himself?  Or if it's another perspective they want, ask the coaching staff or other players who work out with him.  Bebe literally can't go one interview without getting asked a Bruno question."
torontoraptors,3d35wj,creepypaster,2,Mon Jul 13 17:53:16 2015 UTC,May I ask why this is being downvoted? Do people just really not like bebe lol
torontoraptors,3d0klj,dfsaqwe,12,Sun Jul 12 14:26:33 2015 UTC,"If he plays like last season, just let him go."
torontoraptors,3d0klj,_amplitude_,10,Sun Jul 12 14:54:49 2015 UTC,I wouldn't. You can draft players like him towards the end of the first round in most drafts. Ross isn't important to the short or long term success of the Raptors.
torontoraptors,3d0klj,Qwyjibo_,3,Sun Jul 12 14:33:55 2015 UTC,Throw him a one year deal like the Leafs did with Kadri. Make him prove he's worth a long term deal and if not then pack your bags. Let him seal his own destiny.
torontoraptors,3d0klj,absolutkaos,15,Sun Jul 12 17:42:05 2015 UTC,Unlike few others I am pumped to see what he can do off the bench where other guys cannot play offense real well and he'll be primary threat. Expect him to be Lou Will without the stupid ISO plays and deep ass three points with 21 seconds on the clock. If he goes back to driving look out.
torontoraptors,3d0klj,Togonnagetsomerando,33,Sun Jul 12 14:52:38 2015 UTC,Lou would have as many FT attempts in a game as Ross would have in a month. Ross does only one thing at an above average level (hit threes created for him by others).   How quickly people forget that Lou had a good year last year. I'd be shocked if Ross ever reaches that level.
torontoraptors,3d0klj,Qwyjibo_,2,Sun Jul 12 15:10:10 2015 UTC,"Spot up threes created by others...that's one of the things that Demarre does, and he's one of the best in the league at  it. No real need for Ross to be filling that need any more.  Ross needs to be slashing and driving, and hitting a mid-range pull-up. He just need the aggressiveness to get into the paint and take his licks from the big boys."
torontoraptors,3d0klj,absolutkaos,2,Sun Jul 12 17:38:11 2015 UTC,"Except demarre can actually defend well, and not just 2 seasons ago like tross.  Demarre is also a great finisher"
torontoraptors,3d0klj,RetartedMooseGas,2,Sun Jul 12 21:50:18 2015 UTC,Ross is still young. He has potential to be a Lou in a few years if he decides to grow a pair.
torontoraptors,3d0klj,Zeitgeis1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:17:07 2015 UTC,"I agree that he doesn't get to the line enough, but the guy scored 50 points in an NBA game, give him a little credit. He might not be as good as Lou was but he definitely has the skills and ability to put up points. If we get 13-16 off the bench from him I'd call it a success."

torontoraptors,3d0klj,Jhah41,12,Thu Jul 16 00:17:46 2015 UTC,"Lou playing ISO is 99.9% on Casey.  He came in won us a few games hit a few buzzer beater 3s and Casey went ""well lets let him do this for the rest of the season"".   76ers Lou was no where near this ISO and was a willing passer.  Casey has absolutely NO clue how to run an offence despite us being really good on that end."
torontoraptors,3d0klj,SuminderJi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:24:01 2015 UTC,So what does he know how to do? Defence? Lol   Casey I mean
torontoraptors,3d0klj,Zeitgeis1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:17:47 2015 UTC,Lou's game throughout his career has been highly dependent  on playing ISO so i wouldnt say 99.9% is on Casey.
torontoraptors,3d0klj,This_is_what_you_ge,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:56:29 2015 UTC,"Lou Williams is fucking good and we'll miss his offense off the bench next season. I put most of the struggles in terms of ""iso"" ball and defense on the fact he was paired with GV the past season. GV decided he wanted to go from being a playmaking PG to a worse version of Lou while continuing to be bad at defense. Both of them on the court together is what hurt us."
torontoraptors,3d0klj,coolassninjas,2,Mon Jul 13 01:44:08 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think the raps will run a much more fluid offense this season, actually running sets instead of Iso ball, and I could see Ross flourish in that type of environment. Running off double picks for an open 15-fter. I'm betting the follow Atlantas lead and really try to move with and without the ball."
torontoraptors,3d0klj,jaimonee,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:08:30 2015 UTC,They have to. Last year they were one of the worst in the league for assists and assist differential. They have to start playing more team ball and relying less on the individual efforts.

You see Brewer getting $8mil/year, Green getting the minimum, Matthews getting the max, and Weems getting $3mil/year. Where does Ross fall on that scale? Personally, I wouldn't want to pay a streaky back-up SG more than $6.5mil/year, but he's probably looking for a big payday."

torontoraptors,3d0klj,UnsolvedParadox,3,Sun Jul 12 17:32:28 2015 UTC,"Green's got some good playing time in Phoenix the last couple years, but I think he took a little step back last season. I assume he's taking a ""prove it"" deal and will look to cash in next summer. Plus Pat Riley probably pulled some Godfather shit and made Green sign his contract. I'm really curious to see how Weems' game has developed after spending a few seasons in Europe."
torontoraptors,3d0klj,kashman23,2,Sun Jul 12 17:38:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I'm just surprised that his ""prove it"" deal wasn't for more than the minimum (even to join the Heat)."

torontoraptors,3cy6o3,locdogjr,12,Sun Jul 12 02:26:45 2015 UTC,"Let's not forget Tim Leiweke too.  He's the one that pried Masai away from the Nuggets, after Ujiri had already verbally agreed to return to the Nuggets, remember!  Leiweke didn't balk at the idea of things that Masai was asking for during the interview process such as a new practice facility and a d league team even though it would cost traditionally stingy MLSE an extra $35+million with no immediate benefits.  Tim knows that if you want to compete with best franchises in world, you have to spend and he has across the board from the Leafs, TFC, and the Raptors.  He's hired quality people in upper management and has let them do their thing while provided plenty of support.  Tim Leiweke has done amazing things for sports in Toronto in such a short time and brought some much needed respect to MLSE.  He's trying to change them from simply a money making property to a real legit sports entity that's focused winning and success.  It was sad to hear that he was leaving but I'm glad to know that he'll be sticking around a little longer.    I believe in Masai and Tim Leiweke."

torontoraptors,3cy6o3,ParadiseCity1995,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:57:09 2015 UTC,"The Nuggets anticipated that Ujiri would stay with them because of his strong relationship with Kroenke. The duo had an agreement in principle to a contract extension heading into this past season, but no contract was signed.    ...   When the Raptors came calling and offered huge money the Nuggets were unwilling to match, it left Ujiri with the opportunity to make his mark in a new city with an old friend, Raptors executive Bryan Colangelo.   http://www.denverpost.com/ci_23363815/masai-ujiri-leaves-nuggets-take-job-toronto-gm  I wouldn't exactly call 5 years $15mil huge money but apparently the Nuggets have a history of cheaping out on front office people.  On the other hand, MLSE did agree to get a new $30 million state-of-the-art practice facility and a d league team so maybe that was part of the deal.

Caboclo is way bigger than he was last year at this time. He was lanky, now he's got some muscle. He doesn't look as lost on the court as he did last year. He got mixed up a couple times on defense but his court awareness has improved and I liked seeing him attack the glass for rebounds on the defensive end. On offense he was more assertive. Taking the first basket coast to coast and finishing the and-1 is something I wouldn't have expected to see him do last year. And the stroke. He looks WAY more confident with his shot. The catch and shoot from the free-throw line area was the one that stood out for me because that wasn't just an ""I'm open let me catch and shoot it"". He took that ball and hit a tough turn around fade and that kind of a shot is an ""I'm confident I can do this all day"" type of shot, and that's a real positive to see."

torontoraptors,3d2hy2,Napkin-Man,-4,Mon Jul 13 14:02:22 2015 UTC,Get rid of Ross and let Powell ease into the scorer off the bench.
torontoraptors,3d2hy2,Life_Of_High,3,Mon Jul 13 00:38:08 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, Ross is 1/2 of our 3-point shooting."
torontoraptors,3cy9vk,thatdudecalledZZ,5,Sat Jul 11 21:37:59 2015 UTC,"This guy is playing like how we want Ross to play. However this is still summer league, gotta see if he can crack the line up and how he fares against actual NBA players."
torontoraptors,3cy9vk,tenrenn,3,Sat Jul 11 22:24:23 2015 UTC,lack of size is kinda his only issue. He's short even for SG. Loved what I saw from him. Could be 3rd string SG behind Demar and Ross. Who knows maybe even compete with Ross for minutes.. Could be a steal. Let's hope so at least
torontoraptors,3cy9vk,karedogino,3,Sun Jul 12 00:32:52 2015 UTC,"He's a little short for a SG (6'4"") but he has a huge wingspan (6'11"") and a really good vertical leap (40"").  I could see Powell eventually fit into that bench scorer role like Lou but he can actually guard as well.  He looks like a steal at this point but only time will tell."
torontoraptors,3cy9vk,Dammit81,2,Sun Jul 12 07:09:33 2015 UTC,His playstyle kind of reminds me of Derozan when we drafted him back in 09. He was crazy athletic without a consistent jumper. Hopefully this guy develops similarly as DD.
torontoraptors,3cy9vk,AssHat_McGee_,7,Sat Jul 11 22:05:11 2015 UTC,I'd rather he keep on attacking the basket than fall in love with contested jumpers
torontoraptors,3cy9vk,dansupreme,5,Sat Jul 11 23:10:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I kinda phrased that poorly lol, I mean develop at the same rate, not necessarily settle for midrange jumpers most of the game.  Derozan really puts in work in the gym."

I honestly can't tell why he dropped to 46. He's not devoid of tangible offensive talent (kind of poor man's D-Wade type game and he's also been working on a jumpshot), and he's got a hard-nosed defensive mentality. I would've pegged him as no more than a late 1st rounder considering his age and his college career. He has a crazy 40.5"" vertical too so I'm hoping he gets some run just to see him in the dunk contest to keep our tradition alive, I mean seriously, check this shit out."

torontoraptors,3cuohj,4orty2wo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:39:21 2015 UTC,Hmm i disagree. Don't forget playing good defense also gets you easy points through turnovers. Last season we had one of the best scoring 2nd units in the league and what did that get us? A nice round 1 playoffs sweep!! I honestly think Ross will have a nice bounce back year. He doesn't have as much pressure on him this year and his role is clearer then ever imo. I think he is the healthiest hes been since draft night and will begin to shoot with more confidence. We don't need our 2nd unit to go out and score mad buckets every night. We just need them to play smart basketball by holding leads or keeping us in the game when its close. This would be the ideal lineup when our starters are on the bench:  CoJo/Wright  T. Ross  JJ  PP  Biyombo/Scola   I am pretty happy with this 2nd unit. We have a nice balance of scoring and D. Good variations possible if we want to put out a small ball lineup with Wright at PG and Cojo at SG. How much of Bruno do we see this season with the raps? I would put money on Bebe playing with the Raps more this season.
torontoraptors,3cuohj,KillerCronic,2,Sat Jul 11 21:39:53 2015 UTC,I assume we'll see the brazilians only really at home games and against weaker teams.

torontoraptors,3cuohj,KillerCronic,2,Fri Jul 10 23:40:23 2015 UTC,I think this means that either Scola is starting or that they're working on something to get a starting 4 (at which Casey wasn't at at liberty to discuss). Personally I hope it's the latter.  Masai even mentioned in a recent interview that the Raps have 4 first rounders in the the next 2 drafts and don't intend on keeping them all.

As for buying his jersey they probs won't make them available until they reveal the new raptor jersey which we don't know when that will be at this moment
torontoraptors,3crx6y,queryquest,19,Fri Jul 10 07:41:09 2015 UTC,I loved hearing him say two things:  1) Casey prefers Patterson coming off the bench and providing that spark that the second unit needs on the offensive end. I agree 100%  2) Wants to use James Johnson at the 4 more and have him guard opposing power forwards. The fact that he is mentioning using Johnson at all is a miracle.
torontoraptors,3crx6y,DaveyBaby27,4,Fri Jul 10 08:23:11 2015 UTC,"CASEY SAYING GOOD THINGS ABOUT JAMES.    Actually it makes sense, I don't think he was actually in the doghouse last year, there were numoerous interviews where he admitted to not knowing the plays for the PF position."

torontoraptors,3crx6y,CallMeDoc24,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:06:02 2015 UTC,I'm struggling to see what changed Casey's mind. He was so adamant about not playing JJ last year. Did they have a heart to heart talk after the season? Has JJ improved and listened to what Casey wanted him to work on?    I'm just a little curious. What prompted this change in tune.
torontoraptors,3crx6y,BlueBlurDown,2,Fri Jul 10 15:48:47 2015 UTC,some offensive structure would be nice pls
torontoraptors,3crx6y,Mkdeezy3,-2,Fri Jul 10 15:36:04 2015 UTC,It sounds like Scola and possibly even Biyombo might be potentially traded. Anyone else get this feeling from Casey's wording? He seemed to dodge around discussing those two in Raptor's Uniforms.
torontoraptors,3crx6y,DaveyBaby27,5,Fri Jul 10 07:46:14 2015 UTC,"Naw, biyombo literally just signed lol  He did say that some things are going to be happening in the next few days so we'll just need to adopt a wait and see approach"

Watching him play you could see his weaknesses. Uncertainty, lackadaisical movement on defense. Dude was just out of his element physically and didn't seem to have an acceptable Basketball IQ.   I know he's a work in progress but he was picked up for the potential in his body and his ability to mismatch people with size and length. He doesn't do that at all yet."
torontoraptors,3cpoxn,locdogjr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:50:21 2015 UTC,"The IQ thing is real with him! Let's hope lots of time with the 905ers will help him a lot.

torontoraptors,3cpoxn,DrKevorkean,6,Fri Jul 10 03:04:09 2015 UTC,"It's there. You can see how and why he would be a fantastic player, he just can't put it all together. I am a firm believer in the fact that comfort is the most important thing for an athlete. And everything that comes with it.  He is uncomfortable in his situation for so many different reasons.   Being from Brazil myself I know how truly foreign this must be for a young kid from a not so well off family. The world he's living in now is completely different than what he was used to. No one coddles potential NBA players in Brazil. He was literally a no one to a guy expected to be similar to the best pure scorer of our generation. That scared him. He's probably still really intimidated. Here's to hoping he can work it out before people declare his chance is up.   But to be a bit negative: he comes off as a bit over-dramatic and lacking the ability to recognize your amazing situation and be strong about it. Kinda like he wants people to feel bad for him. You need to get rid of that to make it in sports if you're not a world talent."

He was  heavily involved in the recruitment process for our FA pitches with fellow wings Wes and Carroll so I doubt he was actually being shopped.  Most likely a conclusion to the rumors he wanted a max eventually.  edit: I'll play along though - considering how much Ainge reportedly offered Charlotte on draft night - Marcus Smart, a first rounder (or two) and your best young big."

Hes now free to flourish offensively at sg without the burden of maning up on much bigger small forwards"
torontoraptors,3csybe,cook_mons4,3,Fri Jul 10 15:16:22 2015 UTC,"The only thing that scares me, is this: Ive been wondering for weeks, but reports are that Demar will ask for the max. If the raps give him the max next yr, how does that effect our cap and how much will we have if we want to make a big splash. In addition, say we offer him 15 mil/yr, I can see a boneheaded team like the Lakers offering the max and we lose him"
torontoraptors,3csybe,homer62,5,Fri Jul 10 15:22:37 2015 UTC,DD will get the max after watching this crazy off season play out. Teams can have three max players and a bunch of decent mid levels all over so why not heap it on DD.  Its a good time to be a baller....
torontoraptors,3csybe,cook_mons4,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:57:49 2015 UTC,I wonder how much $ we'll have if we do max DD out left for signing anyone else. JV salary is about to go way up too
torontoraptors,3csybe,Toront06,2,Fri Jul 10 19:30:22 2015 UTC,I say offer him 15-17 mill or let him leave. There's no way this guy is worth 25 mill.   Also whats with the Knicks flair?
torontoraptors,3csybe,cook_mons4,2,Fri Jul 10 17:28:45 2015 UTC,"the knicks thing is just to screw with people. I think even knicks fans are embarrassed to be knicks fans.   Yeah, 15-17 is fair, but 25 is way too much, and the thing is, you know a team will offer this. The thing that really scares me, is that its hard enough to recruit guys to come here and he already likes it and content on being here for his career. Just as a human if someone offers me an extra 10 mil, i take it, its hard to turn down, and then what? How do we replace that?"
torontoraptors,3csybe,JeahNotSlice,4,Fri Jul 10 17:35:25 2015 UTC,"Three or four teams will clear max room for durrant or whoever is available next year  and then some loser GM who doesn't get a top level guy will be forced to overpay for the B team.  The only way D stays for less than max is if he gets a better than decent offer from Massai, AND the raps can do enough this year to make a championship run in 2017/18 or there a outs a real possibility."
torontoraptors,3csybe,xC6H1206x,2,Fri Jul 10 17:53:21 2015 UTC,"Smart looking ahead. So true. Teams will be amped for next years thinning crop (was supposed to have AD and lillard) and new salary cap and those who don't make a splash will throw that money at somebody, otherwise it's wasted space."
torontoraptors,3csybe,xC6H1206x,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:22:57 2015 UTC,Inside word from friend in organization is the team doesn't think he's a max player. If he gets a max deal we will not match.

If he manages to get a consistent 3 pt shot together for the season, then perhaps, but I just dont see it otherwise."
torontoraptors,3csybe,CallMeDoc24,5,Sat Jul 11 14:42:09 2015 UTC,"We're not giving up DeMar any time soon, especially for the players/assets you named. He's only 25 and is the face of the franchise--hopefully he can go the next level (along with other key players like JV) and make this team a contender."
torontoraptors,3csybe,Thimble,3,Fri Jul 10 15:45:48 2015 UTC,"There's no way because it would tarnish Masai's rep among the players in the league.  DD's been helping with the recruiting and to turn around and trade him after making use of DD's ""juice"" would be like a slap in the face."
torontoraptors,3csybe,Human_Traffic_Cone,3,Fri Jul 10 15:29:51 2015 UTC,I think it would take an irrationally high return for Masai to pull that trigger because of what Derozan means as the longest tenured raptor. Smart would almost have to be in the deal.

I'd take Smart, and something else too. Maybe a pick, maybe Olnyk. I'd also try to off load Lowry somewhere else if that was the plan."
torontoraptors,3csybe,KissFromARozan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:27:27 2015 UTC,We've invested so much in Demar its seriously hard to come up with a good trade since he's been around for so long. To be honest.. I don't think there's anyone on the Celtics I'd want. We're clearly not rebuilding right now so draft picks aren't really something we'd be making a push for at the moment.   We want to get out of the first round of the playoffs. Getting rid of DD for someone lesser then him is just taking a step backwards. We've watched him grow into one of the best SGs in the league.
torontoraptors,3csybe,tuckeee,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:30:41 2015 UTC,trading one of our star players within the same division!? Hardly likely.

torontoraptors,3csybe,tangowhiskey33,2,Sat Jul 11 12:24:07 2015 UTC,"Yes I love Smart, he gets a ton of undeserved hate from  /r/nba for some reason, but he's a phenomenal young player. He has outstanding defense, and now that his ankle is fully healed, he is able to play way better than last year. He now feels fine shooting since his recovery and he will do really well this season. I feel like he will be an all star consistently in a year or so, and his ceiling is probably star level if he can begin to shoot like I know he can."
torontoraptors,3csybe,homer62,0,Sat Jul 11 16:53:37 2015 UTC,"Before we got Carroll, Biyombo, Joseph, Scola, I would've been okay if they went full tank mode and traded Derozan for Smart, Olynyk + 2 Firsts"

torontoraptors,3cqnv6,RetartedMooseGas,2,Fri Jul 10 01:48:53 2015 UTC,You could tell he was frustrated though. We all remember the meetings he and Casey would have discussing his inconsistent PT and his role as the season progressed.

torontoraptors,3cqnv6,RetartedMooseGas,2,Fri Jul 10 03:28:01 2015 UTC,"We don't? It was pretty infamous...It was when Dwane Casey called our best on-ball defender ""undisciplined"" on defense when he was the only one who could stay in front of his man. Doesn't ring a bell?"

torontoraptors,3cqnv6,king_lloyd11,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:56:50 2015 UTC,I don't think last season could be considered butting heads. I think the popular opinion of the fans clashed with casey more than JJ did. All we know from that is they had a meeting to reevaluate things and to point out where JJ could improve. Especially when you compare that to his first stint here where he was incredibly immature. JJ doesn't show that he is pissed off at management and reports haven't indicated that either.
torontoraptors,3cqnv6,RetartedMooseGas,2,Fri Jul 10 04:59:03 2015 UTC,"There was frustrations from JJ which was fueled by media and fan speculation that triggered the sit down.

torontoraptors,3cniru,dealin92,9,Thu Jul 9 07:42:25 2015 UTC,unless were doing a trade which will eat up that cap lets bring back the chuck wagon
torontoraptors,3cniru,JDver2,8,Thu Jul 9 13:22:11 2015 UTC,My question is who do the raps get with roughly $2.7 million in cap space. I still think Masai has another masterpiece trade coming through. He has a few assets left in terms of draft picks bundled with a player I think he has a move left to make. But maybe he decides to hold off on the trade to see how our draft picks turn out. We have a 1st round 2016(worst pick of den/ny) and another 1st in 2017. Truth of the matter is that we still have a problem with the PF position. Masai did a band-aid type of deal with Scola for 1 year not much risk. That Taj Gibson trade is sounding stellar right about now.
torontoraptors,3cniru,kushblazers,4,Thu Jul 9 13:07:16 2015 UTC,Actually 4.5 since CoJo's contract is back loaded but yeah one more move would feel pretty good. Dirk might be available :p
torontoraptors,3cniru,JoRo_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:42:10 2015 UTC,Haha Dirk pipe dream count me in!! Being serious though if Masai wants to maximize the value of his 1st round picks I don't see him making a trade until half way through the season at least. Makes the most sense because he will want to wait to see how bad the nuggets and knicks are this season. But I am sure a lot of teams wouldnt think twice about accepting two 1st round picks packaged with one player TRoss or James Johnson. If I had to part ways with one of those players it would probably be JJ. Ross can hit the 3 and we will need that spacing in our 2nd unit. Would the bulls do Taj Gibson for two 1st round picks and James Johnson? You could potentially offer the same deal to the Celtics for Kelly Olynyk?
torontoraptors,3cniru,kushblazers,0,Thu Jul 9 18:08:43 2015 UTC,I think two and player* is a over pay for any of the guys available. Especially the enviable lottery pick.

torontoraptors,3cniru,JoRo_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:32:42 2015 UTC,We can get Terrence Jones' contract of 2.4 million in a trade to stay under cap but I have no idea what we'd give them. I think we still need to hang on to Ross.   I wonder if packaging two second round picks along with one of our own first round picks (which will be at the 20ish spot) or the Clippers' top 14 protected pick would be able to net us TJones? Those two non-lottery first round picks wouldn't amount to much anyways and we'd still be well off with the lottery pick from Denver/New York.
torontoraptors,3cniru,hadlari,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:00:03 2015 UTC,I would put up Terrence Ross and a second in a second for Terrence Jones. Houston i doubt would take it.   What ever the case. the two should never be on the same team.   There can only be one.
torontoraptors,3cniru,scarfox1,2,Fri Jul 10 13:21:13 2015 UTC,"Just a noob question, if the the salary cap is 70 mil, and the luxury tax threshold is 84 mil, what goes on between those numbers? What happens if you go up to 83.9 mil?"
torontoraptors,3cniru,SpaghettoSwagu,3,Thu Jul 9 16:41:07 2015 UTC,"Simply put, teams over the cap lose financial privileges that teams under the cap have. Once you go above the cap, the only way you can sign more players is by using one of the NBA's salary cap exceptions.   So to answer your question, nothing really happens, but once you exceed the cap the NBA really handcuffs how you're allowed to spend your money. Also, teams below the cap get a cut of the luxury tax paid by teams above the threshold."

Dude, if you really want to support this cause, spend 5k (which is 0.001% of his yearly salary) at the minimum and get about 100 new suits, as well as your old suits if you must. Btw his suits are probably all worn out from all that sideline jumping around.   I really don't get the point of this cause in the first place. Someone who does not have a suit, or cannot afford one is usually not going for a job that requires a suit. I prefer give clothes/money to people who don't have it at all."

Do you think Casey buys $50 suits? Do you think Casey should seek out $50 suits to donate with his collection? Do you not see how buying cheap-ass polyester suits would be perceived if he donated them with his clothes to a charity like this?   And yeah, I'll stick to my guns here and say that most people don't buy $50 suits, and that a $50 suit would be pretty damn hard to find outside of somewhere like Goodwill or Value Village anyway.

torontoraptors,3cn405,DaveyBaby27,3,Thu Jul 9 04:50:09 2015 UTC,"Not entirely sure why you left out Bruno and Bebe, maybe because they'll mostly be in Mississauga? Not consistent if that's the case because Wright could spend a fair amount of time there too, and Daniels isn't signed, that was Hazard reporting. I think we'll sign Powell for the minimum contract considering how little we have left to spend, and he has scrappy NBA-ready defence for shooting guard depth. Might look to sign Daniels for the minimum as well although that would be too much green on our roster, and it's possible we could use Ridnour as a cheap trade piece for 1 more player before we have to waive him.  PG: Lowry, Joseph, Wright  SG: DeRozan, Ross, (Powell)  SF: Carroll, Johnson, Caboclo, (Daniels)  PF: Patterson, Scola  C: Valanciunas, Biyombo, Nogueira"

torontoraptors,3cn405,kushblazers,6,Thu Jul 9 05:10:38 2015 UTC,Can't wait to see how Bruno plays this Friday in Vegas. With the money leftover it made sense signing Scola. But I kind of wish we drafted a PF instead of a PG. I am extremely happy with Wright though so not complaining. Maybe Masai will make a trade later into the season.
torontoraptors,3cn405,Ovoxo88,8,Thu Jul 9 06:36:50 2015 UTC,"According to that draft douche, he's now technically 1 year away from being 2 years away. I really believe Bruno will be something special in this league. It's great that he can play for the 905 Raptors this year."
torontoraptors,3cn405,kushblazers,3,Thu Jul 9 06:42:28 2015 UTC,People who live in Toronto are lucky you get so many sporting events to watch not like out here in Van. I think how Bruno plays this summer will determine if he stays in the NBA. I imagine he will spend another year in the D league with a few stints with the Raptors along the way. But I agree too I think Bruno has the tools to be a special player. From what I have read his work ethic is crazy. I don't really need to listen to his interviews or understand much of what he is saying but you can tell by the look in his eyes all the passion he has.
torontoraptors,3cn405,Pistol-P,3,Thu Jul 9 13:04:03 2015 UTC,"Really don't think this is the year that decides Bruno's fate, he has so much potential with his length and athleticism.

torontoraptors,3cn405,Pistol-P,3,Thu Jul 9 17:33:53 2015 UTC,"Barring a big trade, which is always very possible with masai behind the wheel, I could see the raps running with this roster. They have 5 solid guards that I expect to see alot of different combinations of, especially with small ball running line ups like Lowry/Wright, Cojo, DD/Ross, Carroll, and PPat/Val/Scola.  This roster seems to have alot of flexibility with guys who can play multiple positions, itll be interesting to see what Casey does with it. I really like the idea of T-Ross filling in lou's role of the first scorer off the bench. I hope to see him playing along side a Carroll some, where he isnt expected to guard their #1 perimiter guy. Hoping a focus on offense will get him back on track. (more 50 point games plz lol)  Up front I hope this lineup would mean heavier minutes for Val, with PPat stretching the floor for him, something Amir struggled with IMO. And the backup bigs are solid with Biyombo being a great rim protector who won't force shots, and Scola who can stretch the floor and is a smart veteran and decent defender.  Plus if Bruno and Bebe aren't total liabilities out there like last year, (love bruno but he was a mess last year) they can be called up for VERY light minutes if needed due to injuries.   All in all I would be very excited if the raps start this season with this roster, but I'm sure Masai has more tricks up his sleeve. Giving Patterson the chance to prove himself as a starting 4 in the league might be what he needs to break out, he showed glimpses of being a stellar pick and pop guy last year."
torontoraptors,3cn405,RetartedMooseGas,2,Thu Jul 9 13:26:33 2015 UTC,"Depends how fluid you think the lineup will be. Personally, I hope we have a fair bit of time allotted to both Demarre and JJ at the backup 4. I'd prefer scola as our 3rd C to be honest. Doubt that happens, but that's just me. I can see lineups where CoJo and Lowry are together as well."
torontoraptors,3cn405,Ovoxo88,2,Thu Jul 9 05:29:26 2015 UTC,"Only via trade. We spent 3/4 mil we had left....I'm curious to see how well this team plays defence next year. If every raptor improves, which they all should, I believe we will have a good season. Hopefully make it past first round. I don't wanna have my expectations too high."
torontoraptors,3cn405,karedogino,2,Thu Jul 9 06:39:38 2015 UTC,"PG: Lowry, Joseph, Wright SG: DeRozan, Ross, (Powell)  SF: Carroll, Johnson, Daniels, Bruno PF: Patterson, Scola, (Hansborough)  C: Valanciunas, Biyombo, Bebe  It's simple really. All depends how much Casey wants JJ and Carroll to play stretch 4. If that's in the plan, then if the coaches are happy with Powell, we just sign him. If Powell isn't ready and Casey doesn't wanna put JJ or Carroll at PF, we stash Powell and sign 1 more rebounding PF with ridnour's salary, like Psycho T. Cuz Scola is 35, and the season is long."
torontoraptors,3cn405,benhan23,3,Thu Jul 9 11:52:55 2015 UTC,JJ can't play stretch 4 because he has no stretch game to speak of.
torontoraptors,3cn405,karedogino,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:32:27 2015 UTC,hmm true. I wish he could. Hopefully he worked/is working on his 3 this summer
torontoraptors,3cn405,dragonsky,2,Thu Jul 9 14:10:22 2015 UTC,"Another big man PF will be great.  DeRozan must shine this season, I expect him to finally show his worth.  Valanciunas also has potential and if he uses it...well we're definitelly a top5 team in the east."
torontoraptors,3cn405,king_lloyd11,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:17:01 2015 UTC,"Personally, I want Masai to trade Ross for Gerald Henderson. They have similar contracts iirc, and the Blazers will be looking for young pieces to build around now that they're probably going into mini tank mode after losing 3 starters.   edit: the trade would work if we threw in the expendable and expiring contract of Ridnour as well. Make it happen, Masai."
torontoraptors,3cn405,jyh123,0,Thu Jul 9 09:45:52 2015 UTC,"a team is allowed 15 players under contract, so with Bebe + Bruno we're up to 14.  One spot left for the summer league hopefuls (Daniels or Powell likely)  its more likely Ross is backup SF, JJ gets buried on the bench again unless he gains the 3-ball this summer, in which case Masai should probably just get rid of him or Casey (it seems having both is not possible)  Casey will again run the team w/ Lowry/DD or 2 PGs, or his patented 3 guard all ISO lineups.  So 4 guards (Lowry/Joseph/Wright/DD) sound about right.  Scola will get the most minutes of bigs (he's a vet, again a Casey thing) and JV will have Biyombo riding the pine with him while we go small with 2Pat and Scola.  overall team looks good on paper, better D, but same Casey.  some analytics experts say coaching doesn't matter except for time management/allocation to productive players (Pops and Phil being exceptions).  Let's see if the new players can make Casey look good (or conversely, whether there is such a thing as anti-Pops)"

torontoraptors,3cmyb9,creepypaster,7,Thu Jul 9 04:02:38 2015 UTC,"putting my tinfoil hat on  ahem  Thanks to DJ, Cuban will now force the Mavs to get into tank mode.  Unless they use their cap space to trade for Deron Williams, they won't have a competitive roster being in such a hellish division and conference.  Even if they did, he would need to return to his Utah form to bring the Mavs to the playoffs.   Raptors are in desperate need for a PF, even with the Scola signing - as well as a veteran player with championship experience.  Why not kill two birds with one stone and trade for German GOAT Dirk Nowitzki?  He spends his twilight years going on playoff runs with us, playing a position of need and mentoring our young guys, and gets reunited with Casey - who knows how to hide him on defense.  When Dirk is on his last year, we trade him back to the Mavs or he just re-signs there to retire a Maverick.  A storybook ending for all.  edit: Roster to better visualize this soon-to-be-true scenario  PG - Lowry /Co JO / D. wright  SG - Derozan / Ross  SF - D. Carroll / J.

torontoraptors,3cmyb9,JoRo_,3,Thu Jul 9 20:32:00 2015 UTC,Would gladly trade Ross and a first for Carlisle. He's that good.
torontoraptors,3cmyb9,xC6H1206x,2,Fri Jul 10 03:06:46 2015 UTC,We're basically giving away Ross and a first in this sub though.
torontoraptors,3cmyb9,Ali812,0,Thu Jul 9 04:48:18 2015 UTC,I had the same thought. Perfect coach for us but I'm very happy we didn't sign Matthews. That would mean no Joseph   Offer em that Babcock $$$$
torontoraptors,3clet3,kushblazers,14,Wed Jul 8 20:37:15 2015 UTC,"Intrigued is the perfect word. I am certainly intrigued by the moves we made thus far. I think our biggest move so far has been Cory Joseph.    Let's get it out of the way, he's Canadian, but that's just a bonus. His experience with the Spurs is massive. He learnt from the best coach in the league, possibly the best coach of all time. He played with and learn from Duncan, Parker and Ginobili. He has experience filling in for Parker and doing a great job. Best of all? He's serious. When he wasn't getting minutes and just sitting on the bench he asked Pop to send him to the D-League. He knew sitting on the bench wasn't good for him. He didn't let his ego get in the way and asked to be sent down. I love it.    Speaking about Joseph more as a player, his defence is going to be huge for us. Casey loved using two guards last year and Joseph will be a much better fit. As much as I loved GV, having both him and Lowry on the floor meant our defence suffered. Having Lowry and Joseph won't hurt us defensively.    Of course, I'm also intrigued to see how Carroll does. Can he play in a system outside of Atlanta's? Our system is very different than Atlanta's. We played a lot of ISO last year. If we keep the same system, how will that affect Carroll who benefited from the open shots he got. I'm confident he will do well, but again, it's intriguing as it's not guaranteed."
torontoraptors,3clet3,alamarco,2,Wed Jul 8 22:32:58 2015 UTC,"I hope we move away from the ISO and get back to the kind of ball we were playing in the early parts of last season. Good quick ball movement and team D. If that happens, Carroll should have no problems"
torontoraptors,3clet3,mac247ca,3,Thu Jul 9 15:55:49 2015 UTC,We know that JYD2.0 wil be playing both the 3 and 4 next season. I still think Masai has 1 or 2 moves left before we get the final roster. We need a PF that will fit our system at a price that we can afford. Right now I think Masai has about $4 million to spend and some draft picks or personnel to trade. JV and PP paired together leave us with a bit of a defensive liability. It will take some time for the Raptors to build that chemistry. But ya I agree I am super happy with the new additions. We no longer have any issues with our guards and defense. If we can get a starting 4 our 2nd unit would be pretty intense:  CoJo(Delonte Wright)  TRoss  JJ  PP  Biyombo  I am already drooling at the thought of throwing in Bruno with our 2nd unit. But I know he needs another year of development.
torontoraptors,3clet3,BOOOOOMSHAKALAKA,2,Wed Jul 8 22:57:07 2015 UTC,"I think we actually have near 7 mill, possibly more, cap was released today, 70 mill, was originally projected at 67 mill.  Also, CoJo is only 5 mill off the cap this year, and not 7.5 (the average of his contract).  I expect Daniel Hackett @ RHQ to do an update on our cap situation very soon as he's been doing for the past few weeks."
torontoraptors,3clob6,DaveyBaby27,16,Wed Jul 8 21:45:10 2015 UTC,"he used to be quick before he came to nba. then you guys just fed him hamburgers and made him lift like a monster.dont think he became a better player. I just hope now that he's big enough, he can get his quickness and speed back. I feel good things are coming for him this year. Im saying he wins most improved player of the year, you heard it here first."
torontoraptors,3clob6,karedogino,13,Wed Jul 8 22:40:43 2015 UTC,"Actually, I heard it last year first"
torontoraptors,3clob6,creepypaster,9,Wed Jul 8 22:46:45 2015 UTC,if he didn't eat those burgers he'd be getting crammed on by every center in the league.  It won't matter how quick he is when he's getting backed down underneath the basket.  Hopefully he can have both strength and quickness next season.
torontoraptors,3clob6,RetartedMooseGas,10,Wed Jul 8 23:22:41 2015 UTC,I think we are currently seeing the league be far more forgiving to quicker smaller players than it is too slow lumbering ones
torontoraptors,3clob6,karedogino,-2,Wed Jul 8 23:24:37 2015 UTC,"have you been watching the nba past few seasons? there is no need for ""strong"" slow centers anymore"
torontoraptors,3clob6,creepypaster,7,Thu Jul 9 03:32:29 2015 UTC,who says you have to be strong and slow?  Did you want JV to be physically the same as he was when he was a rookie? Guy was a string bean.  Putting on weight is what 90% of rookies have to do when they come in the league.
torontoraptors,3clob6,fazon,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:36:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and one of his selling points at the draft was his mobility, which is kind of gone now."
torontoraptors,3clob6,kushblazers,10,Thu Jul 9 03:11:16 2015 UTC,foot speed should help JV become a better defender but I don't want him to lose to much weight/muscle. I think JV should be focusing more on his mid range jumpers compared to being able to guard the 4. If he adds that mid range jumper to his arsenal it would mean that opposing defenders wouldn't be able to sag off him. People would actually have to respect his pump fake :D
torontoraptors,3clob6,ahobbledehoy,9,Wed Jul 8 22:10:52 2015 UTC,"he can actually shoot it, he just doesn't have the confidence to do it. like it sad how they haven't even talked about it, like he said on the video. its not just for himself but for the team. they should have been using him like how duncan plays, still very effective even for his age and loss of athelticism since he knows how to use his body and make smart plays."

torontoraptors,3cm8bf,kashman23,-1,Thu Jul 9 00:55:38 2015 UTC,"I'd trade for a starting PF so we can use our cap room to fill the gaping hole at back-up SG.

torontoraptors,3cm8bf,creepypaster,3,Thu Jul 9 01:25:48 2015 UTC,"I think Ross is our back SG. That is his natural position anyway, so he will be sitting on the bench with Carrol and JJ as SF.  However what they could do is trade Ross for a starting PF and use the cap space for a back up SG."

I'd much rather see a push for a starting calibre PF and sign a back-up SG than have a big-man rotation of JV/PPat/Biyombo/Boozer?. That's just ugly."
torontoraptors,3cm8bf,kushblazers,2,Thu Jul 9 03:06:13 2015 UTC,"what are u talking about?? Ross has no trade value atm.. You seriously think some GM will give up a STARTING PF for a young guy who has gotten worse last year? he's not worth shit in the trade market. That is exactly why he is worth more in the raptors atm, so if he sparks this season (let's face it, can't be much worse than last) THEN they can trade him. Right now his trade value is at it's all time low. Name me one starting PF where they'd agree to trade him for Ross. Not without 2 first round picks.."
torontoraptors,3cm8bf,_bigcity,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:09:38 2015 UTC,"I agree, Ross alone for a starting PF wouldn't get any deal done. But let's not understate the value of a SG with his athleticism and shooting. Moreover, the players who I mentioned as possible targets (Faried, Gibson, Jones) values really aren't that high right now.   Faried: He's got a large contract and Denver's ready to tank. I don't think the Nuggets are in a strong bargaining position.  Gibson: Chicago's got incredible depth at PF/C; Gibson's 30, coming off ankle surgery, and won't be ready till the season starts; Mirotic will probably play more minutes in Hoiberg's shooter-friendly offence etc. Basically I think he can be had for the right price.   Jones: Could be had if we overpaid for him. Houston don't need to trade him but they're okay at PF with DMo playing really well last season, Ariza playing PF in a small-ball lineup, and the Rockets drafting Harrell who was a target for the Raptors at #20."
torontoraptors,3cm8bf,Mkdeezy3,2,Thu Jul 9 03:29:32 2015 UTC,I would resign Psycho T and keep Ross. If things don't work out make a trade.
torontoraptors,3cm8bf,Studystand,2,Thu Jul 9 02:48:50 2015 UTC,I thought 5 mil was with a 67 mil cap? also factor in ridnour is unguaranteed which frees up an extra 2.75mil.
torontoraptors,3ckkgy,Tallyhorn,6,Wed Jul 8 17:10:10 2015 UTC,Haha this game will be on NBATV Canada. They have been playing all the summer league games live. This channel doesn't come with regular cable. You usually have to order it specially. I recommend it if you are a Raptors/NBA fan.
torontoraptors,3ckkgy,kushblazers,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:12:51 2015 UTC,Nba tv is definitely not on cable. It's digital and available free with a lot of packages. At least on Rogers. It's pretty shitty overall but has a lot of positives to it. I think it's worth having just for inside the nba. +1 for the classic games too.
torontoraptors,3ckkgy,queryquest,2,Thu Jul 9 11:31:19 2015 UTC,"I want to watch this game, without signing up. Doesn't Youtube support live streaming/have full D-League games posted?"
torontoraptors,3ckkgy,Schrockk,3,Wed Jul 8 18:12:31 2015 UTC,D league games are on youtube not summer league. There are websites out there like vipbox and firstrowsports that stream for free.
torontoraptors,3clpd0,LinuxF4n,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:52:38 2015 UTC,TIL there's a D-League draft
