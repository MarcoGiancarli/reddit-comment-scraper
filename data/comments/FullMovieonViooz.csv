His comic book ""Cool World"" describes a zany world populated by ""doodles"" (cartoon characters) and ""noids"" (humanoids). What Jack did't realize is that Cool World really does exist, and a ""doodle"" scientist has just perfected a machine which links Cool World with our world. Intrigued at seeing his creating come to life, Jack is nonetheless wary as he knows that not everything in Cool World is exactly friendly. (IMDb)   Critical reception:   Cool World opened at sixth on the North American box office, with $5.5 million. Its lifetime gross was $14.1 million, a little more than half its reported $28 million budget. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes collected a sample of 45 reviews and judged 4% of them to be positive. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that Cool World ""misses one opportunity after another"", describing it as ""a surprisingly incompetent film"". Deseret News reviewer Chris Hicks described it as ""a one-joke movie – and it's a dirty joke. [...] And much of what's going on here seems more angry and nasty than inspired or funny."" Variety reviewer Brian Lowry compared the film to an extended music video, praising the soundtrack and visuals, but panning the story. Leonard Maltin described the film as ""too serious to be fun [and] too goofy to take seriously"", and the lead characters as ""unlikable and unappealing"". The Washington Post reviewer Hal Hinson wondered ""whether Kim Basinger is more obnoxious as a cartoon or as a real person,"" and felt that the combination of animation and live action was unconvincing.

A strange fall of meteorites in a nearby village leads to the discovery of a huge base under a strict military control, officially a factory of artificial food. The shrewdness of Quatermass reveals that the factory is the place chosen by the aliens to conquer the Earth: they come in the form of an alive gas hidden in the meteors and to live in our atmosphere they use the human body taking the control of the brain. The courage of Quatermass and the launch of of his nuclear rocket against the asteroid of the aliens save the Earth. (IMDb)   Critical reception:   Quatermass 2 received mixed reviews. Campbell Dixon, in The Daily Telegraph found the film “all good grisly fun, if this is the sort of thing you enjoy”. The reviewer in The Times remarked, “the writer of the original story, Mr Nigel Kneale, and the director, Mr Val Guest, between them keep things moving at the right speed, without digressions. The film has an air of respect for the issues touched on, and this impression is confirmed by the acting generally”. On the other hand, Jympson Harman of the Evening News wrote, “Science-fiction hokum can be convincing, exciting or just plain laughable. Quatermass II [sic] fails on all these scores, I am afraid”. Similarly, the reviewer in the Daily Herald felt, “The whole thing is daft and full of stilted dialogue. [...] At the end a detective says: “How am I going to make a report on all this?” I felt the same way”. (Wikipedia)   More info at IMDb, Wikipedia, Freebase. I am a bot. Send me feedback.

With scenery reminiscent of ""The Grapes of Wrath,"" the film is set in the depression-era Midwestern region of the United States. As the movie opens, we see a small group of mourners clustered at a graveside. Among the mourners is Addie, the dead woman's small daughter. Moses Pray -- ostensibly of the ""Kansas Bible Company"" -- approaches the group, as the service concludes, and two of the elderly women remark that the child bears some resemblance to him and asks if he might be related. ""If ever a child needed kin, it's now,"" one lady says. With no knowledge of who her father is, Addie's only haven is her Aunt's home in St. Joseph, Missouri. Having identified himself as a ""traveling man spreading the Lord's gospel in these troubled times,"" ""Mose"" is prevailed upon to deliver the helpless child to her Aunt since he's going that way, anyway. Addie, wise beyond her years, soon discovers that Mose is little more than a scam artist traveling from town to town delivering unordered Bibles and charging exorbitant prices to recently widowed women whom he identifies through the obituary columns of local papers. Soon, Addie and Mose become a team, traveling from town to town, making money in every dishonest way imaginable, and looking for the ultimate score. The colorful characters they meet along the way make the film all the more interesting. Paramount among these is ""Miss Trixie Delight,"" an exotic dancer who Mose rescues from a traveling carnival and her minion, Imogene. The film is peppered with ""regional"" dialog. Perhaps one of the most memorable lines of the movie is uttered when Mose is forced to wrestle a backwoodsman in order to trade his new car for the hillbilly's battered old truck.

This is movie number ten for the great Ray Harryhausen, who provides his usual stunning animation, although the plot is a bit cynical for some taste, lacking the cheerful charm of such movies as ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"". In this one we get animated Selenites, giant caterpillar-like ""Moon Cows"", and a big-brained Grand Lunar on his regal throne. The special effects in the scenes of Professor Cavor's spherical spaceship en route to the Moon are beautiful.  The opening scene is clever: the ""first"" astronauts to land on the moon (an international group) is stunned by the discovery of a tiny British flag on the lunar surface. A message attached to the flag identifies the real first Moon landers, and the authorities on Earth get in touch with one of them, an aging Edward Judd, who tells the strange tale of his turn-of-the century expedition with Professor Cavor (Jeffries) and Judd's fiance' (Hyer)."

He credited the film with getting him to wonder what it would be like to revisit one's high school years, but cites Peggy Sue Got Married from 1986 as a film that had portrayed that scenario much more successfully.

A plague is attacking the second group, after which its members cease to have any interest in life and become nearly catatonic. When Zed, one of the barbarians, crosses over, the tenuous balance in their world is threatened. (IMDb)   Critical reception:   The film received mixed reviews. Roger Ebert called it a ""genuinely quirky movie, a trip into a future that seems ruled by perpetually stoned set decorators... The movie is an exercise in self-indulgence (if often an interesting one) by Boorman, who more or less had carte blanche to do a personal project after his immensely successful Deliverance."" Whilst Jay Cocks of Time called the film ""visually bounteous"", with ""bright intervals of self-deprecatory humor that lighten the occasional pomposity of the material."" Nora Sayre, in a 7 February 1974 review for The New York Times, called Zardoz a melodrama that is a ""good deal less effective than its special visual effects""... a film ""more confusing than exciting even with a frenetic, shoot-em-up climax."" Decades later, Channel 4 called it ""Boorman's finest film"" and a ""wonderfully eccentric and visually exciting sci-fi quest"" that ""deserves reappraisal"". Despite being a commercial failure and mostly panned by critics, Zardoz has since developed a cult following and found success on the home video market.

By the time the film was released, its Cold War themes had become less relevant to United States audiences and the popularity of Transformers, which the filmmakers had intended to capitalize on, had diminished. The Sacramento Bee wrote that the film ""spreads its dubious resources across the world, dealing with the already dated power-mad rivalry between America and the U.S.S.R. for domination.""
