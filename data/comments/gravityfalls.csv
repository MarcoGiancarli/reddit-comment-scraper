Forgetting Time Traveler's Pig for a moment (since Dipper didn't have a chance with Wendy anyway) starting with the Deep End, Dipper's sacrificed quite a lot for Mabel, and not always fairly. And speaking of Sock Opera, thank god that seemed to signal a turning point.

gravityfalls,3dzw7f,quichagan,25,Tue Jul 21 17:07:11 2015 UTC,I sometimes wonder if the haphazard scheduling is an attempt by Disney to keep the show on the air longer and to give them more time to try to convince Hirsch to make more seasons.
gravityfalls,3dzw7f,Kashihara_Philemon,30,Mon Jul 20 23:33:54 2015 UTC,"If so it totally backfired, if they'd given the show a decent schedule then there could have been more fun filler episodes to pad out to three seasons, and have more time to explore side characters... but instead there's pressure for the crew to give up a ton of plot stuff early and wreck the initial pacing. Alex has said multiple times they had to solve the Stans earlier because Disney drew it out so long, it was obvious shortly before NWHS that there were two so having to wait to show it at the end of a season just to start another season would be ridiculous.   To be totally honest I'm salty as fuck and will continue to be salty, not because I have to wait between episodes but because the airing schedule directly affected how the story was being told.  In certain ways it permanently wrecked the show, it'll be more obvious in the future when people binge watch."
gravityfalls,3dzw7f,yaypal,13,Tue Jul 21 00:25:29 2015 UTC,"Knowing that makes me feel kind of ambivalent about the decision to move the revelation of the Stan's up.  On the one I do like that the story is moving at a quicker pace and that we are getting more ""plot episodes"" then we did in Season One. On the other hand it really does seem like we'll be missing out on some character development or world building that we might have otherwise got if it pans out that we don't get a third season."
gravityfalls,3dzw7f,Kashihara_Philemon,5,Tue Jul 21 02:26:32 2015 UTC,"Disney will greenlight a 3rd season with those numbers.  Question is, will Alex accept?"
gravityfalls,3dzw7f,hedera3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:48:06 2015 UTC,Alex wanted to do 3 seasons in the first place.
gravityfalls,3dzw7f,phus,2,Tue Jul 21 13:59:52 2015 UTC,"With the way the series has developed he may not think that making three seasons makes much sense anymore.   He (or perhaps other members of the crew I don't remember precisely) did mention that material that was going to be used in a hypothetical season three was going to be used in season 2b. So by the time this is done he may feel that there is too little material left over to make a full third season, which is why he is floating around the ""two seasons and a movie"" as a possible final outcome for the series.  As for what Disney wants, if they push for a third season it risk Hirsch and others walking off production if they feel strongly enough about the lack of prospects for third, which would obviously be disastrous. There is a reason why the third seasons' of Star Trek TOS and Gargoyles were not as fondly remembered as their first two, and we could be seeing that here."
gravityfalls,3dzw7f,Kashihara_Philemon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:23:48 2015 UTC,I would be profoundly surprised if he walked. This is literally his first ever project. While morally great it would be a major black mark on his resume.

gravityfalls,3dzw7f,MysticalElephant,-1,Tue Jul 21 20:20:27 2015 UTC,Filler episodes don't really strike me as character development episodes though... Idk. I'd like to avoid filler and just have this show keep going regardless. Guess we'll see what happens in the future.
gravityfalls,3dzw7f,GetMeOffReddit,2,Tue Jul 21 03:54:03 2015 UTC,"Non-plot focused episodes don't need to be pure monster/ relic of the week shenanigans. You can focus on characters that haven't had much time in the spotlight or on aspects of Gravity Falls that don't necessarily relate to the main plot. And of course, foreshadowing later things doesn't hurt either.  Season two has generally been much better about this then season one I think, but that may have to do with plot picking up pace there."
gravityfalls,3dzw7f,Kashihara_Philemon,4,Tue Jul 21 14:38:44 2015 UTC,"Where did he say that they moved up the whole ""original mystery twins"" thing due to Disney's scheduling? I've read an interview where he said they moved it up they knew so many people had solved it already, but I've never heard him say it was because the schedule."
gravityfalls,3dzw7f,FrozenDonkey91,8,Tue Jul 21 05:16:54 2015 UTC,"Alex said in an interview that they moved up the reveal of the Stans in part because fans had figured it out already and there was a year long break between seasons 1 and 2 and due to Disney's scheduling a long hiatus in the middle of season 2.   The A.V. Club: Why make these revelations now? Did you build the cliffhanger into season two knowing that there’d be a hiatus at some point?  Alex Hirsch: There were a number of reasons, but that was definitely a consideration. It’s not easy to predict how the episodes will be spaced out, and in season one we were told by the channel that there would be a large mid-season hiatus. So to prepare for that contingency this time we decided to treat season two almost like two seasons, each with their own rising tensions and story arcs. That way if it was split up again we’d at least be breaking it into satisfying chapters.  But the other reason—and possibly more important one—is that half of the fandom had already figured the mystery out! As early as “Carpet Diem” in season one, fans were beginning to speculate about the meaning of the mysterious glasses in the Carpet Room, and during the year break between seasons, those speculations grew into full-blown “Stan has a brother!” exposés by the fans. I’m talking PowerPoint presentations, flow charts, timelines—this is probably the first time a Disney TV show has been analyzed like the Zapruder film. When we began season two, we knew that we couldn’t wait all season to dig into this. Halfway through the season seemed like a good compromise."
gravityfalls,3dzw7f,hedera3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:51:11 2015 UTC,"People figuring it out was in part due to how long a time they had, if the show had continued on at 3 episodes a month or so then there might not have been all that extra time people had where we had to resort to endless examining every tiny detail in each frame for something to do.  Stories are only good when your audience remains intrigued, let's say the last episode before the hiatus was NWMM and the one that aired last week was another filler-ish that didn't touch the Stan theory.  You'd probably be pissed off yeah, that we had to wait for an episode that still didn't resolve this problem after four months.  Compare that to watching NWMM but then three weeks later we see the filler, then it's not as big a deal and people won't be upset.  The crew knew this was going to be a problem when they first started season two production, and it then became a midseason reveal as the biggest part of how the audience knew what was up was the insane amount of time they had and it was getting people too thirsty."
gravityfalls,3dzw7f,yaypal,2,Tue Jul 21 11:20:02 2015 UTC,When did he ever say that?
gravityfalls,3dzw7f,swegdude,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:34:51 2015 UTC,Alex has said multiple times they had to solve the Stans earlier because Disney drew it out so long   So it's sort of like what happened with Twin Peaks and the reveal of Laura Palmer's murderer?

gravityfalls,3dzw7f,jdnev001,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:31:13 2015 UTC,"then there could have been more fun filler episodes to pad out to three seasons   And that would have ruined the show.

I'm not really okay with that."

In other words, optional content.   In the case of putting filler episodes into a show you then displace any actual progress episodes that would have been there instead.   Optional side content is VERY different than filler content. Sorry to say. Apples to oranges."

Therefore, they deserve 101 sales. They lost money as a result of of the pirate's actions. Or didn't make as much money as they should have, whichever. It doesn't matter how you phrase it, it's the same end result. The point is, they made less money because of the person who chose to pirate it.  Your definition of theft was true at some time, but thanks to the internet, we now have products that don't really have a physical existence. If you take them without paying for them, it's still stealing, and you still owe the creators for the enjoyment of their product."

After doing a little more research into disney's reasoning behind it (to build up hype even though the show already has excellent writers), I changed my mind a bit, to the point where I actually sent disney a letter. However, I realize that there's not much we can do about it so I've come to accept an every 3 weeks schedule (they better not do any more hiatus' until november lol)."

Also keep in mind that s1 was in Disney channel, where season 2 is in DisneyXD. I am not from the US nor UK but I think you have to pay to watch DisneyXD. Yup, sounds to me like a good way to promote ilegal downloads and streamings of the episodes. If you sums up the downloads on the first day and the people who watched the stream with the DisneyXD viewership, we have more than 3kk. The show is not dead, rather dying."

The viewership didn't drop because the season two announcement was delayed, it was because it was moved to Disney XD which substantially less people have access to. It continues to get the highest ratings on the channel. Do some better research next time."
gravityfalls,3e114z,GravityFallsCipher,-2,Tue Jul 21 03:40:31 2015 UTC,"The show keeps a huge fan base, the theorical and the real one, but these gaps between episodes are truly harming it. Just check fanfiction, deviantart and sites like that. Less fanart, less stories. The show keeps its quality and audience, that's true. But the fandom grows tired and stops making that much fanart like it did before. I think we were too hyped for this summer because of the hiatus, and some got disappointed."
gravityfalls,3e114z,lennoxmacduff,-4,Tue Jul 21 05:14:05 2015 UTC,"It was publically announced by Alex in March.  Disney did not confirm this until four days before Gideon Rises.  While it may have been as Alex said, it also could have been a tactic by Alex to whip up a fervor resulting in higher ratings or force Disney to approve a second season.  As to the ratings, it is still undoubtedly the highest on the DisneyXD channel, but it may be lower than if the show was on Disney, and many shows live and die by the number of viewers.  There is no guarantee that Disney will take the lower number of DisneyXD users into account when looking at the viewership numbers."
gravityfalls,3e114z,hedera3,5,Tue Jul 21 03:49:54 2015 UTC,"Disney is actually concentrating on expanding the viewership of XD, so the numbers Gravity Falls is getting, along with their expansion into the Star Wars multiverse and airing new Marvel cartoons is exactly what they want to happen.

gravityfalls,3dxd6d,TudorGothicSerpent,5,Mon Jul 20 14:45:44 2015 UTC,I figured out of wedlock is the most plausible explanation for Dip and Mabel's dad having the Pines name AND being raised by his grandparents in New Jersey.

Right when Grunkle Stan realizes he's watching The Dutchess Approves starring Sturly Stembleburgiss as ""The Dutchess' & Grampton St. Rumpterfrabble as ""Saunterblugget Hampterfuppinshire"" Great Uncle Ford's Axolotl can be seen in the fish tank.  I shared this with both the fandom and the wiki but no one seemed to notice.   That's unfortunate, because there may well be more to the axolotl storyline in the future.

I think the only thing Gravity Falls can do in that list is a character falling from a very high height and surviving.  Dipper in the training montage and Gideon in Gideon Rising."

gravityfalls,3dwfry,LaserJelly,24,Mon Jul 20 06:28:02 2015 UTC,Im glad someone said something or I would have. I'm all for fan fiction and drawings but would be nice if it actually followed what we know of Gravity Falls from the show. Mabel always has people supporting her.
gravityfalls,3dwfry,thisdesignup,13,Mon Jul 20 08:32:47 2015 UTC,Yeah I mean I get that it's a common thing for people that act happy to sometimes not be happy. Or like someone that's always there for others has no one there for them. But I really don't think Mabel is like that. In a few episodes Dipper goes out of his way to help her. Grunkle Stan even shows his appreciation for her. I just don't think this fits Mabel.
gravityfalls,3dwfry,LaserJelly,4,Mon Jul 20 10:44:25 2015 UTC,"I get where you're coming from in a way, but when taken in a way that's not too literal, it definitely captures an aspect of her character.  I don't think that she feels like this all the time, but some of  the episodes of the show have revealed her to be deeply uneasy about herself and her relationships with others.  There's no reason to think that her plucky personality is a mask for a deeply depressed individual, but she's also not a Pollyanna who's constantly happy no matter what happens.  Also, the Soos panel...my god, the Mabel in the Soos panel is awesome."
gravityfalls,3dwfry,TudorGothicSerpent,2,Mon Jul 20 13:54:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think who made the fanart may not be basing it on Mabel's feelings, but their own. But this is just my guess."

Mabel's goal for the summer, starting in the first episode, is to find love (this kind of makes sense.... she's a weird girl who identifies with social outcasts and probably wasn't super supported in her life pre-Gravity Falls).  Dipper's goal for the summer was a lot more complicated, and Wendy wasn't really part of it.  When Dipper helps Mabel with boys, he's helping her achieve the thing she really wants to achieve.  When Mabel helps Dipper investigate things, she's helping him achieve his goals."

gravityfalls,3dwblb,CoSonfused,3,Mon Jul 20 11:25:24 2015 UTC,"I was a bit quick, but you can see early Grunkle Stan peeking out a little while later. This is shortly after Ford went into the portal."
gravityfalls,3dwblb,CelestialScribe,31,Mon Jul 20 02:04:01 2015 UTC,"Actually that shot is pretty clearly Stanford, it was a big piece of evidence for his existence back when Stan's twin was just a theory. Note the cleft chin and rounded glasses with little rectangle details on the sides. My guess is this was early into his exploration of GF, before he started going crazy, the design isn't 100% consistent with how we've seen him at that age in ATOTS but back then they may not have finalized Fords designs."
gravityfalls,3dwblb,Jinxandjawz,6,Mon Jul 20 02:36:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I couldn't tell the difference, and I haven't been too immersed into the theories and such."
gravityfalls,3dwblb,RiccSon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:45:57 2015 UTC,"It was Stanford. Why? Animators often give a set of identical twins separate, opposite colors so the audience can tell them apart. For instance, Grunkle Stan usually wheres white, whereas in that picture, Stanford wheres black."
gravityfalls,3dwblb,Batusiman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:20:04 2015 UTC,"I don't remember exactly, did Ford talk in this appearance or did he stay quiet? Because I wonder who voiced him if he spoke"
gravityfalls,3e0x32,do_a_flip,4,Tue Jul 21 02:42:52 2015 UTC,"Disney is trying to build the hype, but they are some tryhards in my opinion. At this pace, we won't see the season finale until November. It is a shame, when the show was on DC in 2012-2013 it was an episode every 1-2 weeks on summer schedule"
gravityfalls,3e0x32,lennoxmacduff,3,Tue Jul 21 02:48:26 2015 UTC,"If this is true, it just makes me really sad. I mean, in this day and age, when Netflix just releases a full season of Bojack Horseman in one go, wouldn't it be enough to just stick with a traditional schedule (as in, once a week)?  I don't see how Disney is gaining anything from it, the fanbase is there because the show, through great writing, art and performances, can stand its own, without needing any artificially created hype.  The fans are the losers in this scenario, and there aren't any winners, as far as I'm concerned."
gravityfalls,3e0x32,lennoxmacduff,3,Tue Jul 21 02:52:56 2015 UTC,"The hiatus from March to July was acceptable, it fueled fanfiction. I have never seen so many stories, it was like 4 new every day. However, on summer schedule an episode every 3 weeks? So we get 3 episodes in the whole summer? That totally killed me. I begin studying again on September, which means I will lose many premier dates. Nothing better in Reddit than premier dates for episodes. But hey, it is Disney. They canceled Kim Possible, we should have seen this coming."

gravityfalls,3e0x32,OmegaEGG,3,Tue Jul 21 03:12:50 2015 UTC,"Nah, that'd be too much lore for one network. Adventure Time, Steven Universe, AND Gravity Falls? That's like bringing the Holy Trinity together...  Wait... Trinity is the state of being three. Triangles have three sides...  BILL!!!"

gravityfalls,3dx1qn,nameistoohardtosay,4,Mon Jul 20 19:50:01 2015 UTC,"You can still get one on Amazon! http://www.amazon.com/Gravity-falls-12528-Falls-Waddles/dp/B00ITS8WP0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1437384091&sr=8-1&keywords=waddles  I'd recommend getting one ASAP - the price was doubled a few months ago when stock was low, but it's back to $10 right now.  It's not pig sized - but it's the size of teacup pig.  It fits in both hands and is good for a snuggle!"
gravityfalls,3dx1qn,hedera3,2,Mon Jul 20 09:23:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah! I just went and got it. It's pretty small, but I wanted one but couldnt justify over 20$ on a smaller plush. 10$ is perfect!"
