I like the stump growth rings too... are they fine geometry ledges with AO, or is that a texture?  As for the evergreen on the left, I think it would benefit by having perhaps five sides instead of four, but I do like it's irregularities, which make it much easier on the eye."
low_poly,3dzei1,kurtdekker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:35:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I always find birch trees really nice so I wanted to give it a go! They are ledges, the only texture is the coloring, all of the rest is modelled! :) I actually realized I only did 4 sides after I had finished, so yeah i'll be remaking it after school with 5 or 6 sides!  Thank you for your feedback! Much appreciated."

low_poly,3dumz8,thelopoco,10,Sun Jul 19 17:16:57 2015 UTC,"I'm back again after a short break!  This LoPoCo piece is a tribute to my two besties who moved from Copenhagen to Australia for work. They used to live together right on the waterfront at a place called Islands Brygge.  It's quite a unique area, with a purpose-built floating harbour bath (the harbour is clean enough to swim in) and has become an architectural icon in its own right, winning about forty bazillion awards. The atmosphere is what I imagine the lidos of the 1940's to be like.   If you've never seen this thing before, it might take a while for your brain to process what's happening. That's cool :)   Modelling and materials took around thirty hours I'd say, over the course of a month. I know you guys love work-in-progress stuff, so here's how it looked at the end of day one!   Generally when making these environments, I want to capture the essence of the place while making the scale diminutive and compressed. So some things become outsized and others are miniaturized. 7-story buildings become three, and some expanses of ground are removed altogether. You can see how it's all synthesized into a 'taster-menu' representation of the real photographs above. Absolute scale is less important than balance and composition. This is the first time I've really included figures in a scene too.   As ever, very happy to receive your comments, and I always do my best to answer any questions as fully as I can. Been Blending about four months now and still having a great time :D  You can follow the rest of my LoPoCo project on facebook or much higher quality on tumblr here.   Have a great Sunday, and don't swim in the water ;)  **  Additional: Someone asked how the building was made, and whether it was one giant mesh or separate meshes. I did a deconstruction render here  so you can see the modular assembly. I modelled one single vertical block, and then repeated it horizontally. Then created the window bays which overlay some other windows, followed by the turrets and roof sections. I like to keep things fairly modular, so I can re-use the assets in later pieces."

low_poly,3dumz8,manikantlawania,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:08:13 2015 UTC,How much time do you spend on a scene like this?
low_poly,3dumz8,YolognaiSwagetti,6,Tue Jul 21 21:34:33 2015 UTC,"Dude how do you get that effect, like the matte paint on the buildings. Your designs look so crisp and clean. Just WOW !  Teach me MASTER !"
low_poly,3dumz8,YolognaiSwagetti,2,Sun Jul 19 17:49:37 2015 UTC,"I wish I knew what you meant, but sadly I don't know which effect you're asking about :/ On the other hand, thank you for enjoying the crispy cleanliness :D There is no magic here. Just simple materials and lighting."

low_poly,3dumz8,IDIFTLSRSLY,2,Mon Jul 20 08:45:26 2015 UTC,"if you learn some graphic design and probably some web design/etc I can see you as a graphic artist mainly focused on 3D illustration, in my country I see regularly job ads with such duties.  can I ask you what software you did it with, and how long did it take you to get your skills to this level? I have used some blender and 3dsmax but nowhere near your results."
low_poly,3dumz8,Templar3lf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:02:21 2015 UTC,"My day job is a front-end designer/developer and I already have about 10 years in that field, so maybe some combination could be cool :)   This was all done with Blender. I started teaching myself four months ago, and have zero previous experience with 3D so this is all new to me."
low_poly,3dumz8,givecake,2,Mon Jul 20 12:07:33 2015 UTC,"then you have all the opportunities to make it work:) If I were you I would make 2-3 nicely designed sites with nice 3D pictures of yours and sometimes check out job ads, even on freelance sites. It would certainly work here (in Hungary), reference work is more important in this field than experience.  that's good hear, I used Blender for 1-2 weeks but couldn't really make it work (and I have a lot of 3d software experience, just very different kinds)"

low_poly,3dumz8,tripl3cs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:43:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you sir! There are actually no textures in this entire thing, it's just all materials. I'm also a photographer, so I think a good awareness of lighting and composition is always a fine starting point for imagining renders. Nothing special really, I'm still a total Blender noob (4 months) so it's all perfectly achievable!"

low_poly,3du3ff,seanshin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:57:51 2015 UTC,"hey thanks man, I'm using Unity 5, - get a directional light, choose your shadows and quality preferences. - I made a new Procedural skybox material which I'm changing by script. - I made a new script attached it to the directional light which creates Ambient lighting runtime, and changes lights color also the exposure of the material. Plus changes a few things in Render Settings.   Lastly a second script which calculates time , day and night separately. Which further calculates months and years so we can have different seasons.   I hope I was clear enough. :)"
low_poly,3du3ff,seanshin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:43:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think I understand it :) I wanted to try something like your example for a school project (low poly island with generative music / movement) , but I ended up just going with simple colours because of time constraints. Thanks for sharing!"
low_poly,3du3ff,seanshin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:39:46 2015 UTC,"hahahahahah that seems so much fun man :D :P Weird yet fun :D  Nice job, how did you move the meshes ?"
low_poly,3du3ff,protoUbermensch,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:36:17 2015 UTC,"I'm just grabbing all the vertices in meshes and moving them in response to the music. Wasn't sure if it would run smoothly, but three.js is really efficient and modern mobile browsers are powerful enough :)"
low_poly,3du3ff,protoUbermensch,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:01:45 2015 UTC,"Nice looking. But the palm leaves are transparent from below. Check double normals to fix it. And I would add eyes to the wolf. I think it would add a focus point. Something to look at. Except that, nice work."
low_poly,3du3ff,CaptainSponge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:37:28 2015 UTC,Double normals in Unity or 3D software ? Eyes really ? I was never good at making eyes Thanks a lot man :)
low_poly,3du3ff,CaptainSponge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:50:48 2015 UTC,"Well, I use Blender, and it has a option to fix it. Which is called double normals. I think that option must be on the software you used to model and not in Unity. Yeah, eyes. In my opinion, it lacks a focus point. Something to look at. Just a squashed square.   : )"
low_poly,3du3ff,CaptainSponge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:40:22 2015 UTC,i use Cinema 4D ... I will look into it or edit the model again

low_poly,3du3ff,CaptainSponge,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:36:55 2015 UTC,"it is one of the fantasy setting, it will randomize from time to time. For the height of the sun you can just the "" SUN SIZE "" from material to get the feeling of distance.   Hope it helps and thanks a lot Cap'tn !"
