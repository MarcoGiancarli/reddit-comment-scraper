Virginia,3e4vop,Kekker_,2,Tue Jul 21 23:47:50 2015 UTC,"As you may already be learning, VA is a very diverse state.  Southwestern VA tends to be rural and southern, for lack of a better description.  Most of the people I've met from that area are very friendly, but you have to know that you'll always be seen as ""not really from around here"" even after 20 or 30 years.  If you're looking for a city, Roanoke is probably your best bet.  It's not as close to the VA/TN/KY corner as you want, but it's in the mountains with easy access to that part of the state down I-81.  You get a mix of all kinds of weather here.  Summers can be hot and muggy (90 degrees, 90% humidity) while winters will vary more with elevation. The mountains can see stretches of temperatures in the teens with several inches of snow, the coast is more likely to get high 30s and ice.  For localities in the middle, expect for school to be canceled 2-3 times per year for a half-inch of snow on the grass."
Virginia,3e4vop,captain_reddit_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:58:06 2015 UTC,"Humidity is really my biggest problem with Florida, it's a constant 80% down here throughout the year. Are summers consistently muggy on VA, or is that just once in a while? Also, why do you suggest Roanoke?"
Virginia,3e4vop,captain_reddit_,2,Wed Jul 22 00:06:16 2015 UTC,"Not consistently, but you can go through stretches where it's bad.  It may be less of an issue at higher elevations.  I suggested Roanoke because it's the only actual city that comes close to matching your description.  It's in the mountains with a urban ""downtown"" and affordable suburbs with a very reasonable commute and cost of living. Blacksburg/Christiansburg may be the only exception but it's primarily a college town.  Geographically, Bristol is right where you described.  It has a population of less than 20k, and that's the largest ""city"" in Virginia for at least an hour drive in any direction."

The drivers in central Virginia are very polite -- will let you over, don't try and cut you off. Northern Virginian drivers have been trained to be aggressive because of the horrible DC traffic.  Virginians tend to think of the summer as humid but it is NOTHING compared to Florida. It's rarely extremely humid for more than a few days at a time. Sometimes we get a week stretch of really high temperatures. That said, the winters are going to be a BIG change from Florida. Sometimes several weeks where the temperatures drop well below freezing at night. 10 degrees outside is miserable. But the amazing spring and fall weather make up for the miserable winters. No idea. If you are near a reasonably large city it is probably fine. The entire Shenandoah Valley are near the appalachians, not just SW VA. Take a look at Roanoke, Blacksburg, Staunton, Harrisonburg. Even Lynchburg, Culpeper and Charlottesville aren't far from the mountains."

There are a lot of great roads in the area with varied conditions, so we're used to everything. Because of the elevation summers aren't nearly as bad as they are in the rest of the state.  Temps in the mid 80's, fairly regular afternoon thunderstorms (they're the best).  Winters are varied.  Some years its 60 degrees on January first and there's very little snow.  This past year we got quite a lot of snow and temps in the single digits.   As far as I know there isn't much fiber optic yet.

Virginia,3d9gvf,Kvothe_Arliden_Son,12,Tue Jul 14 23:32:58 2015 UTC,"Police in my area of Virginia (Roanoke area), quite frankly, have been out of control in last ~2 years. Every stop they make they call in for back-up, I regularly see multiple in a car together, and they regularly ride in convoys of 3-4 cars. It just frustrates me because it seems they are really focused on getting people for petty traffic violations instead going after the stuff that's actually harming the community. Then two weeks ago, I had to call 911 dispatch to report a crime in my neighborhood and I was put on hold-on by dispatch and I asked them to send a deputy by my house when they patrolled the neighborhood, guess who never patrolled my neighborhood. Just irritating that they are everywhere but when you actually need them."
Virginia,3d9gvf,krithoff14,5,Tue Jul 14 17:35:36 2015 UTC,"They seem to be piling their resources into fighting the drug running that is apparently running up and down the I-81 corridor, which would probably account for why every traffic stop needs 2 or 3 backup units too. And I understand that there's a certain amount of risk associated with that, I do.  The problem is that they're diverting resources exclusively towards these things that net them tangible results, so they can turn around to the press and to the people deciding their budgets and say 'See? Look at how good we're doing!'.  Meanwhile, it comes at the cost of the 'protect and serve' side of community engagement."

You'll see something similar if the Fire Dept is ever dispatched for a medical or fire call...an unnecessary number of trucks usually shows up.  I don't disagree with you in regards to police presence being absent when necessary and over the top on occasion.  I'm a FFX resident, they lead the pack with those kinds of issues in our state based on current headlines.  Edit: If you folks are going to downvote, why not put a conflicting response"
Virginia,3d9gvf,ciabattabing16,2,Tue Jul 14 18:57:22 2015 UTC,Better to send too many fire trucks than too few. It also helps keep them ready to respond.

I'm talking about things like house calls for chest pains, or something that definitely doesn't need multiple engines responding.  Usually an ambulance and one engine would cut it, but if there's not much going on, you sometimes get a handful responding.  Police seem to do something similar; one car responds, maybe a second shows up or is called for backup, but 3's a crowd in my opinion for a traffic stop or anything not involving a chase or response to an emergency call."

And you didn't respond, because you wanted to prove something stupid. Answer the question, treat him with respect like he treated you. And nothing would have happened. Be done with it. Downright stupid"
Virginia,3d9gvf,slappymcnutface,-11,Tue Jul 14 23:02:23 2015 UTC,Everyone in this thread is complaining about how he was arrested because he failed to provide ID. It is illegal to arrest someone like this for failing to provide ID.   Except that isn't the whole reason he was arrested. He was arrested because like you said he didn't even respond to the officer. That was obstruction of justice in itself.
Virginia,3d9gvf,SupVFace,10,Tue Jul 14 20:03:37 2015 UTC,No it's not. You don't have to talk to the cops.
Virginia,3d9gvf,SrSkippy,-3,Tue Jul 14 20:07:05 2015 UTC,And they have 24 hours to think of a reason to arrest you. That's 24 hours after they arrest you...
Virginia,3d9gvf,SupVFace,5,Tue Jul 14 23:05:36 2015 UTC,"It's 72 hours, but thats completely different."
Virginia,3d9gvf,slappymcnutface,-9,Tue Jul 14 23:13:14 2015 UTC,"Not usually, but when you're acting suspicious like this you do. The statute says you can't knowingly obstruct an officer doing their duty ""without just cause to cease such obstruction when requested to do so"". He was obstructing the officer's investigation of him by refusing to answer him. He provided no reason why he wasn't answering him. This fits perfectly in the definition of obstruction of justice in the Virginia code section A."
Virginia,3d9gvf,SupVFace,8,Tue Jul 14 23:18:20 2015 UTC,"That's not obstruction of justice. You don't have to talk to the cops. You don't have to provide identification. Case law on both of these issues is well documented. You don't have to incriminate yourself, and knowingly making false statements to leo IS obstruction of justice."
Virginia,3d9gvf,slappymcnutface,-2,Tue Jul 14 23:21:09 2015 UTC,"You don't have to talk to the cops.   Actually you do sometimes. When there is a robbery nearby and police are out questioning people, you have an obligation to answer the police. You can't knowingly mislead them, but from the same link that everyone is throwing out in this thread:    ""To constitute obstruction of an officer in the  performance of his duty, it is  not necessary that there be an  actual or technical assault upon the officer, but there must be  acts clearly indicating an intention on the part of the accused to  prevent the officer from performing his duty""    You are correct that in many states, including Virginia, you don't have to ID yourself even if there is a robbery nearby. But if you knowingly withhold information necessary to the investigation of an officer that is obstructing his duty and thus Obstruction of Justice.   What don't you all understand about this?"
Virginia,3d9gvf,sleepyintoronto,2,Tue Jul 14 20:19:54 2015 UTC,As /u/That_Lawyer_Guy says here you're conflating positive and negative obstruction. You are never required to answer questions except by a subpoena.
Virginia,3d9gvf,skeezyrattytroll,0,Tue Jul 14 23:04:04 2015 UTC,"What don't you all understand about this?   Respectfully, you are asking the wrong question here.  We (at least I, as well as several other commenters ITT) understand obstruction of justice.  What you do not seem to understand is that the LEO did not have an active investigation in process as evidenced by his failure you state this was the case.  If the officer had rolled up and stated something along the lines of ""We have reports of a suspicious individual in this area"" then the LEO has a much stronger case for asking for identification.  That didn't happen.  The law does not require you to aid and assist unless there is an active investigation occurring."
Virginia,3d9gvf,That_Lawyer_Guy,8,Wed Jul 15 03:09:38 2015 UTC,"Your analysis is incorrect. For one thing, you claim that he was 'acting suspicious,' however you never finish the phrase: suspicious of what crime? 'Acting suspicious' is not enough.   He was obstructing the officer's investigation of him by refusing to answer him.   Again, this is incorrect. Obstruction is an improper charge when a citizen fails to identity himself absent of reasonable suspicion."
Virginia,3d9gvf,slappymcnutface,-1,Wed Jul 15 04:46:03 2015 UTC,You're talking about two things that didn't happen.   He wasn't arrested for being suspicious.   He wasn't arrested for failing to provide ID.   He was arrested because he obstructed an officer of his duty. The officer had a duty to investigate a suspicious person and he wouldn't answer him. That is obstruction under the actual code.   Maybe if you did more than read one link that is only relevant to a particular clause of the code you would understand this. That ruling is irrelevant to why he was arrested.
Virginia,3d9gvf,skeezyrattytroll,5,Wed Jul 15 22:05:02 2015 UTC,"the officer had a duty to investigate a suspicious person   Respectfully, I submit to you that engaging in completely legal behavior in public spaces does not make one a 'suspicious person'.  If there is no crime to investigate there can be no obstruction of an officer in the performance of his duty."
Virginia,3d9gvf,slappymcnutface,-2,Tue Jul 14 20:00:38 2015 UTC,"By your definition there is no such thing as suspicious behavior then. People call in suspicious people all the time.    Some nervous looking guy leaving his backpack at the terminal in an airport that quickly running away? We can't ask the police there to investigate that? It's a ridiculous presumption.   Police are often asked to investigate suspicious behavior.    I mean think about it, you can only begin an operation of preventative policing if you engage suspicious activity. If you only wait for a crime to happen you're not doing your job."
Virginia,3d9gvf,skeezyrattytroll,3,Tue Jul 14 18:12:40 2015 UTC,Please do not try to twist my words.  I did not say there is no such thing as suspicious behavior.  I said this instance is not suspicious behavior as defined by SCOTUS ruling it legal.  Proceed from there.
Virginia,3d9gvf,slappymcnutface,-2,Tue Jul 14 19:58:57 2015 UTC,I submit to you that engaging in completely legal behavior in public spaces does not make one a 'suspicious person'.       I did not say there is no such thing as suspicious behavior.    You're a moron. You're saying nothing is suspicious until it's illegal.    There's absolutely nothing I can say to exhume the stupidity and dishonesty of your efforts in this discussion.
Virginia,3d9gvf,That_Lawyer_Guy,5,Tue Jul 14 20:46:13 2015 UTC,"I disagree completely, sorry. You're talking about negative obstruction, and that simply does not exist, even in the bold-faced part of the code that you cited."
Virginia,3d9gvf,MunicipalRoundtable,-1,Wed Jul 15 01:53:09 2015 UTC,"Frankly, if you really are concerned about police conduct, this is not the way to go about it.  Sure, you may (think) you are right, but just because you can doesn't mean you should. By being antagonistic and acting in an abnormal way, you don't bring new people to the group; you alienate everyone else who may be sympathetic by having fools out in front of the camera and in the media.  Instead of bringing focus on actual instances of police misconduct, people will focus on the behavior of the fool operating the camera; he was loitering outside of a sensitive and secure federal building, unwilling to answer some simple questions, and was acting in an abnormal way... and now he is spamming r/Virginia with a video of him ""fighting the man"" (acting a fool) and expects (and is sadly getting) praise for his fooling behavior.  It really is a question of ""just because you can does it mean you should?"" and should you be free of the consequences of your actions? The SCoVA has previously ruled that there can be reasonable limitations placed around ""sensitive"" buildings and areas; and thus, it is consistent with this, that the police rightfully ask and investigate a strange-acting/looking man loitering outside a federal building who refuses to talk to otherwise engage with the Police and who is not following lawful orders.  The guy is a glorified troll who thinks they are sticking it to the man through being a jerk and using ""freedom"" to justify their behavior and take away from real and meaningful attempts to ensure the police are fairly and reasonably enforcing the law."
Virginia,3d9gvf,slappymcnutface,-9,Wed Jul 15 03:21:10 2015 UTC,"Here's a ruling that was in the video link info bar on obstruction of justice and arrest/detention in Virginia.    It is my opinion, under the specific  facts you have presented, that a law- enforcement officer conducting a lawful  investigative stop may not arrest a  suspect for obstruction of justice under  § 18.2-460(A), when the suspect refuses  to identify himself to the officer. Depending on the circumstances, however, there  may be justification to detain a suspect for the purpose of determining his  identity.     More than likely the worst part of this video was the officer who incorrectly used the term ""arrest"" when they were detaining him. It isn't just that the guy failed to provide ID, he failed to speak to the officer at all. Virginia law is iffy about providing ID as an exclusive reason to arrest, but when you throw in these other factors like him being suspicious (filming the FBI building, NOT just walking by), and not speaking to the officer at all, you have grounds to charge him easily with obstruction of justice.   In the follow up video he was held for a few hours (presumably to identify him) and released but charged with obstruction of justice, which, he did.   I mean you can't just have a guy go around filming the exterior of a federal building like this and not be suspicious of it. This was lawful and the guy was being a dick. It's a shame to see this thoughtless police-mongering spread even around here.   I'm the first guy to call out police brutality or racism when it comes to these shootings we've heard in the news lately believe me. But this simply is not one of those instances. This is a libertarian white guy looking to get in trouble with the law to be a victim.   The worst part about all of this is the reception it's receiving from this subreddit."
Virginia,3d9gvf,SpartanG087,7,Tue Jul 14 21:16:22 2015 UTC,Pretty sure the worst part is you are implying filming is somehow suspicious and you clearly don't understand what obstruction is. Can you articulate HOW he was obstructing the officer from doing his job?
Virginia,3d9gvf,slappymcnutface,-11,Tue Jul 14 23:00:17 2015 UTC,"Can you articulate HOW he was obstructing the officer from doing his job?   The officer was sent to ""investigate"" this guys suspicious behavior. He ""investigates"" by asking the guy what he's doing. He refuses to answer the officer performing his duty. The officer can't do his duty when the guy he is investigating won't tell him who he is or what he's doing.   I mean obstruction of justice works in looser ways than that. If there is a nearby robbery, a police officer has enough reason to stop and ask you questions. If you knowingly give misleading answers that is obstruction of justice, or if you refuse to answer without giving a reason for doing so, that is obstruction of justice.   Now you can't detain a person for refusing to speak to an officer if the officer has no reason to speak to you. If he just rolls up next to you want there wasn't a robbery nearby, you don't have to respond. But this guy was the target of suspicious behavior. He needed to provide an explanation."
Virginia,3d9gvf,skeezyrattytroll,3,Wed Jul 15 04:24:31 2015 UTC,"But this guy was the target of suspicious behavior. He needed to provide an explanation.    No, that is not how any of this works.  The LEO provided no explanation of his need for identification.  He did not provide exigent circumstances.  The (presumed) citizen does not need to provide explanations of his life choices to LEO merely because the LEO wanted to know without providing an explanation of why he wanted to know."
Virginia,3d9gvf,slappymcnutface,-1,Wed Jul 15 19:21:15 2015 UTC,"It very explicitly says in the code section A that you need to provide a reason why you would obstruct an officer. In the same briefing/decision that is being linked around in the thread, it is made clear that if things are calm you don't need to answer police. But if a robbery or something just happened nearby and they speak to you, you have to at least provide a reason for not talking to them.    We're not talking about ID here, that wasn't why he was arrested. He was arrested because he was obstructing the officer by not providing an explanation for his suspicious behavior. The law is intended to work like this, if you want to film a federal building that is your right. But if are suspicious about it, and the police ask what's up with you, you are given an ample opportunity to say ""I'm just expressing my right to film this building"" or ""I'm filming the tree in the lot right there with the bee-hive"" or whatever. But this guy didn't. He went looking for trouble and he found it.   No reasonable person would ever be a victim to this law. The only kind of person who gets arrested over this is a dink like the guy in the video who wants to be a victim."

They couldn't ask the guy he was with, they couldn't call his mom, they couldn't ask the hot dog vendor nearby since there wasn't anyone.

What are you even talking about. What does a FBI building being federal property have to do with VA not being a ""Stop and Identify"" state?   They detained him under probable cause of obstruction, as he was filming a federal building, which I've already said   I don't even think you watched the video. You mention he filmed from a parking lot. Nope. And now you said he was detained, but the cop who arrested him said he wasn't.   Terry V Ohio ruled that a cop has to have reasonable suspicion of a CRIME has taken place or about to take place to detain someone. It cannot be a mere hunch or suspicion.

What was the gentleman obstructing by engaging in a legal activity?  The only thing being blocked by the filmer in the video was the officers (unwarranted) curiosity.   In this case, it was refusal to identify while filming a federal building on federal property.   Well, except for a couple things.  First, the property is private, not federal.  Second, there was no complaint from the property owner, nor was there an active crime scene, nor report of a crime, so HPD has no jurisdiction.  Third, there is no law in Virginia or the federal statutes that requires you produce identification prior to arrest.   When you are in public you are not alone   True, kind of parallels the reasoning SCOTUS used deciding it was legal to take pictures of public buildings. ;o)  Don't misunderstand my position here:  The gentleman making the video is a jackass and was provoking HPD.

It is my opinion, under the specific  facts you have presented, that a law- enforcement officer conducting a lawful  investigative stop may not arrest a  suspect for obstruction of justice under  § 18.2-460(A), when the suspect refuses  to identify himself to the officer. Depending on the circumstances, however, there  may be justification to detain a suspect for the purpose of determining his  identity.     More than likely the worst part of this video was the officer who incorrectly used the term ""arrest"" when they were detaining him. It isn't just that the guy failed to provide ID, he failed to speak to the officer at all. Virginia law is iffy about providing ID as an exclusive reason to arrest, but when you throw in these other factors like him being suspicious (filming the FBI building, NOT just walking by), and not speaking to the officer at all, you have grounds to charge him easily with obstruction of justice.   In the follow up video he was held for a few hours (presumably to identify him) and released but charged with obstruction of justice, which, he did.   I mean you can't just have a guy go around filming the exterior of a federal building like this and not be suspicious of it. This was lawful and the guy was being a dick. It's a shame to see this thoughtless police-mongering spread even around here.   I'm the first guy to call out police brutality or racism when it comes to these shootings we've heard in the news lately believe me. But this simply is not one of those instances. This is a libertarian white guy looking to get in trouble with the law to be a victim.   The worst part about all of this is the reception it's receiving from this subreddit."
Virginia,3d9gvf,Kvothe_Arliden_Son,7,Wed Jul 15 02:55:05 2015 UTC,"if a police officer asks for I.D. in Virginia and you stay mute and refuse to identify yourself, you WILL be arrested   I don't think you should deal in absolutes like that, particularly if you're not a lawyer.   This guy did just as you described all while openly carrying a pistol."
Virginia,3d9gvf,mattiep9,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:44:41 2015 UTC,"Considering the town where this person is doing their open carry activism was the site of the deadliest mass shooting in America, this guy is being a pretty massive dick. He's walking around a bunch of student apartments to flex his rights, and I can promise the police were being called constantly for that. He's well within his rights to carry that weapon, but I really dislike this attitude of keeping silent to make a point, making it harder for the police to determine that the thousand calls they're getting for a guy walking around with a gun is (hopefully) not about to shoot someone."
Virginia,3d9gvf,slappymcnutface,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:04:17 2015 UTC,"Please read all of this and get back to me.   Don't care where in the state it was, if it's legally carried it's not a cause to stop and investigate. At all. Ever. Unless there was recently a crime committed and the carrier closely or exactly matches the description of the suspect.   Furthermore, what criminal would EVER openly display a firearm? Specifically because they know it would bring unwanted attention? The firearm that a criminal has is likely:  1.) stolen 2.) concealed until the exact moment of use  So assuming that an open carrier ""might end up shooting the place up"" is beyond fucking absurd in most instances.   Secondly, police 911 center operators/dispatchers should (hopefully) all be trained to know what is lawful and what isn't.   If I'm walking and have my pistol openly displayed and the nosy neighbor calls the cops, they should ask questions like: what is he doing with the gun? Is it in a holster? What is he doing? Etc.   To which the correct, truthful answers would be: it's in a holster and he isn't touching it. He is just walking down the sidewalk.   To which the operator dispatcher should hopefully be trained to tell the citizen about the legality of open carry in that state.   Sure, send an offer to drive by and see what's what, but that case up top there means that simply openly carrying a firearm in an open carry state is NOT reasonable suspicion with which to conduct an investigatory stop.  Any officer at any time may attempt a ""consensual encounter"" stop, which is literally just talking, but:  1.) that person is not to be suspected of a crime 2.) that person is free to leave at any time 3.) that person still (always) has zero obligation to speak to the police at all.   Sorry it hurt your feelings.   Maybe if campus carry were allowed for law abiding citizens, then Cho wouldn't have been quite as deadly as he was. THAT hurts my feelings. That as a law abiding citizen, if I were to go to college right now, which I still can, I would be forced to disarm. At the age of almost 30 and with extensive firearms training and practice I would be forced to become a victim while on campus.   But hey, sorry this guy offended you with all of his rights. You have the right to be offended at things (your 1st amendment right), but I have the right to not care that you're offended (my first amendment right). That's the main problem with all this ""I'm offended"" and ""but ma feels"" nonsense that's going around today, they think that just because they are offended that they are immediately right."
Virginia,3d9gvf,Kvothe_Arliden_Son,2,Wed Jul 15 04:32:41 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand. I don't think anything he did was illegal. He's well within his rights to carry that firearm, and well within his rights to not talk to the officer who responded to the calls for. He's not wrong, he's just an asshole."
Virginia,3d9gvf,slappymcnutface,-9,Wed Jul 15 15:18:58 2015 UTC,"The big difference here being the guy was just walking down the street.    The guy in OP's video was suspiciously filming a federal building. Which, though legal, is completely suspicious. Especially the way he was doing it by standing there for some time just filming it.   At that point, officers were doing an ""investigation"" to find out what he was doing. He refused to comply by not answering, so they arrested him.   The guy in the video you linked wasn't doing anything wrong. Frankly as suspicious as it is to be walking around with a gun on your side, it is clearly defined as legal and not actually suspicious in many parts of this state. So he wasn't obstructing anything by not talking to them."
Virginia,3d9gvf,skeezyrattytroll,11,Wed Jul 15 15:03:32 2015 UTC,"Both are fully legal.   One isn't more legal than another.   The law should be enforced evenly across all of these situations.   My main question, though, is why did Henrico County Police come to the FBI building? Does the building not have its own police or security force? They all do up here in northern VA."
Virginia,3d9gvf,Kvothe_Arliden_Son,-6,Thu Jul 16 12:09:47 2015 UTC,"They all do up here in northern VA.    Are you sure about this? I think you're thinking of DC. I don't see federal police and such in Arlington. It makes perfect sense to send the police for something like this.   Anyways the point is this guy was being incredibly suspicious, and refused to explain himself, which obstructed the officers in their duty of investigating a suspicious character. The whole deal with obstruction of justice is that you cant refuse to ID yourself or provide information ""without just cause to cease such obstruction when requested to do so"". Basically you have to explain why you don't want to or can't provide ID and why you refuse to speak to an officer. It becomes an investigation when the guy is being incredibly suspicious filming the FBI building like he was.    Are we suppose to just let anyone set up a tripod and film the routines of a federal building? Believe it or not terrorists do film things like this and use it to plan attacks."
Virginia,3d9gvf,slappymcnutface,2,Tue Jul 14 16:03:17 2015 UTC,"Are we suppose to just let anyone set up a tripod and film the routines of a federal building?   Yes.  The people pay for the building and the salaries of the staff within and the contractors that provide support and the whole shebang.  Yes, we are supposed to let the owners view what they have paid for.  If there is a pressing need for security/secrecy then the facility needs to be a secure, isolated facility, not an office space rented commercially."

That said, take some pics on our property and we'll ask you not to.   Continue and the federal police agents in our building may have a chat with you.   But you're still... STILL not getting arrested.   I was thinking of the DC building and the manassas building as I know of no other FBI building in the area."
Virginia,3d9gvf,slappymcnutface,-2,Tue Jul 14 20:13:54 2015 UTC,"Continue and the federal police agents in our building may have a chat with you.    Right exactly, like the officer did here. But the guy didn't respond. He was obstructing the officer's investigation of a reasonable suspicion.   If he actually spoke to the officer and explained what he was doing, that he was exercising his right to film federal buildings he would have been left alone. But the big part about the obstruction code in Virginia is you can refuse to answer an officer, but you have to give a reason. This guy didn't give any reason, he simply obstructed the officer by not answering questions about what he was doing as a suspicious activity.   Most people who have filmed federal buildings and ""had a chat"" with officers about it probably did just that. They talk about it and move on. But this guy didn't. He was being a dick looking for trouble and missed the nuance of the law in his stupid compulsion to be the victim."
Virginia,3d9gvf,billiarddaddy,2,Wed Jul 15 01:44:29 2015 UTC,"He was obstructing the officer's investigation of a reasonable suspicion.    The officer had no reasonable suspicion here.   If he actually spoke to the officer and explained what he was doing, that he was exercising his right to film federal buildings he would have been left alone.   OTOH, if the officer was familiar with the law then they would have immediately recognized no crime was being committed and the person they were questioning was under no legal obligation to speak to them.     This guy didn't give any reason, he simply obstructed the officer by not answering questions about what he was doing as a suspicious activity. (emphasis added)   Once again, there was no suspicious activity.  There was legal activity as defined by SCOTUS.   He was being a dick looking for trouble and missed the nuance of the law in his stupid compulsion to be the victim.  (emphasis added)   You misapprehend the situation.  The LEO is the player in this scenario that missed the nuances of the law.  Specifically he missed the legality of filming federal buildings and the lack of legal ability to demand identification prior to arrest, the lack of legal ability to arrest a person solely for refusing to provide ID, and probably some others that a law beast would be able to identify.  The guying filming was a jerkface, but that is not illegal, merely ugly."

He was arrested/detained on a class 1 misdemeanor for refusing to speak to the officer and ID himself. Which is legal in Virginia. The current understanding of the law of obstruction of justice in Virginia is that you can't be arrested just for refusing to ID yourself. But this guy wasn't just refusing to ID himself, he was a suspicious character who also refused to speak the police at all which is obstruction in itself.   The law says if you obstruct an officer ""without just cause to cease such obstruction when requested to do so"" then you are guilty of obstruction.   This guy had a perfect opportunity to explain himself and say ""my name is ___ and I'm just moving along"" or whatever. But he didn't. He didn't provide any reason he couldn't stop obstructing the officer.   This guy is a dick and deserves the conviction."

What did the guy obstruct so the police officer couldn't do his job, when a person does NOT have to identify themselves unless being arrested, when filming is completely legal, and refusing to answer questions is a protected 5th amendment right?  The guy didn't have to explain himself or give his name."
Virginia,3d9gvf,slappymcnutface,-7,Tue Jul 14 20:36:59 2015 UTC,"The fifth amendment has nothing to do here, he didn't evoke it until he was being arrested anyways. It was too late by then.    He obstructed the officer from doing his duty because his duty was to investigate this suspicious guy filming the FBI building. When he was unable to perform his duty to investigate this guy, he was obstructed.   If he had provided a reasonable explanation for what he was doing, under the law he would have been OK. But this dink libertarian forgot to read all clauses of this particular code including the I quoted.    This was less about the ID and more about refusing to answer him. There are times when you can avoid speaking to the police at all, but when you are the target of the investigation you can't avoid that."
Virginia,3d9gvf,skeezyrattytroll,8,Tue Jul 14 20:54:30 2015 UTC,"He still has no obligation to talk to police  He didn't prevent the officer from investigating. Are you suggesting the officer is unable to make observations or deductions and needs to get a verbal explanation to understand that the guy is CLEARLY filming?  He doesn't have to provide anything and it's NOT up to him to do the cops job.  Refusing to answer isn't obstruction. You can be investigated and never have to answer a single question. Besides, the arrest was about failure to ID."
Virginia,3d9gvf,SpartanG087,-1,Tue Jul 14 20:57:58 2015 UTC,"Refusing to answer isn't obstruction.   Just to add to how wrong your understanding of this is, here's a bit from the linked ruling you keep throwing around:    ""To constitute obstruction of an officer in the  performance of his duty, it is  not necessary that there be an  actual or technical assault upon the officer, but there must be  acts clearly indicating an intention on the part of the accused to  prevent the officer from performing his duty""    If there was a big crowd and the officer had a bunch of people he could ask about that guy filming over there, you as the person filming don't need to respond. He can carry on his investigation by speaking to others.   But when you're the only person around, as this guy was, the only way the officers could further their investigation is by getting answers from him. He refused to allow them to perform their duty, and in that he obstructed justice.   But keep downvoting me. Just stop shitposting incorrect things you don't understand and making people hate the law more than they already do.   There are tons of things to legitimately complain about police lately. Why don't you try a new submission where the police shot a guy standing in his doorway of his home in Dallas? Get some Ferguson links, get something about the homeless guy who was shot in Arizona. There are tons of things you can pull out that we can complain about police being wrong. This isn't one of them. They don't deserve flak for this."
Virginia,3d9gvf,SpartanG087,-2,Tue Jul 14 21:11:53 2015 UTC,"Refusing to answer isn't obstruction.   Did you forget to read the code again? https://vacode.org/18.2-460/    If any person without just cause knowingly obstructs a... law-enforcement officer... in the performance of his duties as such or fails or refuses without just cause to cease such obstruction when requested to do so by such... law-enforcement officer, he shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.     It's right there in the fucking code. The only way they could investigate his suspicious behavior is if they told him what he was doing. They couldn't ask his friend next to him since he wasn't with anyone. They couldn't call his mother and ask him what he was doing since they didn't know who he was or who to call.   The only way they could figure out what this guy was doing is by asking him or finding out who he was.   When he failed to provide a reason for his silence, that was obstruction of the officer's duty to investigate.   The spirit of the law is to provide ample opportunity for a person to explain themselves to the law and not be arrested. If you refuse to explain yourself when you are a suspicious person, that is obstruction. The spirit of the law, if I made be so bold to interpret it, was never to protect people who were looking for legal trouble - which this guy clearly was doing. He went in to this looking to be a victim and surprise surprise he found it!   If this was some innocent family walking by the building filming their kids doing cartwheels as they went by and the officer arrested them even when they explained what they were doing, that would be terrible and this video would go viral. But it wasn't. It was some dick who wanted to get arrested and unfortunately didn't understand the depth of the primary a. clause of the code of obstruction."

Can't swing a dead cat without hitting a winery. Main street in Front Royal is worth a stop. Tons of hiking in Shenandoah NP, accessible from Front Royal with a hefty park entrance fee. Skyline Caverns, right near the entrance to Shenandoah. Also hiking to Signal Knob at the north end of Massanutten mounain in the George Washington National forest, no fee.

There's the town of haymarket day that is every sept or october, we have several events during the year both sponsored and unsponsored by the town including car shows, small craft shows, tree lightings and octoberfest."

Virginia,3d0glv,KmanRothemich,2,Mon Jul 13 12:34:13 2015 UTC,"Another option would be going to Woodstock and taking route 42 (west off I-81) out to Fishers Hill and going out Wolf Gap Road into Wardensville and taking 55 back into Virginia. IIRC Trout Pond is off of Wolf Gap Road, there's also the fire tower in Woodstock, and you could also take Zepp Road off Back Road over the Mountain and back out to 55 in Star Tannery. Another great option is taking 55 out to Wardensville and jumping on Corridor H, there's a beautiful lookout near Moorefield, WV. Star Mercantile is a nice restaurant in Wardensville. Lastly, if your phone carrier is Sprint you'll have service through most of the driving in that area Message me if you've got any questions as I'm fairly familiar with that area from having family in West Virginia and living in Woodstock through high school."

Virginia,3cy3sb,Delta_Sigma,19,Sun Jul 12 13:53:37 2015 UTC,"I have mixed feelings about Virginia.  It is my home, and I am raising my family here.  There are a lot of things I love about Virginia.  But I struggle with Virginia's lack of moral fiber.  During both the colonial period and the early national period, Virginia was a beacon of freedom.  Since then, it has been an anchor to progress.  Virginia took the lead in the fight to preserve slavery.  It resisted school integration with massive resistance.  It fought against interracial marriage in Loving v. Virginia.  And it fought against marriage equality for homosexuals.  In honesty, it feels like Virginia has been moving in a positive direction since I have been living here (20 years).  But, then again, it has elected men like Bob McDonnell and Ken Cuccinelli to office, and it actually soiled its own state constitution by using it as a tool in the suppression of rights (passing an amendment denying equal treatment under the law based on sexual orientation).  So - no.  I am not as passionate about VA as you are.  But I am hopeful that we might shed some of the awful hatred and bigotry that seems to have defined Virginia for the past 150+ years."
Virginia,3cy3sb,Delta_Sigma,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:37:58 2015 UTC,"This is how I feel. I work as a software developer. In many, for lack of a better phrase, more ""progressive"" states or countries, the only thing required of a software developer is the ability to demonstrate proficiency. Virginia? No. You have to have your four-year degree (not necessarily even in the field you're trying to work in) and two certifications (which are barely related to your field, and which you have to pay for yourself) before you're even considered for an interview. Virginia has historically been openly hostile toward new ways of thinking (or even old ones with which they don't particularly agree).  So, from my point of view, Virginia is where I have spent much of my life, and I have many fond memories here. That said, I have just as many terrible memories, many of which are directly tied to the state itself and the people who work for it and those who claim to love it. I don't think I'll be raising a family here. I don't like the notion of ""We're better because of the state we live in"" which is so prevalent in much of the US (not just Virginia), and I don't want my kids to grow up thinking that it's okay to think that way.  And before anyone thinks I'm picking on Virginians in particular, think again. I have the same disdain for anyone who claims to be better just because of where they are born or where they live. I have the same disdain for anyone who claims that their country/town/city/continents is ""better"". I am a Virginian, yes, and an American. But first and foremost I am a human being, and it just doesn't feel as though I am treated like one here."

I've lived in NoVA and seen it change and expand outwards (although I believe it'll stop growin Westward as it's harder to build in the mountains/hills of Western Loudoun).

I thought it was common opinion on reddit that nationalism is a bad thing. You shouldn't fight for one country just because of certain geographic features.. you should fight for the side with the best ideals. It always seemed ludicrous to me that so many Confederates fought for Virginia thinking it would be what was best for the state.. just because that's where it was located.   I mean you could definitely argue staying in the Union was better for the state. So if you really cared about Virginia, wouldn't you want what's best for it? For it to stay a strong part of a strong Union with mutual protection and economic benefit etc.?   It seems that this Civil War era of thought in the United States had a lot of people thinking territorially, like a precursor to the kind of nationalism we'd see leading into World War 1 and through the 21st century.   I'd like to think we're moving towards a more pan-humanist era where national borders don't matter as much as the ideals.

There are roads, buildings, and infrastructure that need to be repaired, and that's not even the beginning of things we should be focused on.

If Jeff Davis Hwy is renamed, should they also rename Maine's Arnold Hwy? After all, it was named for Benedict Arnold.

Expulsion is the school saying ""we can't deal with this kid.""   It's giving up. It's admitting defeat. It's saying ""we are not good enough educators to teach your kid and the other kids in our charge at the same time.""   It's fucking preposterous that the school can't handle some kid who lied to his friends (not the school system) about having weed. People lie to their friends all the time.

If someone is from out of the country, they may not be familiar with how obsessed Americans are with 1776. In Williamsburg, you will see what America thinks ""old times"" looks like as well as get a sense of Colonial Revival Architecture. You also get a town on a peninsula (Yorktown, Jamestown, and wburg are all on the Virginia Peninsula  In Richmond, you could go to Carytown to get a quirky shops feel, or if you are more outdoorsy, you could hike along the floodwall/Canal Walk or eat at Casa del Barco to get a sense of how many early Virginia cities were founded upon the river.   Then you take 64 to cville and go to Monticello or the public Downtown Mall (a pedestrian walkway) get a sense of how Virginia expanded from the tidewater area into the mountains.
