They were going to replace passwords (because people still suck at making passwords) with a system which would authorize you through your phone. When signing in, a series of tones would be played back on a computer and picked up by your phone. If your phone reported to the auth servers the correct tones, then they knew you (or at least your authorized phone) where the one trying to sign in.  Google thought it would be a cool way to prove you were actually sitting in front of the TV you wanted to cast to."

That will usually give you a link to a source.  If you want to just download the images, the Chromecast by default is pointed to this url for Backdrop and you might be able to find an imgur album zip that someone else packaged together with a bit of searching.  If you want to completely replace Backdrop, then you might have to look into a custom firmware. Try XDA forums for more info.  Usually if you want a custom dashboard, people just make their own HTML page and then cast that. Although there are apps that offer something similar for people that want a quick and easy solution."

Chromecast,3dtrlt,scottrepreneur,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:50:04 2015 UTC,You can reboot through the Chromecast app.
Chromecast,3dtrlt,Trogdor420,0,Sun Jul 19 14:47:11 2015 UTC,"But instead of it always being ready to cast, you'll wait for it to boot up. Then it checks with the servers for a firmware update since it hasn't had power to check for one, so it'll start doing that while you're trying to cast something.  I dunno, the wall is a more reliable source of power. And the fact that he's using a port labeled ""Service"" is even more sketchy. It might look like a regular USB port, but they probably wired it up in some proprietary manner. It sounds like he lucked out though, and they didn't rewire the power rail to a different pin. You could fry your Chromecast AND your TV in that case.  If you think about, nothing else plugs into a TV for power, so why would the Chromecast be the only exception?"
Chromecast,3dtrlt,JimboLodisC,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:45:30 2015 UTC,"I missed the sketchy port portion of the OP, but the fact that no devices have utilized the power of the TV to run is the exact reason that the Chromecast would (theoretically) be the only exception. Roku has their stick and the Fire stick is  a thing, don't know any one getting one though. Computers are small enough to be run from USB power.   I'd be interested in the case for wall power though, but in my experience the device runs really hot. Power off in the Chromecast app is at least a couple taps, so turning off the TV and Chromecast is one click is easy. The boot time is under a minute in most cases. Some phones are getting IR and some TVs smart enough to be turned off from the phone.   It's powerful enough to run on the wall, but that's not an excuse for TV makers to not keep up with these innovations."
Chromecast,3dtrlt,scottrepreneur,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:42:15 2015 UTC,"Thing is, I'm across the room and don't touch my Chromecast, so I have no idea how hot it gets when I use it.  The fact that it has run perfectly fine for months on end being plugged in 24/7 means I don't care how hot it gets.  If overheating were an issue, we'd be seeing post about ""my Chromecast died"" about once a week, probably even more frequently than that. It'd be a common enough occurrence that a tech site would probably pick up the story and there'd be a massive stink made about it to the point that Google would have to address overheating concerns.  In the few times I've switched it out to try my FireTV stick (I bought two of them) in the same HDMI port, the Chromecast was warm but not alarmingly hot to the touch.  So really, the Chromecast is fine. It can get hot, and it can handle getting hot."

Chromecast,3dtrlt,JimboLodisC,4,Sun Jul 19 21:57:36 2015 UTC,This is really not a warning but a tech support issue. The service port often simply does not provide enough power and will cause issues that lead users to thinking that the Chromecast is defective or at fault.

Just make sure it's a true USB port and not the service port (they're not true USB ports so the specs can vary from TV to TV). Also the Chromecast powers off when the TV does because the USB ports are no longer powered which inhibits the CEC abilities of the Chromecast.

Chromecast,3dtrlt,JimboLodisC,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:54:54 2015 UTC,I can't say if this is Google themselves but a power adapter is often recommended if people are experiencing issues streaming.
Chromecast,3dtrlt,Swarfega,4,Sun Jul 19 19:43:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this isn't the case. I think you're mixing it up with the popular troubleshooting step of advising someone to power it from the mains.  This is not because powering from the TV can be an issue, but that power provided from USB for TVs can be variable and unpredictable, and so if people are already having problems, TV USB power might be the cause. However, if it runs with no problem from USB, then it won't cause any further issues."
Chromecast,3dtrlt,Willeth,0,Sun Jul 19 17:03:28 2015 UTC,"No, I am just following Google's advice of powering it through a dedicated means instead of the USB port on the TV.

That's the thing though. You claim that it's a troubleshooting step that fixes issues. So why not just have the novel idea of not doing it in the first place."
Chromecast,3dtrlt,JollehRoger,3,Sun Jul 19 15:37:12 2015 UTC,"It fixes issues on the occasion that it's not getting enough power because of a low-spec or faulty USB port. However, being plugged into a USB port cannot cause other issues with the Chromecast to spontaneously occur or damage it in a way that permanently affects it. Google recommends mains power because it is a way to guarantee that the device gets enough power, not because powering from TV USB can cause other problems, or that powering the device from USB is guaranteed to cause problems.  If your TV's USB can supply enough power to the Chromecast to run then there is no reason (other than preference) to choose one over the other."
Chromecast,3dtrlt,Willeth,2,Sun Jul 19 15:52:45 2015 UTC,Its power adapter is for the cases when the TV didn't supply the power. It's definitely intended to work with the TV's power source as well though.
Chromecast,3dtrlt,spirolateral,2,Sun Jul 19 16:41:03 2015 UTC,"Have you ever plugged your cell phone into a computer's USB port? Or use someone else's charger? It's no different. If it's fine, it's fine. Google's own ads and pictures show off the ability to plug into the TV, which could be very useful depending on the situation and availability of wall outlets. It also says the perfect way to use it is with the adapter. They're perfectly valid. It's not ""Ouch, don't do that,"" that's just obnoxious"
Chromecast,3dtrlt,connormxy,2,Sun Jul 19 20:05:43 2015 UTC,"But a computer's USB port is actually a USB port. It's labeled as USB, and is wired as a USB port.

Google explicitly warns you against using those ports."

Chromecast,3dvqtf,DawnDevil,2,Sun Jul 19 22:53:41 2015 UTC,"It's because the media you are trying to play is encoded for 5.1 and your speakers are either:   2-channel Or Chromecast is plugged into your TV, then you have audio-out to your receiver from the TV, which in many cases down-converts to 2-channel   Dialog/voices are typically played through the center channel and background music is played through the corners.  That's why it seems loud/quiet to you.  So it's trying to play to a non-existent center channel.  Are you using Plex to serve the media?  If you are, you can edit the Chromecast profile located at ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Plex\Plex Media Server\Resources\Profiles\Chromecast.xml"" and set the VideoAudioCodec to play 2 channel audio and restart your Plex Media server.  It'll look like this for AAC audio and you will change this part value=""6"" to be 2:  <VideoAudioCodec name=""aac"">       <Limitations>         <UpperBound name=""audio.bitrate"" value=""768"" isRequired=""false""/>         <UpperBound name=""audio.channels"" value=""6"" />       </Limitations>"

Chromecast,3drslk,RestInPeaces,5,Sat Jul 18 22:15:43 2015 UTC,That's the beauty of the Chromecast. Whatever device you're casting from essentially turns into a remote and the content goes from the router straight to the Chromecast.

Chromecast,3drslk,mattbuford,2,Sat Jul 18 23:08:19 2015 UTC,5Mbps is good enough but be careful downloading anything else while watching videos.

Chromecast,3dpdi1,MrBester,2,Sat Jul 18 15:22:29 2015 UTC,"I don't have the Ethernet adapter, but I do have two Chromecasts and a solid understanding of wired and wireless networks.  You might not need WiFi once Ethernet has been configured on the Chromecast, but I'm pretty sure you still need a smartphone or a tablet with WiFi capability and the Chromecast app for the initial setup. If the Chromecast is new out of the box, you may also need to connect it to the Internet over WiFi for a few minutes to update the firmware before it will connect via Ethernet."
Chromecast,3dpdi1,BillDaCatt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:35:32 2015 UTC,Which is silly. With the Ethernet adapter the Chromecast should automatically get an IP address and be connected to the network. Hopefully an update comes so that setting up over WiFi is not required.

Chromecast,3dmkd8,antonyourkeyboard,6,Fri Jul 17 15:58:00 2015 UTC,"Here is the best way I can explain it. You have two different network bands to choose from, 2.4 and 5Ghz. In apartments (like the one I'm in), there are a lot of wifi signals that croud in the 2.4Ghz band and cause interference. The 5Ghz band is much wider, so that isn't a problem.  When I'm sitting right next to the router, I can connect my phone to either the 2.4 or 5Ghz band. When I connect it to the 5Ghz, I get around 50Mbps down speed. When I connect it to the 2.4 Ghz, I get around .2-.5Mbps down. This is also with the router about 5 feet from the Chromecast.  This causes the Chromecast to constantly loose signal. For instance I can be streaming music through Google play music, and it will randomly stop because my phone can no longer connect to the chromecast. When using plex, it will constantly lag and buffer forever.  This adapter eliminates the problem of connecting wireless, thus avoiding the interference problem.   Lastly I'm not an expert on any of this, I just wanted to give my version of an ELI5."
Chromecast,3dmkd8,JimboLodisC,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:18:59 2015 UTC,"To add to that, I have a Moto SBG6580 and you can only run either 2.4GHz or 5GHz, not both. So if I wanted to switch to 5GHz I would have to stop using my Chromecast or buy a new router."

Chromecast,3dmkd8,mrsmegz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:11:45 2015 UTC,"I'm sure I could bridge it.  Luckily, Charter doesn't charge to rent modems. I could therefore get something like a SB6141 to use for no extra charge. This would allow me to sell my 6580 to buy a new 802.11AC dual-band router, which is probably the only reason I'd bother with changing up my current network setup.  I don't have any wifi issues as it stands with my 6580. All my devices work wonderfully on my 2.4GHz SSID, and I only reach a dead spot when I go outside the back door of the house. Not to mention, my router is within 2 feet of my Chromecast and TV, yet I still bought this CC ethernet adapter as an impulse buy. Also, I currently only have one device that would be able to connect using AC. I might be upgrading my phone at the end of the year, so that would probably be around the time I consider making any changes."

If you've done the router setup properly to use the vpn, all you should have done is set your internet to use the unblockus DNS primary and secondary servers.  The only additional setup at the router to get the chromecast to use the vpn would then be to create a rule on your router that blocks all traffic to the chromecast for the google dns servers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) so that the chromecast is forced to use the unblock us dns."

Chromecast,3dp40t,elementsofevan,3,Sat Jul 18 14:39:25 2015 UTC,"I imagine that there is very little documentation on this, as it's a very standard networking concept: especially on home networking gear, VLANs and wireless client isolation is rarely the default, as it would prevent the expected communication from happening and cause the user no end of problems. Also, even if they were set up, changing the SSID and password to the same would do nothing to rectify this, as you'd have to go in and disable wireless isolation and/or adjust the VLANing manually. The source you linked to is merely another opinion, not any official documentation. Also, it's about Apple gear, and Apple is known to eschew best/common practices in exchange for ""the Apple way"". While there is always a possibility that VLAN or wireless isolation may be in force, it's much more likely that devices on separate wireless networks will be able to communicate with each other, regardless the name/password of their respective networks."

Chromecast,3dp40t,trendless,2,Sat Jul 18 04:35:09 2015 UTC,"Regardless of the network names and passwords, you should be able to connect any 2.4ghz devices to the 2.4ghz ssid, any 5ghz devices to the 5ghz ssid, and they will be on the same ""network"" and be able to talk. Think of each wireless network as another port on your router; all devices you plug into any port can talk to each other. There is one exception, and that's if your router is set for wireless client isolation or the wireless networks are setup to each use a different VLAN; this is rarely the default setting, however. And, if you're unlucky enough to have this be the case, simply changing the names and passwords of the networks will not magically make it work; you'd need to disable isolation and/or manually put both wireless networks into the same VLAN."

Chromecast,3dgsk2,ERIFNOMI,-28,Mon Jul 20 14:17:33 2015 UTC,"Well, it is a free, ad-supported platform. If you don't want ads while you're listening to music, get Play All Access (or YT key).   I don't mind the ads on YouTube much at all. They're short and skippable, show before the content rather than interrupting it, and they help support the content creators that put out what I want to watch on YouTube."
Chromecast,3dgsk2,ERIFNOMI,35,Thu Jul 16 13:04:34 2015 UTC,"Read the title, you have completely missed the point.  I have no problem with ads but throwing a 6 minute infomercial in between two 4 minute songs is just bad practice.  Generally I'm not going to be staring at the youtube app between songs on a playlist so skipping can be a pain in the ass.    All I'm asking for is shorter commercials for Chromecast or at least an easier way to skip them. It seems like other casting devices have the ability to skip commercials via the TVs' remote. Chromecast already has the ability to pause and resume videos via the remote so I don't think it'd be all that hard to add a 'skip ad' feature."
Chromecast,3dgsk2,aerger,-31,Thu Jul 16 13:12:00 2015 UTC,"The content I watch is much longer than 6 minutes. Hell, sometimes it's multiple hours long. 6 minutes is nothing (and they're skippable after a few seconds).   I haven't missed the point at all. It's a huge platform supported (and driven) by ads. Without the ads, there would be no YouTube. So you can either watch the ads, skip them after a few seconds, or pay for there to be no ads."
Chromecast,3dgsk2,ERIFNOMI,11,Thu Jul 16 13:20:00 2015 UTC,"Lately I've noticed not just the longer 6-minute-variety ads, but also 30-120-second ads that can't be skipped at all. I had this happen on a 10-minute video just a couple days ago.  I just close the window now when that happens. Can't--won't--deal with it. There's too much advertising everydamnwhere, and I block it whenever I can, because there are even more cases where I can't. It should not be as pervasive as it is, imo."
Chromecast,3dgsk2,Ariakkas10,-24,Thu Jul 16 13:47:36 2015 UTC,"No one likes ads. Deal with them however you want. But it's a bit ridiculous to complain about them if you think about how they're helping support the people who bring content to you. A lot of these people don't have time for another job. They make their money running sites you like to read and making videos that you want to watch. If they can't get ad revenue, they'll have to do something else.   I admit I block ads in my browser. Ads on a lot of sites have gotten way too intrusive. I support appropriate advertising and appreciate ad blockers that allow these types of ads that don't get carried away. A 30 second ad before a video on YouTube seems reasonable to me. I'm not paying Google for the bandwidth and I'm not paying the content creators for the content, so I call it fair. I haven't come across ads long than a minute or two, and the long ones have been skippable after a few seconds. Do I want to watch them? No. But I'm willing to understand why they're there and live with them as a necessary evil. If you don't like it, move to a platform where you pay directly instead of through ads."
Chromecast,3dgsk2,ERIFNOMI,14,Thu Jul 16 13:54:22 2015 UTC,"Is it hard to breathe up there so high on that horse?   You can't shit all over the guy for complaining about ads... Spinning the tale of the poor destitute content creator, and then turn around and admit you use adblockers in a Web browser, but that's OK because you've rationalized it in your mind.   You're a hypocrite . Eat shit"
Chromecast,3dgsk2,Ariakkas10,-12,Thu Jul 16 16:00:35 2015 UTC,"Wow, who the fuck is in your ass this morning?  I think I'm morally superior for understanding how ads work? Give me a fucking break. I think the people who produce content that has literally replaced TV for me should get a few bucks for doing so. If they didn't make money doing it, they wouldn't be able to do it. That fucking simple.   I explained browser ads, you fuckwit. Go and read it again. I don't support malicious ads and I don't support intrusive ads. But I want to see the sites I visit stay around. I'd rather they do that through tasteful site ads than through behind the scenes deals that cloud their judgment.    Eat shit   Fuck you too buddy."

Chromecast,3dgsk2,ERIFNOMI,4,Thu Jul 16 16:58:08 2015 UTC,"Any entity that relies on ads is an entity that deserves whatever it gets. I'd much rather pay for content than have to watch ads, but it's simply not an option in many cases. I don't feel even slightly badly about it, either, and I'm a content creator to boot.   Ads are a massively effective vector for all kinds of malware. And I primarily block them on those grounds alone--nevermind the graphical trashiness, completely inaccurate targeting, blaring audio, tacky or tasteless images, the constant, constant interruptions, or the general tracking--stalking, really--across everything I do, where these companies know more about my interests and shopping preferences than I am consciously aware.   I can't feel bad about any of it. Every time I'm on a PC that doesn't have adblocking, I am astounded at how noisy and polluted and stressful--and flat-out dangerous--the web has become. I hate that in the real world, and I certainly don't need it online.   The industries that rely on advertising have done all of this to themselves. People want free, but the biggest mistake, maybe, is giving it to them.  Nevermind how completely, utterly non-free it is in terms of your time, sanity, convenience, etc etc. I don't need to see billboards for some item X, hear commercials for it on the radio, see ads for it in newspapers and magazines, and then still have to deal with ads for it online as well. I don't buy magazines anymore because the content/ad ratio has gotten ridiculous. I don't buy music anymore. I don't go to movie theaters unless I have to with my children. I don't buy DVDs/BR discs. Remember when you got cable and went to a movie theater to get AWAY from commercial-laden broadcast television? It's increasingly difficult to buy clothing that doesn't have the company's logo slapped all over everything.  Let's pay $50 for a t-shirt, only to be a walking billboard? How has it come to this?  Over my entire lifetime, I've given more than enough of my eyes and ears and mental health to these companies. I now have the option to remove some of it from my life, simplifying and de-stressing my life dramatically, and I'm not ever going to hesitate taking it. I'm happy to support businesses by buying their product. That's the extent of the relationship I want to have with any and all of them.  EDIT:  I don't consider ads a ""necessary evil"", btw. I consider it a lazy way of profiting from people who have been extensively conditioned to think this is the best and only way for them to get what they want. Evil, absolutely. Necessary, definitely not."

It's called TrueView.  I notice all the time that YouTube advertisements will have a super punchy first ten seconds or so, then taper off to something boring (like a long end-card). The hope is that the user will view the important part of the ad, then eventually click ""skip"" so that the advertiser doesn't need to pay YouTube (and by extension, the YouTuber whose video the ad is attached to).  I've even seen one ad, honest-to-god, in which the spokesperson said something like ""Go ahead and click 'skip' now to see your video!"" and then awkwardly smiled at the camera for several seconds.

Chromecast,3dgsk2,jimmiefan48,3,Thu Jul 16 15:26:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed but we need the ability to skip ads from outside the youtube app, preferably via the TVs remote."
Chromecast,3dgsk2,Baked_Otter,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:15:49 2015 UTC,So you want a completely free service with no ads or you will stop using it? In that case I don't think youtube cares if you stop using their service. You aren't making them money.
Chromecast,3dgsk2,jimmiefan48,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:16:35 2015 UTC,I never said that. I'm fine with the ads as long as they stay 15 seconds or less.

I saw a youtube ad for an Arturia Microbrute synthesizer (obviously targeted, since it's a pretty niche market), so I actually watched the whole thing and looked it up afterwords, since I hadn't heard about it before. A couple weeks later I was a proud owner of one. I play it all the time and absolutely love it, and I wouldn't have known it existed if it weren't for a targeted youtube ad.  That and Breadstick sandwiches from Olive Garden. Saw an ad on youtube for them last week and went to olive garden the next day. I was totally okay with that advertisement as well (although that one probably wasn't targeted, or they target to everybody who loves Olive Garden breadsticks...aka everybody)."

If your vpn provider  has a smart dns service (usually as part of vpn subscription), you can normally set dns on router and use static redirection of cc dns.  Many guides on web or in other threads in this forum.  An easy way that does not require router changes is to use a PC and install a wifi hotspot. You can do this manually for free but is a bit cumbersome (search web -many guides). if you install connectify max (not free but fairly cheap) ir makes it very easy. You connect to vpn on pc, and connect cc and phone to wifi hotspot, and then you can cast from phone when connected to vpn."

Chromecast,3dicgd,JimboLodisC,2,Thu Jul 16 16:20:56 2015 UTC,"Odd that the N6 isn't Miracast-capable.  But Miracast is screen-mirroring. If you're okay with mirroring your screen, then just do that. Screencasting won't go out to the outside internet and eat up your tethering allowance.  The only problem is the Chromecast requires a connection to the internet at all times. The simplest way to get everything working would probably be setting up on a home network first and then creating a wifi hotspot on your phone with the exact same login credentials (same SSID, same password). That way you don't need to bring a 3rd device to run the setup when you're on the go. The Chromecast should remember the previous login info and instead of finding your home network, it'll find your hotspot. Then you can screencast and that data will flow straight to the Chromecast."
Chromecast,3dicgd,WinDroidGuy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:19:52 2015 UTC,"hmm, I think I get what you are saying. I think I'll do an experiment and see if it eats up my tethering allowance and see if that might work.  And yes it's odd that the N6 isnt miracast capable."

A Roku ready TV requires a mhl Roku dongle. When hdtv's first were introduced it meant you could by a tuner to add to the TV, wifi ready BluRay players required an optional wifi adapter."
Chromecast,3deemo,see__no__evil,2,Wed Jul 15 16:56:13 2015 UTC,"Im not sure the CCast was designed to transmit over HDMI cables longer than the little dongle, so that may be your issue.  It's a low power device so it would probably need to be plugged right into a reciever."
Chromecast,3deemo,RBeck,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:17:49 2015 UTC,"Well, the Chromecast gets connected directly to the splitter (tried with and without the included extension). Then the splitter has its own separate power source..."
Chromecast,3deemo,loib,2,Wed Jul 15 21:45:37 2015 UTC,"It sounds like either the ViewHD and/or the HDMI cables are faulty. If I were you I'd try the HDMI cables with some other equipment to test if they were at fault. If they're fine I'd return the ViewHD as defective and try ordering a new one to see if that works.  I've got an HDMI splitter which is not the ViewHD but it seems to be made at the same factory. I've had no issues with it, using it with both Apple TV, Chromecast and other devices (I record the screen for tutorials)."
Chromecast,3deemo,loib,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:23:52 2015 UTC,"The ViewHD splitter does work when connected to a TV (with the same 3 foot cable from splitter to TV). It just doesn't work going to the projector. A laptop plugged into the projector HDMI works fine... I'm suspect of the cables still, but I have no idea what kind of cable should definitely work with Chromecast --> Splitter --> Projector."
Chromecast,3deemo,furious_20,2,Wed Jul 15 21:43:04 2015 UTC,"Maybe the HDCP isn't properly stripped then? Not sure how you could test that properly. I use mine with a capture device (Elgato) so it's fairly easy for me to assess whether HDCP is actually stripped: If it is, it works, if it isn't, it doesn't work.  I'm assuming your current setup is just Chromecast > Splitter > HDMI-cable > Projector? That's what I would suggest, but if it doesn't work then I'm not quite sure. Using non-HDMI-cables would most likely strip the HDCP, but you risk losing quality in the progress."

Chromecast,3deemo,danskeman,2,Fri Jul 17 13:45:16 2015 UTC,Odd that they recommended a shorter HDMI cable for the splitter. Some HDCP enabled products don't play well with cables shorter than 6ft. Sounds like this projector and splitter don't like it. I'd try a 6 ft+ HDMI 1.4 cable
Chromecast,3deemo,marktx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:25:23 2015 UTC,"The idea sounded promising enough since I was indeed using a 6ft+ cable before, thought maybe they meant something about signal or power degradation over the line.

Miracast pros: No need for a router or devices to be on the same network. Screen mirroring happens through wifi direct.   Miracast cons: Pretty large lag/delay, phone's display needs to stay on to mirror, turning display off causes the cast to go black. Battery drain is huge.

Chromecast works because you plug it in and it connects to your wifi and lets you stream from a PC or tablet.   You could use miracast, but chromecast works pretty well and is reasonably cheap.  Why get an app you have to pay for monthly. If you have a smart tv with internet access chances are it already has a youtube/netflix/etc app, and if not chromecast doesn't come with a monthly cost for specific channels."

Chromecast,3daczj,krantus,28,Tue Jul 14 19:05:56 2015 UTC,"I read that as Emmy voters would receive a limited edition Chromecast dongle in the mail.  From the source article:   Per the new deal, screeners will be available on a members-only website and streaming app via the tiny USB drives.   ""This multi-year commitment with Google will provide a superior experience for viewing Emmy-nominated content,"" said academy president and COO Maury McIntyre. ""It also gives our members a great way to view programming across their devices year-round.""   If the author called it a USB drive, does he even understand what a Chromecast is and how it works? He may be interpreting it wrong. I don't think these Chromecasts will have some exclusive app stored internally on the dongle. I think they're just handing out Chromecasts and then asking voters to log into a private website and use an exclusive app. I don't think anything specific about the Chromecasts is locked/whitelisted to avoid piracy, although that'd be a neat security measure. But then the COO specified ""across their devices""... I take that as ""across a voter's many devices like phones, tablets, laptops, etc."" and not ""across all our voters' Chromecast devices"". I think they're just locking content behind an exclusive streaming service and sending out a Chromecast instead of a bunch of DVDs.  EDIT: engadget article with link to press release from Emmys.com   ""Chromecast provides members with the option to enhance the viewing experience of Emmy-nominated content as the Academy launches its new, members-only, online viewing platform. The thumb-sized, media-streaming Chromecast devices enable members to ""cast"" videos from the Television Academy mobile apps and viewing website directly to the big screen in their homes.""   So the Academy is just launching a streaming service for people to watch the content instead of mailing out easily rippable DVDs. The Chromecasts are just for getting it on their televisions.  Not an ""exclusive Chromecast"" but an exclusive streaming service to use with Chromecast.  This means they can track who logged in to watch what and who they voted for without handing over a physical disc or digital file that can easily be pirated. Not that this will stop piracy, but it makes it a bit harder."

It remembered its name, which was simple enough. I logged into my router and opened up my Chromecast setup app. The setup app was reporting an IP address that was wired and not wireless. So far so good! I then disabled my wifi SSID and went to a wired desktop PC to cast a YouTube video. Everything went perfectly fine.  Next, I swapped out the new ethernet plug for the old one, and once it booted up I tried casting a tab. The first try glitched to a ""connection lost"" kind of screen, but a quick second try popped right up.  So it seems to act similar to a PC, where as it'll look for wired first and then try for wireless.  EDIT: in regards to the ethernet cable being unplugged, you can unplug it and the Chromecast will do the hand-off without skipping a beat, at least with a YouTube video... tab-casting/screen-casting on the other hand may terminate some communication with the casting device"

I started the cast wired, then about 20 seconds in I unplugged the ethernet cable at the wall plug (not at the router) and the video continued playing until the end. Unless the entire 8 minute video was cached in those 20 seconds, then we can safely assume that the Chromecast lost wired connection and picked up the wireless connection in time to skip the need to pause the video to buffer.  One thing to notice, I initiated the cast on my wifi-connected laptop and it lost communication. I couldn't pause nor initiate a new cast. It just couldn't find my Chromecast anymore in the cast icon's window."

Chromecast,3d7eon,DatOpenSauce,4,Tue Jul 14 07:42:26 2015 UTC,"So here's what happened in my neighborhood. Cincinnati Bell came in about 6 months ago and started offering their ""Fioptics"" service. This is pretty awesome actually so I'm not really complaining about that part of it. However, part of Fioptics a television offering. But they do the TV part really weird. They install an extra wifi router that's locked down in the home with TV that does just the TVs, and wifi recievers (external ones, at that) to all the TV boxes someone orders.   I'm guessing they do this so that the installers don't have to muck around with configuring a client network. The installer that put mine in told me that this was the only way these systems would work because they were special routers. That, of course, was BS, as I've since configured mine by plugging it directly into the wired network. But I figure they tell the installers to say that so people don't muck around with them too much and call customer support to fix.   On top of that, they also install their special router to the home. Now, this router isn't too bad, it also comes with wireless and is a pretty decent firewall unit. However, most people just use this router as if it's just a bridge and plug in the wifi router they bought from Microcenter into it and run their devices off of this (double-NAT, YAY!). It is interesting to note that many of my neighbors ordered gigabit service and have nothing but 802.11b/g devices using it. LOL.   Most of the homes in my network are running not one, not two, but three separate 2.4ghz wifi routers. And these homes are wood frame, so the spectrum penetrates pretty well. What you end up with is a big crowded mess, mostly broadcasting the ""ZyxelXXXX"" SSID.   My house is mostly hard wired. It's a fairly professional style job, with Cat6 to each room down to a patch panel in the basement with a rack mounted 24 port gigabit switch. Yeah, overkill, but the network works REALLY GOOD in my house as long as you're not on 2.4ghz.   Other than the chromecasts (which yes I could do with a bridge to 5ghz but its easier for me just to plug directly into wired ethernet) the only devices in my home that don't talk 5ghz that aren't wired are things like the PS Vita. Heck even all our cell phones can talk 5ghz.   I suspect that most devices will start migrating over there as more things happen like in my neighborhood. I like 5ghz not as much for the speed as much as the fact that it's not as pervasive as 2.4 ghz, even if all my neighbors went out and configured 5ghz routers it doesn't travel as far, so you won't get as inundated with signals ever.   From my house I can currently see -37- WAPs broadcasting 2.4ghz, and -2- 5ghz signals (including my own).  tldr; shit is crowded yo."

I tend to prefer wired connections, generally, so other must-be-wireless devices have an easier time. This purchase was more about insurance in case of poor/no wifi on the road.

I think previously people had used the wifi connection on their laptop to connect to the Chromecast while using ethernet to plug into the hotel's network. So kind of a flipflop there.  Maybe if you plug the adapter into the hotel's ethernet port, you can turn on Guest Mode and cast without the need for a middle-man device like a router, laptop, or tablet to cast from a smartphone."

Chromecast,3d7eon,RParkerMU,2,Tue Jul 14 07:15:08 2015 UTC,"The framerate for me sucks. I got on a wired desktop (Intel Core2, 6GB RAM) and screencast while displaying a particle effects demo for IE11. It runs decent on the machine's monitor in the other room, but when I come out into the living room, it's running at 3 fps. I even dropped it down from ""High 720p"" cast quality to ""Standard 480p"". No change.  When I switched to tab-casting, then the flash demo opened up fine on the Chromecast, and it looks to be the same framerate as on my wired PC.  So I would still not recommend Chromecast as a wireless display option, even when wired. It's definitely something with the Cast protocol not being on par with Miracast or AirPlay for mirroring. The Chromecast works better as a remotely-controlled browser tab and stream-fetcher."

Not sure how this would make it better since it's already over wifi? Or does the Chromecast talk to the internet source, and not my iPhone? (sorry if that's a very basic question to the chromecast)"
Chromecast,3d7eon,neoblackdragon,2,Tue Jul 14 17:11:44 2015 UTC,"This can get a little complex if I don't simplify this to one example.  YouTube.  You open the YouTube app on your iPhone. You pick a video. You tap the cast icon. Your phone then sends the video's ID over wifi to your router, and the router forwards that video ID to the Chromecast over wifi. Your Chromecast gets the video ID and then fetches the video from YouTube's servers (Chromecast sends a request back over wifi to the router, which the router then forwards out to the internet through your modem). Then YouTube sends the video stream to your house, and the router then sends the video to the Chromecast over wifi.  Your iPhone is a remote. In general, what you see on TV never tunnels through your casting device. This is what makes the Chromecast different than just simply mirroring the screen. This is why you can do other things on your phone. And this is why it doesn't use up your capped mobile data. You connect it to your home network for more than just communication with casting devices. You're connecting it to your home network to use your home's broadband connection.  Now things are different if you have an Android device and use LocalCast/AllCast/etc. to cast locally stored content, but I will avoid that conversation right now.  Now, this adapter will replace the Chromecasts's wifi connection with a cable. More reliable, better throughput. For some people, their wifi signal to the Chromecast is not strong or the frequencies are crowded in their area."

Chromecast,3d34c8,ComputerJerk,2,Mon Jul 13 10:54:01 2015 UTC,"I'm absolutely certain it isn't a connectivity fault in so far as Wifi interference and such. It seems to be localised to particular applications and their inability to maintain their syncs with the Chromecast.  For example, I can get it to repro reliably with Netflix but have never had the problem with NowTV.   There's been a lot of changes recently to Chromecast and Chromecast supported apps (especially YouTube) which has resulted in much worse stability overall."
Chromecast,3d34c8,36ed0,0,Mon Jul 13 11:02:19 2015 UTC,"Interesting, perhaps it's the routing from your ISP to said services. I know some carrier e.g. VZ fios have been known to throttle Netflix.           My troubleshooting nature wants to tell you to perhaps try tethering from your phone and connecting the chrome cast to that, but that might be more trouble than it's worth"
Chromecast,3d34c8,ComputerJerk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:11:54 2015 UTC,"I don't understand what about the issue I described indicates a connectivity issue to you?   To me it's pretty clear that the app (on my phone) and the app (on the Chromecast) are falling out of sync, then when the phone sends the volume adjust command to the Chromecast it's causing a software level fault to occur effectively making it CTD.  It's probably something silly like my phone's global volume setting (generally silent) is being piped into the Chromecast volume control (generally max) and some part of that is causing the application to explode on receipt of the bad info.  Either way Chromecast application stability has been shite these last few months, I don't know what Google (esp. YouTube) are playing at but they're shooting themselves in the foot with every update."

Chromecast,3d8ea6,kiwidog,0,Tue Jul 14 11:29:03 2015 UTC,You are missing the point - the cc would not be physically connected to the main router via an ethernet cable.  It would be connected to a stand-alone router and the two routers communicate using the lesser used 5gHz band rather than having to use the congested 2.5 GHZ band. The CC itself would think it is connected to the main router via ethernet of course.

Chromecast,3d1bl2,qdhcjv,2,Sun Jul 12 18:51:44 2015 UTC,"Mostly but not entirely accurate, I think.  I use a US Chromecast in Europe and it works fine except for one tiny detail - it can't connect to Wifi if I'm using Channel 12 or 13 on my router. There are slightly different regulations throughout the world and the US has fewer available channels - you can see a list here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels  I noticed this one day when the Chromecast wouldn't connect to Wifi, and after searching around I discovered it was indeed because my router was set to automatic mode and had chosen channel 13 at that particular time.  Unless there is a way to enable these extra channels in the Chromecast that I don't know about? (It already knows I'm in Europe, as it shows local time etc)"

Chromecast,3d1bl2,JimboLodisC,0,Sun Jul 12 23:53:01 2015 UTC,The USB port on the TV is a service port.   I cringed reading that.  https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/3212934?hl=en&ref_topic=3058948   Do not plug the USB cable into a port labeled 'Service'; it must be labeled 'USB' or display the USB symbol.
Chromecast,3d1bl2,thagthebarbarian,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:00:05 2015 UTC,Their lack of why annoys me. Is there a reason beyond it not being USB standard? Considering that USB standard is only .5a anyway.  Do they fear damage to the TV or the Chromecast
Chromecast,3d1bl2,JimboLodisC,0,Mon Jul 13 00:03:20 2015 UTC,"Damage to the TV and/or the Chromecast. Service ports often have pins switched around, so you don't know how they wired that port.  At least with a USB logo, you know it's meant for USB devices. Just because it looks like a normal USB port doesn't mean the OEM uses it as such.  Like I said, if you're not having issues, then maybe you're lucky. I would advise anyone to just head straight for the wall for power, though. It's reliable, plentiful, and designed to work properly with whatever you plug into it."

We've published a new Android app for Chromecast with which you can set a freshwater fish tank as the live background for your TV (You can pick from 2 fish tanks with audio).  It's a paid app ($0.99). We'd appreciate if you can try it out. Available for Android at:   Google Play Store   The iOS version is on its way.  This is how it'll look on your TV:   http://i.imgur.com/OrKp3W8.png http://i.imgur.com/0SDMpqV.png   Features:   Cast high quality live backgrounds to your TV - you can pick from two lively fish tanks. Freshwater fishes, just like you'd usually have in a home aquarium. These are not streamed from the internet and so, you can keep the live backgrounds running for hours without wasting your network bandwidth. Once loaded, there are no buffering delays while watching the fishtanks. The live background will keep showing even after you disconnect your phone or tablet (Tap the 'Exit app on TV' button to quit the application on your TV) - you can think of these as Chromecast screensavers. No ads, no lags. Just fullscreen fish tanks on the TV! The fish tanks also have realistic background audio (Tap 'Menu' and then 'Toggle Audio' to mute/unmute).   So go ahead, make your TV a fish tank! :-)  If you find any issues, please let us know - we would really appreciate it and do our best to fix them! Thanks!﻿"

Chromecast,3ctshm,dublued,3,Sat Jul 11 01:20:03 2015 UTC,"Wow, didn't realize it wasn't there any more. Bummer."
Chromecast,3ctshm,furious_20,2,Sat Jul 11 02:53:19 2015 UTC,It was lost in the major update that split photos from Google+. I hope they bring it back soon as well.
Chromecast,3ctshm,furious_20,11,Sat Jul 11 17:10:00 2015 UTC,"I got this update early this am but was too lazy to post it to this sub. Works well enough, but I just don't have many slideshows in my own drive account (I'm a teacher and have several in my work account)."
Chromecast,3ctshm,furious_20,10,Fri Jul 10 20:46:00 2015 UTC,"When chromecast first came out, I gave little presentations pretty regularly and really wanted to be able to get a Chromecast at work and present them that way.  I don't do that much anymore (thank goodness), but this seems like such an obvious way to present Slides presentations."
Chromecast,3ctshm,DoctorSteve,7,Fri Jul 10 20:48:27 2015 UTC,I agree; this was long overdue in my opinion.
Chromecast,3ctshm,volen,6,Fri Jul 10 20:58:43 2015 UTC,"I am with you. But at the same time I sure hope no one casts something during the presentation, or that you can get it on at work!  Or it doesn't disconnect cause Chromecast can be stupid."
Chromecast,3ctshm,ryantiger658,2,Fri Jul 10 23:46:33 2015 UTC,"That's a very good point. I hope that if it disconnects it will keep showing the presentation and you only have to reconnect. Kinda like Netflix, but if haven't tried it out either."

Chromecast,3ctshm,StandingBehindMyNose,3,Fri Jul 10 22:48:03 2015 UTC,Yay for cheap digital signage!
Chromecast,3ctshm,justjcarr,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:11:04 2015 UTC,Have you tried this for digital signage? Do you know if after starting a slide show it will continue to run unattended on the Chromecast?
Chromecast,3ctshm,specfreq,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:44:45 2015 UTC,I haven't yet. You should though. Previously I would publish Google slides presentations to the Web and cast them from a browser but it would randomly stop after a while. Looping the slide show wasn't a problem though.
Chromecast,3ctshm,specfreq,3,Sat Jul 11 13:38:16 2015 UTC,Now we just need Google Docs and Google Sheets
Chromecast,3ctshm,agentlame,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:56:09 2015 UTC,Why would you cast a spreadsheet?
Chromecast,3ctshm,notsurewhatiam,2,Sat Jul 11 00:59:16 2015 UTC,So I could read it better
Chromecast,3ctshm,Lobanium,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:05:51 2015 UTC,Charts and graphs?
Chromecast,3ctshm,bunkyprewster,0,Sat Jul 11 13:47:55 2015 UTC,"At work we used this for live updating digital signage, but we do it by casting a tab which isn't that reliable.  Chromecast support on Sheets would be a life saver for me."
Chromecast,3ctshm,twistedcain,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:32:25 2015 UTC,And add it back to Photos.
Chromecast,3ctshm,ProfDoctorMrSaibot,3,Sat Jul 11 01:35:18 2015 UTC,Could you read your notes on your phone while the slides advanced on the TV?
Chromecast,3ctshm,prnorm,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:58:00 2015 UTC,Yep. You can see the current slide and either presenter notes or the next slide.
Chromecast,3ctshm,Malik_Killian,2,Sat Jul 11 12:55:31 2015 UTC,"Zoho Show has the ability to ""broadcast"" slide shows over the web. So you give people a url, and they can watch you present your slides in real time with notes and the ability to chat. I REALLY REALLY REALLY wish Google Slides would add this feature. Would also be handy for spreadsheets and their word processor."

I'm naturally still skeptical; but any progress makes me happy!"
Chromecast,3cu238,slevinkelevra15,3,Sat Jul 11 01:28:08 2015 UTC,"Hope this fixes it. Had people over and it was embarrassing having YouTube constantly stop playing, play the previous song, not queue, load slow. Come on Google! Why you do this to me?"
Chromecast,3cu238,FuuurSuuure,2,Sat Jul 11 06:31:08 2015 UTC,"I'll have to try later, I got an update a few hours ago, but my daughter is gaming right now on our main TV so I can't test it."
Chromecast,3cu238,furious_20,2,Fri Jul 10 21:17:33 2015 UTC,"I've tried it and so far it's the best version of YouTube for Chromecast. The playback controls work instantly, the TV queue just works, and if it has to reconnect it does it very quickly."

Chromecast,3cu238,brontosaurus_vex,-3,Sat Jul 11 21:04:17 2015 UTC,"PSA: The Chromecast app for YouTube and how it functions is not a result of any update to the Android app. They're two separate apps, so an update to the Android app does not necessarily mean the CC app got updated.     Noticed a lot of people saying the CC app was acting slow and crappy recently because of a recent Android app update. That's not how it works."
Chromecast,3cu238,QuestionsEverythang,5,Sat Jul 11 03:36:59 2015 UTC,"The problems aren't with Chromecast though, it's the commands the phone app is sending. So an update does make a difference."
Chromecast,3cu238,FNFollies,3,Sat Jul 11 16:07:24 2015 UTC,"I know the CC has a small wrapper (?) for Youtube running but fundamentally, the Android app is the one telling that wrapper how to behave, no?"
Chromecast,3cs1hs,SamDecrock,5,Fri Jul 10 08:43:54 2015 UTC,I imagine this would be even better paired with something that can pretend to be an AirPlay target and pipe the audio over to the Chromecast app.
Chromecast,3cs1hs,AndrewNeo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:11:35 2015 UTC,"maybe you can have an android phone running an airplay receiver like airbubble, then mirror to chromecast"

Chromecast,3cs1hs,mapin,4,Mon Jul 13 11:46:23 2015 UTC,I wonder what the audio quality is like... does it stay bit-perfect or does it compress when streaming?
Chromecast,3cs1hs,ovi2k1,3,Fri Jul 10 14:51:11 2015 UTC,"Or you can create a free Google music account, upload your library (for free) and cast it directly from there without making fake speakers and microphones.  Added benefit there is you now have access to your entire library anywhere you are near a device with an internet connection."

Chromecast,3cs1hs,ovi2k1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:10:41 2015 UTC,"It might, but you only have to do it once and then it will continue to watch that folder for any new songs and upload them automatically. And you can store up to, I think, 50,000 songs. I'm right there with you on the iPod classic though!"
Chromecast,3cs1hs,cloudsdrive,2,Fri Jul 10 20:58:52 2015 UTC,"Or just install Google play music manager, which will upload it all to Google's cloud, allowing you to play it any time and anywhere, including your Chromecast."

Chromecast,3ctajp,ferrarimclaren12,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:29:56 2015 UTC,It's likely that VLC has the necessary code to output a remote display - before the introduction of the Chromecast this was generally HDMI out - my understanding of the screen cast functionality is that it takes the same display that a HDMI signal would take and wirelessly sends it to the Chromecast.

Chromecast,3cl438,dino0986,5,Thu Jul 9 01:42:49 2015 UTC,Yeah.   Seems like you could hack your own together with an ordinary USB Ethernet adapter and a USB Y-cable that passes power from the wall charger to both the Chromecast and the Ethernet adapter while passing data from the Ethernet adapter to the Chromecast. I don't think that's usually how the Y-cables are setup but you could solder several cables together to achieve this.  They must have added the OTG support in one of the recent firmware updates.

So in the USA you should only use channels 1, 6, or 11. Using any other channel will result in more interference and worse network for you and for your neighbors."
Chromecast,3cl438,truthusd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:28:38 2015 UTC,"That strategy only helps if every other device in range also does the same. If anything uses any other channels (which always happens), the entire benefit is lost for everybody."
Chromecast,3cl438,BadgerRush,0,Fri Jul 10 07:51:48 2015 UTC,"As long as the assholes using other channels are the minority it still helps. E.g. in my apartment building we have (not counting the really weak ones I can barely see):   ~3 networks on channel 1 (including mine) Asshole A on channel 4 (interfering with channel 1 and channel 6) ~5 networks on channel 6 Asshole B on channel 9 (interfering with channel 6 and channel 11) ~4 networks on channel 11   So my networks share a channel with 2 others, and receives interference from 1 other. On the other hand, Asshole A receives interference from 8 different networks (his noise floor must be very high), so by choosing channel 4 he makes my life a bit worse (I get more noise when he is using his net), but also makes his life a lot worse (he gets noise every time anyone in any of those 8 networks transmit anything)."
Chromecast,3cl438,truthusd,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:02:13 2015 UTC,"The airwaves around my home are much more crowded than that - there are a half-dozen ""assholes"" at any time.

Chromecast,3cl438,BadgerRush,0,Fri Jul 10 16:25:45 2015 UTC,"If the neighborhood is a complete mess, then I would probably give preference to channel 1 or channel 11, this way at least you get interference from only 4 other channels (as opposed to interference from 8 different channels if you chose a ""mid"" channel like 5, 6 or 7 for example), and the added bonus of still keeping to the standard rule."
Chromecast,3cl438,truthusd,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:13:51 2015 UTC,"You should do a bit more research. The Cisco study that the whole theory of 1, 6, 11 is based on was not at all about this kind of situation, and the interpretations of the study that keep being thrown around as justification are flawed. Basically that study was about setting up a situation where you control every router in range, and it just doesn't apply when you don't.  Have you seen any other studies that support this theory other than that single one by Cisco?  In short, don't blindly accept the dogma - test it yourself. I have, and I don't use 1, 6 nor 11 as a result. YMMV."

Chromecast,3cl438,JimboLodisC,5,Wed Jul 8 20:52:25 2015 UTC,"have you looked at the device? it's an injector that plugs into a standard 120v outlet. you then plug an ethernet cable into the plug, and it sends your power and network signal over one usb cable."

Chromecast,3cl438,JimboLodisC,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:35:38 2015 UTC,Not many enterprise level companies use Apple products tho - that's wicked expensive.  My company just bought a handful of Chromecasts to try out.  I expect more to come.
Chromecast,3cl438,tvtb,-1,Thu Jul 9 03:16:11 2015 UTC,"Ok, so bypass plugging into a power outlet and just run PoE? I don't understand why that's hard to understand. You would have one cable running to the Chromecast, basically a ethernet to USB adapter. For this you run Ethernet to wall jack, then USB from wall jack to Chromecast."
Chromecast,3cl438,ProfitOfRegret,3,Wed Jul 8 21:27:19 2015 UTC,"Not saying PoE for Chromecast isn't practical, just that it's not practical in this accessory.  I guess in a perfect world, there'd be one adapter that accomplishes everything, but cost-wise it'd make more sense to sell a separate accessory that would handle PoE needs. It'd likely just be a small microUSB<->Ethernet adapter without the wall wart components jutting out the side like a tumor.  But then again I don't think most consumer routers even do PoE. Remember, this device is targeted and marketed to living rooms.  Also, what's the max amperage that PoE can provide? Cuz the wall plug is able to provide 850mA when requested."
Chromecast,3cl438,grink,3,Wed Jul 8 22:29:52 2015 UTC,802.3af PoE can do 15W; 802.3at PoE+ can do 25W. This would use 5W or less.

Chromecast,3cl438,AlexMeanberg,7,Wed Jul 8 21:50:02 2015 UTC,100Mbps can easily transport HD video. Netflix tops out at a scant 5Mbps. Even Blu-ray tops out at 54Mbps for video+audio. Gigabit is only needed for bulk file transfers. Also a gigabit chipset would increase cost on a device whose appeal is largely because of low price.
Chromecast,3cl438,amfjani,3,Wed Jul 8 22:20:06 2015 UTC,"Especially when you're not multi-tasking on the connection. The Chromecast is only pulling down a video stream.

Chromecast,3cl438,AlexMeanberg,4,Wed Jul 8 22:41:40 2015 UTC,"USB 2.0 is slightly faster (in actual throughput) than 100bT but way below 1000bT.  That said, there is a little speed lost in the adapter and you are left more or less with the best you are going to get and for a decent price at that.

I've got 4  chromecasts set up for audio streaming, but had a few duds along the way, as they say, there are compatibility problems, particularly with the audio extractors that are powered from the HDMI interface. I really wish Google had made this themselves.  It seems like Google designed the Chromecast with only the TV use case in mind. That's reflected in the apparent assumption that volume will be controlled at the amplifier. Most of us using powered speakers would prefer leaving them at 100% and controlling the input volume, but chromecasts default to 100% volume and can't be turned down until the stream starts playing, 100% input level + 100% amplifier level = very loud blast of music!"

None of my amps have remotes, one doesn't even have a volume control, the others are tucked away. For casting, both audio and video, it makes more sense to control 100% from my casting device, but the Chromecast design use cases seem to presume otherwise."

Over HDMI the volume is fine, but I have the extractor listen in the top comment and the volume is MUCH lower than when its hooked to HDMI.   I can turn the volume up on the amps, its not that big of a deal, but here is the issue:  My Audiosource amps have a ""auto on"" feature that detects audio and powers on and off. If i turn CC volume down, it shuts off because the signal is so weak coming out of the extractor.

It might help people looking at your device to know that it's not quite as convenient as just slapping a CC into one of your adapters and boom, ready to go--but that they're also going to need a free electrical outlet nearby.

There's no easy explanation that someone can give you in a few sentences that will spell out everything you need to know. But essentially you have two choices: 1. Sign up for a VPN service, get yourself a router that supports setting up a VPN in the router (e.g., one with DD-WRT or Tomato firmware), and make sure that both the casting device and the Chromecast are going through the VPN on the router. 2. Set up an unblocking DNS service in your router, block Google DNS in your router (e.g., by using the static-route-to-nowhere method), and make sure that both the casting device and your Chromecast are getting their DNS addresses from your router. Don't forget to flush the DNS cache after every change of DNS or region.

You can set up PC as a wifi hotspot  (http://www.7tutorials.com/how-turn-your-windows-81-laptop-wifi-access-point)  also available for windows 7.   set up wifi hotspot, and connect  CC to hotspot.  connect PC to VPN. connect a mobile/tablet to hotspot and connect to netflix usa (say() and cast.   I actually use Connectify Max as it does all the steps needed for above with no effort (not free but not that expensive).  Note: avoid free vpn services like HOLA as they have security issues - to be fair I can't say this is true for all free vpn services but not sure the risk is worth it when there are good vpn services for only a few £/$ per month."

Chromecast,3cheag,karnim,2,Wed Jul 8 05:52:09 2015 UTC,I really think it was a few parts.    1) Apple paid them lots of money for exclusivity so they could get rid of all their old Apple TVs   2) As they were unsure how many people would be interested it was smarter to do a phased rollout to make sure their hardware could handle the demand.    3) They knew they'd have a big jump in subscribers due to Game of Thrones but that turns into a negative to their bosses on Wall Street if many of them leave two months later.  A staggered rollout has a much better chance of showing steady growth instead of a spike.

Using a range extender with the exact same SSID is nothing but trouble.  It'll cause errors like this all of the time.    My recommendation is to change the SSID on the range extender and have both the phone and chromecast connect to that.  I'd bet that would fix not only your chromecast/phone connection woes, but all the other lost connection issues you're having."

Chromecast,3ck180,topherkeey,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:49:41 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm aware, the Chromecast only ""remembers"" one wifi SSID, so unfortunately you'd have to re-setup the Chromecast when moving between rooms.    As far as increasing your Wifi range, I currently use the Asus RT-AC66U Dual-Band Wireless-AC1750 Gigabit Router.  It replaced an aging Linksys WRT54GL router which was having trouble with overheating in the summer months.  I found that this one gave me better coverage throughout the house.  I actually supported eero when they had a kickstarter.  It's an interesting wifi solution which basically uses specially-engineered range extenders that actually extend (not replicate) the wifi signal.  They call it a ""mesh network"" and it's not supposed to have the negative downsides that traditional extenders have (like you're experiencing).  It's quite expensive, however, but it was much cheaper when it was on kickstarter.  I'm still awaiting my delivery, which should come sometime in August (unless there are more delays).  I hope it works!  ps. I'm in no way affiliated with eero, I just thought it was a neat solution that I hope works as advertised."

Chromecast,3ck6h9,geeezzuzz,3,Wed Jul 8 15:30:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd say no.  Using the Chromecast on Android is nice, and most apps let you control it from the lock screen (I use Plex and Netflix from my Nexus 7).  Using the Chromecast from my iPhone on the otherhand is a test in patience.  Neither Netflix or Plex integrate with the media controls on the lock screen or ""pull-up"" menu, so I need to open the app each time and wait for it to load & reconnect to the Chromecast in order control the media.  Sometimes the reconnection fails or hangs, in which case I can't even pause the media.  /u/JimboLodisC asks if you had to pick between a Chromecast or AppleTV, if you're using only Apple stuff and are only looking for Netflix, get the AppleTV if you can.  It's very nice IMO, but it doesn't have the wide range of app support that Chromecast has.  If you're deciding strictly between Roku and Chromecast, I'd say get the Roku honestly unless you have an Android device to use it with."
Chromecast,3ck6h9,creepynut,2,Wed Jul 8 17:12:37 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely a little cautious to recommend the Chromecast here since OP makes it sound like a reliable remote control method is a priority for him. Not that I've had many issues, but I know others have.  And you cannot beat a physical remote. It'll always work as long as the batteries have juice.  Plus an AppleTV just works so well with iOS and other Apple products. Plus you can mirror an iPhone to an AppleTV but not to a Roku or Chromecast, so that's a feature that would be missing. Whether he uses that or not might not be relevant right now, but there may come a point where he would like to and he'll come back to this sub and post ""how to screencast from iphone???"""

What's that you say, you can't find the hidden door? Keep looking, it's somewhere around the ""h"" in Chrome. Or is it the ""e""? Just kidding. You need a little humor to cheer you up, because it's not possible to get surround sound from your Chromecast to your Philips audio system. The Philips HTB5520 is a low-end integrated sound/disc-player system that doesn't have HDMI inputs - and the Chromecast only outputs audio over HDMI. What you can do is hook up an audio output from your TV to the Philips sound system (either digital optical or just analog stereo). That way you can use the Philips sound system for any source that's playing on the TV, such as the Chromecast. Unfortunately even if you have a digital audio output from the TV, it won't output surround sound from an HDMI input source, only stereo. That's one of the those silly DRM measures. But it will probably sound much better than your TV's built-in speakers, so maybe that's all you really want."

Chromecast,3cbhbd,Brad_1,12,Mon Jul 6 16:45:52 2015 UTC,"You should understand a little about how DHCP works. When you first turn on or connect a device on your local network, it broadcasts a DHCP request to get its network settings. The DHCP server on your network (normally your router)  responds and tells it: 1. The local IP address to use 2. The IP address of the internet gateway (normally also your router) 3. The DNS addresses to use 4. The lease period (time to next refresh) The device will then use those DNS addresses until its lease expires or it otherwise needs to refresh its settings (usual default lease is about 24 hours). Even if you subsequently change the DNS addresses in your router, it won't necessarily refresh them on all the devices that still have a lease running on their existing values. If you have two routers in sequence (as you do), the DHCP server is normally the one that your device is connected to, but not necessarily - you should check on that. Make sure the DHCP server option is enabled in your router, and that you are using a separate subnet range from the BT router. Normally the devices and computers on your LAN get the DNS addresses to use from the router, which in turn gets them from your ISP. But if the device or computer allows you to change those values, there's nothing stopping you from selecting the ""static"" option instead of ""automatic"" or ""DHCP"" and setting your own DNS values on that individual device. When you do it that way, it's non-expiring - it lasts until you change it. But not every device provides that option. So what you need to do is look at the DNS values on your computer (or whichever device you are checking on) to see what values it is using, and figure out where it's getting them from. And then you will need to make sure that your Chromecast can get those same values via DHCP, because it doesn't allow any other option. You will also have to figure out how to block Google DNS in your router, because the Chromecast is hard-coded to use Google DNS by default. It only falls back to using the DHCP-supplied DNS values if it can't reach Google DNS."
Chromecast,3cbhbd,DPAmes1,2,Mon Jul 6 17:42:43 2015 UTC,What is the make and model of the router?  I am sure there is a way to get the admin password for the router to change the DNS setting.

Chromecast,3cbhbd,danskeman,2,Mon Jul 6 21:17:57 2015 UTC,"There are two ways of connecting a new router to old router.  For clarity most router have 4 lan ports typically (often yellow) and 1 WAN (also called adsl sometimes) port.  The wan port on main router will be connected to your telephone socket.   Lan (main) to Lan (new) - connect lan to lan using ethernet. In this way, if main router had a LAN IP as 192.168.0.1 say, new router needs a STATIC address  say 192.168.0.2 (outside the DHCP range).  You need to turn off DHCP on new router, and change dns settings on new router to the smart dns settings. LAN(main) to WAN (new). In this mode, new router has a different subnet LAN IP address e.g. 192.168.1.2 (not 0.2) You set WAN to be dynamic i.e. pick up IP from main router. You leave DHCP on in this mode.   In both ways, you change ssid of wifi on router to be different from main router.  No changes are needed to main router."
Chromecast,3cbhbd,danskeman,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:59:44 2015 UTC,I tried this (1st) way but it wasn't using the DNS from the new router
Chromecast,3cbhbd,LecheConCarnie,2,Tue Jul 7 17:07:52 2015 UTC,"Before you give up, have you tried simply putting new DNS settings on PC or tablet/phone wifi settings (forget CC for the time being).    Try connecting to netflix usa (say) from a web browser.  This would test if the main router is not allowing the new dns settings to pass through (as most should).  I am not aware that BT would not allow you to pass through DNS settings, but some ISPs have been know to block such things.  Also another check - modern BT hubs have a smart wifi setting that is known to interfere with things - maybe you should try and switch that off?  Finally, a silly question perhaps - you are connecting to the new router via its own wifi ssid?"
Chromecast,3cbhbd,Furah,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:06:08 2015 UTC,"I suspect the second router will still go through the main router and that may be causing problems.

Chromecast,3cbhbd,spopinski,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:00:36 2015 UTC,I'm not sure doing this with a BT router is possible.
Chromecast,3cbhbd,spopinski,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:13:31 2015 UTC,"It is. ISPs will almost always tell people they have to use their approved devices, because they likely cannot help you with problems with other devices. I always use my own network devices, and never had an issue on ADSL, mobile broadband, or FTTP. The main reason that ISP-provided devices are easy to set up is because they come preconfigured to connect via your account."
Chromecast,3cbhbd,spopinski,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:33:33 2015 UTC,Test first with your phone or laptop to choose your second router as the DNS server. See if it works. Don't forget to set the 2nd router as the dhcp server.  The router from your ISP should be only talking with the internet AND your second router and nothing else.  If that works then you can basically route all the dns requests to your second router.
Chromecast,3cbhbd,spopinski,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:02:47 2015 UTC,Hi could you explain how to set my laptop to the use the DNS from the second router? I've not done anything like this before.
Chromecast,3cbhbd,spopinski,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:13:18 2015 UTC,"First you set up the second router in a different subnet for all your devices.  If your first router is 192.168.1.1 then your second router should have two IPs.  One to talk to your first router, probably 192.168.1.2 as the internet address depending on what the first router setting. Then for your home network you set it up as 192.168.2.1 or whatever and set it as dhcp server. You set the dns here too.  So all your devices will take ip from this second router only. And the range should be 192.168.2.xxx Set the dns server on the device to test to 192.168.2.1 as in your secondary router.  It will work as I've done this before."
Chromecast,3cbhbd,duepointe,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:27:50 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for your reply. I can't for the life of me find out how to change the first IP for it to talk to my first router. I think I know where to change the second IP along with the DHCP adresses (in LAN setup). Where I set the IP to 192.168.2.1 with DCHP from .2 - .64 but with these settings the internet doesn't work. When I set it to 192.168.1.1 (master router is on 1.254) with DCHP set same as above it works fine but the DNS settings doesn't apply.
Chromecast,3cbhbd,duepointe,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:41:01 2015 UTC,"The first IP is your internet address. If you can find the internet connection type setting in your secondary router then you can choose static or dhcp for it.  Also set the gateway to the master router.  So in the master you can leave all default settings.  In the secondary router the ip for the internet connection should be on the same subnet with the master router, check the default gateway it should also pint to the master router. The dhcp should be on a different subnet, hence the 2.xxx  On the devices, the ip should be given by the secondary router, the gateway and the dns addresses should also point to the secondary router."

Chromecast,3c9olt,trezor2,-1,Mon Jul 6 10:09:15 2015 UTC,"If he has no wifi at home, I think the solution to his problem should be fairly obvious: Just get a god damn wifi API :)  AFAIK the chromecast is discovered via local network multicast, so when the PC and the Chromecast are on different tethering devices (Wifi vs USB) I'm going to assume it's not going to work.  Even with both connected to the same tethering device (wifi), there's no guarantee that the Android Wifi AP implements 802.11 shared-mode and routing, meaning devices on the tethered network may not be able to discover each other nor intercommunicate.  Basically, chances are less than 1% this is ever going to work in any hacky config, and the work involved in getting it working (through routing, iptables, dnsmasq, build-your-own-router-inside-android) would more than pay for a cheap, shitty wifi AP."

Exception to rule: If you are using the phone as a wifi hotspot/tether device and the chromecast is connecting to that SSID.  Do you have another device - a laptop or tablet - that you can put in a similar location to see if it can stream without problems?  Also - you should have something on your phone like a ""cellular data used this billing period"" - make a note of what it says, start a movie, and check it again in half an hour.

And you mention the Chromecast is plugged into the TV. I'm going to guess you meant for power, because obviously it'd be plugged into the TV's HDMI port for viewing. Don't use the TV's USB port as a source of power for the Chromecast. Those ports were never meant to provide power to anything other than a flash drive (if at all... it could be a diagnostic port and not even in spec with USB standards).

Chromecast,3c8ngz,JimboLodisC,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:40:27 2015 UTC,"Okay so this is more specifically a question of ""how do I get _______ website to cast from my iPad""  The way it currently reads, it sounds like nothing is working for you."
Chromecast,3c8ngz,JimboLodisC,0,Mon Jul 6 16:01:11 2015 UTC,Oh yea. Sorry about that. As far as I can tell no sites within chrome work to cast. Can you give me a link of one that works for you within chrome on iOS so I can test it.
Chromecast,3c8ngz,stinkybumbum,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:52:14 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I don't own any iOS devices. Someone else might be able to test the website you're trying to cast for you."
Chromecast,3c8ngz,stinkybumbum,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:55:18 2015 UTC,Oh ok thank you.
Chromecast,3c8ngz,luxtabula,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:21:04 2015 UTC,Have you downloaded the Chromecast App from the store? You need that.
Chromecast,3c8ngz,portnux,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:37:12 2015 UTC,Yes I have.
Chromecast,3c8ngz,Onemanhopefully,3,Mon Jul 6 15:40:48 2015 UTC,I was under the impression you can't cast from the Chrome Browser on iOS. Only if an app has the icon in the top corner. I might be wrong though.
Chromecast,3c8ngz,Onemanhopefully,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:47:49 2015 UTC,Yea it's supposed to work in the latest version of chrome for iOS. If the site supports casting that is. And this site does.
Chromecast,3c8ngz,portnux,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:51:08 2015 UTC,"No you're misinformed. The html5 casting implementation in chrome is still in experimental stages for the Android chrome browser. The IOS and desktop chrome browsers don't have that functionality yet. If the site you're attempting to cast is IOS compatible, check to see if there is an app version for it. Chromecast for IOS is strictly an app affair only."
Chromecast,3c8ngz,portnux,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:21:30 2015 UTC,Ok gotcha. Thanks a lot.
Chromecast,3c8ngz,torniz,0,Tue Jul 7 00:48:13 2015 UTC,Have you tried Video & TV Cast for Chromecast: Best Browser to cast and stream webvideos and local videos on TV & Displays by 2kit consulting?
Chromecast,3c61bs,greatzimkogway,21,Sun Jul 5 04:04:36 2015 UTC,Yup. I noticed an abrupt change in stability about a week or so ago.  Casting apps struggle to sync and they routinely fail to appear in the Chromecast app. One of them I noticed the other day said it could not access the internet anymore (despite the WiFi being fine.)  Localcast which has been rock solid even struggles to connect.  All the network devices have been reset and its made no difference.
Chromecast,3c61bs,kiwibloke,7,Sun Jul 5 07:49:47 2015 UTC,"Some people have been pushed to the beta channel of updates by accident after a Chromecast update from Google. They're working on a fix that should take your Chromecast out of the beta channel (and onto the stable channel) back in working order.  To check if you're on the beta channel, it looks like this—long strings of text at the bottom of your Chromecast screen. Hopefully it'll be fixed soon!"

Chromecast,3c61bs,eddywallywauw,3,Sun Jul 5 06:38:54 2015 UTC,Yes. It's very annoying. I'd love to know what's causing it.
Chromecast,3c61bs,tetroxid,3,Sun Jul 5 07:53:35 2015 UTC,"I'm mainly having issues with the casting connection being unstable. On average I'd say I can cast for about 10 minutes before it craps out. Sometimes it's closer to 10 seconds or won't cast at all.  It was never perfect, but seems like it's degraded recently."

Chromecast,3c61bs,vkny88,3,Sun Jul 5 16:39:26 2015 UTC,It's been slowly getting worse for months for me. GPM and YouTube are almost unusable... Music stops playing after a few songs and watching a video playlist keeps disconnecting and restarting on reconnect. So you can't pause or skip a video.
Chromecast,3c61bs,Stark_Tony,2,Sun Jul 5 17:07:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, within the time I was on vacation for the last 2 weeks."
Chromecast,3c61bs,charlieray,2,Sun Jul 5 11:01:56 2015 UTC,"ahh, so not just mine! Yeah, same, my units both started having stuttering video and other problems a few weeks back. Thought it was the router too since it's the only media viewer we use on 2.4 wifi. Since I had Roku's on 2 of the 3 TV's we use for viewing stuff I purchased another Roku for the third. They're hard wired so work perfectly.  Hope Google sorts out the Chromecast though, still useful for many things."

Chromecast,3c61bs,DishwasherTwig,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:40:14 2015 UTC,"I've noticed the same thing. I set a video to play and set my phone down. If I need to pause the video for any reason, even if it's 15 seconds after I set my phone down, unlocking my phone will just completely stop whatever is playing. It won't restart, it will just completely quit playback and go back to the home screen. Then, to get it back, I have to connect and disconnect my phone a few times before it will stick. And right now anything I play is on the lowest resolution and stops every few seconds. It's pretty much unusable right now for me. Up until the past week or so, it's worked completely flawlessly since I got it."
Chromecast,3c61bs,sjblake83,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:01:16 2015 UTC,"Seeing the same thing on mine. I have to set up all of my videos in one go then close the app on my phone, because any time I connect to the chromecast to do anything it just kills my videos."

Chromecast,3c6u1d,chokas,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:06:56 2015 UTC,What router/isp are you using? Last time this issue cropped up it was due to firewall settings on the router.
Chromecast,3c5tis,dysoncube,5,Sun Jul 5 02:29:14 2015 UTC,Yeah the same thing happens with me. Only way I know of fixing it is to delete the Google Play Music extension.
Chromecast,3c5tis,elephantabulous,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:38:07 2015 UTC,Delete then reinstall?
Chromecast,3c5tis,elephantabulous,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:43:45 2015 UTC,Nope just keep it uninstalled. It's a pain not having the extension but at the moment it's either that or no music at all for me.
Chromecast,3c5tis,SiliconCactus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:45:26 2015 UTC,"Are you trying to play the same song, or different ones on each device?"
Chromecast,3c5tis,Stark_Tony,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:23:17 2015 UTC,"I have this too. Sometimes it works. Most of the time it doesn't. The while Chromecast + GPM combination is such a broke experience the last few months... Casting from my Android device has various other problems, like not going to the next song. I see a lot of users having this problem. It needs to be addressed soon!"
Chromecast,3c5tis,ermaly,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:00:14 2015 UTC,"Yep have this too. The solution is to remove google play music extension. Since this is not a beta extension and should work correctly, it turns out that nobody at google team uses chromecast with google play music. They are probably thinkin whenever to switch from spotify to apple music instead of giving us a decent desktop experience (what about an....(suprise surprise) native desktop app???)."
Chromecast,3c5tis,ermaly,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:11:39 2015 UTC,"I see.  So if I delete the music extension, I can keep streaming from play music website in chrome?"
Chromecast,3c5tis,ermaly,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:32:39 2015 UTC,well the extension was just updated and it seems to work ok so far. I tried 4 songs already and it doesn't play on my mac.
Chromecast,3c77as,Rinnis,2,Sun Jul 5 14:56:13 2015 UTC,"The Chromecast itself needs a WiFi connection so no, you won't be able to use your current setup."
Chromecast,3c77as,furious_20,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:50:00 2015 UTC,"If you're asking if a wired PC can connect to a Chromecast, then yes that is possible. It's a very common configuration for a lot of people. I don't think any desktop PC owners should have to go out and buy a wifi card for their machine just to use the Chromecast.  The router is what bridges all the connections on your network together. If your wired PC is not seeing the Chromecast, it's something to do with your router.  To put it simply, any device on the same subnet as the Chromecast will be able to cast to it. So as long as you don't have things like AP isolation enabled or somehow don't have your wifi SSID and the wired portion bridged, then a wired PC should be able to see any device connected to the router."
Chromecast,3c60qa,tartarusfawkes,5,Sun Jul 5 03:57:27 2015 UTC,"MKV are not officially supported on the Chromecast. The Chromecast is not powerful enough to do software decoding of unsupported encodings. It relies on hardware decoding which means to add support for more encodings will require new hardware.  Regarding beta status, does it matter? Likely they have some goal they need to achieve along the lines of 'works at 30 fps consistently on 90% of phones' before it can be out of beta. However, if it works on your phone, it being marked as beta doesn't mean anything."
Chromecast,3c60qa,Ranek520,2,Sun Jul 5 08:27:42 2015 UTC,Look how long Gmail was in beta for.

Chromecast,3c3di3,alaasdk,13,Sat Jul 4 11:00:17 2015 UTC,I used nodejs and a library called castv2 to make a script that constantly checks what the Chromecast is casting and if it's the Backdrop then switch to our own app

Chromecast,3c3390,Crazypu,2,Sat Jul 4 08:08:16 2015 UTC,"Cool to see someone else doing something similar. I built ffproc because I needed something to make Plex casting and streaming better.   I utilized selective transcoding, so if it's already AAC audio, or h.264 video, it won't waste CPU in transcoding it. It also saves the original audio stream if it's surround sound, to preserve audio quality in movies if you ever use the files for something else.  It also supports encoding on more than one host, since my library was too big to try and transcode on one computer."
Chromecast,3c3390,magmapus,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:43:25 2015 UTC,"Have you ever seen a difference between using the different h264 levels?  By difference I mean things like faster starting of playback, quicker scrubbing, etc. I think I always use 4.1.  I'm speaking specifically about Plex > Chromecast"
Chromecast,3c3390,smiley2billion,2,Sun Jul 5 01:01:10 2015 UTC,"I haven't ever noticed any difference in scrubbing, and I've tried lots of different combinations. The Chromecast uses hardware decoding, AFAIK, so amount of decompression work doesn't seem to matter.   The biggest thing about fast playback start is enabling the fast start mov flag, so it doesn't have to seek to the end of the file to find it the info it needs."

Chromecast,3c5mh1,zachtib,6,Sun Jul 5 01:54:52 2015 UTC,"What would you propose the alternative be?  HDMI has the ability to tell the TV ""I'm playing content now, switch to me."" Aside from Chromecast I know the PS3 does this, and certainly many other things. The TV and Chromecast have no memory of what was playing  beforehand, so I'm not sure what exactly you want to happen.  In short, its the Rokus responsibility to switch the input to itself when it starts playing, not the Chromecasts to switch back when it's done."
Chromecast,3c5mh1,zachtib,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:45:31 2015 UTC,"OK, that makes sense.  I want to be able to hit ""Home"" on the Roku remote and go back to Roku.

Chromecast,3c1cxo,jfinn1319,2,Fri Jul 3 21:28:58 2015 UTC,"Fellow Canadian here. The best solution I've found for accessing out of country content is unblock-us.com. it costs 5 bucks a month and has been reliable for me for the last year and a half.   Now, the problem you're going to run into once you've got that set up is casting. Chromecasts come with Google's DNS settings hard baked in. So any custom DNS settings you've enabled in your router are going to be nullified when you cast Netflix. You'll just wind up with error messages as the Chromecast identifies your correct region and Netflix refuses to play the content.   The solution to this is to set up a static route on your router. This tells all the traffic in your house to ignore Google's DNS settings and use your custom ones instead. I used this guide and it's worked perfectly. http://help.unotelly.com/support/solutions/articles/165897- It took some doing though, so not for the technically unsavvy.   Good luck OP."

Closing chrome entirely, then going back to Netflix, select the show you want to watch, then click the cast icon.  Select the chromecast you want, then select cast Netflix.com. this seems to consistently get it to load.   As for region unblocking, I'd still appreciate some help with that"
Chromecast,3c1cxo,JimboLodisC,2,Fri Jul 3 22:21:35 2015 UTC,Region unblocking tends to have to be done at the router and is entirely dependent on whether your router allows you enough configuration options to get it to work.

Chromecast,3c1cxo,JimboLodisC,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:17:58 2015 UTC,"Your PC is on the VPN/proxy, but your Chromecast is not.  The ""random draw"" is you picking a show that's available in both USA and Canadian Netflix. Once you choose a title that is restricted to USA only, then you run into the problem.  If by ""URL casting"" you mean official cast support, then try tab-casting instead. Once you initiate the cast using the icon, click the icon again and choose ""Cast this Tab"".

Chromecast,3c0lip,mo4fun,6,Fri Jul 3 17:55:16 2015 UTC,"If it works with Youtube, it should work with everything else. There can be an issue of whether the Chromecast is visible to other devices on the WiFi network if the router is using AP Isolation (i.e., individual WiFi clients can't see each other). But if any one app can see the Chromecast, all the others should be able to as well. Are you using Youtube on the same device as the other apps that fail to see the Chromecast? Have you updated all these apps to the latest versions? Google makes frequent changes to the Chromecast firmware, and sometimes apps won't work until they have been updated too."

The concept of whatever broadcast message and any other magic they use (location, sound, etc) for finding Chromecasts might be the same but the implementation is different on YouTube. I'm guessing it isn't much different but for some reason YouTube is much better at finding Chromecasts than the SDK.

Chromecast,3c01m2,LambKyle,5,Fri Jul 3 16:19:10 2015 UTC,Yep. Chromecast will require an active Internet connection.  Tethering the Chromecast to your phone and casting as normal does sound like your best bet.  Issue you might run into is you might need to have a 3rd device to set it up as your phone will connect to the Chromecast WiFi to program it and thus turn off your tethered WiFi.
Chromecast,3c01m2,darkangelazuarl,3,Fri Jul 3 16:33:37 2015 UTC,"You don't necessarily need a working internet connection for screen mirroring or apps that do local casting. I use screen mirroring and Local Cast all the time without an internet connection. As long as the Chromecast and the phone are connected to the same network, or the Chromecast is connected to the casting phone over its WiFi hotspot, it will work without issue.

Chromecast,3c01m2,GazaIan,2,Fri Jul 3 17:36:45 2015 UTC,If you are trying to connect the Chromecast to the phones hotspot I believe you will need 2 phones to do so.  Although this would only need to be done once when configuring the Chromecast.  Using a separate WiFi connection with no internet connection and screen mirroring may run into other issues as the phone will be required to be on then same network.  If the phone attempts to use WiFi for Netflix instead of cell signal it will fail to play.  Newer phones (starting w/ lolipop??) are suppose to detect this and fall back to cellular but older phones may not.

Chromecast,3c2fm7,echobot,-1,Sat Jul 4 04:40:55 2015 UTC,"This happens a lot with technology, and all the related bits of the industry are affected.  Even down to the dipshit that tries to cram it down your throat so you leave him alone so he can go back to fronting everything on the shelves or whatever silly shit salespeople do to try and justify their existence anymore.  He either picked it up from some other dipshit that fell for a 4chan prank, or actually believed the person that told him about it being the new version, or he just made it up.  The dynamic of retail sales is such that the sales monkey has to convey certainty and cannot allow for something to undermine the validity of the bullshit he tells the customers.  You have to send the customer away with confidence in the information given to them to make their decision.  If you just happened to catch yourself making up some shit to misinform or confuse someone as a means to an end, you gotta ride that bullshit all the way to the very end of that shit track.  Derailing the shit train isn't going to get this goddamn customer away from you any sooner, and its going to ruin your essence of being some sort of expert.  Then a supervisior has to be called, and explained what happened so they can try to make the customer feel 'valued' by this emotionless corporate money making machine.  Which would usually have a 'coaching moment' where the boss corrects a misunderstanding, educates properly, and express the business' need for you to stop making up shit to get rid of horrible fucking customers.  It's basically a shit sandwich you gotta eat while this asshole stands there feeling accomplished for knowing more than 'the expert' that makes $7.15/hour for reading price tags as if they are engineering white papers and contemplates all the ways he can exploit the situation for his own personal gain (free warranty, discount, or store credit).    Best course of action for your goal of going back to staring into the abyss of nothingness that is retail until closing time, is to make that silly bastard walk out thinking the shit train wasn't running on rails of shit.  Then if it comes back up, you can execute the deny_all tactic, the scapegoat tactic to redirect attention from yourself plausibly, or the one I resorted to in my last retail experience.  I call it the 'I don't give a fuck, and I don't get paid enough to give a fuck.  If you try to use this as an excuse to fire me, I'll either point out how this place is run like shit or make up something plausible and sell it to the fucking manager until he thinks it was the company's fault, and therefore have no right to discipline me or retaliate.'  If they try to call your bluff, elevate by invoking 'Hostile Workplace Environment' process.  General counsel should get involved along with HR to prevent litigation.  At my last retail job, I also leveraged the manager being incompetent because I found an internal document on the network unrestricted,  not password protected, nor labeled appropriately.  It's contents revealed that a department supervisor tried to get the newhire with the nice rack to suck his dick in exchange for his sign off on the training completion as he racked up a line of cocaine in front over her on the desk.  It detailed how she went directly to hr and filed a report on his coked out ass instead of sucking his dick in the Babies R Us training room.  Wait, it gets better...the letter ended telling him to make better choices and how he needs to shape up and take his job seriously as a supervisor.  Then they made him continue to supervise her after her training was complete without getting risk prevention involved.    Yeah, I sent that document to everyone from shared account.  I mostly did it out of spite for all the times irrational pregnant women verbally abused me for something I had no control over.  Only to have a manager, profusely apologize for me being a convenient target for hormone-driven episodes of rage that bypassed all rational thinking.    I still wish I could've just seen one of Michelle's magnificent breasts for fixing her very uncomfortable working relationship that fuckstick supervisor and outing the GM of the store as being functionally retarded.  I've never looked back since for retail jobs."
Chromecast,3buu53,SnowmanXl,118,Thu Jul 2 09:43:34 2015 UTC,"Maybe instead of bringing in mediocre new features like this, try making it so that starting to cast a new video while watching one doesn't replay the old one and add the new one into a queue. Or making it so that the Chromecast doesn't disconnect from my TV, then continues to play on my phone with the Cast icon active, with no ability to pause it on the TV and if I untap Cast on my phone it turns it off on my Chromecast. Or maybe bring back the ability to read video descriptions without having to play the videos while something is already streaming to the Chromecast. Or even letting me see the entire title of a video that I might want to add to my queue. Or just improving connectivity in general so that I can actually enjoy this device again."
Chromecast,3buu53,IndianaLetItGo,25,Thu Jul 2 15:10:01 2015 UTC,"I wish you were overreacting; but sadly everything you listed happens continuously.   I'd also like to add that it takes like 30 seconds after I connect to my chromecast before it will even let me pick a video to play or add to queue. I have to wait until YT's useless red logo pops up, then the black screen with the YT ""celebrities"" pops up, and finally I can hit play or add to queue.   Netflix, on the other hand, I can hit cast, play, turn off my phone screen, and put my phone down all in 10 seconds and I'm good to go. Really Google? The netflix app works better on your device than one of your own apps, it's shameful."
Chromecast,3buu53,slevinkelevra15,12,Thu Jul 2 15:56:01 2015 UTC,"It's getting to the point that if you want a decent user-experience using Google's own apps you need to buy a fucking iPhone.  I know Google's iPhone team only have to deal with a handful of devices and its Android team have to handle hundreds of devices, but that's no excuse for making your competitors' devices look and work better than your own bloody OS.  Netflix can build a decent app where chromecast Just Fucking Works, but the company who designed and built the chromecast seems to find it impossible to release an app that doesn't noisily shit itself every time you turn the screen off.  It's frankly embarrassing."

If I want to use google voice and hangouts to send a text with my android wear watch--too bad. If I want to use my tmobile number instead of google voice--works perfectly. What??  Instead of coming out with pointless new feature after pointless  new feature, Google needs to take a breath and fix all the eroding gaps within the functionality of their ecosystem."

Chromecast,3buu53,JustGimmeSomeTruth,2,Thu Jul 2 16:20:43 2015 UTC,"I suspect you're onto something with the ads... I cant prove it but I feel like that is often the source of all these bullshit bugs.   I mean if you think about it, failing to deliver advertisements (possibly/probably) results in an immediate consequence for them because it angers the company that paid for the ad.  On the other hand, a handful of users might get pissed off when you don't deliver the content/service itself, but oh well right?  So where are they gonna focus their efforts?  The concept of advertisements on something like YouTube is inherently disruptive to the service being provided, by definition even. I have just seen so many apps/sites/etc working great and suddenly an ad comes in and fucks everything up or makes it freeze, stutter and so on.  (I used to see this a lot with the Hulu app on my TV).    It pisses me off exponentially more than the app just screwing up on its own... It's like, if I didn't have to watch your stupid fucking ad everything would've been fine. But nooo, gotta get those precious ads to those eyeballs... My eyeballs. Ugh."
Chromecast,3buu53,ididntsaygoyet,3,Fri Jul 3 02:40:47 2015 UTC,"It was great at the start, though. You'd load YouTube on your phone, try to play the video, and an ad would start instead.

Chromecast,3buu53,muzzyb3ar,3,Thu Jul 2 23:38:42 2015 UTC,I've sent feedback via the app asking them to revert it back to how it was before (and asking them to fix the stopping-playback-when-waking-device issue asap)... I suggest others do the same so it gets on their radar.

Chromecast,3buu53,amanitus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:55:50 2015 UTC,"We kinda already had it though, just requiring a swipe up.  Which 99% of the time a user would've swiped it down for a reason (browsing/adding videos to the queue)... So it makes perfect sense to reverse that choice and swipe upwards.  Two distinct ""modes,"" makes perfect sense to me.  Certainly if they were trying to save us the trouble of that one swipe, that failed miserably because all that happens is I keep pausing/scrubbing etc with zero precision when all I'm trying to do is get the video window back up to the top of the screen. So, not easier, instead much harder and more inconvenient to have to fix all the erroneous scrubbing and pausing and skipping you just did by accident."
Chromecast,3buu53,JustGimmeSomeTruth,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:46:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. This must be a bug, especially if it messes up your swiping.   I'm currently using YouTube Background Playback. It gives a great playback controller in the notification drawer."
Chromecast,3buu53,Shaper_pmp,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:27:46 2015 UTC,I really hope it's a bug...
Chromecast,3buu53,ado010,15,Fri Jul 3 03:53:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah... and you can accidentally hit next, previous, the chromecast icon, ""info"" or a random point on the scrubber (totally losing your place in the video) when you're just trying to un-minimise the fucking video.  And who has fingers tiny enough to scrub accurately within a minimised video thumbnail anyway?  This is such a stupid misfeature I honestly assumed it was a bug, rather than an intentional addition."
Chromecast,3buu53,Shaper_pmp,2,Thu Jul 2 17:52:48 2015 UTC,Can't you just  swipe up on that minimized video to maximize it?
Chromecast,3buu53,onecelledcreature,6,Thu Jul 2 19:11:20 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you're supposed to be able to, but every time I try it hits one of the many buttons crowding the thumbnail-sized interface instead of registering the swipe gesture."

Chromecast,3buu53,Yage2006,5,Thu Jul 2 20:33:51 2015 UTC,I was about to post this. Such terrible design. The buttons are barely visible and overly complicated. YouTube get your Chromecast shit together!

It's also great when a video is playing and I go to pause it and sometimes I see its disconnected from the CC and if I try to re-connect I end up back on the home screen having lost the video and playback position.

Chromecast,3bx9q0,thumper242,6,Thu Jul 2 22:25:41 2015 UTC,"For a tech savvy dude, you sure didn't include a lot of info about the streamed media. File formats mean nothing beyond compatability. Variations in codec compression and overall bitrate define what is sluggish. The CC is a weak piece of hardware. I love our 2 little CCs, but high compression in a 1080p semi high bitrate will gut it."
Chromecast,3bx9q0,oL00No,2,Thu Jul 2 23:36:24 2015 UTC,"I stopped adding information in favor of brevity when I realized I was getting a bit verbose.    Also, to be honest, aside from knowing that we virtually are always use MP4 files, know very little about the types of files have been using. What I do know is that the resolution of the movie doesn't seem to matter. If it is in a bad mood, then it just doesn't work. Also even if it's 1080p, the re-setup of the Chromecast fixes it."
Chromecast,3bx9q0,oL00No,2,Thu Jul 2 23:45:21 2015 UTC,"Well, if it fixes it you may actually have stumbled on an error with your chromecast. That would be too bad!   I will add that mp4 is not a specific codec, and that the decoding burden can vary greatly between codecs and their individual sub-settings. It's also worth noting that the significant increase in real estate going from 720p to 1080p always entrails a substantial rise in bitrate if compressed for viewability.   Did you ever encounter the problems with 720p? If so, maybe try getting a few test files in 480p for when it's acting up. This might be redundant though, as you seem to have experienced different behaviour with identical work loads already.   I often see people recommending getting a better router. It's just silly. There's an app that will test the CCs actual bandwidth on screen, and with N-connectivity it's usually well above anything mainstream in 1080p. Only explanation I've found to hold true for all CCs is that the cpu and gpu simply buckles beyond a certain work load. I hope all streaming services keep lower bitrate options in the pipe for when we all have 4K TVs. Otherwise the CC will be outdated quite fast. But YouTube seems to have variety down, so there's hope that others will keep the trend. It also saves them bandwidth, so it's a win win."

Chromecast,3bx9q0,JimboLodisC,2,Thu Jul 2 22:31:36 2015 UTC,"Get a decent router.   This seems like an incomplete or 'knee-jerk' answer.    Why would a different router account for running set-up, and using it for hours and hours trouble free, then going to bed and trying to use it the next day with sputters and buffering? Especially since signal strength and transfer rates for everything else is so strong."
Chromecast,3bx9q0,crypto_z,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:39:42 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't be the only one that's reported ""I bought a new router and problems went away.""  It might be worth simplifying your network down to troubleshoot so you can actually narrow down the problem. Chromecast, router, modem, TV, casting device. No issues? Introduce a new network component.  You may find it's something as simple as a router setting that was causing issues, but you're too busy rebooting 15 things to notice."

Second, if you look at cc app options you will see  Extreme (720p high bitrate) High (720p) Standard (480p)  720p being the common point.

Chromecast,3bx9q0,crypto_z,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:31:51 2015 UTC,"And your advice was complete misinformation. Do you have anything to back up your overheating point? Yes, it gets hot. Electronics put out heat. You can only refer to it as overheating if the heat is causing performance issues. And what you're telling me is an idle Chromecast plugged into the wall is putting out more heat than a Chromecast under load while drawing power from a USB port. That's idiotic.  I'll assume my valid points were #1 and #2. Therefore making #3 through #5 my ""redundant dribble"". They are in fact 3 separate problems that can arise from disturbing the Chromecast's update procedure. In a way, they could have been grouped into one ungodly long comment, though. However, they are not redundant.  #3 - involves not having power at all to update #4 - involves having power and then pulling an update #5 - involves having power cut off while performing an update  Feel free to power your own Chromecast from a USB port. I'd like yours to eventually fry on a future update so you can throw it in the trash and stop coming to this subreddit to spread misinformation.  But as infrequent as updates are, it'll take 1 bad flash before you're crawling in here to ask for help.  I guarantee you don't switch your TV's input over to the Chromecast every time you are about to turn it off to make sure it's not doing an update."

Chromecast,3bt6ik,JimboLodisC,2,Wed Jul 1 23:16:26 2015 UTC,"Sure.  I'm trying to listen to music from Google Play (streamed from a chrome tab on my desktop) and watch a baseball game on MLB.tv (also streamed from a chrome tab on my desktop).  Edit: Also, for some reason using an aux cable on my receiver and trying to get video from another output doesn't work. So the only way I would be able to do this is from the same input."
Chromecast,3bt6ik,JimboLodisC,3,Wed Jul 1 23:21:06 2015 UTC,"(And I'm assuming you want to use your desktop during all of this, so screen-casting is out.)  Video-wise, the Chromecast will need to handle the MLB game.  As far as audio, we need to find another route. This could either mean a cable or another Chromecast or a bluetooth receiver module to stay wireless.  Is your Chromecast plugged into the TV or the receiver? I would think the Chromecast plugged straight into the TV for video would let you switch the audio input over to the AUX cable plugged into the receiver. For example, you should be able to listen to an iPod on your home theater speakers without having the TV on. Unless CEC is getting in the way, which would require turning that feature off or disconnecting the receiver from the TV. This might be too much swapping and switching for your setup, though."

For only a few £/$ per month, you can use a SECURE VPN.   If you have a pc, set up the following   a (secure) VPN and log on to internet set up a wifi hotspot  http://www.7tutorials.com/how-turn-your-windows-81-laptop-wifi-access-point or use connectify max (not free but good and easy to use). connect cc to wifi hotspot  connect phone/tablet to nextflix using pc wifi hotspot cast netflix using proper casting (not screen casting)   above will work with HOLA (at your risk)"

Chromecast,3bu5eh,DPAmes1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:00:53 2015 UTC,"You could do exactly as /u/danskeman suggested, his method would allow you to cast from Chrome on your PC/Mac without the need for any apps, all you need is a VPN and to set up a wifi hotspot for your Chromecast to connect to.    You could also do what I suggested and just use a different VPN. Honestly, I didn't research Hola and was pretty high when stumbling across this, so I just threw the post up as I was pretty stoked to be watching American Netflix from the comfort of my couch without having to get up and fuck with my computer or router.    I'm not sure why this post or I am being down-voted so much, I already said I knew that Hola was a VPN and that I wasn't using it for anything other than this. If they are indeed DDOSing their clients than no one should be using it, but I wasn't aware of that before. It's already been un-installed and replaced.    In terms of VPN's some are better than others, mainly because some offer better transfer rates and some don't store any data on you, so it doesn't matter what you do, you very likely won't get caught, but nearly any VPN will work for this purpose, so long as it offers a decent transfer rate and doesn't try to maliciously attack it's users like Hola apparently does."
Chromecast,3bu5eh,danskeman,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:01:17 2015 UTC,"No one method is recommended as such.  Starting from easiest (there are variations - I am just showing typical solutions):  1) simply connect to US netflix using vpn, and use screen casting from (PC) chrome - quality may be poorer and may need fairly powerful PC  2) setup up wifi hotspot on PC - free methods or easy way using connectify max (not free).  Connect PC to VPN, connect CC and  tablet/phone (or even another PC)  to wifi hotspot, and operate netflix from tablet/phone (or even pc with wifi hotspot I think - can't remember).  This is much better for cast friendly apps - especially netflix.  3) hardware solutions - main one is to set up  smart dns (supplied by main vpn providers - often in price of vpn) on router, and use ip re-routing or iptables etc to re-route CC to router dns.  Many guides on web and in these forums.    Option 3 is a good solution and not as difficult to do as you might think.  You can use phione/tablet etc and do not need to tie-up pc.  One downside is that if you use smart dns, apps from your home country do not always work properly, as they think you are outside you home country.  So you either have to change dns back to normal dns, or have tow routers connected (say) one with smart dns, and one with normal dns (my preferred solution).  So, really the solution depends on you needs, available equipment and its  processing capability etc.  If you have PC, option 1 is easy to try, and if you are ok with quality, and you do not get stuttering etc, then it may be all you need."
Chromecast,3bu5eh,JimboLodisC,0,Tue Jul 7 08:08:26 2015 UTC,"I also find that screen casting from a reasonably fast Android device stutters less than tab-casting from Chrome on a PC, apparently due to Google terribly inefficient code in the PC version. But I'm guessing you aren't up to speed on why you shouldn't be using Hola? You might want to do some research."

But more to the point: I've been using the casting queue in YouTube on an almost daily basis ever since Google added second screen support to the YouTube PS3 app, which predated the chromecast by many months.   Trust me when I say it used to work flawlessly on that platform as well as chromecast. The fact that it doesn't work now is unacceptable to me, regardless of how impressed you are that it even exists. I don't give Google a free pass on this just because it might be more difficult to implement vs whatever service Popcorn Time offers.   Correct me if I'm wrong here, but Popcorn offers movies, right? If this is the primary function, then queuing videos is less essential on their app, whereas with YouTube it's absolutely necessary for many users.   As a cord cutter, I subscribe to many news sources on YouTube, and I avoid watching traditional news broadcasts altogether because there's no need to wait through an entire hour's worth of bullshit just waiting for the segments I want to watch...I can just cast those segments on YouTube.   This means on a daily basis, I have several videos in my sub list that range anywhere from 30 seconds to 10 minutes in length. No feature length films for me to sit down for long sessions with.  I'll scroll through the list and add these clips to the queue, then go do the dishes or cook dinner while they play. Between tasks, I might check my subs again and add more to the queue. This has been a big part of my news consumption for the better part of the last 3+ years.   The fact that Popcorn Time performs a less demanding task is of no consequence to me...If that app does what it says it does with chromecast more reliably than the YouTube app, then that makes it better for chromecast, regardless of which one was designed to do more.   In my opinion and for what I use my chromecast for it is absolutely an apples to apples comparison. YouTube was formerly the superior app on Chromecast. That is no longer true since they've broken an essential feature I rely on."

Chromecast,3bkr8b,cup-o-farts,0,Tue Jun 30 19:59:44 2015 UTC,i used the queue for the first time in a month or so last night and had no issues. i also havent updated the youtube app in a while so....
Chromecast,3bkr8b,moodyfloyd,0,Tue Jun 30 19:59:48 2015 UTC,my other half and her friends have nights where they sit around each one queuing up youtube videos and they have yet to complain of anything acting weird/annoying with it. seems to work fine for them with 3 people randomly adding videos onto the same queue
Chromecast,3bkr8b,alpain,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:37:17 2015 UTC,"Have they had such a night recently? As in since these updates broke the queue feature? Like I said, up until about a month ago it worked perfectly for me too. But it's not just the queue that shat the bed. They also removed the video description from the control window. I know it's not me, because I have 3 chromecast and control them from 2 Nexus 5's, two Galaxy Nexus, a Nexus 7 and my chrome box. The queue fucks up for me on all chromecasts from all devices but the chrome box."
Chromecast,3bkr8b,furious_20,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:44:40 2015 UTC,when did the last update come in they had one a few weeks ago. i dont notice usually when the updates happen as shes the one who turns it on first usually when im not around.
Chromecast,3bkr8b,alpain,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:54:58 2015 UTC,"If they did this a few weeks ago, then her queue isn't completely broken. Neither is mine for that matter. I can still queue up a list of videos, but whether they all play continuously to the end is a crap shoot.   Also, like I mentioned in my first reply, the issue I run into is when the queue has played out completely. In the past, I could just simply add a new video to the queue, or choose, ""Play"" in a video and have the queue restored, but with the most recently added clip playing at the bottom of that queue. Nowadays doing the same frequently starts the whole queue from the beginning. Annoying to say the least, even though this isn't an app-breaking bug since i could easily bring up the queue then scroll down to the end and launch the last video.  I shouldn't have to do that shit though.   I could also minimize a video currently playing to its thumbnail size, then swipe it away and this used to clear the queue. This doesn't work right all the time either. But as far as which update did this I don't keep meticulous track of that, but if I recall correctly the crap started around April, which was I believe when I first noticed the video description gone from the control window. Every update since then has seemed to make the app buggier with Chromecast."

My girlfriend and myself spent a few nights over christmas break and watched a few movies through popcorn time on my chromecast and not even 2 days later were hit with 3 infractions of illegal downloads. to restore normal internet usage I had to take a quiz that explained the seriousness of copyright infringement before they had internet access again. if there was anymore of such activity they threatened to cut internet completely and cancel internet service if it continued.   so lesson learned, always use a vpn to watch movies downloaded by torrents if you're on verizon fios. my girlfriend had brighthouse and it was never a problem, but even doing it once on verizon got us caught so just be very careful."

At most you could be saying that content-owners go after people with 100% of a torrent and ignore everyone with up to 99.999% of the file, but that's a really stupid, arbitrary limit and I'd love to see a source for it if that's what you're claiming."

Chromecast,3bmt8x,WinWinPeg,2,Tue Jun 30 14:13:36 2015 UTC,My suggestion is find a stream on the computer or whatever (on chrome) and cast it. If you can't find any website covering it because its not a big game then I doubt any football etc app will cover it

I used to do chromecast parties where we would just cast up our favorite youtube videos, but now it seems as though I can't even cast a simple list of videos from a single device. There wasn't any problems prior to the most recent update, but now there seems to be a host of them, such as the app freezing, the queue getting jumbled, or countless other things. Hopefully google is going to get this whole situation fixed pretty quickly because until then the chromecast is pretty useless for me."

Before if the app somehow diconnected you could close the app, open again, click on casting and it would automatically sync with the video that is running on TV.  Not it works different:   You cast a video from youtube. Youtube loses connection. You close the app and restart it you click on the casting button. THE VIDEO STOPS AND THE TV SHOWS THE STILL STANDRARD IMAGE FROM THE CHROMCAST VIDEO APP What the fucking fuck. The content on the TV should ALWAYS have the higher priority since it is running. It should NEVER EVER make the video stop if I sync the app with the chromecast.    Fuck the Youtube team right now. Fuck them until they fix this shit."

Chromecast,3bgjdn,sethoscope,4,Mon Jun 29 01:43:11 2015 UTC,Second all of this. Try sending feedback in the app. They say they read all of them.

Turning my phone back on to open the app and it seems to have lost connection but the music is still playing but I definitely can't see the playlist any more. Sometimes even opening the app restarts that video from the beginning!"
Chromecast,3bgjdn,cjandstuff,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:12:39 2015 UTC,I'm on iOS and it definitely is getting worse. I have to reboot the thing constantly to be able to cast. Maybe I should put it on a timer to shut down every night and maybe then it will be responsive in the evening.

Chromecast,3bgjdn,snobord,4,Mon Jun 29 05:24:29 2015 UTC,I agree and it's been getting worse and worse. I was trying to cast a video today and the refresh icon on my phone kept spinning but the video was playing on my TV. I couldn't pause the video but I could scroll around with the scrubber. Other times it would simply disconnect.
Chromecast,3bgjdn,batman2142,6,Mon Jun 29 07:50:45 2015 UTC,I dont know if it s my cc or the youtube app but a couple of days ago the whole thing turned to shit.. videos play twice in a row instead of playing the one queued.. playlists barely work.. it s a mess.

Chromecast,3bgjdn,kratos01,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:23:48 2015 UTC,If it makes you feel any better I've been having lssues with the ios version for the last few months.  Netflix can be buggy at times too so I've been using my Chromecast mostly to play music.    It almost feels likes something has changed like they've changed things in their software in anticipation of a new functionality but haven't worked the bugs out yet.  I love the concept of the Chromecast but if things don't start getting better I'm really thinking about buying another Roku because it is currently giving me a lot less hassle.

Chromecast,3bhq75,danskeman,4,Mon Jun 29 09:21:31 2015 UTC,"There are two types of casting:  1) url casting (cast friendly apps)- the device (pc/tablet/phone) sends a url to the chromecast - the chromecast then talks directly to webpage via your router.  The device is only needed for remote control. This only works on some apps e.g. bbc iplayer, netflix etc . that have a casting icon.  Once CC takes over the url, you can switch device off.  The othwer type of casting is mirror casting (also called screen casting which is confusing as you can also miracast from any devices to a miracast dongle and this is also term screen casting).  Screen casting to a CC is like having a second screen on a PC.   You cannot turn off device as the device is doing all the work.  Some rooted devices allow you to turn off screen but not device. This mode is used when an app does not have casting capability as above."

Chromecast,3bhq75,JimboLodisC,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:15:02 2015 UTC,"Dunno, what tablet do you got? I'd be curious to see what the tablet stops doing once you press the screen button. It might go into a sleep mode and cease casting or it might just be like turning the monitor off for a regular desktop.  I'd also like to know what you're screen-casting that might be affected by this. Usually there's a better way to cast where you don't have to worry about leaving the screen on."

Chromecast,3bhq75,DavidMelbourne,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:21:45 2015 UTC,"Oh. So you probably aren't familiar with official casting support vs tab-casting vs screen-casting.  Can I ask what you intend to watch on your Chromecast? Because screen-casting is the worst out of the 3 methods of using your Chromecast. I wouldn't walk into this purchase thinking it's anything remotely similar to ""wireless HDMI"".  The only thing close to that experience is AirPlay (if you have a Mac) or Miracast (if your tablet would support it). Chromecast's implementation is heavily reliant on hardware, so unless you're getting a Surface Pro, I'd probably expect screen-casting to be not worth the trouble."
Chromecast,3bhq75,Scritter,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:13:33 2015 UTC,Wireless HDMI was sort of what I was looking for. I usually hook up my PC for watching movies off of local storage so that was the plan. I am actually considering Surface Pro.  I guess I'll have to borrow stuff and test it out first.

Chromecast,3ba0cp,Copernican,2,Sat Jun 27 09:24:57 2015 UTC,It's not the app (in regard to repeating previously played videos ). I was casting and queuing up things for guests the other day from YouTube on my desktop and was getting the same behavior.

Chromecast,3ba0cp,DGer,2,Sun Jun 28 16:39:29 2015 UTC,"YouTube's android app is the shittiest app to use with Chromecast   Let's be real. It is not the shittiest app to use with Chromecast.  Have you ever tried the Starz app? Or the ESPN app?  There are so many that just don't work.  Youtube is buggy, but they are actually adding features that will make it one of the best video apps on the Chromecast.   My friends and I enjoy the Youtube app because multiple users can create a music video playlist from different devices. That's pretty cool."
Chromecast,3ba0cp,frozenwalkway,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:31:43 2015 UTC,"I haven't used the ESPN app or the other one you speak of. I'm not denying what you're saying. Yes, YouTube is feature rich, but what use are the features when basic casting is fucked up? It's like having a car with massage seats but a shitty engine which breaks down every ten miles."
Chromecast,3ba0cp,Harkonnen,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:42:36 2015 UTC,"The real issue is that it used to almost always work great, and that the more recent updates are breaking far more things than they're adding."
Chromecast,3ba0cp,darthrich,2,Sun Jun 28 01:17:53 2015 UTC,I agree wholeheartedly. It's gotten to the point that I prefer the simplicity of casting to my Kodi box rather than dealing with the unpredictability of the interactions between an app and Chromecast.    And that is precisely the opposite of how things started off with Chromecast. It used to be the simplest option.
Chromecast,3ba0cp,repr1sal,2,Sat Jun 27 18:46:34 2015 UTC,I'm just sick of losing the player controls every time my goddamned phone screen turns off.  And managing the TV queue is still a mess.

Chromecast,3ba0cp,darkviper039,2,Sat Jun 27 21:58:45 2015 UTC,If you think Youtube acts shitty with a Chromecast....you obviously have never used the steaming pile of excrement known as WATCH ESPN. worst app from one of the biggest company's media-wise. so horrible ill resort to casting a tab in Chrome of a bootleg feed.

Also annoying is that YouTube is one of the few apps that times out after like 4 minutes of non-use thereby requiring the connection to be established again."

It's gone through some iterations, but the current option looks like this from the browser extension: http://i.imgur.com/yii7JtX.jpg  It says ""experimental"" mainly because it doesn't work as good as other screen-mirroring tech like AirPlay or Miracast. It heavily depends on the hardware of your computer and the strength of your wifi connection."

Do you have any issues connecting to the site? Do you know how to check your processor ( how busy your laptop is) while it is running CC?  If you're getting a decent signal on the laptop, and ther CC is in the same room, it reasons you SHOULD be getting a decent signal from that. How do videos from that site play on your laptop without using CC?"
Chromecast,3bepfm,JimboLodisC,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:56:05 2015 UTC,"You say ""isn't working too hot with it"". What exactly does that mean?  Cuz if it has problems with your internal wifi network, I would point the finger at the gateway box. If you're having buffering issues, it could be that your DSL connection is weak. If some apps work and others don't, it might be something outside of your control.  When you call a mechanic and tell him ""my car isn't working too hot"", he will most definitely need more info. Lucky for him, he can actually get his hands on the car if you don't care to provide any info and figure it out for himself. You're not bringing my Chromecast to my shop, though."
Chromecast,3bepfm,JimboLodisC,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:49:20 2015 UTC,"Well, I think your knowledge and understanding of Internet is much greater than mine. It's not working too hot by constantly freezing up and not streaming fluently. I guess I can't describe much past that. So yes, I guess you would say it is having buffering issues!  I don't really know what to point my finger at for the leading culprit as to why its buffering which is why I turned to Reddit in hope to get some help. All I know is I only stream tv shows and movies from sites like Couchtuner.com on Google Chrome from my HP laptop in rooms where it says I have 4 bars of wifi signal.   That's about all I got. Hopefully that helps explains my problem more, and thanks for helping me!"

Chromecast,3b3ad8,Sgt_ZigZag,17,Thu Jun 25 17:50:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its a YouTube app thing. In my experience, the Android app is simply horrible, and what kills me is that there are no viable alternatives. Viral doesn't even work on Lollipop or Android M.   Most annoying thing for me is that the app will ALWAYS try to play back videos at 144p or 240p, even though when I select 1080p or 1440p they play just fine with no issues. So I have to change the quality and restart the video for every single video I select. It's a pain in the ass. Then, it seems after casting, the YouTube app stops playing videos on the phone. It will play sound, but show a still image on the phone and I have to restart the YouTube app. Then if I get the ""an error has occurred, tap to retry"" message, it will occur on every single video. Again, need to restart the app to get it working. YouTube casting gets worse and worse all the time, for some bloody reason Google decided it would be a great idea to remove video titles and descriptions from the popup card that you get when you select a video. Adding that video to your queue is next to impossible sometimes, because it might not be added to the end of the queue, it might be stuck in some random spot where the video doesn't even play, or an entirely different video that you didn't even select begins to play. I don't know if this bug still exists, but when my queue finished, the app would play my playlist on an entirely different YouTube alias under my account, and add that entire fucking playlist to the queue.   Tl;dr this app is horribly annoying."

Chromecast,3b3ad8,sickmate,7,Fri Jun 26 12:43:29 2015 UTC,I have all of those issues too. It's frustrated me to the point that I just ran an HDMI cable from my office to my living room and use a wireless keyboard to use YouTube on my pc

Chromecast,3b3ad8,sethoscope,2,Fri Jun 26 01:21:25 2015 UTC,Yes!! The latest update seems to have memory leaks.
Chromecast,3b3ad8,MeikaLeak,2,Fri Jun 26 03:18:53 2015 UTC,"It really makes me wonder if Google engineers use their own products. The whole YouTube Chromecast experience is pretty bad and has only gotten worse of late. The most frustrating thing is that the issues are so blatant and seem like they would be easy to fix. Disconnections and fucked up queuing wreck the experience. Even when things work, things aren't great (why would they make it impossible to see video descriptions or names when you click them?!?!) YouTube should be the reference app for how Chromecast should be implemented and it sucks."
Chromecast,3b3ad8,dieterdengler,2,Fri Jun 26 12:04:30 2015 UTC,Yep. Same issues here. But it has never really worked as it should. I'm convinced they are actually dedicated to making the app worse with each update.

Chromecast,3b7u0k,JimboLodisC,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:27:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, 24/7. It's powered through the wall outlet and not the TV USB. Should I turn it off when  not using?   It does seem like it could be the TV though.. It is quite old.. One time it resumed working when I put it on another TV, but I had attributed that to the Chromecast restarting"
Chromecast,3b7u0k,JimboLodisC,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:07:45 2015 UTC,"Definitely stick with wall power. And I have had mine plugged in for over a year and it still works fine.  If it works fine on another TV, that makes an even stronger case that the TV is the problem. Cuz when you put it back on the problematic TV, the Chromecast has had a restart as well."
Chromecast,3b7u0k,Lusankya,3,Sun Jun 28 00:59:37 2015 UTC,"What does the Chromecast's indicator light show when the input is lost?  If it's solid red, and stays solid red, your unit has either forgotten its settings or crashed.  Blinking white means the network connection has been lost.  White means it's up and should be piping video out of the HDMI connector.  Does restarting the Chromecast through the app resolve the issue?  Do you see the indicator light change when you command a restart?  You should see the indicator go white to red, red to flashing white, and back to solid white once the reboot is finished and it's back online."
Chromecast,3b5llb,WillExis,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:58:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know a solution but I'm having the same issue. Also, for some reason, when I have a Playlist it will no longer go from one video to the other like before."
Chromecast,3b5llb,javisauce,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:46:23 2015 UTC,Did you try power cycling and resetting everything ?  The router can often be the culprit.

Chromecast,3b2d4w,EonHawk,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:59:51 2015 UTC,"Curious about this too. Also, not being in the Play Store and all, does the app have some sort of update system, like for example TubeMate has?"
Chromecast,3b2d4w,jzanc,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:01:11 2015 UTC,"Since this isn't on the App store, is there an easy way to check for updates about the app? (Facebook Page, etc...)"
Chromecast,3b2d4w,Sunny_Cakes,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:08:12 2015 UTC,I believe the app itself informs you if there's an update. Every time the app starts up it checks for a new version.

Chromecast,3awuok,Mh1781,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:36:27 2015 UTC,"Sorry, no solution here but I wanted to piggy back on this thread and mention a similar problem I'm having.  I work in a school and recently we received some new locked down computers that our logins don't have administrative rights etc.  Even through that I was able to install the Chromecast Extension and I'm having an issue with the full desktop mirroring. Every other thing I have tested works fine with the Chromecast and I can even tab cast from Chrome, but when it gets to trying to cast the entire screen it goes through all of the motions and it just displays an all black screen and then times out after a minute or two saying the connection has been stopped.  I tried on another desktop that didn't have the same restrictions as our new laptops and the desktop mirroring worked fine.   Any ideas? Thanks."
Chromecast,3aufax,quis-ut-deus,3,Tue Jun 23 16:25:47 2015 UTC,"Came here to see if others were experiencing the same issue. I've found Chromecast rather flaky lately. It could be the apps' fault, but Netflix and Google Music should be best of breed in this arena and they seem to be getting worse.  Some recent issues:   Cast a tab that should load an app and instead just casts the browser tab Netflix starts playing the show on the PC before it figures out that ""hey, this tab is casting"". Why aren't they keeping track of when a tab is casted? I figure this has to do with their new interface but casting from the browse should load the Chromecast app IMO. When Google Music is casting (from PC), randomly stops playing altogether This issue now where music starts playing on both the tab and Chromecast with no ability to stop it locally only."

Chromecast,3au2yl,Rirath,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:33:16 2015 UTC,You don't want to lowering the bandwidth - that requires the server to re-transcode. You want to be setting it to maximum bandwidth because it defaults to quite a low setting - and for local network use - setting it maximum generally works (providing the content is already in the right format for the Chromecast of course)

Chromecast,3aq1av,swm5126,13,Fri Jun 26 04:00:40 2015 UTC,"Some people whine that there's no physical remote. Grandparents are very thankful for that feature, but with Google Cast capability you can still use it just like a Chromecast when you visit.  Also, you can use a gamepad connected to the Nexus Player instead of connecting your gamepad to your phone/tablet for screen-casting. This should eliminate most of the input lag associated with that method, which is important for gaming.  Plus the Nexus Player has much more horsepower than the Chromecast. (1.8GHz quad-core Intel Atom versus the very cheap Marvell SoC in the Chromecast) This should make it quicker to load a receiver app and better for tab-casting.  If you just want something cheap that accepts casts, there's no reason to get a Nexus Player over a Chromecast. But the Nexus Player is a more powerful product with several extra features."
Chromecast,3aq1av,jowaldo,3,Mon Jun 22 17:26:41 2015 UTC,For a lot of apps like Netflix HDMI-CEC can control basic pause/play/rw/ff functions on a chromecast once the video is started if your TV supports that.

I never have problems starting mine up because it's always plugged into the outlet.  When it boots, it has to find your SSID to connect to it. The router has to work it's magic to get it into the client table. Then the Chromecast will check for a firmware update. If there is one, it'll download. Then it'll install it. Then it'll reboot. It will do all of that the second you fire it up while at the same time, you're trying to cast something.  See the problem?"

I'd assume that after handing out reservations you run the risk that a device that hasn't yet requested a release/renew of it's address could in fact have the same address as another device that you have assigned an address to. eg - I turned my HTC One X on the other day - it had a long time ago been assigned the address 192.168.2.12 to make it less shitty when roaming between access points in the building. However as it's been switched off for a long time - when it came to setting up a Home Automation server, I pinged around the 10's section of the network and found 192.168.2.12 to be a free area and assigned it to the Home Automation server. Everything was fine - until I switched the HTC One X on the other day and found that connection with the Home Automation server was intermittent. After googling around for a bit - I came across arping - which sure enough showed replies coming from 2 different devices when pinging 192.168.2.12 - So..... maybe start there...."

My plan now is to slowly add the reserved addresses day by day and see if there is something in particular that triggers the issue.  Any more ideas of the cause would be appreciated. Im not a techie by study, but do like to mess with stuff and when things go wrong I like to learn why rather then just resolving the issue."

Chromecast,3asfma,exonwarrior,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:45:53 2015 UTC,"The Chromecast itself, no. But if your TV doesn't have a USB port, you need a local USB power adapter."

My reasoning is that the chrome cast will last longer if it is powered off when the TV is, rather than being plugged into power all the time (via a UK to NZ adapter)."
Chromecast,3asfma,asjmcguire,2,Tue Jun 23 05:05:45 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you think you'd need a UK to NZ adapter. It's USB - you can power it from a smartphone charger adaptor if you want (as long as it's micro USB which pretty much all modern ones are) - as long as it's 5v and at ;east 500mA. I'd recommend not powering it from a TV - while a lot of people do, nearly all stability issues people come here looking for help with - arise from the fact that under load - the Chromecast could really do with a bit more than 500mA - that's why the included adapter provides 850mA."

Chromecast,3aplxg,Mitchull,3,Mon Jun 22 13:56:03 2015 UTC,"Short answer - no it won't use data, as it'll be streaming local media and not grabbing it from the internet.  In this case, you'll be streaming ""local media"". Take a look at this link in the sidebar:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Chromecast/comments/1umk7t/lets_make_this_the_last_how_do_i_play_local/  Note that it's a bit out of date.   If you're using a phone/tablet only, there's Android apps to stream local media from your device to the ChromeCast, but I'm not familiar with those. Search the subreddit for ""mobile OS type local streaming"", as this has been covered before. If you go with Plex/Emby, be aware that it may reach out to the Internet to grab metadata for any media you have (movie posters, subtitles, other media info)."

Old post: Try Allcast: AllCast — Cast photos, music, and video to your Chromecast by AllCast LLC https://appsto.re/us/B8kq4.i  The reason you have problems with Chromecast and recorded files on your camera roll is because they are MOV files. You need an app that will transcode the MOV (like Allcast) in order to be compatible with the chromecast. Because of this transcoding it is not unusual for there to be a delay between pressing play on the iOS device and it showing up on the chromecast."

From apple support: ""To reset, press and hold both the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons for at least 10 seconds, until you see the Apple logo.""  Last resort: reset network settings. Settings>General>Reset>""Reset Network Settings"" You have to re-pair bluetooth devices and re-enter wifi passwords when you do this.   **Also I have heard simply opening the iOS chromecast app then trying the app works.

Chromecast,3ajfrv,bradmont,25,Sat Jun 20 19:59:46 2015 UTC,Simple answer is No. There are no output resolution settings in the chromecast app however apps like YouTube let you select the quality / resolution.    Basically its up to the apps you are using and what they offer for settings.

Chromecast,3ajfrv,never_not_relevant,3,Sun Jun 21 07:11:16 2015 UTC,Your TV might have a setting to disable this functionality.   TVs send devices plugged into them something called am EDID.  Which is list of capabilities it supports. Your TV is probably saying hey I support 1080p and the chromecast is like sweet here's 1080p content.

Chromecast,3ajfrv,mjackl,7,Wed Jun 24 16:46:08 2015 UTC,I see what you are saying. I don't think it impacts your performance negatively. It would have to be from the Chromecast to change resolution but I haven't seen a resolution change option. Also your 720p tv is actually 1366 by 768 so slightly higher than 720p so you benefit (slightly) by having the TV receive it as 1080p and downscale to its native resolution of 768p.  EDIT - I see what you are saying about having data limits. The app you are Chromecasting like lets say YouTube might allow you to change the resolution.
Chromecast,3ajfrv,Yage2006,3,Sat Jun 20 20:46:13 2015 UTC,"Well, if you tab cast from a PC you have control over what resolution it casts at."

Chromecast,3amb3c,cheeni,3,Sun Jun 21 16:59:48 2015 UTC,That's not quite what happens - what happens is when you launch a Chromecast app (example Plex) the Chromecast goes off to a server the creators of Plex have registered as being the location of the Plex app - and it runs the page directly from the external server. The Chromecast does some caching - but mostly everything is run directly from the external server that the app developer has specified. It helps to remember the Chromecast is basically a glorified Chrome browser running in full screen mode (yes even the Backdrop). Further - the Chromecast is hardcoded to use Google's DNS and everything is designed to run from HTTPS servers - so intercepting or redirecting that will probably cause it to fail as security certificates won't match.
Chromecast,3amb3c,asjmcguire,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:43:52 2015 UTC,"That's correct, with no internet connection you can't launch any Chromecast apps. However you can continue to cast local content to an app like Plex if it was already running before you lost your internet connection (easy to verify - just unplug your internet cable and cast a few new titles). It's not quite true that the Chromecast is hardcoded to use Google DNS. It does use Google DNS by default, ignoring the DHCP-supplied DNS addresses, but if Google DNS is blocked in your router it will fall back to using the DHCP-supplied DNS addresses."
Chromecast,3amb3c,DPAmes1,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:27:11 2015 UTC,Yes you can circumvent the Google DNS issue - but you can't circumvent the mismatched HTTPS certificates.

Setup fine but nothing would find it. I unplugged the other 3 went to the chromecast app and rebooted the one in his room and everything found it. Then I just plugged in 1 2 and 3 one at a time and they work great now.

Chromecast,3akmb4,asjmcguire,2,Sun Jun 21 03:13:32 2015 UTC,"Before rebooting try this:  Swipe away from the multitasking menu any app that can't see the new Chromecast.  Open Chromecast app and actually connect to the new Chromecast so you can see all it's settings (click the cog icon)  Back out of the Chromecast app.  Re-open the app you want to use from the app drawer.  Most of the time on my Nexus 4 - this fixes the issue, but if it doesn't - generally rebooting the Chromecast via the Chromecast app will fix it (provided you again swipe away any app that doesn't see the Chromecast from the multitasking menu again)"

Try this application if you wish to stream. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/castnow-browser-for-chromecast/id843195222?mt=8  You will have to switch to HTML5 on Kissanime to use it while casting.

You just pull up whatever you want to watch manually, via keyboard and mouse. If you're lucky, you find a wireless keyboard/mouse combo peripheral that you don't mind using. Then when people come over, you can pass around this peripheral for sharing YouTube videos. Only, you have to wait until each video is done playing before searching for the next one. Otherwise people see what you're searching for, and they can't watch the current video that's playing.  Basically what Microsoft has done is taken the Intel Compute Stick and chopped $10 off the price.  If anything, this PC-on-a-stick competes with the Chromebit."

Not to say that MS's device has no merit its just not aimed at the same use case.

Chromecast,3aezms,TheDudeImbibes,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:03:47 2015 UTC,"You have to admit that is  a very very tiny portion of the market that might be interested in a CC or this device, Netflix blocks many VPN's now BTW which doesn't help.   More to the point, this is a PC on a stick, The Amazon firestick or that Roku stick are more competitors but even they lack the tight app support or the idea of (casting). Also its almost 4 times the cost.   Now that being said I am interested in it but not to replace any of the CC's I have laying around my home. One major put off though is Windows 8.1 the second put off is the need for a mouse keyboard.  I feel as though we have been here before with the MS surface, Another device that exists in some uncanny valley that never captured the market cause it was not as convenient as a traditional tablet and too small to replace a laptop.   I could think of some good uses for it though, Like installing a DLNA compliant media server on it or a simple PC for going on the net."

You get many more TV shows and movies.  As for Netflix blocking VPNs; hasn't happened in my experience with either Hola or PIA, two of the most popular services.  They said they might do so, but I doubt they will actually block users."
Chromecast,3aezms,TheDudeImbibes,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:31:27 2015 UTC,Ya like I said it has its place but that place isn't competing with chromecast on any level. One thing they don't mention in this article however is if it is ARM or X64 architecture if its ARM then I have zero interest in this since software support will be very weak.

Microsoft wants to kill chrome OS before it gets a decent marketshare.  I think thats the main goal with windows 10.  Windows marketshare is their anchor into the market.  As long as they have that they can keep failing at anything and can still force a new product on users.  Without the windows market share life is a lot tougher for microsoft."

Chromecast,3adgiv,Soulie1993,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:14:45 2015 UTC,"This happens frequently with me, especially on NowTv when playing tv episodes rather than films. I assumed it was to do with my phone disconnecting from the internet mid way through playing something (for whatever reason) but because the chromecast has been told what to play it can do so without the phone remaining connected. It's only when the episode finishes that you realise and have to disconnect and restart the app.  This may not be exactly what OP is describing but is a problem I've had a lot that would produce the same outcome."
Chromecast,3adgiv,fantalemon,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:29:34 2015 UTC,I also see it all the time. Netflix does seem to remember it is casting a little bit better than youtube.

Chromecast,3adgiv,Madonk,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:06:43 2015 UTC,"YouTube is special case, YouTube is designed to support multiple phones casting and adding to the queue at the same time, so that's partially why the app will continue playing on the TV. You can continue off from any device.   Other apps to my knowledge aren't designed like this, and are just weird. Crackle is the worst offender for me. Crackle will disconnect, continue streaming, and then make my Chromecast undiscoverable. The app never auto exits, and the only way I can see my Chromecast is through the Chromecast app, where I have to restart it."

Instead of just clicking 'Cast this tab', when on the site I click the Chromecast extension button (for Chrome browser), then the little arrow for the dropdown, and select 'Cast this tab' from there.  For some reason, that prevents Netflix from overriding the tab cast.  I also tried casting the entire screen or window, but there was no audio and the video frame rate was unwatchably bad."
Chromecast,3afo9q,SundayBabyPuncher,3,Fri Jun 19 19:24:10 2015 UTC,"I've read 3 sites 'specs' for that TV and nothing mentions any kind of audio out.  If that's actually the case, AND you have no built-in speakers, you're going to need to plug the Chromecast in to some kind of A/V receiver with HDMI input that you can attach speakers to (e.g. A blu-ray player/surround sound kit) and connect the HDMI output to your TV."

Chromecast,3afo9q,Bacon_Nipples,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:11:41 2015 UTC,"I don't understand German, but that looks like an HDMI splitter?  I'm not sure why your TV would not have speakers, it doesn't make sense to me.  Perhaps they're just broken, or perhaps the display is intended for bars/pubs/etc. where you would have an external sound system.  I didn't see anything about speakers on spec sheets, but they were all pretty vague since it's an older/odd model.  The composite/S-video cables are all inputs as far as I can tell.  TV's don't usually have composite/S-video out.  I'm no expert in the field either though, so take this with a grain of salt :)"
Chromecast,3afo9q,anonanon1313,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:01:50 2015 UTC,"Yup that's what it is. And it doesn't have speakers, because apparently sometimes in 2006 people just wanted huge monitors with no audio. Probably for a bar like you're suggesting.  We may have to fiddle around some more.

Chromecast,3acac6,ladiesman144,3,Fri Jun 19 00:12:13 2015 UTC,"I also have a 720p 32"" LG. It happens to me on certain YouTube videos as well. I think you're just stuck. Overscan is the only setting that could fix it.  I did notice that when hooking up a PC to the VGA port, it was sensing the TV to be a 1366x768 monitor and I was getting the edges of the screen cropped. I went into the PC's graphics properties and reset it to 1280x720 and the cropping stopped.  This could be a case of the Chromecast trying to detect the highest resolution possible for the display and then sticking with that. This makes the Chromecast compatible with more display types (like if someone had a 1366x768 monitor that they wanted to plug the Chromecast into) but there's no option on the user's end to say ""actually, 1280x720 is the true resolution""."

Chromecast,3a9xdt,dvereb,8,Fri Jun 19 01:56:22 2015 UTC,Any app developers out there... is it hard to add Chromecast support to apps like this?
Chromecast,3a9xdt,castdude,17,Thu Jun 18 12:36:07 2015 UTC,"Pretty hard, yeah. The protocol for communicating between apps and the Chromecast is complicated and not publicly documented by Google. They provide a software development kit (SDK) so that you as a developer don't have to worry about that part, but they only have SDKs for web apps running in Chrome, or Android apps or iOS apps. If you want to write a desktop app, you have to figure out for yourself how to communicate with the Chromecast, and reimplement all of that stuff yourself. Not impossible, but hard."

They provide a software development kit (SDK) so that you as a developer don't have to worry about that part, but they only have SDKs for web apps running in Chrome,    It's not the same at all, and javascript can be used in a browser. VLC isn't a browser, it uses a different programming language."
Chromecast,3a9xdt,Lonak,7,Thu Jun 18 18:46:14 2015 UTC,"You're essentially porting functions from a high level language to a lower level language but without documentation, its never as easy as it sounds."
Chromecast,3a9xdt,Mgamerz,2,Thu Jun 18 19:13:27 2015 UTC,"I admit that I haven't read the extension source code, but standard industry practice for deploying Javascript these days involves a build process to ""minify"" it -- stripping out all the whitespace, renaming all the variables and functions to single-letter names, etc. It's really unpleasant to read. It's possible that they haven't done that in this case, but so far as I know, all the efforts so far to replicate Chromecast functionality outside the SDK have revolved around packet-sniffing the activity of existing apps rather than trying to decipher the logic of any existing SDK, so I assume that's the path of least resistance."
Chromecast,3a9xdt,apendleton,2,Thu Jun 18 20:02:15 2015 UTC,"Yep, even if you throw the source into beautify.js it's still fugly."

Chromecast,3a9xdt,thetinguy,2,Thu Jun 18 22:26:01 2015 UTC,Do I understand correctly that with Videostream you can only cast local files?  Would VLC to Chromecast allow you to cast from a DVD?
Chromecast,3a9xdt,MostDeadly,3,Thu Jun 18 12:06:52 2015 UTC,I believe with VLC you could cast certain online video players that can play through it as well. But I'm not 100% on that.
Chromecast,3a9xdt,TheDankestMofo,3,Fri Jun 19 01:53:27 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm hoping I can cast acestreams using VLC now.

With exception to the latest nightly builds it looks like from other posts here and apparently just command line based now, I'm sure it's still another few months away at least from seeing it finished. So might as well look at other easy and better alternatives for an easier life."
Chromecast,3a9xdt,mistical,-4,Fri Jun 19 02:45:39 2015 UTC,No one should ever be using a Chrome browser tab to cast video files.
Chromecast,3accmv,Limpeklimpe,8,Thu Jun 18 23:17:54 2015 UTC,Is your TV a smart TV? Can you still try to cast if you unplug your Cheomecast from power? I had the same issue and it turned out my Blueray Player was castable.
Chromecast,3accmv,alexmonocle,3,Thu Jun 18 23:53:55 2015 UTC,Looks like the top one is a chromecast and the bottom is your tv itself. not sure why it wouldn't work but you may want to browse your tv settings for some kind of casting options
Chromecast,3accmv,ladiesman144,5,Fri Jun 19 00:06:52 2015 UTC,I have a smart TV that does the same thing.  It's because you can stream directly to your TV.

(I have a Samsung TV too).  If you live in Europe, you may find that the inbuilt TV app works a little better than Chromecast, since the refresh rate will be 30Hz rather than 25."
Chromecast,3accmv,jamescridland,2,Fri Jun 19 13:26:16 2015 UTC,"YouTube and Netflix were the first to adopt the DIAL standard which allows second screen controls. This preceded the release of Chromecast, with initial support going to the PS3 and many native smart TV apps. Your TV's YouTube app falls in this category, granting you ""Chromecast-like"" controls if the built-in app. I can almost assure you the same will apply to the TV's Netflix app."

Chromecast,3a62o0,limpits,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:15:50 2015 UTC,You don't host anything (share/upload whatever). The files are all hosted by the developers of the app on a Google server.
Chromecast,3a62o0,Elemetrix,-2,Wed Jun 17 18:57:07 2015 UTC,"That is incredibly risky on both ends right?

Chromecast,3a9fh2,PockyBum522,6,Thu Jun 18 13:04:20 2015 UTC,"3 possibilities.   It is a knockoff item designed to look exactly like the real deal.  for $13 bucks it might be worth the risk.  For $20 refurbished or $35 new, maybe not.  If you can only afford it if it is $13 and it turns out to be fake, you have just wasted the short money you have. It is from a warehouse or reseller in China that bought more than they thought they could sell and they are just trying to unload them.  This happens from time to time when products don't do as well overseas as they do here in the US, and you will find products cropping up on ebay for this exact reason. Someone stole a bunch of Chromecasts from a warehouse or elsewhere and are just looking to unload them.   The seller has a good rating, but not a ton of of them, so it looks like someone who sells things from time to time when they come across them, not a business per se.  As with anything, you run a risk when you buy from an international seller on ebay, but you MIGHT get your money back if it turns out it is a dud by making a complaint to paypal and ebay (but I wouldn't hold my breath)."

Chromecast,3a85rz,Ben_Affleck,2,Wed Jun 17 23:57:07 2015 UTC,"A few apps support routing audio to the phone. This means that although the video is playing through the chromecast the audio will come out through the phone. If you have Bluetooth headphones paired to your phone then it should just work. Don't count on many apps having this though, there are literally only a handful of them that actually have this. For a hardware solution you might look into an hdmi audio splitter. That device will split off the audio onto a 3.5mm jack while the video can pass through. Then you could connect a Bluetooth audio transmitter to the audio splitter and then pair your Bluetooth headphones to this audio transmitter. The annoying part here will be managing this audio splitter when you don't want it to be enabled. Perhaps you may be able to find one that has a switch. Good luck."

Chromecast,39ysqg,mattl,2,Mon Jun 15 22:41:11 2015 UTC,I have this issue sometimes with mkv files. Usually the first attempt I make to stream one to my Chromecast I get no sound. But if I stop and restart the sound works fine. I'd always assumed it was an issue with how the videostream app handles mkv files rather than Chromecast but I guess I'm wrong.

Chromecast,3a2lk1,StrikingCrayon,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:35:52 2015 UTC,If you cast Netflix then it uses the chromecast Netflix app. It's only the browser version of Netflix telling the chromecast what video to play.  The chromecast Netflix app plays in 1080p ( I believe).  If its true that chrome only supports 720 Netflix then if you cast the tab that is playing Netflix it will only be in 720. This is because chromecast isn't using the built Netflix app. It's just casting the browser as you see it on your computer.
Chromecast,3a2lk1,mjackl,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:37:45 2015 UTC,"if you watch Netflix on a Google Chrome Browser, it's limited to 720p   Say what? Who said that?"

I've powered from both from plug and via the television's USB port but no difference. The dots do flicker occasionally especially when I connect to WiFi or begin to stream my Netflix or Youtube.   I'll re-try when I get home later this week but possible issue could be that the Chromecast HDMI cable was bent as my living room television is wall mounted and does not have a side port HDMI. This may have broken the HDMI connecter but I can't see any visible damage. If that doesn't work then I'll just opt for another Chromecast from Amazon as I bought this in the US and apparently can't be returned from the UK.

My buddy has an iPhone and MacBook, but got a cheap as free Android tablet when he upgraded his phone from AT&T and he uses it with his Chromecast. He's digging the tablet for media stuff, I'm an Android fanboy so I introduced him to some less-than-legal apps like ShowBox and PopcornTime.

Chromecast,39u9ca,aquowf,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:34:25 2015 UTC,"You'd have to develop using the chromecast SDK... but it wouldn't be terribly difficult to do. You'd have to write a simple receiver application to run on the chromecast; you wouldn't be doing anything new or difficult so you'd be able to rely on existing libraries for encoding and the like. While this would be easy, the receiver will have to be a custom receiver as there is no out of the box support for that MPEG-TS.  As far as a sender application is concerned, it'd be relatively easy to peek at the available multicast streams and select the relevant chromecast; sending instructions to that chromecast to play that stream."
Chromecast,39u9ca,FunkeDope,2,Mon Jun 15 18:03:06 2015 UTC,"Assuming you're talking about an actual multicast stream from like a wlan controller, then yeah, Cisco has a pretty technical guide on the subject. http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/technotes/7-6/chromecastDG76/ChromecastDG76.html"

Chromecast,39u9ca,JimboLodisC,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:21:03 2015 UTC,"Gonna need some clarification.  In the network world, multicast is already a word. Also, it's not completely clear where the ""multi"" comes in. Multiple video sources or multiple Chromecasts?  The way I read it is you want to cast multiple video sources to a single Chromecast, like a splitscreen/PIP kind of layout. Only way to do that is have all video feeding into a powerful PC and then screen-casting it."
Chromecast,39sdj1,Iwate,56,Sun Jun 14 08:06:01 2015 UTC,It's because your Chromecast is plugged into a CEC HDMI port. That will work with any device plugged into that port including an Xbox or bluray player.

Chromecast,39l507,Chocer24,2,Fri Jun 12 14:21:32 2015 UTC,Are you using your TV's usb port or the supplied adapter? It is recommended to use the supplied adapter. Make sure both ends of the USB cord are plugged into the TV/adapter and the other end the chromecast

Chromecast,39l507,xDirty,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:58:37 2015 UTC,Keep in mind if the flicker shows up again it could mean that chromecast is too close to the tv and even the adapter supplied is too close sometimes. I had that problem and had to buy a third party hdmi extension cord to put chromecast much further away. Also keep your router and modem far away from chromecast.

Chromecast,39k0v5,amancarlos,4,Fri Jun 12 07:12:07 2015 UTC,You need three things to get US offers:   A Chromecast bought from the US (having US serial number) A VPN connected to a US server (to connect your Chromecast to). You can set the VPN on your laptop and make a Wi-Fi hotspot to share the VPN internet. A US Google account to redeem the rentals etc.   So essentially you'll be fooling the US Chromecast into thinking that it's being used in the US and the codes/ rentals are being used on a US account.

You open Chrome and enter in the IP address for streaming the movie through browsers on other computers; stream it through the browser to your TV and it works like a charm.   I worked this out after 20 mins of farting around with the app right before putting on the new Avengers movie ;D

Chromecast,39d1vj,redzot,4,Wed Jun 10 23:11:35 2015 UTC,"Define ""not working"".   Does it connect, and you can't cast?  Does it not connect? (you can tell by looking for the AP name in the bottom left corner) Have you factory reset the Chromecast? Which settings menu did you enable Chromecast services in?"
Chromecast,39d1vj,magmapus,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:50:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to work with me. To answer your questions in order:   I am using my Nexus 7 to connect to the Chromecast. The Nexus sees it and begins to walk through the setup wizard. I am able to see the SSID of the network that I am attempting to connect to. The Chromecast I am attempting is briefly recognized by the AP in the IAP software.  I get an authentication error and am directed to the ChromeCast help page. The Help page discusses disableing IP isolation. However I can not find any setting that allows that in the Dell PC-W management console. If it helps I could probably make a video describing the full details and each step. I do want to point out something thats odd: The rest of the ChromeCasts do show up as listed clients however they are blank with an IP Address of 0.0.0.0. The one that I am trying to connect is however recognized with an IP address. This part is a bit of a puzzel but I have a feeling its because of the failed attempts to connect. The AP recognizes it, the Chromecast can see the AP.  See above for description Yes. I have 4 seperate ones and I have reset each of them independantly. Tried to connect to each.  Under the More dropdown I choose Services. I have checked Enable DLNA. Under Airgroup Settings Chromecast, DLNA Media, DLNA Print are all checked. I am not totally sure what the differnce is in Enable DLNA and checking it in the list under Airgroup settings is but I would have assumed that it would be the same. Here is a screenshot   I have a feeling a software patch of somekind is going to be needed but I thought I would give Reddit a shot and see if anyone knows."
Chromecast,39d1vj,magmapus,3,Thu Jun 11 01:55:16 2015 UTC,"IP isolation is almost certainly your problem. Effectively, the AP only allows communication to the network, not to other clients.  Because the app fails to connect, the chromecast goes back to it's setup steps. The IP appears as 0.0.0.0 likely because it isn't connected.    The easiest way to test if this is to try and ping your Nexus from your laptop or other WiFi device.   Check out this link too, the Dell appears to be a rebadge of the Aruba device.  If that doesn't work, I'm afraid I'm out of ideas without modifying your network.  First thing I would try would be to connect your old AP up by Ethernet, with DHCP disabled on it (connect Ethernet to a LAN port). That should work. Connect Chromecast to that AP, and others to the main one.  The Ethernet gap should allow the two devices to communicate."
Chromecast,39dbmc,BlisterKirby,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:19:20 2015 UTC,Screen mirroring works on your own home network. The ISP/Provider wouldn't affect this. Sounds like an issue with your router
Chromecast,39dbmc,StewHax,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:40:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah that may be it, the router may not be strong enough to handle it. Also why did someone downvote the post? All I did was ask an honest question."
Chromecast,39dbmc,danskeman,2,Thu Jun 11 02:56:47 2015 UTC,"Ignore downvoting - some people are just idiots.  Check how many wifi bars you get near the CC e.g. using a mobile phone.  On a scale of 1-4, you should really get 3 or 4 for a steady signal.  What type of router do you have e.g. in UK BT Home hubs have all sorts of problems until you switch of it (really unecesary) smart mode.  Also, worth checking what wifi channel you are on.  It is usually set to auto,  However, often it is best to set it to either channel 1, 6 or 11.  You can get apps for tablets/phones/pcs which check the bands and show how crowded they are.  Sometimes choosing a less  congested bad helps.  You can do by trial an error anyway.  Only three options - do not select any other number than over-lap free bands 1,6,11 (other bands have overlaps).  Another simple test is to use the supplied extension cable for the CC, so you can move it a bit way from the TV.  Another possibility and you are powering the CC using a TV usb socket, it might not be getting quite enough current to function properly,and if the router signal is a bit weaker, that could be enough to prevent steady operation.  Try using a powered hub or plus rated at least 1A.  Finally, if you show router signal is a bit weak, then you may need a wifi extender - we can help advise you on what to do."

Chromecast,399hux,wekulm,4,Wed Jun 10 11:54:44 2015 UTC,"It's better for local content. Wired (100Mbps) handles streaming high bitrate video much better than WiFi. You can have a proper user interface so you can browse your whole library on a 10 foot interface, so picking something to watch with someone else is nicer.  If you're looking for something to run on your pi, I recommend OSMC. It's the successor to RaspBMC, a build of XBMC (now Kodi) on the pi. OSMC comes with its own skin which you may or may not like, but the old Kodi skin (Confluence) is still included or you can grab another skin if you want. How it looks is easy enough to change.   The pi also supports HDMI-CEC, so if your TB supports CEC, you can navigate the UI with your TV's remote. If not, grab Kore (the official remote) for your phone. You can also navigate your library on your phone with Kore as well, if that's your thing."

You can queue up things from your library that you view from your phone or you can browse through the onscreen UI (good for when you have friends over and you want to find a movie). All while using your phone as a remote.   Using OTG for for Ethernet is interesting, but that solution costs more than the Chromecast itself and more than an RPi.  I use both an RPi and a Chromecast.

Chromecast,395zng,mjackl,27,Tue Jun 9 16:19:01 2015 UTC,"Frontline is probably the best long-form journalism on TV, and NOVA is an awesome science/nature show..."
Chromecast,395zng,imatworkprobably,10,Tue Jun 9 16:54:34 2015 UTC,"IMO: America's Test Kitchen, Primal Grill with Steven Raichlen, BBQ with Franklin (it's new), Rick Steves in small doses, Austin City Limits, Downton Abbey, NOVA, and a lot of their docs."

Same with BBC's iPlayer.    Hell, the site alone is pretty nice of us Yankes, if you ask me. :)  EDIT It's worth noting that pbs.org doesn't require you to login to watch shows, but the app does.

Chromecast,395zng,linksoon,2,Wed Jun 10 09:01:17 2015 UTC,LPT: If it's not on the PBS app or you can't get the app to work: a lot of PBS episodes are also on Youtube which can be Chromecast--PBS is pretty halfhearted about enforcing their copyrights.
Chromecast,395zng,linksoon,2,Wed Jun 10 11:45:40 2015 UTC,Also I believe their mobile site uses HTML5 so all their videos can be casted that way as well.

We'd need to know where the files are stored, how you've got it connected to the network, and also various other information about your network like router model, placement of hardware and devices in your home, etc."
Chromecast,39biq0,JimboLodisC,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:58:38 2015 UTC,"The files are stored on the PC hard drive.  I usually keep my movies on a regular (internal) hard drive, but I also tried transfering to a SSD to see if it changes anything. It doesnt.  That PC is wired to my router ( Tp-link TL-WR740N ). Router is then connected to the modem provided by my ISP.  The Tv is about 20 feet away.  On the chromecast idle screen, I get 3 out of 4 bars.   Connected to the wifi is the PC, Chromecast, and my cellphone. I also tried turning off Wifi on my cellphone to see if it improves things. It doesnt.  When running videostream I get the popup about ""buffering"" and that maybe my PC is slowing things down. My processor is an AMD-fx 320. Task manager show a very low PC usage ( always less than 10% )... so maybe its something else."
Chromecast,39biq0,JimboLodisC,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:22:43 2015 UTC,"Any walls or objects between the router and the Chromecast? Are you using the HDMI extender cable to distance the Chromecast from any interference from the TV? Is anything else happening on your network that would be choking bandwidth? Have you analyzed wifi signals in your area for congestion on specific channels?  3 bars means a good connection, but it doesn't guarantee a consistent connection."
Chromecast,39biq0,JimboLodisC,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:26:43 2015 UTC,"The WiFi signal has to go through the bathroom to reach the TV, and I do use the extender.

However as soon as I try to watch local content, its buffering / stutter every 5 seconds. Unwatchable.  I did run a wifi analyzer on my cellphone. I switched channels accordingly. Still no luck. =/"
Chromecast,39biq0,JimboLodisC,2,Wed Jun 10 20:44:12 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming your router is in the same room as the PC.  Does your monitor have an HDMI input? I would try plugging the Chromecast into the monitor so it's on a display that's in the same room as the router. Then use your phone to cast something.  Or if you want to use your PC to cast for this test, plug in the Chromecast in the computer room so it's powered and running, then cast something from the PC, then unplug the PC from the monitor and plug the Chromecast into the monitor's HDMI port.  Also, keep your Chromecast powered from the wall through all of this. Do not use USB ports to provide power, most of the time they don't provide enough current. (I shoulda started off the convo with this point)"
Chromecast,39biq0,zires,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:56:30 2015 UTC,"I did the test.  Had the chromecast with a spare monitor less than 1 meter away from the router. Still, constant buffering.  So the problem is definitely not the WIFI!  My computer should be able to keep up... whats going on?"

However, if you have a second PC/tablet from which you can cast the TV streams, then you can get round this by attaching a second router to you main router and creating a new subnet.  Easy to do with  http://www.tp-link.com/en/products/details/cat-9_TL-WR702N.html  You set up this in ""router"" mode, and connect it to main router with an ethernet cable, giving it a SSID and password different to main router.  (You can do this with almost any spare router but not quite so easy to set up as the TP-Link - if you have a spare router, I can give basic instructions - many guides on web how to connect two router s (LAN socket from main router to WAN socket on new router).  You connect CC  to new router, and then one android/pc etc also connect to new SSID/password (TV streaming one).  The other android/pc connects to main router.  The systems will not interfere any more."

Chromecast,39aq87,Seeda_Boo,2,Thu Jun 11 14:52:10 2015 UTC,Same.  And the outright pure anger of some when it's faulty or not working correctly.  You'd think they spent $250 on it.

Chromecast,3987qf,subduedLion,3,Tue Jun 9 23:27:15 2015 UTC,Try plugging it in with the included adaptor instead of powering from the TV.
Chromecast,3987qf,asjmcguire,1 point,Wed Jun 10 08:48:25 2015 UTC,I tried plugging it into different outlets. All the same. I might just buck up and buy a new one; it's still the best $35 I've ever spent.

It was notable to me because I haven't really seen dropped frames on Chromecast before (at least without a simultaneous drop in video quality)
Chromecast,396u4e,slevinkelevra15,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:23:46 2015 UTC,Does this happen to you with a variety of HBO Go content or just Game of Thrones?  I'm wondering if the service is having problems keeping up with the huge number of people streaming GOT.

Chromecast,395b82,SoggyToeErgo,6,Tue Jun 9 10:42:21 2015 UTC,"IMHO a streaming device is always worth it for the streaming services as you will almost always be seen asa second class citizen when using a PC by many of the content owners who have it written in their contracts that they can't offer 1080p streams to the browser (some don't even allow 720p) and can't offer the full audio options.   The streaming devices don't have any such limitations as the threat of piracy is seen as less with them, as long as your equipment supports it and your internet & wifi connection is fast enough you will generally get the best picture and audio possible.  The only problem you will have is Proxmate won't work unless your mirroring your desktop (which has the same issues then as watching it in the browser) and casting your desktop requires a fairly powerful machine to do it smoothly especially when playing video. You would need instead to get either a SmartDNS service or a VPN and then make sure your router supports VPN's or allows you to either change the DNS settings (and block googles DNS with static routes) or supports IPTables and let's you redirect calls to googles DNS to the SmartDNS service"
Chromecast,395b82,wakey87433,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:57:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I hadn't even thought about PC streaming services not being as good. I think I'll get Chromecast but not play around with VPN or SmartDNS, which sounds a bit complicated for me. I'll just keep everything legit and easy and hopefully Netflix UK will eventually up its game.   Fiddling around with the hdmi cable and selecting where the picture and sound are sent is getting to be a bit of a hassle anyway."
Chromecast,395b82,wakey87433,2,Tue Jun 9 11:34:05 2015 UTC,There are other options which are easier if you want to switch regions. For the same price you can get a FireTV Stick which allows you to set the DNS on the device itself so you then just need to subscribe to a SmartDNS service like unblock-us and when setting up the network choose advanced and plug the dns codes they give you in. Both are good devices (I have both a chromecast and the standard FireTV) and each have their own strengths and weakness so it really depends on what you will mainly do with it. Personally I prefer using Netflix on the FireTV as I don't need another device to do so and its also good as you can sideload things like Kodi to turn it into a full on media device (plus I have Amazon Prime so its useful for watching that content) but there are other things (YouTube for example) which the Chromecast is generally much more convenient to use   The UK version isn't as bad as people often make out imho. I think much of it is that human trait of always thinking the grass is greener so we don't appreciate what we do have. Sure Sky's tactic of locking up all the rights for any show they buy locks us out of some content but equally there are US deals in place that see the US version locked out of content so you will see US people complaining about the lack of content on theirs. As long as there are differences I think everyone will pretty much complain about what their region is missing no matter how much content it actual has as thats just the way people are
Chromecast,395b82,danskeman,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:55:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I always notice one show that US Netflix gets and then I moan about our own service, but I never look for the opposite.   I hadn't considered getting FireTV, which sounds good. I will have a think about what I want from it. Originally it was really only needed for choosing Netflix/Prime videos because the Youtube smartphone pairing thing seems to work pretty well, but Kodi looks like something I'd enjoy - hadn't really heard of it before but I remember people using xmbc. Thanks for all your help."
Chromecast,395b82,TreyWalker,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:56:46 2015 UTC,"For apps which are cast friendly (i.e. have built in casting rather than rely on mirror casting), a simple solution is just to set up a wifi hotspot on PC (see  http://www.7tutorials.com/how-turn-your-windows-81-laptop-wifi-access-point).  Connectify Max does this and is easy very to use but not free ($35).    There are some free wifi hot-spot programs on web but have never tried them.  You then connect PC to internet via vpn or proxmate in normal way.  Then connect CC to wifi hotspot, and then you can cast cats-friendly apps without messing around with routers etc.  Works well in hotels, universities etc."

Chromecast,391kcf,nullstring,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:55:06 2015 UTC,I plugged it into the TV and it worked.  So it appears the issue is with the Audio from HBOGo passing through the receiver.  Any thoughts?
Chromecast,391kcf,nullstring,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:34:12 2015 UTC,Just that your receiver might not be picking up the codec it's sending over.
Chromecast,391kcf,navytank,4,Tue Jun 9 07:26:02 2015 UTC,"What model of receiver do you have?  If you're plugged into an Onkyo receiver, HBOGO may be trying to send DD+ uncompressed audio for your receiver to decode (instead of AAC), so it will be a slightly different mode of operation than being plugged into your TV."
Chromecast,391kcf,monkey_doo,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:15:27 2015 UTC,TX-SR333 is the model number.  I am going to try it in the TV real quick and see if that helps.

Nothing on XDA, nothing in either of the two Google+ communities that I belong to and nothing on Twitter.   I'm not saying that your Chromecast isn't hosed, but to say that Google can't be trusted with updates and that lots of people are having the problem with nothing to back that up seems wrong.   My Chromecasts auto update as do my Nexus Players, Roku 3 and Fire TV. Some get bricked. It happens."
Chromecast,392kwf,dieterdengler,2,Tue Jun 9 00:40:09 2015 UTC,"Agree. To me, the issue isn't that some people got bricked Chromecasts, but rather that google hasn't acknowledged the issue or replaced devices that were out of warranty."

Never had a Nexus Player or anything prior to these devices like a Boxee Box or WDtv.  With the dangers of losing power during a firmware flash, you'd think the smart thing to do would be to inform the owner NOT to pull the plug. Not so much a concern with devices that people know to plug into the wall, but these dongles for some reason make people think the USB port on their TV is suddenly an untapped resource.  Turn off your TV in the middle of an update? Come here with red light issues."
Chromecast,392kwf,arrowrand,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:41:44 2015 UTC,"Even if the Chromecast waited for user input to update, that wouldn't remove the possibility of there being a power outage, or even turning the TV off while updating on a non powered USB.

Chromecast,38xv9n,Schumarker,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:08:59 2015 UTC,"The downside being that your method utilizes Bluetooth, which has a fairly limited range.  The method shown here functions over WiFi and therefore can function anywhere in a large house or business where Bluetooth is not practical.  Additionally, a large number of devices can be used to control the system in this setup, whereas with Bluetooth, it is single feed only.

Chromecast,38xv9n,TrueJudgment,3,Mon Jun 8 00:46:55 2015 UTC,The adapter is a hdmi to vga / stereo 3.5mm headphone jack. So basically its taking the audio stream from the chromecasts hdmi output and just turning it into stereo audio through the 3.5mm jack.
Chromecast,38xv9n,mcd1992,0,Mon Jun 8 00:55:52 2015 UTC,But why not just plug headphones into whatever device is being used to control the chromecast instead of casting in the first place?
Chromecast,38xv9n,TrueJudgment,4,Mon Jun 8 01:10:01 2015 UTC,"Since this was probably done because the speakers don't have Bluetooth capabilities, probably so they can use their phone/tablet as a remote, and not have it strapped to the speakers."

Chromecast,38v3bq,Tbrooks,2,Sun Jun 7 18:58:36 2015 UTC,"In the subreddit sidebar, you can see that we have tags saying [live], [UC], and [Req]. This means means they are marked when they are live, upcoming, or if you have a request. Once the streams are finished, they are marked with an expired flair. Is this what you meant by easily seeing the stream info?"
Chromecast,38v3bq,Tbrooks,2,Sun Jun 7 19:02:31 2015 UTC,"I missed that 'expired' tag when i looked, It is probably impossible but if that could be made larger or darker to kinda override the original title. I don't think reddit allows that but still that expired flair, essentially does what i was thinking to distinguish between working links and non working ones."

Chromecast,38z8t5,GazaIan,2,Mon Jun 8 02:22:45 2015 UTC,"The problem was setting up the device. You need that second device if you're setting up an SSID for the first time. If the Chromecast is already set to look for your hotspot when it powers up, then you don't need a second device.  The problem with setting up on a new SSID with just one device is you need to connect to the Chromecast using wifi, and turning on hotspot will disconnect you from all wifi connections. So you directly connect to the Chromecast over wifi to begin setup, but when you get to the point in setup where it asks you to which SSID to connect to for internet access, you won't be able to find your phone's hotspot because it wouldn't be running."
Chromecast,38z8t5,JimboLodisC,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:20:53 2015 UTC,I don't think this is chromecast related as such.  It is more to do with your phone.    Android phones have traditionally allowed the phone to be in either normal mode or hotspot mode but not both at same time.   However some phones are capable of doing both at same time.
Chromecast,38z8t5,danskeman,1 point,Mon Jun 8 09:36:50 2015 UTC,But his phone is not doing both - he said he's using data.
Chromecast,38z8t5,Habbie,1 point,Mon Jun 8 09:51:58 2015 UTC,Was the Chromecast already setup to use the phone hotspot for the network - or were you able to connect to the Chromecast and configure it - while you were running the hotspot at the same time? It's the configuring part that required 2 devices - because you can't broadcast a wireless network and also connect to another wireless network at the same time.
Chromecast,38z8t5,asjmcguire,1 point,Mon Jun 8 10:49:44 2015 UTC,"It was already configured, I was being lazy and decided to rename my hotspot on my Nexus 6 as my home network so I wouldnt have to do any additional setup. Then to my surprise the cast buttons started appearing on the Nexus 6 in all cast supporting apps."
Chromecast,38z8t5,asjmcguire,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:11:21 2015 UTC,Yup - that'll be why then - you have mostly always been able to use the Chromecast this way - although some apps - for some reason don't show the cast button.
Chromecast,38z8t5,ChinoLatino,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:18:09 2015 UTC,Been doing this for awhile now. The only time you need two devices its when you are setting up the Chromecast. You will find that some apps will need two devices to cast.

Chromecast,38x0cv,asjmcguire,2,Sun Jun 7 18:27:09 2015 UTC,you could try setting up a separate network just for your chromecast with a password that only you know. if the network isn't being used the overall bandwidth won't be effected. most routers allow for a second network often called a guest network.
Chromecast,38x0cv,diatho,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:44:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah that would be the way I'd go. Even my crap Virgin Super hub allows me to set up guest networks for which only I would know the password. Every time I'd want to chromecast, I would have to use that network."

Beauty of this approach is you do not even need to touch main router.  Won't work with android etc, but will work with the cheap windows 8 tablets (works on my Linx 8).  Guides for windows 7 also available (I think commands are  the same).  See  http://www.7tutorials.com/how-turn-your-windows-81-laptop-wifi-access-point  You can buy connectify max which does the above and is very easy to use (does a lot more as well)."

Chromecast,38xlsl,jrlizardking,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:33:26 2015 UTC,Not with one tap - but you can cast any app to the Chromecast and immediately disconnect once it has loaded. That will plonk you back to the desktop. YouTube or Play music are good for this.

Chromecast,38xkvd,asjmcguire,4,Sun Jun 7 18:52:35 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify further - when you stream Netflix via the Chromecast icon - your Chromecast isn't streaming from your laptop - the Chromecast goes off to the internet and fetches the video itself - your laptop isn't involved in the process once you have told the Chromecast what to play. Your laptop can tell the Chromecast to play and pause and change the volume while it is playing - but as has been pointed out by someone else - you can essentially be as far away as your WiFi network will reach. As for guest mode - if you know the pin number for the Chromecast (and you can see this in the Chromecast android app) you don't need to be within 25ft of your Chromecast - you don't even need to be in the same room or on the same (or any) WiFi network. As long as you have some form of data connection and are get the ""nearby"" option - that's all that is needed."
Chromecast,38xkvd,asjmcguire,0,Sun Jun 7 19:53:00 2015 UTC,"Actually guest mode needs you to be quite close to the device as it uses sound to pair. You'll see you can pair as the Chromecast will show up as ""nearby device"". Obviously you need to be nearby to use the nearby device feature."
Chromecast,38sk9m,Quaternions_FTW,14,Sat Jun 6 13:17:23 2015 UTC,"In general you can continue casting local data to the Chromecast via any app that casts local data AFTER you load the app on the Chromecast. It needs the internet connection to load the app in the first place, but it stays in memory as long as you don't turn off the Chromecast or load a different app. For example this works with Plex. It's easy enough to test with other apps. Just start the app, and then shut off your internet connection (e.g., pull the internet cable from the router). Test if you can still cast local data."
Chromecast,38sk9m,DPAmes1,3,Sat Jun 6 14:50:03 2015 UTC,How exactly do casting apps cast local files?
Chromecast,38sk9m,mr_pablo,2,Sat Jun 6 17:44:13 2015 UTC,"When you cast a local file, e.g., from your own server or your phone, it goes directly to the Chromecast over the LAN. No outside connection is required. But since the Chromecast loads all apps from the internet on demand, an internet connection is required initially for the Chromecast to load the app."
Chromecast,38sk9m,DPAmes1,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:33:00 2015 UTC,Do you know how it sends the files exactly? I've done a bit of chromecast development but can't find any details about local casting.

Internet goes down and you just want to watch a movie on you have stored on your phone. If you aren't worried about data overages you could level the mobile data on and the Chromecast would operate as normal.
Chromecast,38sk9m,the_doughboy,5,Sat Jun 6 16:51:40 2015 UTC,Internet goes down and you just want to watch a movie on you have stored on your phone.   Your local network should still work fine in this case.
Chromecast,38sk9m,the_doughboy,2,Sat Jun 6 21:08:20 2015 UTC,Doesn't the Chromecast still have Internet via the Mobile Hotspot?
Chromecast,38sk9m,JimboLodisC,2,Sat Jun 6 13:49:08 2015 UTC,"No, because the last step (last two pictures on the imgur link) is to press the ""mobile data"" button.  This turns off your mobile data connection, but leaves open the hotspot.  Essentially turning your phone into an antenna that picks up the content from another device (or its own local storage) and throws it onto the Chromecast."
Chromecast,38sk9m,chimbori,3,Sat Jun 6 13:53:00 2015 UTC,"So turn off the data after you've started casting. The Chromecast would still need the initial connection over the hotspot, but I agree that once the localcast has started it can be turned off."
Chromecast,38sk9m,DPAmes1,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:00:16 2015 UTC,"Precisely. I tested the Chromecast without turning off mobile data and it began to eat up the data at a regular pace.

The Chromecast will then just connect to the mobile hotspot, not caring that it's the hotspot instead of the home network. I do this so none of my devices need to be reconfigured when I stop using my router and start using a tethered phone. It just works."
Chromecast,38sk9m,y0smokey,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:44:46 2015 UTC,Actually I've encountered problems in the past with assuming that the Chromecast will automatically connect to any WiFi network that has the same SSID name as the network it is configured for. It doesn't. I don't know why.
Chromecast,38sk9m,JimboLodisC,5,Mon Jun 8 16:48:39 2015 UTC,"Step by Step (no pictures):   Gather two devices One must be an Android cell phone with mobile hotspot capability The second can be any device that is capable of casting local media open ""settings"" on cell phone open ""more networks"" select ""mobile hotspot"" turn on ""mobile hotspot"" go into ""mobile hotspot"" settings by selecting the 3 vertical dots in the upper-right corner select configure hotspot type in a name you would like to call your mobile hotspot network or leave the default name scroll down to choose a password for this network   Now we must switch the Wi-Fi network that the Chromecast is paired to.   ensure that the second device (the one you wish to cast from) is connected to the same network that the Chromecast is paired to (the pairing was done when you first setup your Chromecast) open the Chromecast app (if using iOS or Android) or open Chrome if using Linux, Windows, or MacOS From the app choose the name of the Chromscast or from Chrome select the Chromecast icon in the upper-right of the screen and then choose the name of the Chromecast Select ""Wi-Fi"" Select the name of the network you are on (this will drop-down a menu with other networks) Select the name of the mobile hotspot network you created and enter password This will successfully switch the network that the Chromecast looks to connect to   Now we will open LocalCast app and cast the video we desire.

That was fun."
Chromecast,38swok,earsizzle,0,Sat Jun 13 07:22:21 2015 UTC,Is it powered by the TV or through the wall adapter? I think the only way it can turn the TV on by itself is if it is powered externally.  Maybe try powering it via a USB port on the TV so it can only be on if the TV is?
Chromecast,38swok,Joe_bang_bus,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:29:54 2015 UTC,Its powered through the wall. I think I can always turn off the HDMI CEC settings so it doesn't turn TV on.

Chromecast,38qfnp,andrew28_reddit,-1,Thu Jun 11 14:21:40 2015 UTC,"You are very likely affected by an issue that many people experienced with Chromecast Firmware 31432. It is when there is a red light and symptoms include black screens, spinning logo than black screen, ""Chromecast..."" boot loader screen, works all of a sudden until there is a reboot by unplugging power and replugging it back in. Google says they are aware of the Chromecast problems and suggest you send feedback with this. Google has not given us an update for 2 weeks about this serious issue. This dude on Chromecast Product Forums is contacting google and saying this: <See these links to the ongoing problems and Googles lack of a proper response. It is time for an uprising.  See;   https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chromecast/q-q9T8KOTRk and    https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chromecast/iC1c7cAJgzg   To EVERYONE on this forum. I just posted this following message to Google; Kisha. It has been 2 weeks now. I know you are still testing the units, but we customers want a straight answer, and now. Regardless of what you determine the fix to be: Are you going to replace or repair our units at no cost to us regardless of if they are still under warranty or not?  There is no reason why you can not answer that question. It is all about whether Google has integrity and will do the right thing. No more beating around the bush and telling us that your working on it. Are you going to stand behind your product?    If we do not receive a ADEQUATE response back from Google in no more than 3 days, then they have no intention of standing behind their product or their update mistake. At that point ALL of us need to NOT reward Google by buying a replacement unit from them. Why should we give them more money for not standing behind their product. Buy a Fire Stick or other product. Also do not just keep quiet. That is what they are hoping for, that we will just quietly go away. We need to post on as many other sites and message boards as possible. As a tech admin, I will be posting on all of my forums about this outrageous lack of response and integrity. Do NOT GO QUIETLY. We may not be able to force them to do the right thing but we can surely go out fighting. It may only be $35 but that is not the point. Get the word out. https://productforums.google.com/d/msg/chromecast/62JHlCztdyo/G08VcCSFNikJ  TL;DR (read it anyway please): You are affected by a major Chromecast problem affecting Firmware 31432, Google for 2 weeks says they are fixing it but are not giving us updates. Keep watching Reddit & Google Product Forums for updates."

There was no real content, no news, no tips, no advice...just a table covered in Chromecast devices.

Chromecast,38qvht,CyberBlueZ,6,Sat Jun 6 08:04:57 2015 UTC,And don't forget anyone in the EU who is affected - Google cannot refuse to fix it - they might only supply a 1 year warranty - but they are held to different consumer rules in the EU - they broke it - they need to fix it.
Chromecast,38qvht,asjmcguire,4,Sat Jun 6 02:49:13 2015 UTC,"By EU law, they have to give 2 years warranty minimum."
Chromecast,38qvht,nomis789,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:24:00 2015 UTC,Yup - but even after that 2 years - if you think the device has died unexpectedly before a reasonable period of time - it's a fairly cheap device so lets say 4 years - you can still argue for them to fix it - especially as in the case of the Chromecast - the user cannot deny a firmware update - and it can be proven now that Google killed it remotely. An EU court would side with the consumer on this one.
Chromecast,38qvht,CyberBlueZ,1 point,Sat Jun 6 09:39:47 2015 UTC,"Actually the fact its a cheap device means a reasonable period may be lower then you think. That said the primary factor taken into account would likely be that google are still supporting the device with official firmware and it was their undeniable  update that caused the issue.  A reasonable period is a tricky thing to define within the context of these laws and the device costing only £30 means it could be considered more easily replaceable and to have a lower build quality and therefore reasonable the usage periods be less you think.  (I'm not a lawyer, this isn't legal advice, I am simply stating my understanding if the law from the perspective of a consumer who has had to enact this law before for other things)"
Chromecast,38qvht,asjmcguire,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:43:28 2015 UTC,"Even if that's true, it's still 2 years minimum."
Chromecast,38qvht,nomis789,1 point,Sat Jun 6 11:57:25 2015 UTC,I think the fact that Google have admitted culpability would be why the courts would side with the consumer :)

Chromecast,38qvht,nomis789,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:17:24 2015 UTC,"It's a bit hacky but - I know AutoWear sends commands back to the phone when the watch is connected and disconnected - so you could essentially set up a tasker profile that puts the phone into silent / priority mode when the phone screen is unlocked and the watch is connected, and then puts it back into normal mode when the phone screen is off and the watch is connected.

Chromecast,38qvht,asjmcguire,2,Sun Jun 7 15:43:39 2015 UTC,"Or indeed Australia, where any manufacturer warranty is in addition to legal rights which say ""reasonable expectation"", which for a sold state device is probably going to be circa 2-3 years at least. It also talks about ""defects not obvious at the time of purchase"" and I think any induced defect by manufacturer action would also be covered under that heading too.  Apple got beaten up over their attempt at forcing a 12 month warranty and were made to change it. Hell, even suggesting that it's not covered is an illegal act...   Outside the US the consumer generally has quite a few rights, which don't stop at 12 months."

This is very limited, but it does work for videos served with the ""video"" tag on any browser.  Basically the bookmarklet looks for usable video source tags, and if found, it sends the video's URL via a URL get parameter to a web server on a device with castnow installed. The web server passes the video's URL to castnow and castnow sends the video information to the Chromecast.  I'm not sure what else could be done with this type of approach, but it would be interesting to see if certain features of the Chromecast JS library could be faked to allow non-Chrome browsers to cast video via a tool like castnow."

I don't think I've ever gotten surround from HBO, but it seems like some Google Movies have it and others don't. Ditto for Netflix.  It's pretty annoying-- I get that it's supposed to be a better format, but it sucks to need to upgrade your amp so your $35 streaming device can play audio in the same number of channels that a $30 DVD player could 15 years ago. I'd rather have ""inferior"" AC3 in 6 channels than ""superior"" stereo.  The FireTV stick does play HBO in surround, but they've got a horrible audio sync problem that doesn't exist with Netflix or other programs on the Stick.   Hoisting the black flag has been the only consistent way I've seen to get working surround on either of these devices."

Chrome cast couldn't handle most files in the XBMC server for transforming purposes and my desktop has to do a ton of transforming for Plex too. I would suggest you go for a media server over a NAS. A NAS isn't really that much cheaper and with the media server, you have the option of actually using it as a desktop or an HTC if desired"

The new Remote Display API that allows developers to use the Chromecast as a second screen - essentially mirroring an off-screen render from your device to the Chromecast - which opens up a whole new level of possibilities for the existing hardware."

You can still use your tablet while you streaming the movie or whatever to your TV through your chromecast. If you ever need support they are very quick to respond. I set mine up 2 months ago and am so happy with it that I bought a subscription to have more features."
Chromecast,38j0ry,wantsomeAIDS,8,Thu Jun 4 18:49:47 2015 UTC,"You will need plex running as a server to get its full benefits (thumbnail art, etc). I have a Synology NAS and Plex isn't supported on it. So i have to have a computer running just because of that. My Synology does do DLNA (which is what Plex uses) but it's limited and doesn't transcode on the fly (extremely important for frustration free playing).   If you build the NAS yourself or get a more powerful one with a quality cpu, it could support Plex.   If OP wants to get by cheap, he can do simple DLNA with a NAS and Chromecast, but its not nearly as polished a solution.   My suggestion is to build/get a NAS that supports Plex. Go to the Plex website for direction on that."

Provided they are in a formats recognised by the Chromecast and TV, yes. These are the supported codecs for the Chromecast. You'll have to check what your TV supports. This will probably only be an issue in terms of sound that in some cases the Chromecast will hand off to a compatible device i.e. AC3 (Dolby Digital) audio.   If I am ""casting"" web media from a PC to the TV, can I use that PC for other things at the same time?   Casting from the browser (I assume you're using Chrome) will only cast from one tab. Simply go to another tab or switch to the desktop/other application. The performance of this will depend on your PC hardware."
Chromecast,38j0ry,Olijames,3,Thu Jun 4 16:09:02 2015 UTC,Synology have built in Chromecast support in to thier dsm software. All you need to do is install the app and then you can cast without a pc.

I have not had luck yet and am still using my brite-view network media player without a hitch.   I bought my chromecast for $20 and knew what I was getting into. It's finicky with formats and choppy at times, but playing videos off of websites and using Google play music and movies and TV is flawless.   Which nas do you have?"
Chromecast,38j0ry,memtiger,2,Thu Jun 4 17:44:48 2015 UTC,This is where PLEX works wonders. It transcodes everything on the fly to a supported format. The problem is your NAS has to be powerful enough to transcode. Only the good/expensive ones do.
Chromecast,38j0ry,wredditcrew,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:27:43 2015 UTC,"Without a PC in between? Technically yes, but you need some sort of device to control the chromecast and if playing content off the NAS, something to catalyse the process. An Android phone would do the job.   You could possibly use Plex, having your PC acting as a Plex server.   But I'd be tempted to put together a low end HTTC, or look at the new gen Raspberry Pi?   I don't think the Chromecast is necessary the best tool given your requirements."

Chromecast,38f7gv,TreeFiddyBot,2,Thu Jun 4 18:18:48 2015 UTC,"We have 8 in our office. We use them because they're device agnostic for wireless.  We've found wireless HDMI to be hit-or-miss, not supported on Mac, and sometimes specific brands will compress the stream so data isn't readable.  Chromecasts aren't for streaming video or rapid motion, there's a visible delay, but for 98% of our needs they work great.  Mac, PC, Android, and iOS for supported apps.  Like /u/makked pointed out, there's no full screen mirroring on iOS."
Chromecast,38f7gv,zmont420,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:42:25 2015 UTC,"There's no limitation, except possibly phone screen casting that can't be done from iPhones. YouTube and a lot of video apps in both android and iOS support Chromecast. They also just need to use Chrome browser."

Would it be easy for me to use a chromecast to display a static menu I create in excel? Is there a better way to do this? From yourr other comments it sounds like this is exactly what you're doing. Is the program you wrote what makes it display nicely on the screen? I don't have much experience with the chromecast. I just was wanting to use a TV as a tap list at a bar. I appreciate any advice.

Chromecast,38f7gv,for_ffxiv_sake,4,Thu Jun 4 06:11:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can totally display a food/drink menu with a Chromecast. If you only have one cast, there's a ton of options. You could tab-cast anything, or photo-cast a fullscreen image.  Multiple casts is where it gets more complex. The easiest option is to set the backdrops to an image, but that will show the normal cast information at the bottom of the screen. It's up to you whether that's cool. On the upside, you get image rotation built in.  If you want ultimate control over multiple casts you have to use some sort of digital signage software. What I'm working on would work if it was ready, I believe you can also use solutions like Rise Vision (disclaimer, have never used these guys)."

Chromecast,38f7gv,deftdrummer,25,Wed Jun 3 20:54:16 2015 UTC,"We have about a dozen info displays, which are wall-mounted and run in-house display software. We also have Casts in lounge areas for streaming. We usually have some in conference rooms, but most people feel more comfortable Airplaying to our Apple TVs (which we literally only use for airplay).  I have our in-house solution posted on Github but it's not suitable for general usage yet. Basically it's a Meteor app with a ""display"" (receiver) component and a ""control"" (senderish) component. It supports Chromecasts but also doesn't require them in any way, which makes it a pretty flexible system for us. Almost all of them still have offers... when someone mentions it I usually let them hop on and grab one but overall they just sit there ¯\_(ツ)_/¯   When I call our components sender/receiver it's a huge stretch. There's only enough code to allow launching the app on a display. From there all communication and configuration happens outside of Cast tech, and the Cast will run the app until interrupted with something else. This means you can rapid-fire down the target list because the app literally just has to launch."
Chromecast,38f7gv,javitogomezzzz,7,Wed Jun 3 21:21:48 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's very cool. Thanks for going into such detail.  I have next to zero programming experience (plan to fix, honest).  I always liked the idea of all TVs in a house running Chromecasts then a media PC that could get the streams (multiple screens to one source) then pir sensors to turn on and route the video. And turn them off after a short time out of room  Then you could set for example Netflix and it would follow."

Our products are not nearly related to digital signage, it's more a pet project for me - I started really early, a couple weeks after launch with a multifunction interactive-focused cast thing that had a functional pong multiplayer.  Basically what I learned is casts are great for static content or video content. So I leveraged them for static content since everyone already does video, and am working on an open source project to manage a fleet of Chromecasts, even when you aren't near them.  We're very interested in the Chromebits because of better performance and wifi, and the possibility of ethernet support, not to mention having the normal ChromeOS kiosk mode to let you set up an auto-starting app (like Chromeboxes can do).

I wish this thread had been posted 3 months ago when we were still using Chromecasts at work (raspberry Pis now) few things though.  1. Do you find a ton of network traffic? Between 1 casting PC and 3 Casts I was getting close to 76gb of local traffic daily.  2. What does the program/interface you are using look like? I am fascinated by it <3 3. Will you release it, I should so pay to use it.  4. Ever spoken to anyone at google about this project/program I am sure they would love to hear/know of it"
Chromecast,38f7gv,Badwolf2013,3,Thu Jun 4 07:33:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your interest! We used to use raspberry pi's at work, and I'm glad we switched - they are so bad at web content! Chromecasts, while not exactly fast, are noticeably faster at loading web stuff. You also don't need a bunch of wireless keyboards and the form factor is better. It's win/win.   Haven't had an issue with traffic. It sounds like you were sending video streams to the casts. I'm running a native app on the cast hardware, using an awesome framework that syncs a copy of the database down to every client and keeps everything up to date. Even the Wi-Fi dropping doesn't bother anything. I don't have recent screenshots handy right now, but basically the control UI has a card for each display (online, offline, or waiting to pair) and each card has a drop down to assign a certain role to that display. They also have dynamic config fields that depend on the role, like calendars to display, metric layout, etc. The UI also has other pages for system wide config, like credentials. The code isn't generally ready for public use, but I have it public anyway. I will post here when I release 1.0. I hope to have a hosted version online at that time. Nope but that would be cool! I haven't bothered contacting anyone because the system has been nice enough to me and I'm a good problem solver when something acts up. Would still be nice to chat someday."
Chromecast,38f7gv,op12,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:59:25 2015 UTC,"Our raspberries PIs are all run on a client server system (called CastberryPi) so no wireless keyboards just a nano WiFi USB and HDMI out. Runs videos and websites smoother then the Chromecast setup we had for 6 months. As for your setup seems I quite miss understood what you were doing, still fricking awesome. Wish I understood a bit more about hardware (and github for that sake too) to give it a shot. I'll keep an eye out for anything you post over the next year or so :p"
Chromecast,38f7gv,alpain,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:17:15 2015 UTC,"If you were sending video streams to the Casts then I totally believe that the RPI setup worked better. And centralized control helps with a couple of my favorite RPI issues! (Just not performance...)  It's okay to not know the technicals behind this stuff. That's why I'm trying to make a control UI that anyone can pick up and try. I know way too much about the limitations, but you shouldn't have to to use prebuilt software!"

Chromecast,38f7gv,Ricktron3030,2,Thu Jun 4 06:19:24 2015 UTC,This really makes me giggle. I've always loved my Chromecast and when my company moved to a bigger office last year I thought it was a bit of a waste when they shelled out to put apple tvs in every meeting room. The best part was when after ordering and setting up all these apple TVs the IT guy found out you can only have so many apple TVs on a single network. Ultimately 5+ apple TVs were returned and then a decision was made that being able to wirelessly stream to displays in the office was unnecessary. :/
Chromecast,38f7gv,kayakyakr,2,Thu Jun 4 13:29:57 2015 UTC,"To be fair, if everyone has Apple hardware, Airplay will function the best hands down. It has its own laundry list of problems and bugs but OS integration, crazy low lag, and displaying the full screen w/ mouse and sound no questions asked just pulls non-tech people in.  Airparrot is with looking at if you want the same kind of thing. It lives in the OSX menu and supports extending your screen to a Chromecast and other nice things. I think lag is slightly higher though.  Nexus Players have great performance/wifi and start up a mirror session as fast as an apple TV but Airparrot doesn't work with them :("

Chromecast,38hopu,mo0kie,3,Thu Jun 4 07:45:45 2015 UTC,There's a google forum with growing noise if anyone wants to add to it - looks like there are multiple problems with the new firmware: https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/chromecast/q-q9T8KOTRk/Cp7oITxC8FEJ
Chromecast,38hopu,TrapThem,5,Thu Jun 4 11:05:29 2015 UTC,So they pushed an update that killed my Chromecast and they tell me that since it's outside of warranty that there isn't anything they can do and tell me my only option is to purchase a new one. What the fuck.
Chromecast,38hopu,TrapThem,5,Thu Jun 4 14:49:37 2015 UTC,Have you contacted Google? This is what they told you? That's not on.
Chromecast,38hopu,TrapThem,4,Thu Jun 4 14:50:21 2015 UTC,"Yes I called Google. The lady that I spoke with had me try a couple of things that didn't work. She then asked when I bought it, I was honest and told her about 18 months ago. She said it was past the warranty and that she would have to see if she could get special permission to replace my Chromecast. She put me on hold for a few minutes and then she gets back on and said she did everything she could and that they told her no. So I then asked if the only option I had to fixing this is to buy a new Chromecast and she said ""yes, please do"" and then something about how they would really appreciate it if I did."
Chromecast,38hopu,SteveWallace222,4,Thu Jun 4 14:58:26 2015 UTC,Well don't leave it there. Contact the folks in the help forum I linked to above (the firmware announcement) and someone else may have posted the link too. Make as much of a fuss as possible. I can't see them ignoring so many people who's devices they bricked with an update we have no way of stopping.

Chromecast,38hopu,koukouki,3,Thu Jun 4 15:06:06 2015 UTC,"To ALL    I seem to be one of the most vocal about this issue ( on dozens of other forums) about the lack of proper response we have all seen over the last 2 weeks. I absolutely believe in following the rules and requests of any software/hardware provider. Until today, Google has remained largely silent on this issue and simply said""were working on it"" Hundreds of us have done as they requested but received no response.  NOW they have finally started to replace units damaged by their update, if it is covered by the one year warranty. If you have a bad unit you need to call them at one of these numbers, and speak with a service tech.   https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/6025971  I am still fighting for all of you affected by this issue. I have asked if they plan on replacing devices not still under the 1 year warranty. This seems only fair since it was caused by their update and no fault of our own. I will let you know IF I ever receive an answer.  If they do not step up to the plate and do the right thing, then we will all need to take it to the web and fight for our rights. This will include those of us that did get it replaced under warranty. We all need to stand together even if we have received a new unit. All that is needed for evil to prevail is for good people to do nothing."

Chromecast,38mu1o,devobd,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:03:47 2015 UTC,I don't think it's possible since each app implements it's own control system.
Chromecast,38mu1o,qdhcjv,0,Sat Jun 6 00:40:06 2015 UTC,I think its possible it does have the ability to turn on my TV when I click cast to screen.
Chromecast,38mu1o,danskeman,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:45:50 2015 UTC,Part of HDMI-CEC is being able to turn on the TV when the device turns on. That doesn't mean it can control everything else attached.  Right now what is allowed is for your TV or AV receiver remote to control play/pause in any app running on The Chromecast that has implemented it.
Chromecast,38layp,rocknmandan,3,Thu Jun 4 23:18:59 2015 UTC,Plex might be an option but Videostream really should work.  Take your PS4 and Xbox out of the picture. You can cast Plex for free by going to http://plex.tv/web/app
Chromecast,38dsj6,MrT-1000,8,Wed Jun 3 15:44:37 2015 UTC,"The latency on chromecast is pretty high, also the CPU/GPU on your phone will now not only have to render/emulate the game but also transcode it to a video file that can be played by the chromecast (not to mention network overhead).  Which will likely be a bit too much for most devices (maybe the shield tablet/Nexus9 might be able to, but i'm not sure).  However, it's a really cool idea"
Chromecast,38dsj6,sirleechalot,3,Wed Jun 3 17:43:36 2015 UTC,Google just announced a game controller API for chromecast to use phones and videogame controllers. I think it would work quite nicely for an idea like this...
Chromecast,38dsj6,schwiz,2,Wed Jun 3 21:22:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, i'm well aware, but the video still needs to get to the TV.  Which means the phone has to not only emulate the system, but render the output to a video stream (not an easy task CPU wise) and then serve it up for the TV to grab.  Additionally, from what i've come to understand, the latency is still really high for streamed video.  As a test, load up an HTML5 or flash game in Chrome and cast the tab to your TV.  You'll notice that there's about a 1-2 second delay.  That'll completely kill gameplay in most scenarios"
Chromecast,38dsj6,sirleechalot,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:25:43 2015 UTC,"Well, yes and no. The stream could possibly be coming from some backend game logic server although so far bandwidth in this country isn't quite enough to handle something like that.   However, I don't think it would be too big of a strain on the device to generate that output. Its already doing that when you play the game on the device. Assume you get 60FPS when playing w/o chromecast it stands to reason generating a second video stream would impact that FPS by less than half as both stream would be using much of the same core game logic."
Chromecast,38dsj6,schwiz,3,Wed Jun 3 21:29:57 2015 UTC,"Not really no.  First, if the stream was coming from a backend game logic server, that means that, you'd have to host a server to do that (or someone else would have to, which has major legal ramifications).  Second, just because the emulator is redering the video and showing it on your screen doesn't mean that the output is able to just be sent right to the Chromecast.  The frames need to be encoded to a video format that the chromecast can understand.  Check out nvidia's gamestream or steam's in home streaming to see what i'm talking about.  You'll essentially need to do that on your phone and even desktops with lower end discreet GPUs have issues with that and those are orders of magnitude more powerful than most phones.  EDIT: To be clear, i'm not saying this is bad/impossible.  Just that it's not likely to be possible with current hardware."
Chromecast,38dsj6,sirleechalot,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:41:34 2015 UTC,Android has APIs for multiple screens. I imagine it should be possible to leverage this and output the second display to chromecast. Probably far from trivial to get it up and running though.
Chromecast,38dsj6,schwiz,2,Wed Jun 3 21:45:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think my meaning is getting across. Just because it has an api doesn't mean that it can do that without using a lot of system resources. If you were to use miracast that would be more lightweight, but for the Chromecast, it needs to use significant system resources to do the casting"
Chromecast,38dsj6,sirleechalot,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:30:17 2015 UTC,I still suspect current hardware could have playable framerates. Could be wrong.
Chromecast,38dsj6,schwiz,2,Wed Jun 3 23:12:39 2015 UTC,"The latest tablets like the shield and the nexus 9 probably could. Shield has twitch streaming built in, so I'm fairly sure it could. But a majority of hardware would have issues I'd bet"
Chromecast,38dsj6,sirleechalot,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:29:19 2015 UTC,"Nice Androids (most that have official screen-to-cast mirroring at least, nexus 5 and later in that line) have dedicated hardware to encode a video stream and the hardware can basically just shoot the output over wifi. And rendering two screens at once isn't really that hard. Every DS emulator already renders both screens. The only difference is the targets will both be a bit bigger."
Chromecast,38dsj6,danopia,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:17:47 2015 UTC,"Correct, however the latency in that is typically suboptimal for gaming at least in my experience."
Chromecast,38dsj6,sirleechalot,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:52:45 2015 UTC,"So you agree that latency is the main issue? :p in optimal settings (using a nexus player, both devices are on the 5GHz band, no abnormal interference, etc) the latency gets extremely low, sometimes not even noticeable. It really just depends on the situation and network. The more bottleneck you add the worse it will get."
Chromecast,38dsj6,danopia,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:00:04 2015 UTC,Quite true.  I do local streaming of games via my PC and i know it's possible to get a great experience out of it.  What were you using as a test?
Chromecast,38dsj6,sirleechalot,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:23:05 2015 UTC,"If we're talking streaming games in general, I steam-stream from an Alienware Alpha to a macbook (and some linux things sometimes) where both devices are on 5GHz and even though input has to hop wireless to the Alienware, get processed and rendered, then streamed and wireless-hopped back to my laptop, I often literally cannot notice the latency. Often times I will utterly forget that the game isn't running locally and go hours like that. I beat a Super Hexagon level or two with that setup :)  Of course Casting isn't that awesome, but input doesn't have to hop the wireless stack, so it doesn't have to hit as high of a bar."
Chromecast,38dsj6,danopia,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:06:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah i've done similar with my shield tablet (streaming from PC to it) and the input latency isn't bad at all.  However, my comments were more geared towards using the mobile device as the host instead of as the client.  I know that miracast typically requires built in hardware and has pretty low latency/overhead, however I don't know that the chromecast casting uses that same hardware.  I mean, try loading up a current DS emulator and trying to cast that to the TV, see how it is.  I'm not home right now, but it's worth trying."
Chromecast,38dsj6,sirleechalot,4,Thu Jun 4 15:08:42 2015 UTC,Maybe with the new APIs they'll finally get around to working on this.
Chromecast,38dsj6,JimboLodisC,3,Wed Jun 3 16:37:19 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard anything, but that is a pretty awesome idea. It's very similar to the Wii U's game tablet usage"
Chromecast,38dsj6,StealthRabbi,3,Wed Jun 3 15:54:34 2015 UTC,Its possible to run whatever you want on an android device and mirror it to chromecast. That includes emulators like nds4droid and drastic.  I played pokemon on mine a little but its really strange trying to control with a phones touch screen while also looking at a TV.
Chromecast,38dsj6,evilgold,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:12:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah I did that too. It's definitely possible, even before the API updates using Drastic.

Chromecast,38eks0,KEN_JAMES_bitch,2,Wed Jun 3 20:03:43 2015 UTC,You need a wireless router that runs in WISP mode not just repeating the hotel network - all that repeating the network does is extend the network. WISP mode means the router connects to the Hotel network as a client (like your laptop does) but then it creates a new network using the Hotel Network in the same way your home router will use the DSL connection. This then allows you to login to the hotel network webpage using any device connected to the router and ALL devices will have internet access because the only device the hotel network will see is the router - it won't see the laptop or Chromecast or phone or anything else - AND - no-one else will see your Chromecast and hence no-one else will annoyingly cast a YouTube video to your Chromecast while you are watching Netflix.

I've had CCs since they 1st released and used micro routers and spoofed MACs which work, but are labor intensive and hotels starting to remove cat5 from the rooms in favor of room wifi. I now only travel with my FireTV and side load any apps that are not in the Amazon store."

Chromecast,38gr4w,ur2fat4u,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:51:08 2015 UTC,Is there an advantage to using the wall over the TV USB port?
Chromecast,38gr4w,JimboLodisC,5,Thu Jun 4 10:56:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, you know for a fact that 100% of the time it will be able to provide the proper amount of power to your device.  On TVs, some USB ports only put out 500mA. Some USB ports aren't even USB ports and are rewired to become diagnostic ports. The power rail could have moved to a different pin on the plug. That's incredibly dangerous. Although they wouldn't put an official USB logo by it or label it with the letters ""USB"". It would say something like in regards to being a diagnostic port near it.  If you look at the official charger, it can provide up to 850mA. If your Chromecast is pulling in and decoding an HD stream, the CPU is going to be under load and need every last milliamp.  It's like putting a 300W PSU in a computer to power a GTX 980. You might be able to power up the machine and open up the web browser, but as soon as that card starts asking for more current, bad things will happen."
Chromecast,38gr4w,ur2fat4u,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:40:49 2015 UTC,Hmm very interesting. Thanks for the info. I need to check out how much power my USB TV port puts out
Chromecast,38gr4w,asjmcguire,2,Thu Jun 4 22:37:38 2015 UTC,The Chromecast can often appear to work perfectly fine being powered from the USB port of a TV - but under heavy load will heat up and as it heats up it will draw more current - at this point it will become unstable and start rebooting. It probably won't cause it any damage - but it may reduce the operating life of the device due to the additional stress it causes the components inside the device.

They were both about 2 gigs each, I wonder if the bit rate of your videos could be too high for your wifi?  The next thing I'd recommend looking into is if your NAS is running off a USB external. The hard drive could be timing out after a minute? This probably isn't the problem, but it was something that popped up a lot with USB loaders on the Wii.

Chromecast,38bwr9,ReedPaul1995,2,Wed Jun 3 05:41:22 2015 UTC,Sounds like a WiFi issue to me. Why not treat the symptom.   Can you see lots of WiFi networks at your house? If so maybe look at changing the WiFi channel to a less congested one.   Is your WiFi router far away from the chromecast? Are there lots of walls between the two? Maybe try a WiFi extender or a 2nd WiFi access point closer to the chromecast  Remember your laptop will have a bigger antenna then the chromecast and isn't located behind a large electronic device. Using the HDMI extender might help or even buying a longer HDMI extender to get it out from the back of the TV.   None of this is guaranteed to help but might sort the problem.
Chromecast,38bwr9,thelastwilson,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:29:02 2015 UTC,"I seem to remember there being something, but it took some digging.  This post suggests that Windows Media Player can act as a receiver for casting media. This doesn't help with your Card Cast scenario though.  Google says there's a receiver extension from AllCast for Chrome. Although, I haven't tried it out, but it looks like it might be for using with the AllCast mobile app only. Again, this doesn't open it up for Card Cast.  So if anyone uses the search bar and comes to this post, they've probably got a couple answers. However, the answer for you, OP, is to fix that wifi connection."

Chromecast,382krz,FrankReynolds,5,Mon Jun 1 23:28:10 2015 UTC,"Lies, I'm using one.  But I also work in IT and use a proper routing OS.  I set up DHCP reservations for a few devices (in my case, tablet, phone, chromecast) and route those all over my Private Internet Access VPN.

I have a DD-WRT router with a custom script routing half of my ip range through the VPN with DHCP reservations set up to my liking.

What this means in simple terms, is that somebody can completely compromise your system, beyond any repair. It allows for installing things like a rootkit, for example.”  Article here: http://www.dailydot.com/technology/hola-vpn-security/?tw=dd"
Chromecast,382krz,laccro,3,Mon Jun 1 12:46:52 2015 UTC,^^^^^ This is the most dangerous thing about it
Chromecast,382krz,Ponkers,4,Mon Jun 1 14:46:03 2015 UTC,"Practically speaking, a VPN routes your traffic through selective network nodes instead of letting the default switches dynamically choose the paths of your packets (traffic).  They could, in essence, be sniffing the packets that you send/receive and intercept information as it's passing through.  While you might not care if they sniff the packets of a movie you're watching, the user might be a little more concerned with credit card information, PII and other more sensitive information.  There are still problems with sloppy/lazy programmers and sending information in plain text over the wire.  Practically speaking, these consume bandwidth and create unwanted/unauthorized traffic.  This could cause problems if a user has metered rates or has a bandwidth usage threshold where the ISP bills the customer based on usage.  It would probably also degrade the throughput performance of the local network -- slowing things such as real time gaming and video/teleconference services.  Theoretically speaking, any botnet is generally bad, as they are mostly used by spammers and, more dangerously yet more commonly, DDOS attacks.  DDOS attacks could be used in cyberattacks on their very own country or associated businesses.  So while it may not directly interfere with said user's computing resource, it might create collateral damage with government or banking institutions -- both of which happen to house much of our personal information."

Chromecast,389drk,JimboLodisC,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:33:06 2015 UTC,"Then it's probably something on the router level.  Could be a number of things, perhaps some kind of AP isolation. For example, maybe for some reason you have a dual-band router and the Chromecast and Macbook Air are on the 2.4GHz SSID and your iPhone is on the 5GHz SSID, and the router is blocking communication there. Chromecast only works on the 2.4GHz wifi bands.  Considering your Mac is a laptop, I would assume it's not hard-wired into the router. If it were, then it could be AP isolation that prevents devices connected to wifi from talking to each other. This might explain why your hardwired laptop would still work in this situation."

Most action games would have to be modified to account for this lag and not punish the player for it (e.g. an enemy indication before firing its attack would be lengthened for the CC).  That makes action / timing games either have to be made specifically for the CC, or have a CC mode. The input lag can make normal games on the CC frustrating to play. I don't think an API can fix that. The game will have to be designed with it in mind. This may also limit what types of games will work with the CC."
Chromecast,37z8z3,chrono13,4,Sun May 31 20:41:24 2015 UTC,What app has better lag?
Chromecast,37z8z3,Bitruder,-1,Sun May 31 20:41:43 2015 UTC,I sed the netflix app on android and that was ok. At least it's not as laggy as screen mirroring.
Chromecast,37z8z3,r0ckarong,10,Sun May 31 20:59:28 2015 UTC,"That's because the chromecast can natively decode video iirc. Obviously it's better to send the stream directly to the chromecast than play it on your phone, encode it, send it, then decode it again. Why anyone would do that is beyond me."
Chromecast,37z8z3,Viklove,3,Sun May 31 21:23:46 2015 UTC,"Netflix and many other video apps like HBO Go, Showtime, and YouTube do ""direct casting"", whereby they pitch the stream to the Chromecast directly. So yes, the Chromecast decodes the stream directly in those cases.   Not all apps that cast do this (Pandora, for instance, I think goes to the device first), and for other things like Amazon Prime video where they refuse to support streaming at all require you to cast your Chrome tab, which also then does the ""device first"" route.  Most Android games also don't support ""direct streaming"", since there is synchronization between the user inputs and the outputs. Things like Netflix don't care if there is 0.5 seconds of lag when you hit pause, and turn-based games don't care either (though humans do find such things annoying; the threshold for that is about 0.17 seconds).  But yeah, no app will have intrinsically ""better"" or reduced lag on user inputs. That's an aspect of your network configuration.  It will generally be the same regardless. It's more of whether your casting device is expending tons of resources to make the stream happen."
Chromecast,37z8z3,AchillesFoundation,3,Sun May 31 23:27:15 2015 UTC,"Most games and emulators don't support ccast streaming. Even if they did, I doubt it would be much different that just casting the screen."
Chromecast,37z8z3,1destroyer2x,3,Sun May 31 20:39:43 2015 UTC,"Depends on the app. Funnily enough, Half Life via xash3d was playable for me casting my phone screen, but Commander Keen via CGenius had higher latency I couldn't be bothered with."

Chromecast,37z8z3,tborwi,4,Sun May 31 21:15:23 2015 UTC,Those games are an app that is running on the chromecast and your phone has the companion app. This is talking about your phone running an app that is casting a second screen to the chrome cast.

Chromecast,37z8z3,13zath13,5,Sun May 31 22:27:19 2015 UTC,This is really far outside of me knowing what I'm talking about but I think it has to do with your phone being more powerful.  The Chromecast isn't very powerful and most of the apps it runs natively are either streaming or simple. (I know streaming is actually quite difficult but I think for the chrome cast its hardware is specialised for it)  Edit: I'd love to have someone who actually knows something answer. Thanks :)
Chromecast,37z8z3,StrikingCrayon,3,Sun May 31 22:37:56 2015 UTC,"You're basically correct, the mobile device has a much better CPU and graphics processor.

I just had a thought that if you plugged it into some available USB port on the TV that it's sending a signal to that port that turns the TV off.  Among other reasons, this is why Google (and I) don't recommend using the USB port on the television for power. Go to the wall; it's reliable and will always have enough current to meet demands.  Also, USB ports sometimes cap out at 500mA, and the official charger for the Chromecast is rated to provide 850mA when needed."

There are capacitors (kinda like batteries) on said board that go bad on alot of flat screens. The tv is shutting off to protect itself from damage. You say its happening on multiple tvs I would get a new Ccast and try it. If it still happens on both your Tvs you probably need new capacitors  on bith of them which is not uncommon.

Chromecast,37xnrb,semperverus,9,Sun May 31 10:51:56 2015 UTC,This topic? I agree. The app absolutely does not need Chromecast support.
Chromecast,37xnrb,zoinks_the_miner,-5,Sun May 31 13:33:41 2015 UTC,Way to bait and switch...
Chromecast,37xnrb,semperverus,5,Sun May 31 13:40:38 2015 UTC,what would you even chromecast besides the video that uses youtube anyway? the keynotes were on youtube's front page FFS. you can even screencast the rest of the app although I have no idea why you would do that.
Chromecast,37zxrs,kerowack,2,Sun May 31 20:41:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not quite sure I understand the question, you say that you have bought your parents a Chromecast - why would they need to connect the laptop to the TV? Why wouldn't they just use the Chromecast?  If they use a computer to access to server to grab the files they want, they would probably want to use Localcast for Chrome to send the file to the Chromecast - Localcast will convert the file on the fly for sending to the Chromecast."
Chromecast,37zxrs,asjmcguire,1 point,Sun May 31 22:23:31 2015 UTC,"I bought my parents a Chromecast for Netflix and Youtube streaming - so far I have not found a useful way for them to use it to stream my downloaded files via Chromecast to their TV, therefore the best option remains HDMI connecting the laptop to the TV for those.  No one is using a phone to interact with the Chromecast at any point. Only laptops."
Chromecast,37zxrs,asjmcguire,2,Sun May 31 23:57:11 2015 UTC,"Right so they can connect to your personal server with their laptops, grab the files they want, and then cast them to the Chromecast via Localcast installed in Chrome. This will drop the requirement to plug into the TV with a HDMI cable. (Actually I can no longer remember if VideoStream or Localcast is the best app for this now)"
Chromecast,37zxrs,asjmcguire,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:40:16 2015 UTC,OK so it still requires them to download the files from the server to their laptop vs. just streaming them directly from the server?  Also is there a Localcast for Chrome the web browser vs. for Android and if so can you link me to it?
Chromecast,37zxrs,pawdog,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:42:24 2015 UTC,"OK I snagged Localcast and it looks interesting - but it wants a ""link to stream"" that is then Castable to the television.

Chromecast,37zxrs,pawdog,2,Mon Jun 1 12:31:42 2015 UTC,You have the right idea.  Only problem I see with a laptop is storage space and/or losing portability because of attached drives. If you have a large collection of files Plex is the way they go.  I you only have a handful Videostream is a nice solution.  Both will send video to  Chromecast.   Plex is server software that can be set up to manage and send audio and video to a large variety of devices over the network.
Chromecast,37zxrs,JimboLodisC,1 point,Sun May 31 22:27:04 2015 UTC,Gotcha - but is there any way for me to access the Plex server from a distance (off the in-home network) to share my downloaded files with my parents or would they need to grab them from my seedbox and then place them on the Plex server themselves?
Chromecast,37zxrs,JimboLodisC,2,Sun May 31 23:55:10 2015 UTC,Lots of Plex users do that very thing.
Chromecast,37zxrs,JimboLodisC,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:28:54 2015 UTC,Stream directly from their seedbox or download the files to the Plex folder (is that part of the service or a dedicated network-linked folder on an existing computer?)?
Chromecast,37zxrs,Mysqu,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:10:11 2015 UTC,When you give them access to your library they stream directly from. Your computer.

Chromecast,37tilz,autowikibot,2,Sat May 30 14:57:32 2015 UTC,"Netherlands Antilles:       The Netherlands Antilles (Dutch: Nederlandse Antillen [ˈneːdərˌlɑntsə ɑnˈtɪlə(n)] ; Papiamentu: Antia Hulandes ) were an autonomous country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands located in the Caribbean. It was also informally known as the Dutch Antilles.  The country was dissolved in 2010. The phrase is not synonymous with Dutch Caribbean, in the way that the Dutch Caribbean includes all of those Caribbean islands regardless of their legal status,   and that the phrase ""Dutch Caribbean"" is currently still in use while ""Netherlands Antilles"" is not. Historically the Netherlands Antilles included the colony of Curaçao and its dependencies. The former Dutch colony of Surinam, although it was relatively close by, was not considered to be part of Netherlands Antilles as it was on the continent of South America. All of the constituent islands of Netherlands Antilles remain part of the Kingdom although the legal status of each differs.

Chromecast,37w1di,alienartifact,3,Sat May 30 23:53:06 2015 UTC,"sorry, i misread your title."
Chromecast,37w1di,DPAmes1,3,Sat May 30 23:59:59 2015 UTC,"LocalCast does this. It provides the ability to adjust the audio-video sync until you have it right, which can take a bit of time. It handles local media and internet streams passed from other apps, but it can't do Netflix because you have to cast Netflix from the Netflix app."
Chromecast,37w1di,asjmcguire,2,Sun May 31 02:35:36 2015 UTC,"No, because there are only 2 ways this could be done - and both are bad ideas. 1) The Chromecast AND the Sending device have to both consume the same media and stay in sync - which while not difficult - taking Netflix for example - would mean 2 Netflix streams instead of just one. The alternative would be if the Chromecast could send the realtime audio stream back to the sending device, which introduces latency and the potential for audio drop out since it would be relying on WiFi - and it would likely need apps to implement some new API to support it."
Chromecast,37w1di,vita10gy,1 point,Sun May 31 00:49:18 2015 UTC,But if the Chromecast was itself doing that they could just correct for any latency by just delaying the video a bit.
Chromecast,37w1di,asjmcguire,1 point,Sun May 31 14:02:25 2015 UTC,"So the communication between the Chromecast and the sending device would look like this:  Chromecast -> Sending Device - here is the audio for timecode 00:00:00:01 please confirm receipt.  Sending Device -> Chromecast - OK, I've received and played that audio - please play the video frame for 00:00:00:01 and then send the next bit of audio.  Chromecast -> Sending Device - OK, here is the audio for timecode 00:00:00:02 please confirm receipt.  etc  Which would be fine - but if the wireless network has latency issues or if the receiving device is a bit laggy - then when the sending device doesn't confirm receipt to the Chromecast - the video pauses. It's not a terribly user friendly experience - especially if it's just brief pause for let's say 1/10 second which is perfectly likely - it's enough of a pause in both audio and video to be noticeable - without necessarily realising that the reason it looks and sounds a bit odd is because of frequent micro pauses.  There may be better ways of doing it - but none of them beat bluetooth which is how Roku does it."
Chromecast,37w1di,vita10gy,1 point,Sun May 31 15:12:27 2015 UTC,"Well, it wouldn't have to be a constant syncing, just that if they know it's going to take 100MS get there, they can delay by that. They maybe they adjust from there checking in once in a while. I don't know that they'd have to handshake on every byte of audio.  It's possible they could do some of the keyframing via ultrasonic audio too."
Chromecast,37w1di,asjmcguire,1 point,Sun May 31 15:25:17 2015 UTC,"I understand what you are trying to say - but the major problem they have is this part: "" if they know it's going to take 100MS get there"" there is no way to know that in advance, they could guess - but when dealing with a wireless network - anything could cause the stream to be delayed or even drop completely."
Chromecast,37w1di,vita10gy,1 point,Sun May 31 17:39:27 2015 UTC,"I meant at least 100, or whatever. There might be a minimum they can know they have to account for."
