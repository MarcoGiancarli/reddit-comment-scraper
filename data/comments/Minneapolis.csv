That'll do ya in October.  I really like Surly. They make some delicious, potent, and unique brews. I don't drink too much and reminded myself exactly why over the weekend there.  For fine dining, Bar La Grassa is mindblowingly good.  Want a good burger? Buster's on 28th. Get the gyro burger or the regular one. Doesn't matter. They've got the best sweet potato fries on Earth.  Indian food is ""eh"" here but Ghorka Palace will get you hipster'd up Nepali, delicious either way. I personally prefer Jalsa - also Nepali but with Bengal-style curries. The chicken is heavenly.  Filfillah is some of the best Arab cuisine on Earth. Babani's kicks ass for Kurdish - similar to Persian/Iraqi - probably split down the middle. Delicious.  Bravo! bakery in St. Paul is an awesome Asian-style bakery with some of the better cakes I've had on this planet.  Steer clear of Uptown. Chino Latino is good if you want ""big portions"" that can be finished by a toddler and to not be able to hear yourself think. The Twin Cities have a fad of ""loud restaurants"". It's fucking dumb and I hate it. Maybe you won't. If you won't, go to Uptown. It's a bunch of people being loud and trying to be seen.  Want other stuff to do? The Mall of America is overcrowded and annoying, dumb unless you want to buy Minnesota kitsch. Hang out at some lakes, walk around the loop of the Hennepin Ave to Stone Arch bridge with St. Anthony Main as the connector. We've got a good music scene so maybe catch a show or something.

Minneapolis,3dydsk,BallsDeepinLogic,6,Mon Jul 20 15:31:28 2015 UTC,"I agree that the content of the article is a bit pretentious, and certainly not representative of North Loop, or Minneapolis for that matter, on the whole. However, I'm glad that the restaurants were included because creating exceptional food is an art form and they deserve recognition for doing an excellent job, regardless of price. Also I think its positive that Minneapolis is getting attention on a national platform. We have an incredible city and I'm glad more people have the opportunity to see that!"

Minneapolis is my adoptive home city and I've really fallen in love with it since coming here, so it hurts when I see an article like this that I feel represents such a narrow and generic sliver of our beloved city. I mean really, couldn't you find any of these places in Chicago, LA, San Francisco, and NYC? The same food, clothes, and patrons? I mean really, it's like the NYTs just went on yelp and looked for the most expensive and highest rated options of the neighborhood.

How horrible. /s   Clearly you didn't read my other comment, which is posted below. I'm not one of these Hillary Clinton's (totally ignore the fact that I am myself wealthy, let's eat the other rich), my concern is the financial health of the city and what would happen if these types who know very little about economics and yet control the economic destiny of wherever they live, start to get ideas about what's good for the area they live in. Mob rule versus democracy and actual liberalism versus live and let live as long as it's not in my front yard-progressivism.    I think living in SF has made me quite cynical towards the people who would likely patronize these businesses. I'm actually not quite worried about the TC ""losing it's soul"", what I don't want is a bunch of rich hipster kids to move here and drive up the price of everything by trying to preserve ""the soul"" of the city. San Francisco living costs have skyrocketed because of this, through rent control and local regulation, turning it into a city that no one but economic superstars can afford. It's the same people who say we need to preserve the city's architecture, even though it just drives up rent by not allowing new development, and everyone needs to eat local and organic, regardless of how many people starve not being able to afford organic food.

Further, I think saying, in essence, that the Twin Cities will lose its soul, becoming ""another bastion of nouveau riche...millennials"" is really cynical. If you need evidence consider the breadth of local culture from the arts scene (music, theater, numerous artist loft communities) to people like yourself who are legitimately concerned with the welfare of the cities and preserving their identity."

Tree House has Indy stuff and an eclectic selection of harder to find bands (IMO). Not a huge hymies fan personally. Road runner is pretty good and the fetus is very excellent."
Minneapolis,3dz0ui,dirttt,4,Mon Jul 20 20:17:33 2015 UTC,"There's nothing by the MoA. I'd recommend Roadrunner, Electric Fetus, and Hymie's. Treehouse is cool too, but I haven't had great experiences with the owner. The rest of the staff is cool.  Oh and there's a cool record store inside of FindFurnish, which is a high-end vintage furniture store."
Minneapolis,3dz0ui,randyscroutons,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:21:36 2015 UTC,How are the prices at Roadrunner and Electric Fetus? Those seem to be the two most popular ones.
Minneapolis,3dz0ui,randyscroutons,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:50:35 2015 UTC,Depends what you're looking for. Roadrunner has better used. The Fetus has a better new selection. I think Roadrunner is super reasonably priced.

Minneapolis,3dz0ui,DeadDoug,4,Tue Jul 21 16:23:05 2015 UTC,Electric Fetus and Treehouse.  Treehouse is my personal fave. Small and cozy. Most of the time I go in there they're playing awesome stuff over the speakers that I've never heard before.  Found some great older gems that way.

We're gonna check our heating, air conditioning, and lighting.   Yep, every big building goes through this every few years. Every building gets a letter from XCEL on energy usage and what credits are available to reduce costs every year. Buildings all over the metro upgrade their systems all the time and with major advancments in chiller technology, boiler efficiency, lighting, motors, ect, it can have a payback of just a few years! And unless the building is going to be flipped in a year or so, owners usually put the money into future savings.   I guess this is getting news because its the biggest building.

Minneapolis,3duphx,Mpls_Is_Rivendell,12,Mon Jul 20 14:55:48 2015 UTC,Asked Browne: “How many officers need to be disciplined for them to be happy?” All the ones who do malicious shit?
Minneapolis,3duphx,inyourface_milwaukee,2,Sun Jul 19 23:16:41 2015 UTC,Which is how many? You can't just say # of disciplines / # of complaints should be > x. Which is what it appears this group did.
Minneapolis,3duphx,WhiteSpots,7,Mon Jul 20 00:38:46 2015 UTC,"Here's an idea. If the city gets sued over police action and the court finds in favor of the plaintiff, then every officer involved and their immediate supervising officers are disciplined.  I feel too often disciplinary action never takes place because ""they were just following training"" is used as an excuse. Even when the court finds in favor of the plaintiff.   There's a clear lack of accountability."
Minneapolis,3duphx,Bike-o-king,3,Mon Jul 20 00:57:22 2015 UTC,"Here's an idea. If the city gets sued over police action and the court finds in favor of the plaintiff, then every officer involved and their immediate supervising officers are disciplined.   This would never work. For one, the city nearly always settles before it gets out of court. How would that be handled? They settle any time they think it would cost more to hire lawyers than to fight, which is most of the time, regardless of officer guilt.   I feel too often disciplinary action never takes place because ""they were just following training"" is used as an excuse. Even when the court finds in favor of the plaintiff.   Usually they are following both training and the law, which results in  a ""not guilty"" verdict in the trial, even if the police lose in the subsequent lawsuit.  That said, we definitely should change the training and the law. If you want to be sick, watch this video of a cop slamming a cuffed suspect to the ground because she tried to kick him. The title of the thread at ""officer.com"" is ""absolutely deserved it,"" and is filled with comments justifying the use of force.  I believe them. I don't doubt what the officer did was legal, given that every officer seems to think it was OK. On the other hand, it is clearly insane that our laws work like that, so we should be looking at changing them."
Minneapolis,3duphx,polit1337,7,Mon Jul 20 12:29:01 2015 UTC,"Well when ""discipline"" is a couple weeks off paid, early retirement with full pensions, or transfers to other departments the vast majority of the time, I don't think there are very many real disciplinary actions. I think the police should carry professional insurance like other professionals and if they are found to fuck up taxpayers dont have to bail them out in the tune of millions a year across the country."
Minneapolis,3duphx,inyourface_milwaukee,3,Mon Jul 20 00:53:44 2015 UTC,"Well when there are 919 allegations and the Board only thinks 36 have merit and then only 1 of those officers is actually disciplined, then you have a problem."
Minneapolis,3duphx,mythosopher,-1,Mon Jul 20 01:16:18 2015 UTC,"Which is back to the question, what is x? 50%?  Not saying the review board is great. Just saying this methodology is flawed. You can't just look at raw numbers and determine how many should be disciplined."
Minneapolis,3duphx,WhiteSpots,4,Mon Jul 20 01:22:57 2015 UTC,"No, but you can reasonably believe that the Board needs reformed so that we can determine that number properly rather than just denying every complaint that comes across that guy's desk."

Or they'll carry conversation with you in an elevator or in a checkout line.   But..   making new friends, inviting new people out, getting to know new people, just forget about it.   I went to high school here for 2 years,... I moved away and came back a few years ago. I do still hang out with old high school friends sometimes, but they all still hang out with the same exact people as we did in high school. If anybody ""new"" comes to the group it is people that we still went to high school with, but didn't exactly hang out with in high school. I think this is a little sad, because I've grown so much as a person since high school and have made new friends that I love and have helped me grow even more, but yet here they are stuck in this weird time bubble that just won't pop. I don't understand it, I tell them I do not understand it, but I think that really is just Minnesota for you, the land of unfriendly beautiful giants.

Once people have a number of good friends, it becomes less of a priority to make more, and cultivating all those relationships gets more difficult.

Minneapolis,3dv15y,veganon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:03:09 2015 UTC,"There have been many debates in this forum over 'Minnesota Nice'. My personal feeling (as a lifelong Minnesotan) is that I dislike making any generalization about a huge cross-section of people. What I can tell you with complete certainty is that if you think all Minnesotans are a bunch of Scandinavian Lutherans straight off A Prairie Home Companion, then you haven't dug deep enough into local culture.  That being said, here are my tips for meeting people. I learned this 25 years ago when I moved from Northern Minnesota to the Twin Cities, and I swear by them:   Church. I don't go to church, but everyone I know that does tell me that it is a great way to find an accepting group of like minded people. If you are atheist like me, find a local humanist meetup. Get a job as a bartender or barista. It doesn't have to be full time. Even if you are a successful professional by day, find a place that will let you work one night a week serving drinks. Make sure it's the kind of place where you would want to hang out as a customer. You are guaranteed to meet people.  Volunteer. Unless you are a complete sociopath, chances are you have something that you care about. Google local charities and groups that support your interests or favorite cause. Show up at one of their events and do some work. There are literally specialized meetups and organizations for anything you can think of.    Remember that no matter where you live, you are never going to meet people if you don't put yourself out there."

I would rather have the public be able to visit and see this humble sight. To take away not the fact that they believe it represents slavery and oppression but more so the struggle and revolution our country had to suffer, deal with and come to amends in the end. That people on both sides of the conflict gave their lives for what they believed was right. I want people to be humbled by the fact that 750,000 people died in that conflict. On American soil, brother versus brother, father versus son.   They were someones mother, father, uncle, brother, son, grandson and or relative. As a prior service member I find it shameful that we have to go down this road. How many im sorry's or repatriations or time will it take to heal? I for one do not agree with what the south stood for in regards to slavery, but I am not gonna go ahead and start passively aggressively desecrating southern confederate grave sites because they were the loosing side and hence deserve to fall into disrepair."
