SquaredCircle,3dynig,JBiloxi,5,Mon Jul 20 18:40:59 2015 UTC,Not to derail the conversation but I even hate the stage design I think video wall should like something U2 used 10 years ago their Vertigo tour.  It was essentially giant beaded Curtain that rolled down like Christmas lights for video projection  http://imgur.com/a/b3G3H  It also will benefit their bad entrance videos.
SquaredCircle,3dynig,KingKane,8,Mon Jul 20 19:04:26 2015 UTC,That'd be cool for a PPV. i would hate that to be the everyday set up. Also remember the tron serves as a TV for fans in the crowd to watch as well so it has to be a clear display.
SquaredCircle,3dynig,bigsheldy,3,Mon Jul 20 20:07:56 2015 UTC,I think they must be completely different parts of the production team that handle certain things. Maybe they put the good/experienced people on the video packages/montages and let the interns handle the entrance videos?

SquaredCircle,3dynig,Ounceofwhiskey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:18:42 2015 UTC,I think it was the budget cuts. Why employ designers for something specialized when your video editors can do it? If they're on salary then it's cheaper to give them more work than to bring in more people.

Paige's debut Titantron, for example, was awesome, or Miz's WrestleMania main event one with the red background and fan silhouettes. They also tend to use this sort of simple video wall for WrestleManias, and that's why WrestleMania usually looks a notch above.

Leaked scripts show even Jericho is scripted word for word.

He's told what phrases to use (Ex: Title instead of Belt), and he's told if he needs to plug something, put someone over, etc... How he does that with his given rules is completely up to him.

SquaredCircle,3dxoti,WeaponGrade,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:58:17 2015 UTC,"JBL made a comment about guys with a winning record against John Cena in the past 10 years. He said it with a very condescending voice trying to put Kevin Owens over but it just sounded wrong. It was as if no one has a positive win record on John.   So I'm asking here; How many people have a winning record against Cena since July, 2005?"
SquaredCircle,3dxoti,GoWhalers96,2,Mon Jul 20 18:25:50 2015 UTC,"I wanna say CM Punk had a winning record in singles matches (not including house shows), but I'm not 100% sure.

SquaredCircle,3dxoti,Capybara_Monsoon,15,Mon Jul 20 15:21:52 2015 UTC,"That was true initially, but about halfway through the attitude era he was already so fat they sent him down to developmental and took him out of the No Mercy N64 game as punishment. It's why Steven Richards is so prominent in the story mode - they replaced Big Show with him."
