chemicalreactiongifs,3dzzlp,MerlinTheWhite,138,Mon Jul 20 22:13:54 2015 UTC,"Ive seen lots of videos showing colored fire, but I have never seen how to make it, or where to get the chemicals. Its actually possible to color fire every color of the rainbow with one trip to Walmart.   So what I did was put a solution of each in the spray bottles and filmed it in slow motion. It ended up pretty cool, red and purple are my favorite. Blue did not show up very well, and it turned orange from incomplete combustion.   Lithium from batteries burns red, its kind of tricky to get the lithium foil out.  Calcium chloride in Damp-Rid burns orange  Sodium in table salt burns yellow  Boron (boric acid) in roach killer burns green  Methanol burns blue all by itself  Potassium in No-salt (salt substitute) burns purple   If you want to learn how to mix the ingredients to  make perfect colored fire, you can watch the video here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvLfDpTONNk If you just want to see the cool parts, skip to 2:00 :)"
chemicalreactiongifs,3dzzlp,Ven0mFr0g,23,Mon Jul 20 22:17:45 2015 UTC,another neat one would be Copper Sulfate which burns green IIRC.

I think you can see that a little in the gif, where the boron and potassium still have a bit of yellow in the flame.  If I had to speculate as of why, I'd hazard that sodium has really strong emission spectral lines in the visual spectrum compared to the other elements."

chemicalreactiongifs,3cxi9d,JorusC,76,Sat Jul 11 18:26:33 2015 UTC,"Yup, I'm going to be doing stuff like this in grad school in September, not animation, but working with atomic force microscopes."
chemicalreactiongifs,3cxi9d,hchromez,80,Sat Jul 11 18:34:19 2015 UTC,Working with AFM and doing this is entirely different. They use a supersharp AFM tip to pick up a single CO molecule on a supercooled surface and use that as a probe to both move around the atoms and them image them.  This shit is insane.
chemicalreactiongifs,3cxi9d,schnichaels,13,Sat Jul 11 20:20:56 2015 UTC,"What do you think an AFM is, and how do you think they get the images?  Edit: I apologize that this may have sounded aggressive, I was just curious about that he knew about the subject, aggression was not my intent.   Edit 2: Changed AMF to AFM because apparently I don't pay enough attention when I type."
chemicalreactiongifs,3cxi9d,hchromez,11,Sat Jul 11 20:33:25 2015 UTC,"First off, cool it a bit on the aggression. Second, I do AFM now and then to characterize carbon nanomaterials, catalyst particles, quantum dots, etc. I really don't feel like going into the explanation of this technique again, it's in my post history somewhere.  By the way, they're using STM (Scanning tunneling microsopy), a subset of AFM which utilizes electron tunneling between a conductive tip and conductive surface to allow for higher resolution than typical scanning probe microscopy techniques. IBM is using an extraordinarily advanced experimental setup, and if you're working with that then I'm just plain jealous. I'd love to play around with that instrument at some point but I know I'll never get near it.  Edit: Here's my explanation from 2 months ago:   That's scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), which is a form of scanning probe microscopy (SPM). SPM uses a cantilever with a very tiny tip sticking down to ""feel"" the surface of a sample. A laser is focused on the back of the tip and onto a photodiode array. Deflections of the tip are recorded by marking the changes in position of the laser on the array. STM uses a current between the tip and an underlying conductive surface such that electrons ""tunnel"" (a quantum phenomena) from the tip to the surface. Changes in current along the surface are used to track surface topology. IBM uses a tiny silicon tip to pick up a single carbon monoxide molecule on an extremely cold surface for their imaging."

chemicalreactiongifs,3cxi9d,Spamallthethings,3,Sun Jul 12 05:33:24 2015 UTC,"First off, I added to my previous comment, and I'm sorry that it sounded aggressive, not my intention. Secondly our lab has 3 STMs right now and will be getting an AFM in the fall shortly after I start. But I believe my point still stands that I will be working with similar things, though not as advanced.  Edit: Changed AMF to AFM because apparently I don't pay enough attention when I type."
chemicalreactiongifs,3cxi9d,hchromez,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:54:38 2015 UTC,"I understand. Text doesn't translate intention too well. By the way, why do you keep saying AMF?

chemicalreactiongifs,3cxi9d,schnichaels,6,Sat Jul 11 22:02:13 2015 UTC,"because apparently I can't type, I should be saying AFM, sorry. I will be working at a university lab, we have 1 fully functional low pressure STM, and one that is almost ready to use, then an atmospheric STM."

It also has the capability to do non-contact AFM to achieve images like this, but we haven't vented it to add the necessary parts yet.  This video almost certainly took weeks to make!"

chemicalreactiongifs,3cxi9d,mirac_eren,139,Sat Jul 11 18:08:13 2015 UTC,Atoms out of focus essentially. These Atoms are the ones on top.
chemicalreactiongifs,3cxi9d,mirchman,175,Sat Jul 11 18:21:58 2015 UTC,Now that's a shallow depth-of-field.
chemicalreactiongifs,3cxi9d,rosinall,45,Sat Jul 11 19:52:39 2015 UTC,"a 1-atom thick depth of field, I can only imagine how expensive that lens would be... god damn Gear Acquisition Syndrome has gotten out of hand"
chemicalreactiongifs,3cxi9d,TThor,33,Sat Jul 11 22:11:47 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong, as I'm not familiar with these microscope, but the SEMs I work with do not have lenses because the resolution is smaller than the wavelengths of visible light. Instead they use an electron detector, magnets, and apertures to produce a representative image. Since these microscope can detect individual atoms, where a SEM cannot, I'd assume they don't use lenses either."
chemicalreactiongifs,3cxi9d,gurg2k1,5,Sat Jul 11 22:41:39 2015 UTC,actually the apertures and magnets form electrostatic and magnetic lenses. The image is created by scanning the electron beam using those lenses across the sample like a crt does across the tv screen. The detectors pick up the scattered signal to form contrast between pixels and hence an image.
chemicalreactiongifs,3cxi9d,thatwentwell,2,Sat Jul 11 23:57:39 2015 UTC,"This is true, the magnets form lenses for the electrons (this is actually critical, and basically solves what's known as the ""phase problem"" in x-ray crystallography, since the x-rays used in high resolution experimentation are not able to be focused back by a lens). And of course, when talking about scattering of electrons, this is true, and still pertains in some sense to transmission electron microscopy, but thought I might mention TEM as another electron microscopy technique that is currently in deployment for some purposes. Cheers!"
chemicalreactiongifs,3cxi9d,Keyboard_Frenzy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:51:28 2015 UTC,TEM as in Transmission Electron Microscopy? That is already in use.
chemicalreactiongifs,3cxi9d,shieldvexor,12,Sun Jul 12 08:04:07 2015 UTC,"Actually these images are produced by atomic force scanning tunneling microscopy (http://ibmresearchnews.blogspot.com/2013/05/how-to-move-atom.html). Meaning no lens, not in the optical sense. A sharp needle scans an entire layer and when it comes across an atom it's like dragging your finger over a bump -- the image you see is just a digital mapping of where the needle felt the bumps.   What I'm getting at is technically there is no ""depth-of-field"" at all. I fibbed a bit earlier when I said that the atoms were essentially out of focus, they actually aren't being displayed at all since the needle isn't touching them. There's 0 signal being produced from those atoms so you couldn't ""zoom in"" more to see them."
chemicalreactiongifs,3cxi9d,mirchman,3,Sat Jul 11 23:07:14 2015 UTC,Basically it would be equivalent of a blind person reading braille.
chemicalreactiongifs,3cxi9d,norml329,3,Sun Jul 12 01:05:46 2015 UTC,"I think you are right. Even so, we do use ""lenses"" in a sense when using forms of electron microscopy, but instead of using light bending material (i.e. a physical lens), we use electron bending fields to produce the same effect. That's not being utilized here, but may be of some interest to people."
chemicalreactiongifs,3cxi9d,Keyboard_Frenzy,2,Sun Jul 12 01:53:43 2015 UTC,"I was mostly poking fun at it, I know those aren't taken with conventional visible light cameras"
chemicalreactiongifs,3cxi9d,TThor,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:06:58 2015 UTC,It is not true that there is 0 signal from the underlying substrate. Different tunnelling conditions are used to image the individual atoms from that. There is a tunnelling signal from that substrate - you can clearly see the ripples in its 2D electron gas caused by the adsorbates.
chemicalreactiongifs,3cxi9d,Jimmeh_Jazz,2,Sun Jul 12 14:07:32 2015 UTC,"I think it's an stm, where the tip is also a single atom wide and the image contrast is created by dragging the tip across the sample and recording the force at each pixel. They can also drag the atoms across the surface by putting the tip closer to the surface andusing that force between the atoms."
chemicalreactiongifs,3cxi9d,thatwentwell,4,Sun Jul 12 00:00:22 2015 UTC,"STM does not record a force like that (you're thinking of AFM, atomic force microscopy). It records a quantum tunnelling current between the tip and the sample when they are held at a very close distance (in the order of a nm). The current measured is a function of both the distance between them (in an exponentially decaying way) and also the electronic density of states of both the tip and the sample. So, for example, you could be imaging two molecules which both protruded the same amount from a flat surface, but they would give two different 'apparent height' maps because of their electronic structure."
chemicalreactiongifs,3cxi9d,Jimmeh_Jazz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:14:47 2015 UTC,"Sure, I understand that tunneling is the mechanism used for stm vs position measured by a laser for afm. The only reason I said force is cause to drag the atoms across the surface the tip comes in close and uses that attractive force to move them"
chemicalreactiongifs,3cxi9d,thatwentwell,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:36:10 2015 UTC,"You did mention measuring 'the force at each pixel', which is AFM territory.  Also, the method they use to pick up molecules or atoms isn't exactly how you're describing it. It's not just a case of the tip moving in close to pick things up, there's usually a voltage pulse and an electrostatic potential field created that guides molecules etc towards (or away from) the tip."

chemicalreactiongifs,3cxi9d,RodeoRuck,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:07:36 2015 UTC,"Friedel oscillations:       Friedel Oscillations  arise from localized perturbations in a metallic or semiconductor system caused by a defect in the Fermi gas or Fermi Liquid.  Friedel Oscillations are a quantum mechanical analog to electric charge screening of charged species in a pool of ions. Whereas electrical charge screening utilizes a point entity treatment to describe the make-up of the ion pool, Friedel Oscillations describing fermions in a Fermi fluid or Fermi gas require a quasi-particle or a scattering treatment. Such oscillations depict a characteristic exponential decay in the fermionic density near the perturbation followed by an ongoing sinusoidal decay resembling sin(x)/x.

chemicalreactiongifs,3bp9so,thebestisyetocome,17,Wed Jul 1 05:51:59 2015 UTC,"Light is conducted by particles called photons. Photons can have different amounts of energy. Since their mass is zero and their speed is constant this energy can just be expressed in one physical quantitiy: it's wavelength which we know as it's colour. Blue light has a very short wavelength and red light a very long one. Shorter wavelengths have more energy, longer ones less.  In atoms electrons can be on different but discrete energy levels.This means that you can be at 1 eV or 2 eV (eV is a measure for energy) but not in between. In this case there wouldn't be any electrons at 1.4 or even 1.02 eV. Sometimes you have many of these energy levels so close together that they seem to be one broad ""band"". Two of these bands are important for LEDs: the valence and the conduction band. In conductors these bands are identical or overlap but in semiconducters there is a gap called ""band gap"" (how discriptive right?) inbetween. When an electron jumps down from the higher energy conduction band to the lower energy valence band this energy difference is emitted as light. The bigger the gap the more energy the light has. So the size of the gap dictates the colour of the light emitted. The band gap size depends on material and temperature.  An LED is made of two bits of semiconducter. One is ""doped"" negativly, the other positivly. You don't have to understand doping though. Just keep in mind that there is a border between two different materials.  So now let's rap this all up: At the barrier of the two kinds of semiconductor electrons jump from the conductor band down to the valence band. The energy difference is emitted as light. The size of the gap between the two bands dictates the colour. Now when we cool the LED the size of the gap increases (it's harder to jump into the conductor band from the valence band and more energy is released on the jump down). The light is shifted towards blue."
chemicalreactiongifs,3bp9so,Steve_the_Stevedore,10,Wed Jul 1 13:56:50 2015 UTC,"The individual packets which make up light (photons) interact with individual bits in a substance.  When the substance is hot, those bits are farther apart because they get irritated with each other and want space to cool off.  But when they are cold, the bits move closer together.  So when the photons of the light hit the bits of substance, the bits of substance temporarily ""absorb"" the light before radiating it back out.  Not all the light gets radiated back out because the bits are greedy little shits fellows, so the radiated light is different (wavelength changes).  In the case of a cold substance, there are more bits close together for the light to interact with.  So this effect happens over and over as the light radiates from one bit to another, amplifying the effect and strengthening the visible results."

chemicalreactiongifs,3bp9so,BaneFlare,3,Wed Jul 1 18:03:23 2015 UTC,"Light is produced when an electron falls from an excited state to a rest state. (From the conduction band to the valence band, as stated elsewhere.) The difference in energy between the two states is the energy of the emitted light (photon).   When you cool a semiconductor, the energy levels get further away from each other and the energy of the photon increases. (Yes, this is from thermal expansion, where you cool a material and the atoms get closer together.)   Therefore, as you cool the LED, the energy levels get further apart and the emitted light has greater energy. The higher energy photons are perceived as a shift towards a greenish bluish color (blueshift).   For a real life association, think about old school dark rooms for developing film. Those always have red lights because they have the lowest energy and are least likely to affect the film development process. (Redshift is the opposite of blueshift).

chemicalreactiongifs,3bp9so,DeathByTrayItShallBe,9,Wed Jul 1 04:07:27 2015 UTC,"That's three separate LEDs housed in one package. Like I said, changing the voltage changes the intensity; so as you adjust the voltage on each of the three separate LEDs, you perceive a change in color."

The details are not ELI5 or anything, but I believe your original statement was heavily downvoted because you didn't get what they were saying, and provided an incorrect reply in your attempt to clarify it.  Regarding ""voltage"", the color is dependent upon the energy gap of the bandgap, which is measured often in electron-volts. Electron-volts (eV) is not a voltage, but rather a charge multiplied by voltage, therefore an energy."
chemicalreactiongifs,3bp9so,chemistry_teacher,2,Wed Jul 1 05:44:21 2015 UTC,"I'm sticking by the answer being no and I'm trying to think of really obvious ways to explain why, or at least why its unlikely, so that you don't just have to take my word for it. I've got two.     First, an easy way to test if the change in color is in the LED or the super cooling would be to remove one of the variables. If we can just send some light through the liquid nitrogen and see if it comes out a different color then it would seem the LED isn't required for the effect. The problem is that Liquid Nitrogen generally isn't displayed in a transparent container (this is the only decent video I could find). You'd also have to ask yourself to what degree is the color (wavelength or frequency) being changed. How do you know you have enough Liquid Nitrogen to make a noticeable change. What is the intensity of the spectrum that will be shifted int our visible spectrum?   I think the strongest evidence that I can offer is in the linked gif. If the change in temperature is changing the frequency of the light from the LED, surely its also changing the frequency of the light coming off the bottom of the container. However, before the LED is lowered into the container we see that the container under the liquid nitrogen is the same color as the container above the liquid nitrogen (well, maybe a little brighter). The only way that this could be, assuming that the temperature does impact the color of light, is if the visible spectrum is the same both before and after being cooled. That's not impossible but its something to think about.   Second: Light travels through space. Indeed on a journey from a start to the earth light spends a vast majority of its time in space. If space is really really cold, and a bath in liquid nitrogen changes the color of an LED from yellow to green, what does that mean for color of the stars?   If I knew how much you know about light I could give you a more technical answer."
chemicalreactiongifs,3bp9so,Imosa1,2,Wed Jul 1 05:20:16 2015 UTC,"The space question is exactly what I was thinking of in asking about the possibility of temperature changing the color of the light. I would think it would not be possible, or perhaps only on a very tiny scale. Changing how the semiconductor works is a neat trick, but changing the light itself would be really interesting."
chemicalreactiongifs,3bp9so,DeathByTrayItShallBe,2,Wed Jul 1 05:25:17 2015 UTC,"lol, I just realized something about the space question. If you looked for a change in color of stars, you would actually find it because of the expanding universe. That might lead you to believe that the light just changes color by virtue of traveling through cold space. It even fits that starts which are further away would experience a stronger color change since the light from those stars is traveling through more cold space."
chemicalreactiongifs,3bp9so,Imosa1,2,Wed Jul 1 05:38:13 2015 UTC,"Exactly haha, its amazing how one small change to how light could be effected could unravel the most accepted theories :)"
chemicalreactiongifs,3bp9so,DeathByTrayItShallBe,0,Wed Jul 1 05:44:15 2015 UTC,Yes simply by increasing the voltage you can also change the wavelength   Source: I did it in lab when I was getting my EE associates
chemicalreactiongifs,3bp9so,wh3at13y,10,Wed Jul 1 18:33:23 2015 UTC,Why does it flicker between green and yellow at the end? From the explanations here it seems like it should be one or the other.
chemicalreactiongifs,3bp9so,nklim,29,Wed Jul 1 04:09:31 2015 UTC,It appears the LED is starting to break from stress: the different materials contract at different rates when cooled and this probably created a loose connection.  The yellow color at the end could be a camera/gif artifact.
chemicalreactiongifs,3bp9so,pyrophorus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:32:48 2015 UTC,They may have hooked it to a constant voltage rather than current source and it busted as the resistance dropped from the cold.  But that raises the question of whether the voltage drop should increase as it cools and works at higher photon energies.  Another way to see the wavelength shift is to blast 10x as much current as is safe through an LED.  For the few seconds it lasts you can see it shift toward red before it dies.

When the semiconductor gets cold enough, the space (energy gap, also known as bandgap) between the excited state and ground state increases, which results in a green color light because the electrons now release more energy when taken down to the ground state.   Sorry I tried to ELI13."

chemicalreactiongifs,3bp9so,MyLifeIsAwry,5,Wed Jul 1 04:37:31 2015 UTC,"An adequate explanation of band gap vs. atomic spacing is quite complicated - if you're interested, you might consider looking into band theory.  Here is my attempt at an (oversimplified) explanation.  Essentially, as atoms get closer together, the attractive forces that they exert on electrons begin to overlap.  As a result, the electrons are held more tightly to the atoms, which means that more energy is required to excite them (and conversely, they release more energy when they drop to lower energy states)."
chemicalreactiongifs,3bp9so,r4mbini,2,Wed Jul 1 05:46:32 2015 UTC,Do you have the less simplified explanation? I thought that ordering the crystal would promote orbital overlap between atoms and decrease the band gap
chemicalreactiongifs,3bp9so,MyLifeIsAwry,3,Wed Jul 1 06:51:46 2015 UTC,"I think what you're getting at is the concept of electron bands, which is where the allowed energy levels for an electron widen as you bring two atoms closer together.  One explanation for this phenomenon is the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two electrons with the same spin cannot occupy the same energy level.  It's much easier (for better or for worse) to describe the concept of bands from a solid-state physics perspective rather than a chemistry one.  As /u/trashaccountname mentioned below, the Kronig-Penney model that we are both referencing basically comes from solving Schrodinger's equation for the case of a periodic, finite potential.  Now that I look at it, Figure 2.3.2 on this site is a pretty good explanation for what happens to the bands and band gap of a semiconductor as you decrease the lattice spacing."

chemicalreactiongifs,3bp9so,trashaccountname,4,Sun Jul 12 03:33:47 2015 UTC,"A decrease in temperature means that the amplitude of atomic vibrations is decreased, meaning that the distance between atoms is decreased. When the distance between atoms decreases, the outer electrons experience a larger periodic potential. Through some complex math (Schrodinger equation) it can be shown that this increase in potential causes an increase in band gap size.

In the back is a fluorescent screen that glows green when illuminated with short-wave UV light.  A UV lamp is presumably behind the camera.  The beauty of this setup is that the UV light comes from a mercury emission line inside the lamp: exactly the right wavelength to excite the same transition in the mercury vapor between the lamp and the screen.  You could set this up pretty easily in most chemistry labs with a standard (short-wave) UV lamp, indicating TLC plate, and some mercury."

chemicalreactiongifs,3b6hrm,captpiggard,8,Fri Jun 26 20:04:51 2015 UTC,Kinetics of iodine reacting with starch are such that it is a very fast reaction but the reverse reaction is slow. There is a small activation energy in the forward direction and it is moderately exothermic. The reverse must overcome a much larger activation energy and is a net endothermic process (it occurs because it is coupled to other more favorable rxns)

chemicalreactiongifs,3b0xmh,Nuguns21,50,Thu Jun 25 02:30:18 2015 UTC,"Aluminum oxidizes(""rusts"")   in air quite rapidly,  but the oxide normally forms a tough, airtight shell that prevents further oxidation. The mercury disrupts the structure of the oxide so air can continue to oxidize the metal.  We're used to thinking of aluminum as non rusting, but it reacts with air more strongly than iron.   Tl;dr: The mercury screws with aluminums hard oxide layer so it just rusts away."
chemicalreactiongifs,3b0xmh,vmullapudi1,4,Thu Jun 25 02:39:33 2015 UTC,Mercury and Gallium also intercalate between the individual crystals of aluminum weakening the physical structure.  The grain boundaries have unsatisfied aluminum bonds and thus higher surface area. This higher surface energy leads to preferential attack/alloying by the Hg/Ga metal.

chemicalreactiongifs,3b0xmh,shieldvexor,26,Fri Jun 26 07:05:57 2015 UTC,"This reaction speeds up at low pressures, and was used by the French resistance to sabotage German aircraft in WW2. By putting enough liquid mercury in the fuselage of an aircraft with extensive aluminum components, irreparable damage can be caused when the aircraft travels to high altitude (low pressure),in some cases, causing a crash."
chemicalreactiongifs,3b0xmh,bubblequinn,11,Fri Jun 26 17:22:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think the pressure part of that statement is true.  There's no solid/liquid->gas transition that could be accelerated in a Le Châtelier sense, and in general pressure only effects reaction rates of gases and in the opposite way (more pressure faster reaction). The atmospheric pressure at 10000m is 10% of sea level, so even if it were playing a role, the change in driving force is only one order of magnitude."
chemicalreactiongifs,3b0xmh,lichlord,2,Thu Jun 25 03:22:38 2015 UTC,I think you are right. That portion doesn't stand up when you think about it critically.
chemicalreactiongifs,3b0xmh,bubblequinn,0,Thu Jun 25 12:32:53 2015 UTC,"Actually it absolutely does. Not saying it's true, but that it could be. If the mercury-aluminum bond lengths are greater than those of reactants, then the volume will increase over the course of the reaction and it will go faster at a lower pressure"
chemicalreactiongifs,3b0xmh,shieldvexor,0,Thu Jun 25 22:46:37 2015 UTC,This is incorrect. There are countless reactions that don't involve formation or removal of gas that are affected by pressure
chemicalreactiongifs,3b0xmh,shieldvexor,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:11:19 2015 UTC,"Can you give me one example?  When we have a solid or a liquid they're basically incompressible and there's virtually molar no volume change. To first order, two species reacting depends on their interaction frequency which is dependent on concentration. If the molar volume doesn't change, the concentration doesn't change and thus there's no change in reaction rate.  If you have one species decomposing into a gas then the above doesn't apply, and by Le Châtelier the equilibrium and thus driving force is pushed left at higher pressures, lowering the reaction rate.  /u/bubblequinn was also referencing atmospheric pressure and lower, not multi MPa pressures.  Aluminum has a elastic modulus of 69 GPa, which using Hooke's Law, means to get even a 1% change in the bond length you're looking at almost 7000 atm of pressure whereas we're talking about less than 1atm of change.  Further, Mercury and Gallium react with Aluminium at the grain boundaries, not in the bulk. At the grain boundaries there's already additional surface free energy (well, technically a surface stress because it's a solid, but it's still an energy unit) from the unfulfilled aluminum bonds. The addition of an adsorbate or absorbate to these bonds lowers their energy and decreases bond length (the best background for understanding this is Langmuir adsoption isotherms).  I appreciate your attempt to contribute, but you're arguing for subtleties that, while they might exist are overpowered by solid state phenomenon you might not be familiar with, and in general your gen-chem book is right in saying solids and liquid reaction rates are not effected by pressure.  edit: toned down my post a little after seeing this http://snoopsnoo.com/u/shieldvexor"

chemicalreactiongifs,3b0xmh,leathergiggle,6,Fri Jun 26 02:49:59 2015 UTC,"Precursors aside, the other day I was what wondering 'Thermite' actually is and what it's normally used for. Thermite is a chemical that became infamous after it was apparently detected in the aftermath/rubble of 9/11, some people  have claimed this is proof that it was used as an explosive that was already planted in the towers before the planes struck. I'm sure this shows up in most 9/11 conspiracy documentaries, but I never saw an explanation for what it actually is apart from having explosive properties. As it turns out, one of it's regular uses is making welds strong enough to keep steel beams/girders together or in the construction of train tracks, like this. So it would seem far more likely it was always present in the buildings since their initial creation and not somehow implanted at a later time to coincide with the planes hitting the towers. But the cold hard truth is that we watched those buildings fall to the ground and we don't have to debate whether it's possible to bring down a skyscraper with or without explosives, we learned all too well it was entirely possible and that should have been all the evidence we needed.  edit: some better formatting and explanation"
chemicalreactiongifs,3b0xmh,nativeofspace,5,Thu Jun 25 03:37:02 2015 UTC,Thermite is just a mixture of aluminum and iron oxide powders in a specific ratio.  The products of its reaction are metallic iron and aluminum oxide.  It would be highly surprising not to find iron and aluminum in the rubble of a collapsed building.
chemicalreactiongifs,3b0xmh,smithsp86,6,Thu Jun 25 03:58:18 2015 UTC,"Typical construction steel is ASTM alloy A992 which has a tensile yield strength of 345 MPa.  If you get it up to about 600o C (which is before it starts to glow red from black body radiation), it will loose about half that strength. (pdf warning)  Typical engineering practice is to design a structure to it's failure point and then double it's strength so you have a safety factor of 100% extra.  If you can heat a majority portion of the structure (say 50% of one floor) to 600o C it will reach it's failure point.  The point is that no melting is necessary. You just need a hot fire covering a large area. Jet fuel can handle that task just fine."

Ignited it in a clay pot on the hood of a car. You could feel the radiant heat from 30 feet away. The goal was to have the liquid iron run out of the hole in the bottom of the pot, and melt through the car.  Unfortunately, I made two mistakes, I used a (free, donated) pot from home depot that had a crack in it, so it split, and dumped the stuff everywhere. I also could have put the magnesium igniter in the bottom, not the top, and burned from the bottom up; but, I thought that might have caused it to throw burning thermite around everywhere if the bottom ignited under compression."

For about 99% of chemical fires dumping large amounts of water, even if it does react, will put them out because of the sheer amount of thermal energy a torrent of water can put out pyrophorics. I work mainly with pyrophoric chemicals in production, and the only time we disable our water based fire suppression system is with certain metals such as the ones found here. With those we put them in a self contained room and pray that they don't start on fire. If they do, let them just burn the room."

The image of a high-temperature superconductor levitating above a magnet in fog of liquid nitrogen can hardly surprise anyone these days – it has become common knowledge that superconductors are ideal diamagnetics and magnetic field must expel them. On the other hand, the enclosed photographs of water and a frog hovering inside a magnet (not on board a spacecraft) are somewhat counterintuitive and will probably take many people (even physicists) by surprise. This is the first observation of magnetic levitation of living organisms as well as the first images of diamagnetics levitated in a normal, room-temperature environment (if we disregard the tale about Flying Coffin of Mohammed as such evidence, of course). In fact, it is possible to levitate magnetically every material and every living creature on the earth due to the always present molecular magnetism. The molecular magnetism is very weak (millions times weaker than ferromagnetism) and usually remains unnoticed in everyday life, thereby producing the wrong impression that materials around us are mainly nonmagnetic. But they are all magnetic. It is just that magnetic fields required to levitate all these ""nonmagnetic"" materials have to be approximately 100 times larger than for the case of, say, superconductors.[...]"

chemicalreactiongifs,3aiu78,rixuraxu,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:37:14 2015 UTC,"why isnt the water stopping the reaction?    Because water can't stop this reaction   That's a really unsatisfying answer, and the part about being too hot isn't the answer either. It has nothing to do with heat, just the chemistry in play, and this is chemical reaction gifs. You really make it sound like water wants to stop chemical reactions.  It isn't burning in the common sense since its oxidant is the metal oxide, not atmospheric oxygen."
chemicalreactiongifs,3aiu78,Compizfox,6,Sat Jun 20 20:38:06 2015 UTC,"You really make it sound like water wants to stop chemical reactions.   In a way... yes. Water has a very high specific heat capacity and also a very high enthalpy of vaporization at a relatively low boiling point.  If the reaction wasn't so exothermic the water could have stopped the reaction by (evaporative) cooling.  However the reaction is so exothermic, once you have set if off there is no way you can put it out again. At least, not with water."

chemicalreactiongifs,3aiu78,scurvybill,3,Sat Jun 20 17:33:41 2015 UTC,I wonder how much the water changed temperature with each of the reactions...  Especially that thermite.
chemicalreactiongifs,3aiu78,thetoethumb,7,Sat Jun 20 17:05:31 2015 UTC,"What's cool is that the water doesn't change temperature until later in the reaction, because it's insulated from the thermite by the Leidenfrost effect! So the thermite has to cool off to the point where it doesn't create a protective vapor barrier between it and the liquid water, then you'll see that tank start to boil like crazy."
chemicalreactiongifs,3aiu78,scurvybill,2,Sat Jun 20 20:04:14 2015 UTC,There's definitely water boiling there but I'm not quite sure the thermite is hot enough to cause the effect in water. Water has a phenomenally high heat of vaporisation
chemicalreactiongifs,3aiu78,thetoethumb,7,Sat Jun 20 22:24:38 2015 UTC,"The heat of vaporization of water is about 40 kJ/mol and the heat output of a thermite reaction is about 850 kJ/mol, so the thermite is absolutely hot enough to cause the effect in water. You don't even need a full blown chemical reaction to cause the Leidenfrost effect."
chemicalreactiongifs,3aiu78,scurvybill,2,Sat Jun 20 22:35:46 2015 UTC,"The heat of vaporisation on a volumetric basis would be more useful here due to the different densities but fair point. However, look at the slow mo replay. Definitely no evidence of the Leidenfrost there"
chemicalreactiongifs,3aiu78,thetoethumb,6,Sat Jun 20 22:47:14 2015 UTC,"Look at this image.  The picture on the left is Leidenfrost boiling. Note the smooth laminar flow of the bubbles. The picture on the right is when the temperature has fallen to reach nucleation boiling. Note the rough turbulent flow of the bubbles. The slow-mo would look like ""fog"" if it was nucleation boiling. The slow-mow only plainly shows that film boiling is occurring.  The heat output is so extremely high that I can't understand how it wouldn't cause a Leidenfrost effect. Explain to me how this much heat output could possibly NOT cause a Leidenfrost effect or reach the film boiling phase. So many objects and reactions with lower heat outputs DO cause the Leidenfrost effect."

It's not the water that's touching the hot grease that's the issue, it's that the grease touching the open flame. Because of this it's also dangerous to do things like drop a big thing in it quicky."
chemicalreactiongifs,3acqw2,wallawalla22,3,Fri Jun 19 02:34:41 2015 UTC,You're right. But the oil gets to the flame because the water flashes to steam when it hits the hot oil.  It's why the best thing to do with hot oil is turn the heat off and leave it alone. Or if it's on fire use an inert powder extinguisher (or CO2)

chemicalreactiongifs,3a60ew,Tim_the-Enchanter,93,Wed Jun 17 14:49:13 2015 UTC,I'm guessing that they have very similar refractive indices and/or virtually the same speed of light through their respective media. I'm certainly not sure though.
chemicalreactiongifs,3a60ew,NewNullObject,49,Wed Jun 17 14:50:23 2015 UTC,You can tell a real diamond from glass by putting it in saturated sugar water.
chemicalreactiongifs,3a60ew,chemistry_teacher,47,Wed Jun 17 14:58:38 2015 UTC,"Diamond has an index of refraction around 2.4, among the highest known (most others are man-made).  Glass has an index much closer to water (depends on the glass, but never straying very far).  That means diamonds would likely sparkle quite well even in water (if less so due to reduced likelihood of total internal reflection), whereas a glass crystal would be nearly invisible and certainly fail to sparkle the way a diamond would.  Sugar water has a higher index than pure water, and much closer to the indices of glass used for ""gems"" (harder and more sparkly)."

chemicalreactiongifs,3a60ew,imgonnabutteryobread,2,Wed Jun 17 14:53:52 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. Fresnel reflection occurs due to a difference in indices at an optical interface. The greater the difference, the less transparent the interface is because of this reflection/contrast.   Index-matching is a technique used to improve transparency at optical interfaces. The epoxy used to glue doublet lenses together is usually chosen with a refractive index somewhere halfway between that of the crown and flint glasses in the lens. Pretty cool shit."

Would this explosion happen in an oxygen depleted environment like nitrogen gas?  Sorry for the all the questions, I just like explosions."
chemicalreactiongifs,39x95k,nanosik,30,Mon Jun 15 16:50:05 2015 UTC,"If you look on the periodic table, the first group is the Alkali metals.  These are metals that have one electron in their outermost shell, this makes them incredibly unstable.  The reason for this is because the most chemically stable an atom can be, is when it has a complete outer shell (the outer shell is known as the ""valence"" electrons).  This is why Noble gases are so stable and nonreactive.  They have a complete valence electron shell, so they don't want to give up or accept any electrons, because that would detract from their chemical stability.  The alkali metals on the other hand want to get rid of an electron like crazy!  They have this annoying extra electron on top of a full and stable shell.  So whenever the chance arises, these metals will give off an electron.  The further down the table you go, the more it wants to get rid of it's electron as well.  Cesium is incredibly violent when it comes in contact with water, where as lithium will react, but it won't explode.  The chemical reaction that's happening is this:  2 Na + 2H2O = 2 NaOH + H2  The sodium gives off its electron to the positively charged hydrogen, splitting the water into hydrogen gas and a hydroxyl group.  The hydroxyl group is negatively charged (Because it lost the hydrogen) and so it attracted to the sodium ion (which is positive now because it has given up an electron).  The heat from this reaction though (The reaction I wrote above in bold) produces enough heat to ignite the hydrogen gas with oxygen in the air.  This causes an explosion, resulting in the production of water.  Lithium is not as ""positive"" as Sodium, and so it does not strip the hydroxyl groups with as much energy.  Thus there is not enough heat to ignite the hydrogen gas, and it quickly dissipates in the surrounding air.  Edit:  I found this pretty good video that shows each one of the alkali metals reacting in water!  Double edit:  As /u/nanosik pointed out with, what i wrote above isn't the whole story.  He linked to this article which talks about what is REALLY happening.  It apparently wasn't understood until very recently, but here's a quote from the article:   The explosion, say Pavel Jungwirth and his collaborators at the Czech Academy of Sciences in Prague, is not merely a consequence of the ignition of the hydrogen gas that the alkali metals release from water. That may happen eventually, but it begins as something far stranger: a rapid exodus of electrons followed by explosion of the metal driven by electrical repulsion.   So the hydrogen gas is ignited, though that is not the source of the explosion.  Rather it is the incredibly rapid movement of the electrons that actually drives the sodium atoms apart.  My description above as to how these electrons are given up to the hydroxyl group is still correct though."
chemicalreactiongifs,39x95k,VladimirZharkov,25,Mon Jun 15 17:08:49 2015 UTC,"This is the classical explanation, but is very wrong.  Biphasic reactions can never explode, unless there's something really interesting going on:  http://www.nature.com/news/sodium-s-explosive-secrets-revealed-1.16771"

chemicalreactiongifs,39x95k,fexxi,3,Mon Jun 15 17:34:19 2015 UTC,That is so fucking cool. Basically the alkali atoms are pulling themselves into the water at the speed of sound to increase surface area and increase reaction rate. What a time to be alive.

Such a fascinating new look at something we thought we understood.  Mindblown.gif
chemicalreactiongifs,39x95k,AbsoluteZro,3,Tue Jun 16 06:16:13 2015 UTC,"There are still a few things wrong with your explanation.    The sodium gives off its electron to a hydroxyl group (OH), forming potassium hydroxide (NaOH). The OH is stripped from the H2O, releasing Hydrogen gas (H2)   This whole thing is not a very good explanation. Here's a revision:  It is best thought of as a single replacement reaction. Water can be thought of as a combination of a hydrogen ion (H+ ) and hydroxide ion (OH- the charges are important, don't just write OH). Sodium is neutral and transfers it's valence electron to the H+ ion (not the OH- ), therefore becoming positively charged and the hydrogen ion becomes neutral. The Na+ ion and OH- ion combine to form sodium hydroxide (you said potassium hydroxide). Technically they don't because they are in solution but that's not really important."

chemicalreactiongifs,39x95k,Dick__Marathon,2,Mon Jun 15 18:25:36 2015 UTC,You can make subscripts like this:  H2O   H*_2_*O   When the electrons from the metal transfer to the water (changing H+ to H) you are left with a whole bunch of positive ions (Na+ ) which repel each other creating the explosion.  The gas ignition can be observed independently and the explosion will occur in an inert atmosphere.

Also pure lemon juice has a pH of 2.3, much higher than coke and yet we don't think of it as that bad. Hell, the Hydrochloric acid that our stomach secretes has a pH of 1 which is much more than that.  The only problem with coke is that we consume this acid day in and day out. You don't see (most people) consuming large quantities of lemon juice like you do coke or sour candy (pH of 2 and lower). It may not be that strong of an acid but it is still an acid.

The energy generated from shaking the bottle forces the supercooled water molecules to form a crystal in a process called nucleation.

chemicalreactiongifs,39ghdj,kenyard,1 point,Fri Jun 12 07:19:59 2015 UTC,Yes. But it applies to what you see in the gif. It freezes from one point. The spread of the freezing will be slower if it is colder. If you supercool it much further you would probably need to start applying huge pressure to stop the nucleation starting itself thoigh. I believe there is something about normal condition water also. It freezes faster the warmer it is. My friend was on about it the other day.

The equation was proposed by Svante Arrhenius in 1889, based on the work of Dutch chemist Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff who had noted in 1884 that Van 't Hoff's equation for the temperature dependence of equilibrium constants suggests such a formula for the rates of both forward and reverse reactions. Arrhenius provided a physical justification and interpretation for the formula.    Currently, it is best seen as an empirical relationship.  It can be used to model the temperature variation of diffusion coefficients, population of crystal vacancies, creep rates, and many other thermally-induced processes/reactions. The Eyring equation, developed in 1935, also expresses the relationship between rate and energy.

The higher the temperature the more energy the pieces have. So theyre moving around faster than colder pieces. The faster it is moving the higher a probability it touches a piece of the ice lattice and when it does it adds to the ice structure. It's why the ice spreads throughout from that one first piece of ice at the  starting point

Pouring the water onto a bowl of ice cubes forms a slushy ice. As the supercooled water hits the ice cube nuclei in the bowl, the crystallization spreads up the stream of the water as it gets poured onto the pile. The latent heat that is released during the freezing process stops it from freezing solid. Dropping an ice cube directly down into a glass or just touching an ice cube to the surface of the water provides the nucleus needed for the supercooled water to freeze completely."
chemicalreactiongifs,39ghdj,Lereas,2,Thu Jun 11 19:32:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, and actually this is how those reusable instant hot packs work.   Those contain a supercooled solution of sodium acetate. Sodium acetate freezes at 137F or so, meaning it should be a soild at any temp below that. However, it easily is supercooled.  So they put it in a pouch with a little ""clicker"" disc and when you click it, you create a nucleation site which causes the crystalization cascade, which is pretty exothermic. It stays hot for a while.  Then when it cools (finishes freezing) you can put it in a pot of boiling water for a while and re melt it, then let it cool slowly and reuse it"

Normally the freezing happens so slowly it isn't a factor, but in this scenario it does. If you were to put it back in the freezer it would continue freezing and expand as usual.   "" Water releases 80 calories per gram when turning from a liquid to a solid. We suspect your freezer is only a few degrees Celsius below zero(perhaps ten or fifteen?), and the specific heat of water is one calorie per degree per gram. This means that your water, as it freezes, warms up the rest of the water until the process stops at 0 degrees Celsius, freezing perhaps ten or twenty percent of the water.

Ice-nine is supposedly a polymorph of water more stable than common ice (Ice Ih); instead of melting at 0 °C (32 °F), it melts at 45.8 °C (114.4 °F). When ice-nine comes into contact with liquid water below 45.8 °C (thus effectively becoming supercooled), it acts as a seed crystal and causes the solidification of the entire body of water, which quickly crystallizes as more ice-nine. As people are mostly water, ice-nine kills nearly instantly when ingested or brought into contact with soft tissues exposed to the bloodstream, such as the eyes.

This structure formed is more highly ordered than free water molecules due to the water molecules arranging themselves to interact as much as possible with themselves, and thus results in a higher entropic state which causes non-polar molecules to clump together to reduce the surface area exposed to water and decrease the entropy of the system.[4][5] Thus, the two immiscible phases (hydrophilic vs. hydrophobic) will change so that their corresponding interfacial area will be minimal. This effect can be visualized in the phenomenon called phase separation"

A war injury caused substantial damage to the left side of his face; he lost his eye, most of his cheek bone, the left half of his upper jaw and endured heavy scarring. In order to enter society with the least amount of distress, Harrow covers his scars with a tin plate that was molded to his face and painted to match his skin tone.  After the war, Harrow returned home to Wisconsin where his twin sister, Emma, provided care for him as his wounds healed. He had a very close relationship with his sister growing up, but found it difficult to reconnect with her after being exposed to the horrors of war. Soon after he was well enough to care for himself, Harrow left to live in Chicago. It is there, in an army hospital, where he meets Jimmy Darmody. After feeling an instant kinship through their shared war experiences, Jimmy invites Harrow to stay with him to become a part of his bootlegging crew. His duties generally include keeping guard while Jimmy negotiates deals, delivering liquor orders and being a hitman when situations call for it.

chemicalreactiongifs,3919c2,pavetheatmosphere,9,Mon Jun 8 18:04:53 2015 UTC,I wouldn't've thought there was enough dissolved CO2 to convert to oxygen at that rate.  Fascinating.
chemicalreactiongifs,3919c2,Seicair,18,Mon Jun 8 19:33:34 2015 UTC,The oceans are the biggest carbon sinks on the planet. One of the dangers of high CO2 in the atmosphere is that the oceans absorb so much of it that it's making them acidic. Shellfish are the first to be affected because it's more difficult for them to build/maintain their shells in a more acidic environment.
chemicalreactiongifs,3919c2,dalgeek,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:01:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know CO2 dissolves in water and forms carbonic acid.  I don't know how it compares to the amount present in air, though, with regards to availability for photosynthesis.  (And for some reason I'm unable to find out.  Can't figure out which search terms to use, I guess.)"

I can't find my sources right now, but at equilibrium water usually has 0.5-5 ppm CO2 while the atmosphere at sea level has ~400 ppm CO2. Aquatic plants have evolved to account for this.

chemicalreactiongifs,3919c2,jonophant,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:40:20 2015 UTC,"No, that's wrong. Plants use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and and water in the photosynthesis process. They absorb dissolved carbon dioxide from the water to be used with the other readily available components to grow."
chemicalreactiongifs,3919c2,xTELOx,3,Tue Jun 9 12:14:55 2015 UTC,Photosynthesis isn't bound to h2o. There are some bacteria that make photosynthesis with h2s. In this case in the end 2 s will be emitted.   And one question. What have I said wrong which you corrected in your statement?
chemicalreactiongifs,3919c2,jonophant,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:27:46 2015 UTC,"For photosynthesis to occur, you need a source of carbon. In this case, and in most cases, that comes in the form of carbon dioxide, CO2. What bacteria do isn't really relevant here since they're not plants, aquatic or otherwise.   I was correcting your description of photosynthesis. You're statement wasn't complete.   Edit: a word"
chemicalreactiongifs,3919c2,xTELOx,0,Tue Jun 9 16:37:57 2015 UTC,My statement was not complete that's right. But not wrong. And it specifically needs co2 since you need oxygen for sugar and as I said: the oxygen from the water is emitted therefore it isn't in the sugar. -> you need co2 for photosynthesis not just any source of carbon. But you don't necessarily need h2o. H2s for example can be used too.
chemicalreactiongifs,3919c2,jonophant,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:54:29 2015 UTC,"CO2 sinks, there is plenty in the ocean.

chemicalreactiongifs,3919c2,ConanTheRedditor,2,Mon Jun 8 21:05:17 2015 UTC,Plants don't. The resulting oxygen comes from the H2O. The O2 from the CO2 is in the resulting sugar

chemicalreactiongifs,3919c2,NinjaJediSaiyan,3,Mon Jun 8 22:17:41 2015 UTC,They are o2. Why not? It's just that the o2 isn't from the co2 but from the h2o  Photosynthesis: co2 + 2 h2xy -light-> ch2o + 2xy +h2o  xy... differs. normally it's oxygen but it can also be sulphur (photosynthesis doesn't necessarily mean you get oxygen but it normally does.)

chemicalreactiongifs,3919c2,NinjaJediSaiyan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:53:13 2015 UTC,"Plants don't. The resulting oxygen comes from the H2O.   You suggest this process is happening somewhere other than inside the plant?  OP's comment was not incorrect.  A plant can turn CO2 [and water, and light] into O2 [and sugar, and less water].  When OP says a plant turns CO2 into O2, do you think they're suggesting the Carbon atom is transmuted into Oxygen?  Of course not.  So why not go a bit further and assume the rest too."
chemicalreactiongifs,3919c2,buyingthething,2,Wed Jun 10 03:52:25 2015 UTC,Because it is specifically the oxygen atom off the water which is emitted and not the o2 off the co2.

chemicalreactiongifs,3919c2,pavetheatmosphere,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:28:31 2015 UTC,"Much of it does. Cyanobacteria (green algae), dinoflagellates (alveolates) and diatoms (brown algae) are all photosynthetic plankton, and contribute significant amounts to the global oxygen supply. Benthic algae in the brown and red/green algae rely on extremely shallow coastal regions to produce oxygen as they're limited to getting enough light at depth. So most of the oceanic primary production is done by phytoplankton."

The amount of venom transmitted in a bite isn't to subsatial (volume wise) especially when you consider it relative to the volume of blood in a human body. The amount of blood he uses in the demonstration is very small I believe it was done to exaggerate the effect.
chemicalreactiongifs,38yq35,5yearsHTML,81,Mon Jun 8 00:10:16 2015 UTC,"Coagulation is a positive feed back system. If it's not caused by native causes and is kept in check by its own self regulatory measures (like when you cut yourself), it can spin out of controle. The reason this blood clotted I'd due to the type of snake it's from. Possibly russelli russelli vipera. It has enzymes in its venom that activate factor V and factor X from their zymogen state to their enzyme state. The two together then activate prothrombin to thrombin causing your blood to clot via fibrin strand formation. While your body may shut down some of the X and five to try and controle coagulation. The snakes venom enzymes continue to activate the rest of the V and X through out the system causing uncontrolled coagulation. Not all snake venom acts in this way."

chemicalreactiongifs,38yq35,Ds14,2,Mon Jun 8 18:06:14 2015 UTC,Proteins are not living and art sent like say white blood cells are rather they are equally distributed through out the blood. Yes it would take longer to coagulat a much larger volume of blood. But death via clotting or death via inability to clot due to the exauhstion of clotting factors would be curtain.

Like, white blood cells ""go"" somewhere and move around on their own, but I was under the impression that other stuff could be guided through chemical gradients, tagging, weird molecular level biomechanical stuff, etc that could send things to mediate something like out of control clotting.  Just clarifying what I meant, I'm interested in how this works."
chemicalreactiongifs,38yq35,Ds14,2,Mon Jun 8 19:16:04 2015 UTC,"Your fine I'm not taking your questions as being confrontational. Your question is kind of difficult to explain. Your not wrong in your thinking of proteins being guided and held where they're needed. In a normal system that's kind of what happens, that's why all your blood doesn't clot every time you get a paper cut. However it's important to remember that this venom is designed to override all the safety stops your body would have. The parts of your blood that keep it from clotting are essentially free floating and do not concentrate. The proteins that cause the clot do concentrate at the cite of the clot via binding to cell walls. Any free floating enzymes causing a clot like thrombin are quickly turned off oce they leave the local area by inhibitors like ATIII. What I'm trying g to say here is that blood in the glass has everything it needs to stop itself from clotting out of control the same as inside your body. The snake venom is just able to over power that and cause the blood to clot anyway. I hope I'm helping here. There is really a lot going on in this clip."
chemicalreactiongifs,38yq35,squall1036,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:10:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think I get it now. The process I was describing before would probably apply more to like inflammation after getting a cut or something, but because of the nature of how clotting works and how this particular enzyme causes clotting, it doesn't matter if it's occurring inside or outside of a living organism. Thanks for the clarification.  Another question though, does the volume of blood passing through the veins per unit of time decrease or increase the effect?

Other types of venom are narcotic, and cause tissue death, or may be a nerve ajent killing it's prey by stopping it's heart and breathing. In fact there is at least one type of snake that causes blood to be unable to coagulat causing whatever it bites to bleed out. Source: I work with coagulation causing snake venom at work."

chemicalreactiongifs,38yq35,king_of_the_universe,123,Mon Jun 8 11:15:48 2015 UTC,"Not all snakes are venomous. Venom is a very precious resource in the animal kingdom, and snakes tend to save it for prey. Sometimes they'll do a ""dry-bite"" where they don't inject venom into the target (I'm not sure on the frequencies so don't ask me). Not all snakes have hemotoxin (toxin that affects the blood). Many snakes use a nuerotoxin that attacks the nervous system, which makes sense since it's used to immobilize and subdue prey. If a snake bites you and it does inject toxin, it might not be enough to elicit that type of response. Granted, they're some nasty chemicals, but it's not necessarily a death sentence."

Going off on what you said about dry-bites, the copperhead (and some other pitvipers) deliver dry-bites generally because making venom is kind of a big metabolic process and saving venom is a good thing; snakes understand what they can and can't eat and copperheads can't eat us so.... why waste it?  Snakes are neat."

The post gave way, and the mailbox fell towards my car. The mail slid out of the box before the box hit my car, so I shoved the box over, away from my car, and opened my door to get the mail off the ground. Little did I know the mail had landed on a copperhead. I opened the door with my right hand, and picked up the mail with my left. The snake bit me (barely, one fang) on the last knuckle of my left pointer finger. I got my first ambulance ride out of it, since my Postmaster wouldn't allow me to drive myself back to the Post Office. I was EXTREMELY mad at the attending doctor in the ER because they wouldn't (and couldn't) give me anything for the pain since I didn't bring the snake in for a positive ID. Basically I sat in observation for a night and they sent me home. They did send me home with a prescription of percocets.   2 pics taken the night I got home. http://i.imgur.com/BfEA48t.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/4s29FAF.jpg"

The primary concern with giving an opiate to a snake bite is the possibility of it being neurotoxic, causing low blood pressure and potentially respiratory failure, and we wouldn't want to make it worse. However, if you weren't exhibiting any of these signs, then I would have give something, and be ready with vasopressors, fluid therapy and be prepared for intubation if necessary. There is no reason to make you lay there suffering. At the very least, they could have given you an NSAID."

chemicalreactiongifs,38r0wj,TEKNOC,5,Sat Jun 6 05:37:25 2015 UTC,"I have a question about the boiling that is probably more suited to physics, but as this gif hasn't been posted to /r/physicsgifs, I hope no-one minds me asking it here:  I'm surprised about the relative lack of violence from the lava entering the water. At the end of the gif, you can see the lava bubbling in the tundish as it fills up the shroud and the water in the shroud boils, but if that was molten steel entering water like that, the boiling would be explosive. Why is there less explosive boiling - is it due to a lower temperature (I think that this lava is about 1200ºC, instead of 1600ºC for steel - but would that make such a difference) or is it due to a density difference between steel and lava, with the much denser steel allowing the steam to build up to a much higher pressure?"
chemicalreactiongifs,38r0wj,paleo2002,2,Sat Jun 6 06:12:35 2015 UTC,"Throwing out an idea- /r/geology might be a good place to ask this. I would assume four major factors: the specific heats of basalt lava vs steel, volumes of basalt and steel (steel's 3 times denser than basalt), relative volumes of water boiled, and the fact that they're using a conduit to channel the lava to the bottom of the water basin.   The Syracuse University page for the lava project places the temperature of the lava in the crucible at 1250C. This isn't hot enough to cause significant thermolysis, but it will flash boil the water it comes into contact with. Steel poured at >2000C  would produce at least some thermolysis and this would be superfun times extremely dangerous. Assuming nothing beyond 1600C for the steel, you're down to the physical properties of the material interacting with the boiling water.  A temperature difference of 400degrees is significant to how much steam is produced. A liter of water would be (napkin mathing it) 6700 liters of ssteam at 1200C and 8500 liters of steam at 1600C. As we've noted the volume of steam at a few hundred degrees difference is fairly huge, the volume of water and thus the amount of energy it can absorb before producing a large amount of steam matters. A small amount of water into molten material is a huge cloud of steam- a small amount of molten material into a large body of water is vaguely warmer water."

chemicalreactiongifs,38ebm9,tilsitforthenommage,6,Wed Jun 3 23:45:15 2015 UTC,"Just did the math on it..   A pre-1982 penny weighs 3.11g.  There are 453.6 grams in a pound, so it would take 145.8 pennies to equal a pound.  However, they are 95% copper (2.95g), not 100%. So you would need 153.8 pennies for a pound of pure copper.  The current price of copper is $2.71/lb.  For every $1.00 in pennies, you turn a $0.79 profit.  And you'd need 369 lbs of pennies (56,000 of them) to earn $1000 profit."

chemicalreactiongifs,387ybq,MarkusGordathian,83,Tue Jun 2 15:07:20 2015 UTC,"The water sinks to the bottom of the oil because it is more dense. After that, it instantly boils, causing the water to push the oil out of the pot in the violent explosion."
chemicalreactiongifs,387ybq,waxxor,49,Tue Jun 2 15:09:58 2015 UTC,"When you pour water onto an oil fire the water almost instantly boils.  Since water and oil don't mix the force from the boiling water expels oil into an almost aerosol like vapor or small oil droplets.  Once that happens the oil fire has a lot more surface area to work on instead of the fire occurring and somewhat contained just at the top layer of oil in the pan, it creates a huge combustion.  In 5 year old terms, the water boils and explodes all of the flaming oil everywhere."
chemicalreactiongifs,387ybq,Batnu,15,Tue Jun 2 15:11:54 2015 UTC,Very interesting. Could you please tell me now the best way to put out an oil fire? Assuming you don't have a fire extinguisher at hand.
chemicalreactiongifs,387ybq,waxxor,24,Tue Jun 2 15:18:26 2015 UTC,"Put a thick towel over it, starve it of oxygen like snuffing out a candle.  I think baking soda works too if you dump it on top.  EDIT: Oh and make sure to turn the heat off and leave the towel on for a little bit to let the oil cool off.  If you take the towel off too early and don't let the oil cool it may just burst back into flames once you remove the towel."

chemicalreactiongifs,387ybq,Brocktoberfest,7,Tue Jun 2 16:19:18 2015 UTC,"If you HAD to use the towel method, yes, use a damp (NOT WET) towel.  It has less to do with temperature and more to do with the fact that a wet towel is less flammable than a dry one.  See my comment above, though.  A towel should not be your first choice."
chemicalreactiongifs,387ybq,waxxor,7,Tue Jun 2 17:52:42 2015 UTC,"I can't tell if you're joking but no...no.  You don't want to risk any water dripping into the pan even if it's covered.  The primary purpose of covering the pan with the towel and the mechanism behind extinguishing the fire is starveing it of oxygen, not cool it down.  As long as you turn the heat off and CAREFULLY move it off the hot burner the oil will cool on its own."
chemicalreactiongifs,387ybq,SmashMetal,3,Tue Jun 2 16:22:24 2015 UTC,Huh. I genuinely would have thought that a wet towel would help. Guess it's lucky I've never been in this situation before!

chemicalreactiongifs,387ybq,Brocktoberfest,5,Tue Jun 2 23:22:01 2015 UTC,"The best method would be to place something non-flammable over the pot.  The lid would be the best choice.  If you don't have a lid for the pot, a sheet pan or something similar would work.  Baking soda is also a good option--especially for small amounts of oil in, say, a pan rather than a pot.  If you had a TON of salt, that would work too.  DO NOT use flour or sugar or cornstarch or any other organic (in the chemical sense) powders.  The towel method is probably the last method you would want to try to extinguish a grease fire, but if you had to use it, I would definitely use a damp towel over a dry one.  A dry one will catch fire immediately.  A damp one (NOT SOAKING WET) will be more flame retardant and most water will be released as steam, rather than dripping into the oil.  First things first, though, TURN OFF THE HEAT SOURCE AND DO NOT DUMP, SPILL, OR SLOSH THE POT OR PAN.     Source:  Laboratory safety specialist, former organic/analytical chemistry laboratory manager, and part-time caterer.     Edit:  source"

Of course, these days there is a fire extinguisher right next to them, so that is the better option.  Old old fire blankets were made out if asbestos.  More modern ones can be synthetic non-flammable materials like kevlar or heavy wool (like the ones I have worked around), generally treated with a chemical retardant.  They wouldn't be my first choice, but could be really effective in a stop, drop, and roll situation."
chemicalreactiongifs,387ybq,SockPants,3,Tue Jun 2 23:28:48 2015 UTC,It seems like in a kitchen fire the force from an extinguisher might just blow all the fuel all over the place and you would rather use a blanket though.
chemicalreactiongifs,387ybq,Brocktoberfest,2,Wed Jun 3 05:21:17 2015 UTC,"Nah.  Unless you are using it point-blank, a fire extinguisher doesn't really blow anything anywhere.  6 feet is a good distance to shoot from; you will have a nice full, well-focused cloud of powder or carbon dioxide."
chemicalreactiongifs,387ybq,LeJoker,5,Wed Jun 3 05:30:21 2015 UTC,Everyone here is saying to use a towel but the first thing you should look for is the lid that goes to that pan or pot. A towel is good but you run the risk of the towel igniting as well and then everything is just so much worse.

chemicalreactiongifs,37vo8m,smus0025,5,Sun May 31 12:12:14 2015 UTC,"Francium:       Francium is a chemical element with symbol Fr and atomic number 87. It was formerly known as eka-caesium and actinium K.  It is one of the two least electronegative elements, the other being caesium. Francium is a highly radioactive metal that decays into astatine, radium, and radon. As an alkali metal, it has one valence electron.  Bulk francium has never been viewed. Because of the general appearance of the other elements in its periodic table column, it is assumed that francium would appear as a highly reflective metal, if enough could be collected together to be viewed as a bulk solid or liquid. Obtaining such a sample is highly improbable, since the extreme heat of decay (the half-life of its longest-lived isotope is only 22 minutes) would immediately vaporize any viewable quantity of the element.  Francium was discovered by Marguerite Perey in France (from which the element takes its name) in 1939. It was the last element first discovered in nature, rather than by synthesis.  Outside the laboratory, francium is extremely rare, with trace amounts found in uranium and thorium ores, where the isotope francium-223 continually forms and decays. As little as 20–30 g (one ounce) exists at any given time throughout the Earth's crust; the other isotopes (except for francium-221) are entirely synthetic. The largest amount produced in the laboratory was a cluster of more than 300,000 atoms.     Image i - Marguerite Perey, the discoverer of Francium.

chemicalreactiongifs,37vo8m,slutforbrains,2,Sat May 30 23:44:38 2015 UTC,Why does the water turn purple? I googled Phenolphtalien but it doesn't really say WHY it turns purple. ELI5?
chemicalreactiongifs,37vo8m,Rayat,5,Sun May 31 00:34:44 2015 UTC,"Not really ELI5, High School Chemistry required:  So the reaction between Water and any Alkai Metal proceeds roughly:  2A(s) + 2(H2O)(l) --> H2(g) + 2(AOH)(aq)  where A is any of the alkai metal.In this case:  2Na(s) + 2(H2O)(l) --> H2(g) + 2(NaOH)(aq)  You note that the NaOH is aqueus in this reaction, meaning it is dissolved. There are no NaOH molecules floating around in the water its really two ions, a positive Na+ and a negative OH-. Now you know there are things called Acids and bases. They are determined by the number of H+ ions or OH- ions floating around in water. If there are more H+ ions than OH- it is acidic and if there are more OH- than H+ it is basic. Normally acids are clear and look just like water, however when an indicator like phenolphthalein is added they change colours.   In short: Adding sodium releases OH- ions into the water making it more basic. There is also a dye in the water that changes colours when the water becomes more basic. So the extra OH- ions turn it purple.  (I'm aware there are slightly more complicated mechanisms in action here, but this is a simple version that's not really wrong)"
chemicalreactiongifs,37vo8m,laybros,1 point,Sun May 31 01:21:34 2015 UTC,"Changing the pH changes the Phenolphtalein, it loses a proton and changes colors. The water changes pH because sodium reacts with it, making NaOH, which is basic.  I don't quite remember exactly why Phenolphtalein changes colors, but I think it has to do with electron resonance."
chemicalreactiongifs,37vo8m,devotedpupa,1 point,Sun May 31 01:32:53 2015 UTC,"In addition to what the others said, phenolphthalein undergoes similar changes in concentration as its equilibrium shifts (due to Lechatlier's principle). It shifts between oxidation states (like how sodium loses an electron to become Na+), and each ion has a different electron configuration, which is kind of like how the electrons are arranged around the nucleus. When light strikes these electrons, the extra energy ""promotes"" electrons further away, repelling against the nucleus. When they move back to the normal state, they release energy in the form of photons, whose wavelength depends on the drop ""distance"" so to speak. With different electron configurations between the two forms of phenolphthalein, the jump produces one in the non-visible spectrum vs the pink one you see in the reaction. This is easier to understand with single atoms, whose electron arrangements can be simplified with the orbital diagrams you probably learned about in high school chem."

Just make sure your university has a focus on electro-mechanical systems (also known as mechatronics).

There's too much other material to cover to go into circuit building in depth, and at higher levels (electromag 301, for instance) you'll be taught more about the propagation of EM fields in a general sense, than the actual stuff you need to know to build a complex circuit.

Air has a breakdown voltage of about 3 MV/m and let's assume you need about 150 amps and the tank is about 3.3 meters away (10MV needed).

chemicalreactiongifs,37r2ef,Ramipro,1 point,Fri May 29 22:23:40 2015 UTC,"Kind of, but not exactly. Ion propulsion uses atoms, bombards them with electrons and ionizes them, and accelerates the ions through an electrical field.  My first thought is that, in the video, the main propulsion is not due to the electrons themselves, but from the expansion of the gases due to Joule heating. The air near the tip expands and pushes it in the other direction. We'd have to test it in a vacuum, to have a conclusion, though, but I'd be surprised if it worked."
chemicalreactiongifs,37r2ef,t3hmau5,3,Fri May 29 22:24:07 2015 UTC,"I believe the spinning is caused by induction rather than the description given, which is a force caused by the arcing into the air.

chemicalreactiongifs,37r2ef,oldworldavacado,62,Sat May 30 01:11:41 2015 UTC,"Specifically, whether the cross-product of the current vector and field vector is positive or negative. If you're familiar with the ""right hand rule,"" it's that.  Here's a good link with diagrams and such  http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/magnetic/magmom.html  Since the current goes from + to - on both sides of the wire--and the field from the magnet at each segment points in a different direction--there's a torque.  It's also important/cool to note that the force here is coming from the magnet acting on the bottom two segments of wire ONLY--the side and top segments, surprising as it is, experience NO (external) force (this makes sense if you think about what the field lines of a normal bar magnet look like; there's no way the field interacts with the top and side segments appreciably).  And if you want another way to think about why there isn't an actual force on the side segments, you can do a right hand rule on them and find that a torque-producing B-field on the sides would have to point out radially from the battery, and there's nothing in that system to produce a radial B-field like that (or in any normal system, really).  Also, the currents in all segments do produce B-fields, but nothing comparable to the bar magnet, and besides the directions wouldn't produce any torque. Looking up how currents make B-fields and then twisting your right hand around in weird positions for 5 minutes will show this to be an impossibility  ;)"

chemicalreactiongifs,37r2ef,Mknowl,-1,Fri May 29 20:11:29 2015 UTC,the field that we define is determined by the right hand rule and the the cross product of that vector along with the current vector is what gives the force applied. If we adopted the left hand convention the the field would be defined in the opposite direction (experimentally this is identical) but we would redefine how we do vector cross products which is inherent to how we label Cartesians and so the cross product would show the force applied would be the same.  If you're interested (im still a bit rusty but grappled with this enough in undergrad that some of it stuck l look up the Biot-Savart Law) and try to work through the understanding of how we define fields.

Basically, the energy output would be equal to the input, minus losses.  If you used an electric motor to power an electric generator, you would end up with a slightly net loss. It is done some places though.  In the navy, we had motor generators.  One end was ac and the other end was dc.  It basically transferred ac power to the dc system, or dc power to the ac system.  Actual production was accomplished with steam turbine generators.  EDIT:  I forgot to mention some things.  For those of you who don't know, a generator and a motor are practically the same thing.  I'll leave it at that, as I really couldn't explain it well enough for the layman, so you might as well research some on your own.  It can be pretty simple to very complicated.

All that it is is a some magnets around the outside (usually outside) of a coil of copper wire. This coil is attached to an axle such that it spins and is attached to wires. It is possible to mount the magnets on the axle inside a stationary copper coil but that's not the usual way of doing it.   Spin the axle and electromagnetic induction in the copper coil gives you electricity. Push a current through the coil and electromagnetic forces (between the magnetic field from the magnets and the magnetic field from the current) spins the coil around giving you a motor.

The details are actually sort of more complicated than this, because you actually have two different current loops with area vectors pointing in different directions.   Basically, if you took away one side of the loop, it wouldn't work--they're sort of mirror images of each other (hey, parity!) so it allows for the rotation.  Source: Just got my Physics B.S. This will be my life now."
chemicalreactiongifs,37r2ef,oldworldavacado,1 point,Sat May 30 03:21:51 2015 UTC,"Congrats on the Physics B.S.! I just finished a year of undergrad physics and I am trying to wrap my head around what's going on in this gif. Can you please elaborate on what the magnetic field generated by the magnet looks like? To me, it seems like the current loops are parallel to the B-field so they shouldn't experience torque."
chemicalreactiongifs,37r2ef,Hesione,2,Fri May 29 20:39:41 2015 UTC,"Well thank you! It wasn't easy, I'll tell ya that--but totally worth it. Learned a lot of crazy, amazing stuff that really changed how I looked at the world.  Okay, so let's give this a shot. I'm just a recent graduate, not a professor or anything, so I'll do my best. Let me know if there's anything you don't understand and I'll be happy to elaborate--in fact, it'll help me prepare for when I go to grad school ;)   THE PHYSICS  So you're totally right about being confused--I was actually confused for a few minutes too, because like you said, the current loops on the side-segments shouldn't experience torque. I did my right hand rule and was like ""wait a second, how could that magnet be producing the field necessary for the torque?"" Because, as it sounds like you've already discovered, that B-field necessary to create torque on the side segments would be a radial B-field--which is impossible.  In another post somewhere on this thread I explain the conundrum in some detail, but I'll give an explanation here:  The magnetic field only exists within the vicinity of the applied magnet--that is, the bar magnet at the negative end of the battery. While there are some small B-fields from the currents, they're not very comparable in magnitude to this magnet.  So what is really going on is that this magnetic field from the bar magnet is producing a B-field in the, let's say, z-axis, which is perpendicular to the table in the negative direction. Notice that this is local to the region where the magnet is--the field does NOT extend to the side and top segments of the wires. The side and top segments experience no B-field from the magnet--it is too far away!  Okay, so now do a right hand rule with the current from the bottom segments ONLY of the loop, which are the only segments actually in the B-field. You'll see then for these segments that there is a force that induces rotation.  I hope this helps. The basic idea is that only the bottom segments feel a force from the magnet, not the side and top segments. So if you apply physics to only those bottom segments, it makes sense.   The key is that the magnetic field around that external magnet is local, and doesn't actually extend to those other segments. The rotation comes from force acting on the bottom segments only."
chemicalreactiongifs,37r2ef,oldworldavacado,1 point,Sat May 30 02:49:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply! We did learn about force on a current carrying wire perpendicular to a magnetic field, but when we learned about torque it was only for current loops, so I didn't realize a B-field could cause torque in a straight current carrying wire too.   And please correct me if I'm wrong: although the copper wires extend past the negative terminal of the battery, those sections of wire are not carrying current and not part of the circuit. So there is no occurrence of parallel wires exerting forces on each other?"
chemicalreactiongifs,37r2ef,kcripe,1 point,Sat May 30 03:35:51 2015 UTC,"You're right, a straight wire with current on its own would not experience torque. It's the fact that the wire is essentially ""tethered"" to the battery, so the force that would usually just be a constant acceleration now leads to circular motion (like a propeller, sort of).   However, there is current passing through the entire wire--how would electrons get to the positive terminal? There are ""two"" currents that are mirror opposites.  So there is some B-field from the current in these segments, but it's not significant."
chemicalreactiongifs,37r2ef,autowikibot,2,Sat May 30 18:19:59 2015 UTC,"This is what's known as a homopolar motor. Basically anything that conducts electricity and moves through a magnetic field will experience a force known as the Lorentz force. The battery provides a DC current through the negative terminal and into the permanent magnet, where the conducting wire makes contact and completes the circuit to the positive battery terminal. According to the right hand rule (or more specifically the Biot-Savart and Amperes laws), the current flowing through the wire creates a magnetic field which opposes the one produced by the permanent magnet. This results in a spinning wire.   http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homopolar_motor"

The resulting EMF (Electromotive Force) being continuous in one direction, the homopolar motor needs no commutator but still requires slip rings.  The name homopolar indicates that the electrical polarity of the conductor and the magnetic field poles do not change (i.e., that it does not require commutation).

There is an electric current flowing through the wire. This generates a magnetic field around the wire. This interacts with the magnetic field from the magnets and produces a force, since the wire is light and free to move, it spins.   Interestingly, it will always spin that direction with the magnets stacked in that arrangement (if you stop it spinning it wil start again as soon as you let go). Turn the magnet or battery over and it should spin the other way I think. It would eventually stop when the battery runs out of juice, but its not using much energy.

chemicalreactiongifs,37lx84,SoSaysCory,14,Fri May 29 07:59:38 2015 UTC,"He/she's comparing the amount of energy released in the two reactions.  The first one is the combination of magnesium (the metal) and oxygen, what you would get if you just burned the metal out in the open.  The second is reacting the metal with carbon dioxide, which the block is made of.  Once you have the equations written out and balanced you can calculate the energy released or absorbed (the enthalpy, or ΔH) using reactions from standard enthalpies of formation and Hess's Law.  A more negative ΔH means more energy is released, so the reaction with carbon dioxide releases a bit more energy per magnesium atom.  Like stahlous said though, the extra brightness probably isn't from more energy being released, but because of other effects like a faster reaction rate and optical effects. Chemistry is awesome!"

I chose high school, as I'm planning on studying further than that. Now, when we start high school, we're given freedom of choice on what we want to study, and how in-depth we want to study said subject (if you, for some odd reason, hated physics, you would only study the one mandatory course of it and that's it).  For an example, mathematics is divided into two separate ""routes""; the long (more advanced) and the short (basics) mathematics.   Physics and chemistry both have one mandatory course and multiple in-depth courses (all subjects are divided into courses, with both mandatory and the in-depth courses).  Physics has eight national* in-depth courses, and schools can create their own courses if they want to. Chemistry has 4 in-depth courses: ""The micro-world of chemistry"", ""Reactions & energy"", ""Metals & materials"" and ""Reactions & balance"".  *National means, that the contents of the courses can be in our finals, which are held twice a year; in spring and autumn."

Here in the US, the College Board offers AP exams that can be taken for course credit at many colleges and universities to ""place out"" of entry level classes and have more time to take upper level courses, provided that you score well enough on the AP exam. There are courses given in high school denoted as AP to prepare for the exams. For the sciences, at least at my high school, they require the mandatory first year of the subject before taking the AP course. I took AP biology, chemistry, and physics as well as calculus I and II. Many colleges have placed a limit on the number of courses you can skip with AP credit. I think Emory's limit was 16 credit hours. By taking 6 year-long science classes in high school instead of the required 3, I was able to take 18 science classes during my 4 years at Emory. The problem here is that our education system has lowered the standards to accommodate the lowest end of the school-smarts spectrum so that everyone ""passes"".

chemicalreactiongifs,37lx84,autowikibot,2,Wed Jun 24 08:23:46 2015 UTC,The letters ‘MIG’ stand for ‘Metal Inert Gas’. See GMAW.
chemicalreactiongifs,37lx84,maxattack222,1 point,Fri May 29 00:17:55 2015 UTC,"Gas metal arc welding:       Gas metal arc welding (GMAW), sometimes referred to by its subtypes metal inert gas (MIG) welding or metal active gas (MAG) welding, is a welding process in which an electric arc forms between a consumable wire electrode and the workpiece metal(s), which heats the workpiece metal(s), causing them to melt, and join.  Along with the wire electrode, a shielding gas feeds through the welding gun, which shields the process from contaminants in the air. The process can be semi-automatic or automatic. A constant voltage, direct current power source is most commonly used with GMAW, but constant current systems, as well as alternating current, can be used. There are four primary methods of metal transfer in GMAW, called globular, short-circuiting, spray, and pulsed-spray, each of which has distinct properties and corresponding advantages and limitations.  Originally developed for welding aluminum and other non-ferrous materials in the 1940s, GMAW was soon applied to steels because it provided faster welding time compared to other welding processes. The cost of inert gas limited its use in steels until several years later, when the use of semi-inert gases such as carbon dioxide became common. Further developments during the 1950s and 1960s gave the process more versatility and as a result, it became a highly used industrial process. Today, GMAW is the most common industrial welding process, preferred for its versatility, speed and the relative ease of adapting the process to robotic automation. Unlike welding processes that do not employ a shielding gas, such as shielded metal arc welding, it is rarely used outdoors or in other areas of air volatility. A related process, flux cored arc welding, often does not use a shielding gas, but instead employs an electrode wire that is hollow and filled with flux.

Allow me to explain   Fire requires 3 elements - heat, fuel and oxygen (or other oxidizer). Remove any 1 and the fire goes out but any quality fire supression method removes at least 2. Typically the oxygen is separated from the fuel and heat is removed but there are special fire extinguishers for highly reactive fuels like metals.   Pouring water on a non-grease fire absorbs heat through the formation of steam and this separates the fuel from the oxygen.  CO2 fire extinguishers shoot out cold CO2 that absorbs heat and separates the fuel from oxygen.   Baking soda is a fancy name for sodium bicarbonate that floats on top of the oil (or other fuel) separating it from the oxygen. If the fire is hot enough, the baking soda can decompose to release CO2. It absorbs heat to do so.   The reason water doesn't work for grease fires is due to it's density. The water sinks below the grease so it doesn't separate it from the oxygen in the air. It still absorbs heat though and becomes steam. Since it has nowhere to expand but into the oil, it causes the oil explosion on the original post. This is highly dangerous and I have scars on my shin from over a decade ago when I did just this as a 12 year old. Very painful experience and I highly recommend against it."

If you don't have a lid, use a wet towel, or apparently baking soda / sodium bicarbonate.   The baking soda floats on the oil and cuts off the oxygen supply.

Material starts to glow around 1000-1100 °F  - visibility depends on ambient lighting and how sharp your eyes are Around 1400-1500 °C (note unit change) stuff glows bright enough that it's painful to look at Steel melts at 1540 °C, or slightly higher or much lower depending on alloys. Will be a bright orange, almost yellowish at this temp   Of course, the metal will radiate light at all wavelengths (ie, all colors).  Just much more so in the yellow/orange range so it looks yellow/orange.  In the case in the video, it's getting pumped with more light than it could ever radiate, so it reflects what's being pumped at it (white light with a little more yellow than other colors).  This thing would glow like a motherfucker. They are using some sort of filter lens because if they didn't, you'd just see a brilliant blinding white light that would bloom out any normal camera."

chemicalreactiongifs,378r4f,dicknuckle,35,Mon May 25 23:38:34 2015 UTC,"They did this myth twice.  First time was a bust.  Then a university group posted a video showing that they did it with a ton of mirrors on stands. So the mythbusters revisited it, changing the university's experiment to use period accurate mirrors.  Using brass instead of modern day perfect mirrors, they couldn't reflect nearly enough light to get it to work. The other important thing to consider is the size:  The myth was about a death ray lighting ships on fire, so those were the conditions they were trying to test.  This example is about a very small focus that is close to the mirrors."

(Steel melts at around 2500 degrees Fahrenheit) Molten steel glows. Hell, steel that is anywhere near molten glows, that didn't. It looked like molten aluminum to me (I actually work at an aluminum foundry and see molten aluminum on an almost daily basis), but that would still require them to get it to over 1000 degrees so I still doubt it.

chemicalreactiongifs,378r4f,LinearFluid,2,Mon May 25 23:19:59 2015 UTC,The designed that is used here is a bunch of small mirrors precisely placed on a parabolic dish. This Mythbusters never used this concept. they tried large mirrors individually focused which was ineffective.  watch this video.  A teenager was able to make this.  The idea is to concentrate in the smallest point.  Mythbusters mirrors were too big and did not concentrate enough.  In the Youtube video of the R5800 they use small flat mirrors which create a finer point of light by mounting Many (5800) on a parabolic surface.  IN the Gif they use a combination of less but larger mirrors that are instead of being flat have a Parabolic curved on a larger parabolic surface to get that much finer tuning of the light into a concentrated point.  5800 mirrors reflecting one inch of light in the same place means you are overlapping the light and power 5800 times.  Mythbusters used a couple hundred mirrors that if they were 1 foot by one foot they would shine a beam of 1 foot light in size in one spot using only a couple hundred they only overlaped the power by that amount.  The gist is that both the mirror shape and size and or the surface they are mounted on needs to be parabolic to concentrate the light.  The amount of mirrors needed to create greater heat is proportional to the size of the mirror.  The larger the mirror the more mirrors you need to concentrate the same amount of energy  To use a beam effectively requires a certain size mirror to number used to get the right amount of heat to do what you want you have to overcome the pieces heatsink property of dissipating heat faster than you are putting it on the spot you want to melt or burn. The difference is surface area of the point of light. Smaller Mirrors will make a smaller point of light. The advantage is you can on a parabolic surface overlap these mirrors using more mirrors in a smaller area.  Disadvantage is the point of light is the area that will heat up. So if you are able to put 5800 small 1 inch mirrors on a parabolic and you end up with no error and perfect alignment a beam that is 1 inch wide. So then the material you are trying to melt/set on fire has to be compatible.  By compatible I mean not dissipate the heat away from the centered beam faster than the beam can replenish it.  So smaller arrays can produce higher power but focused over a smaller area. it will only melt the area the size of the beam and if it is thicker or say definitely a metal like Aluminum it will heat sink the heat away from the beam and not melt anything just warm up the piece.  This is also why in the original GIF the beam put a hole through it. the hole is the size of the light beam. If the piece of metal was larger or thicker the heat sink properties to dissipate the heat might not of been able to be overcome and not much would of happened.

A cathode is mounted to the inside of the anodizing tank; the titanium acts as an anode, so that oxygen ions are released from the electrolyte to combine with the titanium atoms at the surface of the part being anodized. Anodizing is, therefore, a matter of highly controlled oxidation—the enhancement of a naturally occurring phenomenon."

chemicalreactiongifs,372v0l,arcedup,4,Thu May 28 22:05:02 2015 UTC,"We use calcium carbide as a deoxidant in steelmaking. Products of reaction are CO2 and quicklime (which is beneficial to our refractory bricks lining our steel vessels, or ladles as we call them) and we get to recover FeO and MnO that may have oxidised and be sitting in the slag.  After one down day, we'd put in some wooden reels with scrap wire rope on them into our arc furnace, and we had to set the reels on fire as the took up too much space. Normally this was done by throwing some diesel over the reels and the furnace, and the remaining heat of the refractory caused the diesel to ignite. This time, the furnace was just too cold to light off the diesel, so my crew grabbed a bag of carbide (which I didn't see at first), threw it into the furnace and then set the firehose on it.  As I said, I didn't see the bag of carbide go in, so I was extremely puzzled and worried by the firehose being turned on the furnace, as water on our MgO/CaO refractories causes them to hydrate to Mg(OH)2/Ca(OH)2 and effectively turn to mud. Of course, once the carbide had produced enough acetylene to ignite, I quickly realised what they'd done as they amused themselves by controlling the reaction with the firehose: the more water they put on, the fiercer the flames."

This residual energy, much of it stored in the barrel inductance, can be close to 50% of the initially stored energy. This is the result of significant current flowing in the projectile armature when the projectile exits the barrel. Muzzle shunts are designed to manage this residual current and energy, and as a result reduce or eliminate muzzle flash."

chemicalreactiongifs,36y22d,Iamgoingtooffendyou,4,Sat May 23 19:47:47 2015 UTC,"Ok   How do crystals form  and how do they grow?  Crystals start growing by a process called ""nucleation"". Nucleation can either start with the molecules themselves (we'll call this unassisted nucleation), or with the help of some solid matter already in the solution (we'll call this assisted nucleation).  Unassisted nucleation  When molecules of the ""solute"" (the stuff of which you want to grow crystals) are in solution, most of the time they see only solvent molecules around them. However, occasionally they see other solute molecules. If the compound is a solid when it is pure, there will be some attractive force between these solute molecules. Most of the time when these solute molecules meet they will stay together for a little while, but then other forces eventually pull them apart. Sometimes though, the two molecules stay together long enough to meet up with a third, and then a fourth (and fifth, etc.) solute molecule.  Most of the time when there are just a few molecules joined together, they break apart. However, once there becomes a certain number of solute molecules, a so-called ""critical size"" where the combined attractive forces between the solute molecules become stronger than the other forces in the solution which tend to disrupt the formation of these ""aggregates"". This when this ""protocrystal"" (a sort of pre-crystal) becomes a nucleation site. As this protocrystal floats around in solution, it encounters other solute molecules. These solute molecules feel the attractive force of the protocrystal and join in. That's how the crystal begins to grow.  It continues growing until eventually, it can no longer remain ""dissolved"" in the solution and it falls out (as chemists like to say) of solution. Now other solute molecules begin growing on the surface of the crystal and it keeps on getting bigger until there is an equilibrium reached between the solute molecules in the crystal and those still dissolved in the solvent.     http://www.chemistry.co.nz/crystals_forming.htm  Now, have you heard of capillary action? It's a process where liquid will move against gravity. It just so happens that the nature of some crystal shapes results in upward moving structures, which evaporate on the exterior and are pushed out by the crystal formation that is growing in the semi-fluid interior."

I've seen plenty of videos of crystals being formed in a liquid and that makes enough sense to me but how does all the matter get to the top of the formation in this case?  It's not growing from the bottom obviously as they seem to grow like a tree. Any answer to this would be much appreciated.

chemicalreactiongifs,36y22d,Piscataquog,2,Sat May 23 09:37:38 2015 UTC,"The solution is much darker than the solid as you can see, the stalks growing up from the edges remain dark as they still contain a lot of water, the ions forming the crystals can reenter solution slowly to change shape if it's more energetically favourable to do so, they don't for the most part grow at their the bottom or the tips but below the surface, pushing the drier parts out, but then the liquid follows (osmosis) and they can redissolve.  And of course it starts at the edges first because the solution is thinner there, so evaporation effects it much quicker, making it exceed saturation.  I dont think you have done ""some studies on crystal formations"" at all."

It would be cool even to point a macro lens at one of those branches and do a close zoom timelapse on it growing.  I have a serious question though: How is it that the crystals seem to grow like that outside of the dish? When you look at those little branches, you see that stuff grows on top of them, not like it's being pushed out from the solution. How can that be? That would imply that the compound somehow travels along the branch and crystal deposits on top. But there is no way for that to happen that I can think of. In biological systems the cells would transport nutrients etc. and form more cells on top so that it grows but how does it happen here?"

chemicalreactiongifs,36nde2,JonnyShips,-15,Thu May 21 00:02:42 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Everything I read about ""Curing Cancer"" doesn't make sense to me. Cancer is not a disease. Technically, there's nothing to distinguish cancer cells from normal healthy cells aside from the fact that cancer cells don't have a ""stop multiplying"" switch.  When we're able to ""cure cancer"", we'll also be able to change other cells as well (essentially any cellular defect would be erasable)."
chemicalreactiongifs,36nde2,mcac,12,Wed May 20 20:04:40 2015 UTC,Technically there are many ways to distinguish cancer cells from non-cancerous ones. Histological analysis has been used for decades to identify cancerous tissues. Staining cells for irregular expression of protein is a very common way to identify cancer cells. Genetic analysis of a cell can reveal mutations which are known to transform (make cancerous) cells. And a plethora of other ways and minor variations depending on tissue and cell type as well as what kind of cancer.  source: I am a cancer researcher. Edit: added some examples.

chemicalreactiongifs,36nde2,SingleLensReflex,2,Thu May 21 13:06:56 2015 UTC,I've had two cancers - both are cured.  So...it's a disease.
chemicalreactiongifs,36nde2,DarkPatriot,-9,Wed May 20 22:46:31 2015 UTC,"But cancer cells have your DNA. And technically you'd be in remission.  In order to kill cancer cells, the current strategy is to pump a human being with enough poison (chemo) under the idea that cancer cells are weaker than healthy cells.  Chemo kills a LOT more than cancer cells.  If you want an agriculrure comparison, its like having weeds in your lawn and then burning your lawn in hopes of getting the weeds."

chemicalreactiongifs,36nde2,riveronlan,15,Thu May 21 06:52:41 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I'm understanding the process here.   Cytotoxic T cells release perforin which pokes holes in the cancer cell's membrane which leads to lysis. Is this animation showing a different process?
chemicalreactiongifs,36nde2,NewbornMuse,9,Wed May 20 19:41:39 2015 UTC,"Actually this is showing the first step in cytolysis during which a CD8 T cell will look for particular surface markers on the cell to decide if it is infected with a virus, if it is a transformed or cancerous cell, or if it is a normal cell. If it is infected or cancerous, certain signals will be changed or missing and the T cell will release perforin. Watch the source video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntk8XsxVDi0"

chemicalreactiongifs,36nde2,salsawillsuffice,18,Wed May 20 19:50:39 2015 UTC,"It's not a stupid question, but the process is complicated. I'm not an expert so keep that in mind.   Cancerous cells are often recognized by our immune system, targeted and destroyed. This process actually occurs all the time. The immune system must recognize the cancerous cell as non-self, meaning that it must appear foreign.   Unfortunately in some cases the cancer cell expresses surface proteins that identify as normal host cell, or self. When this occurs the immune cells ignore the cancerous cells and allow them to grow as if they were healthy, innocuous cells.   When immune cells attack healthy cells autoimmune disorders occur.   Essentially, the cancerous cells can be camouflaged from the immune cells. There is effort being made in research to create markers which bind to cancerous cells and help the immune cells better identify the cancer. Without a means for the immune system to identify the cancerous cells, increasing immune cells would have no real benefit."

chemicalreactiongifs,36nde2,fddfgs,3,Wed May 20 20:35:15 2015 UTC,Well I don't know anything about nano-machines but the difficulty lies within the identification of the cancer cells. If we can mark cancerous cells as abnormal/foreign then the immune system should be an ample means of response.
chemicalreactiongifs,36nde2,Its43,3,Wed May 20 21:05:32 2015 UTC,People are kind of doing this already. Nanoparticles (not machines sorry) are being designed that will specifically target and bind tumor cells to deliver drugs to them.

chemicalreactiongifs,36nde2,cadex,3,Wed May 20 22:40:18 2015 UTC,"This is beautiful, but I have to correct the title, this is not a killer T cell killing a cancer cell. This is a CD4+ T cell forming an immunological synapse with an OVA-pulsed EL4 target cell. EL4 cells are lymphoma cells, which is a type of cancer, but they are just a cell line used as a model for B cells (because they are B cell derived). Immunological synapses are transient cell-cell contacts formed between antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as B cells (the blue cell), and CD4+ T helper cells (the red cell), during which the APC presents something it saw previously to the T cell to activate it and stimulate it to expand and go on and activate other cells, including cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. The immunological synapse is how different lymphocytes can communicate with each other about the state of the immune system and facilitate rapid responses to pathogens or other abnormal situations."

I've never witnessed it, but I've heard a lot of stories about it sparking during weighing or catching fire after solvent evaporates from the catalyst. For this reason it is often sold wet. I think it's a particular problem after the catalyst has been used for a hydrogenation, so it might be the oxidation of adsorbed compounds generating much of the heat.

chemicalreactiongifs,368s62,quadrapod,2,Sun May 17 19:42:45 2015 UTC,"Finely divided is a kind of strange term because it also applies to things which ignite during machining.  An example is uranium, uranium will just sit there being a plain boring brittle grey metal.  When machined though it's swarf (turnings, filings, and shavings) can spontaneously ignite.   Most of these yes, require more than just machining to become reactive enough to spontaneously ignite, but I could disqualify them just based on their flame characteristics which is an easier thing to explain and prove than going through the ignition requirements of each and the type of machining that would require.   As for flint, flint can throw sparks off of iron and the like but not to that extent.  Here's a quick video of someone striking different types of quartz including flint with iron.    It doesn't really match the characteristics of what we see here, especially the dramatic sparking as it slides down the chute toward the grinding head at the beginning.  Lanthanide alloys though are well known for throwing sparks with some variants specifically designed to that end like Ferrocerium(used in welding torch and bunsen burner igniters as well as survivalist kits), and mischmetal (the metal used in lighter flints)."

chemicalreactiongifs,367bfm,LithiumEnergy,4,Sun May 17 08:38:19 2015 UTC,Remember exo and endo thermic are just  measures of energy movement. Bonds dont have to be broken or formed for energy to move.  Think of it like this. Heating something up increases its energy but that doesnt necessarily mean a reaction has occured.
chemicalreactiongifs,367bfm,tayloryeow,1 point,Sun May 17 18:32:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, duh. But no heat has been transferred externally. By the combination of these substances heat was given off. How?"
chemicalreactiongifs,367bfm,LithiumEnergy,2,Sun May 17 21:28:37 2015 UTC,"So there are two parts to any thermodynamic process.  There is the enthalpic and the entropic portions.  Though there is not a true chemical reaction going on, the process is exothermic due to the entropic change of the process.  Here we have sodium ions tightly packed within a polymer.  Sodium ions obviously repel each other, therefore to have them arranged closely together requires lots of stored energy. In other words, since the polymer has strong bonds the sodium ions are being held against their will, close to each other.  Not a pleasant situation for these ions.  Entropically it is not favorable.  Now when you introduce water these ions will absorb water due to the concentration gradient (osmosis).  This also gives the sodium ions the freedom to move.  So with this new found freedom it will repel and find the farthest corners to relieve the ionic stress.  Since it is bonded to the polymer it will pull the chains along with it until it finds its most ideal arrangement.  This relief of energy, and the pulling of the chains away from each other is releasing the energy required to put them together in the first place.  It's almost like pulling apart a web or net or idk gum.  Being that it is crosslinked the polymer chains can only be so far apart.  Without water they lay close together even though sodium repels it.  With water the net is allowed to unravel pulling apart the chains, releasing the energy.  I hope this made sense haha.  It really is a neat polymer taking advantage of some really basic chemistry.  Just so you know, this is just my best educated guess."
chemicalreactiongifs,367bfm,Mannnolo,1 point,Wed May 20 07:00:04 2015 UTC,"So the water lets the chains move about by the arrangement of the sodium ions. The pressure and volume increase, so the temperature must increase. This is also why the substance expands and come out the top of the beaker!"

chemicalreactiongifs,35y439,autowikibot,1 point,Fri May 15 03:33:31 2015 UTC,"Vapor:       In physics a vapor (American English spelling) or vapour (British) is a substance in the gas phase at a temperature lower than its critical point,  which means that the vapor can be condensed to a liquid by increasing its pressure without reducing the temperature. This visible aerosol is also commonly referred to as vapor.   For example, water has a critical temperature of 374 °C (647 K), which is the highest temperature at which liquid water can exist. In the atmosphere at ordinary temperatures, therefore, gaseous water (known as water vapor) will condense to liquid if its partial pressure is increased sufficiently.  A vapor may co-exist with a liquid (or solid). When this is true, the two phases will be in equilibrium, and the gas partial pressure will equal the equilibrium vapor pressure of the liquid (or solid).

Just get some concentrated sulfuric acid and put it in sugar and watch a column of carbon emerge. Another is the electrolysis of water. You can collect H2 and O2 in a water column. My favorite reactions are clock reactions. Look up the iodine clock reaction. You can actually tune it to go off after a certain amount of time. Also look up oscillating clock reactions.

If white tin gets cold enough it will undergo a phase change to grey tin. Once the reaction starts occurring it can actually catalyze itself, speeding up the transformation rate for the rest of the bar. For more information look into tin pest. Here's a page I pulled out of an old material science textbook about it."
chemicalreactiongifs,35s9y9,flyingtiger188,19,Wed May 13 05:05:48 2015 UTC,Is there a reason it moves from one side to the other instead of moving from the surface to the core?
chemicalreactiongifs,35s9y9,FoxtrotZero,27,Wed May 13 07:15:54 2015 UTC,"I'd assume whatever source they're using to cool it (A fan or whatever) is likely on that side, so it starts cooling that side first."
chemicalreactiongifs,35s9y9,Kairu927,9,Wed May 13 07:39:49 2015 UTC,"there might have been a slight temperature gradient and as he said, it self-catalyses so it causes a sort of chain reaction once it starts."

chemicalreactiongifs,35s9y9,Mannnolo,1 point,Wed May 13 18:03:06 2015 UTC,If it is more stable then why is white tin found at ambient temperature.  Just curious.  I'm thinking that at higher temperatures the metal ions have enough energy to support the expanded lattice.  When cooled the metal relaxes enough arrange in the tighter configuration.  I know sulfur has an allotropic transition where it expanded from alpha to beta upon heating.  It's the added heat that is required to allow for this less stable allotrope.  Similar case to the tin.

chemicalreactiongifs,35iwtv,Boonaki,24,Sun May 10 22:59:14 2015 UTC,"Aluminum is a fairly reactive metal, but we don't usually notice because it is protected by a hard layer of aluminum oxide (essentially sapphire).  This thin layer forms whenever bare aluminum is exposed to air, and protects the metal from further oxidation.  However, if you get the aluminum hot enough, it will melt, and the oxide layer will be disrupted.*  The really small aluminum particles in powder heat up easily and also have a large surface area that can react with oxygen.  As a result, aluminum powder burns very quickly in air, especially when dispersed into the air as was done in this gif.  The chemical reaction occurring is:  4Al + 3O2 ---> 2Al2O3 + lots of heat  For this reason, aluminum powder is used as a fuel in a lot of fireworks.  It was also used in the Space Shuttle solid rocket boosters and is still used in a lot of solid-fueled missiles and rocket boosters.  *You can get the same effect by exposing aluminum to a liquid metal that can alloy with it, usually mercury or gallium.  See this (sped up/time lapse) gif for example."

chemicalreactiongifs,35iwtv,pyrophorus,3,Mon May 11 01:48:38 2015 UTC,"I've bought aluminum before and I struggled to ignite it. Is the flame he is using hotter than your average blowtorch? Perhaps he ground it more finely before using it to expose ""fresh"" Al as apposed to the natural oxide layer that covers most aluminum."
chemicalreactiongifs,35iwtv,FoxtrotZero,2,Mon May 11 08:12:29 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming the aluminum was powdered?  I should have clarified that the reaction only goes quickly if both reactants - aluminum and the oxidizer - are in close contact.  The high surface area of aluminum powder helps a lot with this: most of the aluminum is near the surface where it can react with things outside the particle.  However, you won't get this ""advantage"" if the powder is compressed or in a little pile.  For fireworks, the aluminum powder is mixed thoroughly with a solid oxidizer such as potassium perchlorate.  In this gif, the demonstrator uses compressed air to blow the aluminum powder into a cloud - in other words, a good mixture of the aluminum and the oxygen in air.  This same process is actually used in some thermobaric weapons: a small explosive charge first disperses the aluminum powder and a second charge ignites it, producing a large explosion.  As for using ""fresh"" aluminum, I'm pretty sure the oxide layer forms very quickly, so it wouldn't be very practical.  This can actually be a hazard when producing very fine aluminum powder in a ball mill, since the freshly exposed aluminum (the surface area is increasing a lot) can consume all of the oxygen in the mill.  When the mill is opened, a lot of fresh aluminum is exposed to oxygen and the heat generated as the oxide layer is reformed can start a fire."
chemicalreactiongifs,35iwtv,pyrophorus,4,Mon May 11 22:25:26 2015 UTC,"Courtesy of /u/MitchB3:   This is a pretty simple reaction. It is mostly a demonstration of some of the qualities Aluminium has, which is why this is tagged as ""Chemistry"". Things tagged as ""Chemistry"" still can be chemical reactions but are more geared towards showing properties of the element. I find it interesting how bright the flame is, though that is in part due to the exposure of the camera used. But despite how brief the flame is it is impressive.   Hope. this helps"

chemicalreactiongifs,35g6h4,hellcrapdamn,52,Sun May 10 03:10:25 2015 UTC,"Create   This also apparently has a definition that I'm not familiar with. Looks more like ""adding some to a bowel of water"" to me.  This stuff is pretty neat though, it takes very little to show up in water. You could probably see just a single crystal of it in something like a shot glass. We make a product at work that uses it to detect water in gasoline. The gas won't ""activate"" the dye but any trace of water will. The stuff is so strong they were able to turn the Chicago river green with it for St. Patricks Day before the hippies environmentalists started freaking out about it. I think it's also the dye used in bubble levels. Another neat aspect is that when you're working with the dye and some goes airborn it can stick to you without you being able to see it. In the summer when I was using it and started sweating it looked like those Gatorade commercials where athletes were sweating Gatorade. The water in the shower after work would turn green as well sometimes. Or pink, another dye we used sometimes was phenolphthalein which also isn't very visible when it's dry."

chemicalreactiongifs,35g6h4,lazyfrag,3,Sun May 10 05:11:07 2015 UTC,I can't really give away the formula but the basic idea is that we have a paste that uses pigments (as opposed to dyes) for a base with a bunch of the fluorescein mixed in. The paste is a dark brown so that bright green dye shows up really well. We also have a product that does something similar but in a very different way. It's also pigmented but uses triethanolomine and phenolphthalein as an indicator. That color change is achieved due to the ph difference rather than just water activating a dye though.

chemicalreactiongifs,358qyu,luiznp,46,Fri May 8 02:46:08 2015 UTC,"Are those ""blemishes"" the different phases of steel? Like Austenite and ferrite or something? Or is that something completely different?"
chemicalreactiongifs,358qyu,toconn,41,Fri May 8 02:00:49 2015 UTC,"I'm Brazilian, so I'm not used to American steel nomenclature, but I suppose that ""mild steel"" would be low-carbon, non alloy, non treated steel. Like AISI 1045, for instance. In that case, what you see there is ferrite (lighter darker) with chunks of iron carbide pearlite (darker lighter). As far as I know, ferrite and austenite can't stably coexist since they're both allotropes of the same stuff but occur in different temperatures. You posted a relevant question and I honestly don't know why would someone downvote this."
chemicalreactiongifs,358qyu,luiznp,13,Fri May 8 02:10:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! I wasn't trying to suggest that it was austenite and ferrite coexisting, just trying to give examples of what I was talking about, it's been so long since I've taken a materials science class that those are the only phases of steel that came to mind haha! You piqued my curiosity though and I went and looked up the phase diagram of steel and ofcourse, you're absolutely right. Thanks again!"
chemicalreactiongifs,358qyu,toconn,8,Fri May 8 02:22:02 2015 UTC,"Oh, sorry about that haha. I have to correct myself tho, I meant ""chunks of pearlite"", which is actually only 11% iron carbide and 89% ferrite. Also, I think that the pearlite is the lighter one and ferrite is the darker one (since it seems like there is more of the dark). IF this is a low carbon steel (hypo-eutectoid I guess), then this is probably right. If it's a higher carbon steel, then I'm wrong anyways and I don't know what ""mild steel"" means. It's hard to tell exactly since this sample was not chemically attacked. I'm actually working on some AISI 1060 and AISI 1045 samples, as you can see the 1060 is almost all pearlite (these samples were chemically attacked, so the darker ones in the 1045 are pearlite)."
chemicalreactiongifs,358qyu,drummer1248,4,Fri May 8 02:32:45 2015 UTC,"I would imagine that you're right on this being a hypo-eutectcoid steel, although I obviously can't say that with any type of certainty.

chemicalreactiongifs,358qyu,luiznp,2,Fri May 8 02:49:25 2015 UTC,Is 316L or 904L steel superior to this steel?
chemicalreactiongifs,358qyu,drummer1248,2,Fri May 8 03:14:09 2015 UTC,"Each steel has its own applications and uses, IIRC 316L is a low-carbon ferritic stainless steel. It's not particularly hard or strong, but it is stainless, so I think this one and the 304 are used cirurgically. In the other hand, 904 is a high alloy steel. I think it might have some special applications, I never heard of it (keep in mind that there a few thousand types of steel, and I only worked with a small bunch of them)."
chemicalreactiongifs,358qyu,hanzyfranzy,2,Fri May 8 08:42:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I ask because those types of steel are used in the watchmaking industry. 316 is commonly used on both stainless steel watch cases. 904 which you mentioned is a high alloy steel and I believe high in nickel, is used almost exclusively and Rolex watch cases. The reason being supposedly is that 904 is more corrosion resistant and can take a higher shine. Thanks for answering my question in such detail."

chemicalreactiongifs,358qyu,luiznp,3,Fri May 8 07:24:25 2015 UTC,There is a series of stainless steel called duplex that has both ferrite and austenite present. I have never worked with it in respect to machining so I cannot speak for how easy it is to machine. Example would be grade 2205.
chemicalreactiongifs,358qyu,shuriken36,1 point,Fri May 8 14:52:32 2015 UTC,"Also ""high carbon austenite"" is common in high carbon steels even when they are not duplex. And cast iron can sometimes have loads of phases lined up because carbon diffuses gradually."

chemicalreactiongifs,358qyu,Manticorp,6,Fri May 8 16:07:44 2015 UTC,I think that's just the grain structure of the steel where the steel transitions from one crystal orientation to another. The only reason I'm hesitant to agree with /u/luiznp is because what he's talking about (I don't think) would cut as smoothly.
chemicalreactiongifs,358qyu,SadPenguin,1 point,Fri May 8 16:22:55 2015 UTC,oooooh this too. It all depends on carbon amount ://
chemicalreactiongifs,358qyu,Raem99,3,Fri May 8 08:58:48 2015 UTC,They may be the crystal structure of the steel.
chemicalreactiongifs,358qyu,toconn,1 point,Fri May 8 16:19:30 2015 UTC,Yes. This looks like this is a backscatter compositional view of the steel. Lighter colored areas have heavier elements in their composition than the darker areas.
chemicalreactiongifs,358qyu,erktheerk,-1,Fri May 8 06:13:34 2015 UTC,"Possibly, more likely to be the surface flaking off though. Hard to tell without knowing exactly what metal they're cutting. For all we know it could be aluminum or some exotic alloy like inconel."

You run the acrylic through a beam of electrons, and they get ""stuck"" in the plastic at some characteristic depth, creating a plane of really concentrated negative charge in the material.  Acrylic's a really good insulator, so the electrons have a hard time moving around or escaping to their surrounds (see: http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solids/band.html).  When the (grounded?) nail pierces the material near to the plane of charge, it allows an avenue for the charge immediately around the nail to escape; the relationship between voltage and current is nonlinear at high voltage, and the surrounding acrylic undergoes dielectric breakdown, effectively lowering the resistivity of the material and allowing more current to flow.  This is very similar to how electricity arcs through the air at high voltage.  At the edges of the block, the potential difference between the remaining charge and the newly formed pathways is too low to sustain the breakdown.  You could, I imagine, provoke a similar electrical breakdown by piercing the acrylic on both sides with the leads of a very, very strong power source, but the Lichtenberg figure in that case will probably not be as spectacular, as it should connect the two leads nearly directly.  It would take some doing to prevent the current from arcing through the air around the block, too.  The potential difference between the charged plane in acrylic and the surrounding air is on the order of 10 million volts, so you might need a pretty serious battery."
chemicalreactiongifs,34wujh,Yreval,3,Tue May 5 13:02:42 2015 UTC,"Electrical breakdown:       Electrical breakdown or dielectric breakdown is a rapid reduction in the resistance of an electrical insulator when the voltage applied across it exceeds the breakdown voltage. This results in a portion of the insulator becoming electrically conductive. Electrical breakdown may be a momentary event (as in an electrostatic discharge), or may lead to a continuous arc discharge if protective devices fail to interrupt the current in a high power circuit.  Under sufficient electrical stress, electrical breakdown can occur within solids, liquids, gases or vacuum. However, the specific breakdown mechanisms are significantly different for each, particularly in different kinds of dielectric medium.

chemicalreactiongifs,34phcg,Autistic_Alpaca,5,Sun May 3 18:15:11 2015 UTC,"Anodizing:       Anodizing (also spelled anodising, particularly in the UK and Australia) is an electrolytic passivation process used to increase the thickness of the natural oxide layer on the surface of metal parts.  The process is called anodizing because the part to be treated forms the anode electrode of an electrical circuit. Anodizing increases corrosion and wear resistance, and provides better adhesion for paint primers and glues than does bare metal. Anodic films can also be used for a number of cosmetic effects, either with thick porous coatings that can absorb dyes or with thin transparent coatings that add interference effects to reflected light.  Anodizing is also used to prevent galling of threaded components and to make dielectric films for electrolytic capacitors. Anodic films are most commonly applied to protect aluminium alloys, although processes also exist for titanium, zinc, magnesium, niobium, zirconium, hafnium, and tantalum. Iron or carbon steel metal exfoliates when oxidized under neutral or alkaline microelectrolytic conditions; i.e., the iron oxide (actually ferric hydroxide or hydrated iron oxide, also known as rust) forms by anoxic anodic pits and large cathodic surface, these pits concentrate anions such as sulfate and chloride accelerating the underlying metal to corrosion. Carbon flakes or nodules in iron or steel with high carbon content (high carbon steel, cast iron) may cause an electrolytic potential and interfere with coating or plating. Ferrous metals are commonly anodized electrolytically in nitric acid, or by treatment with red fuming nitric acid, to form hard black ferric oxide. This oxide remains conformal even when plated on wire and the wire is bent.    Image i - These carabiners have an anodized aluminium surface that has been dyed; they are made in many colors.

Anodic films can also be used for a number of cosmetic effects, either with thick porous coatings that can absorb dyes or with thin transparent coatings that add interference effects to reflected light.  Anodizing is also used to prevent galling of threaded components and to make dielectric films for electrolytic capacitors. Anodic films are most commonly applied to protect aluminium alloys, although processes also exist for titanium, zinc, magnesium, niobium, zirconium, hafnium, and tantalum. Iron or carbon steel metal exfoliates when oxidized under neutral or alkaline microelectrolytic conditions; i.e., the iron oxide (actually ferric hydroxide or hydrated iron oxide, also known as rust) forms by anoxic anodic pits and large cathodic surface, these pits concentrate anions such as sulfate and chloride accelerating the underlying metal to corrosion. Carbon flakes or nodules in iron or steel with high carbon content (high carbon steel, cast iron) may cause an electrolytic potential and interfere with coating or plating. Ferrous metals are commonly anodized electrolytically in nitric acid, or by treatment with red fuming nitric acid, to form hard black ferric oxide. This oxide remains conformal even when plated on wire and the wire is bent.    Image i - These carabiners have an anodized aluminium surface that has been dyed; they are made in many colors.

chemicalreactiongifs,34p3t4,MarlinMr,2,Sun May 3 23:00:48 2015 UTC,"Because you can get wet and the water falls to the floor. But if you get charged with electricity and that electricity has nowhere else to go, you stop getting ""more charged "". Basically you will only feel as much energy going through you as it can actually escape (for example through the humid air, if it's a particularly humid day) but that would be quite low, and you would feel just small tingling. Think about a piece of metal touching live current, but not touching anything else, that metal would not get hot or anything. The reason electricity electrocutes and heats up is because of the movement of electrons through a conductive body. If there's nowhere for those electrons to go, then they don't move since atoms can only hold a certain number of electrons. Hope this helps."

chemicalreactiongifs,34p3t4,Irctoaun,2,Sun May 3 09:45:20 2015 UTC,"That would make sense because the aluminium will continue to be held up so long as a current can flow through it and liquid aluminium shouldn't have any trouble conducting electricity. Once the current in the copper coil is switched off, there will be no induced current in the the aluminium so neither the original field from the coil or the field induced by the induced current in the aluminium will still be there so the aluminium falls down because it's the interaction of the two fields that keeps the aluminium up."

Except the word ""aluminum"" was created by a british man and initially used to describe the element   the earliest citation given in the Oxford English Dictionary for any word used as a name for this element is alumium, which British chemist and inventor Humphry Davy employed in 1808 for the metal he was trying to isolate electrolytically from the mineral alumina. The citation is from the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London: ""Had I been so fortunate as to have obtained more certain evidences on this subject, and to have procured the metallic substances I was in search of, I should have proposed for them the names of silicium, alumium, zirconium, and glucium.""[73][74]  Davy settled on aluminum by the time he published his 1812 book Chemical Philosophy: ""This substance appears to contain a peculiar metal, but as yet Aluminum has not been obtained in a perfectly free state, though alloys of it with other metalline substances have been procured sufficiently distinct to indicate the probable nature of alumina.""[75] But the same year, an anonymous contributor to the Quarterly Review, a British political-literary journal, in a review of Davy's book, objected to aluminum and proposed the name aluminium, ""for so we shall take the liberty of writing the word, in preference to aluminum, which has a less classical sound.""[76]"

Standard superglue can cause inflammation whereas the butyl and other medical grades are less prone to that.

It sets pretty much instantly when it comes into contact with moisture, so when gluing a wound shut, it sets pretty much straight away, same as if you accidentally superglue your fingers together."
chemicalreactiongifs,34lhda,Vitto9,52,Sat May 2 16:58:29 2015 UTC,"I've closed a wound with superglue before. It was bleeding FAR less than this simulated wound, and I still had to slow the bleeding before I could get the glue on the wound. This VetiGel was just squirted into a flood and the wound sealed completely in seconds."
chemicalreactiongifs,34lhda,DavidJMichaels,9,Sat May 2 17:22:22 2015 UTC,This exactly.  Blood will bubble through superglue before it can set.  Even a small wound won't be held shut unless its done bleeding.  This stuff looks amazing.
chemicalreactiongifs,34lhda,Zukuto,23,Sat May 2 21:16:51 2015 UTC,"the problem with superglue was many fold.  superglue made it difficult to safely open the wound and clean it. it also suffered from slow setting when glue pooled. when applied liberally it pulled skin tissue taut. for deep wounds it could not help seal due to profuse bleeding; alternatively it could close capillaries permanently. it was also slightly toxic. not to mention all the 'fun' soldiers could have with glue.  this gel overcomes all those disadvantages and has additional advantages.   it doesnt dry out at the nozzle, it can be applied liberally to a wound that goes very deep (down to an artery) and doesnt get in the blood stream. its quite cheap, and can't be used to seal up a buttcrack as part of a hazing ritual or glue someone's eyes shut."

It's still a huge improvement over Quikclot combat gauze which is what is used in the military now because that stuff is literally just chemically treated tissue that you have to pack into the wound until it stops bleeding."
chemicalreactiongifs,34lhda,quadrapod,55,Sun May 3 01:33:59 2015 UTC,Wouldn't this just cause internal bleeding that way?
chemicalreactiongifs,34lhda,NDWolfwood5268,154,Sat May 2 08:47:21 2015 UTC,"No, here's why.  Internal bleeding usually involves someone bleeding into their body cavities, if there is no cavity to bleed into then there can be no internal bleeding.  So if you cut your finger and used this substance to seal the cut the bleeding wouldn't continue internally because there is no internal body cavity to bleed into in your finger.   If you were shot through the chest or somewhere with an internal cavity you'd have internal bleeding; however that would be irrespective of whether something had been done to stop the external bleeding.  I suppose it is possible that stopping the external bleed could make the internal bleeding slightly worse, but even if that's the case it's unlikely to make it as bad as the blood loss from the wound was already.   This is especially true because most of the places where you'd get life threatening internal bleeds, namely the abdomen, chest, and brain, usually don't have the external blood flow required to be life threatening.   There isn't much blood flow outside the skull or across the skin and fascia of the abdomen or chest.   As a result if you're bleeding internally there is usually not a very large external bleed.  Likewise if you have a life threatening  external bleed there is generally no space for the bleeding to be internal, such as the neck, femoral artery, groin or the brachial arteries.    Tl;dr If you were going to have internal bleeding, you'd already have internal bleeding so there is no real way this can cause internal bleeding."
chemicalreactiongifs,34lhda,DreadPiratesRobert,14,Sat May 2 11:54:53 2015 UTC,"But this could cause blood pooling on large enough wounds, unless I'm missing something. I remember that video from /r/videos a while ago with the Russian hiker who had to drain his leg in the field.   I don't think this solution is any better or worse in that situation, but in most applications, this does seem like a huge step up. As someone terrified of needles, and thus stitches, this makes me super happy to see."

This being a science-y subreddit I's like to expand: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharin#History  Constantin Fahlberg was a chemist who spilled a beaker of liquid over his hands during work. Later when he got home, his dinner tasted incredibly sweet. So it was a serendipitous discovery rather than a taste test rack :P  EDIT: So, turns out I might be wrong, but the site in question doesn't seem to have any references, see here. Relevant paragraph:   One night that June, after a day of laboratory work, Fahlberg sat down to dinner. He picked up a roll with his hand and bit into a remarkably sweet crust. Fahlberg had literally brought his work home with him, having spilled an experimental compound over his hands earlier that day. He ran back to Remsen’s laboratory, where he tasted everything on his worktable—all the vials, beakers, and dishes he used for his experiments. Finally he found the source: an overboiled beaker in which o-sulfobenzoic acid had reacted with phosphorus (V) chloride and ammonia, producing benzoic sulfinide. Though Falhberg had previously synthesized the compound by another method, he had no reason to taste the result. Serendipity had provided him with the first commercially viable alternative to cane sugar.   Modern OHS officers would've had a fit..."

chemicalreactiongifs,34gjkf,Jungle2266,16,Fri May 1 18:52:48 2015 UTC,"Sprinkler systems are actually temperature activated, so the smoke itself wouldn't necessarily set them off unless it was enough to heat the air to a temp hot enough to break a small glass bulb inside the sprinkler head. The bulb acts as a plug, once broken it releases the water.  The bulbs are rated to break at different temps, depending the the type of materials the sprinklers are protecting. Highly flammable/combustible material = lower temp at which the bulb will bust, hopefully stopping the fire before shit starts exploding....probably more than you wanted to know about sprinklers lol"
chemicalreactiongifs,34gjkf,Mike12344321,5,Fri May 1 05:13:52 2015 UTC,I take it that's not true of all sprinkler systems though. Wasn't there a recent gif of a college professor setting off the sprinkler system in school by setting the floor on fire?

chemicalreactiongifs,34gjkf,Bluedemonfox,4,Fri May 1 13:25:52 2015 UTC,"Partially true regarding most regular sprinkler system, but the exception would be deluge systems where just activation of a smoke detector (or whatever detector being used) would activate the sprinkler system. Then again deluge systems tend to just used in very hazardous places where very fast activation is a necessity. The thing is, having a low activation temperature in a sprinkler system just isn't possible in all settings, and thus other solutions might be required (rule of thumb is highest expected ambient temperature, plus 20°C for suitable activation temperature for the bulb) (Then again sprinkler isn't necessarily the best solution depending on what requires protection)."

chemicalreactiongifs,34gjkf,CescQ,16,Fri May 1 02:23:31 2015 UTC,"From what I understand...  When the electrons in the boron atoms get excited enough (due to the application of heat [energy]), they actually go up in energy levels within the atom.  Eventually, the electrons in the boron atom will ""want"" to return their previous configuration (a lower, more stable energy level).  When this change in energy levels occurs, the electrons shed the energy required (to drop down to the lower level) as a photon.  The energy level of that photon is equal to the amount of energy the electron lost.  Our vision perceives photons at different energy levels as different colors.  The photons released by the boron atoms' electrons are traveling at the frequency which we perceive as the color green.  Someone who knows more, feel free to correct."

chemicalreactiongifs,34aywl,autowikibot,33,Wed Apr 29 18:31:08 2015 UTC,"Cavitation:       Cavitation is the formation of vapour cavities in a liquid – i.e. small liquid-cavitation-free zones (""bubbles"" or ""voids"") – that are the consequence of cavitational forces acting upon the cavitational liquid. It usually occurs when a liquid is subjected to rapid changes of pressure that cause the formation of cavities where the pressure is relatively low. When subjected to higher pressure, the voids implode and can generate an intense shockwave.  Cavitation is a significant cause of wear in some engineering contexts. Collapsing voids that implode near to a metal surface cause cyclic stress through repeated implosion. This results in surface fatigue of the metal causing a type of wear also called ""cavitation"". The most common examples of this kind of wear are to pump impellers, and bends where a sudden change in the direction of liquid occurs. Cavitation is usually divided into two classes of behavior: inertial (or transient) cavitation and non-inertial cavitation.  Inertial cavitation is the process where a void or bubble in a liquid rapidly collapses, producing a shock wave. Inertial cavitation occurs in nature in the strikes of mantis shrimps and pistol shrimps, as well as in the vascular tissues of plants. In man-made objects, it can occur in control valves, pumps, propellers and impellers.    Image i - Cavitating propeller model in a water tunnel experiment.

Don't get me wrong, I knew I was rapidly compressing the air inside the bottle, which in turns force the water into the bottom of the glass, but not all this. I guess now I can make my party trick awesome and a learning experience.  Edit - For those saying it's a dick move.   For one thing, you can do it directly into a trash can and there isn't a mess. And as far as wasting beer. I would never ever waste beer, you drink your beer and then put water in it for the trick. Also, having done it a lot, you really don't need a whole lot of liquid inside the bottle for this to work. Maybe 2 inches inside the bottle."
chemicalreactiongifs,34aywl,belhambone,12,Wed Apr 29 20:05:10 2015 UTC,That's just it you are not rapidly compressing anything. You are rapidly accelerating the bottle downward. The water doesn't get the same acceleration (you are only hitting the bottle) so a vacuum is created at the bottom due to the inertia of the water. When the vacuum collapses due to normal air pressure the force is all focused on the bottom of the bottle. The force of the collapsing vacuum is what breaks the bottle not you compressing anything.

chemicalreactiongifs,34aywl,rahlquist,12,Wed Apr 29 22:32:30 2015 UTC,"If you don't do it hard enough to break their bottle it causes the beer to foam up and overflow. Then the natural response is they put their mouth on the bottle which can also suck, because when you hit the top of their bottle you can fracture it, dropping slivers of glass into their beer."
chemicalreactiongifs,34aywl,lps2,22,Wed Apr 29 23:18:14 2015 UTC,Luckily you really only have to barely hit it if all you want is for their beer to foam up.    source : college
chemicalreactiongifs,34aywl,CoinTweak,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:49:54 2015 UTC,I think doing this with beer doesn't work because of the carbonic acid inside the drink. If you do this with beer it only makes the beer foam and overflow as you said.

chemicalreactiongifs,34aywl,ResultsMayVary4,11,Wed Apr 29 22:46:33 2015 UTC,"The bottle has to be almost full, and if you hit it with glass on glass youll probably break both bottles. It would be best just to use your hand"

chemicalreactiongifs,34aywl,therascalking13,4,Thu Apr 30 02:29:05 2015 UTC,Typically hydrogen (H2)
chemicalreactiongifs,34aywl,kabukistar,2,Thu Apr 30 02:37:36 2015 UTC,Does it come out of the water or something?
chemicalreactiongifs,34aywl,Draco6slayer,4,Thu Apr 30 02:38:38 2015 UTC,"Water doesn't exist as a pure substance. It's virtually pure, but a tiny portion of H2O dissociates into H3O and OH, while an even smaller portion dissociates into H2 and O2. I would expect that the H2 can move faster, and so it briefly separates, but I cannot say for sure.  edit:  Apparently the Keq for 2 H2O <--> H2 + O2 is 1.4e+83, meaning that the concentration of H2O at equilibrium, squared, divided by the concentration of H2 x concentration O2 is 1.4e+83. If that number is accurate, and my math is correct, you have 3e-16 molecules of H2 in a gallon of water, which suggests that my explanation is wrong. Then again, you did rapidly change the pressure, so it may not be at equilibrium. I'll cede this one to anybody who actually knows what they're talking about."

chemicalreactiongifs,34aywl,drtrobridge,2,Thu Apr 30 10:57:17 2015 UTC,Since you seem pretty smurt -  can you explain how compressible water actually is? How is that measured?   I've tried to figure that out but all I've gotten are indecipherable charts that make no sense to someone without any engineering background.
chemicalreactiongifs,34aywl,Discotechnica,17,Wed Apr 29 20:51:00 2015 UTC,"For all intents and purposes water IS incompressible.  There is likely a water bubble at the top of this container that compresses and allows water to move up, thus creating the bubbles (cavitation) at the bottom of the container.  Calculations get complicated when objects move through fluids at close to the speed of sound (jet fighters), but this is generally not done in water. At least where you or I would see it.  Since you asked, compressibility is equal to 1 / K, and K is the Bulk Modulus. Why use bulk modulus? I don't remember, it probably made sense to someone at some point and is likely more useful in that form than compressibility.  Here's some math:  K = - original volume * (change in pressure) / (change in volume)  K may also change with a number of factors (such as temperature or pressure) depending on the material, and that's why you see charts that aren't immediately intuitive. But let's ignore that. Why? Because I feel like it.  Assuming the change in volume isn't big, then:  change in pressure = - K * (new volume - old volume) / (old volume)  K for the water (at room temperature) is 2.2×109 Pa, and let's assume it stays that way because we're not doing some crazy ass science experiment.  To squeeze 100 gallons into a 99 gallon jug you'd have to exert:  change in pressure = - 2.2×109 Pa * (99 gal - 100 gal) / 100 gal change in pressure = - 2.2×109 Pa * (-1 gal - 100 gal) / 100 gal change in pressure = 22,000,000 Pa  That's the force the worlds heaviest ship (Seawise Giant, 657,019tonnes) being placed on a 3 square foot area."
chemicalreactiongifs,34aywl,driminicus,8,Wed Apr 29 21:49:40 2015 UTC,"Though it should be noted that steel is about 2 orders of magnitude less compressible than water. Difference is that the energy it takes to shear steel is of the same order as its compressibility, while shearing water is much less costly than compressing it.  In simpler terms: compressing steel is harder than compressing water, except water will very much prefer flowing away (through any cracks or whatever) over compressing, while that's not true for steel."
chemicalreactiongifs,34aywl,beaverjacket,3,Wed Apr 29 23:22:17 2015 UTC,"For all intents and purposes water IS incompressible.   Not all intents. Anything to do sound waves or shock waves in water requires compressibility. If you try to calculate the speed of sound in an ideal incompressible fluid, you get infinity.  Take OP's gif as an example: to calculate the force exerted on the bottom of the bottle by the water slamming into it, you need to know the compressibility of the fluid."

chemicalreactiongifs,34aywl,Cerealkillr95,1 point,Thu May 21 04:15:34 2015 UTC,"When you apply pressure to a gas to compress it, its density increases and the volume it takes up is reduced. With water, even when 4500lbf/in2 is applied to it, its density is only changed an incredibly small amount, whereas when water is heated or cooled, its density changes a whole lot."
chemicalreactiongifs,34aywl,experts_never_lie,0,Thu Apr 30 00:59:37 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but ...  Suppose you have a graduated cylinder, where ""graduated"" just means that it has markings on the side to show the volume, like a measuring cup.  Pour in some substance (water, styrofoam beads, sand), up to the top line.  Put that and a barometer into a glass container that is designed to handle high pressure.  Seal it and start a pump to push more air into the chamber.  As more air is in the chamber, the pressure increases.  That causes the barometer's number to increase and also for the test substance to shrink a bit.  Take the test substance's current volume and divide it by the original volume; this is the relative change in volume.  Take the barometer's current value and divide it by the original one; this is the relative change in pressure.  If you divide the relative change in volume by the relative change in pressure, you have a measure of ""compressibility"".  If that value is very small (the volume changes very little), then the substance is reasonably ""incompressible"".  The water will not shrink much under pressure.  The sand might a bit, mainly by causing the grains to find a denser arrangement.  The styrofoam beads should compress a lot, as they're mostly air.  Actual tests might be done in some other way, but this is the general idea."
chemicalreactiongifs,34aywl,dabisnit,-3,Wed Apr 29 21:21:16 2015 UTC,"I failed a thermodynamics course, so that gives me some credit in here!  In practical terms, it isn't very compressible. If you got some big machinery, it is slightly compressible. Air is very compressible like in an air compressor for your car tires. Water would not compress nearly that much."
chemicalreactiongifs,34aywl,Edward_Nygma,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:10:44 2015 UTC,does this only happen to glass? or can you do this with a metal bottle as well? granted that you could apply enough force that is.
chemicalreactiongifs,34aywl,wggn,2,Wed Apr 29 22:25:30 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine cavitation also occurs in metal bottles, however metal is not as brittle as glass so it won't break as easily."
chemicalreactiongifs,34aywl,PhantomLord666,2,Wed Apr 29 22:47:56 2015 UTC,Cavitation happens whenever you move water quickly without any way for a gas to fill the space.   Propeller driven ships can suffer from cavitation of the blades. Bubble vacuum streams form around the blade edges and then collapse under pressure. This gives a shock impact to the metal and can actually chip it.   There is something called a Pistol Shrimp that closes a pair of pincers so quickly it forms a very fast moving vacuum bubble. When this collapses it can kill or stun the shrimp's prey.

chemicalreactiongifs,34aywl,thegreybush,5,Wed Apr 29 20:58:19 2015 UTC,The liquid in OP's image is water which rushes in to fill the vacuum at such a high velocity that it destroys the bottom of the bottle.  When the same trick is performed with beer (or any other carbonated beverage) the vacuum that forms in the bottom of the bottle is filled with rapidly expanding CO2 which continues to expand until it rushes out of the top of the bottle.
chemicalreactiongifs,34aywl,enscrib,-3,Wed Apr 29 22:26:38 2015 UTC,Yeah. I understand the logistics and that beer is carbonated whereas water is not. It's still the same basic idea.
chemicalreactiongifs,34aywl,thegreybush,3,Wed Apr 29 22:36:13 2015 UTC,But it's not the same idea if the lid is on.  This basically can't be replicated with a beer that is still capped.

chemicalreactiongifs,33qox4,Elnono,62,Fri Apr 24 19:22:10 2015 UTC,"I think its more appropriate to say that this is a system rapidly moving around the triple point, unless their lab is really god damned cold.   In this case the cooling is coming from the evaporation but the ambient heat is heating it back up which is liquifying it which is then bringing it to boil which then freezes it ad nauseum.  I remember back in the day we used to remove acetone from this one material in a vac oven, and what would happen was that it would damn near instantly freeze the acetone and we couldn't get it out, because the heat transfer to the material in the oven was almost entirely radiant, there was no conductive heat transfer since it was in a vacuum.

chemicalreactiongifs,33qox4,Matrillik,103,Fri Apr 24 19:27:25 2015 UTC,"Here's my ELI5 attempt. Basically the state (gas, liquid, or solid) is different for chemicals at different temperatures and pressures. If you increase pressure you increase temperature(think of a pressure cooker), it also works in the other direction (increase temperature in a balloon and the balloon expands because the pressure on the balloon wall is increasing). What we are looking at here is a particular temperature and pressure called the tri-point. In the tri-point all three states of gas, liquid, and solid are equally favorable so they exist in equal amounts at any one time.   Edit: Further explanation:  It occurred to me that there are some ideas that need explaining as well. If you have a pot of water and increase the temperature it will boil, right? But it is important to note that you can keep the same temperature but decrease the pressure and the same pot of water will boil. You could stick your hand in it and it would feel like room temperature water, but it would be boiling around your hand not causing you harm.  Note: the tri-point only works if you keep the same volume. If the container would be allowed to expand then the pressure would change."

chemicalreactiongifs,33qox4,fiercelyfriendly,3,Sat Apr 25 03:46:03 2015 UTC,"One way to think about it is that temperature and pressure give the probability of what phase something will be in. So like water at 32 degrees F will freeze (at standard pressure of one atmosphere i.e. Pressure at sea level) will freeze. At 50, it'll melt. But if you're not at standard pressure, the rules are different.  The triple point is the temperature and pressure at which the probability of being in each of the phases is equal. In the parent comment he calls this equally favorable because the energy cost of transitioning to any state is equal. So basically this material is equally likely to boil, freeze, or melt at any given time. And as you can see in the video, it does all three."
chemicalreactiongifs,33qox4,nonsequitur_potato,3,Sat Apr 25 09:08:19 2015 UTC,I think a phase diagram might help explain. While this one uses water the principle stands. It is where the three regions meet.

ELI5   Start with a liquid Low temperature cause liquids to turn to solids.  (i.e. ice freezing) Low pressures cause liquids to boil with less heat. (i.e. water boils at a lower temperature in Denver than NYC) Boiling causes more dense liquids to turn to less dense gases (i.e. lids popping of sealed travel coffee mugs) Less dense gases want to expand (i.e. balloon expanding), but glass prevents expansion.  When a gas can't expand, only option is an increase of pressure. This does 2 things   Raises temperature.  Undoing Step 2. Raises pressure. Undoing Step 3.  Repeat.   All you need to do do is find a temperature and pressure that satisfy both 2 and 3 at the same time."
chemicalreactiongifs,33qox4,Manypopes,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:30:27 2015 UTC,"Here's my idea of what's going on with a deeper look in to what's actually happening on the molecular scale. I'm not sure if I'm right or not but this is what I came up with when my physics teacher said that what's in the video was possible.  The container on the video is having all the gas sucked out of it, it's at a very low pressure. One thing that happens at low pressure is that liquids can boil. Something else that could happen is evaporation at the surface. Evaporation occurs when high energy molecules are moving fast enough that they escape the surface. As only the high energy molecules are leaving the surface, the low energy molecules are left behind, meaning the liquid cools. When things are evaporating in an atmosphere, the molecules leaving the surface will frequently bounce off atmospheric molecules back in to the liquid meaning evaporation is slow, however in the container on the video there is no atmosphere, it is essentially a vacuum, meaning that evaporation can very easily happen.  I think that the video shows a combination of the surface rapidly cooling and freezing due to evaporation, while the rest of the fluid boils due to low pressure. It appears on the video that it is the surface that freezes not the whole body, you can see the boiling liquid bursting out occasionally.  Again I'm really just speculating here, maybe someone who knows more could comment."

Every spring/summer the park would get covered in this white fuzz that looks exactly like dandelion fuzz. The entire grass would be gone under this sea of white fuzz, like freaking Christmas in July.  Anyways, my friend, clearly not the brightest one of us, decides that at that point is the best time to show off how this stuff lights right up with barely a spark. Whips out his lighter as we're walking down the street and goes, ""Watch this."" Gets down and lights the fuzz.  My sister and I watch in amazement as the flames fan out in an arc from the side of the road. A few seconds go by, maybe 10, and our looks of amazement abruptly change to horror as we notice the flames aren't just stopping.  We run around in a frenzy stomping and yelling at one another. Every time we stomp in one spot the flames continue growing out in smaller arcs from where we hadn't stomped yet, and they were fast! Eventually we did get all the flames out but only after and arch with about a 15 ft radius had burned from the road. To this day, I still think back those 10+ years ago and think to myself, ""What would have happened if we had just panicked and ran away?""  TL;DR- The fuzzy pollen stuff from poplar trees does this too. Cool as hell... But only you can prevent forest fires."

The fire department came and put the fire out just before it reached some power lines, and then you'd be paranoid about getting caught for it all summer. Well, maybe not the same thing, but that's what happened."

chemicalreactiongifs,33imjh,WhyAmINotStudying,2,Thu Apr 23 00:45:46 2015 UTC,"At 2:46, you can see them pause the video to ""get the car keys,"" most likely putting on fake blisters. His fingers also apparently did not get harmed at all.   If it was actually hot, he would probably have pulled it out immediately and grabbed the jar, not wave it around like that and stand still."

chemicalreactiongifs,33imjh,KRSFive,67,Thu Apr 23 09:30:50 2015 UTC,"That dude was in some serious pain. You know it's bad when you run to the bathroom and put your hand in the toilet.     Really? Because all I saw was terrible acting.    Oh, and what appears to be an improperly wrapped hand.  His palm got burned but his fingers didn't?      The bullshit is strong."
chemicalreactiongifs,33imjh,voyetra8,24,Thu Apr 23 17:57:44 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't know if it hurt or not but that was clearly acted and the cameraman was way too prepared to follow him to the toilet.
chemicalreactiongifs,33imjh,tenhotuisku,35,Thu Apr 23 14:36:43 2015 UTC,"Also he's directing his action towards the camera (aka blocking) with too much awareness.   People that are experiencing excruciating pain can't even see straight, let alone react directly into the camera's lens.      He also goes right into bathroom and puts hand into toilet - bypassing the sink. No fumbling, no panic - just right into the toilet?    Gooby pls."

Maybe you didn't notice how his 'hospital wrap' was entirely missing his fingers? That's the first thing that went in, and the last to go out. They would be the most burnt of anything.  Also when you're not expecting something that 'feels as hot as a scalding iron' to instantly cover your whole hand, you can't keep it in there. You would pull it out instinctively.   Youtube careers will do anything for views, it's their job."
chemicalreactiongifs,33imjh,nekoningen,57,Wed Apr 22 21:06:59 2015 UTC,"He didn't intend to pull it out of the jar if it hurt, anymore than he intended to stop eating that cactus, or drinking that 2 liters of olive oil.  Dude does stupid shit like this on a regular basis apparently."

chemicalreactiongifs,33imjh,diplomats_son,16,Fri Apr 24 06:07:45 2015 UTC,"So, what is happening in this video?"
chemicalreactiongifs,33imjh,shenye,36,Thu Apr 23 03:36:08 2015 UTC,"The liquid he sticks his hand into is a solution of sodium acetate and is supersaturated, i.e. more of the salt is dissolved than should be at its current temperature. Most supersaturated solutions will correct for this by recrystallizing, causing the dissolved particles to come out of solution to form the solid salt. In most cases this is a relatively slow process, but for sodium acetate the recrystallization occurs rapidly and is exothermic, producing the heat that causes his painful-looking reaction."
chemicalreactiongifs,33imjh,BrotoriousNIG,25,Thu Apr 23 02:50:09 2015 UTC,Note this is also how those handwarmers filled with liquid which turns solid works.
chemicalreactiongifs,33imjh,Chronos91,2,Thu Apr 23 09:18:15 2015 UTC,Thanks.  So what is it that causes it to suddenly 'realise' it's supersaturated and correct?  What is it about putting his hand in there that prompts the correction?
chemicalreactiongifs,33imjh,BrotoriousNIG,2,Wed Apr 22 22:50:45 2015 UTC,The addition of his hand gave it something to crystallize onto and it kind of just goes from there.

chemicalreactiongifs,33imjh,icee1000,5,Wed Apr 22 21:27:39 2015 UTC,"then it wouldn't have crystallized. The whole point is that you supersaturate a solution with a salt (sodium acetate, via boiling) and then you cool the liquid to a point below which that amount of salt can be dissolved. Then, upon being introduced to basically anything that can catalyze the formation of a crystal, the crystal forms which is slightly exothermic, catalyzing the formation of more crystals.  If the water was still hot, then the crystals wouldn't form. This video is entirely 100% dramatized and the amount of people buying into it astounds me.  =["
chemicalreactiongifs,33imjh,Jeran,4,Wed Apr 22 21:34:25 2015 UTC,"I think it's because Nurd Rag said they supercooled theirs after melting it, and LA just cooled his in a freezer. No wonder it burned."
chemicalreactiongifs,33imjh,Kashito91,7,Wed Apr 22 21:45:17 2015 UTC,super cooling in this case only refers to it being liquid at the temperature it typically would solidify. not the actual temperature.

chemicalreactiongifs,33edp5,Omnilatent,-1,Wed Apr 22 03:36:24 2015 UTC,"Not quite, with 4K the resolution of the horizontal (usually the larger) is roughly (dependent on aspect ratio) 4000. So for regular screen it is is 3840x2160, or 2160p. A Full HD screen is 1920x1080, which the horizontal is around 2000, so we call it 2K, although it generally gets referred to as 1080p just with 720p and 1K. They are basically two different names for the two parts of the resolution, 2.88K would be something like 2880x1800, 16:10 aspect ratio."

chemicalreactiongifs,33edp5,cbraga,2,Wed Apr 22 02:30:41 2015 UTC,Yup! Another interesting application... in the video nitric acid dissolves silver. If we had a piece of gold/silver alloy we could separate the gold out because it would be the only thing that did not dissolve.

chemicalreactiongifs,33afx2,AsterJ,7,Tue Apr 21 13:21:00 2015 UTC,This is tagged as physics+chemistry but I don't think there is any chemical reaction involved.  A liquid nitrogen bomb is just nitrogen doing a phase change from liquid to gas in an enclosed container.
chemicalreactiongifs,33afx2,MitchB3,4,Tue Apr 21 13:06:07 2015 UTC,"When it is tagged ""Physics + Chemistry"" it doesn't mean that a chemical reaction takes place that causes what is happening in the demonstration.

chemicalreactiongifs,33afx2,AsterJ,2,Tue Apr 21 16:24:34 2015 UTC,I don't see any overlap in this gif.  Gas pressure and shockwaves are not chemistry.
chemicalreactiongifs,33afx2,MitchB3,2,Tue Apr 21 16:38:22 2015 UTC,"Pressure is studied in chemistry and I believe the chemical properties of liquid nitrogen aid in causing this effect. Of course caviation and the like regarding the explosion is studied in physics. However if you have an explanation of this gif, feel free to share. I'm not 100% clear on what is happening in this demonstration from what I have read. Does the liquid nitrogen not provide anything to the explosion in terms of its chemical properties?"
chemicalreactiongifs,33afx2,AsterJ,4,Tue Apr 21 17:01:18 2015 UTC,Molecular nitrogen is known for being fairly inert due to the strength of the triple bond.  What's happening in the gif is that as the liquid nitrogen's temperature increases it vaporizes turning from a liquid into a gas which increases the pressure in a sealed plastic bottle until it bursts.   Any gas buildup inside a sealed plastic bottle would be much the same.
chemicalreactiongifs,33afx2,MitchB3,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:16:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation, I haven't had time to properly research it. Gas pressure is dealt with in chemistry, at least that is where I initially went very in depth on the subject, and of course the study of a chemical's bonds is dealt in chemistry. Of course though physics touches on gas pressure and the effects of pressure much more than chemistry, so wouldn't that constitute in categorizing this as an overlap between the two schools2of thought?"
chemicalreactiongifs,33afx2,oracle989,2,Tue Apr 21 17:20:28 2015 UTC,"Nope.  There's absolutely no chemical component to this, it's purely a function of volume expansion as the nitrogen boils off.  The N2 bonds don't break, you've probably only got secondary bonds breaking in the bottle as it ruptures (which isn't really a chemistry issue, either, because you're not interacting with the electrons at all), and there's no reaction with the water.  Purely physical.  I mentioned a website when telling my friend how to cook something, but that doesn't make the finished dish an overlap between cooking and web development."

What if instead of pushing on the relatively flat surface of the water, you instead ""slapped"" the inside of a gas bubble enclosed within the water? This is really still just another surface, albeit a curved one, so it will exhibit this same sloshing behavior.  The explosion is basically just a ""slap"" of really high pressure which pushes the surface of the bubble outwards. As the bubble expands, the pressure inside switches from being higher than the water to being lower, but the slosh is still moving outwards.  Eventually the slosh reaches its maximum size, and the pressure inside is much lower than the water pressure. Now it sloshes inwards again, compressing the gas bubble. By the time it gets to its smallest size again, the pressure inside is one again very high, and the process repeats."

When the bottle bursts the water is pushed away, even after the pressure of the CO2 inside the bubble is equal to the head pressure of the water the water continues to move away because it takes time to slow down. When the water finally does slow down and stop the pressure inside the bubble is lower than the water pressure and so the bubble shrinks again. This will happen a few times until everything equalizes.  *Although this looks very much like cavitation it is not, the water is not being boiled due to a drop in pressure"

chemicalreactiongifs,337g63,himmeltoast,26,Mon Apr 20 07:00:52 2015 UTC,"its not. this is not the generation of low pressure in the fluid, its the release of high pressure gas into an in-compressible fluid.  water is In-compressible, where as CO2 is, but is under a lot of pressure. it expands until the shockwave returns from the explosion and partially re-compresses the CO2 bubble. the gas then compresses and re-expands and the process repeats until the energy released in the explosion has dissipated.  edit: ok so its related, call it explosion initiated cavitation if you want to get technical."
chemicalreactiongifs,337g63,JDepinet,8,Mon Apr 20 08:56:11 2015 UTC,"Cavitation:       Cavitation is the formation of vapour cavities in a liquid – i.e. small liquid-cavitation-free zones (""bubbles"" or ""voids"") – that are the consequence of cavitational forces acting upon the cavitational liquid.. It usually occurs when a liquid is subjected to rapid changes of pressure that cause the formation of cavities where the pressure is relatively low. When subjected to higher pressure, the voids implode and can generate an intense shockwave.  Cavitation is a significant cause of wear in some engineering contexts. Collapsing voids that implode near to a metal surface cause cyclic stress through repeated implosion. This results in surface fatigue of the metal causing a type of wear also called ""cavitation"". The most common examples of this kind of wear are to pump impellers, and bends where a sudden change in the direction of liquid occurs. Cavitation is usually divided into two classes of behavior: inertial (or transient) cavitation and non-inertial cavitation.  Inertial cavitation is the process where a void or bubble in a liquid rapidly collapses, producing a shock wave. Inertial cavitation occurs in nature in the strikes of mantis shrimps and pistol shrimps, as well as in the vascular tissues of plants. In man-made objects, it can occur in control valves, pumps, propellers and impellers.    Image i - Cavitating propeller model in a water tunnel experiment.

chemicalreactiongifs,337g63,mastersoup,8,Mon Apr 20 06:53:59 2015 UTC,"mine would be because once the dry ice (inside the bottle) contacts water and the outer surface boils and becomes a gas, which then floats upwards (as gas is less dense than water) and allows the dry ice to once again contact water, resulting in a second gas explosion, and the process repeats until there is no more solid dry ice left to boil  EDIT - i'm wrong."
chemicalreactiongifs,337g63,thesuperevilclown,2,Mon Apr 20 07:58:57 2015 UTC,"Dry ice is a solid. A phase transition from solid to gas is called sublimation.

It is the vessel rupturing and releasing the built up energy which causes the explosion. After the water and dry ice come in contact the gasses don't expand nearly fast enough as this phase transition is endothermic. The gas does seem to re-compress a bit on the rebounding shock wave, which is pretty neat, but that is what causes the look of reverberating."

chemicalreactiongifs,32j4wk,zthumser,17,Tue Apr 14 13:46:48 2015 UTC,"It's ""bouncing"" off the floor.  Initially it gets forced down, but it encounters the floor.

Think of it like a video of someone bouncing a rubber ball, only the video has been edited to begin the exact moment the ball touches the ground so you don't see the descent.  And instead of energy coming from the ball's velocity, it's coming from the explosion."

chemicalreactiongifs,32j4wk,mcavopol,6,Tue Apr 14 20:05:30 2015 UTC,"While there is a tiny bit of ""bounce"" that causes it to go up, what's actually happening here is that atmospheric pressure around the outside of the can is lifting it up.   Think about this. Directly after the explosion, the volume of gas inside the can is violently pushed in all directions. With up as the only way to go easily, it all rushes out of the mouth of the trashcan. That's why we see the balls shoot into the air.   Now, what happens right afterwards. We didn't ""make"" any extra air inside the can. So also, gas has inertia. The air leaving the can continues to do so and creates a low-pressure system inside the can, with a gas density much lower than that of the surrounding area.   Now, pressure has to equalize. 3 options. Can gets crushed, gas rushes back in, or can moves(and is moved by surrounding pressure) to balance out the pressures. The one picked is the path of least resistance. Based on mass and structural rigidity the last happens. If this were a much heavier steel container, the second scenario would happen.   Thus, the can is forced upwards, both by the elastic rebound (which on a flat-bottomed can would be minimal) and also by the surrounding gas trying to re-equalize as quickly as possible."
chemicalreactiongifs,32j4wk,Caleth,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:26:41 2015 UTC,"I believe that it's due to the shockwave transitioning across the boundary of the can and into the floor.  The can had been pressed downward but the wave passed to the floor so the can rebounds and the floor being tougher material acts like a springboard.  I might be misremembering as physics was about 12 years ago, but our teacher was awesome and explained things like this"

chemicalreactiongifs,32j4wk,AsterJ,21,Tue Apr 14 23:49:03 2015 UTC,None of the balls were in close proximity to the liquid nitrogen.  The liquid nitrogen was in a sealed plastic bottle that was dropped into water and exploded as the gas built up.
chemicalreactiongifs,32j4wk,austinmiles,3,Tue Apr 14 06:05:48 2015 UTC,"When the bottle explodes there is still some liquid. Some of the balls, all of which land very close to the trash bin are far less bouncy than others. Something affected their elasticity. I am assuming it wasn't water, but it could have been something that simple i suppose."
chemicalreactiongifs,32j4wk,AsterJ,2,Tue Apr 14 14:11:40 2015 UTC,There might not have been any liquid left after the pressure was released in the explosion.  The energy of the explosion is actually from the build up of gas in the bottle so you don't want much liquid in there to begin with.  If there was liquid expelled from the bottle it would be traveling at a high speed and would not have had much time to make contact with the balls (which would be insulated some by the leidenfrost effect).  If any of the balls don't bounce as high as the others they are probably just wet from the water or possibly they were damaged by the explosion.

The liquid in the cup is obviously the coke and the white powder is essentially a type of bleach which is where you mainly find Sodium Hypochlorite. The chlorine in the hypochlorite appears to be rapidly oxidizing the sugars in the corn syrup while reacting with phosphoric acid that is in the coke, causing this vigorous reaction. This is definitely not a reaction you should try lightly, as I know that many people probably have some bleach, powdered bleach and a coke like drink. At the end of the gif you see that some gas is produced, which is chlorine gas, and as most people know that is pretty deadly. I don't think may people know how to calculate the expected gas product from this reaction let alone properly measure the reactants so to avoid any accidental large plumes of chlorine gas blowing in your face you might as well not try it."
chemicalreactiongifs,327s57,MitchB3,10,Sat Apr 11 13:49:34 2015 UTC,Sodium Hypochlorite   Given that it is powder would it not be more likely calcium hypochlorite rather than sodium hypochlorite?
chemicalreactiongifs,327s57,burketo,9,Sat Apr 11 16:38:03 2015 UTC,Actually this seems more likely seeing as calcium hypochlorite is used in powdered cleaning products. What is known for certain is that it is a hypochlorite compound and that hypochlorite is what is the main reason for this reaction in said compound.
chemicalreactiongifs,327s57,MitchB3,3,Sat Apr 11 18:37:05 2015 UTC,"Sodium hypochlorite:       Sodium hypochlorite is a chemical compound with the formula NaClO. It is composed of a sodium cation (Na+) and a hypochlorite anion (ClO−); it may also be viewed as the sodium salt of hypochlorous acid. When dissolved in water it is commonly known as bleach, or liquid bleach.  Sodium hypochlorite is practically and chemically distinct from chlorine.  Sodium hypochlorite is frequently used as a disinfectant or a bleaching agent. It can be formed by reacting sodium chloride with oxygen gas, according to the formula 2NaCl + O2 → 2NaClO.

chemicalreactiongifs,326qcp,1Voice1Life,35,Sat Apr 11 01:29:20 2015 UTC,Source  The metals in question I believe are steel (the knife) and  Ferrocerium. Since the Ferrocerium is much softer than the steel in the knife it is able to  scrape off some and send it into the air. The sparks are caused by an oxidation reaction that happens due to the friction of these two objects being rubbed together. The temperature that is required for the scrapes of metal in the air to ignite is actually fairly low so that is why just the friction is enough to cause this reaction.
chemicalreactiongifs,326qcp,MitchB3,4,Sat Apr 11 02:26:04 2015 UTC,Is this reaction analogous to what happens with flint? Or is flint just partly made of or similar in structure to ferrocerium?
chemicalreactiongifs,326qcp,turdburglar_,7,Sat Apr 11 13:56:58 2015 UTC,"Basically yes. The metal that is being scraped can be slightly different, like magnesium or naturally occurring flint but the principle is the same. It is soft enough and has a low enough ignition temperature to cause the shavings to ignite when scraped off due to friction."

chemicalreactiongifs,326qcp,turdburglar_,2,Sat Apr 11 14:36:58 2015 UTC,"I thought what is happening with flint though, is that it is harder than steel. So the flint is knocking off bits of the steel, not flint. Which would be why you can only use hardened high carbon steel to make a striker."

chemicalreactiongifs,326qcp,microspooner,8,Sat Apr 11 04:04:55 2015 UTC,"sparks are metal reacting to air. like iron reacts to oxygen in the air to form iron oxide. this is the same process that forms rust on your car. this is a exothermic process (gives off heat.) it's just that this reaction takes place over a very long period of time and with a very thin layer of metal. now if you were to take this metal and to and make very small pieces with the appropriate amount of heat, they will be able to react with their surrounding oxygen then each will burn very quickly. other metal react with oxygen to form oxides. a lot of times you will find magnesium starters they work the same way."

chemicalreactiongifs,326qcp,konohasaiyajin,4,Sat Apr 11 03:54:44 2015 UTC,Looks to be just due to the rounded shape of the object.  As the steel scrapes the shavings fall slightly off to the side before they can oxidize making the sparks run down the sides some instead of following the knife.

chemicalreactiongifs,3226s7,CheekytheButtMonster,353,Thu Apr 9 23:57:34 2015 UTC,"Hard to say just based off of the short gif but I think that whatever is dissolved in that solvent is just barely soluble at room temperature. Once the flask is cooled in the ice bath, the solute begins precipitating out (cold solvent lowers solubility) and that's what you see floating around.   It looks like the solute begins to redissolve as he pulls it out of the ice bath but it could also just be the stir bar at the bottom that breaks contact with the stir plate, allowing the solute to settle to the bottom. (Stirring is responsible for the cool pattern that occurs, spontaneous convection in the flask is unlikely.)"

chemicalreactiongifs,3226s7,TittilateMyTasteBuds,10,Fri Apr 10 05:37:22 2015 UTC,"""Aromatic"" in organic them means that it has delocalised electron density in a ring formation (specifically 4n+2 electrons, as per Hückel's Rule), things like benzene, furan, pyrrole, etc. The name came from the fact that it was originally thought that these types of compounds were responsible for odours.

My previous recrystallization attempt (no stirring, cooled in the fridge overnight) led to some large, heterogenous looking chunks, so I decided to try stirring while dunking the warm solution right in the ice bath. It ended up filtering nicely, and I anticipate the smaller crystals will be easier to dry as well."
chemicalreactiongifs,3226s7,clyon89,2,Fri Apr 10 04:10:35 2015 UTC,"Possibly, but I imagine your bigger problem is starting with impure material.

Now delta-G = delta-H - T * delta-S, with delta-S < 0 means that delta-G is negative for small temperatures and positive for large temperatures. At room temperature, delta-G is positive, therefore no crystallisation. If you cool it down, delta-G gets negative. You get crystals."

chemicalreactiongifs,31n346,MrJAPoe,72,Wed Apr 8 01:44:29 2015 UTC,"This is a very interesting biological chemical reaction that really shows what strong hydrogen peroxide can do (as in not peroxide with a low concentration that you can get at any store/pharmacy). The reason this happens is due to an enzyme in blood called catalase, which happens to be one of the most common enzymes in living organisms. For those unfamiliar with enzymes in biology, they are basically really complex molecules in our bodies that help accelerate biochemical reactions. These are very fundamental to organic life.  When this strong concentration of hydrogen peroxide meets the catalase in blood a reaction occurs where the hydrogen peroxide is turned into oxygen gas and water. This doesn't happen just once though, it happens thousands of times each second all while converting millions of hydrogen peroxide molecules into water and oxygen. That of course is all due to the proficiency and efficiency of this enzyme. The foam we see in the gif is pure oxygen bubbles created from this reaction.  While interesting this reaction does leave me somewhat uneasy."
chemicalreactiongifs,31n346,bobjoeman,7,Sun May 31 02:10:01 2015 UTC,"Catalase:       Catalase is a common enzyme found in nearly all living organisms exposed to oxygen (such as vegetables, fruit or animals). It catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen.  It is a very important enzyme in protecting the cell from oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Likewise, catalase has one of the highest turnover numbers of all enzymes; one catalase molecule can convert approximately 5 million molecules  of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen each second.

It also slows down the healing process. The best method of cleaning a wound is to just utilize soap and water for minor cuts and scrapes, rinse the wound with cool water, remove debris with tweezers if needed and then use a washcloth with some unscented soap and gently wash around the wound. Then cover with a clean bandage. We haven't used hydrogen peroxide for wound cleaning in a long while, nor alcohol or iodine."

The egg will grow in size from osmosis because of the vinegar, which will likely increase your cooking time.  Also, the membrane usually peels off with the shell in boiled eggs, which I'd recommend still peeling.  I don't know if the vinegar flavor will get into the egg, but in case it does, it would probably be better for an egg salad than, say, deviled eggs.  P.S. You should probably do this in your fridge, not at room temperature."

chemicalreactiongifs,31cmnw,YarrrMatey,11,Fri Apr 3 23:39:36 2015 UTC,"Yep, and that membrane starts out pretty strong. It's one way to tell how fresh an egg is: store-bought eggs are usually at least a week old by the time you get them (not that there's anything terribly wrong with that) and have thin membranes around the albumen and even between the yolk and the white. A fresher egg ""stands up"" more when cracked into a pan. I actually prefer older eggs for hard boiling because the weaker membrane is easier to work with."

chemicalreactiongifs,318c7o,TheoLeo5,36,Mon May 18 15:48:52 2015 UTC,"Another Stanford video over this experiment.  This experiment on dancing droplets is a very interesting demonstration of fluid dynamics and chemical properties of liquids. Feel free to x-post this to /r/physicsgifs if you want. The reason why this type of motion is observed is somewhat complex but I'll try to explain. These droplets are composed of propylene glycol (an ingredient in food coloring from what I have read) and water. A difference between the surface tension of the liquids themselves and the vapor surrounding them is enough to cause the droplets to be drawn to each other, as they exert a force on one another. So you have one droplet with a vapor that attracts the other, and another droplet exhibiting the same thing just in a different direction, creating a shifting imbalance in tension between the droplets.  Depending on how you arrange them you can see them move differently based on the force of them pulling on each other due to the vapor/liquid surface tension difference"
chemicalreactiongifs,318c7o,MitchB3,3,Thu Apr 2 21:16:46 2015 UTC,"Surface tension:       Surface tension is the elastic tendency of liquids which makes them acquire the least surface area possible. Surface tension is an important property that markedly influences the ecosystem. Surface tension is exposed, for example, any time an object or insect (e.g. water striders) that is denser than water is able to float or run along the water surface.  At liquid-air interfaces, surface tension results from the greater attraction of water molecules to each other (due to cohesion) than to the molecules in the air (due to adhesion). The net effect is an inward force at its surface that causes water to behave as if its surface were covered with a stretched elastic membrane. Because of the relatively high attraction of water molecules for each other, water has a high surface tension (72.8 millinewtons per meter at 20 °C) compared to that of most other liquids. Surface tension is an important factor in the phenomenon of capillarity.  Surface tension has the dimension of force per unit length, or of energy per unit area. The two are equivalent—but when referring to energy per unit of area, people use the term surface energy—which is a more general term in the sense that it applies also to solids and not just liquids.

Evaporation is easily understood. On the surface of any liquid, some molecules convert to a gaseous state and float away.  Surface tension is what causes liquids to bead up. It arises from how tightly the molecules in a liquid bind together.  Water evaporates more quickly than propylene glycol. Water also has a higher surface tension.  These differences create a tornado-like flow inside the droplets, which not only allows them to move but also allows a single droplet to sense its neighbors."

chemicalreactiongifs,30u9l1,t3hcoolness,5,Tue Mar 31 01:02:04 2015 UTC,"This is generally a good rule of thumb. For example, a static shock that you may receive from touching a complementary charged metallic object may play out in the Kilovolt range (up to 10,000 volts is not unheard of in these scenarios). However, static shocks generally have negligible amperage and most of the time will go un-noticed unless it's one of those loud bitey ones.      However, take a scenario such as mains voltage in U.S - this is 120 Volts at a respectable 15 Amperes... this will cook, maim and kill. So long as there's enough voltage on the receiving end, you only realistically need 20~ milliamps (that's 20-Thousandths of one single Ampere) across your heart to put it out of sync and drop you into cardiac arrest."

Photoflash caps are super high voltage, sitting pretty up in the 300 Volt DC range, and they can store up to 1300 Micro-farads (a measurement pertaining to the amount of coulombs moving forward through a charge)  and then they basically dump that charge all at once - very high current output for a very brief window of time.

chemicalreactiongifs,30u9l1,tarsia,46,Mon Mar 30 22:12:32 2015 UTC,"When a current passes through something thin, the electrons find it harder to flow through, increasing resistance. In practical terms, this means the electrons are colliding with the atoms/ions in the conductor, causing the conductor to heat up. This is why there is a very thin filament in incandescent light bulbs (so they get hot and glow).  Without the thin mid-section there probably isn't enough resistance to generate enough heat to ignite the wrapper."
chemicalreactiongifs,30u9l1,exploitativity,24,Mon Mar 30 22:53:14 2015 UTC,"No, that doesn't make sense because increasing the resistance would decrease the power dissipation (P = V2 /R), decreasing the heat. More resistance does not ""generate heat"", it decreases the heat.    EDIT: However, if you have a circuit with 2 resistances, like this, if you increase R2, more voltage is dropped across R2, meaning it has a higher percentage of the circuit's total power dissipation (although the total power dissipation went down due to increased overall resistance).  And this is the actual explanation for why he made the middle smaller - although the total power dissipation went down, the percentage of power dissipation across the middle section went up (because more voltage is dropped across the middle), so the middle will be hotter than the sides. That way you know where the fire will start."

chemicalreactiongifs,30u9l1,noclipn1nja,22,Tue Mar 31 12:45:59 2015 UTC,"Wrote up a quick explanation of the physics behind this:  The amount of current I flowing through the gum wrapper in any particular cross-section has to be equal to the current through any other section.  The gum wrapper should roughly follow Ohm's Law, and so the resistance R of each section can be expressed as:  R=ρ*l/a  Where ρ is a constant which depends on the material, l is the length of the section, and a is the cross-sectional area.  When you make the mid-section skinny, you are reducing the cross-sectional area, and making the resistance of that section be much larger than the resistance of the other sections.  The power output P of Ohmic devices follows the expression:  P=I2 * R  That means that the power output in the skinny region is much higher than the rest of the wrapper.  The benefit is that the skinny region will always ignite first, which is much better than having the fire start right underneath your thumb."

A friend in highschool who probably wasnt the smartest decided messing with a light socket would be fun. He folded up gum wrappers and stuck it in the socket and then would touch the foil with his finger and then touch metal. He thought it was cool he could feel the current. Until he touched the foil on the metal near the outlet and it caused a short circut. The teacher had the outlets removed shortly after and safety was recovered as a topic for the next week.

chemicalreactiongifs,30qfvv,uomo_peloso,36,Mon Mar 30 13:57:04 2015 UTC,"Orange oil:       Orange oil is an essential oil produced by cells within the rind of an orange fruit (Citrus sinensis fruit). In contrast to most essential oils, it is extracted as a by-product of orange juice production by centrifugation, producing a cold-pressed oil.  It is composed of mostly (greater than 90%) d-limonene,  and is often used in place of pure d-limonene. D-limonene can be extracted from the oil by distillation.    Image i - Citrus sinensis (L.)

chemicalreactiongifs,30qfvv,Synit,2,Mon Mar 30 15:57:10 2015 UTC,"At a chem 101 level, that's true, and it's a decent approximation most of the time. But it's a bit of both. Even in a simple dissolution, chemical changes occur when almost anything dissolves. OH groups become O- groups, ions separate, bonds become more labile, polymers chains break into shorter pieces, etc.  That said, you're right here: the reaction most relevant to the balloon popping is probably disruption of the intermollecular interactions between polymer chains."

chemicalreactiongifs,30qfvv,or_some_shit,3,Mon Mar 30 09:08:16 2015 UTC,"I see the flair says it's a chemical reaction, but is dissolution physical or chemical? I would say physical."
chemicalreactiongifs,30qfvv,dungeonsandderp,27,Mon Mar 30 12:54:03 2015 UTC,"Evidence for these claims was gained by taking infrared (IR) spectra of balloons.  Peaks were consistently observed at 670cm-1 (indicative of a C-S bond and therefore vulcanization) and 1010 cm-1 in the IR spectra of pop-resistant balloons.  However, both of these peaks were consistently absent in the IR spectra of balloons that pop when treated with non-polar compounds.     I would say chemical because the dissolution they are referring to there (and perhaps dissolution is not the best word to use, perhaps hydration?) actually changes a covalent chemical bond in the rubber. Whereas a dissolution of say, table salt, would not involve covalent bonds."
chemicalreactiongifs,30qfvv,or_some_shit,2,Tue Mar 31 16:38:19 2015 UTC,"No! They're saying that those balloons that exhibited C-S bonds characteristic of vulcanization prevented popping, not that they were destroyed by the process."
chemicalreactiongifs,30qfvv,dungeonsandderp,1 point,Sun Mar 29 21:41:31 2015 UTC,"Well this is embarrassing...    However, both of these peaks were consistently absent in the IR spectra of balloons that pop when treated with non-polar compounds.   I think my original reading of this section was vague. I thought that the ""IR spectra of balloons that pop when treated with non-polar compounds"" was after they had treated it, but now I'm pretty sure they just mean the type of balloon and not the exact balloons we had treated with the non-polar compound. So you are right about the part I had quoted. I have brought shame to my family.   I'm unsure now whether I consider it a chemical/physical reaction; perhaps a small chemical event occurs rapidly to soften/hydrolyze some of the exposed rubber, and shortly thereafter the pressure differential is strong enough to deform the chemical defect and burst the balloon (like how the small hole caused by a needle will quickly tear open instead of slowly leak out). Or perhaps it is entirely physical, akin to how ethanol/butanol insert into themselves into membranes and cause cell death due to loss of osmotic pressure / pH gradient."
chemicalreactiongifs,30qfvv,dungeonsandderp,1 point,Sun Mar 29 21:54:45 2015 UTC,There is NO WAY you can cleave the C-C bonds in polyisoprene at room temperature with such mild conditions. It is 100% physical.
chemicalreactiongifs,30qfvv,phobiac,2,Mon Mar 30 17:47:08 2015 UTC,This is 100% a physical reaction. Limonene just dissolves polyisoprene. No chemical bonds are being broken or formed.  SOURCE: doing my Ph.D. on polymers.
chemicalreactiongifs,30qfvv,superpie8,-10,Mon Mar 30 20:18:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, dissolving is a physical change. Distillation wouldn't work otherwise."

chemicalreactiongifs,30qfvv,moonmixer,-3,Mon Mar 30 17:49:00 2015 UTC,I was going purely on the fact that the source said the rubber dissolves in the limonene. Dissolving is in fact a physical change. I can provide evidence of this if you absolutely need it but it'd probably be easier for you to open your general chemistry textbook and check yourself.

I think this is appropriate for /r/physicsgifs too. That vortex that results due to the stir plate is probably explained through fluid dynamics in physics though if that is what you were wondering.  More information on that vortex: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex  The force of the magnet below the beaker makes the metal stirrer in the liquid spin, causing flow in the liquid by rotation along some axis line (probably a straight axis line) and forming the vortex. Before the food dye is added you can usually see the vortexes very easily but the addition of it makes it stand out much more, mainly that central column where pressure is lowest and closet to the axis that is causing the rotation. The vortex is the cause a turbulent flow (which of course you could calculate) that results in the quick dissolution of the food dye."

chemicalreactiongifs,30dif2,IDoNotAgreeWithYou,-25,Fri Mar 27 02:40:48 2015 UTC,"Lava is literally defined as magma that reaches the earth's surface through a volcano vent. So...no, this is not lava.    lava is made from rocks. Of course we can collect volcanic rocks and remelt them.   That is a severe oversimplification - it's not just about the ""remelting"". As lava cools within the volcano, particles cool and form together (this is most obvious in granite), and overtime the heavier particles sink to the bottom of the magma ""well"". The residual magma is now different than the basaltic magma, as some parts are essentially removed. Basalt is a homogenous mixture that has not had any (or very little) ""settling"" - which is one of the reasons why the researchers are using basaltic, convecting magma in their studies. It's also smoother and less viscous, allowing greater control and observation, in addition to being very stable (the violent explosions that produce volcanic bombs and ash are not basaltic eruptions). We absolutely CANNOT extract magma or lava from a volcano vent. Since you're suggesting otherwise, I would be very interested to see your source.   Additionally, they're using a simple furnace like the kind used for steel - it's not some high-tech, new equipment you seem to be implying with ""lava oven""."
chemicalreactiongifs,30dif2,naturaldrpepper,31,Thu Mar 26 16:49:08 2015 UTC,"No, the definition of lava is ""hot molten or semifluid rock erupted from a volcano or fissure, or solid rock resulting from cooling of this."" So when you collect basalt to remelt it, yes that is lava. I suggest you take it up with the Syracuse LAVA Project researchers if you don't think they should have called it lava. You act like I just decided to call it lava.    We absolutely CANNOT extract magma or lava from a volcano vent. Since you're suggesting otherwise, I would be very interested to see your source.   Do you not know how to read? I said in plain English they're melting basalt. I'm absolutely not suggesting otherwise.    it's not some high-tech, new equipment you seem to be implying with ""lava oven"".   I didn't imply any such thing. I put lava oven in quotes because that's verbatim what the experimenters called it in the video.  Why are you trying so hard to make me look stupid? If you wanna add additional information or clarify certain things, you can easily do that without being demonstratively combative or completely misrepresenting my assessment.

This mean a person could sub to all of those separate subreddits but only see that post under one of those subreddits since the others were not shown on their front page.

chemicalreactiongifs,30ahlq,MitchB3,6,Wed Mar 25 20:13:02 2015 UTC,"Gif Source.  Here's another gif that I think demonstrates this experiment well  Second gif source.    I wanted to get another view of this demonstration because after some research and discussion earlier it seemed like the other chemical garden post didn't properly show what is interesting about it. This experiment is often refereed to as a ""Chemical Garden"" because you take some inorganic compounds and through some clever reactions they appear to act in an organic way, almost like plants or algae. Some of the first people to observe what is seen in this experiment mistook it as some form of plant growing because the columns that form grow very elegantly and slowly and can go for a long duration whereas other chemical reactions are often very abrupt. It also helps that these salts are very colorful.  There is a good explanation of this experiment in the second gif source, and I will try to give a summary explanation here. This experiment has two main components, Metal Salts and a solution of water and Sodium Silicate (from what I have found the solution is usually 50/50 of these two components). Salts as defined in chemistry are the product of a reaction (neutralization reaction) between an acid and a base, so the basic formula is acid + base = salt + water with an example formula for NaCl being HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O. These salts are observed as crystals. Sodium Silicate has been used as a preservative in the past. When the salts meet the solution they initially start to dissolve in the solution, spurring a reaction between the salt and the silicate. This forms an insoluble semipermeable membrane of the salt and silicate. The silicate layer is less dense than the overall solution (which is now mostly just water) and the ionic strength of what's in the membrane is greater than the solution and osmosis like effect occurs. This causes an increase in pressure within the membrane and causes a spire to form upwards, as pressure is lower in the top of the container this experiment is taking place in versus the bottom.  This is a pretty interesting reaction. I encourage you to watch the second gif source for more information and read about this elsewhere online. In that video they talk about how this experiment was done in space and examined how it acts in absence of gravity. It seems that there is a bit more to this reaction that can be found out.

chemicalreactiongifs,308mhc,Sacrix,9,Thu Mar 26 06:54:24 2015 UTC,There is a chemical reaction happening in the dynamic equilibrium of solid salts dissolving from the crystal and solute crystallizing on the surface.

chemicalreactiongifs,308mhc,hotprof,0,Wed Mar 25 17:07:01 2015 UTC,"Physical reactions are allowed here, as shown by the various disclaimers. I think a chemical reaction is actually occurring here, but I'd need to see the original source for more information.  Some more information on what is happening in this gif regarding chemical gardens. To achieve what is seen in the gif, solid metal salts are adding to a solution which consists of water and sodium silicate. When added to the solution and given some time (it depends but can happen quickly or slowly), there is some growth of the salts due to the fact that these salts (which are transition metal silicates) are insoluble in water and this can be observed due to their colored nature.  This part of the wikipedia article makes me think that a chemical reaction could be occuring to form what is seen in the gif:   A metal salt such as cobalt chloride will start to dissolve in the water. It will then form insoluble cobalt silicate by a double decomposition reaction (anion metathesis). This cobalt silicate is a semipermeable membrane. Because the ionic strength of the cobalt solution inside the membrane is higher than the sodium silicate solution which forms the bulk of the tank contents, osmotic effects will increase the pressure within the membrane.    If anyone has any more information on this experiment feel free to comment."
chemicalreactiongifs,308mhc,Sacrix,2,Wed Mar 25 13:01:52 2015 UTC,That wasn't the point of my comment. There is no reaction here.  Unless you allow things like swishing a cup of coffee back and forth?
chemicalreactiongifs,308mhc,bwaredapenguin,4,Wed Mar 25 13:05:18 2015 UTC,"I see.~~ Still the formation of these figures in the gif is through something that is not a chemical reaction as far as I know~~, however I get that you have a problem with that formation not being shown here. Still this gif is a demonstration albeit without a reaction, of a concept in chemistry. I've changed the flair to better reflect this post.  Edit: It is possible that the formation of these spires is due to a chemical reaction, possibly a decomposition reaction spurred on by the fact that the salts are insoluble in this solution and start reaction with a part of the solution. If anyone knows anything else about this feel free to comment."
chemicalreactiongifs,308mhc,Sacrix,4,Wed Mar 25 13:58:11 2015 UTC,This could have easily been a still image though. Being a gif added absolutely nothing to this submission because nothing is happening.

chemicalreactiongifs,308mhc,breakneckridge,2,Wed Mar 25 17:05:41 2015 UTC,"I COMPLETELY disagree. A time lapse of this process WOULD be on topic here, but the static end result is NOT.

There's no point in having '/r/immediateresultofchemicalreactionssubmergedinwatergifs' when this sub is about as relevant to the post as possible. Furthermore it's entirely possible there are still chemical reactions ongoing in the gif pictured. Also this sub allows videos even though it's a sub about gifs, so with that in mind I don't think it's that much of a slight to show a developed chemical garden as opposed to a developing one.  I get where you're coming from, and I think some subreddits do need strict moderation where it's important that non relevant posts be consistently removed (as is often seen in /r/AskHistorians) but I completely disagree that this is one of those cases. There's totally an argument to be made that it doesn't fall within the scope of this sub, but it's an argument that requires splitting hairs which I don't think is necessary."
chemicalreactiongifs,308mhc,Sacrix,0,Thu Mar 26 16:58:25 2015 UTC,I disagree. There is no reaction shown here. This is basically the same as a a still picture. It doesn't belong in this subreddit.

chemicalreactiongifs,308mhc,QuintusVS,-3,Wed Mar 25 14:51:48 2015 UTC,By that definition people could post literally anything here.

chemicalreactiongifs,308mhc,the408striker,0,Wed Mar 25 15:02:16 2015 UTC,That is a good point however I'm sure we wouldn't allow a gif of a tree not moving. At least in this demonstration it appears as such there is something that can be observed within reason. I have done a bit of looking up on this particular demonstration and it appears that more is happening than I was previously aware of. I think a chemical reaction is partly responsible for the formation of the metal salt spires. If you know anything else about this reaction please share.
chemicalreactiongifs,308mhc,Shoggopus,-4,Wed Mar 25 15:09:17 2015 UTC,"I think the point being made is that the gif does not show any reaction occurring.

chemicalreactiongifs,301nid,DemWolverines,15,Mon Mar 23 23:04:52 2015 UTC,"I'm a chemistry teacher at a high school and my kids were asking for a demonstration of chemical synthesis reactions. After looking over the reaction of Mercury (II) Thiocyanate, I figured we would use our flame hood and try it in class.  So the day came when we prepped the reaction, and I didn't really know how much I should use, so I measured out about 500g of the substance and lit it.  Bad. Idea.  The resulting substance was so large it spilled out into the rest of the room overflowing from the hood.  Maintenance spent most of the day cleaning it all up, while I awkwardly taught in the other part of the room.  Fast forward a couple of worry filled days, and I get a call to the principal's office for a meeting.  Knowing there was nothing good that could come from a personal meeting with the principal, I resigned myself to my fate and walked in with my head held high.  What shocked me was the calm demeanor of it all, how everything that I was so worried about just seemed to go away.  The principal explained that he understood I was just trying to teach and no disciplinary action would be taken as long as I sorted a few things out.  First, I had to write an apology letter to the staff for cleaning up my mess.  Second, I had to promise never to use Mercury (II) Thiocyanate in class again.  Both seemed logical to me, but the third caught me off guard.  As I was about to exit, the principal asked for one more thing.  When I asked what it was, he said ""I need about tree fiddy"".  And that was when I realized that the principal was 8 stories tall and was a creature from the Paleolithic era.  I had been working for the Loch Ness monster the whole time.  I stormed out without giving him tree fiddy and never taught in that school again  Edit: I can't spell"

With a traditional flint, the roles are reversed: the very hard flint scrapes off little chips of steel, which ignite from friction and reaction with oxygen."

It's not often made in that shape/that big because it can be unwieldy and tough to predict how & when it will melt.  Nickel is really hard and corrosion-resistant. It's a great alloy for steel. In fact, you can use so much of it as an alloy, you can basically use it to replace iron.   304, a generic stainless steel, is about 8% Ni, 70% iron, and the rest other stuff those picks your dentist pokes your teeth with are really high-performance metals - about 40% Ni and 40% iron. There's so much other stuff you can barely call it steel - mostly it's just called ""special alloy stainless"" Steam turbine blades and airplane engine parts are a similar mix but with no iron hardly at all.

chemicalreactiongifs,2zxbfl,donk6075,6,Sun Mar 22 19:29:43 2015 UTC,"It is melting way faster. And it's melting slower than you'd expect - for a reason.  The metal is so hot it's boiling the water component of the butter under it - and likely some of the oil too.  Because the steam is suspending the metal in the air, it looks like it's melting less butter (it's floating in ""mid air"", not sitting on butter that won't melt)  Finally, because there's all that vapor around the metal, it forms an insulating layer and the solid butter won't absorb the heat as fast as you'd expect"

Heat transfers very slowly within a lump of dense metal when we're talking convective heat delta temperatures of a thousand degrees.  FYI, stuff starts to (barely) glow around 1000°F (like, if your eyes are sensitive and adjusted and it's dark in the room). Around 3000°F it will be so bright it's painful to look at.   To be actively glowing in an otherwise well-lit room, we're probably talking around 1500-2000°F.

But keeping it simple, the fuel needs to be in a gaseous form and mixed with the air and be introduced with a spark to cause an explosion.  What happens when alcohols like this are on fire, the liquid isn't actually burning, but vaporizing quickly and the gas molecules are being combusted too quickly to sufficiently mix with air to form an explosion."

chemicalreactiongifs,2zvcan,bad_as_the_dickens,39,Sun Mar 22 10:36:07 2015 UTC,It's liquid methane.
chemicalreactiongifs,2zvcan,Borax,30,Sun Mar 22 17:18:01 2015 UTC,Judging by its frictionless spreading across the floor (probably a result of the leidenfrost effect) and apparently very high surface tension (high droplet separation) I would say it's a supercooled gas. Probably butane.
chemicalreactiongifs,2zvcan,lps2,8,Sun Mar 22 13:27:05 2015 UTC,really? In my experience butane expands far too rapidly and the concentration at which it can cause an explosion is very low (hence all the explosions from dumb asses trying to make BHO indoors out in CA)
chemicalreactiongifs,2zvcan,Borax,4,Sun Mar 22 14:58:15 2015 UTC,I just can't think what else would cause that leidenfrost effect and still be flammable. It could be ethane or methane chilled in liquid nitrogen.
chemicalreactiongifs,2zvcan,ranger922,20,Sun Mar 22 11:03:22 2015 UTC,I think it is liquid methane?
chemicalreactiongifs,2zvcan,startgreen,5,Sun Mar 22 19:11:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, I would expect that with liquid methane you would get a lot more vapor burning. Since methane boils at 111 K it would be turning into a gas very quickly, but there would still be a high enough concentration of the gas to catch fire, so you would see more of a fireball than the spread of liquid fire that we see in the video."

Most of my reddit time is on my phone at work during down time. I do reddit some at home when I can watch videos, but usually at home I'm using my time for other things. Anyway, I can't watch videos at work because the sound would be disruptive. I suppose I can watch them with the sound off, but that can suck most of the time.   In a general sense, I think it would make a lot of sense need to allow videos that are instructive, but I wouldn't want to see the sub taken over by videos. Little is more annoying than a five second video that ends before the good part."
chemicalreactiongifs,2zs9y7,Stoned_Vulcan,32,Sun Mar 22 11:49:28 2015 UTC,"I've got no problem with physical or biochemical reactions; in fact I've posted a couple here myself. I think that as long as posts encourage discussion, provide source material, etc. then there's no harm done. The fact that this subreddit has a large following & semi-regularly reaches the front page, means that people may be more inclined to post here that other appropriate subreddits.   Rather than removing posts entirely, perhaps we can use our chemistry powers for good and actively encourage those who post physical or biochemical reactions to cross-post them to r/physicsgifs and r/biologygifs? This will not only give the OP more of that sweet sweet karma they so desire, but it might also help to grow the audiences in those subreddits & spread the love of all things science-gif."
chemicalreactiongifs,2zs9y7,MundaneInternetGuy,24,Sat Mar 21 11:40:29 2015 UTC,What I find more annoying are the 'here's the top page of this subreddit bundled again as a post' collections.

chemicalreactiongifs,2zs9y7,Insula92,9,Sat Mar 21 11:45:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback guys and to /u/MitchB3 for addressing the issue. I just wanted to remind everyone the initial reason for allowing physical reactions – there aren't all that many chemical reactions that do something worth videoing.   In order to keep content flowing, we made the decision early on to allow physical reactions and I believe that has helped us grow to the size we are today.   Sure, there's always someone who complains but you usually find them way down the bottom of the page with a negative score. That fact, combined with the feedback so far here, makes me thing we should keep things the way they are. The mods will have a chat about it once this thread has had a chance to develop a little more so keep the feedback coming.   We're definitely open to the idea of only allowing chemical reactions if the community desires, but so far it seems like the vast majority are in favour of having both."

chemicalreactiongifs,2zonrm,keraneuology,8,Fri Mar 20 20:19:56 2015 UTC,Here is the original video   A small amount of mercury amalgamates itself into an aluminum I-beam and destroys it from within. Gallium scratched into the surface allows the mercury to penetrate the protective oxide layer that normally surrounds anything made of aluminum.
chemicalreactiongifs,2zonrm,keraneuology,4,Fri Mar 20 16:10:14 2015 UTC,Hg attacks Al much faster than Ga. Here is a video of straight Ga applied to an Al sheet and it requires several days to corrode the Al to point of failure.  Hg is essentially banned from aircraft due to the reactivity. Ga is not.  http://www.rsc.org/education/eic/issues/2008May/ExhibitionChemistry.asp  http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2004-09/amazing-rusting-aluminum
chemicalreactiongifs,2zonrm,keraneuology,1 point,Fri Mar 20 21:16:27 2015 UTC,"In any case the original video of the I beam states it's a gallium mercury amalgamate added to the aluminium I beam.   If you would bother to back to the original source you would see that gallium isn't even mentioned. Not once. It is an article about the interaction of Hg and Al. Period.  Now, where did you get the idea that the I beam video is a ""gallium mercury amalgamate""? Do you think that it is so because ""Gallium scratched into the surface allows the mercury to penetrate""? That is not an amalgamate. You do not need gallium to produce this reaction.   The gallium therefore reacts as a catalyst. Dissolving it's way through the aluminium oxide coating   Gallium does not dissolve through AlO - at least certainly not that quickly.  Please learn how to chemistry before you make inaccurate statements. Before you respond please comprehend the following:  Al(s) + 3H2O(l)  -->  Al(OH3)(s) + 3/2H2(g)   When you can explain why Ga is necessary for this reaction you will have become a man, my son."
chemicalreactiongifs,2zonrm,keraneuology,2,Fri Mar 20 21:33:56 2015 UTC,Why do you think that Hg does not react with Al on its own?  Here is a video that explicitly states that they are not using Ga in any form.  Your claim that this reaction will not occur without Ga is completely fabricated on your part. Please do not respond again until you have learned some chemistry as well as some manners.
chemicalreactiongifs,2zonrm,keraneuology,2,Sat Mar 21 00:31:00 2015 UTC,"And the Ga/Al reaction is extremely slow as well and doesn't sink into the Al either - what's your point?  May I remind you that your original comment was ""it's the gallium that does all the work""?  I suppose we could ask the person who actually made the video if it was gallium doing all the work. Oh, wait, we can! He's on reddit. Here is a post he made about the video.   This is my video, and it is mostly mercury, not gallium. I used a small amount of gallium at the beginning because it helps disrupt the aluminum oxide layer and allows the mercury to make contact with raw aluminum metal. (There are other ways to do this that don't involve gallium, I just happened to have some gallium handy.) The bulk of the reaction, however, is due to the much larger quantity of mercury I used.   Notice how anything even marginally approaching ""it's the gallium that does all the work"" is strangely absent? I wonder why that might be? You'd think that somebody who writes books about elements and actually performs experiments might know something about the subject, but then again an anonymous stranger who claims to have a PhD says he's wrong so who is anybody else to argue?  So - should I believe the guy who actually did it and writes books on the elements or the guy who thinks that comments such as ""Wow you genius"" constitutes good manners?"

chemicalreactiongifs,2zonrm,MurphysLab,0,Sat Mar 21 11:50:31 2015 UTC,"It's probably mercury and aluminum, just sped up with a time-lapse. Technically it is not reacting with the aluminum, but rather catalyzing the reaction of aluminum with oxygen, as the aluminum-mercury amalgam no longer forms a passivating oxide layer, which prevents subsequent oxidation."

The sulfuric acid dehydrated the sugar laving only carbon (empirical formula: CH2O -> C + H2O). And as for the tin, the first allotrope, white tin, looks like a normal metal block but when it is cooled, the atoms rearrange themselves and form the crumbly allotrope, grey tin, (similar to how graphite and diamond are two allotopes of carbon), because of this, tin is basically useless in extreme cold."

chemicalreactiongifs,2ze0ba,Cpl_DreamSmasher,146,Tue Mar 17 20:38:20 2015 UTC,"It is an example of a superconductor hovering above a permanent magnet ""track."" Basically the individual atoms of the disc are cooled down and start behaving...strangely. They essentially enter a state where they begin to generate a magnetic field opposite whatever field they are exposed to. So, the disc floats no matter what! It stays at an angle because even though the field is set when in place, the disc can still be moved by external factors. So when he moves it, the disc moves and its field has to readjust to the permanent magnet track below! This effectively locks it into position above the track, and it does not rotate or move from there (even though it can ""float"" the position of the disc remains the same relative to the magnetic field).   Eh, maybe that was an ELI14 or something, but hopefully you got the gist of it."

It's also a phenomenally difficult engineering problem due to the extremely low temperatures which superconductors operate at.  /u/Syncs understates the case when he says ""cold"".  Superconductors do not function unless kept near 0 K.  That exact temperature varies by material, but typically it's significantly colder than liquid nitrogen, and is extremely difficult to maintain.   EDIT:  Apparently we can do superconductors around liquid nitrogen temperatures.  Neat!  That really only somewhat mitigates the engineering difficulties though - Liquid nitrogen is a lot warmer than absolute zero, but it's still damn cold.

Radiation doesn't care though, it'll still fry you like a fish.  Fun fact:  heat exhaustion would be a huge issue if a human were exposed to a vacuum.  Heat exhaustion is kinda the wrong description though, because in a addition to the whole nothing-to-breathe problem and the insane amounts of radiation, there's actually nothing to physically contact you and absorb your body heat.

To start with, the closest thing to a liquid nitrogen generator I can think of would be a recirculating chiller running LN2.  Those are fine, they're a closed system and actually wouldn't need to be charged with nitrogen all too terribly often.  Problem is, even with extremely high pressure LN2 warms up very quickly.  Like, if you are sending it along a tube in a cooling system, the nitrogen will undergo evaporation by the time it moves 10 or 20 feet (20 is very generous).  So these recirculators would need to be placed every twenty feet at best.  That's a lot of chillers, and a lot of power required to run them.  Other problem is the actual forces involved.  I don't know enough about this material in particular or superconductors in general to give more than an educated guess, but I would be very surprised if these can output enough force to hold up a loaded train."

The Earth's magnetic field is extremely weak, probably too little to make much of anything float with the principles that we currently know. Not to mention that the force that the field exerts decreases greatly with distance. That little floating disc would not stay put much farther away from that magnetic track. Not to mention that that there are a number of other magnets on earth (such as large metal structures like the Golden Gate Bridge) that make the field a little wonky in places. So for now, a track or magnetic ""surface"" is the best option (or simply our standard air travel methods).   THAT SAID, it might be possible by other means.

Basically this is a type II superconductor which means the magnetic fields are all be excluded from the material except in certain locations, called flux tubes, where the magnetic field lines can penetrate into the material.   The flux tubes are a result of defects in superconductor and the magnetic field lines can only penetrate at those locations so the superconductor ends up pinned in space by the field lines.   It's allowed to run around the disk because the field lines in that direction are continuous, the field lines act like rails the superconductor slides along."

You really need to study physics to properly understand it, but the disc is trying to avoid the production of eddy currents.  See, when a metal object (for example) moves from outside a magnetic field to inside a magnetic field, eddy currents are produced. And the same when moving from within a magnetic field to outside a magnetic field. So since this superconducting disc is already within a magnetic field, it wants to avoid leaving it, because it would produce eddy currents.  To directly answer your question, if the disc rotated relative to the magnetic field, it would actually produce eddy currents doing this, so this is why it is locked in place. However, it can glide around the table because the magnetic field stays constant all the way around."

chemicalreactiongifs,2z8x79,RedditsSnoo,17,Tue Mar 17 01:23:51 2015 UTC,"In this gif you will see a flask filled with a clear solution which is called sodium acetate.  This solution is in fact in a state of supersaturation. Essentially in a solution you have a solvent (liquid) and some type of material that is mixed into it. Think mixing salt into water. In this case there is more of the material (sodium acetate) than there is liquid, so the solution really wants to be a solid but it is in this state where all it needs is a little push to get there. That push is caused by agitating the liquid with something, which is the black bar in the flask. That agitation and the black bar gives the solution a place to start reforming the molecules in it and become a solid, hence why this is a physical reaction, as it is a phase change. As it turns out this change also releases a bit of energy, which is where the ""hot"" part of ""hot ice"" comes from. And of course the ice comes from sodium acetate not looking all to different from frozen water.  There is a bit more you can read about this in case you want a more clear description (like exactly how the molecules are actually behaving and how they want to be, and why energy is released), so if you want I'd suggest reading the supersaturation wiki page or this one."
chemicalreactiongifs,2z8x79,MitchB3,1 point,Tue Mar 17 03:49:39 2015 UTC,its a supersaturated sodium acetate solution. The black rod has seeded a nucleation point for the crystals of sodium acetate to form causing the solution to solidify as the crystals grow.

Does the current increase when the fluid is moved near the coils?  I assume so at least slightly since it's doing work.  EDIT2:  why does it seem to cycles around the three phases in sequence?  Are they all always on but that's just how the fluid reacts or are they cycling in amplitude to cause that?
chemicalreactiongifs,2z3ps7,Gnashtaru,2,Sun Mar 15 22:09:17 2015 UTC,My meter doesn't work well at such low frequencies so I couldn't tell you. I think the current does probably increase as the ferrofluid links the magnetic fields between the cores better than air.  Edit: It's being powered from a 120v 3phase inverter so the coils are 120 degrees out of phase from each other. They aren't powered one at a time but their peak power occurs in one coil at a time.

Maintenance procedures were in progress, which required the main central control rod to be manually withdrawn a few inches to reconnect it to its drive mechanism; at 9:01 p.m. this rod was suddenly withdrawn too far, causing SL-1 to go prompt critical instantly. In four milliseconds, the heat generated by the resulting enormous power surge caused water surrounding the core to begin to explosively vaporize. The water vapor caused a pressure wave to strike the top of the reactor vessel, causing water and steam to spray from the top of the vessel. This extreme form of water hammer propelled control rods, shield plugs, and the entire reactor vessel upwards. A later investigation concluded that the 26,000-pound (12,000 kg) vessel had jumped 9 feet 1 inch (2.77 m) and the upper control rod drive mechanisms had struck the ceiling of the reactor building prior to settling back into its original location.[7][10] The spray of water and steam knocked two operators onto the floor, killing one and severely injuring another.

A Scout in the Boy Scouts of America, Hahn conducted his experiments in secret in a backyard shed at his mother's house in Commerce Township, Michigan. While his reactor never reached critical mass, Hahn attracted the attention of local police when he was stopped on another matter and they found material in his vehicle that troubled them and he warned that it was radioactive. His mother's property was cleaned up by the Environmental Protection Agency ten months later as a Superfund cleanup site. Hahn attained Eagle Scout rank shortly after his lab was dismantled.

chemicalreactiongifs,2z0c2a,Theemuts,45,Sun Mar 15 00:18:36 2015 UTC,"Reposting one of my old comments:  If you want to know more about the blue glow:  What is it?  It's called Cherenkov radiation, which is caused by electrically charged particles which travel through the water at a higher speed than light does. Matter can move faster than light in a medium like water, because light propagating through a medium interacts with it and effectively moves at a lower speed than the speed of light; different colors move at different speeds, which is the reason why a prism separates white light into its constituent colors.  Okay, so the particle moves quickly. Why does it emit light?  As I said, the electric particle affects its surroundings. If the particle travels slowly, the water molecules move quickly enough to keep up with the changes caused by the particle, and they do so without losing much energy. When we increase the particle's speed, the water can't keep up and literally a shockwave of light is generated. You might know that when a jet flies faster than the speed of sound, it will create a sonic boom. This is basically the same effect, but for light instead of sound!  Okay, cool. But why is it blue, and not yellowish-red or white like most light sources I know?  The color of light depends on how it's emitted. Sodium lamps, for example, emit light that's mostly one color; the sun and lightbulbs emit light of many colors, the distribution of those colors depends on the temperature of the light-emitting object. For each of those ways to emit light you can predict what colors will be present and it's no different for Cherenkov radiation. The equation that tells us what colors to expect, the Frank-Tamm formula predicts that blue and ultravolet light are more intensely present than red light, so the radiation looks blue to us.  Please feel free to ask me more questions!"
chemicalreactiongifs,2z0c2a,-Noway-,2,Sun Mar 15 05:48:48 2015 UTC,"If the particle travels slowly, the water molecules move quickly enough to keep up with the changes   Is it the water molecules physically moving? Wouldn't that then be dependent on the viscosity, not the refractive index?"
chemicalreactiongifs,2z0c2a,Theemuts,5,Sat Mar 14 14:03:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, the water molecules are polar molecules, so they interact with an electric field. This means that it's the actual molecules which move.  Viscosity is part of fluid mechanics, in which fluids are modeled as continuous substances and the smallest volume element dV is defined to include many particles, so they describe average properties of the fluid. It doesn't make sense to talk about viscosity on an atomic level, just like you can't really talk about a house when you press your nose against the bricks; you'll just see bricks."
chemicalreactiongifs,2z0c2a,Jonnyshortlegs,3,Sat Mar 14 14:26:55 2015 UTC,"Do the water molecules themselves move, or is it a redistribution of electron density inside the water molecule?

chemicalreactiongifs,2z0c2a,WolfSheepAlpha,3,Sat Mar 14 16:38:46 2015 UTC,"It's a tricky part of physics. A photon will always propagate at the speed of light, but technically photons can only exist in a vacuum. When matter is involved, you have to include the effect light and matter have on each other.   As you know, solids contain a lot of particles, and it's computationally impossible to calculate the force on each seperate particle. Luckily, there's a better way to model a photon travelling through a solid. You take both the photon and the disturbance it causes and call it a single particle. This new particle behaves like a photon in a vacuum, but with an important difference: it's massive. Because the new particle, which physicists call a photon quasiparticle, has mass, it will not propagate at the speed of light.   Of course, we often neglect saying it's a photon quasiparticle, but simply say the photon has gained mass so it doesn't travel at the speed of light anymore."

chemicalreactiongifs,2z18t8,MitchB3,2,Sat Mar 14 17:06:24 2015 UTC,"There are actually 2 type of reactions going on here that lead up to that final reaction resulting in the fire, one being an acid-base reaction and the other being a dehydration reaction. These two reaction happening simultaneously is due to the reaction of sulfuric acid on potassium permangante.  Initially when the two compounds come into contact the sulfuric acid causes the formation of permanganic acid by adding a hydrogen to the manganate ion  in permanganate. This change then causes the new compound to dehydrate (loss of water molecule in the reaction) and forms another compound called manganese heptoxide. As it turns out manganese heptoxide is pretty unstable and an effective oxidizer, so when it comes into contact with something organic it can ignite.  So in the gif from right to left you have a dish of sulfuric acid, some potassium permanganate and then lastly some organic matter in the form of a cotton ball. A dab of acid is taken and mixed with a little bit of the permanganate and then placed on top of the cotton ball and the reaction I described above takes place. It's pretty interesting that not much acid or permanganate is needed to get this reaction going and that it happens pretty quickly, so I would imagine that if you somehow got hold of sulfuric acid and potassium permanganate you would not want to mix too much of it together and let it get in contact with organic matter.

This volatile liquid is highly reactive and more often discussed than intentionally prepared. It is a dangerous oxidizer and was first described in 1860.

The cloud chamber is filled with super saturated alcohol vapour that DESPERATELY want's to condense into little droplets but doesn't have a condensation nucleus. It's cooled to -40°F=°C or below. Think of these hand warmer packs that crystallize out when you click the metal disk inside. That's a super saturated solution. The radiation from the decaying gas kick-starts the condensation along its trail which is why you can see it.

chemicalreactiongifs,2ywqsv,derblitzmann,7,Fri Mar 13 23:24:39 2015 UTC,"There are different types of radiation. Cloud chambers are great for showing alpha and beta particles that are emitted from radioactive decay.  Look at true-detective's comment for specifics, but the trails that are seen are from alpha particles, which are basically Helium ions.  Gamma rays travel at the speed of light, as it is light. Alpha and beta particles are particles, and thus will travel much slower than you might of thought."
chemicalreactiongifs,2ywqsv,Structure3,3,Sat Mar 14 01:23:43 2015 UTC,Ahh I should have remembered that alpha and beta were physical particle emissions.  For some reason I thought they were all like gamma emissions.
chemicalreactiongifs,2ywqsv,SUPERsharpcheddar,2,Sat Mar 14 02:41:46 2015 UTC,What speed would they be traveling? I assumed it was a large fraction of the speed of light.
chemicalreactiongifs,2ywqsv,derblitzmann,1 point,Sat Mar 14 09:55:40 2015 UTC,"The speed of the particles greatly depends on the energy that they are emitted with.  For alpha particles, most are emitted between 3 and 7 MeV (Mega electron Volt), with the average around 5 MeV. At 5 MeV, for an alpha particle, this results with a speed of about 15,000 km/s, or around %5 the speed of light.  For beta particles, it is rather different as beta particles are much lighter than alpha particles. A difference between two protons and two neutrons versus an electron (or positron). These are the particles that cause Cherenkov radiation as they can get closer to the speed of light (and thus exceed the local speed of light in water).  So in short, you are right that beta particles have a speed a large fraction of light, but alpha particles are much slower than that."

chemicalreactiongifs,2yt6ex,NeilHummus,7,Thu Mar 12 17:49:54 2015 UTC,"Though phosphorus based matchheads were once the norm, nowadays only the striker has red phosphorus and the head is typically potassium chlorate. This is for a few reasons, including the instability of phosphorus and that it's a key ingredient in making meth. Potassium chlorate is in general much less useful for illegal things.  The reason the match ignites is because phosphorus and potassium chlorate in contact form an incredibly shock-sensitive high-explosive compound called ""Armstrong's mix"". Basically, putting the two in contact and applying friction makes tiny explosions that ignite the rest of the potassium chlorate on the match."

chemicalreactiongifs,2ykxgz,H1GGS103,3,Thu Mar 12 06:01:05 2015 UTC,"Chloral hydrate:       Chloral hydrate is an organic compound with the formula C2H3Cl3O2. It is a colorless solid. It has limited use as a sedative and hypnotic pharmaceutical drug. It is also a useful laboratory chemical reagent and precursor. It is derived from chloral (trichloroacetaldehyde) by the addition of one equivalent of water.  It was discovered through the chlorination (halogenation) of ethanol in 1832 by Justus von Liebig in Gießen.   Its sedative properties were first published in 1869 and subsequently, because of its easy synthesis, its use was widespread.  It was widely used recreationally and misprescribed in the late 19th century. Chloral hydrate is soluble in both water and ethanol, readily forming concentrated solutions. A solution of chloral hydrate in ethanol called ""knockout drops"" was used to prepare a Mickey Finn.  More reputable uses of chloral hydrate include its use as a clearing agent for chitin and fibers and as a key ingredient in Hoyer's mounting medium, which is used to prepare permanent or semi-permanent microscope slides of small organisms, histological sections, and chromosome squashes. Because of its status as a regulated substance, chloral hydrate can be difficult to obtain. This has lead to chloral hydrate being replaced by alternate reagents   in microscopy procedures.  It is, together with chloroform, a minor side-product of the chlorination of water when organic residues such as humic acids are present. It has been detected in drinking water at concentrations of up to 100 micrograms per litre (µg/L) but concentrations are normally found to be below 10 µg/L. Levels are generally found to be higher in surface water than in ground water.

It seems it could also be calcium hypochlorate tablets, in which case it reacts with the water to form calcium ions, chlorine gas, and oxygen gas (as well as some side reactins oxidizing the alcohol/producing chloroalkanes).  This is a pretty stupid idea in either case, as the fumes are dangerous. A half-as-stupid option would be dry ice, where you still get the desired boom without the noxious fumes."

chemicalreactiongifs,2yczel,dcruuuz,18,Mon Mar 9 02:07:45 2015 UTC,"Mostly whatever's in the air, so nitrogen and oxygen and a bit of carbon dioxide. Gas solubility has to do primarily with the partial pressure of the gas in the atmosphere (as well as the species themselves), because there's an equilibrium between the gaseous and aqueous phases of the gas. If the partial pressure of the gas is higher then it forces more of the gas into solution. This is also a reason why carbonated drinks are pressurized, since the bubbles in those are just dissolved carbon dioxide and keeping the partial pressure of the CO2 high keeps lots of fizz in the drink. Actually that's a bit misleading because it's not purely the solubility of the CO2, since it also reacts with water to form carbonic acid and then it's a chemical equilibrium as well. But the partial pressure of the CO2 in the atmosphere helps with that equilibrium as well.  TL;DR: Whatever's in the air."

chemicalreactiongifs,2y5u6g,Link-Mandos,57,Sat Mar 7 02:48:11 2015 UTC,"Please excuse me if I'm somewhat wrong but it's my understanding that radiation as we know it comes off in three types of particles. Alpha particles, Beta Particles and Gamma rays.  What we're seeing here are the Alpha particles themselves dissociating from the Uranium atoms. IIRC Alpha particles are + He atoms containing two neutrons and two protons.  These are particles we can clearly see using a cloud chamber. They are essentially just the base element thrown off by radiation to slowly decay the atoms into a different element.    Beta Particles which produce something known as Beta Decay are just spare electrons being shot out as another form of radiation. This, I believe is the least harmful part of the radiation types. (I think). Since they are only an electron we can't quite see them using a cloud chamber and would need something like a Gold Foil setup in order to observe them.   Gamma Rays/particles are where you lose me. From what I remember, they are high energy photons and are extremely harmful to us as they tend to quite literally shake apart your atomic structure, atom by atom.   I may have rambled to explain a 3 word joke, but I am proud of myself.  EDIT: It has been pointed out I forgot Neutron Radiation. Reason being I know shit-all about it.

Electrical or magnetic interference inside a computer system can cause a single bit of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) to spontaneously flip to the opposite state. It was initially thought that this was mainly due to alpha particles emitted by contaminants in chip packaging material, but research[2] has shown that the majority of one-off soft errors in DRAM chips occur as a result of background radiation, chiefly neutrons from cosmic ray secondaries, which may change the contents of one or more memory cells or interfere with the circuitry used to read/write them.>"

On a submarine, everything has to be optimized for space and the fuel is put in before the submarine is closed. The Navy's fuel usually lasts 25-30 years before it needs to be replaced, at which point it would cost more to cut open, replace, and reseal the submarine than it would to just build a newer, more advanced submarine."

chemicalreactiongifs,2y5u6g,dizekat,12,Sat Apr 11 16:01:29 2015 UTC,"So, I looked it up on wikipedia. It sounds like the amount of enrichment can actually vary. Higher-enriched reactors have to be refueled less, and refueling a nuclear sub is presumably quite a trial. The reactors can also be smaller, and size is at a premium on a submarine.  We most don't use highly enriched uranium in ordinary reactors because it's not worth the money, and highly-enriched uranium is a nuclear proliferation risk (it's what we're trying to stop Iran producing, since it's the hard part of making a nuclear bomb, the rest is ""just"" engineering)."
chemicalreactiongifs,2y5u6g,P3t0r,5,Fri Mar 6 22:22:42 2015 UTC,"As you point out, we could use higher enriched reactors for power production, and this would allow us to run a reactor for longer before shutting it down for refuel outage. The importance of a refuel outage is not only that you get to refuel the core, but also that you can repair all the important safety stuff that is either too crapped up or too important to take out during normal operation, like the humongous pumps, super-important instrumentation, emergency diesel generators, control rod drives, and other double-redundant stuff the NRC (in America) says you have to have functional in order to be licensed.  So, while we could run for, say, 6 year cycles, it is often much better to run for 1.5-2yr cycles, because you can fix all the rest of the plant while the unit is down for maintenance. If you wait too long, your stuff will eventually break down and you will have to offline the unit to fix it anyways, losing millions of dollars worth of generation capacity in the process."

One BED is often taken as 0.1 µSv, however, in practice this dose is not cumulative as the principal radioactive component is excreted to maintain metabolic equilibrium. The BED is only an indicative concept meant to show the existence of very low levels of natural radioactivity within a natural food, and is not a formally adopted dose quantity.

Which is essentially only a skin dose, which equates to very little overall damage. Lets say your finer for sake of argument, takes a large dose of radiation of any kind, you probably won't even get sick from it, but if you had that same dose to your stomach would make you very very sick, if not kill you, or lungs too.

Or if you could have say hard mercury, you couldn't make a sword out of that, because it's excessive unnecessary extra damage.   It seems to me, that a uranium bullet would extra unnecessary harm, when the main effect is to cause physical damage from the bullet. You couldn't use poison bullets, or bullets with mercury inside that releases on impact, or anything like that. It violates geneva convention.   These look like modern bullets, created after the clause that would make it illegal was signed.   Armour is a bit different, but it should be illegal as well imo, because if it becomes shrapnel on impact it can poison your own soldiers.

Ammunition of article  Depleted uranium:       Most military use of depleted uranium has been as 30 mm caliber ordnance, primarily the 30 mm PGU-14/B armour-piercing incendiary round from the GAU-8 Avenger cannon of the A-10 Thunderbolt II used by the United States Air Force. 25 mm DU rounds have been used in the M242 gun mounted on the U.S. Army's Bradley Fighting Vehicle and the Marine Corps's LAV-25.  The U.S. Marine Corps uses DU in the 25 mm PGU-20 round fired by the GAU-12 Equalizer cannon of the AV-8B Harrier, and also in the 20 mm M197 gun mounted on AH-1 Cobra helicopter gunships. The United States Navy's Phalanx CIWS's M61 Vulcan Gatling gun used 20 mm armor-piercing penetrator rounds with discarding plastic sabots made using depleted uranium, later changed to tungsten.  Another use of depleted uranium is in kinetic energy penetrators, anti-armor rounds such as the 120 mm sabot rounds fired from the British Challenger 1, Challenger 2,  M1A1 and M1A2 Abrams.  Kinetic energy penetrator rounds consist of a long, relatively thin penetrator surrounded by a discarding sabot. Staballoys are metal alloys of depleted uranium with a very small proportion of other metals, usually titanium or molybdenum. One formulation has a composition of 99.25% by mass of depleted uranium and 0.75% by mass of titanium. Staballoys are approximately 1.67 times as dense as lead and are designed for use in kinetic energy penetrator armor-piercing ammunition. The US Army uses DU in an alloy with around 3.5% titanium.

In essence, charges lying next to the trajectory of the particle ar either repelled (same sign) or attracted (opposite signs) to the moving charge. The chemical mixture in the chamber is chosen such that this motion of particles translates into a local change in refractive index significant enough that you see the trail.  You can do all sorts of particle detection with cloud chambers. Add a magnet to the setup and you can even determine the masses and charges of the particles!"

chemicalreactiongifs,2y5u6g,DavidJMichaels,28,Fri Mar 6 19:36:37 2015 UTC,"So, wikipedia's explanation is that cloud chambers are filled with supersaturated vapor (water or alcohol) and when a charged particle ionizes the vapor, it creates nucleation points around which the vapor immediately condenses (since it's supersaturated) to briefly form a mist."
chemicalreactiongifs,2y5u6g,Cerealkillr95,4,Fri Mar 6 19:59:09 2015 UTC,"Cloud chamber:       The cloud chamber, also known as the Wilson chamber, is a particle detector used for detecting ionizing radiation.  In its most basic form, a cloud chamber is a sealed environment containing a supersaturated vapor of water or alcohol. When a charged particle (for example, an alpha or beta particle) interacts with the mixture, the fluid is ionized. The resulting ions act as condensation nuclei, around which a mist will form (because the mixture is on the point of condensation). The high energies of alpha and beta particles mean that a trail is left, due to many ions being produced along the path of the charged particle. These tracks have distinctive shapes (for example, an alpha particle's track is broad and shows more evidence of deflection by collisions, while an electron's is thinner and straight). When any uniform magnetic field is applied across the cloud chamber, positively and negatively charged particles will curve in opposite directions, according to the Lorentz force law with two particles of opposite charge.  Cloud chambers played a prominent role in the experimental particle physics from 1920s to the 1950s, until the advent of the bubble chamber. In particular, the discoveries of the positron in 1932, the Muon in 1936, both by Carl Anderson (awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936), and the kaon in 1947 were made using cloud chambers as detectors. Anderson detected the positron and muon in cosmic rays.    Image i - Cloud chamber with visible tracks from ionizing radiation (short, thick: α-particles; long, thin: β-particles).

If I recalled correctly, the ones I worked with so far were a mixture of dry ice and isopropyl or something similar. Dry ice is important since it condensates fairly well at room temperature, but mixing it with the isopropyl prevents the chamber from being too...cloudy (so you only see the condensation along the trails of ionization)."

chemicalreactiongifs,2y5u6g,RunningWarrior,2,Fri Mar 6 20:50:04 2015 UTC,"The description on the video explains it like this (I'm in no position to evaluate it but it sounds reasonable):   With time, the alcohol condense on the mineral. The small thickness of liquid alcohol on the mineral is enough to absorb a part of the energy of the alpha particles (their ranges in air for 5 MeV is 3-4 cm, but in water, it's 15 micrometer),"
chemicalreactiongifs,2y5u6g,MysteriousMrBond,1 point,Fri Mar 6 22:19:37 2015 UTC,"I think it's because, eventually, the charged particles will have deposited enough energy in the medium that you can no longer see the condensation trails. The ionization itself is not something permanent - a short while after the particle has passed through, there's no more charge to disrupt the electric field, so the ionized particles go back to normal (that's why the trails disappear)."

However if you drop the source into a box filled with supersaturated alcohol vapor (which is more or less all a cloud chamber is), as the radiation travels, the vapor is ionized along the path.

When the battery ruptures, the electrolyte escapes it is now exposed to O2 in the air and heat from the shorting of the battery.

chemicalreactiongifs,2xokhi,Zylooox,403,Mon Mar 2 16:40:44 2015 UTC,"This is actually a neat combination of a physical and chemical reaction from what I have seen. The oil is already at a pretty high temperature, considering that it is already on fire (one part of the chemical reactions observed here). The water, though small in volume in liquid form, has a big impact because when it is poured into that hot oil it rushes to the bottom of the pot (water and oil don't mix well as some may know). This has the effect placing the water in high temperatures under the oil, where it rapidly turns to steam (physical reaction). This quick change and increase in space the water takes up pushes some oil and fire outward where it proceeds to react with a lot of oxygen in the air, where a classic combustion reaction takes place and you get that huge fireball. So that rapid expansion and reaction with air gives you a deadly and fiery explosion."
chemicalreactiongifs,2xokhi,MitchB3,21,Mon Mar 2 17:05:10 2015 UTC,"Would this also happen when you pour the water in unheates oil and then light it? If not, what is different?"
chemicalreactiongifs,2xokhi,Jimmy_Smith,51,Mon Mar 2 18:23:34 2015 UTC,I don't think so because it wouldn't be at such a high temperature so as the water evaporates it would have time to escape through the oil instead of the entire volume of water evaporating in such a small amount of time.

chemicalreactiongifs,2xokhi,sarge21,9,Tue Mar 3 06:21:19 2015 UTC,"If you were to do this as you describe then I don't think the result would be as violent as you see in this gif. The water and oil still don't mix well regardless of the starting temperature, and I'm sure that the water would get really hot along with the oil, but you would really be missing the component that is making what is seen in the gif so explosive. When you pour that water in the flaming oil it rushes to the bottom and very quickly turns to steam. The speed of that change generates a lot of outward force that pushes the contents of that pot outward and lets it react even more with the air.  I don't doubt that you could get some really hot water and flaming oil if you mix them before hand but I don't think it would be explosive. The order is key in this reaction. I'm not 100% sure though so more viewpoints are welcome."
chemicalreactiongifs,2xokhi,MitchB3,2,Mon Mar 2 18:32:03 2015 UTC,"I was thinking flaming oil is instant heat. That's why I was thinking of the same reaction. However, thr water warms up through conduction through the oil, which takes time indeed.  I'd like to turn to experimental data, but I think I'll call in the safetycard for this one."
chemicalreactiongifs,2xokhi,Jimmy_Smith,6,Mon Mar 2 21:29:59 2015 UTC,"Water boils at 212F the reason it is a hazard is the oil might be at 600F so when you pour water in, it instantly boils off and when water boils, increases in volume about 1000x. That volume increase sprays oil everywhere and small particles of oil with access to oxygen burn.  Oil will not boil so this will not happen pouring oil into water. There are some changes in boiling point due to the mixture of I remember correctly, but extremely minor.  Water into cold oil will boil slowly and the same expansion will spray hot oil at you. Why you defrost/dry a turkey before you fry it."

If you want to try this out, the next time you're at a beach bonfire or something similar (where there's nothing else flammable around - don't do this at a forest campground), throw a handful of flour into the air above the fire, being sure to disperse it widely and not in a solid clump.

Really?"
chemicalreactiongifs,2xokhi,compto35,3,Mon Mar 2 20:44:21 2015 UTC,"No.  But that was always the official advice from firefighters here in the UK. I'm pretty sure there was a reason for not using the lid too (but I forget what it was).  Also, the reason for using a wet towel was that a) it wouldn't catch fire itself and b) it'd suffocate the flames. Thing is, there were recorded cases of people just throwing a dry towel over fires, then wondering why it did make it worse. Depending on what the fire is in, you might not have a lid for it anyway - not all chip pans have lids, or it could be a frying pan fire.  I suppose the risk of making things worse, however, explains the change in stance they've taken in more recent years - not something I was wholly aware of until now, tbh."
chemicalreactiongifs,2xokhi,KingDaveRa,1 point,Mon Mar 2 20:49:29 2015 UTC,"The water didn't catch on fire, it's not flammable. It spread the fire because of the method of introduction - under the grease, flash to steam.

It was actually the day the fire marshal was coming to make sure that everything was good for the business.   I remember getting up early that day to go to a friend's house for something. I walked into the kitchen and saw a small pot on the stove smoking. So, like an idiot, I opened the pot to see what was in it. Fire was in it... Or at least it was as soon as I gave it oxygen. I can clearly recall thinking 'Oh shit, fire is put out with water.'  I walked to the sink and grabbed a big measuring cup and filled up like four cups of sink water. Then I flung it at the pot. It did pretty much exactly what's in the gif. It set the back wall on fire above the stove. I was so stunned that the water had created more fire that I just stood there staring at it. Luckily my mom was nearby and grabbed the fire extinguisher and put it out.   It probably all occurred in a total of thirty seconds, but the house smelled like smoke for a month, and there was like half an inch of ash on everything for a while.   I left before the fire marshal got there, but mom said that he thought it was pretty hilarious that we had a fire the day of his inspection. The shop passed."

(I used to work for a company that sold commercial kitchen range hoods with built-in water-spray fire suppression systems.)  The trick is to have a nozzle in the right place, spraying a high volume of water in a cone that surrounds the fryer without the stream hitting the oil.  This reduces oxygen flow to the fire, providing a smothering action. The other thing the nozzle has to do is produce a very fine mist inside the cone, that will flash to steam before it hits the surface of the oil, cooling the fire environment. Done properly, it attacks two legs of the fire triangle (fuel-oxygen-heat) and will contain or suppress the fire.   Done improperly, everyone has a Really Bad Day."

chemicalreactiongifs,2xku4p,Jedyates,30,Sun Mar 1 20:34:16 2015 UTC,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_permanganate  Here we have a pretty rapid reaction between Hydrogen Peroxide and Potassium Permanganate. The idea behind this demonstration is to take a solution of water, permanganate and sulfuric acid and pour some strong hydrogen peroxide into it. Permanganate has a very distinct purple color when in a solution, and thus would have made the solution of it, water and sulfuric acid purple. Hydrogen peroxide would then be poured into the solution, react with the permanganate and de-colorize the solution.   The reason why it would turn clear is because as hydrogen peroxide meets the permangante, the manganese bound to the oxygen in permangante would react and in turn lose its oxygen. This releases just manganese ions which have no color. An indicator that this is happening would be an introduction of oxygen bubbles and the hydrogen peroxide and permanganate meet each other.    If you look again at the reaction you see that the solution did not go from purple to clear and instead was clear and essentially ""erased"" any of the purple solution that was poured into it. This is because of an accident in the experiment. They had tried the original method before hand but the purple color of the solution was not being reversed when the hydrogen peroxide was poured in, so they attempted to try again. Instead they had a solution of the water and sulfuric acid with some residual peroxide, and when they poured in the permangante it began reacting very quickly and immediately. The reason for the color change is the same as above, just the order is not the same as it is normally done in this demonstration. In the source video you can see afterwards the oxygen bubbles are being release from the reaction between permanganate and hydrogen peroxide, meaning that manganese ions are being introduced to the solution."

In taxidermy, H202 is often used for bleaching antlers that were still partly in velvet, it's usually a pretty high concentration like 30%. We also used Potassium Permanganate powder mixed with water as a stain for bleached antlers.   Now normally, the antlers are well washed after being bleached but one day, I was at the shop alone and had a mess of caribou antlers that I was working on, some needed to be bleached, some needed staining/painting. I had no idea at the time that these two chemicals reacted like this with eachother. I had unknowingly spilled some of the Potassium Permanganate granules on my table and set a glass of H202 next to it which slopped a little.

At that point, it is possible to change all of the substance to ice, water, or vapor by making arbitrarily small changes in pressure and temperature. Even if the total pressure of a system is well above triple point of water, provided the partial pressure of the water vapor is 611.73 pascals then the system can still be brought to the triple point of water.

What is happening is that the pressure in the flask is being changed rapidly so the states are able to change so quickly that you can see these changes in state happen simultaneously. I believe it is possible to have some triple points where there is actually no change in state really, like you can have liquids not freeze and solids not melt, but that is very difficult to achieve, especially in a glass flask as see here.

chemicalreactiongifs,2xhw9q,StoneHolder28,9,Sun Mar 1 04:15:03 2015 UTC,"In a glass of ice water, you have an almost one directional exchange of ice to water to water vapor. Given enough time, the ice will melt, and the water will evaporate. You won't see the level of water rise, nor will an ice cube sprout up by itself. In the conditions shown in the gif, that is exactly what can happen at any point and at any time. In addition, ice will more often sublimate into vapor and vapor will more often condense directly into ice."
chemicalreactiongifs,2xhw9q,Compizfox,6,Sun Mar 1 08:33:55 2015 UTC,"No, at the triple point of water you would have boiling water with ice cubes in it.  You can have liquid water with ice cubes in it at ~1 bar and 0 °C, but no vapor phase can exist at these conditions."

chemicalreactiongifs,2xhw9q,apierson2011,3,Sat Feb 28 22:58:52 2015 UTC,"What is meant by ""all of these phases can exist at this temperature and pressure"" is that each phase of that substance exists in an equilibrium. So, unlike when you have ice water, the ice at the triple point is not melting, the liquid water is not freezing, and the vapor is not condensing at a rate that would change the overall composition of the matter. The ice in ice water will eventually melt. Ice at the triple point will not eventually melt, as long as the temperature and pressure are held constant. Hopefully that clears things up a little.  Also, if anyone knows more specific terminology, I know my explanation may not be technically completely correct, please feel free to chime in. I meant this as a bit more of an ELI5 version."
chemicalreactiongifs,2xhw9q,Compizfox,1 point,Sat Feb 28 23:30:04 2015 UTC,"The ice in ice water will eventually melt.   Small correction: ice in ice water will not melt at 1 bar and 0 °C. It is in the same kind of equilibrium as ice, water and vapor at the triple point."
chemicalreactiongifs,2xhw9q,Compizfox,1 point,Sun Mar 1 01:41:42 2015 UTC,"That's a good question. Maybe there's a more obvious explanation for this, but my understanding is that water evaporating at pressures above the vapor pressure of the liquid is not really 'boiling'.  All liquids have some evaporation at pressures above the vapor pressure because not all molecules of the liquid have the same velocity. The fastest molecules, if they are at the surface, will actually have enough energy to detach from the surface and become vapor. This is what is happening when water evaporates at 1 bar and < 100 °C.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation  However, this is not the same as what is happening at the triple point. At the triple point, the system is at exactly the phase transition temperature/pressure for boiling/condensation (think of water @ 1 bar and 100 °C), but at the same time it is also at the phase transition temperature/pressure for freezing/melting (think of water @ 1 bar and 0 °C). Both these things are happening at the same time, so you will have freezing boiling water and you can have ice, liquid water and water vapor at the same time, in equilibrium.  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg/2000px-Phase_diagram_of_water.svg.png"
chemicalreactiongifs,2xhw9q,MitchB3,3,Sun Mar 1 02:32:48 2015 UTC,"No, in the example you are suggesting the ice will eventually melt and become liquid water. In this gif it is actually just one solution constantly changing states rapidly due to pressure and it will continue to do that (so it is possible to have all 3 states at the same time) not trend towards one state like in the glass of ice water.  The solution in this gif is not water by the way, it is Cyclohexane. I'm unsure if it is even possible to get water to a triple point, it has been awhile since I checked.  Edit: What I was actually thinking about was the critical point, not the triple point, that is more difficult to achieve with water. In a critical point you can make water into a superfluid with some really weird properties: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_point_%28thermodynamics%29"

You are correct in this, but in the post above, we're talking about boiling.   There's always some water molecules escaping the surface, but boiling is when this happens inside the water.   I'm no PhD, but know that there's a difference between water evaporating and water boiling."

I'm not qualified to answer with certainty, but I can give some perspective:  Either:  1) Nothing since your finger isn't a ferrous metal. For the same reason a sheet of aluminum in there would do nothing. Only ferroelectric metals respond to magnetism. That's why someone with a titanium back fusion can sit in an MRI machine and not get ripped to shreds, yet a chick with a nipple piercing would blow holes in her boobs.  2) There is a caveat. I'm not a bio-engineer, so ask one. But your blood has iron in it, and that might respond to the tune of terrible consequences. But those iron bits might have such a low area for magnetic lines to go through that the amount of heating they can absorb for a given wave is dwarfed by the huge heat capacity of water (read: your blood)."

The advantage of the induction furnace is a clean, energy-efficient and well-controllable melting process compared to most other means of metal melting. Most modern foundries use this type of furnace and now also more iron foundries are replacing cupolas with induction furnaces to melt cast iron, as the former emit lots of dust and other pollutants.  Induction furnace capacities range from less than one kilogram to one hundred tonnes capacity and are used to melt iron and steel, copper, aluminium and precious metals. Since no arc or combustion is used, the temperature of the material is no higher than required to melt it; this can prevent loss of valuable alloying elements.  The one major drawback to induction furnace usage in a foundry is the lack of refining capacity; charge materials must be clean of oxidation products and of a known composition and some alloying elements may be lost due to oxidation (and must be re-added to the melt).

chemicalreactiongifs,2x7xef,falcongsr,3,Thu Feb 26 12:44:41 2015 UTC,Right. The whole reason the blade got hot is that the current induced in it has to flow through much higher resistance than the copper coil. IR losses.

chemicalreactiongifs,2x7xef,sfurbo,15,Thu Feb 26 14:47:34 2015 UTC,"Probably not. Inductive heating is much more effective for ferromagnetic materials. Once it hits the Curie point, the heating slows down enormously.  You can use this to make fast heating very repeatable. This makes it useful for e.g. analysis of polymers by pyrolysis:  One way to analyse polymers is to first break them down into smaller molecule. One way to do this is to heat them up (pyrolysis). However, since the amount of different molecules depends on the temperature, it is important that the same temperature is used each time, and that the heating is fast. Otherwise, you can't compare different materials. These two objectives are hard to reach simultaneously. However, it can be done: If you add a ferromagnetic wire to the sample and heats it inductively, the sample will quickly be heated to the Curie point of the wire, but not above, meaning that the pyrolysis gives repeatable breakdown products."

The force of magnetism is determined by magnetic moments.  The Curie temperature is the critical point where a material's intrinsic magnetic moments change direction. Magnetic moments are permanent dipole moments within the atom which originate from electrons' angular momentum and spin. Materials have different structures of intrinsic magnetic moments that depend on temperature. At a material's Curie Temperature those intrinsic magnetic moments change direction.  Permanent magnetism is caused by the alignment of magnetic moments and induced magnetism is created when disordered magnetic moments are forced to align in an applied magnetic field. For example, the ordered magnetic moments (ferromagnetic, figure 1) change and become disordered (paramagnetic, figure 2) at the Curie Temperature.

We made like 4 batches, kept them about a foot apart from each other (small amounts, much smaller than this). We set one off, then the rest went off either from the shockwave or heat. It also caused tiny explosions as we cleaned the equipment. That stuff is extremely unstable."
chemicalreactiongifs,2x5jnq,OverlordQuasar,8,Wed Feb 25 23:27:32 2015 UTC,"I recently made a couple batches to show a class.  First one went fine, but the rest went off spontaneously while I was talking, probably from a gust of air.  Extremely unstable indeed."
chemicalreactiongifs,2x5jnq,noxumida,5,Wed Feb 25 23:38:46 2015 UTC,"Isn't it because, in addition to having nitrogen, the Iodine atoms are repelling each other because their electron cloud is so much large than that of the nitrogen?"
chemicalreactiongifs,2x5jnq,OverlordQuasar,4,Wed Feb 25 23:47:20 2015 UTC,Yeah. The nitrogen wants to be bonded with stuff at a certain angle. Since the iodine atoms are so large they push each other away and go against the sweet spot that is the nitrogen bond angle. This causes a whole bunch of instability which makes it very easy to react with just a little extra energy.

chemicalreactiongifs,2x3evr,RufusMcCoot,13,Wed Feb 25 15:03:13 2015 UTC,"Edit: Changed to Physics + Chemistry. It is a catch all description but just note that no meaningful chemical interaction is being shown between the firecracker and the rubber band. The gif displays a chemical reaction's energy output and the effect of that force on a dense mass of rubber bands.  Thanks for the link, it's a very detailed write up. I flaired this vague content because I'm not really sure what is the purpose of the demonstration in the gif. Not sure how to categorize it. I understand quite well about how fireworks work from a chemical stand point, but why is this gif showing a firework get detonated inside of a large ball of rubber bands. There must be some reason for that combination but the reason evades me so I'm not sure if it fits well within our established categories.  If you see something else in this gif that I'm not seeing let me know. Why the rubber bands and fireworks together? Would you call what is happening in this gif a chemical reaction, physical, demonstrating a chemical property or physics concept? The gif is interesting but it is hard for me to answer these questions which I think of when flairing things."
chemicalreactiongifs,2x3evr,MitchB3,11,Wed Feb 25 15:52:09 2015 UTC,"If I had to pick, I'd choose physical reaction, seeing as how the main focus of the gif seems to be on the elasticity of the rubber bands."
chemicalreactiongifs,2x3evr,StoneHolder28,4,Wed Feb 25 16:09:03 2015 UTC,"If it is demonstrating elasticity then I'd say it would be categorized as a physics gif, since that falls more closely under that school of thought. Elasticity is a topic that is much more suited for /r/physicsgifs, not here in my opinion as opposed to the other types we are willing to allow."
chemicalreactiongifs,2x3evr,MitchB3,3,Wed Feb 25 16:15:16 2015 UTC,"It's also demonstrating the chemical energy contained within a firework, using the work it's doing against the rubber bands (by exploding).  Dunno if you want to count that as chemistry or a chemistry-based physics demonstration, though."
chemicalreactiongifs,2x3evr,myWorkAccount840,1 point,Wed Feb 25 17:00:45 2015 UTC,This is an interesting interpretation. I'll see if I can find the source of this gif. You are right that this is a physics and chemistry cross section but if the goal was to see how the composition of the firework affected the energy output that would be good to know.
chemicalreactiongifs,2x3evr,MitchB3,2,Wed Feb 25 17:49:46 2015 UTC,Source I don't think it was as much a formal experiment to observe one thing or another specifically more just lets explode this rubber band ball and film it in slow motion. They do a bunch of similar things on their channel and the slow-mo is pretty much the whole shtick.
chemicalreactiongifs,2x3evr,Mkap3334,2,Wed Feb 25 19:12:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the source. Albeit an interesting looking gif, it appears that there isn't much substance to the experiment. However at least some good discussion came out of it. The firework exploding is clearly a chemical reaction however not much can be said with the combination between it and the rubber bands regarding an interaction between their chemical make up. I'll change the flair to something a bit more descriptive based on the discussion here but still I hope people don't assume some reaction is occurring between the rubber bands and firework.  It would be interesting to see how much force is output by the firework and how such a dense mass of rubber bands is affected by that, but that is a better discussion for /r/physicsgifs."
chemicalreactiongifs,2x3evr,MitchB3,1 point,Wed Feb 25 20:33:43 2015 UTC,"Edit: Changed to Physics + Chemistry. It is a catch all description but just note that no meaningful chemical interaction is being shown between the firecracker and the rubber band. The gif displays a chemical reaction's energy output and the effect of that force on a dense mass of rubber bands.  Because its not clear what exactly should be observed in this gif. It is fairly interesting looking but are they doing this to observe a reaction between the combustion of the firework and the material in the rubber band, or are they observing how this force of the rubber bands effects the behavior of the explosion. The first example could be a chemical reaction but the second is on the side of a gif demonstrating a physics concept.   So whereas most gifs here are a bit more self-explanatory, this one isn't in my opinion at least. If someone could explain the purpose of this demonstration that would help with how we categorize this post. It doesn't fit well in any of our other established categories."

chemicalreactiongifs,2x3evr,Timelord2,1 point,Wed Feb 25 14:09:05 2015 UTC,How loud is it?  Is sound concentrated and funneled out the fuse hole or do the bands absorb more than reflect?  Mic the hole and mic the sides.  Then mic the same area of an uncontained firework and measure.
chemicalreactiongifs,2x3evr,jiannone,1 point,Wed Feb 25 16:17:27 2015 UTC,"From the source video they do two trials, one with the firecracker completely submerged (which this gif is from) and another with the head of the firecracker above the mass of rubber bands. In the latter example it doesn't seem like the sound is that impaired and seems like how a regular firecracker detonation would sound.  In the one from the gif it is hard to tell as they don't include real time footage of the detonation seen in the gif. I'd say it would sound a bit similar however possibly a bit lower in volume, as some of the sound would be absorbed in the rubber bands."

chemicalreactiongifs,2x27gz,Tathix,5,Wed Feb 25 11:27:32 2015 UTC,"One lab I was in previously had a large ventilation system that ran along the entire ceiling, and the fume hoods were really only used when something was extremely dangerous on contact.

chemicalreactiongifs,2x27gz,im_a_blue_monkey,17,Wed Feb 25 14:19:18 2015 UTC,"First of all: fire, it's might light other things on fire. That is usually the least of your worries.   The main danger are the fumes. Most fires will give off a fair amount of carcinogens, smoke and other toxic chemicals. You don't want to inhale them and keeping them all in a small room is a bad idea. A fume hood would be better. Outside is also like a big giant fume hood if you keep your distance.   If he had put a bit in a dish, inside a fume hood and lit it on fire he would have been fine. This, however, is asking for trouble. I can't imagine any circumstances that a lab supervisor would be okay with this."

So its not very hard to do

chemicalreactiongifs,2x010a,yum_strawberries,2,Tue Feb 24 21:47:50 2015 UTC,"It would turn to ice after hitting them, so the initial impact would hurt about as much as getting hit with a room temperature water bottle. The second impact of the bottle, whether thrown, or just held while beating them would be roughly equivalent to hitting them in the face with a rock.

Wood graduated with a BS from Case Western Reserve University and an MSEE from Stanford.  He was Employee No. 6 at Microsoft, but in 1980 one of the first original employees to leave, after his wife Marla Wood,  then a bookkeeper, for Microsoft organized the non-exempt employees and filed an overtime pay dispute (later settled) against the company. He remained close to Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and they joined together in various technology ventures. Wood held jobs with Asymetrix, Starwave, Interval Research, McCaw Cellular and Notable Technologies.

chemicalreactiongifs,2wjh6g,St0kka,8,Tue Mar 3 20:23:22 2015 UTC,"If you have a look at the sucrose molecule that cane sugar is entirely composed of, you'll notice that there are many OH (a.k.a. ""hydroxyl"") groups attached. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid which means it will forcibly ""protonate"" those hydroxyl groups i.e. a hydrogen atom will be transferred from the former to the latter. All of a sudden, the oxygen atoms in the hydroxyl groups have too many bonds and will get rid of the one that results in the most stable product. In this case it's water, the hydrogen sulfate anion (what's left of sulfuric acid after it's protonated something), and charcoal (the carbon backbone of sucrose). This is a very exothermic (heat producing) process which is why you see all that steam coming off the charcoal. There are also other byproducts like sulfur trioxide which make the fumes poisonous, hence why the experiment was performed outside."

Saccharose is an obsolete name for sugars in general, especially sucrose.  The molecule is a disaccharide combination of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose with the formula C12H22O11.  A white, odorless, crystalline powder with a sweet taste, it is best known for its role in food. About 175 million metric tons of sucrose sugar were produced worldwide in 2013.   The word ""sucrose"" was coined in 1857 by the English chemist William Miller  from the French sucre (""sugar"") and the generic chemical suffix for sugars -ose. The abbreviated term Suc is often used for sucrose in scientific literature.

However if it seems as if you can condense this into an easily viewed gif, do so.  Please read our sidebar for more information on posting gifs. If it is possible, then make the video into a gif and upload it to imgur or you can directly turn it into an html5 video via gfycat and resubmit or post the updated gif as a comment (gfycat is often better than gifs so please consider using that).

I worked there at the time and got it for free because they didn't care about what happened to it, they would just throw it out back and let it evaporate.  After lots of experimenting we soon found out Gatorade bottles were the best due to their thick plastic hulls along with the lid.  They held the most pressure and made the biggest explosion!  We ended trying to kill fish with these so we got a clay brick with three holes and some string that we tied to the bottle.  We threaded the string through one of the holes on the brick and toss the brick into the water while keeping the bottle in hand.  After the brick had sunk we would fill it half full with water and drop several ice cube sized chunks of dry ice in there, screw the cap on and pull the bottle underwater.  It was pretty cool to see the gas bubble reach the surface but we never killed any fish or sunk any submarines. :/"

Just get a bunch of materials, mix stuff, take pictures. If you make the effort to experiment you will start to find things worthy of a shot.  Liquids for mixing: milk, any clear oil, food colouring, ink, paint  Lights: multi-coloured LED bulbs (ebay), strip lights, EL wire, glow sticks, lasers  Other stuff: camera, tripod, trays, stirrers, eye droppers/pipettes, random stuff.  If you can manage to get most of this stuff together its just a matter of thinking how you might combine them and observing their properties together. For example, I recently worked out how to turn Indian ink into bubbles which I then shine a UV laser through at an angle resulting in a moving plasma like projection. Looks amazing but I have yet to work out how to photograph it properly."

There are polar substances and nonpolar(amongst other) and polar substances together mix whilst polar and nonpolar don't(olive oil and vinegar for example). In this case alcohol(polar) makes the coloring(polar) ""mix"" and the nonpolar oil(?) repels. The speed of the dissociation(mix) and repel depends on the properties of the solute/ solvent(alcohol/coloring), sometimes it can have a more drastic effect like the video and sometimes it can take quite a while for the dissipation."

chemicalreactiongifs,2w9mci,MexicanGameboy,2,Wed Feb 18 06:59:30 2015 UTC,"Thermochromism is a property some substances can have which involves them changing color when a change in temperature is introduced (thus thermo for temperature and chromism for color).  Now there are actually quite a few types of ways this property can be observed and I think this is one of the reasons why it is good to allow physical reactions here because something like this can promote good discussion. I wouldn't fault most people to think this is a chemical reaction but in this case of thermochromism it actually isn't because these compounds will return to their original color when they are at room temperature. From reading the blog from the post it is clear that since it can revert back to that state that this is a physical reaction as the compounds chemical makeup isn't being changed, but it is a very interesting reaction nonetheless. However I am sure there are types of thermochromism that involve a chemical change and you can read about them here."

chemicalreactiongifs,2w4h88,lurco_purgo,10,Tue Feb 17 06:28:11 2015 UTC,"Heat of dilution is melting the sponge. I don't think the acid is actually reacting with it, just generating heat from mixing with the water."

chemicalreactiongifs,2w4h88,icheah,1 point,Tue Feb 17 03:28:29 2015 UTC,"If you look at OPs source video, the sponge IS dry. So, we actually need a sponge with water in it."
chemicalreactiongifs,2w4h88,ydnab2,6,Tue Feb 17 04:24:23 2015 UTC,"I think OP didn't understand what the chemical reaction is.  Sulfuric acid is dehydrating the cellulose.  Literally ripping the cellulose carbohydrate apart to grab that hydrate and leave the carbon behind.  That's why it turns black.  So it is 'reacting to a water saturated sponge' only in the chemical sense that carbohydrates are made of carbon and water.  (Cellulose is a polymer of glucose).  If there is liquid water in the sponge I would imagine its role is as a wetting agent, to assure most rapid contact between the sulfuric acid and the cellulose."

chemicalreactiongifs,2w0l8g,TheDoctorEngineer,43,Mon Feb 16 02:21:03 2015 UTC,"my guess is that because there is no outside air-pressure, the air inside of the marshmallow can expand as much as it wants.   Same with a balloon in a vacuum"
chemicalreactiongifs,2w0l8g,yopeasants,7,Sun Feb 15 23:24:41 2015 UTC,"this is correct, note how it returns to original size in the third gifv."
chemicalreactiongifs,2w0l8g,innitgrand,14,Sun Feb 15 23:31:31 2015 UTC,"The marshmallow has lots of tiny air bubbles trapped inside. If you lower the outside pressure (by sucking the atmosphere out of the canister), the trapped air can expand the whole marshmallow because the outside atmosphere isn't compressing it anymore."
chemicalreactiongifs,2w0l8g,NOBBLES,2,Mon Feb 16 00:27:17 2015 UTC,Most things seem to compress when air is removed. Think space bags
chemicalreactiongifs,2w0l8g,TF87,7,Sun Feb 15 23:33:49 2015 UTC,"Space bags work because the lack of air forces the bag to compress around the contents. If you put the same contents in a non-compressible chamber, they'd usually either stay the same size or expand if air is trapped inside (assuming the outside isn't rigid.)"

chemicalreactiongifs,2w0l8g,neoaikon,4,Sun Feb 15 23:33:15 2015 UTC,Why does the marshmallow not continue to expand to fill the entire container?
chemicalreactiongifs,2w0l8g,totes_meta_bot,16,Mon Feb 16 01:02:45 2015 UTC,"Incomplete vacuum perhaps. Often these things would go to about 100 mbar. It's just a wild guess based on the fact that most vacuum pumps in our chemistry lab went to 14 mbar.  Also the marshmallow itself provides tension and prevents complete inflation.  Maybe the air escapes slightly from the marshmallow, keeping in expanded as the air seeps out.   Most likely it's a combination of these things."
chemicalreactiongifs,2w0l8g,Sifraxus,6,Mon Feb 16 01:15:47 2015 UTC,the fact it shrank back to original size indicates that it was probably just a poor vacuum. A stronger vacuum will destroy the bubbles in the marshmallow and it will go all wrinkly when the vacuum is released.

chemicalreactiongifs,2vlagd,idontknowwhatimdooin,46,Thu Feb 12 00:49:44 2015 UTC,It can be used to make fluorinated molecules like teflon and to scare the shit out of chemists.
chemicalreactiongifs,2vlagd,IntegralTree,7,Thu Feb 12 01:11:52 2015 UTC,"It is used a lot in semiconductor manufacturing.  If you want to have a layer of silicon dioxide (an insulator and one of the main components of glass) on some parts of a silicon wafer, the entire surface is oxidized using some other chemicals and then the unwanted parts are stripped away with HF."
chemicalreactiongifs,2vlagd,dooglehead,2,Thu Feb 12 07:48:43 2015 UTC,"the entire surface is oxidized using some other chemicals   Si will oxidise ""naturally"" (there is probably a proper chemist term for it) if some oxygen is around. This is usually enough for the application and the oxidization rate can be increased by increasing the heat or in water. Although the oxide produced by the latter is not as good.  For special applications you can deposit SiO2 by, e.g., CVD though."
chemicalreactiongifs,2vlagd,the-fritz,10,Thu Feb 12 12:15:08 2015 UTC,"TLDR: I've used it to etch away silica (glass) in the interest of making structured materials.  Basically, it is well known how to synthesize many interesting shapes of silica even at micron length scales. If you happen to want to make something that is structured at that length scale (lets say a battery electrode), you start by making the inverse of the shape you want out of silica. Next, you add precursors to your electrode material and heat it up so that your precursors react and the material is formed in the empty spaces within the silica. Silica is a nice material to use as a template because it is stable at relatively high temperatures and when exposed to most chemicals. So how do you remove the silica template if it is stable to heat and most chemicals? HF (hydrofluoric acid)  There are many other applications for it, but it is usually used to dissolve or react away something pretty stable."

chemicalreactiongifs,2vlagd,Smelbe,12,Thu Feb 12 01:51:45 2015 UTC,"It's used extensively in what's called microfabrication (ie making circuit chips and MEMS devices). Nearly all integrated circuits start with a Silicon wafer. When you put this wafer in a hot oven with oxygen, it grows Silicon dioxide (glass) on its surface. The HF is then used to etch away small areas of the Silicon dioxide so that the Silicon below is exposed. This basic procedure of growing Silicon dioxide and then removing select areas allows for the creation of transistors and the like for ICs!"

chemicalreactiongifs,2vlagd,JoeViturbo,2,Thu Feb 12 17:00:29 2015 UTC,"When processing uranium for nuclear energy UO2 is converted to UF6 by reaction with hydrofluoric acid. They have to use HF instead of HCl because fluorine is monoisotopic (there is only one stable isotope and therefore the mass of a fluorine molecule is constant) whereas the mass of chlorine can vary. The UF6 then goes off for further processing where the lighter molecules are enriched.  Now, as the fluorine is monoisotopic, the difference in mass of the UF6 molecules must be due to the difference in mass of uranium and have nothing to do with the fluorine. This is the case as the most common type of uranium is U-238 while the useful, fissile material is U-235.  This is necessary as only (currently) U-235 can be used for nuclear energy generation."

In a real survival situation i wouldn't count on a battery lying around for a long time to work like that. 9volts were originally  designed for small currents in powering radios and smoke detectors and stuff, they dont have the amps like a camera flash battery or even just AA  If you take a 9 volt apart its actually 6 aaaa batteries, half the size of a aaa battery which is half an aa battery"

The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) adopted aluminium as the standard international name for the element in 1990 but, three years later, recognized aluminum as an acceptable variant. Hence their periodic table includes both.  IUPAC internal publications use either spelling in nearly the same number.   Most countries use the spelling aluminium. In the United States and Canada, the spelling aluminum predominates.   The Canadian Oxford Dictionary prefers aluminum, whereas the Australian Macquarie Dictionary prefers aluminium. In 1926, the American Chemical Society officially decided to use aluminum in its publications; American dictionaries typically label the spelling aluminium as ""chiefly British"".    The various names all derive from its status as a base of alum. It is borrowed from Old French; its ultimate source, alumen, in turn is a Latin word that literally means ""bitter salt"".

We'd like to remind everyone that they are allowed in this subreddit, however some people with slower internet connections may not see them as easily (or some may just prefer gifs).  Not all videos translate easily into gif format, so if that is the case please by all means leave this video (once again, we explicitly do allow videos but prefer gifs). However if it seems as if you can condense this into an easily viewed gif, do so.  Please read our sidebar for more information on posting gifs. If it is possible, then make the video into a gif and upload it to imgur or you can directly turn it into an html5 video via gfycat and resubmit or post the updated gif as a comment (gfycat is often better than gifs so please consider using that).  For future reference, you can always post a video and have a gif link in the comments of the special moment in question. Some videos have very good explanations of reactions so it is not a bad idea to post them along with the gif.  I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

chemicalreactiongifs,2uo0jd,GG_Henry,76,Tue Feb 3 21:05:13 2015 UTC,"You need to heat the surface to at least about 200°C to start to get the effect, so it would probably be a fairly inefficient means of generating power.

I also struggle to see many benefits over solar panels for it- keeping the mirrors aligned is a pain in the ass and I'm sure the water on the ramp would require maintenance to.  Then again, I could be completely wrong and these mirrors could be super cheap to produce compared to solar panels."
chemicalreactiongifs,2uo0jd,slccsoccer28,3,Wed Feb 4 03:04:52 2015 UTC,"Well both are impractical at the moment. It's especially unfortunate that solar panels lose so much efficiency from simply being a little dusty (which matters a ton if you're trying to profit off of it). It's even more unfortunate that most people ignore maintenance and focus on how good it would be to use solar. I want unlimited energy from my backyard too, but the way i see it, there has got to be a better energy source out there that doesn't use up precious (and increasingly expensive) water."

chemicalreactiongifs,2uo0jd,Amaranthine,2,Tue Feb 3 21:39:24 2015 UTC,"Even if it's 30% for the highest rate, it's been climbing very rapidly, a few percent every few years. If it continues this way, it'll pass coal's efficiency and go lower than its price within the next decade or two.  And: there's more jobs with solar right now than there are with coal.

chemicalreactiongifs,2ujrzx,AnthraxCat,5,Mon Feb 2 20:10:57 2015 UTC,It is sped up but only very slightly. The process of growing crystals used is called recrystallization. The faster something is cooled the faster it comes out of solution as crystals. Ideally for really long crystals it should be cooled as slow as possible over hours.

chemicalreactiongifs,2udohj,kevinstonge,25,Sun Feb 1 09:27:20 2015 UTC,"The sponge shown appears to be a cellulose urethane composite sponge, I found the patent if anyone was curious  (it's very dull).    http://www.google.com/patents/WO2008073879A1?cl=en  Although cellulose is usually stable enough toward hydrolysis to allow it to used in clothing where it can be dyed and laundered it is susceptible to hydrolysis in the presence of strong acids.  Here the reaction is likely attacking the acetal linkages, cleaving the 1-4-glycosidic bonds in the cellulose.  This also explains why the degradation is rapid but not complete, leaving the sponge looking shredded, because the urethane part of the composite is not as quickly degraded.  (Urethane is also known to degrade when exposed to highly concentrated sulfuric acid, albeit more slowly than cellulose.  As such it should probably not be used as a vessel for sulfuric acid of any concentration.)"

These exploding metals are solid or room-temperature liquid lumps that react with the water, thermite is a powder that reacts with itself resulting in a very hot liquid metal and hot smoke.  With the thermite, as I see it, the expanding water vapor coming up the funnel carved in the ice blows the powder apart, greatly expanding the surface area exposed to the heat needed to start the reaction and then things go very fast every which way.  In fact I think that with their ice being in a loose stack of blocks, they melt a hot funnel with a cool air intake at the bottom, creating a ""rocket stove""/convection/chimney effect that blows the flammable-powder and yellow-hot liquid metal mixture even more air to expand with the steam."

chemicalreactiongifs,2u761h,elprophet,2,Fri Jan 30 21:53:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, about 95% of this video isn't instructional in the slightest about the chemical reaction. Hell, it begins with a fuzzy recording of mythbusters, and took about 5 minutes to begin any breakdown at all. The rest of the video is an interesting examination of the scientific method and experimentation, but they cover the actual explanation in about 1 minute of total video time.   Don't get me wrong, I love the detailed nature of the video, and the concepts and explanations they use, but most of the video was not chemical reaction, it was scientific experimentation."

It is a silvery white, soft, nonmagnetic, ductile metal. Aluminium is the third most abundant element (after oxygen and silicon), and the most abundant metal in the Earth's crust. It makes up about 8% by weight of the Earth's solid surface. Aluminium metal is so chemically reactive that native specimens are rare and limited to extreme reducing environments. Instead, it is found combined in over 270 different minerals.  The chief ore of aluminium is bauxite.

chemicalreactiongifs,2tycss,DaveS1551,-5,Thu Jan 29 07:50:00 2015 UTC,I think this is what the Patriots want us to think happened to their balls.
chemicalreactiongifs,2tycss,mouthdrummer,3,Wed Jan 28 16:46:04 2015 UTC,"Not saying that this is what happened, but if the balls had been filled in a warm room, and then brought to a cold field, the air inside will most definitely have contracted, causing them to deflate a bit.  If all the balls were deflated by a consistent amount, then this is an even more likely scenario.  However, I would think that most experienced locker room assistants would know this, so it might have been done intentionally.  Either way, there's no reality in which the Colts would have won that game."
chemicalreactiongifs,2tycss,DaveS1551,-2,Wed Jan 28 17:53:23 2015 UTC,"Well it wasn't cold enough for the balls to deflate that much and if it was then the Colts balls should have deflated too. Here's the first article that came up when i googled it so you should be able to find more if you want to investiage farther.   And IMO it doesn't matter if it changed the outcome of the game, cheating is cheating. Lets say a straight A student writes the answers for a test on a water bottle. During the test he realizes that he already knows everything but still gets caught. He would be punished even though it didn't change his grade. The intent to cheat was still there."
chemicalreactiongifs,2tycss,mouthdrummer,2,Wed Jan 28 18:11:03 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  Honestly, I don't care about football.  I'll tell you what though, the Houston Rockets start pulling that crap, and I'm out."
chemicalreactiongifs,2tycss,mechesh,2,Wed Jan 28 18:31:25 2015 UTC,"Well it wasn't cold enough for the balls to deflate that much    How much did they deflate?  Answer: We don't know.  The NFL has not said what the pre-game PSI was of the Pats or Colts balls, or what the 1/2 time PSI was of any of them.  The NFL has not said how much difference there was pre-game and half time.  EVERYTHING is unconfirmed ""sources"".  There is no actual data so saying that It wasn't cold enough to deflate that much is meaningless."
chemicalreactiongifs,2tycss,DaveS1551,1 point,Wed Jan 28 22:00:08 2015 UTC,"11 of the 12 balls were under inflated by around 2 psi. Even if the numbers are slightly off, the league is conducting a full investigation. They wouldn't do that if the balls were inflated correctly."
chemicalreactiongifs,2tycss,mechesh,1 point,Wed Jan 28 22:17:01 2015 UTC,""" league sources involved and familiar with the investigation ""  right there in the first paragraph.    This is not official.  That is what I am talking about.  It is all ""sources""  Later in the week this came out.  But what has the NFL really found?  As one league source has explained it to PFT, the football intercepted by Colts linebacker D’Qwell Jackson was roughly two pounds under the 12.5 PSI minimum.  The other 10 balls that reportedly were two pounds under may have been, as the source explained it, closer to one pound below 12.5 PSI.  So, two ""sources"" put out conflicting information.  That is why I said we just don't know."
chemicalreactiongifs,2tycss,DaveS1551,1 point,Wed Jan 28 22:21:18 2015 UTC,"1 source says they were under inflated by 2 psi and another says they were under inflated by over slightly over 1 psi. Either way they were deflated to an illegal level.  And the maker of the footballs along some some big names have said atmospheric conditions couldn't have deflated the balls anywhere close to that. The balls are designed to be used in all conditions and the weather for games can vary from below 0 to over 100 degrees.   http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/26/neil-degrasse-tyson-defla_n_6551666.html  Its really not a debate whether or not the balls were under inflated, its just a matter of who did it and who knew about it.   And I'm not saying the Pats should be kicked out of the super bowl or anything, but they should get some punishment considering this is the second time they've been caught cheating. They should get a punishment even if it was the first time they got caught, cheating is cheating, if there's no punishment then why even make it a rule."
chemicalreactiongifs,2tycss,mechesh,2,Wed Jan 28 22:36:54 2015 UTC,"Either way they were deflated to an illegal level.   well...no they weren't.  The rule sates that the balls shall be between 12.5 and 13.5 psi when inspected prior to the game.  They shall not be altered after that.  SO, if there is a drop in pressure, then a team is actually not allowed to add air during the game.    Also of note, from the rules:  In the event a home team ball does not conform to specifications, or its supply is exhausted, the Referee shall secure a proper ball from the visitors and, failing that, use the best available ball (emphasis mine)  I read this to mean that it is known balls might fall out of spec, and it is OK to use one out of spec if all the balls are out of spec.  As far as ""the Wilson employee""...I will take the math of the MIT professor over him, and Bill Nye, who, by the way, in his video did not show any pressure gauge readings and cheered for Seattle...yeah, real unbiased source there."
chemicalreactiongifs,2tycss,DaveS1551,1 point,Wed Jan 28 22:44:53 2015 UTC,"...was roughly two pounds under the 12.5 PSI minimum.  The other 10 balls that reportedly were two pounds under may have been, as the source explained it, closer to one pound below 12.5 PSI.have to wait for the NFL to release the full investagation since   The ball were under inflated, it wasn't that they just decreased in pressure.  The manufacturer stated that the balls are designed with varying weather conditions in mind to prevent any kind of atmospheric conditions from doing this exact thing.

chemicalreactiongifs,2tycss,mechesh,1 point,Wed Jan 28 23:11:14 2015 UTC,The manufacturer stated that the balls are designed with varying weather conditions in mind to prevent any kind of atmospheric conditions from doing this exact thing.   Are you saying that the football manufacturer found a way to defy the laws of physics?  That is what it would take to prevent a change in internal PSI due to temperature change.  It doesn't matter what material the ball is made out of Pressure is directly related to temperature.  It is called the Ideal Gas Law.  The ball manufacturer who said that doesn't know physics.  the MIT professor with a doctorate in physics does.  It sounds like your mind is not going to change because you would rather believe what the sensationalist media is trying to feed you rather than math and science.

A person on a very fast train carrying a large amount of charge would have no relative motion, and thus would see an electric field only, but a person on the ground watching the train go by would see an electric and magnetic field. Thinking about this issue led Einstein to special relativity."

It is called spin, and as far as I understand, they do not actually spin, but is a property, which makes them behave as though they spin. So one electron spinning would create a small magnetic field. If you add one that spins in the other direction, the magnetic field is kinda cancelled out. In normal not magnetic matter, like a couch, your glass, pen etc, the electrons spin i all kinds of different directions and cancel out, but in magnets, most of them spin the same way, so the small magnetic fields from the individual electrons add up to create a stronger field we can measure"

It is a plasma ball and like many plasma balls the electronics are outside the glass. In the case of the mug the electronics are in the coaster. Most plasma balls have a belly button like inversion into the glass which makes it seem that the electronics extend into the glass but they do not.  By the way you can fill a plasma mug with beer and drink out of it however when you remove it from the coaster it stops emitting light.

Stellarators are distinct from tokamak in that they are not azimuthally symmetric. Instead, they have a discrete rotational symmetry, often fivefold, like a regular pentagon.

You can never get more energy out than what you put in. However, if the plasma undergoes fusion, it can release energy and theoretically you could produce more energy than what you put in by converting some mass to energy like fission nuclear reactors (I think that is the case). As said above, large amounts of funding (though much less than the researchers would like) are spent on working toward using fusion to produce power, but it is still not proven that it can be done at all. Theoretical possibilities and engineering designs have a large chasm between them, and that is just another problem in a large list. Another problem is confining the plasma. You can see how magnets exert force on plasma in the gif, but using this to confine energetic plasma is like using box fans to confine air in a vacuum during a hurricane."

You are getting a lot of unfortunately snarky comments below, but I will interpret your question as a question about plasma fusion reactors. This is fairly low energy plasma and not capable of fusion, so you will never get more energy out than you put in. Energy is a conserved quantity when paired with mass. However, during fusion, it is my understanding that mass can be converted to energy. When that happens you can theoretically get out the energy you put in plus the energy from the mass (think E=mc2 ). So to answer the question as asked, this apparatus can not put out more energy than is put in, however it is theoretically possible using fusion and is widely done by different means in nuclear fission reactors. I hope this was more helpful than the dunderheads commenting. I will answer questions I can, but I don't study plasma fission only space plasma."

After doing a bit of reading, I think this is because a 'system' in thermodynamics must have a boundary and an environment. An open system 's boundaries allow transfer of matter and of energy: the boundaries of a closed system allow only the transfer of energy as heat/work. There's also a theoretical construct called an 'isolated system' with boundaries that permit the transfer of neither matter nor energy- but it still has a fixed volume and rigid walls. And it's generally thought to be an abstraction with no possible reflection in reality.  Since there's no 'environment' and no observed 'boundary' to the universe, it is neither an open nor a closed system, nor even an isolated system: it does not fit the definition of any of the three.

chemicalreactiongifs,2tnclj,TwatsThat,5,Mon Jan 26 04:36:57 2015 UTC,"You can just assume that the answer to any question beginning with, ""Can you theoretically create energy from no energy"" is ""no""."
chemicalreactiongifs,2tnclj,Skyrmir,3,Mon Jan 26 14:48:57 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that the water wheel couldn't generate enough energy to heat a platform to a temperature high enough to create the Leidenfrost effect.
chemicalreactiongifs,2tnclj,Mafia_Rebourn,6,Mon Jan 26 05:07:51 2015 UTC,"Judging by the pipe reference, I think he was actually referring to capillary action.  However, the answer is still no, you can't violate the laws of thermodynamics."
chemicalreactiongifs,2tnclj,Skyrmir,1 point,Mon Jan 26 05:16:20 2015 UTC,Actually I was asking about both.  But what about the capillary effect violates the law of Thermodynamics. I'm not meaning to sound rude I just don't remember much about it I just remember that some civilizations used them to move water uphill.
chemicalreactiongifs,2tnclj,TwatsThat,3,Mon Jan 26 05:26:16 2015 UTC,"The Capillary effect doesn't violate anything.  Trying to use it to pump water won't work though.  The same charge that pulls the water up, holds it in the tube at the top via surface tension."
chemicalreactiongifs,2tnclj,Mafia_Rebourn,2,Mon Jan 26 06:07:45 2015 UTC,"The way capillary action works is that the surface tension of the water causes it to be at a lower potential when it is a small tube than in droplet form. This means that when the water enters the tube, it releases a small amount of energy, which is enough to lift it against gravity up to the top of the tube. Once it reaches the top, you can't get it out of the tube without supplying the energy needed to return the water to droplet form. It doesn't violate any laws, it just lets energy flow in an unusual way."

It has to push toward something it's cohesive towards, and once it reaches it, the only way to keep it pushing is to move the things its pushing towards further...which takes energy, which you don't have."
chemicalreactiongifs,2tnclj,computerdl,2,Sun Jan 25 23:09:59 2015 UTC,"The energy to move the drops comes from the difference in the strength of their surface tension, which is caused by their differing concentrations of propylene glycol. As they move the solutions mix and approach the same concentration, and will stop moving. You can see in the circle droplet video that they slow down over time. You can get some energy out of their tiny amount of force, but since they will only exert that force for a finite time, you will only get finite energy."
chemicalreactiongifs,2tnclj,KiltedCobra,1 point,Mon Jan 26 10:25:10 2015 UTC,Only because the friction between the glass and the fluid is so low. It actually loses a little bit of energy sliding around.

Is it in a vacuum such that air particles cannot interfere and cause resistance?  Perpetual motion simply does not work.

Given that the 2nd law comes from empirical evidence and we keep pushing the boundaries of what we observe we may find other violations eventually.  Just like Newtonian physics still generally works but we've found some exceptions with relativity.

The droplets' motion may seem chaotic at times, but the researchers explained much of the droplets' motion through the variations in surface tension between the droplets and their surrounding vapor.  When the droplets land on the glass surface, an encompassing vapor forms around the liquid droplets, creating a thin film that sticks to the glass. When one droplet encounters this film emanating from another droplet, it starts to pull toward its new neighbor due to an imbalance in surface tension. The area on the glass between the two droplets contains the thin vapor film, making it easier for the droplets to slide toward one another."""

Oxygen is one of the most electron hungry atoms on the periodic table, and will hog the electron density away from the protons.

I suppose it's an interesting type of grouping algorithm where you know what categories you are trying to group the collection by.

chemicalreactiongifs,2rqfa9,SuspiciousHistorian,167,Thu Jan 8 11:05:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, dear.  I once (illegally) made this stuff in high school, and made a big mess.  The synthesis is very simple - IIRC, you add iodine crystals to a strong ammonia solution, and collect the precipitate, which is actually a complex called ammonium nitrogen triiodide, or NH3.NI3.  My friend and I made an immodestly-sized batch of the stuff, and dumped it out onto some filter paper on a bench to let it dry out.  My friend, being an impatient sort, wanted to speed up the drying process, so he took a greenhouse fan heater that was lying around the chem lab (don't ask me why - I am guessing it belonged to the biology lab), set it on low, and pointed it at the pile of wet NH3.NI3.  We left the lab, and hadn't gotten very far when we both heard a sort of a soft ""whoomp"" noise.  We turned around, and we back into the lab.  From the threshold of the door to the lab, we could see that the filter paper, stained brownish purple, was where we had left it, but the pile of ammonium nitrogen triiodide was gone.  As we took a step into the lab to investigate, we immediately noticed that every step we took was accompanied by a crackle-crackle noise, accompanied by small puffs of purple smoke, and left behind small brown scorch marks in the linoleum.  We looked down and it became obvious where the pile had gone - there must have been just enough of an initial detonation not to set off the whole pile, but to distribute it evenly around the room ..."

It all happened in the sixth-form prep lab, and there were only four of us taking A-level chemistry.  I have a vague recollection that our teacher walked in at our next lesson time, looked at the floor with a furrowed brow and slightly confused expression on his face, and sort of shrugged it off.  Now ... that was the same lab we (the same friend & I) later sort-of blew up with homemade flash powder.  THAT one, EVERYBODY knew about. Even then, the only trouble we got in was we were excused from lessons for a day and made to clean up the mess.  But that's another story.  And, I swear, absolutely true."

Back when I went to school, we each did the experiment ourselves, by dropping a small piece of sodium into in a large test tube of water, clamped to a stand, using a scalpel.  Also bear in mind ... as a sixth-form student at a relatively small school, we had the run of the place.  We even, as I mentioned, had our own chemistry lab, so when I say we made NH3.NI3 or flash powder ... we were unsupervised.  We were - dare I say it - trusted (the fools!).  Now, our chemistry teacher was a pretty laid-back dude, and the fact we didn't get expelled or into serious trouble was probably almost entirely down to him, so I will totally give him that."

chemicalreactiongifs,2rqfa9,macfirbolg,1 point,Thu Jan 8 20:03:22 2015 UTC,"Ah, that would be the problem, then. You can make low explosives - gunpowder and the like, and sometimes* lower yield flash powders - in small quantities without a license of any kind. Fireworks hobbyists are the classic example. However, high explosives - dynamite, flash powder, and up - require licenses and permits in any quantity. Most especially, those permits require a facility with safe storage areas (bunkers) and some amount of separation from neighbors. RDX may make great rocket fuel, but it's not something that the government will let you dabble in casually.   *Laws vary. It is almost never acceptable to make only flash powder, but it can be acceptable as part of a demonstrable history of making other fireworks. Some kids played with half sticks of dynamite and military small explosives, so they outlawed those products; the kids then learned to make flash powder, which has similar power, so they outlawed it as well. They don't want you making firecrackers to blow up the neighbor's mailbox, but they'll accept making salutes for a fireworks display."

chemicalreactiongifs,2r1ar8,autowikibot,52,Thu Jan 1 21:10:41 2015 UTC,"Brinicle:       A brinicle (brine icicle, also known as ice stalactite) forms beneath sea ice when a flow of extremely cold, saline water is introduced to an area of ocean water, being the undersea equivalent of a hollow stalactite or icicle.  Known since the 1960s, the generally accepted model of their formation was proposed by the US oceanographer Seelye Martin in 1974.  The formation of a brinicle was first filmed in 2011 by producer Kathryn Jeffs and cameramen Hugh Miller and Doug Anderson for the BBC series Frozen Planet.

chemicalreactiongifs,2qxp5b,babyoilz,12,Wed Dec 31 21:03:39 2014 UTC,"Typically, to make something like Nylon 6,6 (the most common nylon, it's made in the same process as the one in the gif), hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid will be placed in a vessel. They are immiscible, so form two layers not unlike oil and water.  The materials will meet at the interface and polymerization occurs through substitution of the amine onto the carbonyl group, resulting in an amide linkage. A catalyst isn't required because this reaction is highly favorable and will occur autocatalytically (the protons can be shuttled around onto the amine and removed from the acid. Since there are two groups on each molecule to react, polymer chains will be formed. Unfortunately, most polymer reactions are not this simple.  PS- I didn't watch the video, so there is a good chance I repeated a lot of what they said."
chemicalreactiongifs,2qxp5b,yosoymilk5,3,Wed Dec 31 22:09:57 2014 UTC,Could this be used in 3d printing?
chemicalreactiongifs,2qxp5b,Jigsus,3,Thu Jan 1 00:24:40 2015 UTC,"In theory, yes. In practice, not likely. To my knowledge of the different types of 3d printing I'm familiar with, none of them are able to utilize polymerization in the manufacturing.   Besides, there would still be a lot of unreacted monomer stuck in the polymer matrix. Typically with nylon 6 and nylon 6,6 you can ""wash"" out the caprolactam with boiling water or water vapor or other polar solvents like methanol, but most of the moneymaking for polyamides are in hot melt processing, after the macromolecule has been formed and frozen solid.  That being said, if the poly being used reacts at a high temperature, you could in theory use a laser or set of lasers to raise the temperature in a small portion of a solution to polymerize and build from there. One form of additive manufacting does exactly this, only by melting bits of a bed of powdered metal."

chemicalreactiongifs,2qxp5b,yosoymilk5,1 point,Fri Jan 2 13:31:11 2015 UTC,"Dumb question, Why does it form a thread instead of just a layer of nylon at the interface? Would that happen if it wasn't being pulled?"
chemicalreactiongifs,2qxp5b,CottonBalls26,2,Thu Jan 1 01:31:30 2015 UTC,It does form a fairly thin film of nylon at the interface that fairly quickly stops the reaction as the two reactants are immiscible and don't diffuse through the polymer. But you can keep pulling the polymer out in a thread as long as you have reactants left to form a fresh reactive interface.
chemicalreactiongifs,2qxp5b,vladsinger,1 point,Thu Jan 1 04:46:58 2015 UTC,"That's actually a good question. I believe it would still polymerize, but just more slowly. It is possible that a layer if nylon could halt the reactants from meeting at the interface."

History of article  Candle:       The earliest surviving candles originated in China around 200 BC, and were made from whale fat. European candles of antiquity were of the made from various forms of natural fat, tallow, and wax. In Ancient Rome, candles were made of tallow due to the prohibitive cost of beeswax.  It is possible that they also existed in Ancient Greece, but imprecise terminology makes it difficult to determine.   In the 18th century, spermaceti, oil produced by the sperm whale, was used to produce a superior candle.  Late in the 18th century, colza oil and rapeseed oil came into use as much cheaper substitutes. Beeswax, compared to animal-based tallow, burned cleanly, without smoky flame. Rather than the foul and terrible odor of tallow, it emit a fresh smell. Beeswax candles were expensive, but widely used for church ceremonies. Other than the wealthy, few people could afford to burn them in their homes.   Until of late years, candles were solely manufactured from bees' wax, spermaceti, or tallow. The application of scientific chemical research...all the best candles are now made from the pure solid and crystallizable margaric and stearic acids. These are freed from the fluid oleic acid, and from glycerine, which exist in combination with them in ordinary tallow, as well as from other analogous substances, as from paraffin (a carbo-hygroneous substance resembling spermaceti, prepared from tar and peat), the stearic and margaric acid in the cocoa-nut oil and the palm oil, besides the old substance spermaceti, and wax both vegetable and animal.

The force of magnetism is determined by magnetic moments.  The Curie temperature is the critical point where a material's intrinsic magnetic moments change direction. Magnetic moments are permanent dipole moments within the atom which originate from electrons' angular momentum and spin. Materials have different structures of intrinsic magnetic moments that depend on temperature. At a material's Curie Temperature those intrinsic magnetic moments change direction.  Permanent magnetism is caused by the alignment of magnetic moments and induced magnetism is created when disordered magnetic moments are forced to align in an applied magnetic field. For example, the ordered magnetic moments (ferromagnetic, figure 1) change and become disordered (paramagnetic, figure 2) at the Curie Temperature.

A ferromagnet is a material where the magnetic moments align parallel spontaneously below the critical temperature, which in this case is known as the Curie temperature. A ferromagnet's magnetic susceptibility (degree of magnetization) increases below the Curie temperature.  An antiferromagnet is essentially the opposite! Below the critical temperature, known as the Neel temperature here, the magnetic moments align antiparallel to one another. The susceptibility begins dropping sharply below the Neel temperature.  So what about above the critical temperatures? That's when the material becomes paramagnetic, which means the magnetic moments are no longer able to spontaneously align and need the application of an applied field to line up."

Often times one crystalline plane family orders more easily so the grains grow preferentially along that plane.

Secondly, the grain size isn't a conserved quantity because the number of crystalline grains may (and does) change.   Example: Say in a total volume of 12 nm3 there are four grains that each take up 3 nm3. Average grain size is clearly 3 nm3 . After a thermal cycle it's possible that two grains will fuse together giving two grains with 3 nm3 and one with 6 nm3. The average grain size is now 4 nm3 .   However, in saying that, I would think that the magnetic field strength required to align all crystallites in a single direction would decrease   Why do you say that? The saturating field of a magnet depends on a large number of factors. Which do you think is important here?"
chemicalreactiongifs,2qdc96,Fingebimus,1 point,Fri Dec 26 01:24:55 2014 UTC,"What I meant was that given a specific volume, one will observe conservation, ie given 12nm3 where you have four 3nm3 grains, let's say two fuse and grow slightly to give one grain of 8nm3, the other two must decrease in size to two 2nm3.   Apologies, I miss-spoke about a grain boundary increasing, and meant that a grain may increase, however with an increased grain size, the surface of the grain, in three dimensions, would increase and hence the boundary to neighbouring grains would also increase.   Also, I say the grain resistance to an applied magnetic field would reduce as given a fully saturated crystal in one direction, if the curie temperature is achieved, the paramagnetic result would have preferential dipole alignment in that specific direction, hence reapplication of a smaller magnetic field could realign and fully saturate the material"

The nickel, carbon and manganese in the alloy serve to stabilize austenite (gamma-iron) at lower temperatures, while elements like chrome and molybdenum stabilize ferrite (alpha-iron).   Working the alloy will induce a transformation of certain metastable austenite phases (regions of the alloy rich in nickel and carbon), turning them into ferrite colonies and making the steel slightly magnetic. Some alloys take advantage of this transformation to promote additional strength (like 301LN)."

The bulk properties of such a system resembles that of a paramagnet, but on a microscopic level they are ordered. The materials do show an ordering temperature above which the behavior reverts to ordinary paramagnetism (with interaction). Ferrofluids are a good example, but the phenomenon can also occur inside solids, e.g., when dilute paramagnetic centers are introduced in a strong itinerant medium of ferromagnetic coupling such as when Fe is substituted in TlCu2Se2 or the alloy AuFe. Such systems contain ferromagnetically coupled clusters that freeze out at lower temperatures. They are also called mictomagnets.

chemicalreactiongifs,2pp27a,DanHeidel,50,Thu Dec 18 18:06:48 2014 UTC,"Memory alloys can have their atoms arranged in two different atomic lattice arrangements.  All metals have different atomic arrangements they can take on but usually they have stable ranges that are separated by very large temperature variations.  With the memory alloys, the amount of energy required to shift lattice arrangements is very low.  When you bend them, the physical force triggers the lattice rearrangement wherever the metal is being compressed or stretched (forget which) which give the metal a tremendous ability to reversibly bend.  Some memory alloys just snap back to the original shape when released. I had a pair of glass frames years back that were like this.  You could wrap the arms of the glasses around your finger like a corkscrew and they would snap back to the original shape as soon as you let go.    This particular alloy requires a small temperature shift to go back to the original lattice configuration.  Tossing the metal into hot water triggers it and it goes back to the original configuration."

There are different wires and I believe they have different strengths. So I think if the bite is really jacked up, they would use a lower strength wire, building up to stronger wires. But I'm no orthodontist. ;)"
chemicalreactiongifs,2pp27a,SWgeek10056,3,Thu Dec 18 21:03:52 2014 UTC,"But that doesn't use memory wire, does it?"
chemicalreactiongifs,2pp27a,Beer_in_an_esky,6,Fri Dec 19 00:48:03 2014 UTC,It does indeed. Had a few pieces of memory wire in my mouth for a few years. They change them out after a while to adjust the strength (how much it pulls back to the original shape).
chemicalreactiongifs,2pp27a,SWgeek10056,3,Fri Dec 19 01:53:52 2014 UTC,TIL.  At least they're being used for something. I can't wait until this becomes more commonplace and more than just a wire.
chemicalreactiongifs,2pp27a,jplanet,4,Fri Dec 19 04:55:16 2014 UTC,"PhD is partly on Shape Memory Alloys.   Current medical uses include orthodontic arch wires, bone staples, vascular stents, atrial occlusion devices and any similar role where you want a device which is small when delivered but can expand in situ, or that can exert a pretty constant force for a long time; SMAs display a strange shaped stress/strain curve, which means they can change their strain (how much they've stretched) a lot without changing their stress (force required to keep them stretched).  Also, it has a low modulus (its not very stiff) which makes it attractive for bone implants in general (due to a bad thing called stress shielding).  Finally, it finds use as actuators in aircraft, self adjusting flow systems, and (in a superelastic state) any role requiring robust structures (like antenna, or glass frames)."

chemicalreactiongifs,2pp27a,ibreakstuff,6,Thu Dec 18 20:28:44 2014 UTC,"Primarily SMAs are used for one of two properties: the shape memory effect (seen here) or superelasticity. Superelasticity iinvolves the spontaneous recovery of the alloy without a temperature change.  SME alloys are generally used for actuation, especially in cases where traditional electric motors are too large/massive or the motion too complex. Actuating a SME alloy wire can be done through joule heating making the device and power source very very easy to setup. They are especially popular in producing solid-state grippers in MEMS and to remotely deploy one-time-use structures with very little power requirements.  SE alloys are much more common in biomedical applications where you need to get something structural (heart stent, patch, graft, etc.) through the human body without much trauma. An SE mesh can be swished down on a catheter, delivered to a site, and deployed to several times its initial size with only a minor incision being made. Also, this phase transformation happens at a fixed stress, making the SE deformation mode useful in orthodontic applications where a low stress needs to be applied over a large distance for a long time. Takes a lot of the 'tight' feeling out of getting your braces tightened.  Feel free to ask me anything else about the materials. Doing my PhD thesis on them now."

chemicalreactiongifs,2pp27a,ibreakstuff,11,Thu Dec 18 18:53:48 2014 UTC,"Depends on the alloy, but often these things have transformation temperatures closer to boiling water than body heat and the forces involved for those thinner strands might be manageable for a healthy digestive tract.  All else fails though, the material is extremely corrosion resistant and biocompatible. So having a wire embedded in your esophagus or stomach lining might not be all that bad."

chemicalreactiongifs,2pp27a,5i3ncef4n7,2,Thu Dec 18 18:57:04 2014 UTC,"My PhD is on this and related materials. Swallowing it wouldn't necessarily be great, but it would depend on a few factors.  Depending on the exact composition, the transition temp may be below body temp. This means a knotted up ball of the wire could expand and cause a potentially dangerous bowel obstruction. Aside from that, it probably wouldn't be any worse than eating any large chunk of metal.  One potential concern though, is the high Nickel content. While Ti itself is quite corrosion resistant (and lends that resistance to the Ni in the alloy with it), the highly acidic contents of your stomach would probably leach a decent amount of Ni out. I'm not 100% on the uptake pathway of Ni through the stomach, but Ni ions are pretty nasty if they make it all the way into the bloodstream. It's allergenic (allergy inducing), carcinogenic (cancer causing), mutagenic (DNA mutating) and cytotoxic (cell killing), so if it is taken up in any quantity... probably not good things."
chemicalreactiongifs,2pp27a,5i3ncef4n7,2,Fri Dec 19 10:59:39 2014 UTC,"Ni leeching is a major concern of the bio-med folks, but so far work has shown the material to be pretty darn safe. With that high a Ti content, you are going to get preferential oxidation and passivation of titania on over most all of the surface, limiting any Ni transport into the patient's bloodstream. Whether the trace amount that leeches out per unit area is harmful would entirely depend on the surface area ingested."

Unfortunately I am not well versed in this field...I just enjoy making nice gifs and watching the interesting reactions :)    EDIT: As mentioned below by /u/pyrophorus, this reaction is burning ammonium dichromate that decomposes to chromium (III) oxide which catalyzes the oxidation of ammonia gas to nitrogen, nitrous oxide and water. What I've said earlier about ammonia catalyzing the ammonium dichromate combustion is wrong :C  In short, burning ammonium dichromate is added to an Erlenmeyer flask that contains a few milliliters of 25% ammonia solution. The first reaction:  (NH4)2Cr2O7 → Cr2O3 + N2 + 4 H2O  The chromium (III) oxide produced above then catalyzes the oxidation reaction of the ammonia vapours that emerge from the solution. This reaction happens above the liquid due to the vapours being all vapoury 'n stuff.  The second set of reactions:  2 NH3 + 2 O2 → N2O + 3 H2O  4 NH3 + 3 O2 → 2 N2 + 6 H2O  More information on the background and setup: http://www.chemicalconnection.org.uk/chemistry/topics/view.php?topic=3&headingno=11 http://www.rsc.org/education/eic/issues/2009Jan/ExhibitionChemistry.asp"

chemicalreactiongifs,2p37jo,shieldvexor,1 point,Fri Dec 12 21:31:27 2014 UTC,Why do they throiate or lanthinate or ceriate? Also wtf is TIG tungsten?
chemicalreactiongifs,2p37jo,heywire84,2,Wed Dec 31 06:15:29 2014 UTC,"Old thread eh?  TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas) is a welding process otherwise known as GTAW (Gas Tungsten Arc Welding) where an electric arc between welding electrode and workpeice is produced using a tungsten electrode.  Pure tungsten is used but usually the tungsten is alloyed with thorium which improves electron transmission.  Thorium is radioactive (which we see in the gif) so some tungsten electrodes use cerium, lanthanum, or zirconium to improve the properties of the tungsten electrode vs a pure tungsten electrode."

These filter out some of the wavelengths of sodium vapor light pollution. They won’t work quite as well as a true astronomical light-pollution filter, but they will still help more than no filter at all if your site is severely compromised by light pollution.

The second time I set up was the first time I went totally DIY. Before that I had been using equipment in a college laboratory where I had first learned the skill. At the college, they had all the equipment for the students including the didymium glasses. When I set up on my own, I was a poor college kid and I decided I couldn't afford the glasses. Didymium is a rare-earth metal so things that makes use of it tend to be a little pricey.   So I got an O2, tank and hooked into the house's natural gas line and got a regulator and a cutting torch and some borosilicate tubing and began going to work. After my first few days I realized that when I looked across the street I couldn't see the other side of the street clearly anymore.   That was when I bought didymium safety glasses. Luckily, over a period of months, my vision returned with the help of heavy doses of THC. I just got a new pair last year."

chemicalreactiongifs,2ow0sx,jasnooo,27,Wed Dec 10 20:13:19 2014 UTC,"I'm going to guess that the potassium hits the water and starts burning, which then lights the diethyl ether and the evolved hydrogen gas.  I'm not a chemist though.  Edit: the potassium and diethyl ether are probably already in the reaction vessel.  I'm guessing it's water that is added, which then reacts with the potassium in an exothermic reaction producing potassium hydroxide and hydrogen gas."
chemicalreactiongifs,2ow0sx,Jbeerman6,9,Wed Dec 10 20:29:52 2014 UTC,"That is exactly what happened.   Potassium dissolved in diethyl ether is fairly common and used for a variety of purposes.

chemicalreactiongifs,2orip6,genitaliban,5,Tue Dec 9 22:25:53 2014 UTC,"Leidenfrost effect:       The Leidenfrost effect is a scientific phenomenon in which a liquid, in near contact with a mass significantly hotter than the liquid's boiling point, produces an insulating vapor layer keeping that liquid from boiling rapidly. This is most commonly seen when cooking; one sprinkles drops of water in a pan to gauge its temperature: if the pan's temperature is at or above the Leidenfrost point, the water skitters across the pan and takes longer to evaporate than in a pan below the temperature of the Leidenfrost point (but still above boiling temperature). The effect is also responsible for the ability of liquid nitrogen to skitter across floors. It has also been used in some potentially dangerous demonstrations, such as dipping a wet finger in molten lead  or blowing out a mouthful of liquid nitrogen, both enacted without injury to the demonstrator.  The latter is potentially lethal, particularly should one accidentally swallow the liquid nitrogen.

chemicalreactiongifs,2orip6,buzzabuzza,2,Wed Dec 10 13:23:08 2014 UTC,"Liquid breathing:       Liquid breathing is a form of respiration in which a normally air-breathing organism breathes an oxygen-rich liquid (such as a perfluorocarbon), rather than breathing air.  Perfluorochemical (perfluorocarbon) molecules have very different structures that impart different physical properties such as respiratory gas solubility, density, viscosity, vapor pressure, and lipid solubility.  Thus, it is critical to select the appropriate PFC for a specific biomedical application, such as liquid ventilation, drug delivery or blood substitutes. The physical properties of PFC liquids vary substantially; however, the one common property is their high solubility for respiratory gases. In fact, these liquids carry more oxygen and carbon dioxide than blood.   In theory, liquid breathing could assist in the treatment of patients with severe pulmonary or cardiac trauma, especially in pediatric cases. Liquid breathing has also been proposed for use in deep diving   and space travel.  Despite some recent advances in liquid ventilation, a standard mode of application has not been established yet.

chemicalreactiongifs,2onqxz,FirstNoel,46,Mon Dec 8 18:55:35 2014 UTC,"I'm actually doing research into snow crystal formation right now, so I've been reading and thinking about this question a lot.  First off, most snow crystals are not in fact symmetrical.  Even those that appear to be tend to have visible deviations from perfect symmetry if you look closely enough.  The reason for the approximate symmetry, though, is that despite the complexity of the result, snow crystal formation is a mostly deterministic process, in a statistical mechanical sense due to their macroscopic size, which is controlled by the atmospheric conditions and how they change over the course of the snow crystal's flight.  Because the snow crystal is small compared to the size of atmospheric fluctuations, all six branches experience the same time series of conditions, leading to similar developmental patterns.  My research mentor's website covers this and a lot of other common questions about snow crystal growth."

The case that some people works years in and out on this most delicate of subject is just a really happy thought :)  Still, I have a question regarding the formation. I am currently studying linear analysis and the main concern is to understand the convergence of series to better get a grip on what Fourier and Laplace transformation actually do to equations. My question is: does the study of snowflakes involve the convergence of series, maybe based on the first point of freezing, how they develop depending on humidity and temperature etc. etc. In other words: does the study of series help you in your subject?  I wish you all the luck in your research!"
chemicalreactiongifs,2onqxz,Komberal,2,Mon Dec 8 23:37:04 2014 UTC,"Series are so omniprevalent in science that I had to think for a good while before I could find many of the places where I was implicitly using them.  Here's some applications I found:   Quasistatic humidity distributions are solutions to Laplace's equation, also known as harmonic functions.  These are studied in potential theory, which is related to the integral transforms you mentioned on a deep level due to the special properties of the Newtonian kernel when Fourier transformed. The asymptotically fastest approximate N-body methods,  such as the fast multipole method, for example, are based on multipole series expansions, which are closely related to the transforms you mentioned. Heat diffusion can be simulated quickly using fast Fourier transform convolution. The expected circle first hitting probability of a particle undergoing brownian motion in two dimensions concurrently with exponential decay is best analyzed in terms of Laplace transforms.   Good luck with your studies.  Feel free to ask any further questions you might have."

A friend mentioned in a passing conversation the difference between vector analysis and the mathematics of series. He said something like ""vector analysis describes what happens to a single point with one dimension, series describe how a system evolves in time"". That difference seems to be quite a big one but I found it elucidating, does it hold any water?    One more thing for this post, I've been seeing a lot of these so called ""harmonic functions"", and always thought they referred to a physical system, like a spring with a mass in harmonic motion. But after seeing them pop up everywhere when calculating series, comparing them to get upper and lower bounds etc. that explanation seems to run a bit low.

To me, a series is just the sum of a, frequently infinite, sequence of elements.  I don't know what your friend think this has to do with vectors, points, dimensionality, or time.  Harmonic potentials are so called because they induce sinusoidal motion of a finite number of particles, which can be heard as a pure tone.  The etymology for harmonic functions is similar, but for motion with an infinite number of degrees of freedom, and is explained in more detail here.  If you wish to understand them in more depth, you should look into complex analysis, where they play a fundamental role."

That's why snowflakes are hexagonal, it's the natural form of ice on the surface of Earth. There are, however, other forms of ice that have different crystalline structures. Hexagonal ice is referred to as Ice Ih while cubic ice is Ice Ic, rhombohedral ice is Ice II, tetragonal ice is Ice III, all the way up to Ice XV. Each have their own unique structure and conditions for creation.   This is similar to how pure carbon can take the form of graphite, graphene, diamond, nanotubes, or fullerenes depending on the crystal structure it has.

chemicalreactiongifs,2onqxz,ComradePyro,18,Mon Dec 8 19:34:04 2014 UTC,"Thats whats it's called, but it's not an explanation.  From Scientific American   The growth of snowflakes (or of any substance changing from a liquid to a solid state) is known as crystallization. During this process, the molecules (in this case, water molecules) align themselves to maximize attractive forces and minimize repulsive ones. As a result, the water molecules arrange themselves in predetermined spaces and in a specific arrangement. This process is much like tiling a floor in accordance with a specific pattern: once the pattern is chosen and the first tiles are placed, then all the other tiles must go in predetermined spaces in order to maintain the pattern of symmetry. Water molecules simply arrange themselves to fit the spaces and maintain symmetry; in this way, the different arms of the snowflake are formed."
chemicalreactiongifs,2onqxz,blaisewilson,2,Mon Dec 8 19:50:42 2014 UTC,"So to dumb it down further, the ""seed"" would be whatever speck of dirt that snowflake forms on, and all the water molecules are looking to find the best way to cling on and cryastalize off the resulting stucture? Or do snowflakes not nucleate like that?"
chemicalreactiongifs,2onqxz,Dafuzz,1 point,Mon Dec 8 21:03:54 2014 UTC,"It's more like this: once one arm begins to sprout, its forces of attraction cause every other arm to crystallize the same way.

chemicalreactiongifs,2onqxz,dasher11,0,Mon Dec 8 22:12:26 2014 UTC,"No, you're right, but only partially. That's the origin of the very rudimentary base of the snowflake. Rain is essentially just melted snow, and clouds are the tiny seeds for snow. Well, the tiny seed for the cloud is whatever piece of stuff that the nearby water vapor is attracted to. It then germinates over time through these previous phases into the snowflake.  I think /u/dasher11 explains it further quite well."
chemicalreactiongifs,2onqxz,ydnab2,0,Tue Dec 9 12:30:03 2014 UTC,"Short answer: Because atoms exist as the smallest base unit of matter so crystal structures can form.  Long answer: Because atoms are physical and defined things, (meaning it can't be divided up for purposes bigger than quantum scale) and as a result they can form defined atomic structures (meaning they follow very specific patterns). Ice is one such structure, and actually the reason it is not as dense as water since the water molecules arrange themselves in such a way that there are less atoms per space than water where it's not arranged in any specific way usually. And if you repeat these ""patterns"" enough, you end up with shapes such as snowflakes appearing out of it. As for why this ""pattern"" is symmetrical in the first place, it has to do with atoms liking to be as close to each other as the structure allows for, if the atoms get too far from the center on one side specifically, the interactions will be weak and has a very large chance to break off until the atoms ""fall into place"" in these ""slots"" in the crystal structure at which point their movements are stabilized."
chemicalreactiongifs,2onqxz,KaiserTom,2,Mon Dec 8 20:32:38 2014 UTC,"Ok, I think I got that.    So basically once the first atom is set, the rest of them just follow it based on it charges and positions.  This creates a stable crystal where no atom is to far out of sync with the others."
chemicalreactiongifs,2onqxz,FirstNoel,1 point,Mon Dec 8 21:17:50 2014 UTC,"Pretty much, though usually more than just a one atom has to be set, they need something to build off of. This can either happen randomly over time as atoms bump into each other or they can build off of something, like a dust particle, which is what snowflakes usually are based around. They then get this initial pattern from it and then proceed to copy and repeat it to make these structures. This is also why you can have supercooled water. If the water is pure and undisturbed, there is nothing for the ice crystal to build off of so it just stays really cold without solidifying."

chemicalreactiongifs,2onqxz,dogetipbot,8,Fri Dec 19 01:34:09 2014 UTC,"Ice crystal growth is really interesting.  Liquid water can exist up to -40 degrees in the atmosphere and is called supercooled liquid water. In a supersaturated environment both ice crystals and liquid water can grow simultaneously. When enough water vapor is condensed/deposited as ice and water the relative humidity with respect to water will drop below 100% and water can begin evaporating but because the saturation vapor pressure of ice is lower than water the relative humidity is still >100% with respect to ice so the ice will continue to grow at the expense of the evaporating liquid water.   Essentially the ice ""steals"" water molecules from the liquid water when conditions are right until enough water vapor is removed that the relative humidity becomes <100% with respect to ice! This frequently happens in convective systems like thunderstorms and is a really neat process."
chemicalreactiongifs,2onqxz,wx_bombadil,1 point,Mon Dec 8 19:12:53 2014 UTC,"Wow, I had no idea that could happen, can you expand a bit on what you mean when you say ""conditions are right""? When does this typically happen?"
chemicalreactiongifs,2onqxz,Komberal,1 point,Mon Dec 8 23:19:42 2014 UTC,This graph illustrates it pretty well.   When the ambient temperature and vapor pressure are between the two curves that means the air is supersaturated with respect to ice but not with respect to water. That means the ice crystals will continue to grow while the liquid water evaporates. This typically happens in thunderstorms when the air rises and cools but it can happen anywhere those two conditions are met. It's called the Bergeron Process and it's responsible for things like fallstreak holes (the wispy clouds in the middle are ice crystals and the ones around it are liquid water).
chemicalreactiongifs,2onqxz,wx_bombadil,1 point,Tue Dec 9 00:13:13 2014 UTC,"Bergeron process:       The Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process (after Alfred Wegener, Tor Bergeron and W. Findeisen), (or ""cold-rain process"") is a process of ice crystal growth that occurs in mixed phase clouds (containing a mixture of supercooled water and ice) in regions where the ambient vapor pressure falls between the saturation vapor pressure over water and the lower saturation vapor pressure over ice. This is a subsaturated environment for liquid water but a supersaturated environment for ice resulting in rapid evaporation of liquid water and rapid ice crystal growth through vapor deposition. If the number density of ice is small compared to liquid water, the ice crystals can grow large enough to fall out of the cloud, melting into rain drops if lower level temperatures are warm enough.

chemicalreactiongifs,2oqa9q,hutihati,3,Tue Dec 9 17:31:00 2014 UTC,"Shamelessly stolen from this comment by /u/MitchB3  the last time a similar gif was posted  Paramagnetism of Liquid Oxygen  Gfycat Version (More frames, color and larger).  Source.    This gif is displaying some magnetic properties that can be observed in Liquid Oxygen. Liquid oxygen can be made with the aid of liquid nitrogen, by taking a canister or tank of oxygen and passing it through a copper coil submerged in liquid nitrogen. The coil leads to a container that can capture the liquid oxygen created from the submerged coil. The reason this can happen is because liquid oxygen has a higher boiling point than liquid nitrogen, allowing the gaseous oxygen in the tube to eventually condense and become a liquid without freezing.  When O2 gas is made into a liquid, it gains a slight blue coloration to it due to the manner in which electrons are arranged in the oxygen. The oxygen has some unpaired electrons (normally electrons are paired) that gives it a magnetic property. The reason unpaired electrons do this is because electrons in all molecules actually have magnetic dipole moments, though they are small and tend to cancel out when electrons are paired. So in this case with liquid oxygen having unpaired electrons the magnetic effect that electrons all have becomes noticeable and in return the oxygen molecule exhibits magnetic properties. When the liquid is poured over a magnet the molecules will align to the magnetic from the magnet creating an induced magnetic field of its own. Overall this scenario is known as ""Paramagnetism"". The liquid oxygen eventually fades away because it boils off, similarly to how liquid nitrogen quickly boils off when left alone. You can see as it boils off the for a moment the ""mist"" it gives off is still attracted to the magnets.  Here is another gif showcasing this scenerio.    Overall this is one of the many areas where Physics and Chemistry meet. The phase change dynamics of Oxygen are mainly Chemistry, though Chemistry is also a study of electrons. Everything regarding magnetism is usually dealt with in Physics."

If w/w, like 18M/l otherwise like 10M/l. Either way, fairly strong.  It'd probably react fairly well with less concentrated acid though. I've done sugar + H2SO4 (pretty much the same reaction with sugar instead of cellulose) with hardware store 70-80% acid and it still reacts vigorously. So unless you're trying to measure some particular property as opposed to just a quick ""hey kids, look at this!"" it's probably not super picky."

You can make little eggs that pop and are filled with juice.  I recommend larger drops.

You said it yourself, they increase your chances of getting lung cancer by a mile. And most normal minded people will agree that cancer is pretty toxic...  My point being, 60 or so years ago when cigarettes were purely regarded as a fashion statement, people were very skeptical when medical organizations started claiming smoking had fatal repercussions. Their logic was that it was ""cool"" and giant businesses endorsed it, and giant business are run by smart people who understand what they're selling. Giant businesses would never promote anything that would damage their customers' health, right? Wrong.  Tobacco has been around for a couple thousand years, but only in the last half century have we discovered how dangerous it is. Why is that? Because only in the last half century have we had the ability to investigate the health defects properly. Our current standards for how healthy this Japanese ""food"" is might become completely irrelevant in the next twenty years when we discover what happens when these chemicals interact with our body. This theory applies to everything we do: staring at LED screens, eating GMOs, disposing of radioactive waste in our oceans, the list goes on. It could very well be these products are harmless, but there's honestly no way of knowing.

chemicalreactiongifs,2og75n,ooopepper,1 point,Sat Dec 6 13:54:49 2014 UTC,Came here to say this. In chemistry at school we basically did exactly the process in OP's Gif but with other chemicals to make nylon.
chemicalreactiongifs,2og75n,blupp,60,Sat Dec 6 18:46:00 2014 UTC,How does this reaction happen mind me asking?
chemicalreactiongifs,2og75n,boarhog,131,Sat Dec 6 11:28:26 2014 UTC,The liquid probably contains dissolved alginate and the powder probably contains calcium. When calcium comes into contact with an alginate solution the alginate instantly gels/solidifies through ionic crosslinking between the negatively charged alginate chains and the positively charged calcium ions.  In this gif the calcium only lies on top of the solution so only a layer of the alginate solution below the powder is solidified. When you pull this solidified layer through the powder you get gradually more and more alginate exposed to the calcium powder giving what you see in the gif.
chemicalreactiongifs,2og75n,SANPres09,17,Sat Dec 6 12:09:11 2014 UTC,"Is this in anyway similar reaction to polymerisation?  I'm not sure if I even remember correctly but I remember seeing a video where some machine seemed to be pulling Nylon out of this colored liquid, and it was said to be an examplenof polymerisation.  To clarify, it looked as if the nylon was being created as it left the liquid, much like in this animation"
chemicalreactiongifs,2og75n,boarhog,17,Sat Dec 6 14:39:45 2014 UTC,Yes! That nylon is formed as a layer between those two chemicals (whose names escape me right now) and they polymerize. This is also a similar reaction as that. The molecules on the surface crosslink and polymerize and then crosslink to the next layer as it forms due to it getting pulled up.
chemicalreactiongifs,2og75n,monty624,3,Sat Dec 6 14:56:59 2014 UTC,Awesome!
chemicalreactiongifs,2og75n,blupp,3,Sat Dec 6 15:13:21 2014 UTC,"I made nylon in a similar way to this gif in an ochem lab awhile back. My first though was seriously, ""nylon candy?"""
chemicalreactiongifs,2og75n,boarhog,3,Sat Dec 6 18:23:43 2014 UTC,"Polymerization is a reaction where smaller molecules bind chemically (covalent bonds) together forming long chains (polymers). Nylon production is an example of this, as the long nylon polymer molecules are formed from much smaller molecules reacting together.  Alginate is already a polymer (long) molecule, and when it reacts with calcium the alginate chains in the solution are ionically (not covalently) crosslinked with calcium as ""glue"" in between the alginate molecules, forming a gel network. So what is shown in the gif is not really a polymerization reaction as the bonds formed are ionic, not covalent."

chemicalreactiongifs,2og75n,behringer__,4,Sat Dec 6 18:43:16 2014 UTC,"Section 5. Sodium alginate of article  Alginic acid:       As a flavorless gum, it is used by the foods industry to increase viscosity and as an emulsifier. It is also used in indigestion tablets and the preparation of dental impressions.  A major application for sodium alginate is in reactive dye printing, as thickener for reactive dyestuffs (such as the Procion cotton-reactive dyes) in textile screen-printing and carpet jet-printing. Alginates do not react with these dyes and wash out easily, unlike starch-based thickeners.  Sodium alginate is a good chelator for pulling radioactive substances from the body, such as iodine-131 and strontium-90, that have taken the place of their non-radioactive counterparts.   It is also used in immobilizing enzymes by inclusion.     Interesting: Calcium alginate | Gaviscon | Laminarid | Natural gum   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

chemicalreactiongifs,2oddoj,Rock_Carlos,19,Fri Dec 5 23:04:55 2014 UTC,"The water is ""supercooled,"" which means that it is below it's freezing point. Water usually freezes at 0 C, but this water is colder than that. In order for a phase change from liquid to solid to occur, however, a single point must initiate that change; that point is known as the ""nucleation point."" The inside of a water bottle is very smooth, and if the water is undisturbed, then no bubbles form either, so there is no nucleation point inside of that water bottle. When the bottle is poured out and encounters a surface, a nucleation point is formed, initiating instantaneous phase change. Maybe that was more like ELI12?"

chemicalreactiongifs,2oa02j,autowikibot,2,Fri Dec 5 00:22:35 2014 UTC,"Sponge (material):       A sponge is a tool or cleaning aid consisting of porous material. Sponges are usually used for cleaning impervious surfaces. They are especially good at absorbing water and water-based solutions.  Sponges are commonly made from cellulose wood fibers or foamed plastic polymers. Some natural sponges are still sold, but most are now used either as body or facial sponges (bath sponges) or as tools for sponge painting.  The three other categories of available synthetic sponges are: low-density polyether (known as the rainbow packs of non-absorbent sponges), PVA a highly absorbent material and polyester.

chemicalreactiongifs,2o703m,themichelinman,2,Thu Dec 4 02:44:25 2014 UTC,"Because it's the hottest.  Where the pencil sits on the metal cylinder would be slightly cooler due to conduction. At the end, at the connections you can see the wood part burning away too. It takes longer though due to the pencil tip been sharpened."
chemicalreactiongifs,2o703m,themichelinman,3,Thu Dec 4 00:21:56 2014 UTC,"Where the pencil sits on the metal cylinder would be slightly cooler due to conduction.   This doesn't seem to explain the gif though. Wood isn't a good conductor of heat and the contact area between the wooden pencil and metal is very small. You can see the burning slow down around the contact point when it gets there but not by any significant amount.   At the end, at the connections you can see the wood part burning away too.   But why the middle?"
chemicalreactiongifs,2o703m,lilnomad,1 point,Thu Dec 4 02:44:43 2014 UTC,"Wood is definitely not a good insulator, that's exactly why it starts at the centre, The whole pencil with the same diameter wood will heat up at the same time.   Where the wood is in contact with the metal cylinder will be at a lower temperature than the rest due to the cylinder conducting heat away from the pencil.  Where the pencil has a different diameter of wood surrounding the graphite will also have a lower temperature due the pencil being sharpened."
chemicalreactiongifs,2o703m,themichelinman,2,Thu Dec 4 08:29:42 2014 UTC,"Wood is a good insulator and a bad conductor of heat and electricity. That's why you can hold a burning match without burning your fingers.  The contact area between the metal cylinder and the pencil is probably a couple square millimeters at most which is definitely not enough to conduct heat away from the pencil to cause it to burn this way, especially since wood doesn't conduct heat well to begin with."

chemicalreactiongifs,2o703m,Bad_Sock,4,Thu Dec 4 02:59:36 2014 UTC,You didn't even try. Clearly the electrons meet in the middle and have nowhere to go so they shoot out and blast out the wood in the middle. Then the exposed surface area causes the middle to burn because it's sitting over a charcoal chimney because he's starting some charcoal to grill burgers tonight.

chemicalreactiongifs,2o703m,Lars--Himself,3,Thu Dec 4 16:05:10 2014 UTC,"What this gif lacks, is a view of the power source, showing a static voltage, and an increasing current.  Most conductors become worse at conducting electricity at the temperature goes up, but graphite (and ceramic conductors in general) are opposite. They become better conductors as the temperature increases.  So if you hooked this up to 12V, you'd see that the amps would start around 2 or 3 ampere, and as the temperature went up, it would increase towards 10 or so (as far as I recall, varying with lenght of pencil, hardness of graphite, things like that)  And the increase in heat would increase exponentially instead of linearly. Fascinating stuff."

chemicalreactiongifs,2o24ve,RainbowDarter,31,Wed Dec 3 15:49:26 2014 UTC,I was curious about the pink color and you might be too. If you look at the source video linked by OP they added some phenolphthalein as an indicator to see if the pH of the water changed. The pink color shows that the water did in fact turn fairly basic (at least above 8.2).  A fun fact about phenolphthalein is that is used to be used as a laxative. Anyone with even the smallest bit of chemistry background is probably fairly familiar with it as an indicator in titrations.

Phenolphthalein is often used as an indicator in titrations. For this application, it turns colorless in acidic solutions and pink in basic solutions.  Phenolphthalein is insoluble in water and usually is dissolved in alcohols for use in experiments. It is a weak acid, which can lose H+ ions in solution. The phenolphthalein molecule is colorless, and the phenolphthalein ion is pink. When a base is added to the phenolphthalein, the molecule ⇌ ions equilibrium shifts to the right, leading to more ionization as H+ ions are removed. This is predicted by Le Chatelier's principle.

chemicalreactiongifs,2o24ve,absynthminded,3,Tue Dec 2 22:42:38 2014 UTC,"Water is just water: the difference lies in the amount of impurities in the water being used. That is to say, the difference is in the quantity of other things (beyond H2O) in the sample. Many reactions are sensitive to impurities and when accuracy and repeatability are critical (in research for example) the majority of chemists will use purified water.  A fun fact: there are varying levels of ""purity"" that are well defined for laboratory usage."

In steps my little brother.  I did it to him and he thought it was great, so he did it to our grandmother.  Only he didn't use enough of the powder.  You were supposed to measure out the powder and water ahead of time so it would both gel and stick to the cup.  He just added some powder, added some water, stirred for a little to long, and threw.

The decomposition will catalyze itself, which is why the reaction speeds up once it starts; the mere presence of tin pest leads to more tin pest.   So basically it starts at one point due to a defect or whatever and spreads from there because it is much easier to grow than to initiate in a new place. Kind of like how, under the right conditions, you can have crystals start forming at only a few points in a solution which leads to a few large crystals rather than many small ones."

What I've said earlier about ammonia catalyzing the ammonium dichromate combustion is wrong :C  In short, burning ammonium dichromate is added to an Erlenmeyer flask that contains a few milliliters of 25% ammonia solution. The first reaction:  (NH4)2Cr2O7 → Cr2O3 + N2 + 4 H2O  The chromium (III) oxide produced above then catalyzes the oxidation reaction of the ammonia vapours that emerge from the solution. This reaction happens above the liquid due to the vapours being all vapoury 'n stuff.  The second set of reactions:  2 NH3 + 2 O2 → N2O + 3 H2O  4 NH3 + 3 O2 → 2 N2 + 6 H2O  More information on the background and setup: http://www.chemicalconnection.org.uk/chemistry/topics/view.php?topic=3&headingno=11 http://www.rsc.org/education/eic/issues/2009Jan/ExhibitionChemistry.asp    Video source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfsz7gsgiII  Background:  This is what you get when you add hot ammonium dichromate (yes, the hexavalent and carcinogenic chromate) to a flask containing ammonia vapors.

chemicalreactiongifs,2nm3sb,JuicyMangoes,1 point,Fri Nov 28 07:57:11 2014 UTC,"You can do a similar demo (though a little less impressive) with either platinum or copper wire as the catalyst.  According to that site, the copper version gets hot enough to melt the copper (which would look awesome, as long as it is done safely inside a fume hood where nothing bad would happen if the flask shattered).  You can also use methanol instead of ammonia (I've done this with platinum and apparently it works with copper wire too - formaldehyde, which is toxic, will be produced)."
chemicalreactiongifs,2nm3sb,JuicyMangoes,2,Fri Nov 28 22:22:01 2014 UTC,"So this is different from the related demo where ammonium dichromate is burned to produce finely divided chromium(III) oxide, which then catalyzes the oxidation of the ammonia?"

Like sure, it may have the type of cells we call pain receptors, it may have opioid receptors - but if you connect in vitro a single pain receptor to a single pyramidal cell, would it feel pain in any meaningful sense? Just how complicated should a neural network be for its capability of having qualia to be in question?"
chemicalreactiongifs,2nhx0o,maxikov,60,Wed Nov 26 22:10:47 2014 UTC,Here's hoping beings with much more complex minds don't come along and think that way about us humans. I think it might be better to assume that they do feel pain than to assume they don't.
chemicalreactiongifs,2nhx0o,wildmonkeymind,45,Wed Nov 26 22:43:00 2014 UTC,"The strongest argument I've heard for why most insects probably can't feel pain is that pain evolved to keep you from doing things that hamper your long term survival. For something with a lifespan on the order of a few days to months long term learning is less important than finding a mate ASAP. I agree that we should assume they could feel pain when it comes to exploding them for our own amusement, since if we're wrong that would really suck."

chemicalreactiongifs,2nhx0o,civetservescoffee,8,Thu Nov 27 05:52:50 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I doubt it really needs pain receptors for what it does, or if it even panics at the prospect of slowly exploding.  Makes it even easier to kill them with a clear conscience!"

chemicalreactiongifs,2nhx0o,three_man,2,Thu Nov 27 02:16:39 2014 UTC,40% will turn your skin white within seconds and I will burn itch for maybe half hour.  It will go back to normal in a couple hours.  Wouldn't want to dunk my hand in it though.

chemicalreactiongifs,2nhx0o,tdasnowman,89,Wed Nov 26 22:57:06 2014 UTC,"True Story: I used to work for a medical device company that had 2 buildings separated by a parking lot. We tested a lot of products on cows blood. I'm talking sometimes 50 gallons a week. The pollution control agency gave us a permit that allowed us to dump a certain amount down the drains in the sinks.  Now in the other building, we had a manufacturing plant that made a product that had a primary ingredient of 30% Hydrogen peroxide. They were allowed to dump excess down the drain as well. Where the two sewer systems met in the parking lot (on more than a few occasions), blood + concentrated H2O2 blew manhole covers off, and oozed a nasty white foam such as this."

chemicalreactiongifs,2nhx0o,ultrachilled,37,Wed Nov 26 20:27:30 2014 UTC,"A developer contracted various and sundry companies to design, plan, and build an office with parking lot. Once the project was finished, time passed. One night, the parking lot exploded!  Not in fire, but in water.  I do not remember the specifics because it only comes up when there is a new person or we have a company party and someone wants to brag, but I think one contractor didn't think he had enough space to build or lay something one place and chose another without asking.  Fire hydrants do not only consist of a pipe, a 90 degree angle to the surface, and a hydrant fixture. Required below grade is a specially compacted (and sometimes cement) bunker. This takes the pressure off the angle in the water pipe and stops the shaking of the fixture in case of hammering or other vibrations.  Well that contractor cut into the bunker. It was only a matter of time. Maybe too many people flushed their toilets at once that night.  Something like a hundred feet of line ripped out of the ground late at night in an empty parking lot, throwing dirt and asphalt everywhere.  They call it the golden hydrant because of all the insurance, liability, bond, and other payments which ensued."

After one or two seconds they heard a soft 'boom' but didn't get worried. When one of them entered the bathroom later, everything was shit. Apparently they had blown the sewer piping of the house."

chemicalreactiongifs,2nhx0o,Moaz13,9,Wed Nov 26 22:13:25 2014 UTC,"That's more because of health standards. Contamination is a very real danger, so there has to be some measure taken to keep a barrier between the customer and the raw meat. That means either plastic packaging or a glass case. Since most supermarket meat departments aren't available for all of the store's business hours, they put the meat on styrofoam platters and use saran type wrap to seal it up. It doesn't mean the store received it that way, it's just the most convenient way to ensure the customer has access to the product during the store's business hours.  Most supermarkets still have a cutting room where bulk meats are broken down and processed into smaller cuts. Having containers of blood for sale, however, is most definitely not a common thing unless the meat department is processing animals from start to finish or someone had them special order it and couldn't take the entirety of what was shipped.

The blood may be in the form of blood sausage, as a thickener for sauces, a cured salted form for times of food scarcity, or in a blood soup.  This is a product from domesticated animals, obtained at a place and time where the blood can run into a container and be swiftly consumed or processed. In many cultures the animal is slaughtered. In some cultures, blood is a taboo food.    Image i     Interesting: Hematophagy | Svartsoppa | Czernina | Blood   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

chemicalreactiongifs,2mgrs1,jpcassil,1070,Sun Nov 16 14:04:51 2014 UTC,"Baking soda and vinegar rarely clear out a drain. Most of the resultant CO2 never makes it into the plumbing.  If you've got a grease or other similar obstruction, the safest and easiest way to deal with it is to take the two largest pots you have and fill them with water. Heat  to a rolling boil, and then pour it down the drain. Refill both and repeat. The hot water is much more effective at clearing a clogged drain than this.  If you would still like to use baking soda and vinegar, pour the baking soda down the drain (If your sink is already backed up, scoop out the effluent so you can get access to the drain). Follow with vinegar, and Place the drain plug on the sink immediately  This allows for the gas to travel downward and dislodge any objects blocking the drain.  Edit  Source: Have had backed-up pipes in very cold climates repeatedly. It is often a VERY VERY VERY bad idea to repeatedly pour drano for a blockage: It is simpler, arguably safer, far more environmentally friendly, cheaper and far less toxic to simply pour hot water down the pipes.   If you have PVC pipe in your house underneath your sink, then you should DEFINITELY not be pouring drano or other caustic agents down your drain. Boiling water will only have an effect if used repeatedly, every day, etc etc, in which case you may want to look for toddlers or pets willfully pushing things into the drainage system, or speak to your landlord about the pipes.

chemicalreactiongifs,2mgrs1,BeejRich,1 point,Sun Nov 16 18:38:18 2014 UTC,"So drano is predominantly lye, a common name for caustic soda, which is basically a substance made from ashes that's extremely basic and dissolves fats and proteins. But, it doesn't just do that, it's also corrosive toward plastic and especially rubber, which is what every juncture in your plumbing system uses to keep water from leaking.   Just as important, drano isn't neutralized when it leaves your house - It continues being drano when it gets dumped into the ocean, or rivers/lakes/streams. This is not good for wildlife, or for municipal sewage systems.  This doesn't mean that you can't use Drano, it just means that you use it very rarely, as it will physically damage your plumbing system. It's much safer and easier to use boiling water, as your plumbing system is designed to accommodate that, and it's MUCH more ecologically friendly.   Also, don't flush wipes down your toilet, even if they're marketed as 'flushable'."

Drano most likely wont hurt your pvc pipes unless you are doing it  like 5 times a day every day.. if you havnt cleared your drain by then why are you even doing it.

As a result, if you use boiling hot water and a degreaser/surfactant (e.g. soap), you can get a hairball moving.

The other product of that reaction is carbonic acid H2CO3, which decomposes into H2O and CO2 (gas). The idea is that the gas causes agitation of the clog, dislodging it.  I'm not saying this is a good method to unclog the sink. Most likely the reaction takes place before reaching the clog. If you could some how target the clog with the two reagents, then that might work. Then again, a good old plunger will also cause agitation."

chemicalreactiongifs,2m2rxn,joca63,11,Wed Nov 12 17:02:30 2014 UTC,Thanks. I was expecting this answer. So what is happening here? Water is being dropped onto sodium which in a violent exothermic reaction forms NaCl?
chemicalreactiongifs,2m2rxn,EasternEuropeSlave,31,Wed Nov 12 18:35:24 2014 UTC,The greenish gas in the flask is chlorine. I think the water is just to provide some heat when it reacts with the sodium to jumpstart the sodium-chlorine reaction.
chemicalreactiongifs,2m2rxn,browb3aten,12,Wed Nov 12 18:41:06 2014 UTC,Now that is fucking fascinating. I regret I didn't go study chemistry after high school.

chemicalreactiongifs,2m2rxn,MC_USS_Valdez,9,Thu Nov 13 13:53:51 2014 UTC,"Don't try eating that salt; because of the water, there's gonna be a nonnegligible amount of sodium hydroxide in there.

chemicalreactiongifs,2m2rxn,scottsadork,2,Thu Nov 13 05:03:27 2014 UTC,"Water is dropped onto the sodium, that rests on chlorine.  The reaction of water with sodium catalyzes the formation of NaCl by adding energy. You see the NaCl in the form of white smoke at the end of the reaction."

Its a phenomena that occurs when you have nucleation of a new phase where initially you'll have a lot of smaller volume nuclei but the favored state is to be one large particle (due to surface area versus volume relationships).

chemicalreactiongifs,2klfxn,ComeAtMeFro,6,Tue Oct 28 20:04:32 2014 UTC,Uhhhhh can someone eli5 what is happening?
chemicalreactiongifs,2klfxn,VRTemjin,8,Tue Oct 28 20:13:05 2014 UTC,"It would appear that a Storm Glass contains a mixture of pure water and alcohol and two salts dissolved into it, potassium nitrate (otherwise known as saltpeter, a common ingredient in some fertilizers, as a gunpowder oxidizer, and a few other things) and ammonium chloride (another common ingredient in fertilizers and some other miscellaneous applications), as well as camphor.  Basically, crystals form from the salts in the water, clumping together while displacing the liquid ever so slightly, so they begin to slowly appear and fall to the bottom. More crystals form and they begin settling on the bottom, and it looks like you've made a self-sustaining snow globe for a while. In the beginning of that video you can see all of the crystals that form at the top and fall down, but there's so much of this happening near the end that they flow back up instead of settling.  From what I understand, changes in temperature will cause this mixture to crystallize in the first place, but the specific mixture used does it very slowly. It is reminiscent of sodium acetate (hot ice) or supercooled water, where a change in the energy can be the catalyst for crystal formation, except both of those examples use very fast-acting physical reactions."

chemicalreactiongifs,2k7b7m,digitalgoodtime,26,Fri Oct 24 15:27:21 2014 UTC,It's a miniature recreation of a comet. Here's the source video I made the gif from which shows you how to make one.
chemicalreactiongifs,2k7b7m,digitalgoodtime,13,Fri Oct 24 15:30:10 2014 UTC,So it's micro-simulation of a comet sweating balls when it gets close to the sun.  The tail we see is called sublimation?
chemicalreactiongifs,2k7b7m,SirNoName,33,Fri Oct 24 15:35:21 2014 UTC,Sublimation is the process of a substance going directly from a solid to a gas.  A comet experiences this when it gets close to the sun   edit: jesus people /u/_ThatsNoMoon has a much better post below
chemicalreactiongifs,2k7b7m,digitalgoodtime,21,Fri Oct 24 15:39:15 2014 UTC,To say that the comet is sweating balls when it gets close to the Sun is an understatement! Sublimation is the term for when a substance heats up turning from a solid to a gas (skipping the liquid phase). The iconic tail of the comet is a result of that sublimation.
chemicalreactiongifs,2k7b7m,aghamenon,0,Fri Oct 24 15:39:46 2014 UTC,But surely there must be a liquid phase for even a split second?
chemicalreactiongifs,2k7b7m,digitalgoodtime,25,Fri Oct 24 15:48:48 2014 UTC,No. It's defined by it's lack of transition through the liquid phase. It's different from just a quick transition of solid to liquid to gas.
chemicalreactiongifs,2k7b7m,aghamenon,3,Fri Oct 24 15:54:22 2014 UTC,"Wow, that would take some intense heat.  I understand the comet doesn't have an atmosphere (ozone layer) to protect it from the suns heat, but is the suns heat that intense to cause that kind of sudden change from solid to gas?  The comets we see are burning through our atmosphere, but what about the sublimation that occurs in space.  Is that just from direct heat from the sun?"
chemicalreactiongifs,2k7b7m,digitalgoodtime,17,Fri Oct 24 16:02:08 2014 UTC,"Intense heat is not required. This is kind of a complicated trick that might go against most peoples' common sense or personal model of reality.   Taken from wiki:   At normal pressures, most chemical compounds and elements possess three different states at different temperatures. In these cases, the transition from the solid to the gaseous state requires an intermediate liquid state. Note, however, that the pressure referred to here is the partial pressure of the substance, not the total (e.g., atmospheric) pressure of the entire system. So, all solids that possess an appreciable vapor pressure at a certain temperature usually can sublime in air (e.g., water ice just below 0 °C). For some substances, such as carbon and arsenic, sublimation is much easier than evaporation from the melt, because the pressure of their triple point is very high, and it is difficult to obtain them as liquids.   If more explanation is required, let me know. This is most easily explained through physics and chemistry(applied physics). A tl;dr would be fancy triple point magic with things like pressure and temperature playing tricks.   Edit: This might help. Visual representation of phase diagram"
chemicalreactiongifs,2k7b7m,alahos,5,Fri Oct 24 16:07:09 2014 UTC,Thanks for the explanation.  I haven't studied physics since high school so this will take some time to get my head around.  I appreciate your taking the time to explain.

chemicalreactiongifs,2k7b7m,Almustafa,1 point,Fri Oct 24 23:26:50 2014 UTC,but isn't gas just floating liquid with ions that are faster and farther apart?
chemicalreactiongifs,2k7b7m,catskul,3,Fri Oct 24 16:14:28 2014 UTC,"Actually both gases and liquids are generally composed of neutral particles (liquids may have ions disolved in them, but the bulk is non-ionic). The real difference between liquids and gases is that the particles in liquids can more relative to each other, but can't escape because of forces holding them together, think surface tension. In gases, the particles can still move relative to each other, but now there's basically no forces between them so there's nothing holding them together."
chemicalreactiongifs,2k7b7m,aghamenon,2,Fri Oct 24 18:42:44 2014 UTC,The difference between gas and liquid is surface tension.
chemicalreactiongifs,2k7b7m,FreeGuacamole,2,Fri Oct 24 16:26:43 2014 UTC,"No not really. It's a distinguishable phase from liquid, however I think what you're getting at is the continuum. Yes phases are often similar to each other. The ""just floating liquid with ions that are faster and farther apart"" is a pretty huge difference with massive implications. It may seem like those few characteristics are insignificant however they're anything but.   I am not an accredited chemist or physicist. This is just my current understanding after some education on the matter. Someone with a more intimate understanding or degree would be more able to answer your question.   Distance might seem minor but cooling gas (of bosons) down can lead to Bose-Einstein condensate. This allows for a macroscopic observance of quantum effects. There are very interesting emergent effects from tweaking some fundamental characteristics of matter like separation distance or temperature."

chemicalreactiongifs,2k0hxa,heymanitsmematthew,2,Tue Nov 4 16:40:43 2014 UTC,How many frames per hour does one have to take?
chemicalreactiongifs,2k0hxa,FrontierPhysiatrist,9,Thu Oct 23 16:23:45 2014 UTC,"I was shooting at one frame every 30 minutes (2 frames per hour). This was on the assumption that the drying process would only take 48-72 hours.  However to get even lighting throughout the days/nights we put up the apple in a low-traffic room in our house with blackout curtains drawn and only a fluorescent light illuminating it. This significantly extended the drying time so it actually took more like eight days, leaving me with way more frames than I needed. Three seconds of 24fps video only requires 72 frames, so I only used a fraction of the frames I shot."
chemicalreactiongifs,2k0hxa,wintremute,3,Wed Oct 22 18:51:19 2014 UTC,"Thanks :) A few more silly questions:   Do you just shoot jpegs and then stick them into a video editing program? How do you manage the shooting process? Do you shoot manually, or do you have an automatic setup?"
chemicalreactiongifs,2k0hxa,TheCSKlepto,3,Wed Oct 22 20:43:06 2014 UTC,"I shoot RAW because I have greater control over the calibration of the image. In particular with this shoot, the white balance of the camera relative to the light in the room wasn't great on any setting, and shooting JPEG would have limited me to just the handful of camera defaults. Shooting RAW allowed me to dial in the exact temperature/tint combo for the best colors.  All images were processed in RawTherapee, an excellent free / open source RAW image processor that runs natively on Linux. I used RawTherapee to calibrate a single image in the set, apply the calibration to the entire site, and then batch process all images into cropped and scaled JPEGs. To stitch those together into a video I used MEncoder. From there I had a file that could be uploaded directly to gfycat.  As for the shooting process I shot this with a Canon 7D and an intervalometer (this one specifically). Shooting in full manual mode with total control of the light conditions allowed for never needing to alter camera settings and the intervalometer allowed for fully automatic shooting on the interval of my choosing (every 30 minutes). All I ever had to do was check periodically to pop in fresh camera batteries as needed."

chemicalreactiongifs,2jxb75,pootytangluver619,3,Wed Oct 22 02:45:34 2014 UTC,"Well, the problem is more due to the fact that it's low melting/boiling points (they go down as you move down group 1) combined with its vigorous radioactivity cause it to vaporize itself. We could, in theory, generate enough francium to study its macro-scale chemistry (as we have with plutonium and many of the trans-uranides, Np, Cm, etc.), but its own physical properties mean that the metal would just spontaneously evaporate under the heat of its own radiation.  Edit: redundancies."

chemicalreactiongifs,2jxb75,mrJalostaja,1 point,Wed Oct 22 15:21:06 2014 UTC,"I assume it's because alkali metals always have a 1+ charge, and due to the fact oxygen is all around us with its 2- charge, it tends to react very quickly."

The oxygen in the air all around us has a charge of 0, since it is bonded with itself to form O2. While they can react with the air, its quite slow in comparison to H2O which can readily react with the Li to produce a LiOH salt and H2 gas, which is causing the fire/explosions with alkali metals."

The little ball is moved into the right position and then magnetically moved across and down one side and then back up the other.  This motion moves the liquid in the pipe in a circular motion, thus mixing the two liquids.  Pretty darn cool."
chemicalreactiongifs,2jrbhv,thumperj,25,Mon Oct 20 05:34:37 2014 UTC,when would such a technique need to be used to mix 2 chemicals though. thats what confuses me
chemicalreactiongifs,2jrbhv,tospace2006,93,Mon Oct 20 05:41:48 2014 UTC,"When you need to mix microscopic amounts of stuff. Science, tiny science."
chemicalreactiongifs,2jrbhv,Luvmuchine,22,Mon Oct 20 05:52:47 2014 UTC,"In the life sciences this mixing could be used if you were studying how cells react to a stimulus (e.g. yeast cells and pheromone). The mixing in most microfluidic devices works by passive diffusion. You can control the flux of two liquids, usually media and media doped with the stimulant, into a channel. The channel is usually long and snakes back and forth. Over the course of the channel the two layers of media and media with stimulant will become mixed by diffusion and due to any turbulence that occurs along the path. This ensures that the cells are exposed to a homogeneous solution.  By controlling the amount of flow of either pure media or media with stimulant you can regulate the dosing the cells receive in precisely controlled manner. This active mixing could potentially remove the need for the long, snaking channels. However, it also introduces an unnecessary complication.   Edit 1: You should be able to see an example of one of these microfluidic devices on page 128 of this thesis: https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7dt00921#page-128  Edit 2: The time scale for complete mixing to occur in the passive mixing example I've provided in the Edit 1 is about 15 seconds, which is plenty fast compared to the molecular or transcriptional changes you will most likely be observing in the case of a living cell."
chemicalreactiongifs,2jrbhv,gooddarts,14,Mon Oct 20 06:49:12 2014 UTC,"It turns out that very small amounts of fluid don't behave like the big amounts we're used to. For example, when two microscopic pipes join like this, the fluids coming out of both sides don't actually mix on their own. They just flow down either side of the big pipe."

chemicalreactiongifs,2jrbhv,pVeqlsnRT,6,Wed Nov 12 22:30:33 2014 UTC,"also the flow channel is probably only a few millimeter or less in diameter. that is why the liquid appears to be so viscous, although it might very well just be water. are you sure about the magnetic force acting on the mixer?  my first guess was a static electric charge on both sides of the channel, charging the mixer back and forth."
chemicalreactiongifs,2jrbhv,crowbahr,1 point,Mon Oct 20 05:51:53 2014 UTC,I've used a lot of mixers and it usually is a gyrating magnet while the mixer is a coated neodymium magnet.

chemicalreactiongifs,2jrbhv,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Oct 20 21:53:56 2014 UTC,"Magnetic stirrer:       A magnetic stirrer or magnetic mixer is a laboratory device that employs a rotating magnetic field to cause a stir bar (also called ""flea"") immersed in a liquid to spin very quickly, thus stirring it. The rotating field may be created either by a rotating magnet or a set of stationary electromagnets, placed beneath the vessel with the liquid. Since glass does not affect a magnetic field appreciably (it is transparent to magnetism), and most chemical reactions take place in glass vessels (i.e. see beaker (glassware) or laboratory flasks), magnetic stir bars work well in glass vessels. On the other hand, the limited size of the bar means that magnetic stirrers can only be used for relatively small (under 4 liters) experiments. They also have difficulty dealing with viscous liquids or thick suspensions. For larger volumes or more viscous liquids, some sort of mechanical stirring is typically needed.

chemicalreactiongifs,2jrbhv,MasterMunch,44,Mon Oct 20 21:54:28 2014 UTC,"Oh hey! The authors from that paper are all in my department, and of them is a close friend. I've seen enough presentations about this work to explain the basics. /u/thumperj's explanation was mostly correct, though it missed a few things. The light and dark chemicals are both just mineral oil, but one is dyed so you can actually see the mixing.  More interestingly, the little ball isn't moving due to magnetism, it's moving due to electric charge. There's a battery hooked up to the system so the top wall is positively charged and the bottom wall is negative. The little ball is a conductor. When the ball hits the top wall, some positive charge is transferred to the ball. The ball is then attracted to the oppositely-charged bottom wall, and when it hits the bottom wall the charge is transferred again, it becomes negatively charged, and is now attracted by the top wall again.  They called the process ""contact charge electrophoresis"" because the ball is moving due to electrostatic attraction (electrophoresis) that is a result of charge transfer from physical contact.  I'm happy to answer any lingering questions!   Edit: The gif is definitely not an animation. It's a video taken with a high speed camera mounted on a microscope. That ball is only a 10 micrometers wide, and the video is slowed down by ~30x or so."

chemicalreactiongifs,2jrbhv,Altair1371,4,Mon Oct 20 23:10:09 2014 UTC,"Right. The top and bottom are hooked up to a battery. If the liquid was conductive, the battery would just short through the liquid. It's the same reason why sticking your tongue into an electrical socket isn't a great idea."

Butter acts as a shortening, meaning that it shortens the chains of gluten that are formed when you mix the ingredients. It is unable to hold as much carbon-dioxide, but that bread will be really tough and chewy since the gluten chains are still intact and intertwined. Bread that has not been kneaded enough will have the same problems of being tough and chewy."

It's just boiling the liquid more easily in the nucleation sites of the ball and causes uneven distribution of force to the ball as it expands while traveling upwards through the column of water.

chemicalreactiongifs,2j6p43,absynthminded,41,Tue Oct 14 04:01:21 2014 UTC,"This occurs because liquid oxygen is paramagnetic. If you've taken a general chemistry course, you may have had to draw molecular orbital diagrams, where you put up and down arrows representing electrons in spin states. When atoms bond, their atomic orbitals overlap and form molecular orbitals. It is this overlapping that is the actual bond itself. Now in the case of an O2 molecule, the highest occupied molecular orbital consists of the overlapping of the symmetric P orbitals Px and Py. Since there are only 2 electrons at that level, they fill in the separate shells and are both have the same spin because of Hund's Rules. Now this leaves us with 2 unpaired electrons, which creates a magnetic moment for the molecule. In normal air, these are pointing every which way because there's nothing forcing them the same way. But if we apply a magnetic field such as in this gif, it will align and act as a magnetic substance."

chemicalreactiongifs,2iv3dk,Cartiledge,62,Fri Oct 10 15:55:22 2014 UTC,Eriochrome Black T is dark blue when in the absence of metal ions and in an acidic environment . When dropped into a solution with metal ions it rapidly turns to a pink solution. Based on the video I assume that the chelating (surrounding of the metal ions) reaction is rather energetic. When dropping the Eriochrome Black T into a solution the reaction is occurring quickly but unevenly resulting in cool patters and currents.

While SF6 is inert during normal use, when electrical discharges occur within SF6 filled equipment, toxic by-products can be produced that pose a threat to the health of workers who come into contact with them.    Its also a greehouse gas and has a Global Warning Potential of 22,800. So 1Kg of SF6 released into the atmosphere has the same effect on global warming as releasing 22,800Kg of Co2.

Measurements of SF6 show that its global average mixing ratio has increased by about 0.2 ppt (parts per trillion) per year to over 7 ppt.  Sulfur hexafluoride is also extremely long-lived, is inert in the troposphere and stratosphere and has an estimated atmospheric lifetime of 800–3200 years.  SF 6 is very stable (for countries reporting their emissions to the UNFCCC, a GWP of 23,900 for SF 6 was suggested at the third Conference of the Parties: GWP used in Kyoto protocol).  Average global SF6 concentrations increased by about seven percent per year during the 1980s and 1990s, mostly as the result of its use in the magnesium production industry, and by electrical utilities and electronics manufacturers. Given the low amounts of SF6 released compared to carbon dioxide, its overall contribution to global warming is estimated to be less than 0.2 percent.

""Global War[m]ing Potential of 22,800"" is a useless statement. What you actually meant was ""over 100 years, sulfur hexaflouride is estimated to have a GWP of 22800."" The reason that's important is that the estimated GWP of the same gas over 20 years is 16300. Here's a handy table from the IPCC TARs:     20 years 100 years 500 years    2001 TAR 15100 22200 32400   2007 TAR 16300 22800 32600    You have to be specific about this stuff because you then say things like   So 1Kg of SF6 released into the atmosphere has the same effect on global warming as releasing 22,800Kg of Co2.   ...which is missing a ""over 100 years,"" and changes the statement quite a bit. It's incorrect to say that without the additional context, because over a different period, the ratio is different. It's not a direct comparison.  All of that being said, there are far fewer quantities of sulfur hexaflouride in the world than carbon dioxide.

chemicalreactiongifs,2io5ev,mirchman,7,Wed Oct 8 19:54:45 2014 UTC,"Hey, so I work with both fluorescence and droplet imaging as a small part of my master's thesis so I have some experience with this.   As far as imaging droplets go, to see any real change in surface tension curvature I've needed to get above ~ 100-150 fps footage (for nano sized droplets at least). Otherwise it just looks like a slowed down version of exactly what you see in that video, where at the point of contact, the droplets suddenly just merge.  In order to get good frames per second you need a really low exposure time which means you need really bright light. The problem is that when you do fluorescence imaging you need to turn the lights off and your only light source becomes the faint, faint glow of the fluorophores.  So, to answer your question, even if you have fluorescence that's really bright it's unlikely to be bright enough to bring the exposure time down to the limits you'd need for high speed footage capable of showing you changes in surface tension. At least not with traditional equipment; you may well be able to customize something if this is the specific goal you have in mind but you don't need fluorescence to image droplets you can just use regular light to do that!"

I'm not big into the physics of it but if I had to try to explain it I'd guess that quantum yield will dictate the ratio of photons absorbed to photons emitted (a sort of energy efficiency of the fluorophore) and excitation decay time (time it takes to decay back to ground state) will limit amount of photons absorbed in a period of time."

U-238 decays by emitting alpha particles, which carry energy around 4.5 MeV. For comparison, visible light photons carry between 1.5 and 3.5 eV.  What you see is mostly alpha decay, which doesn't go far (something like 6 to 10 cm).

Water requires a non-gaseous surface to make the transition from a vapour to a liquid; this process is called condensation. In the atmosphere, this surface presents itself as tiny solid or liquid particles called CCNs. When no CCNs are present, water vapour can be supercooled at about -13°C (8°F) for 5-6 hours before droplets spontaneously form (this is the basis of the cloud chamber for detecting subatomic particles).

At the right energy, this could be a visible light photon – less energy and it's infrared (or microwaves etc.), more energy and it's ultraviolet (or x-ray etc.).  But an alpha particle (or any other 'radioactive' particle) would just completely knock the electron out of its hull, thus ionizing the atom... hence the name ionizing radiation."

In the same way your wifi can go through walls, small alpha particles can ""go through"" the barrier imposed by the forces which hold the uranium nucleus together. This is called tunnel effect.  Because uranuim nucleus are so massive, they are relatively unstable, and eventually decay by emitting these apha particles (which btw, are exactly like helium nucleus, 2 protons and 2 neutrons) with a really high energy.   These particles  collide with the gas in the chamber, bouncing against its nucleus or sending away its electrons (since those are bound with much lower energies). An atom that has lost an electron is charged, and I guess that for these gas that means it glows, like the gas in a fluorescent lamp, so we can see the path the alpha particle took when travelling through the gas."

However this looks like an ore sample, which contains all of the radioactive daughter products in the decay chain as well. Since the half life of uranium is so much longer than its daughter products, the total radioactivity builds up over time until it reaches equilibrium. That is the decay rate of each daughter product equals the rate it is produced by its parent, U-238."

This is what causes the quick, sporadic growths."

chemicalreactiongifs,2i0uaw,dabork,16,Fri Oct 3 11:16:42 2014 UTC,Can someone explain to me what is happening here? Does the motion make the colour change? Or is it heat?
chemicalreactiongifs,2i0uaw,Tbone139,16,Wed Oct 1 21:35:42 2014 UTC,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briggs%E2%80%93Rauscher_reaction has quite a bit of info about the occurring reactions; it would seem that the color changes are more uniform in a stirred solution   The essential features of the system depend on two key processes (These processes each involve many reactions working together): A (""non-radical process""): The slow consumption of free iodine by the malonic acid substrate in the presence of iodate. This process involves the intermediate production of iodide ion. B (""radical process""): A fast auto-catalytic process involving manganese and free radical intermediates, which converts hydrogen peroxide and iodate to free iodine and oxygen. This process also can consume iodide up to a limiting rate.    But process B can operate only at low concentrations of iodide, creating a feedback loop as follows:  Initially, iodide is low and process B generates free iodine, which gradually accumulates. Meanwhile process A slowly generates the intermediate iodide ion out of the free iodine at an increasing rate proportional to its (i.e. I2) concentration. At a certain point, this overwhelms process B, stopping the production of more free iodine, which is still being consumed by process A. Thus, eventually the concentration of free iodine (and thus iodide) falls low enough for process B to start up again and the cycle repeats as long as the original reactants hold out.    The slowly increasing amber colour is due to the production of free iodine by process B. When process B stops, the resulting increase in iodide ion enables the sudden blue starch colour. But since process A is still acting, this slowly fades back to clear."
chemicalreactiongifs,2i0uaw,SulfuricSomeday,6,Wed Oct 1 21:43:04 2014 UTC,"From the wiki:   The detailed mechanism of this reaction is quite complex.[9][18] Nevertheless, a good general explanation can be given.  The essential features of the system depend on two key processes (These processes each involve many reactions working together):  A (""non-radical process""): The slow consumption of free iodine by the malonic acid substrate in the presence of iodate. This process involves the intermediate production of iodide ion. B (""radical process""): A fast auto-catalytic process involving manganese and free radical intermediates, which converts hydrogen peroxide and iodate to free iodine and oxygen. This process also can consume iodide up to a limiting rate.   The colour changes seen during the reaction correspond to the actions of the two processes: the slowly increasing amber colour is due to the production of free iodine by process B. When process B stops, the resulting increase in iodide ion enables the sudden blue starch colour. But since process A is still acting, this slowly fades back to clear. The eventual resumption of process B is invisible, but can be revealed by the use of a suitable electrode.[6]  It basically seems like a more complex iodine clock reaction."

Tin pest has also been called tin disease, tin blight or tin leprosy (Lèpre d'étain).  It was observed in medieval Europe that the pipes of church pipe organs were affected in cool climates. As soon as the tin began decomposing, the process accelerated.  With the adoption of the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) regulations in Europe, and similar regulations elsewhere traditional lead/tin solders have been replaced by solders containing primarily tin, making prevention of tin pest and related problems such as tin whiskers a modern technological challenge.

In this system, each cell remains unchanged until some neighboring cell has a modular value exactly one unit larger than that of the cell itself, at which point it copies its neighbor's value. One-dimensional cyclic cellular automata can be interpreted as systems of interacting particles, while cyclic cellular automata in higher dimensions exhibit complex spiraling behavior.

Alexandrite absorbs the yellow and blue parts of the spectrum, so we see what's left over, a blend of the red and green light. Since there was more red to begin with, it looks red.   The sun, on the other hand, has more blue/green than red and so under that light, the stone absorbs the yellow and blue and there is more green left over than red, so it looks green.   edit: Added candle to first paragraph to align with video."

chemicalreactiongifs,2g18g6,Riddla26,3,Thu Sep 11 00:25:46 2014 UTC,They did. If you look at the candlestick and the tips of the fingers they're clearly illuminated by another light source. I'm still not sure what I'm supposed to be looking for. A semi-translucent gem in primarily white light looks white/blue and in red light looks red... surprised?

chemicalreactiongifs,2g18g6,ArmyCop65,1 point,Thu Sep 11 00:47:08 2014 UTC,Thank you for adding that part.  I thought there was something that I was supposed to see that was physically happening to the shape of the stone.  I didn't realize that the color was the thing.
chemicalreactiongifs,2g18g6,funkybum,2,Thu Sep 11 15:54:02 2014 UTC,Still don't get it... The ball made the flame on the candle less white?
chemicalreactiongifs,2g18g6,Pliskin01,1 point,Thu Sep 11 00:01:24 2014 UTC,"First, make sure you can see the color change of the stone. Some color-blind people aren't getting the change (see below).   If you watch closely, the stone changes color from green to red when the light source switches from a light containing more green light to the candle, which contains more red light."
chemicalreactiongifs,2g18g6,burtness,1 point,Thu Sep 11 01:56:28 2014 UTC,I assumed the change was artifacts from the camera or gif at first.
chemicalreactiongifs,2g18g6,MikeWhiskey,15,Thu Sep 11 17:06:01 2014 UTC,"Different ""white"" light sources give off different amounts of the color spectrum. This doesn't matter to our eyes, which interpret all of these light sources as white. But Alexandrite absorbs some of the waves in the visible spectrum, meaning it exhibits the color of the non absorbed light. When all of the colors are in equal intensity, Alexandrite looks like this. When exposed to sunlight, which has more  blue light, Alexandrite looks like this. And when exposed to candle light, which is more red, Alexandrite looks like this.  TL;DR Alexandrite has absorbs two wavelengths in the visible spectrum, meaning it appears differently when exposed to different light sources."
chemicalreactiongifs,2g18g6,MikeWhiskey,8,Wed Sep 10 21:00:23 2014 UTC,"To further expound, if you look at the graphs in the above diagrams, you see the parts of the visible spectrum that are absorbed by Alexadrite. If you look at the colors outside of the peaks, you can see the light that is reflected back. These colors determine the color that we see the gem as being.  Not sure why I wasn't able to articulate that in my first comment."
chemicalreactiongifs,2g18g6,throwawaygemologist,2,Wed Sep 10 21:03:49 2014 UTC,"Alexandrite is a beautiful stone.  Many people have never heard of this unique gem.  Some other gemstones also exhibit color change.  Alexandrite is probably the most well known.  Other examples of gemstones that have varieties exhibiting color change are garnet, sapphire, and spinel.  More information on Alexandrite can be found here."

chemicalreactiongifs,2g18g6,tehbored,1 point,Thu Sep 11 12:33:17 2014 UTC,"Is it synthetic or is it not even chemically the same? Synthetic stones should produce the same effect and have high clarity, right?"
chemicalreactiongifs,2g18g6,nate800,1 point,Thu Sep 11 13:35:14 2014 UTC,"Synthetic alexandrite either has little-to-no color change or it has a vast, unrealistic color change. There are a few labs that make a VERY good synthetic alexandrite, but those will be far too perfect, free of the natural inclusions that make real alexandrite sparkle so brightly.   I've seen both side by side. A $10,000 near perfect high-color change natural stone and a equally-sized lab-created stone. The lab created stone was just different. I wish I was more educated on the proper vernacular to explain what I mean.  You also get value from the rarity. Alexandrite isn't like diamond, which has its value inflated by controlling the output of the mines. There are very few Alexandrite mines in the world, and most produce very small stones. A natural alexandrite measuring over 1.5 carats with high clarity and good color change is extremely rare whereas a natural diamond over 1.5 carats with high clarity would be readily available at 5 stores in your local mall."
chemicalreactiongifs,2g18g6,childofthebears,2,Thu Sep 11 13:54:40 2014 UTC,"Make sure to read the description though. They might be lab created stones.

Having never seen one in real life, I could be wrong."

The first couple times I watched it looked like the stone became darker due to the light being shut off.  Then I determined that they must be moving their hand for a reason and only then it dawned on me that the stone must have different characteristics in different light.

Because of this, his body temperature is ridiculously hot in comparison- The large difference in temperature creates a vapor layer that basically insulates the hot from the cold. The LN directly in contact with his skin vaporizes instantaneously, producing a gas layer that stops him from turning into a Popsicle. (note all the vapor streaming from his body?) Drop a droplet of water into a super hot pan, and you'll see it bead up and bounce around instead of boiling away-the same thing Edit:  Source: 4th year chem student, have played with LN. Also played with hot plates and squirt bottles. fun fact: If you shoot some water into a superheated sandbath, the bead of water will exhibit the leidenfrost effect, but since it's surrounded by heated sand, it makes a mini sand geyser. 2nd source: been super bored with sandbath and squirt bottle"

chemicalreactiongifs,2ffis7,WeWillFallTogether,34,Thu Sep 4 13:40:17 2014 UTC,"While your description of the effect is accurate I feel he would have sustained burns. On skin, for a fraction of a second, the effect is fully insulative. When exposure time is increased, burns take little time to form.   In the example displayed the man pours it onto his head while fully clothed and with a full head of hair. LIN is very low viscosity and once it has cooled a porous material (which is very quick when said material has a low specific heat capacity) it will flow through like water through a tennis racket.   This fabric/hair can then trap the LIN against skin, rapidly causing burns. It is for this reason that people handling LIN must wear special cryogenic handling gloves, which are extremely non-porous as well as being flexible at low temperatures."
chemicalreactiongifs,2ffis7,sprucenoose,30,Thu Sep 4 07:55:28 2014 UTC,"This is correct. If he was bald or wearing some kind of protective headgear, this is a relatively safe thing to do. But allowing the LIN to get caught in your hair like that can easily cause frostbite."

chemicalreactiongifs,2ffis7,SunDragon1947,2,Thu Sep 4 10:57:10 2014 UTC,Thanks for the explanation. I've been seeing the Leidenfrost effect around lately in different context so it was cool to see it explained like this!  Bonus: special thanks to the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon.

I bet, ""death by asphyxiation due to oxygen displacement,"" is probably a dime a dozen at the coroner's office. Dying from that because you poured LN2 on your head might be an uncommon way to die, but I'm sure there's a been more than a few chemists who died that way because they didn't account for all the variables in the situation."
chemicalreactiongifs,2ffis7,I4gotmyoldpassword,6,Thu Sep 4 07:47:26 2014 UTC,"It's happened where people have been carrying containers of liquid nitrogen in elevators, they've got stuck and it's displaced the oxygen."
chemicalreactiongifs,2ffis7,That0neGuy,1 point,Thu Sep 4 07:52:48 2014 UTC,He is outside and it is a relatively small volume of LN2.  Frostbite from trapped LN2 is the bigger danger here.

chemicalreactiongifs,2ffis7,themindlessone,1 point,Thu Sep 4 22:23:04 2014 UTC,"We did something like this in chemistry class once. The main instruction was to make sure the liquid nitrogen couldn't pool anywhere. He's kinda half hopping in the video, so I'm guessing this is assurance against clothing or skin cooling if there is a bit of pooling before it vaporizes."

chemicalreactiongifs,2ffis7,konaborne,6,Thu Sep 4 14:18:51 2014 UTC,"Realistically he probably was. The Leidenfrost effect only happens on bare skin. His hair on his head would hold the LN2 on his scalp long enough that the air layer would cool sufficiently to for the nitrogen to make contact. He was very stupid to have done this. Had he shaved his head and done it naked, he would have been fine. I would be very surprised if he didn't lose hair and got frostbite on his scalp."

Thích Quảng Đức  (1897 – 11 June 1963, born Lâm Văn Túc), was a Vietnamese Mahayana Buddhist monk who burned himself to death at a busy Saigon road intersection on 11 June 1963.  Quang Duc was protesting the persecution of Buddhists by the South Vietnamese government led by Ngô Đình Diệm. Photographs of his self-immolation were circulated widely across the world and brought attention to the policies of the Diệm government. John F. Kennedy said in reference to a photograph of Duc on fire, ""No news picture in history has generated so much emotion around the world as that one.""  Malcolm Browne won a Pulitzer Prize for his photograph of the monk's death.     Quang Duc's act increased international pressure on Diệm and led him to announce reforms with the intention of mollifying the Buddhists. However, the promised reforms were not implemented, leading to a deterioration in the dispute. With protests continuing, the ARVN Special Forces loyal to Diệm's brother, Ngo Dinh Nhu, launched nationwide raids on Buddhist pagodas, seizing Quang Duc's heart and causing deaths and widespread damage. Several Buddhist monks followed Quang Duc's example, also immolating themselves. Eventually, an Army coup toppled Diệm, who was assassinated on 2 November 1963.

Put a few bottles in your freezer and wait like three or four hours. Take one out and shake it a little and you should see this reaction if it is cold enough. If it doesn't work, try again in a hour. If the water is starting to get ice crystals or is frozen, it is too late for the poor guys."

chemicalreactiongifs,2ey54z,CroMagnum_PI,11,Sat Aug 30 04:23:29 2014 UTC,"i don't think this is the leidenfrost effect, at least as how it is described on wikipedia:   The Leidenfrost effect is a phenomenon in which a liquid, in near contact with a mass significantly hotter than the liquid's boiling point, produces an insulating vapor layer keeping that liquid from boiling rapidly.    the liquid is water.  the mass is the dry ice.  the dry ice's temperature is way below the water's boiling temperature.  the dry ice is just undergoing sublimation, solid to gas.  i do see the thin insulating gas layer over the ice, but as wiki described it, the insulating layer doesn't define the leidenfrost effect."
chemicalreactiongifs,2ey54z,innitgrand,9,Sat Aug 30 03:24:55 2014 UTC,That is correct. This is just sublimation and not the Leidenfrost effect.
chemicalreactiongifs,2ey54z,shaggy1265,3,Sat Aug 30 13:35:25 2014 UTC,Molten iron? You mean the water in your hand boils instantly to create an insulating layer of steam? Doesn't sound like a good thing. LN2 is just the opposite of the dry ice in water. In this case it's the cold thing you drop into it evaporating (much like the described Molten iron) and in the other case it's the cold thing that it is dropped into (liquid nitrogen).
chemicalreactiongifs,2ey54z,MrNeurotoxin,1 point,Sat Aug 30 03:48:58 2014 UTC,I'm not sure exactly how it works but you can dip your wet finger into molten metal for a second and be fine. Mythbusters did it with molten lead.

chemicalreactiongifs,2ey54z,kneel_armstrong,4,Fri Aug 29 23:21:05 2014 UTC,sublimation =/= Leidenfrost effect.

chemicalreactiongifs,2ey54z,2ndhorch,1 point,Sat Aug 30 15:40:17 2014 UTC,There's also CO2 coming up pretty quick too - could it not be a CO2 gas bubble around the dry ice that's making what appears to be a Leidenfrost experiment?
chemicalreactiongifs,2ey54z,omnomelette,12,Sat Aug 30 01:06:44 2014 UTC,"it is a CO2 bubble around the dry ice  if leidenfrost is defined by ""hindered heat transfer through gas phase between a hot and a cold medium"", then this is a leidenfrost effect in the video... i don't know, maybe inverse leidenfrost?  in this case you could argue that the gas phase around the solid CO2 would also be there at any temperature above -78°C... so no leidenfrost?"
chemicalreactiongifs,2ey54z,2ndhorch,1 point,Fri Aug 29 21:04:47 2014 UTC,Hmmm interesting. I think I got stuck thinking about the effect as a drop of water in a pan and air separates them so there's 3 media of completely different composition. I this video you still have 3 different media but 2 are co2. Silly me!
chemicalreactiongifs,2ey54z,gradies,2,Fri Aug 29 22:08:08 2014 UTC,not exactly - with the water in a pan example the water (liquid) is separated by water (steam) from the pan
chemicalreactiongifs,2ey54z,omnomelette,1 point,Fri Aug 29 22:50:36 2014 UTC,"It is still the leidenfrost effect in both cases, and in both cases the insulating gas phase is the same composition as the ""cold"" medium. ""Hot"" and ""cold"" are relative in the definition. The drop is ""cold"" enough to be a water drop but the gaseous water that boils off insulates it from the ""hot"" pan, so it stays a droplet for longer than it would if the pan was colder and there was no insulation barrier. Similarly if the ""hot"" water was cold enough in the glass to prevent the CO2 bubble then the dry ice would melt faster."
chemicalreactiongifs,2ey54z,2ndhorch,1 point,Sat Aug 30 10:38:51 2014 UTC,Clearly I need to read up on the effect... Thanks for the help though :)
chemicalreactiongifs,2ey54z,gradies,1 point,Sat Aug 30 03:31:44 2014 UTC,thing is: the dry ice can't* melt... so is it still the leidenfrost effect?  *not in the mentioned setup
chemicalreactiongifs,2ey54z,sivadneb,1 point,Sat Aug 30 08:46:15 2014 UTC,"Yes it is still the leidenfrost effect because it is still a gas phase, insulating the ""hot"" and ""cold"" mediums, generated by the phase change of the ""cold"" medium into a gas. Whether the cold medium is a liquid or a solid is unimportant. In this case the ""hot"" medium is a liquid instead of a solid pan as well. Again all that matters is that the gas emitted by the ""cold"" medium insulates further phase change, thus slowing the process down. As an aside, I will mention that if the pressure was high enough you could still have a liquid phase of CO2."

Again I apologize I'm pretty ignorant when it comes to chemistry but it fascinates me!  Is the green solution a copper solution? I can't imagine iron in a copper bath does this by itself?
chemicalreactiongifs,2dpklj,EMPEROR_CLIT_STAB_69,20,Sat Aug 16 09:37:59 2014 UTC,It's time-lapse footage as iron atoms and copper ions switch positions in a copper sulphate solution. The solution is blue but appears green due to the yellow background
chemicalreactiongifs,2dpklj,Evaporiser,3,Sat Aug 16 09:55:46 2014 UTC,"I believe it's either a displacement or a double displacement reaction. Basically, the two sticks are, say, FeO, and the liquid solution is CuSo4. (I doubt these chemicals would actually react together like this, they're just examples) the iron molecules are attracted more to the Sulfate than the O2, so it essentially swaps places with the Copper. But actually, now that I think about it, double displacement reactions occur when mixing two liquid solutions and a precipitate forms. So disregard what I said (unless someone more chemically fluent says I'm right)"
chemicalreactiongifs,2dpklj,Omnilatent,7,Sat Aug 16 09:58:42 2014 UTC,"Chemistry major here! You are correct mostly, the two sticks are either pure iron or an iron salt. If they are pure iron they will undergo a single displacement reaction, if it is iron oxide, it will be a double disp. In the case of a single displacement it is more simple, the iron is just ""more reactive"" than the copper, and jumps into solution kicking the copper out. (Don't think copper is not reactive though, I have used it as a pretty awesome catalyst before, it is just less reactive.)"

chemicalreactiongifs,2dkqbt,hotshowerscene,66,Thu Aug 14 20:59:28 2014 UTC,Superfluid helium occurs when liquid helium is cooled to 1K (-272.15C). At this extremely low temperature the viscosity of the fluid becomes zero.  This means that when this fountain is initiated and the fluid is kept super cold (so energy input - rather output - is still required) it will never stop running due to the complete lack of friction.  Because of this property superfluids can also climb up the walls of beakers that contain the fluid and escape to a lower gravitational potential energy state without any input.  Here's a video of another superfluid fountain.
chemicalreactiongifs,2dkqbt,sneakysocks,30,Thu Aug 14 21:05:14 2014 UTC,Does the viscosity become 0 or virtually 0. I have a hard time believing there are no frictional losses!
chemicalreactiongifs,2dkqbt,non-troll_account,31,Fri Aug 15 00:39:19 2014 UTC,"I imagine it would be incredibly difficult to use a viscometer on superfluids so I'm not sure. It's stated that it behaves ""like a fluid with zero viscocity"".  The superfluid properties come from quantum behavior where all of the atoms stop interacting with each other and act as one entity, so quite probable that its viscosity has become zero."
chemicalreactiongifs,2dkqbt,throwaway131072,6,Fri Aug 15 00:42:33 2014 UTC,"Huh. It made me immediately think that maybe ""viscosity"" is a term that actually describes multiple discrete phenomena, so that superfluid helium has zero viscosityA but nonzero viscosityB. Not the much more complicated idea that it is two liquids at once."
chemicalreactiongifs,2dkqbt,silv3r8ack,2,Fri Aug 15 03:39:56 2014 UTC,"I was just thinking, what if the irregularity of the fountain deforms the container, even if only by a few nanometers? Wouldn't it take essentially a diamond container (in a vacuum chamber) to make it a perfect system that would ""never"" stop flowing? But then again, since we can't make perfect vacuums either, ""never"" would still not quite truly be ""never""..."
chemicalreactiongifs,2dkqbt,sneakysocks,1 point,Fri Aug 15 05:28:25 2014 UTC,You would still need to cool the helium to 1k and keep it at that temperature so if you include that in the system it would stop flowing when you run out of energy to cool it. That is a more practical problem than creating a true vacuum
chemicalreactiongifs,2dkqbt,etherteeth,3,Fri Aug 15 19:33:33 2014 UTC,"Yeah I've seen that, awesome demonstration of it.   I think the changing viscosity properties depend on the temperature - IIRC helium I begins to transition into a superfluid around 2.1K and the peak superfluidity, or lowest point of viscosity, is around 1K. Not 100% on that."

chemicalreactiongifs,2dkqbt,RedditorSinceTomorro,5,Fri Aug 15 14:54:31 2014 UTC,"Take a look at this video (which is part 3 of a 6 part series on superfluid helium). This sheds some more light on the question of viscosity, though perhaps it raises more questions than it answers.   It turns out superfluid helium shows measurable viscosity in some experiments, but not in others. It is apparently inviscid in that it can flow unrestricted through capillaries of as small of size as desired, and the capillary size doesn't seem to have any bearing on the flow rate.   On the other hand, a motor spinning while immersed in a superfluid causes a fan (also immersed) to spin, when the motor and the fan are only connected via their immersion in the fluid. This demonstrates an apparent viscosity."
chemicalreactiongifs,2dkqbt,aashu1690,3,Fri Aug 15 00:46:28 2014 UTC,I'd actually like an answer to this too.  Studies done with toronto1 and  this study of helium below the λ point from the University of Oregon which measured kinematic viscosity show in their experiments a minimum viscosity of 1.010*10-8 V(m2 /s).  However everywhere I look seems to suggest that a defining property of a super-fluid is that it has no viscosity.    I'm curious where the incongruity lies.
chemicalreactiongifs,2dkqbt,NiceGuyMike,2,Fri Aug 15 18:13:24 2014 UTC,Actually zero. It's similar to superconductivity where the resistance becomes zero.

Since superfluids have 0 internal friction the film will coat the entire container to a thickness of a few microns/couple of hundred angstroms. Once the fluid reaches a point of the container at a lower gravitional state (the bottom of the container) it will begin to drip off. This continues in a self-siphoning manner and the fluid will drain out of the container.  Here's a video showing it happening."

chemicalreactiongifs,2dkqbt,Richardmg9,4,Fri Aug 15 17:54:21 2014 UTC,"This does require some energy input - heat from a light source. Compared to any other fluids this is a minuscule amount of energy needed to keep the fountain in motion, but it isn't 0 energy.  The energy you would create with the waterwheel would be less than the energy input from the light source. Plus to keep the fluid in a supercooled state of 1K requires huge amounts of energy."
chemicalreactiongifs,2dkqbt,SirSid,2,Fri Aug 15 03:10:47 2014 UTC,"Wait, what does the heat from the light source do? Isn't this driven by siphon?"
chemicalreactiongifs,2dkqbt,Richardmg9,1 point,Fri Aug 15 03:15:31 2014 UTC,"Well, that's too keep it that cold on earth, keeping it cold doesn't really factor in as this experiment could be done in a place already this cold.  Also, the fountain won't flow without light?  How does that work?"
chemicalreactiongifs,2dkqbt,the_noodle,2,Fri Aug 15 14:35:54 2014 UTC,Well outer space is 2.7K so that would still be too warm to keep liquid helium in a superfluid state.   The fountain occurs because a source of heat - in the form of light - is introduced below the opening. A form of convection occurs where the cold superfluid rushes up underneath the now heated superfluid and out the nozzle.

Otherwise, you'd see something like the climbing the walls effect.   The coldest known place in space is about 1k, and is the Boomerang Nebula. It gets this cold because it is an area with gasses actively expanding, thus lowering pressure and cooling the nebula.  So, there is a place in the universe with that temperature, but I have no idea how a) you'd set up a lab there, or b) the density of helium would be enough to observer ""naturally"".  http://news.discovery.com/space/astronomy/this-is-the-coldest-place-in-the-universe-131025.htm"
chemicalreactiongifs,2dkqbt,Richardmg9,4,Fri Aug 15 04:07:19 2014 UTC,"Because just as it took work to start the fountain, the liquid exerting force on the wheel would cause the liquid to stop. Once its imparted its inertia to the wheel, and the wheel to a generator,  everything would stop."
chemicalreactiongifs,2dkqbt,the_noodle,2,Sat Nov 22 15:20:09 2014 UTC,That does not make sense to me.  I am speaking of a wheel in the falling part of the liquid.  The falling liquid is going to fall no matter how it got it's potential energy.
chemicalreactiongifs,2dkqbt,Dentarthurdent42,2,Fri Aug 15 04:58:25 2014 UTC,"After it fall, I believe it imparts its energy to liquid below to push it up the tube again. That energy has to come from somewhere. Super liquids just have no friction, they are not an unlimited source of energy.   I am not sure of the exact fluid dynamics that would cause this, but the liquid has to get the energy to flow up the tube from somewhere. Perhaps the fluid that leaves the tube pulls on the fluid behind it due to suction so it acts like a string being pulled through. Either way, if you remove that energy from the system, the fountain will stop."

chemicalreactiongifs,2dkqbt,HoldingTheFire,2,Fri Aug 15 06:38:56 2014 UTC,"top kek, get madder  But seriously, what precisely do you think pressure is? It comes from the force of gravity acting on the fluid, accelerating it downwards. When fluid falls into a pool, its velocity of the pool is still zero, even though the incoming fluid had nonzero velocity. To provide the upward acceleration to reconcile this, the pressure (momentarily!) increases.  Now in most cases, this doesn't matter. The energy from the falling water is dissipated by the turbulence into heat. When talking about a fluid with no friction, though, it is important."

Apologies if I cover anything you already know.   dyed synthetic polymer consisting of white glue   Dyed meaning colored and synthetic meaning made in a lab (or in this case, not naturally sourced), a polymer is a compound made of repeating chemical units. Glue, rubber, plastic, and many (if not most) stretchy materials are polymers.   What do I mean by ""chemical units""? It's helped a bit by this picture from wikipedia showing ethene becoming polyethylene. I'm assuming you understand skeletal formula, if you don't I can give a quick rundown on that. Basically a polymer can be simplified to one ""unit"" (kind of like a LEGO) and the entire molecule described as a number of repetitions of that unit. In this case the unit is two carbons each with a hydrogen on them, as in this picture, and the whole molecule can be thought of as a combination of these LEGO.   which has again been crosslinked with sodium tetraborate in solution   Crosslinking! Crosslinking is actually a fairly simple idea but also one of the most revolutionary. Have you ever heard of vulcanized rubber? Natural rubber is a mess of very long polymer chains sort of freely swimming around with each other.   I can illustrate this a bit better in person, but if you take your arms and put each of your palms on the opposite elbow with your forearms touching and try to move them back and forth you'll find it fairly easy to. There is a bit of resistance but nothing is really stopping each arm (each polymer chain) from freely moving.  Now let's throw in crosslinking. When you crosslink the chains (try doing the same thing with your arms, but this time grab each of your forearms) you bond them to each other in a way that makes the freely moving chains forced to act as one solid whole. In the case of vulcanized rubber the crosslinks are sulfur, but in this case the compound is sodium tetraborate (which you might know as Borax).  Quick summary: It's a more detailed way to say, ""a very viscous dyed liquid""."
chemicalreactiongifs,2dg84l,syslinkdown,14,Wed Aug 13 18:04:22 2014 UTC,"""a very viscous dyed liquid   In this case, though, isn't also important that it's a non-Newtonian fluid, since it's the difference in viscosity at the bottom (lower) than traveling up the rod (higher) that allows it to climb?"

Even the wiki is empty.   Intuitively, I would guess that the rob picks up some liquid, then more liquid gets picked up underneath and pushes the liquid above it. Since the liquid is highly viscous, it doesn't have time to ""run off"" itself back down the pole. I think the max height would then have something to do with how fast the rod is spinning and the liquid viscosity. Once the pull of gravity on the liquid is equal to the force pushing the liquid up (which would be related to how well the liquid holds itself together), it would stop going up.  Keep in mind I'm just talking out my ass, I have no sources for any of this and am more than likely completely wrong. But that's intuition I guess."
chemicalreactiongifs,2dg84l,prohulaelk,19,Wed Aug 13 17:13:05 2014 UTC,"Weissenberg (1947, fig. 1) and Freeman and Weissenberg (1948) described experimental observations involving the flow of a variety of viscoelastic liquids (including saponified oils and polymer solutions) when sheared between rigid walls in relative rotation. The behaviour is very different from that of Newtonian liquids (pure oils and liquids of low molecular weight). The main observations with viscoelastic liquids may be summarized as follows:  (2.1) The liquids climb the inner cylinder in a wide-gap concentric cylinder apparatus; generate a non-uniform pressure distribution on the plate of a parallel-plate apparatus, with the pressure increasing from near zero (i.e. atmospheric) at the rim to a maximum at the centre (on the axis of rotation); and generate a positive axial thrust in the cone-and-plate apparatus. For brevity, I shall refer to these effects collectively as ‘Weissenberg Effects’ (see §7 below).  (2.2) When various liquids are tested, it is found that the Weissenberg Effects are more pronounced in those liquids which (in separate measurements) exhibit the larger recoverable shear strain.  (2.3) Weissenberg Effects are attributed to the generation of stress components representing a ‘pull along the lines of flow’. With those liquids which possess sufficiently long relaxation times, the shear flow can be suddenly stopped and cuts made in the liquid perpendicular to the previous lines of flow; the observed opening-up of such cuts is interpreted as direct evidence of the existence of a pull along the lines of flow.   ...  If, as in our experiments, the lines of flow are closed circles, the pull along these lines strangulates the liquid and forces it inwards against the centrifugal forces and upwards against the forces of gravity.   From this.  So if I understand it correctly, your intuition is spot-on."

This polymer the liquid is made up from contains very long strands (Can be up to a mm in length for some polymers IIRC) so the liquid tends to act like a whole lot of long individual strings tangled together.

This is directly from my area of expertise. To quote the most relevant part from the book ""A Practical Approach to Rheology and Rheometry"" by Gebhard Schramm.   The continuously rotating rotor will create concentric layers of the liquid with decreasing rotational speeds inwards-outwards. Within those layers the molecules will have disentangled and oriented in the direction of their particular layer and being visco-elastic one can assume that molecules on the outer layers will be stretched more than those nearer to the rotor. A higher degree of stretching also means a higher state of energy from which molecules will tend to escape. There is one possibility of escape for those stretched molecules by moving towards the rotor axis. If all molecules move inwards it “gets crowded” there and the only escape route is then upwards.   I've placed the relevant part of the book on imgur if you want to see the diagrams and another example of the weissenberg effect."

Luminol is a white-to-pale-yellow crystalline solid that is soluble in most polar organic solvents but is insoluble in water.  Luminol is used by forensic investigators to detect trace amounts of blood left at crime scenes, as it reacts with iron found in hemoglobin. It is used by biologists in cellular assays for the detection of copper, iron, and cyanides, as well as of specific proteins by western blot.  Luminol can be sprayed evenly across the area, and trace amounts of an activating oxidant will cause the luminol to emit a blue glow that can be seen in a darkened room. The glow lasts for about 30 seconds, but the effect can be documented by a long-exposure photograph. It is important that the spraying be evenly applied to avoid a biased impression, such as blood traces appearing to be more concentrated in areas that received more spray. The intensity of the glow does not indicate the original amount present but indicates only the distribution of trace amounts of substances left in the area.

chemicalreactiongifs,2cxu9g,Envy_This,26,Fri Aug 8 11:24:11 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure it'd be lethal - it'd be quite hard to kill your self with 2000 volts (That's a guesstimation of what those batteries all add up to) of juice running and only a pinch-full of amps through something as resistant as the human epidermis. Let's say you hook up;       223 x 9V batteries in series and you get yourself 2000~ volts to play with;     I (Current) = V/R, so I = 27 divided by resistance, the left-arm to the other arm probably runs somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 MegaOhms (50,000,000 Ohms)       I = 2000/50000000 = 40 MicroAmps (or 0.000040 Amps).      So to get a timing disturbance//off-on signal across an average healthy heart, you'd need AT LEAST say 10 milliamps (0,010 Amps). So you're an order of magnitude away from anything even worth worrying about. That's not to say you wouldn't feel anything, (add more and more batteries in series), lessen the path or resistance (Put the terminal LITERALLY across you heart and moisten your skin with water) and you'll start playing with more dangerous numbers, you'll probably even get some flesh cooking sooner or later... but kill you? Nah, all you've really got to worry about is configuring those batteries to all run in parallel, but even then you wouldn't have enough voltage to pump that current from arm-to-arm//across your heart... and then Mains Voltage (120 and 240 VAC) and Car Batteries (12 volts @ Ludicrous amperage... like 300-400Amps @ Cold-Crank).      EDITED - Because I'm a technician who sucks at maths."
chemicalreactiongifs,2cxu9g,danosaur,6,Fri Aug 8 12:32:02 2014 UTC,"Where did you grab that resistance from? A quick Google give a nominal resistance (for a fully charged 9V) at 1.45Ohm, giving ~350Ohm for 223 cells in series. I'm sure the resistance goes up over the life of the battery, but that's still 5 orders of magnitude below your estimate.

At the voltage present in those batteries, you have less than 1500 ohms of resistance on completely dry skin.  That shit WILL kill you.

Fortuitously, in answer to another bloke who's questioning me (i.e telling me that I'm wrong), I literally just pulled my Fluke 179 out and measured my own resistance from one hand to the other and scored 5.7 MegaOhms of impedance (5,700,000 Ohms). I can post a screenshot of it if you don't believe me. To be fair - it is Winter here so my resistance is probably a bit above average, but I've seen it both higher and lower before.  ""Anything over 50 Volts""? You do realise that that's a rule of thumb yeah?  If ANYTHING over 50 volts was a hazard, we'd all be living in ESD bubbles for fear of death. I guarantee you right now that you, personally are holding a potential difference of more than 50 volts in your body.

Your measurement of your body resistance with your DMM is moot, since it's measuring the resistance of your body across the skin between the probes.  A more reliable measurement from the University of Illinois puts the arm-to-arm resistance of the human body (when accurately accounting for internal resistance as well as the resistance across the skin near the probes) at around the values Teh_Beez cited.  Your example of static shock is also irrelevant, as it is static, and doesn't have the ability to dump anywhere near the amount or duration of current that a battery has.  Batteries have an enormous ability to dump current, and a daisy-chain of hundreds of batteries certainly has the voltage and the current capacity to kill a man, easily."

The jargon use does have a use, as the 575W and 750W halogen lamps and regular old lightbulbs do need to be differentiated.   Then you can jump up to stuff like a 7,000W+ Xenon arc projection lamp.   Low wattage and use in domestic appliances = Bulb High wattage and/or use in specialty situations = Lamp   The above is a rule of thumb, and some odd exceptions apply.

chemicalreactiongifs,2cxu9g,Shadow703793,5,Fri Aug 8 15:29:12 2014 UTC,"Little as 40mA can kill you if it has enough voltage. A 9v is not enough voltage. Also, if you look at the Wiki page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine-volt_battery it says between 565 mA and 1200mA depending on chemistry. HOWEVER, the setup in OPs picture CAN kill you because of the extremely high voltage because they are hooked up in series."
chemicalreactiongifs,2cxu9g,Ikinhaszkarmakplx2,5,Fri Aug 8 15:51:54 2014 UTC,"That's 565-1200 mAh, not mA. It's capacity, not current. Batteries will dump as much current as the resistance allows, up to the point the battery overheats and fails. If you gave it a load of .01 ohms, it would try to put out 900 amps. It would drain the battery in under three seconds, if it held up to the current. On one hand, it wouldn't have much time to heat up before it died; On the other hand, that's 8 kW of power, which means a lot of heat.  The reason you can lick a nine volt and be fine is you're giving it a much higher resistance load. .01Ω is an absurdly low resistance. Human skin is around 1,000Ω at the lowest. 9 volts through that is only 9mA. The lowest DC current you can feel is 5mA.   But yes, that many batteries in series would definitely be dangerous."

chemicalreactiongifs,2cxu9g,Zagaroth,16,Fri Aug 8 02:05:51 2014 UTC,Idiot here!  What's the difference between voltage and amperage?
chemicalreactiongifs,2cxu9g,Moochi,22,Fri Aug 8 03:12:28 2014 UTC,"My favorite way to describe the two is to compare them to water in a pipe.  Voltage is like water pressure.  It can overcome more resistance to continue along its path.    Take a taser for example.  They're pretty low amperage, but very high voltage.  Often in the hundreds of thousands of volts, which allows it to jump through the air (or clothes of a person) to complete the circuit.  Air has a pretty high resistance, which means the taser needs high voltage to be able to make the circuit jump through the air.  Amperage is the quantity of your flow.  Gallons per minute, so to speak, but in electrons.  Literally speaking, it's a measurement of electrons per second passing a point in a circuit."
chemicalreactiongifs,2cxu9g,wolf_man007,15,Fri Aug 8 03:18:39 2014 UTC,"Don't forget, V=IR  Or in this case, I = V/R   The Amperage is directly dependent on the voltage and the resistance of the circuit.  The main reason the wire isn't melting is probably due to a large amount of resistance built in to the circuit since the batteries (which are all old) also sum their Internal Resistance when run in series."
chemicalreactiongifs,2cxu9g,xereeto,3,Fri Aug 8 03:40:28 2014 UTC,"Internal resistance:       A practical electrical power source which is a linear electric circuit may, according to Thévenin's theorem, be represented as an ideal voltage source in series with an impedance. This resistance is termed the internal resistance of the source. When the power source delivers current, the measured voltage output is lower than the no-load voltage; the difference is the voltage drop (the product of current and resistance) caused by the internal resistance. The concept of internal resistance applies to all kinds of electrical sources and is useful for analyzing many types of electrical circuits.

chemicalreactiongifs,2cxu9g,DeathToPennies,6,Fri Aug 8 05:04:25 2014 UTC,"Another way to describe voltage/amperage is like momentum. Something very small, but very fast, has a high momentum. Something heavy and slow also has a high momentum. Speed and Weight being volts and amps respectively, and momentum being wattage. They aren't so much independent things as multiple sides of the same coin. You can even use a transformer to convert high voltage/low amperage power into low voltage/high amperage power, or vice versa."

chemicalreactiongifs,2cxu9g,Scoldering,2,Fri Aug 8 05:34:21 2014 UTC,"also, given a total amount of energy (Watts), Amperage/Current and Volts are inversely proportional. Basically, each measures an aspect of energy. SO the equation is W=A * V (OK, I'm misusing the symbols, but I'm explaining it to the non-techies who don't have the history lesson on why we use I not A)  Anyway, back to W = A * V.  so if Watts, your TOTAL energy remains the same in a system, increasing voltage decreases amperage, and vice versa. Numerical example: 100 watts can be distributed as 10 volts, and 10 amps. You've got a lot of power to run something, but you're going to waste a lot of it as heat getting it over the wire with voltage that low. So you run it through a transformer that gets it up to 20 volts.. but that energy came from some where. So your amps are now 5 (20 x 5 = 100, so we still have the same amount of energy in the system).  This continues to scale, so 100 volts at 1 amp is 100 watts, and 1000 volts at .1 amps is 100 watts, etc.  Reality also includes dealing with issues like energy lost as heat due to resistance, but generally that can be ignored unless dealing with something stupidly sensitive to voltages (I've had to calibrate machines that want 5vdc +/- .01vdc and with no more than .001vac ripple. PAIN IN THE ASS.)"

How can you decide to have a high voltage/low amperage device since the amperage is dependant on the resistance in the circuit?  You say the taser can be 100k volts but what if you complete the circuit with very low resistance? Wouldn't the flow be very high in that case?

chemicalreactiongifs,2cxu9g,DocPsychosis,2,Fri Aug 8 03:19:48 2014 UTC,Your concept of voltage is all wrong. The analog to voltage in a water pipe is water pressure. How thin a pipe is is the resistance. Current is how much water's actually flowing across a point over a given time.

Imagine water in a trough that feeds a water wheel. The height of the trough off the ground tells you how much potential the water has to do work. A trough high above a water wheel will turn the wheel faster than a trough near the wheel. Current is how much water flows from a trough at a given time.  The power you impart to the water wheel is a function of both the height (potential) and the current. So it is with electricity, where power is equal to voltage times current."

A 9v battery has more than enough current, but not enough voltage to drive that current to someone's heart.

chemicalreactiongifs,2cxu9g,cosmicosmo4,2,Fri Aug 8 03:31:19 2014 UTC,"Those batteries are hooked up in 'series' and while that does increase their voltage to around 1800-2000 volts (that's a guesstimation), that amperage doesn't stack, so it's still sitting at the same current output as a single 9V battery (probably less if the internal dynamic resistance of each battery is stacking along with the voltage).      So while the voltage is high enough to create a surge of arc, it's still not sitting in the realms of where static discharge lies (you know that zap you get from rubbing balloons and walking on carpet - that's about ten times more voltage than what these batteries amount to). And with the Amperage down as low as a single 9-Volt battery, you could safely survive this Battery-Centipede."
chemicalreactiongifs,2cxu9g,ElPotatoDiablo,3,Fri Aug 8 04:18:48 2014 UTC,If the current from a single 9V battery were able to flow through the human heart it would cause heart failure.

chemicalreactiongifs,2cq7ai,IgorzM,2,Thu Aug 7 03:19:33 2014 UTC,"There probably is.  Microwaves cause ferrous metal to hold an electrical charge, so the electrodes are probably carrying current.

chemicalreactiongifs,2cq7ai,klutchasaurus,18,Tue Aug 5 23:52:16 2014 UTC,"The easiest way to get plasma blobs is to take a grape and cut it in half longways but leave a little skin connecting the two halfs. Put them on a plate in the microwave with the flat sides down and when you turn it on you will get blobs of plasma that burst out and float away. This happens because the grapes act like a microwave antenna, they absorb the microwaves and develop a voltage, the voltage is usually high enough to cause an arc. The arc is made of super heated  ionized gasses (plasma) that is also electrically conductive. Once the blob gets big enough it will start to absorb microwaves on its own and really start to grow, getting hotter and mor bouyent it will float to the top of the oven leaving some cool sci-fi scars on the paint. You can put a jar over the grapes to.try to catch the blob but the jar will eventually break because of uneven thermal.expansion and the blob will get away.  If you don't want to fuck up your microwave there are plenty of videos on YouTube of other people charing their own."

One would need muriatic acid (HCl, available at most hardware stores), aluminum foil, a test tube or slender glass container with an open top, and either soap or balloons.   Put some muriatic acid in the test tube, drop in a piece of aluminum foil. The aluminum will displace the hydrogen and create (mostly) pure H2. You can either cover up the end with the balloon or use soapy water top create bubbles of pure H2. Using a splint that is long enough, light the end and touch it to the H2 bubble/balloon. The result is a tiny explosion of water synthesis. Please don't go overboard on this.   E: the end result would be water vapor,  among other things, but you would have your oxygen reaction producing a gas. Combustion!"

chemicalreactiongifs,2cf9jf,Vid-Master,2,Wed Aug 13 18:47:49 2014 UTC,"Here's the thing. You said a ""jackdaw is a crow."" Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens. So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

Can someone explain why I did this, I can't for the life of me remember,  Also, sucky side of hydrogen balloons, they will start deflating after only an hour; although put to a flame they make a nice fireball (good information, pure hydrogen is highly flamable, as it mixes with oxygen in the air; 2 parts hydrogen one part oxygen however is highly explosive)"
chemicalreactiongifs,2cf9jf,TThor,3,Sun Aug 3 03:55:54 2014 UTC,If it was very strong hydrochloric acid then there was probably some HCl in the vapor phase along with the H2.  Scrubbing it by bubbling through water would remove most of of the HCl making the gas a purer H2 mixture.

chemicalreactiongifs,2cf9jf,Consequence6,26,Sun Aug 3 07:06:07 2014 UTC,"Well, if the balloon is open the products would go out the same way the air enters.  Airbags already use various compounds such as sodium azide to rapidly inflate on command, maybe that's what you're looking for.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbag#How_airbags_work"
chemicalreactiongifs,2cf9jf,andwithdot,33,Sat Aug 2 14:20:39 2014 UTC,"Yes, but you wouldn't be able to inflate the balloon that way.  Why? Because the volume of gas is dependent pretty much entirely on how many molecules there are (assuming a near-constant temperature), regardless of chemical structure. Best case scenario would be O2(g) + R2(s) -> 2OR(g), which would about double the volume of oxygen initially allowed into the balloon before sealing it (if you didn't seal it, the gas would escape faster than fresh O2 could diffuse in)."
chemicalreactiongifs,2cf9jf,Mataraiki,10,Sat Aug 2 14:22:12 2014 UTC,"Also, since the atmosphere is only ~21% O2, the actual volume increase would only be ~21% at best.  If you actually filled it with pure oxygen then that would be significantly more expensive than to just use a regular air pump or your mouth."
chemicalreactiongifs,2cf9jf,andwithdot,2,Sat Aug 2 14:34:43 2014 UTC,Maybe something that is catalyzed by oxygen or nitrogen or air humidity then ?
chemicalreactiongifs,2cf9jf,urquan,1 point,Sat Aug 2 20:04:37 2014 UTC,"Could be a possibility (I don't think there are any known reactions for which Oxygen is a catalyst), but the cost of manufacturing something like that would far outstrip the point of such a thing.  Anaerobic/oxygen free production facilities aren't cheap."
chemicalreactiongifs,2cf9jf,Mataraiki,2,Sat Aug 2 20:12:11 2014 UTC,"Maybe it could be a heavy gas with weak bonds, when burning splits into two or more pieces where only one part combines with the oxygen, thus releasing more particles than what went in"
chemicalreactiongifs,2cf9jf,boarhog,2,Sat Aug 2 22:58:53 2014 UTC,"Not the best case scenario. You could have something like:  CN4(l) + O2(g) -> CO2 + 2N2  In this example, you would get 3 mol of gas per mol of O2. Of course, you need some cyanogen azide, and faith in that it will not blow up in your face before you add the oxygen..!  Edit: Tetraazidomethane is even better:  CN12(l) + O2(g) -> CO2(g) + 6N2(g)"
chemicalreactiongifs,2cf9jf,Scienceiswisdom,2,Sun Aug 3 07:05:37 2014 UTC,You could use acetylene as it expands when combusted because of the higher temperature.
chemicalreactiongifs,2cf9jf,I_am_therefore,-4,Sun Aug 3 07:30:21 2014 UTC,You most certainly can. The density of a liquid is much higher than a gas. Any reaction that turns that liquid into a gas will inflate a balloon.
chemicalreactiongifs,2cf9jf,tikketyboo,2,Sat Aug 2 18:38:21 2014 UTC,"The density of the liquid doesn't matter, the limiting factor is getting the oxygen to the liquid (or solid) to react.  Say you have 2g (1 mole) of liquid hydrogen in a balloon.  In order to react that, you'll need 0.5 moles of oxygen, which is approximate 11.2 liters at STP.  Even when you react it, you'll have 1 mole/22.4 liters of water vapor (ignoring the fact that hydrogen isn't a liquid and water isn't a gas at STP) because 0.5O2 + H2 -> H2O, which is only doubling the volume of Oxygen put in to the balloon.  Like I said, the volume is almost directly correlated with how many molecules/moles of the gas there are, and when you put O2 into a system, you can, at best, split that into two Os attached to whatever compound to form two other gaseous molecules.  The other possible, but implausible options to create a volume of gas orders of magnitude larger than the oxygen provided are:  Binary liquid system, the oxygen reacts with one to create a compound that causes the second liquid's vapor pressure to skyrocket.  Polymeric liquid R[Y]x, where the O2 reacts with the R and causes the polymer chain to break up into individual Y molecules, which are gaseous (or the O2 reaction causes whatever ridiculously large molecule to break up into gaseous components).  Either or which are either nonexistant, rare (read: expensive), or cause cancer/infertility."
chemicalreactiongifs,2cf9jf,Mataraiki,1 point,Sat Aug 2 19:28:47 2014 UTC,"You're right - sugar can be converted into alcohol and CO2 but is slow and doesn't need O2.  Propane and O2 can be turned into CO2 and H2, but didn't give you either the expansion not the safety required.   Not sure who gave you that down vote. Some Redditors can be strange."
chemicalreactiongifs,2cf9jf,tikketyboo,12,Sat Aug 2 20:34:39 2014 UTC,"If you want to create gas out of a very small volume with a chemical reaction, you should look towards the baking soda/ vinegar route. Anything that involves a solid and liquid would work much better for your expansion since gas takes up an immensely larger volume."
chemicalreactiongifs,2cf9jf,somebilsky,4,Sat Aug 2 15:10:38 2014 UTC,"I would recommend looking for something that wasn't air as a trigger for the reaction.  For example, consider the way emergency ice packs or glow sticks work.  You have two chemicals separated within the larger object.  Break it up and boom, instant reaction.  In your case quite literally an explosion, so you might wanna do the math before making a case study of that."

chemicalreactiongifs,2cf9jf,sellyberry,1 point,Sat Aug 2 16:00:57 2014 UTC,"Why do you want to open the balloon? That seems like an odd trigger to set up.   You can automatically inflate balloons chemically, even through reaction with oxygen, but as others have mentioned you can't do it with standard balloon because the gas would just go out the opening. In first year engineering design we all came up with a method of automatically raising lobster traps by altering buoyancy, mostly through creating or expanding gases, but none of them used opening a balloon, and many of them weren't completely safe(mine created some chlorine for example)."
chemicalreactiongifs,2cf9jf,cwm44,1 point,Sun Aug 3 01:12:42 2014 UTC,"Well, you could always have some sort of one-way valve in the mouth of the balloon that would prevent anything from exiting, right?"
chemicalreactiongifs,2cf9jf,cwm44,1 point,Sun Aug 3 15:31:59 2014 UTC,"Yes, you can theoretically mechanically design a balloon so the entrance prevents escaping air after a very small explosion. You might have to use a mixture of substances instead of a single chemical. For example you could use a tiny about of white phosphorous as an ignition agent, but it would only work during the day in most parts of the world. pretty much anything solid that burns could provide the gas that fills it, but what to choose would depend on the mechanical properties.  Why do you want it to inflate on contact with oxygen?"

It is especially well suited for demonstration purposes because of its visually striking colour changes: the freshly prepared colourless solution slowly turns an amber colour, suddenly changing to a very dark blue. This slowly fades to colourless and the process repeats, about ten times in the most popular formulation, before ending as a dark blue liquid smelling strongly of iodine.

When subjected to a magnetic field, the fluid greatly increases its apparent viscosity, to the point of becoming a viscoelastic solid. Importantly, the yield stress of the fluid when in its active (""on"") state can be controlled very accurately by varying the magnetic field intensity. The upshot of this is that the fluid's ability to transmit force can be controlled with an electromagnet, which gives rise to its many possible control-based applications. Extensive discussions of the physics and applications of MR fluids can be found in a recent book.

chemicalreactiongifs,2bol9j,Industrious_Villain,22,Sun Sep 21 05:46:58 2014 UTC,"Not sure why you're getting downvoted. Jellyfish evolved structurally in response to two basic factors in their environment: being tissue and being surrounded by water. Because they didn't need to stand, and merely needed to take advantage of their watery environment, they evolved into an optimal form for fluid. Fish are hydrodynamic in a different way, and we have mimicked that with boats and spaceships.  In the same way, trees are a response to the way rocks, dirt, air, and sunshine layer up like a 3rd grade density experiment because of gravity. Their energy source is up high, and they can't afford for it to be blocked, so they got tall. But being tall made them prone to falling over, so they grew anchors at the same time.  Meanwhile, trees that evolved to take advantage of water, reflect a more jellyfish-like lateral structure. Though the comparison is imperfect (jellyfish are much more active than trees), the principles are solid."
chemicalreactiongifs,2bol9j,CDanger,5,Fri Jul 25 14:04:11 2014 UTC,"That is what trees look like under the ground... The roots are exposed on Mangroves because of the changing tides, not because it is interacting with the water to propel itself like a Jellyfish.  No different than a regular tree, just with exposed roots.  Oak trees have a far more lateral root structure than you're example, and it isn't to take advantage of leaves."
chemicalreactiongifs,2bol9j,gsav55,3,Fri Jul 25 14:34:00 2014 UTC,"your* example  Again, the tree comparison is imperfect but the principle is sound: living things develop shapes that resemble forms that naturally occur (in physics and inanimate systems) over time because they are directly responding to the conditions of physics and inanimate environments. Unlike a tree, seaweed doesn't have a rigid stalk. Why? It doesn't need one. It's surrounded by water that buoys its less-dense thalli and laminae upwards. It just needs a strong anchor."
chemicalreactiongifs,2bol9j,CDanger,0,Fri Jul 25 15:10:34 2014 UTC,"Its just soggy grass noone can mow because its under water.  But yeah, I agree.  Just a terrible way to correlate a tree and a jellyfish.  Function determines form.  Or is it form determines function?"
chemicalreactiongifs,2bol9j,gsav55,2,Fri Jul 25 15:18:08 2014 UTC,Environment determines all. Deterministic? Yes. Depressing? No.

What I'm talking about is natural selection, which mostly happens on the order of thousands of years. My point is that naturally selected traits and forms are an expression of the physical world and its properties."
chemicalreactiongifs,2bol9j,CDanger,2,Sat Jul 26 16:35:39 2014 UTC,"It actually is a coincidence. It takes that shape because in a weightless environment, the fuel is going to clump together in a sphere. However, since the fuel is burning, it quickly uses up all the oxygen around it causing the fuel to stop burning. Since it stops burning in one area before another, that section of the fuel 'bubble' collapses. When this collapse occurs, more oxygen is brought back to the fuel source and reignites the fuel in that area. This alternating cycle is what causes the burning fuel droplet to appear to be a jellyfish.  *I should add, that what is considered the perfect shape for efficient movement is highly dependent on the environment that shape is moving through. In a vacuum, shape is irrelevant since there is no matter in the way to slow you down (because you don't have to move through it). Inside an atmosphere, that shape is not very efficient because it does not allow you to easily displace the matter in front of you so that you can easily pass through it. Which is why airplanes/rockets/etc. don't look like Jellyfish."

I'm no expert on cameras, but I'm guessing it's like focusing on the flame of a candle in a dark room. Everything but the flame and the small area around it goes black, like space. The cosmic radiation from outside the lab somehow creates the dead pixels which look like stars on the newly darkened background.

When the oxygen mix inside the sphere of fire is depleted locally in one spot it starts to cool and contract, ingesting more oxygen rich air. When the mix is good the flame spreads back into that area rapidly consuming it as a little pulse of fire and propelling the mass as a whole in the other direction. The far side keeps its smooth shape because it is constantly being pushed into fresh oxygen rich air."

When you breathe in a pure nitrogen environment, you're not building up CO2 because you're breathing any remaining CO2 out, but not getting new O2 in. Even worse, you won't know what's happening. As your O2 levels drop, your ability to recognize your loss of cognitive power goes out the window, so you die never knowing you were in danger in the first place.  If you're working with high purity nitrogen, be sure to get circulation of fresh air into the room. That way, even if there's a localized area of nitrogen that causes you to lose consciousness, the room will get more O2 in and you won't die."

chemicalreactiongifs,2bbvai,ConstipatedNinja,5,Tue Jul 22 03:04:08 2014 UTC,"It actually has been suggested as a way to execute criminals, but no country has moved to it as an execution method.   In the US, there was some contention that it was too humane, and that the criminal for some reason or another should know that they're dying. Ultimately, proponents for the death penalty typically see no reason to change it (and if they admit that we're not doing it humanely now, then some feel that they must admit it isn't humane at all), and enough people against the death penalty just shoot it down regardless that the few who say ""the death penalty's inhumane, but let's at least take steps in the right direction"" are drowned out.  Also, in 2007 there was a British commentator and former member of parliament (Michael Portillo) who televised going over different execution methods. His judgement was that nitrogen gas asphyxiation was the most humane method, and was the only method that met his requirements for humane treatment.  So, I suppose the TL;DR is, people have tried to make it an official execution method because it is the most ""humane"" method of execution, but politics is a fickle beast."

Some people claim that the tire pressure stays the same hot or cold, which in my opinion is BS.  Gasses are governed by laws of physics, which state that the pressure and volume are directly related to the amount of gas particles, some constant number and the temperature of the gas.  So no matter what gas, higher temperature = higher pressure, though it's more consistent as there is moisture and contaminates to fluctuate the tire pressure.  This point probably doesn't matter much unless you're racing.  source"
chemicalreactiongifs,2bbvai,Agent_Smith_24,4,Tue Jul 22 15:17:30 2014 UTC,That's a good point about sensors. It would be much easier for an engineer to use any option he wants vs. only corrosion resistant materials.
chemicalreactiongifs,2bbvai,volyer,2,Tue Jul 22 02:59:23 2014 UTC,"Nitrogen is not that unusual in modern cars.  It escapes the tire much less rapidly than air since N molecules are large.  A typical N fill tire will last months without losing too much pressure, whereas air loses 1-2 psi a month depending on what kind of tire and how you use it."

Adiabatic cooling is a magical thing - the key is to keep it as truly adiabatic as you can (hence the confined, insulated volume: keeps heat from getting in). Based off some quick (and very possibly wrong) math, if we assume N2 is an ideal gas, as little as 56 psig should be enough, though you're probably going to need more to actually get a liquid in a dewar jar."

The high purity grade is because he'd planned some exotic welding mix that he never got around to.  I don't know the pressure, but he also gave me a gauge to use for when I decide what to do with it.  Converting to liquid nitrogen with a dewar jar might be cool as a 'for kicks' thing.  The ice cream idea sounds interesting.  I've had a hard time searching out cool things that I think I can do, and that I think I can do safely.  Yeah, I'm aware of some of the safety issues.

chemicalreactiongifs,2b34g2,martinw89,5,Sat Jul 19 03:49:12 2014 UTC,"Blowing agent:       A blowing agent is a substance which is capable of producing a cellular structure via a foaming process in a variety of materials that undergo hardening or phase transition, such as polymers, plastics, and metals. They are typically applied when the blown material is in a liquid stage. The cellular structure in a matrix reduces density, increasing thermal and acoustic insulation, while increasing relative stiffness of the original polymer.  Blowing agents (also known as 'pneumatogens') or related mechanisms to create holes in a matrix producing cellular materials, have been classified as follows: Physical blowing agents e.g. CFCs (however, these are ozone depletants, banned by Montreal Protocol of 1989), HCFCs (replaced CFCs, but are still ozone depletants, therefore being phased out), hydrocarbons (e.g. pentane, isopentane, cyclopentane), liquid CO2. The bubble/foam-making process is reversible and endothermic, i.e. it needs heat (e.g. from a melt process or the chemical exotherm due to cross-linking), to volatile a liquid blowing agent. However, on cooling the blowing agent will condense, i.e. a reversible process.  Chemical blowing agents e.g. isocyanate and water (for PUs), azo-, hydrazine and other nitrogen-based materials (for thermoplastic and elastomeric foams), sodium bicarbonate (aka baking soda, used in thermoplastic foams). Here gaseous products and other by-products are formed by a chemical reaction(s), promoted by process or a reacting polymer's exothermic heat. Since the blowing reaction occurs forming low molecular weight compounds acting as the blowing gas, additional exothermic heat is also released. Powdered titanium hydride is used as a foaming agent in the production of metal foams, as it decomposes to form titanium and hydrogen gas at elevated temperatures.  Zirconium(II) hydride is used for the same purpose. Once formed the low molecular weight compounds will never revert to the original blowing agent(s), i.e. the reaction is irreversible.

chemicalreactiongifs,2arlgd,FrenchKerfuffle,21,Tue Jul 15 23:53:08 2014 UTC,"The difference between fluorescence and phosphorescence if anyone was curious.   First for either of these to occur electrons in a substance need to achieve a higher energy level by absorbing a photon.  How much energy this requires is based on the band gap of that substance.  The band-gap is the energy range in which no electron states can exist, and it can also determine a materials conductivity, transparency, and it's absorption spectra.  Any electron that is occupying an energy level higher than the ground state is said to be excited.   Think of it a bit like rolling a bowling ball up a hill and into some grass.  If you don't apply enough energy the ball will just roll back down to you, because there is no state where the bowling ball can stay on the hill.  If you overcome the threshold though the ball will come to rest in the grass.  It's the same with the electron, it can't exist anywhere on the band gap so photons without enough energy won't be absorbed because they cannot get the electrons past the band-gap. Photons with enough energy can be absorbed though, and will cause the electron to occupy a higher energy level.  In our analogy the grassy patch at the top of the hill.  If the photon is of higher energy than the band gap it can cause the electron to climb to even higher energy levels, which would be like a slight slope leading to more grassy patches right above the first.   In fluorescence these excited electrons fall back down the band-gap and reemit a photon, that phenomena alone is refered to as florescence.  This is what happens with anything that shows up a different color under a black light. It's absorbing the high energy UV light, then falling down the band gap and emitting a photon of a different color.   You may also notice that sometimes this happens and the light that's emitted is a different color than what ever is emitting it usually is.  This is due to an effect called Stokes shift, where the emitted photons are of slightly less energy than the electron gained when it climbed the band gap.  Less energy means a longer wavelength so the emitted light will usually be closer to the red end of the spectrum.  In some things the electrons stay in an excited state for a longer period of time before dropping back to the ground state and emitting their photon.  The period of time between absorption and emission is referred to as the fluorescence lifetime.  To go back to the bowling ball, lets say we really put everything into it and apply a lot of energy,  the ball rolls up the hill, goes through the grass, then up a small hill, through that grass then comes to a rest in the grass at the next hill.  Well the ball can't just roll down the big hill, first it needs to roll down the two smaller hills.  When the electron does this it goes from one energy level to the next and releases its energy vibrationally, as heat.  Then when it's at the band gap it can finally fall all the way down and emit its photon.  In phosphorescence the electrons can't simply fall down the band gap, first they have to occupy certain forbidden energy states.  These are electron states which can't really occur via the standard transitions, but have a chance of spontaneously occurring.  Then from there it will drop down the band gap and emit a photon.  The situation is very closely tied to quantum mechanics, but is roughly analogous to our bowling ball going to the top of the hill then on to a trapdoor that leads to a tunnel which opens up somewhere on the hill, but which will only open randomly.  The bowling ball will be stuck in an excited state until the gate opens, then it will roll down the hill from wherever the tunnel opens up.  The same is true in the case of the electron, it will be stuck in an excited state until it spontaneously loses some energy as heat and occupies a forbidden energy state, similar too our tunnel, at which point it will emit a photon and fall down the band-gap.  Because this is a state which only occurs randomly the electron can be stuck in an excited state for a very long time.  As such this phenomena is used widely in glow in the dark paint.  The light is absorbed then slowly reemited at an exponentially decreasing rate.     In the case of the gif you can see the glow in the dark moon and star emit their light slowly over time through phosphorescence, while the quinine and flouroseine which were emitting via fluorescence stop emitting as soon as the light is turned on and there are no longer any high energy photons to excite the electrons."

chemicalreactiongifs,2ac6df,ExpensiveHookersSuck,39,Thu Jul 10 16:18:55 2014 UTC,"If it's the substance I'm thinking of, it's actually the material that's used in re-usable heat packs.    What happens is that you can heat up the substance (typically by putting it in boiling water) and it will absorb the heat and turn to a liquid.  But it doesn't turn back into a solid, releasing the heat, 'till some sort of catalyst triggers the heat release and re-solidification.  Typically the catalyst in those heat packs is a little metal snapper to create a disturbance to start the chain reaction, but human skin works as a trigger too."

They all each want one but do not know the collective answer for the group without more information. If the first and second logician answer, ""I don't know"", the third knows that they (each) want a beer (since they did not say no), and therefore can answer ""yes"" for the whole group. Had the first or second one not wanted a beer, they could have been confident in saying ""No,"" since their lone ""no"" would make the answer to ""You all want a beer?"" negative."
chemicalreactiongifs,2ac6df,4z01235,23,Thu Jul 10 23:15:21 2014 UTC,"edit: /u/lights_in_the_sky answered it faster, more succinctly, and with a better explanation. Sheesh!  In common speech (at least in English), ""A or B"" means ""Choose between A or B"". You expect to hear ""A"" or ""B"" in response. In formal logic, ""A or B"" is a 'sentence' or 'predicate' (that is, an expression with a value of True or False). You expect to hear ""True"" or ""False"" in response, and you say ""True"" (or ""yes"", in the case of these jokes) if either A or B is true, or both.  The first joke is that the logician wants either a hamburger or a hotdog but can't convey that answer because he feels he can only respond ""Yes"".  The second way funnier joke is more complex. The first logician wants a beer but can't answer ""yes"" or ""no"" to the proposition ""Do you all want a beer?"" because he doesn't know if his friends do or not.  The second logician now knows that his first friend wanted a beer, because if he didn't want a beer, he would have answered ""No"" since if he didn't want a beer, then all of them don't collectively want beers. Therefore logician 2 knows logician 1 wanted a beer. Logician 2 wants a beer, but still doesn't know about logician 3 so he answers ""I don't know"".  Repeat for logician 3, except now since he also wants a beer,and he knows his friends want a beer, then he can answer ""Yes""."
chemicalreactiongifs,2ac6df,tomato_paste,9,Thu Jul 10 23:20:05 2014 UTC,"Let's say we are both logicians and we have another friend with us, Bob, who is also a logician.  The bartender asks us if all three of us would like some beers.  I am the first to answer. I want a beer. So my answer obviously will not be ""no."" However, I also can't say ""yes,"" because I don't know if you and Bob would both also like some beer. So ""I don't know.""  Bob answers next. He also wants a beer. For the same reasons I had, he has to answer ""I don't know.""  You are the last to answer. If you also want beer, then you can finally say ""yes"", because you do want a beer, and by the fact that Bob and I said ""I don't know,"" you know that we must also want beer and were waiting to hear from the rest of the group. If you don't want beer, then you can say ""no,"" since obviously if you don't want beer then it is obviously the case that not everybody in the group wants beer.  Bob and I could also have said ""no"" at our turns if we didn't want beer, because again, obviously if I don't want beer then it must not be that everybody in the group wants beer.  To put this into some programming pseudocode, we have something like this:  bool wholeGroupWantsBeer = wantsBeer(4z01235) AND wantsBeer(Bob) AND wantsBeer(HorrendousRex)  wholeGroupWantsBeer is only true if all three of us want beer. So asking each person in order, if you ever get ""no"", you can immediately stop asking anyone else and say that wholeGroupWantsBeer is false. This is ""short-circuiting."" But we can't short-circuit off of a ""yes"", because we just don't have that much information yet. And we can't individually answer ""yes"" anyway until the end, because again, we just don't have the information. So we ""don't know.""  The joke is basically just playing with words so that rather than interpreting the bartender's question as ""do you each want a beer"" (to which we could each reply with simply ""yes"" or ""no""), it's taken as a question posed to the group as a whole, which leads to this silly situation.  Here's the truth table for the AND relation.    AND False True    False False False   True False True    And here it is for the OR relation:    OR False True    False False True   True True True    The ""hotdog or hamburger"" thing is similar.  wants(4z01235, hotdog) OR wants(4z01235, hamburger)  is always going to come back as true if I want a hotdog, or if I want a hamburger, or if I want both. Again this is just playing with the phrasing of the question, because obviously this logical expression isn't what the question is meant to ask."

It's kind of the same idea, though; the container had no nucleation sites (places for crystals to base themselves), so nothing could come out of solution until the hand was put there. Supersaturation and supercooling are different in that supercooling usually deals with a solvent's freezing point being the limit surpassed. Supersaturation is where solubility of a solute is the limit surpassed."

chemicalreactiongifs,2ac6df,frenzyboard,2,Thu Jul 10 20:06:16 2014 UTC,"I've read this explanation before, but I still don't fully get it.  What is a nucleation site? I understand that's it's where the first molecule forms, but... What constitutes it? Why is it that just banging the container starts the reaction?"
chemicalreactiongifs,2ac6df,PawArmy,14,Thu Jul 10 20:52:09 2014 UTC,"When a solution is super saturated, think of it like the dance floor at a wedding reception. Everyone's at the party. Everybody's a little bit drunk. Everybody's got a partner they want to dance with. But the dance floor is empty, and the DJ is only playing classic rock. A nucleation point is when the DJ throws on the Funky Chicken, and the bride's dad steps out into the middle of the room and just goes nuts. Flapping his arms around, bobbing his head back and forth, and doin' the cha-cha like a winde-up monkey.   Everybody gets out on the floor and joins in the fun. A nucleation point is where two molecules finally decide to start the crystal structure. All it really takes is for them to hit each other hard enough to start the event. Once they start, the rest of the molecules realize it takes less energy to convert to that state than to stay in the one they're currently in. They just go with the flow.   Edit: I should add, this is why a lot of these super saturated solutions produce exothermic reactions. They're releasing energy in order to fall into a crystalline state. These sorts of solutions usually require something unnatural adding energy to them in order for them to remain super saturated. A nucleation point is usually something that steals a bit of that potential energy from some of those molecules and allows them to revert to a crystal state.  In this instance, the pores and hairs, and all the little cracks and contours of this guy's hand cause the molecules in the solution to conform to the shape of the hand. While yes, the hand going into the solution created energy, and yes, the heat of his hand gave away energy, the actual motion of conforming to that shape stole just enough energy to allow a nucleation point to form. This lower energy state created a catalyst for the other molecules near it, and allowed them to convert. But to convert, they had to dump a bit of their potential energy. This is why the solution gives off heat when it transforms."

chemicalreactiongifs,29rdpv,Moikle,6,Fri Jul 4 09:51:31 2014 UTC,"Out of curiosity, how did they know it was carbon dioxide?"
chemicalreactiongifs,29rdpv,contemplor,8,Fri Jul 4 04:38:53 2014 UTC,"Probably bubbled it through limewater. If it changes the colour to cloudy, then carbon dioxide is present. Just a guess though."
chemicalreactiongifs,29rdpv,texttosterone,2,Fri Jul 4 09:51:57 2014 UTC,"I don't really know many other ways to test other than checking for combustion, and considering it was done in 1796, I'd say they didn't have something like a mass spec."
chemicalreactiongifs,29rdpv,konohasaiyajin,2,Fri Jul 4 10:03:21 2014 UTC,How the heck did they make LOX in 1796?
chemicalreactiongifs,29rdpv,bananapeel,4,Fri Jul 4 10:43:27 2014 UTC,"Well, Wikipedia tells me:  The first measurable quantity of liquid oxygen was produced by Polish professors Zygmunt Wróblewski and Karol Olszewski (Jagiellonian University in Kraków) on April 5, 1883.  So, I guess they didn't.  Maybe they got a chamber filled with only oxygen gas and let the diamond stay hot in there for a proportionately longer time?  Then slide a tray of limewater into the chamber once the diamond has lost significant mass and see if any limestone forms on top I guess.  Edit:  This is a really good question.  The video doesn't explain how they originally performed the experiment, and wikipedia doesn't mention him doing it at all (and my google searches are fruitless, though I'm at the end of my work shit so I could just be sleepy)."

chemicalreactiongifs,29rdpv,texttosterone,5,Fri Jul 4 10:35:45 2014 UTC,"""In 1796 Yorkshire chemist <name> was investigating diamonds were made of, when he decided to burn one. Now he used sunlights and a magnifying lens to heat the diamond. But I'm going to speed things up and use a glass-blowing torch, and I have liquid oxygen. Now if I hold this, then, in the flame and heat it up... And there we have it. Wizzing around, it's beautiful. [insert music]. The bubbles coming off were collected by Smith's attendent. They aare pure carbon dioxide. Now he knew he started with just two ingredients. Diamond and oxygen. And what he produced was a gas made of just carbon and oxygen. So he knew that diamond had to be carbon. Now that's almost disappeared - it's gone. That diamond doesn't exist anymore. It's in the air that I'm breathing. It's turned into carbon dioxide. So, unfortunately, diamonds aren't forever.""   Now, let's look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_oxygen :   By 1845, Michael Faraday had managed to liquefy most gases then known to exist. Six gases, however, resisted every attempt at liquefaction[8] and were known at the time as ""permanent gases"". They were oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, and nitric oxide.   Apparently history is so volatile that 18th century history gets rewritten by BBC4 in the 21st century."

chemicalreactiongifs,29rdpv,konohasaiyajin,1 point,Fri Jul 4 10:10:12 2014 UTC,"I wonder if DeBeers sells ""academic grade"" diamonds for something like this. Or if that guy just burned a few thousand dollars..."
chemicalreactiongifs,29rdpv,CoreyDelaney,1 point,Fri Jul 4 15:43:18 2014 UTC,"No, that wouldn't have been worth a few thousand. Probably not super cheap though. Not only are there lab made diamonds, unprocessed diamonds, and diamond powder are used in a variety of products (saw blades and cooling paste as examples)  Diamond jewellery is cheap second hand. Not cheap like you can afford to buy a lot and pave your driveway with it, but nowhere as expensive when initially purchased, much like a car. It retains some value, but much of it is lost.  There's a grading scale for diamonds that considers color, clarity, and whether there are any imperfections (gas bubbles). Then there's the size, the shape, and the cut."
chemicalreactiongifs,29rdpv,CarpeKitty,4,Sat Jul 5 17:06:12 2014 UTC,"This...this is really amazing. Liquid Oxygen turns Diamond into gas. Is this reaction more to do with the Diamond being really hot, and the Liquid Oxygen being really cold? Non-Scientist checking in."
chemicalreactiongifs,29rdpv,cunninghamslaws,12,Thu Jul 3 20:58:22 2014 UTC,"By heating the diamond, you make the reaction more favorable.  The reaction being C+O=CO2.  You don't need liquid oxygen, you can do this in a pure oxygen environment too.  Having liquid oxygen means it's just all right there...  Interesting fact, liquid oxygen is blue...you can see it in the video too."

chemicalreactiongifs,29rdpv,rockinghard,1 point,Fri Jul 4 10:39:39 2014 UTC,"It has two unpaired electrons in it's outer shell.  These electrons will absorb red light, or red photons if you will.  Blue photons are left to be reflected, so we see blue. I'm, however, not the best person to ask why it doesn't absorb blue photons and why it does absorb red ones.  The best answer I could give for that is, it's all related to the energy state of the unpaired electrons..."
chemicalreactiongifs,29rdpv,littlesweatervest,8,Fri Jul 4 15:21:07 2014 UTC,The diamonds are burning. The combination of the super hot diamond and the liquid oxygen begins a runaway oxidation process (burning) until the diamond is gone. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion
chemicalreactiongifs,29rdpv,PhantomCheezit,3,Thu Jul 3 22:01:40 2014 UTC,"Combustion:       Combustion /kəmˈbʌs.tʃən/ or burning  is the sequence of exothermic chemical reactions between a fuel and an oxidant accompanied by the production of heat and conversion of chemical species. The release of heat can produce light in the form of either glowing or a flame.  In a complete combustion reaction, a compound reacts with an oxidizing element, such as oxygen or fluorine, and the products are compounds of each element in the fuel with the oxidizing element. The process releases heat energy.

chemicalreactiongifs,29rdpv,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Jul 3 22:02:14 2014 UTC,"I'm taking a total guess here without any source to back me up. So fire needs oxygen to continue burning, but the amount of oxygen we have in the air around us isn't enough to keep a diamond burning. Liquid oxygen on the otherhand is pure and will give the diamond enough sources to keep burning until it's gone."
