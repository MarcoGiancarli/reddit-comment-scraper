TheRealmOfMianite,3e3cwa,AerisaFoxFeather,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:42:19 2015 UTC,Oh ok cool thanks. I thought it would be better if the guys started before school starts up again so it would bring a lot of viewers to the start of Season 3. So it might start late August at the earliest then.

TheRealmOfMianite,3e3x4c,Flamenaz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:38:08 2015 UTC,Martha probably won't exist outside of S2 most likely since most seasons begin fresh with only the heroes and the gods as a main stay.

TheRealmOfMianite,3e3yh4,jakebee101,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:48:12 2015 UTC,"Well first the crew is sent back to the realm of mianite where mianite is good and dianite is bad where they meet a new friend zianite. They have travelled into the future and everything is different. First I don't Think mianite and dianite should team up to stop him. I think that zianite should be a demigod sent to the realm of mianite to keep it flourished. Zianite should be peaceful like a human when he arrives, but after about 30 episodes he should be confronted by mianite and dianite separately on the same day. Mianite comes to him talking about how he sees potential in zianite and knows that he can bring peace and balance to this world like ianite. Later that day, while zianite is thinking of what mianite said about the potentially stuff, dianite confronts him and tells him the same thing except instead of bringing peace he can bring destruction to the world and then leaves him to think. After all of this he confronts Sonja to ask her about the matter. Tucker hears their conversation learning everything. Now that tucker knows this he assumes Tom doesn't know about it and keeps it a secret (meanwhile sparkles and ianite are on a date or something like that). Sonja being in favor of this demigod, if you know what I mean, desires to help him. Previously being in favor of mianite, Sonja tells zianite to go with mianites offer. When zianite does this though dianite becomes enraged and furious and brings destruction upon the world with the help of Tom. When dianite enters the realm of mianite or ruxomar zianite realizes the mistake he has made and realizes that ianite didn't confront him and assumes that she hateful toward him and attacks her. Ianite gives sparkles one last kiss(😘) and dies in his arms. Sparkles in tears is outraged at zianite for killing his lady. Zianite now seeing what he has done is banished away to the void leaving sparkles in tears, tucker eating in tacobell, Tom helping dianite, ianita motherless,and Sonja heartbroken. Then everyone is sent back to the temple of Ianite in aetheria where they must go back to find zianite and stop him from killing ianite."
TheRealmOfMianite,3e3yh4,MauryPovich22,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:54:05 2015 UTC,Ok I like this idea but we aren't relishing one thing that ianite and mianite still dislike dianite and probably not imeadiatly like each other but instead hate him now being rejected from both his sister and brother who cared for him in the other world (ruximar) now hate him and he doesn't understand why that has to be part of it

As for the development we are still a little way off however it is speeding up, especially with more people joining the team.

TheRealmOfMianite,3dvx6d,mayley,4,Mon Jul 20 01:48:24 2015 UTC,"Since this project only really started a bit ago, it will take many months until it is completed.

TheRealmOfMianite,3dvx6d,bishop425,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:38:33 2015 UTC,The server will be free to play but it will also have ranks that you can purchase if you want.
TheRealmOfMianite,3dvog8,joppetie,13,Sun Jul 19 22:33:17 2015 UTC,"It depends what you want when it comes to content:  If you choose Jordan your experience will be tame but most story stuff is revolved around him, If you choose Tucker you will get salt but a lot of trolling, If you choose Sonja you will get less story but more interaction with her chat and Tucker. Finally Tom with him you'll end up with shenanigans and it's generally fun but he can be very controversial in the way that he walks a thin line between being a knob and having banter. If you want to catch up as quick as possible you can watch Tucker's weekly highlights or read the recaps on this sub but I suggest watching the series as it evolves and plays out."
TheRealmOfMianite,3dvog8,Flamenaz,2,Sun Jul 19 23:03:27 2015 UTC,"So you choose a person to follow and then accept that you'll miss some content from the other streams?  And you said ""I suggest watching the series as it evolves and plays out."". Does that mean start at season 3? Don't you think I will have missed too much?"
TheRealmOfMianite,3dvog8,Flamenaz,2,Sun Jul 19 23:44:59 2015 UTC,Some days not everyone streams so sometimes its good to check the other streams but it is easier to follow by watching from one perspective. They are mostly on team speak and you can easily find out what some one else is doing so if it interests you can switch over and then return because they communicate often with each other.
TheRealmOfMianite,3dvog8,Rosemadary,3,Mon Jul 20 00:03:36 2015 UTC,I'm slightly curious about where you discovered Mianite from. Would you mind sharing? Did you just stumble upon it?
TheRealmOfMianite,3dvog8,Bananagram31,2,Sun Jul 19 22:51:08 2015 UTC,"I've followed Syndicate and the Captain for a long time. (early BO for Tom)  I sometimes heard references to Mianite in videos and I once tuned into a Mianite livestream by Tom, but I didn't know what the hell was going on.  This afternoon I saw Jordans latest video, which made me remember Mianite and I really started to wonder what it was."
TheRealmOfMianite,3dvog8,31HPG,4,Sun Jul 19 23:42:21 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend Jordan if you want more on the actual storyline. He's definitely the most involved, at least in Season 2."
TheRealmOfMianite,3dvog8,emezman,4,Mon Jul 20 04:10:00 2015 UTC,"You can watch Mianite on Twitch or Youtube. Twitch means having to tune in daily (time unsure), and Youtube means you'll watch everything one day late unless you watch Jordan's, whose uncut VODs come out a couple of hours after the stream. If you're planning on watching all perspectives, I'd say you'd use up at least 10 hours a day (5 main streamers x 2 hour streams daily). Since that takes too long, I recommend you watch Jordan's today's-stream-in-30-minutes videos, and watch the rest only if story revolves around them. Supposing you do try to catch up, remember this: For S1, watch either Tucker or Tom's videos all the way up to Jordan's arrival (lots of important storyline there), then stick to Jordan's 30 min videos from then on. If the story revolves around another person, you should then switch over temporarily to that streamer. Once that particular arc is done, switch back to Jordan's videos. I think what you mean is ""not watch S1 and get the full experience"", which the answer to that is yes, but you'll miss out a lot of really good things and might not get references in S2. For ""still watch S1 and get the full experience"", yes, but try to stick to the days where story/big things happen so you have enough time to catch up on S2 before S3 starts. S1 is optional but recommended, but you should be more focused on S2. Assuming S3's story is by the same team from S2 (BlockWorks), S3 will probably feature some NPCs from S2.    Also: If you really can't watch all the important videos, try skimming through the recaps here on Reddit. Note that there is a lack of recaps somewhere in the middle of S2, though.  Happy watching and hope you enjoy it!"
TheRealmOfMianite,3dvog8,LadyTimeLord11,3,Mon Jul 20 06:32:48 2015 UTC,"You should start from season 1 first, and watch Tom or jericho's perspective because they started the series and others joined couple of episodes later."
TheRealmOfMianite,3dvog8,IamTigarLili,3,Mon Jul 20 19:55:47 2015 UTC,"I should mention before all of this, i have always watched from Jordan (CaptainSparklez) view point, so everything i say will be about his videos.  For season 1 he kept his episodes pretty short, with the occasional long one. It wasn't until season 2 that they started to get longer and longer, only because there was so much more important stuff i guess.  Yes you can still watch season 1 and get the full experience, i found mianite when Jordan was on season 2 about episode 30. But i prefer to watch his videos on youtube only because i like to ability to pause.  And about the skipping right to season 3, i would highly not recommend. Not only because of understanding the pre-story, they also have a lot, i re-peat, a lot of past jokes they talk about all the time, that you won't understand and will be sad about. Honestly you could probably get away with starting on season 3, and if that's really something you want, then i atleast recommend to definitely watch a few hand picked episodes. if this is something you would like, i can tell you a handful of episodes (from CaptainSparklez) i think are really important to watch for story stuff.  Now i will link all the people you can watch.   Jordan (CaptainSparklez) Both Seasons in 1 playlist: https://goo.gl/SJ2bfB  Tom (TheSyndicateProject) Season 1 https://goo.gl/ql3NiR Season 2 https://goo.gl/5QmHGD  Tucker (iijerichoii / JerichoAFK) Season 1 https://goo.gl/PY3gqR Season 2 https://goo.gl/xJqwPO  Sonja (OMGit'sfirefox) Season 1 https://goo.gl/xskP5p Season 2 https://goo.gl/m5KnnM  and as a side note, any of their twitch accounts are linked off their youtube channels.  There are a handful of other people who do stream and record some episodes, but those of the four main heroes who are around almost all the time. Best of luck and i hope you join the Mianite family!!"
TheRealmOfMianite,3dvog8,Pika__Crew,3,Tue Jul 21 05:10:54 2015 UTC,"I joined in the middle of season 1, and had to do hours and hours of recaping, so I wouldn't suggest doing that (as in watching it all from the start) if you don't care that much about back story and don't mind missing some well-known moments. BUT, if you are like me, who wants to know ALL of the back-story all of the little moments and history of mianite then definitely WATCH IT all! You will probably still be finishing 2 when they start 3, but you will eventually catch-up. Don't skip ahead to the latest video if you want the whole Mianite experience. And if you watch both the captain and tom then I would go with the captain just because tom's videos tend to really long and that way you get more of the knowledge about season 2 because tom was out for a lot of that. Anyways that's just my two-cents, that kinda got too winded but yeah! :)"
TheRealmOfMianite,3dvog8,CollegeBaby20,3,Tue Jul 21 17:43:12 2015 UTC,"Well who you watch depends on the kind of content although for season one, Jordan's videos are just highlights while Tucker and Tom were the first and have their full streams posted so either way I say the time is worth it. If you watch the first season the only thing you don't get to experience is the interaction. And each season has a new storyline with references to the other seasons so starting fresh at season 3 should be fine. (I've watched all of Jordans POV, Toms S1 POV and im currently watching Tuckers POV)"
TheRealmOfMianite,3dvog8,TeamDianite1,5,Tue Jul 21 20:10:25 2015 UTC,"Well, they are not streaming right now. But when they do, I watch when I can. Otherwise i watch Jordan's edited YouTube videos. Season 1 to me isn't better or worse than season 2. They are good for different reasons. It's like comparing apples to oranges. I suggest watching both and deciding for yourself. :)"
TheRealmOfMianite,3dvog8,Ninja_Yui,2,Sun Jul 19 22:38:02 2015 UTC,Apples and oranges are both fruit! (but thanks anyway :))
TheRealmOfMianite,3dvog8,jakebee101,0,Sun Jul 19 23:45:22 2015 UTC,wow. just wow.
TheRealmOfMianite,3dvog8,HolyWhales,3,Mon Jul 20 05:39:31 2015 UTC,"You can watch Mianite from either Twitch (Past Broadcasts) or Youtube. Jordan doesn't use the Twitch PB anymore as his streams are now directed to his second channel. You can find their channels and streams linked on the side of this reddit page. (Since each youtuber spends a variety of time on Mianite, depending on who you choose to watch, will take many many weeks/months to finish both season 1 and 2.) If you wish for slightly shorter episodes of Mianite, I suggest going to Jordan's cuts of each episode. Much shorter and easier to catch up that way. You can indeed. I joined Mianite midway through Season 1 and while I caught up, I still felt I got the full experience of it. Since a few of the cast (Jordan, Sonja, etc) came a few days after Mianite 'officially' started, I suggest watching Tucker or Tom's first few episodes if you are going to watch someone else. If you can't watch them, you can indeed start with season 3. As many people have done so with Season 2, if you cannot watch the previous season(s) then just search for the recaps for both seasons here on the Mianite Reddit and read it before starting. There might be a few jokes/references that you won't get but it won't be too difficult that it'll offset the entire season for you."
TheRealmOfMianite,3dvog8,Epicmanmc,3,Mon Jul 20 00:06:49 2015 UTC,"If you wanna catch up, Jordan is your best bet. He cuts all the streams (Except important ones) down to about half hour sections, at least he did for S1 and S2. Watching S1 will make everything more in perspective and watching both would help S3 (If there is one) make even more sense."
TheRealmOfMianite,3dvog8,kriss554,3,Mon Jul 20 00:52:50 2015 UTC,"Go to CaptainSparklez's channel and look up Mianite. He has a playlist with all of the episodes there. Some days he wasn't on but he recaps what happened the day he missed. It will take up a lot of time to catch up but it is worth every second. Mianite is like tv show that you can totally get engaged in and even engage with. This is the perfect time to get caught up since they are in between seasons.  I did the same thing. I ignored season one, but then when they were promoting season two i watched an animation of it and im like ""Oh! This series looks kinda cool!"" I went back and started on season one and couldnt rest until i had finished. I regret nothing."
TheRealmOfMianite,3dvog8,mwthecool,2,Mon Jul 20 03:38:07 2015 UTC,"Watch whoever you want, depends on your style or if they follow your favorite God.Watch both seasons, you may be lost without them. And most likely watch on youtube, if you watch Jordan, you'll have to, as he deleted all vods."
TheRealmOfMianite,3dvog8,TrickAzze,3,Mon Jul 20 06:48:26 2015 UTC,As a fan of Mianite I watched both season 1 and 2 and I would recommend watching both seasons. I myself personally watched between Jordan's POV and Tucker's POV but I would recommend watching Jordan's shortened Youtube versions for both seasons then watch the livestreams on Twitch for season 3 when you can. I recommend season 1 to just get a hang of how Tom envisioned the series before it got big and when it was just everyone messing around and getting a feel for everything going on. Season 2 was more story based and I loved that as Jordan's POV showed more of the story line.

TheRealmOfMianite,3dqdve,Aniline_Selenic,2,Sat Jul 18 12:55:59 2015 UTC,"I would design it with a wizard's help to make it unbreakable... I would locate it in it's own building. My entry code would involve two levels of security. First being Jordan's item lock. the second being a hopper that accepts an item, specifically my personal weapon, and it hoppers it into the below to be picked up once inside.  I would store plot related items, and powerful weapons. I wouldn't keep everything hidden, as that would make a heist potentially breaking for me. My vault would just be build to look nice. I mean, if I am going to use it, no sense in it being ugly. I wouldn't hide it."
TheRealmOfMianite,3dqdve,ThePretender3,2,Sat Jul 18 15:36:44 2015 UTC,"This all depends, If it were vanilla and there wasn't any block breaking allowed to access the vault.   1 A 1 chunk square (interior being around an 9x9x17 leaving room to expand vertically either down or up depending on where I start. ) with the rest being left for redstone with a final Outer layer to hide said wiring. The outer-layer could be something simple like bricks, or Stone bricks.. Essentially to make the boundary of where block breaking is not allowed 2 I'd do it near my main base, if not using that as the ""basement"" 3 I'd probably do something akin to the item input lock, with a 6 lever/pressure plate combo lock after that, then a final button to open the doors 4 If block breaking were not allowed I'd keep the expensive items down there, as well as a measurable supply of normal items. But not everything 5 Depends on how I am feeling and how complicated and easy to break the wiring becomes.  6 I wouldn't bother to hide the vault if no block breaking were allowed.    If in modded, and no block breaking were allowed  Pretty much same as vanilla, but definitely stylized, probably do all the wiring with projectred/expanded redstone/wireless redstone and some sort of player sensor attuned to my character id."

TheRealmOfMianite,3dq38z,whats_stomata,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:05:50 2015 UTC,"Jordan is also bound to the rule. And, well, there were rules before.... in Season 1.  The actual problem is if Jordan pranks back, others will do a much worse prank.  I actually wanted to see trolls, but I don't want pranks that reset the entire progress of a streamer or burn or destroy their home. The Modesteps never faced punishment for burning his house and that was a rule to not destroy homes.  When I said that it was made for Jordan's sake, I say it because of his house getting demolished too much, not as a special treatment. Jordan has to follow the rule, too."
TheRealmOfMianite,3dq38z,whats_stomata,2,Sat Jul 18 23:32:58 2015 UTC,"The Modesteps weren't tried because at the time there was no trial system, when it was introduced they were making an album and were inactive.

TheRealmOfMianite,3dq38z,GeneralJacob,2,Sat Jul 18 14:17:46 2015 UTC,"You do realize that this means that they are allowed to grief and troll but should not take it too far (e.g in Jordan's case, burning down the house or deforming that takes too long to recover like when the others acted immature and made it into a private part (I'm not gonna type that)), right?  Don't take it as a offence, they are allowed to prank but need to make sure that it could be easy be reversible and recoverable.  Besides, do you see any streamer gets his house destroyed too MANY times beside Jordan? That's why I said he should be Constable for Jordan's sake.  Also, Jordan is not excluded, since he is bound to that rule, too. Trial is voided if:  1) the victim takes revenge on the Troll.  2) pays a debt to the victim if he/she accepts it.  3) the troll helps to clean up the prank, if it is irreversible or takes too long to recover."
TheRealmOfMianite,3dq38z,captinepicfail1,-1,Sat Jul 18 15:02:38 2015 UTC,"The problem is that most of the time either Jordan gets himself into these situations by being a copycat or by being repetitive with the same thing to several people. Or maybe it's just him not participating in the prank wars that are going on (season 1). And I don't remembered anyone having to completely reset except in diamonds, gold, or special items. When he finally got raided from his vaults in season 1 it caused him to loose a lot better cause he had never given up much before and they knew he would be even more protective moving forward."

Rewards for the winner would be something story related maybe since it's an unusual event. Both chance for caving and skill for fighting. I WOULD BE BEST. But besides me idk. Jordan's done it twice but plays safe, like, whenever he takes 2 hearts of damage to anyone he runs away yelling ow, and in UHC you need to keep fighting unless you have a lot of regen. Tom is a lot more all out but that can get him killed. Maybe he'll have a better fighting strategy/mentality.

You know what it looks like? I hope you know about Telltale Games like The Wolf Among Us and The Walking Dead. If you do, then Season 2 looks like the Alpha/Beta Version of the games or a testing version for the first Telltale Games. The not-so-good story-line or lengthy conversation and the fact they made Jordan as the main character who has to make decisions like whether or not sign a contract.  That pretty much looks like a test version of Telltales Games."

I wouldn't because I'd rather use my gold blocks on making giant pimp dicks going inside peoples hosues  I'd steal depending on who I know had what, like how Jordan's vault became a target because he got so many good things and in the end for a bit Tom's was the center since he had good things  I'd sweep in and clean up or use my MLG PVP skills  Not sure since they don't normally do PVP games and Jordan's Hunger Games on Mineplex usually aren't too intense, like, I win a shit ton there because it's not challenging with a lot of the people there and Tucker might only be good at Sky Wars sorta stuff and Tom is confusing with tactic and skill being bipolar and ye.

We know that the gods can remain as spirits for a long time, as Ianite was one in season 1, and dianite was one in season 2. While Jordan would be busy, the others would be working with the Brothers to help bring them back. The story would be less focused on Ianite, and more so on each streamers personal god. Tucker and Sonja would see less of Ianite, except for key moments, and instead be feeling more of mianite. Same with tom."

TheRealmOfMianite,3dha4p,YumeBaah,2,Thu Jul 16 21:02:57 2015 UTC,"They would work together, with tucker, tom, sonja, and wag focusing mainly on figuring out how to revive their main gods. Jordan would fall more into the background of the others, with wag taking his place while Jordan tried to solve Ianites problem. This way the fans get a good balance of what they want.  Many people wanted Jordan to break away from the others and go rouge, so this could be a base line for him. For those that want the main interaction, you have tucker and the others, with them focusing on working together and more player driven story. Jordan's POV would be much more similar to S2 story, but with better balance."
TheRealmOfMianite,3dha4p,MrTwo-Face,2,Thu Jul 16 21:10:29 2015 UTC,"Okay, then we'd have four people working together while Jordan did his own thing, similar to what Tom did in S1. Even if you say some people want that to happen I'm not really a fan of the idea. And from Jordan's pov the season would be Ianite heavy again anyway."
TheRealmOfMianite,3dha4p,Dawnleafxoxo,5,Thu Jul 16 22:11:16 2015 UTC,"Cool story, but I am so done with Ianite storyline, sorry everyone, but this isn't just Jordan's series."

We all know that you want things to be like the way they were in Season 1, but this type of comment is totally unacceptable. When someone posts something and you disagree, you shouldn't make them feel bad about this idea. You should politely explain that you disagree with them. This is a great website. It only turns bad when people lose the ability to respect each others opinions. In other words, stop acting like a jerk and be polite."

Maybe it could be that the heroes are trying to stop  the Shadows, but Ianite's obsession with a balanced regieme is constantly getting in the way. She could be sort of a secondary villian."

He seems to be more fun to follow and has style with everything he does.  I would steal, grief, and kill his foes in his name.,  I would do what he asks without considering the well being of mianite.  I would pray for armor which gives me invisibility, a sword with poison x 20, and a bow which encases the victim in obsidian.  I would expect to receive the tasks of stealing the enemies' most powerful weapons even if I have to get it off of them.  Other gods would fear me and know that I am a danger to their followers.  I would praise dianite by burning or exploding the shrines of other gods and turning them into what they should be, ash and dust."

So basically S1 Tom xd

I'm a chill girl, and I honestly just enjoy helping people and being a good friend( I'm the most out of place Slytherin you'll ever meet), so I'd probably follow Mianite, and just spend my time helping and doing nice things for others, sort of how Champwan was always building things for the community. I feel like I'd just be asked to help others out, and the other gods would respect me for that, because... I don't know, because I help everyone. Gosh, I sound like a total bore."

TheRealmOfMianite,3ddcgx,EagleEyeG,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:47:20 2015 UTC,"I would follow Ianite because I believe in balance. Being neutral or wanting balance does not mean being good or bad, it means doing what's right. You can have fun and pull pranks (Dianite) and you can also be serious and focus on justice (Mianite) and keep balance. It all depends on the situation. As a follower of Ianite I would stop fights between followers of Mianite and Dianite. I would help to keep peace and happiness. I would gain favors by being a good follower and respectful to Ianite. I would complete tasks that she gives me and be a good representative of her beliefs. I would most likely pray for help doing certain things, crafting and stuff like that. I would also pray for advice when needed and help restoring balance when there are quarrels amongst Mianitees. Tasks I could see Ianite giving me would be things like helping others, being kind, and stay true to my beliefs. I would do my best to be respected by both Mianite and Dianite. Like I said before, working for balance does not necessarily mean helping the ""good"" god or the ""bad"" god, it means working with whoever wants to restore balance and peace as well. I would help them with tasks if they are for the good of the kingdom and agree with Ianite's beliefs. I would of course always ask Ianite's opinion and permission to do tasks for other gods. To give praise to Ianite, I would build shrines in her honor and wear her colors. I would also decorate my home with her colors and thank her for everything that she does for everyone."

What would you do as a follower of that God?   Prank and kill and stuff.   How would you gain favors from that God?   I wouldn't try.   What would you pray for?   I wouldn't.   What type of tasks would you expect to receive from that God and would you do them?   Destory and attack and stuff, and yes.   How would the other Gods treat you as a non-follower?   Mianite hates me, Ianite dosn't care.   How would you give praise to your God?   kill."

While leaving your reader to question things is a great technique to have a fascinating story, if you don't do it right, it just doesn't taste right.

The majority of apps have been responded to. To the person that said the app has been in for a month , they haven't been open for a month so I'm not sure where you sent it . As for the reply times 1-2 weeks is normally a good response time , as we all have to sit down and look through the accepted apps , for people have been denied its normally 3-5 days depending on the quality of the application ( better ones take longer to decide on )"
TheRealmOfMianite,3d9vje,RedSkinnedDevil,3,Tue Jul 14 19:39:18 2015 UTC,"So basically, the longer you wait, the better the sign that you application may have got through XD a rather confusing process by most normal standards.

Simply because it can have some cool mountains and you NEVER have to worry about rain or snow. That being said I'd plop down in the first area that wasn't already housing a base. I just prefer mountains simply because digging a base out of the ground and surrounding it with a castle wall is kinda what I like doing rather than free standing bases. I'd make a wall around whatever I built regardless...   My initial house would be simple. I tend to do 4x9x3 houses with most/all of the walls made out of chests initially. Then I make something grandiose/overly large and work on themeing from then on. But this is only after I have a fair amount of resources.  Initially whatever chest is open will receive items, after I get annoyed with this I'll sort chests manually, then dump everything into an ME system, Wall of barrels, or RFTools storage system depending on what is available. If I had an AE system there would be two parts to it. A primary network, and a Sub Network. The Primary network would hold all my ""common things"" and would export expensive things to the subnet work via export bus/import bus and a chest. The primary network would hold mundane things like ingots, while the secondary network would have a security terminal and hold special items/expensive items.   Granted this is only if we share, if we don't then everything would be on a single network with a security terminal.    Again depends on the mods available and the rules given in the world. But If open modular turrets is available I would make some of those for the outside of my base and feed them cobble to deal with mobs until I get a magnum torch. As for player protection... You can't really automate much in the way of protection due to how strong a player can get.  Vault system see post in vault page. But TLDR make it fancy, make it redstone, store valuable stuff there.  I'd only commission the wizards if I didn't play as much as I wanted. IE only 2 hours a day when streaming. Id probably play a TON more on non official hours just building. Since in my current world I spent about 3 or 4 days (aka 72/96 hours) building just to make my base look fancier than normal.  I tend to make castles built around a theme, but I'd be down for pretty much anything just give me a theme and I'll roll with it as long as I like it."

Imma call them the Titans until we get a better name.  So there is the male Titan, Tykke   Color is gold/yellowish  Power is control over time Chilled back, no need to worry about time   And the female Titan, Sykke   Color is Iron/Grayish power is control over space Need freak, wants everything in a certain order   Now, they were once one in the same, but split to seem less menacing, but merge to annihilate their enemies that disturbs the peace in the universe"
TheRealmOfMianite,3d7c0s,Datgodapple,2,Tue Jul 14 02:31:05 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting idea. My thoughts for a goddess:  Miadnite. Colour would be Black(both as her way of standing apart, and to go with ianite's purple.) Her appearance itself would be that of a female demon, but her behavior would counteract that of dianite. However because of her looks, she would be distrusted by mianite, and her way of finding comfort would be with Ianite, in which she could equalize Ianite's actions. For every balancing act Ianite does, Miadnite would unbalance it, in the favor of which ever champion she has corrupted at that moment.   Think of her as the exiled goddess, she balances, but only by unbalancing the others. She takes their champions, only one at a time, and uses that champion as she wishes. She is the goddess who gifts the god harming items, the items that slow down the others, but she can be misdirected if Ianite tries.  Some feedback on this would be nice."

Vianite lives in the air around everyone, and can drift in and out of people's minds. Her temple would be up in the sky so far you could see space, and you would have to go through a procedure in order to even see it. Her color is orange. Vianite physically shorter than the others and wears an orange one-shoulder dress. Her hair is an orange-yellow color and with side bangs and then with an end halfway down her neck that flairs out and looks very jagged (think in Tangled Rapunzel's short hair but a bit longer and with side bangs). Vianite is always shown in art with a crystal ball to represent her omniscient view.  Vianite jumps her way around on the balance scale. Sometimes she is good, sometimes evil, sometimes just in the middle. Vianite is never on only one side. She might even work for both sides secretly, depending on the situation. She can know all point of views so she makes a decision after looking at that.  Vianite's champions, since she is the goddess of the mind, are Wisdom and Intuition.   Her lore items are orange glasses that give you a bird's eye view of the area you are in (very helpful to find players when you are in a battle or think you are being followed) called Vianite's View, and a gem that allows you to enter the forts of your own mind for a short amount of time called the Insider."

Now I know it might be farfetched but I like it. Unlike God/Goddesses or demi Gods/Goddesses it would be a nice twist if let's say for example my nephalem would be called Rene(wow what a surprise it's me). He has full control of light and darkness also a bit of control over the void. Temple is in the void (if possible). The colours what represent him are black and white (like ying and yang). He wavers between his two faced personality leading him to wrong decision sometimes but is always ready to kill. Sadistic to the soul he gets into a lot of fights and loves to tease so Rene and Syndy would get along. Cryptic items would be three divine blades and one bow named the Renegade, the Supremacy, Lost souls and the death bolt (reference to what Dianite thought was a joke)which all deal considerable amounts of damage with lost souls being the strongest but have a risk...

It goes real well with the whole alternate dimension storyline. In the world of Mianite, the Gods are distant, mysterious figures, who rarely interact with their champions and followers. In Season 2, it's the opposite: the gods are more outgoing, and they spend a lot more time with their followers. It's actually a very good representation of how Ruxomar and Mianite are basically opposite dimensions."

Teleportation & Item gifting/recovery.    In S1, a god joining the server was a big deal! ""Dianite has joined the Realm of Mianite!"" was all it took to turn the stream into full-blown hype mode. Why? Because we didn't see a god every single episode. They were mysterious figures we rarely saw, and when they did appear they often left their followers with some sort of mission which held the streamers over for often over a week.   The rampant /give and /tp also really left the fourth wall in ruins. This, coupled with the overwhelming sense of material security, is what ultimately ruined the season for me. In S1, I was often on the edge of my seat, anxious to see if my streamer would die and lose all their gear they had worked to hard to get.

Then, there would be 5 different races, each with a different theme, like nether, end, jungle, mountain, stuff like that. The courses would be full of dead ends and shortcuts, as well as obstacles. All five streamers would race five times, and you would be awarded points for your place, with 5th place getting one point, 4th place getting two points, 3rd place getting three points, 2nd place getting four points, and first place getting five points.

They'd be allowed to kill each other to steal the items, and for that they'd be provided equal sets of armor and weapons (I was thinking of something on diamond level, or below, but with mods I'm not too sure), but killing/being killed wouldn't give nor take any points on itself.

Tucker = Blood Magic, Sonja = Thaumcraft, Waglington = Ars Magica, Tom = Tinker's Construct and Jordan = Witchery. There will be puzzles like mazes and riddles.

There's also the issue of that they would have to use 1.8 for season 3 then :\ (highly unlikely they would be modded in that case)

TheRealmOfMianite,3cwifp,Reneqade,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:55:10 2015 UTC,"Currently I am on mobile with shoddy internet but sure, we can discuss further. Where do you think it goes."
TheRealmOfMianite,3cwifp,Reneqade,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:02:51 2015 UTC,"Dont worry I have bad internet too but seeing as you thought like me I was thinking about having a nephalem character which is angel+demon child having the name of Rene. So my thought was that since he was born he was never accepted on either side because of him being a half blood only ianite, Martha and his mother accept him but didn't want to cause them trouble so he resides in the void and learns how to control the void as well as his control over light and darkness seeing as he owns both sides. Seeing as hes a God in his own right he becomes the death s1 Dianite was pretending to be and becomes a problem for the Gods to control so decide to seal him. Now the problem with this character is that I dont know who his parents will be I had a thought that instead of furia being a guardian in one world she can be an archangel in another leading to have relations with Dianite but I have nothing after that so you could probably help me improve him seeing as the nephalem idea from me was great and your archangel thinking was amazing."
TheRealmOfMianite,3ct9wa,Strikester101,3,Fri Jul 10 16:24:39 2015 UTC,"Season 1 purges were exciting because they were somewhat necessary. They had just finished the War, and to keep peace in the land, they invented the purge.   In S2 it was too forced imo, as there was no real need for it. The players had no real interest in killing each other outside of the purge in the first place - which perhaps is it's own issue (compared to S1 anyway).   I don't think that in S3 they should do purges for the sake of it just because some of the fans like it. If there is no real purpose in it, then its pointless."
TheRealmOfMianite,3ct9wa,Magnavis_,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:33:31 2015 UTC,"Purges in S2 were a ""practice"" of Dagrun. Now this was most likely just a gimmick to bring purges back, but that's the reason behind them in S2."
TheRealmOfMianite,3ct9wa,cpPenguin1289,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:53:09 2015 UTC,"Not a practice of Dagrun, a practice other Priests such as Dec have done in other lands. As in, referring to S1's. This time they did it just because it's a thing they do, when in S1 they did it because it was a way to resolve things."
TheRealmOfMianite,3ct9wa,miaday,3,Sat Jul 11 01:26:09 2015 UTC,"Another thing I noticed, it is about Jordan.  Jordan in Season 1 Purges was doing excellently. Jordan in Season 2 Purges however was not. I realized that there is possibly a reason for this.  Jordan is not fit for the new Season 2 ""kill as points"" rule. He could gain points for killing people easily, but the fact that death reduces points made it tough for him. What supports this fact is that others constantly kill him to steal the points. While kill-stealing is not against the rules, this seems too unfair, especially since Tucker's kills in the second revamped Purge were mostly kill-steals from Jordan and when Tom and Tucker teamed together and Tucker let him kill him to gain points."
TheRealmOfMianite,3ct9wa,Hidoni,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:35:28 2015 UTC,"If season 3's purge was like a survival games with the winner of each game getting a point, it would be nice, everyone could pick a kit like a bow and arrow kit, an armor kit, a sword kit etc."
TheRealmOfMianite,3ct9wa,cpPenguin1289,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:26:14 2015 UTC,Sounds good.
TheRealmOfMianite,3ct9wa,Dsmario64,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:37:12 2015 UTC,"I recently just rewatched a S1 purge and I liked it so much better. The fact that there was strategy into getting in vaults and trapping nether portals made it so much more enjoyable for me. In this season they tried to keep it balanced, and for the most part did, but since everyone excelled in different mods, people had better levels and such than others. I would like to see S3 have vanilla-only purges (if S3 even has mods, I don't know) and them bring their vaults back. Mianite is about the streamers having fun, the story, and the viewers enjoying it. I think the streamers had more fun in S1 with purges and the viewers enjoyed it more. So if they bring back vaults and such to S3 without a storyline attached to them, I would be fine."
TheRealmOfMianite,3ct4n1,Cannedme,3,Fri Jul 10 15:44:34 2015 UTC,If you click apply they will tell you that the applications have closed. So far we have had over 500 applications in the last 2 days and ~80% of them have been for writers. At the moment we are going to sort through the short list we have made and we may open them up again depending on the number of positions we fill
TheRealmOfMianite,3ct4n1,mayley,6,Fri Jul 10 15:45:41 2015 UTC,"So far we have had over 500 applications   I feel sorry for the people who have to read through all of them. You could probably eliminate a few hundred by running a script that will check for spelling errors, if there are spelling errors present, bin the application."
TheRealmOfMianite,3ct4n1,Terwookie,3,Fri Jul 10 15:48:16 2015 UTC,"That's not the way to do it, even book authors have to send their book to someone for review to check for spelling mistakes and things that wouldn't fit the target audience."
TheRealmOfMianite,3ct4n1,Hidoni,3,Fri Jul 10 15:51:38 2015 UTC,You can't apply for a writers position and have your application littered with spelling errors.  Writers who send in their final version spell check everything before it ever gets sent to the publisher.
TheRealmOfMianite,3ct4n1,Terwookie,2,Fri Jul 10 15:53:13 2015 UTC,Well your suggestion clearly didn't say how many spelling errors there needed to be to bin the application.
TheRealmOfMianite,3ct4n1,Hidoni,3,Fri Jul 10 15:55:48 2015 UTC,"There should be none.   Spelling errors = Sloppy, unprofessional  I'm sure the site and the server does not want people writing the series who are sloppy and unprofessional. It will just be Multicube all over again"

TheRealmOfMianite,3ct4n1,Emfia,3,Fri Jul 10 18:11:05 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't really view those as errors, per se. But little differences like that could easily be exceptions if a script was to be created."
TheRealmOfMianite,3ct4n1,Terwookie,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:36:10 2015 UTC,"Think about names, then, that could also be perceived out-of-context by a code as a spelling error. Simply put, you can't have a machine doing this sort of job."
TheRealmOfMianite,3ct4n1,Dondagora,3,Fri Jul 10 21:54:04 2015 UTC,"I suspect you've never ran a script in your life? It's entirely possible to filter out names and spelling differences by countries.   Also, the script wouldn't be making the final decision. It would just eliminate the low effort applications and leave the serious ones to be read by humams"
TheRealmOfMianite,3ct4n1,Terwookie,3,Fri Jul 10 23:02:26 2015 UTC,"Just using Word to write up your application will clear up most of your spelling and grammar mistakes.  After that, a few proofreads would help out a lot, and even having a friend or family member read over it before sending it in.  If you send in your application that's your first draft and didn't take the time to proof read it a bit, then it tends to show that you're not putting in the time and effort to put out a good application. Why take the time and effort to read and review an application that the person applying didn't take the time and effort to at least clean up some simple spelling mistakes?  I understand that no one is perfect. But putting a little effort into your application can go a long way. Not only does it make you look more professional, but it make it look like you actually care about the position and take the job seriously.  I understand a lot of the applicants are younger, but even they know to proofread something before submitting it as they have all taken writing classes.  (Sorry for the rant. I'd just like to see quality applications sent in and considered and things like this will go a long way to help people.)"
TheRealmOfMianite,3ct4n1,Aniline_Selenic,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:03:48 2015 UTC,"We look at all of them, even if we don't read the whole application. the longest are the writer apps (which make up the majority of the apps) and many of those are 4-5 lines long which we deny automatically. There just isn't the right amount of effort put into them. Next are the longer ones which are approved depending on the first paragraph because we need people who can pull our attention in within the first part.  The truly good applications are the ones that even after the first paragraph make us want to keep reading (some have been fantastic)."
TheRealmOfMianite,3ct4n1,mayley,2,Fri Jul 10 16:12:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, come to think of it, 500 is a massive amount when you first see it. But I imagine the quality on a good majority of them are incredibly poor that can be dismissed easily."
TheRealmOfMianite,3ct4n1,Terwookie,2,Fri Jul 10 16:04:57 2015 UTC,"Does this mean that there are still vacant positions for writers, I was just wondering as I managed to sneak in last night at about 3am gmt and was wondering if I have much of a chance of being accepted?"

After all, the shadows take many forms. No, this Rival would be someone unexpected. Someone the Heroes trust. Mayhaps it is one of the pre existing NPC's. Perhaps someone completely new. Perhaps even another God was taken over by the Shadows. This person(s) would try to unbalance the world in such a way that yet another quintessence problem would start, and they would do this by tricking people and making them stray from their Gods. This would be the cause of them being my rival, and also their interaction with the streamers. I would try to counter act, but as we have found out, after a quintessence problem starts it is hard to undo, even destroying worlds at times. What I like and Dislike about my rival? I honor his/her ability to keep pushing something even if it is apparent his attack is not working. Perseverence, that's the word. (How ever you spell it) What I dislike? He/she has the ability to bribe people and make them think things are for 'The Greater Good' Cough (Jordan) Cough. Make them believe anything they say with a few materials and some kind and persuasive words. I think the only people who would stray from their Gods are Sonja and Maybe Tom. Sonja feels left out and Tom is easily fooled. Jericho stands up for his God till the end, and so Does Jordan. My rival does have a base, but it is in an unknown location and is inpenetrable.

But that, that was a long time ago, before the second dawn, a time when the Phantom League was destroyed and replaced from the inside, most of the assassins in the League were killed, including my mother. When I grew up I started the Hex Hunters, a group of mercenaries with the code of justice and honor that the league once had. It's not only for killing, it's also for investigation, research, training, and also for my personal gain, to unlock an energy known as Nen to defeat Madara, the present leader of the Phantom League.

(I know, it's a slow time right now in Mianite, which is why I started doing these questions, to keep people interested.)  I have at least 3+ weeks planned out and each series (week long) will be a different theme. So, the next one won't be about story.

Edit: Downvoted for having a different opinion on a website that's all about sharing different opinions?  No way! I certainly didn't expect it on this subreddit.

TheRealmOfMianite,3csed6,Terwookie,2,Fri Jul 10 16:22:52 2015 UTC,It just seems silly. The MMO and Mianite are different entities. A post dedicated to asking a question about an application seems meta and not very related.

TheRealmOfMianite,3csed6,Hidoni,2,Fri Jul 10 11:59:09 2015 UTC,"I'm so sick and tired of people lying.  Last night I had to deal with someone lying because we were never on enough to do a couple of heist challenges in GTA V. Well, as I went through why me and a friend of mine weren't on he says it was longer than that. Let's see here. Friday and Saturday I was busy watching fireworks. And during that time is the time we normally play, too. On Friday I learned that my brother and nephews are coming up for a week. So, that mostly put a hinder on playing. Though I did try my best to get on the same time my other friend would.  She, on the other hand, was sick from Friday until Monday. She hopped on Tuesday as so did I, but the other people weren't on. She was on Wednesday night, but didn't play because she was dealing with her dying dog (the dog has cancer).  Throughout all of this, the guy we were doing the challenges for, said we haven't played for 3 weeks. When in reality, it has only been a week. He kept going on about how it has been 3 weeks since he played and he gave up waiting for us for his challenge. When I finally confronted him about that, he told me to get over myself. So.... yeah, I had to deal with THAT last night.  And also yesterday, I came home from the pool with my family to find out I was banned on a website. The reasoning? ""Same reason the account you made 2 weeks ago was banned, which is the same reason your previous several accnts have been banned.""  The issue here was that I never made an account 2 weeks ago. The account I used on that site was from back in May. The account I had before that was pretty much instantly banned too for absolutely no reason.  Is honestly that hard to come by these days? Damn.  Edit: So with the 2nd lying part, I had the whole ordeal go on my twitter and it ended with me being blocked by the person. Caught him straight in a lie and instead of admitting he was wrong, I get blocked. Maturity at its finest right there."

I put the product on an order, marked it down to zero, even set up the order for the customer to get additional money off, so there was refund owed to the customer as well. I pulled the product, had it up at the front desk, marked it for pick up with the customer's name and order #. I put notes in the order to instruct the desk on what to do (sign out product & process refund).  I get a note today from one of the desk associates saying that the customer was angry that they had to purchase product. Wat? O.o I look in the order, the refund had been issued but the product was not signed out. I called the desk and the product was still sitting there.  I am pissed. The desk associate last night made the customer buy additional product instead of just giving to them what was right there at the desk for them! And I know they were in the order because the refund was processed! They didn't bother to actually look at the order to see it was still open for pick up or read the notes!  So, now I have to call the customer and profusely apologise for my co-workers incompetence and he'll have to make another trip up for a refund of the product he didn't need to buy!  This associate comes in in 2 hours and I'm going to have a long talk with them. I know it'll do no good though. Everything I tell them goes in one ear and out the other. They are constantly making the same mistakes and I'll constantly retrain them for the same thing. I'm going to start doing audits if they don't straighten up."

I noticed when Mindcrack or the Cube do it, they usually do a UHC too, and this last one was on short notice and happened to upload during Mindcracks.  Either way two UHCs at a time are always fun. In ""the pack/H2M's"" group I always feel bad for Preston who plays to get the most kills and never wins, and Acidic Blitz who is good at UHC but can't win for random unlucky reasons although he's won on 300 person servers with way more skilled people on that The Pack/H2M and friends.  In Mindcrack I want Pause to win more since I like his perspective but he just gets full iron and runs around now so everyone else gets more diamonds and enchants and gapples while he aimlessly hunts to no avail. Frustrating as someone who wants him to win more again, but I don't watch Mindcrack much so I don't have many others to root for. Like, I know Anderz and Nebris and Chad and Beef and Vechs and Aurey and some more, but Pause is usually my main perspective so I want him to win."

Justin/AcidicBlitz is similar and even better at the game but not as entertaining as Preston usually is. Preston, Nade, and Vikk together was pretty good to watch. Nade's always entertaining while playing Minecraft to me though lol.  I didn't really know Etho since I found Mindcrack around the charity livestream Jordan and Tom were invited to for UHC and the UHCs after that he wasn't really apart of.

I know Etho has never shown his face on camera. Never on videos or live streams.  Honestly, I wouldn't blame him for not wanting that. A lot of fans are can be very stalkery or doting. Not to mention the extra unwanted attention if someone does see him. It's a job to most YouTubers and outside of work, they don't want to be thinking about work. They just want to relax.  People need to learn to respect the wishes and boundaries of others. To many people feel that just because someone is ""famous"", in a position of power, or because the internet is relatively anonymous, you can do or act a way that crosses those boundaries or disregard those wishes."

But mentioning prophecy reminded me of the prophecy Dec (the priest) hinted at early in the season. Something about the priest knowing a prophecy regarding four heroes from the sky... Don't remember any more on it though, so I wonder what the prophecy was about. My guess is reviving Dianite, but since it was never mentioned maybe it was destroying the entire universe >.>"

Perhaps, much like you said, The Architect is Gaines, and he really has evil plans for the Heroes much like Botan did, and that is why they went through the portal again to an unknown destination. After all, Gaines was the one who programmed the portal, and if he had really been studying for years he must know how to set a location and steer them right where he wants them. I don't know. But if someone could answer me this: I know the final stance on 'They were in a separate dimension' thing but what about the 'Opposite Universe' thing? Was Dianite Good and Mianite Evil? If so, why did Dianite tell Tom he was tricking Martha and the other Heroes to go save Andor, so he could get his body back and take control over everything? (Not an exact quote)"

So, it could be that he took on the identity of the Architect,  manipulating Mianite so that it looked like Mianite was in control of the 'Architect',  but in reality, Mianite was performing WH's plans.

The puzzle would be another stage, just past where dagrun is in urulu. the reward would be different for each streamer, sme  tthaumcraft stuff for sonja, and upgrade for wags ars magica, a some bloodmagic shards for tucker, some witchery stuff for tom, and maybe some applied energistics stuff for jordan. during the puzzle other players could shoot the player with bow and arrow, atteppting to knock them into lava. the puzzle would be relativley difficult, and take a few attempts"
TheRealmOfMianite,3co9mr,tmr2000,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:19:04 2015 UTC,"My puzzle would be a egg hunt type of thing, I would give the players a list of items to find that are scattered around the place. A.K.A like the Quest Ianite that made the streamers search around for books. Some items will require a parkour challenge to get to, or a password that you have to find on a another item. The streamers will have to work together to share items and ideas."
TheRealmOfMianite,3co9mr,katrianrad,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:06:11 2015 UTC,I would want a stupidly hard puzzle that used their knowledge from the past to help the get through. Like doing a bunch of bloodmagic stuff to get over a ravine. Stuff like that.
TheRealmOfMianite,3co9mr,jakebee101,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:24:36 2015 UTC,"One concept I thought of a while ago that might be cool would be puzzles based on things relating to the streamers' actual lives, disguised in some other form of course. For instance, since Sonja is big in to retro games there could be a section where they had to answer questions related to that, or since Tucker and Tom, and Jordan I believe to a lesser extent, started off in CoD there could be a challenge related to that. Some people may not be comfortable with this breach of the fourth wall, but I think it would make for an interesting challenge."
TheRealmOfMianite,3co9mr,MrSlowbroseidon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:23:38 2015 UTC,"The puzzle would probably be a mind game type thing where all the streamers are there to bounce ideas back and forth and at the end of each section one of the gods would reveal something crucial to the plot line and give their follower(s) of them a key to something later. each question eludes to a part of at least one of the gods pasts and why they act the way they do. It would range in difficulty depending on the question or simple task given. It would be hidden in different areas for different questions like the clouds or ocean in the overworld for Mianite, the end for Ianite, the nether for Dianite."

TheRealmOfMianite,3cjrkp,Aniline_Selenic,4,Wed Jul 8 13:30:19 2015 UTC,"I always loved the heart of Mianite, mostly because of how I made it. If anybody doesn't know, it was a heart item that was given custom abilities by using three command blocks, to give it health when the user holds the item. If I had time, I would love to give it the abilities of all the lore items combined in S2. Damage, teleport, feather falling, looting and maybe the ability to change blocks to other types of blocks."
TheRealmOfMianite,3cjrkp,MrMadSpy,3,Wed Jul 8 16:27:45 2015 UTC,I would give them a enchanted golden apple that was named with coords (please that's something that needs closure) and the apple would lead them to a huge storyline place with a menacing boss. After eating the apple they would get regular effects but a super powerful sword and/or chestplate would be sent to their inventory. Within Mianite this would involve saving a titan or some evil god who has storyline info on the shadows or something in their world. I would give it to Sonja because she deserves to  be the hero. A quest or puzzle or deal with a god to get it.
TheRealmOfMianite,3cjrkp,MrTwo-Face,2,Wed Jul 8 18:25:00 2015 UTC,"are you referring to ""The Key""? I always wondered what that was supposed to be about."

TheRealmOfMianite,3cjrkp,8bit-moo,3,Tue Jul 14 20:28:41 2015 UTC,"To a follower of Dianite, I would grant the Seed of Chaos.  A geode of dark, fragmented stone, this arcane gem is of the very essence of Chaos itself. Those touched by its power are gripped by a frenzy of violence, striking out at anything within reach in a madness that can only end in death. The wielder seems unaffected - but for how long?  Effectively, the Seed would be an AOE spell of some kind, in the guise of a gemstone, perhaps a ruby. When cast, all NPCs and mobs within a certain radius of the wielder would instantly become hostile to each other, jumping into combat without a second's thought until they were all killed.   One key aspect of Dianite is his domain over Chaos, the counterpoint to Mianite's embodiment of Order. We haven't really seen the extreme of this patronage of what is effectively madness. The Seed could be used as a representation of how a Dianite follower can go too far in his pursuit of the divine. Its backstory could be just that; a fanatic worshipper of Dianite who, in his desire for complete anarchy, tried to pit all the world against each other with the use of the Seed.  The obvious candidate for the new wielder of the Seed would be Tom, as a follower of Dianite, but I don't think it would be granted to him. It is a dangerous tool, capable of much destruction, and Tom is precisely the type who would use it foolishly and risk much. Dianite, therefore, would probably trust its power to a more balanced, reliable individual, one who understands risk better and acts more cautiously: Jordan. The Seed is an item only to be used in dire extremity, and Jordan would be a good choice to keep it secret and safe from misuse.  Obtaining the Seed would be a dangerous, arduous task. A great dungeon, perhaps, invading a place of pure chaos in a quest to retrieve something of its very essence, fighting off strange and eldritch beings of madness and cruelty. It would be a journey into the dark side of Dianite's mind and realm - an adventure for all the streamers to journey on, to steal and safeguard a droplet of madness, until it is truly and desperately needed."

TheRealmOfMianite,3cjrkp,miaday,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:30:51 2015 UTC,"I would give them an ancient sword, that had been passed down for generations. Then I would trick them by stealing it and claiming they had lost it and get them to do stuff in order to win over my favour."
TheRealmOfMianite,3cjrkp,Gearshift852,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:49:35 2015 UTC,"I would have made for each Streamer a God Item. Sort of like Ianite's sugar, The Sword of Dianite and the Heart of Mianite, except that everyone got something from their respective Gods, and they all had to seperately go through puzzle shrines for each item for each God. The items could be used to summon the God they follow and things like that, almost like praying. They would each have to protect their item so that people did not steal it, and I feel this would add an interesting aspect to the purge as well as balance out the way the Gods show up (Pretty often, but not all the time) I think this would work great with the 3 islands thing someone wrote."
TheRealmOfMianite,3cjrkp,jakebee101,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:35:28 2015 UTC,Plus it would add an early on Temple-esque sorta thing for each God
TheRealmOfMianite,3cjrkp,jakebee101,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:36:00 2015 UTC,"The item would probably be a sword or bow of some kind that originated as a part of ianite, it would match the highest power item that another streamer has. It would be given to the weakest player or whoever would be willing to balance it out. This would be good if someone had something that rekt everyone so that the others actually have a chance against them. It relates as Ianite is the goddess of balance."

I just wanted to say that I don't the the World Historian was planned from earlier on."
TheRealmOfMianite,3cigbq,ZachGabriel,0,Wed Jul 8 05:47:46 2015 UTC,"This makes me think of something. If WH/ the Shadows was in the S1 world, does that mean he is originally from the S1 world? Does this mean the S1 gods also have parents? If he is from the S2 world, how did he end up in the S1 world? Hopefully these kind of questions will be answered next season."
TheRealmOfMianite,3cigbq,MrSlowbroseidon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:03:11 2015 UTC,"My belief is that he takes different forms in each world, such as being the gods parents in season 2 and the literal representation of death in season 1."

TheRealmOfMianite,3cigbq,5park1ez,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:26:05 2015 UTC,"Just my opinion of course, but I think the gods being born humans into a world that already exists and just becoming gods for the vine adds on to their ungodly S2 selves. Not to mention their dad is a transdimensional being, which begs the question as to whether or not he birthed S1's gods as well and they have a very similar backstory, and if not how are there gods that were born into a world who are the alternates of gods who birthed the world, and if every dimension has the same gods, but we know they don't because Ianite isn't Ianite in every dimension (in middle earth she's an elf queen, etc.)  I just didn't like the idea that you can just become a god. I couldn't sit through the entire 50 page backstory, but didn't S1 talk about becoming a god by going through a state of Aethor or whatever, and killing another god? I didn't care much for S1's story but at least killing a god to become a god makes sort of sense."

Do you guys remember when Jordan was being careful of his pranks in the others' houses, and the others just griefed it to the point that it was too much for a simple prank?  I'm happy that the Spectre is just here so Jordan cannot worry about his stuff being stolen or griefed. Tom used to steal from him in Season 1, but no longer will this happen in Season 3."

Using mod enderchests, they can still be stolen but its alot harder."
TheRealmOfMianite,3cfixx,leonissenbaum,5,Sat Jul 11 10:54:36 2015 UTC,"I loved the breaking into vaults concept, but with the mods, some things are too expensive and time consuming to steal. Like imagine stealing Wags spellbook, or any of Tucker's blood things. There should be a limit as to what you can put in spectre."
TheRealmOfMianite,3cfixx,G0ldbobby,5,Tue Jul 7 15:33:51 2015 UTC,There shouldn't be a spectre in the first place because it is basically an ender chest which was banned when they began Mianite.  Even if something is stolen the streamer usually made each other do certain things to get the armor back think back to season 1 when Tom had some of sparklez gear and made him play a mini game which Jordan won and Tom returned the gear.
TheRealmOfMianite,3cfixx,kashkiid,3,Tue Jul 7 17:23:15 2015 UTC,"The spectre was a smart move. More so because Tom had planned multiple times to take jordan's ME drives. People forgot a huge thing, and that was the fact that most items in season 2 were really hard to get back if they were stolen. A spot where people realized this, was the famous ""Jordan and the snitch"" incident. Tom had taken his bow out of jealousy and gave no hint at ever giving it back(hint to jordan). From Jordan's side, it looked like tom had destroyed the bow, and jordan was very doubtful about the coords.(granted, tom in turn listened to snitches to find out jordan was subbed with the coords).   In season 2, the biggest reason why a major war didn't break out between Tom and Jordan, was because Jordan's stuff was safe."

Think how easy it would Have been to break into toms one vault that teleports you to the vault with a command block.  Just ender pearl through the wall, and activate the command block manually.  Boom, your in.  Even if you put server building protection on it, you could still look at the command block and find out where the vault was at.  Then you simply dig to its location, and ender glitch again.  It's incredibly easy to break into vaults, especially with mods.  I think if they are going to get rid of spectre, then there needs to be a better vault system.  Not completely unstoppable, but incredibly difficult to break into."
TheRealmOfMianite,3cfixx,TechnicallyNerd,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:40:59 2015 UTC,"In season 2, everyone was so rich they didn't need to steal anything... It had nothing to do with the ME system."

TheRealmOfMianite,3cfixx,DarkestOfTheLinks,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:00:39 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer they just go back to vanilla entirely and not have to deal with modded vaults, just because there are a ton of ways to make an indestructible or untouchable room. Should they do modded, they shouldn't use the specter dimension, but rather they should use the pneumatic craft security bench, which creates a ""vault zone"" that you can't destroy or right click in until you hack the system"
TheRealmOfMianite,3cfixx,petarkus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:56:27 2015 UTC,"I think they should keep spectre, but limit what you're allowed to keep in there."
TheRealmOfMianite,3cfixx,kittypuppet,0,Wed Jul 8 02:29:57 2015 UTC,Yes spectre should be banned from the start of season 3 but ME systems shouldn't be in my opinion. You can easily make an ME system in a vault and it makes finding and storing items much easier for streamers.
TheRealmOfMianite,3cfixx,CrypticRisk,0,Tue Jul 7 20:21:09 2015 UTC,"I would be okay with the banning of things being stored in Spectre if that's what the streamers want to do. However, the main benefit to Spectre isn't necessarily even its safety - it's the fact that using it means streamers don't need to travel to their house just to grab something real quick if they're far away. It lets them get things done more quickly, and keeps us from having long stretches of literally nothing.  That's where ME Quantum Rings come in. My suggestion is for every streamer who wants one to get a free ME Quantum Ring to their spectre dimension (as a gift from their god, of course, or perhaps as a quest reward) so they can access their ME system from anywhere, while keeping the main system in the Overworld for the sake of purge.   I would say they should all just work towards one for themselves, but the rings would be more for our benefit than the streamers so that we don't have to watch someone spend half an hour per stream backtracking to their house for something.  Oh, and make stealing the actual storage drives against the rules. No one wants to have literally everything gone just because someone took eight items."
TheRealmOfMianite,3cfixx,ShinF,-1,Wed Jul 8 01:40:13 2015 UTC,Maybe they could give to a purge winner an OP spectre key and for 2 minutes they could go around all spectres and rob the shit they want.

Actions I would take would include NOT blowing up the temple. Probably attempting to kill the other Gods and gain power over the hole land. I would keep my items fairly simple, so Tom's request for invis armour would be denied. If other players made a sacrifice of another player in my temple they would gain a granted prayer that way.

Is this comment in regards to the warning we gave to the BlockworksYT account about self-advertisement and the possibility that the account could be shadowbanned by reddit admins?    If so, then you are greatly misunderstanding the situation. Part of reddiquette includes using Reddit for self-advertisement and you may be considered a spammer if you only post your own content and nothing else.   Feel free to post links to your own content (within reason). But if that's all you ever post, or it always seems to get voted down, take a good hard look in the mirror — you just might be a spammer. A widely used rule of thumb is the 9:1 ratio, i.e. only 1 out of every 10 of your submissions should be your own content.   We gave a warning to the BlockworksYT account near the beginning of the season in order to prevent the account from being shadowbanned by reddit admins. We felt it was better to let them know, so they could change how they posted, and still be able to continue posting in the future.  It does not mean you are not allow to create posts. It was a warning, only for that account alone and had nothing to do with this subreddit, but reddit admin specifically.    If this is not what you are referring to, please clarify so I can understand why you would not be allowed to create a post.  Thank you."

I was talking about the hundreds of messages me and a few people got stating that we were not allowed to post lore and opinions on the sub reddit from ""fans"" because it ""ruined the community"". Therefore  it was no longer worth posting content on the sub reddit, because the opinion of fans was we are not allowed to post content because it is their job to do so. And as you might understand it is not worth giving fuel to the fire for more reasons for people to hate us."

No one should feel that their content is worth any less than someone else. We do welcome content by anyone (as long as it's within the rules), as that's what makes the subreddit go.   I also apologize for jumping to conclusions about what you meant. It was wrong of me to assume like that, and it's something I need to work on.

While you may consider yourselves part of Blockworks, reddit does not. That warning was given to adhere to reddits own rules and to prevent that account from being shadowbanned. Your account and that account are 2 completely different entities. You've commented a lot without ever really making a post. Not only will it be allowed, but it will be welcomed.  Link posts with no comments that are only being posted to benefit your business is wrong and against reddit rules.

The way they appear in season 2 should be the same way; the gods do not have to be a big, awe-striking, surprise every single time they show up, like in the first season. The other characters that we have not yet encountered are sure to be just as interactive as the characters in S2, like the Alter Egos and even the gods in the old world. The way the characters other the main 5 heroes interact with them is way more appealing than one of the gods getting on every once in awhile."

I had an idea of Sparklez being sent on quests by Andor, and has to look over a teenage Ianita (Who I think should be carried over to the new place via convenient portal.) Tom should be sent on quests by Mot. Wag should be helping Martha. Last, but not least Tucker and Sonja should help with other missions (as usual), and be sent on quests by Martha or Andor."
TheRealmOfMianite,3cbatc,TechnicallyNerd,8,Mon Jul 6 15:57:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the criticism. I guess I can comment on the puzzle section of your criticism, as I was the one who created all the puzzles in Mianite.  First, a little behind the scenes backstory. Crypt 5 took about 5 days of work to complete.. From 9am to 4am for all five days. Crypt 5 was designed in four sections, section 1 introduction, section 2 saving their loved ones, section 3 visual nightmare, section 4 what could have been.  I am slightly upset that you called the puzzle stupid. As it was designed for that section to get the most impact, and it worked when I watched all their videos. The puzzle is a 30 second countdown till their object/mob was killed, the streamer has to panic and flip all the levers as quickly as possible to save their loved one. Which is why levers were chosen, and not buttons or plates, to get the most impact of this action. The puzzle also had a ""fail safe"", if the streamer does not complete the puzzle in a certain amount of tries, they fail forever and the door breaks open rather than just opens.  Without this puzzle, the entire crypt would of felt like a walking adventure, you mentioned having them face themselves. I thought of this, in fact I had it prepared. However, Tom was not able to make the day we were told he would be back. Resulting in us changing an entire section of the crypt within about 10mins. We had no morphs, mobs or statues of Waglington, resulting in that idea to be dropped. Morphs would also lose the impact, as killing said person would show the wrong name in the chat. Instead, we had disappearing statues.  You are right, puzzles do have their place, but I feel that you are wrong, that was 100% the right place to do the puzzle.  But thank you for the criticism anyway.  Your complaint about the characters being gone for so long so their impact is reduced is valid, but unavoidable. We would of had complaints if Farmer Steve and Guard Tom stayed when they were not required, and do remember that the story had to be paused because Tom was away. Personally, Guard Tom had to go because he wasn't required and I had so much to do behind the scenes that playing Guard Tom would of meant more delays and maybe the death of my sanity.  Also, you mentioned no punishments for killing and stealing, we had that system in place. Isn't that the streamer's job? When we tried to introduce a system, Tucker didn't want it, he said he would rather get payback than a trial. I know this part of your criticism isn't really directed towards the team, but shoudn't that part of their stream be up to them and not the fans? Otherwise we will never get anything new, and they will be repeating so much content already explored. What I am trying to say is, if the streamers want to introduce a punishment system, they need to do it themselves. Mianite is a series of friends playing together and works best when the interactions are from the streamer's own suggestions and ideas, but that is my personal point of my view.  Anyway, thanks for the criticism. Been a nice insight."
TheRealmOfMianite,3cbatc,MrMadSpy,2,Mon Jul 6 20:55:15 2015 UTC,so what i got from this was that if tom had been there you guys wold have excluded wag ?
TheRealmOfMianite,3cbatc,GreenCat98,3,Mon Jul 6 22:13:33 2015 UTC,Why would we exclude wag? That would just be rude. He was going to partner with Tom. His nightmares would of been somewhat of a interesting element. I had some command blocks that would show some blocks to only Wag and some only to Tom. To make each other think they are either mad or untrusted
TheRealmOfMianite,3cbatc,MrMadSpy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:23:23 2015 UTC,"I would like to say that I don't think that puzzles them selves are always stupid, but I didn't think that that puzzle fit the situation given.  When all you are doing is frantically flipping levers, you don't feel the same sense of accomplishment for saving the thing you care about.  Same can go the other way around.  If you end up failing, you can't really blame your self as much as there was no real Direction on how the puzzle was supposed to be solved.  You could argue that this raises a feeling of helplessness within the player, but this can be achieved through better means.  For example, I personally would have made a puzzle designed to make the player fail. Make the puzzle have clear directions, and make it look like something the player is capable of solving, but because the puzzle is made so the player can't solve it, but the player does not know that, the only person the player can really blame is there own incompetence.  This will make the player feel helpless, and ashamed."
TheRealmOfMianite,3cbatc,MrMadSpy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:47:32 2015 UTC,"You say all that, but they all solved the puzzle on their own..  A puzzle where they will 100% will not solve is silly and won't give the impact I wanted.. I wanted them frantically fliping levers. It made the most impact. I want them to panic, not to calmly fail at a puzzle. So the timer worked. I want them to try and solve the puzzle as quickly as possible, so levers were the best item to use. I want them to either pass or fail, otherwise there would be no real interaction, the goal would be set in stone. A goal set in stone is bad story telling."
TheRealmOfMianite,3cbatc,MrMadSpy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:34:01 2015 UTC,"Also, although this is more of a joke, shouldn't it technically be up to the fans for mostly everything.

TheRealmOfMianite,3cbatc,miaday,2,Tue Jul 7 05:58:03 2015 UTC,"I know you are joking, but letting fans decide how a series goes is the worst possible option you can do to a series."
TheRealmOfMianite,3cbatc,MrMadSpy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:36:30 2015 UTC,Got to agree with you there
TheRealmOfMianite,3cbatc,miaday,3,Tue Jul 7 13:24:33 2015 UTC,"*EDIT: You might wanna flair this post bud  Farmer Steve's ending almost felt stupid to me just because we hadn't seen him in forever so it was assumed he was doing things for Dianite but when they got to Dianite he wasn't already there trying to help Dianite. He just sort of /vanish to become visible randomly and say ""Don't worry I'll save him"". Where was Steve? Why is he the only one who can save him? Why do we care anymore? They're leaving the world (NPCs jumping through with them was not planned) and Steve was missing (as good as dead) anyways.  Too many characters which did not enough for any storyline of importance. I liked the last crypt you talked about, but only because it focused on the streamers. This season's story was about and driven by the NPCs. There was a prophecy mentioned, not elaborated on, about the streamers to make them feel special (and was only mentioned, like, in the first episode and then forgotten) then besides that it was ""Martha wants to become a god"" and ""Mot might be gay for Dianite"" and ""The streamers Alts? Lets learn about them too""  I agree there wasn't enough streamer conflict. The trial thing was funny in S1, if it came back in S3 it'd be hilarious but I hope they don't overdo it because in S1 it was necessary to stop some bad things but in S3 they need to be more lenient since S2 lacked those bad actions towards each other as much. The heavy use of mods is what killed any hope for PVP to be honest.  Puzzles are dumb but I respect why they did it. At a certain point a bunch of writer/actor people realized it wasn't really a story about the streamers as much as it should be and the streamers needed something to do. While puzzles aren't the most engaging/exciting thing, there was an attempt, and it's better than nothing. While the final crypt may have been better without the lever thing, the other crypts probably did need that unnecessary puzzle interaction."
TheRealmOfMianite,3cbatc,krotoxx,6,Mon Jul 6 17:06:45 2015 UTC,"I am slightly upset that you call puzzles dumb. :(. As they are the perfect balence of interacting with the build, rather than the same old killing spider, walking, talking.  I refuse to believe that the crypt would be better without the levers, as they worked perfectly and had a great impact. The life of their loved ones were in their hands. They controlled the levers to determine their fate.  I don't find this important aspect of interaction unnecessary, It was important, fun and had them doing things that wasn't just the same old boring combat. There is only a few options you can do in Minecraft when you ask for interactive adventure, puzzles provide so much more interactive elements you can do in Minecraft. Puzzles are in all great games, I don't see why we can't have them in this one."
TheRealmOfMianite,3cbatc,miaday,6,Mon Jul 6 21:03:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think the levers were necessary in that, Boris and Jerry weren't in S2 at all. I don't know who Tucker's loved one was (Sonja?) but with that being said, I mean, they're obviously fake. That wasn't the real Jerry or Boris or from what we could tell was even supposed to represent them. We know it was fake because it was a dream/nightmare and they were able to reset the puzzle. I watched Jordan and I don't think Jerry died, so I don't know what the point even was. It wasn't like a Saw trap since Jerry didn't have to die, and none of them were scared of killing whatever was in their own respective tank, they were more worried about getting the puzzle done and getting through to the next part.  Controlling the levers to determine the fate of their loved ones (who were not really in there) didn't seem necessary because the theme of the crypt was to make them feel hopeless. Saving their loved one gives them relief, when having to kill their loved one (like Tucker's S1 Saw trap with Boris) gives them more despair, and in order to get through the loved one lived. So that didn't make much sense to me.  Puzzles are in most great games but those games aren't great because of the puzzles, they're great because of what its like to play and its story. I don't think any majority of people who play video games do it for the puzzle. They're usually just there so the protagonist doesn't get whatever so easily because the makers didn't want to put more story in there.  I like the crypts, but the puzzles were often unnecessary. Only one I even kind of liked was the portal one, but even then it was only what Jordan knew and the story and entire season was so Jordan heavy already it felt annoying that it was targeted around him.  It was only necessary to make things feel like the streamers had any control over anything at all. Besides that I wasn't a big fan of puzzles."
TheRealmOfMianite,3cbatc,MrMadSpy,3,Mon Jul 6 21:19:04 2015 UTC,"did you not hear Sonja crying over and over about her killing Borris? you say that oh the trap didnt matter but you could hear how sad and distraught Sonja was, or Wag when he killed kevin etc. The reason Jerry didnt die was because Jordan got the levers right the first try but didnt see the door open. You might not think it had an impact but to the person playing it had the impact they were going for"
TheRealmOfMianite,3cbatc,miaday,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:10:23 2015 UTC,"Right, it mattered to them, as soon as I posted it I knew I was wrong, but it wasn't such a huge significance because they were really focused on getting a puzzle done and moving on. It didn't not matter at all (besides to Jordan and maybe Tucker who was having issues)"
TheRealmOfMianite,3cbatc,Ralcatraz,3,Mon Jul 6 22:41:45 2015 UTC,"First section of your post is incorrect, Boris and Jerry were in S2.. Please don't try and explain a crypt and a puzzle to the guy who made it. I know what we were trying to do, and it worked perfectly.  ""Reset the puzzle"" is incorrect as well. They had three tries at it. The puzzle never did reset.  Jerry didn't die because Jordan saved him within the 30 second time limit, it kinda shows you didn't understand the whole point of the ""puzzle"". Jordan had 30 seconds to beat the puzzle to save Jerry. Jerry didn't have to die to open the door, death is the failure state.  People play games for either three reasons, gameplay, story, or both. Puzzles is a major element of gameplay, and a lot of people play games.. to play games. There are a whole section of games just designed for puzzles.. So I don't think you know what you are talking about here..  If you like the crypts but thought puzzles were unnecessary, then you didn't like the crypts. Crypts were about 80% puzzle, 19% combat and 1% lore.. And you complain that Jordan had a crypt for himself.. When all the crypts were designed for each specific streamer.. Crypt 1 Tucker, Crypt 2 Wag, Crypt 3 Jordan, Crypt 4 Sonja, Crypt 5 Tom. Sadly because Tom didn't show up on the date we were told, he missed his specific crypt, therefore we were unable to show his specific streamer element to the crypt. Also, in crypt 3 Jordan knew how to turn on the portals, but that didn't mean the puzzle was not possible without Jordan. Each player had a part in each crypt. Nobody was left out in design and in playing.  I understand you don't like puzzles, that is fine. But you must agree that without them the streamers will be only left with few interactive elements and just boring old combat.."
TheRealmOfMianite,3cbatc,Gearshift852,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:18:44 2015 UTC,"I already agreed with your last statement in my initial post and I think in my response. But combat is fun when its not against zombies. If someone made a strawpoll asking if people would rather see PVP or Puzzles, I think we know which would win. PVP in S2 was bad because of mods though, which is why everyone wants vanilla/lightly modded S3. I don't think I saw Crypt 4, and I don't remember too much of 1 and 2.  Jerry and Boris weren't big staples in S2. Jerry was hardly in S1, and Boris died a million times in S1. Either way, them dying doesn't have the same effect as Steve dying which was also pretty dumb feeling to me for reasons I already explained.  I feel like no one understood the ""puzzle"". They just hit levers and said ""oh no some thing I like is in that tube for some reason and might fall in lava for some reason"". There were what, 3 levers? Like in a Jungle temple? But instead of getting a chest of items they're preventing something from dying that doesn't really matter if it dies? Sorry Spy, I just don't think the puzzle potion of the crypt was all that great or as good as the rest of the final crypt."

TheRealmOfMianite,3cbatc,petarkus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:06:08 2015 UTC,"They kept doing it to prevent a war, which was also the popular opinion on this site (myself included) but I actually think, looking back, that ward actually bring in a lot more viewers and are so much more engaging, even though sometimes it results in a fanwar. At the end of the day, the fan war is just people being passionate about the series, which is a good thing"
TheRealmOfMianite,3cbatc,mwthecool,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:11:06 2015 UTC,That's actually funny that you've mentioned that. Last time I got into a fan war I basically lost a bunch of people I thought were my friends. XD

TheRealmOfMianite,3cbatc,leonissenbaum,2,Tue Jul 7 19:18:19 2015 UTC,"I feel that the reason there wasnt as much player conflict was the nature of the story. For once, they all were working to the same goal while in s1 they were divided. And in regards to the stealing with trial, it wasnt like s1 when it took time to grind materials. Okay, oh no he took x amount of a material, chances are it would take the victim a little bit of time to regain what was stolen. That, or it wouldnt make sense to steal and keep items. Like say Tucker's blood magic stuff, outside of Jordan, nobody else really touched it so why would Tom or Sonja ever steal his stuff when they couldnt use it. Back in S1 everyone could use everything the other had which is what made the appeal of theft and shenanigans but with so many different mods and materials half the time there was no point to it"
TheRealmOfMianite,3cbatc,petarkus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:03:44 2015 UTC,"That and the fact that everything was soul bounded so you could loose stuff in drops, so pvp pretty much had no purpose anyway, and that they were all relatively invincible, of course with exceptions but not the same vulnerability as S1"

TheRealmOfMianite,3c9iyc,TeamDianite1,8,Mon Jul 6 03:46:54 2015 UTC,I have read every post in the past 2 weeks and there is no confirmation nor denial of another Vanilla season.
TheRealmOfMianite,3c9iyc,jakebee101,3,Mon Jul 6 05:18:49 2015 UTC,"didn't think there was any confirmation on vanilla  also I wouldn't want to see mods they did this season, especially OP ones like Blood Magic and Ars Magica.

TheRealmOfMianite,3c9iyc,miaday,3,Mon Jul 6 04:21:02 2015 UTC,"Building off that idea, maybe just things like chisel, carpenters blocks, and some others that none of them have used before."

TheRealmOfMianite,3c9iyc,YogscastFiction,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:12:13 2015 UTC,"Extra utilities is pretty OP too :(. I think as far as armor and swords they could be fine just adding metallurgy 4, which simply adds new ores and armor"

TheRealmOfMianite,3c9iyc,miaday,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:39:08 2015 UTC,Felt less like a team to me because they were so enveloped in their own mods that they communicated and collaborated much less often with each other.

TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,kitaz0s_,10,Sun Jul 5 12:36:35 2015 UTC,"Personally, the war in S1 was the worst aspect of Mianite. It was a lot of one side winning, if one side attacked the other, you knew Tom would win. The war was pointless and wasn't fun to watch if you were watching Tucker's POV.  I find vanilla boring, they already done everything you can with vanilla, and before people mention ""Vanilla mods!"".. Not possible with the plugins required to run Mianite. Unless you want no gods."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,MrMadSpy,7,Sun Jul 5 22:41:19 2015 UTC,"It wasn't even a war, it was Tom deciding to attack and steal from the others while they were like ""this is stupid"".   Every episode Tucker would go on about how he hates this and if he wanted this he would be playing factions."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,headgehog55,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:55:54 2015 UTC,I don't watch Trucker but what why didn't he just do the same thing back to Tom then? Tom almost never gets too upset about losing things as long as they're not totally important. Like the whole situation with Namo was entertaining.
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,GeneralJacob,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:47:34 2015 UTC,Because during part of the war (or was it during all of it? I can't remember) they had no idea where Tom's base was and they also didn't have good weapons/armour to retaliate. Hence the reason why Tucker didn't like it.
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,YumeBaah,5,Mon Jul 6 14:07:47 2015 UTC,"Some of the war was fun. If Dec was able to get on more as Mianite it'd be more balanced and therefore more exciting, which is why BW can make stuff like that interesting."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,miaday,3,Sun Jul 5 23:20:27 2015 UTC,Ik...and since we now have people that play as the gods and such...it would make for really interesting wars especially if the gods are involved this time around and the streamers can't kill the gods cough tucker (and tom since he always tries killing them even though he can't) cough
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,miaday,2,Mon Jul 6 17:35:03 2015 UTC,"Tom trying to kill them in S1 was funny because they'd just summon a fire ball to blow up him. He only tried like twice but just asking for a ""1v1"" and being acknowledged was funny"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,MrMadSpy,3,Mon Jul 6 19:40:22 2015 UTC,"What aspect of the war from any side other than Tom's PoV was fun to watch in your opinion? Because I re-watched the entire S1, and hated all of the war. It was pointless PVP that didn't gain anything apart from fans hating each other for their streamer to win. Watch the episode Tucker finally gives up and he explains why I hate the war. Spend a week of watching a guy mine for two hours, watch him lose it within seconds time and time again."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,miaday,2,Mon Jul 6 21:17:51 2015 UTC,"I had fun watching their PVP outbreaks (Nade was around too which was fun), finding where Tom's secret place was, and a bunch of other stuff from there. I watched from Tucker and Jordan's POV anyways, only toward the last episode or so was it ""enough"" and that's when they called it. If the gods were able to be on it would've been much better."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,MrMadSpy,2,Mon Jul 6 21:21:49 2015 UTC,"Their PVP outbreaks were predictable and boring.  Tom's secret place was only found after the war.. So the build up to finding said base was ruined when Tom just showed them peacefully. No invasion, no grand escape.  If the gods were on, I don't think it would of been ""better"". It wasn't better when they came on before, and it wasn't better when they came on afterwards. Tom was given diamond, Jordan was given wooden. I don't see how that was fair or make it more interesting, seeing as Tom was winning 90% of the fights anyway."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,miaday,2,Mon Jul 6 23:26:59 2015 UTC,"It was 3v2, but Tom and Nade often had better gear. If the gods got on and gave gifts for balance it would have been better. When they got on early season and gave fair gifts it was fun, when they only gave Tom diamond and stopped giving the others anything it was not fun. If Dec was able to get on more often and help out, it would have been way more interesting for both sides. The lack of gods in S1 hurt a lot of content in the eyes of most people, and the overpresence of the gods in S2 hurt the gods' roles and in the eyes of many people hurt a lot of content."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,MrMadSpy,2,Mon Jul 6 23:40:24 2015 UTC,"Most of the time it was 3v1, as Nade wasn't on most of the time.  If S3 rolls round, and I get invited back. I got some great ideas that build from S1 and S2 that can hopefully be a ton of fun."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,whats_stomata,2,Tue Jul 7 08:40:33 2015 UTC,"The war was a great time, it ended the monotony of the season. before you say ""all that happened was tom killing the others"", most of Toms items were from grinding before and after streams, any of the others could have done the same, considering it was 3 on 1 most of the time. When the War ended the streamers were in the right frame of mind to continue normally and get back into the story (when there was story)."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,MrMadSpy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:51:05 2015 UTC,"You are right, it did break up the monotony of the season. I am glad it happened. However, the war couldn't possibly get worst than it was. It was a major let down for me. It was the only time in S1 when I couldn't watch the streams and had to switch to the vods because it was so boring."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,whats_stomata,2,Tue Jul 7 08:38:26 2015 UTC,"The great part was that it was spontaneous, no planning, no outside interaction, just the streamers up against eachother"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,petarkus,2,Tue Jul 7 09:10:38 2015 UTC,"Same with how they used to choose their own purges, like they would just wake up and the four of them would get on and be like ""iron purge"" and that's just how it was. I miss when streamers actually had something to loose during pvp, it made it so much more dynamic"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,petarkus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:45:26 2015 UTC,Well I mean it probably sucked from Tucker's POV yes..but watching it all form toms point of view it gave him something to do since he was super geared out...the fact that he didn't get super butthurt when his items got robbed probably helped doe..
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,lukenate,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:32:59 2015 UTC,"That's where I wanted the gods in S1. Mianite should have come on and given Tucker, Sonja, and Jordan the proper tools to defend themselves with"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,Torrotella,6,Tue Jul 7 18:40:41 2015 UTC,"Basically with Vanilla, you reach a point where everyone is grinding for diamonds. Sure,  you also need to grind for resources in any modpack, but your grinding for some bigger project. If they went back to Vanilla,  the story would really be the only source of entertainment.   Season 1 purges were great, but I also enjoyed the changes they made to purges in season 2. It wasn't just kill anyone you see, there was some end goal or other challenge.   Honestly, the team working on Mianite should just create a modpack themselves, and control what mods they're using for season 3."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,petarkus,4,Sun Jul 5 14:12:36 2015 UTC,"I love the idea of s3 starting off where on individual islands. Provides a different scene to begin from. Imagine the purges though! It could be like skywars! I can't decide if the islands would be better off as a small little desert island, or a giant island (one biome)?"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,TheBronzeBastard,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:45:29 2015 UTC,I think to start off a small island and as they progress the wizards could grow their islands....could work right?
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,TerrorAlpaca,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:37:13 2015 UTC,"I think it would be cool if they created a custom world for Mainite S3, where each of the streamers (or gods) has a respective ""island"" which is connected to a main island by a terafromed bridge. You could bring back the temples of ianite, Mianite, and dianite"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,creeperkiller99,3,Tue Jul 7 18:47:55 2015 UTC,"The two things we need to avoid in future seasons is isolationism (see Tom/Optics in S1) and straight up vanilla (see episodes past 30 in S1). Everyone was fully geared in diamonds very quickly into Season 1. At a certain point, there's just nothing more to do. With mods, there's always something you need to work towards."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,CrypticRisk,2,Sun Jul 5 20:26:11 2015 UTC,"Sure vanilla could get a bit boring at some point but that is when the purges come in... I wouldn't mind mods but I just wouldn't like it to have so many mods and definitely not so op mods....but see that's where the problem comes in ...if they don't add the op mods they are basically getting rid of some of the main mods of season 2....like arms magical for waglington, I mean let's be honest the earth armor was op just as tucker was saying....then there's tinkers construct which personally is one of my favourite mods...but I mean there were some really op weapons which all happened to fall to sparkles hands...so that would be a problem....it would be a shame to get rid of the mods but they just aren't balanced"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,TerrorAlpaca,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:44:37 2015 UTC,"I agree. A few good mods that help with the story, or the aesthetics, and nothing too OP (like ME systems, and the whole OP armor things)"

TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,TerrorAlpaca,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:38:39 2015 UTC,I agree with creeper killer ME systems provide an equally great advantage and disadvantage being that any item can be easily found or stored but on the other hand they require a power source to be set up and all items can be stolen by simply stealing a few hard drives.
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,petarkus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:46:44 2015 UTC,"i have the feeling that with an ME system people get too...lazy or complacent. They don't have to take care of their Storage system because it is all in one ME, they don't have to throw out stuff they don't need because they can simply build another drive for the ME, they can upgrade everything to a point where they just stand at one terminal and do all the necessary steps to the next best item.  While i think that the ME system can be really cool  and helpful, i have yet to see a YTer use it with a certain restraint"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,larsyuipo,2,Wed Jul 8 16:17:17 2015 UTC,"At a certain point, there's just nothing more to do     I think the same can be said for Modpacks. There is always the danger that one streamer will reach a self sustaining status much earlier than others. Especially with all these machinery mods. all you need is a generator that produces energy, a drill /quarry and you're good to go. All the streamer has to do then is wait a bit until the quarry/drill delivered what is needed for whatever goal they're following.     I get why people want Vanilla back.It seems to be much better balanced than all the modpacks. But i still feel that 100% vanilla will be too boring. I think a few mods that help storywise, and with aesthetics, maybe a bit machinery (without the ME system and other stuff that lets you get too OP this also means no flight rings) and it'll probably be better for S3"

TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,CrypticRisk,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:49:30 2015 UTC,"that is true. TC can be really OP if done correctly and...well the gods. I'm not a fan of having the gods do everything and give them everything, like in S2. In S1 they had to pray and hope that their god would listen and help them. There was a chance that the god would say ""No"". but the S2 gods were, as i've said in another thread already, simply glorified helpers. ""Yo..Dia..can you get me [X]"", ""Whoops sorry i lost it. can i get another one?"", ""Ianite/Mianite i need X, can you help me out? Thanks."" I was not a fan of that whole god-streamer coexistence thingy, and i hope that is something the BTS guys will change again. They need to find a middleground between S1 gods and S2 gods, before they decide on what Mods to use (that way they can fill any potential holes )"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,miaday,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:21:15 2015 UTC,For me personally it's more boring watching then go from project to project then it is watching them make their own fun and doing completely nonsensical stuff like putting sombreros on toms statue and have the dine-at-nite. I guess we just have a difference in opinion
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,TerrorAlpaca,2,Tue Jul 7 18:50:53 2015 UTC,People can make vanilla mods and stuff to make it more interesting
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,miaday,3,Sun Jul 5 13:34:51 2015 UTC,That's an oximoron.

I just hope they can do a vanilla start to it without ruining the season with another story-filled pilot episode. We can all imagine them landing and they're in Gaines' old world filled with mods and another pre-built town, or in S1's world with pre-built houses for the alt streamers who then reconcile with the other NPCs for a good 10 minutes and then we read their journals they kept over the last 10+ years. I don't think anyone really wants that from what I've seen here."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,TerrorAlpaca,2,Sun Jul 5 17:54:44 2015 UTC,I agree..S3 needs less Story by reading (chat or books) more Story by seeing /experiencing. Remember in S1 that really cool cinematic when Dianites Temple in the Nether was revealed? That was cool. and I think that is something the BTS people can prepare without needing streamers present for things. Something else which is probably an unpopular opinion on here....less NPCs. I think the only NPCs who were really unique and interresting were Wisdom and Intuition.
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,deathscomeing,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:31:26 2015 UTC,"I liked Andor a bit, but his story wasn't really done well.  Besides that all of the visible NPCs were just weird to me. I didn't pay attention and can't know everything they said since they mostly used /msg but Wisdom and Intuition were pretty helpful. Tower Heart was funny as well in that one episode."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,deathscomeing,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:42:05 2015 UTC,i agree. most of the npcs were simply not memorable. i liked a few characters but like you said they weren't done that  well.

When i was back online i didn't really want to rewatch all the episodes because , to me, the story wasn't that interresting, but apparently i missed quiet a bit of background info that time.    I think the problem with having an such a info laden story is that sometimes you really have to explain the streamers what the info means, because...to be honest..they're not always the brightest bunch XD"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,5park1ez,2,Wed Jul 8 16:33:35 2015 UTC,"I think mods are needed, sorry season 1 was well boring quite a bit through it and I hated tom all through it, it was just as tucker said factions, I think the mods were great as they added goals and such to keep everyone busy, in my opinion though they do need to be more careful and maybe limit the number of mods, make sure there is nothing OP and so, Another reason I liked the mods is because it allowed for specialisation, I found that just plain great, like each of them had actually different skills and such, too me the mods were much needed, look back a season 1 and I am sure that about 70% of the time was mining to simply replace armour and such, sorry I don't want that to return"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6wl3,KrazyKommander,2,Mon Jul 6 10:08:59 2015 UTC,If we can get a mod pack that isn't so unbalanced as the crack pack I would have no problem at all and I'm sure no one would but towards the end of season 2 everyone got op and it wasn't that fun....  The early game though was great and I'm pretty sure everyone was enjoying it but as they were moving on each of them with their own mod it wasn't balance because certain mods make u op really fast like the ars magica mod in comparison to blood magic...if they are to add mods in s2 they have to. Make sure they are balanced
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6dgf,HASHARAHHA15,3,Sun Jul 5 06:56:25 2015 UTC,"same, liked s1 over-all and it had more hype and excitement.   I just went to look at fanart when they did grindy things (eg Tom mining) made for a nice podcast at times.  after that emotional rollercoaster of an s1 finale, I was looking forward to s2 and i wasn't disapointed when it started never having watched a series with mods made it a bit confusing (the wiki is your best friend) the first 20 eppisodes were best (npc staying at their place mostly, eg farmer steve and his farm)  but then I got annoyed at things (ANOTHER Ianite heavy season? alts? if you want to argue on this, fite me in the irc) and after the inertia i lost interest, the only reason i kept watching was wag and my bff's getting into mianite, I wasn't hyped skipped eppisodes and could care less."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6dgf,GreenCat98,2,Sun Jul 5 07:27:30 2015 UTC,"All I look for right now if for season 3 to be a little independent, for instance not getting something OP from a God or an NPC every 10 minutes and for the excitement to build up from stream to stream. In season 1 they were able to make their own choices meaning you couldn't guess what was likely to come. In season 2, some things you could tell from the begining, it was easy to guess exactly what this season was all about."

TheRealmOfMianite,3c6dgf,StarMages,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:25:32 2015 UTC,"(I'm gonna be talking mostly about the story because I wasn't into the mods/ vanilla) Season 1 seemed to be more of ""you do what you want, but we are going to suggest a story"" as the crew played which was honestly awesome for me. But season 2 (I took like a 4-month break in the middle out of boredom) was straight on with the story from the beginning. They heavily suggested the story be put through and it was just ""oh I want to do this BUT it could ruin..."" that part just really bothered me.   Also I'm still bothered by both of the endings to season 2. In season 1 you could tell the adventure was ending, the story slowly took on more of what they did and everyone was all out just wrapping everything up. At least for me this was not apparent in Season 2 at all when someone told me this season only had a week left I sat there thinking in shock because it felt like they rushed the ending. Yea with the fear chamber thing  it was a day (or two I forget) before the ending.   I think for season 3, they could focus less on Ianite (if she ever comes back, which I'm like 78% sure she will). like season 1 was okay because we never planned for Ianite, she was something Jorden came up with. But season 2 was more of ""Everyone loved her before, let's keep the light shined on her"". I know Dianite, and some of Mianite, were important to the story but Jorden (picking him because he focuses on the story the most) mostly was only concerned about getting Ianite back and as people have said before ""doing the right thing"".  So if there was something I wanted to see in season 3, keep Ianite's story to a low, if she is in it and look more on Mianite and Dianite. Maybe since Ianite's the youngest they could go a little into the past."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6dgf,TerrorAlpaca,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:37:25 2015 UTC,"I think for season 3, they could focus less on Ianite     As much as i enjoyed her plotline in S1, S2 was simply too much Ianite for me. I really thought the BTS guys did well when they left Ianite dead and i really hope they keep it that way. Personally, even though i watch mostly jordan, i would enjoy a S3 with focus on Dianite. We've already seen what an interresting character he can be, and i think if they keep his personality that way, he could be a great ruler for the S3 world (but hopefully a ruler who isn't as present as in S2)"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c6dgf,deathscomeing,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:03:39 2015 UTC,"In my opinion I actually enjoyed season 2 more then season 1, I think the mods were a great addition, though I will admit they should be a little careful not to put in OP mods, the story I felt was actually really good, I really like sparklez relationship with Andor and his relationship with Ianite, that was done rather well, now I think the reason this season let a lot of people down is because well tom wasn't there for half of it, I don't blame him family is important however it caused the story to stop for one and for it to end really quickly, now your idea about them being a little more independent is a good idea in my opinion however I don't want it to return to season 1 where the gods barley showed"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c518p,jorgeflbrito,0,Sat Jul 4 21:18:28 2015 UTC,"Not to insult the animator or the people who run Mianite, but this emphasizes the fact that a lot of the story of that season of Mianite was largely centered around Jordan too much."

TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Whovy,5,Sat Jul 4 16:00:32 2015 UTC,"I'm also extremely glad they decided to include wag in the way they did, and when they did. The timing worked out perfectly with Tom leaving for so long, Wag was a perfect 4th streamer"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,LegoKiva,4,Sun Jul 5 08:50:06 2015 UTC,Yeah definetely.
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Whovy,20,Sun Jul 5 10:22:11 2015 UTC,"Waglington fast became one of my favourite streamers. He was a fountain of knowledge with regards to the mods, helping not only the other streamers but helping me as a viewer with my own crafting.   He was polite and friendly so I would very much like to see more of James on season 3!"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,roikles,10,Sat Jul 4 16:32:04 2015 UTC,The 4 were pretty useless with the mods. Waglington came by and made everything easier which was great

TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,EnderRainbowRawr,2,Sun Jul 5 02:42:36 2015 UTC,wait wait wait he has done 2 4/3 modded gameplays i think he konws more about mods.
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,mind-lux,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:05:37 2015 UTC,You would think.. but.. he doesn't.
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Phugu,6,Sun Jul 5 07:41:18 2015 UTC,"I'd argue quite the opposite. He knew quite  a bit about many of the more extensive mods, such as galacticraft, and whichever mod had the ME Systems. He had a huge head start there. Everyone else picked things up quickly, sure, like Tucker with blood magic and Sonja with thaumaturgy (albeit Jordan did know some about bein a thaumaturd as well) but starting out, Wag, and Jordan definitely had the most mod knowledge."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,LegoKiva,2,Sun Jul 5 08:49:03 2015 UTC,whichever mod had the ME Systems.   Applied Energistics 1/2.
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,A_Wild_Wurmple,12,Sun Jul 5 19:52:45 2015 UTC,To be honest I wish they brought in like 2 more people. The original 4 gets a bit old after awhile.
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,TheBoyWonder11,7,Sat Jul 4 17:32:56 2015 UTC,"Wag was helpful towards most of the streamers during season 2, especially Jordan, where he basically walked him through making powerful spells and even in some cases makes them for him. I know many people construe this as him attempting to build his own fanbase off of the success of others, but lets be honest, if anyone else was in his position they would probably do the same. Saying that he provided an alternative viewpoint and is just another person viewers can enjoy if they are a fan of mianite, although I feel he could take a slightly reduced role, I feel it is unfair to want him to return to a role similar to the wizards in season 2 who were for all intents and purposes virtually non-existent, they only really featured in a few episodes, for Wag to do this would be a shame, especially because he contributed so much to the latest season. If he were to take a reduced role, then he should be given more importance in the story, he seems to be one of the few who actually tries to pay attention to the characters and his relationship with Martha was one of the more interesting parts of the whole season.   TL:DR He should stay as a prominent character who works alongside the main 4, if taking a reduced role, allow him to help write the story or become a prominent character in it"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,RedSkinnedDevil,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:22:56 2015 UTC,did he not say at one point that he doesn't really care about the story or something? also he didn't really seem to read chat unless it was something directed at him
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Ryan814,4,Sat Jul 4 20:13:38 2015 UTC,"He pays relatively more attention than say Tucker, who when asked to even listen to the TL:DR of the 50 page book Jordan read was not overly keen. Also Wag did seem to try to engage with Martha. Similar to Tom who engaged with Steve early on in the series."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,RedSkinnedDevil,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:15:55 2015 UTC,Tucker has hardly ever been involved with the story though. That's just not what he's about.
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Terwookie,4,Sat Jul 4 20:28:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I understand, it's one of the reasons I don't watch his perspective XD but each to their own."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,RedSkinnedDevil,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:08:56 2015 UTC,yeah but taking an interest in one character isn't really attention in the storyline
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Ryan814,3,Sat Jul 4 20:47:33 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, it was about as good as it really got unfortunately, although the story could have been more fluid and prepared admittedly."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,RedSkinnedDevil,-3,Sat Jul 4 21:08:22 2015 UTC,"if anyone else was in his position they would probably do the same.    I would want a channel where I know people are only there for me. Not because I was told to by another content creator. Heck, I think the storyline writers of S1 made new Twitter and YouTube accounts when the series was over just because they wanted fans of their own. Not  Mianite fans. So no, I wouldn't do the same. Just because he and many others would do it, it doesn't mean it's okay.   Edit: You downvote me, but I'm right ;)"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Terwookie,4,Sat Jul 4 20:27:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it is ok, I am simply saying that if you gave many other content creators, admittedly not all, they would leap at the opportunity to get some extra fans. Wag is a lovely guy, it may be a slightly underhand way to gain subscribers, but Youtube is a tough career if you are serious about pursuing it, barely anyone succeeds.   Edit: I did not downvote you, everyone is entitled to their own opinions and I respect that."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,RedSkinnedDevil,2,Sat Jul 4 21:10:51 2015 UTC,You realise wag actually refused to record and stream mianite even though people (People being the Viewers) begged him to do so right?
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Yusumay,3,Sun Jul 5 13:22:01 2015 UTC,"Actually, Waglington was asked not to stream (only record) until he got the OK to do so.  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRealmOfMianite/comments/2x78df/why_isnt_wag_have_permission_to_stream/coxtm3k"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Aniline_Selenic,2,Sun Jul 5 15:26:43 2015 UTC,refused to record and stream mianite   All though thats probably the reason why he refused to do so.
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Yusumay,3,Sun Jul 5 15:41:59 2015 UTC,"I think you missed the point. He didn't refuse to record or stream at all. He was asked to not stream and he was only allowed to record. He never refused to record (as he recorded every day of S2). He never refused to stream, he was asked by Tom not to."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Aniline_Selenic,2,Sun Jul 5 15:43:50 2015 UTC,"Read the edit. And yes, he did refuse, otherwise I fell asleep and him saying that happened in the dream.  Also, your last sentence was redundant :3 (I'm not trying to insult you or anything, incase it seems like that to you)."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Yusumay,3,Sun Jul 5 15:50:16 2015 UTC,"You do realize that the link I provided was to a comment made by Waglington, right? Those are his own words, not something you thought you hear or a rumor or anything.  Here, I'll even quote it:   Just so its out there, There are two reasons. The first (and main) being that Tom has asked me not to.. I have no idea why but he's asked that I only record. The second being that even if I COULD stream, my internet is too crappy to be able to :)    As you can see, Tom asked Waglington not to stream. Tom asked Waglington to only record. There's no refusing on his part. He didn't refuse to stream. He didn't refuse to record."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Aniline_Selenic,2,Sun Jul 5 15:54:57 2015 UTC,"otherwise I fell asleep and him saying that happened in the dream.   I'm being quite serious when I say that, since I'm schizophrenic."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Yusumay,3,Sun Jul 5 15:57:05 2015 UTC,"That's not true. That's not true at all. He didn't stream Mianite for 2 reasons.   Tom had asked him not to. His Internet was poor.   Stop trying to make him seem like this hero, he's not."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Terwookie,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:03:37 2015 UTC,Wag wasn't allowed to stream. He was only allowed to record which he did.

TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Yusumay,6,Sun Jul 5 13:12:25 2015 UTC,I think Wag is now on of the main people in Mianite. He was pretty popular in the series and I honestly don't want him to be a wizard again.
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Ssniper1024,7,Sun Jul 5 21:08:04 2015 UTC,"I think wag deserves his place in season 3, he was a sick wizard in season 1, working behind the scenes, giving building and redstone lessons. And in season 2 he was really generous, letting everyone use his ars magica stuff, and introducing minechem drugs and stuff like that he's earned his place  Also he gains a lot of viewers when Jordan isn't on, because wag and Jordan use similar mods"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,tmr2000,5,Mon Jul 6 12:46:43 2015 UTC,I love wag in the series because he is something new for us to watch. I agree with boy wonder in which the 4 streamers sometimes get boring in which maybe we can add more youtubers in the series.
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Fallenwaggels,6,Sat Jul 4 18:06:35 2015 UTC,"A huge resounding wish for yes for Wags to come back. I really enjoyed seeing more of him, and watching him come out and interact more with the gang, it was really nice!"

TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Magnavis_,3,Sun Jul 5 03:31:11 2015 UTC,"The reason people don't like to include wag as a 'main' streamer is because the fan base that watch him are already fans of Mianite, and are a combination of fans from the 'main 4' - I personally see him as more of a modestep season 1 type character. He is logged in, participates in things etc...I think that due to various absences during key moments this season he was kinda thrown in at the last minute to fill the void e.g. the final crypt was set up for the 'main 4'. Toms character had a sign on his head saying ""not tom"".   I don't think he was ever supposed to be one of the heroes.   People - myself included - want someone else to join who will be bringing their own fan base to help the series grow. Nadeshot coming back I think is quite likely now that he has left optic. If he were to get back into it and stream it would help the series. A completely new streamer would be good also.   I think I went a little off topic, but my two cents..."

You have no right to say ""That is just not true"".   pretty much every YouTuber/streamer has gotten where they are today because they ""piggypacked"" off of someone more well known   We're not talking about other YouTubers or streamers. This post is specifically about Wag. Like I said before, just because others do it, it doesn't mean it's okay.   You stream/record with someone who is more known than you in hopes that some of their fans will enjoy what you bring and then start to follow you.   I disagree with this philosophy massively. I'd want to grow my channels organically and not have to rely on other streamers to get where I am. Most people receive their 100k YouTube plaques and think ""Wow. 100k people that I got by being myself"". Wag will get his and think ""Wow. I got these by hanging around Sparklez and Syndicate"".

If Wag manages to keep this number then he did it all on his own, it's easy to get them not as easy to keep them.  If people continue to watch him then that means that they like his content."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Terwookie,0,Sun Jul 5 23:52:24 2015 UTC,"Yoir whole attitude towards YouTube is disgusting and childish. You see ot as only a platform to get as many views and subscribers as possible, even if it's morally wrong.  I thoroughly enjoy collaboration videos. But the think is, with those videos, the other person is invited and welcome. Now considering that every single comment I made on wag, you always always respond to me making things up and blowing everything out of proportion like the usual circlejerk does, I'm going to guess you haven't ready my earlier comments.  Wag is hardly ever invited to the events and even when the streamers say they want to be alone and do things themselves, he still makes it his business. Thus not being welxome."

It's not a persecution complex. But I'd argue people are out to get me per se. People will downvote me just because I have a different opinion to theirs. (Also, both of my comments you responded to had +2, then you responded and I'm on 1. Coincidence?) I'm more than happy to have a discussion with someone on this subreddit. What I hate, is people refusing to read comments, fabricating irrelevant points, then mindlessly downvoting to maintain their circlejerk."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,headgehog55,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:07:55 2015 UTC,"If accusing me makes you sleep better go right ahead, but I have only down voted twice my whole time on reddit and not one of them was to you.    You keep avoiding the fact that Wag isn't the only one to do it, and out right claiming that Jordan has the right to ignore the others wishes because he is big and please don't go whining that I'm not reading your comments because when I said Jordan had done what you state Wag is doing you outright stated that he had a bigger fan base then Sonja.    If you think people are out to get you then yes you have a persecution complex."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,night1172,2,Mon Jul 6 23:11:44 2015 UTC,say what you will but it is smart to do this if he gets his name out there enough people come to his channel and most will leave after mianite but some will stay after mianite is over
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Terwookie,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:42:14 2015 UTC,"But it's the most scumbaggy way possible. It's not smart. He's leaching/piggybacking from other streamers for viewers. When he leaves Mianite, so will his fans."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,night1172,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:58:59 2015 UTC,most will yes but some people will like his channel and continue to follow him (didnt say it wasnt scumbaggy)
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Terwookie,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:00:46 2015 UTC,I just think it's a really bad practice and someone should aspire to gain their own fans instead of other peoples.
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,roikles,2,Sun Jul 5 11:02:11 2015 UTC,Then I suggest you stop watching YouTubers and twitch streamers because they all gain fans at some point by appearing with other high profile streamers and YouTubers. I subbed to Tom and Jordan a long time ago after seeing them playing with the likes of Hutch and Seananners. It is the culture of YouTube my friend and I personally don't have any issue with it.
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,kitaz0s_,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:53:16 2015 UTC,True ... But it would be hard for him to earn subscribers of his own since he only plays mianite....most of the subscribers are only there for mianite now that he is also producing hi down content he might be getting subscribers of his own

TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Terwookie,0,Sun Jul 5 12:16:14 2015 UTC,"But that's the point of Youtube. Make your own content and earn subs that way.If it is hard, then youtube is not for you. Don't leach off others"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Woodward82,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:05:26 2015 UTC,"Just curious but why do you dislike Wag so much? From your posts it's obvious that you have a real problem with him.  Do you hate Sonja? She had very few subs before she jumped into Mianite's season 1. Would you say she leached off Tom and Jordan for viewers?  I kind of get your point that ""what you do"" should be more important than ""who you know"" but it just seems you are singling Wag out and that's a bit off putting."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Terwookie,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:04:18 2015 UTC,"I don't particularly hate anyone. I just disapprove of watching other take advantage of someones kindness by gaining views and subscribers in a rather scumbaggy way.  I don't mean to single Wag out. But Sonja basically started Mianite with the others. While I definitely think her situation and Wags are very similar, she did a lot by herself on the start of S1. She kept to herself and let people join her instead of the other way around."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,headgehog55,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:50:36 2015 UTC,"The issue is that most streamers they could invite have their own projects and that would make it hard for them to put aside all that time for mianite, which is a time consuming series.  This is one reason why I think we saw the switch in season 1, the series started out as a all friends are invited and slowly became more inclusive."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Terwookie,0,Sat Jul 4 22:24:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think he was ever supposed to be one of the heroes.   Honestly, it just seemed like the fans made him part of the heroes and the streamers just went along with it. It's hard to tell him to piss off on stream, especially when you're trying to remain professional. But he was in the way a lot and constantly around the streamers so it's like they had no choice but to include him.   Nadeshot coming back I think is quite likely now that he has left optic.   I don't know. Nadeshot has been playing with the How2Minecraft guys a lot recently."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Waglington,5,Sat Jul 4 16:19:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not everyone's cup of tea, I perfectly understand that. So while I'm not trying to change your mind or anything as such, I've noticed you seem to really dislike how I've 'leached' off of the other streams. No, they wouldn't tell me to piss off on stream. Do you know why? Because I was ASKED to be a player. I didn't force myself in, I didn't ask them at all to be involved. I was asked first, to record as Tom wanted to see how season 2 panned out and whether he wanted to keep me as a player. Which, he clearly did as he then ASKED me to stream. SO yes. I had an enormous helping hand starting my YouTube/Twitch, for which I am eternally grateful. But no, I didn't force myself onto the scene, I did EXACTLY what I was asked to do, throughout seasons 1 and 2, and if the other guys hadn't wanted me around, they would have said (Trust me, when you talk to them off-stream, they will tell you what they think). That didn't happen, so don't just assume :) Just wanted to get these facts out there, you may not like my content or the persona of what you know of me, but to assume I forced my way in somehow is both unfair and untrue, just to clear that up :P"

You seem to have missed the points in which I am trying to make. I have not ever made a deal about you ""[forcing] [your]self onto the scene"" because I honestly don't think you have.  Since you're usually playing & streaming at the same time, you have no idea what the other streamers are saying. Many of times I've witnessed Sonja or Tucker say (I'm paraphrasing heavily because I don't wish to remember) something along the lines of that they wish to be alone for the next few hours because they want to work on something. More often than not, they don't stay alone because you show up. I'm most certainly aware this isn't meant maliciously, but you seem to intrude where you may think you're not.   That didn't happen, so don't just assume :) Just wanted to get these facts out there, you may not like my content or the persona of what you know of me, but to assume I forced my way in somehow is both unfair and untrue, just to clear that up :P   Ironically, in a comment about me missing the point and assuming things, you seem to have done almost the exact same thing.

TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Gearshift852,2,Wed Jul 15 15:49:12 2015 UTC,"Well he did just float around on screen for a lot of season 1 when the streamers were doing something which annoyed me a little as it seemed he was doing it to get attention sometimes, and the streamers never really tell someone to, well, piss off unless they are seriously annoying them, such as Tom getting frustrated in his Reign og Kings series when someone was just targeting him because of his status."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Flamenaz,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:29:49 2015 UTC,Nadeshot is definitely coming back and he records with the H2M guys because they are the only Minecrafters out side of Mianite he knows.

TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,ThePrayingMatis,2,Sat Jul 4 22:45:41 2015 UTC,"From this, it makes me wonder if the majority demand for a new streamer from s1 is inaccurate (at least at this time)."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,night1172,2,Sat Jul 4 21:47:26 2015 UTC,"I think wag should return and even another player should be brought on, but not streaming like what wag did originally. He/she shouldn't be someone big name, and they should have even a lower role than wag. They should have to earn their role as wag did. As for wag, he's great as he is, except better Internet would be nice!"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,nightblossom,2,Sun Jul 5 02:33:51 2015 UTC,i like waglington (hence my flair) he is smart to do what most people dont like him for and that is capitalize on the fact that he can get a lot of views and subs doing mianite and use that to try and build a fanbase that will last after mianite
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,DarkestOfTheLinks,2,Sun Jul 5 09:09:47 2015 UTC,He's been a great addition to the team in my opinion. And I would love to see him return in season 3.
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Terwookie,2,Sun Jul 5 14:44:41 2015 UTC,"Wag is just as much of the group as Sonja, Tucker, Tom and jardon"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Gearshift852,3,Tue Jul 7 16:02:57 2015 UTC,"I have no problems with Waglington coming back and being on Mianite, but I wish he'd take more of a role that Fyre UK did. I feel he should just do his own thing, making YouTube videos for his fans, while not bothering with the main 4. I can already tell this is going to get downvoted because it's a majorly unpopular opinion, but this season, it just came across like he was trying to get as much fans as possible and furthering his own career by constantly being around the other streamers. Even when they tried to do their own thing, he would be there. I just feel like he's already got a lot of fans from the others already, so why doesn't he just do his own thing and try to please those fans?  TL;DR: I don't mind Waglington returning, but only if he does what Fyre UK did and take a backseat."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Magnavis_,0,Sat Jul 4 16:16:56 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda with you. Although Wag is asound guy and all, he kind of just doesn't fit in as well as the other four."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,petarkus,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:27:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he is a great person to have around. But I agree that he should go off and do his own thing in S3 much like the wizards did this season."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Terwookie,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:29:10 2015 UTC,As a wag fan I'd like to see him do his own thing honesly. He should join the Wizards and do that stuff rather than interact with the main 4 because he just sets off the balance. When/If Nade comes back he doesn't really have a spot
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,headgehog55,3,Tue Jul 7 19:19:08 2015 UTC,"Isn't that what Jordan does, trying to be around the group (pardon me if that is either untrue or the other streamers also have a similar fashion)?"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Terwookie,4,Sat Jul 4 16:39:06 2015 UTC,Not really. Jordan is more of a leader than a follower. Jordan has the fanbase to basically do whatever the hell he wants.  Waglington? Not so much.  Which is why I think Wag tends to follow everyone around so much. It's like he wants a shre of those fans.
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,headgehog55,4,Sat Jul 4 16:46:37 2015 UTC,"Jordan would constantly involve himself in the other streamers business, Mianite and Sonja is just one example.  Also, a lot of the time that Wag was getting involved with the other streamers is when they asked him for help/info."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Terwookie,0,Sat Jul 4 22:18:36 2015 UTC,Jordan has a significantly larger fan base than Sonja. He can pretty much do what he wants. Waglington does not but has gotten in the way of others many times more   Edit: Downvoted because someone is stupid and disagrees with me. This comment adds to the discussion and is entirely relevant.
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,headgehog55,2,Sun Jul 5 08:35:55 2015 UTC,"So you're argument is might makes right, that's stupid just because someone has more fans than the other person doesn't mean that they can butt in on someone else."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Terwookie,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:50:07 2015 UTC,"Nope. That's not my argument at all. Your intelligence is bad.  As someone with 8 million subscribers, he doesn't have to rely on collaborations for views. As the more popular streamer, if he spends time with Sonja, Tucker, Wag, Dec, Champwan, anyone smaller than him, he will be more than likely welcome due to the power of cross promotion. But if someone with smaller views was to do this, they won't be so welcome."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,headgehog55,0,Mon Jul 6 16:03:36 2015 UTC,"Insults real mature.  I outright pointed to an example where Jordan was not welcomed, there are more, and you stated that Jordan can do what he wants because he has a larger fan base than Sonja.  That is might makes right you might not have intended for it to come out like that but that is your fault."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,SnowLeopardKureigu,2,Mon Jul 6 19:26:54 2015 UTC,"I don't need to be mature. I can act whatever way I want to act. If you're willing to fabricate your own comments but then ignore mine, why should I remain respectful?  I'm not saying Jordan hasn't been in the way or unwanted. I'm simply saying that as someone with a significantly higher amount of subscribers than Tucker and Sonja, they would be more willing to tolerate him as cross-promotion would mean they could get views and subscribers from him. When you have an low subscriber count lile Wag, it's not so much tolerated because they have nothing to gain from him."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,Phugu,0,Mon Jul 6 21:00:38 2015 UTC,"You are dancing around the issue, there have been times when Jordan another of the streamers have been around when they were clearly not wanted, so instead of just focusing on Wag why not admit all 5 of them have done it."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,SnowLeopardKureigu,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:11:36 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say he's doing it intentionally, but yeah he's gaining/gained a large majority of his fans from the 'main 4' and I agree that he should do his own thing more often and try to get more fans of his own."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,miaday,5,Sat Jul 4 21:27:12 2015 UTC,"You know that you can watch/be a fan of more than 1 streamer/youtuber, don't you?

""Oh no, he joined and gained viewers, we can't let that happen, BAN HIM TO A CONER AND HE MUST NOT HAVE INTERACTIONS WITH OTHERS. What?

TheRealmOfMianite,3c40ig,ShinF,2,Sun Jul 5 09:49:32 2015 UTC,"I love Wag and what he's brought to the series. If it were up to me, he'd have a slightly elevated Champwan role, as in he'd be sort of doing his own thing but he'd actually be in TS a bunch. I just don't think he should be a ""main character"" as much as he is. I mean, I want Nadeshot back, but I don't think he should be a ""main"" streamer right away. They kind of just decided to make Wag a main guy which felt weird but it's whatever, he hasn't done anything wrong and I like him but at the same time I don't see a point of him being a main streamer."

TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,Itirean,7,Sat Jul 4 01:37:17 2015 UTC,"""Inevitability was a tool I liked playing with in season two. Players of games get too caught up in their divine right to make easy decisions resulting in drastic story changes. They need to understand that in order to influence large scale events, they need large scale actions and large scale courage to back them up. Sparklez and the streamers could have done a lot more in season two to change the fate of Ruxomar. If outcomes ever seemed inevitable, it’s because the challenges were great.""  --Chimalus"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,TheBronzeBastard,5,Sat Jul 4 07:18:39 2015 UTC,Sounds like an excuse not to make it streamer based

TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,miaday,3,Sat Jul 4 02:08:08 2015 UTC,"Having season 3 be more player-oriented would be great! Though I think the fault is more with the mods than the story. With the mods catering to their every needs, there was less need for player interaction."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,AerisaFoxFeather,3,Sat Jul 4 02:37:26 2015 UTC,"I don't say this to be spiteful, but whose side did you watch? Depending on who, every decision they made changed the story a little or alot. The biggest example: Jordan. If he had signed the contract the story in the end would have been different. Same for Tucker. If Jordan never decided to move his item frames, he never would have lost the interloper."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,jakebee101,4,Sat Jul 4 06:32:37 2015 UTC,"I watched Jordan, Sonja, and Wag's side. I agree with you on that, but I mean larger story events should have been player guided rather than being based on a pre-written story (like u/ItsEdwardo mentioned). In season 1 a lot of the player's 'speculations' would turn out to be true or would inspire the crew to make that into storyline, but season 2 was so story-based it felt like the players were in an adventure map at times."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,jakebee101,2,Sat Jul 4 08:00:32 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I really liked the way Season 1 worked like that. I agree that should return with the new upcoming Mianite MMO / Mianite Website.
TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,Gearshift852,2,Sat Jul 4 08:05:07 2015 UTC,"Well these decisions had more of a pre determined fate as he had two choices., so as /u/Flamenaz said, it's like a cutscene,  almost like the onesnin the Walking Dead game where you get a choice to save a certain character."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,GreenCat98,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:39:12 2015 UTC,"Jordan had most of the story focussed on him just because someone is a  fanboi, how hard would it have been to give Tucker and Sonja more story? and to NOT do things they needed to be there for (katsir and Sonja)"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,5park1ez,2,Sun Jul 5 07:35:32 2015 UTC,"This has been said many many times. Jordan had most story because he cared about the story. Sonja and Tucker didn't, so the writers didn't want to force them to follow story. Therefore, they didn't focus story on them."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,GreenCat98,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:25:31 2015 UTC,"IT WAS A CRYPT IN HER ALTS HOME TOWN, just at least include her for it, plus she fad great fun with the story when Lt. Al was around.  no jordan did not have most of the story just because he cared about it most: Ianite, Andor, Martha (for a short while) Ianita, Brorobes and other characters all played by the same actor... what do all these characters have in common? right they are all conected to Jordan somehow. the book was foccused on jordan ONLY.  of couurse I could argue Tom cared for some of the npc (eg. farmer steve and Dianite) and to be somewhat interested in the story, Tom isn't a big fan of reading (ingame) chat/books  so that medium of story telling was lost on him, I'm aware he missed a lot but he had his reasons.  Tucker only cares about his own god, mostly.  please, give the main characters the most attention (streamers are the protagonist... right? )"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,whats_stomata,2,Wed Jul 8 07:28:49 2015 UTC,cat is getting tough
TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,Leoro_,3,Thu Jul 9 08:39:32 2015 UTC,"I think everyone would like season 3 to be more player-based. Although I'm not sure how season 1's story was more influenced by the player's actions compared to season 2. I can think of several moments in season 2 where a player's decision had an impact, like Wag sending Helgrind to the nether, Jordan getting rid of the taint monster, Tucker signing the contract and how stealing Steve's apples got them trialed. I have a hard time thinking of story events in season 1 that were caused by players."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,Flamenaz,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:59:01 2015 UTC,"That is like playing a game and going to a cut scene where you have to choose what to say rather than it being open word where you can decide what to see, what quest you want to go or If you wanted to they do not have to  follow the main objective rather than being confined to two options. That's the way I see it."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,deathscomeing,2,Sat Jul 4 09:29:49 2015 UTC,"In truth I disagree a little bit, I think it was more that the players didn't really try to influence the story to much, they were given some choices of course ((I watched Jordan's view through most of it by the way)) and I think the crew didn't give them enough instructions on how to change the story, like I felt like there was a way to prevent ianite from dying, however the problem is that well Sparklez didn't know how to, like no body gave him a way"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,5park1ez,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:28:25 2015 UTC,"That again, is to reflect real life. As people have said before, in real life, there isn't a clear option ""choosing X will cause Y to happen"". There isn't even ""choose X, Y or Z"" because he didn't know what to do, it made it even more user based."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,deathscomeing,2,Tue Jul 7 18:28:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is true, however what were they meant to do? They weren't given any choice or anything, they had no path to choose, as I said I think maybe they should leave that bit of real life out or it"

TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,GeneralJacob,2,Sat Jul 4 02:03:03 2015 UTC,"I personally believe that this season could have been more player oriented and organized. The mods obviously were a bit overwhelming and caused everyone to go everywhere and it got relatively confusing at times. The player based story should be decided for the beginning of season 3 but as the streamers go and do certain actions, the time after their streams is when everyone should get on here and discuss what should happen the next day or soon there after. And on a sidenote, how are people getting these team names before their own such as Waglington or Dianite?"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,Gearshift852,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:41:25 2015 UTC,You check show flair on the sidebar and choose your flair. :)
TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,kitaz0s_,2,Sat Jul 4 08:01:41 2015 UTC,"Yes that is exactly what many people want. We want the story to happen if a player does something like how Tom started the war and Jordan more or less creating Ianite. While a pre planned story is probably better for those behind the scenes,  it's less interesting for us watching."
TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,sean3009,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:36:46 2015 UTC,If season 2 I feel like the story wasn't revolving around the players but that it was pre written and whatever the players did the outcome wouldn't change...if that makes sence
TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,whats_stomata,3,Sat Jul 4 06:09:18 2015 UTC,"There were choices like with al and the taint monster, al bribed him with a sword and martha was trying to get jordan to see sense, there were a few bits in the story that would of change the outcome slightly like if jordan chose not to help al then the storyline would of been slightly different like the abomination wouldn't of appeared so ianite wouldn't of come back and that"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,kitaz0s_,2,Sat Jul 4 06:19:22 2015 UTC,"One thing i see in your comment is that its all Jordan, others didnt get that opportunity"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,whats_stomata,4,Sat Jul 4 08:16:56 2015 UTC,Well he's right..Jordan was the only one who gave a shit about the story line...tucker and wag did a bit...Sonja was just there for the lols...and tom never gave  a fuck ...but I mean if Jordan didn't take the bribe they would've approached tom who would probably say yes if Dianite asked
TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,sean3009,2,Sat Jul 4 10:07:53 2015 UTC,"Its a two way street, why would they care when the creators are all jordan fanboys"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,MrTwo-Face,3,Sat Jul 4 10:57:54 2015 UTC,"yes but look at tucker, he signed a contract from mianite (correct me if i'm wrong) since jordan refused to sign it therefore effectively changing the ending where mianite possessed tucker, now had jordan of signed it then jordan would of been possessed and tryed to kill dianite so in theory kitaz0s_ is right, if jordan didn't do any of the stuff they put in front of him then they would of gone to the others therefore changing the storyline"
TheRealmOfMianite,3c24tf,whats_stomata,3,Sat Jul 4 16:29:05 2015 UTC,"You are completely right, this season and even some of last, the writers all tailored it to Jordan. Most of his fans won't admit it, and blame the other steamers for not giving a crap, when the writers have only actually tried hard with involving Jordan. The writers and fans need to understand that this series was never just Jordan's, and that they need to try harder involving the other streamers even if they are harder to work with."

TheRealmOfMianite,3c2l6i,seanpna,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:22:52 2015 UTC,"Great Idea... My only qualm is that this modpack is way to small. There aren't any main mods out for 1.8 so I would stick with 1.7 for right now... Some great mods to add in the future would be the archaelogy mod, ancient warfare 2 mod, and of course the main tech/magic mods (Botania, Witchery, Thaumcraft, Bloodmagic, ProjectE Ars Magica, IC2, Thermal Expansion, Ender IO, Mekenism, AE, Big Reactors, etc...)

WH is their father (he goes by many names like The Shadows in S1, and his master name is Kikoku Botan). Ianite and her quintessence has been spread across the entire universe. She has many different forms now but in one place, called Middle Earth, she has been reborn into an elf queen and has let her old mind say one final goodbye to Jordan. Mianite was controlling Tucker and Jordan because Tucker signed a contract that said in the fine lines that if Mianite ever needed help Tucker would help Mianite (this is the help Mianite needed), but Jordan never signed it so Mianite wasn't technically supposed to control Jordan. Back in S1, Dianite originally called The Shadows a test from him which proves his followers loyalty (Champwan followed The Shadows maybe we will see something from that in Season 3) but it turns out that The Shadows was actually WH and Dianite was trying to cover it up.  EDIT: You can always check the official episode recap for the most truthful answer   Hope that clears some stuff up. :)"

TheRealmOfMianite,3c1uar,Aniline_Selenic,2,Sat Jul 4 00:25:46 2015 UTC,S3=Mianite MMO? maybe?
TheRealmOfMianite,3c1uar,hirobo111,3,Tue Jul 7 21:57:54 2015 UTC,I think it will be an MMO based off of Mianite

Second, I REALLY, REALLY like all your ideas. Like, wow. I have read all the 'PLS READ Season 3 suggestion' threads and this is by far the only one I did not want to argue with. This is a great idea. I like the way you balanced the Gods in the idea, and since we already have a taste of Mot I agree we should get to know another NPC. Your mod suggestions really make sense. You implemented different people's perspectives into this, and I just wanted to say great idea(s) and great job. :D"

Ars magica isn't too OP unless you get really lucky, the only really OP thing was the Earth + Battle Mage armor and I think that was fixed to make them not invincible."

I think that they should have the thirst mod in the beginning, just so those first few grindy episodes are a bit more interesting, but maybe they get rid of it later on?

TheRealmOfMianite,3bzvsj,MrMadSpy,2,Sun Jul 5 13:03:42 2015 UTC,We spent over 72 working hours trying to fix the issue. Using a range of methods and plugins. Including Regionfixer.
TheRealmOfMianite,3bzvsj,roikles,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:37:23 2015 UTC,You touched on the fundamentals of the problem in another thread but just to agree with you having that many mods (and their dependencies) in Minecraft usually ends in disaster. Forge/ Forgemod errors can trigger the most cryptic log entries making debugging a case of trial and error sometimes and a pain in the butt all the time!  I'd like to add that I think that what you (the behind the scenes team) achieved this season is mind blowing! Did you even sleep?!!  We should send you beer and meds stat!!!
TheRealmOfMianite,3bzvsj,MrMadSpy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:59:22 2015 UTC,"Did we even sleep? No, in fact everybody working in production side of things hardly went to bed near the end of the series. I didn't sleep for three days, then when I did go to sleep, I was awake from 9am to about 3am. Spent it all on Mianite..  Working on Mianite has been great. But a ton of people don't realise the awful ton of work that is involved, and you don't get paid. Which is fine, I chose to volunteer on Mianite. But anybody asking to be part of the team for S3, I don't recommend it unless you are willing to put more than 16 hours a day when your working on production. Which is why some of the team might feel like they are too ""attached"" when it comes to feedback. When you put it so much time for so long with hardly any sleep, you start to take things to heart, it is hard not to when your life and soul is in this project.. Because you don't do anything else."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bzvsj,RadioMachine,0,Tue Jul 7 20:31:07 2015 UTC,Wow you guys at BlockWorks really hated Season 1. Kappa
TheRealmOfMianite,3bzfh0,Reddits_owner,10,Fri Jul 3 11:44:06 2015 UTC,The end is nye!  Thank you mods for doing all that you do as volunteers. You do more for free than the admins do for paid work.  So I have a question for this sub.  What would happen if Reddit ended? Where would we all talk? And how is your day going?
TheRealmOfMianite,3bzfh0,CarlR818,9,Fri Jul 3 14:44:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you mods for doing all that you do as volunteers   According to surfacing rumours, I don't do any work on this subreddit simply because I don't comment. Everyone else gets gilded/upboated/praised instead when they don't see the work I do.    What would happen if Reddit ended?    If reddit ended (Highly unlikely, but hypothetically speaking) I imagine the streamers and Dec will probably just create a website with forums. I know they've been holding off on doing such a thing because of convenience with this subreddit. But if we have no other option, it would be silly for them to throwaway this community."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bzfh0,Aniline_Selenic,5,Fri Jul 3 14:51:30 2015 UTC,"According to surfacing rumours, I don't do any work on this subreddit simply because I don't comment.    Can confirm. Carl does a ton of stuff and the subreddit wouldn't be where it is without the hard work he does. He thinks of stuff to help out the subreddit that no one else would never have thought of doing, and implements them very quickly.  A quick recent example: @MianiteReddit twitter account. This account will notify followers when new threads are posted to the subreddit. It only tweets every half hour, so that it's not too spammy. It's similar to rAnnouncer bot in the IRC.  So, for those that can't check reddit frequently for new or interesting threads to read, you can follow that account to see what's being talked about."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bzfh0,Hasteur,2,Fri Jul 3 15:01:39 2015 UTC,There's also the top/new/hot RSS feeds. I personally like those more than other things because it allows me to catch up at my own pace.

TheRealmOfMianite,3bzfh0,CarlR818,2,Fri Jul 3 15:30:08 2015 UTC,"Someone who worked for Reddit and handled coordinating all of the AMAs (Victoria) was let go yesterday and the mods at /r/IAMA were never informed, which caused them a lot of issues with the AMAs they had scheduled for that day and this weekend.  As a result, /r/IAMA went private so that things could be sorted out. Other subreddits (originally default subreddits, but a lot of others as well) went private as well in protest due to how the issue was handled (lack of communication from reddit admins).  You can find a lot information about it over at /r/OutOfTheLoop and /r/SubredditDrama."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bzfh0,rivaset101,5,Fri Jul 3 15:34:14 2015 UTC,"In my personal opinion, it was pretty obvious that we would not private this subreddit. But that's not to say I don't support the decision made by other subreddits.  From personal experience, most attempts at communication with the admins are ignored. Those that aren't are usually met with very few words and little to no follow-up with an extremely minimal amount of help or advice.   We have to run RES (/r/Enhancement) and Toolbox (/r/Toolbox) as extensions just to make our job easier. These tools are made by volunteers and I feel reddit relies on these volunteers to fix their problems far too much. So a lack of tools and lack of communication; It's easy to understand why subreddits chose to private themselves in protest.  This subreddit is literally just about Mianite. We don't involve ourselves with reddit politics, and it would have done more harm than good."

TheRealmOfMianite,3bymxn,HikariFujioka,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:17:06 2015 UTC,I don't agree that WH would be close to his goal. A full season would be enough imo to activate his plan (season 4) .I do agree with you tho that WH would just counter it immediately if the gods try anything. Also I did not forget countrybat. Alyssa = Countrybat.I edited it in tho to reduce confusion
TheRealmOfMianite,3bymxn,StaticShockMkII,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:46:53 2015 UTC,"You know it was revealed to Wag that Steve was his ""alter ego"" right?  Other than that I would love to see Season 3 be a return to the old world, considering there is currently an imbalance in that realm that can be easily fixed with Dianite S2."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bymxn,Chimera__,2,Fri Jul 3 06:56:22 2015 UTC,I might need to specify this better but when I said Wag's other alter ego (not steve) I ment another alter ego. If there were infinite number of realms similar to the ones shown (similarity being that the heroes are in it) then each of the realms would have a new altar ego of a hero. So technically Wag could have as many alter egos as their are realms.The one from season 2 had Steve being Wags. If they went to another realm it could be a Wag ego named Jeffery and so on..Reply if you need me to rephrase.  I agree on the second part completely. If you didn't notice I had that as one of my reasons why it would make most sense that season 3 would take place in the original realms. I mentioned it towards the end of the paragraph that explains who will probably be in season 3.
TheRealmOfMianite,3bymxn,GodOfRage,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:00:58 2015 UTC,"I love all of this except the Wag/WH alter ego things, since it was pretty much stated that WH was the shadows in their realm, so it couldn't be Wag.

TheRealmOfMianite,3bymxn,Level_2_Sniper,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:40:57 2015 UTC,Thank you for the support and for the fact that you like it so much.  It is still technically possible for WH to be Wag's alter ego. Just because we first met WH in season 1 doesn't mean he belongs to that realm. He could of traveled there like he did from season 1 to season 2 (via unknown method)  I am going to also separate side stuff into Side prediction and Wishlist (things that I want to happen that are possible but highly unlikely)  Wag deserves to be a bigger part of the story imo. that's why I like the alter ego WH thing so much.
TheRealmOfMianite,3bymxn,Level_2_Sniper,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:15:00 2015 UTC,I honestly think its going to be the S1 area with S2 Dianite there instead of S1 and because S2 Dianite isnt evil the world will be unbalanced and will cause Ianite to become evil to balance it out.
TheRealmOfMianite,3bymxn,Level_2_Sniper,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:05:15 2015 UTC,"Dianite did jump through the exact same portal so 99% chance he will return unless they use an excuse like ""He was absorbed into a worm hole and transferred to another dimension"" (I hope they don't pull that). Also Dianite season 1 is dead so your right (unless a new spirit Dianite lol ,but my theory explains why that probably won't be the case)  I do like your explanation for why Ianite would be evil however. Makes complete sense,But wouldn't WH balance it out. I am pretty sure all 3 gods+Followers+Wag = WH if not it will be close but in WH's favor"
TheRealmOfMianite,3bymxn,Level_2_Sniper,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:11:27 2015 UTC,"One problem i believe, How would Wag and Steve be alter egos? The ""sky people"" of S2 are the main heroes, CaptainSparklez, OMGitsfirefoxx, SynHD, II_Jericho_II and somewhat waglington. For Wag to have the later ego of Steve, Steve would have to have come from the S1 world, as one of the ""Wizards"". This makes no sense. If you have a reply, please answer as soon as possible. I have had this question ever since I heard the alter ego.  Also, since Champwan, CommunityMC (Dec) and the Modesteps didn't jump through the portal, will they be in S3? Obviously Dec would, because for S2, he was there as a priest of Dagrun, but what about the other two?"

TheRealmOfMianite,3bxvhh,miaday,4,Fri Jul 3 01:36:19 2015 UTC,"I have to abstain.  I think characters shouldn't be confined to particular traits (good, evil, righteous, chaotic) but at the same time I see a need to have a noticeable antagonist/protagonist, which to an extent, requires specific/controlled traits. And with having gods as these characters, it's harder.  For now, I do think it would be best to see it as this; Dianite is a chaotic, entropy-loving being who thrives on disorder. By that nature, he will tend to chose more destructive options to cause that disorder. Mianite however, likes order and prefers to keep a satisfied world. And by that nature, he will tend to chose compromises and options that keep people satisfied.  Maybe that is more of 'evil' Dianite, and 'good' Mianite, but I would like to say a more 'chaotic' Dianite and 'orderly' Mianite don't have to fit into the niches of 'evil' and 'good,' but sometimes molds into those niches, but not all the time.   For instance, peaceful protests cause disorder, but may have a good intent within its reason, so that disorder is not necessarily evil. Adversely, keeping order in a society that oppresses people is sorta evil, and maintaining that order and not changing a thing wouldn't good in its nature."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bxvhh,Joe_Pender,2,Fri Jul 3 02:30:30 2015 UTC,"I mean this is less of a moral thing and more of a ""do you want the gods to have clear sides they're on or ulterior motives no one has any clear idea about"" since for me the lack of black and white was almost disengaging"
TheRealmOfMianite,3bxvhh,Joe_Pender,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:45:03 2015 UTC,"Okay, then for the next season it should probably be a mix of both, if possible. You could tell what the gods are trying to achieve, and what they want to stand for, along with how they would achieve whatever actions they may take, though you may not know if the actions they are trying to achieve would set something else into motion that they would know how to control/planed.  It's about 11pm for me do if I didn't really answer you question, or it sounds a bit weird, sorry about that."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bxvhh,StaticShockMkII,3,Fri Jul 3 03:12:00 2015 UTC,The results so far are rather surprising to me.  Who knew so many people actually liked the less clear cut gods and the more gray versions of them. With all the fuss it's easy to forget there might be a silent majority.  Then again I could be wrong given Strawpoll isn't the most effective method of figuring this stuff out.
TheRealmOfMianite,3bxvhh,StaticShockMkII,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:48:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I figured there could be a silent majority which is why I did the strawpoll, but at the same time I also know it isn't always the best representation, lol."

A character with no clear cut motive but, his overall goal being the destruction of everything. It made you question why? Why would he want to destroy everything? Why does he want to go after this strange life essence?  Lore and mystery is what brought me back to this series I don't want to leave it."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bxvhh,Bilbobaggins212,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:38:34 2015 UTC,"The Shadows always seemed just like Dianite to me, except not a god. Bent on evil and chaos and anarchy. Why are the Shadows interesting to you while being obviously ""black and white"" but the gods aren't? I mean, isn't it just as mysterious as to why Mianite wants peace and Dianite wants chaos?"
TheRealmOfMianite,3bxvhh,LadyKrystine,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:56:01 2015 UTC,"His motives for his actions have yet to be disclosed, sure the way he gets what he wants is evil but, what is The Shadows overall goal, what caused him to be this way, and who is this ""100"" champwan was on about and how does it tie into all of this?  We don't know the answers to these questions yet, that why I wanna stick around and find out!  Questions and non-clear cut motives are what interest me because a story shouldn't just be a grind fest. Also story mean I have more stuff to animate later!"
TheRealmOfMianite,3bxvhh,LadyKrystine,0,Fri Jul 3 18:00:47 2015 UTC,"Oh I didn't know you animate, lol, I want to learn how but eh  I feel like all of the gods' motives aren't clear either, and the Shadows goal was to kill the gods and rule the universe, at least that's what he was doing in S1 and S2.  And to me some backstory stuff is fine but I think a more progressive story would be way more entertaining. It can be like S2 where most of it is lore about the gods and other NPCs, or it can be an ongoing story about the streamers. Idk, I'd rather see a story unfold with the streamers as the main characters than have the streamers figure out a story about NPCs going on."

Again I still think the motive of WH/The Shadows isn't as shallow as that, even Deadpool has motives that are deeper than just ""kill bitches get money!"""
TheRealmOfMianite,3bxvhh,YumeBaah,0,Fri Jul 3 18:13:04 2015 UTC,"Right, so why can't the gods too? Like, what makes The Shadows' unclear motives more interesting than the gods'?  Also, is WH/The Shadows transdimensional? Because that's still confusing, because he only gave birth to Ruxamar's gods, not every universe's gods like S1's, so the origin stuff is kind of messed up IMO"

TheRealmOfMianite,3bx5wg,miaday,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:43:12 2015 UTC,"I think the portal was supposed to lead to Aethoria, but instead they landed in Ianerea, where the castle is. Rewatch the part where they talk to Lord Brokkr. He says did they come through the Aethoria portal, and they determine that they're not in Ianerea. I think the Ianerea you're talking is sort of a colony for the Ianerea in the End."

TheRealmOfMianite,3bwn7n,Hasteur,2,Thu Jul 2 19:31:27 2015 UTC,"I am half in favor with you, half not in favor with you :p I agree that some people are just ""copying"" what others people say (and sadly cant at least link to the original post they got the idea from) or simply giving the same idea again and again. Secondly, I think that its ok if we share our ideas, or dislikes, even if the writers, the behind the scene people dont ask. They might come with something epic by reading something, triggering that click in brain. They might see where they failed and not repeat it. The writers are very good, but from time to times, we fail and we have to learn with it."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bwn7n,BrahamLincoln,0,Thu Jul 2 20:04:20 2015 UTC,"first off, no they are not very good at story, what they ARE very good at is building. if you want to argue on point 1 with me come to the irc so we can duke it out.  2 seems like a good idea.   3 we don't even know if they are coming back or not, and we can give feedback however we want.   4 very good point, can we please all do this?"
TheRealmOfMianite,3bwn7n,GreenCat98,2,Thu Jul 2 22:32:39 2015 UTC,"They're okay at story, I wouldn't say they're not very good. The thing, IMO, holding them back is that they treat it more like a soap opera or novel rather than Mianite which doesn't feel like it works out most of the time to me."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bwn7n,miaday,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:03:08 2015 UTC,"true, they are okay at it. and most of the story malfunctions can be easily explained if you know who played who."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bvaeo,GoldMage,2,Thu Jul 2 13:05:54 2015 UTC,"well, i sorta kinda agree with you on 1. just not on the whole ''Demi-God'' thing, we have 3 gods already (well four but marthanite isn't a God the steamers wanted/came up with.) and  there has been a ''no'' on new gods from tom since s1 maybe he changed his point but adding more major npc isn't a good idea in my eyes."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bvaeo,GreenCat98,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:13:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, limit the overpowered stuff. And then every hero gets to choose 1-2 mods that only he/she is allowed to use.

TheRealmOfMianite,3bveeb,Strikester101,6,Thu Jul 2 13:44:24 2015 UTC,"Since it may be the last season, I think all of the gods should be equally present so none of the streamers feel jibed of their god."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bveeb,Diamonah,3,Thu Jul 2 17:01:58 2015 UTC,I agree with you. It has been Ianite-heavy in both seasons.
TheRealmOfMianite,3bveeb,GreenCat98,7,Thu Jul 2 18:58:44 2015 UTC,we have had 2 Ianite heavy seasons now... and s2 focussed mostly on Jordan and Ianite while Dianite was dead and we had no clear antagonist till the last few eppisodes.
TheRealmOfMianite,3bveeb,creeperkiller99,4,Thu Jul 2 14:09:09 2015 UTC,Yeah you're right the 2 seasons have been pretty Ianite heavy. In season 1 Jordan arrives and creates Ianite to become a neutral side. In season 2 Ianite is helping the heroes recover Dianite and the story is heavily Ianiteish. I have a feeling they might not create Ianite as an evil figure solely because it sounds a little predictable. In season 1 Dianite was evil. In season 2 Mianite was evil. So in theory everyone thinks next season Ianite will be evil. Maybe every god could be a good next season (Just a thought).
TheRealmOfMianite,3bveeb,IaniteThePirate,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:49:33 2015 UTC,"I don't really see the gods in season 2 as evil. At least until the finale. At the moment I'm not really sure what's with Mianite.  To me, it seemed more like Mianite wanted a strict rule over things, not necessarily to be evil, but so that everything would stay in order. Dianite seemed like the guy who likes to have some fun, even if it meant breaking a few rules, but it didn't seem like he had evil intentions or really wanted to hurt anyone. Ianite just kinda seemed like the childish little sister who's still not really sure what to do. At least that's the impression I got."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bveeb,RealNightFury,5,Fri Jul 3 20:31:22 2015 UTC,"How about we have all the Gods equally present and good in season 3 and together with the heroes(Streamers) and Gods , they need to defeat a new antagonist :)"
TheRealmOfMianite,3bveeb,Hasteur,4,Thu Jul 2 17:45:09 2015 UTC,"I also agree with you, along with Diamonah and others. There should be representation of all NPCs."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bveeb,TheBronzeBastard,3,Thu Jul 2 18:59:41 2015 UTC,"While a ""Active and forceful balance maintainer"" would be interesting, I have to agree with /u/GreenCat98 that it feels very Ianite heavy from my perspective"
TheRealmOfMianite,3bveeb,miaday,3,Thu Jul 2 14:13:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comments! I think you guys are right. The seasons have been.... Ianite-heavy.  And I agree with Diamonah and RealNightFury, there should be equal representation of gods and goddesses.  But can we agree that there should be less characters than in Season 2? We want the NPC hype like the one in Season 1."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bveeb,TheBronzeBastard,2,Thu Jul 2 18:58:09 2015 UTC,NPCs were only hype because they hardly ever appeared. Do you remember how bored everyone was when it was just the four streamers for months?
TheRealmOfMianite,3bveeb,miaday,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:02:00 2015 UTC,"Mainly because Dec couldn't get on often and he would usually play the gods. If Mianite stayed god-themed and he was able to contribute with that more, the NPCs wouldn't have been necessary at all."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bveeb,TheBronzeBastard,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:05:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand what you're saying, NPCs are always necessary within Mianite as a series because the story is half about the streamers and half about the gods and their enemies/friends. Apparently Dec constantly being sick/injured is what gave Season 1 its charm for so many people because it resulted in the gods never being on.   Mianite has always been ""god focused."" The name of the series of Mianite. If Dec contributed more, people would just dislike Season 1 for the reason they disliked Season 2: the gods appeared too often."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bveeb,miaday,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:34:12 2015 UTC,"I've had to clarify this before since other people don't agree, but I don't consider the gods as NPCs. I know they technically are, but I think there's a big difference between ""Mianite"" and ""Steve"", or ""Dianite"" and ""Martha"". So yeah while the gods technically are NPCs they're not really who I mean when I refer to NPCs."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bveeb,TheBronzeBastard,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:43:23 2015 UTC,"It doesn't particularly matter what classification you give them, the Gods are, by definition, non-player characters, as in accounts being run by people who are not streamers."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bveeb,Dondagora,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:23:37 2015 UTC,"Right, but I clarified it in that response so you could understand what I meant by my other reply. I'm not arguing the definition, I'm explaining my personal one so you know what I meant."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bveeb,Ekkusu_x,3,Fri Jul 3 01:33:56 2015 UTC,The roles were not switched.
TheRealmOfMianite,3bveeb,koyadreeex,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:01:06 2015 UTC,"Well its mostly seen as extremes of their influence, so for Dianite it was to create world chaos, for Mianite it was to dictate world order, and for Ianite I could definitely see an attempt to balance order and chaos by killing both Mianite and Dianite."
TheRealmOfMianite,3btbod,Diamonah,5,Wed Jul 1 23:48:30 2015 UTC,"Perhaps there may be different interpretations of Balance throughout dimensions?   For instance, in S1, Ianite always seemed more a goddess of 'Justice' or 'Law' than S2's 'Natural Balance' to me, and that has always appeared to be Jordan's attitude towards threats to the Balance. S2 Ianite's problems, according to Martha at least, could have been solved by waiting and careful guidance, and that was what they expected Jordan to try in accordance with the personality of Spark(At least, this is how I justify the failure of Martha's early attempts to control him and get him to help Ruxomar's balance). Instead, he attacked the imbalance with liberal amounts of explosives. I've always found this to be his go to method of working for Ianite, contrary to everyone else in Ruxomar, and embodying the ideals of a fundamentally different Ianite could be a Watsonian explanation.   Continuing my admittedly rambling train of thought, Villain!S3!Ianite could also be a tyrannical force that ruthlessly smashes down anyone who goes even slightly out of line with her definition of 'Balance'. This may seem similar to perceptions of S2 Mianite, but Order and Balance are very similar concepts, after all."
TheRealmOfMianite,3btbod,Evilness42,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:57:07 2015 UTC,"I'd actually say that order and balance are quite distant, also season one Ianite was originally about neutrality until provoked, a concept that Jordan maybe forgot a tiny bit"
TheRealmOfMianite,3btbod,Ryan814,2,Thu Jul 2 01:05:31 2015 UTC,"Well, yes. I suppose they may be distant, but there are strong connections to Order within other symbols of Ianite. For example, her most common one is the Scales of Justice, implying a connection to Law. If one contemplates an evil version of Justice, Law, and remaining neutral until one is provoked, its not hard to make the leap to 'Vengeance' and, in the context of an authority figure, to 'Oppression' or 'Tyranny'."
TheRealmOfMianite,3btbod,Evilness42,2,Thu Jul 2 01:27:48 2015 UTC,"True however this is one of the main aspects I felt Ianite represented (Vengeance) after all if she is the goddess of balance then she must have both good and evil, both justice and vengeance must co-exist within her in order for her to be, even with these two concepts it is hard to draw a conclusion as to which is which when acted upon after all justice is just vengeance under the name of the law, this is where we see the true balance of Ianite, both of these acts are committed simultaneously, for example if you take someone to the quartzhouse you are giving justice but you are also aiding the person who called a trial get vengeance, so while tyranny exists so must order, both are within Ianite which is why (I feel) she is both extremely close to, and extremely far from both ""good"" and ""evil"""
TheRealmOfMianite,3btbod,Ryan814,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:48:52 2015 UTC,"I think Ianite should go insane in season 3, and try to kill Mianite and Dianite, with WH/The Shadows tipping her over that edge to destruction. S3, in part, would be sporadic visits from Mianite jumping over the world while Ianite hunts him.   Just a thought."
TheRealmOfMianite,3btbod,Joe_Pender,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:29:58 2015 UTC,"Wow. I sort of threw out this idea expecting it to be seen sort of funny, but people are putting some very serious consideration into it.   I really just wanted to get out the concept and people seem to understand it. I just thought of it as an interesting connection in seasons. It was when I thought about how it could occur that I began to see its possibility (but still with a field of improbability remaining)."
TheRealmOfMianite,3btbod,blastdragon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:27:58 2015 UTC,I'm wondering what Jordan would do if Ianite was the villain in S3. Tucker and Sonja quickly agreed with the other streamers that Mianite was the villain. But Jordan is much more loyal to Ianite and I'm doubting if Jordan would turn against Ianite. Especially if Ianite would use the reason that everything she does is to bring balance in the world.
TheRealmOfMianite,3btpa4,Bananagram31,2,Thu Jul 2 01:49:27 2015 UTC,"an interesting idea, but some of the streamers might lose interest in doing an all technological mod pack it can get boring and repetitive to some of the streamers plus Tom and Jordan and to some extent waggles would get a major advantage over the others. As a suggestion how about having a mod pack that focuses on survival,exploration and progression but still having a mixture of magic and tech mods and some survival mods (just to keep things interesting)"
TheRealmOfMianite,3btpa4,fsandoval12,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:46:24 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Maybe I should restate that magic part. I mean like, nothing that can give you ridiculously OP stuff. I mean, it's nice to see some variety with the mods, but at the same time you also need to set limits on just how powerful a player can be. I mean, take a look at blood magic. By about mid-season, Tucker was able to change the biome. That's a bit OP. And before he lost it, Jordan, along with wag, could literally kill anything with their starstrike spells. What I'm saying is, magic is OK, but not in massive doses."
TheRealmOfMianite,3btpa4,fsandoval12,0,Thu Jul 2 03:24:13 2015 UTC,"true, but you did say the power suit mod two or three people would be at an advantage mainly Jordan and Tom, (maybe waggles?) they would be op in a couple of days until the others catch up or develop new ways to hurt each other BTW (I think force fields is still buggy not sure don't quote me on that) other than that i agree with you maybe having the streamers forced to delve into different mods because the mod has custom crafting recipes."
TheRealmOfMianite,3btpa4,BrahamLincoln,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:13:17 2015 UTC,Yeah. Powersuit mod is also pretty OP.
TheRealmOfMianite,3bth9r,Cannedme,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:38:10 2015 UTC,to be honest the biggest difference between the two I can tell is that the gods and goddess was BORN into a premade world and not make it into being (acording to the lore) like season 1's world
TheRealmOfMianite,3bu7tm,headgehog55,5,Thu Jul 2 04:48:14 2015 UTC,"It's hard for people to take 2 hours every day to watch a series that is as long as Mianite is and I think that it would be better for them to have the streams be only 3 days a week and have the series last 1-2 months instead.   I don't mind the series lasting several months, but I do agree that cutting streams back to 3-5 a week would be good. It would allow the streamers to plan around the streams better. They would be less likely to miss stream days and more of them would be on at the same time to interact with each other and have story. It would allow the behind the scenes crew more time to plan out events. And, of course, it would allow the fans a chance to catch up on the series if they miss a day or two."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bu7tm,Aniline_Selenic,2,Thu Jul 2 09:14:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I've been watching Mianite since they originally began about a year ago, and I've not even caught up to Season 2 yet! I'm on episode 92 S1."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bu7tm,Torrotella,3,Thu Jul 2 11:47:52 2015 UTC,"You may want to consider watching Jordan's VODs, only because they are edited down to around 45min each. It's a little faster to catch up."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bu7tm,Aniline_Selenic,2,Thu Jul 2 12:17:08 2015 UTC,The only reason why I mention shortening the months is because it seems that both the streamers and some of the viewers get burnt out and or bored.
TheRealmOfMianite,3bu7tm,Hidoni,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:37:11 2015 UTC,"It would also allow the suggestion of some days story some days regular mianite to be a thing, and with there beings set stream days they could scheduele all story days ahead."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bu7tm,Hasteur,2,Thu Jul 2 09:40:08 2015 UTC,"I agree that having scheduled ""story progression"" days would benefit the group (and the behind the scenes string pullers) to know when they needed to bring the A game versus when they could afford to be offline/grinding a mod (Sonya's Thaumcraft, Tucker's BloodMagic Demonvillage, Sparkles' AE/Spectre, Wag's ArsMagica, etc.)/building/exploring without feeling like they're holding up the season's storyline."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bu7tm,creeperkiller99,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:44:52 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure people have probably said this but all of the streamers have VODs if you need to catch up. Jordan has created a second channel for Mianite/ Live streaming stuff and he cuts up the video to important parts of it. But you can pretty much skip the grindy streams/vods because it is mostly them working on their mods. Most of the streamers aren't usually there all 7 days of the week (ex. Jordan has fortress fury meetings, Tom wasn't there because of family issues, Tucker goes to Canada sometimes etc.)"
TheRealmOfMianite,3bu7tm,Deadaghram,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:12:13 2015 UTC,"I know that a person can watch the VOD that doesn't change that it can be hard/annoying to try to keep up.

TheRealmOfMianite,3bt1iq,Evilness42,5,Thu Jul 2 00:12:34 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it was just a glitch with Tinkers Construct or something that caused the letter F to be added on. The same thing happened with fIanite's Rapier.
TheRealmOfMianite,3bt1iq,Rosemadary,3,Thu Jul 2 00:58:58 2015 UTC,I think it's the soulbinding that adds the f to names. Note entirely sure tho.
TheRealmOfMianite,3bt1iq,ChiraChan,3,Thu Jul 2 00:57:02 2015 UTC,It happens on my server too. I repaired a named item and the colored text dropped and was replaced with 5[NAME]. I think it's a bug.
TheRealmOfMianite,3bt1iq,A16BitHero,3,Thu Jul 2 01:27:16 2015 UTC,"Soul-bound items, when they get ""dropped"", are replaced by a new bow with the same stats and a gliched out name.  It has happened in my server as well and the only way to fix it is make a new, nonsoul bound, item"
TheRealmOfMianite,3bt1iq,StaticShockMkII,2,Thu Jul 2 02:35:23 2015 UTC,It can be fixed by renaming the item in an anvil. I've done it before.
TheRealmOfMianite,3bt1iq,ShinF,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:19:16 2015 UTC,"That's odd because for me it just redid the stupid name glitch when I equipped the weapon again, I guess it got slightly fixed."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bt1iq,StaticShockMkII,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:51:00 2015 UTC,I think the soulbound enchant did this to the bow.
TheRealmOfMianite,3bt1iq,BrahamLincoln,4,Sat Jul 4 08:58:09 2015 UTC,"I hope not. I hope they balance every weapon/armor in the new season so Purges can be made without worrying to much about OP stuff. Aside Purges, I would like to see more kinda of dungeons, and boss fight, and there, some more fancy weapons doing more damage and armor, so it can be a little bit more easy some battles (the boss from botania? XD) ;) aside that, everything well balanced."

TheRealmOfMianite,3bt1iq,Ryan814,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:01:24 2015 UTC,Would be fun that when S3 starts Jordan spawns with a normal bow called the fBow of Balance. With as reason that it changed into a normal bow cause the forces at work while traveling through the void.
TheRealmOfMianite,3bqw8q,creeperkiller99,2,Wed Jul 1 12:39:17 2015 UTC,"It could get boring quite easily though if something like that happens. I think one season was long enough in that world, and we would quickly get bored of seeing that world again. Something new and crazy awesome needs to happen in season 3 (if there will be a season 3)"
TheRealmOfMianite,3bqw8q,Torrotella,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:00:13 2015 UTC,Not much to discuss. They went through the portal to Gaines' world.
TheRealmOfMianite,3bqw8q,BearPawsOG,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:23:39 2015 UTC,"I mean there is some because you still have Jordan, Sonja, and Tucker's counterparts in the original world. The storyline might incorporate them next season so that is why people are discussing this. Also didn't remember Gaines saying they were going to his world because the portal would just take them out that world that was falling apart."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bqw8q,BearPawsOG,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:15:36 2015 UTC,"Gaines said nothing but remember Mianite's last message to him? He left portal key to Gaines so he can go back home. Also Chimalus' tumblr blog (he mentions that in one of the posts can't really remember which one). About your last point, let's get real, there's no way in hell that streamers will play their alter characters in the next season."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bqw8q,BearPawsOG,2,Thu Jul 2 09:30:00 2015 UTC,"No not the streamers playing the alternate characters, they will most likely be NPCs. What I'm saying is that the streamers and their alter egos need to meet up because it was being hyped in the last season. So what if Gaines' world was the original seed of the S1 world but not really the same as the heroes left it. That would make for an interesting plot maybe? What I'm trying to say is that it is possible they might not make Gaines' world another new world."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bqw8q,BearPawsOG,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:20:33 2015 UTC,"It might happen. For all we know Gaines' world could be the S1 world, why not."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bqw8q,Gearshift852,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:30:58 2015 UTC,"And while it might happen, I really hope they won't go that path. Adventurers need new worlds and new wonders and new adventures."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bqw8q,Bananagram31,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:54:46 2015 UTC,It might happen in the end it is up to the story creators and the behind the scenes people to do what they need to for the series and I'll watch this series no matter what.
TheRealmOfMianite,3bqw8q,blastdragon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:59:17 2015 UTC,"I would like them to return to the season one world, as only Tom and Tucker were there when the seed was just new. It was a very good seed, and I think it would be cool for them to just return to the world before everything was built. Maybe add some mods like the dinosaur one people have been talking about (probably because I'm a huge Jurassic Park fan) and a couple of mods which aren't game changing like we had in this season."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bqw8q,Bananagram31,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:21:38 2015 UTC,"What if Gaines' world is Season 1, but in the future? I mean, we don't know how Gaines got sent to Ruxomar, so maybe his way was different. I mean like, there is a difference between getting sucked into the void versus jumping into it."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bqw8q,blastdragon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:13:16 2015 UTC,"Sounds logical, that Gaines is from the future. Looking how much he knew about advanced machinery it's not that strange that Gaines is original from a world that's much more advanced than Ruxomar or S1-world.  But I if they return to to S1-world (even in the future) I hope there are places still recognizable or taken over. Tucker's and Sonja's castle can be build into a city, Jordan's tree fell down and destroyed Mianite's Temple and the ship in a bottle and the CapSizeXSparklez-church could be still in use."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bqw8q,nicnic228,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:35:36 2015 UTC,"I like you're idea, except the tree part. I mean, he's already lost the Fortress of Fury and Casa de Sparklez. Losing his tree would be an insult to injury."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bqw8q,miaday,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:14:32 2015 UTC,"But I would like if everybody would start again from scratch. Sonja's and Tucker's castle has been taken over (and can't be used anymore) and Tom's houses both are in ruins cause time took it's toll...  Also it would be feel more like a new season if every-streamer has to start from the beginning. And if Jordan wants he can make his house inside the trunk of the fallen tree, or the in the forest that grew around Jerry's tree..."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bqw8q,miaday,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:21:01 2015 UTC,Does anyone know where Diviser_Ganes is from because my thought was that Mianite Gave Diviser the key to his home.  And the sky people went with him.

TheRealmOfMianite,3bqw8q,BearPawsOG,3,Wed Jul 1 14:29:32 2015 UTC,Dude I have seen your comments on literally every single post and it has really been nothing but pointing out the negative parts of Mianite. This is just a game with an updated story line which is interactive. The behind the scenes people/story creators are doing their best on creating an awesome series. If you really are looking only looking at the negatives on this series (Not saying you are) you shouldn't watch it. In the end this nothing but friends going together on Minecraft to mess around with each other.
TheRealmOfMianite,3bqw8q,miaday,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:28:54 2015 UTC,that comment was a joke though?

I feel like ""make Mianite a reality show"" was fairly sarcastic/stupid enough it's obviously a joke. Saying it should be in the real world isn't really a negative part of Mianite so idk why this joke of a comment was confused with another one of my rants.

I also think he could pull of being a mischievous god that people during s1 believed he was originally (I do not have proof of this claim, just remembering the subreddit of old).  Though I do think Tom would prefer the Dianite who intimidates and clearly represents... non-good-ness.... yah... that word.  Of course, it is a question of how to get that Dianite back. I don't think people would like it if S3 was about reviving a god again. And people would definitely critique S1 Dianite just popping back up."

TheRealmOfMianite,3bp4o4,creeperkiller99,4,Wed Jul 1 00:34:25 2015 UTC,"Warning for that idea: It is believed that, at least if what Tucker said is true, they would have become bored with vanilla too quickly. However, the option is not completely out since they have had a season-break from vanilla. Tom has doubted mods that are too grindy, so he may push for less grindy mods (which may conflict with Sonja who, apparently, loves to grind). Jordan and Wag seem to be just along for the ride when it comes to mods (they may push for light modding at the least-- I can't really find any quotes on their opinions).   When it comes to returning players, it all depends if they want to return. I am not sure about the modesteps and H3x, but people say that Nade is on leave from pro-COD. They are usually cautious to add new people, as we saw from both seasons 1 and 2 and this feeling may remain in season 3."

Tucker did mention that during s1 they felt like there was nothing left after 30+ episodes in while in s2 it took them 100 episodes to feel the same. Maybe modding lightly would be the better idea or maybe have an original modpack for themselves.  Story-wise, I hope Ianite become the villain now. Dianite was the villain in s1 and Mianite in s2. I don't expect any of the NPC's to be there with them (with the exception of the gods, of course) since, you know, multiple worlds and stuff (maybe something like DG's portal was faulty which caused the streamers to be in another place. idk :|)"

I was sort of wondering that if you guys are good at command blocks, maybe you could possibly make a Mianite mod, not a Modpack. I also agree by your opinion that mods with super weapons and armors should not be added, including mods like Thaumcraft, Blood Magic, and Ars Magica 2, too. Witchery and Botania seems to be the only mods that do not have really OP stuff (in fact, they have content which is acceptable), albeit bosses are a pain. Mods adding new biomes, structures, animals and plants, dimensions like Erebus mod and Atum mod and aesthetics like Carpenter's Blocks mods and Bibliography mod are great, too."

TheRealmOfMianite,3bnsm0,Gearshift852,3,Tue Jun 30 19:12:56 2015 UTC,All verified flairs (except for streamers) have been removed until we know who will be helping out in Season 3.

TheRealmOfMianite,3bnsm0,Gearshift852,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:26:53 2015 UTC,I remove that earlier today.  Where is it exactly? Maybe I missed a page.

TheRealmOfMianite,3bnsm0,Hasteur,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:09:18 2015 UTC,"Wait, why did Mianite want to kill them? And why did he help them escape if he did?"
TheRealmOfMianite,3bnsm0,MrMadSpy,3,Tue Jun 30 19:04:57 2015 UTC,"Um... it's even more deep than that.   Dianite was being raised The machine was running out of quintessence Farmer Steve (s01) appeared to sacrifice himself so that Dianite would be raised ** Waglington is Farmer Steve in this alternate reality Dianite was raised Tucker started going beserk and was out of control and started attacking everyone ** Tucker signed a contract with Mianite Tucker regained control of himself Jordan lost control and started attacking people ** Jordan was negotiating a contract with Mianite to revive Ianite (not sure if the contract was executed) Everyone started giving Mianite the evil eye because he was doing some evil things (and Dianite's domain) World Historian (AKA The Shadows from Season 1) dropped out of Mianite and claimed that Tucker and Jordan executed contracts with him because he was controlling Mianite World Historian took the Kikoku (as it's named after him) and started PKing the Heroes/NPCs/Mianite. Ianite from teh shadows told Jordan to use the fBow of awesome Jordan killed World Historian's current body The world started disinigrating. DeviserGaines appeared on scene to offer all a way out of the collapsing world Everybody went through the portal Jordan got the ""Inception Meta book"" from Ianite Everybody went back to Reactor where the giant portal they emerged from is Mianite agreed to try and guide everyone back to Ruxomar (Season 1) Season 1 people inviting Season 2 people (waglington, Mot, Martha, etc) to come back with them Everyone jumped into the abyss portal.   FIN"

TheRealmOfMianite,3bnsm0,Hasteur,2,Tue Jun 30 20:27:24 2015 UTC,"And this is why I'm only a newbie... I think I started tracking (from Sparles viewpoint) the day Ianite discorporated.  I understood the connection between the two, but I'm making my way through S1 right now (On S1E13 ""Tom has gone insane"" currently) to understand the back history."
TheRealmOfMianite,3bnsm0,FangSnake24,2,Tue Jun 30 23:31:05 2015 UTC,Wasn't the original world called Mianite?
