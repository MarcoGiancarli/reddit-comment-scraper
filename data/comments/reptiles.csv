reptiles,3e0yfr,GregR32,2,Tue Jul 21 02:54:39 2015 UTC,"My personal opinion - it depends on monitor's age. From hatchling to juvenile I prefer to feed a monitor with dusted invertebrates with occasional properly sized rodent once a week. Another staple food items I use are: fish(should contain no thiaminase, so true silversides, salmon, trout), shrimp/krill/crab/crayfish(preferably  whole/raw), occasional quail egg, various mollusks if your monitor accepts them(snails, various clams, squid).  So I will feed inverts to my monitor for as long as she bothers hunting them, hopefully she will start eating large adult dubias. After that my staple will still be  fish, shrimp, crabs, crayfish, mollusks, quail eggs and only then once a week properly sized rodent.   TL;DR - variety is good, no variety is bad.   Disclaimer: all of this is my personal opinion and should not be taken as absolute knowledge."
reptiles,3e0yfr,arcticrobot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:20:14 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you on this.  Variety is the key, and age and size are key factors for these guys.  I can't even begin to fathom trying to sustain a large Nile or water monitor on just insects.  We feed our Ackie fuzzy mice, supers, crickets, dubia, chicken organs, goat kidney (once), occasional bites of grain-free dog food, fish, snails, and other occasional random food items.    He is, however, incredibly fastidious - he does not like to get gooey or messy things on his face.  Every food item is a balance between how good it smells and how messy it looks.  He really wants chicken livers, but the minute it even grazes his face, he refuses to try to eat it any further.  However, chicken hearts are firmer, and he absolute adores them. It's really fascinating to watch him weigh his desire for the food against the amount of mess it's going to make."
reptiles,3e0yfr,merlyn923,2,Tue Jul 21 05:28:02 2015 UTC,Have you tried quail eggs? Just wondering what results may be with his preferences. I open the egg from one side and my monitor dives full head right in getting messy up to her eyes. I have to give her showers afterwards)
reptiles,3e0yfr,arcticrobot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:41:52 2015 UTC,"The benefit of monitors is that most species get large enough to eat whole animal prey, I don't think you will find any keeper that would have a discussion of rodent v. Insect, as these two guys have said, you get to diversify their diet very easily, to limit it is not intelligent."
reptiles,3e0yfr,accreditednobody,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:31:21 2015 UTC,This is what I mean. For smaller monitors like an Ackie or Timor insects aren't an issue but for like a full grown savannah or Nile its much easier to obtain rodents as a whole food as opposed to feeding parts of an animal. Is there anything wrong with feeding one food appropriately?
reptiles,3e0upm,MkU1TR4,2,Tue Jul 21 02:22:24 2015 UTC,"I've found it really hard to find good, non-anecdotal information on impaction in general. I just sent through an impaction problem with a gecko and still have no idea wtf caused it, aside from possible underhydration.  IMO, something with the consistency of dirt that doesn't expand when wet probably won't impact a healthy reptile. But this isn't based on real data and I wish it were."

Unfortunately, they have a kink in their digestive tracts when young, and have a tendency to taste and eat everything they can.  Monitors like yours are much more intelligent, and have a longer, less sticky tongue.  They won't eat substrate if they can help it - they will spit it out and clean their faces.  Beardies, on the other hand, will swallow a mouthful of substrate if it means they get their favorite roach or cricket."
