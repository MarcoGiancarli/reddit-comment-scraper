FortWorth,3e103l,Idontwashmyjeans,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:08:32 2015 UTC,"Just curious, what kind of kayak do you have? Been really wanting to get one, but I don't know the first thing about picking one out. Any advice?"
FortWorth,3e103l,tamumike3,3,Tue Jul 21 13:32:20 2015 UTC,"You know I have several. One is a cheaper kayak, around 10 foot pelican. If you're looking for something cheaper and easier you can probably pick one up for a couple hundred bucks on Craigslist. They're not the best boats ever, and aren't meant for white water, but if you just want to cruise they'll do.  The one I took this picture from is a 6 foot white water flip stick. It's a great boat, but it's really for surfing, and white water. It's not the greatest to go up stream in by any means. But if you want to do only downstream it works. It's also super light and fits in my jeep, so I love it. Again, Craigslist is good for these, but white water boats are usually in the $500 range, and are built nicer for different things.   You may want to take $30 or so to Panther island pavilion and rent one of the kayaks, to see if you like them. I say this because at the end of the season they actually auction off most of there boats. The employee I spoke with the other said from 2-600$ usually. So that's a pretty good option too.  Craigslist is entirely your friend here. I have limited experience, but let me know if you have any other questions!"

FortWorth,3dzki4,SenorAnonymous,4,Mon Jul 20 21:50:29 2015 UTC,"I work for a construction company and a couple of years ago was sent to the courthouse for a bid meeting on the courthouse west side entrance renovation. One portion of the project contract that was mentioned was investigation in to subsidence that was occurring the NW corner of the courthouse. The notes they gave us was that they thought the sinking was possibly being caused by a leak or partial collapse of a 1800's era tunnel that used to to go from the courthouse to the jail for transporting criminals between the 2. They noted that the courthouse side was blocked, and the jail end was long since filled in, but the tunnel between the 2 was never touched (because of the transition from city to county land).  I wish the company i worked for had won the contract because i would of loved to see that."
FortWorth,3dzki4,Paradox1989,3,Tue Jul 21 00:01:18 2015 UTC,I believe there is one that runs from Panther Pavilion to somewhere downtown.  I'm sure it's been walled up for a while though
FortWorth,3dzki4,zscuro,5,Tue Jul 21 00:56:38 2015 UTC,Yep. It was for an underground type tunnel to the Tandy Center. I loved taking that as a kid.

You can walk down but it's not to interesting, and someone might ask what you are up to but doubt they'd care.  Burnett Plaza has a decent sized system the public can access during office hours. There's some business down there.   Several smaller ones all around, connecting government buildings, garages, etc. There's one from McDavid Studio to Bass hall.   Probably the biggest in operation is one under the jails, which connects the courts buildings to the police stations and everything. I've been down there and it seemed massive.   Tandy Subway of course. Now locked up good.   There's a tunnel from the TRE parking lot to the T&P station.   Probably some really big systems for moving steam or rainwater, etc. You can look down in between the grooves in some places and they are huge."
FortWorth,3dzeos,tammyetter,9,Mon Jul 20 19:45:18 2015 UTC,I would say that riding the TRE would be the cheapest I'd you can get to it at one of the time that it runs. The south remote parking bus takes you to the dfw tre terminal

FortWorth,3dzeos,zscuro,4,Tue Jul 21 04:42:32 2015 UTC,"The TRE is $2.50 for a one way pass to Centerport (past it is another zone).   When you get off, take the yellow bus to long term parking south, and you can switch to whichever bus is going to your terminal.   It will take a while, FYI.  The yellow bus should be there when the train arrives but the long term parking terminal buses could be 10 or 15 minutes.  Alternately,  if you live anywhere by a hotrl, you can book a super shuttle for $17.  I live in downtown FW and whenever I fly back in to DFW on a Sunday, the TRE isn't running so I book the shuttle to the Omni and walk the last few blocks."
FortWorth,3dzeos,Aerodynamics,3,Mon Jul 20 21:06:24 2015 UTC,"Just curious, but are super shuttles cheaper if you book from or to a hotel? Booking online for a single person is ~$50 from south-west Fort Worth. I'm only about a 10 minute drive from downtown too."
FortWorth,3dzeos,zscuro,2,Mon Jul 20 22:38:03 2015 UTC,"For shared ride it's 40(?) to a home or 17 to a hotel, which is why I always book to the Omni and walk the last few blocks"

FortWorth,3dygvd,BalrogTheLunchbox,8,Mon Jul 20 15:47:16 2015 UTC,"Sounds illegal. She's a valid resident and the area doesn't have assigned parking. If it's marked as a spot and there's no signage to give notice otherwise, then she should have a solid case for calling the tow illegal.   Get pictures of the area she parked in, making sure to note all signage. Also measure the distance from the parking spot to the dumpster so you have that as possible evidence that she wasn't blocking the dumpster.  Then I'd go over your lease and apartment's policies to see if there's anything specific about parking listed in there.  If there's not, then you need to get hard with the apartment complex for their lack of signage/posted parking policy.  Regardless, pay the bill, get the car and get a receipt. If they're not willing to pay you for their mistake then you should look into small claims court and also look up renter's rights websites for more info on what you can do legally to force them to change.  Good luck!"

FortWorth,3do4fw,1whiteguy,3,Sat Jul 18 01:15:55 2015 UTC,"Well just at a federal level he would push for a massive increase in taxes on those that probably make over 200k a year. That amount would grow by income at a rate I'm not aware of, but he is all for the distribution of wealth. This would hurt Fort Worth particularly. We are lucky enough to have the Bass family put a ton of private funds directly into taking care of our city(also there are a lot of lesser known families that do the same). Not that their lifestyles would change because they are billionaires, but the amount they invest in the community would undoubtedly decrease. Also, whether you like it or not, our city thrives off of energy production, a ton of jobs are created directly and indirectly from this industry. He will be all for taking away the write offs that make it affordable to drill and operate, particularly for the smaller operations. People say ""oh these people make so much money why do they need the write offs?"" Well, without them, the small companies would be unable to operate at the chance of hitting a dry hole and breaking them. The larger companies would just lay off hundreds. Just a couple of points, but hey...that's just like my opinion man"
FortWorth,3do4fw,RollerRagerMD,7,Sat Jul 18 02:09:18 2015 UTC,"I'm always happy to hear the other side when it's argued eloquently. Echo chambers are dangerous.  My responses:  1) I'd like to think that Sanders would target the 1% of the 1% first and foremost. I believe he said something about bringing back the 90% top marginal tax rate. I don't think that ought to be applied to families earning $200K. In areas like San Francisco and NYC, that's not exactly the money that influences politics. Short of a change to the tax code that takes cost of living into account, I think this would only be effective on really, really, really high earners. Like the kind of people who could part with $10,000,000 and not bat an eye.   2) This is true. But, perhaps, a lot of the people affected by such layoffs would find gainful employment in things like public infrastructure improvement programs. Not sure.  I don't think Sanders is a flawless hero, but I think his kind of attitude is what we need in America. In a perfect world, the richest of the rich would not be dragged kicking and screaming but instead be eager to support helping their fellow countryman."
FortWorth,3do4fw,1whiteguy,3,Sat Jul 18 02:33:23 2015 UTC,"I understand your point, but look at what the government does with our money. I don't care who is in control, republicans or democrats, they both spend the peoples money like its monopoly money. I will say I am all for the infrastructure needing work. My stance is firmly that I believe in the ability of the private sector and that it inspires innovation and growth. Are there snakes in the government and private sector? Yes, I just feel there are more snakes in DC."
FortWorth,3do4fw,RollerRagerMD,10,Sat Jul 18 02:43:58 2015 UTC,"I agree that spending is outrageous in Washington, but I think it is primarily on the wrong things. The government is in the envious position of 1) having a steady income base (taxes) and 2) having a low risk of investors fleeing (bonds are trustworthy)  Let me put it this way: we were once the country that invested heavily in things like the interstate highway system and going to the moon. Have we done anything with the moon? Not really, but that's the kind of attitude I want to see. I want our government to spend on things that enrich the American people and the world rather than on mismanaged programs and endless wars.  The private sector can certainly be effective, but I don't think it works in all cases. Highways can be funded by users through gas taxes. Healthcare? Shoot, that's an inelastic good if ever I've seen one. In so-called ""perfectly competitive"" markets (or at least as close as one can get), I'm all for the free market. On the opposite end, I think government intervention is necessary."
FortWorth,3do4fw,1whiteguy,-1,Sat Jul 18 02:51:40 2015 UTC,"I believe most liberals have their hearts in the right place, but the  faith they have in what the believe the government will do and what they actually do is off. Obama came in with a great plan and similar views to Bernie Sanders, but look what politics has turned him into. What your saying is great, exploration and investing in the greater good of the people would be great. But all I believe will happen is the left will continue to purchase votes by keeping people in welfare and  then blaming the right for their downfalls. I will say I am in the energy sector so I do have skin in the game when it comes to what side I am for. I do, however, have a perfect and truthful example of what I am saying. Someone very close to me runs a business, he on multiple occasions has had promotions turned down because their case workers told them that it would take away from the government funding they received and ultimately give them a slightly lower income. Now, these people will never make it to step three because they are being urged not to take step two. This infuriates me because the government is literally urging people to stay at a poverty level."
FortWorth,3do4fw,RollerRagerMD,6,Sat Jul 18 03:03:30 2015 UTC,"Crap, I think I hit ""cancel"" instead of ""post.""  I think a lot of what has to happen is a change in the public conscience. Whether a leftist or rightist, I want more Americans to be sympathetic to the plight of their fellow man. Rather than wanting everything for themselves, I want people to think about how we can make this country a place where every decent person can live without worrying about how to pay for healthcare or food or shelter.   I hope for more people like yourself and myself, who have the interests of the common man in mind rather than special interests. I don't know what the correct answer is to our problems, but I do think that the status quo is not that answer."
FortWorth,3do4fw,StoneyThrashez,5,Sat Jul 18 03:18:23 2015 UTC,I like both of yalls viewpoints but I do like his better. Completely understand that we should lend a hand to the common man but there are going to be those who would pull you in the water just to get themselves out. We shouldnt lose empathy but we shouldnt keep getting walked over.
FortWorth,3do4fw,HooDooOperator,2,Sat Jul 18 19:06:00 2015 UTC,"So,  I don't know much about Bernie Sanders.  Where does he fall on Marijuana legalization,  abortion,  foreign policy, health care?"
FortWorth,3do4fw,RollerRagerMD,4,Sat Jul 18 02:18:18 2015 UTC,"Give this web page a look:  http://www.ontheissues.org/Bernie_Sanders.htm  Abortion: seems largely supportive  Marijuana: voted to exempt industrial hemp from federal drug laws, voted no on random drug tests for federal employees  Foreign policy: from votes and public statements, he seems less hawkish than the average American, although he has expressed support for Israel in the past. At his kickoff speech he said that the ISIS problem should be primarily addressed by a coalition of nations in the Middle East.  Health care: absolutely supports a single payer system.  Give that page a look, as well as his campaign site."

FortWorth,3dmtvv,illchopyourfaceoff,6,Fri Jul 17 15:31:42 2015 UTC,"This is one the best resources for Texans that most Texans don't know about http://www.powertochoose.org/.  It divides providers up via line maintainers (ONCOR, etc).  I only pay 8.1 cents a kilowatt and have paid as low as 6.9 cents.  Know that there's a difference between who owns the lines and who owns your account.  The prices are seasonal as well so if you can you should shop for power in the winter when demand is low and string up a long term contract.  Shop it around!  I currently have Infinite Energy and love them.  Make sure you get good at reading the power sheets.  If you never call your billing company then you can be less finicky. I've never had a problem with any provider I have had."
FortWorth,3dmtvv,trashk,2,Fri Jul 17 16:09:48 2015 UTC,"Great site. I do a one year contract with the lowest priced company and usually go back to this site and choose another at the end of that year. I have been thinking about switching to Green Mountain energy recently, because I would like to support a renewable energy source. I have reliant right now and it's pretty cheap. Startex before that but they tried to hike my rates up at the end of the year so I changed services."

The smaller companies have much better customer service and really fight to keep you as a customer.
FortWorth,3dmtvv,trashk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:15:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's still available but I have a 1 year plan with Reliant right now that is as follows:  1) $5 base charge every month; 2) 1.2 cents per kWh for the first 1000 kWh; 3) 8.4ish cents per kWh after 1000 kWh.  I haven't made it over 1000 kWh for a billing cycle so my bills have been really low so far, so you might check  Reliant's website. Not sure if I will be able to keep it under 1000 kWh in July and August, but it's a great deal. Bill has been between under $60 every month so far. No matter who you choose, be sure and check closely to see if there is a set monthly charge each month, a penalty charge if you don't meet a minimum wag month, and different charges per kWh spending on how much you use. Even with the electricity facts label, there are still ways the electric companies can trick you if your not paying attention."
