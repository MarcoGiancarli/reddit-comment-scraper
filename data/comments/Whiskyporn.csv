Whiskyporn,3e3xqi,XPostLinker,3,Tue Jul 21 19:44:09 2015 UTC,"Saw this when posted on FB. I wish /u/hanshound would let us know what the price was. I know he said he ""got a deal"" but this type of thing is so unique it would be nice to know even to give him props for making a good deal."
Whiskyporn,3e3xqi,tintin777,3,Wed Jul 22 00:15:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, looking at his submissions though, he seems pretty well off so his idea of a deal could draw scrutiny from those with less. Probably a smart move."
Whiskyporn,3e3xqi,hanshound,3,Wed Jul 22 00:24:13 2015 UTC,I rarely see anyone posting what they pay for bottles. I made a good deal but the specifics are my business. I shared pictures of the set because I hadn't seen content like this before and I think it's an amazing piece of history.
Whiskyporn,3e3xqi,tintin777,4,Wed Jul 22 00:48:23 2015 UTC,People post what they pay for bottles on the whisky subs all the time so it isn't uncommon at all. It is so common that Canadians and Europeans often bemoan the prices they see. It is your business so by all means do as you will. I think it is an amazing buy and interesting as all hell. But there is also no harm in sharing information and no one around these subs will torch you for any price you pay unless you punched someone's grandma.
Whiskyporn,3e3xqi,hanshound,2,Wed Jul 22 01:21:20 2015 UTC,"No one got punched! I just didn't expect so many people to be looking at it/me, and since some transactions between individuals involving liquor are technically illegally (and I'm not saying this one was), I didn't see any benefit to broadcasting the specific terms of the deal."

Surprisingly enough that was the easiest one to get because it was slightly before all the madness (those were the days). So the 23 is a 2011, the 20 and 12 are 2013s and the 15 and 10 are from this last fall release. All purchased at retail for MSRP.

Whiskyporn,3du7bu,texacer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:24:08 2015 UTC,hasnt it been the same exact Rye for years?  I heard its all in a big metal vat.
Whiskyporn,3du7bu,ShooterFlatch,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:26:16 2015 UTC,Depends on who you get the answer from. Yes on the vat and probably yes on the mix of Medley and Cream of KY ryes in the tank. But it's either all still tanked or it's tanked plus BT rye blended in(a blend of straights is still straight). The smart money is on blended BT as they transition to all BT soon. And a lot of folks I trust say it's not the same as it was a couple of years ago. So either the blend story is true or oxidation in the tank is to blame.
Whiskyporn,3du7bu,texacer,4,Sun Jul 19 20:32:53 2015 UTC,I havent investigated it because I find Rittenhouse and Sazzy to be pretty  much the same as the VW.   Good but mostly boring.

I'm always more intrigued by what IB's can do to average spirit rather than bottling already good spirit like Octomore. Things like cask strength NCF Dalmore or Balvenie or Hakushu are always worth exploring imo, whereas pricey IB's of things like Octomore or Springbank where the base spirit is already so good seems a bit harder to swallow. That sounds kinda contradictory as I just got this OC1... Hmm"

Whiskyporn,3dsqmn,PreyMonkie,2,Sun Jul 19 10:28:20 2015 UTC,"My top suggestion would be Octomore 6.1, you should be able to find a bottle for $150-$180.  Ardbeg Corryvreckan and Uigeadail are both pretty amazing.  If he hasn't tried it Lagavulin 12 is something every Lagavulin fan should try.  Laphroaig 18 is always nice to have, and something a little different he might appreciate is Talisker 18."
Whiskyporn,3dsqmn,KTRyan30,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:21:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, Octomore! Comes in a cool tin that would make a great gift as well..."
Whiskyporn,3dsqmn,nonmagnetic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:30:02 2015 UTC,Cool tin and an awesome bottle! Though you never know how much is left...
Whiskyporn,3dsqmn,KTRyan30,0,Sun Jul 19 23:12:41 2015 UTC,You don't have to dilute any scotches with water.  Ardbeg Corryvreckan is pretty good.  Without cost restrictions grab him a Port Ellen.  Check auction sites.
Whiskyporn,3doymk,KTRyan30,2,Sat Jul 18 01:46:15 2015 UTC,Damn! Is PC7 really that good?!? I know the 2013 Cairdeas is.
Whiskyporn,3doymk,jrsheppa,2,Sat Jul 18 05:55:23 2015 UTC,PC 7 is pretty damn amazing and I got it at a rock bottom price. This is a situation where I'm hoping to sell two bottles down the road and pretty much break even on my purchase. Even if I don't though I'm never going to regret having an extra two bottlers of PC7 around.

Whiskyporn,3doymk,texacer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:47:52 2015 UTC,"Complicated question. In general it's amazing. However it's not 'EVERYTHING' I hoped it would be. I was hoping for a Bruichladdich version of 1401 and it falls short of that benchmark on the body and mouthfeel categories. Now while saying that it's not thin, watery, or overly spirity, its just not that wonderful, syrupy mouth coating goodness of 1401. That is it's only shortcoming, I would rate it one point less than 1401 and I think 1401 is 100/100."

Octomore 6.2 is impossible to get a hold on, but would've costed 200 USD.   I buy most of them abroad, or in the airport taxfree. (I am only allowed to bring 1l at the time...)"

Whiskyporn,3dg3ln,tintin777,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:19:52 2015 UTC,"Congrats. It looks like a fun piece. I will frame it in trade for reasonable amounts of booze. Framing is one of my few real-world sellable skills I have. Whoever frames it, don't let them talk you into ""dry-mounting"" it. Unless you don't give a shit about what happens to it in 20 years. And then, by all means, do whatever you want to it. Frame it with a cheesey gold foil mat!"

Whiskyporn,3dc4tw,ShooterFlatch,2,Wed Jul 15 02:59:12 2015 UTC,These were sampled tonight. The Gift Shop 17 yr OBSV was the easy winner. The 100th was excellent and also 17 yr OBSV but higher proof. The GS was much more laid back and well rounded in comparison.
Whiskyporn,3dc4tw,HD335,2,Wed Jul 15 03:01:24 2015 UTC,"I usually am not jealous of many tastings, but you are an a-hole for this experience.

Whiskyporn,3dc4tw,mfpark,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:14:21 2015 UTC,At least many on here got to taste it as the backbone of the '12 and '13 Small Batch LE's. Not the same as solo but you still get the idea.
Whiskyporn,3dc4tw,mfpark,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:33:42 2015 UTC,Did you prefer it solo or in those SmB bottlings?
Whiskyporn,3dc4tw,SalvithorTheSecond,2,Thu Jul 16 01:32:09 2015 UTC,"Well I have to say solo. But the SmB LEs are a different animal altogether. Just to have a barrel proof single barrel with all of the nuance and layers of flavor that the 17 has is truly awesome. Just consider your favorite PS bottle and imagine adding 5-8 more years in the barrel. The flavors and aromas just come at you in waves and there is depth and a chewiness. I need to revisit it without other bottles around to distract me(and we had a few others besides the Roses). If you are a FR fanboy, then you need to sacrifice a Pappy gift card and get a bottle on Swap if they are available."

Whiskyporn,3d1vv2,ThePiousPriest,-5,Sun Jul 12 21:15:03 2015 UTC,"Pretty pedestrian common collection of scotch, but seems to have the most commonly asked for malts.  Those Macallan Fine Oak bottles are a waste of space, though, and they don't even have Macallan 18yr for the ""high-rollers,"" just JW Blue (which plenty of people would poo-poo for not being a single malt).  I assume they have Johnnie Walker Black 12yr somewhere too."
Whiskyporn,3d1vv2,quercus_robur,7,Sun Jul 12 22:57:48 2015 UTC,The douchebaggery positively oozes out of your words...
Whiskyporn,3d1vv2,Suck_It_Trebek,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:14:18 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't mean any snobbery.  Just that their scotch selection is much poorer than their bourbon selection, which may just be a reflection of either the local market or what that bar is going for.  You're on a whisky enthusiast's subreddit--I'm allowed to point out that that selection of scotch is common (for a whisky bar, but not necessarily a hotel).  It seems to be calculated to have the most common single malts on hand, which likely makes great business sense for a Marriott.  However, if someone with experience is looking to try something new, that's not the place they're going to find anything unusual.  If you're referring to my ""high-rollers"" statement, that's obviously tongue-in-cheek.  People who believe themselves to be high-rollers are looking for JW Blue or Macallan 18yr, and I assume a hotel catering to traveling businessmen would do good to have those on hand.  Those are probably the two most common ""luxury"" scotch whiskies.  However most whisky enthusiasts would not pay the asking price for either.  I wouldn't, and I don't subscribe to the douche-baggery those people might subscribe to.  Lastly, I assume they do have Johnnie Walker Black 12yr.  It's a great bottle that almost everyone carries.  At $25/bottle, that's about the least snobby thing I could say.  Perhaps you're not a scotch drinker?  Nothing I said in my original post about that scotch selection was that surprising or non-obvious."
Whiskyporn,3d1vv2,quercus_robur,3,Mon Jul 13 04:33:04 2015 UTC,"I completely missed this post/thread.  Now that I'm seeing it I think I can explain the douchebaggery comment.    Some people absolutely LOVE Balvenie or really any of the ones they have stocked here.  They're more commonly available, sure, but the word ""pedestrian"" implies that the whiskies on display exist for the inexperienced or the ""lowly beginners.""  That there is somehow a tiered scotch experience where one would ascend beyond the whiskies here.  That really isn't the attitude most people here take towards scotch or whiskies because shitting on what people enjoy is a dick move.    You may have only meant to apply pedestrian to this bar but there are people subbed here that would kill for this collection.    Just thought I'd clarify."
Whiskyporn,3d1vv2,slanderousu,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:21:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  Those are pretty common single malts.  That they're common is a testament to their quality (and marketing budgets).  I continue to drink those same malts, and recommend Balvenie often (maybe too often for other readers of my comments).  But that doesn't make 15 mostly sub-$80 malts on the shelf of a whisky bar an exciting collection.  Google defines ""pedestrian"" as ""lacking inspiration or excitement; dull.""  Perhaps exciting is not what you want at a hotel bar--you want them to have your favorite malt.  So, like I said, it makes perfect business sense to stock the most popular single malts.  But most popular also means more people have had them before.    I know you know this."
Whiskyporn,3d1vv2,quercus_robur,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:44:30 2015 UTC,"I'm aware that this bar isn't super exciting for us and ""not exciting"" might be easier understood than the word ""pedestrian"" which seems to have some connotations attached to it.    Further on this, why even tell this guy that the collection isn't exciting?  He might think it is and, for him, it might be.  After all he took the time to picture and post it."
Whiskyporn,3d1vv2,slanderousu,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:51:37 2015 UTC,"True.    Commenting on a hotel's whisky selection shouldn't be taken as an insult of OP--sounds like OP drinks more bourbon, and the hotel does have a good bourbon collection.  Scotch seems to be slightly weaker, and perhaps that's a reflection of the local market.  Nothing wrong with that.  It is only a Marriott, after all.  On a relative scale, it seems like a great Marriott selection, of course.  But it doesn't hold up to a real whisky bar.  Just commenting on the photo because it was posted for whisky enthusiasts to comment on.  That we're all at different stages of interest and experience is fine.  Anyone is welcome to post a counterpoint, and I'm not usually elitist about whiskey.  I changed it to ""common""."

Whiskyporn,3d2mgc,mfpark,2,Mon Jul 13 10:14:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not worried about an overall bourbon bubble or glut. It's a growing product with younger Americans, and emerging world markets and their aspirational middle classes are increasingly seeing bourbon as a quality, complimentary good to scotch. The existing Kentucky distilleries and their start up competitors should be able to go full throttle and sell their whiskey for decades to come.   But the super premium and LE offerings? That's definitely a glut/bubble waiting to happen."

Besides, the temperature is the same on both sides of the spiral, unlike in a barrel.  Diffusion is plenty of molecular movement to extract what's in such a tiny spiral.    Of course this still won't make any of it taste like properly aged whiskey.  It's just a high ratio of wood char to a relatively small volume of alcohol that makes it look so dark."

I was genuinely shocked at how much char was peeled off in just 24 hours.     Even though the temperature is the same on both sides, won't a swing affect the rate of molecular exchange just like any other agitation? Not that it's necessary, in this case, but none the less."

Not that it's necessary, in this case, but none the less.   Not the temperature swing.  Certainly temperature does affect the molecular movement, and you would just want it to be as high as possible to maximize diffusion.  But even in barrels, very little is happening in the winter.  So in your case, there is no need for the low temperature portion."

Whiskyporn,3clzgd,amadeusemanu,2,Wed Jul 8 23:10:55 2015 UTC,"So I have tried both the Hibiki and the Yamazaki. Personally I prefer the Hibiki more because it has a frest taste to it. But I guess that's what you get with a blended scotch.  But the Yamazaki is a purist's dream. It's smooth and almost evaporates when you cover your tongue with a thin layer. It's smell is fantastic. The subtle whiff of honey is amazing, but the flavor is most definitely still whisky. The honey doesn't really come through much in the taste."

Whiskyporn,3ck65d,SeienShin,-1,Wed Jul 8 16:32:23 2015 UTC,The old Cooper's bottling is fucking amazing. If all their sherry casks taste like that I don't know why they'd add a single drop of water.

Whiskyporn,3cgmyc,slanderousu,4,Tue Jul 7 19:30:44 2015 UTC,"Saving you a quick google and wiki look-up, if you were wondering what TUN's, Pipes, and Hogsheads were, they're sizes of wine barrels - see photo.  Relevant because scotches (and other whiskies) are oft finished in wine barrels with these monikers."
Whiskyporn,3cgmyc,mfeds,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:32:37 2015 UTC,The tierce is roughly equivalent in size to a bourbon barrel?  ~53 gallons (US)
Whiskyporn,3cgmyc,quercus_robur,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:38:05 2015 UTC,The tierce seems to be about 10 gallons smaller than a bourbon barrel - Tierce = 42 Gallons.  Tun: 252 Gallons / 953.92 Liters  Pipe/Butt: 126 Gallons / 476.96 Liters  Puncheon: 84 Gallons / 317.97 Liters  Hogshead: 63 Gallons / 238.48 Liters  Tierce: 42 Gallons / 158.99 Liters  Barrel: 31.5 Gallons / 118.29 Liters  Rundlet: 18 Gallons / 68.14 Liters
Whiskyporn,3cgmyc,hosalabad,2,Tue Jul 7 20:04:07 2015 UTC,"Of course, some sizes make more sense in metric.  The standard bourbon barrel is 200L, which happens to equal about 53 gallons.  Also note from the wiki article that much of this isn't true anymore, especially not in European metric countries.  The English system is outdated.  From the wiki article:  ""The major wine producing countries use barrels extensively and have developed standards at variance with the traditional English volumes (e.g. a hogshead of 300 L or 66 imp gal or 79 US gal, a barrique of 220 L or 48 imp gal or 58 US gal (Bordeaux), 225 L or 49 imp gal or 59 US gal (Australia) of 230 L or 51 imp gal or 61 US gal (Burgundy) and a puncheon of 465 L or 102 imp gal or 123 US gal) are commonly used in the wine and wine cooperage industries.""  Since many of the wine barrels used for whisky aging are likely from Europe, I assume the metric sizes are more common now."
Whiskyporn,3cgmyc,belbivfreeordie,0,Tue Jul 7 21:45:44 2015 UTC,I'll see if I can update after I get home (I'll probably forget).  Once we get into the weeds of imperial gallons vs us gallons I get lost.

Whiskyporn,3c9oyr,BourbonScotchWhiskey,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:07:23 2015 UTC,Ill say. A bar I frequent in Austin has the 2014 ORVW for $25 a pour so you've got a steal there
Whiskyporn,3c9oyr,BourbonScotchWhiskey,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:09:13 2015 UTC,"Sounds high, but comparable to my market as a whole. I know of another bar with the exact same vintage you mention for about $20 a pour. Must be some residual birthday luck from the 1st."
Whiskyporn,3c9oyr,Ethanized,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:16:16 2015 UTC,"I felt it was high as well. You can get a bottle for $225 or so. At $25 per ounce that ends up with them getting $625 per a bottle of it when it retails for $40 but they get it less than that since its going to a bar and not a store front. So yeah, kinda jacked."

I've also got a Ruger 10-22 on hand for plinking.  My true treasures are of course sentimental because I inherited them from my Gramps, being a Marlin 65 .22, and a Winchester Model 12, 16 gauge.  The 16 gauge is a joy to shoot and I used it to clear groundhogs and other destructive vermin from my grandparents' farm during the summer.

Whiskyporn,3bmhkt,Scotch_Fanatic,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:37:44 2015 UTC,"I liked them all! The Peaty and Salty one was very Talisker-esque, and the Sherry and Sweet tasted just like a GlenDronach. The Woody and Vanilla was the most Japanesey of them, and the closest parallel I can think of is either Nikka Whisky from the Barrel or Nikka Coffey Malt."

Whiskyporn,3blxck,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:28:27 2015 UTC,"It is nothing like vodka really. It is very fruity, I did get a lot of pear/plum on the palate. It reminds a lot of plum brandy - Slivovitz, if you have ever had any."
Whiskyporn,3blxck,Doneeb,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:35:18 2015 UTC,"Slivovitz:       Slivovitz or Slivovitsa is a fruit brandy made from Damson plums,  often referred to as plum brandy.  Slivovitz is produced in Central and Eastern Europe, both commercially as well as homemade. Primary producers are in Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Romania, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and Bulgaria. In the Balkans it is part of the category of drinks called Rakia, while in Hungary it is part Pálinka; in Czech Republic and Slovakia Pálenka, which all are the same concept.

I can understand why you are saying that. :)"

Whiskyporn,3bkzfh,Ethanized,2,Tue Jun 30 03:14:35 2015 UTC,"I picked up another pig this weekend (it rocks to have a friend with a farm!!!), and am curing 40lbs of belly in a bourbon wet rub of BT, brown sugar, cayenne, S&P and fresh lavender.  I use the dry components for most of my barbecued pork, so I figured why not add bourbon to the mix.  This will cure until Friday afternoon, when it goes in the smoker with a mix of applewood and corn cobs for about an hour."

I've got access to a pretty regular stream of OWA store selects.  Right on the money that they're all more varied than any other SBs I've tried.  Only constant in the OWA I've found is that raisiny chew.  Love it.

Whiskyporn,3bk3l4,Dramonaut,2,Mon Jun 29 21:45:35 2015 UTC,"From my experience, these all taste the most different from each other than any other single barrels I've tried from other whiskies.  I've yet to have a bad one, they really vary a lot so I can't say any are better or worse than the regular.  And yea, they are still 107s"
Whiskyporn,3bk3l4,slanderousu,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:51:51 2015 UTC,Some have more bite than others. Agreed lots of variation between each.

Whiskyporn,3b9r03,PreyMonkie,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:36:11 2015 UTC,Is Singapore more expensive than other big cities whisky wise?
Whiskyporn,3b9r03,PreyMonkie,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:42:13 2015 UTC,"I can comfortably say that our prices are rather inflated (thanks to our absurd duty).  Entry level scotch whiskies tends to be about a 10-20 dollar difference from each other. A Macallan 12 cheapest is 104 and it's a promotion pricing. Glenlivet and Glenfiddich 12 are often at the 100-120 range.  Needless to say, you do become much more picky about what you buy because there's no way you are coming home with a 5 bottle haul without shelling out at least $500 and that's a generous pricing!  Edit: 18 year old whiskies jump up to the 200-300 range easily. The hakushu 18 is priced at about 300++ (yikes!)"

Whiskyporn,3b9fye,slanderousu,2,Sat Jun 27 02:44:23 2015 UTC,"I could smell oak and cherries on a Knob Creek with ice in a rocks glass outside.  Granted Knob Creek is not subtle, and those are some obvious aromas."
Whiskyporn,3b9fye,quercus_robur,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:46:06 2015 UTC,His fill line is also fairly low.  Possibly you're superhuman...
Whiskyporn,3b9fye,slanderousu,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:49:26 2015 UTC,"I guess we're imagining different scenarios.  Doesn't look that close to the grill to me, and who knows which way the smoke is blowing.  It's not like I said I could capture the aromas on a racing speedboat--just seems like a normal backyard scenario, and I don't have a problem with getting a basic aroma off something 100+ proof in a rocks glass.  If I swirl the glass, the low fill line shouldn't change the amount of aromas much.  Anyway, you were half-kidding, I was half-kidding.  But I would be able to smell ""oak"" on bourbon in a backyard, even from a Solo cup."
