SuggestALaptop,3e3nhx,nrabuttons,10,Tue Jul 21 18:30:50 2015 UTC,"Here's what I've gathered.  Since they specialize in sager, people tend to be happy with their purchase when it comes to that brand.   HOWEVER, I had a pretty awful experience with them and vow to never give them my service ever again.  Honestly, you're better off getting it through newegg.  Free 2 day shipping (usually) best deals, and impeccable service.   There was a dude that bought a computer from xotic and never received it.  Not even a refund.  He made a PSA On this sub and they popped up to ""clear some things up"", however in the end, it made them look awful as a company.  Personally, I say stay the shit away from them."
SuggestALaptop,3e3nhx,Meathand,4,Tue Jul 21 20:49:35 2015 UTC,"I can agree, bought a sager from XoticPC and it's a great machine. But Xotic was... lacking. No updates unless you ask, which was a big deal because it took 3 and 1/2 weeks to build/ship it out. When they say up to 14 business days, they mean it. Laptop works great, but don't go with them unless you don't want it for a while.  I'll second the newegg suggestion too, Xotic's lower prices aren't worth the wait."

SuggestALaptop,3e5nq0,GeorgeFromManagement,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:39:09 2015 UTC,Lenovo y50 is the way to go for that budget
SuggestALaptop,3e4uaw,enlightenedonut,4,Tue Jul 21 23:36:36 2015 UTC,"Hey cool, a fellow incoming medical student! I just made the same choice as you, with nearly the same budget (slightly lower at ~$800). I decided pretty early on that an active digitizer was a must-have for me, as I want to be able to annotate powerpoint slides easily while in lecture. I also didn't want a tablet with an attachable keyboard, as I'll be doing a lot of typing of notes as well and just dislike that form factor. Many med students I've talked to love their Surface Pro's, and that's definitely an option, but it's not what I was looking for: a traditional but highly portable laptop with a digitizer. I did an insane amount of research on laptops with digitizers and this is what I found.    The list of current-gen (i.e. not outdated) machines with active digitizers that are traditional laptops, rather than tablets with attachable keyboards, are as follows:    Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga (1st gen) Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga 12 (2nd gen) Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga 14 (2nd gen, Best Buy model only) Fujitsu Lifebook T935 Dell Inspiron 13 7000 Hp Spectre x360    The Thinkpad Yoga 1st Gen I almost hesitated to include since it uses Haswell architecture, but it's still sold at Best Buy and is honestly still a hell of a machine, so I included it.    Of these, the Thinkpads and the Fujitsu use Wacom digitizer tech, which is the industry standard and the best you can get. The HP and the Dell use Synaptics, which is newer tech that was pretty terrible on release a few years ago but has made tremendous strides and is now more-or-less indistinguishable from Wacom, especially for note-taking as opposed to art work.    I disregarded the Fujitsu immediately because it's really pricey, and it's out of your budget as well, so that's out.    I next disregarded the Thinkpad Yoga 12 (2nd gen), because the only difference between it and the first gen were Broadwell CPU architecture and the presence of dedicated trackpad buttons. I'd rather pay less for a slightly older but nearly identical machine, personally.    The Dell Inspiron 13 7000 is a great machine, especially the Special Edition which is configurable with a 256 GB SSD, as opposed to the HDD-only normal edition. Unfortunately the Special Edition was a bit outside my budget so I decided against it, but it's right at the limit of yours at $999 for the optimally-configured model. Definitely something to look at. I also decided against it because, after trying it, the HP, and the Lenovo laptops in person, I preferred the build quality and the keyboards of the other two, both of which I thought were somewhat average on the Dell.    Although I considered the Thinkpad Yoga 1st gen till the bitter end, it's got a 12.5"" screen which is smaller than your minimum size, so that's out.    That leaves the Thinkpad Yoga 14 and the HP Spectre x360. These are honestly both incredible machines and which one you pick depends on what you value. The Thinkpad is built like a tank with magnesium alloy and a retractable keyboard when the screen is folded back. Yet it still retains a nice, slim form factor and, while it's heavier than the HP, is still lighter than almost any 15"" notebook you'd find. Plus, it's got that nice 14"" screen that is more suited to a desktop replacement. The HP Spectre x360, on the other hand, is built very similarly to a Macbook Pro. Unibody aluminum, metal keycaps, glass trackpad, it even has the little notch on the front for opening the laptop. It's thinner and lighter than the Yoga but not significantly in either. Both of these laptops have among the best keyboard I've ever used on laptops of their size, though the Lenovo wins slightly due to have more a bit more travel due to its increased thickness and more space between keys due to its increased screen size.    The Thinkpad Yoga 14 is available in a few different models, but the only model with an active digitizer is the $999 model from Best Buy, which has a 1080p screen, an i5-5200U, 8 GB of RAM, and a 1 TB HDD with a 16 GB SSD cachce. It also has a dedicated Nvidia 940M GPU, great if you want to play games on it or do any graphical rendering. The HP Spectre has more configurations, ranging from $899 to $1399. The model of equivalent price, $999 model and probably the best value they offer, has identical specs to the Yoga except that it trades the Nvidia 940M for a 256 GB SSD. Which of these you value more is up to you.    Honestly, the machines are so similar that I'd recommend you just go to a Best Buy and play around with them and see which one you like more. When I did this, I decided on the HP Spectre x360 because I preferred its Macbook-style build and its trackpad. Since my budget was $800, though, I actually bought a refurbished model for $750.    Now, all of the above is only really relevant if you, like me, decided that a digitizer was a must-have. If not, a lot more options open up as well, especially in 15"" models which tend not to have digitizers. But I can't really help you there since all my research was focused on models with active pen support.    Let me know if you have any questions! :)    Edit: If you want an exhaustive list of all models, current and past gen, that have active digitizers, check out this spreadsheet."
SuggestALaptop,3e4uaw,Silverflash-x,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:26:13 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is amazing. I was actually looking at the Thinkpad Yoga and am heavily leaning towards it, but it the 14"" model doesn't seem to be offered on the Lenovo Site. I do believe that a digitizer is essential though.   What do you think of the i7-5500U, 256GB SSB Thinkpad Yoga 15. It's the 3rd one, and I'll be ordering through a friends' company where it'll be discounted to $804?  http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/yoga-series/yoga-15/"

People are theorizing that an active pen-supported model will be released in the next month or two, if you're willing to wait that long. See this thread for more information."

That narrows the field a lot. I'd personally recommend the Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga 14, the digitizer will be a huge boon in any artistic work, and the dedicated GPU + 5th gen i5will be able to handle any image renders or light-to-medium gaming you need to do. Also very durable (as are all Thinkpads, gotta love that magnesium alloy) and with the best keyboard i've personally ever used on a 14 inch laptop.

However, even a 980m won't deliver 75+ on high/1080p with the most advanced games. You will get right around 60, though, which is going to look pretty great.    If you absolutely must have the additional performance, the only lappy for you is this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834152808&cm_re=5700hq-_-34-152-808-_-Product&nm_mc=AFC-C8Junction&cm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-_-na-_-na-_-na&cm_sp=&AID=11552995&PID=7707424&SID=   SLI 980m's will deliver 75+ fps, but at the price of battery life which is only 3 hours on the titan.    Both of these use TN displays, however, which are lower quality than IPS displays used on most newer/higher end laptops. I'd recommend lowering your standard of performance slightly to get a computer that fits more of your desired specs. Specifically, I'd go for the newest Razor Blade, which has great build quality, battery life, a killer 3k display, and a 970m which is still a good enough card to play advanced games at perfectly good framerates."

SuggestALaptop,3e3vhh,Orangematz,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:39:46 2015 UTC,The thing is the two processors you were comparing were low voltage processors.  There is not a large performance gain between the low voltage i5 to i7. Only roughly ~10-15% better in heavy benchmarks.  The part where the i7's really shine is the 47xxHQ; it is quad-core compared to all other mobile i5's (42xxH) which are dual core where it will be a lot better in video editing and other CPU intensive tasks. They are only really needed for that; they are not by any means better choices for gaming unless you are looking at them being the same price.

Sorry to say though, but personally I don't have any troubles with mine.  What I do know is that Eurocom Laptops are extremely upgrade able meaning, Even their motherboards can be changed out, even their graphics card chip can be upgraded.   So personally if it was me, if it is cheaper to buy a motherboard/graphics card ship than it is for the shipping i would purchase a motherboard/graphics card and install it myself.

Non cpu or GPU intensive work gets good temps. The only time the gs60 gets really hot is if you use it on a bed, then the sides will be pretty hot since the bed is blocking air flow. I just use my pad for the lift and not the fan now since I'm fine with the temps.   Plus you can use the msi shift modes (affects your cpu and gpu) , green (underclock your cpu and GPU, turn off turbo boost, Super silent even when gaming), comfort(standard) and sport (overclocked, fan on max). Doesn't get hot at all on green (at some performance cost).   Fan is pretty loud on sport, fine on comfort, quiet on green  One thing, if you want to upgrade your ssd or ram yourself this may not be the model you want, ive done it and it takes a pretty long time since they are both on the other side of the motherboard when you open it up from the back.

It's the slimmest laptop with a GTX 980M and it's 15"". The best thing about it is the battery life, which is twice the MSI's. And its cooling is better than the MSI's too. Another thing caught my attention, I read in another post on reddit that MSI laptops tend to be more flashy and attract the attention of thieves (probably because of the keyboard backlights and the crest on the back of the screen), and because of that Sager is preferable, their laptops are very discrete."

SuggestALaptop,3e1lpb,EnglishInfix,4,Tue Jul 21 06:47:36 2015 UTC,"Sub $500 for gaming is tough. Gaming performance goes up dramatically the more you can spend.    Best option is probably the Acer Aspire E5-573G. It's at the very maximum of your budget and has a decent dedicated GPU and a Broadwell i5 processor, as well as 8 GB of RAM. The weakness in this machine is the screen resolution (1366x768), but to get a higher one you'd have to pay more, and honestly at $500 you won't have the performance to run games smoothly at higher resolutions anyway.    Edit: i realized my post quite across a little negative, so let me emphasize that this Acer is honestly an incredibly deal. To get an i5 and a 940m and 8 GB of RAM for $500 is insane. Hell, it even has a hybrid drive, meaning the huge 1 TB HDD has an 8 GB SSD component to put some commonly used programs on (things like your web browser) which will make them really snappy. I'd recommend it even if your budget was $600. It's a $650-$700 laptop masquerading as a $500 laptop and I'm actually surprised it's so cheap. I should nevertheless mention that were you willing to buy refurbished you'd have more options, since you could likely find an $800 machine for sub-$500 refurbished."

Honestly, gaming at 4k is really only plausible right now on a desktop; to do so at high frame rate on a laptop would require an insanely expensive machine. Have you considered going the desktop route? You'll get a better performance/price ratio if you're not worried about portability.    If portability is a hard requirement for you, then yeah, i'd probably downgrade. I wouldn't be happy at 48 fps, especially in games like CS:GO.

The build quality is supposed to be great, so perhaps consider it despite its HP branding.    If HP is a deal-breaker I'd recommend the Dell 13 7000. You'll have to check the Swiss pricing but it should be analogous to the HP. It doesn't have the same Macbook-esque build quality/portability of the HP or the great keyboard and trackpad, but it otherwise fits your needs.

SuggestALaptop,3dzr5t,AzaRoka,3,Mon Jul 20 21:12:24 2015 UTC,I've seen a few requests for folding machines with touch screen and stylus with a decent gpu. However due to the bulk a dedicated gpu adds they don't really exist. The best you can really do is get one with the fastest igp you can and put some fast ram in it (if it has slots).
SuggestALaptop,3dzr5t,MeakerSE,2,Mon Jul 20 23:19:16 2015 UTC,"I heard some could be found with GTX 840M or 750Ms which are at least a little better than igps, I just don't know what would be the best for the actual writing (touchscreen/stylus quality). Also, Intel advertises the 5000 and 5500 as able to run LoL very smoothly, but I played League on a friend's laptop with intel5000 and I had to put it on the lowest settings, which even then it was 30fps idle dropping down to 15 whenever I actually did anything. Thoughts?"
SuggestALaptop,3dzr5t,Silverflash-x,3,Mon Jul 20 23:39:52 2015 UTC,"If you want Surface Pro 3-esque note taking, you need a laptop with an active digitzer. That limits your options to a pretty small list:   Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga (1st gen)  Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga 12 (2nd gen)  Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga 14 (2nd gen, Best Buy model only)  Fujitsu Lifebook T935   Dell Inspiron 13 7000   Hp Spectre x360   These are the only current models that aren't outdated (and that are laptops first, tablets second as opposed to the reverse) that have active digitizers for a smooth, paper-like note-taking experience.   I had to make this exact decision with the exact same budget as you a couple days ago, and I picked the Spectre x360 because I preferred the form factor. I didn't need gaming performance though, as I have a desktop, so for you I'd recommend the Thinkpad Yoga 14  as it comes with a dedicated Nvidia 940M GPU. However, the model that has an active digitizer is ONLY available at Best Buy and the digitizer is (for some reason) not mentioned anywhere in the specs; it's been confirmed to exist on tabletpcreview.com, however. Make sure you pick the right model because otherwise it will just have a normal touchscreen and they look identical.  Edit: And honestly, the Spectre x360 and either of the 2nd gen Thinkpad Yoga models blow the others out of the water. The Fujitsu is too expensive and the Dell is bulky and has no SSD component to its hard drive. The best ultrabooks for note-taking right now are the Spectre and the Thinkpad Yogas, and only the Yoga 14 has a dedicated GPU."
SuggestALaptop,3dzr5t,Silverflash-x,2,Mon Jul 20 23:49:57 2015 UTC,"How durable is the Yoga 14? I'm not going to be throwing it on the ground, but how's the wear-and-tear last on the build, or on any of the ones you listed?"
SuggestALaptop,3dzr5t,Silverflash-x,2,Tue Jul 21 00:13:26 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply. Thinkpads are famous for the durability; if it was a major factor in my purchase, a Thinkpad model would be my first thought. As far as I know they're all put through military certification testing, though I wasn't able to find much information on that relative to the Yoga specifically. Still, it's made from magnesium alloy and has a ""roll cage"" to withstand drops. Plus, the keyboard has a ""lift and lock"" mechanism where, when folded into tablet mode and exposing the keyboard on the back, a tray lifts up and prevents the keys from being pressed or jostled. So yeah, durability is Lenovo's strong suit. It's almost certainly the most durable on the list.  The HP Spectre x360 isn't too far behind, but it's built differently. Instead of a magnesium ""brick"" (the Yoga 14 is still thin, but is somewhat bulkier and more square), the Spectre is built very, very similar to a Macbook. Solid, one-sheet aluminum body, brushed stainless steel sides, glass trackpad, the works. It hasn't really been around long enough for me to speak to its long-term durability where wear-and-tear is concerned, but I've been impressed with the build quality. Again, it feels almost exactly like a lightweight Macbook, so use that as your metric.     No idea about the Fujitsu, I've never seen it in person. I know that the outside of the laptop contains magnesium and the inside is brushed aluminum, but I would be slightly concerned as to the long-term durability of its swivel hinged, since one point of rotation (rather than two, as on the Yoga and the Spectre) may be more likely to wear over time. That's just speculation though; I never considered it due to its price.    The Inspiron is probably the least durable, though that's not to say it's fragile. The lid is half-plastic/half-metal, compared to the all-metal build of the Spectre or the magnesium compound of the Yoga. The bottom is all plastic which I personally dislike. The interior and keyboard are aluminum which is nice, but the lid has a soft-touch finish over the plastic/metal, which I personally hate on laptops due to its tendency to damage over time. It's slightly heavier than the other options, which is good or bad depending on your perspective.    So I'd say the Yoga 14 wins out, followed by the HP Spectre. Those two are the best contenders anyway and were, personally, the only options I was considering."

Also, for the Full HD model, the screen is very good and I can get around 13 hours on a charge (although dell claims 15)."
SuggestALaptop,3e1keq,rob_shi,0,Tue Jul 21 16:23:30 2015 UTC,"I think your best option may be the Dell Inspiron 13 7000. Configured with a 5th-gen Broadwell i7, 8 GB RAM, and a 256GB SSD, it'll cost you $999. That's a great price for that level of performance packed into a 13"" form factor. You can drop $100 if you're willing to lose the SSD and pick up a  1 TB HDD, but I'd definitely pay more for the SSD. As an added bonus, that model includes active digitizer tech in the touch screen, so if you buy a Synapics Active Pen (~$30), you can mimic a paper-quality writing experience when taking notes or drawing.    Other options: the other two best choices here are the HP Spectre x360, which has a smaller form factor but is pricier (and an HP, which you mentioned you dislike) and the Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro, which has an insane 3200x1800 resolution. The downside is its processor is a Haswell rather than a Broadwell (i.e. it's one processor generation behind). This isn't a huge deal, but since you do processor-heavy tasks, it should be considered.    Another alternative if you dislike the Dell or would prefer a slightly larger screen (14"") is the Lenovo Yoga 3 It's the same price as the Dell, though for $50 more ($1050) you can add a dedicated GPU, which doesn't seem to be a concern for what you do now but might future-proof your machine somewhat.    But yeah the Dell 13 7000 offers what you're looking for at the best price, I think.    Edit: Just noticed you're Canadian. I honestly know nothing about Canadian pricing; everything above is US pricing, so your mileage may vary."

I know you said that a touch screen was unnecessary, but I'll mention the Thinkpad Yoga 14 anyway, since getting a 2-in-1 machine will likely end up being cheaper than getting a laptop and a tablet separately. It's $999, so at the very top end of your range, but fits all your requirements and has some really nice bonuses. Rotating hinge allows it to be used as a tablet or to us the keyboard as a stand for the laptop; full HD screen; fantastic keyboard, best I've ever used on a 14"" laptop, and a dedicated GPU for video editing and gaming. The Best Buy model I linked even has an active digitizer (i.e. the tech in a Surface Pro) that makes writing on the screen with an active stylus more or less mimic writing on paper. Battery life is around 6.5 hours, so not stellar but in your range. Portability is excellent and among the best Lenovo has to offer.  If you're set on no touch screen; want something a little cheaper; or if you want the larger 15.6"" screen, consider the Edge E550. It's still a Thinkpad, but you lose the touchscreen/digitizer and lose some portability by gaining a fair bit of weight (7.1 lbs vs the 4.2 of the Yoga) and having the larger screen. In return though, you get a better processor (i7 vs i5), a dedicated graphics card for gaming and video editing, and more battery life (9 hours average!), all for $250 less than the Yoga. The downside here is that the E series is not quite as durable as the T series or the Yoga, though it's certainly not fragile; just more in line with a comparable HP or Dell.  Which one I'd recommend over the other really depends on your preferences. One is more portable with a smaller screen and a thin size, has a touch screen, can be converted into a tablet, uses a digitizer to create a smooth note-taking experience, all while providing great performance. The other lacks a touch screen, and is larger, heavier, more powerful, longer battery life, and cheaper.    Both the T450 and the T450s are great machines with tremendous durability though, and you can't go wrong with either. They're a little more pricey than the E550 which is why I suggested it, but they are more durable; if you're willing to pay a premium for that quality, I heartily recommend either over the E550.   I'd be happy to provide some non-Lenovo recommendations, though honestly, few other products will match the durability and typing experience of both of these Thinkpads, which is really top-notch and nearly unparalleled."

I feel like I say this every time but a gaming laptop really exists for a very specific set of people who need them (eg work travellers who want to be able to game from their hotel rooms) - for just about everyone else, the downsides are just too great.  I don't know exactly how the finances translate (UK here), but for your money you should be able to build a 1080p capable PC, maybe getting a monitor second hand or something, and getting windows from dreamspark (via your school) to help out, then saving for one of the $300/400 acer's or whatever from Amazon.  They're not ideal laptops, but you'll have a much better experience with one of those than any gaming laptop you can get for $850.  By experience I mean much more than games. I'm assuming that if you need a laptop, you'll want to be carrying it around, and using it at school or elsewhere in public. So how heavy is it? Will it break your back carrying it around all day? How big is the power brick? How long will it last on battery? Most gaming laptops will struggle to exceed a few hours, even in 'eco mode'.. I don't want to list all of the downsides, but I hope you can see where I'm going.

It's got a touch screen (and even better, it has an active digitizer, a la Surface Pro, so it mimics an on-paper writing/drawing experience), can be folded back and used as a tablet, and is a thin and light Windows ultrabook. Yet design-wise it's extremely similar to a Macbook: unibody aluminum chassis, glass trackpad, same form factor, etc. Plus it gets a solid 9-10 hours of battery life. It comes in at $1150 for the (in my opinion) best-priced model, but if you really want that high resolution you can get a QHD screen for $1400.    My choice was made because of the digitizer, which as a medical student, is incredible for note taking and annotating; you might also use it in Illustrator.    Worth considering, seems like the best of both worlds to me! Of your choices, I think I'd pick the XPS, it's a great machine if, in my opinion, a tad pricey."

Plus, the newer model has G-SYNC, which is amazing to have in a monitor. It gets rid of all stuttering and screen tearing, keeping everything smooth even if you aren't at 60fps! The 4720hq will serve you fine if you go with the first one, but the 5700hq will be much better in saving energy while having even more power. Get the second one imo, it has 16gb of ram and is packed with much more newer stuff (features, processor!) fthan the older one!"

SuggestALaptop,3dzkd8,xgunnyx504,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:41:54 2015 UTC,"It depends on who you buy from, the specific model, and so forth. Refurbished laptops usually come with a very short warranty (90 days rather than a year or two), and some parts may be non-obviously degraded (I would never trust a refurbished hard drive or SSD, for instance).  If you buy a manufacturer-refurbished laptop and keep frequent backups (which you should be doing anyways), then the risk isn't significant. Depending on what your mother's needs actually are, the refurbished model may be more powerful than necessary. If that's the case, I might suggest erring on the side of a longer warranty."
SuggestALaptop,3dzkd8,fourdots,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:46:01 2015 UTC,"Well, as we would be buying it through Amazon, they have a 30 day return policy regardless of it being a new or used product. If we weren't using the points, then it wouldn't really matter too much because we could simply go to the manufacturer, but I don't think that's a possibility for this situation. The programs she would need would not bog down the computer too much, but we might as well take the gamble for the massive QoL increase that the refurbished laptop would give her over the mediocre new laptop.  Honestly, my mind is nearly made up on the matter, I'm just curious to hear the general consensus on refurbs, to know if I'm just asking for trouble or not."

You can upgrade the RAM on the T550 yourself. It has two accessible RAM slots. And getting 8 GB of RAM directly from Lenovo is not $1000 more. If you click on the ""Select"" button of a specific model, you can customize it. Going from 4 to 8 GB of RAM is only $50.

I would also recommend to read up if his version WordPerfect is compatible with Windows 8.1 or Windows 10. If not, customize the laptop with Windows 7 Professional.  Another point is that the T550 from Lenovo doesn't have an optical drive (CD/DVD drive). If he want one, he will have to live with an external drive.

The GPU works very poorly in that system, I experienced it first-hand. I didn't do enough research before buying it. Lenovo typically has much better build quality on their systems, but Y40 is a flake and probably not worth your money. I sent mine back yesterday. Nonetheless 6gb ram is plenty for your purposes. Any more is a plus but would likely be redundant unless you're running very demanding programs.  Would you consider refurb laptops?"

I think it depends more on the seller in terms of the refurb quality.   The Y40-70 I speak of was also a refurb, but it wasn't because it was a refurb that it was bad--its just a bad machine.  Refurb gets you a better laptop for cheap and in my experience its only the name that strays people away."

The other laptop you suggested has better CPU, but it seems to fall flat in the other areas. Is the .7GHz that much of a difference? Especially because the first one has the SSHD, which you said makes a difference in gaming (i'm sorry, but I'm not really sure what the difference it makes). It doesn't have as much max memory storage, is that make much of a difference? Final question: will there be a better sale later on than the $50 off, such as when school starts? Sorry for all the questions, I'm just trying to make sure I fully understand what I'm getting into."
SuggestALaptop,3dwayj,Turtle_is_delicious,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:19:54 2015 UTC,"No problem at all, we're here to help! The CPU for the i5 will have almost the exact same performance as the i7.  The only time the i7 is really used is with multithreading which it doesn't look like you're going to be doing much of (think 3D CAD rendering for engineers or graphics designers).  The GPU on the Asus is the best for the price right now.  The GPU is what determines graphics and frames per second.    Having an SSD and an HD comes with some benefits as well.  Being able to download a game onto your SSD means that you can pull data from it MUCH faster and thus have better rendering and loading times among other things.  Also the SSD will have enough room for your OS which will mean your computer will boot up A LOT faster.  As for memory storage that is just to personal preference.  Some people save a bunch of stuff and need really big hard-drives, some people don't.  For the price I thought this was a pretty middle of the road compromise on disk space.  As for having a better sale, I have absolutely no idea for that.  Granted, I wouldn't really say this laptop is 'on sale' because its priced at exactly what it's worth.  If you want to wait for a real sale you're more than welcome to because I don't see the price doing anything other than falling.  Also, who knows, there might be a real sale that happens where you can get a really nice machine for the same price."

Of course, if you want more power, you can go up to a newer model, though 8 GB RAM with an i5 is probably all you need for light assignments. The real nice part is the durability (the normal SSD stuff as well as a screen that you have to twist hard for it it to budge in the wrong direction. The thing uses military tests for durability. I got it because I was tired of consumer laptops dying on a yearly basis. The thing comes from HP with a 3 year warranty because it's expected to last.)

I got the m5 pro with gtx 965m and the graphics card is faulty or something (getting 1-2 fps from 3dmark, BSODs pointing to graphics card).   I had to pay for shipping to ship it back when the faulty GPU was already faulty on arrival. Since your shipping costs 93 Euro, I highly recommend buying from another reseller that covers shipping both ways should you ever have to send it back. When I sent mine back, they ""stress tested"" it, reinstalled drivers and windows and said everything was fine. I just got the laptop back today, 3dmark tested it, graphics card is still not working properly. Graphics score of 380 from a gtx 965m which is a lower score than an office pc of 2013! I don't think they even looked at the card closely and only did general testing. Not only that, but the bottom of the laptop is a lot more banged up than when I had sent it. Emailed Euorocom support again and now I'm waiting for a reply from support.  I bought the laptop to USE and half that time has been spent in shipping, stressing, diagnosing and getting it back. (2 WEEKS+). Now I'm going to have to wait another 2 weeks in between waiting for a reply, shipping it and waiting for it to get back and by then, my summer will almost be over.  I would suggest picking another reseller that covers shipping both ways in case there is something wrong with your Clevo. (Eurocom P5 pro is the same as a Clevo P750ZM)"

The T450s has one accessible RAM slot (the firsts 4 GB are soldered to the motherboard) and a m.2 NGFF SSD slot (42 mm) + one place for a 2.5 inch SATA storage device (the HDD is located there). You could through out the 16 GB m.2 SSD cache and replace it with a bigger one (a 128 or 256 GB). It will take some work, but it's doable. $150 above your budget, but you can ge the T450s a little bit cheaper if you buy it through their corporate perks offer program (the passcode is FLEN*2V) or the Barnes and Noble Gold Program. Same configuration as above would be around $800. With a RAM upgrade it would be over your budget, but I think it would be worth it and you would get a laptop with a word class keyboard.  Otherwise check these models out:   Dell Inspiron 13 7348 for $599 with the promo code SAVE100 (it's out of stock right now, but I'm sure that's only temporary) Dell Inpsiron 13 7352 Toshiba Satellite E45 (and enough of your budget left to replace the HDD with an SSD)"

The HDD also isn't to scoff at being 7200rpm, but still not near the speed of an SSD. You can always upgrade the RAM if 4gb isn't cutting it, and the m2 slot allows you to stick in an SSD if you need it alongside the HDD."

I got the FHD and i can say that the display is brilliant, viewing angles are great, very bright on full brightness.

SuggestALaptop,3dssbp,Silverflash-x,2,Sun Jul 19 07:38:44 2015 UTC,"I'd second the Spectre x360 mention. Just finally chose a Spectre x360 for med school over all the other options and after an incredible amount of research. Almost went with a Thinkpad Yoga but changed my mind last second. Can't wait for it to get here. It's a beautiful machine.    Actually OP, after reading your requirements, the Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga 14 ($999) may be perfect for you. Dedicated Nvidia graphics, hybrid drive (so lots of storage on the HDD, but room for the OS on the SSD for blazing boot times). It seems to fit all your requirements. It's the right size, has an IPS 1080p panel, incredible build quality that Thinkpads are known for, nice weight and portability... sounds right on the money.    Side note: a potentially quite handy feature for college note-taking is a laptop with a touchscreen containing an active digitizer. This allows you to use an active stylus to write directly on the screen smoothly enough that it mimics paper. The $999 Best Buy model of the Thinkpad Yoga 14 has one (but only the Best Buy model and only the $999 one), as does the Dell Inspiron 13 7000, the HP Spectre x360, the Thinkpad Yoga 12, and the Fujitsu Lifebook T935. These are the only current-gen laptop (i.e. not tablet) models that have an active digitizer, so if it seems like something you'd like it may be worth considering.    For me, it was a hard requirement since the primary purpose of my machine was note taking, which is why I was deciding between the Thinkpad Yoga and the Spectre x360."
SuggestALaptop,3dssbp,Orangematz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:58:39 2015 UTC,"Wow I really appreciate your input. I had no idea something lightweight like the Yoga 14 had dedicated graphics, not to mention fairly decent graphics too. This is going to be a hard decision between the three!  Edit: if you don't mind me asking, how's the display, keyboard and overall performance of the Spectre?"
SuggestALaptop,3dssbp,SuperAKid,2,Sun Jul 19 07:16:52 2015 UTC,"My Spectre hasn't arrived yet; it'll be here in a few days. I have, however, used both the Spectre and the TPY14 in Best Buy for quite a while as well as done quite a bit of research on them to make up my mind.    Display: The Spectre's display depends on what model you get, of which there are four. The first three all have 1920x1080 screens, and these are what I've seen in person at Best Buy. I was really impressed. It's very bright and clear, and quite glossy to boot, which adds glare (boo) but helps make contrast pop (yay). Overall I was impressed. The most expensive Spectre model has a QHD (2560x1440) display, which is insane for a 13.3"" laptop. I'm sure it's gorgeous, though I haven't seen it. Between you and me, I think it's overkill for a laptop of this size; 1080p looks great. The Lenovo's 1080p display is very, very similar to the Spectre's. Also very bright, but not quite as glossy, which is either good or bad depending on your preference.    Keyboard: This is the thing I was most impressed about on both machines. As someone used to a mechanical keyboard on my desktop I expected to hate all ultrabook keyboards (and some are certainly poor), but I was pleasantly surprised. The Spectre had nice travel and overall quality, metal keycaps, nice spacing. The Lenovo edges it out here, though: the TPY14 has the best ultrabook keyboard and possibly the best laptop keyboard I've ever used. Great pressure and travel. Very impressed. Spectre was still very nice, though, so don't be too concerned. Basically, the Spectre reminded me of a Macbook keyboard. The Lenovo wins here though. (Side note, trackpad goes to HP. Smooth glass is so nice compared to the more matte surface of the Lenovo. Not a big deal though).    Performance: Processor goes to HP; comparable models to Best Buy's TPY14 have i7's compared to Lenovo's i5. Graphics, however, goes to the Yoga since it has a dedicated GPU (and a pretty decent one at that) while the HP uses integrated graphics. If gaming is a primary interest, the Yoga will be significantly better here and that's why I recommended it specifically for you.   Honestly I don't know much about the XPS 13 or the Inspiron 13 7000, other than the XPS has incredible battery life and form factor but no active digitizer, while the Inspiron does have a digitizer. I honestly think they're all great options though, you can't really go wrong."

The XPS because for my preference I would like a traditional laptop, the only downside is that the 8gb ram cost too much, so im stuck with the model from the microsoft store, which isnt too bad since its a signature edition and removes bloat ware.  As for the x360, for that price and spec its a great deal. but keep in mind its a refurbished and no returns. The x360 is great if you're going to touch screen heavily and utilize the 2-in-1 laptop the way it was meant to be used. Also the x360 doesnt come with a load of bloat ware.  I hope this video helps https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oCwB-T7Lr0 Its literally a video between them two. The dell in the video is a touch screen model.

I'm usually the type to just go as big and powerful as possible on the non-replaceable parts, but the IPS panel almost certainly wins over the extra processing capability in this case for me.  Any thoughts on the R7 M260? It seems to be a bit less powerful than the GT740m and the GeForce 840 found in the two HP Envy's, but still seems to just about hold it's own on low-medium settings on the Sims 4.

My two cents: If you prefer build quality, keyboard quality, and a slightly larger display go for the Lenovo. If you prefer a smaller size (both in screen and in general size/portability) and battery life, go for the Dell. The Lenovo strikes me as slightly more of a ""desktop replacement"" with its build and keyboard, while the Dell as more of a on-the-go device with its compact design and crazy battery life. I think I would probably pick the Dell for my uses, but you can't overstate how nice and durable Thinkpads are, and only you can make the final call."

SuggestALaptop,3dsqv1,c21,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:30:35 2015 UTC,"This Asus seems alright.  Price: $799  Processor: Core i7-5500U  Display: 15.6 inches (TN i think), 1920x1080, Matte(!)  RAM: 8gb DDR3  Storage: 256GB SSD  GPU: Nvidia GTX950M  Overall a very nice laptop for the price, seems fairly lightweight and thin. The specs are pretty excellent for the price, and the reviews seem to be mostly positive, aside from the screen, which is apparently mediocre. I would think battery life would only be around 4-5 hours for a laptop like this one, but reading around some people are getting up to about 6-7 when doing moderately low intensity tasks. You should be able to play League and Civ at max settings on a comfortably high FPS, and most new games at medium/medium high. Here is a previous thread about it. A con is that it's 15.6 inches.  The UX305 might also be okay.  Price: $689  Processor: Intel Core M-5Y10  Display: 13.3 inches IPS, 1920x1080 (I think it's Matte)  RAM: 8gb DDR3  Storage: 256GB SSD  GPU: Integrated, Intel 5300  This is an extremely thin and light laptop, moreso than your average Ultrabook; it's incredibly thin and light, and has no fans. However, it comes at the cost of performance; gaming is going to be hard. To get League at 60FPS, you're probably going to need to run it around medium and a lower resolution, like 1368 x 768. Not sure about Civ, but probably around medium settings at a lower resolution as well. Running a 1080P video on Chrome with a few more tabs open is going to take up most of the power. Battery life is varied, but seems to be around 6-7 hours when doing moderately intensive tasks."

It runs pretty well, I've never had any issues with that. One problem I've had is with the track pad being unresponsive a few times, but I use an external mouse normally so it's not a huge deal. And I'm not a huge PC gamer, but you should be able to run a decent amount of games on around medium settings. I'm not sure about specifics for the witcher, but I imagine it would run smoothly at at least low settings, if you're alright with that.   One thing, they advertise a five hour battery life, but even in low performance mode and decreased brightness it's a struggle to get up to that. Be ready to carry your charger pretty much anywhere you go if you plan on using it for more than a couple of hours, at high performance about one full hour.   The screen may not be the best, but that's never really bothered me! I will say that ya a huge struggle to use this laptop outside if the sun is out at all, even in shade. Usually though, when I'm outside I'm not using my laptop, so the 2 or 3 times this has happened haven't been a big problem.   Overall, I'm pretty pleased with it. I'm an engineering student as well (MechE) and I've used it for coding it Matlab, C, Java, as well as for Creo and AutoDesk. Never had any problems with that!"

It seems like an incredible deal ...   It was never sold at $1700. Lenovo inflates the MSRP and gives a discount from the beginning. More of a marketing trick than anything else. No one would buy it for $1700. For that kind of money you could get a laptop with a GTX 980M.   I've heard bad things about the Y50 screens. Is that the case for this particular laptop or is it other models? I intend to use it for heavy gaming and CAD modeling purposes and I tend to play graphically intense games like Far Cry 4 and Crysis 3 and such. I'm concerned that this laptop won't be able to run them at high-ultra settings, and also that it will look like crap even if it could simply because of a poor screen.   Former iterations of the Lenovo Y50 had a poor TN panel (bad viewing angles, low contrast values and colour gamut). Lenovo switched now to IPS panel with better viewing angles, but contrast and colour gamut are still below average (especially for an IPS panel). I don't know if Lenovo switched to IPS panels on the touch model. You will have to chat up a sales rep (though they aren't really a reliable source) or find a review of the new touch model.  As for performance in games, check this website. Scroll down and you will find benchmark scores and fps values in different games for the GTX 960M. It should give you an impression how well games will run. Also read some reviews:   Notebookcheck.net review laptopmedia.com review    The deal seems fantastic but it also seems to be a little too good to be true.   It's not to good to be true. Laptops with an i7 quad core and a GTX 960M are all priced around 900 to 1000 bucks. You can check the alternatives like the Acer Aspire VN7-591G series or the Asus ROG GL551JW to see that they will cost the same."

I am typing this post with it.  Yes, I did my research. I got the Asus G75VW-AS71; don't look at me like I bought an Alienware or something. i7-3610QM, GTX 660M, 16 GB RAM.  It'll play any Source game perfectly, but things start getting really messy when you start trying to play more recent, demanding games. Dying Light? UT4? lolno.  Yes, I know there was probably a better lappy I could have bought at the time. Yes, I know the situation has probably improved.  But, the fact of the matter is that a gaming laptop is just not economical, and you're not going to find much at that budget. Get a desktop."

I need some kind of limit before I suggest a $2700 Falcon Northwest DRX.  But, how often and how long do you plan on traveling? Yes, gaming laptops are better on the go, but at a certain point it's not worth it.  Also, for what it's worth, gaming laptops themselves are not very portable. You'll probably have a 10 pound laptop and a 2 pound power brick. Don't discount the power brick; you're not gonna be gaming unplugged. Gaming laptops have awful batteries.  They're desktop replacements, not viable laptops. Yeah, you can move them more easily between desks, but don't expect to do much while not on one.  Also...   I only plan on getting a good year or two of use from it before replacing it with a new model.   A new >$1000 laptop every year or two? If you've got this kind of money, I'd suggest you start off with a desktop rig, and then begin your laptop collection. You could probably pull off having a desktop and laptop concurrently.  Disclaimer: I'm not trying to diss your purchasing decisions; I'm trying to help you. I bought a $1300 laptop instead of a desktop, and I wouldn't wish it on anyone."

The T450s has one accessible RAM slot (the firsts 4 GB are soldered to the motherboard) and a m.2 NGFF SSD slot (42 mm) + one place for a 2.5 inch SATA storage device (the HDD is located there). You could through out the 16 GB m.2 SSD cache and replace it with a bigger one (a 128 or 256 GB). It will take some work, but it's doable. Oh, and you can ge the T450s a little bit cheaper if you buy it through their corporate perks offer program (the passcode is FLEN*2V) or the Barnes and Noble Gold Program.

I wouldn't go for these. Try to get something with a decent display. A 1920x1080p IPS panel would be perfect. The laptops you linked come with a 1366x768p TN panel.
