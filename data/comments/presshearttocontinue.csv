presshearttocontinue,3dv9by,xmknzx,4,Mon Jul 20 03:36:07 2015 UTC,Id feel a bit awkward to ask for a signing while the panel was going on.
presshearttocontinue,3dv9by,slippingparadox,5,Mon Jul 20 03:11:44 2015 UTC,"I thought the same haha. I'm sure they meant no harm (just excited), buuuut it's considered bad con etiquette. So for future congoers, ALWAYS make sure you get a schedule ASAP and look for the signings for people you like. Also do some research online and find out how quickly panels typically fill up. Cons are fun, but if you have that one person you must see, do some research, and don't be too upset if outliers screw you over (whenever Vic Mignogna is at a convention, you can be sure his panels will be stupid busy. He will also have a possy that follows him around, because his head is the size of his homestate :P)"
presshearttocontinue,3dv9by,Thisisnowmyname,2,Mon Jul 20 03:59:56 2015 UTC,"I've never been to one of these, but watching them on youtube, there's always the ""can I get a hug"" guy, or ""sign my shirt.""  Like... in the middle of a Q&A with a few hundred people watching in person, more on stream/youtube. So weird."
presshearttocontinue,3dv9by,OMGBADBEATZLOL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:31:02 2015 UTC,"Haha, honestly, the cons I've been to I've never heard anyone ask that. The worst I've seen was ""Soooo I know we are only allowed 2 items to sign but I kinda brought four?"" and luckily the signer was more than happy to play along lol. I usually avoid Q&A with REALLY big voice actors though since I'd rather not deal with that mess.  Of course, this isn't counting the 18+ panels where a bunch of drunk voice actors are more than happy to unleash the stress a bunch of awkward nerds can cause lol."

presshearttocontinue,3dh1jm,shaboozeybot,4,Thu Jul 16 05:19:21 2015 UTC,"My own thoughts:  Gangsta first episodes were bretty gud, liking the drugs and whores premise but it seems to drift off into some supernatural power thing. Hope they're concentrating on the criminal thing more. Still doesn't hold a candle to black lagoon though.  DB Super: Its Dragon Ball :D Really loved the Beerus movie, hope they expand upon it. One of the Anime I look forward to the most this Season.  Jitsu Wa Watashi Wa: Dropped after 10 minutes  Aoharu x Machinegun was surprisingly amusing, main characters are sympathetic although I can't handle the shooting gallery host club :D. Seem just too weird to me. Hope they're not focussing on the gun matches too much although they spice it up from simple slice of life.  Charlotte was really exciting for the first 10 minutes and I loved the hell out of it, sadly after that he suddenly became a punching back for the schoolyard justice squad or so it seemed. Second episode made me laugh though and it even though the first 10 minutes were pretty much a lie it still seems like a good Anime in general. The girl also didn't turn out as horrible as I initially thought she would, quite the opposite actually which was surprising.  Rokka no Yuusha: Man I hate this arrogant yoloswag prick characters that get special powers shoved up their ass. Feels very clichÃ© overall but I'm giving it three episodes, will probably drop it though.  Akagami no Shirayukihime: Best Anime of the Season. Getting the same feeling I had with Spice and Wolf where watching the episodes makes my day brighter!  God Eater: Not too hopeful in terms of story or characters but will probably have some entertaining action in there so why not.  Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan: Dropped after 5 minutes  GATE: It's kinda interesting, modern weapons vs fantasy and the Empire running against a brick in their attempts to conquest what lies beyond the gate. Or rather they make it seem this way while strenghtening their own forces against the homeworld enemies. Seems like on of the better Anime this season, also Kishida Kyoudan OP so that's automatically a big plus for me!"
