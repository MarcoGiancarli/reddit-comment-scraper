The only ones you won't find are K2's self titled, Random Chaos (a bunch of singles), Omicron Complex, and the Dig Trax series by FIAB, but I believe there is/was a dl for 2 of the Dig Trax albums on the reddit somewhere. Torrents with Random Chaos exist, but they're pretty much dead.  Also, if you want PRE-Vulpvibe stuff here's Plastic with Audio, Renard, the self-titled album and Deleted  EDIT: Found the links to Dig Trax 1&2! http://stuff.warchamp7.ca/Uploads/Lapfox/Physical_Collection/"

A shame because it was a very nice catalogue, having it all in one place.  I also know what you mean about needing to have a complete archive of some topic, it bothers me a lot but I figure I'm gonna have to start buying tape drives if I really want to archive everything I want so I don't bother. Also part of why I still buy CDs and refuse to put money down for digital files most of the time, though even that is getting harder because Amazon is starting to cell CD-Rs burned on-demand and CD-R's don't hardly last more than 5-10 years before rotting beyond playability, plus I could literally make my own too if that's the case."

lapfoxtrax,3d78cm,DJVee210,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:13:51 2015 UTC,"I'm less certain on the more general inspirations (though they are expounded on a bit in a linked post elsewhere here), I am fairly sure on the inspiration for the Aliases over a single entity, as other people were inspired by the same person and techniques: Naoki Maeda, former in-house music producer for Konami.  In the first Dance Dance Revolution, Maeda composed three songs, all under unique aliases that would have later contributions, though occasionally the names would change with song iterations (180's ""PARANOiA"" was followed by ""PARANOiA MAX (DIRTY MIX)"" by 190, for example). From DDR to DDR 2013, Maeda had accrued dozens of aliases, though a few were certainly more used than others.  Maeda not only influenced others in his company to utilize aliases as well, but other in-house rhythm producers too. Kyle Ward of In The Groove+ReRave fame is another example, and I've always held the notion that Ren was similarly influenced by Naoki, due to the original Aliases being born out of Mungyodance.  While Naoki Maeda wasn't the first in-house producer to use separate aliases to fluff a songlist (that honor goes to Reo Nagumo on beatmania the 1st), he was certainly the one to popularize the concept, and influence others to do the same whenever they operated outside of their ""typical"" genres."

lapfoxtrax,3d0pta,Mezgrman,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:19:11 2015 UTC,Alternate Reality Game or Augmented Reality Game.
lapfoxtrax,3d0pta,gammaTHETA,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:52:29 2015 UTC,"Alternate reality game:       An alternate reality game or augmented reality game (ARG) is an interactive networked narrative that uses the real world as a platform and uses transmedia storytelling to deliver a story that may be altered by players' ideas or actions.  The form is defined by intense player involvement with a story that takes place in real time and evolves according to players' responses. Subsequently, it is shaped by characters that are actively controlled by the game's designers, as opposed to being controlled by artificial intelligence as in a computer or console video game. Players interact directly with characters in the game, solve plot-based challenges and puzzles, and collaborate as a community to analyze the story and coordinate real-life and online activities. ARGs generally use multimedia, such as telephones, email and mail but rely on the Internet as the central binding medium.  ARGs are growing in popularity, with new games appearing regularly and an increasing amount of experimentation with new models and subgenres. They tend to be free to play, with costs absorbed either through supporting products (e.g. collectible puzzle cards fund Perplex City) or through promotional relationships with existing products (for example, I Love Bees was a promotion for Halo 2, and the Lost Experience and Find 815 promoted the television show Lost). However, pay-to-play models are not unheard of.

And negativity can be good if its contructive. If they are telling you why your music isn't up to their standards, at least them have a reason. Also, something that you should be focusing on, which is kinda difficult at first is that, is to make music to make yourself happy and not everyone else. Also, if it is towards your past mistakes, try to move on. Everyone evoles and learns as a human being and if something bad happened in the past, don't try to let it dictate your future. If it comes down to it try to ignore what anyone has to say and learn by yourself. I didn't really release an album, or really put anything on bandcamp until I thought I was ready and I had enough confidence to deal with whatever criticism I may get. I hope this helps."

What You Do encapsulates feelings I've had, that are so difficult to put to words, with melodic graphic metaphor.   Relationships are weird. They cut up parts of your life, and sometimes you have to make room, so to speak.  More so than in making time for someone else, or pushing the laundry off of the bed, but some deeper sociomechanical underpinning.   That being said I'm not sure the seemingly one sided sacrificial relationship depicted in What You Do would be considered a healthy one.   Probably why it resonates with me so well.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Lyrics:   ""Everybody is gonna be happy / be happy you're gonna make you so happy / so happy  the stitches didn't hold  my blood is running cold you're tearing into me  you're happy as can be  the line is formed with red  my eyes roll back in my head  you're tearing me away  i'm fine, or so i say  your hands are warm against my heart  unlike the knife you used to cut  the hole you fill so comfortably  but now i'm pouring out my guts  i will make room i'll empty out  i'll make sure you can move about  i'll change my everything for you  just keep on doing what you do""   *edit because u/Dainathon is nice"
lapfoxtrax,3c86vb,Devon148,4,Sun Jul 5 20:55:50 2015 UTC,"What you've said so far pretty much sums up my view of this song.

Taiko Drum Master only recieved one game in the US, and it was on PS2. However, games have still been made in Japan for several years now.  The reason this video repeats the same thing three times is, well, actually: It isn't.  Each chart after each repeat gets much worse. The first chart is your standard Oni (Devil/Hell difficulty) chart. The second chart is Ura Oni, a even harder version of Onis. The last one I'm just gonna call Absolute Oni, which is harder than ALL of them. Good luck playing this on one of these things.  I don't know if this guy has a download to the chart, but if you wanna try out Taikojiro, grab a copy from here. Some charts can be found here, but don't try the pack link. It's been down for months, possibly even years, and I don't know when the owner's gonna fix it.  Anyways, enjoy!"

lapfoxtrax,3bh2bs,cpguy5089,3,Mon Jun 29 09:47:45 2015 UTC,"You can customize Brawl with nearly anything nowadays and custom music was one of the first things people figured out how to implement. You take a .wav file and using brawlbox.exe, convert it into a .brstm which is essentially a looping .wav which Brawl will recognize and play for you. The download contains a bunch of .brstms for lapfox songs.  The mod I'm using is Project M which already does a bunch of the complicated stuff for you and you just need to drag the files into the right folders. The download comes with some .txt files to help out newcomers. Believe it or not, Twilite Funk now comes with the newest download of Project M and is placed over smashville thanks to the link with /u/warchamp7 which is pretty cool.  In the newest version of PM it's really easy to put little pictures over the menus which you see me do at the beginning of the video. Images need to be 256x128 pixels in order to display properly. The left ear on the vulpvibe logo is a little messed up still, I thought I fixed that but it might be a compression issue.  Hope this helps!  (IIRC The Sound was an extremely popular song featured in a lot of people's music packs back around 2010, random side note. We're also getting close to modifying custom music into the 3DS version of Sm4sh, it's been done already but only by subbing in the music into the iso file. We'll probably be able to manipulate the music files in the Wii U version like we can in Brawl in under 2 years I think)"

I listened to his music for 4+ years now and he is very easily on my top 2 or 3 favorite artists of all time. I would tell you to go listen to one of my ""favorite"" albums of his, but they're all so great it's so fucking hard to choose...  Gah sorry I'm kinda fanboying over C418 right now, I just don't ever have anyone to talk to that listens to and enjoys his music as much as I do ;-;"
lapfoxtrax,3ak1dj,AGR360,2,Wed Jun 24 08:30:33 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm already intending on listening to EVERYTHING he has. He's an amazing artist, just a pity I only really heard of him because of Minecraft's soundtrack (Which is incredible). Kinda wish I'd found him sooner."
lapfoxtrax,3ak1dj,Devon148,2,Wed Jun 24 09:44:42 2015 UTC,"Oh trust me, I had only heard of him because of the Minecraft soundtrack.   Most of the time I discover artists as a result of a sort of ""domino effect"" (I guess?) whereas I hear a song I like in something and it just sparks this chain of events where I end up looking that song, love the artists, and then find more artists related to the one I just listened to.   On a different note, I discovered C418 way back in my early years of middle school/late years of elementary school and it was pretty much my first exposure to electronic music. From then on it was Aphex Twin, Disasterpeace, various Homestuck albums, and now Lapfox I guess."
lapfoxtrax,3ak1dj,AGR360,2,Wed Jun 24 10:08:38 2015 UTC,"Heh, I only found Lapfox because people kept micspamming it in the server that I was an admin of (To be precise this was back in 2010 and the track was Conquest by FIAB). It kind of snowballed from there, because prior to that I only really liked Punk Rock and Melodic Metal (I still like those genres, if it wasn't obvious) but yeah, I grew to like electronic music."

lapfoxtrax,3ak1dj,ulalsuns,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:57:13 2015 UTC,"hmm, that's quite a tall order to fill out.  i'd say i'm incredibly fond of AFS+ by Oliver Arcane, and Exposition by Petriform, both being the same artist.  Enter Shikari is another band i hugely adore too. what album i like the most i'm unsure about. i got into them by listening to their first album, Take To The Skies, but i also like their later stuff, which has a huge tonal shift compared to their first album. if you like post-hardcore, then Take To The Skies is basically all that, but if you like it with more electronic influences thrown in, then their later albums, such as Common Dreads and A Flashflood of Colour, should be more up your alley. Graz is another great breakcore artist if you like some of the old Renard stuff like Trauma, This Place Will Grow, etc. i highly recommend Sounds of the Plunderground, i bought the CD blind and man was it a shockingly good surprise. if you don't mind him being a brony, General Mumble is basically British Renard. Daemien's Lilith in Exscintion is one of my personal favorites from them, and Monsters and Magic EP is also really great, if you don't mind the MLP samplings in them.  uhh, there's definitely more artists i adore, but if i spent time listing all of them here, i'd be here for a really fucking long time lol."

lapfoxtrax,39b2vv,mallo15,10,Wed Jun 10 15:27:21 2015 UTC,"I don't brigade them or anything, but a LOT of their posts used to be just self-promoting. Casual references to their own works at questionably relevant times. They also used to post a lot of their own work on the sub, which while is completely within the rules, it was a disproportionate amount compared to other content. (Edit: just checked, they haven't been doing this lately. All their music posts have been to appropriate subs, and not in disproportionate volume).  I would also say they at least used to (do not know now) seem to want to get attention for the wrong reasons. Specifically, self-affirmation and popularity, instead of just for the love of music. Combined with making pretty niche / challenging music, and being constantly self deprecating, it made for a pretty unenjoyable combo.  I have not seen this behavior lately. So I guess they just have a ""fan club."" /s"
lapfoxtrax,39b2vv,slippy0,-6,Wed Jun 10 16:27:29 2015 UTC,"Definately a fan club. Even in small proportions. APPARENTLY, I lately get the attention of a few. For MAYBE the right reasons. Since SPAM the Q et al happened, I always looked to have a bit of fun with music that I quite like more and sound better to me.  THE ONLY PROBLEM, and maybe that's why I wanted to get attention for those wrong reasons, is that someday I have to live from what I do there aside of my regular job (which pays me too little to live on my own), and that's a main reason why I upped a Patreon campaign (which announcement video got downvoted massively for some reason). I still live with my parents, but as I said in the last Patreon video, I need to move from there to somewhere else, if not soon, someday, given that this building is going down one of these years.  But that's not important to anyone here, because it's just for anyone who's a real follower of me and I'm not even forcing you to do it."
lapfoxtrax,39b2vv,JMAAMusic,3,Thu Jun 11 07:18:09 2015 UTC,"Psst, notice the comment's author wrote ""fan club"" instead of just fan club."
lapfoxtrax,39b2vv,JMAAMusic,-2,Thu Jun 11 12:50:48 2015 UTC,I know because it isn't as big as that yet.
lapfoxtrax,39b2vv,JMAAMusic,6,Thu Jun 11 12:51:24 2015 UTC,"No, no, fan club as a limited number of people who constantly downvote you. I think..."
lapfoxtrax,39b2vv,JMAAMusic,-2,Thu Jun 11 12:52:13 2015 UTC,"Oh.  Honestly I still have a few fans. And apparently it keeps growing steadily.  TBH I still feel proud of my few fans, even if there's not so many. Still love 'em."
lapfoxtrax,39b2vv,Wurzbe,2,Thu Jun 11 12:52:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I am aware. I like your stuff, you have potential"
lapfoxtrax,39b2vv,JMAAMusic,-2,Thu Jun 11 12:56:53 2015 UTC,Though I have the assumption somehow that it some of them must be Facepunch for some reason. Not to worry about because it seems to be like 2-3 downvoters.
lapfoxtrax,39b2vv,LettucePie,2,Thu Jun 11 13:08:35 2015 UTC,"Eww, Facepunch"
lapfoxtrax,39b2vv,JMAAMusic,6,Thu Jun 11 14:36:43 2015 UTC,"I can understand people downvoting Jmaa for a variety of reasons. I'm pretty sure their first patreon video was trying to be an exact copy of Ren's patreon video but they later changed it and I think they removed it, you can still see them kind of copy Ren's thumbnail here though: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH3y9vbCqBE  Also they photoshopped their own face onto a picture of Ren here: https://soundcloud.com/jmaamusic/rq-touch-touch-jmaa-ultra-trap-edit . I get that they are trying to be funny by doing this but it just comes off as creepy considering how much they try to copy Ren's stuff. I completely understand people getting inspiration from Ren but they are literally trying to copy things.  Also they are not being very truthful in their explanation on why they need patreon supporters so bad because they seem to be supporting a lot of people on patreon which is fine, but they claim they need the money really bad to support themselves and to buy gear but if they needed the money that bad why are they supporting so many other people?(I'm pretty sure supporting means giving them money on patreon but I am not sure I have never used patreon.)  So as an answer to your question, no. It is not some type of organized bullying. I have no clue why you even made this post because if you go to his reddit submitted history you can see that they get banned and downvoted on a lot of other subreddits than just this one for the same reasons over and over again, spamming self promotion, being rude, etc.  This is just my opinion and speculation on why people may be downvoting along with the obvious spam and personal posts and stuff."
lapfoxtrax,39b2vv,LettucePie,2,Thu Jun 11 18:11:27 2015 UTC,I noticed the similarities too. I guess he took This Place Will Grow's release text too literally lol  Also I made this post because I was curious. The point was people downvote related content too.
lapfoxtrax,39b2vv,viscram,-2,Thu Jun 11 19:31:40 2015 UTC,"I'm supporting all those people because I still have a salary behind from my day job. Not much, but at least I try to keep it minimum. Every month I get like around $400 every month and, considering the situation here, it's not enough to sustain a life on my own (I need to rent, get food, pay bills, etc. alongside with other costs, that is, gear and stuff). On the positive side of things, this is quite enough to sustain a few things, but not too much. Also I tend to get broke very often and very soon.  But yeah, it needs some cleanup. (It's not much still, it's just $20 something monthly.)  About copying Ren's stuff, I think I quitted doing that a while ago. I think however that I should not spam anymore on Reddit. Because reasons.  (I feel like a total ass self-affirmating myself here and even posting here, but seriously I feel myself being brigaded)"
lapfoxtrax,39b2vv,viscram,5,Fri Jun 12 07:34:06 2015 UTC,"Jmaa used to over promote, then one day people got sick of it and straight up told him to stop. That post has since been deleted (don't know if mods or jmaa). I tried explaining to them that reddit is where people share things they found or made related to the sub they're on. So I recommended they just make one solid statement saying ""Hey I make lapfox remixes and other similar style musics, check me out at my soundcloud sometime"" and to just leave it at that.  It was at the point where they were sharing almost everything they make even if it wasn't Lapfox related... So the community unsurprisingly got upset."
lapfoxtrax,39b2vv,JMAAMusic,2,Wed Jun 10 20:18:57 2015 UTC,I see.
lapfoxtrax,39b2vv,Dainathon,-3,Wed Jun 10 20:53:53 2015 UTC,"I just had to learn that the hard way, so yeah.  I still post Lapfox remixes because I think they're at least related in something, even if that implies I have to post my own Soundcloud or Bandcamp, which I still think is ugly."
lapfoxtrax,39b2vv,DDMythicalB3ast,2,Thu Jun 11 07:50:26 2015 UTC,People change to other's changing... So I'm sure all tension will eventually be forgotten.  Time n shit yo
lapfoxtrax,39b2vv,Schplitzkriegs,5,Thu Jun 11 10:59:16 2015 UTC,"probably the attention-grabbing thing. idk if he still do that but it got himself banned on another forum, many years ago. i was mildly surprised to find him here doing the same thing.  that's all i'll say about it."
lapfoxtrax,39b2vv,Dioxids,-1,Wed Jun 10 17:58:49 2015 UTC,many years ago   Everyone deserves a second chance :/
lapfoxtrax,39b2vv,JMAAMusic,3,Wed Jun 10 18:07:31 2015 UTC,"granted, but taken from the comments i read here, and the amount of downvotes he gets anyway, suffice to say some people have a hard time learning from their actions."

lapfoxtrax,399zxe,pariasa,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:09:43 2015 UTC,"iirc they said that part of the reason they made TVK was because the fans wanted more FIAB, even though it wasn't necessarily what they wanted to make at the time.  as a result, it wasn't as good as it could have been otherwise."

lapfoxtrax,390n8r,VialOfBile,3,Mon Jun 8 15:38:08 2015 UTC,As the creator of the BUTTCORE remix I agree.
lapfoxtrax,390n8r,dralienguy,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:28:20 2015 UTC,The intro and outro were kind of cut out after the decision of splitting to 3 volumes due to the sheer amount of content.
lapfoxtrax,390n8r,dralienguy,2,Mon Jun 8 16:00:10 2015 UTC,Joey Zero's remix of I updated my F list is really awesome. This one is really unique

lapfoxtrax,390n8r,emrakull,2,Mon Jun 8 18:09:05 2015 UTC,"After sifting through everything I can safely say that Concordia's remix of Outsider shines out above the rest. Entirely unique take, the new chord progression for the vocal melody works outstandingly, clean mix too."

I love that even though I may not be a fan of some of what you put out, the stuff that I do enjoy, I love. It's a shame that this album won't be finished, because in my unprofessional/inexperienced opinion as an off/on fan, this is my favorite thing from you that I've ever listened too.

lapfoxtrax,38u7ua,ulalsuns,24,Sat Jun 6 21:32:22 2015 UTC,"i figured there'd be some outrage / scrutiny / something over this (imagine my own, what with making almost a thousand dollars less than it says i should be). the ""Name Your Price at $2500 pledged"" goal is on hold because that pledge count is the amount of subscribers and their pledges - not the actual amount that goes through every month, after declines (credit card / paypal payment declines, for example), fees, etc.  from Patreon directly, as i contacted them about this: ""I can see that a high number of your patrons have seen their pledges decline on recent posts. We are going to be revamping our payment system later this year to hopefully reduce the number of declines that occur on our site. In the meantime, please know that we send a message to each patron who sees a decline, with instructions on how to update their payment information.""  https://i.imgur.com/TCPzIj0.png and a screenshot of actual earnings. $592 of the current pledges were declined this month (PayPal, credit card, etc issues); Patreon's fees are minimal, but seeing as it's doubled up with credit card fees, you can see it's not all that pretty. i am indeed making nearly $1000 less than it says i am.  so that's why, what, and how. i mentioned this in a patreon post to everybody there, and the responses were overall encouraging and that this goal isn't a big deal. if you're somebody sitting on the outside waiting for the goal to be met so you can get free music, i don't blame you for being a little miffed (as totally entitled as that is for you to be). it's what i want to do, but this makes it difficult.  that much monthly doesn't cover my combined expenses every month (rent, utilities, transit, groceries), and once everything goes name your price, i expect to be spending at least a couple hundred every month on download credits for people that milk that.  i hope this clears things up."

lapfoxtrax,38u7ua,FefnirM,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:29:16 2015 UTC,"I'm sure with your post that you're addressing everyone who may be wondering, but speaking to you personally, I'll say I'm not bothered by this, it comes more as a surprise and confusion than anything. It's completely understandable that you would not be ready to make the switch if your earnings are not what they should be, and it's good to let people know if what they're seeing is inaccurate. I hope my mentioning of the issue and questioning just helps others understand what's going on if they see and expect something to happen when things aren't ready for it to happen yet."

lapfoxtrax,38tobs,aGIFTedTroll,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:17:02 2015 UTC,"But what if I prefer the sky? :P  The lyrics/vocals are pretty (ok, very) meh but if there were instrumentals it (or at least only a few songs, most of it is ehhh but some do stick out) would probably end up as one of my favorite lapfox albums.  For example, She's An Angel has ups and downs that are honestly kinda cliche as far as electronic music goes but yet that + the choice of cheesy synths is exactly what I personally like to hear. Same with the synth near the beginning of Amber Starlight.  Mostly I like it because it (and a lot of 'early' lapfox stuff from the late 2000s that's not too hardcore/horribly clipped) could easily fit into a video game soundtrack, especially with some simple dynamic mixing based on action."

The top result will probably be an album that the same people who voted on it would rank fairly high after listening to the whole list for the first time. Because the actually bad albums, nobody cares about those, nobody really remembers how they sound and nobody will vote on them.  or maybe not, i'm not a statistician"
