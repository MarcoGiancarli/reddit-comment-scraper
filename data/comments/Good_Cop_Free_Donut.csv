Good_Cop_Free_Donut,3dmple,tardis777,-1,Sat Jul 18 00:35:42 2015 UTC,"Many Vancouver cops are the biggest jock douche drinkers you'd ever meet. However, there are a few in the DTES who go above and beyond and are very good to the people down there.   One story - I was working the front desk of one of the SRO hotels down there and the cops ran up on this crack dealer at the Carnegie. They cuffed him, but before they could,  he tossed his stash on the pavement, possibly to retrieve later.  He stayed cuffed against the car and as the roving horde of crackheads descended on the scattered Easter egg hunt of crack vials, the 2 arresting cops got out their flashlights and started helping people find this guy's product. I actually heard the cop say ""Oh, here's one! Come on, people!"""

Good_Cop_Free_Donut,3djhfa,kahzaa,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:51:03 2015 UTC,Hi Sergeant Wood. I want your perspective on two things:  One do you think the Baltimore 6 will be found guilty?  Two as a law enforcement officer do you believe Baltimore is worse or about the same when it comes to police abuse? From what I can tell Baltimore is typically much more hands on and abusive then the average department.

I think whats best to remember is that they are people too, sometimes bad people and sometimes just a person making a mistake. I will say though, the Law Enforcement career path tends to attract more violent people than it should."

Good_Cop_Free_Donut,3dia17,Boston_Jason,3,Thu Jul 16 15:41:53 2015 UTC,98% of cops are good guys. I know a couple irl. The issue is just that the 2% who are assholes don't have special uniforms or blinking neon signs or anything so that you can tell which they are.
