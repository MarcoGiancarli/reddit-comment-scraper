lgg4,3e412y,radddchaddd,3,Wed Jul 22 00:13:27 2015 UTC,Where did you drop from and onto what? I've dropped mine a few times and I guess I'm lucky.

lgg4,3e412y,getpatriotized,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:27:18 2015 UTC,Yeah it was all that was available on launch day. The true irony is my glass screen protector arrived not 30 minutes after this happened. True story.
lgg4,3e412y,TheGoodDrFunkyFresh,-1,Wed Jul 22 00:08:00 2015 UTC,I've had a plastic screen protector. It does nothing if you drop it on the corner. It  bends the metal and then cracks the screen. Source: dropped two g3s.
lgg4,3e412y,afyaff,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:46:37 2015 UTC,"I hate cases, especially on this LGG4 leather back _.  I just put a tempered glass screen over mine from Amazon.  The glass cracked ever so slightly at the bottom when I dropped mine on a treadmill (was watching a video at a hotel and the stand was slim - not to mentioned the curved screen thing but I digress).  Best $5-10 I ever spent.  I haven't even replaced it yet.  Glass screens are great - they absorb even asphalt impact.  Read reviews of different people and you will get an idea.  Even cases may not save your screen from being cracked when dropped depending on how it landed."

Third one was okay but it would lag and randomly restart. My G4 has no problems and is the best phone I've owned so far.  Battery life is better on my G4, too."
lgg4,3e43gn,btow1105,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:51:00 2015 UTC,Do you miss the S6's fingerprint sensor or even the S6's screen? (not sure how much better the G4's screen is in actual usage)
lgg4,3e43gn,xeron72548,4,Wed Jul 22 02:52:00 2015 UTC,"I switched. I love this phone. There is no lag on the G4 and you can actually multitask on this phone. I also LOVE the battery on the G4. I can do about 4 hours SOT daily while on the S6, I was always about 2.5 hours SOT. The standby time on the G4 is also far superior than that on the S6. I would leave my S6 at about 25% before I went to sleep and would wake up to a dead phone. However, on the G4, I only lose about 3-4% overnight.   The G4 is by far by favorite phone that I have owned."
lgg4,3e43gn,booboouser,3,Tue Jul 21 21:15:41 2015 UTC,"I did!  G4 seems smoother so far. Camera seems to be a wash but probably not used it enough yet.   Battery life seems on a par so far, although that could be because the phone has only cycled a couple of times.   Build quality is inferior and overall I preferred the S6 (which I still have)   Don't like the g4 size, I think it's a little big for me, I have the black leather back and there is a gap between the cover and the phone. Plus dust and gunk has caught in the recesses and makes the phone look cheap.   I am still torn as to which to keep."
lgg4,3e43gn,BadNewsBrown,3,Tue Jul 21 21:42:50 2015 UTC,"I switched.  The removeable battery was what sold me.  I do miss the form factor of the S6, but that battery life was terrible."
lgg4,3e43gn,jacoballen22,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:55:02 2015 UTC,"Removable battery has never really appealed to me. The microSD slot and bigger screen are what are making me consider switching the most. I'm just afraid I'll miss little things like the fingerprint sensor and eventually Samsung Pay.  Is there any noticeable difference in the screens of the two phones? Seems like the S6 screen is, on paper, way ahead of the G4, especially in outdoor usage."
lgg4,3e43gn,shpilkus2,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:48:25 2015 UTC,Just got about 13 hours and 3:46 SOT and was at 2℅. I was gonna get the s6 but I heard about bad battery. So I came from iPhone 6 instead and I'm glad I did.

I am goading my Father into upgrading so I can give him the set.  I am doing just fine with the two batteries swapping in the cradle.  This should save my G4 the fate my M7 suffered from the charging port on the phone wearing out.  The memory card seems less useful, a good portion of apps will only off-load minimal data to the card."

lgg4,3e0znq,Artren,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:22:46 2015 UTC,It says that it's able to. The comments section makes me feel it's a bit crap as build quality seems to be low. Personally I'd recommend getting a cable from LG itself. Even find them on Amazon for a cheaper price.
lgg4,3e0znq,Artren,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:40:46 2015 UTC,Sounds good. Is the cable it came with not able to handle 2.4A because I've tried that with the anker and haven't gotten better results.

lgg4,3e0dql,thesandman87,7,Tue Jul 21 00:04:34 2015 UTC,"Do it! The G4, albeit a bit on the simple side, is a wonderful phone. Yes, it doesn't have the sexy materials of the iP6 or the SG6, but the use you can get out of this phone is crazy! Removable battery is a big plus, as I can last for about a week on 3 fully charged batteries, which is great for camping trips. Micro SD capability is also a plus, as I have a lot of music on my card right now (>30GB). The screen is absolutely beautiful, and the double-tap-to-wake feature is now a reflex for me.  TL;DR: Get the G4, you won't be disappointed!"
lgg4,3e0dql,tiharo,2,Tue Jul 21 01:43:55 2015 UTC,I agree it's an awesome phone! Somehow missed the double tap to wake feature. Thanks :)
lgg4,3e0dql,WeAreTheEmpire,4,Tue Jul 21 10:54:09 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're taking a serious look at moving back to Android, and the G4 and S6 are definitely the front runners right now.  Go with the G4. I use a G4 personally, but I work for Samsung and deal with the S6 on a daily basis. Despite Samsung's touted re-design, the G4 is, I think, a much prettier phone with the leather back and slight curves. The S6 has had fundamental software problems since launch that still haven't been addressed. Compound this with how absolutely god-awful Samsung's implementation of lollipop was on the S5 and it's really looking like Samsung is just getting worse and worse at the software side of things.  The G4, despite boasting less impressive hardware overall, just works. It's fast, easy, and damn it looks pretty sitting on your desk. I've used an LG phone since the G2 and had the chance to use a Samsung phone for comparison each generation. Without fail it took me 1-2 months to go back to the LG."
lgg4,3e0dql,Hugspeced,3,Tue Jul 21 04:58:51 2015 UTC,"If you want a more familiar experience to your iPhone, the S6 is probably the one because it has similar looks, feels, and features like the fingerprint sensor. However, with the G4 you get more functionality through storage expansion and removable battery, also not to mention the free promo through July."
lgg4,3e0dql,fudgechan,2,Tue Jul 21 02:47:02 2015 UTC,"I made a jump from ios as well, miss how simple things were. They just did the job they're suppose to do. But im liking the g4 as well. When i used the multi window feature while calculating stuff and writing them down at the same time without switching apps, that's when i was really impressed."
lgg4,3e0dql,ishaan1992,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:40:16 2015 UTC,"I think IOS has been behind Android for the past few years in terms of camera and performance in general. I personally can't stand being SO boxed into an OS. I think Android, without being rooted, is VERY VERY flexible. You don't like something, you can change 95% of it without need to hack anything!   I have had the Nexus 6, Note 4 and LG G4. I'm keeping the G4 because it offers the best of everything. It's very fast. It's very reliable. Battery life is fantastic compared to others. Also, it has expandable storage, a superb camera, very fluid.   I can honestly say that Android is superior to iOS in EVERYTHING except for simplicity. That is something Apple got down - it's super simple to use, no fuss, no options, nothing to fiddle with. Want a folder? Sure. Want to change your background? Great... That's it!  The G4 gives you that SAME experience with Simple mode, and it allows you to do SO much more :) Great great great device. I can HIGHLY recommend the G4.   Oh, and get the plastic /ceramic versions if you want to save a cow :) haha."

I'm noticing a real tangible difference in battery usage, and strongly recommend people give it a look even if you're using your phone un-rooted. Whilst I haven't done anything huge with my phone today, it has been connected to my Pebble since being taken off charge, mirroring notifications all morning (Pebble and Pushbullet), playing music through bluetooth in my car and some messaging here and there.

lgg4,3dz1i9,EntropismAtWork,4,Mon Jul 20 19:55:40 2015 UTC,"Well, the T-Mobile one can be rooted, and ROMs are available.  You're also buying a year old phone, vs LG's latest & greatest.  I would personally wait 2 months or so for the new Nexus announcement, but that's just me.  The Note 4 is a great phone with AOSP though, with a great camera.  I don't think you'd lose either way."

The snapdragons will ALWAYS have more development, that's why the note and the G4 will be fine.  It's also why I never mentioned the Note 5, which will be a mess for roms."
lgg4,3dz1i9,zkyevolved,0,Mon Jul 20 20:25:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah but it usually takes a month or two for the bootloader unlock and then a few more months for device source to be completed, and then even longer for actual roms to pop up."

I loved a lot of things about that phone and would have loved to have brought it over when I returned but I knew it did not support the LTE bands that Sprint uses in the US.  I picked the G4 as my upgrade from an M7 because of screen and camera quality, hand feel, replaceable battery and the newness meaning support for the future.  I really miss the stylus, I think Samsung did a better job of split screen and the Edge gimmick was cool at first but I stopped leaving my phone on top of stuff just to force the Edge to be useful.  The main point that nearly had me going back to the Note 4 Edge, other than the stylus, was the fingerprint scanner.  If mobile payments ever truly take off I want multi-factor authentication."

I couldn't be happier. I never had trouble with battery life but I'm getting 5 hrs of SOT.  I believe it's all the stupid tmobile and lg shit that's slowing down the phone. Only don't disable com.lge.leccp, it's for receiving texts and mms.

The FM radio is indeed inside the phone, but T-Mo, Verizon, and AT&T all disable them so that you have to pay for their data to steam radio apps rather than allow you to listen to FM radio for free. Carriers have been doing this for years on almost all phones. True story.  Petitions exist online asking carriers to re-enable them, but have been unsuccessful to this point."

lgg4,3dvwz6,SWOLEGASM,0,Mon Jul 20 17:15:50 2015 UTC,"The radio is more than an antenna. If it wasn't, your headphones would pick up radio signals all the time even without a phone, yes? There is an actual FM module chip soldered to the motherboard inside your phone and that's what carriers disable (yes, your headphones function as an antenna, but there is an actual FM chip inside the phone too which is what's doing most of the work). Sometimes they disable it via the kernel, but most often the carriers ground one of the power pins to it so that it essentially doesn't even get electricity to function, thereby fully disabling it."
lgg4,3dvwz6,brosif_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:58:57 2015 UTC,"Great. Sounds like T-Mobile is not disabling the radio inside the device, then. I mistook your comment for the radio chip vs the feature as a whole (the app is just FM radio)"

We've all grown up and dont need the morning zoo, howard stern, christian radio, fox news, don imus, npr or whatever slant you select. Radio listeners are sheep who are too lazy to come up with their own taste & ideas. Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, r5 --- really, that's the best art we can come up with? Worse is 'classic rock hits' programming that has worn the grooves out of the same shit for 40 years because the royalties are so stupid low.  Face it, programmed commercial radio is, and has been for years, more manipulated than anything cell services can think up.  If radio on your cell was important to anyone other than to a niche few enthusiasts, it wouldnt be in the same situation place on your cell as ham radio receivers.    Now that said, go get an HTC One M8 unlocked from BHPhoto and listen to your free FM data.  :p"

Streaming services go offline and don't work for emergency information, radio always does. 3) I paid the same price for my phone with a disabled radio as the international guys paid for their phone with a working one? Are you always cool with corporations making your decisions for you and taking away free options without your input just because they want to?

The camera may be great but it's an incredibly moot point considering the only thing I see when I hit playback is an outline of my face. It might be a bonus if I looked like Brad Pitt but unfortunately I look like Brad Pitt if his face got stuck in a hornets nest.   The battery life is worse than my HTC One M7 and that phone is 2 years old. Yes, having a removable battery is nice (it should also be standard on every phone but that's a different argument all together) but I would still expect my battery experience to be better on a phone that's close to 3 years newer than my previous phone.   I get a serious echo when I use my phone through bluetooth on a speaker device that I have and through my LG Tone Pro's. I've used 2 other phones with these devices and the G4 is the only one I've had an issue with.   The LAG on this phone is absolutely absurd. Everything is so glitchy and slow. The keyboard is absolutely dreadful. The amount of mistakes I make trying to send someone a text is unprecedented. I've never had to deal with any of this type of lag in any of the previous phones I've owned. I play around a lot with my gf's phone (iPhone 6) and she doesn't have this problem. I've spent a lot of time with my friends S6 and he doesn't have that issue either.   This is a terrible phone."

I had the black leather version with the silver buttons.  I brought it in to Verizon after having it for 2 weeks to show them.  They said they would give me a new phone but that they could only give me a replacement plastic back version (or I keep my back and they give me the plastic version front with different color back buttons).  They recommended calling the national store and maybe they would have more options.    After talking to the lady for 2 hours trying to debug my phone, she finally contacts LG and I think that I am going to get a new black leather phone / or at least my phone fixed.  LG says that I have to send my phone in for repair and they will give me a return shipping label....the label came in and it was for ground shipping....  so 3 weeks later I got my phone back (this past friday)..It says that they just changed the flash memory inside of it but you can tell it is a completely different phone, and it is the plastic back version of the phone, you can tell by the rear button colors.  The odd part is that the receipt from LG says that the serial number of the phone they received is the same as the serial number of the phone that they shipped back.  I am not sure how that is possible since it has a brand new screen (can tell because it no longer has my tempered glass screen cover) and the buttons are the brownish grey type instead of the silver."

lgg4,3dvbxp,Martin2014,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:24:56 2015 UTC,I just had my Sprint LG G4 unlocked and it was not by code. Sprint pushed the unlock over the air. They did give me a 6 digit code known as MSL code that helps program the phone. You may have that code.
lgg4,3dvbxp,Martin2014,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:37:29 2015 UTC,Hmm so they just did it for you? Did you have a Sprint account?
lgg4,3dvbxp,Martin2014,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:54:41 2015 UTC,I dont have an account and never have been a customer. I chatted online 3 times to only receive the  MSL code. Then I called twice and on the second time the rep took my meid-dec and was able to unlock it within 5 minutes.
lgg4,3dvbxp,Martin2014,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:59:46 2015 UTC,hmmm; I might be able to find the MSL code myself through other means to speed up the process; did you call International or just regular Sprint customer line for the final unlocking? What'd you say to them xD
lgg4,3dvbxp,Martin2014,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:02:44 2015 UTC,Regular Sprint line. I just said i wanted to unlock a phone i paid for in full before activating it. Some reps will lie but just keep trying until you get someone helpful.
lgg4,3dvbxp,RedDevil525,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:04:46 2015 UTC,Yeah both of mine shipped me off to the International department as soon as I said unlocking :/
lgg4,3dvbxp,Martin2014,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:29:24 2015 UTC,Call sprint and say you want to activate a phone. Once you get a person say you want to domestic sim unlock and maybe they can transfer you to the correct person.

She said it'll be unlocked over the air very sooon and that i'll get a text when it is but I don't have any service activated or number for this phone so how will I get it? ._.  The Sprint Sim Card is in the phone right now but I haven't done anything with it. How did it work for you?  Edit: I also have a weird phone number now? 000-000-8785?

lgg4,3duc4n,residue69,2,Sun Jul 19 15:54:59 2015 UTC,"Install QuickShortcutMaker and dig around in there.  You may have to set the stock launcher as default to get to the hidden menus.  You can search in QuickShortcutMaker, but it's not the best, and only Normal Search works for me.  I frequently have to put a space after the word I'm searching for, click search, then backspace and search again.  I know I've had this screen up and done the Device Test, but I don't remember what it was I opened.  There's a ton of hidden menu options, but a lot of them don't work and many require the stock launcher."

lgg4,3dv1yj,If-,5,Sun Jul 19 19:22:54 2015 UTC,"What a assinine test. In what scenario will you need to 8 fingers on the screen?  As its been mentioned before the stock keyboard doesn't respond well to touches and you'll see some missed touches there.   After removing that I've not had any missed touches that I can notice.   I also had the S6 edge. By all means lag, memory issues, and battery life issues should scare you a lot more than a missed touch. All 3 issues are prevalent on the S6."
lgg4,3dv1yj,Ashish879,4,Sun Jul 19 19:33:17 2015 UTC,Failing the test might indicate that there is something wrong with your screen. I can't get past 6 and I miss 40% of my taps with swipes that register as taps.  On the note about S6 everything can be fixed via software whereas this touch issue is not confirmed software or hardware.
lgg4,3dv1yj,AegisValour,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:16:47 2015 UTC,"everything can be fixed via software.   Yup, I'm sure that's what everyone was saying till 5.1 dropped and then all the issues were still there.  This is Android folks. Don't buy your phone on future value.  Look at the Nexus 5, lollipop dropped and the memory leak ruined the whole experience till 5.1 fixed it."
lgg4,3dv1yj,Ashish879,2,Mon Jul 20 02:22:36 2015 UTC,That's a good point. I didn't really consider the premise that test was based on. Have you noticed issues with double tap to wake or other missed touches beyond the keyboard?
lgg4,3dv1yj,Ashish879,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:43:00 2015 UTC,"sometimes double tap to wake will take me more than one double tap, but that's not different than when I had the G2 & the G3."
lgg4,3dv1yj,gainkiller,2,Sun Jul 19 20:09:28 2015 UTC,If you cover the top of the phone with your hand from about an inch or less double tap to wake will not work.  The part where the speaker and front camera are. Try it for yourself. I'd bet that most instances of double tap to wake not working are related to that.  Unless I'm mistaken it's a proximity sensor that is used to ensure that your phone doesn't unlock in your pocket.  Double tap to wake rarely fails for me.  I don't have any particular touch screen issues either.  Previous phone was a note 2.
lgg4,3dv1yj,gainkiller,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:39:01 2015 UTC,When you say you don't have any 'particular touch screen issues' does that mean absolutely zero issues? Or do you have missed swipes every now and then?
lgg4,3dv1yj,sykophreak,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:42:04 2015 UTC,"No missed swipes or taps.  Is it as consistently responsive as an iPhone?  No but that's just android,  so far. I'm guessing the amount of problematic phones is small and most people have a perfectly working device."
lgg4,3dv1yj,Ashish879,2,Sun Jul 19 22:15:40 2015 UTC,"I've had the phone since early June on Verizon. It feels like the touchscreen issues have gotten worse over time. Either that or I've gotten less patient with it. It's most noticeable when I'm unlocking the phone and then swiping to another home screen. I'll have to swipe twice before it responds. If I'm opening Textra from the icon in my dock, I'll have to tap it twice before it launches. If I'm in Chrome, I'll be scrolling and it might read a scrolling motion as a tap and take me to a page it thinks I've tapped the link for. I've gotten fed up enough, between that and the lagging, to be looking at the IPhone 6 or a Nexus 6."
lgg4,3dv1yj,Bhajj94,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:25:43 2015 UTC,This is the kind of situation that is pushing me towards the S6. I had the same thing two years ago between the One M7 and the S4 - I got the M7 for a week or two and the amount of issues forced me to switch. I don't want to have to repeat a similar process again.
lgg4,3dv1yj,sacredshapes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:41:28 2015 UTC,"The situation the OP is going through is what you'll be going through with the S6.  Maybe not the touch issues, but lag will be consistently worse on the S6.  Apps will fail to remain in memory.  Battery life is downright terrible.  Source: Left a S6 Edge for a G4."
lgg4,3dv1yj,Eagle1337,2,Mon Jul 20 06:16:05 2015 UTC,See. I had major touchscreen issues when I first got it but I just stuck through them and now they have seemed to go away. The first week I had the phone I did this test and could not get past 6 touches at once. But for some reason it gets to 10 now no problem. I mean I'm not complaining but it certainly is weird.

lgg4,3dt3bj,vervurax,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:31:14 2015 UTC,It's just not smooth enough. There is still a lot of jerkiness that is just not present in the stock Lollipop. My Nexus 5 is faster and smoother than this latest high powered smartphone. I value smoothness over everything else. I thought I didn't but I have come to realize that for me it's absolutely important.   There aren't a lot of apps in the International version of the G4. LG has surprisingly managed to keep it at minimum. So I am pretty okay on that front.
lgg4,3dt3bj,OMG_NoReally,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:53:54 2015 UTC,What launcher are you using? I'm using nova launcher on an international model (Canada/Sasktel) and have zero lag.

lgg4,3dt3bj,davelee3629,3,Sun Jul 19 15:57:14 2015 UTC,"Nope. You need proprietary firmware (part of the ROM, loaded into the camera at every boot), proprietary drivers, proprietary framework changes, and proprietary libraries. Some of those will never make it into non-stock ROMs because manufacturers would sue the shit out of the developers.  This is why, for example, the camera image quality on the Note 4 on CM12.1 is total garbage compared to the camera on stock TouchWiz, regardless of what camera app you use."

Enter the info required, which consists of basic mailing info, an upload of the receipt, and an upload of the box/IMEInumber  Wait 1 day, then send an email to LGG4leatherpromo@smsrebates.com stating that you read the FAQ and saw that a 3-5 day (doesn't say business day) turn-around is expected, but you have read on multiple forums that it is expected to take longer. You are just so excited with your new LG phone that you need clarification. Include your name (as shown on your receipt), email, and an upload of your receipt (again) with this email. State that you would like to know if the 3-5 day turn-around stated in the FAQ (linked in the title) is still valid, since many people are saying it takes much longer. Be cordial, thank them for their time in investigating the matter, and send the email.  Wait another 2-3 days, and your status should go from pending to approved.   LG's customer support is really good, but only if you reach out to them. I sent my email 2 days ago (initial submission July 8th, email sent July 16th, reply received tonight/yesterday/whatever July18th around midnight) I immediately checked my status and it had become approved. So 8 days went by before I sent an email, but then 2 days later they said to check my status.   After you are approved, you will get an email from LG saying to check your mail for your promo. I don't know how long it takes to get once approved, so if anyone else can chime in here I'd appreciate it.   Good luck!"

lgg4,3dqxqq,p2im0,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:41:27 2015 UTC,Yup. I just wipe the sensor with my finger and it goes away. It's annoying though
lgg4,3dqxqq,nepalidude69,4,Sat Jul 18 18:43:58 2015 UTC,Your hand is probably covering up the proximity sensor up at the top. This prevents the screen from turning on in your pocket from inadvertent rogue taps.
lgg4,3dqxqq,superphly,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:14:40 2015 UTC,Is there a way to disable this? I use my phone in landscape mode most of the time so my left hand necessarily covers the sensor
lgg4,3dqxqq,pfizzle123,3,Sat Jul 18 18:28:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you can disable it, it's meant to keep your phone screen off while in your pocket. but maybe you can try to unlock your phone first and then use it in landscape"

I don't know the exact numbers but I believe when rating a battery, if its ""over half way there"" you can round up. The G4 battery is like 2985mah. So they can technically call it 3000mah or 2900mah . Same idea as calories for food.

lgg4,3dmdpy,CleverPunName,2,Fri Jul 17 14:51:33 2015 UTC,"Not at all.  And it's better for your USB connection to not be getting plugged in all the time to charge.  I just use QI by my bed overnight, otherwise everywhere else I plug the phone in.    So if you pop the back cover off, there are a couple contacts exposed on one side of it.  Those are for the NFC.  They line up with contacts on your phone when you put the cover on.  Adding this sticker adds the coil for the QI charger, and then some more contacts on the other side, which if you look at the back of your phone, are just there waiting to be connected.  It's just LG making a cash grab wanting to sell circle cases with QI built in.  Super annoying they aren't just there out of the box like the LG G2 had.

lgg4,3dmdpy,warbler7,-1,Sat Jul 18 02:41:53 2015 UTC,"FYI, I just had a Nexus 4 with Qi charging where the battery started swelling after 2.5 years. So ultimately, yes, it affects the battery. Short-term, no."
lgg4,3dmdpy,jordanjay29,3,Fri Jul 17 17:11:14 2015 UTC,None of our 4 batteries swelled in a similar time frame. I don't think you could say that was because of using Qi.
lgg4,3dmdpy,linh_nguyen,-1,Sat Jul 18 01:34:48 2015 UTC,"Can you definitively rule it out?

lgg4,3dmdpy,jordanjay29,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:16:41 2015 UTC,"Of course I can't definitely rule it out, but your wording implied Qi charging causes swelling.   Your explanation is just a generic risk of overcharging batteries. More that you feel Qi charging leads people to leave it on the charger longer. Which is unfounded since I can easily counter that with everyone that leaves their phone plugged in overnight.

lgg4,3dmdpy,whitneysit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:11:21 2015 UTC,"The ones I've had never scratched. 9H. And I dropped the shit out of my G3 on my birthday. Crushed two corners bad to where I figured they had to have broken the screen just a little on the corners, but the adhesive was holding them in good yet. Finally picked the tempered sheet off after trading up to the G4... G3 screen is spotless. I'll never not do it again. There's pretty much no loss of touch screen responsiveness at all. Way better than any other screen protector. And I really hate using cases, so protecting the glass is really all I want."

lgg4,3dmdpy,Raziel66,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:13:07 2015 UTC,Should be about 3.5 hours max from a full discharge I think when I timed it 4-5% to 100% took about 3hrs 15-20mins to fully charge.  Just a little over 2 mins to charge 1%.  With a QC charger and usb cable plug directly into phone your at like 1min per 1%.  I mentioned to a few others I bought a QC charger and use that with the QI charger so if you need a faster charge in a very short time just plug it in directly with the usb.  I decided to by 2 QI chargers one in the bedroom and the other at my computer so I always just toss it on the charger in those rooms.  Thinking of buying another charger for the living room.

I have the G4, and I can tell you that there is a HUGE difference in camera quality. Speed, they're both fast. Screen, both screens are nice. But the G4 has a larger and higher quality screen. Build, I prefer the G4 due to the removable back and expandable memory. I think the G4 is a very good upgrade, but you won't see things in a completely new light unless you're talking about the camera. I mean, wow! What a camera!  Oh, and I kept the G2 on COMPLETELY STOCK firmware (no upgrades from LG because I read a lot about how battery life decreases and such, so, I kept it new out of the box, by disabling auto-update and auto-check for updates).

The G2 1080P screen is very good and gives the phone great battery life so I'm not going to give major kudos to the screen on this phone.   The rear buttons on the G4 are million times better.

Or do you guys think it would be easier to call customer service first to see if they will give me a credit for the difference minus restock fee, then going in-store to do an exchange?

I am on the EIP program though so not sure if it'll take effect fast enough for me to buy new on the plan again.  I suppose I could either use another line on my family plan to get it or just use my old phone for a few days.  Someone here switched from an S6 to a G4 and posted a fairly unbiased review of the phone.  The phone has been great so far. There are a few quirks that I can comprehend but they're not real issues as some have stated (but you know extreme opinions on forums are).  Battery life: I can easily go a 1 - 1.5 days under normal non-extensive gaming and camera use.  Anticipate 0.75 days with some games and video recording.  Although I don't believe I have hardware touchscreen issues, there is a lag when double-tapping or using knock-code to unlock the screen.  Sometimes my taps won't register but I truly believe it's a software issue.  It feels like the phone is trying to sense what is accident touching or the screen vs purposely trying to unlock it.  There was an update that improved the touchscreen issue but I think it's still there.  Honestly, not a big deal.  A note about the slow motion recording feature on this phone.  It can record and playback slow motion but it is primitive compared to the iPhone.  You have to play it in the native LG video/gallery app and can't export or post online anywhere as slow motion.  Screen size is perfect and build quality is good.  f/1.8 on the camera is awesome.  I'm not sure if an issue with the phone within the first 2 weeks should deter me from getting is phone again but, realistically speaking, all phones have issues.  It's somewhat of a crap shoot whether or not you'll get a bad one."

I got a rep said they couldn't do anything about and then seen I was 9+ year customer said Hold please lets see what I can do.  She offered a $60 credit to the account so off the bill.  I said that is perfect.  So didn't get $120 but got $60 good enough for me since the one's who bought early got 128GB SD cards as well which not blazing fast but good enough and those are what maybe $50 or more haven't look up prices.

lgg4,3dnycb,redditorguy,3,Fri Jul 17 20:34:49 2015 UTC,"The answer straight from the horse's mouth is ""not really""   Q6: Does it matter what type of charging cable is used with a Quick Charge 2.0 adapter?  A: Quick Charge 2.0 is designed to be connector-independent. Quick Charge 2.0 can be implemented with a variety of formats, including USB Type-A, USB micro, USB Type-C, and other proprietary connectors.  Quick Charge 2.0 high-voltage operation is designed to minimize charging issues associated with long or thin cables, allowing for a superior charging experience, independent of cable type.   If you have an especially long or thin cable you may still may have charging issues, but you would have the same issues no matter what adapter you're using in that case."

Cheap, 24ga (I believe)  cables won't last as long, and can be internally damaged, preventing an efficient charge"
lgg4,3dnycb,POVFox,0,Sat Jul 18 19:42:09 2015 UTC,"No, the only thing that matters is the wall plug. All USB cables are the same, with the exception that only some provide power, and some provide power and data transfer."

lgg4,3dnycb,ekaceerf,3,Sat Jul 18 07:40:24 2015 UTC,5% an hour? That seems awfully slow...
lgg4,3dntt9,DocOpti,2,Fri Jul 17 20:00:24 2015 UTC,"No I average around 4-5 hours of SOT, on either battery.  Here are some things that I recommend.  1) back up everything to your Google drive account (shohld have 100gb free for 2 years) and then do a hard reset.  2) setup your phone and don't restore any settings, just your photos or contacts and songs.  3) turn everything off on your notification bar (location, bluetooth...) keep your Wi-Fi on obviously.   4) go to settings> wifi> click the menu and click ""advanced Wi-Fi""> then make sure to uncheck the box that says allow Wi-Fi scanning and ""switch to mobile data""  5) turn off VOLTE and Wi-Fi calling unless you absolutely need Wi-Fi calling  6)go to settings > General tag> and uncheck the dual window box.  Usually the factory reset is all that's needed.  Charge the battery to 100% then let it completely drain without charging. Do this for both batteries."

Any other questions ask away
lgg4,3dnpog,dogwithablog_dotcom,2,Fri Jul 17 23:01:52 2015 UTC,Does it really make a difference? I mean SOT
lgg4,3dnpog,SimpleYetHard,3,Fri Jul 17 23:15:35 2015 UTC,honestly i love it. its so great being able to have an extra 70% battery just be hitting a button although i would wait for cheaper options unless you really need it.

lgg4,3dnpog,pfizzle123,3,Fri Jul 17 23:47:11 2015 UTC,"I dont know if you're set on this or not, but I would highly suggest a spare battery instead! If you qualify for the free promo, definiteily apply for it and it's yours for free! Otherwise, I still suggest to wait for official battery and buy that. It's so convenient to just have your phone nice and slim and then when your battery is low, you can just swap in the fresh one and be at 100% in less than 30 seconds. I find this much more convenient than having a case which adds thickness and takes time to charge. It's the beauty of Android phones, and our G4's are luckily some of the few flagships that do have this removable battery benefit. This paired with a quick charger for top ups will make sure you have enough power  As for the screen protector, I'd recommend a tempered glass one. Whatever brand you like. I like techarmor but they didnt have one when I was buying. I got a Skinomi tempered glass screen protector and it has a lifetime warranty. So if it cracks theyll send you a new one for free. It feels like theres nothing on the screen too since it's glass"

If you are a photographer this shouldn't be an issue though as most photographers strive for accurate color rather than additional processing. Also apple phone are cooler and are praised for their quality..   As I don't think many of these will be fixed with software updates, maybe you should try a s6 or note 5 in a few months as it might better suit your needs plus has a similar grade of camera.   Quote from expert reviews   ""LG says this equates to about 120% of the sRGB gamut, but our colour calibrator showed the G4 was only displaying 96.3% of the sRGB colour gamut. What's more, it was the G4's reds and yellows that fell short of the gamut boundary. Of course, 96.3% is still a highly respectable score for an IPS display, and it's easily one of the most subjectively pleasing screens we've seen outside of Samsung's Super AMOLED screens on the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge, even if the nitty-gritty numbers (in our tests) don't quite live up to LG's promises.
