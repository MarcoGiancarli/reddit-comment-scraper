malegrooming,3e4duv,CongressmanMcCheese,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:33:06 2015 UTC,I shaved down the top of the cheek three days ago - which I think was a mistake - so I'm leaving that alone for now. Isn't really growing in all that fully on my chin or on the cheeks. Do you beard experts think I should keep it up for a few more weeks or will it end up patchy?
malegrooming,3e4duv,IllIIllIlIlI,2,Tue Jul 21 21:33:13 2015 UTC,I don't think it looks bad apart from maybe the 'neck-part'. It looks too strong on the neck compared to the cheeks/chin/jaw. You probably want to shave the lower->lower-mid part of the neck to accentuate your jawline a bit better.  I'm not saying shave from the jaw down but definitely take the bottom line of the beard higher so it is maybe just an inch max below your jaw/chin
malegrooming,3e4duv,IllIIllIlIlI,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:52:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  Yeah I always struggle with where to end any facial hair on the bottom.  If I go too high it creates a double chin look kind of, but I'll check out making it a bit higher."

It's the ratio formula that is what is unique with these carriers.  Customers who use the product are amazed at how well these oils are immediately absorbed.  Unlike beard oils with some other companies, ours are not heavy.  It's hard to see without actually experiencing but we have struck on a great formula that we haven't seen produced elsewhere.  We've also found that wives are purchasing the unscented version for their own use and have commented it's a better than what they use for their own moisturizers.  Anyhow, that's the long answer to your question :-)  I hope the helps.  And thanks for your kind comments on the website."

A change towards wet shaving might yield much better results for you if done right.   The only time I had problems breaking out like that was when I was a teen and made fast and long passes against the grain.
malegrooming,3dvzbe,Givensia,2,Mon Jul 20 05:14:38 2015 UTC,Are you reusing the same blade? Maybe try just buying the cheap disposable kind that you can toss after each use. Use alcohol based aftershave and cold water to close your pores. It just looks like you pores are getting infected.

malegrooming,3dvzbe,WallacePark,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:02:44 2015 UTC,Try only shaving with the grain. It's not as close of a shave but should help a lot. OR join us at /r/beards and NEVER have that problem again :)
malegrooming,3dvzbe,Fmcdh,-1,Mon Jul 20 21:24:44 2015 UTC,"As one commenter mentioned, you should try wetshaving and use a blade which works. Many guides over at /r/wicked_edge. Also, your neck grain is very uneven, the hairs at the bottom grow towards your face, the rest seems to grow vertically out and some towards your ear. Map it out while shaving and go with the grain, when shaving with a single or even multiblade razor. Use alum or aloe afterwards.  Best of luck."
malegrooming,3dv9tb,sixsetstraightace,5,Sun Jul 19 20:29:39 2015 UTC,"Hell no! My beard is about 4 and a half months in and still isn't as thick as yours. You've got good genes for growing and I think that a beard looks good on you.  What you should look into is trimming and maintenance, some proper care will fix the issues you are worried about. First of all check out /r/beards, thats a good subreddit with plenty of info for you and your future bearded life. Secondly, you need to look into proper trimming guides, I like this one for designing a proper neckline. However, don't be afraid to deviate a little from the suggested, some men look better with the line slightly higher or slightly lower. I aim for one fingers-width above my adams apple and round it out from there. That site also has a great guide for choosing a cheek line, also called a smile line, I like a more defined look, but some men rock the natural with a lumberjack feel to it.  If all this feels overwhelming, next time you head to a barber shop, ask your barber for advice! The first time I trimmed my beard, I had my barber do it along with a haircut. It was easy to keep up from there.  Good luck and enjoy all the compliments you'll be getting."
malegrooming,3dv9tb,Regular_Everyday_Guy,3,Sun Jul 19 20:45:31 2015 UTC,the general rule for neckline is two fingers above adams apple.  Bring up your neckline a bit.  You might do well to round out your cheek too. I follow the rule of where mustache meets chin hair and follow that line up to where your sideburns are at their natural width.
malegrooming,3dv9tb,MCbrodie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:18:59 2015 UTC,"This, this, this. Just bring up your neckline. Don't f with your beard too much, you'll regret it"

As far as male grooming goes, I've been pretty straight forward about the products I've used over the years, some natural, some not natural. I use Herban Cowboy Shave Soap for my face, and occasionally I'll use Badger Brand Hair Oil on my face to shave. I use the Badger Brand Hair Oil on my hair once a week, but I only shampoo every other day, using The Seaweed Bath Co. Eucalyptus shampoo. I also use Doctor Bronner's Peppermint Soap for my body and hands, but I've found recently that it's really rough on my skin, and I'm looking for an alternative, maybe something with more oils and a bit more gentle, do you have any recommendations?  The big one for me is my deodorant. I'm looking for an all natural deodorant that can compare to Old Spice's long lasting and pleasant smell (this one is for the GF). I normally use Swagger by Old Spice, just the deodorant, not the antiperspirant.  So I guess my questions for you, what are your go-to products, what is your grooming process like, and how does it feel to be in the Small Business Owner club?"
malegrooming,3duq6e,mcgillicudy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:52:42 2015 UTC,"Hey mcgillicudy, thanks for the questions. Let me begin by saying its pretty awesome that you have found products you truly like to use. As far as me, I found it very difficult to find any products I truly enjoyed/felt comfortable using. I also used Dr. Bronners for a while (Tea Tree version) and found it to be a bit irritating to my skin.   My go-to products are mostly made by me. There are a few from lush I truly enjoy (sea salt scrub and soak and float shampoo bar) This is a big reason I decided to start a small business. As an Environmental Scientist, I couldn't justify using some of the products that had the chemicals that I inherently have to clean up in our groundwater.   Out of the products thus far I have made, my favorites would have to be my tea tree/charcoal deodorant bar, my cedar beard oil conditioner, and my coconut styling pomade.   My grooming process is pretty straight forward as well. As I work in an office, I have to make sure I am professional looking. I shower regularly with my soak and float shampoo bar (working on making my own shampoo bars), occasionally use a sea salt/witch hazel facial scrub that I created, then I use my tea tree charcoal deodorant and cedar beard oil every day to make sure my pits don't smell like a hot italian sub and my beard stays fed. Gotta brush that guy as well. Finally, I get a little bit of that coconut pomade for a nice shine look and to keep all my cowlicks at bay. I also use a moisturizing cream I created to make sure that dry skin stays at bay. LLSS: Lady's love smooth skin (at least my lady).  As a side note, I also make a great natural bug spray using a special blend of essential oils that works amazing for those long hikes into the wilderness.  The small business owner club is crazy hard. Having to do everything myself, I didn't realize how insane everything would be to get set up (read: learning to design websites has been a struggle bus). Its a fun journey so far though!"

malegrooming,3dshn5,Leg_Mcmuffin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:50:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know a single person that has facial hair that doesn't grow in strange patterns at some point. You need to 'map' the growth. Learn the patterns, and then do a WITH the grain pass (shave in the direction that the hair is growing), followed by an ACROSS the grain pass (shaving the hair from the side), and finally, if you want a smooth shave, make an AGAINST the grain pass. The against the grain pass takes practice, and is where most people make their mistakes. I would recommend sticking with the DE razor. Keep practicing, but skip days if you have wounds. Continuing to shave over irritation will only make it worse. Eventually, you will get the hang of it. I had these issues as well before switching to wet shaving. I now use straight razors and DE and never have skin issues.   As far as the shaving cream, you should try some old school stuff, and stay away from anyhting in a can that sprays. You can grab some Van Der Hagen at most walmarts and walgreen stores. It's not the best, but its definitely better than canned cream."

But the hair seems to grow in different directions on that specific area, which may contribute to why  it goes red every time I shave. What can I do against that? I do use the DE razor."

No tv, but radio quietly on oldies/classical/sportsball if there's a good game on.  Work on making it a more calming, meditative experience like going to the barber used to be (for me, at least.)"

Maybe we're an increasing rarity, but I agree. I love my barber because he's an awesome people person, friendly to everyone, always offers you a drink and you just shoot the shit. As a stay at home dad of a 15 month old, my barber is a huge escape from the daily grind--if just for 30 mins. The best part, he doesn't rush you out. During my cut the other day, another guy was just chilling in the shop chatting with all of us. It's low key, welcoming, super cool but not too cool for school."

If you're going to go for the high-end men's barber shop, please, for the love of all things high-end, don't make the names of things sex puns. That's low-brow and gives the air of a sports bar atmosphere rather than high-end, y'know?  Also, don't have hot women cutting hair in bikinis, but I think that goes without saying.

If you're going to have a high-end establishment, you want people staffing it that are focused on a) being the best there is at what they do, and b) making the customer feel at ease with them having sharp-ass pieces of steel really close to or on their heads. I think coffee's probably better to have than any kind of liquor (especially since liquor laws are fuckin' nuts in the South) both because of the liquor license AND the fact that if someone can't hold their booze, they could get wobbly and you'll have an accident situation on your hands.  I think if you keep it straightforward and professional, you've got a winning barber shop on your hands, sir! Also, make sure you've got beard care options; not just a shave, but trim and wash and oil as well. I know it's not the Pacific Northwest or anything, but beards are huge now (haHA, wordplay!) and if you get a reputation for being THE place for the hipsters and/or lumberjacks to go and get their beards treated right, that's MAJOR income."

Hot lather and straight razor shaves are a must for me as well.   I also like to talk product and I find I end up knowing a lot more about product than a lot of barbers and this has always frustrated me. It sort of seems like a lot of barbers pick a pomade and then never even test the other pomades. I have super thick hair and most barbers comment on how thick my hair is then still will use a small amount of light pomade regardless.   I'm sorry for the wall of text. I got started and I couldn't quit.

malegrooming,3dp92x,AndyAndyAndyAndy,7,Sat Jul 18 04:11:43 2015 UTC,"I live in a small-ish town outside of Ottawa, Canada and there is one barber here that has made a name for himself.  He is a one-man operation and people will literally wait for 90 minutes to have their hair cut by him, despite another hair cutters shop being 30 seconds away, or they will go away and come back the next day.  Its the little things that give his place a real flair.  A collection of framed Cuban cigars line his walls.  Passionate about the local sport teams(despite him not being from around the area), a touch of cologne on his brush when wiping away the cut hair, some stuff for kids and a few magic tricks to amaze them.  He has a very small tv on one side and its set to the weather unless a game is on.  Interestingly enough, he is in the process of getting a liquor license to have a craft brew set up on one side, which I suppose is going to make the waits for him even longer, yet more bareable. ;)  Biggest effect of them all though, is him.  He is just a likeable guy by people of all age groups.  Always has something positive to say, always up to date in what is happening locally, gets involved with the community, ect.  I guess what I'm saying in a long-winded kinda way, is when you open up a shop, you are not just selling killer haircuts(unless you do shitty haircuts in which case you're screwed lol), you are selling yourself.  Having a great tech set up is great, but dont forget to have your own unique style, something competitors can't just buy and stick in their own shops.  People will come to your shop because its new and interesting, but they'll come back year after year because of you."

Persons of Interest in Brooklyn (Smith St).  I'd recommend scoping out barbershops that have a similar feel as the one you're looking to run.  A couple tips:    Make sure your barbers all speak English. A lot of the $20/cut places near me are foreign owned and the communication gap makes it very difficult to explain what I want (explaining a haircut can be very difficult). That's the main reason why I upgraded to a $50 cut, but the quality was evident immediately. Make sure your barbers take their time and pay attention to detail. My barber uses a bare razor blade and scans my head to catch and fix any single stray hairs. I don't know if it really makes a huge difference, but it makes me feel like he knows what he's doing and is carefully perfecting my look. The experience and perception is as important as the cut itself. Don't want to feel rushed."

Your best bet is to go to your barber and have him lower it down with the trimmers, then go home and use your razor.

I say this based on my own experience and frustration at trying to find a clipper that is adequate.  I used Wahl, Andis, Remington, etc. and they all failed in some way or another.    My solution was the sack up and get the Oster Classic 76.  It doesn't come with a bunch of extraneous attachments and settings, but you can get those separately if you so choose.  It will work on your face and neck- I know this because I use mine weekly to maintain a closely buzzed head and face.    Yes, it's a pretty penny, but I spent twice this looking for the Oster solution.  Clean the blades regularly and lube it every few months and it will last for life.

An electric shaver will get you a closer shave than a beard trimmer would, so keep that in mind as they are two different products. If you want an electric shaver, your value pick would be a Philips Norelco power touch. Upper tier shavers would be like the Panasonic ES la93."

It doesn't really have too much gloss after a few minutes, and the hold is really nice, but soft. I used to use gel a lot to spike my hair and shit and it was always rock hard, but once I changed my style up to longer hair, like for a fauxhawk or my current combover, gel wouldn't work because it was either too hard and was weird to run your hand through (you literally couldn't, really) or the gel wouldn't be making the hair stay in the shape I want it to.  With this pomade, though, I can run my fingers through my hair, and it'll still spring back to essentially the same way. It's really nice, and has a decent clean citrus scent to it, too. You can easily find it at any drugstore; RiteAid, CVS, etc should all have it."

Norelco qt4070 or Wahl 9818 are my choice Use a beard oil if you aren't already. Get an all natural one,  fragrance or not is up to you.    These two things will help style and bring more life to your beard. I would say if you really wanted you could even dye your whole beard a dark brown, but that would get annoying having to keep doing it and I think you should rock what genetics gave you."

Don't push hard! Get the other side of your face wet again and apply the cream/gel like you did before.  You may want to use a moisturizer of sorts as an aftershave.

You really don't look bad at all but better without the glasses imo. If you can try and get a different frame shape that suits your face better (I have no idea what will work for you, maybe try /r/malefashionadvice as I don't wear glasses)..

If black, you could mix black temporary dye (I suggest something like Punky Colours brand) into conditioner and going that route. That's how you keep up wild colors from going bland and I imagine that, since grey hairs are light, that would work. IDK about brown tones.   Otherwise, I suggest doing root touch ups. Go to Sally's beauty, select a color as close as you can get to your natural hair, buy 10 volume developer and do it yourself. Pretty easy - most dyes are 1-1 ratio of developer to dye, and 1 to 2 teaspoons of dye would cover temples."

If you're shedding, look at your diet, sleep, and stress levels. Looking back these were the biggest factors for hair loss at that age. If things have changed recently that's probably the reason.   Also, it could be that you're more aware of hair loss because you're more conscious of it. It might be that the hair shedding is the same amount you've always had and is in fact normal, but because you're aware of it now, it seems like a lot. I could be wrong but without further information I can't go any deeper."

Tempted to see if I can get anything of decent length on the top of my head... I noticed my hair thinning back in 2012 which is why I started shaving it.

malegrooming,3cktjl,Nostradamus1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:29:33 2015 UTC,"I kept hair at that level of loss and think it was just fine. So long as you don't try to cover-up, comb over, let it get long or try for very vertical styles you are probably ok.  I started to crop it very close after I lost just a bit more though.  I think you are nearing the limit.  A lot depends on your head shape too, once you decide to start keeping it very short or shaven."

malegrooming,3cn8cc,SofaKingWeeToddDid,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:48:52 2015 UTC,I keep mine at a stubble. It looks rough enough to look good but clean enough to not interfere with the fade.
malegrooming,3cn8cc,hungry_lobster,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:56:03 2015 UTC,"Followup question:  As the hair grows, how do I maintain that seamless connection of the faded sideburn area to the stubbly/facial area?"
malegrooming,3cn8cc,hungry_lobster,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:22:34 2015 UTC,"Well if you must have a beard or a stubble you're going to have to maintain the fade pretty often or let the beard grow with the fade. I get a taper every week or two and keep my facial hair from shaven to a stubble. If my hair goes past two weeks without a cut, then I stay clean shaven otherwise it begins to look sloppy. When I get a haircut again, I shave and let them grow together again. I hope that makes sense.  If you're looking to keep a lengthy beard, then I'd say let the barber fade it into your fade. Most barbers charge just a couple bucks extra for the extra grooming."
malegrooming,3cn8cc,hungry_lobster,2,Thu Jul 9 18:20:28 2015 UTC,"I actually prefer to remain clean shaven, but my hair grows really fast. If they fade into no-hair, the fact remains that I would soon need to shave and shape my sideburns area, no?"

It's not super sticky or stuff, it's mendable, stays all day and if you need to fix it, it doesn't get all over your hands, and if you do happen to get some on your hands, fucking water rinses it right off. I can't recommend that shit enough. Plus it's dirt cheap at CVS."

malegrooming,3clfrf,CharlieMininugget,3,Wed Jul 8 20:43:32 2015 UTC,"I find men (in fact most clients, including females) tend to focus on the products and not the tools.  Your natural texture also plays a huge part in this.  But to start you'll need a volumizing spray for the roots and a mousse.  You'll need something that dries firm but flexible in the hair for hold.  I love using clay for this.  You can mix some pomade in it for shine, but clay will give you a longer lasting hold.  Also a good setting hairspray.  I like Redken Control Addict.  Now, the most important part.  Get yourself a Solano or Twin Turbo blow dryer.  Look on Amazon.  And while you're on Amazon, get a Denman Vent brush.  Apply products (not hairspray)  And be messy with the clay.  Roots to ends.  Front and back.  Now blow dry back with the vent brush starting in the back.  Brush backwards.  If you can, learn how to lock the hair with the brush for more volume.  This is setting the hair.  Now finish the hair with the brush in your desired parting/shape.  Spray with the hairspray.  Do NOT touch the hair through out the day.  The best example I know of is a video from Schorem. http://youtu.be/yeYF-BAsWXo It's a game changer. Also, find a good men's barber shop.  Take the picture.  You don't need super high end but not a Supercuts either.  Yes, this al sounds expensive and sounds like baking a cake, but after years of searching how to do a perfect pomp, I've finally found what works, for me at least.  Good luck!"

If your hair is dry, try spritzing it with water or hair tonic - you can buy cheap water bottles with spray nozzles from garden centres or home stores.   Then take a dime-sized amount of pomade. You'll have to try a few brands to figure out what you like. I personally use Suavecito but have also used Layrite in the past. Rub it between your palms to distribute and warm it evenly. Run it through your hair. Style, blow-dry on low, using a comb if you want to give it direction.   Personally, I had to experiment a bit before figuring it out. There are a tonne of great videos on YouTube too for a more in-depth, visual, guideline."

It could also mean that the edges of your beard need cleaned up.   A cordless razor can help here to even the lengths of individual hairs by using a plastic guide, and to tidy up the edges, you can use the trimmer for that too."

malegrooming,3c4bi3,atomofconsumption,11,Sat Jul 4 17:32:42 2015 UTC,"let's see an after photo!  also i think if you regrew it and managed it with a beard trimmer at a shorter length which was even, clean, and uniform, it would look 1,000,000 times better.   For example, you can see in photo #3 that the jaw area is much much longer than everywhere else and kind of gives it a very unkempt and uneven look.. If you took a beard trimmer to the whole thing and made it all the same length i bet it would look good (that's what i do--i keep it about 2-3 days stubble look)."

malegrooming,3c4bi3,seopants,16,Sat Jul 4 17:31:00 2015 UTC,"Hey man, my honest recommendation is to go clean shaven. Your beard hasn't filled in yet, but probably will five years down the road. It won't look good until it has filled in. If you don't listen to that, at least buy some hair clippers and trim it down to a 2 or 3, and clean up your neck and cheeks with a razor. If you don't trim you will look slovenly.   But I genuinely think you should go clean shaven."

malegrooming,3c4bi3,BipoBlues,6,Sun Jul 5 11:12:42 2015 UTC,"If you're absolutely against going clean shaven, shave your cheeks and neck and trim down the chin and moustache until they don't look scruffy anymore.  It typically looks more presentable than a scruffy unshaven face because it's obvious you've taken the time to groom yourself. Which is most likely why they want you to shave, so you look like you take care of yourself.  No offence is intended by this, but it looks like you haven't done anything to your facial hair which leads some people to the impression that you're slovenly. Which is why neckbeards are associated with poor hygiene. Not calling you a neckbeard, but it's an example."
malegrooming,3c4bi3,ManES57,5,Sat Jul 4 18:33:15 2015 UTC,"Go buy a beard trimmer, cut everything to same length and id probably do the same to your moustache.   Step one: Buzz it  Set guard to 3 and buzz your whole beard.  Step two: Clean lower neck  Switch guard to 1 and buzz from your Adam’s apple to two inches below your jaw.  Step three: Fade it  Switch guard to 2 and buzz that remaining two-inch area, finessing and fading the 1 zone into the 3 zone.  Step four: Remove strays  Remove guard (the 0 setting) and buzz below your Adam’s apple and any strays on the sides of your neck.  If it looks patchy still, cut everything closer and go with stubble."
malegrooming,3c4bi3,BipoBlues,2,Sat Jul 4 17:33:59 2015 UTC,i already have a beard trimmer bought it specifically for styling purposes but i always felt i should just have my barber do it when i go get a haircut its just im not sure what would look good on me or what to tell him to do but thank you i might try this if i decide not to shave the whole thing
malegrooming,3c4bi3,szukai,2,Sat Jul 4 17:43:14 2015 UTC,"You should have a barber give you a shave and a haircut. Tell them to develop good lines on your sideburns and along your jaw line. No beard should go go past where the bottom of your jaw bone is. Use the density but trip it to an even length. Then after their done get some beard oils and comb them in.   Having a beard doesn't mean you should be unkempt. More hair means more work. Take some pictures of people who have good beards to your barber as an example. Important next step is to go to your family, dressed up, and ask if your new look is acceptable for the important event."

malegrooming,3c4bi3,Justice_Prince,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:03:10 2015 UTC,The jawline of your beard is way too dense for your cheeks. Take a beard trimmer and gradually trim it down until it's a uniform length. With the right haircut your moustache could look okay if it were trimmed and groomed properly - but that look is up to you. Safest bet is short and uniform all over if you don't want to be clean shaven.

Although...shorter hairstyles look cool on bigger guys. Like almost buzz cuts with a clean fade on the sides.   Facial shape is more what people refer to rather than structure. I will admit jawlines and pronounced chins (maybe smaller foreheads) look better for most styles. I wish I had either of those to be honest.

malegrooming,3bs4j7,CallThatGoing,2,Thu Jul 2 02:36:05 2015 UTC,"ALSO: Dry your hair before putting products in it. If a hairdryer isn't your thing, make sure you towel dry the hell out of your hair and wait  a couple minutes. It makes a lot of difference!"
malegrooming,3bs4j7,Alanadelcray,2,Thu Jul 2 23:16:23 2015 UTC,"I would go with a texture cream or lotion. Crew light hold texture lotion is great for long hair you don't want to look greasy or geled up. Very light and just keeps frizz away and holds in place. Won't wven really look like anything is in, very natural. I would avoid shiny pomades because they can look greasy."

I've had issues along the jawline, it's hard to get the angle just right, however witch hazel was a godsend. It's a natural astringent that leaves your face silky smooth.  I used bay rum for a while but it dried my face out so bad it made irritation worse. Witch hazel is great but smells sort of stale as it's made from fermented bark. . What soap are you using?  I use handmade bar soap, anything with oatmeal or other skin friendly ingredients.  I also use the gilette platinum blues, could be your razor too, I started with the ""shaveology"" razor which was shit, the angle of the blade was different on either side and I learned that I didn't like three piece razors. Bought a used gilette off a co worker (50s model) and haven't looked back. Try eBay. Hope this helps if you have bad irritation it is more than likely your angle, even when I wasn't using any product I never had any serious issues once I got my angle right."
malegrooming,3bdhh3,skunkynugget,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:58:12 2015 UTC,So are you saying change the angle of my hand when shaving or the angle of my blade in my razor? Right now I use an Edwin Jagger 3 piece. And should I be using Witch Hazel after my shave or before?
malegrooming,3bdhh3,skunkynugget,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:54:05 2015 UTC,"The angle of your razor against your skin. It's important to think of it this way because your skin isn't flat so it's a practice of constant adjustment to keep your blade at a (roughly) 30 degree angle to the surface being shaved. I use witch hazel as an after Shave but they make non/low alcohol substitutes that smell pretty good. Also you shouldn't be using a blade more than 2 days before changing it. I use a razor three days at a time but I only grow stubble on my lip and chin so if your shaving your entire face more than twice with the same blade that can be your problem too. One of the main reasons you get a closer/smoother shave is that your blade stays fresh; at $.10 a blade I don't feel bad tossing them. That and there aren't 4 more blades stacked together to get the job done ""quicker"""

One he could be using a relaxer/chemical straightening which I DO NOT recommend as it is terrible for your hair and scalp. Another could be is that he is using a hair net at night, kinda like a do-rag that will compress his hair down really tight with some product in (probably from the previous day).  From what I can tell he is using a Pomade, water based with possibly a clay or hard water pomade base. He probably or his stylist probably applies ALOT of product. You could achieve these looks but i suggest using the do-rag/hair net compress at night rather than chemicals.   The Pomade is giving it that shine/matte finish.  Hope this helps.

malegrooming,3aywq4,cuank1,2,Wed Jun 24 17:20:17 2015 UTC,"I'd say definitely get a good shaving soap and shower before you shave. You're gonna have to find the angle that works best for your blade. Different brands have different blades so if you're constantly getting cut up or not getting a close enough shave, try a different brand of blades. I know you're not supposed to shave against the grain, but I've managed to get it down pretty well with no cuts and actually  dry shave to line up the top of my beard. Hope this helps."
malegrooming,3aywq4,ActionJackson22,2,Wed Jun 24 17:18:41 2015 UTC,"The best tip I can give you is to actually listen. It's instant feedback. If you here the hairs getting cut well, there's your angle. Everyone has a different angle."
malegrooming,3aywq4,thebaldeaglee,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:32:45 2015 UTC,This! Make sure it is quiet when you shave. Start with the comb of the razor at an angle that would not cut the hair and then slowly adjust the angle of attack so it cuts the hair smoothly.   Another thing you may or may not know is the strategy with this kind of shaving is reduction. Don't try shave all the hair in a single pass. First pass is with the grain. Second pass is across the grain. Third pass when you are confident is against the grain.  Make the time to study your beard to see exactly which direction the hair grows.
malegrooming,3aywq4,Blazedone,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:14:11 2015 UTC,"I have to keep my razor at a much shallower angle (so the handle is almost perpendicular to my face) than I did with Mach 3s and the like.  It took some getting used to, too, and lots of uneven and missed spots.  It's just going to take some experimentation and practice.  As for +/u/ActionJackson22's comment about the top of his beard, I have yet to get a good result with a safety razor and shaping my beard / goatee / sideburns.  Luckily, I have a straight razor, too, and I'll use that to get nice clean lines, even when I hit the rest of my face and neck with the safety."

malegrooming,3asxpf,Revvy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:16:03 2015 UTC,"I should rephrase, I don't mean to say that malnutrition will always lead to hair loss. Women that suffer from eating disorders often don't get enough fatty acids or iron, these deficiencies can be a cause for hair loss. Eating disorders also put stress on the body and can lead to hormone imbalances which could also have an effect on hair loss. It might be more gender specific because the iron deficiency is exacerbated by menstrual periods, I don't really know.  Basically, Instead of sending nutrients to hair, the body sends it to vital organs. So it could take a couple months before hair starts to fall out. Maybe in cases like TB and concentration camps people die quicker than that? I dunno."

Buy a base oil (jojoba oil works great, so does avocado oil) and an essential oil or several of your preference for smell (sandalwood, rosewood, tobacco, whatever you like) and mix them (95% base oil with a few drops of essential oils). Then use it on your beard. Also works as pre shave oil and as an aftershave."

So I made the switch to just regular deodorants and haven't had any troubles yet. I've even been complemented a few times for always smelling good, especially by my gf of 15 years who was surprised that even though I was a big guy and would sweat whenever doing something active, she never smelled BO or foul odors from me."

When it works, there is less water everywhere, but if the pressure builds up too much, then there could actually be more. That's been my experience; switched to non-aluminum deodorant several years ago and haven't looked back.

Then moisturize your ass with a noncomedogenic moisturizer.  You may wash with acne treatments containing benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid if you have recurring problems, which kill bacteria, dissolve dead skin cells, oil and dirt, and dry your skin.  Be sure to moisturize after using one of these, as your ass skin will get dry.  Avoid touching your ass, especially the big ass pimple, as this will irritate it and transfer more oil/dirt/bacteria to it.  Your diet also is important in how healthy your ass skin is: make sure to eat lots of veggies, keep the junk food to a minimum.  Avoid processed food for whole food, don't smoke.  Head over to /r/nutrition to learn more about a healthy, balanced diet for your ass.  As far as removing big ass pimples, there's really nothing to do.  Popping them can make an acne outbreak worse and leave scars on your ass, and your moon might end up looking cratered.  Just keep with your regular hygiene regimen and the whitehead will eventually drain on its own.    No more big ass pimples.  Or wait, did you mean ""big-ass pimples""?  Well, same advice."

Triclosan is one of the antibiotics medical researchers are proposing to remove from almost all over the counter meds in order to reduce antibiotic resistance.

My advice: just keep using regular antiperspirant/deodorants complete with their aluminum compounds.

Alum is the common name for this chemical compound, given the nomenclature of potassium aluminum sulfate dodecahydrate.

malegrooming,3a3s8f,ddddamn,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:10:13 2015 UTC,Does this work even if your brows are already black? I've been toying with the idea of buying one of those makeup things that you apply to your eyebrow to make them look fuller because that seems like the cheapest route.

The oil itself when applied can make hairs look thicker, and the act of massaging the area can stimulate some hair growth, so it may be a combination of the two.  I think you can try things like rogaine or specific formulas for eyebrow growth but from what I understand if you stop using them then your eyebrows will just revert to how they were before."

I was an avid user of this, but now i have have changed to just deodorant. The ingredient in the antiperspirant---> Aluminum-based compounds are the most widely used active antiperspirant ingredient because they effectively plug up sweat ducts to temporarily stop the flow of moisture to the skin. ... if you read, it says there is no negative effects to this. But in my mind, soaking tiny bits of metal into your skin, is probably best to be avoided in life. Now I use a regular deodorant stick... And its all I need... I think you should get a regular deodorant stick, try it for a week. it will cure any smelly pits. but if you realize that you are hella sweaty (and it bothers you), try the antiperspirant and see how you like it."
malegrooming,3a0tde,the82ndbuttmunch,2,Wed Jun 17 03:27:21 2015 UTC,The question was answered elsewhere. Keep in mind that anti-perspirant can discolor the armpits of clothing when put in the dryer before it is 100% clean. If you don't need its property to reduce moisture then skip it!

Although some people don't have the right type of face for it (very round heads and faces don't always look good with the short sides and long hair on top) and I don't think people should be recommending things to people when they can't or might not pull it off.
malegrooming,39r3ip,FiendishSniper,6,Sun Jun 14 07:46:35 2015 UTC,"Because you can only recommend something from the materials a person has to work with.

Half the posts I see are, ""I'm getting a haircut in 45 seconds, tell me exactly what will make women literally gush""  I could tell them to wait the year for something like this, but most want something right now. So, something like this will work better for their short term goals. They may not be able to get that exact cut right now, but they can get something approximating it that will look good enough till it grows in more.  On top of that it seems like a large demographic on this sub is late teens early 20s, where their face hasn't matured enough to pull off a long cut with out a beard, which most can't grow, or they look like they're 10."

malegrooming,39fx2o,jitsudiver,0,Thu Jun 11 19:00:42 2015 UTC,"Those are ingrown hairs.  To a certain extent they're a fact of non-bearded life (if you can call that a life), but there are a few things you can do - 1) Exfoliate - don't go crazy, but get something that has salicylic acid in it 2) Moisturize - this should be key to your bathing ritual anyways, but it's of even more significance on your face when you shave.  Whenever you're done with shaving and aftershave, put some good moisturizer with some SPF (not for ingrown hairs, but sunscreen is important buddy). 3) An interesting approach, first rinse your face with warm/hot water, then use cold water while actually shaving (the warm water softens your hairs, the cold water hardens your razor), then wash your face with cold water before you do whatever aftershave stuff you do.  On a side note, if possible avoid aftershave with alcohol in it.  I don't follow this personally when I shave around my beard, but avoiding dry skin is the name of the game when it comes to ingrown hairs.  For exfoliating, before you moisturize you can also take a boar bristle brush to your face, toughen up that mug a bit.  Best of luck jack.  Edit: I forgot to add - put the maximum possible time in between your shaves.  Unless you grow facial hair really fast, don't shave every day.  If the hair is too short you aren't cutting it off, you're just jamming it into your skin."

malegrooming,396dfr,Khalku,6,Tue Jun 9 19:34:31 2015 UTC,"You'll need to have it completely grown out and presentable by the time you're interviewing. Hair growth in process is usually sloppy looking.  Also, if you dress impeccably well, like expensive tailored clothes, then I think you can get away with it. If you're just coming in with your long hair and clothes you picked up at department store, you're not going to look too good. Its really the whole package and image you're presenting, not necessarily just the hair.  I would say, stay away from it. If you really, really want that look, then I say go for it, but you'll have to understand that people will view you differently and that will effect things. It just depends whats more important to you, expressing yourself or having a career type job in business. There's no right answer, its just what you want and what will make you happy."
malegrooming,396dfr,abqcub,2,Tue Jun 9 17:34:02 2015 UTC,"I think ""contemporary"" hairstyles are gaining acceptance, but unfortunately, it might steer away some potential employers. I'm graduating in Dec. 2016 (also Asian male, with thick black hair) with a degree similar to business and I've had professors tell me I need to cut my hair for career fairs and it wasn't even as long as the pic of you when you were 17! I also have another friend who could have gotten any job (high GPA, charismatic, active in professional organizations) have to cut his hair (also shorter than the length of your 17 pic) because a few companies he was interviewing with requested him to.   I think the issue is the people hiring our generation in our field still aren't keen on longer hair on guys because they think it looks unprofessional. I would suggest against it, especially for next year when you're applying for first time jobs. Who knows? You may land a job where after they hire you, they couldn't give two shits about your hair.

malegrooming,396dfr,Skizzle5,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:28:22 2015 UTC,"I reckon it all comes down to how you actually present yourself, that would say a lot more about you than your actual hair. As said in this thread, if you wore good fitted clothing, were well groomed and in good shape physically to show you looked after yourself and how you present yourself to the world, I think a man-bun would be okay.   You wouldn't be able to get away with ill fitted or unmanaged clothing / grooming for a second though as it'll appear as if you aren't a man who takes good care of himself."
malegrooming,3962vh,adulaire,3,Tue Jun 9 14:55:50 2015 UTC,"These three devices are actually not as complicated as you might think, don't despair!  The breakdown is as follows:     Shaver: I'm going to assume you are referring to either a foil shaver or a rotary shaver, the difference between these two subsets of shaver are explained nicely here.  This type of shaver is only useful on your face to shave your beard and moustache, it will not work on any other part of your body as the blades inside the heads would quickly become clogged with hair, if it could even grab the hair to cut it in the first place.  I would say this is not what you are looking for.     Trimmer: The electric trimmer is useful on facial hair and body hair as the blades are finer than a clipper and usually any trimmer will ship with a variety of length attachments, or ""hair -cutting guides"".  I would go with a trimmer if the primary function is to use it on facial hair or you are planning on using it for body hair (arms, legs, groin, chest, back, etc) as the trimmer can handle this type of hair, which is exactly what you described.  Check out this review to give you some ideas what to look for in a trimmer and an idea of the cost of some of the more popular devices.     Clippers: Clippers are generally sold as hair clippers as they have wider blades than a trimmer and are primarily used for clipping or cutting the hair on top of you head.  They also usually ship with a variety of attachments for different lengths of cut but are not really useful on any part of your body except on top of you head.  If you have really long or thick hair on some other part of your body a clipper may be useful, but again I don't think a clipper is what you are after.     From your initial description you should look at electric trimmers and leave the shavers and clippers for another day.  Like I said most trimmers will come with length attachments and I've found either the 3mm (the shortest one) or no guide at all (using the trimmer blades themselves) work the best for body hair.  Trimmers are also useful if you want a buzz-cut on the top of your head.  Most trimmers will also have a little switch on the side that adjusts the blades for either cutting (to actually cut or trim the hair) or for thinning (the trimmer won't actually cut the hair but rather thin the hair out, similar to how a barber/hairdresser may use thinning scissors to reduce the thickness of hair), so you'll want to make sure that you have the switch in the right direction otherwise you may think it's not working properly!"

Most of the beard and body trimmers today can double-up on all body hair, even if they are not marketed as such, so really you can't go wrong.

I don't personally shave my neck separately from my face but if you're going to I would suggest you shave the line under your chin, not down your neck as a crooked line is very visible.  I would also say leave the upper lip alone; even though the hair may be sparse it will still be symmetrical, whereas shaving it could potentially leave asymmetric lines on your face, and that would be very noticeable."

malegrooming,38zit6,CrimsonKings,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:10:50 2015 UTC,"Happens to me too. I'm a male too so plucking my eyebrow was not something that came naturally and was highly embarrassing to ask about.  Anyway, few good tips that has helped me prevent this:   Only pluck immediately after the shower, preferably a hot shower. This opens up your pours and make it easier to pluck the hairs without any complications. Immediately after plucking, splash your eyebrow area where you plucked with COLD water. This does the opposite and closes your pours so nothing can get inside and infect them. Pat dry with a towel. Put on some smoothing aloe vera gel after pat drying the cold water off. Try to get as pure aloe gel as possible (99-100%) otherwise there's a lot of other stuff in there like alcohol which isn't good. Avoid the stuff made for sunburns. I get a tube of 99% pure aloe vera gel at GNC for 99 cents (a fitness store in Canada).   Good luck!"

You'll know you found the right one when you tell them what you want and they're able to pull it off. If I took that photo to my current barber, for example, she'd say that she can do it and she'd offer me a couple different similar styles that might work better for me. If she's convinced a certain way would look good, I let her run with it and I'm always pleased with the outcome. You'll likely be paying twice as much, but it really is worth it. Also, my barber serves beer on tap from a local brewery while you get your cut, which is pretty awesome."

Before you try anything do a test patch and see how it reacts with your skin, wouldn't want to spread something all over your skin that you're allergic to. Stop taking super hot showers, may feel good but you're drying yourself out. Only water touching your face should be cold.    Here's mine though: Morning: cerave foaming cleanser while in shower, cerave moisturizer (in the tub) after I get out, and a light sunscreen before I leave. Night: cerave foaming cleanser then red stridex. Once a week I do a mask of ACV and Aztec clay."

Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine.

malegrooming,38liec,1991_VG,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:49:02 2015 UTC,"Pompadour (hairstyle):       Pompadour refers to a hairstyle which is named for Madame de Pompadour (1721–1764), mistress of King Louis XV.  Although there are numerous variations of the style for both women and men, the basic concept is hair swept upwards from the face and worn high over the forehead, and sometimes upswept around the sides and back as well.  After its initial popularity among fashionable women in the 18th century, the style was revived as part of the Gibson Girl look in the 1890s and continued to be in vogue until World War I. The style was in vogue for women once again in the 1940s. The men's version, as worn by early country and rock and roll stars such as Elvis Presley, was popular in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Variations of the pompadour style continue to be worn by men and women in the 21st century.    Image i     Interesting: Quiff | Wayne Cochran | Bouffant   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

It helped me significantly with the ingrown hairs and irritation I was getting from using canned shaving cream and a cartridge razor. The multi-blades of a cartridge pull the hair and cut it below the surface, which increases your risk for ingrown hairs. By using a single blade (such as in a double edge razor), you're eliminating that risk. Many people who have switched (both men and women) have noticed significant improvements.

Also, if you plan on keeping it, consider using beard oil, it'll keep the hair soft and healthy. I bought this starter pack thing and enjoy it. You can also get beard balm which acts as beard oil, also helps you style and control it, but will have a greasy feeling for potentially an hour or more, where as the oil soaks in with in 15 minutes-ish.

malegrooming,37yitm,midastouch42,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:23:11 2015 UTC,"Danger triangle of the face:       The danger triangle of the face consists of the area from the corners of the mouth to the bridge of the nose, including the nose and maxilla.    (pp345–346)Due to the special nature of the blood supply to the human nose and surrounding area, it is possible for retrograde infections from the nasal area to spread to the brain causing cavernous sinus thrombosis, meningitis or brain abscess.  This is possible because of venous communication (via the ophthalmic veins) between the facial vein and the cavernous sinus. The cavernous sinus lies within the cranial cavity, between layers of the meninges and is a major conduit of venous drainage from the brain.   It is a common misconception that the veins of the head do not contain one-way valves like other veins of the circulatory system. In fact, it is not the absence of venous valves but the existence of communications between the facial vein and cavernous sinus and the direction of blood flow that is important in the spread of infection from the face. Most people, but not all, have valves in the veins of the face.

malegrooming,37o2pm,Rerichael,1 point,Fri May 29 17:54:25 2015 UTC,"The trick is to not take off too much.  Another important thing is where to start and stop the eyebrow. If you draw an imaginary line from the center of each nostril up to your eyebrow, that is where they should start.  To determine where they should end you can make a line from the tip of your nose to the outside corner of your eye. Then, just continue that line till it hits your eyebrow, and that is where they should end."

You'll still have ""manly"" hair and it will look natural.  Doing this about once a month will keep it looking neat and tidy.  If you don't like it let it grow back; laser hair removal is too permanent and you can't go back."

Hairy arms are gonna be hairy arms, I've never found a way to reduce the bulk without making it look weird, you'll just have to deal. But I usually trim my lower legs with a 6-7 on my trimmer about 3-4 times a year. Usually it reduces the bulk enough that it's less ""damn, you're fucking hairy"" and more just hairier than everyone else. I also keep my upper legs pretty low. My partners may notice but I'm sure they'd prefer it.   Experiment with a trimmer but DONT try anything drastic right away. And it's not necessarily true that it comes back thicker, but if you've never trimmed/shaved/cut a hair before, it has a fine end. If you do do one of those things, it gives it a flat end which gives a less smooth looking look."

But my dermatologists recommends less blades, the more blades the more root is pulled up and causes more irritation when it grows. I would recommend a safety razor, personally.   Also shaving in a hot shower, using a beard oil, then shave cream and following with a good after shave (shaveworks works well) can help a great deal. You can find these things at Sephora. Also starting to shave with the grain for the time being instead of against.   Good luck, will take a few shaves to get use to it."

malegrooming,37f6nx,monofonik,3,Wed May 27 16:39:39 2015 UTC,I think it'd look a lot better if you didn't shape it. Just let it grow naturally and see how it turns out.
malegrooming,37f6nx,nikdahl,2,Wed May 27 17:40:13 2015 UTC,You are over trimming it in my opinion.  The very thin jawline beard only looks good on a few guys.  The small columns from the jawline pointing to the corner of the mouth look particularly out of place.  What happens if you just let it grow in naturally?  Do you have the growth to at least connect the beard and mustache?

The fact that the beard is board straight across the cheek is less ideal to me, I'd let it get lower gradually as it approaches the moustache, rather than having the outline, as you call it, appear all at once."
malegrooming,37co8p,I_fight_demons,2,Tue May 26 18:10:32 2015 UTC,Great suggestion. Could you give me a picture of what you have in mind so I can better understand what you mean?  The reason I prefer the outline is mostly because of symmetry. The right side grows in a way that shows a light gap there anyway so I do the other side to balance it out. I imagine if I rounded it like you mentioned it'd probably solve that problem.
malegrooming,37co8p,I_fight_demons,2,Tue May 26 18:24:51 2015 UTC,"Quick google images showed these lines:  http://grooming.wahl.com/sites/default/files/Facial_AroundTheMouth_TightBeard3.jpg  http://images.yuku.com.s3.amazonaws.com/image/pjpeg/0a236e8f1de9460c9c70dbc0826c4afb17cbe15c.pjpg  The point of these pics is that the cheek line is low enough that it ends somewhere at or just below the corner of the mouth.  Like many men, you have a natural cheek line that peaks up in the center of the cheek before coming back down- that very rarely looks good.  I added some sick MS paint visualizations to your posted pics.  You are lucky in that your mustache is thick and unbroken, so you don't have to worry about keeping the cheeks and chin high enough to connect without a gap (second pic above has this problem).

I mulched my face up. My way of thinking is. If it takes the hair off your face nicely without causing any irritation or damage then do it.  It is YOUR face, No one knows your skin better than you do. Use trial and error to find the best way to groom yourself using the tools you find best.   It really bothers me when people start barking about technique. I can go online and find thousands of different ways to shave. Out of them all a VERY famous line came out that people seem to ignore these days. Different stroked for different folks.   Find your own way and do it :) Just because this guy has his own stroke and he is showing off how well an old razor is compared to the news ones that try to sell you on ""1 blade is crap"" nonsense doesnt mean he is trying to convince you to use the same strokes as he does.  IMO he should be using a shave bar instead of a can but who knows. perhaps he has a reason for that. No one knows unless they ask him."

Other stuff you can try if you don't want to switch razors: lather, then hot damp towel on face for 1 minute, then re-lather, then shave.'  Also, be sure you're not pressing too hard.

I can shave against the grain anywhere else on my face, but if I go against the grain on my neck I get to deal with acne-esque razor burn for the next couple of days. To make it even harder the hair on my neck grows in crazy directions as it approaches my Adam's apple so the grain isn't consistent.  My suggestion is to do your neck first thing in the shave, after you've had a hot shower or used a hot towel to soften the hair. Feel for the direction that the hair is the most coarse (against the grain) and shave opposite of that direction. If you are using a multiblade razor for the rest of your face, you might want to invest in a single blade or safety razor so you can minimize the irritation of multiple passes over a sensitive area. I personally use a Gillette Fusion Proglide, which has 5 blades, but on the top of it there is a single ""precision trimmer"" that acts essentially like a safety razor. Good luck!"

I normally do a regular shower, then spend 1-2 minutes with my face directly in the water, gradually turning up the heat. use a pre-shave oil/cream for the first pass under your harry's.  for oil I like the pacific shaving, but right now my favorite is the proraso cream don't go against the grain.  I know it's tempting, especially in problem areas. rinse with COLD water use an aftershave.  a bit counterintuitive, but I actually really like the alcohol-based stuff.  seems to do the best job, though it will sting a bit if you had a rough shave.  speick is my favorite.  lucky tiger isn't alcohol based and smells friggin amazing if that's more your speed.   hope this helps."

But adjust that for how long you grow your hair. My mustache takes a really long time to grow so I did it this way.

Alternatively look at getting it trim up to above the collar line as a halfway measure. Beard trim is needed, I would trim up the side burns to the same length as the rest of your beard. Also shave the back of your jawline to give it shape. From the pics its hard to tell but the hair at the back of your jaw seems softer, do you trim this as often as the front? It looks a little patchy so thinning the front and back to the same length regularly may give it time to fill in, that's or you want to keep the beard. Just an after thought but what are you looking to change? Do you gave any pics of what you are working towards? I've recently gone from mid-long to short hair again, I got some pics from Google and put myself at the mercy of a barber. Its fun to take a chance and the hair will always grow back."

Pedro Pascal is another great example of a goatee done right. I also like the one DiCaprio is sporting in Blood Diamond. You'll notice they have in common to be kept rather short. Warning: it won't go with any face. If your facial structure allows it, go for it.   If not, a full beard, well trimmed on the neck (and cheeks if really necessary) is always a safer bet."

malegrooming,36tc3u,Frankensteins_Sohn,3,Fri May 22 10:36:11 2015 UTC,"It looks pretty good in my opinion. The moustache is maybe a little weird when he smiles like that. As for full beard, you can go anywhere from here, to here, to here or even there. Just avoid two extremes : the hobo look when the beard is left wild and untrimmed or the too defined beard where the cheek line is unnatural. Go to /r/beard to find other good examples and advices on trimming. Just don't take it too seriously, some people there think a beard is a good substitute to personality. As a rule of thumb, put your hand on your neck like you're trying to chocke yourself. That's your neck line. The cheek line should be mostly left untouched, apart from random hair outside of the beard zone."

Someone told me that it did not suit my face at all.  I told my barber this the next time I saw him, and he was like ""Yeah, I don't think that worked for you either.""  Sigh.)  I feel I need someone to tell me what I need, what works, what doesn't.  Barbers (or maybe my barber) need more self-assured, less neurotic clients than I am able to be.

I don't know if that alum block is necessary when you're using an electric razor though. That said, I have Nivea for Men After Shave (throw in a 'Sensitive' there too, I think) which I really enjoy.  tl;dr - TAoS is probably charging more for what you get than other places would."

malegrooming,36rkw0,canada_mike,1 point,Thu May 21 19:04:03 2015 UTC,"when I was using electric I had a product that was meant to be used before the shave - pre electric shave or something like that, to help minimize the bumps. Definitely helped, I noticed the bumps on days when I forgot to use the stuff. You can shave over the bumps but you might irritate your skin depending on how sensitive it is. I'd leave it for a day or so to let it clear up, then find yourself a good pre electric shave lotion"

I generally push against the grain with my finger and trim off whatever hair goes past the brow line.  I've been doing this for quite sometime and after a while it'll become second nature.   Edit: The scissors I use are similar to these. The rounded tip helps to prevent accidents.  Also, just to add to my comment, as far as the center goes just try to follow the arcs of your nose so it looks fairly natural.  Hope this helps."

Not too much. In fact, you're really just pulling your hair back with a towel. Just give it a few shakes so you can get all of it.  The idea is that you are soaking up and breaking off any extra pomade that is built up, leaving just a thin layer of the pomade that directly applied to your hair."
malegrooming,36jfb4,guy15s,3,Tue May 19 21:43:18 2015 UTC,I guess I'll have to wipe it out after my hair has dried..maybe I'll try a blowdryer to see if that will help speed things up without messing up the pomade.

It's nice when I use it, but as the day goes by, my hair just looks better and the next morning, it just looks amazing.  You can either work around your shower schedule and put it on at night if you shower at night and let it dry out naturally. If you shower in the morning, then you can use a hair blow dryer. I know plenty of guys that use one to dry their hair faster but without having to use their towel a second time."

malegrooming,36i563,tannc,2,Tue May 19 21:44:17 2015 UTC,"Best thing you could do in that case is grow it longer. Allow the hairs that start higher up on your chin to grow longer. Trim that starts toward the tip of your chin until the upper hair reaches the same length. At that point, let both grow naturally.  The result of all this will be a fairly full wicked looking chin strap. If you keep the sides of it around 1-2 inches max in length, and just grow the chin portion outwards, you could get something like this, just without the mustache. It would look pretty good."

The benefits are too many to list, but there are a few I want to share with this group:   Skin Clarity - the oils used in (good) shaving creams and soaps provide a lot of health benefits to one skin. Additionally, shaving with a DE (double edge - the kind im selling) razor will reduce ingrown hairs and irritations when compared to using whatever shave tech Gillette is unleashing on the world when you DE shave properly.  Cost - either with my service or others - DE shaving is way cheaper than using cartridge razors. The only thing cheaper is the cheapest razors on dollar shave club which are NO good...  Waste - the amount of waste with plastic disposables is loads more than the little blades DE shaving puts to waste.  Enjoyment - DE wet shaving is almost therapeutic, its a fun skill to learn and its how your grandpa shaved along with General Patton, Benjamin Franklin, or JFK!

I had a friend who got pretty jacked over the course of the year using one as his primary means of working out (+running) and I have one at my home for when I visit from school that I use.  Something about having an actual workout item that's also versatile makes it a little bit easier to get in the workout mood compared to say just pushups on the floor and dips off a chair etc.  /r/fitness and /r/bodybuilding would be good resources to try and pick up a basic workout plan/routine.

malegrooming,36ems4,Unsounded,1 point,Thu May 21 14:50:54 2015 UTC,"So with those pull-up bars there are 4 common variations of ""pull-ups""   Slightly wider than shoulder width overhand grip which is your standard pull-up shoulder width underhand grip which is your chin-up shoulder width neutral grip (thumbs facing you, pinkies facing the wall) which is a neutral grip pull-up wider than shoulder width grip which is a wide grip pull-up   In terms of difficulty from greatest to least it usually goes  wide grip > standard grip > chin-up > neutral grip  The different ways you can use this information is to try harder pull-up variations before easier ones since they exert more effort and since you can likely squeeze out more reps towards the end of a workout on the easier variations, OR if you haven't reached the harder variations start from the easier ones and build strength at those to be able to do the more difficult variations  Another thing to consider trying is negative pull-ups, where you can pick any of the pull-up variations and start standing on a chair in the end of the pullup motion, step off the chair and resist gravity pushing you down as long as you can and repeat. It'll work the same muscle groups used for a pullups from the hanging position and overtime it'll build the strength you'll need to pull yourself up from a hang to the end of the motion"

The best soap I've used for simple face cleansing is the basic Neutrogena transparent bar.  Also, make sure you keep your skin adequately moisturized with a simple moisturizer. The skin under your beard is prone to drying and can lead to break-outs along the hairline.  Good luck!"

I kept it clean most of the time but every few months I'd let it grow out to see what was happening with my facial hair. At 20 I grew a beard and haven't looked back.  My advice to OP. Keep the sideburns if you really need something. otherwise keep it clean and let it grow out once or twice a year just to see what is happening. Its better to be baby face than look like a tree with half its leaves.

Safety razors are as close a shave as one can get, free of commercialized gimmicky shit, 20x more satisfying, and cheaper in the long run (my $70 upfront investment should last me 2 years and <$20/year after that). However, this comes at the cost of time. Most redditors seem to take 10-15 minutes vs. The 45-second runs I'm used to).

malegrooming,366ib6,IamSeth,5,Sat May 16 18:42:26 2015 UTC,"I agree, either tight fade or taper leave a little on the top gradually comb your hair back so it can grow in that direction, use hair nets etc.. Slick back w/ pomade, I recommend water soluble-then pompadour thus giving an allusion of height. Good luck"
malegrooming,366ib6,dangles11,5,Sat May 16 19:11:03 2015 UTC,Illusion. Allusion is a different word.
malegrooming,366ib6,themisanthrope,4,Sun May 17 00:52:18 2015 UTC,"A tight fade is easy to get. Ask for a fade on the sides, but enough hair on top to do a combover. I usually get a .5 on the sides, but you could ask for a 1 or 2. a little pomade and combing will do the trick once you get a cut. But, its all experimenting bud, find out what works for you."
malegrooming,366ib6,themisanthrope,3,Sat May 16 23:37:28 2015 UTC,"OP - I'll echo what others have said:  Grow out on top a bit, and go for a tight fade (I like a fade to go high and usually ask the barber to use a #1).  I prefer a gentleman's cut that tapers/fades.  You look like your hair is a bit poofy and thick, which is great - but you may need some pomade to hold it down no matter which style you choose.  Also - I can't really tell if that's a little beard you've got going on your chin, but you should get rid of that if that's the case.  Chin patch beards are.......just don't have one.  Clean shave, stubble, mustache, or full beard."
malegrooming,366ib6,themisanthrope,2,Sun May 17 02:42:43 2015 UTC,Haha! Thanks for the great advise. Read your comment. Went to the washroom. Trimmed off the 'little beard' :P  Getting a tight fade very soon.
malegrooming,366ib6,ifixyourigear,1 point,Sun May 17 18:24:48 2015 UTC,"Ultimately the idea is to look good and feel good.  What your idea of ""looking good"" may very well be entirely different from what my idea is.  Try new things, see if they work for you and make you look/feel good.  If they don't? That's ok - try something else!  I will say that when you go to the barber, if you just say ""tight fade"", they may cut the top short as well like in this ""Caesar"" hairstyle. Don't ever get that haircut unless you want to look like Lloyd Christmas.   Pay a little extra money and go to a ""hip"" barbershop in your town (if you live in a bigger city there is likely to be several - they're popping up more and more) and ask for a ""gentleman's cut"" if you like those pictures I posted before.  If you don't have a barbershop, find a reasonably priced salon that cuts men's hair (check on Yelp). Part on the side  (you may need to grow your hair out some and use pomade), tight fade (#1 attachment) on the sides.  A good barber/stylist will know what you're talking about - it's all about knowing what you want (which can be tough), but again - a good stylist/barber will work with you."
malegrooming,366ib6,nojloi,1 point,Sun May 17 19:42:45 2015 UTC,"So I went on and got the haircut. I don't know what to call it exactly. Not 100% content. But, I think it will get better with some more experiments. Feel free to throw in some of those advises, if you have the time and will.  http://i.imgur.com/m4SrJev.jpg?1 http://i.imgur.com/wl0rL8y.jpg?1  Where I live it takes a little less than $2 to get a haircut. Third world problem :P  The barbers don't have any idea what a tight fade or any of that is. So basically, I had to give every bit of instruction with the aid of google images. I'm supposed move to Long Island soon. It's close to NYC so I'll find myself a good barbershop.  I'd give you some gold, if I had any. Thanks again."
malegrooming,366ib6,ifixyourigear,2,Sun May 17 20:39:21 2015 UTC,"Wow - looks fantastic!  It seems like you have very ""stubborn"" hair that sticks up.  This may be difficult to do the traditional ""gentleman's cut"", but I think what you've got going here is great.  I know it may not be exactly what you envisioned, but it looks really good dude - so no worries there.    Also - you're right, once you get to Long Island, there will be tons of places you can get it cut with perhaps more ""professional"" barbers.  Also, also - it's always great to bring a photo of what you want (several photos, really).  It can be tough to describe looks, at least for me!  Big ups for putting yourself out on the internet for all to judge - and big ups for following through and giving us the follow-up!"

malegrooming,366o40,_Jim_Lahey_,4,Sat May 16 17:58:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly dude, that beard doesn't look good. The main issues you've already stated, sparse and pubey (your words).  BUT! There's a solution that I think you ought to give a try. If you're adamant about not having a moustache, then you should trim what you have down to a better controlled 'chin curtain'  The best way to get better looking results from what you have is to trim down to a 2 or 3, BLEND YOUR SIDEBURNS!, and make sure the width of the 'curtain' remains consistent starting from your burns all the way to your chin and then to the other side.  This will give you a much more groomed appearance.  It will be a considerable amount of upkeep but trust me, you'll like it, girls will like a better groomed man, and the job will appreciate your heightened attention to your appearance.  Best of luck, brother. And keep us updated with what you decide."
malegrooming,366o40,RetroTexan,1 point,Sat May 16 22:01:22 2015 UTC,"Stache is actually an option. It's Orlando bloomish when it grows in. Curtain beard, huh? I'll think about that one."
malegrooming,366o40,wlonkly,4,Sun May 17 03:43:28 2015 UTC,"Pubeyness aside, I notice you've shaved your mustache, which makes me wonder how much of your cheeks and under your lip you're shaving too. Right now your beard is all on your neck which isn't flattering on anyone.  What do you get if you let it all grow in, mustache and all? If the texture doesn't work at that length you might be able to just do maintained stubble."
malegrooming,366o40,IamSeth,1 point,Sat May 16 22:46:09 2015 UTC,"Basically the pubeyness gets worse the longer it gets. Maybe I just wasn't being thorough enough with the trimmer though (I noticed later I could take several passes over the same spot and still get new stragglers hairs).  The mustache is a maybe, but my beard only extends about a half inch farther up my cheeks and is even thinner than the 'smile lines' you see now. Not even close to connecting to the stache. I have Orlando Bloom stache when it grows out."
malegrooming,366o40,-XIII-,5,Sun May 17 03:38:13 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, a beard without a mustache only looks good on the amish. I'd say shave it off if you're not going to commit to the look."

malegrooming,367cn2,hairtw222,2,Sat May 16 21:40:45 2015 UTC,Pomade is the right choice but there are so many different types it can be tough to choose. For more volume you might want to try a leave-in volumizing conditioner.

Pomade is usually a little (or a lot) on the slick side, and in my experience doesn't lend itself to volume. The guys that get huge height and volume with pomade seem to do it by creating space, either through combing or with an afro pick or something."

After using a Vol Shampoo and Conditioner, I blowdry the hair while combing it back and up, then I apply a some pomade while combing it back, and add hairspray. Throughout the morning (once it drys) I run my fingers through it to give my hair extra volume. I don't have a picture of me with it, but I've been told it looks exactly like the models hair!

malegrooming,3643nc,eskamobob1,3,Sat May 16 05:05:35 2015 UTC,Without being mean that's not a great beard. The neckline is a fraction too high but that can be fixed. What is a concern is how patchy it is.   I'd shave it tbh. Unless you can grow a full beard its just going to look seedy. I can grow a full beard but I'm getting chunks of white patches growing in because I'm slowly morphing into Santa. As soon as that happened the beard had to go.

If you're just the chest and stomach and the occational line of hairs down the back it might work to trim or shave entirely. If you also work out and have something to show for it you can go smooth on the chest, stomach and back and totally rock it. On the other hand, if the hairs extend to shoulders and covering the back it might be more trouble than it's worth. Might be better to rock the grizzled manly-man look instead."

Shave the thin patches on your cheeks to give a clean line to the beard, and shape your neck/jaw to give a clean line as well.    Here is a quality post about trimming a beard.  You don't need all the tools the guy uses in his post (hell I get away with a comb, beard trimmer, and a disposable razor).    A beard is definitely something that you'll be playing with for the next few months to find out what works best for you.

Which was much worse for me.   Tweezing only the few most offensive out-of-line hairs is what has worked best for me. The hairs then grow back and different rates, so the stubble effect is eliminated. They also don't look 'clipped', which I think is due to how they grow back.  Going to a salon for waxing can produce a very sharp line, but that's quite a dramatic affect. I suggest giving tweezing a try first."

malegrooming,35pp6c,LegWaxThrowaway,1 point,Tue May 12 14:21:35 2015 UTC,"Bloke here who hasn't had his legs waxed, but has waxed other areas of his body.   First of all - it is a myth that hair grows back thicker and darker after shaving. In actual fact, the end of the hair is blunt from the shaving and not tapered so it will only appear to be thicker.   Regrowth from waxing takes longer, and the hair will come back looking basically the same as it did pre-waxing. It is usually after a couple of waxing sessions that you will find the hair starts to grow back slower and there's less of it.   The cost may not be worth it if the hair on your legs aren't that noticeable to begin with. I would suggest trying other less expensive routes first to see how you feel. Shaving is a relatively inexpensive way of getting a feel for things, and if you don't like it or don't get the reaction you hoped it doesn't matter because within a few days everything should be back to normal.   If you do wax though the results will be for around 2 - 6 weeks. It can be expensive depending on where you go but I would always go to a professional with a good reputation than some dodgy cheap salon where there is no guarantee of quality. That's from someone who's had a horrendous back and shoulder waxing that left me literally bruised and bleeding. I didn't get any grief when I had it done - most people frankly don't care.  If you're just doing it for reactions, try shaving or using something like nair (be careful you don't leave it on too long!). If the response is positive - elect to invest in a good waxing session. Hope that helped!"

I'd reiterate that it will take a couple of sessions to get the longest-lasting result (because at first, there will be lots of just-emerging hair that won't get caught, but after a couple or 3 times, most of the hair is starting to regrow at the same time.  Waxing a guy's legs in not much different from waxing a lady's, but yes, do find someone who specialises in male waxing OR is very confident about dealing with very hairier bodies."
malegrooming,35mmtr,King_of_Beets,21,Mon May 11 19:22:52 2015 UTC,I personally would shave it clean. It's quite meagre and there is a clear spot under your nose that looks silly. I think you have a nice face and hair and the beard gives you an unkempt and messy look that does you no favors.
malegrooming,35mmtr,CrimsonKings,15,Mon May 11 19:52:09 2015 UTC,Always a bit of a lottery the first time you grow a beard! You never know where the patches lurk until your try. I'd shave that off to be honest mate

malegrooming,35mmtr,theballsdeeper,1 point,Tue May 12 00:48:50 2015 UTC,"I can grow an ok beard now but use a trimmer and keep it pretty low. 5mm setting at max, usually lower.     When I first tried I used a stubble trimmer to keep it even and give the slower patches time to come through. Then just keep increasing the trimmer settings as it grows in. You can see how the even beard looks as it grows in, as the best growing areas will be cut down to match the slower growing areas. If it's still no good you can shave it off."
malegrooming,35mmtr,ExpertOnNicheThings,1 point,Tue May 12 02:19:28 2015 UTC,Maybe try a sort of stubbly look? If it isn't flattering you can always just shave it the rest of the way off.

The thing with Murray's pomade is that the actual pomade itself is very difficult to wash off. Sure it is strong, but there's a price you gotta pay for maximum hold...and thats the washing off of it. Ive heard stories of people using vinegar and other stuff to get it off. I didnt really mind it. I washed my hair and yes I can still feel the texture of it in my hair after I get out of the shower but after my hair would dry up, you dont feel it no more.

If you're concerned about using a razor you may want to look at some female pH balanced aftershave products or moisturizers to apply after you shave.

I buzzed it the next day and have never looked back.  It's convenient as fk, also allows you to be like ""You don't like it? Damn you're a shallow piece of crap?"" (of course in your mind) and girls see it as a bold move.   Just stick the idea in your back pocket, and one day, perhaps the idea will make sense. Until then, best of luck.

I was that far back that early and a close cut ceasar style is a very good look.  I rocked that until the front lost enough that I just keep everything buzzed down now.  I'm from a long line of men that have all lost a lot very early- the major lesson is that the more you recede, the shorter you should keep the hair.  Depending on your preferred image and style, you could go for a widow's peak or a mohawk while you still have a good, thick strip in the middle.  Those are both real statements, though, so you'd have to ooze confidence in the style to pull it off.  Unless you wear checkered vans and listen to NOFX, it might not be for you."

malegrooming,354sua,JoeKerr95,1 point,Thu May 7 02:42:12 2015 UTC,"I would suggest giving the dollar shave club a try. I use them for my face razors and for $3 a month you get 5 razors shipped to your door. Each razor has 3 blades, and you can also get razors with more blades for a few more bucks a month. They also have a shaving cream that's thick like a lotion and works very well and leaves your face feeling moisturized. That's my 2 cents. I would NOT suggest using nair as I could see it burning and irritating your skin."

Use a pumice stone in the shower every time you take one and that'll hold you over. I started doing this a year ago and it's incredibly rewarding.  I can wear boat shoes in the summer without any stank and I'm not embarrassed when I rock my sandals or flip-flops.

But even then it would be very difficult to do that whilst shaving.  Get a safety razor instead, it's pretty much impossible to seriously hurt yourself, you'll get a few nicks at most and make a bloody mess but over time, you'll get better, maybe you won't even cut yourself. You'll also likely to have less razor burn.  Plus it's very relaxing and you'll have a new hobby if you like collecting soaps, razors and brushes. (Oh god my wallet)"

They are better than a disposable gillette 5 blade, without being as scary as a straight edge which you might be thinking of as a proper razor blade.

Your experience suggests a technique problem, although it sounds like you know what you're doing.  Another point, made by others: Hair does grow.

malegrooming,34ywwy,bandholz,4,Wed May 6 01:59:02 2015 UTC,Ya because people can grow 18 months of hair in a few weeks. Part of the time it takes to grow is why it won't be short lived.

malegrooming,34ywwy,bandholz,2,Wed May 6 13:32:43 2015 UTC,"Well, to me short lived is less than a year. I suppose it's all relative though on what you consider ""short lived"" to be.   I see guys wearing longer hair - whether that's in a bun, down, or in a variety of other iterations. I don't see long hair as a short lived fad. Tying up your long hair is a practical thing to do."
malegrooming,34ywwy,naked_guy_says,1 point,Thu May 7 00:29:14 2015 UTC,Exactly. 18 months for a hairstyle isn't exactly 'timeless'

malegrooming,34xhoc,DionisioGameArt,3,Tue May 5 11:21:53 2015 UTC,"Do it. Especially when you are pale and have dark hair. It saves a lot of time and money in the long run. If you go through with it, the hair won't come back ever!   It's just a bit painful and only for the moment. 2 hours or so after the session you will have a feeling like a sunburn on your skin but that will be gone afterwards.   But please go to a professional place, like a skin clinic or whatever you have in your country and get a thorough consulting session beforehand. That one should be without charge. Oh, and let them do a test if your skin gets along with the laser.   My sessions were 8 weeks apart and I had to go 7 times I think. You shouldn't need to go more than 10 times but I guess it depends on the laser and level it is adjusted to (some skin can take more than other). A female friend goes every 4 weeks but pays less."
malegrooming,34xhoc,MrLeMarv,1 point,Tue May 5 13:23:54 2015 UTC,Seems like you had a great experience!  Which areas did you treat and how much would you say your body hair got reduced?

Yeah, I'm pretty hairy in these areas but not anymore fortunately. Bonus effect was that my upper beard line looks pretty cool now. The woman doing the sessions was very good and experienced at her job.  Regardig hair reduction: It is always the hair that is just growing wich gets destroyed permanently. So I still have very few left wich will I have removed next year or so. But people always tell me they can't notice them. You are always more critical of yourself then everyone else."
malegrooming,34xhoc,NOMMING,2,Tue May 5 17:52:40 2015 UTC,"i had 3 sessions (one session per month) done for my eyebrows and just facial hair in general. i had really fine short hairs on my forehead and above my cheek, and then some hair i'd have to pluck every 2-3 weeks between and outside my eyebrows. all of the hair is pretty much gone now. i still have to pluck my eyebrows to get some of the hairs that were harder to reach, but the rest of it's become either really fine and invisible, or just completely disappeared. it's totally worth it. i didn't really feel any pain, it kinda felt like a bunch of needles poking you really quick, then you smell the scent of burning hair, but that's it. relatively painless, cheap, and really worth it in the long run."

malegrooming,34xhoc,ActionJackson22,1 point,Tue May 5 15:15:45 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, it was at a salon. I may want to go somewhere more legit. Though the experience was great, it was clean, they were nice, I think I should try a different place. What would be a good rate?"
malegrooming,34xhoc,NOMMING,1 point,Tue May 5 15:39:43 2015 UTC,"i'm really not sure, it varies from clinic to clinic. i got mine pretty cheap because they had a groupon promotion at the time so you'll need to just do your research."
malegrooming,34xhoc,MrLeMarv,1 point,Tue May 5 15:51:43 2015 UTC,Success always depends on a few factors. What color is your hair and your skin? In wich intervals were your sessions and did it hurt?
malegrooming,34xhoc,ActionJackson22,1 point,Tue May 5 17:54:17 2015 UTC,"Black hair, middle eastern so a tad bit tanner than white. It did hurt, I did them once a month for 6 months. They told me to never pluck the hairs in between sessions, only shave. They would grown back a lot more slowly that's for sure, but they still came back and now I usually shave every 2-3 days."
malegrooming,34xhoc,MrLeMarv,1 point,Tue May 5 18:12:05 2015 UTC,Then maybe you should really check out some other place. But they told me that skin type can be crucial for laser hair removal. So it probably takes a few sessions more.

Obviously you will need some product there to get it like the picture.  But the overall style would suit your hair type and your face too.  Don't forget one thing about the cowlick though.  When it starts growing back in it will stick right out depending on how bad a cowlick it is.  So once you cut it really short you are kind of stuck with that style.  When you decide to grow it out, the cowlick will give you some problems until it gets long enough to weigh itself down."

You'll always have to wait a few days for stubble to appear.  There are trimmers designed for stubble or have a stubble setting. I made a review a few months ago.  The best one hands down is the Conair i-Stubble, or Babyliss for Men if you are from Europe.  The best thing about it is the way it performs at low settings. Other beard trimmers might not leave your stubble ""even"" like the I-stubble. It just tracks your face so well.   I was using it last year when I rocked the stubble. Now I have a beard.  It's max length setting is 5 mm and it goes for about $40 on Amazon. Believe me you won't be disappointed."

I believe one should use beard oil to moisturize the skin on the face as it is different, more gentle skin than on the head. And the beard oils very rarely use any weird ingredients, its mostly all natural stuff. Also, depending on which one you would buy, I think they smell great (the ones I have tried atleast).   Hope you get your answer, have a great day! :)"

malegrooming,34htd4,Earlhenlily,2,Fri May 1 11:56:45 2015 UTC,"I think beard oil is a must for any beard of a decent length. Obviously shampoo and conditioner are going to be the big things to use, but beard oil and a brush considerably help. There are many different kinds of beard oil. I make my own out of almond oil, jojoba oil, and a couple of essential oils for scents, but that's it. It helps my beard go from feeling like steel wool (even after conditioning) to fine silk. Just remember,  a little goes a long way."
malegrooming,34htd4,AttilaTheHungover,1 point,Fri May 1 15:29:13 2015 UTC,Could you elaborate n mixing your own beard oil? I always wanted to try that.
malegrooming,34htd4,Riesenotter,2,Fri May 1 20:30:29 2015 UTC,"So basically I just looked around online and read about the different effects oils had on hair and skin and ended up ordering big bottles of each on amazon along with essential oils that I thought would smell good. I use a couple drops of tea tree and orange for summer because it gives you something light for the warm weather. In the winter I do peppermint and sometimes cinnamon. Basically I just got a pack of small brown 1 ounce bottles and I just do equal parts of the base oils, like the almond and jojoba (some people call them carrier oils I think). Then add a few drops of each essential oils. You have to use them sparingly because an excess of essential oils can cause irritation. A few drops is more than enough though. Just mix them in the bottle and shake to get them combined.   http://www.artofmanliness.com/2014/09/09/diy-beard-oil/   AoM had a pretty decent article on mixing them yourself. That's where I decided to start and I just went from there."

Had a beard for a few years now and since I started using these two products I haven't looked back!"
malegrooming,34htd4,Original_Hobro,1 point,Fri May 1 22:18:04 2015 UTC,Well as a purveyor of beard oils I must highly endorse their use.  As a beard competitor and a yeardist it's been instrumental in keeping my beard in check as well as my skin. Besides my lady loves smelling the stuff.   A good beard oil will have antimicrobial properties on top of its moisturizing properties.  As a shameless plug and example I'll direct you to my site: http://Beardsmanship.net.  I have a reddit discount (coupon code: reddit5) as well if you were so inclined to purchase from me.  If not there are many fine beard oils out there.   Good luck and keep bearding on.

At the top is a good shampoo and conditioner, then a boar bristle brush, and then an oil or something. I like using an oil or stay in conditioner, because it keeps my beard from becoming very frizzy, and also allows me to shape it a little. It also makes it a bit softer which can be nice for a certain other someone if you are lucky."

After I remove the ice pack, I use a Deep Pore Cleanser Lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub.  Then I apply an herb mint facial mask which I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an aftershave lotion with little or alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out, and makes you look older.  Then moisturiser, then an anti-ageing eye balm, followed by a final moisturising protective lotion."

malegrooming,34el36,ana_bortion,2,Thu Apr 30 23:55:00 2015 UTC,"Very well then.  It's still a work in progress, but I'll describe my current skincare routine.  PM routine:   oil cleanse with mineral oil: This is to remove sunscreen and also to prevent my skin being too stripped by my foaming cleanser Hada Labo Gokujyun Foaming Wash: This is a very gentle foaming cleanser, gentler than any American one I've found (Aveeno Ultra-Calming comes close though.)  This removes any leftover oil from the previous step.  I don't use it on my forehead, which is prone to dehydration. Pocketderm prescription: This is a dermatologist prescription that's tretinoin, azelaic acid, and clindamycin.  Helps tons with acne. Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion: Despite the name, this is a watery toner.  It has hyaluronic acid and other great humectants which provide hydration to skin. Sebamed Gel Moisturizer: This is a underwhelming moisturizer that I'm using as an additional layer of hydration until I run out of it since otherwise it would go to waste.  Will not repurchase, will not be a fixture in my routine for long. Oilatum Natural Repair Face Cream: This is the only non-gel moisturizer I've tried that doesn't break me out (gel moisturizers don't provide nearly enough moisture for me.)  I love it and will use it forever. Vaseline: I use this over the top of everything to lock in moisture.   AM routine is just the Oilatum Cream and sunscreen (Mentholatum UV Aqua Moisture Milk SPF 50+ PA+++); I should use the Hada Labo Lotion too but I'm always running late.  I also just started washing my face with Sebamed Anti-Dandruff shampoo twice a week, as a less drying alternative to the Noble soap that my derm told me to wash my face with.  I plan on adding more to my routine (and removing the Sebamed gel); we'll see how long it gets eventually."

malegrooming,34fzp5,Crushinated,4,Thu Apr 30 21:33:28 2015 UTC,Noted. What happens if doing so doesn't get me as close of a shave (or I find myself with more stragglers)?

Are you using shaving cream?   Second think I will say is pick a razor,  manual or electric don't use both if your face is sensitive. Your face doesn't know what is going on so the hairs haven't been trained on how to grow yet.   As a black man who has gotten my fair share of ingrown hairs..  I have tried everything to get my face very smooth."

After that, I'll wet my sideburns/upper lip, lather up a bit of soap, and use the manual razor to get a cleaner and more accurate cut.  3) Mixing the two types of blades hasn't been a problem since I use the electric razor for most of my face. There has been no redness or discomfort around my sideburns or upper lip.  4) I have never gotten an ingrown hair before."
malegrooming,34fzp5,WhiskeyDigital,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:50:22 2015 UTC,Okay try this.. in the shower try using a face wash prior to cleaning myself then shave right before getting out.   I use Dove Men's care sensitive. Every once in a while I use Nivea face wash but that may be to harsh on your skin.  Then try using a sensitive shaving gel while in the shower the steam will raise those short hairs better.   After first shave then lather up that gel one more time and shave.   Mind you this is all inside a shower.  This may help you get the closeness you are looking for.

malegrooming,348sa5,Vamx,3,Wed Apr 29 05:03:27 2015 UTC,"To paraphrase an episode of venture bros ""no beard is a substitute for a jawline"".  My advise is to get shot of everything below your jawline and to trim the rest down to a manageable amount.   Hair wise, like what's been suggested otherwise an undercut could be good.   Or to be fair the ol' short back and sides would do the trick (a number 2, well start off at a 3 and see how it looks etc). The length on top looks fine, I'd try and keep it looking like you have in picture (I'll edit this and say what one after). Basically the one where you've got a little bit of a fry hair horn, it looks surfer/shabby chic.   Edit: pictures 2/3 I mean my nigga."

Because the taper is all messed up and the fade is uneven it will be hard to correct maintaining your current length. If it were me I would go for a dramatic line right around your natural part on both sides. This will allow you to floof your hair up and back or wear it dramatically to the side. It becomes a style while you grow the sides back in at an even rate. Its easy to do yourself and honestly If you screw up your hair worse, your going to have to take it down further anyway."

The stuff she gave me I could see working for bare skin, but not for the scalp.  There was a period of time where I was paying a little extra for my haircut as opposed to going to the most cost effective place. The psoriasis was not always an issue, so when I was going to the other place, I didn't really have to bring it up.  I brought it up to the place I've gotten my haircut at the last 2 times. The first lady I talked to was extremely unhelpful. She basically just told me tea tree will dry out my scalp, but didn't give me any additional advice. The last lady basically told me the opposite and that tea tree would be fine. It definitely isn't.  I am due for a haircut, so I think I'm going to pay a little extra and talk through my scalp issue with a new stylist. I'll continue to look until I find one I can trust."

malegrooming,343u7k,kebabmybob,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:12:26 2015 UTC,I tend to have this look most of the time. Shampoo less frequently but still wash your hair when showering. It'll help to keep some of the natural oils. The first couple of weeks your hair will be almost too greasy but after that your body will adjust and produce less of the natural oils. At that point if you're not getting the look you want just use some oil based pomades or rub a few drops of jojoba oil between your palms and comb it into your hair.

I can tell these are fine products that will get your hair the way you want it, but as Brylcreem is oil based, you will need to wash your hair after wearing it. Also, all of them smell pretty manly. Water based products are easier to rinse and wash, but Brylcreem has that nostalgic feeling to it because that was the product people wore in the 50's and 60's. It is really up to you."

That's where I've learned pretty much everything I have incorporated into my current regimen. Like the other guys have said, it starts with protecting your skin from the Sun, making sure you and your skin are hydrated, and having a productive cleaning regimen. As an example, you know those scrubby face-washes with the tiny little beads in them? Don't use those. They're really hard on your skin. Exfoliation is good, but you're better off using a chemical exfoliant (e.g. something containing an Alpha Hydroxy Acid) that encourages your skin to slough off dead skin cells and to produce new ones, instead of roughly scraping your skin, which can damage it."

JB is a lot more expensive but I took the plunge because the Neutrogena was still a little greasy on me. I think Dove makes a similar product for men. The shitty part about learning to take care of your skin is that everybody is different, so you have to do some trial and error to figure out what works best for you. It's well worth the effort and money, in my opinion.  Edit: triple protect, not triple threat."

malegrooming,342roz,timwatt,10,Tue Apr 28 23:24:28 2015 UTC,"Drinks tons of water, avoid sugary food and drinks, use a cleanser regularly, wear an SPF moisturizer everyday, moisturize at night, wear higher SPF sunscreen on weekends, and apply all this stuff properly (i.e. gently, don't tug or pull at your skin).

malegrooming,342roz,crackercrumb,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:52:32 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to the sugary drinks bit, but the sunscreen and hydration/moisturizer parts are absolutely true. Here is a video that shows the way that the Sun damages fair skin over time. You'll notice that children have little to no damage due to the lack of exposure over time, and that people with dark skin have very little damage due to having a naturally protective amount of pigment. The whole ""black don't crack"" stereotype sounds racist, but it's accurate insofar as people with dark skin are less susceptible to Sun damage, which is implicated as a major cause of wrinkles and other superficial signs of age. I personally don't slather myself in sunscreen every day, but I do use a facial moisturizer each morning that contains SPF, and if I know I'm going to spend a lot of time in the Sun, I'll try to be pretty diligent about sunscreen. I also don't seek out getting tan anymore like I did as a young buck."

malegrooming,342roz,sruckus,1 point,Tue Apr 28 12:39:27 2015 UTC,"Just put it on your face only. Better yet, use a facial moisturizer with SPF in it. It takes basically a drop the size of a pea to cover your whole face. Actually, not even a pea. More like a lentil.  Edit: also, shop around for products that say ""non-greasy moisturizer with SPF."" You may have to try a couple different ones before you land on one that works for you. Neutrogena makes a couple for men that I'd recommend as a good starting point. They have SPF 20 or 30 and are cheap (~$7) and are available at grocery stores and cvs, etc. The tubes look small but since you use so little every day they last a while. Try one of those out for a while, and if you still feel greasy, try another one."

malegrooming,341orp,sherbert_fountain,5,Mon Apr 27 16:42:11 2015 UTC,"I know I have seen complete kits that I liked quite a bit before, but I can't seem to find them now. I will list what I think should be in the kit in order of importance for me.   Beard oil/conditioner - The most important item. This will make everything more enjoyable for everyone. Conditioning the beard and skin will make the initial grow in period for him more comfortable by minimizing the amount of itch and potential dryness as his face adjusts to this. It should also make it much softer especially once it's grown out, so that you find it more comfortable. You might even start to like how it feels if it's taken care of properly.  Additionally you can these items in all sorts of pleasing scents. I tend to try and compliment my cologne or natural scent using these, but you guys might enjoy experimenting. I would recommend an oil over conditioner especially while it's short. Look for one that contains argon oil and vitamin E. Argon oil and vit E are good for the skin as well as the beard, which is why I suggest it while the hair is short.  Boar bristle brush - This will obviously help groom the beard. I find the brush to be much better at shaping the beard and spreading the oil/conditioner through it than a traditional comb. You want to make sure to stick with boars hair rather than another animals or synthetic fiber. Other fibers don't tend to hold up to the oils as well. Beard wash - Fairly self explanatory. You generally don't want to use the same shampoo or conditioner on your head hair and beard hair. I do use the same stuff, but it's a fairly special kind of product.   That's about it for the required stuff. You may also consider a more traditional beard comb and mustache comb. A pair of styling scissors would also be a good idea once it starts getting longer. I still go and have someone do major work on my beard, but they are nice for taking care of stray hairs.  I am looking quickly for different kit's available.   If money is not a concern. It looks like it's still technically missing the beard wash.  This kit is just about perfect for a fairly reasonable price  Fairly inexpensive starter kit"

The guide on the razor has some blunt spikes with an angle to them that will help lift some hairs up into the cutter, but if the hair is just flat stuck to the skin, it's not going to get cut until it isn't.   I have the Norelco razor as well, and my chief complaint is the guide on it is completely retarded in that respect, it doesn't have any angle on the front so basically it can't lift anything and will just push hair out of the way. If you can find zoomed pics of the razor heads you'll get what I'm saying, the iStubble is like the pointed teeth of a comb that guides the hair in and the Norelco is like the edge of a comb rather than the teeth.  I shave my head also, and ended up making the iStubble my only grooming tool (aside from a DE safety razor for places I want smooth.)  Missed hairs are super noticable and there really aren't many except for places where the contact to the razor is bad (e.g. right by the ears.)"

I tried what you did for a while and just gave it a good scrub with my hands in the shower, but my hair held onto too much oil and left it unkept looking. I eventually started using just conditioner ever couple of days and it its great. My hair doesn't dry out and leaves it with a nice shine. if you end up getting greasy hair, try conditioning it every couple of days. It has enough soap in it to clean it without depriving your hair of all the good oils you produce."

malegrooming,33p425,rattamahatta,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:29:21 2015 UTC,"You don't pluck the top of your eyebrows because they are the most visible. When the hair grows back, it's not likely to grow like the rest of your eyebrows because it's not being pushed down and guided by a top layer of hair. In addition, any changes are immediately noticeable and your margin of error is incredibly high, considering that you're a man and obviously plucked eyebrows are considered feminine.  That being said, rules are meant to be broken. As long as you have a specific plan in mind and are prepared to deal with the possible fuck up, nothing is holding you back from experimenting."
malegrooming,33mxwu,bmweaver92,3,Thu Apr 23 20:47:58 2015 UTC,The best defense against this type of after effect from shaving is to concentrate more on your technique while shaving. Make sure you aren't pressing down too hard and make sure you don't shave against the grain of your hair growth. Brush and proper lather can also help create a much more ideal environment for your skin when hair is being shaved off of it. The goop in a can is filled with chemicals that can dry out your skin and make you more prone to ingrown hairs and such. Jump on over to r/wet_shavers and take a look around.

malegrooming,33mxwu,SoCaFroal,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:56:14 2015 UTC,Sounds like a technique issue more than anything else. Have you checked your grain pattern? On the first pass are you going with the grain under your chin? My grain changes directions so shaving the same direction for the entire face would cause irritation since you could be going from with the grain to across or against rather quickly.  That's what I would do.

malegrooming,33mxwu,woofie11,1 point,Fri Apr 24 06:23:10 2015 UTC,"Here's what I do and it has completely changed my life as someone who has to shave for their job.   Go to Amazon and buy a shower mirror. It'll come with an adhesive hook and a little, almost weightless mirror for around $10. The mirror does fog up, but once you run warm water over it, it will remain fogless for up to a couple of minutes before you need to redo it. I usually only need to do this once when I shave.   Okay, so now whenever you need a shave, do your thing in the shower and as you're showering up, periodically splash warm water on your face. Then when you need to shave before you get out you can turn up the warm water a bit if you like to get a little more steam going.   I hardly get any irritation anymore since I switched to this process and I have a super dense, thick beard. It's super easy, convenient and why not kill two birds with one stone while you're in the shower anyways? One other thing I'll say is definitely use a good lather and get of using traditional shaving cream. I currently use a little dab of dollarshaveclubs shave butter and that does the trick for me.  Other things I do to help fight off skin irritation are making sure I have a clean blade and rinsing it off with warm water ever stroke or two I take on my face. And of course, always shave with the grain. Never shave against the direction your hair grows."

malegrooming,33nabo,Vtheov,1 point,Fri Apr 24 11:57:06 2015 UTC,"Well it looks like you are capable of growing a decent beard, which makes it look a ton better than most guys that rock some shitty patchy facial hair.  Go to a salon, a good one, prepare to spend some money on this. Let them take a look at your hair and determine what to do with it. They are pro's, this is their job.   I would suggest going for a shorter hairstyle. Long hair doesnt really suit you. I would go with a clippered side, maybe a #3 or #4. Then a little longer on top. Get some styling fibre, use it.  Second, buy a beard trimmer, keep it in check, your beard in the first photo is out on control. Maybe keep it between 15-20mm long. Then blend it in with your side burns.  If you have a decent jaw line then shave it. It makes the beard look much more professional."

If your beard cannot progress beyond a state of ""I just started growing it 3 days ago"" then it has to go. Shave it off, get a haircut+style, and you'll be fine. You won't look 12 without it.  If you're worried about ingrown hairs then /r/wicked_edge is indeed a must. They'll probably tell you to burn the electric and start wetshaving. They're not wrong.  If you've never done it before then start with a basic cartridge razor+shaving soap (not canned goo). If you still have problems then you should probably move onto old-school DE razors."

I you want to shoot for a beard, keep growing. If not either leave it as stubble or shave it. There isn't much ""trimming"" to do as it's stubble.  It will be irritating for a while until it gets a certain length and or you get used to it."
malegrooming,33h6ie,Dieselit,2,Wed Apr 22 16:30:10 2015 UTC,"If you plan to continue growing it, buy some beard balm / beard oil to reduce irritation. That will keep it from being itchy and developing red spots. When it becomes longer and more beardy, you may also want to shampoo (once a week or so) and condition (daily).  As for wanting to rub your facial hair, it happens to everyone when you're growing a beard. If you must stroke your chin, do it downwards, to keep the hair growing in the same direction. Once you have longer hair growing, you might want to invest in a wide-toothed comb for this purpose.  You have a good facial hair pattern. I would say give it a shot, if work permits. Every man who is able should try to grow one at some point -- that's how you learn all the nuances of facial hair care."

malegrooming,33cd9u,blackmamba1234,4,Tue Apr 21 11:25:05 2015 UTC,"You have a great head of hair. You can certainly pull off the undercut -- just don't expect it to look identical. You may have to style it a bit differently. There are plenty of good shots of wavy undercuts out there that look excellent. My favorite thing about the undercut is that it can be very harsh and exaggerated (disconnected), or you can keep it subtle. It squares up the sides, accents your cheekbones and jaw. A very versatile cut.   I would start with uniform sides (a 2.5 or 3 guard) for the cut. Decide whether you like it and want to go a little more bold, and maybe try the fade at that point. The fade looks pretty great in combination with stubble or a beard. The sideburns might have to go when you get the sides trimmed down. Depends on how low and thick yours grow. Stylistically, you could do with or without. Either would look fine on your face.   I would also note that the hair on the top of your head is not long enough yet to pull off the artsy undercuts that you will see on Pinterest and Google Images. But I think the shorter, squared sides will do a world of good for your silhouette."
malegrooming,33cd9u,treycook,2,Tue Apr 21 17:08:01 2015 UTC,I think the hair on top is actually pretty cool. I've seen some wavy undercuts that worked well. Grow it a little longer on top and put a product in that will make it shine.

malegrooming,3311fj,thestinkbomb,2,Sat Apr 18 21:30:12 2015 UTC,Thanks everyone for all the comments! I'm honestly surprised that the reaction has been more positive than negative - I guess it's different when you see someone you don't know with a certain look as opposed to me seeing myself with a beard and then with this. I'm going to keep it for a while and see how much my friends abuse me. Also I think the comment about attitude is right - confidence helps a lot with wearing a new look - this thread has helped a lot with that.

malegrooming,32xqra,Diarmuid_MD,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:37:11 2015 UTC,I have noticed my beard has grown in places where it didn't before in just the span of over a few months. It might not make a difference but it's worth a try. My beard has improved a considerable amount in the last two years alone.
malegrooming,32xqra,wl6202a,2,Sat Apr 18 01:20:06 2015 UTC,"Try making or buying some oil first, and then move onto balms if you need more control.  I have a very thick, somewhat wiry beard.  I used oil for the first 3 months or so of growth and for the last few days have been using balm.  The balm gives me much better control and keeps my beard in shape a bit more, but it's heavier and is more noticeable throughout the day.  The nice thing about making the oil is that while there's a big up front investment (like 40 bucks for everything you'll need) you can use the same stuff plus a bit of shea butter and beeswax to make your balm, and those are very cheap."

malegrooming,32xqra,warfrogs,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:01:48 2015 UTC,"My beard grows in this directional pattern on my neck. I keep my cheeks, chin, mustache and jaw trimmed at the longest possible even length, and trim from my neck up to my jawline short enough so that it doesn't grow out. You don't really lose any length as your actual facial hair grows down over it, just gives a much tidier appearance.  Sadly right now, you don't seem to have the cheek coverage to do this. A good balm can help tame your beard but you need to have something to work with on your cheeks or else you'll just have a sleek neckbeard. I recommend keeping it short and tidy until your cheeks start filling in. Once it does you can start doing what I do and slowly start increasing your guard length on your cheeks as they develop."
malegrooming,32xqra,MCbrodie,1 point,Fri Apr 17 16:53:55 2015 UTC,"Probably could use a trim but mine is also curly and nappy, I use oil right out of the shower then blow dry with a brush to straighten it out.

malegrooming,32rkzv,useruseruser45,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:34:03 2015 UTC,"I never used a comb, ever in my life.  Brushes are a different story. Plastic combs are actually quite jagged and can damage your hair (as does combing wet hair to a higher degree).   Using hands only is fine, you may think about trying something like a boarhair brush. That will most likely help with your dry scalp problem as well. Boarhair brushes stimulate oil production in your hair which combats flaking and makes your hair and scalp healthier in general.   Another note, try washing your hair less if your scalp is dry. Rinse it thoroughly or condition it as needed, but avoid washing more than 1-2 times a week and see if it helps your dryness."

Moving to a Mach 3 would multiply that cost incredibly, and that's not cost effective for a process I'm expected to do for work).  The cost of safety razor blades allows me to shave twice with a blade and chuck it -- I'd go weeks on a Mach 3 -- so I always have something sharp for a fast shave.

Most trimmers will come with oil, if not go on Amazon or any beauty supply place and spend a dollar or two on some oil. The reason for oiling is just like your car. It is metal on metal and the oil keeps the blades sharp. If you don't oil that is when your blade will become dull and pull the hair or knick you. THAT my friends is what true pain is."

malegrooming,32jhku,cheerfulhappy,1 point,Tue Apr 14 08:29:52 2015 UTC,"Deodorant or antiperspirant? When I was younger I didn't know there was a difference.   A deodorant is basically just a perfume, most Lynx cans are just deodorants. Antiperspirants usually contain aluminium to block the pores, and actually stop you sweating.  Assuming you've already been using an antiperspirant, I believe Mitchum roll-on is the strongest normal antiperspirant, but you might need Odaban.  With Odaban, you wash your armpits the night before, then spray the Odaban on. Go to sleep straight away. About 30 minutes after applying Odaban your armpits will sting. Hopefully you're asleep by now, or you've got a couple of hours of discomfort coming up.   Feels like it chemically burns the pores closed. Once you've used it a few times you can reduce usage, down to just once a week.  I believe there are similar antiperspirants that you apply the night before, they probably all work the same way, but Odaban is the only one I've used."

One week I stopped using antiperspirant, because all I had access to was a stick of deodorant. After a week of using ONLY deodorant, I noticed I started sweating LESS. Since then my over-sweating problem is gone, and I haven't touched antiperspirant. I know this is not very scientific, but I would suggest giving it a try for a week."

I've seen web sites that say the moon landings were faked, too. Just because you see it on a website doesn't make it true.  Look up ""male Brazilian waxing."" That's taking all the hair off the pubic area, to include the shaft and the sack (and trust me, the sack is a lot more...sensitive than the shaft is).   What's hard wax?   There are two types of wax, hard and soft. Soft wax is what you would traditionally think of when you think of body waxing. It's best suited for waxing larger areas. It is applied warm, with a spatula/stick, and removed using a strip of cloth. Hard wax is thicker in consistency and is also applied warm with a spatula. But the wax hardens and is removed without the use of a strip (you pry up an end of it and yank it). Hard wax is what most knowledgeable techs use for sensitive areas (such as pubic areas). Hard wax attaches itself only to the hair, not the skin, which reduces irritation and pain when it's pulled off."

Choose something for your face type: acne prone, oily, etc. If it's just sensitive you probably won't need more than a mild soap. I've even heard of people just using water and it working great.   Next in line, Gillette has a nice little cheap beard trimmer for like $10 with three settings. It's all you need. As far as shaving lotion get something like Nivea and also an after shave will help with cuts and razor burn. As far as an actual razor, the cheapest and most effective shave comes from a safety razor. But it will be harder than a typical razor.   All in all, go a store and look at the ingredients.

Depending on what I am trying to do with it, I do one of two things to reign it in and give it some texture.   The first involves this glaze. It goes into your hair damp, not wet. You then comb it in the general direction you want it to end up in and allow to air dry or blow dry. It gives it texture reduces poof and somewhat straightens. Once dry use whatever other product you want.  The other thing I will use is some kind of argon oil. I put it in once my hair is mostly dry 2-4 drops rubbed into my hands first usually does it."
malegrooming,31wkw1,coolhandflukes,0,Thu Apr 9 00:38:48 2015 UTC,"Do you use conditioner? Do you use any post-shower products? How often do you shampoo?  Without knowing anything about your routine, your hair type (thick, wavy, and poofs easily) sounds like you might be a good candidate for no-poo (when you limit or cease shampoo use) or conditioner-only showering.  I'd also recommend combing (not brushing) when it is wet and letting it air-dry. Towel-drying can cause it to puff up, and so can dry brushing.  As for products, you may find that none are necessary if you board the no-poo train, as the oils and sebum coming from your scalp will add weight to your hair.

malegrooming,31wkmx,MoeJan,2,Wed Apr 8 20:08:32 2015 UTC,The person cutting your hair needs to separate your sides with your top by creating the hair line with a comb. Once they establish that they should cut the hair to fit that line. They can also embellish that line with a razor if you really want but sometimes that looks unnatural.
malegrooming,31wkmx,CarterSupplyCo,1 point,Thu Apr 9 01:18:54 2015 UTC,Agreed.  This is a bad haircut for this style.  Either the barber/cosmo doesn't understand how OP wants to style it or they are just not good at cutting hair.

malegrooming,31u3ec,umkthen,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:01:50 2015 UTC,"If you really want to do it, you can probably just nair it all off.  I would assume epilating would really suck."
malegrooming,31u3ec,saient,1 point,Wed Apr 8 23:01:10 2015 UTC,"If your leg hair is thick, epilation with one of those hand held devices isn't the most efficient way to go about it. I would suggest getting it waxed, then epilating what's missed/as maintenance. When I did it, it lasted maybe 1-2 weeks before it started to grow back in I think.  Either way, make sure you exfoliate. As the new hairs grow in, they can get trapped under the skin, and form little squiggles of hair. Sometimes, they get ingrown and infected, sometimes not. Exfoliating with body scrub helps lift the top layer of skin so they can come in. If you get ones on the back of your legs, those are difficult to get out. I used tweezers to gently let them loose from under the skin after a shower.  If you like what you see and get some decent money later on, you could try IPL.  But you're right, gender expression or otherwise, you might change your mind later. So don't do anything permanent. Maybe try Nair first, then waxing/epilation. I don't get ingrown hairs with Nair."
malegrooming,31u3ec,millerforceps,1 point,Fri Apr 10 03:01:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for the response.   Yeah, I think what you are saying as far as efficiency makes sense. My hair is about this at its thickest, just more visible because it's black in color. Also only some on the hair on my legs is that thick, on some parts of my legs I can use an electric razor and it feels smooth just because of the nature of the follicle I guess.   Also there are parts on my thighs that got a lot of ingrowns when I shaved the test patch, will exfoliating help a lot for that? Are ingrowns less common with waxing/epilation? I don't get ingrowns on most of my legs though, so I'm not too worried.   What should I expect as far as waxing it? How are the home-kits? Would nairing/shaving it and then epilating it as it grows back work as well? Would it be less painful to do it daily as it grows back, that way I'm doing only some of the hair each day? What should I expect as far as pain because I know it hurts but watching some of the people do it on Youtube, it actually looks kind of terrifying actually lol.  edit: Also, how long can I expect it to last? Some of the better brands say they will last 2-4 weeks but I suspect that that is untrue.   And I also agree on doing something temporary because I realize I am still and high school and figuring myself out and everything. Will you elaborate on the idea of ""gender expression"" though. I am still trying to decide whether it justifies me wanting to do this. I feel like it does.  Sorry for all of the questions, you don't have to answer all of them :P   Thanks, I really do appreciate the response."

malegrooming,31jjri,Cndymountain,5,Sun Apr 5 21:37:55 2015 UTC,"Lucky for you I'm a curly haired bastard so this is right up my alley.  First of all, if you really want your hair to feel better and become softer and more manageable a good first step is to phase out your shampoo as much as you can. It strips your hair of it's natural oils and generally puts a strain on the hair.  You might have heard of the no poo method where you completely cut out shampoo, but even though shampoo is terrible for my hair (it really fucks it up for the day), every now and then I need to wash out some hair wax. Try to as much as possible stay with conditioner only, but don't be afraid to if need be use shampoo once every 1-2 weeks if the need arises.   But it doesn't end here!   There are also stay in balms and oils that will be extremely helpful in helping your hair keep moisture instead of drying out and becoming frizzy, making your hair more shiny and manageable.   I'm currently using: Schwarzkopf Gliss hair repair conditioner.  Schwarzkopf Gliss hair repair stay in balm (bought in a spray bottle filled with coloured liquid).   Moroccan Oil.  Don't worry about buying products aimed at women, they are usually much better than the ones designed for men.   Hope I helped, good luck!"

malegrooming,31cjoo,G0VERNMENTCHEESE,3,Fri Apr 3 20:16:15 2015 UTC,What was the bar soap? There's true soap and synthetic detergents.  True soap tends to form compounds (soap scum) in hard water.
malegrooming,31cjoo,kindofstephen,2,Fri Apr 3 22:47:06 2015 UTC,"i switched to glycerin soap for my face, it seems nice, is supposed to help with acne and razor bumps.  for my body I get the cheapest shit i can find, because it all works and most of it is way overpriced IMO"
malegrooming,31cjoo,lol9p,3,Sat Apr 4 01:10:13 2015 UTC,"Most likely caused by having hard water.  It tends to leave a film on your skin and shower/sink surfaces.  Dr. Bronners tends to be drying, especially if not diluted."
malegrooming,31cjoo,Toyland_in_Babes,1 point,Sat Apr 4 00:25:33 2015 UTC,"For me it's the nails. They always have this white stuff I can scrape off, right after I use soap."
malegrooming,31cjoo,apocryphalmaster,1 point,Fri Apr 3 21:46:38 2015 UTC,"Some people have commented with not using Dr Bronners every day, but after watering it down and using an in-shower moisturizer my skin is super smooth and I have chicken skin (keratosis pilaris is the medical name). I water it down by putting the whole bottle of soap in a bigger bottle (cleaned out an empty shampoo bottle my girlfriend used) and then mixing that with roughly 30% of the volume of the Dr Bronners bottle using water. I would recommend getting the smallest bottle of dr bronners you can find because mixing it with water will break down the soap. They say mixing with water will give the soap about a four week shelf life, which in my experience is plenty of time to use all the soap.  What's great about dr bronners is you can use it for just about anything. Washing hair, body, clothes, brushing teeth (yes it does taste like soap, but works well), bathing dogs (cat skin will react to the soap I've heard), and many more uses I'm sure."
malegrooming,31cjoo,rackball95,1 point,Sat Apr 4 07:44:03 2015 UTC,Sounds like hard water to me.
malegrooming,31cjoo,The_AV8R,0,Sat Apr 4 17:40:44 2015 UTC,"Because you're using shitty soap?  Also, washing regularly with Bronners is definitely not the best for your skin."
malegrooming,31d0bo,malegroomthrowaway,3,Fri Apr 3 22:27:44 2015 UTC,I find it easy to use a hair trimmer to shorten it and then use hair removal cream. If you get the kind for sensitive skin it doesnt burn your genitals either. (Well it doesnt for me! Others still report some burning).
malegrooming,31d0bo,Gonzyy,2,Fri Apr 3 22:30:23 2015 UTC,Would you recommend an actual razor or an electric one?
malegrooming,31d0bo,Gonzyy,3,Fri Apr 3 22:35:00 2015 UTC,This being said DO TEST THE CREAM ON A SMALL AREA THE DAY BEFORE. If it's gonna burn you want to find out before slapping it on your privates.

malegrooming,319yzp,CarterSupplyCo,3,Fri Apr 3 14:34:31 2015 UTC,I think the hair looks good as is.  The beard might be better if it was more naturally shaped.  But it's fine as it is.  You have interesting facial features.  What is your ancestry?

malegrooming,319zys,zn95,2,Fri Apr 3 04:58:32 2015 UTC,I say to shave it and just keep stubble for awhile. The lack of it fully growing in makes you look younger than you would if you just had stubble.

Right now what I'm doing is either slicking it back with dry remedy conditioner or damage remedy conditioner.   I rotate the days depending on what my hair is like.  It's heavy enough to hold it back for the day with a little hairspray on top of it, plus it keeps me from getting split ends and breakage.  The other (easier) thing I do sometimes is just brush everything back and then use bobby pins to hold it.  I lock that down with hairspray too."

Its obviously not on this level, but it reminds me of it.  You've got a generic face structure (not a bad thing, so please don't take it that way) so just about any shorter haircut would work for you."

malegrooming,30x7ma,Suffistication,1 point,Tue Mar 31 14:07:06 2015 UTC,Came here to say the same thing. Highly recommend Suave Styling Paste but I don't know if they make it anymore. I bought a three pack on Amazon a few months ago for like $12. Now it's on there for $75 so I may in search of a new product as well.

Ones that are over-styled end up looking like something out of a boyband or the hit History Channel TV show Vikings, which look great but may not be too professional. Others are about as professional as possible. Best way we can judge is by visual, if you provide us an image of your style or a similar one we could better assess it."

It comes in a tube now (used to come in a vat like vaseline that made it easier to apply) but you can find it at just about any corner pharmacy or large grocery store with a decent pharma aisle.  You'll need to rub it deep into the beard and be as liberal as you can. It will leave some residue in your beard that will make it look a bit greyish but it wipes off just fine and leaves your beard hair super moisturized (bonus!)

malegrooming,30eect,oatsandgains,3,Thu Mar 26 18:45:08 2015 UTC,I'd probably invest in a trimmer designed for this sort of thing. I've got one that I also use to manage my pubic hair.

malegrooming,305puv,Lhun,14,Tue Mar 24 21:50:33 2015 UTC,"First of all, tan. Brown bald heads can be tough and cool. Pale bald heads look sick.   Get used to razor shaving your head everyday or every other day. Honestly, you're too far gone to worry about other styles or saving anything. Maybe if you'd had a transplant 10 years ago you might still have enough. But sadly, it's practically all gone now. Growing it out will only look desperate.   Also, being bald doesn't have to be a bad thing. Bruce Willis looks hard as fuck and chicks dig that. You can make it look cool. Just make sure you take care of your skin and scalp. You should be using some day and night creams for your face already. Once you start shaving, use those same creams for your head.   It will feel weird at first. But after a few weeks, you'll start to own it and feel comfortable with it. Don't go hiding under caps or hats. It only delays the comfort you will feel when you get used to being bald.   Best of luck."

But I don't want to shave it again, I learnt that ass hair is the most important thing in the entire body and I'm never shaving it again. The hairs are like 30% grown so I don't want to reset that, I want them to become fully grown asap as short hairs are just standing in their position and acting like spikes touching my butt hole and the skin around it.  Isn't there any way to reduce the itching without having to reshave? I tried to stick a plaster to make the hair parallel to the skin & avoid it from touching the skin on the opposite cheek, but it was annoying because the skin is really sensitive there so I removed it  btw it's been a few days and itching isn't gone :'("
malegrooming,2zzyp7,pvtshawn,1 point,Mon Mar 23 15:33:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly, instead of clean shaving just use a buzzer and put it to #1 or #2. It'll keep it clean looking, short enough that it isn't an issue, but long enough that it doesn't itch.  As to the itching, try baby powder or an ass cream maybe?"
malegrooming,2zzyp7,he_didnt_mean,4,Wed Mar 25 19:51:19 2015 UTC,Try sandpaper yo smooth the tips of the hairs out some.
malegrooming,2zzyp7,he_didnt_mean,5,Mon Mar 23 22:08:05 2015 UTC,"I've done this for my crack hair but never on my taint or balls:  Use the nair bikini cream. It's for sensitive areas. This way there's no stubble and when the hairs grows back, it doesn't get super itchy or bothersome.   Quick breakdown:   Clean the area with a baby wipe or something similar.  While standing with your legs a little spread, put some nair on the fingers of your butt-wiping hand and, using very little pressure, act like you're wiping with toilet paper. This way, seems to allow for the best regulation of product. Try not to get much directly on your balloon knot. A little isn't a problem. Wash your hand while practicing your best Zoidberg pose so you don't rub your cheeks together.  I just stay on my elbows and knees on the bathroom floor for 10 minutes while the product does its thing. Play on my phone, read, etc.  Use a hand towel dampened with warm water to wipe away hair and residue. Super light pressure here as the skin will be sensitive and the towel will feel really abrasive. Hop in shower to do a full rinse then dry off and apply gold bond to the now smooth area.   If you want to try expert mode, use the gold bond in a teal container. It'll drop you to your knees the first time you try it but you get used to it. I feel that it works better though. I do this once a month an have been for 5 years. Sweating while being active is weird at first... But wiping your butt is the equivalent of using paper towels on linoleum which is awesome."

I guess I'll have to try this, I thought I'd be able to stand just a few days till the hair grows back normally, but seems like it's gonna take some time. My only problem is that I don't have the guts to go to a pharmacy and ask for nair, moreober I can't be seen at home with that (ofc I haven't explained to my family)"

For example:   But for men it is not so simple: the skin of the testicles is extremely sensitive and using hot wax is not recommended because it can be harmful.    Not recommended by whom? It's not any more dangerous than waxing labia hair on a woman, and they do that all the time. The trick is to get waxed by someone who knows what they're doing and has been trained to do it. You need to find a place that does male intimate waxing as a matter of routine. Typically, that's only in the larger cities, IME.  Fortunately, many cosmetology programs these days are requiring that the students learn how to wax men in addition to women, so it will become more prevalent as time progresses.    Although there are now many salons that cater specifically for men, some professionals will not be willing to wax this area.   Very few of those designed to cater specifically to men won't do pubic waxing. That's a huge part of the reason they exist as separate entities in the first place, really.   I started getting my stuff waxed a couple of years ago and wish I had discovered it sooner."

I recommend serum or oil for dryness. Something like Moroccan oil or any other argan oil based hydrating serum after you shower to lock in moisture!  As for the facial hair, that's personal preference. If you want to rock a mustache, go for it! Keep it tidy and groomed. I personally go for Wahl Peaunut as my go to trimmer recommendation.   If I had to decide for you though, I say shave the moustache and just go for stubble look all over."

malegrooming,2zhn3n,700thrones,1 point,Wed Mar 18 19:53:11 2015 UTC,"A good rasp will do you wonders. You can keep one in the shower or bath and use every-time you shower, or groom. If you are using a grit rasp you can do whilst in the shower or wet feet. IF you use something like a ped-egg or pro-grade metal rasp ( I like to call it the ' cheese grater ' ) you must use this on dry feet only, you can really hurt yourself otherwise. What consistent filing will do is buff away dry, dead, rough, skin of the feet and helps prevents cracked heels.   After filing I like to use a readily absorb-able moisturiser or oil! Coconut oil is brilliant! Try to avoid using vaseline and petroleum jelly type products on your feet! Regular soaks and moisturising will help loads with keeping your cuticles supple, flexible and hydrated! As for your nails, just cutting them down and smoothing the edges with a natural nail file, and buffing your toenails a bit to keep them clean and tidy.   If this sounds like a lot of work - treat yourself and go to have a professional pedicure once a month. Theyre an extremely popular treatment, and not many things feel nicer than a hot tea tree soak, scrub, and foot massage.. Dont feel insecure about the state of your feet. Nail technicians have always seen worse ( My co-worker used to go to residential care homes for the elderly to do nail care.. ) So nothing will ever shock us! Our job is to make your feet feel groomed, clean, and tidy."

I have great hair, facial hair grows in full. I'll be turning 30 in the near future, if that's helpful."
malegrooming,2zhn3n,MakeGreatmistakes,1 point,Wed Mar 18 19:56:13 2015 UTC,"The most important thing to start with is getting a good haircut. Its the structural foundation that will make styling your hair simple. This is a good video with basic guidelines on what type of style you want your hair to have - based on how much effort you want to put in. From there you can kind of decide how to style your beard to match your style and maintenance level! Nails are pretty basic to start. A nail file and decent nail cutters help if you don't have any nail or hand issues. Always keep the corners of nails rounded, and nails should neither be too short that they're painful or too long that they're scratching!"

malegrooming,2zg56s,Sugarbear_Jr,1 point,Wed Mar 18 14:49:05 2015 UTC,"Murray's is amazing.  Plus, I doubt you'll find cheaper.  Three tins + shipping will run you around $14-15."
malegrooming,2zg56s,Bothan_Spy,3,Wed Mar 18 19:58:36 2015 UTC,"When I want to go straight back I start with a Framesi glaze and finish off with Keune matte effect  My hair is pretty wavy, so the glaze helps straighten it a bit and the keune does the final holding. The glaze goes in when the hair is damp. Allow the hair to air dry, or carefully use a blow dryer. Once completely dry, I add the Keune. It's basically a fiber like American Crew, but I have found it has more hold, and lasts longer."
malegrooming,2zg56s,SupriseGinger,1 point,Wed Mar 18 09:16:45 2015 UTC,whats the glaze actually do for you?
malegrooming,2zg56s,madlax18,1 point,Wed Mar 18 15:09:54 2015 UTC,"Slightly straightens the hair. Also adds a certain amount of texture and fine hold. It's hard to describe, but my hair definitely looks better with it.  I have a lot of very fine hair, so when it dries it's naturally very poofy without much texture. Most of the time I use two different products one that gives it texture or volume, and one to actually hold it in place."

malegrooming,2zg56s,erockarmy,1 point,Thu Mar 19 14:08:50 2015 UTC,"I really don't know. I'm guessing not on its own depending on how curly it is. You might just be better off chemically straightening it every couple of hair cuts. I style my hair in a way that incorporates  my waves now, but before when I wanted to style it ruler straight I had it straightened."

malegrooming,2zg56s,PriceZombie,3,Wed Mar 18 09:17:00 2015 UTC,"Don't get gel, or paste, or cream, or whatever other type of gross chemical salon goop people will recommend. What you'll want is some light holding pomade. Either Dax super neat, murrays super light or nu-nile (murrays superior is too strong if you're just looking for a slick back), there's a brand called lockharts that makes some pretty great stuff (again ranging from light hold for slick backs, or strong for some crazy pompadours). Those are some petroleum based products so typically they are pretty oily but they give good hold and great sheen.   Or you can go with water based pomades like Layrite, admiral, railcar fine goods, Boulevard nights, imperial, or suavecito. Water based pomades are a little pricier than their petroleum counterparts, but the added bonus is that they will wash out with just water and don't build up in your hair."
