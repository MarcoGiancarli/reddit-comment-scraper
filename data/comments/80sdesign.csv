There's a mix of various overlays I found on the internet for the scratches / distortion and adding them as distortion maps. As for the colour, I just messed around with the standard brightness/saturation settings.  Surprisingly the easiest thing was getting that off-colour look. All you have to do is duplicate the layer, change the mode to Color, then offset it by a few pixels (dependent on the footage really).  I'm not the best at explaining how things are done, but I hope that helped!"

So little wasted space and inside still wasn't cramped.  They were well designed and safe too.  My mom had this generation Civic and one day had a tow truck change lanes basically on top of her.  It tore up the passenger side something good but she was able to continue on and drive her car home while the tow truck had to call a tow truck.  We  all thought the car was totaled but they fixed it and you couldn't tell anything had ever happened.

Of course illustrations like this one used to be drawn mostly with airbrush. But to get such bright colors and such crisp lines was impossible using physical tools.  And who are we kidding, nowadays only the smallest minority of artists use airbrush for this kind of work. The link is from Tumblr, which even further hints that you can be 99,9% sure it's digital art."

It was a black-n-white vector display that was essentially a giant oscilloscope which featured completely sharp lines since it didn't use pixels.  Color was created by photographing the screen multiple times with filters.  This was how the digitizing sequence in TRON was made, where Flynn is sucked into the Game Grid (other sequences were created with now traditional raster graphics or hand animation designed to look like computer animation).  The first software for this was really just designed to preview movement and blocking for motion control photography, for miniatures and artwork but they discovered that the wireframe imagery had a unique aesthetic that they could also sell to clients looking for something new for ads and film."

As for Shatter, actually I didn't know about it. I don't know much about the punk scene of that time. I actually thought it was some new font made in Illustrator.  Romic and Computer looks like the things of the '70s to me."

Like Chicago, Monaco, and Geneva, which are really recognisable and are used in a lot of 80s cyberpunk works. Not sure if they're available for download anywhere, but there are lots of knockoff/similar fonts around."

80sdesign,33c2jt,PigLipsDeluxe,4,Tue Apr 21 14:35:30 2015 UTC,"You think that's crazy, watch the mockumentary. He was doing Moonlighting at the time so this was sort of a natural spin off. He was a breakout star with a hit TV show  and making an album was de rigueur. The show was a little odd for the times too. They frequently broke the fourth wall and you were never entirely sure if Bruce Willis was just playing himself or not. Performing his favorite R&B songs was probably a fantasy come to life for him and his status at the time meant he probably had a blank check to indulge.   Cocaine was also almost certainly involved.   It was the 80s."
80sdesign,33c2jt,snugglebandit,7,Tue Apr 21 16:25:23 2015 UTC,"He was huge because of Moonlighting, but that was pretty much the only thing of note he had under his belt (other than Bachelor Party), and by the time Bruno came out, Moonlighting's shiny had worn off.  Bruno made him seem kind of desperate, and it was getting hard for people to take him seriously.  That and his wine cooler commercials kept him visible, but in a way that was almost a joke to a lot of people.    Then Die Hard happened.  Without it, he may well have not been able to keep his foothold in the industry, but it showed that he could do action as well as comedy, and In Country showed some heavy-drama ability.  Hudson Hawk was a huge blow, but the Die Hard franchise was doing well, he was staying busy with comedy and action films...    And then Pulp Fiction.  After that, he was pretty much secured work, and Sixth Sense just blew him up as a serious actor.  And now, looking back, 25 years later, everyone who made fun of Bruno back then is like, ""Dang, he really can sing.""  tl;dr: This cover is one of the most 80's things that's ever been 80's."

Nakamichi made a series of home audio equipment under the Dragon name, including this turntable, a cassette deck, receiver, and a couple other items.  When this turntable was introduced, it was THE bleeding edge in vinyl listening tech.  What it had that no other turntable had (except for it's older, more expensive, less popular brother, the TX-1000) was the Absolute Center Search function.  If a disc had a mis-punched hole that was off-center, this turntable could scan the disc, find the Absolute Center, and move the turntable platter over accordingly to make the disc play perfectly.  Check out this video to see it in action.  I've recently come to find out that working examples of this turntable are EXCEEDINGLY rare. I just happen to own one."

I'll watch videos of their work from the '70s and '80s and still get inspired because so much of it is beautiful in a way you just don't see anymore.    The look started in the '70s with their work for Levis and 7-Up in particular, but by the '80s it had started to incorporated some digital elements.  These were still being combined with other elements in an analog way, however.  The CGI elements were photographed frame by frame off of a large Evans & Sutherland vector monitor.  Not only did they have to photo frame by frame they also had to do multiple passes per frame because the vector display was B&W and color was created with gels.  edit: these same folks did the wireframe black hole for the trailer to Disney's The Black Hole, and the portion of TRON that occurs right after Flynn gets digitized, where you're flying over the digital landscape for the first time.  And then a few years later they did the ""Sexy Robot"" commercial for the canned food council during the Super-Bowl that would end up overshadowing the game itself."

When I picture the stereotypical 80's scene it's driving a Countach through Miami at sunset with a beautiful, big-haired, big-breasted woman in the passenger seat.  Maybe I just played too much GTA: Vice City as a kid."

There is a brand new one near me that has decor a bit like this.

80sdesign,2zc3f6,fjw,1 point,Wed Mar 18 00:04:16 2015 UTC,Yup basically Safeway Australia is the same story as Safeway UK. Founded by the U.S. company cut off in the mid 80's and eventually rebranded.

80sdesign,2zc3f6,Flazhes,3,Tue Mar 17 20:23:03 2015 UTC,Yes we do! Safeway operated throughout most of the US from the 1930s up until the late 80s. At that point they began selling most of their stores that weren't on the West Coast. This also included a bunch of international chains which included Safeway UK. The company was actually sold in 1987 and a company called Argyll Foods operated it until selling to Morrisons in 2005. Safeway has actually recently been expanding again including opening international stores in places like Jordan. Right now they're in the process of merging with another chain here in the U.S. although in the future it's quite possible that they could reopen in the UK.  Tl;dr: Yes!

In fact, LEGO had been only 6 months away from declaring bankruptcy before it made the controversial decision to license the Star Wars IP.  It was these two themes more than any other factor that saved the company in the early 2000's from a decade of mismanagement.  As far as original space themes, yes its true that Star Wars has gobbled up most of LEGO's space efforts over the lest 15 years, but its certainly not ""Star Wars everything"".  Just 5 years ago, LEGO reintroduced the Space Police line while a whole new round of sets ( http://brickset.com/sets/subtheme-Space-Police-3 ).  More recently, LEGO introduced the very well received Galaxy Quest line ( http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Space/subtheme-Galaxy-Squad ).  So, the original IPs are still coming out, and some of them very good, but they have to be released much slower so they do not cannibalize sales from the Star Wars line.

And I had all of the first Bionicles, I thought they were pretty cool, although a big departure for Lego, and you rarely could build something different out of them.  My personal caveat with Lego in the 00's was that the designs themselves lost certain kind of aesthetics. I look at some sets of that era and a lot of them have some big plain details which suit only one particular model and theme. Everything felt dumbed down, I hated that big action figures like dinosaurs became part of many sets.   I haven't been into Lego for a long time. Galaxy Quest looks better than a lot of their 2000s stuff, but still has too many large details for my taste. I liked it more when details were small and there weren't so many variations, which were IMO pretty useless and tasteless.  Still, I'd rather buy Lego than any other toy.

People will ""mutate"" with them, becoming legends, or what people want to imagine them to have been.  Finally, it'll become a page in the history book, the real nostalgia will end with the actual people who lived in it, and people will be horrified and disgusted how their ancestors could actually use Nokia 3210.

A set of Hit Stix consists of 2 drum sticks which are tethered to a small amplifier by audio cables.

It is a common misconception that Hit Stix are meant to be hit against another surface.

80sdesign,2ukvbr,erythrocytes64,2,Tue Feb 3 00:26:29 2015 UTC,"This subreddit always makes me wonder what a ""2010's"" or ""early aughts"" subreddit will look like in ~30 years. What iconic design elements will we remember the best? Helvetica as a font (and other minimalist font styling), certainly, and a resurgence of swiss design in general, but I wonder what else.  It's also kind of interesting that the 80's were probably the last generation where you'll see not just an iconic style/color scheme, but artistic method as well. The 80's were all about the airbrushing, but now with computer-based graphic design and art there will likely never be a new style that comes about as a result of the artistic tools maturing or changing. There won't be any particular technique that people can say ""that wasn't possible before now"", at least not until holography comes along a lot further."

Constructive criticism: I think green triangles appear to be floating lower than everything else, because their shadows are closer to them. Maybe make a single shadow layer for all figures? And also I imagine reddish orange instead of red-purple would look better. I recommend this free web tool from Adobe for picking complementary colors."

I did just eyeball the colors which might explain why they look a bit odd, I'll definitely use that color wheel tool in the future. The shadow advice is also useful, I'll do that as well.
