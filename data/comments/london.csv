If I was in charge of Bing Maps, I'd have some of the devs make and host a 'business submission service' which not only puts you on Google Maps, but also Open Street Map, and Bing Maps etc.  Try and make it easier than the GMaps one, try and sell it as a more 'open' and 'fair' system."

london,3e3w0l,greymutt,2,Tue Jul 21 21:22:03 2015 UTC,my theory is cooler climate and more rain means that cows are grass fed in the open and that the milk can be lightly pasteurised compared to European countries where it's far warmer.   It was theorised that tolerance to dairy developed in Europe because in the fertile crescent it was too warm to consume milk as it went off almost immediately and it was only when populations moved to the cooler north that milk lasted long enough for humans to consume it.

london,3e1pzs,debussi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:23:58 2015 UTC,"You're probably talking something like £700 for rent and bills unless you live quite a ways out, which means you'll need a travelcard (and therefore you won't realise much in the way of savings).  You could do it, no doubt, but you wouldn't be happy unless you like living like a hermit.  Working 2 days a week at another job would definitely help out a lot. That would get you to something like £1500 a month. Assuming that £1000 is a student loan from elsewhere and not taxed, you'd pay practically no tax and a tiny amount of NI on your takings from your part-time job, and then you'd have more disposable income than a lot of grown up Londoners!"

Even if you end up renting somewhere for like £500/£600 you end up with at least £10 a day spending money as a budget - it's the kind of budget you get used to studying.

There's no mention on the site of this being a temporary measure to recruit bilingual officers, it simply states that ""from Monday 20th July"" this is the new criteria for applicants. It's going to be interesting to see how this changes the Met, they state that as long as you've lived in the UK for at least 3 of the last 6 years you are eligible to apply, would this measure mean a gradual move towards a mostly immigrant Met? There's far more chance of applicants being bilingual if they've moved to the UK from abroad.

Currently 5% of the Met's officers are minority ethnic. 30% of Londoners are non-white. (I know they're not strictly equivalent measures but the simplest comparison I could easily find). There's clearly a problem with the police not reflecting the people it serves, and this must be a rather blunt way of trying to fix that.  I am curious about them needing German speakers though."

This is irrespective of wherever the tattoo appears on your body.  Tattoos on the face, visible above a collar line or on the hands are not acceptable for any role within the MPS.

london,3dzlu0,HarryBlessKnapp,20,Tue Jul 21 12:50:43 2015 UTC,"They can learn a second language, it's not something you're born with, go and learn one. A friend of mine joined the police a few years ago,before she joined she had to get fit and learn how to drive. She didn't look at the requirements and say 'boohoo, I can't join because I can't run and I can't drive' - she got up at 6 in the morning and went running learnt to drive, and also volunteered on a victim support help-line, in order to get a place.  How on earth can people be seeing this as a negative - they want beter qualified police with more skills,how is that not a good thing?"
london,3dzlu0,nutcase_klaxon,9,Tue Jul 21 07:01:10 2015 UTC,"Getting fit and learning how to drive are what you would expect when joining the police. Learning a second language is not.  A second language would take years to fully learn and months of hard work to even get to a basic standard on top of all the other hoops new recruits have to go through including paying £1000 out of their own pockets for training before being eligible to join. Do you really think that it is proportionate for a job paying £19,000 starting to learn a new language as well?  And in any case it's not about the language, it's about the background of the applicant, the Met want to become more diverse and this is one of the ways they're going to do it it seems."

There is no career in the world that you can say  "" I didn't have to know this 5 years ago, I'm not going to learn it now' And no, it does not take years to learn a second language - no where does it say 'and speak it like a native'. London is a world city, residents and visitors speak lots of languages - it'sd a very good thing to have police speaking more than one language, stop being a silly little englander - learning a language is not a horrible unpleasant impositon.   the Met want to become more diverse   Good - it's at the heart of policing by consent that the force is connected to the community it serves."

london,3dzlu0,PM__ME__PMS,-1,Tue Jul 21 07:24:53 2015 UTC,"Peculiar argument. You're over simplifying this quite a bit.   Getting fit and learning to drive are totally different skills to learning a language. For a great many employers, and the general population, those are base level skills that most people have. Learning a second language is not a base level skill in this country. Getting fit and learning to drive from scratch can take 3-6 months and can be fit around an existing life / career within reason. Learning a language to fluency within the same time-frame around existing commitments would be extremely difficult, if not impossible. To become reasonably adept at a language would probably take, what, a year at least assuming it was your primary extra curricular activity? This is just an extra thing people would now have to do to become a police officer. When there are people in the world who have parents who speak a second language you are severely restricting a huge chunk of Brits who didn't grow up learning a second language."
london,3dzlu0,StephenOfficial,6,Tue Jul 21 12:03:14 2015 UTC,But what if that's what they need specifically right now? Atleast they are open about their requirements.  Maybe they have a shortage of those languages in certain communities where they are having issues/want to engage with the community.
london,3dzlu0,thisistheslowlane,8,Mon Jul 20 22:44:33 2015 UTC,"I think the solution to that is to make sure that the 'communities' have to learn English. This is England after all.  I think it's good that the met are trying to engage with the immigrant communities of London, but effectively excluding natives from joining the police force seems like a step too far."
london,3dzlu0,geek_jock,5,Mon Jul 20 23:24:57 2015 UTC,"Even when immigrants are perfectly fluent in the language of their new home, in times of extreme stress - such as the occasions they might interact with a police officer - it's perfectly natural that they might revert to their mother tongue either without thinking, or because they don't feel they can provide the necessary information in their second language at that time.   London is a multicultural city with many, many languages being spoken. Its police force and other public services should cater to that. Doing so helps immigrants integrate rather than keeping them at arms length."

london,3dzlu0,FaeLLe,6,Tue Jul 21 09:19:41 2015 UTC,"Policing in general? Not at all, I'm not suggesting that. As a disclaimer, I'm hugely pro-EU and pro-Immigration but I still think this is wrong. It's to do with context.  If you've only been in the country for three years before serving I fail to see how you can understand the nuances of our society, which is essential for a role like policing. I understand pragmatism needs to come into it - e.g. recruiting for language ability - but it does not give me confidence. The standards of policing and (perhaps more importantly) the status they have in society differs hugely across the world. That baggage travels!"
london,3dzlu0,Cadwaladr,4,Tue Jul 21 09:26:16 2015 UTC,"There are (at least were) quite a few police blogs of Brits who have gone to America and Canada to be police officers there, having been coppers here. They didn't seem to have a problem doing their job.   Likewise I could imagine a NZ, Aus, CAD, officer fitting into the UK policing quite easily."
london,3dzlu0,dexcel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:22:11 2015 UTC,"So can I, no problems with that at all. Policing as an institution is very similar in all of those places. But not all police are worthy of the name. What of countries where they are little more than protection rackets?"
london,3dzlu0,Cadwaladr,0,Tue Jul 21 11:24:32 2015 UTC,"CAD   Is that Canadian please?  NZ, yes, no probs at all. Aus, maybe a little difference as they are armed all the time, but Canada (if that's what you mean) I'd have to say no - they are so like Americans in policing terms that it's not worth distinguishing sometimes."
london,3dzlu0,collinsl02,2,Tue Jul 21 18:31:03 2015 UTC,"I guess that's the case for those who have already been working with policing in other countries. But what about non-UK nationals living here wanting to start working in the police force? Should they be systematically excluded until/if they apply for citizenship?   There's already a huge problem with communities in this country distrusting the police, so not sure such restrictions would help - in fact isn't the met police force actively trying to 'diversify' its recruitment to combat this?   I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you, but I also think there are many more important factors to take into account rather than nationality - furthermore, being British on paper doesn't necessarily equate to a certain set of ideologies.   There are British people in Buckingham Palace, in ISIS, in Berlin, Brazil, and Thailand. Everyone will have different influences and experiences that he or she would take on with them should they join the police force.   Edit: Just wanted to clarify, I do not think British people joining ISIS should be able to join the police force! I just wanted to highlight how nationality doesn't necessarily represent a unified personality/ideology/experience."
london,3dzlu0,Frank_IV,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:57:22 2015 UTC,"That's a fair summary, and I'd agree. I'm not sure what course of action is best, either. Damned if you do, and damned if you don't. You're right in stating there is a distrust of police in certain communities and this may help alleviate that. But then, won't you have the same element of distrust building from other communities? The idea that I can be policed in Britain by someone who is not British makes me extremely uncomfortable. That might make me sound like a little-Englander, from which I would want to distance myself, but it is the rough equivalence of minority communities that want to be policed by ""their own""."

The dog stood on the stairs with them until they reached the top, at which point one of them just lifted him enough to get him over the end of it so his paws wouldn't be caught up. I imagine if you train your dog properly and stay vigilant while using the escalators you won't have a problem. That said, most stations have either lifts or stairs available."

If you have an assistance dog, at stations where there is no wide automatic gate, you must ask a member of staff to open the manual gate to allow you to enter or leave a station.  16.3 If you bring an animal with you, you must use a staircase or lift where provided. If there is no staircase or lift and you need to use a moving escalator, you must carry your animal unless you have an assistance dog that has been trained to walk on moving escalators.

I decided to get one of these from amazon - the handle is really helpful when I need to whip her up off the floor to run down the escalator, or get her out of trouble (usually eating vomit, or chicken bones). Might not be as convenient for a lab though!  Dogs of any size are allowed on the underground and as other have said, there is usually a static option available. Staff underground are generally helpful for this sort of thing but I have experienced a good share of people who are terrified of dogs - as is the case anywhere I go.  You'll find on tube carriages that people who don't like dogs try to avoid the dog, and those who love dogs will gravitate towards you. Sometimes this is a good thing but not always!"

I find my FM listening being badly interrupted by pirate radio on the way to the supermarket in the car. (I live in Enfield, just north of Haringay).”   I have a suspicion that people use the alternatives because FM broadcasting, commercial-music stations are so unbelievably terrible.  I doubt pirates have much to do with it.    People now have the choice (thanks to the internet, DAB etc) of radio stations that may be filler-free, or just don't repeat the same 15 songs until you can no longer resist the urge to murder.  Pirates are most likely to get shut down if they're overlapping established commercial stations, so ideally, they try and steer clear and keep below the radar."

london,3e25je,greymutt,2,Tue Jul 21 11:36:02 2015 UTC,"Broadcasting to the internet is many times easier and cheaper.  Any old shit broadband will do, we are only talking about 128kbit for your average stream. From there it's distributed by the streaming server which you can pickup from about £5/month.  In comparison running a pirate radio is not that easy. Involves sticking real kit in a transmittible location (like a tower block) and then evading Ofcom are very active in knocking down broadcast locations.  Of course if you can solder a transmitter together for about £20, that's the cheap bit. Putting it in place, powering it and then getting your signal to it is the difficult bit."
london,3e25je,eastlondonmandem,2,Tue Jul 21 13:06:33 2015 UTC,Sounds like that's the appeal in it rather than the relative ease and safety of internet broadcasting.  Being 'off grid' and 'sticking it to the man' and all that.

Rarely will a pirate radio station be built from new gear fresh off the shelves.  I think it'd take more than a bit of broadband anyway.

The cheapest FM tuners will sprog all over the dial and potentially cause interference to other radio frequencies outside the FM Band, and ensure you go right to the top of OFCOM's list for disabling ASAP.  A low wattage tuner can be made for very cheap though if you know who to print a PCB and order some electronic components, or they can be bought relatively cheaply too. Amplifying the output wattage cleanly is what costs, and brings more attention to you."

Not Wrights, the experienced manufacturer of hybrid buses which took the idea from Heatherwick's sketches and actually built it?"
london,3dx0mh,put_on_the_mask,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:05:00 2015 UTC,"Getting airflow and other environmental elements correct in the bus is a design issue, not a manufacturing one. Replacing the aircon units hasn't fixed the fundamental issue.  And of course they didn't design every little component, they designed the holistic interaction of them, and in particular screwed up the top deck in terms of light and airflow.   They didn't just hand over some sketches and say, ""Make us something like this"" ... I hope."
london,3dx0mh,coriny,3,Mon Jul 20 18:18:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's a design issue - a detailed HVAC design issue. Which isn't what a design house like Heatherwick does, just like an architect designing an office building doesn't specify exactly how the plumbing will be put together beyond saying ""the bathrooms are here and this is the layout of the toilets & sinks"". Given those specifications, it's up to the person installing the plumbing to work out how to get mains water where it needs to be. There should be some back and forth if that person feels that a design change is needed to make things work, but fundamentally if the air con or engine on a bus is fucked, it's on the people who designed the physical implementation of those systems, not the people who designed the externals and set the requirements for the specialised technical parts. The only way Heatherwick takes responsibility is if Wrights came to them and said all these things would go wrong, and Heatherwick said ""fuck it, just build it anyway"". Which won't have happened because it's far too great a risk to a business that exists based on its public reputation."
london,3dx0mh,put_on_the_mask,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:41:05 2015 UTC,"OK, I'm not a bus designer, but I do know that airflow is about more than plumbing, it's a complex interplay between the mechanics and the interior shape and seat placing. Architects don't generally design plumbing but they do design air flow (I am confused as to why you didn't use the direct homologous thing they do rather than analogy), and are heavily involved in integrating aircon systems.  But I'm going to take your word that Heatherwick would have just said ""make it look like this"" without any kind of modelling or dev work, and then didn't test the prototypes (probably didn't ask for any right? After all experienced manufacturer and all). And just rolled straight into production, fingers all crossed. Yep. With project oversight skills like that I can see why they've been given the bridge it.  And we know none of it is Heatherwick's fault, because all of Wright's other buses' air conditioning works, um, fine. Even on their other hybrids, which also actually work as hybrids. And have done since 2007. So yep. I totally realise what you're saying now ..."
london,3dx0mh,coriny,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:03:00 2015 UTC,"I didn't think the giant leap from HVAC to plumbing would be particularly confusing, but if you like, substitute aircon for plumbing and cold air for water...the point still stands. Architects do not generally have the expertise to make detailed decisions on how these things work, so they call on those who do.  Also why are you attributing the project oversight & management to Heatherwick now as well? They didn't do that either. Just like they won't do it on the Garden Bridge if it goes ahead."
london,3dx0mh,put_on_the_mask,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:40:02 2015 UTC,"Mate, I've come to the conclusion that you literally have no idea what you're talking about. I don't think either of us know anything about designing buses, and clearly your experience with architects have been different than mine - I'd expect an architect to very much be involved in environmental stuff, like air flow and heat distribution, and they have been, because with those kind of things you can't separate form and function. Plumbing is some bizarre red herring that you seem to have got fixated on.  Now you seem to know a lot about Heatherwick's role in this. Why weren't they given responsibility for testing the prototypes, and who was?"
london,3dx0mh,coriny,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:48:11 2015 UTC,"I used plumbing as an analogy once, that's not a fixation. You're welcome to your conclusion but the architects I work with on a daily basis, a decent portion whom are dealing with sustainable cooling of large buildings, might disagree. There comes a point in every project where they engage specialists for things like cooling systems, be they HVAC manufacturers/subcontractors, experts in passive cooling techniques, or under exceptional circumstances, experts in thermodynamics/fluid flow as applied to large structures (this one formed part of my degree). This comparison is beginning to get misleading though because understanding heat flow around a building is different to providing cool air inside a vehicle - scale makes a huge difference, as does active vs passive cooling. Passive cooling means yes, you do need the form of the building to perform the function. Active cooling with air conditioning is the opposite - form and function can largely be separated as long as the form allows for enough vents and gives enough space to hide ducting & plant. This is why the air con can work just fine on a basic bus or train carriage that is little more than a hollow cuboid with an AC unit bolted on top.  I've no idea whether Heatherwick were present at prototype testing - although I'd assume they were - but their job was not to coordinate the delivery of the bus, and they weren't the customer from whom Wrights needed approval. Wrights were responsible for the delivery of the bus (and even they subcontracted the air con system to Heavac, which might be at the root of the issue) and TfL as customer should have set criteria for testing. It would appear that didn't include testing the air con with a full bus and summer temperatures. My experience of these buses more recently (and the results of the testing TfL claim they've done) has been that the cooling is now fine on routes where previously it was horrible, which would suggest whatever the problem was is fixable without a redesign of the things Heatherwick did."

There is no direct mechanical connection between the engine and the wheels in a series hybrid vehicle such as the Borismaster. If the motors were defective, the bus would simply not move at all.  The battery packs being defective makes more sense - if the packs cannot maintain an acceptable SoC, then the engine would be placed under continuous load, essentially driving the motors directly - which, depending on the duty cycle of the engine, could cause problems (e.g. overheating)."

Naturally, I once found myself going. For a start, there is no way I should have been let in, I had issues getting out of the taxi. No issues with paying in but expecting to be refused service from the bar I was allowed (by myself) to order 3 pints of Guinness, 3 Coronas and 3 Jaeger bombs. I was also offered a tray and assistance to bring it over to my 2 friends. Not sure if that is a positive or a negative. They let this continue for 3 rounds.   The rest of your night however sounds rad as fuck. I'd definitely get lost."
