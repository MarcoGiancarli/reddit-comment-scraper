ACMilan,3e3gqb,NotMilhouse,2,Tue Jul 21 18:21:14 2015 UTC,Likelihood of him getting Coppa Italia experience this season?
ACMilan,3e3gqb,volunteeroranje,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:07:05 2015 UTC,"No idea honestly, I always assumed he'd be used in the midfield or behind the strikers but Miha played him up top in a two striker system.  I think a couple injuries to some forwards could see him make the bench, but I'd be lying if I said I was doing anything other than speculating."
ACMilan,3e3gqb,youngzlatan,4,Tue Jul 21 20:14:49 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have Verdi in the squad over Matri, every time I see that name in a squad list of ours I die inside a little"
ACMilan,3e3gqb,TrueMilanista,4,Tue Jul 21 19:01:56 2015 UTC,"Matri, Zaccardo, Albertazzi, Zapata....  These are all players that should be seeing some good minutes during the preseason. So that we can showcase them to other clubs. If we leave Matri in Milan all summer and have him sulk, his value is only going to depreciate."
ACMilan,3e3gqb,iliketoeatbricks,6,Tue Jul 21 19:49:10 2015 UTC,"Zapata is staying at least for this season because of Bacca. Hopefully Agazzi, Albertazzi, and Zaccardo leave though. I'd be OK with keeping Matri for backup"
ACMilan,3e3gqb,nybreath,3,Tue Jul 21 20:45:59 2015 UTC,"Verdi is practically gone already, Genoa or Carpi"
ACMilan,3e3gqb,IsIndianStereotype,2,Tue Jul 21 21:50:07 2015 UTC,He actually had a decent season at Juve.
ACMilan,3e3gqb,mikob11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:33:31 2015 UTC,He was good with Genoa before he left for Juve in January. At Juve he basically did nothing.
ACMilan,3e24h8,autslash,9,Tue Jul 21 11:02:17 2015 UTC,He is young. He also wont be the immediate answer to our defensive woes if we sign him. He WILL have growing pains like this example. But I am confident he can became a terrific defender.
ACMilan,3e24h8,I_AM_KANG,6,Tue Jul 21 11:26:41 2015 UTC,"The question is if we should pay money equal to an already terrific defender for a player who simply can become one.  Also, we have to assume that he will be considered a starter for that kind of money, not a player that plays some games the first season and then gradually become one. We are spending a lot of money this summer, but not €30M on a bench player with potential.  Don't get me wrong, I don't really care that he made a mistake in a practice match. I just don't like the idea of spending so much money on someone that have so much more to prove, yet even if he rises to become a world class player actually wont be worth that much more money. Thiago Silva was sold for €42M as probably top 5 CBs in the world. If Romagnoli doesn't live up to his potential, something which can absolutely happen, he could not only be a poor buy, but could cost us for example the CL spot this season too (assuming, like I said, that he's not meant to be a €30M bench player)."
ACMilan,3e24h8,MVB3,3,Tue Jul 21 13:00:29 2015 UTC,"You won't get an established CB for 30m€ nowadays, sadly..."
ACMilan,3e24h8,Storzh,2,Wed Jul 22 00:53:19 2015 UTC,I totally agree. The part that interests me the most about him is that he already has experience with Miha so he has an advantage over all the other defenders at Milan who are trying to learn a new system.
ACMilan,3e24h8,lukefed12,4,Tue Jul 21 12:07:19 2015 UTC,"Meh, not a big deal. He's young and not playing with his usual partner of the past year. Seems he thought they were going to track their men back and realized too late the rest of the defense held their line."
ACMilan,3e24h8,volunteeroranje,7,Tue Jul 21 13:01:00 2015 UTC,Hopefully this will just make Roma lower the asking price!
ACMilan,3e24h8,lukefed12,4,Tue Jul 21 11:10:55 2015 UTC,One mistake will hardly make any effect on the price
ACMilan,3e24h8,acm149,2,Tue Jul 21 13:41:19 2015 UTC,Thats what i thought
ACMilan,3e24h8,Zarolio,3,Tue Jul 21 11:11:27 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't have said it was all that big of a mistake, playing with a new defensive partner who wasn't tracking his man. Not to say that this relieves him of blame but its certainly not much of a mistake if you consider it, lack of understanding more than a defensive error."
ACMilan,3e24h8,azisen,-9,Tue Jul 21 13:19:21 2015 UTC,Why post gifs of players we don't own?
ACMilan,3e24h8,Maksim7,8,Tue Jul 21 12:24:40 2015 UTC,Because he's the number player on our wishlist?
ACMilan,3e24h8,azisen,-7,Tue Jul 21 12:42:10 2015 UTC,"True, but he is still not a player for our club so posting gifs of players just because they have been linked to us feels like a quick karma grab."
ACMilan,3e24h8,Stilling8,10,Tue Jul 21 13:31:36 2015 UTC,Hes heavily linked with us and i thought that maybe some people on here would be interested in the gif... Its not like other peoples posts on here get lost because of mine so i think its fine to post it since there arent many new posts a day...
ACMilan,3e24h8,Syklon,7,Tue Jul 21 14:01:56 2015 UTC,"Well we arent just ""linked"" to him, we have made several bids and i for one thought it was an interesting post.  Also who gives a shit about karma"

ACMilan,3dtzi3,Usef22,7,Sun Jul 19 13:18:53 2015 UTC,"He's obviously older, but there's no denying the season he had this year. This guy is class and would improve our team now and in the short future. I'd still rather Romagnoli, hopefully that window doesn't close."
ACMilan,3dtzi3,Placowdepuss,2,Sun Jul 19 13:26:22 2015 UTC,"I remember i wanted to buy him in fifa last year and he was really expensive haha  Great player no doubt, however if were not buying someone young, i would prefer Glik. He is very reliable and already proved himself in serie a, though i dont remember us being connected to him."
ACMilan,3dtzi3,acm149,2,Sun Jul 19 14:24:55 2015 UTC,"He would be a great player to add to the team, but I bet he will cost too much. Zenit probably won't sell him cheap."
ACMilan,3dtzi3,iliketoeatbricks,2,Sun Jul 19 20:25:38 2015 UTC,"Off topic but, the other day I watched the rerun of the champions league 1994 milan v Barcelona, and it got me thinking we should make another attacking dutch duo. Just think about it man, wouldn't that be great."
ACMilan,3dtzi3,scvmbagsteve99,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:31:11 2015 UTC,"There aren't any great dutch attackers available right now. Not Gullit, van Basten level. Plus what top dutch attackers are around that are not a part of big teams already."
ACMilan,3dtzi3,IsIndianStereotype,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:46:03 2015 UTC,Yea I know it was just a thought
ACMilan,3dtzi3,scvmbagsteve99,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:28:57 2015 UTC,"I like him, would be a great addition. But right now I think this is just a ""scare tactic"" to get Romagnoli, who is still the #1 target"
ACMilan,3dtzi3,I_AM_KANG,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:24:24 2015 UTC,Garay had an excellent Copa America ..it'll be interesting to see him in the defense
ACMilan,3dtzi3,geovannyfbh,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:47:37 2015 UTC,"He had a great WC that earned him that big money move to Zenit. No idea how he's done since then but he is a leader type, big strong CB and probably just about good enough on the ball to do OK in Serie A. I would liken him to a right sided Walter Samuel."
ACMilan,3dtzi3,baddada77,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:53:01 2015 UTC,"Just gonna say that Garay is slightly more likely because of the new rules in Russian League football, which basically mean the number of foreign players allowed to play is limited. Not saying it will happen, but Zenit may well consider selling if a bid is put in for an adequate price."
ACMilan,3dtn5d,DiscoPopShop,2,Sun Jul 19 10:02:05 2015 UTC,I did not make this one but I found it and thought it would be good to share since his stock is rising fast.
ACMilan,3dtn5d,Junaid96,2,Sun Jul 19 10:02:40 2015 UTC,"He seems like a pretty balanced and intelligent player overall. His delivery looks very dodgy, but that's the kind of weakness you can easily improve upon. He definitely has a lot of work to do but I could see him making it."
ACMilan,3ds9c6,haopeng,10,Sat Jul 18 23:33:59 2015 UTC,Milan needs a star to carry them the team back to CL. Ibra is the one.
ACMilan,3ds9c6,dcballer,26,Sun Jul 19 03:57:54 2015 UTC,"All you people hating on Ibra right now, it'll be interesting to see your comments about him later this season when he's highest scorer in Serie A and we are at least in 3rd place."
ACMilan,3ds9c6,logari123,27,Sun Jul 19 01:43:42 2015 UTC,Gonna look back at this comment and either laugh or cry.
ACMilan,3ds9c6,ass_in_your_dick,2,Sun Jul 19 03:47:39 2015 UTC,"Haha this made me realize we've been saying ""this season will surely be ____"" for awhile now. Particular that ramp up to the ""pre-season of false hope,"" as I'd like to call it."
ACMilan,3ds9c6,capyoda,9,Sun Jul 19 18:23:41 2015 UTC,"Ibra is one the best players in the world, not many people are questioning that. With that said there are, at least for me, two legitimate concerns regarding this.   Number one is poor planing. Why get Bacca L. Adriano and Ibra for two position while in the meanwhile Honda(!) is most likely to play trequartista. Given, the mercato is not closed but we should prioritise a CAM and CB.  Number two is transfers philosophy. We should be leaving the old method of buying players near their end because it has shown to be bad both economically and in sports-terms.   With all that said I would still love to have Ibra and I'm just as sure he'll score a tone of goals. But there are legitimate concerns regarding this transfers"
ACMilan,3ds9c6,fingrar,3,Sun Jul 19 09:31:56 2015 UTC,"I honestly think Luiz Adriano was a waste, but we will see.   Ibra has experience, leadership and authority; something no one in this team has at a high calibre. He will be a leader for our young ones and always has that never give up attitude, he will be a great addition psychologically as well.  And we can not full rely on the youth to take us back to the top, yes, have and play them in abundance, but we need a couple of players with the experience and intelligence like Ibra to mentor them on and off the pitch.   Gattuso once said when he was younger, he shaved his head in the changing room and left the shavings in the sink. One if the older players (forgot who) slapped him on the head and said ""This is not your house, treat this place with respect"" from there on Gattuso said that he gained his leadership from. (Don't quote me on this last part but it was something like that)."
ACMilan,3ds9c6,logari123,2,Sun Jul 19 10:03:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think Honda is most likely to play trequartista. It will probably be either Bonaventura or Ibra himself while Honda stays on the bench, at least to start with. No way Honda deserves a starting spot ahead of those two based on past performance. Shit I'd prefer Suso to him."
ACMilan,3ds9c6,Junaid96,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:58:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed on how undeserving Honda is. Those two alternative would be playing out of position though which in turn proves the main point. We need a new CAM, how is it going with Witsel?"
ACMilan,3ds9c6,fingrar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:47:18 2015 UTC,Last I read wasn't Chelsea closer with Witsel than we were? I never pinned much hope on Witsel initially anyways.
ACMilan,3ds9c6,capyoda,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:25:13 2015 UTC,"Bonaventura is not out of position at CAM, he played there often for Atalanta. And while Ibra is a striker on the team sheet he plays more like a CAM in practice, I think him behind Bacca and Adriano could probably work (though we'll have to see first whether they're compatible, I personally doubt Bacca and Adriano would be good together).  Witsel is looking more unlikely now but he is a box to box player anyways."
ACMilan,3ds9c6,Junaid96,2,Sun Jul 19 14:06:27 2015 UTC,I heard he has been really poor going forward this season... So id say he is more of a deffensive minded mid
ACMilan,3ds9c6,autslash,3,Sun Jul 19 15:10:47 2015 UTC,tagged
ACMilan,3ds9c6,Jp1496,2,Sun Jul 19 05:40:57 2015 UTC,You could be right but I think this only a short term fix and a waste of money.
ACMilan,3ds9c6,ECW-fan,5,Sun Jul 19 14:22:28 2015 UTC,I didnt believe there was a chance but this would be amazing
ACMilan,3ds9c6,CalcioMilan,5,Sat Jul 18 23:43:00 2015 UTC,"7.5m is a bit higher than I'd like, but if he can deliver then it's totally worth it"
ACMilan,3ds9c6,youngzlatan,8,Sat Jul 18 23:48:29 2015 UTC,Of course he'll deliver!!
ACMilan,3ds9c6,logari123,9,Sun Jul 19 00:09:06 2015 UTC,Pedulla is reporting it. It's happening :)
ACMilan,3ds9c6,Junaid96,3,Sat Jul 18 23:47:21 2015 UTC,"Pedulla has always said that Ibra will join Milan.  But it is going to happen(the only issue being PSG giving Ibra an extension, though it seems more & more an impossible idea now).  But IMO still early, or not until PSG has 2 signed big players.  My guess is for a 3 year contract it's going to be at around 6M per season."
ACMilan,3ds9c6,milano_siamo_noi,3,Sun Jul 19 01:45:17 2015 UTC,"If he joins what's happening to Niang? Loaned out again or will he compete with Ibra, Bacca and Adriano?"
ACMilan,3ds9c6,adamkex,2,Sun Jul 19 01:49:14 2015 UTC,"Why not? when he's given a chance on the field, he'll fight with more determination to secure a spot I.e. Hopefully leading to more goals"
ACMilan,3ds9c6,logari123,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:51:05 2015 UTC,Because we just bought 3 strikers (assuming the Ibra deal is done).
ACMilan,3ds9c6,adamkex,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:11:25 2015 UTC,"But like I said, it should motivate him to put in like 10 times the effort when he's given a chance to secure a spot. And I doubt Luiz Adriano would be picked over him, coz he's a poacher like Bacca and we won't work playing them both.  So it'll probably be like Ibra-Bacca, Bacca-Niang, Niang-Ibra, Ibra/Bacca-Suso/Cerci, LA-Suso/Cerci/Ibra  and so on."
ACMilan,3ds9c6,logari123,3,Sun Jul 19 02:33:36 2015 UTC,I'm just scared that he might not get enough games in order to develop properly. On the other hand he gets to play under Zlatan again
ACMilan,3ds9c6,adamkex,3,Sun Jul 19 08:00:59 2015 UTC,He never played with Zlatan. He arrived the season everyone left... So it's gonna be interesting.
ACMilan,3ds9c6,logari123,2,Sun Jul 19 08:12:24 2015 UTC,Oh shit. I thought we have had him for longer.
ACMilan,3ds9c6,adamkex,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:28:32 2015 UTC,There's rumours that he could return to Genoa on loan.
ACMilan,3ds9c6,Junaid96,4,Sun Jul 19 02:01:53 2015 UTC,His agent ahs already said no to that.
ACMilan,3ds9c6,InJailYouMyHo,3,Sun Jul 19 02:18:08 2015 UTC,"In my humble opinion, there is always a place for Ibra in any team. He is one of the best players in the world still. He has delivered every year since he started his professional career."
ACMilan,3ds9c6,kittenhormones,2,Sun Jul 19 15:50:17 2015 UTC,"I welcome Ibra, but we have way too many strikers, we need midfielders asap."
ACMilan,3ds9c6,encoreAC,3,Sun Jul 19 12:44:33 2015 UTC,"IMO, a big waste of money. It's taking a step back. Our problem was always buying older players, and that salary is huge for someone who will be 34 in October."
ACMilan,3ds9c6,snatchmastaflex,9,Sat Jul 18 23:59:09 2015 UTC,"step back lmfao, a world class striker is possibly joining and you think it's a step back"
ACMilan,3ds9c6,Piscinin,3,Sun Jul 19 00:05:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he is a world class striker. One who's 33 years old. One who suffered all season long with a nagging heel injury. Paying €7.5 a year for all that, to me, is a waste of money.   Besides, at PSG, he has a quality midfield that can actually get the ball to him so he can score all the goals he does. Milans midfield is mediocre at its best, and until we sign a quality defender and quality midfielder, he shouldn't be a thought in our minds."
ACMilan,3ds9c6,snatchmastaflex,11,Sun Jul 19 00:49:15 2015 UTC,"oh, forgot that Ibra had such a great midfield with Milan during his first stint with us.  Think he had Nocerino, Flamini, Ambrosini, Muntari, Aquilani, Urby, Van Bommel, and KPB for the majority of his time with us, there's not an ounce of creativity in that midfield yet he had no problem not only creating chances for himself, but for others as well.  Yeah he had a bit of an injury problem this season, but he was still able to play ~35 matches, and played 45+ the two seasons prior to that.  It's not like he's El Shaarawy missing months at a time through injury.  He'd be the best player in the league if he re-joined Milan, it's a no brainer to take him back imo."
ACMilan,3ds9c6,Piscinin,2,Sun Jul 19 00:54:03 2015 UTC,"Well back when they were all on a team together, KPB and Nocerino actually played well from what I saw that season; van bommel wasn't terrible either. Not even close to the caliber of PSG's midfield, but decent at least. Wasn't seedorf also at midfield (not that that makes much of a difference).   We're all entitled to our opinions and criticisms. I hope I'm wrong and he has a fantastic season with us and bring us back to the top, but, I just don't see it happening the way we all want it to. If he had a drastic drop in salary, then no question, bring him back. But €7.5mil is just too much for a 33 year old IMO."
ACMilan,3ds9c6,snatchmastaflex,9,Sun Jul 19 01:23:25 2015 UTC,"Those midfielders were made to look good BECAUSE of Ibra, not the other way around. Only MVB was actually good. The rest just took advantage of the huge amounts of space that Ibra opened up behind him. Notice how Noce and KPB both turned to utter shit when Ibra left, it's not a coincidence."
ACMilan,3ds9c6,Junaid96,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:29:51 2015 UTC,"Nocerino, yeah I agree. But In my opinion, KPB wasn't bad. Allegri playing him a different position every week ruined him."
ACMilan,3ds9c6,snatchmastaflex,5,Sun Jul 19 01:42:10 2015 UTC,"Apparently he's been shit at Schalke as well, and he was never a star before he joined Milan. He has only ever been good for two seasons of his career (and they just so happened to be the two seasons Ibra was here)."
ACMilan,3ds9c6,Junaid96,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:45:17 2015 UTC,I'm inclined to agree with you.
ACMilan,3ds9c6,Super_Sic58,2,Sun Jul 19 06:58:26 2015 UTC,"You're being downvoted, but people don't realize that 7.5m at age 36 is insane.  Even if he is our beloved Zlatan. Why didn't we spend this kind of money on a guy like Benteke?"
ACMilan,3ds9c6,KanyeWest_GayFish,7,Sun Jul 19 00:27:46 2015 UTC,"Because Benteke costs close to 50m, wtf would you ever pay that for someone of his caliber, unbelievable"
ACMilan,3ds9c6,Piscinin,-3,Sun Jul 19 00:40:46 2015 UTC,"Maybe not Benteke, but we are supposed to have 150m this window so I don't think we should settle for a 34 year old, no matter how good he is now, he could severely drop off at any point"
ACMilan,3ds9c6,KanyeWest_GayFish,7,Sun Jul 19 00:43:43 2015 UTC,"If he joins he'd be the best player in serie a, that's hardly 'settling'."
ACMilan,3ds9c6,Piscinin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:47:56 2015 UTC,"Firstly, that 150m figure is just rumours and I don't know why everyone keeps referencing it.  Second, it's a three year contract and he's not going to severely drop off in three years. Besides, his main purpose is just to bring us back into the CL as quickly as possible. Once we're back in CL everything becomes a lot easier for us."
ACMilan,3ds9c6,Junaid96,3,Sun Jul 19 01:35:46 2015 UTC,I didn't think about the added cash flow being in CL brings. Good point
ACMilan,3ds9c6,KanyeWest_GayFish,3,Sun Jul 19 01:47:47 2015 UTC,"Not to mention that it's much easier to attract stars when you can offer CL football, that's what stopped us from getting Martinez and might stop us from getting Witsel. Turan also said he rejected us because we weren't in CL (he would have chosen Barca anyway but you get my point), perhaps Hummels would have been possible as well."
ACMilan,3ds9c6,Junaid96,2,Sun Jul 19 02:00:11 2015 UTC,"Witsel is set to join chelsea,  also galliani said no way we are gonna get him"
ACMilan,3ds9c6,klejklej,2,Sun Jul 19 10:57:25 2015 UTC,"No reputable source has said that Witsel will join Chelsea and what Galliani says in interviews doesn't mean anything. But yeah, I don't believe either that we'll get him."
ACMilan,3ds9c6,Junaid96,-1,Sun Jul 19 11:25:44 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I love him and love watching him, but he had his time here, and it was great. Now he's 33 and we don't need someone that age taking up all the space on our wage bill."

French commentators though.  A bit weird that they do the national anthems for the clubs, since obviously there are players that aren't from either of the countries. Quite bad that there was quite a bit of booing when the Italian national anthem was played though.  The lineups were this, if I didn't make a mistake when it was on screen: Lopez; De Sciglio, Alex, Ely, Calabria, Nocerino, De Jong, Bertolacci; Bonaventura; Niang, Suso"

ACMilan,3do2n9,EsSJay11,2,Sun Jul 19 10:14:46 2015 UTC,Indeed
ACMilan,3dniuv,DiscoPopShop,5,Fri Jul 17 18:39:09 2015 UTC,"Is DES De Sciglio? (not an abbreviation I'm familiar with) He's there, though. Abate isn't (subbed off against Legnano), hopefully just precaution and nothing serious."
ACMilan,3dniuv,tworedpillowcases,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:22:40 2015 UTC,"DES is what you're thinking, yes."
ACMilan,3dniuv,Begorrahh,10,Fri Jul 17 20:39:16 2015 UTC,I prefer the abbreviation MDS.
ACMilan,3dniuv,tworedpillowcases,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:40:36 2015 UTC,"Assuming only three more players will arrive (centerback, midfielder and Zlatan) there are plenty of players to pick from that can be disposed. Matri, Cerci and Alex would be my guesses, maybe Menez if a good bid arrives."
ACMilan,3dniuv,Masterofknees,3,Fri Jul 17 20:45:11 2015 UTC,"No Mastour is an interesting one, could we really be selling him? Or has he been 'demoted' to the Primavera and he will be returning with Locatelli, Cutrone et al?"
ACMilan,3dniuv,acm149,2,Fri Jul 17 20:46:42 2015 UTC,"Someone said when they removed him from roster that he will be playing with primavera team this year as well, so it looks like that is true. I really think he is still too young to be at all important for a first team, but he has too much self esteem so it might be a reason for him to leave. though he wont get a spot in a first team anywhere actually worth going"
ACMilan,3dniuv,Syklon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:40:32 2015 UTC,U21s don't count. So Mastour can play even without being registered.
ACMilan,3dniuv,Syklon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:09:02 2015 UTC,"I found that strange too, especially as there are only three strikers in that squad (and one of them is Matri, who hardly counts)."
ACMilan,3dniuv,Kep128,2,Fri Jul 17 20:35:32 2015 UTC,Where is Menez?
ACMilan,3dniuv,Begorrahh,2,Fri Jul 17 22:57:31 2015 UTC,I believe he is still recovering from injury.
ACMilan,3dniuv,ACM-Srbija,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:09:13 2015 UTC,happy to see Montolivo back in action.  is he still our captain?
ACMilan,3dniuv,IsIndianStereotype,4,Fri Jul 17 22:04:00 2015 UTC,"No word about a change, so I assume that is the case still."
ACMilan,3dniuv,SuperPippo9,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:14:19 2015 UTC,"This line-up is depessing but I'll give it a try predicting it.  -------------Lopez-----------  Calabria--Alex---Paletta--MDS  -Nocerino---De Jong---Bona-  ------------Suso-------------  ------Niang--------Cerci------  Calabria might start over Antonelli with MDS in LB position because I am not sure if Anto is 100% fit yet. He seemed to be going through separate physical training with Paletta and Monto. I put Paletta in because I don't want to see Zaccardo there. Maybe Ely?  Same reason why I went with Nocerino instead  of Montolivo in midfield. I would LOVE if Bertolacci got in but I think Miha prefers Bona as the attacking box-box midfielder. Poli could also play instead of Nocerino but...I don't know if his defensive capabilities are fully developed yet.   Suso might get ahead of Honda as CAM based on his friendly performances but this is really iffy. Honda still is the best passer in the team when he isn't getting slammed by right backs.  Niang and Cerci seem to be the obvious choice in attack. inb4 Matri becomes the next Inzaghi.   Honestly, I hope I am completely wrong with my choices."
