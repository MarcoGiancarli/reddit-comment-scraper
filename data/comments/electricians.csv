electricians,3e5jbu,Devon8822,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:01:30 2015 UTC,"There is a huge difference between getting electrocuted, and touching a live wire like what we might accidentally do once or twice or month.   We're working on either a wood floor, or a concrete slab 90% of the time. We have ZERO connection to ""ground"", but if you touch a live wire, you're still going to get zapped obviously, even though it technically doesn't have any path to take. That isn't getting electrocuted.   If anyone manages to get legitimately electrocuted because they have somehow created a current path to ground through themselves, 90% chance that they're dead.   Edit: I guess I forgot the part about conductive footwear. The purpose of them is to be used on a ""grounded floor"" to discharge any static electricity that you might build up. They're usually worn when working where flammable gases or dusts are present."
electricians,3e5jbu,ithinarine,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:20:02 2015 UTC,"Ok so regarding the conductive footwear, does that means its not designed for personal safety so much as to prevent static electricity form causing other problems. If you were to touch a live wire with conductive footwear you would probably be dead? is that correct or totally misunderstood?  So why dont birds and squirrels get zapped when they touch wires? Maybe thats a bad example but its always the one that I hear used. they aren't grounded but wouldnt they still get zapped?"
electricians,3e5jbu,Zakraidarksorrow,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:43:28 2015 UTC,"Its because they're part of a Faraday cage, there's no potential difference between the bird and anything else with a lesser resistance for the current to flow to. Electricity will take the easiest path to go to ground, similar to water which also follows the easiest path due to the same reason - Resistance.  It's not true that if you touch a live wire you'll get a shock no matter what, it's only if you create a path through you between the live wire and another conductive material which links to earth or neutral or anything else. For instance, if you're standing on an insulated ladder and brush against a live wire you might think it was dead, until you touch something thats conductive at the same time, I've done this before when changing a light; touched the live and no shock, but my hand touched something that was earthed/grounded and thats when I got a shock. Another misconception is that it's the amps that kill you and not the volts. Its a combination of the two but is still rather dangerous stuff to play with. It only takes one unlucky zap to stop your heart or knock off another important organ in the body. As for the non insulated boots, I would presume that they are for dealing with electronical components such as low voltage circuit boards (12-24v DC)  and such, rather than the normal low voltage AC (120-1000v). Also for the reasons above, the volatile and explosive environments.  If you want any other explanations then I'm sure Wikipedia has a page on the Faraday Cage principle.  Hope this helps!"

The RCD marked ""pool board"" is for the second consumer unit. The 80/2/30T RCD is just a standard RCD with no overload protection (unless I'm being stupid and misreading something?)

I could be wrong but that reads to me as a 80 amp (2 pole) breaker and 30 mA RCD combined. I'm not sure you can make an RCD without over current protection for reasons to do with saturating the measuring transformer.  I think you're safe."
electricians,3e4lt6,InfiniteTree,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:08:45 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that particular one, but you can definitely get RCDs that don't have overload protection. It's pretty common to run through an MCB and then through an RCD in domestic boards here in AUS.  Edit: On second inspection, that's definitely just an RCD. It has no KA rating for fault current. RCD only just means there is no bimetal strip for overload, it just measures leakage current between active and neutral. I would be getting an electrician to install an MCB for that circuit. You're correct, it's dangerous."
electricians,3e4lt6,Jim-Jones,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:01:47 2015 UTC,"Then why the rating? Fact is, we don't know how these are wired. The 2 pole 100A MCB may be protecting everything. And it's possible there are pole fuses outside as well.  I wouldn't assume the sparkie here didn't know what he was doing. But if OP wants to call someone in, why not?"
electricians,3e4lt6,InfiniteTree,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:17:49 2015 UTC,They very well could be. But a 100A MCB and a pole fuse will not protect a 10mm cable. It can still burn down the house if it's a low amperage fault. That's why overload protection is tailored very specifically to the size of the cable it's protecting. The pole fuse is there to protect the mains.

I also believe there needs to be an emergency disconnect within 5' from the tub. Might be nice to have a dedicated circuit for the tub but I'm not totally sure about that either since I don't know how much juice your particular hot tub requires. All of the tubs we have installed have been on dedicated 220 circuits. I would certainly hire someone to do the work and I would venture a guess that they will want to run a dedicated circuit for your tub.
electricians,3e5mxd,Smoke_Stack707,2,Wed Jul 22 03:45:50 2015 UTC,"You want a plug that is GFI protected, preferably on it a own circuit, as those plug in hot tubs require about 12-15 amps, at least in my experience. You don't need a disconnect as it has the cord that can be unplugged and it's not really meant to be permanently fixed in place. If the lights are plugged into a GFI protected receptacle than you should be fine, really bo different than having them outside exposed to the elements."

Also, running conduit is not a low-level task. Everyone from 3rd year apprentices and above can be asked to run conduit. It's one of the core skillsets, and if you can't bend pipe well, your other skills will also be questioned.  If you want to work your way into a certain field, you typically do it after your apprenticeship. Unless, of course, you have relatives at the superintendent level or above at the company you're wanting to work at. You can help your chances at moving toward specific fields by networking with fellow apprentices as well as learning as many different things about the trade as you can. One example is to learn low voltage work even though technicians typically do it. And rigid pipe. And assembling switch gear. And fire alarm. And motor control work. And troubleshooting... Once other people see that you can handle any task you're given, you'll be given more of the complex work. This will also give you the confidence and ability to go to a different employer with the attitude that if it's on the drawings or it has instructions you can take care of it.  Finally, if a union shop is looking for a particular ability in a certain field, they'll call for a journeyman that has a specific certification. This is a fairly common practice."

Keep in mind that the cable guy is not an electrician.  You do not need an ""electrical grounding block"" if it isn't new construction. Just ground the cable system to the same ground that the service is grounded to.  Do not run a separate ground for the cable. It must be bonded to the ground for the meter that supplies the building."

When you force current into a capacitor, the dielectric is stressed. As a result, it wants to release the current and the voltage is a measure of the force waiting to cause the release.  Try this video and the related ones. They should help you to understand."

electricians,3e2z7z,ithinarine,2,Tue Jul 21 16:31:54 2015 UTC,"Ya, just the box extender. The metal ones are usually good for no more than double drywall, the plastic ones my company uses can extend out by a good inch or more if need be.   You'd be surprised how much more the screws go down even with a wire under them. With a screw fully loosened, if you have the outlet set all the way to the right, the screws are no more than 1/16"" away from the box, if not actually touching. Even with a wire under it and tightened, you probably end up with 1/4"" at least."

The concept of not tightening down the screws seems so foreign to me. This week I'm selling my house and I'm updating some of the things I've been putting off. I spent a couple minutes getting kind of pissed off because after loosening a receptacle screw I still couldn't get the damn wire to come loose.  Stab back 14 AWG wires don't require the screws to be tightened and unlike commercial receptacles, the residential ones I bought came with all the screws backed all the way out. According to a friend of mine that does Resi work, nobody tightens those screws because it's a waste of time and when you're getting paid by the piece, it's also wasted money.  I just thought it was interesting to see it here again."

electricians,3e3eyg,electricgrowaway,4,Tue Jul 21 17:32:59 2015 UTC,"Ok, first off, you need to be clear about what kind of system it is.  If it's a high leg delta, it's 120/240, if it's y, it's 120/208.  It is entirely possible that the building used to have a delta feed and that it was changed to y at some point.  Figure that out first, then we can look at balancing loads."
electricians,3e3eyg,kidcharm86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:25:31 2015 UTC,"Sorry, yeah that was a typo on my part. It is 120/208."
electricians,3e3eyg,kidcharm86,3,Tue Jul 21 20:58:14 2015 UTC,"If it's really 120/208y than you don't have a high leg and can therefore put 120v loads on any phase. But you're also saying the lights are wired 240v, which is it?"
electricians,3e3eyg,kidcharm86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:38:08 2015 UTC,"The lights are Gavita 1000 DEs. They operate at 120  - 277V.  I do not understand how putting a 120v recep circuit on a 208V leg is OK. Although after doing some reading it seems the 208V is to ground, not neutral. Am I reading right?  edit: ok, so it seems the system is actually a 4 wire Delta. There is a neutral present, and I am nearly positive I do get 208V to neutral. It's been a week and a half since I was there, but I will be there tomorrow, so I will double check. But I am 99% certain this is what we are dealing with."
electricians,3e3eyg,ithinarine,3,Tue Jul 21 22:53:35 2015 UTC,"A 120/240 delta system will give you 240v between any legs, 120v to neutral/ground on 2 of the legs and 208v to neutral/ground on the high leg. The high leg is unusable to neutral as it is an unstable voltage.   Please be careful working with a delta system especially if you don't have a full grasp of how it works. If you want to balance your loads on a delta system, make sure any 240v (2 pole breaker,  NOT MULTIWIRE) has one leg on the high leg and then do your best to balance the two other legs."

electricians,3e27b6,Jim-Jones,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:15:18 2015 UTC,"As a general rule, when you run 60 cycle stuff on 50 Hz power, you reduce the voltage in proportion. Thus, you want to run the 120 volt stuff on 100 volts. When you get your transformer, set the input voltage (in back) to the highest setting and that's as good as you can do.  Amazon isn't really telling me what I would like to know. You're probably going to be OK. If the devices say they'll run on 50/60 power or they have a range of voltages like 85 - 240 you're good as well.  Your transformer is way too big. 50 or 100 watts should be more than enough. That will save a lot on shipping too. BTW, I'd also include a US power bar to plug the stuff into. You can plug that into the transformer. Only one of those front sockets provides 120 volts.  You could call the various companies on Skype, using their toll free numbers. They may be able to tell you about frequency and voltage ranges or give you exact specifications.  There are other 'fixes' possible but they get a bit complicated to explain."

electricians,3e27b6,sd_entertainmnt,2,Tue Jul 21 12:30:59 2015 UTC,"Besides from the voltage, there's also a frequency difference, USA runs on 60 Hz and the UAE uses 50 Hz. This means all motor pumps will run slower and there may be vibration/starting problems as well."

electricians,3e27b6,Draco1200,2,Tue Jul 21 13:56:57 2015 UTC,This is only true for AC to DC power supplies. It does not apply to AC motors generally used in aquarium pumps.
electricians,3e27b6,budaslap,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:03:15 2015 UTC,"Check the amperage, watt, and VA ratings on your motor and on the transformer carefully;   you will want to make sure  the pump is not going to draw more than 80% of the converter's rating, even during startup inrush or during maximum load,  And that the converter you choose is a high-quality one  that will not overheat with continuous operation.  Looks like the above one is perhaps 500 Watts,  so you'll definitely not want  to use with a pump that requires more than 400 VA.  Many standard converters are ""for short term use"".   Most household appliances only draw much power at brief intervals when the appliance is in use.  But your aquarium pump needs to run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Using an additional converter is not ideal and might be less-energy efficient if the pump itself already has a transformer,  there are going to be additional power losses.  But  I believe it is sound in principle,  as long as  your choice of converters is a good one."

A base near me has old buildings with blue black red phase colors and they like to keep it consistent inside of said buildings. New construction is done in standard black red blue phase colors though. It makes doing service work quite confusing at times, especially when you have something like circuit 12,14,16 in a box and someone decided not to label because they assumed the colors would be enough.

You used 250kcmil aluminium to feed the panel, so I looked it up in my table, and that only makes sense if this is a 225A panel or you had to derate for whatever reason.  shrug cool man. wirenuts in the bottom of the panel.  Splicing inside the panel isn't allowed in tons of places, including all of Canada.  You probably have a reason, but I'll just point that out. You're using 20A breakers for receptacles all over the condo?  It meets code here, but it's an odd choice.   Your labels show 18 (plug), that's a circuit number, not a count, right? Panel has a separate neutral from bonding bar, along with no main breakers.  Totally assume that means this is a subpanel."
electricians,3dzxvn,BobIV,3,Mon Jul 20 23:46:54 2015 UTC,Splicing is allowed in a panel of your using the NEC Code Book 312.8 splicing in panel board   There's also nothing in the code that says how many outlets you can put on a circuit   If your in a commercial building 20 amp circuits are minimum
electricians,3dzxvn,redditmoose,2,Tue Jul 21 00:04:40 2015 UTC,"On the first point, according to 6-212 apparently it's that you can't splice ""through"" the panel, but apparently to get into it is fine.  (my mistake)  In Canada you're limited to 12 devices unless the device is specifically substantially less than 1A after de-rating any possibly continuous loads, in which case you can push it a little bit at the AHJ's approval.  In commercial buildings here, they typically de-rate wire for voltage drop over long distances, so you end up using #12 even for 15A receptacles often enough that most customers just spec to use #12."
electricians,3dzxvn,BobIV,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:16:17 2015 UTC,"Curious about your Canadian code...  By ""devices"" do you mean ""receptacles""?  Because there are many instances where a single switch can control more than 12 lights by its self, let alone the while circuit."
electricians,3dzxvn,microwavedbulb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:54:12 2015 UTC,"Code limits 15A and 20A circuits to 12 specifically in one spot.  On my phone or I'd find it for you.  Past that, the reason is 15A with de-rating for continuous load, which is also specified elsewhere.  Probably 8-102 or 104 if memory serves.  Each receptacle counts as 1A continuously for the purpose of this calculation.   As does a 100W lightbulb,  which you need to consider if your providing an A-style bulb socket.  LED strips and pots run on less and can't be replaced up accidentally, so they can be overloaded a bit, but not ad nauseum."

electricians,3e0wxz,WastedCanuck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:41:49 2015 UTC,"Study the code book. Always check Appendix B.   Make sure you can convert between square feet and square meters. A big chunk of your mark is going to come from doing a house load calculations, and they'll probably give you dimensions in square feet.  I remember when I did mine, I applied the multiplier to go from feet to meters, 3.some, instead of square feet to square meters, 9.something. I got lucky because I showed all my work and code citations. The instructor decided to only dock one mark for the one wrong step instead of a ton of marks because every number I had after that step had a wrong answer. There's a good chance you won't be so lucky."

You can be an electrician and just do solar work, but you can't only know how to do solar and be an electrician. There's not much to know for just installing solar panels and inverters, especially when compared to the rest of the trade. Don't try and limit yourself to just doing solar work, there's a lot more to do in this trade that is far more enjoyable and lucrative.

electricians,3dycry,milky78,2,Mon Jul 20 21:02:17 2015 UTC,"Yes its a thing. You will find though that your apprenticeship will give you greater skills than the ones needed to hook up solar panels. There is a cert to hook up solar, its pretty easy and it might be required to preform solar work in your area.  Now the truth, if you are working solar exclusively youll figure out quickly that its shitty work. Think about it. You are going to be working where there is maximum sun exposure outdoors. Roofs, fields, places like old landfills, not great work. Plus all you'll be doing is bolting down bracing for the panels and running two wires to junction boxes. Nothing really fun about that. People who dont know electrical glorify the idea of having solar cert as part of the trade, but if you are a regular old resi/ commercial electrician you realize that its not a great part of the job to do. People who work solar exclusively make less on average, usually arent electricians, and rely on a 'qualified person' to hook up the inverter or building DC system.   If you want to prepare for a challenge and still make green energy, shoot for wind. Learn controls/ BMS or whatever its called at your school, get really sharp with that, take the renewable energy class and then try to move to an area with wind farms. Thats the higher part of the trade and takes someone really smart and dedicated to work it.   You might have to get a solar cert depending on what you do in your jurisdiction. Depending on the kind of job that your on they may need to cover all rooftop with panels and need a person with that cert to do it. Thats kind of how it is where I am, but not having that cert means Im not going to be the guy going home with a sun burn every day (:"

Drilled holes in 1/4"" utility board and pushed the sockets through the holes. I tacked them in place with construction adhesive, but if I were to do it again, I'd look for a string with some kind of screw collar if possible. It's just easier than holding all of the sockets steady while the adhesive sets.   The advantage of using pre-made light strings is that the bulbs are low wattage, usually G40 bulbs or similar (that's a 40 mm globe style), and they are designed to operate together. You can connect a string or three in series (check the rating on the label), and if you just buy an extra string, you will have plenty of spare matching bulbs."

Could have been a short that happened that might have cleared itself for the time being.  The breaker tripping and being in the ""off"" position leads me to believe the breaker is faulty.  Is it old?  You smell any smoke anywhere?  Just be cautious... if everything is OK right now I wouldn't worry much... I would maybe have someone look at the breaker box and make sure there is no charring."

No smell of smoke, nothing at all unusual.  It's been hours and the power hasn't shut off again.  I'm in a trailer house and yes, it's old, probably late 70s if I had to guess.

They are a back up set now, but still work better then most brands that are brand new. 40 dollars is expensive if your just using them at home 2-3 times a year. Any tool you use every day you want something that works and lasts. Same goes for pipe wrenches rigid is the only brand worth buying imo."
electricians,3dw27k,LT_lurker,3,Mon Jul 20 16:24:24 2015 UTC,"Klein is good to me. They come too stiff out of the package though you really need to work them in, smash them, oil them, until they just drop open in your hands. My linesmen have the fish tape puller which you don't really need for home use. There are also models with a crimper and there are various grip options. My diag cutters are also klein I like the 15 degree angled head version (blue grip) I recommend as big as you can get. Some companies make smaller cutters that are cheaper but you get less leverage and cutting power. Get hardened steel blades. Klein makes the 8"" standard, I think Knipex had some that are even larger like 9-10"" just shy away from cheaper 6-7"" cutters as you won't cut much with them. For the amount you may use them though is it really worth 35-45 bucks when there are 5-10 dollar knockoffs? If I didn't use mine so much Id say no.  I like Milwaukees new hand tools. And a buddy had Channel Lock linesmen and besides the fact they have no fish tape pullers I like the feel of them. Greenlee I don't like, maybe the ones I used are just too stiff.. they look just like Kleins but didn't feel the same to me. I like a lot of greenlee tools but not those. My 2c."

I had their razor knife which was the best one I've ever had but I lost it. I've got nothing against Kleins and I have several of their tools I just can't stand blind loyalty to something just because everyone else likes it. I wasn't aware that they are one of the last brands still made here so that's cool.

Changing out circuit breakers without cutting power to the whole box is dangerous, and people DO die attempting to do this kind of work.  If you don't change out the breaker, that 120 vac outlet won't shut off in the event of a short circuit or other problem, and you'll have a REAL mess.    I just want to be sure you recognize the dangers of this before you get too deep into it."
electricians,3dvar6,ThatGuyinHouston,5,Sun Jul 19 23:10:25 2015 UTC,You will need to change a breaker in the panel to a 15 or 20 amp and disconnect one power wire that's going to the dryer receptacle. You will then need to change the dryer receptacle to a normal receptacle and will need a adapter ring to attach it to the box. You won't need to run a new line though.

electricians,3dvar6,ApplePickinSolarBoy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:16:21 2015 UTC,"Could they also replace the 2-pole breaker with two single-pole breakers, then replace the outlet and snap the tabs and put a split phase on each port? I guess it depends on how old the 240v outlet is and if it had a neutral."
electricians,3dvar6,Draco1200,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:32:25 2015 UTC,"A 3-prong dryer outlet should have  had 2 Hots and one Neutral.    You would need to run another line to safely do a second outlet split-phase,  unless there is already  second neutral line in the outlet box.  Unless it is a 4-prong receptacle or metal box; ground could be a problem,  as  there might be no ground wire on a  220 / 240V dryer outlet."
electricians,3dvar6,fcisler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:58:51 2015 UTC,"Your a little off. An older three pole dryer outlet is indeed two hots and a neutral, no ground. You could install a single outlet and reidentify one conductor as ground.     If it were a four wire outlet then it's two hots a neutral and a ground. You can safely convert this to a multi wire branch circuit using a single neutral. Provided that the hots are each on a different leg, the load on the neutral is the difference between the loads on the hot."
electricians,3dvar6,Draco1200,0,Mon Jul 20 02:07:31 2015 UTC,"You can safely convert this to a multi wire branch circuit using a  single neutral.   And then later, if  the Neutral connection breaks, you suddenly have a 120v wall receptacle that can be putting out 240 volts..... But you might consider it unlikely.  Still:  this is no good with two single pole breakers. If you want to have a multi-wire branch circuit,  then you have got to have a two pole 20A breaker,   so that if one  is off  they are both turned off."
electricians,3dvar6,fcisler,3,Mon Jul 20 02:28:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, I didn't elaborate on that but you are correct - its a relatively (15-20yrs?) New addition to code.  Mwbc are considered safe. There are further restrictions (ie: neutral must be wired in such a way as removing any device in the circuit will not break it), but to portray it as unsafe or dangerous is just flat out wrong. It's perfectly acceptable and safe and used all the time."
electricians,3dvar6,lookatthatsquirrel,3,Mon Jul 20 02:44:15 2015 UTC,They made the code for 2-pole or approved handle tie in 2008.  It's 240.15(B)(1) in the 14.  Not sure what it is in the 08 or 11.  Even a 3 wire dryer cord is likely wired in 4-wire.  They neutral had to be insulated or part of an SE cable.  They pulled 10-3 RX to dryers through  the late 70's and 80's.  You could do a double duplex at the dryer and just install a 2-pole 20 at the panel.  Pretty simple.

There are a lot of them, they aren't required, and if you do a good job you'll be safe and make more money in the long run than fucking around offering people problems instead of time tested solutions. Like edison 3-wire for example.  The power company runs one neutral to your house and it works all day long. One hot pulled out of the meter pan at my grandpa's house a couple years ago, and his range was back-feeding half the loads in the house. Dangerous situation, and preventable by leaving more slack in the meter pan.  Shit happens when you don't think ahead, but usually not if you do a good job."

Two single pole breakers are not allowed  without simultaneous trip of both hots.  So a double-pole or tied breaker is mandatory for this scenario.

electricians,3du8wq,mork,6,Mon Jul 20 20:18:31 2015 UTC,"Put a little money aside each week for tools, but don't start buying them right away. Get on site, see what the journeymen carry and then buy a tool every other week or so to build up your kit. And remember, cheap tools are too expensive for a working man in the long run.  Other than that, try to keep a good attitude. You are going to get a lot of crap projects. You will be in ditches, you will run material, you will clean. But, no one is asking you to do anything they haven't done. We all started out as green helpers, and had to do the crap jobs that keep a job running. If you listen and learn though you might be surprised how fast you become more valuable with tools in your hands than a broom."
electricians,3du8wq,Soaply,3,Sun Jul 19 16:04:43 2015 UTC,"Dont fold your arms, put your hands on your hips, or your hands in your pockets. That says you are not working and people can see that from across the jobsite. Someone said leave your phone in your pocket, same thing with a watch, an MP3 player, any other thing than something you need for work. If you have something on you to play with, it is going to be assumed you are playing with that and not working.   Expect to be carrying stuff, digging, cleaning out areas, cleaning up after shitty journeymen, sweeping, helping make and wire temporary things, and getting food for break. Dont argue when it needs to get done, but make sure thats not the ONLY thing you are doing. Dont come at your foreman like ""IM NOT HERE TO SWEEP!"", but if theres a thing that you want in on, ask. Ask relentlessly. Seem interested in it.   Know the pecking order. I was an apprentice and I had to high press 20 - 500 MCM's together and I was paired with this journeyman. He didnt know how to strip the 500's. He sawed at the jacket for about an hour on one of them and almost cut too much off. The foreman came in an hour later to 1 wire stripped, sort of. I was a 3rd yr apprentice so I was following directions of the journeyman and letting him do it. The foreman yelled at me. It was my fault. The foreman knew I could do the work and knew the journeyman couldnt because he grabbed a bender when we were talking about high pressing stuff. The foreman and I finished everything within an hour and the journeyman took out trash. Needless to say that journeyman didnt have a job the next day. But if you know whats expected from you, and by who, your job will be easy. Learn who is who and what your role is and everything will be fine.  All of the tool advice here is good. A tool a week. I would buy test equipment per what the job/ contractor calls for. I personally would not buy a clamp ammeter and have only recently started using one on the job, but its possible on residential service calls you may need one."
electricians,3du8wq,fly_bird,4,Sun Jul 19 17:05:11 2015 UTC,Get familiar with what the names of the tools and material are called and also where they are kept. This will take a bit of time but the way to a journeyman's heart is by having ready what he is going to want next.

electricians,3du8wq,Jim-Jones,3,Sun Jul 19 15:39:23 2015 UTC,"Hey man. It's good that you are asking advice about what to do. The main thing is that you keep busy and always know what you are doing. Just keep asking questions if you do not know why you are doing what you are doing. Everything is being done in a certain way for a reason, and its generally good to know that reason. There is SO MUCH to learn but they are not going to expect you to learn it all in one day. I always keep a small note pad to put in my frocket with a pen. It helps a lot. Try to gain the basic concept of electricity as early as possible. I mean like really basic. ""This wire is hot so this plug is going to be hot also"" type stuff. If there is a safety concern, talk to your foreman asap.  There is no such thing as a wire stretcher!  Just take it easy and have fun. They won't give you anything you can't handle. Good luck.   Ps. Absolutely no complaining. I don't care if it's 120° with no shade. Just ask for water and keep trucking. That's how you gain respect, show them you're a good worker in the worst conditions and everybody will want you to work for them."

Regardless of what you are being told to do, say ""yes sir"", do what you are told, and don't be afraid to ask questions. This will make you stand out, and you will be more likely to get to ""real"" work faster."
electricians,3du8wq,Jim-Jones,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:13:04 2015 UTC,"Country/state?  Did you check the sidebar?  I'd buy an inexpensive clamp ammeter. You can get one for around $10 that should do. You shouldn't be working on hot systems for now, so you'll rarely need it and if you blow it up or lose it or someone steals it you won't cry too much. By the time you outgrow it you'll know what you do want and you'll make a wiser choice.  When you do that, look on eBay. You can often find very good meters, brand new, at steep discounts. There's little need to pay more than you have to.  But that's MOO. YMMV."

electricians,3dux0r,rwanders,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:20:13 2015 UTC,"Definitely depends on the boxes and how they are currently attached, as well as how the wire is run. If it is plastic boxes it is most likely some other sort of non-metallic sheathed cable, which means the boxes are not grounded."
electricians,3du9fl,MetalBuyers,4,Sun Jul 19 15:11:21 2015 UTC,"The only word of caution I have is that neither field equips you for the other.  Guys who have put their time into both areas are often invaluable because they have a solid mix of practical skills and theory.    But electricians who simply got an EE bachelors with no significant design time, or EEs who simply got a license with no significant construction time, are not very useful.    The value is in the experience, not the piece if paper."
electricians,3du9fl,JohnProof,3,Sun Jul 19 23:00:01 2015 UTC,"There is a huge gap in the quality of work. If you get a masters license you need trade experience especially in NY. If you get your PE you can do basically the same things but better. I think a good fast track job would be working for a design build contractor and youd be making money according to your experience.   Not sure what you mean by alot of ""say""? You have the upper hand of the design and building aspects of a job, but that doesnt mean you can allocate labor well, design something well, draft a good contract, automatically have an ""in"" with the AHJ, or that your company will find you profitable.   Design build is certainly a good route to go and youll get all the experience you need in order to progress professionally. Large companies have teams of engineers designing things constantly and always are trying to find good workers. Thats the route I would go..."
electricians,3du9fl,duckquil,2,Sun Jul 19 16:38:50 2015 UTC,"It would really depend on how much experience you have in either field...  (a) How long have you been practicing as an Electrical Engineer? Are you a P.Eng? Have you designed electrical building systems?  (b) Do you have any experience as an electrician? Are you a journeyman?   If the answer to (a) is that you just have the degree, and the answer to (b) is that you installed a receptacle once, then the degree is probably rather meaningless and will only show that you can grasp electrical concepts (because you actually would know nothing about building system design).  HOWEVER, being a journeyman/master electrician and being an electrical engineer will make you far more valuable and desirable as a building system electrical engineer. There are several engineers in my office who are also master electricians, and having that experience in our office is invaluable."

Assuming that's happened you're now going to have to spend four years or so working under a PE before you can take your PE exam and get your PE.

Next remove the Gfci and when everything is clear and you feel confident enough turn on the breaker(s) and do a voltage test. If you have the correct voltage replace the Gfci. If the device is to be replaced be sure to pay attention to which set of wires are your load and which one are your line.

electricians,3du4td,Soaply,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:43:40 2015 UTC,Because that switch feeds your kitchen/hallway lights. Meaning power comes in on one of those wires and then goes to your kitchen/hallway on another. Call an electrician if you can't figure it out

When installing in a PVC box such as shown, you take your ""Kleins"" and break them off at the perforations you see running diagonally adjacent to the cover mounting holes.

Sure that could be sub-metered, but why even bother when there's the option not to?  From a non electrical perspective, pull up your city's rental laws:  There are usually pretty clear rules regarding how utilities are treated."
electricians,3dqyo0,duckquil,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:42:13 2015 UTC,"I have lived in two different states with two completely different rules to the matter. USUALLY if you are the payer of the bills you are not obligated in ANY way to allow anyone else to use your electric and usually if your electricity leaves your space and enters another it becomes theft. Even with your knowledge.   However this may not be the case in that he is the building owner and he is allowed to allocate the utilities entering his building to be used the way he sees fit.   Some background info. If he taps the meter base on the utility side, its an issue with him and the power company. If he taps it past your meter, then its an issue with your bill. He wants to tap after the meter because he doesnt want to pay the base fee for just having another meter base on a building. Also in order to get it running he needs to get his new room inspected and probably zoned as an address as well. That costs more money. If hes just trying to get a couch to sleep on and have a light and a TV there, I dont blame him. BUT this will be at your cost.   I cant say if its illegal or not because I dont know. You need to check your states renters laws and possibly even the county or city laws that you are living in. NY state has pretty awesome laws for renters because NYC has had so many past issues that created a need to protect renters. These are consistent throughout the state so if you live in NY and not the city you are protected by the same laws. In your scenario, explicitly, he would have to pay 100% of the bill.   In Virginia this is a different story. He is allowed to charge YOU whatever he wants for utilities and doesnt have to describe the charges or why. I didnt believe this at first, but then I had a roommate that had the electric bill in his name and wanted to ""split the bill three ways"" and I was like ""@$%@$$%@!! NO!!!"" After some research and talks with HOA people I found out that he was actually doing a nice thing. So in NoVA when three or more people split a house (which is common) and one owns it, they can split it evenly, or unevenly, per whatever the lease agreement says. If the landlord sets a rate for utilities as part of the rental agreement for whatever, or leaves open ended statements, they can really screw the renter. I read some horror stories of people in Hampton and Virginia Beach area on Yahoo answers. One was a person in the Navy who basically needed an address and a place to put their stuff. She found a place for around $1k a month and was satisfied with it. After she came back from deployment, the electricity was off and there was past due and eviction notices on her door. She was like WTF?!? Well rent was $1k but her utilities bill was $600 a month. WHILE SHE WAS ON THE OTHER HALF OF THE EARTH...! It was cleverly added to the lease and she barely read it. They charged their rate because they knew they could and most of the people down there will just pay it and not pay attention. Blatant scam on military personnel. I couldnt believe it but there if you literally read the renters laws it allows it. They can literally charge anything. Outcome was there were other people who had the same problem and variations on it and they were able to advise her and help her get legal assistance so her bills were reduced and she was able to find housing elsewhere.   So for you... Know your laws first. Know what they say. If it says no go, then let your landlord know. If he does it anyways, lawyer up and deal with it accordingly. If it says he can, then try and split a deal with him, maybe get him to pay a third of the bill or something? That could be a win if his power draw is a TV and a desk lamp two days a week. Learn about your zoning laws, he may not even be able to be there, or he may say that the kitchen and shower required for his space are part of your apartment. NY state requires you have a shower, toilet, and a kitchen available per unit rented. It can be common but it must be available. Other states will literally allow you to rent a bed out and the only time you can get in and out of the property is when the landlord allows you in and out.   I can only give examples of what I know and have experienced, but you need to talk to him more a gage exactly what his intent is. Also I can say if he taps onto your meter, you will be getting billed for the electricity he uses."
electricians,3dqzws,berger77,8,Sat Jul 18 16:49:15 2015 UTC,What's the load? For 5A you would need #10AWG to keep the voltage drop under 3%. That's at 300'. At 350' you would need to go to a #8AWG.  Southwire has a nice voltage drop calculator here.
electricians,3dqzws,microwavedbulb,6,Sat Jul 18 18:20:49 2015 UTC,"You are allowed 5% overall.  3% is overkill.  Both are suggestions(fine print notes).  The only enforced voltage drop is for starting voltage for fire pumps and that is 15% in 695.7.  If it is temporary, go up to 10% for most loads will take +/- 10%.  The only thing to really consider is the current draw at the end.  The bill will be higher with the load being more.    Temporary installation, 10% is fine.  Permanent installation, <5% is the number to use.  Southwire wants you to use 3% so that they can sell you larger wire.  OP can buy a roll of 10/3 SO cable, a male and a female end and call it a day."
electricians,3dqzws,lookatthatsquirrel,2,Sat Jul 18 22:26:56 2015 UTC,"Southwire wants you to use 3% so that they can sell you larger wire.   No doubt. However, the calculator does allow you to put in other values."
electricians,3dqzws,microwavedbulb,6,Sat Jul 18 23:10:27 2015 UTC,"It is not dangerous as long as the current drawn is low. Because of the increased resistance, voltage will drop proportional to the current used. If you're using a basic extension cord that is 14ga wire, don't use something like a electric stove or get close to the rating of the cord or it can get too hot. Things like a tv, cell phone chargers, led and florescent lights would be fine. Keep under 5 amps. If you need more you're going to need 12 or 10 awg."
electricians,3dqzws,sd_entertainmnt,2,Sat Jul 18 17:15:43 2015 UTC,Excellent responses. The only thing I would add is; if the receptacle supplying the cord is not gfci get a portable one. Plug the cord/cords into it at the supply end.
electricians,3dqzws,theoldtook2000,5,Sun Jul 19 01:49:55 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming GFCI is the equivalent of our RCD protection (I'm from Australia). I would recommend using RCD's at both ends of a cable that long. You want the cable itself on RCD so if something damages it in the forest, it trips as quickly as possible. But you also want an RCD closer than 100m to the devices, so it also trips quickly if something goes wrong at the camp site."

electricians,3dqzws,TurnbullFL,0,Sun Jul 19 01:43:42 2015 UTC,But the same current over a longer cable will heat the cable more.

electricians,3dqzws,TurnbullFL,0,Sun Jul 19 12:18:39 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the load. If you are using some sort of electronics that draws an amp or 2, 14AWG extension cords are fine, but anything larger you risk voltage drop. The issue wont be the cord heating up and burning up, but the joints will, so if you have three cords plugged into each other, the plug ends will get hot and possibly whatever you plug in.   I would say anything motor, heater, large tool, or large bright light is a no. Electronics, TV (?), plugg in batteries, iphone charger (even a few) should be fine."

Smurf tube is good for resi if you are possibly changing your mind later or thinking of adding something else in with it. Its kind of like buying an Escalade as a point A to point B car."

Every other filled up panel I see has neutrals and grounds sharing screws.  Fix it on your own dime. Or don't fix it. Or wait til you have an electrician out for something larger and have him spend 5 or 10 minutes fixing it then.

The rest of what the report says is that they have no way of measuring the depth of the grounding rod, how much water pipe is metal and is covered by earth, etc because they cant dig that stuff up.   Id suck it up and repair it especially if its a house you like. Gripe about it if you like but I think its minor in comparison to what most people have to do.

electricians,3dqdo1,Jim-Jones,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:28:10 2015 UTC,"I haven't tested it with a lightbulb but the multimeter says that for AC voltage it uses ""average responding, calibrated in RMS of a sine wave"" and it always shows the same as the software reporting.  Anyway, it seems the voltage spikes only happen if the input voltage dips below 212V and only then. Otherwise the input and the output voltage is almost exactly the same. I have no idea why that is but an electrical service increase will happen soon with some better wiring (old house) which should prevent the voltage dropping even when the system (outside of the UPS) is under load."
electricians,3dqdo1,Jim-Jones,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:47:06 2015 UTC,"for AC voltage it uses ""average responding, calibrated in RMS of a sine wave""   That means not RMS. Seems like your UPS has a pass through function."

Our company builds panels for controls so we have a couple of different types of label machines - portable and shop-based, but I know the labels are expensive enough that they may not be worth it for field electricians.  Might drive the cost of the job up so much that you'd lose jobs to hand-written label kinda companies.  Just curious.

electricians,3dm7sl,michal_m,2,Fri Jul 17 17:15:06 2015 UTC,Are you allowed to have a larger breaker downstream of a smaller one?  Was under the impression one could only ever move downward.  I.e. The 50 amp on the incoming CB then leads to a 100amp main switch. This might cause some confusion for future techs surely?
electricians,3dm7sl,TED_666,2,Sat Jul 18 12:09:32 2015 UTC,"That 100A piece is not a breaker, it's just a switch. 100A only means how much current it can handle. I often use 100A or even 125A main switches for my panels even though the upstream breaker/fuse is usually only up to 63A. The price difference between, say, 25A and 125A ones is like $2 where I live so I don't even bother stocking up on different current versions."
electricians,3dm7sl,michal_m,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:24:17 2015 UTC,Note that these breakers would trip before the 100A CB in the customer's meter panel.

With C50A it will only be there if short-circuit current in branch circuits turns out to be below 250A. Maybe it was estimated to be lower than that but if it's higher then both CBs will trip.
electricians,3dm7sl,JackGentleman,0,Mon Jul 20 13:34:36 2015 UTC,"As long as the design of the installation satisfies IB ≤ IN ≤ IZ, where IZ = the maximum demand of the apartment (amps), IN = current rating of circuit breakers (amps), and IB = current carrying capacity of cables (amps) [after applying derating factors].  I reckon they limit the breakers upstream because they don't want the owner or occupiers fucking around with the wiring of the apartment. The installation has designed and tested to perform flawlessly. If there's a problem and the 50A CB in the riser is tripped, something has gone wrong and a building superintendent needs to know about before it's re-energised."

electricians,3dm7sl,Jim-Jones,8,Fri Jul 17 13:45:18 2015 UTC,A lot of guys in Australia do this in case you get a burnt cable in the future. You can just cut away the burnt section and re wire the breaker without having to try and pull a new cable or anything.
electricians,3dm7sl,level3ninja,5,Fri Jul 17 21:19:16 2015 UTC,"We don't (necessarily) run conduit into switchboard enclosures. You want to keep the outer sheathing of the cable intact after entering the switchboard for safety reasons and so you can keep labels. The majority of cable used in Australian installations is stranded copper, so its pretty flexible. When it comes time to fit off the board its always better to have too much than too little. And finally personal preference of the installer."
electricians,3dm7sl,oldmatesunshine,4,Sat Jul 18 02:02:14 2015 UTC,Funny enough we are actually taught to leave a serviceable amount in any given panel where possible at trade school. Incase a breaker blows or something fucks the cable.

electricians,3dm7sl,fuzzie_dunlop,2,Fri Jul 17 21:24:47 2015 UTC,You're right it  doesn't. The installer may find it quicker to use copper busbar and is therefore required to put the RCD on the right due to the active terminal being in line before the neutral.
electricians,3dm7sl,toadinthehole,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:44:53 2015 UTC,"On the nice (expensive) Hager RCDs there is two terminals for incoming actives; one accommodating the busbar and one for housing a cable.

electricians,3do546,nataliereddits,4,Fri Jul 17 21:28:11 2015 UTC,Undervoltage could be a cause. Have some one plug in a kettle to the circuit. Measure the voltage before turning on the kettle. Turn it on then measure the voltage as the kettle is drawing electricity. You don't want to see more than 10% diferrence. Canadian electrical code states that it can't be more than 3%.

electricians,3dnpu1,giant_testicles,2,Sat Jul 18 00:56:43 2015 UTC,"Either get an apprenticeship with a company for 4 years who will let you go to college one day a week   Or  Change your job work weekends and go to college full time in the week to get the electrical technial qualifications and hope a company takes you on after to do your nvq level 3 with them  Or probably the best route for you is to look for a national company who are offering electrical apprenticeships.  Basically think of companies like western power, british airways, national grid, London heathrow, national rail, london underground, welsh water, land rover, jaguar all do apprenticeship schemes.  However you may be too late for them as they normally start recruiting in the winter / spring for start in September."

The person who installed it was probably just to lazy to pigtail the wires together. Try putting both blacks as the power input to the switch and the red as the output."
electricians,3dn8c1,Imaelectrician,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:41:04 2015 UTC,"Ok, I will try that! The WeMo switch doesn't discriminate between input and output though apparently; does is matter on a normal switch? Blacks are input, I assume?"
electricians,3dn8c1,Imaelectrician,3,Fri Jul 17 18:29:56 2015 UTC,It doesn't matter on a normal switch. in this case the blacks are the input though I would guess. Some smart switches matter and some don't so I always mention which one is input just in case
electricians,3dn8c1,Imaelectrician,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:46:47 2015 UTC,"Well it says it doesn't matter, but in the photo it does actually have icons for a bulb and for electricity...I assume the source would go to the lightning bolt and the red wire would go to the light?  Additionally, any idea if I could rewire one of those to go to the other switch?"
electricians,3dn8c1,Imaelectrician,2,Fri Jul 17 19:08:22 2015 UTC,"More than likely no. If my guess is right and the blacks are power and the red is the switch then you won't be able to without another wire. If I'm wrong and red is power and each black is the switch leg then you sure could, but I don't think that's the case"
electricians,3dn8c1,Imaelectrician,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:21:29 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. What added to my confusion and sparked this question in the first place was that in the initial wiring setup, the switch only controlled the fan. When i saw two wires, I assumed it meant one was for the light...I guess the only way to test is to carefully bridge each black with the red and see what happens?   I have a multimeter as well; what wires should I test to determine where the live wire is?"

The thing I decided to do is connect the 208v line of a 250w quad tap ballast to the line input of the 208v line of the Postline ballast. The quad tap ballast is connected to 120v mains. The set up worked, the lamps I needed to test worked, and both balllasts only got warm. The ballast is an autotransformer, and with it being higher wattage, the voltage drop isn't to be concerned of."

electricians,3dnlbm,Jim-Jones,3,Fri Jul 17 20:42:16 2015 UTC,If it is rated from 208-277...pretty much a good chance that it can take 240 on the same tap.  Just sayin.

electricians,3djnce,ithinarine,2,Thu Jul 16 22:42:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks man. There are only 3 grounds because there are only 3 pipes entering the panel. Only 1 ground is needed per pipe.

electricians,3djnce,CunderscoreF,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:20:30 2015 UTC,"Ok, I think I get it. So all the grounds are connected in the cans then and just fed down with one?"

That conduit has 12x 14g wires in it, and 6x 12g wires in it total, to feed everything that it is going to be used for.

electricians,3djnce,Eglitarian,0,Sun Jul 19 18:49:13 2015 UTC,I guess I'm in the same boat.  Why doesn't each breaker have a ground?  I appologize if it's a dumb question.  I'm just used to seeing panel boxes that have full ground bars and full neutral bars.
electricians,3djnce,mini_mark7,3,Thu Jul 16 23:53:29 2015 UTC,"Each breaker doesn't need its own ground just each pipe or raceway. You only need to run one ground sized to the largest conductor In the pipe. So if I had a bunch of 20A circuits but 1 40A circuit using #8s, I would need to run a #8 ground.   Just to throw a wrench in things, 250.118(4) states that EMT is a suitable equipment grounding conductor as long as all boxes are metal except for patient care areas of health facilities. So in a lot of cases when running EMT a ground wire is not required. My company always runs grounds anyways, also the job I am doing has it in the specs that a full size ground is required per raceway. Meaning I can't run a #12 for a 20a circuit because I am running #10s.   Hope that helped"
electricians,3djnce,seanandstuff,3,Fri Jul 17 00:41:19 2015 UTC,I would need to run a #8   10 ground for #8 hots.
electricians,3djnce,CunderscoreF,2,Fri Jul 17 09:21:13 2015 UTC,I was told by our AHJ that almost all inspectors require grounds put in every conduit because you can't trust every electrician to tighten every screw and compression coupling all the time. Kind of a good CYA move.
electricians,3djnce,ithinarine,2,Fri Jul 17 01:52:31 2015 UTC,Also lets you keep a continuous ground in the event a box or conduit fitting ever needs to be removed for whatever reason.
electricians,3djnce,persianrug,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:26:39 2015 UTC,"Inspectors can't require that. Many engineers spec it, but it can't be required by an AHJ without a separate written rule to cite. In Alberta, we have the STANDATA which makes amendments to the CEC that are applicable to Alberta only. It's a good idea. I like to do it in all my conduit, but it in most cases, it is unnecessary."

If a listed power cable is fully intact with no damage, not wet, and carrying normal line voltages,  then  it should not be able to shock you.  I believe you must be mistaken on one of the points:  Either the cable did not put 120 volt AC through you,  Or the power cable is not actually undamaged.  There might be a defect in the cable where a conductor is poking through, but you are not able to see it visually.  Or one of the conductors is broken or not connected; it's unlikely but theoretically possible that a high static voltage could have built up.

Wouldn't trip a breaker but the sweatier your hands are the more everything tingles when you touch it.   Saw this in a garage once. All the neutrals and grounds were tied together by someone who thought grounds were unnecessary. Guy was wondering why his drill press shocked him when he was barefoot. My friend and I reached over and turned off his radio and told him to ""try it now"". No more shock. He did correctly rewire the receptacles after that."
electricians,3dnqlr,horceface,2,Fri Jul 17 22:04:25 2015 UTC,"I also happen to be a PC nerd.  Power supply is going.  I've blown up a power supply (I was young and stupid, I overvolted everything and was drawing more wattage than my PSU could handle).  It started buzzing a couple weeks before it went.  I'm guessing the ground inside the PSU, which also connects to the case through the PSU screws, has shorted out.  My bet is that you accidentally brushed against something on the case or power supply that was charged, at the same time you touched the cable, and are assuming you only touched the cable.  Just from my PC experience (been building my own PC's for 15 years now) when you hear a weird buzzing sounds and have electrical problems, it's the PSU.  Also improper voltages can explain the network card problem.  Hardware acts really weird when it doesn't get the right voltage.  PSU problems can be the hardest to diagnose because they cause hardware to give off false error codes."

electricians,3di52o,Terrancelee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:55:14 2015 UTC,"Sorry, responded before I did some caluculations (and before i finished my coffee). You're trying to pull something like 1040w through your dimmer. 1000w is about 9 amps which is fine for a single circuit but your dimmer is probably hating it. You could look for a dimmer that can handle the load (I don't know of one off hand) or you could try to set your sign up on two or three dimmers. I just err'd on the side of caution because when wiring a residence, we never put more than 10 fixtures on a circuit just to be on the safe side (never know if the home owner decides to swap out all the LED bulbs we install with some gnarly 100w CFL's or something ridiculous). Sorry to shoot from the hip like that. You might be able to get away with the lone dimmer if you swapped out the bulbs with LED's since they draw less power."

But I was thinking I could move 2 over the other other one, I only have them split the way I do now because I split it up by letters and not by number of bulbs. But now that everything is put together I think I can do 960w on the larger circuit with the 1000w dimmer. Does that sound safe?   I would try looking for new bulbs, but we already have like 60 bulbs bought and we are looking for a specific style bulb that I couldn't find in LED that was super expensive. I'll keep looking if I absolutely have to though and get new bulbs."
electricians,3di52o,Smoke_Stack707,2,Thu Jul 16 14:14:45 2015 UTC,What style exactly?  Are these medium or candelabra base?  4 letters / 50 lamps .. just how big are these letters?    You can get 7w in both styles and will work much better.

They aren't cheap though. Also all dimmers will get hot with that much load on them.  Right now for 26 40watt bulbs you are at 1040 watts.  I would highly recommend splitting them up
electricians,3di52o,Sergeant_M,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:00:57 2015 UTC,"Yea I was just looking and I found one. 2 of those should work. One more quick question though. Since they will be on a dimmer, if it's not all the way up will that use less wattage? Obviously even if that is true, I'll test and build it for being all the way up. But just wondering.

electricians,3diavp,tupeloms,3,Thu Jul 16 14:28:52 2015 UTC,"It's very unlikely that a power strip/extension cord caused an issue with a device. Unless the power strip/extension cord had an intermittent connection, a cord is a cord and doesn't affect the quality of wall current in any appreciable manner.  More likely the adapter failed."
electricians,3diavp,uint128_t,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:53:16 2015 UTC,thanks for answering. could it have been caused by the usb iphone charging cable plugged into it? whether a fake or genuine apple cable or not?
electricians,3diavp,EffThisImOut,2,Thu Jul 16 17:27:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think that would've caused it, I think you just happened to plug it in to your power strip around the time the adapter started failing."
electricians,3diavp,Malgidus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:07:19 2015 UTC,"it's a brand new adapter, from an apple store. does it make a difference if the cable (apple lightning cable) has microchips and such, a technical usb cable?"
electricians,3diavp,Jim-Jones,2,Thu Jul 16 18:20:46 2015 UTC,"Power adapters are more switch regulators than microchips, but all of them will make a high pitched noise at the switching frequency.

electricians,3diavp,ithinarine,3,Fri Jul 17 20:49:53 2015 UTC,"I was told by an apple store employee that it could have been a bad power extension which caused it, or a non apple cable but they weren't sure.   They know nothing about these matters. These are excuses. Your adapter is at fault."
electricians,3diavp,Jim-Jones,2,Thu Jul 16 21:57:08 2015 UTC,"Dumb question, have you tried plugging it in without the power strip to see if it still makes noise? This at least lets you know if it's the power strip or the actual device that's causing the problem."
electricians,3diavp,Malgidus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:15:46 2015 UTC,"i should have added this: no, it didn't originally make noise when plugged straight into a wall socket. but after two weeks of working silently in a dedicated power strip, it began making noise and yes since that started it has begun also making noise when plugged into a wall socket."

electricians,3djvc8,a_d0nkey,2,Thu Jul 16 21:24:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is dangerous to knock powered equipment into a pool. Also the GFCI may not be working correctly or may be miswired.  I would test all the GFCIs you are using to make sure they are functioning correctly. Some kind of water barrier on the ground would also be advisable, so anyone handling the equipment is not standing in water."

electricians,3djvc8,adolfobama,2,Fri Jul 17 04:21:17 2015 UTC,Yes it would be wise to have the gfci checked for correct operation prior. barriers to prevent people walking past equipment. make sure you tape up all of your plugs to prevent water ingress. and think about the placement of the gear for safety of itself and the patrons

electricians,3djvc8,sst1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:34:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, something like that...  Except we have big speakers on stands pretty much right next to the water (the pool itself takes up most of the room with only small walking areas going around the pool).  I'm not sure where their speakers are (they might patching into some installed system).  Also, it looks like they are using a long throw projector going all the way over the pool; because space is so tight we have to us a super short throw and rear project."
electricians,3djvc8,almost_a_troll,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:39:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the replies - it sounds like we should be okay to go forward if we 1) test all of the outlets to make sure that GFCI is working properly, 2) limit access to jackassery around the speakers and other equipment (we already do this), and 3) ensure that anybody handling any equipment is not standing in water..."
electricians,3djrtd,igotskraped,2,Thu Jul 16 20:57:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think you've tried every way. I see no tail wire from the neutrals that have been hooked onto the switch. The line is the one that goes to multiple switches as it is power. Load is the wire that goes to the light itself. The neutral will need to be a pigtail from the bunch of white wire in the box. Also your mystery switch is a 3 way, so it's something controlled from another location as well as there."

electricians,3djrtd,stewtron89,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:17:24 2015 UTC,So I should pull out the group of white wires behind the switches and add a separate white from that group to the GE switch?  Pardon my newbness but just out of curiousity does the ground make any difference?
electricians,3djrtd,Imaelectrician,2,Thu Jul 16 21:17:04 2015 UTC,"Yes that's exactly what you should do. You can run a ground from the box to the switch if you'd like, but it's not really necessary as the switch should ground itself to the box once you screw it in.."

electricians,3dfo22,silentguardian,9,Thu Jul 16 01:09:11 2015 UTC,It took disovering r/electricians to learn you guys don't use DIN rail in newer installatrions :-) Pretty much everything clips onto it here in the past 20ish years.
electricians,3dfo22,Encryptid,8,Thu Jul 16 02:30:07 2015 UTC,"If you were to show me that picture above with a metal box around it I would assume that it was in an RTU/ AHU or a control cabinet. Our OCPD are all in nice proprietary boxes made just for that. Some have add ons and some have small pieces of DIN rail for relays and contactors, but not like that one above.   You see here in Merica, we are innovators and thinkers. If you gave us a DIN rail to run our service on, we would try to fit as much stuff on that DIN rail as we could. Our cable, internet, home security, pool warmer, outdoor lights, christmas lights (known as ""festoon lighting"" in the NEC), and water main would all be on that rail. Im pretty sure we would also make it a gun rack if we could. That wouldnt be very safe so we limit breakers to a breaker box, fuses to the right size packaging, and everything else goes outside that box."
electricians,3dfo22,persianrug,3,Thu Jul 16 02:42:02 2015 UTC,You make a good point for why it might not be a good idea to use that in Murica.  Too many duct tape warriors.

electricians,3dfo22,redditmoose,4,Thu Jul 16 06:43:14 2015 UTC,"I'd be interested in seeing more pictures, as well as how neatly those panels can come together with some professional workmanship.   Do those breakers only limit current?   Is there any protection from current over the ground wire? Is there any protection from sparking, arcing, or partially open circuits?  (bad connection hotspots?), surge protection, etc? Is there anything done differently for the new LED lighting that seems to prefer DC with lower voltages and amperages, or do you guys just transform it at every light like we do right now? How are those wires brought to the load?  Pipes?"
electricians,3dfo22,MR_Fook,3,Thu Jul 16 05:35:00 2015 UTC,"I can only answer for germany, but this looks kinda familiar.  The breaker protect from overload and short circuit.  There are atleast to RCD connected before the breakers and this is mainly the biggest differecen between America and Europe, we put the RCD in front of the breaker so that if a fault occours the you loose power to everthing, instead of using gfci outlets, you would be hard pressed to find gfci outlets in germany.  There is no special protection for sparking and or arcing besides what the material already offers, but if you install a new panel you have to thourougly check the whole installation with a certified meter and you have to create a measuring protocol (also you are lieable in case something bad happens).   We use transformator at ever light, or if they are close together we use a transformer for a set of light, because there is just a limited way you can send DC without losing voltage.  The cable we use is rated for in wall installation and doesn't need pipe. It has a PVC coat with silicon filling and the individual wires have another PVC coat. You can even put it in drywall without special protection."
electricians,3dfo22,theredkrawler,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:40:54 2015 UTC,"There is one (hehe..) thing that I think is worth pointing out.   Most of Europe uses TN earthing system where the neutral wire is grounded at multiple locations of the network (at the transformer and at multiple points along the line) which ensures 0V potential of this wire at all times, therefore two-pole breakers (that disconnect neutral as well) are not necessary and are actually rarely used (to be honest, I've only seen them in catalogs :p ). In this system all the grounds are bonded to neutral at the main panel or at the meter so it doesn't really make sense to disconnect neutrals as they have the same potential as ground anyway (and any switching on grounds is strictly prohibited). As far as I know US and Canada with their split-phase system are categorized as TN by the IEC as well.  There are some exceptions on this field. For example, in Norway they use the IT system (although it's being replaced with TN in new construction). AFAIK France is one of those exceptions, too. They particularly like to use the TT system. In TT, the neutral wire is only grounded once - at the transformer. Because of that there is no certainty that it's potential will always be 0V (simple voltage drop on the line will cause it to be a few volts over the ground potential) so it's reasonable to use breakers that disconnect the neutral wire in order to make the circuit entirely de-energized. TBH that is not absolutely necessary (there are many TN countries that still have some areas with TT system, although the notion is to completely rule it out at some point, and switching neutral is not mandated there), it's just some additional safety feature that the French decided to introduce.  Anyway, grounds in this system are not bonded to neutral at any point. They are all connected to local grounding system (rods or metal underground structures) only. Unlike in TN, ground fault currents are very low because the resistance of grounding system being very high compared to the neutral (often too low to even trip a 10A breaker) in TT so RCDs (GFCIs) are necessary in all circuits. RCD (GFCI) is considered to be the most unreliable switching device (I heard statistically 10% of them don't work properly after some time) which makes fault protection based almost entirely on that quite dubious. Because of that in TT there are often at least two of those devices used to lower the risk of failure - one is installed on the main feed and protects the entire wiring and the other one (or multiple ones) protect individual circuit/group of circuits. The first one has this slight trip delay while the others trip instantly - that provides selective coordination. Also the ""main"" one is a 100, 300 or 500 mA version instead of typical 30 mA models used for extra protection."
electricians,3dfo22,g-ff,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:14:10 2015 UTC,"There is no special protection for sparking and or arcing besides what the material already offers,    Okay, Canada and the US have just implemented arc-fault protection over the last few years and will continue for the next decade, for general 15A and 20A circuits (not dryers or stoves or wet areas, roughly)   but if you install a new panel you have to thourougly check the whole installation with a certified meter   We do some testing, but I know for true that most electricians don't properly meter everything, they just test for 120V receptacles and make sure the lights come on.   also you are lieable in case something bad happens   Here also.   We use transformator at ever light, or if they are close together we use a transformer for a set of light, because there is just a limited way you can send DC without losing voltage.   Yeah, voltage drop is real, and could kill the energy savings from using LED in the first place.  Sometimes I think the transformer should go at the switch.   The cable we use is rated for in wall installation and doesn't need pipe. It has a PVC coat with silicon filling and the individual wires have another PVC coat. You can even put it in drywall without special protection.   Okay, we usually bundle our in-wall-rated nylon wire into a cable and pull that.  It's called NMD90 by spec, and for residential we typically see 2 and 3-wire (we ignore the ground when we count)"

Yes it's the role of the GFCI (the 2 big breakers you can see in first place of each line) How are those wires brought to the load? Pipes? As my german colleague says, we have flexible PVC coated cable (R2V) wich have 3 or more wire in it that you can use without installing pipes.

I've had the best experience with Kohler so far but honestly, I haven't had a lot of warranty issues with Generac either.   My biggest beef with Generac is their load shedding system versus everyone else using an actual load management system. They actually boast that they allow the generator to be loaded to 100% capacity, and then your AC compressor tries to start? Of course the frequency crashes after the throttle is pegged and the engine starts to stall, meanwhile a surge is sent through everything in your home. This all happens in a second or two, and repeats every five minutes the entire outage.   Load management measures your actual power usage in amps with CTs and knows it doesn't have the headroom to start that AC if your sitting at 75% load already. No surge, no stress to the engine, it just waits until you turn off some stuff. Much smarter."

Pretty common to see that configuration in industry, and it also depends on how the indicator is wired. Directly off the supply? Off the isolator auxiliary contacts? Off the contactor auxiliaries?  Wouldn't hurt to add a live line indicator, very common to have multiple levels of indication.

electricians,3dgd09,td8189,3,Thu Jul 16 01:35:06 2015 UTC,"This may or not be helpful or correct... but in my local we have two programs: a residential and a commercial program. The ""R"" program takes several years with some school and then you get a lower pay rate than the ""A"" journeyman. The ""A"" program is the actual apprenticeship and you get paid pretty well to start, and get GOOD pay increases until you make scale.   The question is how long do you want to be a helper? If you are looking for a year or two, bust your ass and get into the apprenticeship. Make friends, show up to union meetings, SHOW UP TO UNION MEETINGS, and be a happy productive face in your company. I worked with a guy who was happy, helpful, generally pleasant, and everyone wanted him to get into the apprenticeship. He got three letters of recommendation from journeyman/ foremen and he didnt get in.   If you want to get far, make friends at your company and be a face at the union hall. (Meetings... not to sign the books)."

Did parallel 100ft runs of 3x500mcm in 4"" like 3 weeks ago, each run had 3x 90s and a back to back 45 about half way through to kick the pipe up about 2ft going around one of the corners. Me pulling with a tugger and 2 guys feeding, each run only took like 5 minutes of pulling. As long as you properly lube and have a tugger of sorts, pulling mains is usually pretty easy."

electricians,3df9dp,Davidsseeds,10,Wed Jul 15 20:28:05 2015 UTC,"You should call a pro in to look over the entire house. If you found knob and tube in one box it probably exists elsewhere too and someone may have done just enough to cover it up. You may want to look at legal options against the seller if the house was represented as being rewired. Unfortunately many home inspectors are incompetent or careless and do not catch things they really should.   Also, if you are hanging a fan the box needs to be rated for fan support so it does not rip out of the ceiling and fall on your head."
electricians,3df9dp,matchtaste,7,Wed Jul 15 21:06:05 2015 UTC,"Upvoted this because it's important.  Also, would suggest calling your homeowners insurance.  If there was any mis-representation from the seller, regarding the knob and tube, the insurance company will have a field day with it.  Friend bought a 100yr old house a couple years ago, the sellers claimed full rewire with new 200amp service.  In reality, it was just a service change, with the basement switched over to romex.  Everything in the walls/ceilings was still knob and tube.  His insurance handled everything.  I believe they took the seller to court, but I do not know the details.  They basically ripped down all of his walls/ceilings, did a complete rewire, hung new drywall, painted...and it didn't cost him a cent."
electricians,3df9dp,notTomHanx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:03:15 2015 UTC,How would I go about finding if it was misrepresented?
electricians,3df9dp,jimjazz1414,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:16:42 2015 UTC,"Well, you bought the place. Did the seller claim that it had been rewired / all k&t removed when you bought it?"
electricians,3df9dp,jimjazz1414,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:37:52 2015 UTC,No they didn't. The seller had purchased the house and flipped it. From what I can tell there is newer (unsure of age) romex coming out of the breaker and up into the disaster of plaster that is my basement ceiling. However when looking at the wiring in the wall and outlets it appears to be K&T in some rooms whereas others have something newer but not romex.   Of course none of this was discovered during the housing inspection.
electricians,3df9dp,notTomHanx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:01:27 2015 UTC,"That's common, knob and tube ripped out of the basement but still existing in some of the harder to rewire rooms. Sometimes it's a dishonest seller who wants to hide the K&T, but I think more often it gets replaced with romex in the basement because exposed K&T on the ceiling is prone to damage and is also kind of hazardous."
electricians,3df9dp,jimjazz1414,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:49:51 2015 UTC,That's what it looks like to me. The house was foreclosed on and then flipped by the seller. I'm not sure what electrical they completed themselves vs. what was left from before. A lot of the rooms are still plaster walls and ceilings so I doubt a lot of the wiring in the walls has been updated.
electricians,3df9dp,Encryptid,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:48:28 2015 UTC,"Just called the friend I mentioned earlier.  He said he was lucky. He still had the MLS listing that he had printed out, and in the description they used the words ""full electrical rewire"". He gave a copy of that to his insurance, and they took it from there.  I imagine there was more documentation involved, but he said he literally didn't have to do anything else."
electricians,3df9dp,robstoon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:41:22 2015 UTC,I do know that part. I thought there might be a box but there is not. I pulled out the old fixture (heavy) hoping there might be one. I noticed the wiring and stopped. Haven't gone any farther yet.
electricians,3df9dp,robstoon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:31:10 2015 UTC,I assume you have plaster and lath walls and ceilings. Someone with experience in plaster and old wiring shouldn't have a problem cutting a box in for you. Typically a box like this does the trick with very little plaster patching required.
electricians,3df9dp,jimjazz1414,2,Thu Jul 16 02:46:04 2015 UTC,"We deal with this all the time, and I agree that you should always replace K&T if you have the means.  Usually with original K&T wiring there is no outlet box either. The practice was to simply nail a 1x6 on the flat, between 2 joists, and drill 2 holes (for the hot and neutral to stick out of). They used a heavy cloth insulator to protect where the wire passed through the board. Later, the light fixture was simply screwed through the plaster into the 1x6. Totally against code today."
electricians,3df9dp,jimjazz1414,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:36:56 2015 UTC,"My first floor has knob/tube wiring that has 2 hot wires coming into the outlets and no neutral. I thought the upstairs had been at least replaced since a majority of the wire going into my breaker is newer romex wiring, but it seems I still have some K&T throughout the house."
electricians,3df9dp,lordsamiti,2,Wed Jul 15 20:40:06 2015 UTC,It won't be two hot wires. One of those will be a neutral.
electricians,3df9dp,Eglitarian,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:19:48 2015 UTC,No. They are both hot. One is supposed to be neutral but they are both hot.
electricians,3df9dp,Eglitarian,2,Thu Jul 16 01:31:29 2015 UTC,"That can't be the case unless the outlet is 240V. (Or they're both coming from the same bus bar in the panel, in which case they would have the same voltage and the outlet wouldn't work at all.)"
electricians,3df9dp,lookatthatsquirrel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:32:45 2015 UTC,"Sometimes both wires will seem hot with K&T because they both light up your tic tester. In reality, one will be the neutral. Not sure why K&T acts this way, but I've seen it happen a lot."
electricians,3df9dp,duckquil,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:40:28 2015 UTC,They do both light up. I've plugged in a lamp and tried to turn it on but the lamp will not work on the outlets in question. And yes the lamp worked fine on other outlets and no it is not a switch activated outlet.   So what would cause the tic tester to show active electricity but a non-functioning outlet?
electricians,3df9dp,lookatthatsquirrel,2,Thu Jul 16 02:57:58 2015 UTC,"My go-to method for sorting out which wire is which, is to plug an extension cord into a known good romex-wired outlet (that is, with ground, and correct polarity). Drag the female end of the cord over to the K&T wires in question. Then meter between the cord end and the K&T. For example, if with one probe in the neutral slot of the extension cord and the other on one of the K&T wires, you read 0V... and then you switch to the other K&T wire and read 120V... then that first wire is a neutral and the second one is hot.  Then you can troubleshoot as usual, pretty much like with modern wiring.  But if you don't know how to ""troubleshoot as usual"" - perhaps call a professional."

electricians,3dgzc6,grndnl,2,Thu Jul 16 04:55:41 2015 UTC,"Typically, you can connect the incoming hot to up to 5 other wires and each of those to up to 5 wires. Same with the neutral.  But YMMV. Follow the rules. And ask yourself about U/L listings."
electricians,3dgzc6,Jim-Jones,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:14:06 2015 UTC,"First - you are absolutely right. If an electrician was wiring together 14 hanging lights, that would be a proper install.  However, that picture has 14 bulbs, so 15 wire pairs. 2 Busbars or 10 wire nuts. 5 wires each, done by a novice. And I bet the maker is going to want to tinker with it some after installing, which is so much easier to do with bars."

I did OK and got a letter saying ""in 2 years we have an opening for you! Congratulations!"" I thought huh... thats cool but I was expecting an a go or no go, not a wait.   I did the interview and they asked a TON of questions about stuff I had no clue about. I didnt feel like I knew how to answer anything correctly and probably didnt do well at all.  My life changed and I was getting job offers in another state where I could be a helper the day I moved. So I moved. The second I got down to my new state I went in and applied there and they said I needed to test and start the process that way. I asked if by chance they would take my test from the previous JATC and they said they would look at it. I got a call saying they were happy with that and set up an interview.   I went in for the interview and there were 3 people and they all asked easy and friendly questions. About 10 minutes later they gave me a positive response and told me there would be a letter in the mail. Two weeks later I had the letter saying I was in. Two months later I was in classes for my first year. I had a job as a helper at that point in time anyways.   I discovered later that the JATC was expanding in that area and needed to fill 300 seats and was making it pretty easy for anyone qualified to get in. I was lucky. I was REALLY lucky.

electricians,3dfb8t,chance_cummings,2,Wed Jul 15 20:41:05 2015 UTC,You need a full-wave rectifier power supply.  What's happening is that you're seeing the flicker of the 60hz power supply.  Buy a crappy set of christmas lights and you'll see the same problem.  The problem goes away because you're seeing 'pure' DC when using the battery.  See this article for more information: http://blog.1000bulbs.com/what-are-full-wave-led-christmas-lights/
electricians,3dfb8t,djpyro,2,Wed Jul 15 21:27:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this. A cheap rectifier often lacks a capacitor which means that it's only putting out power for half of a period of time (since AC alternates direction 60 times a second in NA). Full wave bridge rectifiers have a capacitor in there that stores a slight charge and supplements the times where the rectifier is putting out 0vdc."
electricians,3dfb8t,Eglitarian,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:49:49 2015 UTC,Thank you for responding!  Searching for Full wave bridge rectifiers brings up what looks like components that go onto additional equipment.  Is this right?

electricians,3dfb8t,Eglitarian,2,Wed Jul 15 22:32:04 2015 UTC,"Nah, the fwbr should be part of the power supply (its inside of the brick itself, after the transformer and before the adaptor). Just shop around for a 24vdc power supply specific for LED lighting and see if there's any additional details that might reveal if it's got one in it. Maybe check a local electronics hobby shop."
electricians,3dfb8t,djpyro,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:49:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the help!  Do you know of a good full-wave rectifier power supply?

I think maybe this is what you are suggesting... http://www.electricbargainstores.com/product-p/Lutron-UPP-120H.htm?gclid=CMa9t9aS3sYCFc5lfgodjbkIGA  or maybe this...  https://www.google.com/shopping/product/4995548978035340541?sclient=psy-ab&biw=1920&bih=979&q=full+wave+rectifier+power+supply+24+volt+dc&oq=full+wave+rectifier+power+supply+24+volt+dc&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.&tch=1&ech=1&psi=KtmmVfSjGcPooATrzrbQAw.1436997950950.5&prds=paur:ClkAsKraX__VfsHYkyIwJrmpXbNB5XJZ8gfnaDC4WbXwijQyumZYg1yqOojWa52_HYgQenv_xnyQU31FTTNKSXv6F8IqrnfGpCgo79Wn5PmJCyBdaJV9qew9KxIZAFPVH72vhodPxl3q97NzijIv_Tr_kB820A&sa=X&ved=0CPkCEPMCMA5qFQoTCKD35s2S3sYCFVZ9iAodLIMKyg  or maybe both would work in my specific case?  Also, probably a dumb question, but I use this in place of a power supply not in addition to, correct?"
electricians,3dfb8t,djpyro,2,Wed Jul 15 22:13:39 2015 UTC,"I should have looked at your power supply page a bit closer, they link to the actual spec sheet.(https://www.1000bulbs.com/pdf/magnitude-m60l24dc-ar-specs.pdf).  The little square of diodes (marked D1) is the bridge rectifier.  So you are seeing both sides of the wave and you have a full wave rectifier.  What's missing is the smoothing capacitor.  You can either replace the power supply with one that has a capacitor across the 2 outputs, or you can wire one yourself."
electricians,3dfb8t,djpyro,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:06:41 2015 UTC,"Awesome!  Thank you for explaining this.  If I'm looking for a diagram with a smoothing capacitor, would it be a symbol that is part of the square of diodes or just before it?  Also, is D1 going to change when a capacitor is in place, or will it remain a D1? I found this power supply... http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/260/PWM-90-spec-357441.pdf I looked at the diagram and didn't see the square of diodes with the D1.  I did notice the output of 300Hz though.  Could that solve my problem?"
electricians,3dfb8t,Jim-Jones,2,Thu Jul 16 02:42:23 2015 UTC,"The capacitor would be between the red and purple wires on the output side.  It will look a bit like this.  That power supply you are linking to may work, but it won't be dimable like you think.  There is an input voltage, output voltage and a separate pair of dimmer wires.  Look at page 6."
electricians,3dfb8t,ithinarine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:46:06 2015 UTC,"I had noticed that difference before and was trying to redesign the setup to make up for that difference, but didn't want to buy a power supply unless I was sure it would work.  If I bought a capacitor and soldered it between the two output wires, this would smooth the flow?  Can you suggest a capacitor that might be best for this application?"
electricians,3dfb8t,ithinarine,2,Thu Jul 16 03:54:03 2015 UTC,I think for safety you're best finding a different transformer.  The same company that made the one you bought also makes solid state ones.   It looks like 3287-24V may do what you want.  You'll want to use it with one of these dimmers.

electricians,3dd5yo,fcisler,2,Wed Jul 15 15:22:33 2015 UTC,Although one bonus is that you can have your TV on a surge protector you can get to.

Some ballrooms have Skyhooks installed in the ceiling that drop down and a bar can be slid through, then you can hang lights for a stage wash on them.  After that you feed the power into a female Edison plug which are installed on the ceiling (stupid place in my opinion because gravity could case them to fall out) and then on the ground there are the plugs you have (male Edison) and from there you can take an extension cord into a dimmer rack so that the stage wash can be dimmed through DMX on a lighting console.    Tldr: In professional corporate av these can be used as installed extension cords"

electricians,3dec3v,Sambarge,2,Wed Jul 15 16:38:10 2015 UTC,"Had my interview in May.  Questions are the standard ones you've seen. They asked me eight. How did you hear about our program and why do you want to be an electrician? Tell us about a time you started and completed a project? Tell us about a time you set and completed a goal? Do you have any experience in electrical or construction? Do you believe you'll be prepared to work in a physical environment such as this? Why should we hire you? (And two more that I cannot recall.)  They're going to bring you into a boardroom where you'll sit at the one end of a long table, the interviewer at another, and up to eight judges typing away on computers wordlessly between you two. Be cool, make eye contact with everyone at some point, and if you talk with your hands, keep them under the table. It'll only take 10-15 minutes, so make sure you say what you want to say.  I was scored a 96, ranked third on the list right after a class was pulled. Since then, I've dropped to 32, which means they have had some top-notch candidates lately (I assume). Really want to get in, surprised my rank has dropped so much (even though hundreds are on the list), and lucky to have a cozy job while I wait."
electricians,3dec3v,sloof70,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:23:55 2015 UTC,"Six or so dudes in a room, one will ask you questions. There will be about six questions (plus or minus one, hard to remember). Basic stuff: Tell us about yourself. Tell us about a project you did start to finish. Tell us a project that challenged you. Etc. Ask you a few questions about small spaces, heights, if you have any problems. The last question actually threw me a bit: ""When you leave here, you will be ranked and put on a list. Tell us why you should be number 1."" I BS'd some answer, but it was the only one I wasn't really expecting. The other ones are pretty standard.  All told, interview took 10 min or so. I didn't feel like I did super well, but I was dispatched two weeks later. So there's that.  Good luck man!"
electricians,3dec3v,Xhentil,2,Thu Jul 16 00:04:02 2015 UTC,"I remember similar questions, including the last one. I wouldn't worry too much. We need apprentices pretty bad right now, so if you got the interview, you probably got the job."
electricians,3dec3v,I_Makes_tuff,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:57:52 2015 UTC,"I am in Bellevue and moved here recently with the idea of doing an apprenticeship.  I was looking at CITC here in Bellevue.  Is there a better route that you could suggest for someone interested in the residential side of things?  I currently hold a leadership position within a 12 volt career, and understand very little may translate, but I feel like I could work my ass off and enjoy it within the Electrician field."
electricians,3dec3v,common_tater,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:21:47 2015 UTC,"CITC is the go-to for non-union apprentices. People tend to be strongly in favor of one of the two paths (I'm not one of them) but that's something I would research before starting.   Keep in mind that residential journeyman make about half what commercial (01) electricians do. I've done both and I don't miss residential at all. It's easier and faster to get your license, but those are the only up sides I can think of. Some just prefer the work and aren't as worried about the money. 01 electricians are licensed to do residential and low voltage work as well, so you could always go that route after your apprenticeship is finished if you don't like commercial work, and you have much more flexibility if you feel like a change. Not quite as easy if you go the union route as you don't really get to choose where you work, but you typically earn more and have better benefits.  Let me know if you have more questions."
electricians,3dec3v,I_Makes_tuff,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:53:30 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate your insight.  I'm sure I could ask many questions, but I'd best not bother you and just do some more reading here and elsewhere online.  You make a great point on 01 versus 02, never really put two and  two together to realize 01 would be qualified to work on all three levels.  It's becoming a balance of what to sacrifice and for how long versus reward and a wage worth working for.   Either route it seems I'd be taking a 33% + pay cut. Residential seemed the quickest way to get my hands dirty and work my way up into journey level work.  It is logical to go back, if even for a cost, as a residential guy to reclass as a commercial guy?"
electricians,3dec3v,common_tater,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:07:13 2015 UTC,"It is logical to go back, if even for a cost, as a residential guy to reclass as a commercial guy?   It can be as long as you are logging your hours with the state, which you want to do anyway. Typically L&I will give you credit for a percentage of your hours, up to 2000 of the 8000 required, but no credit for school hours. You may, however, be able to challenge out a couple years of school,  but that won't be easy without a commercial background.  I was an electrician for 6 years in the military and marine before I joined the union to get my 01. I got 2000 hours of credit but still had to finish 5 years of school to get my license. Still worth it for me."

He marked out receptacles and switches and the notch for their height, circuit positioning for each load (A1, A2-5 [3 lights at the sw], A6, etc.) all in one pass.  After that he'd drill every hole but one or two per house, including the feed routing.

The boss is a good guy and will hum and haw about the costs of things, but at the end of the day just prefers to see good workmanship since that goes further with customers and builders than getting a house finished by noon (especially when the plumbers spend 4 days doing their thing).  You can somewhat avoid this by working for resi companies that specialize in custom homes or larger builds where speed usually takes a backseat to quality, or just looking around at the companies in the area, and who does a good job.

We never use the greenies, on the duplexes and 4-plexes we are currently wiring, we don't even put a disconnect on the water heater and furnace, the wire is just stubbed through the sheetrock on the ceiling.

electricians,3dbrp4,microwavedbulb,2,Wed Jul 15 02:27:56 2015 UTC,"If you have good access to the room directly behind where the panel sits in the wall, go out and buy a single gang low voltage cut-in ring and a single gang blank plate that matches the color of your plugs.  Get a sheet rock saw and cut out a single gang hole at the same height as the rest of the plugs in the room (so it doesn't look out of place) directly below where the panel sits outside.  Once you have the wall open, you can drill a  1/4"" hole out the stucco on the other side and now you have a good place to fish your grounding electrode conductor down from the panel and out to the ground rod.  Gob some silicon around the ground wire after you've made your connections.  For bonus points, instead of grabbing a low voltage cut-in ring and blank plate, go get a single gang cut-in box and a plug and run a circuit down to the plug along with your ground.  Now you've got a properly grounded system and an  extra plug instead of a useless blank plate!"

electricians,3dbrp4,Jim-Jones,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:20:45 2015 UTC,"Not that I can tell. If it IS grounded, then bonding point is inaccessible. It's possible that it's a ufer ground, and the bonding is hidden inside the wall. There are no ground rods near the panel, or anywhere on the property.   I haven't opened the panel to see if there's a ground wire. Just wonder how I would do it in case I do need to add ground rods.  I'm not home, so no pictures now.

electricians,3dbrp4,2dumb2knowbetter,2,Wed Jul 15 02:06:20 2015 UTC,pulled off cover this morning. There is a ground wire exiting the bottom of the panel. Safe to assume it is grounded properly on the other end?  There is also a 2nd ground wire exiting the top of the panel. Tried to trace it and I think it is bonded to a nearby gas pipe. Gas and electrical comes into the house in the same area. The hot and cold water pipes are bonded to the gas pipe at the water heater about 20ft away. Is this adequate? Or does the water pipes have to bond directly to the panel?
electricians,3dbrp4,almost_a_troll,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:11:25 2015 UTC,Mid 70s.  My understanding is that the clamp connecting to the rebar would have to be accessible if it existed. Is that right?

electricians,3d9lhq,Jim-Jones,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:27:00 2015 UTC,Probably if it's that bad. But I just don't want an amateur tackling this. It's like letting them clean up burned wires.
electricians,3d9lhq,love-broker,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:45:48 2015 UTC,I'll agree there.  Again burned wires and cleaning up don't mix.  Burned cut out is more like it.
electricians,3d9lhq,danielcc07,4,Wed Jul 15 01:48:12 2015 UTC,Hey OP no one has mentioned this but I would contact the manufacturer of the breaker. Counterfeit breakers are become pretty popular and it looks like that might very well be one. The manufacturer would be very interested in this.
electricians,3d9lhq,lordsamiti,2,Wed Jul 15 03:32:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not an electrician, but is that breaker even designed for that panel?"
electricians,3d9lhq,horceface,3,Tue Jul 14 16:24:51 2015 UTC,"Yes it is. You can see the indent in the bus just below that breaker that allows it to accept tandem breakers. That being said, the other breakers look like older ITE breakers and the tandem is a Murray. Siemens owns both companies now but still makes the Murray line as well as their own Siemens brand stuff. In my experience on the sales side, Murray is a junk brand that they bought to sell in lumberyards. Much like square d homelike panels or cutler hammer ""br"" series stuff.   Replace it with an ITE tandem breaker. If the bus is burnt when you remove the old breaker use the space right below it. It looks good."

electricians,3d9lhq,lcgsd,2,Tue Jul 14 23:18:05 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, this arcing could be because someone put in a used breaker (highly likely that this was added later, after the original install, hence it being a different breaker), which I've seen shitty electricians who keep old stuff for that. If that's the case, then the connectors that clamp on the buss bar could be worn/rusted, which would cause excess heat and the almost melted look that the breaker has on it. That's why an inspection of the bussing should be done to see what caused this."

Then move the lamp and see if turning it on trips a breaker.  Nonetheless, sizzling noises from your panel is normally worn out bussing, which should be replaced before it starts a fire. If this is a rental, contact the owners/management and tell them. If they do nothing, move."

electricians,3dazuw,vindicat0r,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:43:17 2015 UTC,"Just to be sure, if you turn off the switch manually, does the light turn off?  I ask because if you short maestro dimmers, they tend to stay stuck in the on position.    Also, what type of load are you putting on this? This is a no neutral switch and incandescent only.  If you have LED bulbs then it will likely stay on for ever.  If not, the only other thing to do is switch it to less sensitive.  I've never had any issue with Lutron motion sensors.  Their logic is better than the others."
electricians,3dazuw,coogie,0,Wed Jul 15 02:14:34 2015 UTC,"I install those exact motions in every pantry for every house we wire for one of our builders. I have had it one time where I had to replace one because it was just randomly turning on from no motion and staying on permanently, there is always a possibility of a manufacturer defect.   When you are holding down the buttons to change time out settings and sensitivity and such, you have to press and hold for sometimes 10 seconds before you see the light flash, and then about 5 more seconds for each subsequent flash to go through the 3 settings.  Also note that those things are CRAZY sensitive if they are at the highest setting, which I think is default anyways. Lots of houses we do have a walk through pantry from the garage entrance to the kitchen, and you don't even have the door opened more than 2 inches and the light is on. Also, every time you go and look to see if it's turned off, you are activating the motion again and resetting the count down."

That you may end up doing a lot of manual labour for the first couple years of your apprenticeship, and also you should know to take it seriously and always listen to what you're told and try your hardest to learn.

The union guys ""usually"" earn more then non union and get pention and ""usually"" better benefits.  *Not always though. I made more than any union member I ever went to school with and had a pretty comparible benefits package.   How do I go about looking for a Non-Union job?    Apply, apply and apply. Drop off a resume in person to every contractor in the phone book. Also try electrical supply houses as a way to learn parts and get your foot in the door.

Nope, an apprentice is someone who has been indentured and has a journeyman signing off on hours for them. You simply say you are looking to start an electrical apprenticeship.   What are the typical costs with apprenticeship? (If company doesn't pay for anything)      Tools, depending on what you buy. School depending on where you live. When I went to school (in Saskatchewan) it was $300 tuition for the 2 months each year. Also a code book for school, which is $200 but good for up to 3 years. Other than that there are not many costs.   Anything else should I know?      Don't get discouraged if you don't find a job right away, keep on trying. It took me 200+ resumes to get my first job. Make sure you show up to work 10 minutes early every day and never just stand around, always ask what you could be doing next when you finish a task, this shows initiative. Do your best and remember that everyone fucks up sometimes. Also make sure you know what a wire stretcher and a bucket of ohms look like, you'll be sent to retrieve them quite often."

Also should know about the schooling cost, there's hidden little things like paying for parking at trade school (my local school charges $200 for the two months), and being able to account for not being paid for 2 months straight (EI helps, but it comes through in Ontario basically right as you finish school :/) which is more of an issue if you live on your own and have car payments/rent/bills/food etc.  Also, don't let asshole journeymen get you down. There's some cool guys out there in the trade that will be willing to take 5 to 10 minutes of their day to teach you something new, but there's always one out there who has insecurities and will verbally and mentally abuse you relentlessly just because he feels entitled to it with his license."

electricians,3d8rv0,TheGrillSgt,2,Tue Jul 14 11:45:01 2015 UTC,"This power strip type of surge protector is usually nothing more than 1-3 simple varistors, maybe a choke. It will  (maybe) protect your stuff from small surges that come from performing switching actions on quite large induction machines (which are usually not present in low-voltage residential networks) and those induced in your wiring from lightning strikes (on condition that they don't strike too close). Unfortunately, if the strike's too close the surge will be too strong to be successfully suppressed by this (quite primitive) circuit.  There are SPDs (surge protection devices) that offer much better protection but they certainly don't cost 10 bucks. It's also important that they are a part of the entire surge-protection system - that, for starters, includes surge protector installed at the electrical panel and the other ones protecting data and cable lines. The way your power and data cables are arranged in the walls is important as well. Quite an interesting subject but it's complicated too..."

They keep the analogue and digital signals separate allow them to use the same line without interference.  Most homes that were wired for phone were set up for two line any way.  You will have to talk to your service provider to activate the second line, a simple service they use to be very proud of.  I would add the phone line splitter between the phones and the DSL filter and leave your modem connected where it is."

I want the phone to receive calls when my existing system receives a call, basically use them interchangeably.   As for the router, the technician took Cat5, plugged it into the phone line in my office, and then he split the single Cat5 into DSL and phone at the router. (Think of a Y)   The router used to be at a different location in the house before I moved it to my office. At that moment old location the technician took a wallplate and installed two quickports which were Cat5 sockets that I believe separated DSL and Phone, the technician that installed the router in my office just used a single cable to have less clutter presumably.   Is that what I should do? Split the line coming into office into DSL/Phone before it leaves the wall?   Would this be easier if I just ran a cable from the next room over or find a powerline adapter?"
electricians,3d8cik,vetgamers,2,Tue Jul 14 15:19:23 2015 UTC,"If you want to add a second line you will (last I did this) have to add a cable from your Demarcation box (telephone box outside that goes from telephone company to customer equipment) to the places you want the 2nd line or see if you have a pair of cables free in your existing wiring.   You probably have a pair of cables free in your existing wiring, unless your building is really old.   If you have 4 pairs of free wiring in your telephone cabling the first line ""should"" be white/blue & blue/white, then to add a second line it would use the white/orange & orange white. If you only have three pairs it ""should"" be red & green, then the second line is black & yellow. If you only have 2 pairs the first pair is green & red and 2nd is black & yellow. Reason I explain this part is most phone companies will charge you to ""hook"" up a 2nd line inside so this could save you some money if you do this before activating a second line. They'll still charge you an activation fee outside but it's better to save a little especially how expensive adding a new line to existing service is. If you don't want to swap out your 1 line jack for a 2 do what /u/Basoran said and get a line splitter. It'll do the same thing just in line or at the jack itself.  As per what /u/Basoran said DSL filters are needed to prevent noise bleed over from digital to analog service. It can be really bad in some houses with older/shorted wiring.   Note: Sorry if I don't have this written with proper grammar, I have not waken up fully yet."
electricians,3d8cik,Jim-Jones,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:53:41 2015 UTC,You can get a splitter added to the incoming phone system to split the incoming line into voice and DSL. Then run the DSL over a separate pair and pick it up where needed. That way you don't need filters.  Two phones should be OK these days. Multiple handsets on one base station usually add no more load.

So, a couple of follow-ups:   I take it that the screw doesn't actually ground the fixture, just makes a good place to put the grounding wire, and The ground screw would take the place of one of the two bracket screws that will secure the new bracket to the ceiling box?"
electricians,3d6rnr,dennington111,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:18:11 2015 UTC,"1) My assumption is that it's for reference; like the color coded wire.   Black - hot; white - neutral; bare - ground.  No matter what by taking 1 look at it you know what's its used for; even if not exactly what it's doing.   However, I've read something about them not being 'rated' for someone else's application in this subreddit, so they may serve a much more complex purpose, so I'd advise NOT to stray from ground screws for a cheaper or easier fix.  2) There should be ~6-8 holes in the box. The ground screw DOES NOT take the place of the bracketing screws; rather there are thinner holes specifically for the ground screws."

electricians,3d79t1,Jim-Jones,2,Tue Jul 14 13:37:37 2015 UTC,"Pragmatic opinion from an electrical engineer that worked as a commercial electrician for 8 years: More than one component has failed. The circuit board costs about $70 to replace. Damaged resistors are a sign of under-valued (cheap Chinese) parts, and definitely point to other parts having failed. I would like suspect one of the triacs (Q7 - Q12) has failed. I'm not sure where the comparator is on that board, but I doubt there is one. The 16-pin IC is probably a PWM, and the 8-pin IC is a 555 timer. It likely provides a reference frequency to the PWM and controller (the large IC). Q1 looks damaged, but I'm not sure if it's heat damage or just scratched. The PCB doesn't look overheated at all, though, so it's probably random component failure.  I know the fans look nice, but remember this the next time you're shopping for fans. Just like appliances, these are overly complicated with elaborate electronic components that are prone to expensive failures. Meanwhile, millions of capacitor-based 3-speed fans have been running for decades. When they fail, you can replace the capacitors for less than $5."
electricians,3d79t1,TK421isAFK,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:39:39 2015 UTC,"To elaborate, this is the board, I think the problem would be with one of the comparators. But I tested one of the resistors (see the green ones on the far left) and it reads no resistance, when I believe it should read 3000 ohms. However it shouldn't just burn out unless there was to much power, and if it did there would be infinite resistance. So I'm thinking it's probably a comparator, but how do I test comparators? Any input on troubleshooting this board is greatly appreciated, thanks in advance."

Your colors don't get so mixed up. When you cut the outer jacket, do it more neatly.  You seem to just slice, pull to the side and cut.  A better way is to score across the wire, slice and then pull. What is that neutral splice in the bottom left going to do for you? Measure how long you need wire to be after pulling, and before you start stapling it back.  This way it's going to be long enough and not too long.  Have a standard measurement for all your loads and it'll easy even."

It does look sloppy I was just trying to get it done quick(working in Texas heat is brutal)   But for the colors I did do it that way it's just with using the arc faults and combo breakers I have to do the white the same time as my hot since it goes to the breaker then down to the bar"

electricians,3d5dz9,Eglitarian,2,Mon Jul 13 21:22:18 2015 UTC,The rule is it cannot be used as a j box so a line in and out through the panel. But splicing for a breaker is 100% fine. It obviously doesn't look good and may be frowned upon but some circumstances leaves this way to be the only option without lots of Sheetrock damage which we did not get the approval for.

electricians,3d5dz9,Smoke_Stack707,-1,Mon Jul 13 17:48:00 2015 UTC,A little over an hour.  Edit: this was the trim out guys I didn't mount and strip it in over the course of an hour. All I did on it was put in the breakers and put all of the neutrals from the arc faults/combo gfci breakers. You can tell in the picture it is already at the trim stage of a house.

electricians,3d644q,chrisims12,3,Mon Jul 13 20:38:18 2015 UTC,You should really splice them and just land the one wire on the screw. Stab backs stink and cause fires. Also whoever wired the switch originally did a horrific job at landing the wires   EDIT :Oh wait. You landed the wires. You need to fix them. Make a proper hook and place the whole hook under the screw. The direction the red wire is bent is the correct way. Just get it all under the screw.

electricians,3d644q,robstoon,3,Mon Jul 13 21:20:18 2015 UTC,"One of them is going the wrong way, should be clockwise. And the wire should be in a much tighter U shape so that the screw makes proper contact with it."
electricians,3d644q,areyouwithairfrance,2,Tue Jul 14 01:29:05 2015 UTC,"Always wrap the wire in the direction the screw turns, clockwise."
electricians,3d644q,spirituallyinsane,2,Mon Jul 13 21:33:23 2015 UTC,"You should not use the switch as a splice.  It's just asking for trouble.  Cut a piece of black wire about 8 inches long, and splice it with the other blacks that you need to connect together.  Make sure you strip the wires to the proper length for your chosen connector.  Do the same with the bare copper, using a bare copper wire. Once you have the extra wires added, tuck the bare copper wires into the back of the box, then the black wires.  Use the extra wires that you added to connect to the proper screws on the switch.  I don't see if there is a ground screw on the switch, but it needs to be connected if it's there.  Bend each wire in to a small U shape in the same direction that the screw tightens.  The whole U should fit tightly under the screw, with no insulation under the screw.  The insulation on the black and red wires should begin just after the screw, and you should not have any bare copper showing on the black or red wires past the back of the switch.  Do it correctly now, so you don't have to figure out why it doesn't work later.  Bad connections lead to sparks, which damage the switch and wires, and present a fire hazard.  Side note: Try not to cut the wires in the box any shorter.  You already have barely enough wire to work with.  You're supposed to have 3 inches of extra wire beyond the edge of the box, per the National Electrical Code."

If someone came to me asking to explain basic ordnance safety or what an explosive train is, I'd tell them to get lost a lot less politely than you have here. I've spent the past 6 years working to a high degree of mechanical ability and accuracy, and everything I know about electricity is making sure that current doesn't get to the rocket motor before it's actually time to make a boom. The failure modes that I'm used to working under are 'get is wrong, everyone in the building is dead, and 10 million + is down the drain'.   You sound like you know exactly what kind of job it is and I appreciate your help, I guess my fear is that I'll mess this interview up because I didn't show the initiative to learn the basics of what I'm getting into before I go to this next round of interviews.   Based on the contract start date, the hiring date, and what I've garnered from the HR department interviewing me, I wouldn't be going anywhere alone for about 6 months while I'm brought up to speed on what I need to know. I'm going to be honest with these folks, but at the same time, I want to show that I have the potential to be the tech that they want when the contract starts next year.   If you could look at that information and point me in a direction of 'know this, so you look like you can be trained' instead of working from the assumption that I want to go onto the floor with a youtube diploma and a false sense of self confidence I would appreciate it."

I work on a lot of gear, well into the high voltage range, and in many plants the equipment with the highest incident energy--the biggest arc flash risk--are the 480V distribution circuits.  You did work with ordnance?  Think of a severe arc flash as a bomb:  It has the potential to not just kill the guy who put his hand in the wrong spot, but the people behind him, the people across the room from him, and in one case I heard of, the people who were out of sight around the corner.  That's how much energy can be released by a fault.  That said, I agree with /u/ACDCbaggs :  Between now and the time of the interview, you're not gonna acquire enough power knowledge to impress somebody who knows what they're doing.  And if you acquire enough knowledge to bullshit someone who doesn't know what they're doing, you just run the risk of being put in over your head, which could be very unforgiving.  Read up on 3 phase theory if you're interested.  If you're an aerospace/military guy, I really recommend Basic Electricity by the Department of the Navy.  It's an old book, and some of the equipment is definitely dated, but the theory is really solid and it's short money.  Be honest, show enthusiasm, express an eagerness to learn.  A good shop will work with that, and you don't want to be part of a crew that won't."

I completely agree with the idea that I'm not trying to pull the wool over anyones eyes I just want to show that I'm a lump of clay worth molding.   I've seen arc flash stuff in some of the safety courses I've taken over the years. Ordnance safety has a lot to do with electrical safety, and frankly I have a healthy fear of electricity for what I know it can do alone, and for what it can do in combination with the ordnance I used to work around. Hopefully as a line tech I'll be calling a real electrician when there's a problem with the service, but I understand that there are inherent dangers around working with 480V. I get that it can kill a person. I hope that you can understand that as a motivation for why I want to go in with my eyes open, and that I really don't want to fool anyone into thinking that I know more than I do."

Despite claiming during his 2014 reelection run that he had no interest in advancing so-called “right-to-work” legislation designed to weaken private-sector unions, Walker jumped at the chance to sign a “right-to-work” law earlier this year.  The man who in 2012 said, “I have no interest in a right-to-work law in this state” in 2015 declared that he had always been a “right-to-work” enthusiast and that signing the law “sends a powerful message across the country and around the world.”"

electricians,3d7ck3,oregon_potential,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:39:06 2015 UTC,I was in Georgia last year working residential. It being a right to work state makes it difficult for wages to be higher in the construction field. The only guys that I saw making a lot of money were the owners of the contracting firms that subcontracted work out to day laborers.  I understand your want to be in the construction field after a bachelor's degree. I have a contact out there for the IEC and if you're looking for residential work I may know someone.   Edit: Resi work sucks compared to industrial :/

I would personally use a box in the ground though.  2 splices is 2 places something could go wrong in the future, and with splices, you don't have access to fix them easily.  A box is all your joints in 1 place, and if anything goes wrong, it's accessible to fix."

The Box above is good, get the direct bury wirenuts and youll be fine. For commercial we would use this box the size of a fish tank, it was made of cement and some sort of fiberglass, PVC pipe into the bottom, and use regular wirenuts but then we would tape them. I think thats the average... Use the box above, UF cable and make the splices in the box with the direct burial wirenuts and you should be fine.

electricians,3d5ksg,JohnProof,2,Mon Jul 13 19:43:19 2015 UTC,Possible to make your splice  in the pole base or is it sealed in concrete?  If you use an in-ground box just make sure you put a deep gravel sump under it to try and prevent it from filling with water.   Also don't worry about trying to tape-up splices; that's rarely effective at keeping water out; just use waterproof wirenuts and call it a day.

You might want to start by contacting the power company and see if you can obtain their standardized/generic install drawings.  I've run 2 1/2"" sch 40 PVC for power, and 1"" for each low voltage system.

electricians,3d52n1,microwavedbulb,0,Tue Jul 14 01:10:23 2015 UTC,"Probably not for the low-voltage services, but a run that long is likely to have cross-talk. I'd keep them at least a couple feet apart if possible."
electricians,3d52n1,TK421isAFK,0,Tue Jul 14 04:48:38 2015 UTC,"The total distance of the run and keeping the different systems apart are two separate issues, neither of which are crosstalk... Crosstalk is when the signal transmitted on one pair of cables or circuit creates a problem on different circuit or pair of cables. This is not a total distance issue, or a space between systems issue, and more of a handling, installation, and termination problem - twists in the cable, too much of the cables untwisted, too much of the jacket removed, general sloppy routing of the cable pairs at the punch down or jack.   I think what you're looking for is EMI."
electricians,3d52n1,IrishDemon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:29:46 2015 UTC,"No, I'm talking about crosstalk. Crosstalk is the radiant absorbtion of a signal from a propagation device. The larger the propagation device (antenna, long unshielded wire, or untwisted pair, among others), the greater the signal strength. Bad, unshielded connections commonly cause this kind of interference,  but they're not the only points of concern.  Signals diminish in a logarithmic pattern from a source. Therefore, the closer a transmitter and receiver are to each other, the stronger the signal - aka interference.  Crosstalk is a form of electromagnetic interference."
electricians,3d52n1,TK421isAFK,2,Wed Jul 15 01:26:41 2015 UTC,"I think we agree, just not on the naming, but maybe it's a regional thing. Maybe it's what people call it your area, not sure. I've always heard, at least locally, that crosstalk comes from problems within the cable assembly, while EMI is from an external problem. Yes, they're both forms interference... My apologies if limiting a specific set of issues to one name might have made it appear that you didn't know what you're talking about or that your answer was wrong. I had mistakenly assumed that most people working with tel/data called these types of cabling issues crosstalk and outside interference was called EMI.   At any rate, keeping his conduit a couple of feet apart isn't really necessary. A 110/220 volt single phase with a neutral max 200 amps only needs inches at most. If done with a single trench, say a 12"" bucket on the back hoe, and have the power on one side and the low voltage on the other."
electricians,3d52n1,IrishDemon,2,Wed Jul 15 02:49:47 2015 UTC,"You're right about it depending on the area. In the San Francisco Bay Area, we have a lot of problems with signals carrying through and reflecting off of highly conductive soil. A lot of soil arould here contains high levels of salts.  It's not so much a problem anymore, but up until about 10 years ago we saw a lot of interference from radio stations. The RF carries through power lines and soil, and we could even pick up stray radio signals coming in on isolated power in clean rooms and inside Faraday cages. We probably have it a lot worse around here and take a lot more precautions. Until ClearChannel bought almost every radio station in the area, we had something like 800 licensed commrrcial broadcasters within 50 miles of San Francisco."

You would need to get a 20-amp 2-pole breaker (with the handles tied) instead. This will cause the loads to ""cancel each other out"" on the neutral, so the most that could ever be drawn would be 20 amps.  If I were you, however, I wouldn't use a MWBC with aluminum wiring. The tendency for aluminum connections to fail could leave half the receptacles with 240 volts, which would destroy most equipment plugged in."
electricians,3d4rjk,FishPumpkin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:11:55 2015 UTC,"These days, the code requires two 20A GFCI protected circuits for kitchen countertops. If your fridge is modern, you likely don't need a separate circuit for it.* 10AWG Al. is approved for 20A.   Like iamaelectrician said, move the black and red onto opposing phases in the panel, directly above/below each other. Use a breaker which will disconnect BOTH circuits at the same time. I would also wire nut copper leads to the aluminum wire for the final connection at the receptacles. I have seen too many (thankfully most were small) fires started by aluminum wiring connected directly to devices, as it will loosen up over time. You want to make this connection with approved Al/Cu wirenuts, which are essentially regular wirenuts slathered with an electrically conductive anti-oxidation compound.   *Some folks don't want their fridge to trip due to a ground fault issue. To avoid GFCI protection on the fridge, place it on a dedicated 15A circuit. I find this to be a beyond rare occurrence these days, unless there is a real issue."

electricians,3d4rjk,microwavedbulb,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:47:04 2015 UTC,Are you sure they are on the same bus bar? What is the voltage reading between the red and black wire at the panel?
electricians,3d4rjk,robstoon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:23:33 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Took the breakers out and you could see them connecting to the same bus bar (even though they are directly adjacent in the box).  Its an old split-bus breaker box.  Here is are photo examples of how the outlets were wired that show the guy who did this had no clue what they were doing.  https://imgur.com/a/NEoGG  Photo #2 shows how they converted the aluminum to copper inside a junction box hidden behind the drywall (that's another story I didn't feel like getting into).  Ignore the hand gesture.  There were a total of 3 of these hidden junction boxes in the wall. This was supposedly done by an ""electrician"" the previous homeowner hired.  I know this because I asked a neighbor about it and they had made the mistake of hiring the same electrician.  Photo #1 shows how they wired the outlet from the hidden metal junction box (I'd already re-done the metal junction box in photo #2, hence the single romex cable comming out of that one).  Thats 2 romex cables.  One just has a neutral though (pulled other strands out?).  The ""dual-neutral"" just goes back to the metal junction box and are all joined together in a big wire nut + a lot of anti-oxidizing gel.  ""What the fuck?"" was my general reaction.  Luckily I've see a lot of the other wiring in my house and none of it looks like this."
electricians,3d4lzv,squarezero,2,Mon Jul 13 14:07:12 2015 UTC,"A couple things could have happened.  First, a ""surge protector"" is usually just a small resistor that can't handle anything near the intensity of a lightning strike.  Second, if lightning struck a nearby pole, it may not have sent the surge down the power lines.  We recently had lightning strike a pole nearby a customers house.  The  surge traveled down the ungrounded cable lines and fried every piece of electronics in the house.  Turns out Comcast had never properly bonded their system to the power system, so the shielding on the cable lines became energized.   If you want true isolation and actual surge protection, check out Surgex surge eliminators, they have a few videos that show what they can actually handle, as opposed to the power strips with a resistor in them that offer very little actual surge supression."

If the cords are too short to install a new cord cap, you'll need to open the device and replace the cord. Make sure the gauge of the new cord is the same size or larger than the one you're replacing, especially on something with a heating element. You'll also want to keep the new cord the same length as the cord originally was if you're using the same size wire. Finally, SO and similar cords are named based on how many conductors are inside the jacket, not like Romex.

electricians,3d44d0,mmm_burrito,-1,Mon Jul 13 23:39:16 2015 UTC,"Most industrial work, at least in my experience, is troubleshooting. You don't put locks on unless you actually need to touch stuff.  Of course, you always keep one hand in your pocket when you're doing that, on top of appropriate PPE. Leaning into a cabinet with one hand on the door is a great way to send current through the heart if conductors somehow hit skin on your working arm."

Today, I spent probably more than three-quarters of my ten hour day picking up ty-rap tails and bits of plastic wrap off the floor and generally tidying up.   Why?  Because I'm still the low guy on the totem pole.  Because somebody has to clean up and most of the time, that person is me.

electricians,3d1qlh,itguy336,18,Sun Jul 12 20:31:32 2015 UTC,"I would not accept this installation.  The removal of the receptacle would interrupt the grounding continuity.  Article 250.148(B) of the 2014 NEC states that ""the arrangement of grounding connections shall be such that the disconnection or the removal of the receptacle, luminaire, or other device fed from the box does not interfere with or interrupt the grounding continuity"".  The installation is dependent upon the screw terminal maintaining the continuity in the grounding circuit."
electricians,3d1qlh,hysteresis123,3,Sun Jul 12 22:53:22 2015 UTC,Excellent point and the reason why I hate those crimp things. The home builders cut the ground wires so short it was impossible to replace a box without re-running the wires. I'm not going to make it more difficult for the next guy anymore than I have to.
electricians,3d1qlh,6matguy6,2,Sun Jul 12 23:45:59 2015 UTC,It's possible both conductors were wrapped around the ground screws (2 screws) in the box. I would hook end one of them but I mean it would keep the integrity of the circuit.  Edit: read more comments and this install was in a plastic box.

electricians,3d1qlh,lookatthatsquirrel,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:28:32 2015 UTC,I completely understand that but isn't the code written to be overly extreme. I mean the term removal could mean that the outlet is ripped out in a huge brawl and in that case all grounding wires may come apart.  then again it's probably written to force people to do things certain ways in anticipation of worst case scenarios which could arise by someone being stupid and removing an outlet that disconnects the continuous ground
electricians,3d1qlh,lookatthatsquirrel,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:53:15 2015 UTC,Code is written as a bare minimum.  We do above the bare minimum. You are looking at it the wrong way.  Your POV sounds like you want to do just up to the code.  It wouldn't be legal then.
electricians,3d1qlh,lookatthatsquirrel,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:50:13 2015 UTC,I think your misunderstanding me. I want to do it the best and safest way possible. I was just curious as to how the code is written. It seems like people interpret the code as either an absolute or intention. FYI: I am using screw nuts for the ground connections.
electricians,3d1qlh,horceface,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:01:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess I did.  Most of us learn how it is written and get taught a center way to interpret it.  The bare minimum is the absolute, we have learned ways to go above and beyond that absolute.  You can use a green wire nut and have one wire shorter than the other.  You could get a scrap piece of 14 and have 3 wires under a tan wire nut or you can use a bare copper butt crimp and cut one shorter.  Anything will be an improvement from what is existing."
electricians,3d1qlh,JohnProof,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:02:02 2015 UTC,"That is one thing that drives me nuts. I try to use red wire nuts for hot, white/tan for neutral, and green for ground. But I can never find them in the sizes and colors I prefer. While I'm at it is there a color standard for wire nuts outside of the min/max specs for wire guage capacity?"
electricians,3d1qlh,horceface,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:03:02 2015 UTC,Nothing standard other than preference unless you have too many wires.  Check the packaging for the size and number of conductors per wire nut.
electricians,3d1qlh,hawkens85,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:20:44 2015 UTC,Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't that article talking about ground screws. Meaning if you unscrew the outlet from the box you cannot lose ground continuity? As long as one of those two wires is hooked and screwed to the back of the box I don't see a problem
electricians,3d1qlh,RICO12X,2,Mon Jul 13 12:25:41 2015 UTC,"The idea is that the box can ground the device but the device cannot ground the box.  If the equipment grounds are not bonded to the box prior to terminating on the device, it's not code compliant."

I won't come back till I'm a registered apprentice. It worked out in the end for me. Don't get walked on!"
electricians,3d093b,Zakraidarksorrow,2,Sun Jul 12 15:18:12 2015 UTC,"Uk sparky here.   Looks like they had you on for cheap labour and not much else. The best way to learn from stuff like that is to show interest in what certain blokes are doing, the guys who look like they've been around a while, ask questions and pay attention. Look stuff up online and i assume you're doing your 2330 part 2/part 3 at the same time so that should help, the 17th edition regs is a good course to get on as it helps you in how to read the  regs book and where to find stuff, a lot of employers are looking for it now. Also try and apply for a 2394 and 2395 course for testing but only when you feel comfortable around the equipment. Best way to learn stuff is getting on as a electrical mate with a larger company. Where abouts are you based? Best way to get in somewhere is to just get as many certs and passes and stuff under your belt and use a bit of blagging, especially on your CV."

My journeymen have taught me to: Drill holes, pull wire, bend conduit, run flex, make joints, wire smoke detectors, hang/wire can lights, wire panels including circuit breakers... And the even a decent amount of work on live circuits once they figured out I wasnt going to buzz myself.  Point being, my journeymen teach me what the NEC dictates, why, and show me how to do it once. Friday, I spent 3 hours in an apartment with a punchlist of what two bedrooms needed.

electricians,3d1k5l,Jim-Jones,2,Sun Jul 12 19:56:18 2015 UTC,My vote is no. Usually when the support bar goes across the center so you can't run the wires through that knock out. Then they only ran 2 wires to the box. A ceiling fan will get a 3 Wire most the time.  You can get a ceiling fan old work box to replace that box. Without experience it will be very difficult. With experience it's just frustrating sometimes.
electricians,3d1k5l,boytyperanma,2,Sun Jul 12 19:59:17 2015 UTC,"Not rated.  If you have access to the area above the box,  a 2x4 secured to or above the joists with the screws holding the yoke of the fan mount going through the box and in to the wood. If you don't have access above the box, a remodel fan box/brace combo should fit through the space that the fan canopy will cover if you're careful when you cut your old box out. The mud ring for the existing box looks deeper than a 5/8"" or 3/4"" raised ring, though. What is your ceiling construction,  and how thick is it?"
electricians,3d1k5l,IrishDemon,2,Sun Jul 12 21:24:09 2015 UTC,"That box is not rated for fan support.  It will need to be replaced with one that is.  There are a few different models that are approved, and have different uses, including retrofit models(I do not recommend the retrofit models).  The safest way to do it will depending on the construction of the building.  In order to best determine the proper action we would need to know what it looks like behind the box.   Take a hammer and knock a few holes in the wallboard.... just kidding...  Basically it will depend on the framing.  If it is wood, a retrofit style box will work, although I do not trust them.  If it is not wood, the wallboard will have to be opened up to securely attach a rated box to the structural framing/concrete."
electricians,3d0lhv,HitTheTwit,9,Sun Jul 12 14:35:49 2015 UTC,Accidentally touching the neutral to the ground can cause the breaker to trip.  That may have been all that happened.

electricians,3d0lhv,Xurples,6,Sun Jul 12 17:50:35 2015 UTC,Your neutral isn't switched and carries the return from other items on the circuit. Upon the contact between the ground and neutral the AFCI will notice a sudden change in the load on the neutral and kicks the breaker. This is how I understand it at least.  It is used to protect sleeping quarters from electrical faults that can result in fire.
electricians,3d0lhv,Radar_Monkey,2,Sun Jul 12 18:25:35 2015 UTC,That's it exactly... and it's in a bedroom.  Thanks!
electricians,3d0lhv,Jim-Jones,3,Sun Jul 12 19:00:41 2015 UTC,"An older AFCI will trip ground to neutral without a load as will a GFCI. The new combination AFCI breakers won't trip like that without a load on the circuit. So even if the fan switch was off, something further down the line like a tv, lamp, or clock will let the breaker trip."

When I got my reward box there were a few business cards with job offers written on the back, but they weren't anything special. Just a few companies who donated the gifts. It was more fun than anything. And I got to make my dad (master electrician) and instructor proud. I'm not sure what the 1st and 2nd place winners got. I could've done better but I was extremely nervous and most of the other guys had competed during their first year to get a feel for it and came back for round two ready to kick butt."

But if you pair it with a related Tech Diploma or Associate's/Bachelor's, it will basically vouch for your work ethic and quality by itself, which is huge in it's own right.  I had a lot of dirty looks from coworkers (since the average age of them was 50) when they saw this 20 year old having the same job as them. Then a year later I caught a major flaw in a piece of flight hardware that slipped through testing, which saved the company tens of millions of dollars. I got recognition from my manager's, manager's, manager's, manager's, manager; also known as the Vice President of our program.

I quit after my first year to work for a contractor from Texas doing commercial work and from there I went to work on a wind farm here in OK. I actually got out of electrical a few years ago. I currently work as a PM for a GC. We have a good contract with the FAA doing GC stuff and we also have a nationwide contract building new RTR's at airports."
electricians,3cwwoi,trevzman,21,Sat Jul 11 14:15:09 2015 UTC,Sometimes I wish guys on this thread would just mention what the problem is. I don't have much patience.
electricians,3cwwoi,gottspeed,18,Sat Jul 11 17:59:27 2015 UTC,"this a Federal Pacific panel. Their panels were recalled because the breakers were faulty and would cause fires. After the first trip, the breakers would be stuck in the closed position permanently thus no more over current protection. There were class action lawsuits. They went bankrupted and are no longer in existence. If you have a Federal Pacfic panel, it is highly recommended that they be replaced."
electricians,3cwwoi,thatotherguy321,3,Sat Jul 11 19:16:36 2015 UTC,"There was never any official recall of FPE panels. Basically, at one point the company was sold and then the buying company sued the selling company after they found out that FPE had been using fraudulent practices to get UL listings on their products."
electricians,3cwwoi,robstoon,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:51:15 2015 UTC,I thought it was actually due to the fact that they didn't properly tin the spring inside the breaker so it would actually get welded.
electricians,3cwwoi,whiteout82,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:19:06 2015 UTC,that could be it. I can't remember exactly what happened internally. But the end result is that it's stuck on and there's no protection.
electricians,3cwwoi,thatotherguy321,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:34:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think that was what caused most of the issues, anyway. The biggest single problem seems to be that the common trip mechanism in the double-pole breakers was flawed and would often jam and fail to trip on a single-pole overload or short. The single-pole breakers also failed unusually often, though."
electricians,3cwwoi,robstoon,2,Mon Jul 13 04:15:00 2015 UTC,"I think they must be a lot less common in the states, because you find them in every other older house built in Canada before Federal went tits up. Really popular here.  That's why I was like ""Federal? Big whoop get back to work..."""

electricians,3cwwoi,ithinarine,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:09:54 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. The newer breakers (likely starting sometime in the 80s) seemed to be designed differently, but the old ones from the 70s and older seem to be basically the same as the Federal Pacific breakers I've seen pictures of from the US and likely have the same issues.  It seems like you can tell them apart from the feel of the handle movement. The old 70s-style ones had a very stiff, clunky handle mechanism, the newer ones have a much smoother handle action. (Likely the stiffness of the mechanism on the old ones was part of why the damn things jammed on overload so much.)"
electricians,3cwwoi,robstoon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:16:26 2015 UTC,"FPE from the same generation is also shit. Same sticky breakers, same non-sensicle bus-bars, same weak ass product."

We are specifically instructed to never open these because the breaker/ inner cover design trips the breakers as you remove it. Also the metal on these are REALLY soft and a tappit can strip a wide open hole if you torque it just a little too much. All around a poor design and yes they do fail closed."

Sure enough, a 50 amp breaker had a loose switch and was welded to the bus bar. That was my first encounter with a Sylvania (Zinsco) panel.  I told him to get that switched out, but he doesn't want to spend the money. Oh well."
electricians,3cwwoi,kdesu,2,Sat Jul 11 21:08:54 2015 UTC,"I know Zinsco can be just as bad as Federal Pacific, but I didn't know that Zinsco was Sylvania.  What about other Sylvania panels that had more standard-sized breakers, and didn't say Zinsco on them anywhere?  Were they OK?  The house I grew up in was built in 1980 and had a GTE Sylvania panel, and it always seemed like good quality to me.  The house wiring was terrible, but the panel itself seemed good."
electricians,3cwwoi,ShoulderChip,3,Sat Jul 11 21:40:37 2015 UTC,"I think there was more than one style of Sylvania-brand breakers. I had an old apartment that had a Sylvania panel that definitely wasn't the Zinsco style. (And I know they did trip, because at one point some guys working on the block heater outlets in the parking lot apparently figured it was easier to just short all the circuits to trip the breakers than going into every suite to turn them off..)"

electricians,3cxf9s,Aperron,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:39:31 2015 UTC,Twisted pair wasn't always the standard for residential telephone cabling.  I would say the transition happened sometime in the late 80s/early 90s.  Typical 2 pair station wire is untwisted and has that same color code.  The RJ11 line cords from the phone to the wall is still untwisted and has the R/G Y/B color code inside.

One thing that always seems to come back to haunt people is lighting and switching. Think about if you want ceiling fans, or if you will at some point want ceiling fans, because running a 14/3 and installing an appropriately rated box will save a lot of headache later.  Recessed lights have become standard (at least in my area) for lighting most non-bedroom areas. However, most rooms will still have a hanging light for decor purposes.   Also think about what color the walls and floor are going to be. If you have dark tastes then you will want more lights. Think about the placement of furniture, you don't want lights glaring off of your TV.   Think about what ways you will be entering hallways/public rooms for 3 and 4 way switching.   Avoid fan controls on AFCI circuits (also, every living area needs to be AFCI protected, not sure how often AFCI's are used in Commerical/Industrial). It's not that they wont work, but we've had a lot of issues with fan-controls tripping AFCI breakers.   Low voltage LED-strip lights are pretty popular for under cabinet lighting, make sure you have a spot for a transformer if you go this route.  A lot of this is stuff you probably already know, but there it is, just in case."
electricians,3cwy0h,Conditionofpossible,4,Sat Jul 11 15:50:42 2015 UTC,"I went to some interior design lighting seminars as an apprentice. A lot of good that did because I'm in mining now lol.  Was told that a black kitchen needs 50% more lumens than a white kitchen. I would believe this one after building some custom homes where the customer changed inside decor and suddenly the kitchen seems really dark. Also, if you don't have under cabinet lighting, you have to be wary of shadows on your counter.  Don't put the recessed lights too far away from directly above the countertop because of a shadow created by you onto the counter. It something that I found annoying with other people's designs. Usually I can forgive bad lighting in other areas of the house, but not the kitchen.  That's where work gets done."

electricians,3cwy0h,ithinarine,2,Sat Jul 11 15:29:58 2015 UTC,200 amp is in already
electricians,3cwy0h,DjEclectic,2,Sat Jul 11 16:52:20 2015 UTC,make sure you read section 26 in the CEC. the last half governs all your usual residential wiring code.     put in more coax and cat 6 then you need. you can leave it in the wall to be fished out at a later date if you want but it sucks when the wife wants to move the furniture and you dont have a tv outlet on the other side of the room. media panels go in almost all homes these days and it allows for such an easy time with moving around your data needs. please get one.  potlights look cool but they suck for area lighting. i would suggest a bit more built in lighting than you would initially think you need because having to rely on lamps is a pain in the ass unless you have swithed receptacles. my house is so damn dark and its a shame that electircal is my day job and not my hobby because then i might actually want to do something about ot after work

electricians,3cwy0h,AnarchistElectrician,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:08:28 2015 UTC,I'm in Saskatoon and the smoke/co rule has already been a provincial interpretation here since last year.  The AFCI rule is going to be a pain in the ass for my boss though.
electricians,3cwy0h,coogie,2,Sat Jul 11 18:39:45 2015 UTC,"Ya, just means you end up having completely separate circuits for lighting and outlets. Definitely changes how you wire, but oh well.

electricians,3cwy0h,Jim-Jones,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:23:50 2015 UTC,"It kind of depends on how involved you want to get.  I deal with custom homes where every inch of the wall space is accounted for - ie. art work, stone overs, trims, etc.  As such, most homes I've dealt with have lighting automation so all you see is a keypad on the wall rather than two rows of 4 gang switches.    If you have a simple house, with two or 3 switches in a room, just go ahead and wire them traditionally and if you want lighting automation later, go with Radio Ra 2 or another wireless system (RR is the best retrofit system for smaller houses I think).  You may need to get trained by Lutron first though.    With lighting, you may want to get with your local lighting supply store (not Home Depot), and have them design a lighting plan for you.  Or just hire a lighting designer.  Maybe they'll charge you for it or maybe the salesman would be nice and come and give you his advice.  There is certainly an art to lighting which from experience, many electricians don't ""get"".  You have to deal with color temperatures, angles of the beams, height of the ceilings, etc. Then you have art lighting vs. general lighting vs. task lighting.  It can get quite involved.  This is an area where I would not skimp.  Get the good fixtures like those made by Cooper Lighting or Lightolier. you'll always find parts for them later and they have higher quality transformers and sockets."

electricians,3czfoe,CPerryG,0,Sun Jul 12 17:01:59 2015 UTC,Maybe put a box near panel with a contactor controlled by a switch. You just want to flip one switch for all lights ya?

There is no salary, you'll get paid hourly. Nor sure how much in your local but probably  $40+ a hour. You'll get health insurance and pension credits in your apprenticeship. Work all depends on the economy. It's pretty good right now, at least here in the midwest. 5 years ago it was shit and people were waiting a few years to get back to work. The aptitude test is pretty easy, brush up on algebra if it's been a while. Also expect to take a drug test. Hair follicle is a very good possibility."
electricians,3cxhen,youareahomo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:15:41 2015 UTC,"Drug test isn't an issue. $40 as a journey man, can't be that much as an apprentice?"
electricians,3cxhen,youareahomo,2,Sat Jul 11 18:48:16 2015 UTC,You start off around 50% of journeyman wage. So around $20 a hour. Typically goes up every 6 months until you top out.

You will be paid for your apprenticeship and having a college degree will probably help get your foot in the door. You will likely start at 40 or 50% of journeyman wage which is probably around $40 an hour in your area. You will have to do 8 hours of school 30 weeks a year (you will either go to school at night or one weekday a week). You will have full health insurance and start on your pension but this make take 2 or 3 months to start.  As for your last questions, being unionized, having full benefits comes automatically if you're working. Construction is cyclical and dependent on the overall economic activity your area.

electricians,3cxk76,Buadach,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:11:26 2015 UTC,"I spoke to the council yesterday and they said they would send out an environmental officer to look at the property. There's no gas safety certificate on the house and when confronted about it the landlord came up with a bunch of excuses, outright lied, and told me it was my responsibility to get that sorted (I know it's absolutely not). I contacted British Gas but they couldn't tell me anything or send somebody out because the account has lapsed due to non payment. I'm trapped in an awful situation now but I was desperate and have been told my neighbours that the landlord usually targets vulnerable young women. It looks like he's a professional con artist but he's also a firefighter, so that's why I believed him when he said the house was safe. The electrics are possibly the main problem with the house but there's a lot more I didn't know to look for. I've reported him to the HSE for not having safety checks done, as well as speaking to citizens advice and Shelter, and fully intend to fight this. I'm hoping to get out of the lease as he's in breach of contract. Thanks again for the info, I really appreciate it."

The work was always available but they only called me if they absolutely needed me. I never said no if they called but, they understood that if I was being called shit was going to get done. I had a reputation at that point for not stopping and, a reputation for efficiency. ( yes, I had people call me a shoppie/rocket as a first year apprentice)  The number of hours you work is really based on your local and company. I'm a training coordinator in Denver now. I worked for one of the larger contractors throughout my entire apprenticeship and as a JW.  I would say that nationwide, overtime should not be a normal thing. Overtime was originally created as a punishment for the contractor. Unfortunately construction and manual labor have such a negative connotation in our society that some areas really do struggle to fill the job calls.  If you don't want to work over time, then don't. You are NECA/IBEW brother. You can work whatever you want to work with in reason. If the contractor A decides to lay you off, contractor B will hire you."

Overtime does happen (including over the July 4th w/end just passed) but it's fairly unusual.  If I'm offered it, I'll take it.  First year apprentice wages pretty much demand you say yes, you know?...  On the other hand, I know several people in my school class are working seven tens, six eights, permanent nights and so on.  I'm sure the paychecks are good but it must be wrecking them physically.  They're always the ones propping their eyelids open in class...

I've found once we start over working our employees productivity goes drastically down so we make sure they get most weekends off unless we are running super behind on a job. A few years back when the economy sucked and I had to take every job I could so 90-100 hour work weeks were common. In 2011 I worked ~200 days straight and completely burned out.

electricians,3ctlun,BillNyeDeGrasseTyson,2,Fri Jul 10 22:30:13 2015 UTC,Depends which panel. The first one is because a retrofit light barrier was added by the OEM and they did it without expanding the panel. The second is because people have been jumping out parts of the relay logic instead of repairing it for 30+ years all on the theory when the machine goes down we will 'really fix it'.

It seems to me that most fans that have three speed settings have wires tapped in different spots on the windings.

This is my opinion: You can't fix this. The way these NYC apartments are wired you can't do anything. Turning off the freezer (how?) won't help. Deal with it as is.

They said that it is a known firmware issue that can be fixed, so we'll see what Fluke can do about that.  I do like the fact that the display does have a magnetic back.

electricians,3cstgu,Jim-Jones,2,Fri Jul 10 15:09:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. I suppose I could buy some PVC 90 degree sweeps the same diameter as the poly (1.5"") and use rubber fernco couplings to connect them. This way I could still avoid too much fishing and assemble the pipe section by section over the wires.  EDIT: I can also see now that ground movement might force unconnected sections in different directions, putting strain on the cable in a way something like wooden planks overtop wouldn't. Planks may be the easiest and cheapest route. I was hoping to keep the trench width to a minimum, but I think that's what I'll do."
electricians,3cstgu,wirez62,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:21:02 2015 UTC,I forget what depth would you need to just pipe it in PVC and pull RW90? NMWU is expensive anyways and if your are running pipe for protection at that point Id be like screw this.

electricians,3ctc8m,microwavedbulb,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:07:12 2015 UTC,"I'd start with the fixture and work backwards. Its not uncommon to ground out a wire with a screw when you're tightening the fixture to the ceiling if you aren't selective about how you tuck the wires back in the box after connecting them. Assuming you didn't pull the switch apart, that's likely where the problem is, if you have pulled the switch apart, you may have gotten a hot wire on both sides of the single pole switch and are causing a dead short when you turn it on."
electricians,3ctc8m,Eglitarian,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:09:48 2015 UTC,"With general fault finding I'd split the circuit in the middle, then again and again until you manage to isolate the fault. It could be a cut in the insulation somewhere  which is tripping the circuit. Separating all the cables at the end light fitting should give you an idea if the wiring is faulty or not.  It could even be the breaker itself if it trips with the last light still disconnected."

Article 525 is for temporary power, check that out.  Edit:  The driven rod is only required of you are feeding a panel at a separate structure. Gang boxes don't need it."
electricians,3cpyl9,kidcharm86,2,Fri Jul 10 03:12:13 2015 UTC,"Well it worked out great.  Ran the #6 to a safety disconnect rated at 60amp.  (the neutral went straight to sub panel.)  Drove a ground rod 6.5' at the out building and ran #6 from there to disconnect and on into the sub panel.  Borrowed three pieces of 8/2 SOOW w/ground 75' long from a family member and installed 3 20amp breakers in sub panel to attach them to.  And finally, wired the #6 (2 hots, 1 neutral) into a 50 amp double pole at the 200 amp main.   I appreciate you guys' concern, input, and suggestions.  I spoke with 3 licensed electricians about the ground/neutral issue and all 3 said the way I did it is the way to go.   P.S. Purchased 300' of conduit and the THHN is going underground within a week.  I'm stupid, but not an idiot :)"

If this bothers you, call your landlord. a stack/combination switch could most likely be installed to split the control of the fan and the light. Usually, both devices are wired together in rentals so that you can't take a shower without the fan running (which easily causes mold). As far as having an outlet, you should have a GFCI in your bathroom. If you don't, that's a separate issue but you can't (or more accurately shouldn't) try to turn this switch into an outlet without a myriad of problems. if it was my house, I would cut a 2 gang box into the wall, put the fan on a timer (or just a switch if you don't want to spend the cash) and the light on a dimmer. Since it's not your house, I would talk to your landlord about it. Offer to hire an electrician to set this up for you. Unless I'm mistaken about some part of this, the job shouldn't take more than an hour at most and you can be satisfied that it was done correctly. At the very least, go buy some 40w LED bulbs to stick in the light in your bathroom. You don't really need anything brighter in a small bathroom IMO"

My thoughts are this is daisy chained from the light fixture (which for whatever reason this is the first time I'm considering this a possibility).    We want to be able to plug in a night light into the outlet so we don't have to use the lights at night.    Forgive me if this is simple, I'm not a pro.

I can't tell you how many  corrections I've had to do on homes for sale that amounted to me showing up and saying that it was fine.  In the US a main panel is where grounds and neutrals are usually bonded. Sub panel grounds and neutrals must remain isolated. If the meter base is the primary source of ground (some areas require it) the main panel must remain isolated.

I would not be concerned with the installation as it is typical practice. so long as the allowable Circular Mils of the termination point is not exceeded. The (3) conductors under (1) terminal may exceed the allowable amount.  in regard to the photo with the NM sheathed cable, if this cable is unprotected under 6' then it is a code violation. it would need to be installed in PVC or metallic tubing."
electricians,3co1v3,jojoe58,2,Thu Jul 9 14:05:42 2015 UTC,"Hard to tell from the pictures but it looks right. Typically the neutral is bonded to the ground in the main panel, there are times it's done elsewhere but its less common.  Typically there is a bonding strap that looks like This, but it can also be done with a jumper.  The one issue I do see is branch circuit neutrals and grounds on the same bar, while this technically is wrong, it's not really a safety issue.  Basically, you're fine."
electricians,3co1v3,budaslap,2,Thu Jul 9 13:31:21 2015 UTC,"The trick is that neutral can only be bonded to ground at one place, usually the service entrance. Being bonded in multiple places causes problems, but you definitely want the one bond."

Some panels have a seperate bar for them but they are still connected, and others have one big bar with both of them going to it. The only issue woild be is if neutrals and grounds are going under the same lugs. Current code states that grounds can be double lugged but neutrals cannot, although sometimes in older panels you will find double lugged neutrals just because the neutral bar wasn't big enough.    Looking at your pictures I see that the issue is grounds and neutrals under the same lugs, them being in the same bar isn't a problem though. It's a code issue more than a real safety issue but you should still have an electrician come out and fix it. Not too hard to do though."
electricians,3cpno8,Asthmatic,2,Thu Jul 9 19:45:01 2015 UTC,"Cap off the yellow wire. The Yellow and Brown mean they are different circuits. The connector piece on the existing outlet is removed, meaning the top and bottom are different circuits. Kinda strange to have on a single outlet even in a commercial building. The neutrals feed through, so cap them together and put a pig tail out to the silver colored screws on your new outlet. Put another pig-tail off of the brown wires, and cap all of the browns together. Put the pigtail into one of the bronze colored screws.   So, brown is your feed into your new outlet. Yellow is not connected to your outlet at all, and is capped off inside the box. The Whites are you neutrals, which are tied into your outlet."

Then darkness. Blew every damn fuse on the ship. Took weeks to get all the lighting back on.

electricians,3clzqb,FishPumpkin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:37:21 2015 UTC,Higher resistance means you're going to have a voltage drop across the joint when current is flowing.   Voltage drop times current gives you power...

electricians,3clzqb,ahugenerd,3,Thu Jul 9 02:40:49 2015 UTC,"If the load is resistive, then Ohm's law says the current drops as the resistance of the circuit goes up, assuming a constant supply voltage to the circuit.  Therefore power drops as resistance increases.  The only way the total circuit power can rise is if the load is something like a switching power supply or electric motor that can draw more current to make up the power as the apparent voltage supplied to the load drops (due to the increased circuit resistance from the bad joint)."

electricians,3clzqb,ahugenerd,3,Sun Jul 12 02:24:22 2015 UTC,Fishpumpkin is correct.  Unless the load is a constant current source then current will always go down when a series resistance is added.   If a parallel resistance is introduced across a load (e.g. like a second light bulb on a circuit or a fault from hot to neutral) then total current increases for the entire circuit but individual loads don't have a change in current baring any voltage drop in the wire due to excessive current.

electricians,3clzqb,meetc,2,Thu Jul 9 22:05:20 2015 UTC,"Respectfully, if they have a high energy bill it could be due to equipment being miswired, but it is not from poor connections.  Think about how hot a 50W lightbulb gets:  That would be a massive amount of heat if dissipated at a seriously failing termination, and wouldn't last long without burning.  Yet, even if you had a dozen 50W lightbulbs running in your house for a month it would only increase your electric bill by ~430 kWh which would only add up to about $50."

Incandescent dimmers dim the voltage and CFL dimmers dim the Hertz.  If you have the wrong dimmer there it can cause flicker.  CFL lights has to have 120 volts at all times so incandescent dimmers can cause damage to the little ballast built into the white base of the bulb.  Hope that helps
electricians,3cm8a2,nizmob,4,Thu Jul 9 00:21:24 2015 UTC,My guess is that the governor/converter on the generator is putting out something very different than 60Hz sine wave and because the torque on an AC motor is directly related to frequency you're getting high current.  You know it's not mechanical because the problem stayed at no-load.  You know it's not voltage related because you measured it running on nominal 115V.  That only leaves frequency to check under load with a DMM or scope if you can.

electricians,3clejv,TheRealBubby,3,Wed Jul 8 20:35:37 2015 UTC,Update: I just replaced the ballast with a pl-13 ballast and replaced the mogul lampholder with a g(x) 23  lampholder and an appropriate 13w pl preheat tube. It is actually pretty bright for its wattage and will suffice until I can order an appropriate replacement fixture from eBay.

electricians,3cmoj4,almost_a_troll,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:31:52 2015 UTC,I guess.
electricians,3cmoj4,Jim-Jones,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:34:53 2015 UTC,"It is. The difference is for the 120v ones we have done, both the line and neutral are at one end, and the other is a dummy. For the 277v ones, the line is at one end and the neutral at the other.  Better stick the neutral side in first, I suppose."
electricians,3cmoj4,lookatthatsquirrel,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:22:08 2015 UTC,It really shouldn't matter.  You still only have a hot a neutral.
electricians,3cmoj4,theoldtook2000,2,Fri Jul 10 09:37:46 2015 UTC,The pins on one end of the tube are for the voltage (120 in my plant). The pins on the other end of the tube are just for holding it in the fixture. At least that's been my experience with the new led tubes we are changing over to. http://m.imgur.com/z1MbWeL http://m.imgur.com/dArazq2  We've seen the same thing here when they are inadvertently put in backwards.

electricians,3cmoj4,Jim-Jones,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:55:12 2015 UTC,"Actually, the line and neutral are on opposite ends on these 277v ones.  I like the 120v ones better, where the line and neutral are at the same end. As you said, it seems safer."

electricians,3cmoj4,CPerryG,2,Fri Jul 10 17:46:38 2015 UTC,I personally prefer to switch to a 12 volt power supply and use 12 volt LED spots but that's just me.

Unfortunately, most of them just want to reduce their bills with energy efficient lights without paying to replace all the fixtures.  All they have to do is buy the LED tube and possibly tombstones, depending on what they had. The wiring is much simpler (sure, this universal ballast will work in this 4 bulb fixture, just rewire the whole damn thing.)  But I'm with you on the LED spots. We've been trying to sell these to our residential customers. They are really nice. No need for a 12v supply, they fit in a regular 120v spot with a connector that screws into the socket."

electricians,3cmk57,Tallguystrongman,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:16:50 2015 UTC,It technically is 170 volts peak to peak. But it's 120volts RMS which is what your meter reads.  (RMS=peak to peakV x .707) x2 for the two hots in an Edison 3 wire. (Same phase). In three phase  you only really work with sqrt 3.

That panel doesnt look great, but Ive seen worse still in use so... My guess (strictly a guess) is that the bedroom has some sort of a J-box between in and the panel. It is possible that in that J-box there was something loose to begin with and the power flickering made the connection weaker. This is a guess because circuitry in a house is pretty simple and I find that its usually a bad splice or component that causes issues. It also makes sense (in my mind) that they just tapped off of an existing circuit to feed the new addition. I would shut the power off, open any boxes that look like they could go from the panel to that room including receptacles and light switches to see if anything is loose. If that sounds too hard call someone.  Oh yeah... check to make sure the breakers are giving 120V to neutral before ripping your house apart!"

electricians,3ckeb7,Jim-Jones,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:11:51 2015 UTC,"ISTR that in reality, lightning strikes up from the ground first. There's a small leader and then the main bolt follows that down (others say the visible bolt strikes back up). If that were not the case, there's be no point in putting spikes on lightning rods - a bigger target would be better. A sharp point provides an intense field more likely to spark.  But I could be wrong."

If the pylons are steel, then you may not need to do anything at all. Depending on how sensitive you are to surges, installing MOVs may be all you need. Another protection method would be to run one or two static lines physically above the live conductors. If you're having a hard time establishing a low impedance path to ground, driving rods deeper is usually the best way to account for that. Another option is to install a concrete-encased electrode. The concrete tends to hold on to moisture and give you a decent ground path."

electricians,3cj7n0,not_always_sane,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:23:21 2015 UTC,"I taught industrial maintenance classes (mechanical and electrical) here in the states. I preferred the older students and welcomed them. The young ones often were the pain in the rears to teach. The older students did their studying, were prepared in class, homework was on time, and they did not try to cheat on the tests. The college had no penalty/rules/policy against cheating. One 19-year-old tried me. It was a pleasure to give him an F in Electrical Construction when he had a 58% (minimum 60% for a D grade) and so his employer would not reimburse him for the class. Geeze, it is hard to get math questions correct when I make up 2 tests and the students on every side of him had different numbers in the same type of question and his answers matched theirs to the last decimal place. Also the multiple guess questions had the answers in a different order. BTW, the lowest grade in the class was a B+ and half earned As.  Edit: Some employers will pay for your classes and/or give you time off to attend. Look for them. Construction companies often have apprentice programs with local colleges/trade schools.

electricians,3ci7fj,polaroppositebear,2,Wed Jul 8 03:04:53 2015 UTC,"Are you asking what the source of the voltage is when the polarity is reversed in an AC circuit? Because the ""hot"" conductor is still supplying the voltage. The only difference is that the polarity of the voltage changes every half cycle. The neutral doesn't supply anything, it just provides a path to close the circuit."
electricians,3ci7fj,Russz,2,Wed Jul 8 03:38:16 2015 UTC,"Anticipating a possible answer, how can one wire be permanently at 0V in an AC circuit?   Well, voltage is always relative to something. In this case, the neutral is connected to ground at the service panel, and that's the zero reference used for measuring voltage. It's really the same as the negative terminal being used as the ground reference in a car electrical system, for example - the fact that the current alternates direction isn't really significant. There's really nothing magical about the neutral other than that it happens to be kept at approximately ground potential (approximately because just as the voltage drop in the hot wire will pull its voltage relative to ground down under load, the voltage drop in the neutral will pull its voltage relative to ground up)."
electricians,3ci7fj,robstoon,2,Wed Jul 8 03:51:44 2015 UTC,"The neutral wire is attached to the earth, via ground rod or similar (to keep it at 0V) and is also attached to one of the bushings on the transformer on the pole outside your house (to make a closed loop for current to flow).  The hot wire is attached to the other transformer bushing, but not to ground, and cycles between 120V above ground potential and 120V below ground potential.  You are not pulling or pushing charge into or out of the earth. The earth is just a reference. Yes, the circuit is connected to the earth, but the resistance of the earth is too great to carry much current at all. Your circuit loop is out of the ungrounded (""hot"") bushing of the transformer, thru your load, and then back to the grounded (""neutral"") bushing of the transformer.  Please note: current doesn't actually flow much of anywhere in an AC circuit... the constantly changing polarity means the electrons in the wires sort of wiggle back and forth."
electricians,3ci7fj,jimjazz1414,2,Wed Jul 8 03:59:25 2015 UTC,"It's not a silly question. The important fact that they probably don't bother explaining in your DIY EE guides is that voltage is not a measure of electrons - voltage is a measure of electric potential.  That might seem like splitting hairs with terminology, but it's important because you can't technically point to a thing and say ""this wire is at 5 volts"" or ""there are 60 volts there."" We say it that way because it's easier, but when you get down to the physics of electricity, voltage is an expression of the degree to which electrons want to move between two points - it requires a second reference, and although it has polarity, it is not a measure of movement or flow.  The ""hot"" wire is ""hot"" because that is where the electrical potential is coming from - - it carries both the push and the pull, take it away and nothing will move. The ""neutral"" wire is neutral because it's not carrying anything into your house. It's just a big, low impedance connection back to the source - the center point on the transformer - which allows you to complete a circuit.  In other words, alternating current doesn't mean that the hot wire becomes neutral and the neutral wire becomes hot 60 times a second (or 50, not discriminating!), and it also doesn't mean that there's no current in the neutral (there probably is). Because it is a low impedance path back to the zero point on the transformer, though, the electric potential between the neutral and whatever your pretty little feet are touching ""should"" be close to 0 volts. So we call it that.  (And just in case it isn't, we put a big metal rod in the ground as a safety measure. That's all that is, it's different than the ground plane in a DC schematic.)"
electricians,3ci7fj,unixbrained,2,Wed Jul 8 19:40:24 2015 UTC,"But, to make a circuit, you have to have a closed loop. And if you are pushing AC current through that closed loop, then in one half-cycle the current goes from hot to neutral, then in the next half-cycle it goes the opposite direction, from neutral to hot.   Right.   If the current goes from neutral to hot just as much as it goes from hot to neutral, then how can one of the lines be rightfully called a ""neutral"" wire?    Because AC describes the direction of current flow.  But for the purpose of this discussion, neutral describes the relationship of voltage on the wire when measured to earth [there is a more complex definition in the NEC but it isn't important].     Anticipating a possible answer, how can one wire be permanently at 0V in an AC circuit?   Because the earth doesn't determine the voltage between the wires, the design of the transformer or generator determines the voltage.  When you ground one terminal, you're not changing the voltage between generator or transformer windings, you're simply removing any potential difference between that one wire and earth.    No current flow occurs in that scenario because there is only that one wire connected to the earth, so there is no complete circuit.  If you ground in more than one spot, you absolutely create current flow, often undesired.  So the rule of thumb is you can ground any system at 1 single point."

Not sure if that helps but long story short look into your switch box for the light and see if you have the switch leg pushed back into the box and have the feed/line side of your receptacles being operated at the switch.

electricians,3cgwk3,lookatthatsquirrel,2,Tue Jul 7 21:50:02 2015 UTC,"Did you find the minimum wall thickness?  It is normally around 3/16. That would be added to the outside diameter twice.    I would drill the hole the next size larger so you can have room to seal the around the pipe as it comes through the concrete.  Max expanding foam, followed by some flexible caulking.    Try a 2-1/2 hole."
electricians,3cgwk3,microwavedbulb,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:55:36 2015 UTC,"Good thinking! The I.D. of 1.5"" is actually 1.59 and the wall thickness is 0.145, so  1.59 + (4*.145) = 2.17, or about 2 3/16  So a 2.5"" hole will be best.   However, I have access to a wet core drill with a 2"" bit from my brother in law. If I want to be a cheap bastard, is their anything wrong with leaving the bell end outside the foundation?

Those loose connections need to be addressed IMMEDIATELY.  I would not simply tighten the connections.  I would cut off a few inches of wire and re-terminate them.  Even that may not fix the problem.  That disconnect has been hot for some time, look at the discoloration on the fuses.  If this disconnect feeds critical equipment, I would recommend having the entire disconnect replaced.  If you decide to simply re-terminate the wires, have the disconnect monitored for a while by an infrared imaging company.  I would not recommend simply buying your own camera unless you take the time to be properly trained in on it.  There are many ways to get improper readings if you don't know what you're doing.  Source: I have been a certified thermographer for over 5 years."
electricians,3cf66e,kidcharm86,3,Tue Jul 7 14:34:17 2015 UTC,"Those loose connections need to be addressed IMMEDIATELY. I would not simply tighten the connections. I would cut off a few inches of wire and re-terminate them.   Very much agreed.  While this may have started as a simple loose connection, once they severely overheat tightening them may no longer be enough to address the high resistance.  You need to get back to clean bright copper on your conductors, and you need to burnish the lug surface or replace it in order to ensure you remove any oxidation that occurred from overheating.  There's a good bit of discoloration, so significant heat may have transferred into the switch mechanism itself:  Often the moving contact lubrication will begin to fail, and spring tension can fatigue,  and this results in more heat, so the switch may need to be PMed or just the whole disconnect replaced.  Either way, you need to either confirm a good current path by doing DLRO measurements or by doing an IR survey while it's online.  Source:  Also thermographer and apparatus tech."
electricians,3cf66e,JohnProof,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:02:55 2015 UTC,Can you please provide an explanation of what a DLRO (I'm assuming a Digital Low Resistance Ohms Meter) measurement would show me? My apologies in advance for the ignorance.
electricians,3cf66e,JohnProof,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:08:51 2015 UTC,"High resistance connections generate heat.  Enough heat causes insulation failure and will result in a fault.  A DLRO will pass a whole lot of current through the conductor and measure the voltage drop across it, then give you a very accurate resistance measurement (down to millionths of an ohm).    By looking at the overall resistance of the phases, the individual resistances of the sections (across pivots, for example) and comparing the phases to each other, that allows you to infer the condition of the equipment and will tell you what to fix and whether the repairs you've executed were successful."
electricians,3cf66e,kidcharm86,2,Tue Jul 7 22:12:35 2015 UTC,Would this be cost-effective on a 600V 400A disconnect?  It seems like replacing the entire disconnect would be cheaper at this point.
electricians,3cf66e,JohnProof,2,Tue Jul 7 22:18:37 2015 UTC,"Figure the T&M to replace that disconnect would be about $3,000.  Re-terminating and PM could be done in a couple hours with almost no materials, so it definitely could be cost effective.  The caveat is that stuff ain't designed to be repaired, so if there's damage down in the moving pivots or crimps, or the tension is really shot on any of the spring contacts, then the switch has to be replaced regardless."

electricians,3cf66e,JohnProof,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:09:24 2015 UTC,"When you say ""the cables will be tested end to end"" it sounds like you are getting insulation resistance/megger testing performed where they check the integrity of the cable insulation.     I was talking about a conductor resistance/DLRO test that checks the integrity of the current path through the switch terminations.  If they can't do a conductor resistance test, then you need to an infrared survey once it's online under load."
electricians,3cf66e,JohnProof,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:40:58 2015 UTC,That's correct. So then what would the insulation resistance/megger testing show? Would that even be helpful?
electricians,3cf66e,Uldric,2,Fri Jul 10 14:53:46 2015 UTC,"If I were doing it, I would leave the cables connected to the switch, this would prove that the cables and switch insulators had very low leakage current.  And this would demonstrate they had not been damaged by the heat.  But frankly because it doesn't appear to me that the insulation got that hot, that's a far lesser concern than doing a conductor resistance/DLRO or an infrared survey."

The panel was disconnected for the service and this is what happened:  Photos: http://imgur.com/a/qwL6d  Apparently it got hot enough to melt the metal connections in the switch. I'm really glad I had the guy out and the testing done. They tested the home run and its looking fine. There are signs it took some load and heated up but nothing crazy that would make us need to take it out of service.   The entire panel/switch will be replaced. Right now we have everything on generator power until we can get the panel replaced.   I'll keep you updated with results when the panel is replaced. Hopefully tomorrow.
electricians,3cf66e,alle0441,3,Mon Jul 13 01:01:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the update.  So the failure appears to have started with the ""C"" phase moving contact.  This is a perfect example of the value of doing thermographic inspections to catch stuff like this prior to catastrophic failure."
electricians,3cf66e,Canadian_Infidel,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:37:09 2015 UTC,"Insulation resistance would let you know whether the insulation on the cables had been compromised.  It has value, but since this thing has been running, there's no particular reason to believe that the cable insulation is compromised.  I am more concerned with the resistance through the current path in your switch because that is what caused this trouble to begin with.  I would not expect the average electrician to have a DLRO, but many can do basic infrared now, so I would find someone to check the install after it's done."
electricians,3cf66e,Htownexport,2,Fri Jul 10 17:08:52 2015 UTC,"Get a thermal imaging performed on the board. Most of the time it is a loose connection. Most main isolating switches have a torque rating that the screws have to be done up to. Might be that one phase is drawing more current than the other 2 which is the one that is heating up the board. Then again, I don't see any vents holes in the top or bottom of the panel so the heat could just be rising and not being allowed to escape."

The modern way would be to have a longer ground wire, wrap it around the ground screw on the box and then hook the end and affix it to the ground screw of the outlet.

electricians,3cchzd,JohnProof,8,Tue Jul 7 03:58:12 2015 UTC,"The only thing I can figure is that there are multiple panels of the same type and somehow the covers got removed and swapped.  I mean, for the love of god, there are even fillers over half those breakers."

electricians,3cdpfv,Jim-Jones,2,Tue Jul 7 06:20:00 2015 UTC,"As for the Lightning issue, the 240V only was a bit of a fluke. You might want to look into whole-house surge protectors.  But if the exact same circumstances were to happen again, nothing bad would happen to your range."
electricians,3cdpfv,Dirty_Socks,2,Tue Jul 7 04:29:57 2015 UTC,"I'm mostly seeing this on Canadian sites. Not clear if it's actually UL listed or not.  One reason they don't sell it in the US might have to do with the large installed base of 10-50 outlets for ranges in the US, which this wouldn't be compatible with. Range outlets in Canada are all 14-50 which this would work with. (Aside from needing 2 types of adapters, there might be considered a safety issue with adapting a 10-50 outlet with no separate neutral and ground to a regular 3-prong plug, even though stoves themselves are ""grandfathered in"" for this.)"
electricians,3cdpfv,robstoon,2,Tue Jul 7 05:03:22 2015 UTC,"As I said in another response, the device is listed and labeled through CSA (labeled for both CSA and CSA America) which is an OSHA recognized NRTL (https://www.osha.gov/dts/otpca/nrtl/nrtllist.html) devices only have to be listed and labeled by a NRTL. Nothing says it has to be by UL. This device can be sold and used in the US"
electricians,3cdpfv,retix,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:46:46 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't use a three prong version of this device, though I have several times seen 4 prong outlets that simply had the ground bonded to neutral."

They're not bomb proof, but better than nothing."

electricians,3ce1jq,lookatthatsquirrel,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:01:47 2015 UTC,"Start here: http://www.earnwhileyoulearn.org  Call for more info: (702) 452-9357  The apprenticeship is a 5 year program, but not everyone gets accepted their first time. The first class for the next school year begins August 5th. If you haven't already begun the paperwork or interview process, I don't think you'll even be considered for this year's class.   Traveling for work is a personal choice, but most apprentices don't. That has changed in recent years, but I don't think you're allowed to travel until the end of your second year at the earliest.  Our work outlook is improving, but it's not great. I don't believe there are any apprentices waiting for work, but I haven't checked recently. I think there's 900 or so on book one, but there's been a lot of calls recently for solar projects, and there will probably be more for the entrance to MGM's new arena.   If you've never been to Vegas and you've never worked in construction, you're in for a shock, no pun intended. With temps commonly reaching 111, the roof or deck temp pushes 150 degrees, and tools and material can blister skin before you have a chance to let go."
electricians,3ce1jq,IrishDemon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:02:23 2015 UTC,"That's some great info. I have been all over that website. You said 900 people on the books... Was that a mistake? 900 seems like a lot, especially to make it seem like that's not out of the ordinary. I was told that the best way to avoid layoffs was to get as many certifications as possible like solar power and things like that, can you agree? It's something I want to do, but I don't want to get into a career and be unemployed or always looking for work.  Also, if you don't mind me asking, when I called them today she said that if I were to come in for the upcoming wave in a few weeks that I wouldn't even get an interview date till next year. How long did you wait? Is it really a year or is there a possibility you can come up earlier? Because ABC says they can get me to work in a few months. But they're not a union and only get paid $13/hr.   I know that's a lot, but I appreciate any answers. Getting out of the Army is stressful enough, knowing that I have a promising career would make it a little easier."
electricians,3ce1jq,IrishDemon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:20:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it's ordinary... just what it is. I'm not going to blow sunshine and skittles up your ass and say that life is great or that it sucks - that's for you to decide.   Having certifications help, but they're not a guarantee of employment. There's one thing you need to keep in mind about this market and all construction in general: you are working yourself out of a job the minute the job starts. Having said that - I have remained employed at the same contractor since before the market crash. I haven't worked steady that entire time, but I haven't missed a mortgage payment, either. If you're a Caucasian male with no prior electrical experience, getting in a few weeks before the school year starts is difficult to impossible. There is also no guarantee you'd get in the following year, either. I don't want to mislead you or give you false hope. Most people make it in if they're determined and interview well, but just like sports, not everyone can be a winner.  The ABC program isn't really a direct comparison, especially with the huge disparity between the wages and benefits, and that prevailing wage on government projects in Nevada has recently been dealt a huge blow. Yes, they'll find work for you... but the pay rate and (lack of) benefits ratio for electricians in Las Vegas is roughly 2 to 1. The union guys get roughly twice the rate of pay and far more benefits, but most of them don't work as much currently. So, you need to choose, the possibility of steady work at lower pay rate, or probability of not working all year at a higher pay rate. As an apprentice, you should be working more consistently than a JW, but like I said, nothing is guaranteed. I got in to the union under different circumstances. I worked non-union for 10 years and then I organized in. I did this during a boom period, and I probably wouldn't or couldn't do it now."

There are probably more I am missing.  It's important to learn the proper terms so when you order parts the supply house knows what to send out.

electricians,3cadin,VictimOfReality,3,Mon Jul 6 10:24:36 2015 UTC,Im guessing the fridge isnt on a dedicated circuit and anytime it turns on to start cooling its likely maxing out the breaker it's on.
electricians,3cadin,b00j,3,Mon Jul 6 11:06:45 2015 UTC,"Does it have auto defrost?  If so, the timer will turn on the defrost heater element after a set period of time and if the element is cracked or is allowing water inside somehow, it'll trip the breaker. The fact that it is an older fridge (the heat cycling of the element can introduce cracks over time) and it ran for a while before tripping indicates that this may be the case.  To test this, you'll need to find the two wires to the element and disconnect them and let the fridge run. (There's usually a schematic on the back of the fridge) If it doesn't trip after a few days, you've found your problem.  You can either leave the element disconnected (with the wires made safe) and just defrost the fridge yourself when it needs it, or replace the element with a new one if the part is available, or go and get a repair guy out to do it all for you..."
electricians,3cadin,TERRAOperative,2,Mon Jul 6 11:13:58 2015 UTC,My guess is since the fridge was recently moved it may have gotten liquid refrigerant in the compressor. This is why they say to let them sit vertical for at least 8hours after moving. Liquid does not compress so your compressor was probably locked. They can draw up to 8x running full load current locked and possibly cause damage to the compressor. Other possibilities are the outlet has a bad connection ( unlikely since you plugged the fridge in a different location). Blowing the house main is not something to take lightly. Something is majorly wrong. Let the fridge sit for at least overnight. Inspect the cords listen for bad noises when you plug it in. Feel the compressor when it's running it can be warm but not smoking Hot.
electricians,3cadin,LT_lurker,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:13:59 2015 UTC,My guess is since the fridge was recently moved it may have gotten liquid refrigerant in the compressor.   Highly unlikely. It's fed from the condenser in back of the fridge which gets warm first.
electricians,3cadin,Jim-Jones,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:26:09 2015 UTC,"If you're tripping the main my guess is that the fridge power cord was damaged in the move and is shorting out.  I'd check that very carefully first.  Also, could be a bad/damaged capacitor on the motor."
electricians,3cadin,Jim-Jones,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:48:25 2015 UTC,I´ve heard that if you move a fridge/freezer and turn it (not alwaya keep it upright) you have to wait 24h before plugging it back in. Maybe to have the oil flow back to the compressor or something.

In construction in Van there are so many companies out there bidding against each others that at the end of the day there's no money for wages.  It's the same as the interior where I'm from.  My suggestion for a living wage is IBEW or try to get into an industrial electrcian apprenticship.  Or you could move to 'Berta.  There's no separation between construction and industrial."
electricians,3c9n6d,CozmoCramer,2,Mon Jul 6 09:17:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of what you are saying. It really is a joke with how many electricians there are here. The Union here does pay $10 more an hour but then I have to justify still being an electrician. I have an opportunity to abandon the trade and move over to Elevator Mechanic and move to a pay raise. Considering they make almost double what electricians will make (in the same area) I might consider it. Did service electrical, hated it. Ran small jobs in residential/commercial, hated that. I hate dealing with people. Now I'm in tower residential and it's terrible work/experience but it has no stress at all. Just go to work for 8 hours, and go home."

electricians,3c9n6d,mad_dawg05,2,Mon Jul 6 15:47:45 2015 UTC,"I think the most important thing about electrical is being sure you did a good job every time you showed up for work. Whereas other trades might be able to squeak by with some botched or half-ass job, electrical is not as forgiving. A carpenter might be able to fudge something a little. Same goes for the painter or sheetrocker. If you wire something poorly you run the risk of hurting yourself, others or their property. If you can hold that kind of responsibility and still sleep at night, knowing you did your best and every splice or pigtail you made up was on point, electrical is a fantastic trade. I don't find it as physically demanding as other trades. The most physically strenuous part of my job is either pulling wire through conduit or loading solar panels on a roof. I greatly enjoy this trade because it challenges my mind on a daily basis. Even rote things like rough wiring a house or making up receptacles has a certain zen to it."

I've read in some other responses that the pay is not very competitive but most of that seems to be coming from Canadian redditors. The company that took me on in Colorado is paying me very well, especially considering that I had no construction experience previously, and has me working overtime on a weekly basis.

electricians,3c9n6d,Tallguystrongman,2,Mon Jul 6 12:42:06 2015 UTC,What would you say is the difference between union and non-union?
electricians,3c9n6d,wirez62,2,Mon Jul 6 17:04:59 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that union electricians are sent out to jobs by their hall. I believe that a union company gets a job, decides how many workers the job requires and the union will send that many electricians to the site. I don't think that the union electricians are necessarily employed by a specific company. The union requires monthly dues but ensures safe working conditions and competitive pay. I think that schooling through the union is free, or at least not any extra above monthly dues, and there is some sort of retirement plan that one's dues go toward as well. The union is a somwhat democratic entity and I believe all due paying members are entitled to a vote about how the union conducts itself. Again this is based of of things I have heard others say. I have never been in the IBEW nor have I done much research on the topic so I apologize if some of the above is incorrect. Being non-union is just like most jobs. I will only ever work at jobs that my specific contractor has won the bid on. I have no say in how the company is run and, although in my case schooling is paid for by the company, schooling is not always provided by an employer. My retirement plan is a basic employer matching 401k but I have no ""dues"" to speak of. Only insurance premiums and the percentage of my check I choose to invest in my 401k. One last difference is that if you are a licensed electrician, apprentices must apply for a licences in CO at least, and you want to move across the state and you are part of the union, it is my understanding you simply go into the new local IBEW hall for you area and ""sign in"" (for lack of a better term) and they will put you to work quickly. If I move outside of the area my company conducts business, being non-union, I'll have to apply for apprentice positions and possibly could be unemployed for some time. I wrote this on my phone, I am sorry for any format or autocorrect issues."

It's a very specific skill set that they require for troubleshooting electric trucks and shovels. Granted it's a lot tougher if not impossible to get into from outside than the average place.  You have to be fuel and lube or a labourer to start.  We are a week on/week off and in camp ,which is not for everybody. I don't mind the camp because EVERYTHING is taken care of.  You go to work and it's all about work, then you go home and it's all about home. There's no need for a ""balanced"" life. With two to four work sets (weeks) of holidays you work less than half the year.  I understand that this situation is very much a bitumin bubble, and it's not the norm.

Cut a hole between the dishwasher and the sink (you should have one for a water line anyways) and install a cord in the dishwasher.  That lets you have a disconnecting means and provides power if you want a disposal later on.  I would also use MC instead of romex for better protection.

electricians,3c90m8,XirallicBolts,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:48:19 2015 UTC,Easiest way I've found to do that is use a combination AFCI/GFCI breaker. That way everything is readily accessible.
electricians,3c839w,mikemol,3,Sun Jul 5 19:57:43 2015 UTC,"Prelude:  Damnit. Put a GFCI breaker in so that I can stop putting a bunch of GFCI receptacles in, and it trips the instant I turn it on. No fault source obvious in the panel. Could be the ceiling fans on the circuit. Testing that theory. Going to have to take the breaker out either way, but this bit of testing will at least tell me if I have an urgent safety problem.  Conclusion:  OK, all good. I simply miswired the breaker. Dawned on me while I was thinking about how GFCIs work.  They work by detecting a difference between the current feeding into a circuit on the hot leg and the current coming back on the neutral. If the neutral isn't carrying as much current as the hot, then the current is flowing from the hot to...somewhere else. Could be ground, doesn't have to be. (This is why GFCI in-line with your load is a permitted remedy to not having a ground.)  I was thinking about that, and then I realized--I don't think I fed the circuit's neutral into the breaker.  Lo and behold, I didn't. Fix that, and the circuit works fine.  With that dealt with, I can now move forward and safely (and legally) replace outlets like this one with standard NEMA 5-15Rs--without a ground conductor.  edit: Said ""breakers"" where I meant ""receptacles"" in one place. To be clear, five ungrounded receptacles, three ceiling lights and two ceiling fans are now fed off a single 15A GFCI breaker. (Could have been worse. There used to be a bathroom and four bedroom all off this same circuit, ungrounded, on a normal 15A breaker. Now there are just the three rooms...)"

electricians,3c7ejl,orderofthehood,3,Sun Jul 5 16:11:18 2015 UTC,"It is difficult but learn to be ambidextrous. I did not start doing this until it was almost too late to learn new muscle habits. I use 2 trackballs at my computers, one for each hand and switch hands as needed.  Use quality large grip screw drivers. Rubber coated handles reduce the grip effort. Steel-shank hammers last forever but wood is better because it dampens the blow before it jars your hands which helps prevent osteoarthritis (which I have plenty of in both hands). Fiberglass is good also. Some wire nuts can be installed using a special tool that fits over the wire nut. Buy quality tools like pliers as tools that slip take more effort to use and tire you faster. Keep the tips on your flat blade screw drivers properly ground. I prefer to hollow grind (like for gun screws) as they do not slip out of the screw head easily so you are not expending effort pushing the screw driver against the screw while turning it. I have special modified Phillips screw drivers where I ground off the tip slightly so it nests in the screw head better so all my effort is to turn it rather than adding effort to press the screw driver into the head simultaneously. Sharp knives so you do not have to expend effort in guiding the blade.  If you have to wear a tool belt then use one with suspenders to help carry the weight. Use a wide belt also. Buy quality boots suitable for your work environment. Avoid plastic uppers as your feet will sweat inside them. New pair of boots? Keep some moleskin handy to cover 'potential' blisters because walking with blisters/sore feet will tire you faster. Watch for good arch support in your boots. Soles wear and can cause your gait/stride to develop into a sore back. Boot soles wear out so budget for replacement. I am 67 and have 3 pairs of shoes that I rotate every day so they have a chance to dry out. Fungal infections like athlete's foot irritate your feel so you expend more effort walking. Boots will make ingrown toe nails worse so consider having the whole nail removed; I did both big toes and like the freedom from pain. Resecting the nail sides only worked for a short time for me, total removal was the only solution.  When you find a pair of genuine leather gloves that fit well then buy more than one because this kind of tool is made in batches and replacements several years later will not be easy to find. Keep your own first aid kit handy. Any bleeding cut/blister should get a dose of 3-in-one antibiotic ointment as the wound will heal faster; infections interrupt your smooth actions while working expending energy. Electrical tape is not a good bandaid.  Stay hydrated. I used to laugh at the older loggers when I worked as a choker setter; they wore wool shirts and thermal underwear in the summer and I was miserable with a short sleeve shirt. I found a sweat shirt for me worked well as it would wick sweat away and then evaporate it thereby cooling me.  If you wear glasses (safety or prescription) then keep them clean. I carry my wallet in my front pocket so I do not lose it by slipping out of my pocket. Then my left rear pocket has a red handkerchief for blowing my nose or wiping my face. The right pocket has other colored handkerchiefs for cleaning my glasses. Having to squint through dirty glasses causes eye fatigue. I did a lot of work in electrical panels while on my back so I had one set of glasses where the top half is for very close work and the bottom half is computer screen distance (safety glass of course).   I may come back and add more. The electrical field, especially in industrial maintenance, has always provided a good living to me. But work safely. I walked out of an industrial plant after working there more than 11 years when the new electrical foreman damn near got me killed and then lied to management about it."
electricians,3c7ejl,not_always_sane,2,Sun Jul 5 19:08:08 2015 UTC,Instead of grounding the tip off a good phillips screw driver you could get a JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) driver. I have to use those on my old Kawasaki Motorcycles.

Learn exactly which torque setting is appropriate and remember it.  This can include wood screws for boxing, device screws for receptacles and switches, etc., but I wouldn't even try it for plate screws.  Relax your muscles while you work a bit.  Don't let stress get your whole body tightened up, it's dangerous and tires you out faster.  Some people get really tense stapling, others do it when they're pulling wire, others do it when they bend pipe - you do it because you're nervous or stressed and it's bad.

electricians,3c7ejl,Smoke_Stack707,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:35:59 2015 UTC,You can use the torque settings to accurately finish off device screws better than a human hand.  There was a video up last year where they had electricians try to torque on lugs and almost nobody ever hit a 10% window of the manufacturer spec.  Usually they were off by like 30+%.  So virtually any tool you can use to help you reach a consistent torque will improve your consistency.

electricians,3c7ejl,therealCapwn,2,Mon Jul 6 03:26:17 2015 UTC,"There is occupational stretching you should do every morning before work and after work close to bed. This stretches the tendons and muscles to not allow them to tighten up and wear and tear. Its a difficult job to take care of yourself while working construction but its a necessity. Id take a page and a half to describe the exercises but if you look them up online/ youtube youd prolly find a good source.   Also a drill instead of a screwdriver puts your rotator cuff at risk. I had arm troubles when I started my new job because I used a drill on everything where I had always used a screwdriver. I went to a sports therapist and he gave me some simple exercises for that as well.   When you work with your body, especially anything construction, you are wearing your body out in exchange for money. You need to take a chunk of your time out in order to take care of yourself. You need cardio, stretching, and maybe another activity to use your arms to break repetitive motion.   I avoided carpel tunnel syndrome all of my life by doing a ton of different activities that all would each normally give me carpel tunnel, but Im hoping they have all canceled each other out. Or Im dumb and lucky. Well.. I am an electrician so I am dumb and lucky...   Do some yoga at home or in class. Stretch. Pay attention to what hurts and how you can make it feel better. Being sick and hurt = time not on the job making money!"

I did however work a lot with my hands before I got into the trade so that might have helped. Maybe you're just not use to working with your hands much. I do think if you use your linemans a lot to cut wire that will strengthen your wrist which should help in the long run.  Not to sound like an ""old timer"", but when I was an apprentice battery drills were few and far between so there was no using a drill as a screw driver. Later, there were those offset like screw drivers that were supposed to save your wrists but I think I used mine once, then gave it away because I didn't like it.   Here's a little tip/trick for you. When using a screw driver, first tighten the screw up by turning your fingers and not your wrist. Then once the screw gets tight, use your wrist to tighten the screw. Do the same in reverse when taking screws out. Use your wrist to loosen it up, then turn with your fingers."

electricians,3c8bkm,SuperSVGA,2,Sun Jul 5 21:08:33 2015 UTC,"Well, hopefully if that outlet has no ground connection, it's on a GFCI, otherwise it's shock hazard. This sort of thing is rather normal if you have devices like computers on an ungrounded circuit. There are EMI protection capacitors between the hot and ground wires in the PSU, and if the ground isn't hooked up they can put a small amount of stray voltage onto the ground. The impedance is too high to actually harm you, but you can potentially feel a tingle from it."
electricians,3c8bkm,robstoon,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:19:21 2015 UTC,"Sadly there aren't any GFCIs in this room. This house is old, and I guess whenever the landlord hired contractors none of them cared about doing it to code (Many years back we found an outlet in the kitchen that was hot/neu reverse).  It's not really a tingle, but a larger jolt with tingling in my hand that lasts for a few minutes after. Unfortunately everything hooked up is metal. The network switch, computers, servers, so even if it isn't harmful it's a problem."
electricians,3c8bkm,Jim-Jones,2,Sun Jul 5 21:34:12 2015 UTC,"Any ideas what it could be or what to test?   Bad ground for a start. The whole house could be ungrounded or just that run. I'd check the main ground, then check from that to the panel ground and the outlet ground.  One solution if all else fails is a big isolation transformer to run all that gear on. It'll prevent shocks at least and maybe protect your gear from lightning."
electricians,3c8bkm,duckquil,-1,Sun Jul 5 21:38:32 2015 UTC,Id say 1 your hot and neutral are swapped in the outlet and it matters for the internal circuitry or 2 that the UPS has a faulty part inside somewhere. Get a three pronged receptacle tester and see if its wired correctly. Plug the UPS into another outlet and see if you get 60V in the case again. and if both are correct its definitely the UPS.
electricians,3c8bkm,Jim-Jones,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:41:47 2015 UTC,The three pronged tester shows open ground on all the outlets in the room. For some reason when I plug my coax line into the UPS it shows there is some sort of ground.
electricians,3c8bkm,duckquil,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:01:00 2015 UTC,"when I plug my coax line into the UPS it shows there is some sort of ground.   Yep. We've had several cases of this. Nasty. Failing a full check out and repair, the isolation transformer is the other fix."
electricians,3c8bkm,almost_a_troll,-1,Mon Jul 6 03:49:44 2015 UTC,"Gotcha I had the same problem on a buddies laptop. You need a ground for an UPS period but your building ground and your coax are not bonded together. My buddy had a macbook and when the cable guy came to hook up the cable modem, the outside of the macbook and the coax jacket arced. There was also no main bonding jumper in the house. You need to attach an UPS to a grounded receptacle period. You cannot use it otherwise because it essentially has a transformer in it. Yes even the small ones for desktop computers. Its not truly a transformer, its a filter but it still need a ground otherwise it will create its own voltages in place of ground. Make sure you have a main bonding jumper in your panel or in your service meter and make sure you get that ground to the UPS... 60V will go away."
electricians,3c8bkm,duckquil,2,Mon Jul 6 02:17:36 2015 UTC,"It's not the filter in the UPS that causes this. It's the filters in the PSUs for the computers.   Also, it's terrible advice to tell someone we know is renting their housing but don't know what kind of house it is to make sure they have a jumper in their panel. If it's a basement suite they're probably on a sub-panel. Same case with an apartment. Putting a jumper in there is bad news."
electricians,3c8bkm,almost_a_troll,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:51:57 2015 UTC,"I gotta say that the place I had this issue was a rental and if the service panel does not have a main bonding jumper then your apt is not up to code. This is the kind of shit where a baby puts its hand on the wrong two things and gets zapped. I wouldnt tell harry homeowner to do that as a fix, but if those two arent bonded thats an issue.   Also where does it say he is renting? I just missed that. I would get an electrician in to make the test at the receptacle and then write a nicely detailed letter to my landlord explaining the issue. Notarize them both and send one to my lawyer.   I dont fuck around when it comes to safety. And yes UPS have filters in them that are basically a transformer."
electricians,3c8bkm,duckquil,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:59:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, UPSs have filters, but those aren't the ones that will cause the metal cases to get energized. That's happening in the computer PSU.   The neutral and ground can only be bonded in one place, and that will be at the service entrance. If you're on a subpanel, you absolutely cannot bond neutral and ground there. That's why you can't just say ""bond at your panel"" when you don't know the situation. If you bond them in two places, now your neutral and bond are parallel conductors back to the service entrance, which is a very bad thing. (tm)"
electricians,3c8bkm,almost_a_troll,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:05:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed with bonding at sub panel. I think we are both picturing two different but common types of dwelling places and I think both of our statements are valid per what we picture in our heads.   My mention of the filter/ transformer in the UPS is that if either the rectifier part of the UPS is bad, or the output filter is blown it CAN be a 60V straight to ground connection. Remember that in an UPS you are going AC -> DC -> AC and if one of those pieces is bad, and not grounded, it can be a big issue. This is basically a floating ground. Some older UPS actually created a floating ground on purpose to lower interference. Sounds crazy but I learned my lesson from my teacher yelling at me ""you never ground an UPS"" and having my foreman yell at me ""you always ground an UPS!"". Many server rooms Ive been in that are older than 20yrs rarely ground the racks making the UPS on that rack the only point of ground.   If half of your rectifier transformer dies it will bring 60V to ground. That might not be the answer to the problem though..."
electricians,3c8bkm,duckquil,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:35:23 2015 UTC,"It's not the same thing, you made a blanket statement to bond and panel. That's dangerous. You assumed his panel was the service entrance.   The filters in a ups won't cause this situation as described by the OP. A ups does need a ground, but it isn't tomorrow do with the ups it's self, it's to do with the equipment connected. We know it's not happening due to a bad ups filter from the info OP provided.   Since it only happens with a computer connected, and knowing that they dump filter caps to ground in computer PSUs, we know it's the computer causing the issue, not the filtering in the ups.   The filtering in a ups will leave both sides floating. If there's no ground and no grounded load and  a fault to the case of the ups, you'll measure 60 or 120 volts to ground, but you won't get a noticeable shock because there is no current flow from the isolated side of the ups."

This generally applies to wall warts etc which are 'heavy' - have transformers.

The first one probably isn't just a power supply its a battery charger, or a power supply with some extra controls, which you need.   Simply put: either get an identical replacement or don't do it."

Water conducts well enough to pass the small amount of current needed to create an electrocution hazard, but it often conducts far too poorly to pass the large amount of current neededto trip a breaker."
electricians,3c2y6m,JohnProof,3,Sat Jul 4 13:00:03 2015 UTC,"My experience is that even if the breaker doesn't trip, the galvanic corrosion caused by the flow of current through the water usually destroys anything submerged after some time."

electricians,3c2y6m,DracoIgnus,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:44:20 2015 UTC,These emergency lights have a constant 240v feed to them and when they lose power they switch over to the internal battery.
electricians,3c2y6m,DracoIgnus,0,Sat Jul 4 21:14:57 2015 UTC,Yeah but if they are off there has to be a open some where. So no power would be flowing from the source down that branch right?
electricians,3c2y6m,DracoIgnus,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:00:00 2015 UTC,The lights stay off until there 240v drops out then they light up from the battery pack. The only thing lights up under normal conditions is an LED to show its charging. This is not the case with all emergency lights. It depends weather they are maintained or non-maintained.

I would start by taking electrical math courses and then move into electrical theory.  If you feel like you are learning, start taking grounding and code classes.  I would wait on motor control.  All else, like pipe bending, running wires, etc can be learned in the field."

electricians,3c46l1,rexale,3,Sat Jul 4 16:38:53 2015 UTC,I've bought it just a little over a year ago and it's not under warranty anymore.   Not necessarily. Do you have the receipt? Did you pay by credit card? Sometime they double the warranty and also the makers will sometimes do an exchange even out of warranty. I expect a 5 year warranty on all sealed units (the guts).  It could be a bad breaker (not expensive and easy fix). It could be a bad capacitor (cheap fix). Those are the first things I'd check.
electricians,3c46l1,Jim-Jones,3,Sat Jul 4 16:46:50 2015 UTC,"I would put an amp clamp on it, check if it is overloading the circuit (AC unit problem) or if the breaker is tripping too low (electrical problem). It's probably the former, in which case: /r/hvac"

electricians,3c46l1,drcujo,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:52:30 2015 UTC,Check the amperage.  It may be too much for the circuit.  That being said i've never had an air conditioner on it's own circuit trip the breaker.
electricians,3c46l1,atomicrobomonkey,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:55:17 2015 UTC,"I did a quick search and 12,000 BTU's converts to about 3516 watts.  At 120V that is 29 amps.  At 240V that is 15 amps.  So what is the amperage rating on the breaker?  And is it a 2-pole or 1-pole breaker?"
electricians,3c46l1,CPerryG,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:05:22 2015 UTC,Update. Thank you all for your answers.  I spoke to the electrician who installed the electrical panel upgrade and he confirmed with me that he run the wire and own circuit for the air conditioner. I was able to get in contact with the manufacturer and I found out that the air conditioner has a 2 year warranty.  I emailed them the receipt and I'm hoping that the air conditioner will get fixed soon.

electricians,3c21ul,robstoon,3,Tue Jul 14 06:35:39 2015 UTC,My guess is the gears inside the motor have either broken or the grease on them has hardened enough that it can't rotate properly. Those kind of motors don't have very much torque.

electricians,3c21ul,sonicjesus,3,Sat Jul 4 01:30:06 2015 UTC,"My guess is that it either allows the busted gears to stay in place or there's slightly less resistance in that position that allows it to stay turning.

electricians,3bzpt4,CubeTurret,3,Fri Jul 3 13:37:02 2015 UTC,"Here's what i've discovered in my research on the topic in preparation of retrofitting my own aluminum wiring.   There are three issues with using aluminum for residential wiring:    Aluminum is a less efficient conductor than copper, and therefore takes a larger size to conduct a given amperage safely, and tends to get warmer under load.  Both of these things contribute to thermal expansion and contraction.  Over time the repeated growing and shrinking size works tight connections loose, much like repeatedly freezing and thawing water in the winter creates pot-holes in the road. Aluminum oxidizes very quickly when exposed to air (ie passivation).  No, scruffing up the wire doesn't eliminate this: it re-oxidizes too quickly.  As aluminum oxide is an insulator, connections need to be extremely tight so that separate wires are squished together hard enough to break through this layer of oxide, and stay tight over time to prevent air from entering the union and causing more oxidization.  You can hopefully now see how the thermal expansion is so problematic.  Dissimilar metals (copper & aluminum) in an electromagnetic environment will undergo galvanic corrosion.  Basically the different rate of the flow of electrons will eat away at one of the two metals, corroding it and reducing conductivity.  Reduced conductivity means more heat, which means we're headed back into the above problems even faster.    As you can see, the problem is with the connections, not so much the wires themselves.  Aluminum wires are more brittle when repeatedly bent, like a paper clip bent back and forth over and over, but that's generally not a problem unless the installers were horrible at their jobs.   Here are various solutions to these problems:    Only use aluminum with aluminum rated fixtures.  These are hard to find, very expensive, and not highly trusted from what I can tell. Splice the aluminum to copper, aka pigtail.  Basically attach a short length of copper wire to the end of your aluminum, then use that copper to connect to any other connection you need to make.  There are a variety of ways to do this.   Use a regular wirenut and oxide preventative paste in the connection.  Commonly called ""noalox"", this paste is meant to slow or prevent aluminum from oxidizing, and to reduce galvanic corrosion.  This is usually the only solution you'll find at your big box hardware stores.  Don't do this, and don't listen to any employees of these places that recommend this.  They're clueless bordering on dangerous.  Use a purple wirenut, aka Ideal 65.  These are made for aluminum connections and have this oxide prevention paste built into the nut itself.  Call me frightened by the fear mongers of the internet, but given the better solutions below I'd recommend passing on this as well.  Use a wire connector called an ""alumiconn"", as some others have mentioned.  This is lug connector so it's a bit different than your standard wirenut.  It has a small metal bar embedded in a plastic case, with three holes for connections and is filled with oxide prevention paste.  The idea is the wires never touch each other, only this special metal bar that doesn't corrode or oxidize, and the wires are screwed in tightly so any concern of expansion of the wire material is eliminated.  Or at least greatly reduced.  They're expensive (around $3 each in volume), their large size makes box-fill an issue, and you need a torque screwdriver to insure you're cranking the screws down hard enough.  They're one of the few solutions that are considered a permanent retrofit by some US government agency, and the cheapest of these.  Use a pigtail system called COPALUM.  This is a tool that smashes the copper and aluminum wires together so strongly they're permanently bonded.  They call it a cold weld.  These are the best connections you can make as it basically turns it into a single wire, and the joints are smaller than wirenuts.  However, the tool is prohibitively expensive and available only to trained professionals.  Still cheaper than re-wiring the entire house, though. Also a permanent retrofit, and sometimes the only alternative to rewiring insurance companies will accept.  Re-wire the house.   It's a beast of a topic surrounded by the marketing and scare tactics lots of companies and services trying to make a buck off fixing an deservedly important topic.  Good luck wading through it all and getting it fixed right the first time."

electricians,3bzpt4,Jim-Jones,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:10:36 2015 UTC,"Most homes now are copper wiring and fixture manufacturers are still allowed to be cheap and use aluminum tails. I throw these under a simple marrette every time without batting an eye. Everyone does. The other way around where your branch circuits are aluminum and your fixture tails are copper Id be a little more cautious with an approved AL to CU marrette but even that I think is overkill mostly because the fixture whip wires are so small and wrap tightly around branch circuit conductors and under a wirenut im just not that concerned about hear cycles in this case like splicing a single #18 copper to a #12 aluminum. It's not in the same ballpark to me as making real copper pigtails for circuits with continuous high loads passing through them. But like I said I'd probably use the approved wirenut for ease of mind for my install 40 years later. But honestly for light fixtures it's not a big deal. They're practically all aluminum anyway it's that small of a deal. They know they'll be spliced to copper under a normal wirenut it just doesn't matter. Does it matter a ton the other way around, probably not."

electricians,3bxv0y,robstoon,2,Fri Jul 3 01:57:48 2015 UTC,"Aha, so the 347/600 will be able to run 347 for certain lighting, and 600 for the motors (I think these motors can run on 600)  Now we're getting somewhere! Thank you all."
electricians,3bxv0y,JohnProof,2,Fri Jul 3 03:47:14 2015 UTC,"Most big commercial buildings tend to have most of the lighting on 347V, at least in areas where that's a common supply voltage - you can run a ton of lights on one circuit with it. If you went with that, you'd need a transformer to 120/208 to run your regular plug outlets and any equipment that can't be set up to run off 347/600."
electricians,3bxv0y,doccynical,0,Fri Jul 3 04:49:13 2015 UTC,"You do realize you can't simply supply all your shop equipment with more voltage without destroying it, correct?  If all your equipment is designed to be dual voltage then you could rewire each machine to accept higher voltage and this would give you more service capacity.  That said there is no such animal as a 208/600V motor, so approaching this from the wrong angle:  Figure out the highest voltages your machines will accept, then choose your service voltage."
electricians,3bxv0y,robstoon,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:39:14 2015 UTC,"Hazard #2 doesn't make any sense at all. ""Disconnects positive side""? This is just gibberish.  ""Neutral is connected to ground""? This is true for all of our AC power.  Neutral can backfeed the circuit? WTF?"

electricians,3bxv0y,Jim-Jones,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:44:57 2015 UTC,I agree. The only thing I can think of is that there saying the neutral is still carrying the current from the other 2 phases if it is a shared neutral and you can get juiced off of that.

electricians,3bxfhh,frogsailor,7,Thu Jul 2 23:13:25 2015 UTC,Fans and heavy fixtures almost always have a way to hang them while you make up the joint. I hang every fixture and fan in all houses I do by myself.  There are different methods depending on the fan or fixture.  There is a physical aspect to it. You have to be strong enough to lift the fan or fixture with one hand while climbing a ladder.
electricians,3bxfhh,microwavedbulb,2,Fri Jul 3 00:47:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, every Fan comes with some way to hook the device onto the baseplate, allowing it to hang and giving you two free hands to wire it up."

electricians,3bxfhh,redditmoose,3,Sat Jul 4 18:00:11 2015 UTC,"If there's no built-in hook on the fixture/mounting bracket, I'll just use a scrap piece of wire...hook one end to the ceiling box and the other end to the fixture."
electricians,3bxfhh,JMac87,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:22:53 2015 UTC,"Multiple ladders. I'll try to find one that's slightly taller than I need to hang the fixture. Then balance that thing on top. Sometimes, two of the same ladder plus a board. The real trick is getting the ladders out when you're done hanging the fixture. If you have two, rotate the board and slowly let the fixture drop between them. If you went with one, well, pull in the leg or legs and use the ladder as a lever to drop the fixture slowly.  Now, ceiling fans and other items that have a straight rod are a little trickier. For these I would use a slightly shorter ladder or ladders and spacers of some sort to lift up a board so the fixture is about 3""-4"" from where I need to hang it. This gives me room to make up wires. Magnetic screwdrivers are a wonder tool when trying to curl a 75lb fixture into place one handed and get some screws into it."
electricians,3bxfhh,i4c8e9,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:54:49 2015 UTC,"If the ceiling is below an attic, you can punch a hole in the box and drop a piece of utility rope down to the floor, then hoist and tie it off in the attic, leaving it hang by 6"". Great for heavy chandeliers too far from a wall for an extension ladder."
electricians,3bxfhh,sonicjesus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:53:26 2015 UTC,"fans have a bracket you install first.  Chandeliers have a chain that you can open with chain pliers and hang.  If something is too heavy, then I get someone or don't do it."
electricians,3bxfhh,coogie,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:18:17 2015 UTC,All recommendations sound good! Just make sure you have a rated bracket box.

electricians,3bxfhh,Eglitarian,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:03:04 2015 UTC,"For chandeliers, set the chain length, weave the wire through, and then put the nut followed by canopy in that order. Attach the mounting bracket to the chain after the canopy is on and slid down to the bottom of the chain. Have a box screw ready on a drill or screwdriver at the top of the ladder to save fiddling around. Leave any glass shades that can go on after its assembled off until you have it securely hung as those add the most weight and are more likely to break as you carry it up the ladder. Screw the bracket into the box securely then wire it up.   For ceiling fans, they either have a hook for the safety wire to hook onto, or for ones with a downrod they have a ball end that you set into the bracket. Hook up any safety wires first and then proceed to wire it up.   Vanity lights are awkward, but I've found resting them in the crook of your elbow leaves you both hands to do connections and keeps it from scratching up the wall."

electricians,3by9pr,totallynotmike_,3,Fri Jul 3 03:46:31 2015 UTC,there are perfectly viable low voltage solutions available to you. there are lights that use DC and you can control them via RF remote (dimable). i would suggest a wifi controlled outlet (<$50) and wall plug light preferably LED because of heat.
electricians,3by9pr,7eventy7,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:57:02 2015 UTC,"If your goal is charging cellphones and nooks, I like those new USB charging outlets.  They have one outlet and 2 usb chargers."

electricians,3by9pr,dennington111,0,Fri Jul 3 04:23:26 2015 UTC,"White, black and bare. I cross posted in DIY as well and before they went private the consensus over there was 14/2 would be enough. I originally wanted a ground but you're the third person now to tell me I didn't need one."
electricians,3by9pr,dennington111,6,Fri Jul 3 04:25:49 2015 UTC,"No no no no. You -NEED- a ground. Do not ever let anybody ever tell you otherwise. 14/2 has 1 'hot' (black) wire, 1 neutral (white) wire, and 1 ground (bare copper or green) wire. When you hook up the pigtail (male/pronged end of the extension cord) it'll have 3 different colored screws. One silver, one brass, and one green. Hook up the white wire to silver, black to brass, and bare/green to green. When you connect all in your main junction box, connect all colors to the same color, and twist them together (color to color) and twist the wire nut on. The plugs will have a similar setup to the extension cord color coded screws.   Look, not to sound mean,but as far as I can tell you need to do more research before you do this project. If you're not comfortable, don't do it. This is a place where she sleeps, you sleep, and if it were to catch fire, you're sleeping on the couch for a long time. Also, if it does catch, insurance will not cover it.  What I would do if I were you, find some sort of mountable power strip and recess it into the headboard. On the backside, do the same and plug a corded light into it. Easier, cheaper, and not as risky. I designed something g like your talking about a while back, and it was my 'save' from her Pinterest designs....haven't built it yet, but my point is I wire for a living and am confident that my work would be safe.   Basically....never trust do it yourself ers. If you really want to install outlets, a switch, and a fixture, look up some videos on how to wire on YouTube. Pay attention to switch wiring, it can get tricky. Also, use a 'decora' style switch, preferably dimmable. Late night activities can be greatly benefitted by dim lights, and decora' style doesn't stick far out from the wall, so if a head/leg/rump hits it, it won't hurt. Second, use what are called re-model boxes for the outlets and switch. They'll set in just fine and they're easy as hell. Use a remodel light box, too. Third, what I had designed, use a gfci outlet for the first outlet on the chain, power in on line side and power out to the next outlet on load side. If ya spill water or beer on any of them, they'll trip before anything bad happens.   This is just me, though. I tend to over-engineer, but its not a bad thing...right?"
electricians,3by9pr,Jim-Jones,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:53:55 2015 UTC,I absolutely appreciate the words of caution. My electrical experience is almost entirely limited to swapping out broken plugs and switches over the years. I have a basic understanding but am only self taught and I've never run new wire. Which is exclusively the reason I wanted a educated set of eyes on the project.   I got confused on the trailing 3 I assumed that counted the ground I didn't realize that it only counted wires carrying current.   I'm confident that once I have plans in place that I know to be safe that I can wire it appropriately.
electricians,3by9pr,JohnKinbote,2,Fri Jul 3 05:11:14 2015 UTC,My main concern would be the lack of U/L listing for the setup. Unless all the components are U/L rated and installed in compliance.
electricians,3by9pr,Jim-Jones,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:00:16 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure they're not listed to be installed in furniture with an extension cord. That would have to be manufactured and tested as an assembly.
electricians,3by9pr,dennington111,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:51:13 2015 UTC,Indeed. Safer to use U/L listed clip on lamps. Or a 12 volt LED system.

electricians,3by9pr,justin_144,2,Fri Jul 3 05:15:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know who told you you don't need a ground, but you do.  The number after the ""/"" is the number of current-carrying conductors in the cable. 14/2 is black/white/green ground, and that's what you need for the cable with the plug.   Use 14/2 romex for the internal connections, the bare wire in the romex is ground and connect them together with the green from the cable. All the grounds connect together and all the neutrals connect together.   If there is a 3 after the ""/"" there are 3 current carrying conductors, usually used either in 3-way switching or 120/240 runs. You don't need it for this."

electricians,3bvv1r,kiefcatchers,-1,Thu Jul 2 22:55:50 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think the tape is a waste of time and material (for all the money tape costs lol). If you've wired and installed the receptacle properly and tightened the screws you're not using, you shouldn't need tape because nothing is going to short out. The only time it might short out is if you try to take out the receptacle and work on it live, which is definitely not the recommended practice for obvious reasons.  In the case of this picture... why even go through the effort of making this extension cord? You could buy a power bar for a few dollars, or at the very least put an 1110 box or something with the receptacle and cover - especially if you're running a 20a circuit through it. Who knows, it may have just been a spare plug he had laying around - still dumb."

But some folks would take fans that were meant for the machines we were building and strip off an extension cord, then attach the three wires. So there was a definite shock hazard if you touched the screw the wire was crimped to.  Main reason they used the fans was it was super hot in the summer and there was no A/C in the building."

electricians,3byezp,LocoKen,3,Fri Jul 3 04:34:42 2015 UTC,Where is the transformer? Is it pole mounted? Or mounted on the ground?  This is going to require a lot of work to do. New lines from the transformer to allow for the increased amperage. Possibility of cold sequence metering depending on your local rules. You're also going to possibly be looking at a small CDP or a group of three fused disconnects for each of the three buildings.
electricians,3byezp,ithinarine,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:05:43 2015 UTC,"The transformer is a pad mount next to the existing shop shown on the diagram.  We were hoping to mount the new meter to a post that is part of the existing shop, if possible.  How would three fused disconnects be run off of a 400a. meter or do I need to do something different with metering this?  Sorry for the confusion."
electricians,3byezp,ithinarine,2,Fri Jul 3 05:15:27 2015 UTC,"You're getting to the size of service where the first point of disconnect might not necessarily be the meter. You'd need to check with your local rules, but they might make you go to cold sequence metering at that size.   This means that from the transformer, the lines first go to a 400A fused disconnect. Out of that disconnect, then you go to the meter. Out of the meter you run to a splitter box, and out of the splitter, you run 3 lines to yet another fused disconnect for each of the 3 buildings (say a 200A for the shop, 200A for the house, and 100A for the the ADU).   And out of those three fused disconnects, you finally run your underground runs to each of the 3 buildings' main panels. You're going to have a huge wall full of electrical equipment. This isn't just a case of running 3 wires out of the load side of the meter, doesn't work that way."
electricians,3byezp,lookatthatsquirrel,2,Fri Jul 3 05:31:04 2015 UTC,"What happened to your drawing?  You can mount a 320 meter socket, a section of trough, and three disconnects on a board outside or on a building.  Bring your drawing back."

Not sure what went wrong, but I can see it now.  Could we just leave the meter going to the house alone and add the 400a. meter from the transformer to service the new shop and ADU or does everything on the property need to be disconnected together?"
electricians,3bw6tv,KevOK80,2,Thu Jul 2 17:30:17 2015 UTC,"Its very unlikely you will be able to move just a single plug to a different outlet without making a mess of your walls and possibly ceiling, and having to re-do a bunch of drywall.   You would need to locate where the cable leading to the outside plug comes from, remove it, and then run a new cable back to your panel.   Not a job to do yourself if you have no experience."

electricians,3bw6tv,KingdaToro,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:01:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, but doing that would move the the entire circuit to the other breaker, defeating the purpose. Moving an outlet from one circuit to another is much more complicated unless they happen to share a junction box, and even then you have to find it and identify the wires."

What is the transformer supply output?  What do the color wires indicate?  I assume the 3 screws from top to bottom are: Rear Door, Transformer, Front Door..."
electricians,3bufa6,cheat_on_ur_spouse,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:36:03 2015 UTC,"You're right about the screws.  There is a 12V DC transformer somewhere that powers everything.  You don't need to worry about it.  If the doorbell works at all, then the transformer is fine.  Here's a much clearer diagram.  I think the diode is supposed to be in parallel across the switch contacts, like this.      The idea is that the diode closes the circuit so that the chime is always powered.   A diode has a fixed voltage drop, so the always-on power is at a slightly lower voltage than the button-pressed power.  The button shorts the diode (when pressed) and provides a full 12V, which the chime takes as the signal to sound."
electricians,3bufa6,cheat_on_ur_spouse,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:10:44 2015 UTC,"Any idea what the color of the wires might indicate?  I see a blue and a black wire.  I assume one is transformer output and one is the doorbell switch.  I have a multimeter...so if I probe one of the wires I assume I should read 12V on one, and nothing on the other?"
electricians,3bufa6,nanio0300,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:24:30 2015 UTC,"The wire colors indicate what colors of wire were laying around when the doorbell was hooked up.  Look at the first diagram.  That's exactly how you are connected now, except minus the rear switch and plus a diode that's doing nothing.   I should read 12V on one, and nothing on the other?   Voltage is always relative to something else.  Look at the diagram again.  It's an open circuit.  If the transformer is ground-referenced, you will see 12V or so between one of the wires and any ground point, such as the ground pin on an electrical outlet.  When the switch is pressed, you will see 12V between the two wires.  Reverse the leads and you'll see -12V.  Or maybe 10V, maybe 18V, it really doesn't matter because you know the doorbell is getting enough power to operate.     Put the diode across the switch, and now (with switch unpressed) you'll see (probably) 0.7V less than when the switch is pressed."

If that's the case, the ground is ""bootlegged"" to the neutral.  The best option if there isn't an incoming ground would be to pull a new feed from the panel then separate the neutral and ground.

You can probably add a bare wire to the existing twisted grounds with a wirenut and use that to ground the box. Blank and done.  Edit: Ok, I see five whites. Just remove the white wire that is connected to the grounds from the four neutrals and hook it to the box.

electricians,3btgas,thatotherguy321,5,Thu Jul 2 00:29:44 2015 UTC,The five foot rule is for when you are using the metal water pipe to ground the service. It's better to just use ground rods.  If you are using the already grounded service to bond metal pipe it doesn't matter where you bond it.
electricians,3btgas,microwavedbulb,2,Thu Jul 2 00:48:10 2015 UTC,The five foot rule is for when you are using the metal water pipe to ground the service. It's better to just use ground rods.   The code requires us to bond to ALL grounding electrodes that are present. 250.50  You must use the metal water pipe as a grounding electrode and therefore it must be bonded within 5 feet of entering the building 250.52(A)(1)
electricians,3btgas,kidcharm86,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:49:13 2015 UTC,"Maybe where you live.  We don't use metal water pipe as a grounding system here. We ground the service with ground rods.

It doesn't say all listed systems must be electrodes.  If you read 250.53 (D) you'll see it talks about ""if"" water pipes are used as a grounding electrode. To me that if makes it pretty clear that they aren't always used."

How the hell is this confusing?  If you have a metal water pipe that meets the criteria of 250.52(A)(1) you MUST bond to it with an appropriately sized grounding electrode conductor   The article you referenced is an installation article.  When it says if, it's referring to the fact that not all metal water pipes qualify, for instance if it has less than 10 feet in contact with the earth. 250.53(D)(1)&(2) tell us to bond around the water meter and that a metal water pipe alone is not sufficient.

I know it is supposed to be grounded to the main panel's box cover, the same place where the grounding rod gets bonded but specifically for a residential install I dont know the size, run and how much. I have seen on multiple installs a #8 Al solid going to an AlCu rated clamp on what I think was 1"" Cu pipe but it might have been 3/4"". I have seen it on a small section of pipe on the cold water side of a hot water tank because you can also hit the gas pipe too (as stated above).

There are multiple cables of different voltages and ampacities in the same fittings.  I recall 14/2 and 12/2 going in together being okay, but 10/3 isn't.  Maybe someone can cite the rule for this one since I can't find it? PVC pipe connectors are not a suitable fitting for any application except PVC pipe raceways entering the panel bx connectors are also not suitable for NM90.  This violates CEC 12-524(1).  I recommend these personally, but other people like these Paper staples are not suitable for NM90.  My recommendation is these but some people prefer metal cable nailing straps and even fewer like S2 style staples.  They meet code, so I'll mention them. I see a staple for one of the 14/2's at the top right of the panel is edge-on.  This one violates CEC 12-506(6) in Canada, not sure about the NEC. We are expected to secure our NM90 cables within 12"" of entering any device, including the electrical panel.  Some of those cables aren't even secured to that wall.  This is according to CEC 12-510 in Canada.  I'm not familiar with the NEC analogue. My mentors taught me that a good wiring plan will only very exceptionally cross any two cables.  This is unplanned.  There was no effort made to have the cables enter straight whatsoever.  I submit someone else's work as an example of this concept. In the lower picture, I see all of the cables entering the wall-space by travelling on the face of the studs where drywall would sit, eliminating that possibility.  Then again, so do the cables going down to the bottom of the panel.  This violates CEC 12-514.   After having read the comments, I don't suspect you're responsible for all the things I see wrong.  I'm just letting you know what I suspect are the reasons all these are bashing your work.  I'm sure it'll be much better next time around.  I'm sure we can also get more examples of quality work around here considering how many folks seem to know what that looks like.  Us apprentii all need some eye candy."

I recall 14/2 and 12/2 going in together being okay, but 10/3 isn't   Never heard of such a rule.  If you have different voltages to ground, then all conductors have to be rated for the highest voltage.  But 120 and 240 are treated the same for the most part, as they are both the same voltage to ground."

electricians,3bx2en,almost_a_troll,0,Sat Jul 4 17:52:14 2015 UTC,"The 4th wire from the left has black smudge on it from being pulled through about 50 ft of 2x10 rafters.  In all likelihood, I will be running a raceway up due to the fact that none of my local stores have the correct size KO plastic bushings.  Regarding the cables entering by traveling on the face of the stud. That is fine because drywall isn't going up on that frame. That will be an enclosed space once another frame gets built behind the panel to separate it.  Regarding the BX connectors: They aren't BX connectors. They are these: http://halexco.com/products.cfm?siteSection=contractor&productID=346 which are rated to work with NM Sheathed cable.  Regarding the staples, There isn't anything wrong with them? They are 1/2"" metal non insulated staples, and are rated to work with NM style cable.  Regarding not having the cables secured within 12"". I mentioned to someone's reply that a 2X4 will be mounted face on between the left and right standing studs for this once the remaining circuits are pulled.  All of this would have been more neatly organized if it all happened at once, but dealing with cables that were pre wired in the house from the old panel and having new circuits being ran at different time frames makes it a little difficult as some older circuits are energized, while some of the new ones aren't. Once the remaining cables are pulled, I'll have enough time  to clean up the runs. I have enough cable length to move cables around in the panel and to make sure they end up neatly to their breaker location in the panel.  Also, thanks for the actual useful feedback. Most of this was actually my father's work."

You will need to have a disconnect located outside within a few feet (depends on your code) of the unit as a service shut off. If you provide some geography someone from your area could give you more precise numbers and methods.

Generally with a kit you get 2 batteries, a drill, an impact and a charger for a good deal that's why people recommend them. Then you'll want a case full of bits for your impact driver and maybe a couple drill bits.  Milwaukee is good but I find it hard to recommend based on price and how many people I've seen have problems. Impacts that no longer hammer, drill triggers disconnect/stop working, grip falls off way too early, expensive batteries, expensive kits. They are awesome when they work but for the price..idk.

It can do almost anything well.  The hammer feature is better than past models, but still doesn't fair nearly as well as an actual hammer drill.  But will will drill some holes in masonry, brick, concrete, etc.  Sometimes not, depends on the material.  The impact is a tool you don't want to do without.  The versatility with fasteners is unmatched.  It will make driving any threaded fastener easier.  I've used my to free up seized, rusted screws in pole light fixture covers before.  Being an apprentice can make it difficult.  My advice would generally be not to skimp on tools, especially a tool like this.  A tool that works well and feels good in your hand will make you work faster and more comfortably.  On a daily basis, it's hard to put a price on that.  It's too bad you're not union, then the contractor provides them.  Lastly, there are tons of varieties of sets and individual tools.  Some come with smaller batteries, weaker motors, etc.  On that front, I'd say find the models and sets in your price range and then go to the manufacturers' websites and compare the specifications of each tool model to get what you feel will work for you best.  You may find that you may up your budget when doing the heavy comparing.  Don't forget they are an investment and should last you years."

The newer 20v with lithium batteries don't last nearly as long between charges, and I find they don't have as much torque.   If you take care of your drill, the drill itself should outlast the battery. NiCad batteries have a lifespan around 1000 charge cycles before their capacity significantly deteriorates. Lithium batteries have a shelf life of about 3-4 years before they need replacing.  A regular drill is used for making holes. An impact driver is a smaller body drill used for using screws, and has a chuck designed for screw bits. A hammerdrill is a drill that has a setting to vibrate the drill bit, used for drilling in masonry/concrete. Usually worthless except for soft cinderblock. Your company ideally will provide you with one of these instead: Rotary Hammer: drill designed with a special chuck to accept special bits (SDS) designed to drill into masonry.

I've seen coworkers unwrap the set to find the reverse switch doesn't work/ tremendous sparks shooting out the back casing (I know sparks are normal but this was like a small flamethrower). I've owned a few (3) Makita sets and am continually impressed by their ruggedness and durability. 18 volt drills seem like a current standard but I like the feel of the 12v /14v modern options if I'm carrying it around all day

Still waiting for it to die so I can get a Fuel.  I also bent the chuck by using an 18"" x 1.25"" auger bit to go through 7 studs and hitting a nail while leaning on it.  It still runs, but it has a wobble.  The advantage to the M18 hammer drill is that you can get solid torque when you want, and you can also do course torque setting for receptacles and that which you cannot do with an impact.  The correct setting is 2 for receptacles and switches, and 5 for iberville box grounds and clamps.  The drill is heavier than most others because it's made of fucking steel."

Dewalt are crap but a good bang for the buck. They are fairly cheap, so you might want to get a pair and let them last until you have tried out everyone else's stuff.

electricians,3bou78,thatotherguy321,21,Tue Jun 30 23:00:35 2015 UTC,I call it a service loop. Aluminium is notorious for working itself loose in the lugs from the heating/cooling cycles from loading/unloading the conductors. This leaves a few inches to hack off and re-terminate when the conductor becomes loose and burns up in the lugs.
electricians,3bou78,persianrug,4,Tue Jun 30 23:31:12 2015 UTC,The face I have when there is one inch left beyond the destroyed copper just out of reach of the terminal.   Such a waste. The extra 100mm of service loop should last the lifespan of the house.
electricians,3bou78,TED_666,8,Wed Jul 1 01:56:38 2015 UTC,I always leave a loop if it's a underground service. So if the cable settles with the ground it has some slack to pull instead of ripping out the main breaker.
electricians,3bou78,Imaelectrician,7,Wed Jul 1 01:44:45 2015 UTC,I build electrical panels and I use loops to limit strain on the connections and allow some extra length for future modifications.  Nothing worse then having to replace a conductor if only the person before left a little slack in the wire.

electricians,3bownp,beekermc,8,Tue Jun 30 23:43:58 2015 UTC,Not really. During WWII the UK came up with different wiring standards to save resources. Fusing the plug allows you to use less copper. It's very bad to unfuse these plugs.
electricians,3bownp,microwavedbulb,2,Tue Jun 30 23:53:33 2015 UTC,"What is it, and what do you feel is unsafe?"
electricians,3bownp,swen83,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:47:06 2015 UTC,"UK wiring rules are different, like they all seem to be.  They rely on all devices to have a fuse in the plug to protect against overload, as the installation cables are not protected by breakers that in many many localities provide that level of protection. As mentioned above, this was a policy brought in during the war to save copper.   In Aus we don't use ring mains in domestic installations, and breakers provide OL and SC protection (and generally EL as well) and are sized to each cable. We also have standards relating to our plug ratings, which negate the need for fuses in plugs for other reasons as well."
electricians,3bownp,StitchTheSmall,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:58:08 2015 UTC,Yes it is unsafe. It needs to have a fuse or it could burn out.
electricians,3bownp,stefan442,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:30:33 2015 UTC,Yea I'd say replace the plug and get a fuse in it! You could be plugging it into a circuit which is incorrectly protected at the board!!

White wire is for your under cabinet lighting. I'm curious what's under the green tape. I'm guessing that cord has been chopped up and reconnected. It's ugly as hell, but the main safety concern is that something in the cabinet catches the white wire while you are getting it down, pulls the connection apart, and you have live bare wire up there - which shorts on said kitchen item. The electrical was not finished by a electrician, whole cabinet install screams first time to me. I'm going to go out on a limb and say you are a renter - if so a few cable tacks to secure the white cord, and it will be fine for the year or two you are there.   Use a step stool when you have to get something down from that cabinet, so you can see and don't catch any wires."
electricians,3bpfsl,Waltmarkers,2,Wed Jul 1 03:04:00 2015 UTC,"Is it possible the green tape bundles are acting as a bumper to keep the cord in it's respective cabinet?

electricians,3bpfsl,RedWhiteAndJew,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:22:19 2015 UTC,One solution to make it electrically safe is to set a Junction box at each of the green tape splices and run either a conduit or MC cable between boxes. Eliminating the romex .

electricians,3bp414,uint128_t,3,Wed Jul 1 02:18:36 2015 UTC,Neon bulbs will light up if there's even a tiny bit of current available. Something like dust buildup inside the switch that allows a tiny amount of current to go across the contacts with the switch off could cause that.
electricians,3bp414,robstoon,2,Wed Jul 1 03:18:57 2015 UTC,"It may not matter. There could be a long run somewhere like to and from the switch and thus some capacitance. Unless it drives you nuts, ignore it.  If you replace one neon bulb with a regular one I bet it stops."
electricians,3bp414,Jim-Jones,2,Wed Jul 1 02:55:36 2015 UTC,Is the switch controlling it one that is illuminated in the off position? This can sometimes cause issues with some lamp types.
electricians,3bp414,EmperorOfHemp,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:13:08 2015 UTC,Tiny amount of corrosion will cause this.  Most likely the switch.  Try replacing the switch.
electricians,3bp414,TurnbullFL,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:50:23 2015 UTC,"As I recall these operate on a principle similar to a Jacobs ladder of sorts (the thing in the Frankenstein movies where a spark jumps across two wires and rises to the top before dissipating). These heat the plates causing the neon to arc in the region where it's hot, then the heat causes the filament to warp causing a new region to be closer and therefore less resistance causing the arc to travel and simulating flicker.   That being said, those two flame shaped filaments hammered out nice and flat and placed millimeters apart inside a vacuum envelope make a decent capacitor. They'd probably be able to collectively store enough charge that you could open the switch and still see a bit of flicker. The reason it travels is that you change the characteristics of the ""capacitor"" causing a new region on a different filament to experience low resistance and discharge occurs there instead.   That's my theory anyway. I bet if you put a single standard lamp in the fixture it won't do it. It's kinda like ghost voltage when you check the traveller wires on a 3 way switch."

electricians,3bpnk4,d03boy,2,Wed Jul 1 04:23:29 2015 UTC,I would just built a really simple loopback device for the coax. Just basically get a coax end piece and wire the positive and negative sheathing together so there isn't any resistance. Then you can just hook it onto a line so it loops back on itself and figure out which one it goes to on the other end using an ohm meter. This is what I do with cat5 cables as well.

After getting into the attic I can see that the junction box above the fan was delivering power to the switch. So they were using the black as a hot and the red as a switch leg to carry power to the plugs in the room.  So if the black is delivering power, the white is neutral, and red is extra. Then according to the diagram here http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/pdfImages/f0/f0da0c63-9b7c-4db0-850c-892fe94c9687.pdf   I hook up the following:   black/white from the switch to black bringing power  blue from switch to red to blue on fan  white is tied in with white.   *Problem is now I don't have a black to go to fan. (bottom wire on the diagram.)  So do I have to run an extra wire or burn my house down and start from scratch?!?  *edit for formatting"
electricians,3bpkr2,ThousandSunsOfFury,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:18:35 2015 UTC,"Since the order of things from my understanding is Power > Fan box > Switch > Plugs.

electricians,3bpkr2,ShoulderChip,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:54:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you don't have enough wires.

electricians,3bpkr2,meetc,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:18:45 2015 UTC,"Not quite. you need to remove one black from the existing bundle of blacks, the one that is in the same cable as the white and red. This black that you take out of the bundle goes to black on the fan, and black on the switch.  The red wire attaches to blue on both ends.  The white wire attaches to the bundle of blacks in the ceiling and the black/white on the switch.  Marking the white could be required by your local code, but would only be for identification. It's not required where I am. The fan will still work if you don't.  Actually, disregard everything I said. It appears that there are extra cables leaving the switch box, possibly feeding plugs? I think the only solution would be to either to have both the light and fan on at the same time, or exchange the fan for another that can be controlled by pull chains."
electricians,3bpkr2,d03boy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:28:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, plugs are fed from the light switch plate. So, this won't work? There is no option with this current fan and switch? Not even to run a new wire?"
electricians,3bpkr2,Jim-Jones,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:39:28 2015 UTC,"You can run a new cable, but your fan won't work properly with your current setup. It would need to be a 4 conductor cable, and it would be a good idea to remove the old at the same time. You cannot add just a single wire."
electricians,3bpkr2,Jim-Jones,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:44:19 2015 UTC,So I can't run a new 12/2 from the fan box to the switch and make it work? If I run a 12/2 from the fan box to the switch to feed the plugs can I jump off of that with the existing 12/3 to make the fan work? Sorry to be annoying..
electricians,3bpkr2,logosogol,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:54:02 2015 UTC,"You don't need 12 gauge wire, unless the other wires in the box are also 12. 14 will do fine.    You can't run any new cables to the switch box, as you would likely exceed its rated box fill. You may have difficulty fitting the dimmer in the box as it is. The ceiling box already has 4 cables in it. You could add a connector in one of the 1/2"" knockouts, but the cable compressions are already full.  There are lots of other options, but changing the 3 conductor to a 4 conductor wold probably be easiest, cause least wall damage and be cheapest in my opinion."
electricians,3bobp3,soulrebel78,3,Tue Jun 30 20:43:17 2015 UTC,"I would guess it's your regency heating kicking in when it shouldn't be, because that's fairly high, even for electric heat. My parents cabin has all elecric heat and costs about $350 a month in the winter to heat, but it's also fairly large and we often have whole weeks at a time where it's -30 or colder."
electricians,3bobp3,Imaelectrician,2,Wed Jul 1 15:57:31 2015 UTC,"This is probably a better question for /r/hvac ... but...   The ""emergency heating"" in the attic is likely an electric coil system (much like your space heaters), and as such, expensive to run.  (air source) Heat pumps only work down to a certain temperature - below that, the auxiliary (""emergency"") heating will activate. The temperature you can run down to depends on the particular unit - mine only goes down to 28F. Below that my auxiliary heat kicks in.   This threshold is controlled by my thermostat - and mine is adjustable.   So... depending on your climate, your heat pump may not be able to operate at your typical winter temperatures, or your outside temperature threshold on your controller may be set too high."

Most times, that's the problem. You need to set the thermostat so that never comes on. And to do that you need to know if it does. The simplest way is to turn emergency heat off and don't use any night setback. Then try 1 degree of night setback, then 2 and so on. You can also jigger with the times. When you get to the point where it is not satisfactory, reduce the amount of night setback. If needed, turn emergency back on after the system is working OK.  It's possible to add a meter system to check if the emergency heat runs, but it might be a bit hard to do."

electricians,3bobp3,microwavedbulb,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:07:08 2015 UTC,"heating with electricity is probably the most expensive way to heat a home, just behind fuel oil, or burning $100 dollar bills for heat. A heat pump is an air conditioner in reverse. An air con takes the heat in your home and pumps it to the outside, leaving your home cooler, a heat pump just takes what heat from outside it can get and pumps it into your home, which is much more efficient that heating up an electric element in a heater, and using a fan to push that heat.  Your space heaters likely can heat up to 1500w or higher. running these buggers for several hours can really add up: for instance say your electric rate is $0.11 cents per Kwh. Running the space heater from 5pm until 6 am (gotta stay warm after work and while you sleep) thats $1.81 per day for one space heater. 1.81 a day for a month is $54.30 for 1 space heater. you said you had a few.  Now back to the heat pump, They are great when they can operate, but some can only work when the outside temp is above a certain range. my folks have one that works down to 20 degrees Fahrenheit, some like u/ninjacoder only works down to 28 degrees. really new high end ones can work down to the single digits above zero. After that your heating system needs a secondary source of heat. And it sounds like your backup heat is an electric heating element, which becomes expensive again because electric heat is not cheap. if you are in a northern cold climate that sees many days below zero this is not ideal. propane or natural gas as a backup would be the most ideal, but that would require changing the furnace, and your landlord probably doesn't want to fork over the dough again to call a plumber/hvac guy again.  Your best bet is to have a chat with him, but if I were in your shoes I wouldn't deal with the hassle and just move before the winter months come."

I can't see solar being anything but abundant and cutting edge ten years from now, but I would have told you the same ten years ago. It's likely going to be a semi specialized field."
electricians,3bleww,sonicjesus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:55:37 2015 UTC,"I work mainly in residential with some commercial jobs here and there. We live in a very rural town so off-grid systems and solar power are quite common. I think solar is an excellent part of the trade. The mounts for holding the panels are getting easier to work with (metal roofs are easier than composite shingles). As far as I know about grid inter-tie systems, it can be a lot of paperwork and several phone calls to your local utility company but it is doable. My personal favorite is setting up a battery bank which the house runs off of. You use primarily solar to charge your batteries and trickle charge off the grid on cloudy days. It means your customers have virtually no electric bill and if the grid goes down, they're still rocking. As someone who aspires to be a residential and commercial electrical contractor, the only negative thing I have to say about solar is simply that (at least in my state) you can get a license to do solar without needing an electrical license. This means that I see lots of hack work done by solar installers who have no business being inside of a panel. Other than that, there is little else as gratifying as firing up a new solar system and telling your customer they get to make their own power from now on."
electricians,3bleww,Smoke_Stack707,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:17:35 2015 UTC,Man that's exactly what I'd like to do. I guess you still have an edge over installers in that you can still do other electrical work

I chose electricity and electronics. The next 4 years is specialized teaching, and when we're 18 we are licensed electricians.  This gives us a whole bunch of theoretic knowledge, but our practical workout is handled when we start working.  The moment you're 18 you can also decide to add 4 more years to become engineer."

In Tennessee, you can take the Journeyman exam, limited licensed electrician exam or master electricians exam anytime after your 18th birthday.  In Virginia, a minimum of 5 years experience is required before taking the test.  Here in the US, we also have the IBEW, which is an electrical union with apprenticeship programs such as the one you described.

First couple of weeks nothing but pulling cable, tagging them, putting grounds everywhere, installing and connecting the simple stuff first, then grow from there. I personally didn't have a steady coworker the first 2 years I worked at my firm, and that's kinda annoying, because you'll be doing the same jobs over and over and won't learn that much.  I'm now outsourced with 2 colleagues who took me under their wing an I've learned and gained a lot, which I'm forever grateful for.  Personally I like this system, although I can see the benefit in an apprenticeship like the US-system has because not all the electricians in Belgium have had the shared experiences from co-workers and are just thrown in the field with barely a clue what to do..."

You learn all the basics, and then you look for a place that will hire you as an apprentice. During this time, you can get financial help from the government.. around 450-650$ a month, depending on if you live with your parents, or on your own etc. You get hired as an apprentice, and from that point it takes 3.5 years. You work 37 hours a week, and you have 6 weeks of vacation to spend a year (7 of the days, your boss can tell you when to take). During those 3.5 years, you go to school 4 times - for about 7-10 weeks pr. trip. During this time, you only go to school. For about 30-35 hours a week, and you get payed for 37 hours of regular work. If you are under 25, the pay is something like 9$ an hour when you start, and as you complete each of the ""school-trips"", you get payed more. If you are over 25, you get at least ~16$ an hour.

Though those steps are optional and you could stay as a apprentice for as long as you'd like. Also time in college / vocational school can substitute time worked as an apprentice. HOWEVER this doesn't mean you are a licensed electrician in all states. Only the state you work in and any state they have an agreement with.   So, for instance, I was an apprentice in Oklahoma. I could not use my experience in Maine. I would almost have to start right back over again. This was what I was told anyway and after I got laid off for the second time I moved to maintenance.

electricians,3bj326,Tallguystrongman,2,Wed Jul 1 06:36:03 2015 UTC,"its politics, each states electrical board, or department of labor negotiates with   different states and tries to get them to reciprocate each others licenses. i was told for a while when we moved to the (then current) 2011 NEC other states were still on the 2005 nec, because the state didn't want to accept the added cost of requiring arc fault breakers, or something along those lines. My state wouldn't want a licensed individual who isn't familiar with the newest code to work here, and they wouldn't accept our licensed electricians, because we won't reciprocate with them."
electricians,3bj326,2dumb2knowbetter,4,Thu Jul 2 03:08:22 2015 UTC,"Im going to try to explain this best I can.  In the USA, everything about a professional license is controlled by the state you live in. SOME states divide it down the government jurisdiction even more wherein a city or a county in that state might control the licenses for that city or county.   Most areas in the US require 4 years of school. That can be an apprenticeship, a paid trade school, or college. Most areas require 4 years of experience before taking the test to become a journeyman electrician. Some require up to six, some require even more.   There is no national US journeyman's or master's license. This means if you are working on a military base, in a territory, or something else not part of the 50 states that is US owned, you only need to be qualified.   NFPA 70E (NEC - our national electrical code) only states that the person conducting electrical work be a qualified person. So this means if you have installed switchgear for 10 years, never attended school, never got a formal license, you are able and probably qualified to work on switchgear and other electrical system pieces.   States that are near each other have this thing called reciprocity. If your license is good in one state, the neighboring state CAN accept it per their requirements. So when (as was posted by someone else here) you work in Maine and get a license there, New Hampshire and Vermont probably will accept it. If you go to Oklahoma, they give you a pat on the back but thats it.   Your Labor Union can give you a journeyman's card and allow you to work for them in their jurisdiction after completing their apprenticeship. If you leave that jurisdiction you need to sign up with the Labor Union of that jurisdiction and sometimes that isnt easy.   Most licenses work that way in the US. Its hard to explain but the requirements are basically the same 4 - 6 years, your ass is owned, after that you can get all the paper you want and need and everything is great.   In the US as well, you can buy a license if you know the right person. I hate to post it like that, but I know ""master electricians"" that dont know anything about trades but have a family member that own a company, or someone who needs them to be a ""qualified person"" for business reasons."

The minimum require time before you can take the class A journeymen test here is 48 months 4 years A class A Masters license requirement is 60 months 5 years You can start working for a contractor right away and have your time accrue and take the test, or you can do 2 years of trade school, which counts as 12 months experience, and work 36 months 3 years after school and take the test.    Minnesota used to have the requirement listed as 8,00 hours to take the journeyman's test (with a maximum of 2,000 hours towards yours license per year). For example if you worked 3,500 hours, only 2,000 would count towards the license for that year. A couple years ago they changed it over to months instead of hours, I'm not sure the reason why they changed.    There are reciprocity agreements with other states that recognize the Minnesota license which include: Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming South Dakota used to allow their journeymen's license to be taken 1 year sooner than Minnesota's. I had a friend go take his journeyman's test there, and it reciprocated over to Minnesota, which allowed him to be licensed in MN, and get a nice pay raise. No longer however South Dakota since has changed their licensing to the same as MN (4 years).  There was a master electrician that worked at my former company who moved to Souix Falls South Dakota, and although the State reciprocated his license, the city required him to take their own test to be a licensed Master Electrician.

During these months you can study nights one day a week for 20 weeks each year for 3 years.  Or you can do day classes for 20 weeks once a day. As you progress through your theory knowledge in your last year you sit an Electricians Regulations exam.  Then in 5 months you sit your electricians theory exam. Pass those exams and get your workbook of ""sign offs"" completed for your on job study and you can apply for your registration as an electrician and work on your own from that point on.    Source: currently about to start my last year as an electrical apprentice. Any questions I'd be happy to answer."

You can't just add a new ground in the barn without it being connected to the house. If you were to get a surge or major ground fault, the fault could go through the ground and up through the other ground at your barn and completely mess up either one of these units.  There have been lots of problems over the last number of years because guys aren't properly being taught when to bond, or when to ground. So they just pound a ground rod in because they think it's protecting their equipment, and it's because of the ground rod that their equipment ends up getting ruined when something goes wrong.   Under ideal circumstances, you should be putting a small sub panel out there, or at least a 15A circuit that you can bond to, or when you're running your Ethernet cable, run a ground wire in the same conduit, because you shouldn't be direct burying Ethernet cable anyways."

I did a job at a fertilizer plant that had 2 cat 5's buried in pvc conduit that got struck by lightning the runs were over 100' and I had to pull it out, the cable smelled awful from being zapped. what are the reasons you wouldn't use direct burial cat 5? I would guess rodents, or having the conduit to pull for future work, anything else?"
electricians,3bladd,2dumb2knowbetter,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:24:12 2015 UTC,"Your ground and bonding system needs to be a completely interconnected.   Can you explain to a layman bonding system means? And what completely interconnected entails?  Right now, the barn has absolutely no power run to it at all.  (The budget for this is minimal. No one is putting a sub panel anywhere for this.)"
electricians,3bladd,ithinarine,2,Tue Jun 30 04:33:22 2015 UTC,"So the only thing in your house that is actually a ""ground wire"", is the main grounding wire going outside to either a ground plate or ground rods, or possibly a metallic water pipe system, depending on the age of the building.  Anything else in the house that is generally called a ""ground wire"", like all of your bare copper wires in any switch, plug, or light, is actually a bonding conductor, and all of those wires get bonded TO ground when it connects to the ground wire in your panel. In your main panel, all of your white neutral wires also get connected to that ground wire going out to your ground rods, and those are technically referred to as your grounded conductor.  So by adding a random other grounding source out in a barn is actually dangerous, because if it's not connected to the grounding system in your house, all you're actually doing is creating a possible path for electricity to flow TO if you do end up having a major fault.   The surge protectors that you linked need to get bonded to ground, and this would ideally be done by having the unit mounted right at the electrical panel. Is there a reason that the surge protector can't be mounted in the house, and have the Ethernet line out be the one going to the barn, instead of putting there surge protector in the barn?"

Regarding your question, the only reason is my own ignorance. That's why I asked the question:   Is there any reason to prefer the outdoor surge protector over the indoor surge protector?   Although there is a slight confusion here, I was thinking of placing the outdoor surge protector outside the house, not outside the barn. Only because it seemed better to me to stop the surge before it enters the house.  The indoor surge protector is cheaper and easier, I just wanted to make sure it was as effective."

electricians,3bkxau,moshjeier,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:54:49 2015 UTC,That looks like the switch that was already in the wall for the light. Did the fan come with an in-wall switch or a little black remote? If the fan came with a little black remote you need to make sure the DIP switches are the same on both the remote (usually in the battery cover) and on the receiver. You will also need to make sure that your wall switch is always in the on position otherwise there will be no current flowing to the fan itself (you may just want to wire nut the red and black wires together and either throw a wireless wall switch in there or just put a blank plate over the junction.)  If it came with an in-wall switch you'll need to swap out the switch in the wall with the one that came from the fan because the switch in the wall doesn't know how to communicate with the fan remote sensor.

electricians,3bk34y,cvstealth,2,Mon Jun 29 21:34:26 2015 UTC,"300.7(B) requires all conductors of the same circuit to be in the same raceway, cord, cable, etc.  So if you are indeed feeding a sub panel, while it would be half-ass to run the SE through flex, I believe it would be legal.  The real question is how exactly are you feeding this sub panel?  You state that the meter needs to be pulled for hookup.  If it's a sub panel, then you would be feeding downstream from the main breaker, no need to pull the meter, just shut the breaker off.  If you are feeding from the line side of the main breaker, then you would have another service coming into your building and the so-called sub panel would now be another main panel and subject to all the service disconnect and bonding rules."
electricians,3bk34y,kidcharm86,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:11:28 2015 UTC,"From the meter into the house are 2 SER cables (2 hots for phases and 1 bare for util ground/neutral) that go to 2 200 amp main panels.  The plan was to install a CH2125 breaker in 1 of those main panels then pull the feeder lines to the sub panel.  I couldn't find the 4 wire cable so went with 3 wire SER + 1 wire 0/1 for neutral to supply the sub. I'm trying to find a way to salvage the cable that I have and not eat 400 bucks worth of copper cable. In reference to pulling the meter that was more for my own comfort level to not have any hot going into the house as 0/1 wire isn't the most flexible to work with. There is no main service disconnect between the meter base and the mains, just the breakers in the mains to cut power to the bus bars."
electricians,3bk34y,kidcharm86,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:00:12 2015 UTC,Gotcha.  I think you would be fine putting everything into flex.  Make sure you use plastic bushings on both flex connectors.  Why such big wire?  You could have gotten away with #2 copper.

electricians,3biemx,joekovar,3,Tue Jun 30 14:05:21 2015 UTC,"It is odd but not the reason for the tripping and not necessarily dangerous. I'd bet the AC unit has (or had) a note on the plug requiring it to be the only single thing on the circuit, meaning it pulls close to 15 amps. If anything else is on that same circuit, especially something with a higher load then it'll trip a 15 amp breaker as it should. ie. not an electrical problem. If you have two AC units on same circuit it's not surprising it would trip the breaker as it's too much of a load.  An option would be to upgrade the AC circuit to 20 amp which would give it some more headroom, but that will require new larger wires run to everything on that circuit. Optimally you'd want to run dedicated outlets to each unit."

Our electrical code doesn't like that because we don't want anything possibly shorting into the house that has 200A unbreakered. The third bottom neutral lead is either too long, or not in properly. Prefer to have feeds come in symmetrically.  No lines cross the middle. Prefer to have higher ampacity loads at the top, fed closer to the center. Prefer to have service loops kept above the panel in consistent and neat 8"" loops D-shaped up in the floor-joist space rather than in the panel. turn all of your 4004s so that the cable comes in through the back.  This keeps everything straighter and less twisty coming in. when you trim outer jacket, it needs to be neater.  It looks like your method is to slice lengthwise and then rip or slice with the wires off to the side.  It's messy. some terminated conductors aren't labelled.  What are they?  In the wall?   Over-all, that's a nice panel.  It's better than what most folks see in 100A residential panels.  I believe you can do better, and I'm hoping this helps.  Good luck."
electricians,3bgpct,redditmoose,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:46:05 2015 UTC,can you use L16 for ROMEX in residential or do you have to use 4004s? Im in Ontario
electricians,3bgpct,JaysFan96,2,Wed Jul 1 01:08:46 2015 UTC,"L16's are acceptable to code, but they're the wrong tool for the job.  They're a few times more expensive, more potential to damage the wire, and heavier and bulkier to carry in and out.  Some people like metal 4004's.  They're about 10% cheaper than plastic ones, but heavier, and more likely to pinch, and more time consuming to put in.  To be clear, they need to grip the wire without damaging the outer jacket substantially."
electricians,3bgpct,redditmoose,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:32:25 2015 UTC,I'm hearing you can't use L16 because people over tighten them whereas you can't over tighten 4004s thanks for the advice

electricians,3bgpct,JaysFan96,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:51:24 2015 UTC,"I only see three items of improvement, two being code related the other just AHJ around where i live.  So the ground wires should be on separate screws on the ground bar.  Not sure where you are so local codes may not require them to be separated.  When having multi wires under each screw they can sometimes not make good contact.  So if i were doing this panel i would purchase one or two larger ground bars and attach them to the panel.  The multi-wire circuit needs a handle tie or a two pole breaker as i think someone else noted too.  Also you have to be careful when using wire sheathing for labels as they have paper inside of them.  Having said paper right up against the screws of a breaker can be a hazard.  If the breaker arcs and flashes it could ignite the paper within the sheath.  There is a code about no flammable materials within a breaker box.  have had one hard nosed inspector that always has us relabel the panel otherwise.  So as to not create this situation.  Looks like a good first panel, better than my first i am sure, keep it up."

electricians,3bgpct,Shustriy,0,Tue Jun 30 04:13:07 2015 UTC,"First panel looks ok.    My opinion, I think you need to square things off a little more, service loops are completely overrated and violate an NEC code, and the tags written on the jacket make it look cluttered.  Other than that, I see a multiwire branch circuit missing a handle tie and they look to be on the same leg.  Looks good man, keep it up.  You will find your method that you like and will make your own improvements that will end up being your signature."
electricians,3bgpct,lookatthatsquirrel,2,Mon Jun 29 02:04:21 2015 UTC,"The tags are there only because my boss took the panel cover elsewhere so it wouldn't get lost on the jobsite. He didn't quite ask me to do that. But I didn't feel like sitting there finding out the circuits that I ran myself all over again. I intend to cut them off when I get the panel cover back.  The loops were suggested by my boss just in case they needed to move anything in the panel. (I feel like it might have been just to make sure I didn't cut off too much wire in case I screwed up, and he had to fix it, I'm kind of a first year apprentice so I understand) but in my future panels, I'll be more confident, and I'll avoid the service loops.   Which one is it that's missing the handle tie? As as far as I can see the 30's and 40's are handle tied. And all of the single pole 20's are their own circuits."
electricians,3bgpct,lookatthatsquirrel,0,Mon Jun 29 02:15:02 2015 UTC,"Service loops are a very old school way of thinking. The old code used to say that you couldn't have wirenuts in the panel, but we have beaten that to death and proved that it is legal.   Of all the panels I have made up and added to in 20 years, I have maybe needed to move 3-5 wires.  That is why I say they are overrated.    I understand the jacket left on there for the time being, I would rather just see cardboard or something else having the legend scribbled on it. Your way is much safer, not likely to toss out the jacket until you are ready.   Check the lower right for hood/fridge.  When you see a small red in the panel, you know it has a black nearby that it is paired to. I may be wrong.   Again, looks good for your first panel.   Edit: Want to join in why you guys are downvoting this?  I would love to hear some more constructive critisism on this matter.  What is it that you don't like?  Come back and tell me please?!?!"

Just another question, the way the fridge/hood fan is run (I didn't run this homerun myself, but I saw how it was wired), the 3-wire is brought to the hood fan box, then a 2-wire is connected to the black and brought down to the fridge. Is this legal? And does this need a handle tie?"
electricians,3bgpct,djscottymiami,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:55:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a multiwire branch circuit and it needs a handle tie. You need to break both poles.  I'm going off of NEC but I'm sure CEC is the same. Someone else could quote you the article."

electricians,3bgpct,Imaelectrician,0,Mon Jun 29 04:20:25 2015 UTC,"Our code says 2-pole or approved handle tie.  We are very similar.  I seem to remember the difference of our codes was that you don't need them with 3-phase, but do need them with single phase."
electricians,3bgpct,jadesmoke,4,Mon Jun 29 04:23:07 2015 UTC,"The only time the inspector ever makes us use a 2 pole breaker or a handle tie is if both circuits terminate onto the same device, if it's just going out to a different device then they don't require us to."
electricians,3bgpct,Tallguystrongman,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:28:55 2015 UTC,"This guy is right, in Canada you can use single pole breakers for 3 wire split feeds such as for a fridge/microwave or anything really. But they shouldn't be on the same half of the service that's for sure. In this case though you must be sure the returns can't be broken at any device when the device is removed."
electricians,3bgpct,AnarchistElectrician,0,Tue Jun 30 23:48:04 2015 UTC,You don't have to have a 2 pole breaker with that cct.  It can be 2 seperate single poles because it's 2 seperate loads.  I can't remeber the rule either but if you have a 2 hots on one load they have to be internally tied together so an overload on one leg will trip both sides.  A tie bar won't do that.  Also you can't branch off from the hood fan to the fridge here.  You have to go to the fridge first then branch off to the hood fan

electricians,3bd9g3,g_core18,4,Sun Jun 28 03:25:40 2015 UTC,This is called yellow 77. It is used for pulling wire through conduit (pipe) and other tight fits. It works very well but does have some drawbacks. It does dry in pipe overtime and faster during certain environmental conditions like weather and humidity. Using this stuff can almost guarantee the wire staying in the pipe after 5+ years if a lot was used. It's very messy as well and will dye your hands and leave the smell with them. End of the day I don't know a good electrician out there that wouldn't use this though. It just works.

And it can be tricky sometimes to use in overhead pulls because of how liquidity it is it'll slide right off your hand before the wire can grab it into the pipe.

electricians,3bd9g3,IrishDemon,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:33:02 2015 UTC,It is an outdated type of wire lube. There are so many better solutions out there now. For the most part the creation of the simpull coating made the need for lube go away. I remember being an apprentice slabbing on handfuls of yellow from a bucket. You had to keep every inch of the wire coated. Once the stuff drys in the pipe it becomes tacky and makes it very difficult to remove the wire.

I used something similar when I worked in the maritime industry mooring ships. You honestly don't even have to wrap all the conductors individually since the more tension on the rope the tighter it binds down on whatever you tie it around. Then you simply pull the tail out after you got where you need and it falls apart one two three.

electricians,3bcujq,Jim-Jones,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:05:07 2015 UTC,I can't see a bike being powered on less than one HP.   I'd think more like 200 - 250 watts. Even 1/4 or 1/3 HP would seem enough.
electricians,3bcujq,sonicjesus,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:55:53 2015 UTC,"Chainsaw motors typically have about 2 hp and they are barely strong enough to power a bike. Even the first generation Harleys had 7 hp, and they were basically bicycles with motors on them."
electricians,3bcujq,Jim-Jones,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:00:11 2015 UTC,"As I watch the Tour they occasionally display a rider's instantaneous power output on the screen.  They are able to do this because the cyclist has a power meter on their bike and this transmits data to the broadcasting network.  So just like the TED can monitor my home's power consumption, the bicycle power meter measures a cyclist's power production.  This power usually ranges anywhere between 250 Watts if they are just cruising along with the pack, or 400-500 Watts if they are pushing hard up a steep climb.   These are athletes."
electricians,3bcujq,sonicjesus,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:09:58 2015 UTC,"Are you sure the polarity is correct? Just because there's male/female connections doesn't mean they are the right ones. Do the wires or circuit board indicate polarity? I would assume they use a diode to prevent reversal, but that's not a guarantee. It may be defective, I wouldn't expect the controller to do anything until connected to the motor."
electricians,3bc5tm,Bluecrabby,3,Sat Jun 27 20:39:46 2015 UTC,"These things go bad often, could just be a dead GFI that needs replaced.  Most electricians limit One GFI per circuit unless they feed through (line/line) on some for whatever reason.  This will probably happen more often now with the new self test GFI's they've had to start producing this year.  Some of the older GFI's could be defective and still feed through power.  I'm not sure of the percentage of people that checks these things as they recommend but I bet it's pretty low.  My scroll bar hates me, I had missed where you had already replaced it.  The other gent is probably dead on with water in the exterior receptacle unless you possibly didn't hook the GFI up correctly?  (Same wires on Line/Load)."
electricians,3bc5tm,anadate,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:36:09 2015 UTC,Install was the same as the previous outlet.  Water in the exterior receptacle seems to be the most logical choice.  The three different GFCI are all on separate circuits.
electricians,3bc5tm,Encryptid,2,Sun Jun 28 00:03:34 2015 UTC,"It's GFCI...  Most likely there is an exterior outlet tied to the same protected circuit that has gotten water in it. Homes built between 75 and 95 got this treatment a lot, whether it was code legal or not. The issue arising after rain leads me to start outside and see if those outlets are on the same circuit and if they got water (even a little) on them."

They can be in the garage, outside, behind something, a place you would never expect. I'd check your house all over for a tripped gfci. And then if that isn't it, wait till thing dry out. Also I'm not a professional so this is just things I've previously come across."
electricians,3bc5tm,hardman52,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:54:54 2015 UTC,Ya there are three gfci in the house.  The other two are not tripped.  I've checked every outlet twice over and that's all there is.
electricians,3bc5tm,hardman52,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:03:47 2015 UTC,Are you saying that one GFI is feeding another? Or that there's an exterior outlet on the tripped GFI circuit that OP doesn't know about? I think the latter is the most likely. OP needs to check all the outside and garage outlets to see if any are dead.

I am in MD and quite a hike from you. I just googled Denver electrical board and found that site.  If you can install all of the wiring in the building and get it inspected, that involves the panel as well.  If you are working with the power company on this, they may require a licensed electrician to do the work.    My suggestion to you, wait for someone here from your area to join in, or 2, call a few ''electricians'' not engineers monday morning and see what they think.

electricians,3bamc8,havingafiresale,6,Sat Jun 27 11:02:13 2015 UTC,Very slim chance of using the existing wire as a fish. It either goes through holes in floor joists or it is probably stapled. Sounds like it would likely be easy to fish a new one though
electricians,3bamc8,jadesmoke,3,Sat Jun 27 12:23:27 2015 UTC,I agree. You'd have to be very lucky to have this work.
electricians,3bamc8,Jim-Jones,4,Sat Jun 27 13:43:56 2015 UTC,This is the only reason why I like the 1940 homes with that nasty cloth 2 conductor. It's usually just coming through the top plate from a light box and has no staples. I managed a complete service rebuild and rewire in a day with just 1 helper. The 800sqft helped.
electricians,3bamc8,Radar_Monkey,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:42:55 2015 UTC,"Ah, ok. Was hoping to make it easy on myself but sounds like this won't work out.   Also realized that it is grounded, just no neutral. Which I guess is fairly common for a dryer hookup. So I'm just going to extend the current line and then figure out how to run a new line for a fridge I want to put down there."
electricians,3bamc8,wirez62,0,Sun Jun 28 11:18:35 2015 UTC,"Is your current dryer wired with 10/3? Black, red, white, ground? That's the only kind of dryer plate I've ever seen but I've never seen old stuff either. If you have standard 10/3 and can't pull it out and want to move a few feet over Id splice a new 10/3 in your existing dryer box and put a 4 11/16"" blank cover on it, just don't ever drywall over it if you choose to finish that part of the basement. Full size fridges probably should have a dedicated 15A circuit, they have to in 2012 CEC in kitchens, for a basement I don't know if you can probably get away with tapping off a rarely used basement receptacle circuit .."
electricians,3bamc8,almost_a_troll,2,Sun Jun 28 14:52:29 2015 UTC,"8/2, actually. I ended up getting a piece of 8/2 and extending it similar to what you suggested. Ideally we'd have a 4 wire but it sounds like 3 wire is still quite common and perfectly safe for dryers.   I think we are going to tap onto a rarely used breaker for a fridge/freezer. Neither myself nor my wife want to -- but limited options and worse things have been done."

electricians,3bamc8,wirez62,2,Mon Jun 29 05:59:50 2015 UTC,"Unless the initial installer didn't bother supporting the existing sure anywhere, using the existing wire to fish it through the wall would be pretty impossible/not worth the effort. If the existing wire has some play maybe you could try it, but if it hangs up in the middle of the pull you may make your life a lot harder. If I were you, I'd just use my fish tape and just feed a fresh new 10/3 through the walls and then down into your breaker box."
electricians,3bamc8,WantAndAble,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:47:11 2015 UTC,"Have a picture of your panel? I'm just wondering if it's recessed in drywall. The existing cable is probably stapled to a stud somewhere above the panel (close) that would be the biggest obstacle I think. And of course the gamble it's stapled between floor joists. But otherwise my impression of residential rough ins is your just drill and pull, with a stable above each box. So it might work if you can free the wire above the panel."
electricians,3bamc8,perotech,2,Sat Jun 27 13:53:21 2015 UTC,Staples every 5 feet is canadian code. Is it the same in US? Most of the time fishing like this would be virtually impossible.
electricians,3bamc8,Lukemnukem97,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:55:56 2015 UTC,Isn't it within 300mm of the box then 1m every staple after that?
electricians,3bamc8,wirez62,3,Sat Jun 27 22:03:08 2015 UTC,CEC says 300mm before entering any box and 1.5 metres during the run of the wire. Going through wood counts as supports as well
electricians,3bamc8,WantAndAble,2,Sat Jun 27 22:45:38 2015 UTC,"this  so basically in most resi you staple at each box/panel. I've only done 1 wood frame hotel and some remodel on a wood frame multi tenant and a few times had to fish with existing wire. usually we mangle a box out of the wall, roughed in boxes are NOT meant to be removed lol but with minor damage and a bit of frustration you can usually get them. then pry the staple out from inside the stud and hope for the best (no random added stapled in random locations through the run)"
electricians,3bamc8,wirez62,2,Sun Jun 28 06:07:49 2015 UTC,"The rule is within 30cm of the box and then every 1.5m after that. One foot is .3 meters, so 5 feet is the same thing. That is CEC.  Edit: oops, just replied out of my inbox, didn't see it was already answered!"

electricians,3ba8s0,merl2,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:06:02 2015 UTC,It sounds like there might be a bad connection on the power company's end. I would call you're provider and tell them you're lights are flickering. They will come out and check their connections.
electricians,3ba8s0,Schecter91,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:42:17 2015 UTC,"It's probably your electrical provider... You might have them check your service and all of its service drops, it's possible there's some sort of loose connection there. If everything looks normal all in all, then it very well could be that the energy provisions themselves are not adequate at the moment. I know the town I live in has many flickering lights south of town because where they're producing the energy for that is provided to that area of town is not up to par with the sudden population boom. Being that this sounds like a problem that has come on suddenly though, I'd imagine it's more related to something going on within your property, potentially just with your service.   Make sure your connections are all tight before you go and call the local energy provider. It might save you money."
electricians,3ba40a,Shit-Just-Got-Epic,3,Sat Jun 27 06:04:47 2015 UTC,"They all need to be interconnected in Canada too. But you are able to get wireless ones now that only need a 120V power source, and you pair them to talk to each other wirelessly.   I would also call a local inspector. I'm in Alberta and got an email about 2 months ago saying that we're going to be required to have a detector on each floor, PLUS one in every bedroom.   Also, any detectors on a floor that have bedrooms, or some form of gas burning appliance (fireplace, stove, furnace, etc), need to be smoke/co combination detectors. You also need an extra one in your furnace room if it is framed separately from the rest of the living area of the floor it is located on.   Edit: I'm not sure if your house has a basement, you didn't mention in your post, but if it does and you were hoping to get away with not having to add one down there because you weren't doing work down there, be completely prepared to be asked to add them in the basement too."
electricians,3ba40a,ithinarine,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:36:01 2015 UTC,"There is a basement. As far as I know the inspector only asked for two, but I might as well put a third one in. Interconnecting the third one would be a royal pain though.   It almost seems like you wouldn't want all the smoke alarms to go off at once in the place. Like if there was actually a problem you would think it would be safer to know what floor of the house it is on."
electricians,3ba40a,imperfectcarpet,3,Sat Jun 27 15:06:37 2015 UTC,"If there's a fire in the third floor or attic, you'd be better off knowing as soon as possible if you live in the basement. And hearing an alarm from a floor or two away doesn't tell you what floor it is on."
electricians,3ba40a,Jim-Jones,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:21:28 2015 UTC,The basement isn't livable space. The ceiling is only like 6 feet or so. Do you think the inspector would have a problem if the basement wasn't interlocked? The house is fairly small and you would still hear it from the basement if you were on the top floor.

If you're ever doing a job where the 4 seconds you saved on the conductor stripping actually mattered, you let me know.    Also, who cares if you score the conductor if it's going into a lug... not an issue.    The only place this tool would make a difference would be working with URD and other high voltage semi-con where scoring the pink insulation means you have to sand it out or there is the potential for voltage tracking."
electricians,3b94zb,_Ceddy_,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:19:00 2015 UTC,"once you use it on a consistent basis, it wont take over three seconds. if it does, you're doing it wrong lol.  ....and after using it a few times for a whole day, i just feel like its easier to spin a handle with one finger than digging into insulation and ripping, along with having blades that dull way faster.  but, that's just my opinion :-D"

electricians,3b9ima,ACDCbaggs,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:47:05 2015 UTC,I meant pinched.  Check the durability of the studs for hanging the TV.  I would make sure the open side is facing in and try to secure at least 3/4 plywood in between the studs. Metal studs are not great for hanging tvs.

electricians,3b9ima,wirez62,2,Sun Jun 28 13:33:53 2015 UTC,"Here's an idea.    Frame an opening in the wall the slightly smaller than the size of the TV.  In the opening mount an outlet box sideways in the wall. For example if the outlet will be on the bottom of the opening the receptacles will face up.  Then use corner bead and mud and finish the opening. Paint the wall.  Now cut a piece of plywood to fit the hole almost exactly. and paint to match the wall.  Mount this piece of plywood to the studs with hinges on one side. Use hidden hinges.  Cut a hole in the plywood to have access to the plugs on the back of the TV for HDMI, Antenna, and so forth. Also drill mounting holes in the plywood to mount the TV. Mount the TV to the plywood and swing open the plywood and bring your power and DVD and PS4 and HDMI cables into the wall through the hole you cut in the plywood.  Plug your TV in.  Cut a hole in the bottom stud framing the hole large enough to drop the needed cables down to where your DVD or PS4 will sit. If you want to be really anal you can run a piece of 1 1/2 PVC from the TV mounting hole to the small hole lower in the wall and just drop your cables down the pipe.  Make a small hole in the wall behind DVD Player or PS4 directly below the hole you made in the bottom horizontal stud that frames the TV access hole that you can open or close as needed to gain access to cables running up to the TV through the wall.   But if you really want to celebrate your proud Canadian heritage you can do like Red Green and just duct tape the SOB to the wall and call it a day."

Sending you home and paying you for it (if not mandatory where you live) makes you slightly happier to work for him, and you'll likely be happy to pay it back through flexibility when he needs someone urgently.

electricians,3b9e08,SheepShaggerNZ,3,Sun Jun 28 00:31:37 2015 UTC,Depends where you live. In Australia and NZ low voltage is classed as exceeding 50V ac or 120V ripple free DC but not exceeding 1000V ac or 1500V dc.
electricians,3b9e08,lookatthatsquirrel,2,Sat Jun 27 06:50:43 2015 UTC,And if you go on wikipedia it says the same thing.  I have never met an electrician in real life that refered to anything between 120-600 as low voltage.  Low voltage is less than 120 VAC

electricians,3b9e08,Jim-Jones,2,Sun Jun 28 00:20:46 2015 UTC,"Personal hospital TVs maybe. Back in the day they had them which got 24VAC over the coax connection. They were fixed over an anglepoise mount, and rented, and individually rented to bedridden patients. I managed to get a couple of them, and modified them to take direct DC in, and they ran fine from 12V. Another had a 24 to 120V transformer. I bypassed that to take 120V the normal way.  You can get smaller modern LCD TVs which use separate power bricks, which have 15V or so out."

electricians,3b7i6d,KTKM,2,Fri Jun 26 16:24:15 2015 UTC,You can buy a decent soldering iron at a hardware store for $10 on which you can adjust the temperature. These extremely cheap Chinese tools are rarely ever good. Best to spend a bit more money once instead of having to buy the same tool over and over again.
electricians,3b7i6d,gp353,2,Fri Jun 26 18:07:05 2015 UTC,"One suggestion: if you're just learning to solder, and it sounds like you are, get one in which you can find replacement tips. 40w is just fine."
electricians,3b7i6d,logosogol,2,Fri Jun 26 20:38:12 2015 UTC,40 W is OK for 20 # but for 14 # I'd want more - maybe a solder gun.
electricians,3b7i6d,Jim-Jones,2,Fri Jun 26 22:12:13 2015 UTC,With #14 I like to have at least a 60W iron but it really depends on what your soldering to. 40watts can be just enough for some connectors but not enough for others. Its all about how much mass you need to bring up to temp.  Note that the one you linked is for 220v yet looks like it has an edison plug on it.   Assuming your in north america and find a 110v version at that price and order a few of them. That is cheaper than the tips for my entry level weller.   The stuff you buy at the store for $10 is the same thing you find on alliexpress for $1. The main difference being that if its no good at all you can bring it back to the store and there is some accountability. Its not until you get into the brandname irons that are like $50+ that you see any real improvement in quality.   The other thing is that if you order direct from china its not likely to have any regulatory inspection or approval. So if it burns your house down the insurance companies may find you liable.
electricians,3b7i6d,LordGarak,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:11:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah I noticed the ones on Amazon for $10-$20 look the same as the chinese ones on ebay and aliexpress.   I'm not from the US, I need the EU plug and 220v, don't worry about it, every solder I saw has several versions.  I'm going to solder outside (don't want to breath the fumes) anyway so even if it will start to melt or burn in my hand it won't burn anything.  I'll get a 60W with adjustable temps, thanks for tip.   BTW, is ground pin in the connector even important here?"
electricians,3b7i6d,LordGarak,2,Sat Jun 27 10:20:50 2015 UTC,Its highly unlikely that one would ever burn or start a fire. Its just if it ever did you might be up shit creek where as with an approved one insurance would cover you.   I've never seen an iron with ground. All the parts you should touch are insulated. The metal parts are thermally hot so I guess it doesn't matter if it was to become electrically hot. Generally the rule is if the case is metal it needs a ground so that if the hot wire broke loose inside it would short to ground rather than making the case electrically hot.

electricians,3b56aq,Wasitgoodforyoutoo,2,Fri Jun 26 01:39:54 2015 UTC,"How hard is it to get into the trade without knowing somebody? From what I've heard you have to be somebodys brother or cousin to even have a shot (at least in CA).    That really depends. I can't vouch for the union side of things but the non union side it is entirely based on how busy things are and the need for workers.    What kind of hours do electricians work?     It's different everywhere. I know lots of guys who worked 40 hours a week, I personally worked around 80 a week my whole apprenticeship.    How rewarding of a job is it? The IBEW website says Journeymen $40/hour plus pension, insurance and 401k. This sounds great to me but how reasonable is it farther down the line? This segues into my last question below.    It's a well paying, in demand job, better than a lot of jobs out there.    How rewarding is it to run your own business as an independent contractor? I plan on marketing myself as a residential electrician when I make Journeyman and get my license. (On a personal aside I'm really just in it for the money/job security - by the time I'm in my 30's I want to have $300K+ in personal savings and just travel around, maybe buy some cheap land somewhere beautiful and live off-the-grid, working when I want too, and spending my life on cool hobbies. That's the dream anyway.)    That's a big dream. That would involve saving like 30k  a year for the next few years. As an apprentice I would say god luck with that. You may make 40 an hour as a journeyman but you make much much less as an apprentice     What kind of basic tools/equipment will I need starting out?    If you go union then they give you a lost. If not it would be best to ask your employer as some provide your basic tools."

It can be rewarding, but it takes the ability to ride the roller coaster of financial ups and downs. Your customers become your boss, but you can quit them anytime.  Best thing to do in business is build up a substantial rainy day fund. Start slow, only buy what you can pay cash for.  You'll need to learn the trade, and then learn the business. Best way to do that is to work for someone else. Work hard, be accountable to your word, and show up on time. Those skills are essential to moving up in the company,   hopefully you'll move up into the office to learn estimating, and supervisory skills. You can do this in 7-10 years, and then go into business for yourself. I always say 50% of what it takes to be a successful contractor is keep your word and show up on time."

electricians,3b4zco,almost_a_troll,2,Fri Jun 26 01:32:29 2015 UTC,"""If you don't have electrician's tools"".  They make it sound so complicated and specialized...  90% of the time, that's a few screwdrivers (or a multi-tip screwdriver), a pair of channel-locks, tape measure, a torpedo level, a pair of side cutters (aka Kleins) and diagonal cutters (aka dikes), wire strippers, a pocket knife, a pencil & notebook and maybe a ball hammer.  I probably forgot something but that's the gist of it.  Sure, we use a lot more than that including power tools, meters and a whole bunch of specialized tools but most of the time, on any given day, you won't reach further than those core tools and for union employers in particular, the power tools and specialist stuff is the employer's responsibility to provide.    You can probably find most of these in your household toolkit and use them to get started.  What you don't have (probably the side cutters, dikes and strippers), you can find fairly cheaply at a home improvement store to get you through your first month or two, at which point you'll probably find you want to buy tools that will work well for a long time to come.

The main question is how do you support it short of screwing it to the t-bar itself. Just make sure you aren't making any areas inaccessible.

I've done it before screwing a couple of 2x4s to the joist and screwing the fixture into the end of the 2x4's, through the tile. It makes one tile un-openable so you have to be careful that it's not a tile that will ever need to be opened. IIRC, I changed that 4x2 tile to 2 2x2 tiles when I did it."

electricians,3b3io0,shakadora,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:29:11 2015 UTC,"If you have a multi, it'll make it much easier. I'm European, so I'm not up-to-date with anything except Belgian code, but the circuit is pretty universal here.  Your switch (or new switch) should have 3 terminals, and you should have 3 wires arriving to the switch. Turn of the breaker, open the second switch, measure for continuitity (ohm-meter) between the wires leaving the good switch and arriving at the bad switch (use copper wire as extension between switch and meter if necessary). When you find two ends measuring zero ohms, you have a wire, you should find two of those (switch the good switch a couple times, you can get a fals couple 'through' the switch). At this point you have identified two wires(B and C) going to the other switch, and one wire (A) going to either the lamp or the fusebox.  Take the (repaired or new) switch and do the multimeter dance again. One terminal(A) will always give zero ohms to one of the other two when switched, the two others(B and C) will never give zero ohms to eachother.  attach wire A to terminal A on the switch, and B and C in whatever order, and it should work out.  Putting this stuff into words is quite annoying because I don't know your background and may make it sound like baby-talk, so ask away and please shout if I'm dumbing it down too much.   http://imgur.com/7C2dp5W is the circuit as it should be, if that helps. There's probably online info for how your brand of switch does the terminal placement"

You should be able to change the receptacle to match the plug.  Chances are that it has a groundwire in the cable.  Just pull the receptacle out of the wall and take a peek.

electricians,3b1d08,hawkens85,4,Thu Jun 25 11:34:05 2015 UTC,You should turn off the breaker that's feeding this panel and use a voltage tester on the bus bars the breakers plug into to confirm the power is off. Then it's fine to do whatever needs to be done in there.
electricians,3b1d08,robstoon,-1,Thu Jun 25 05:13:21 2015 UTC,"Sorry. this is only my second ever post on reddit. I meant to to put in the title that i have a better descriptionm\ of what i want done on imgur (I thought reddit would have a field for that like it does for text posts). Also, whats a bus bar? I've never worked inside a breaker panel before"
electricians,3b1d08,punch____,2,Thu Jun 25 05:18:21 2015 UTC,"In your case, the bus bars are the silver pieces that the breakers snap on to - they are being fed by the red and blue wires on each side  Edit: Also a bus bar on top for the neutral (white)  Edit2: Just in case, I should probably also state that you shouldn't touch those until you are sure the current fed to that panel is cut.  Edit3: Just call an electrician"
electricians,3b1d08,robstoon,2,Thu Jun 25 05:21:44 2015 UTC,"side question. I've done plenty of work with DC, and simple AC (hot, neutral, and ground). Why does the right breaker appear to have two connections on the rear, yet only one wire coming off of it? what are the bus bars? are they like the different phases of the electricity? I was trying to trace wires just for my own curiosity, and I was confused to find more than just hot, neutral, and ground coming in (back of panel, to the left)"
electricians,3b1d08,robstoon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:26:40 2015 UTC,"The bus bars are the bent metal parts that the breakers plug into. For 240V circuits you need two hot wires connected to opposite sides of the line. The voltage is 240V between the two hot wires and 120V between either hot and neutral. Single-pole breakers for 120V circuits only plug onto one bus bar, the double-pole breakers for 240V circuits plug onto both of them."
electricians,3b1d08,Radar_Monkey,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:42:21 2015 UTC,"That makes sense! Holy crap thats so cool! so the left half of the big breaker connects to the top bar, and the other half to the bottom bar, then the small breaker only needs to connect to the top bar (or vice-versa)? and would it matter for the small breaker which bar it tapped into? since its AC?"

electricians,3b1d08,almost_a_troll,0,Thu Jun 25 05:45:19 2015 UTC,"That's actually what I was thinking about doing. Originally, I just wanted to totally disconnect the heater, but leave the wires routed (maybe cap them with write nuts?) But now I'm thinking an extra breaker makes a lot more sense. I'm thinking I could move the single breaker over two spaces, since it has extra wire length, then add a second double throw breaker and shift the heater wires over. As for the amperage, if I know the horsepower, can't I just convert that into watts and divide by 240 volts?"
electricians,3b1d08,microwavedbulb,2,Thu Jun 25 06:18:13 2015 UTC,"I know the horsepower, can't I just convert that into watts and divide by 240 volts?   Not with just HP info, You'd also need to know the power factor of the motor because amperage is based off of the VA, which is a function of the cosin of the power factor angle. :-) For this reason, motors have a field on the name plate for FLA, or full load amps.  But, as /u/lookatthatsquirrel said, just leave it."

You can tell that this is a single phase panel here because there's only two bus bars. If it were a three phase panel, it would have three.   You can hook up a single phase panel to three phase power, and you'd know it's that if the voltage from bus to bus was a bit lower than expected, such as 208 volts instead of 240."

electricians,3aysu2,Jim-Jones,2,Wed Jun 24 16:30:49 2015 UTC,There is only one outlet in the master bath so I don't think so. The previous owners didn't seem to have any problems since they had their tv and stuff plugged into the same outlets I want to. The only thing that has changed since then is the installation of the GFI and some open grounds being fixed. I have checked all of those and they seem to be working properly.   Thanks for the reply

electricians,3aysu2,Jim-Jones,3,Wed Jun 24 17:38:20 2015 UTC,"OK. As done, your GFCI is not only protecting the bathroom outlet, it is also protecting all the other lights and outlets so anything on them can trip it."

I am comfortable working with this stuff as long as I have a guide to go off of if you have one to suggest.

electricians,3aysu2,FishPumpkin,3,Wed Jun 24 18:21:15 2015 UTC,"Is there a way that I can make it just protect the bathroom?    Sure. As I said, connect those pairs of wires with wirenuts and insert a couple of pieces of the same sort of wire (12 # should be safe) and run those to the LINE terminals (often the top pair). Leave the LOAD terminals unused.  But it wouldn't hurt to try to isolate what is causing the tripping. Heater? TV? Computer? This shouldn't be happening."
electricians,3aysu2,Jim-Jones,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:30:43 2015 UTC,"On the wall that has the tripping problem there is only a cable box, router and tv. I can plug two into one outlet with no problem but if I try to put the other in it trips instantly. If I plug all three in and don't the actual coax cable hooked up to either the box or the wall it works. If I connect the cable to either the box or the wall it trips instantly.   Its really weird."
electricians,3aysu2,ithinarine,4,Wed Jun 24 18:38:48 2015 UTC,If I connect the cable to either the box or the wall it trips instantly.    That's a very bad sign.

electricians,3ay6he,Tanky321,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:20:36 2015 UTC,"Those numbers are for the percentage of the protection.  You still need to use the right value for the #6 CU which is 55 amps from 310.15(B)(16) and as a feeder is allowed 60 amps from 240.4(B).  You can have it as a tap off of a 350 amp breaker, but can still only load it to 60 amps worth of value.  Your loads here all need to be factored at 125% before you can talk about wire size.

electricians,3axqnr,Farmboy76,4,Wed Jun 24 11:41:33 2015 UTC,There isn't really such thing as an electrical leak. That electricity would be turning into heat and burning your house down if that were the case. I'm guessing someone is stealing your power and you have faulty/old/crappy circuit breakers. The older they get the more often you will see false tripping.
electricians,3axqnr,MR_Fook,3,Wed Jun 24 11:39:28 2015 UTC,"Actually, story time. A fellow foreman of mine did a side job recently for a trailer park lot who was having the same problem as OP. Electric bills were really high, like OP, and whenever it rained really hard they'd lose a phase and have to reset the main breaker after the storm. Turns out wire was knicked underground (was some direct burial shit) and it was literally feeding LIVE voltage into the ground constantly without tripping because it was after their meter/before their main.  It'd finally trip the main because of various incoming voltage surges when it rained. When it wasn't SUPER rainy though, it didn't seem like there was any problem at all, just a super high bill. They had this problem for over a year too. Scary shit when you think someone could have walked over that spot when it was raining."

We've definitely learned electricity doesn't lie so where's the fault damnit!?!?!  To add to this he said he tested voltage on the main while it was on and he'd get the correct voltage off the breaker, then when he removed the meter feed wires completely off the main breaker in the panel, he'd get like 90v on one leg. Which he was completely flabergasted about for a while. Then when he finally figured out the problem all was right in the world again."

electricians,3axqnr,OstVonEden,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:35:21 2015 UTC,Something is causing a load.  Unplug everything and turn lights off and the put amp meter on your wires In panel to see where the current is going out at.  If nothing start plugging things in one at a time.  See if any appliance is bad and drawing abnormal current.  Depending on your housing set up it wouldn't be unlikely someone is leaching electric from you
electricians,3axqnr,RickGrimes13,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:28:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  How would I be able to tel; if someone is leaching electric?  Its an individual house but the houses are very close together (a few meters) like condos.  Each unit has its own meter and I dont see any cords running from my house to a neighbour.  Also, the breaks always have happened around the same time (about 8-9 PM).  I remember one happened on the very first day we moved in before we had any furniture yet so I dont think its an appliance."
electricians,3axqnr,ejkofusa,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:36:09 2015 UTC,If there are multiple meters it is possible that the meter is marked wrong and you are paying for someone else's meter. Turn your main breaker off. Get your electric bill and find the meter number on it. Check that meter and see if it is sill moving. If it is then call your electric company. Have them pull 'your' meter and see if your house has power with the meter pulled. If you do then the meters are marked wrong.  Source: Fixed this same problem a few times.
electricians,3axqnr,RickGrimes13,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:04:51 2015 UTC,"If it is tripping at a certain time that leads me to believe it is an overload,  not a short circuit.  That circuit is what I would be suspicious of. You only pay for electricity that goes through your meter.  So if someone is leaching it has to be done after the meter.  Do you have an amp meter? You can monitor the current on the circuit.  Are you in a single family home, duplex, condo, or apartment? By the way I am an electrician"
electricians,3axqnr,LT_lurker,2,Wed Jun 24 16:08:34 2015 UTC,Thanks.  Its a single family home.  I dont have an amp meter so I cant monitor the current.  I can say that it has tripped at times when no one was in the house at night so at a time when little power was being used.  The meter itself is quite confusing.  Its digital and has 9 modes with no way to tell if current is coming in.  I suspect that is not that actual meter we get billed on.  I am going to have to get in touch with an electrician but will try to get the power company itself to look into it tomorrow.

electricians,3avx9t,doccynical,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:35:36 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I started opening outlets and the two ceiling fixtures and testing them. Everything was coming up 120 so I threw a bulb back in and everything worked as expected. So I'm not sure what I did but it appears to be back to normal.  Just to elaborate, I also removed all of the load from that line after it happened (I had a UPS on my file server and networking equipment as well as a desktop) and the symptom was still present. It was only after I poked at one of the fixtures itself that it seemed to resolve itself. I say that because I don't feel like I did anything. But it's working now, so I guess something came loose?

electricians,3au7ng,YeahYeahYouWere,8,Tue Jun 23 15:27:04 2015 UTC,"How are you measuring the voltage?  if you're measuring it hot to switch leg, the resistance of the bulb will affect it.  The important thing is having the proper voltage at the socket, ie. hot to neutral.  If you are measuring hot to neutral and getting 95 volts, it could mean you're missing a neutral somewhere.  If you are getting 95 hot to neutral and hot to ground, something has gone very wrong."
electricians,3au7ng,coogie,2,Tue Jun 23 15:42:33 2015 UTC,"Hi coogie, I am measuring the voltage using an Innova 3320 auto-ranging digital multimeter, and I have been testing it by putting the leads in contact with the terminal screws on the switches.   I do not have the socket or a light bulb installed currently - I unhooked them when I ran out of time yesterday, and capped my hot wire at the can, making sure the switches were flipped so no voltage is running up there.  When I tested the voltage with the switches removed, I just put the multimeter leads on the black and white wires coming into the switch box."
electricians,3au7ng,ACDCbaggs,2,Tue Jun 23 15:59:39 2015 UTC,"He is right. You are missing a neutral. You need to do some more investigating. Find out exactly what is on the circuit and open it all up. Lights, switches, and receptacles.  It will take time, but that is your problem."

I don't expect to open up a receptacle or switch and find a floating neutral wire (though given the competence of the previous owner, I wouldn't rule it out...) so what should I be looking for?   I'm assuming it's probably going to be the outlet on the roof of the garage where the garage door open plugs in, but that is just Murphy's Law at work..."

electricians,3au7ng,coogie,2,Tue Jun 23 18:05:25 2015 UTC,"I was going through the circuit and checking all the connections, and frankly I think I am in over my head and will be calling my electrician. I was going to include pictures of everything, but I feel like that is asking a lot of you guys and frankly most of the boxes are super hard to get a good picture.  I did just re-test my new hallway switch, and I got the following reading...  COM -> same-side Traveler: 92V //// COM -> opposite Traveler: 0V (0.4V) ////  COM -> Ground Screw: 121V //// Traveler -> Traveler: 92V //// Opposite Traveler -> Ground Screw: 121V  I had added a pigtail from the ground in the box to the switch - there was no connection to the ground screw on the old switch.  Could that be the source of the problem?  Thanks again for all the help."
electricians,3au7ng,coogie,2,Tue Jun 23 19:23:10 2015 UTC,"No, the ground has nothing to do with things here other than safety.  It has nothing to do with current and working voltage in the fixture.  If you can't find it, I would just wait for the electrician to get there."

electricians,3au7ng,LT_lurker,2,Tue Jun 23 21:46:21 2015 UTC,"Well, when you touch the leads of the switch, you're not going to get the true voltage because one of the leads will be the hot coming out of the breaker (after a few stops probably) while your return path is going through the light bulb (ie. encounters resistance which slows down the electrons ie. voltage drop) and THEN finds its return path through the neutral.  That's why you should check the voltage against a true neutral.    By the way, is the light coming on?  Not sure why you're checking the voltage."
electricians,3au7ng,LT_lurker,2,Tue Jun 23 18:22:55 2015 UTC,The light was not working - I do not currently have the socket installed because it was not working so I capped the hot wire in the can and figured I would try to get everything else sorted out first.

electricians,3auu8m,DracoIgnus,2,Tue Jun 23 18:11:54 2015 UTC,"Well in BC you have two choices for apprenticeship. You can either go industrial electrician, or construction electrician. It's the same red seal at the end regardless, but industrial focuses on plc, troubleshooting and motors. the construction electrician focus is a blanket of basically everything. But this is where it really differs. The industrial program gives you a different ita number than construction and you need a sponsor such as a sawmill chain like westfraser or a mine to sponsor you. The problem with that is that most places hire internally and don't grab apprentices off the street, they only take journeyman. So it's hard to go that route. On the other hand you can get a ton of industrial experience doing construction and about third year you really get hands on expirience with plc work. I recommend applying to the Ibew."

As for the grounds, I would try to get both ground wires from the box spliced together properly with a pigtail going the plug. Based on your description they are sort of twisted together, but not making the best connection."
electricians,3av3gw,rig-electrician,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:26:50 2015 UTC,"Based on your description they are sort of twisted together, but not making the best connection.   Yes. The shortest ground only comes about an inch out of the wall. The longer one is maybe three inches of bare wire. Whomever previously wired the outlet took a third wire, lopped it around the first ground, roughly looped it onto the second groud, and then connected it to the ground on the outlet.  So (checking my understanding) I connect the first and second grounds inside a wire connector cap, and run a third wire from there to the GCFI's ground. Should I get electrical tape and wrap all the exposed wire? There two grounds are completely bare."
electricians,3av3gw,guitarEd182,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:27:11 2015 UTC,"Nope, the ground wire doesn't carry any current and doesn't need insulation. Doesn't come insulated in most types of multi wire cables."

You can have up to 6 jacks on a single gang wallplate.  T568A and T568B are two wiring configurations. If you use A, use A throughtout your house. If you use B, use B throughout your house. Don't mix and match.  Every jack throughout the house would run back to a single point where your router/switches will be. If you have more than 6 jacks in the house, I'd recommend using a patch panel at the central point.  If you are in the U.S., I almost always use monoprice for networking supplies and tools, good quality, low prices. I don't know if they ship to Norway though."

You will want to wire both ends the same, T-568B will be fine to use.  You shouldn't need many tools.  The only tool needed to punch down the wiring into the jacks is a punchdown tool.  You can get a pretty junky one for $9.99 (http://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters%C2%AE-Punch-Down-Impact-Blade/).  Since you're only using it once, don't buy a nice one.

The two wireing types are pretty much the same just one cable is switched, decide to use one of the two and then keep it this way.  I'd highly suggest you also get some sort of network tester ( to see if you correctly installed everthing)  http://www.clasohlson.com/no/Kroneverkt%C3%B8y/38-3337 LSA tool  http://www.clasohlson.com/no/Nettverkstester/38-3970 Cable tester to see if you wired it correct  The price seems pretty steep."

With every aspect of cat 7 being several times as expensive, there is no benefit for installing it in the op's home. Cat 6 is more than adequate for this type of install, and will easily handle 1000base T. Never mind the fact that a 10 gigabit NIC using copper is 3 to 10 times the price of a 1 gigabit NIC at $30...

electricians,3as0t9,Waltmarkers,2,Tue Jun 23 04:54:24 2015 UTC,That's a lot of half assery for one pic. Tell the idiot to at least replace the tile with a clear lens to prevent moisture from filling the empty space. It's $15 that will save him $50 in a year's time.

electricians,3armd3,bigtomjohnson,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:12:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I got every question answered in time and didn't find any of them too difficult.  Though, there were two math problems that were more complex I came back to at the end.      I didn't want to spend more than 30seconds on a question so I didn't take time away from the rest of them.   Plus, I would usually do a page at a time (about 6 questions) and then fill in those 6 on the test, so I didn't lose time going back and forth to fill in bubbles after each question.  I would not recommend this strategy as you near the end of the test and are close on time.  Last thing you want to do it is have a handful of questions done but not get them bubbled in at the end."
electricians,3armd3,JeremyR22,2,Tue Jun 23 01:19:17 2015 UTC,"They gave you fifty minutes for the math section?  That's nice!  I think (last November) I got 35 minutes for the thirty questions which put a real time pressure on that section.    Other than that, my experience matched yours.  We were allowed to have a watch on the table though, since there was no other clock in the room and it's important to keep track of your time in the math part to stop you getting bogged down, I'd highly recommend bringing one just in case you need it.   Absolutely the reading part is easy if you understand English as a first language or competently as a second language. You don't even have to absorb the information particularly.  The question book and the answer book are both on the table at the same time.  You can just skim read and then pick back over the text for questions you can't immediately answer.    Good luck!  If you feel good about it, you probably did well enough."
electricians,3armd3,FunkyMonk707,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:49:31 2015 UTC,You're spot on about bring a watch.  The proctor did say if your watch has a calculator to take it off.  I didn't know there was a clock in the room until after the first part of the test.       There was NO warning before the end of Time.  I think we did get less time for the math section (Reading was like 51 minutes) so maybe in the 40 someodd minute range.    We had 33 math and 36 reading if irc.      You're spot on with the Reading as well.  After the first reading section I more just skimmed the paragraphs then jumped to the questions.  It also helped to read the reading questions FIRST so you knew what to look for in the actual text.

I recently applied for a position with CSX (railroad) and there was an online aptitude test you had to take along with your application submission that went over a lot of what you described.  Pictures of gear  and pulley systems, torque and several, and other basic mechanical principles.

If I were given that task I would start with the service entry feed to the first main and then double lug it onto a secondary main panel. Each one of those COULD (still not great but...) support one extra panel around 50-60A. At this point you need to think of how many breakers do you need in a house? How much wire are you going to run out of each box total? Are you going to buy good quality panels with lugs rated for paralleling wire? Adding a sub panel is one thing, adding another 42 breakers to a house is another. If you have THAT much load in a house that you need to expand to that, consider lowering existing loads before expanding by doing simpler things like LED lighting, new air handler/ heat pump, and direct on off control (switch) of regularly plugged in electronics. Remember this is your house not a server farm, its your garage not an industrial park. You only need so many circuits."

You could easily run all of your lighting off of it by making sure it is 12 LED, and a few general purpose outlets to charge phones and stuff. But you're not going to be able to put in full sized stove, fridge, microwave and dishwasher in that thing, it's just not going to happen.   Propane fridge, propane stove, everything else is an unnecessary luxury. Use laundromats to wash your clothes, hand wash your dishes, a microwave is almost a guaranteed no as almost all of them are 1000W or higher.

I'm kind of busy to do the math, but feel free to do so yourself - even if you got a fancy Tesla Battery, and an inverter, you'd still likely never charge up everything unless you get 5 or 6 panels which are made for houses."
electricians,3ap284,coogie,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:39:46 2015 UTC,"You don't mention your location, which makes it impossible to determine a correctly sized system. But we can make some estimates... You need 10kWh/day (not counting weekends), plus a 10kWh battery bank (assuming 100% efficiency, but it still works for back of the envelope). I'll pretend you're in Denver, CO, for a fairly average solar insolation... you'd need about 3kW of solar panels to get that much power May-September. You won't have enough left over for weekends, nor will you have enough in Spring, Fall, or Winter.  This is about  250 square feet of solar panels, and with a DIY install, $5000 is not unreasonable, although it won't be easy.  A barely adequate sealed lead acid battery bank will run you another $2k or so, but realistically you'd need something more like $3k-$4k to be able to handle cloudy days and not completely murder your batteries. This is only about 500lb-1000lb, and not a particularly cumbersome size. You'd likely need to replace them after a few years."

electricians,3aocbp,pete_the_penguin,2,Mon Jun 22 04:10:31 2015 UTC,"Picture of the A/C controls please. Also A/C label with current draw.  I bet your thermostat is shot.  There's an ugly ass way to get something to work, well, 2 ways.  You can use a cheapo power remote like this Wireless IR Remote Control 10 m Power Adapter Socket Made for AC 110-120 US Volt and just plug a heavy duty relay into that. The remote controls the relay and the relay controls the 240 volt power.  A relay like this Idec RR2P-UL Relay AC120V Coil 8-Pin Octal 10 Amp 120VAC/240VAC will probably do it. You need a short extension cord for the A/C. It runs through a box with the relay inside, wired so the relay breaks the hot wire. Also, pick up a dollar store 2 wire extension cord, cut off the socket, wire that to the coil and then that plugs into the remote control.  You have a remote controlled 240 volt extension cord. Solved.  You could also leave out the remote and relay, just run a heavy 2 wire to a switch in another box and put that close to the bed etc. Not as nice."

But for sure wire should be supported, and it isn't supposed to touch ducts (or water pipes) in case they run hot. You can buy approved clips for wire.   As for knob and tube, that's very tricky. Really, you shouldn't touch it. There is no special tape, but if stuck there's a type called self-amalgamating or self-fusing tape. It's black rubber with a separating layer you remove as you go. Once it touches itself it fuses together to make a good seal. The plastic stuff isn't very reliable. It tends to come apart."

I left most of the knob it tube that didn't have any non Knob and tube splices.

electricians,3am6sl,lookatthatsquirrel,3,Sun Jun 21 16:42:35 2015 UTC,"If you are using 7.5 amps on something rated for 10, you are pushing too close to the threshold for that supply.  80% is normally a limit on most things that supply electricity, you are at 75%.  Pretty close.  I would suggest splitting the loads up."
electricians,3am6sl,Vehudur,2,Sun Jun 21 16:56:14 2015 UTC,"It CAN handle that load, for a short time. But electronics are not designed for their maximum possible load all the time, and should only run at about 80% - you're right at about 75 or 80%, so you're right at the limit of its long term load."

If everything is perfect, maybe it's OK. The reality is that if everything is perfect, it's just good enough. You're usually safer with a bigger gauge and a bigger safety margin. BTW to me, 1 sq mm is light for 10 amps.  And that voltage drop is way high IMO.  It isn't Chinese made is it? ""Guangdong Province: Where we put lead in everything except your pencil""."

Also, from the voltage drop: R = V/I, so R = 10V/(1700W/230V) = 1.35Ω. Again, I'm no electrician, but 1.35Ω of cable resistance on a 2m run seems a bit much for loads of this size."

electricians,3akkr9,6matguy6,5,Sun Jun 21 02:51:46 2015 UTC,"I've heard that before as well. From what I read, rigid pvc can't be used where enclosed in thermal insulation. That's 12-1102. but that would be the only restriction I could find. I'll keep looking and get back to you."

I'm feeding a subpanel and the customer ran 2 x 2"" PVC conduits from his main, up into the attic and then down to the sub. One for data and one for power.. They are supported above the blown in insulation and separated from the insulation down the wall as well. So from the comments in this thread mixed with the local guys telling me the 5 foot rule, I'm starting to get the idea it'll be an inspectors decision at the end of the day."
electricians,3akkr9,Rokman2012,2,Sun Jun 21 10:46:55 2015 UTC,"That's funny, how we learn certain 'rules' that aren't rules...  I too had heard of the 5' rule for PVC and was assured, by the inspector in that area, that I was wrong.   If it's not run in a wall cavity that 'has the expectation of being filled with thermal insulation' and is clipped properly, it should by fine.   My experience with it was a prefab home came delivered with the meter base and panel (and all the subsequent feeds) on the wrong side. I had to put on a meter base outside and run new PVC (across the ceiling of the, non insulated, basement) to the panel. It was fine."

electricians,3akkr9,wirez62,2,Sun Jun 21 03:31:13 2015 UTC,"I can't think of anything that would disallow it. The only things I've found remotely related are:   Appendix B - Rule 2-128: The flame spread requirement for totally enclosed non-metallic raceways is located in Article 3.1.5.20 of the National Building Code of Canada. The National Building Code of Canada permits the use of totally enclosed non-metallic raceways for wires and cables, provided that the totally enclosed non-metallic raceways do not exceed 175 mm in outside diameter, or equivalent cross-sectional area, and conform to the vertical flame test requirement specified in Clause 6.16 of CSA C22.2 No. 211.0. The marking on totally enclosed non-metallic raceways to indicate compliance with the above flame test is “FT4”.   And this part of the building code is also mentioned in appendix G, but it seems redundant to the passage I quoted above:   3.1.5.20., Combustible raceways in noncombustible buildings   A search for ""1.5 m"" in section 12 didn't turn up anything interesting either..."
electricians,3akkr9,Jim-Jones,2,Sun Jun 21 05:42:34 2015 UTC,I've heard it too and don't know why. Maybe it's in the fire code/building code. Something about PVC giving toxic fumes in a fire.

You say I shouldn't touch light fictures and pipes, what does that mean? What kind of pipes, I didn't even know they passed electricity? And could I get a huge shock from turning on the lights?"
electricians,3ajrd0,Old_Man_Shea,3,Sun Jun 21 01:03:57 2015 UTC,"Your ipad and phone charger are most likely plastic with no ground, they are ""safe"" to touch. Don't touch wallplates fixtures and pipes. the pipes they are referring to are your water pipes more so your cold, but who knows in your situation. I wouldn't touch any exposed metal pipes (heating and water) as they are used commonly as a ground. Definitely get an electrician on this as it is not only a MAJOR safety hazard, but a serous fire hazard as well."
electricians,3ajrd0,sonicjesus,2,Sun Jun 21 01:14:01 2015 UTC,"Anything metal has a potential to cause a shock in this instance. Copper pipes in your house are unlikely, but possible. You might get a zap from the metal screws on a lightswitch, or the body of an air conditioner, refrigerator, or washing machine. You should definitely have this looked into as soon as you can. I really don't recommend taking a shower or bath, especially if you have old fashioned porcelain tubs, as they are actually iron on the inside."
electricians,3ajrd0,Jim-Jones,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:26:34 2015 UTC,"Try to wear socks, shoes, or stand on carpet when touching anything. Even dry newspaper is safer than barefoot on stone. If you stand on a plastic mat and only touch things with one hand you're pretty safe - we work on live circuits that way (sometimes).  But repairs are needed and not by some fool that doesn't know what he is doing. How do you heat hot water?"
electricians,3ajrd0,sonicjesus,3,Sun Jun 21 15:09:23 2015 UTC,"Also, do not get in a shower or bathtub. If this is related to your refrigerator, the problem will only happen intermittently and without warning."
electricians,3ajrd0,FishPumpkin,5,Sun Jun 21 00:54:09 2015 UTC,"Is this a momentary shock or a continuous ""vibrating"" shock? If it's momentary then it's just static, but a continuous shock could be a sign of a grounding issue."

However, the refrigerator is not always giving shocks but it could be that I just don't hit the metal.   I thought about grounding issues as well. I live in Spain and my apartment is quite old (we have 11mb internet cap and use gas for cooking and warm water) and I just got a toast machine, I think it was about the time these shocks started coming. My roommate feels it to, so it's not just me. I just hope it's not a fire hazard."
electricians,3ajrd0,FishPumpkin,3,Sun Jun 21 00:36:23 2015 UTC,"This sounds a lot more like a grounding problem than static. It could be a fire hazard, and it definitely has the potential to be dangerous (since Spain runs 220 volts). I would contact a qualified electrician and your landlord before proceeding, and it might be a good idea to turn off the power altogether until you get a second opinion. A bad neutral connection or miswired receptacles can cause similar issues, and both of these can be dangerous."

electricians,3ak4dd,sonicjesus,6,Sun Jun 21 09:44:07 2015 UTC,"That button is THE test per NEC  I've heard GFCI testers test between the load and ground, where an actual GFCI trip is caused by an imbalance between the load and neutral. So an older one wire conversion might not always trip via tester."

electricians,3ak4dd,jtt123,2,Sun Jun 21 11:25:01 2015 UTC,"The integrated test button on the device or the breaker is the only proper test method.  The plug in testers will not trip a GFCI device if it does not have a valid ground.  The plug in testers simulate a short to ground.  If it has no where to go, it will appear faulty.  That said, as an electrician, I'm usually not satisfied with the integrated test button and like to make the device trip using the GFCI test feature on my Fluke meter by grounding to something else nearby if needed.  The breakers call also be tested at the panel this way."

If it does, then all you have to do is make sure your turbine alternator can produce an output within those tolerances.  If it can't, then you may want to rectify it to DC and run it through a DC-DC conversion stage, feeding straight to the battery."

electricians,3akvpl,robstoon,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:13:49 2015 UTC,"Some outlets have a release slot that you can jam something into to make it let go of the wires, but a lot of them don't. You're not really going to get them out by pulling - if there's no release you likely just have to cut the wires off and re-strip them."

electricians,3akvpl,Jim-Jones,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:05:05 2015 UTC,Alongside the socket for the wire there should be a slot. A tiny screwdriver or blade pushed in there should release the wire. Obviously power off is a good plan!
electricians,3akvpl,djpyro,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:24:04 2015 UTC,"The black wire goes on the brass colored terminal (the left one in the picture of the new outlet).  The white goes on the other terminal, the ground goes on the bottom screw.  It doesn't matter what screw you use, they are both the same.  You can also use the holes (either one) if you want to back stab the outlet instead of the screw.  For your switch, it looks like your old one is a 3-way so the new one you have is the right one.  Look at the back of the switch for the common leg, either marked 'common' or 'c'.  Transfer that wire to the new switch.  The other 2 wires can be put on either remaining terminal.  If you put it on the wrong one, the switch will just be upside down, either flip the switch or change the wires.  Ground can go up or down.  The thought is that with the ground up, nothing can contact the hot conductor if something falls down the wall.  It will hit the ground first.  It's still something you see today, it's basically up to you."

electricians,3aj6bt,Lian_Yu,4,Sat Jun 20 18:34:30 2015 UTC,"It depends on a few things: how you are moving here (work visa, vacationing, or married to a US citizen), what you know, the company that hires you. I haven't dealt with the visa process since having a relationship with an Aussie girl in the 90's, but I'm sure it's only gotten messier since then. If you're not able to obtain a social security number or the equivalent that shows you're legally allowed to work here, the rest of the list doesn't much matter as you'll be working under the table/cash only. If you can show that you're legal, next comes what you know. While your qualifications are helpful, I don't see you starting out as a journeyman unless you're an extremely fast learner and can remove all of that metric nonsense from your head. Commercial work can be anything from tiny stores, large malls, dentist offices, dog groomers, 6 story hotels, and everything in between, so that will be dictated by the economy of where you're looking to work. Unless the area is booming, you'll need one hell of a resume and an even stronger personality to beat out the other 100 to 1000 people that were looking for the same work before you showed up.  In theory, you could start working under the table the day you get off of the plane, but not knowing where in the US you're going, what you know, or how fast you can learn/unlearn, it's really hard to say. More than likely, you'll be out of work longer than you want or expect to be unless you've got friends in the right places."
electricians,3aj6bt,IrishDemon,2,Sat Jun 20 20:34:50 2015 UTC,"I can tell you that I tried the same thing about 10 years ago. It really isn't as easy as you would think.  I found that if I wanted to work in a Northern state (one that is Union controlled) you had little to no chance of getting work. When I applied to the Union in NY I received a letter in return telling me there is a 3 year wait and after that 3 year wait I would have to enter as an Apprentice. If I wanted to work in a State in the south things would be easier (non Union) however I realise that physics doesn't change when you cross the Atlantic but materials, terminology and installation methods drastically do...  Electrical materials that you are used to in the UK don't exist in the US, there is no plastic cable containment, no PVC trunking or PVC conduit. Hell, trunking rarely exists in any form in the US. Terminology is also very different BX instead of Kopex, Romex instead of Twin and Earth, receptacles instead of socket outlets, ect. Installation methods are very, very different from the UK, installing electrics is the US needs a completely different mindset to the UK. When you install something in the UK you install it with the idea that the installation will outlast you, in the US, installation is designed around speed and efficiency of installation and that it will probably be torn down and replaced in 30 years.   If you did move to the US starting again as an apprentice is probably not a bad thing...."

He's an indentured apprentice and just has to collect his 8k hours and then test for his license. As far as his pay goes I'm pretty certain he gets paid as a journeyman.

Then I link the neutral of the compressor back to the board.
electricians,3ai038,H2own,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:58:57 2015 UTC,"If you are switching to using that Lae controller I advise you take the live and neutral cables from the 240v side of the controller and bring the live into 6 and neutral into 7. Then take the live for the compressor control circuit into 5 on the controller. You shouldn't require any other terminals on that controller for the system. You will have to replace the probe too as the existing one is PTC and the Lae requires an NTC probe.   To use the DFx instead feed the 240v live into 4, neutral into 2 and the compressor circuit live from 1. You may or may not have to run a new probe for the DFx as it does not specify PTC or NTC.

If you're looking to break into industrial, even the PLC courses at BCIT are a great asset but don't get you a ticket.

electricians,3ahifg,Baron_of_Berlin,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:56:08 2015 UTC,"How did it happen:  could be any of a number of things.  From corrosion or a weak connection on that Molex connector, to something in the circuit drawing way too much current (motor bound, heating element shorting to ground, or so on).  What NOT to do:  Do not fix this board.  When the boards burn to the point where the epoxy carbonizes, you are generally screwed.  That part of the board becomes conductive.  You need to cut out all of the bad, replace it with epoxy/fiberglass, and re-drill for components and replace the traces with wires, if you can even identify where they were.  That Molex connector needs to be replaced, and perhaps the pushbuttons.  Attempting to repair this board is a VERY DANGEROUS PROSPECT.  As someone with no experience, don't start here.  Fire hazard extraordinaire.  Appliance parts are generally readily available.  I did a quick look for you, but came up dry for this part for that model number.  But, I just casually checked a couple of parts stores; dig deeper, and you'll find it.  Regarding the OTHER half of that connector, you can probably get the wiring harness, too.  Replacing it may be a nightmare; not sure how it is run in the machine.  You'd be better off buying the connector from Newark or Mouser or Digi-Key or wherever, and replacing it.  You'll need the right kind of crimp tool for those pins.  Yeah, you have a doozy here.  I think you should just go shopping.  People remodel their appliances all the time; check craigslist for a good used one.  By the way, dishwashers are generally fairly inexpensive.  The last one I bought for my office was something like $100!  I got it at Best Buy.  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news on this one, and I wish you luck."
electricians,3ahifg,Techwood111,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:17:09 2015 UTC,"As I said, I did find the part on ebay to purchase (only place I saw it), but trying to avoid spending the $40.00.

I'm not at all concerned with aesthetics here."
electricians,3ahifg,Techwood111,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:23:14 2015 UTC,"Knock yourself out, tiger.  You asked for opinions, and I gave you my qualified one.  If you insist, be sure to use suitable gauge wire for the connections.  Use some perf board; don't hang this stuff in the air.  Solder well.  Don't screw up.  Try to identify the failure point; trace the circuit that failed, and with the schematics/wiring diagram for the machine, use your noggin to isolate the candidates and test them.  But, be smart and buy the damned thing for $40 and move on with your life.  You'll tie up a lot of time and money making something that may not work, and may be unsafe.  Next time, if you don't want opinions, please save others their time and don't ask for them."

In any case, I did decide to buy the replacement part I saw. You were also right in that I definitely need to replace the molex connector on the female side. I was wondering if you or anyone could guess which size of connector I would need to buy?  The following image shows the female side, in which the tubes measure approximately 5mm across. If it helps, the writing I could see on two of the wires in that connector said ""LL-31629 Type AWM 105*C VW-1"" and ""E-53035."" http://i.imgur.com/nL1zUNA.jpg"

For ampacity, specifically 400.5(A). Here's the breakdown:  http://www.stayonline.com/reference-circuit-ampacity.aspx  First off, S cord isn't rated for an install like that. NEC 400.7 lists allowed uses, 400.8 specifically bans:   Used as substitutes for the fixed wiring of a structure. Run through holes in walls, structural ceilings, suspended or dropped ceilings, or floors. Attached to building surfaces.   Second - whoever installed that used an outlet vs an inlet. Even if it were allowed, assuming it's a 10/4, under 50' it's rated for 25a only.  For 32 amps you will need to upsize to 8g wiring and use a 40a breaker. You do not use  portable cord for a permanent installation (as this is). This looks like a homeowner hack job."

electricians,3aenfm,thelirivalley,6,Fri Jun 19 14:36:31 2015 UTC,The fault lies with the person who got an extension cord instead of an electrician. It's a loose connection culprit unknown. Might not be a bad idea to use a better extension cord than the 16 AWG one you're using there or have an electrician properly install a dedicated circuit. Cord there is rated at 10 amps but with a continuous load like this it will be more stressing than something you only plug in an hour at a time. Extension cords aren't for permanent installation.
electricians,3aenfm,Xurples,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:42:19 2015 UTC,Cord there is rated at 10 amps   13 amps if it's a #16.
electricians,3aenfm,almost_a_troll,2,Sat Jun 20 03:29:22 2015 UTC,Bad cord. But often caused by clever people bending pins to make them 'tighter' which damages the socket. Cut off the socket AND the plug and replace both.
electricians,3aenfm,Jim-Jones,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:33:19 2015 UTC,Could have been caused by a loose connection. It's hard to tell without more info. What exactly was plugged into it? How many watts?

Thanks!"
electricians,3aenfm,Kil0volt,2,Fri Jun 19 15:06:25 2015 UTC,"To me, because of the fact that it only happened at that one point and not at the other end of the extension cord, it would appear that there was some sort of loose connection inside the female end of your extension cord. So I would say that the extension cord is to fault here."

electricians,3adcrw,VexingRaven,7,Fri Jun 19 04:56:13 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I believe this. There are 2 outlets within a couple feet of each other that are on different circuits? And they must have put a standard 15A 120v end on whatever 240v thing they are plugging in?
electricians,3adcrw,NimbleNibbler,4,Fri Jun 19 12:07:00 2015 UTC,"Counter plugs would work for this. 3 wire ones have 2 seperate circuits within an inch of each other and 20 amp ones could quite possibly be close to each other and on seperate circuits. As far as I can find online the power cord is the same since most power supplies accept 90-240v it wouldn't matter to it what the cord looked like. Stupid as hell to do this though, great way to fry things when someone plugs into it and doesn't know it's 240."
electricians,3adcrw,Imaelectrician,4,Fri Jun 19 14:32:08 2015 UTC,"While this can be true, it depends on how things are set up in the panel. They could be sharing the same leg of 110v, which won't give you 220v."

Are you saying that when you run pipe, you install a bonding bushing on every pipe in every box and run a jumper to maintain your ground?  What the hell is a ground tail for then?  How would a self-grounding receptacle work if the box that it is screwed to isn't a proper ground path?"
electricians,3ad19a,JohnProof,-1,Fri Jun 19 21:33:39 2015 UTC,"Nowhere in 250.118 does it say ""Raceway system"", or Enclosure, or Metal Box as an equipment grounding conductor. Furthermore it is referred to as ""raceway"" in 250.120 (Installation) not raceway system. 250.148 (C) is what requires the grounding of a metal box to the equipment grounding conductor, so yes, I read it as using grounding bushings to maintain continuity.

There is an irrefutable list of suitable equipment grounding conductors in the NEC, 250.118 and boxes are not on it. So a box connected with listed fittings is considered bonded, does that make a box an equipment grounding conductor or a bonding jumper? What if it's screwed into stainless steel wall with a listed bonding screw is the wall now an equipment grounding conductor? If yes then 250.118 needs amended."

Some of the people in my intake had some construction industry experience and some had worked as helpers for electricians but we all went back to square one when we were indentured.  The argument can be made that it's better for apprenticeship programs to take people in assuming no knowledge whatsoever, giving them control over the quality of the apprentice's entire education, than it is to make assumptions about what they may or may not have learned elsewhere based on qualifications they don't control and end up having their program disrupted by having to teach things they assumed their apprentices knew."

electricians,3aao1h,ModernRonin,-3,Fri Jun 19 00:34:37 2015 UTC,"WARINNG: I am not even an Apprentice. I am taking the aptitude test in early July. Treat my advice accordingly.  Why do you need a GFCI/RCD? You've already got galvanic isolation because of the transformer. That's the other thing transformers do (besides changing voltage) - they block any DC current from flowing between the primary side and the secondary side. Only AC current makes it across an xfmr.1  A plain old 3A/120V slow-blow fuse on the primary side should be fine, functionally speaking. Now I seriously doubt that's code, so if you're trying to stick to code don't do it that way. But as far as protecting the transformer from burning up due to overcurrent, a fuse will do the job. (Also, some transformers have a built-in thermal fuse hidden under the plastic wrapping that covers the coils.)  Are you worried about the transformer failing as a short circuit between primary and secondary coil? And then feeding 120V straight into the 12V wiring? If you want to protect against that, I'd much rather see you properly earth the ground side of the 12V leg. Then a short across the transformer would go straight to ground, pop the breaker on the 120V side, and shut the whole thing down.     1 Okay, okay, maybe a single microamp of DC leakage current through the megaohm(s) of insulating varnish on the coils. But that's it!"
electricians,3ac0it,sykeros,3,Thu Jun 18 21:39:59 2015 UTC,The Lutron dimmer won't work with strips and the MODALIGHT MP82 is a terrible idea. You've gone a bit the wrong way. I'd exchange that Lutron for an on off switch.  I'd recommend a kit like this 5M RGB 3528 SMD 300 LED Non-Waterproof Light Strip+mini 24key IR+DC 12V 2A Power to begin. 44 key remote does more fading and waves etc.  However you can buy power packs for multiple strips and buy remote dimmers as well. You need 12 volts and also at least 2 amps per 5 meters (about 200 inches). More amps is OK.
electricians,3ac0it,Jim-Jones,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:44:25 2015 UTC,"Hmm, gotcha. Thanks for the recommendation, I'll take a look at those. And thanks for pointing out the modalight mistake, it's not even an 120VAC input... I think I had a brain fart scrolling through everything."
electricians,3ac0it,Jim-Jones,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:19:29 2015 UTC,it's not even an 120VAC input   It may run on 120 but it's a waste of money - it will do the wrong thing.
electricians,3ac0it,lookatthatsquirrel,2,Fri Jun 19 15:33:58 2015 UTC,You buy a transformer when you buy the strips.

electricians,3aawaa,Jim-Jones,2,Thu Jun 18 17:56:06 2015 UTC,Veteran turned electrician here.  NECA and IBEW have a partnered training program. The one that isn't accepting in your area right now.   Worked for an journeyman long time ago who went through IEC apprenticeship and he was very sharp. Went union after working for a while.  I completed IBEW apprenticeship and it was great for me.
electricians,3aawaa,alexm3g,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:24:35 2015 UTC,"NECA won't hire or train electricians.  NECA (National Electrical Contractors Assoc) is the organization for the signatory contractors that employ IBEW members.  IEC may be a good program but the glaring omission from their offering is wages and benefits.  Going through an education program that is only going to certify you to work for specific electrical companies for widely varying pay and benefits doesn't seem a good bargain to me.  I'm an IBEW guy and having the option to work in other locals across the country if needed is nice, without having to go through interviews and negotiate (or just swallow whatever wages they offer) pay and bennies.  I'd keep at the IBEW if being an electrician is what you want.  If they are light on bring apprentices in, they may only bring in the guys that have been working as helpers, etc.  See what they can offer regarding a pathway in."

Not quite sure how it happens in Canada, but you need to become a master electrician, get a business license, get insurance, and then find customers. You'll also need to establish a line of credit with a wholesaler/supply house, too.

electricians,3a81r9,Imaelectrician,3,Sat Jun 20 14:01:33 2015 UTC,"""I was thinking about starting my own business, because it seems extremely lucrative, and was wondering if anyone could tell me how much of an idiot i am and why.""   It can be very lucrative as long as you do well in said business. I opened my company up in the fall and I am doing fairly decent for myself. I'm in Saskatchewan though in an area that has very few electricians but a fairly high demand for electrical work. Just so you know starting a company isn't a walk in the park. You need to take it fairly seriously and try hard to make sure that you don't fail. Unless you are extremely lucky and get lots of work right off the bat, starting off sucks as you will often feel that you may starve to death or become homeless as it takes a while to establish a name for yourself and get business. Other than that it can be quite stressful dealing with customers as most customers are   1) idiots  2)think they know better than you because they once helped their uncle wire a garage 15 years ago  3)think that the customer is always right no matter what  4)hoarders  ""Obviously if it was so easy everyone would do it, so i must be missing something, but really, im wondering what guys do when they arent an employee.""  Some people open their own company, some pursue other trades of different schooling often related to the trade, some people sit on EI as long as they possibly can  "">How do you make money?""  By working. Often you will submit a estimate for a job and compete for the work against other electricians. Sometrimes you find a contractor that gives you all their work, that's one of your more ideal situations  ""  Is there a pricing guide somewhere?""  For the most part no. You simply have to figure it out for yourself. You figure out what material costs, estimate the amount of time in labour is involved and what that times worth to you. You factor in the cost of having a vehicle, insurance, possibly employees, having a shop or somewhere to store your tools and materials, the cost of upkeep on all your things and what you want to make for a profit. Then bid 9n jobs and hope you have the bid that gets accepted and that you don't screw up and lose money on the job.  ""What about sidejobs?  How do you go about getting them?""  Once you have a company it's no longer side jobs, it's your actual job. You advertise as much as you can afford to and make sure you do good work as word of mouth is your best advertising.  "" How do you bill?""  I use quick books to do all my billing, estimates, and general accounting.  "">If youre not a journeyman how do you make extra money?""  I would say do side jobs. If you have a journeyman you know well and trusts you that can pull permits then maybe you can do them legally which is much more preferable than doing unpermityed illegal work. I can help you here really, I had very steady work through my whole apprenticeship, I made 6 figures from the time I got out of my second year of school to the time I quit to start my own company.   Which on that note, it's not cheap to start a company, electrical tools and supplies cost a lot of money. The best advice I can give you is focus on your apprenticeship now and save as you go, you still have a fair bit of time before you need to worry about starting your own business."
electricians,3a81r9,Jim-Jones,0,Sat Jun 20 17:31:21 2015 UTC,"well, this was amazing.  thanks a lot, i really really appreciate a real answer :)  i hope you do well with your new company going forward.  Speaking of which, do you happen to need a highly motivated 2nd year apprentice?"

I have a friend who helps me when I really need help and I pay him in electrical work for his house."

electricians,3a6xwt,Hugh43,2,Wed Jun 17 19:34:08 2015 UTC,"Mike Holt is pretty popular, he has made money being a polarizing character.  He likes barbq and barefoot waterskiing.  He has a decent way of explaining things.  He is not the only authority on things, there are plenty of inspectors that don't agree with his way of thinking.  I personally wouldn't spend all of that money on his books.  I think you will have a hard time just learning our code without getting hands on the equipment and material we use here.  For instance, we don't use a lot of cord.  I have seen a lot of Australian installs and you have completely different materials than we do.  You need to learn what we have here before you can learn how our code relates to it.  I would go on Youtube and watch videos from Electrical Contractors Magazine.  Their site has some interesting videos on it sometimes to site NEC violations...the dude from Boston has a thick Boston accent.  Ave your money on the course stuff unless you are here and testing for your masters.  And then, just get the masters prep book."

(ie multiple conductors, each individually insulated, inside an additional insulation layer that groups them all (active/neutral/earth) together)  If so, I feel like it shouldn't be anything I couldn't work out with some time and Google-fu, but then that's probably me just not knowing what it is that I don't know.  Also, I believe my education/experience is equal to Journeyman, rather than masters, if that changes anything."

What I am saying is, to learn the NEC, you need to learn the materials and equipment first before the two correspond with each other.  Not saying you don't know what you are doing or how to safely and efficiently install electric in Australia, just that things are different here.    You will need hands on before you need to worry about books other than the codebook."

Then I would try and test out for local licence.  It is only from this group I know the little I do about ENG, EU, AUS, and CAN differences.

electricians,3a71pt,Techwood111,2,Thu Jun 18 17:30:45 2015 UTC,"No, it is noise of some sort.  Your meter is a low-impedance device.  Those odd ripples on the AC would in all likelihood disappear altogether with a load on the circuit.  Regarding your audio gear, there is no AC used with it, whatever it is.  The AC is rectified and filtered, becoming DC.  Frequency is irrelevant; the diodes will be faster than any oddity you see.  But, again, I wonder why you were even bothering to measure the frequency (and I question if you truly were even measuring frequency -- what the heck kind of multimeter has a built-in freq meter, anyway?).  I'd like to see the model number, as I'm quite curious about that.  The frequency is fixed by the utility -- the large generators they have crank out sine waves of 60Hz as a result of their rotation speed.  The service coming in to that facility is provided by the same lines that go to all the other buildings in the area.  The frequency on each of the three phases are assured to be identical -- they HAVE to be [excepting the phases that are either 120° or 180° shifted, for L1-L2-L3 for 3-phase or single-phase respectively.)"

electricians,3a7m9v,Jim-Jones,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:39:26 2015 UTC,"Many varieties of these are available in the US.  Simran SM-1875KIT International Worldwide Travel Kit with 5 Adapters, 1875-Watt Voltage Converter and Pouch.  These are OK for hair type appliances.

electricians,3a62oy,Hugh43,2,Wed Jun 17 14:50:48 2015 UTC,"How did you wire the cap in?  I can't believe an HPS would work, they usually need the electronic starting aid in the ballast to give it the pulse of high voltage to strike the arc."
electricians,3a62oy,XirallicBolts,5,Wed Jun 17 14:58:56 2015 UTC,"It's not a cap it's an osram fs-4 starter. It is wired into the outlet on the side of the adaptor. The starter is parallel with the lamp and it briefly shorts the ballast, creating the inductive kick to start it."

electricians,3a86y3,Jim-Jones,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:16:20 2015 UTC,There's a dozen things wrong with this.   Better: Low voltage LEDs with the power pack plugged into the wall outlet. You can do the shit he did if it's all run at 12 volts. I'd get a strip of white LEDs and do it that way.   This is overkill but the price is fine. You don't need colors or dimming or remote. You can cut these strips down to fit. Just try to buy one at a good price.

electricians,3a50qo,Hooks_And_Needles,2,Wed Jun 17 07:33:34 2015 UTC,"I'm an inside wireman apprentice but have uncle that's a lineman with PG&E (California). Just some things I've noticed. Yes pay and benefits are excellent. I went the union route, I'm not sure if he did or not, or started straight with PG&E. He can work some pretty crazy hours at all times of the day or night. He is on call a lot to, so if some drunk hits a pole at 3am, he is called out. He is compensated very well for stuff like that, but just remember don't expect a set schedule. Also as you know you're outside in the weather every time. Sun, rain, snow etc. keep that in mind. It's all high voltage, of course you are well trained but you work with energized lines all the time so there is always risk and this ain't a 120v wall outlet we are talking about. I forget the exact %, but something like 85% of the guys who get hit by high voltage, IF they survive, lose at least one limb in the process. Talking to him about is why I ended up doing inside wire for commercial. Set hours, generally not in the rain, and it's pretty rare to work with energized stuff these days. Hope this helps. Good luck!"

electricians,3a50qo,Alpha1998,2,Thu Jun 18 00:03:09 2015 UTC,"I currently work as a lineman apprentice and I love it! As others have said, you are out in the elements and can oftentimes have an irregular schedule. Generally if you work as a contractor (like I do) you have more stable hours. You spend more or your time constructing new lines and updating/repairing existing ones. We only get called out on late night storm damage once every couple months or so but that can vary depending on who you work for.  On the other hand, working for a utility or a cooperative is a little bit different. Some days you spend the whole day cleaning trucks/equipment or driving around and troubleshooting problems. Guys who work for utilities and cooperatives are usually the ones who are put on call to be available if/when there is an issue.  If you are from the North East I would look into the IBRW's NEAT (North Eastern Apprenticeship Training program) they are Union  contractors who get paid extremely well. A buddy of mine is currently in their apprenticeship and according to him it's a phenomenal experiences. The application process is a little bit rigorous and if you don't get hired right away I would recommend maybe working for a non Union contractor to gain actual work experience and reapply!  On a final note, if you are interested in this line of work you better be a hard worker and have thick skin. I have seen a number of people wash out of the program because they couldn't handle the physical workload and got upset when teased about it by Journeyman on their crew."

electricians,3a4ykl,cheeseds,2,Wed Jun 17 07:04:30 2015 UTC,"The main house ground in your EDIT photo is OK, but each outlet should be grounded back at the panel, rather than at the water pipe. The water pipe ""bond"" will work temporarily if you clamped it, but don't rely on it permanently. It looks like there is a ground wire in that NM (romex) cable entering the box, so you could try tracing the wire to see if it goes anywhere.  If you're showing voltage on your computer chassis, then you may have a more serious issue going on. Normally even a completely ungrounded computer shouldn't show any voltage from case to ground, so you either have a leaking PSU in your computer or the existing ""ground"" goes somewhere it shouldn't further up the circuit.   I would say you're right to get an electrician in sooner than later. (And don't replace any pipes in your house with plastic until the grounding is fixed.)"
electricians,3a4ykl,FishPumpkin,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:54:09 2015 UTC,"Electrical student here. No expert and I'm not going to give premature advice on proper grounding but I will tell you that all exposed aluminum needs protection from oxidization. Head down to your local electrical supplier and pick up a bottle of ""noalox."" that will prevent all the crusty stuff around the wire. I hope another professional can assist you with the rest. Until then, I'd keep that computer unplugged for the time being if at all possible"
electricians,3a4ykl,polaroppositebear,2,Wed Jun 17 11:01:57 2015 UTC,Probably wouldn't be a bad idea to replace the aluminum with a piece of solid copper. Aluminum in contact with copper may cause more corrosion because they are unlike metals. But that this is definetly NOT to say that this is a proper method of grounding.

electricians,3a4ykl,dennington111,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:27:55 2015 UTC,"Look at the picture of your outlet- see that bare copper wire in the box? That's a ground. That should be grounding that outlet.  What I would do is unplug everything in the house, and check all outlets for any voltage on the grounds. Plug things back in and check em again, try to isolate what device on what circuit is giving you that reading on ground.   I dunno though, all the masters are at work right now, lunch is coming up on the east cost in an hour though, ya might get a reply then. :-P"

electricians,3a4ykl,Hugh43,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:18:24 2015 UTC,"The 50 volts hot to ground is likely as a result of EMI filtering capacitors in some of the devices (like the computer) plugged into those outlets. If the ground isn't actually connected, then a small amount of current can flow through these capacitors to ground and cause a voltage reading. The available current is very low so it's not really a shock hazard, but you might be able to feel a bit of a tingle between metal parts or have operational problems like the computer crashing, etc. due to induced voltage."

electricians,3a15kq,Jim-Jones,18,Tue Jun 16 16:30:08 2015 UTC,Maybe the heat is causing a connections metal to expand which loosens it off the wire.
electricians,3a15kq,spirituallyinsane,2,Tue Jun 16 16:40:52 2015 UTC,"So, the screw for the neutral to one of the problematic breakers was at least somewhat loose, so I tightened it up.

electricians,3a15kq,Jim-Jones,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:25:34 2015 UTC,It could be a lose connection at the load as well.  Maybe there is a lose connection on the receptacle  Maybe there is a junction wire nutted together that is lose.

electricians,3a15kq,Jim-Jones,0,Tue Jun 16 23:08:04 2015 UTC,"Ok, thanks for this. So, I suppose I'm looking for something loose inside the panel? (since the panel is the part exposed to the heat). I guess technically it could be something inside too: an outlet, a switch, connections to a ceiling light/fan.  Though, since the inside has AC and the second floor has AC, I'm less inclined to think it could be that (except maybe an outlet on an exterior wall or something).  So, the plan: turn off power at meter, padlock switch, turn off master switch at breaker box, check box for loose connections, examine for any connections between the two breakers which are failing.  Failing that, start inspecting outlets, switches, and connections to other devices as time allows and/or have them call someone."

electricians,3a15kq,ACDCbaggs,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:17:20 2015 UTC,I'm really thinking the actual heat isn't the issue but what else is going on when its hot. The first thing you should look at it how it's wired in the panel. If there is any relation between the 2 breakers.

electricians,3a2yui,nevalk,4,Tue Jun 16 20:38:23 2015 UTC,"If they are GE lightbulbs check this out: http://www.consumeraffairs.com/homeowners/ge_light_bulbs.html Otherwise: bulbs can burn out quickly is if the voltage applied to them is higher than the expected voltage (120V). Wiring problems in the house, and bad transformers at the utility pole can cause the voltage to be out of spec. Another reason is if there is a loose connection somewhere, and the light flickers (causing unnecessary heating/cooling cycles). A third reason is if the light is in a confined space, and overheats.  In order to check the line voltage, you will need to use a voltmeter.  and you should try a few different outlets, since there are generally two different phases of power (not really phases, but opposite polarities, 180 degrees apart) going into a typical house, and you need to check both of them.  Identifying a bad connection is trickier. Generally, you would see flickering lights, but to be sure you would want to use an oscilloscope or spectrum analyzer (expensive equipment). Sometimes a bad switch will cause a short flicker when the light is turned on. Replacing the light switches with new high quality switches could help.  Finally, have you noticed that the bulbs go out more quickly in certain places? Are those places more confined, causing the bulbs to heat up more? If so, you need to use lower wattage lights (such as CFL, halogen, or less bright incandescents) so that the bulb is less hot.  LED lights, halogens, and CFLs are all more efficient than incandescent lights. For the same amount of light output, they use less electricity, and generate less waste heat (keeping them cooler). In order to check if they meet your needs, compare the light output (in lumens) to that of the bulbs you are currently using. Don't go by the ""equivalent"" rating (such as 60W equivalent).... The amount of heat generated is nearly proportional to the wattage of the bulb (generally between 10 and 25 W). Another thing to look at is the color temperature, as measured in Kelvins. More orange lights will be around 2700 K, while more blue (daylight) bulbs will be around 5000 K."
electricians,3a2yui,sst1,2,Tue Jun 16 20:54:35 2015 UTC,"you would want to use an oscilloscope or spectrum analyzer (expensive equipment).   I don't think I've ever heard of someone using either to diagnose a bad connection in a residential application. A logging multimeter or even a logging voltmeter with a fast enough refresh and a long period of monitoring will show if it's a utility or a customer side problem.    Sometimes a bad switch will cause a short flicker when the light is turned on. Replacing the light switches with new high quality switches could help.   If a switch is defective, just replacing it will help. The difference in quality between non graded, ""heavy duty"", and spec grade switches sold at the big box stores is negligible, and not worth the difference in price. It's also not the cause of incandescent and fluorescent light bulbs on different circuits burning out excessively fast at the OP's house.  There's something not right with the number of bulbs burning out as fast as they are, and it's not from a defective wall switch or the ambient temperature being too high.  Also, most people with incandescent fixtures are looking for soft white or bright white bulbs... daylight bulbs are too close to the color of fluorescent and are too harsh for use in the home."

electricians,3a2yui,stewtron89,2,Tue Jun 16 21:12:50 2015 UTC,"Fluorescents go out especially if you use them a lot. The blast needs to be replaced. This happens, if its original form 1990 totally normal. I would say outside outlet with a large load doesn't seem fishy to me 1200w divided by 120 volts equals 10 amps, But start up could push higher. 15amp circuits are normal by me for outside outlets, the are usually tapped on to a outlet circuit in the house and she be gfi protected either at the plug or in the panel. Outdoor gifts wear out. Also wet outdoor environments and that many amps consistently sounds like it could turn into a problem over time. Replacing the outlet and removing the cord when not in use is the best option to limit moisture in the outlet. Also the tub may require a dedicated circuit this should be specified in the manual. might have some sort or issue. Incandescents products a shit ton of heat and can mess with close wires and sockets. keep getting the warranty people  on it. 4.Wet/cold/heat lights don't last outside like they do inside. especially in extremes or at the coast. I think heat is an issue here. especially with multi bulb vanities. and when they heat up the filaments can be easily damaged by vibrations Depends on how much you use them, if only a few min a week this is a problem.   Hire a professional to check all connections in the panel are tight. Neutrals grounds and hots. Check the vanity light connections as well as the switch connections. I'm not seeing anything crazy here, but its hard to say not looking at the house. Some of my awsers may be a little off if you live somewhere its dry and 65 all year long."

electricians,39yhor,IrishDemon,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:40:46 2015 UTC,"In the documentation on every residential panel I've read the documentation for, they have no fire rating and I believe it actually specifies that there is no approved method for fire rating them. Typically what we have doe is furred out the wall so there is a fire rated wall in front of a non rated wall and put the panel in the non rated wall. We have also furred out a fire rated wall around a panel and used fire rated access doors.   edit:  Quoted from Eaton's documentation for their type BR and CH loadcenters:   Fire Rating Due to the numerous openings in both loadcenter boxes and trims, they should not be mounted in firewalls. There is no approval method for sealing the enclosures for this application.   I've never done it but I have seen panels wrapped with drywall to fire rate it. Depends on the AHJ if this is approved."

This is simply an added framing member inside the wall, horizontal between studs, just above the floor, and just below the ceiling.  These are just 2x4's, but the purpose is to slow drafts in the space above and below the panel, to slow the spread of fire.  Other thing could be, if the subpanel doesn't fill the entire width between the studs, a new opening would need to be framed, to be the proper width.  Hard to say for sure without seeing it.

Then go open up the receptacle where you've got no power. Just a guess here but I'll bet you had one of the wires, probably a neutral, pop out of a quick-connect hole in the back of the receptacle.   If you have loose wires inside the receptacle box you absolutely want to be sure there is no voltage present when you open it up.  If not that then I'm not sure where to look next."

The screws on either side are connected by a little jumper piece so terminating a wire on either screw electrically connects both screws on that side to the wire so it makes no difference which screw you terminate to.  I would next check the other 2 receptacles in the room, again looking for loose wires."
electricians,39zajb,microwavedbulb,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:27:10 2015 UTC,I opened up both and made sure every wire was connected correctly.

You should probably pull a separate circuit for the disposal to meet code, but I don't see why everything in your diagram can't be run off one 20A circuit.

I thought that was what you had to technically do, but I didn't figure ~40 watts of LED lights would make a difference (other than a technicality). Looks like I'll be installing those half-size circuit breakers because I'm almost out of space in my box!  Glad you pointed out that my romex layout wouldn't make sense! For my learning sake, let's pretend that the garbage disposal just a simple outlet controlled by a switch and doesn't have to be on a dedicated circuit.  I don't really know how to diagram romex (seems hard in 2D) so instead I updated my diagram with a few letters - hope this makes sense to you. Here's the new diagram.   There will be romex with the hot coming from point B and the neutral coming from point A to the garbage disposal. There will be romex with the hot coming from point C and the neutral coming from point A to the undercabinet LED driver There will be romex with the hot coming from point D and the neutral coming from point A to the above sink light.   Now in reality the diagram will be a lot simpler because I think I'll just go with the dedicated circuit for the garbage disposal."

The reason lights are flush with the ceiling is because they are mounted to an octagon box which is screwed into solid wood.   I couldn't see that ehow so I don't know what your planning but I wouldn't connect that light to that extension cord.

Look in the box and try to determine if any wires go up, or if they both go down. If both go down you have to drill a hole from the attic down to the switch and run a new wire. Connect this wire instead of the one the switch is currently powering. As for the outlet, when you open it you will see two hot wires. Determine which one is on the switch and cap it off. Now replace the outlet, or pigtail so the constant power wire reaches both hot terminals on the right."

Look at this picture, and notice the tiny brass piece between the two screws on the right. By breaking that off, each outlet can now have it's own wire. It's probably easier for you to just replace the outlet with one where that piece is intact, putting the constant power wire on either right hand terminal, and the white wires and ground in the same locations they were already in."

electricians,39zhoz,sonicjesus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:08:37 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I thought you meant one was switched and the other not. In this case, you need only connect the two black wires on the switch with a yellow wirenut and the outlet will be constant. To wire the new light, connect a third wire to those two (now with a red wirenut) and run to one of the terminals on the switch. The black wire running to your new light goes on the other terminal, the white wire joins the two white wires in the back of the box (again with a red nut) and join the grounds.

But I do understand that it's not magic, and that if something is wrong or isn't working, it is fixable.  This truck was brought to a shop who basically said they looked at it, and they can't fix it.  The attached picture shows the back of a switch panel in my work truck. They run the lightbar on top which has strobes, and lights on the left, right, and rear. The three switches to the left work, but the far right switch does nothing. The power and ground are jumped between all switches, and they all start at the switch that doesn't work, so (I think) that would tell me that there is no disruption of the power or ground, or none of the others would work.   Here's the part I really don't comprehend. I took a scrap piece of wire and ran it off the output of the left switch. With the switch on, I can jump that power to the next two, which illuminates the switch and activates the lightbar. When I try to jump the third switch, the switch doesn't illuminate (which I assume would mean the switch itself is broken?) but it also doesn't activate the lightbar, which tells me something is wrong after the switch. The weird part is i cannot get the jumper wire to arc at all on that switchs output. The two that do work from jumping, I see the power arc as I touch the wire, but the last one won't arc at all. Is there any reason behind this? I mean, even if the switch was broken and somewhere down the line, the wiring was messed up, I should still see it arcing to that wire, shouldn't i?  Sorry if this was hard to follow, but any help would be appreciated!"

That and he may refuse to sign your work off. I would not be comfortable signing off a customer's work. Sorry to break your balls, but things like this rarely end well."
electricians,39w198,llukiie,12,Mon Jun 15 09:39:38 2015 UTC,"Its because bending conduit, placing boxes, running cable, etc is a job that has to be done right or it could turn into hours and hours of extra work for him. Personally I wouldn't want the homeowner to do it either, and would probably back out of the job if that was what had to happen. Bending pipe isn't as easy as everyone seems to assume it is."

electricians,39w198,IrishDemon,3,Tue Jun 16 04:59:08 2015 UTC,"If the electrician is pulling the permit to do the work, it's his license and bonding on the line. If you do some of the work and screw something up, he's still potentially liable. Without taking a lot of pictures and writing disclaimers (which still may not be enough to keep him out of trouble) it's not worth the hassle, especially if any of your work isn't up to code or needs to be reworked. You can save some time and money by doing the demo work and removing the plaster, old wiring, boxes, and anything else in the way. If you haven't already thought of doing it, this would also be a perfect time to redo the plumbing and HVAC systems in the house.   As for needing conduit instead of running romex, it may be a local code amendment that supersedes what the NEC requires, or it may be due to the unique construction of your home. Without pictures and someone who's familiar with the process to do work in your area we'd only be guessing. You may also be limited by historic guidelines and other building codes due to the age of the home and it's location. Your best bet is to get quotes from multiple contractors. If it is a local requirement, they should all be consistent with their estimates as far as that is concerned."

electricians,39ukdp,dcd00d,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:54:23 2015 UTC,Most water heaters specify a 30 amp breaker. Can you post a picture of the nameplate from the water heater?
electricians,39ukdp,pueblokc,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:42:14 2015 UTC,"Mine was doing this randomly. I found large wore feeding 12 gauge, then back again. Loose connections. And my favorite, wired direct to meter base (customer side, why?) after fixing all that and the breaker it's happy again. 30amps,double pole."
electricians,39ukdp,JohnProof,-1,Mon Jun 15 07:34:30 2015 UTC,"If you have a two pole 240V breaker, then each element is not 120V.  If it were wired that way, then that would be an easy explanation for why you're immediately tripping, because with both elements on the breaker would be significantly overloaded at 33A.  Someone needs to safely take some current measurements to determine what's actually going on."
electricians,39ukdp,ACDCbaggs,2,Sun Jun 14 23:11:55 2015 UTC,"OP didn't say that it had a two pole breaker, just what the rating is.  It definitely needs to be a bigger breaker, like a 25 or 30 fed with 10.  Water heaters are designed to run one element at a time, so it could be that the breaker has finally had enough.    Water heater would be 2000*1.25=2500. Too much for a 20 amp circuit.  I would try the breaker next.  If that doesn't fix it, an electrician should come out."
electricians,39ukdp,JohnProof,0,Sun Jun 14 23:43:17 2015 UTC,"I do not agree at all that the OP should simply be upsizing breakers.  At least not on the information available.   He said it's labeled ""120/240"" so it's gonna be 2 pole.  There's no reason a 4000W 240V load should be tripping a 20A breaker.    Edit:  My mistake, a single pole breaker would absolutely still be labeled 120/240V."
electricians,39ukdp,ACDCbaggs,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:49:36 2015 UTC,"like a 25 or 30 fed with 10   I said new circuit.  All breakers have to be rated for phase to phase voltage, it is written right on the front of them.  2014 NEC 240.83(E)  I am still saying it needs a new circuit because it was never installed correctly in the first place if it is indeed a 120 water heater.  Pictures would be helpful.  Water heater elements run one at a time.  Even 50 gallon tanks have 2-4500 watt elements, they only run one at a time."
electricians,39ukdp,JohnProof,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:00:31 2015 UTC,"like a 25 or 30 fed with 10   Fair point, I missed that.    That said, though, if this WH is set up to only be single element operation, it's still all the more reason he doesn't need to change the existing install.  A 20A circuit would be more than sufficient for alternating 2kW elements even at 125%."

Many other jobs like retail really suck.   How hard would it be to get a job in Vancouver and what would the pay be like? What about job security?   It's not easy, the pay is OKish and job security isn't too high.   I plan on doing an apprenticeship that my school will find me a placement for over the summer and the first semester of grade 12. How much will this help?   A lot IMO.   This question is more for people who live in Bc, but would you recommend going go BCIT or KPU after highschool, or should I go to a different school altogether?   Yes, BCIT. NOT a private school (PM me for more).  You can learn a lot before you begin, first, this book: http://www.psknight.com/book1.html  It's about $20 at RONA. It's a huge chunk of what you need to know.

electricians,39trvv,Jim-Jones,2,Mon Jun 15 01:34:59 2015 UTC,"I'm a bc journeyman been doing this about 8 years, I can't answer your questions about the lower mainland but in my opinion being a construction electrician is a tough career path. You asked about job security, there isn't much. I have only ever had to look for a job once and I was hired in a week but I worry about my employment all the time. I have no idea where I will be working a year from now and that makes family life hard.   That being said, the money is pretty decent ($100k+ per year working industrial construction) you will make way less in residential or commercial construction though.   It also might be a really good time to be an electrician in BC over the next 5-10 years. Bc hydro will start construction of the site c dam as early as next month unless it's delayed and/or canceled due to legal issues. (9+ billion dollar job)   Petronas a Malaysian company just announced that they will build a 15-36 billion dollars worth of LNG infrastructure in BC  providing they get federal and environmental approval. Construction could start this year.   Neither projects are guaranteed but they would require thousands of workers each. But that's construction, there are never guarantees.   In the end, all jobs have their positives and negatives, I will say one thing that's really nice about being an electrician is that the company you work for doesn't have you by the balls like many other occupations. You can pretty easily in my experience find a new employer if you need or want to. I have worked for 4 throughout my career so far."

electricians,39trvv,SorryIamFromCanada,2,Mon Jun 15 17:54:15 2015 UTC,I'm 23 and currently a first year apprentice in Vancouver.   All that means is you have to fight harder to get noticed.  If your not willing to give it 110% than your going to have a bad time.  There are 1000's of young people becoming electricians right now but not a lot of them are going to be capable of moving up into foreman positions. If you bust your ass then you won't have a problem. Company's seem to be busy right now in the lower mainland.  I am in the union and I know my company is looking for apprentices right now.  I'm not going to tell you to go union or go non-union because its totally up to you.  There are pros and cons going both ways but I know the Union is busy ATM. Lots if you get to skip the waitlist.  The faster you finish your pre-app the better. I did my pre-app at KPU.  I don't have any complaints about it.  If your willing to learn then you will be fine at either one.

electricians,39trvv,FudgeDuck,2,Mon Jun 15 17:04:03 2015 UTC,Take it at BCIT. The BCIT diploma is worth almost as much as your ticket when you're done.  A 1 year+ waitlist or more isn't uncommon.   The apprenticeship you talk about will help a lot. It's easier to get work if you have some experience.
electricians,39trvv,technica-,3,Tue Jun 16 00:45:21 2015 UTC,"Hey, I live in Victoria and one of our schools has a program that's somewhat similar, it's a course that you take in grade 12 and when you're done they pay for your first year of school and let you go with or without an employer to school which is a huge advantage. I unfortunately didn't attend that high school, but a lot of my friends did, most of them are still friends today and are going back to school for their third year of electrical at the age of 21, where as I'm also 21 and trying to get a start in a different trade. My advice to you would be to do it, especially if it interests you. You're still young and even if you don't enjoy it as much as you thought,  it will look great on a resume considering so many trades these days have to do somewhat with electrical. From what I hear around here in Victoria most my friends companies are quite busy and are actively looking for apprentices. I would say give it a try, if you don't i bet you'd kick yourself later down the road for not at least having the experience to put on your resumé."

electricians,39utb8,Jim-Jones,0,Mon Jun 15 01:42:13 2015 UTC,"Could be loose connections. Start with panel, turn it off before you work on it. Make sure all connections are tight. Breakers, neutral bar, ground bar. Remember even when you turn off the main breaker the top lugs are still hot. After that see if your faults continue. If they persist your problem could be further back in the power chain (loose connections in meter base or even as far back as weather head or pole). If your not really sure get a licensed electrician to go over all of it. One slip in your panel could be your last."

Those are the easiest, and sometimes cheaper (depending on brand), option. IMO they tend to give a bit of a harsher, more direct light, more because a lot of them lack decent diffusers. But they're bright as hell. I went with those in my living room, more because the ceiling is so high that I can just barely touch the bulbs while using my tallest ladder. There was no way I could have used a retrofit kit without buying another ladder.  There's also plenty of retrofit kits that replace everything visible, including the trim ring. They usually have 3 metal fingers that lock it inside the can, and a screw-in adapter to connect to the existing socket. They're generally pretty light, just sometimes a pain to get to lock. They're also going to be the best looking option, IMO, as long as you get all of them to match. That's what I went with in our kitchen (which is all remodel cans). They seem to give a much softer light due to usually having a built-in diffuser, but they're still plenty bright.  Obviously I'm not an electrician, just relaying my own experience with LED swaps."

electricians,39qna6,drcujo,5,Sun Jun 14 07:46:53 2015 UTC,Volts x amps = watts. Each USB port will be 2A @ 5 volts.   So 600w total for all 60.   Any decent power strip or splitter should be good with 600w.
electricians,39qna6,admiralranga,3,Sat Jun 13 20:47:33 2015 UTC,"Would suggest adding the inefficiencies in as well, so more like 600w / 80% = 750 watts still well within range."
electricians,39qna6,Jabberwocky918,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:05:31 2015 UTC,"Assuming each phone is using 2 amps (I know you said .5 amps, but just in case), NOTHING else is on the entire circuit, and it's a 15 amp circuit, you can safely charge about 130 devices. If each device truly is taking only .5 amps, than you can safely charge about 520 devices.  My math - 110VAC x 15 amps x .8 (for safety) = 1320 watts. Each device is 5VDC x 2 amps = 10 watts. 1320 / 10 = 132."

You could plug 6 into one for 36 sockets. You could add small extension cords with three 2 pin sockets if they suit your chargers.  In the US you could try Family Dollar but they have no prices on the website???  Your power consumption is negligible."

electricians,39qna6,old_two_thumbs,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:15:04 2015 UTC,Take a look at the phone chargers; add up the total number of mA required.  What's the total?
electricians,39qna6,XirallicBolts,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:39:43 2015 UTC,I have multiple models of phone and the output in chargers vary a bit but I was told 500 mA per device should be fine across the board as they are all low end devices/small screens/ low spec etc. - not accurate? The Sabrent charger has an output of 2.4 amps per port but I guess each phone would only draw what it needs? Not sure of the actual draw per phone but based on the replies of another reddit sub (albeit less electrically inclined) I'm guessing the average draw would be under 500 mA based on the products I know others use with success.
electricians,39qna6,old_two_thumbs,-9,Sat Jun 13 20:47:08 2015 UTC,"Looking at my new charger for a Galaxy S5, It's labelled as .35amps @ 120V.  .35 x 60 = 21amps.  Granted, this is maximum draw, but realistically, it's too much to put on 1 circuit.  Splitting them in half, and using 2 circuits would be the smartest option.  I can't speak to any specific power strips or chargers that might suit your needs, but I'd hesitate to put everything on 1 circuit, as you're probably very close to overloading it."
electricians,39qna6,ACDCbaggs,2,Sat Jun 13 21:04:45 2015 UTC,"You're.... Not really wrong here, as far as I can tell. Although op mentioned these aren't high-end phones.  My HTC has a draw of 0.2A on the line side."
electricians,39qna6,old_two_thumbs,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:59:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/XirallicBolts, you're not wrong. Your math checks out if you were using 60 of the individual transformers.  But that leaves me curious as to why one of those transformers is rated at 42 watts. Interesting.  120v x .35a = 42w   But OP's link says the unit draws 60w, which would be 2 0.5 amps at 120 volts. Add 20%ish to that for inefficiencies and I'd say each one will draw 2.4  0.6 amps.  EDIT: Mathed wrong."
electricians,39qna6,notTomHanx,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:02:49 2015 UTC,"So a USB hub would be better if this is a legit issue --limits them to 500mA @ 5v and only one transformer for multiple ports.  Those individual 1.5a chargers do get pretty damn hot when charging, so they're absolutely drawing some amount of current.  Though for some reason, my charger lists 200mA regardless of input voltage -- 100v to 240v.  Maybe it's 200mA @ 100v¿"
electricians,39qlo7,Tonashu,7,Sat Jun 13 20:13:03 2015 UTC,"Shut off the breaker and call an electrician.  It's probably a loose connection somewhere in the circuit, and you would have to start pulling out outlets and switches.  Something you can do is physically trace the wiring and look for other junction boxes. They should be accessible and not hidden behind a wall, but they can be in the attic or in the basement, so make sure access points to those locations are open. Electricians charge by the hour, and saving them time saves you money."

I suspect physical damage somewhere because it's two rooms that should be on separate breakers (if installed correctly). If you recently bought the house, contact the previous owner, not to yell, but to ask information. It sounds like it will be a job for a professional, but the more info you can give him, the less expensive hours he will be charging."

electricians,39rfkf,andyb521740,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:58:13 2015 UTC,yep...
electricians,39rfkf,ShoulderChip,5,Sun Jun 14 11:50:55 2015 UTC,"The little light in the switch is in series with the light bulb when you turn the switch off.  For an incandescent, the little bit of current through it doesn't matter, but the LED bulb is wanting to turn on.  You might try a different brand of LED bulb and see if that makes a difference.  Otherwise you'll have to change the switch to a non-illuminated one, or to one with a separate neutral connection for the illumination.  That kind would normally be wired so that the switch illumination is on when the switch is on, instead of off, because they would be used in areas where the main light can't be seen from the switch location, but you could instead wire it so the switch illumination is always on.  Instead of an illuminated switch, you could install a cover plate that has an electroluminescent panel built in for a night light.  I have those in my house, and over several years, the EL light wears out and gets dimmer, but I still think it's a good value.  The company that makes them is called LimeLite.  Either way, you need a neutral wire available in the box, so that you don't have to use a return current path through the light bulb, which is causing the your problem.  Edited: I remembered name of the manufacturer of the cover plate night lights: LimeLite."
electricians,39rfkf,ShoulderChip,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:51:58 2015 UTC,"all that is in the box (I think) is the standard 3 way wiring, eg capped neutral going to light."
electricians,39rfkf,Jim-Jones,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:44:56 2015 UTC,"If you have a neutral in the box, and also an unswitched hot wire, you can use them to power a little night light as described above (I edited the post to provide the name of the product I used in my house).  There are several ways to wire 3-way switch boxes, so it may not have the required wires in the box."

electricians,39rfkf,love-broker,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:46:15 2015 UTC,"Ah there you go.  Replace it with a regular switch.  The night light switch doesn't have a neutral for the light so it gets its return path from the filament in the light bulb.  It's such a tiny amount of electricity that it doesn't affect the incandescent bulbs but LED's are far more sensitive.   If you were to touch the wire even with the switch off, you'd still get zapped too."
electricians,39rfkf,Jim-Jones,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:21:28 2015 UTC,Problem solved. We got that switch as we have a cat and it's litter box is in the hallway so the switch works like a nightlight so we don't accidentally step on the cat when she sleeps in the hallway at night.

electricians,39r339,persianrug,2,Sun Jun 14 02:50:00 2015 UTC,"225 amps is a lot for 1000 square feet. Unless you have lots of electrical appliances, a 100 amp service should do it.  How are you at trim carpentry? All the trim is on top of the drywall and will need to be removed in order to demo all of the drywall and insulate.   You can avoid pulling all the trim by cutting the drywall a foot past the edge of the trim so you have space to float the seam between the new and existing drywall. Leave a full stud bay for anything vertical (window/door casings) so the rock is still secured to something. I'm not sure how you'd insulate behind these saved vertical pieces.  I've used MC and romex in wooden framed buildings. I learned residential work with MC and metal boxes. I was shocked at how much easier it is to work with romex and plastic boxes. MC/metal is more durable, but once the rock is up, how are you going to damage the wiring?"

electricians,39r339,Alpha1998,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:25:02 2015 UTC,"I would go with Romex.  In a wood framed house, there will be a lot of very sharp turns and corners and I don't really see much benefit to justify the cost and hassle of dealing with MC cable.  Plastic boxes are also much easier to work with.  Dedicated circuits for every room is overkill, but I guess if you're going to go ultimate warrior on your own house, maybe you can get even more creative and go half and half so each room at any given time is run off two breakers - ie. the lights and half the plugs in the room are off one breaker, and the other half of the plugs are off the next room's breaker.  This of course is a complete pain in the ass to wire, but since I don't have to wire it, I say it's brilliant!  Think about it, what are the chances that two rooms next to each other will need a dedicated circuit and run at full capacity at the same time?  BUT it might be possible that you turn one room into an equipment room that needs dedicated power and on occasion you need extra power that would otherwise trip the breaker.  For those days you can use the other plugs.    Having said that, I would probably just wire it using standard load calculations and maybe throw in one extra breaker for possible extra capacity."

electricians,39ncle,TurnbullFL,4,Sat Jun 13 02:06:57 2015 UTC,There's never a bad time to give it a good tug.
electricians,39ncle,almost_a_troll,3,Sat Jun 13 21:41:05 2015 UTC,"It varies. If was was a light, it could be stranded connecting to solid. You can't really twist a stranded and solid together, it is best to just lead with the stranded a little. Two solids should be twisted. Two strandeds will twist when you put on the wirenut."
electricians,39ncle,microwavedbulb,2,Sat Jun 13 01:21:28 2015 UTC,"It was solid to a solid - sorry I was not clear - on the wire leading to an outlet - I had to move that wire to look at the wiring for the light, and the wire nut just popped off. It was the live wire, too, energized at the time it happened.  Other issue was the outlet is a GFCI one (the light is wired through that outlet actually), and test button didn't work, which is definitely bad. It's also installed upside down for god knows what reason. I'm probably just gonna fix that up myself, there's no way it's passing any sort of inspection as it is.  edit: stranded in a wirenut sounds hazardous, to be honest. Only some of the strands would actually engage with the screw, it doesn't sound very mechanically secure. In Europe we usually put it in a special little metal tube and then use a screw terminal (which is very very tight), and that's with half your amperage..."
electricians,39ncle,MostlyStoned,2,Sat Jun 13 02:03:32 2015 UTC,"I've never really seen an issue with all stranded connections in a wire nut as long as it's properly sized. I also install all my receptacles ground up as while it looks ""backward"" it is safer."
electricians,39ncle,MostlyStoned,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:03:37 2015 UTC,"I was thinking I should sometime do (and put on youtube) a few tests of different connectors for their pull strength and maybe also resistance (measured with a proper four leads milliohmmeter).   Obviously there are manufacturers who go an extra mile, there are manufacturers who barely pass UL tests, and there are manufacturers who passed UL tests then their Chinese factory got a new batch of materials and now they wouldn't."
electricians,39ncle,MostlyStoned,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:35:26 2015 UTC,"While that would be interesting, I don't really think it would prove all that useful. Are there guys out there making crappy connections? Yes. But in my experience if you properly tighten and size a wire nut, and test it by giving it a tug after you are done, you aren't going to have any issues. After all, it's just going to be sitting in a box until someone messes with it."
electricians,39ncle,LeDudicus,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:46:17 2015 UTC,"Unless there's a good pressure continuously holding the wires together, they'll oxidise at the point of contact, which is dangerous in two ways - it could cause a fire in normal use or it could add enough resistance to the circuit so that if an appliance develops a short, it's cord would burn but the circuit breaker won't trip.  edit: there's also probably an UL regulation for the minimum force required to pull it apart, no? Would be interesting to see if any of those outsourced-to-china products fail that test."

I have a little toddler and I'm freaked out by the plugs plugged in outlets, because it would be very easy for toddler's fingers to come in contact with the live side of a partially pulled out prong (essentially impossible with Schuko and Europlug). I imagine a toddler can tolerate much less current than adult as well...  It's too bad the US didn't add any protective recess before wall warts became common."
electricians,39ncle,spirituallyinsane,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:06:11 2015 UTC,Ive encountered one receptacle where that happened and ever since then if i am able to trim everything out I'll put it ground up. Most of the time I'm forced to match existing installations but I wish this would be adopted as standard industry practice. Its something that doesn't cause many problems though so not a lot of attention is paid to it.
electricians,39ncle,coogie,2,Sat Jun 13 18:59:34 2015 UTC,"The wirenut is supposed to twist the wires as you turn it.  That specific one wasn't done right as the wirenut probably caught one wire but not both.  It's not necessary to twist the wires together first, but it sure doesn't hurt to do so."
electricians,39ncle,spirituallyinsane,3,Sat Jun 13 00:56:14 2015 UTC,"I 100% think that if it's solid wire you should 'pre-twist' your wires. Stranded, not so much, but if its like #18 wire stranded on a fixture? I'll twist that wire beforehand to get a better bite on my wire nut."
electricians,39ncle,absinthe-green,3,Sat Jun 13 01:30:41 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you got downvoted, since modern wire nuts are rated to not require twisting..."
electricians,39ncle,spirituallyinsane,3,Sat Jun 13 03:33:31 2015 UTC,"The metal part in the wirenut maybe rated for it, and maybe you can get away with it if the wirenut is sized perfectly and you have two conductors, but in practice, not twisting the solid wires together is a timebomb that will come back and haunt the homeowner.  Generally, people who take those kind of shortcuts also take shortcuts in stripping the wires right or twisting the wirenut so tight that it would twist the wires together inside the wirenut.    There have been quite a few times where I've had to troubleshoot recessed lights where a few were coming on with the rest not working and the culprit was the wires were not twisted and were barely touching the metal parts so over time, the heat melted that tiny connection and created an air gap.    More recently on a brand new house (not a cheap tract home either), we were hired to install some dimmers and every box I opened had loose wires so if you even touched a neutral, it would cut off the neutral to the rest of the branch circuit and a lot of the wirenuts were hot to the touch.  The electrician hadn't even grounded the switches, but the loose wirenuts was scary.  I explained to the homeowner what was going on and since the house was under warranty, she called the builder to figure it out, but later I found out the electrician's response was ""it passed inspection, didn't it?"".    TLDR: For god's sake pre twist the solid wires.  That's a fireable offense in some shops."
electricians,39ncle,Raxbilt,2,Sat Jun 13 14:17:57 2015 UTC,"That makes good sense. Thanks for taking the time to explain, rather than downvoting!   I can also see how it makes life easier, because twisting the wires with lineman pliers is much easier, and then the wire nut is not doing as much work."
electricians,39ncle,doccynical,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:09:01 2015 UTC,"I twist for the electrician following me.  I've had un-pretwisted wirenuts ""spring"" on me when undone.  Just because something is rated and can be done doesn't mean it should be done."
electricians,39ncle,sparkydad,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:20:15 2015 UTC,"Of course, I can see that. I suppose I have always been meticulous about strip length and twisting the connector until twists appear in every wire, so that has not happened to me before. Procedurally it makes better sense to me to do something that is more mistake-resistant, so I will be doing it this way from now on. It will save my poor thumbs, anyway."
electricians,39ncle,Cameroo,2,Mon Jun 15 12:41:32 2015 UTC,"It depends on the wire nut.  Some brands seem to grab, others... not so much.  It depends on how many wires.  2 solid wires, you're fine, stick them in there and spin it then pull kind of hard to make sure they're good.  Actually pull on your wires to make sure they're tight.  If you are putting a wire nut on like 4+ solids.. then ya, probably should pretwist.  I used to twist the crap out of them then twist the nut on but I stopped doing that because it takes time and it's just extra wear and tear on your arms.  How many wire nuts away from tennis elbow are you?  Is it really necessary to reef on it with your Kleins?    The bottom line though is that it doesn't really matter.  If you pull on the wires and they're in there good, then you're good to go.    Also, read the back of a package of wire nuts.  It tells you all you want to know."
electricians,39ncle,logosogol,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:00:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that makes sense - twisting wires together is incredibly inefficient in terms of effort. I always used soldering in appliance repair and screw terminals in installation, but that was Europe with 2x the voltage and 1/2 the current...  Effort is not so much a factor when doing a small fix for a relative, though."

(And the instructions for the wire nuts say it doesn't have to be twisted but can be. In that case unless there's some special issue concerning the nut, it's best twisted because that results in a larger contact area)"

You probably can't fit 8GA wire into a 120V receptacle though, so nut them to 12GA in the box, and swap the breaker to a 20A.  I don't know what breakers you have, but as an example, a Square D QO 20A breaker can take 8GA wire, so that's probably not a problem."

electricians,39n940,gar37bic,7,Fri Jun 12 23:23:31 2015 UTC,How would it be wasteful to use existing wire instead of paying for new wire to be put in?
electricians,39n940,MostlyStoned,-4,Sat Jun 13 03:11:14 2015 UTC,"Because you could use it better for something else (depending on how hard it would be to get it out of the wall and string more, of course).  The stove wire is much heavier gauge, and the breaker is much too big.  The stove cable is either three or four wires + ground instead of two + ground. White is 'neutral', usually IIRC red and black are hot, green or bare are safety ground.  To use the existing cable, you could a) hook it to a 15 amp breaker; and cap off both ends of one of the live wires (generally one is red, the other black).  I am doubtful this is technically legal but it would work if there is nothing else connected to that circuit.  I know you can't legally use the 40 amp breaker for this, but you could install a 240V 15 amp breaker and only use one side of it.*   Legally you are not allowed to have anything else on that circuit but the stove.

Will future electricians be surprised in dangerous and potentially fatal ways?  For this reason alone, I would suggest that if you can do so, run another cable for the 15 amp circuit, leave the existing cable and fixture alone - don't remove it or anything.  It's not going to hurt anything just staying there.  Then put a label on the breaker saying ""Do not turn on, not in use"" or words to that effect.  Who knows, 30 years 5 years from now someone may decide they'd rather have an induction range - I know I would, in fact I'm doing that this summer - and then having the circuit already in place will be a blessing.  [edit] one of the key principles of breakers is that the breaker should not be too big for the design load.  Otherwise the design load becomes the safety trip protecting the breaker, which is all wrong.  I.e. if your stove is a 15 amp load, then the breaker should trip if the stove's draw gets over, say, 20 amps - this is an indication that the stove is shorting out or doing something bad.

This added section ([edit]) was just noting the overall principle of the electrical code, for those who don't know why you shouldn't put a 40 amp breaker on a 15 amp circuit - this is probably the majority of people on reddit.  IOW I was trying to explain why you need to swap breakers.  Leaving it is OK if you don't just leave wires hanging out.  It's just a plug not being used, for a stove you don't have.  It didn't sound like you want to swap it out - that was just a possibly overly thrifty approach - you could use it for a hot tub - a small one anyway.  But leaving it there is the simplest, and least surprise.  Leave the plug there and everything.  Least surprise - if you were to leave the 40 amp breaker in place, and only use one wire, a future electrician might not know what's going on.  Hilarity might ensue, such as he/she thinks that ""this is why some unrelated circuit isn't working"", and plug it back into the breaker.  In general, using a 4-wire cable for a 3-wire application is just a bad idea.  IDK what your house layout is, but if it's a long way between the two ends, it may not be at all easy for someone working on the wall in between points A and B to realize what's going on.  It's best to think from the point of view of someone who is used to how things are normally done and is completely ignorant of your house, and try not to confuse them.  They may not be as smart and creative as you. :)  Other stuff on the circuit - working on a relative's house we found several cases where someone previously had cut open the insulation on wires in the attic, twisted another set of wires to them, wrapped them all in electrical tape, and left them that way - no box, no caps, no nothing, just another random circuit wandering off to some other part of the house.  I also had a house myself where the entire basement was wired backwards - white was hot, black was neutral.  This was discovered when we bought the house and the house inspector said the seller had to put a new breaker box in.  The electrician nearly died.  I.e. shit happens.  Your 'nothing illegal' remark is almost certainly incorrect in at least some jurisdictions, and seems to contradict your statement in parentheses that follows - if I'm reading it right.  But it also seems to agree with what I said - cap off one of the wires, hook it to a 15 (or 20 - whatever) amp breaker.  But I also misspoke about the 240 15 amp.  That's doable (I've worked on houses where that was done) but also probably illegal, as you noted.  Getting it out of the wall - probably true.  Just one option, depends also on whether you're doing wall work as well.  The fact remains, the best solution is to leave the existing circuit, including the stove plug, and run a new smaller circuit, if it's not too difficult to run the wire."
electricians,39n940,gar37bic,4,Sat Jun 13 04:37:20 2015 UTC,"That's not the best solution. It's more than likely the most difficult solution and is for sure the most expensive solution. Changing the current range plug to a normal plug and changing the breaker in the panel is the most affordable and most convienent solution. If someone comes along in a few years and is confused by that, then they probably shouldn't be doing electrical work."
electricians,39n940,Imaelectrician,3,Sat Jun 13 04:53:39 2015 UTC,"Leaving it is OK if you don't just leave wires hanging out.  It's just a plug not being used, for a stove you don't have.  It didn't sound like you want to swap it out - that was just a possibly overly thrifty approach - you could use it for a hot tub - a small one anyway.  But leaving it there is the simplest, and least surprise.  Leave the plug there and everything.   Sure, you could leave it and most likely everything would be fine. I don't leave something that is obviously not going to be used connected to a live line outside of a customer request though. If it doesn't need to be live, it probably shouldn't be.    Least surprise - if you were to leave the 40 amp breaker in place, and only use one wire, a future electrician might not know what's going on.  Hilarity might ensue, such as he/she thinks that ""this is why some unrelated circuit isn't working"", and plug it back into the breaker.  In general, using a 4-wire cable for a 3-wire application is just a bad idea.  IDK what your house layout is, but if it's a long way between the two ends, it may not be at all easy for someone working on the wall in between points A and B to realize what's going on.  It's best to think from the point of view of someone who is used to how things are normally done and is completely ignorant of your house, and try not to confuse them.  They may not be as smart and creative as you. :)   I never suggested leaving the 40 amp breaker in place. In fact, all I've talked about is replacing the breaker with a single pole 20a breaker and capping off one hot. If you are a service guy and you only think about ""how stuff is normally done"" then you are a shitty service electrician and are asking to get hit. I don't know where you learned this principle of least suprise bullshit... I understand it to a point, but try staying in business telling someone you can't do the job in an hour and with maybe 30 dollars in parts because it might surprise an idiot, so instead it will cost them at least 500.   Other stuff on the circuit - working on a relative's house we found several cases where someone previously had cut open the insulation on wires in the attic, twisted another set of wires to them, wrapped them all in electrical tape, and left them that way - no box, no caps, no nothing, just another random circuit wandering off to some other part of the house.  I also had a house myself where the entire basement was wired backwards - white was hot, black was neutral.  This was discovered when we bought the house and the house inspector said the seller had to put a new breaker box in.  The electrician nearly died.  I.e. shit happens.   Buy a circuit tracer, test shit before you get into it. That electrician should have checked the panel, though I'm still not sure how swapped wires would have almost killed him unless he was doing something stupid to begin with.   Your 'nothing illegal' remark is almost certainly incorrect in at least some jurisdictions, and seems to contradict your statement in parentheses that follows - if I'm reading it right.  But it also seems to agree with what I said - cap off one of the wires, hook it to a 15 (or 20 - whatever) amp breaker.  But I also misspoke about the 240 15 amp.  That's doable (I've worked on houses where that was done) but also probably illegal, as you noted.   I said hook it up to a single pole 20A breaker, which in a house is a 120v breaker. A 240v breaker would be a double pole breaker. How do you not know this?    Getting it out of the wall - probably true.  Just one option, depends also on whether you're doing wall work as well.   Did you read OPs question? He asked if you could just swap the recep and if he had to swap the breakers. There was no possibility of wall work here. You told him that would be a bad idea, despite that being exactly what he should do.   The fact remains, the best solution is to leave the existing circuit, including the stove plug, and run a new smaller circuit, if it's not too difficult to run the wire.   No, it's not the best solution. The goal of any service guy should be to get the customer a solution in a manner that is (in order of priority) safe, code compliant, and least expensive. Swapping the breaker and the recep is all three.  Are you actually an electrician? Because your lack of knowledge is alarming if you are. You are ignorant about code, common terminology, and the realities of work. If you are, then please go read some books and refrain from giving advice until you up your game a bit. If you aren't... Then why are you posting advice in this sub in the first place."

electricians,39n940,pueblokc,-1,Tue Jun 16 03:14:47 2015 UTC,"It's been a while but I used to be very conversant with the National Electrical Code, including the rather amusing/frustrating differences between the local variances from NEC between adjacent towns. For example, one time when I was assisting with a remodel the house was on the line between two towns, one of which required conduit for residences, the other required Romex and didn't allow conduit (at that time the NEC allowed both).  I've built houses and rewired houses during remodels, and done conversions from single to two-family.  At one time (a long time ago) I toyed with getting my commercial license.  But I'm pretty far out of date these days, although the parts don't look much different at the supply store.  I'll have to get back up to speed though - I'm collecting parts for a studs-out kitchen makeover right now.  Having said that, I'll stipulate that my wording was abysmal, and might have been misleading to at least some folks. I mixed general explanation of certain things with specifics about the situation, and tossed in some philosophy."
electricians,39m0f2,Nochamier,2,Fri Jun 12 17:57:37 2015 UTC,Did you try a third surge protector to replace the first one? The circuitry inside the first strip could be wearing out.
electricians,39m0f2,Jabberwocky918,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:04:47 2015 UTC,"What I meant was that the components we installed were never plugged into the surge protector that is tripping, but rather plugged into a different outlet on the same breaker."
electricians,39m0f2,Jabberwocky918,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:17:35 2015 UTC,Surge strips have something called a Transient Voltage Surge Suppressor (TVSS). They work by shunting some or all power to ground when a voltage spike or surge hits the strip. They are only good for two or three surges and then they have to be replaced.
electricians,39m0f2,Jabberwocky918,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:58:58 2015 UTC,"sure, but I don't get how that would make everything on the breaker's circuit lose power if one surge protector (which has a printer and the telephone modem plugged into it) trips"
electricians,39m0f2,robstoon,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:34:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know. My scientific wild ass guess (being serious here) would be that the TVSS is shunting enough power to ground to cause everything to shut down due to low voltage, but not enough to trip the breaker. I forget how they fail though, if it acts like an open circuit or if it acts like a short."

In addition, most equipment we use is rated for 600V, to utilize the 690V tap you will have to buy 1000V equipment and may need to make everything inside the enclosure 1000V rated.

To do this effectively, you also have to ensure the bit is not bent, and start the screw straight and slowly to ensure it isn't cross-threaded or otherwise fucked.  Rapidly inserting a screw that is fucked can ruin your timeline.  I highly recommend studying torque setting tools, because even experienced electricians can never seem to get it right by hand."

He is probably one of the smartest guys I have ever talked to, and had an absolutely amazing memory. In the early 2000's, I went to him for some help with a specific measurement I was taking crashing the network analyzer. I told him what was happening, and he thought for a couple of minutes. ""You know, in 1985, Dr. So-and-so at Agilent sent me a copy of page 58 of the internal training manual for that machine, just give me a bit and I'll get back to you.""   About 10 minutes later, he came by my desk. With page 58 of the manual. And solved all my issues."

Sometimes you need to pull a 4-wire.    Figuring out the size of feeder depends on square footage of the area it is serving and all of the connected loads.  You never just count the number on the handle for the size of the feeder.  Just because the breakers are 15 amp, doesn't mean they count as 15 amps towards the load.    What is the square footage and what are the name plates of the appliances you are going to be feeding?"
electricians,39jdhe,sonicjesus,1 point,Fri Jun 12 07:39:53 2015 UTC,"The terminal inside the AC unit itself only has hookup for 3 wires  (2 hot + ground). The indoor unit has 4 wires  (2 hot, ground, and control wire).   There are two 12k btu units, which are rated at 1300 watts and 9 amps each, but call for 15 amp breakers. They service about 500-600 sqft each. The 3rd unit is a 30k unit that will feed 3 internal blowers (two 9k but and one 12k btu). I don't have the spec sheet on that unit, but it calls for a 30amp 240v breaker.   The two 12k units are Air-Con and the 30k unit I believe will be a Pioneer unit (haven't purchased this one yet)."

The last couple I installed had neutrals to power the 110v indoor units. The ground wire only goes to ground. Ground and neutral should never touch outside of the main panel. A 100 amp break will be fine. You want room for expansion. Wire should be #2 aluminum (cheaper but bigger) or #4 copper. It you go aluminum you must coat the ends of the wire with Noalox.

electricians,39i9ex,krisspy,6,Thu Jun 11 22:13:30 2015 UTC,"Electric current wants to flow. The potential (voltage)of that current will make it flow. So when a connection is made or broken with a potential on one side, it will want to arc to the other side when the two conductors are near enough, this is the arc-and is the same thing as a lightning bolt.   This energy is measured in calories, with one calorie being about enough for a first degree burn. The heat of the arc flash is what is typically protected against, not the electrical shock. Also worth noting, though you may survive the heat from a significant arc flash, there is also the explosive shock involved, which is a ton harder to protect against, and might still kill ya.   side note, the most important factor in possible arc flash calculations is the impedance of the upstream transformer, followed closely by instantaneous trip settings of the closest upstream breaker."
electricians,39i9ex,CESmokey,5,Fri Jun 12 01:39:58 2015 UTC,"Arc flash isn't something that gets added to a job. It's one of the dangers of working with electricity. The extra cost comes from the safety measures and protective equipment needed to protect us electricians from injury if there is a arc flash.  From Wikipedia   ""An arc flash (also called a flashover), which is distinctly different from the arc blast, is part of an arc fault, a type of electrical explosion that results from a low-impedance connection to ground or another voltage phase in an electrical system."""
electricians,39i9ex,Imaelectrician,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:28:45 2015 UTC,"Arc flash isn't something that gets added to a job.   Yes it does believe it or not. Business owners might only know this but there are 3 requirements for arc flash labeling on commercial and industrial(unless there is qualified personnel on site) service equipment. Most hire an EE to do this work,  but if you can do it yourself, it will save money. NFPA 70 110.16,  110.24 and OSHA and NFPA 70E (I forget where but look up arc flash labeling requirements). The contractor is resonsible for the NFPA 70 codes. Building owners are responsible for the OSHA AND 70E requirements. Basically, you need to calculate the maximum available fault current for the arc flash potential. The reason this is needed, so workers know what rated PPE to use before they work on equipment.   Edit: I would do a tutorial on this but it would take too long and no one would really use it. I might edit this later with a basic run down.  Edit: Look up point to point arc flash method or bussmann method. There are even phone apps for this but I wouldn't trust my business on them."
electricians,39i9ex,RockTheFuckOut,-3,Fri Jun 12 12:01:13 2015 UTC,"Another way to look at the question could be why adding in ""Arc Flash"" cables and receptacles could increase the price of the job.

electricians,39i9ex,Stainzz,3,Fri Jun 12 17:46:44 2015 UTC,"Lot's of good answers here.  To expand on what everyone else is saying here is one example that is more in-depth drunken rambling.  Oh, and safety never cost- it pays.    Electrons are moving back and forth (in AC) across the conductor (wire, buss, whatever)  A small area (millimeters) outside that conductor is considered energized.  The voltage (pressure or force being applied- called 'potential') can push electrons off the conductive surface onto atoms and molecules in the air (atmospheric gases).  These atoms now become Ions, they have an electric charge.      Now Air (atmosphere) is an awesome insulator.  The molecules and atoms are so far apart the pressure (voltage) can't push the electrons though such a vast empty space.  Plus it's mostly nitrogen which is a noble gas. But it's not perfect.     This is where shit goes down hill.  If another conductor get's inside that energized area the electrons cant ravel though that new path it just made for it self.  Anything can be a conductor for this new path.  A forgotten wrench, moisture in the air, dust build up, someone's hand.  When two conductive devices break a connection, like in a switch or circuit breaker, there is always an Arc as the electrons can still push themselves off the conductor.  Not sure of OP's level of knowledge but you know that little spark you see when you flip an old light switch, that's an arc.  Same thing on a micro scale.  Larger Switches and Circuit Breakers are designed to flip quickly (usually in with a spring assist) so the area between the two surfaces quickly separates and the Arc dies off.  They are also made with Arcing Contacts that are made to capture the Arc and direct the Arc into specially insulated containers where it can't cause any more trouble.  Oh and medium and high voltage circuit breakers sometimes are made with vacuum tubes or in special gasses which are designed to extinguish or suppress such Arcs.  But I digress...    Where was I,  Oh yea, next heat is released in the reaction of passing electrons though this ionized gas (called plasma).  BTW, the sun is made of plasma.  So it's hot-like tens of thousands of degrees hot.  Now, heating air to 30,000 degrees is going to cause it to violently expand, called Arc Blast.  It's an explosion, like a bomb.  But wait, there's more.  The electrical conductor (usually copper on aluminum) is right there.  It, in it's room temperature sate, is a solid.  If you heat it up to 30,000 degrees in .025 seconds it will turn into a gas.  The volume expansion rate of copper is something like 60,000 times it's solid volume.  So that is added into the force of the already expanding air and the result is a massive shock wave that is 35,000 degrees Fahrenheit.  (i don't know what that is in Celsius.. because- 'Merica)    Why is it expensive.  Well, it kills people and burns down buildings.  People have families, families have lawyers, and everyone has insurance.  Insurance companies hate paying for burnt down buildings and they really hate paying families and lawyers.  So they (the insurance whores) make someone else people pay for arc flash studies, protective device testing, and all that stuff.    Another reason the cost may be relatively high is that it's done by Electrical Engineers and they don't come cheap.    That's a pretty negative statement; Arc Flash studies are good, protective devices are good, regular testing is good, not burning down the factory is good, not having OSHA crawl 6 feet up your ass is good, not getting killed at work- priceless .  TL:DR- Way too drunk.  Read someone else post, come back to this one if you are bored.   EDIT: Took out a long rant about engineers"

You can make me do all the overtime you want, as long as I can have the occasional half day off when i finish early somewhere. Give your people easy acces to all existing plans, few things are more frustrating than figuring out an electrical plan from scratch while under pressure from a head of production (true story : client decided to store all diagrams in the archive, archive burnt down in the 60's, called in to repair crane and all I got was : it won't start and we're losing 250.000 euro per hour it stands still). Avoid errors when ordering replacement pieces, we won't notice until we hold the old piece and the new one, and we are the ones bearing the brunt of it when we have to explain this to a client. Don't drown your people in administrative work, they were trained to be electricians, they were hired to be electricians, don't make them secretaries. I've had a job were each checkup of a crane i had to write down the same things up to 5 times (notes during check-up/check-up report/daily hours registration, with description/bid request form if repairs needed/registration of findings in binder we kept on each crane), it's a total waste of skilled labour, and a fraud on a customer who's paying prime rates for a secretary.

But you're probably used to that, since you are in the army. Being an electrical apprentice will only look slightly better than being a waitress, to someone looking to hire for electrical engineering.   You should see if your college/university engineering department has job postings.  Also consider looking through the engineering section of the job listings on http://orlando.craigslist.org/, https://www.helpwanted.com/orlando-fl-jobs, whatever state department helps people find jobs in Florida, and any local staffing agencies.  Any of these places may be able to help you find a job or internship in electrical engineering.

electricians,39g7w1,Jabberwocky918,6,Thu Jun 11 15:45:46 2015 UTC,"This SHOULD be an easy fix.  A component on the primary side of the power supply failed open.  It was probably either a low-resistance resistor (like 1Ω or something) or perhaps the bridge rectifier.  You'll see the damage, if there was smoke.  Please open her up, and send me pics of what you find, and I'll walk you through the fix.  What surprises me is that the printer wasn't dual-voltage; most power supplies for consumer electronics tend to tolerate a range of about 85VAC-250ishVAC, simplifying manufacturing for the global market with our varied mains voltages.  If there was a LOT of smoke, it is possible that the transformer cooked, or that there was other damage, but let's hope not.  Can you describe the smell of the smoke?  It's possible that you were seeing the boiled electrolyte steam from a popped cap; still, easy fix."

electricians,39g7w1,Techwood111,2,Thu Jun 11 16:26:24 2015 UTC,"Do you have a soldering iron, or can you get/borrow one?  A cheapo can be purchased for about $5... though not sure where, with Radio Shack gone.  Harbor Freight?  Northern Tool?  Wal-Mart? Do you have a multimeter?  (See sources above; $5ish for a cheapie.) That black beer can in the center is an electrolytic capacitor.  It LOOKS like it is bulged -- is the top domed up, or flat?  Do you see a crack along the ""X"" in the top (made that way so it will burst safely there).  I think that is your point of failure, though we may have taken something else out along the way. The white ceramic thing on the left in pic 2, close to the word ""caution"" and immediately left of the blue rectangle, is a fuse.  It likely went once the capacitor blew. I can send you the parts, you'll have to put them in.  Soldering is easy on something like this.  You'll be able to do it."

electricians,39g7w1,GriffinHunter09,2,Fri Jun 12 01:54:11 2015 UTC,"Look at the specs on that capacitor.  It'll be (some number) µF, and some voltage rating.  Depending on where you live, reach out to a distributor of components.  You want to match the capacitance, and meet or exceed the voltage rating.  You want a radial electrolytic capacitor.  You might as well get a low ESR-rated one; pennies difference.  Order a fuse.  Looks like it is rated at 10A, but check.  Measure it so you get one that will fit.  Before you do, though, verify it is bad by measuring resisitance.  It should read completely open, just like if your probes weren't touching it.  A good one will measure from near-zero to about 1 or 2 ohms, and that is pretty much from the resistance of the meter leads and connections.  Measure resistance, forward and backward, on D1 through D4.  The value for each should match the others; the resistance should be much higher in one direction than the other.  If one is shorted, WHICH I THINK IS PROBABLE (I'll give it a 25% chance), then replace it, too.  There should be a clear marking on them.  The more I look at that bulged cap zoomed in, I think I can see the ""guts"" inside that valley.  It looks like it opened up.  Regardless, if bulged like that, it became resistive and needs to be replaced.  If that doesn't fix it, let me know, and will dig deeper, but I'm betting 85% that this will sort you out."
electricians,39g7w1,Techwood111,3,Fri Jun 12 04:04:21 2015 UTC,"As other users have suggested- Start by checking the fuse- easiest, cheapest, and most likely fix.   However- the black tube shaped thing with white writing on it (next to the metal ""L"") is a capacitor- it's hard to tell from the pics but it appears to have a 'dome' shape top and white substance leaking from it- which would mean it blew up.   If you have acess to a basic meter you can test for continuity to verify if that's the problem. If that has failed you would need to go to an electronicis store and get a new one (Rougly $5) than proceed to solder it on the board.  Good luck."
electricians,39g7w1,shakadora,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:12:51 2015 UTC,"white substance leaking from it   I think it is a sorta glue, bc I saw:   it didn't seem to come from the largest capacitor, 3 capacitors on last photo, green wires & the solenoid (copper coiled thing?) spongy to touch   I may be wrong.Thanks."
electricians,39g7w1,Jim-Jones,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:20:36 2015 UTC,"That is definitely a silicone glue used on larger components to help keep them in place, lessening strain on their solder points.  Don't replace the fuse without fixing the problem; you'll need to replace the fuse again if you try.  In my previous comment, I suggested looking to see if all the capacitors are flat on the top.  Also check for any sort of oily ooze or black crud (not black rubber) coming out from underneath them.  We'll get this fixed, but you WILL need a soldering iron.  If you have any old, unused electronic devices (VCR, TV, etc.) around, it is quite likely that we can harvest the parts you need out of them.  Where in the world are you?

electricians,39g7w1,lookatthatsquirrel,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:17:50 2015 UTC,"The white stuff is visible in other places as well, it's likely glue. The top of that capacitor looks like it's a dome though, instead of being flat, so that may be the issue. First things first though, in the middle picture, next to a blue square block, is a white tube with a metal cap on each end. That's the only fuse i could spot, so see if that one is still ok."

electricians,39g7w1,classicsat,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:25:23 2015 UTC,"Oh, and don't replace the fuse until we fix what made it blow.  Over-voltage didn't kill it.  I believe that over-voltage on the secondary side of the transformer killed that large electrolytic, which vented and became resistive, which drew too much current, which blew the fuse.  Also suspect is the bridge, which looks in the drawing to be the ""tombstone""-shaped thing near the fuse. http://www.futurlec.com/Pictures/Package/KBPM_200.jpg  It is hard to say if that is what that is or not, or if that function is performed by the four individual diodes (small black cylinders with a silver band on each side, D1, D2, D3, and D4, bottom-center of pic 3).  Semiconductors tend to fail shorted, which, in this application, would absolutely draw enough current to blow the fuse."

I'm going to trim about a third off my earnings by making this switch, but the long-term potential is better (not to mention the work is more interesting)."
electricians,39cklw,MechMeister,3,Wed Jun 10 23:53:43 2015 UTC,Very interesting! Here in Denver union apprenticeship starts at 13.71/hr. I will start looking around and see if I know of anyone who's in the union. I'm definitely looking into the long term potential as well and I appreciate your help!

electricians,39abre,mini_mark7,12,Wed Jun 10 20:58:11 2015 UTC,Doesn't have to be.  A bathroom isn't a wet location.
electricians,39abre,JohnProof,2,Wed Jun 10 21:34:16 2015 UTC,You put a stat that close to a water source and see what your AHJ has to say. A bathroom is a damp location. And it is within 5 ft of a sink. It has to be protected from splashing or rated for installation in a damp location.
electricians,39abre,mini_mark7,8,Thu Jun 11 00:12:50 2015 UTC,Inspectors ain't allowed to make up code: None of the devices or fixtures in a bathroom need to be wet location rated outside of a tub surround.  We routinely put regular GFCIs right next to a sink and nobody bats an eye but suddenly everything in this picture has to be damp/wet location rated? I think you're really grasping here.
electricians,39abre,JohnProof,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:22:19 2015 UTC,"Yes. The GFCI is next to the sink. Why do you think it's GFCI protected? Cover plates aid in keeping humidity out of the devices. I'm not grasping. If that stat was above counter height, I'd see no issue. BX exposed in a bathroom? That's gonna rust. And according to code not suitable for use in that instance."
electricians,39abre,mini_mark7,-1,Thu Jun 11 01:31:40 2015 UTC,"Inspectors don't have to. They can over ride code in either direction. My feed going from the meter to the panel is over 30 feet - miles out of code but it passed because it was too grandfathered to change. In another instance, one wouldn't allow GFI within 3 feet of a sink because it had a commercial sprayer, plus a bizarre 45 degree backsplash. Any water that hit it shot for several feet in any direction."

electricians,39abre,whiteout82,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:15:25 2015 UTC,"Wet location thermostats look like one. That is just a run of the mill stat. Even a wet location wouldn't be placed below a source of water, no matter the use."

electricians,39dfks,Jabberwocky918,3,Thu Jun 11 01:03:10 2015 UTC,Please use a heat gun. A lighter will damage the insulation and expose the conductor to the elements and it will corrode.
electricians,39dfks,whittler,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:19:46 2015 UTC,I had more issues with heat guns than with lighters. Using the butane in a portable heat gun burned too hot and would damage the insulation.

''Fuck it Jimmy, put together 6 lengths and we will just fish them across the ceiling and be done with it.''  And then here come the guys that got the job and want to do it right.  Get up on the ladder, your just washed knuckles push up on the tile.  It goes up a half inch and gets stuck.  Must be some duct.  Go down and move the ladder.

electricians,39an9o,Eglitarian,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:55:20 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I thought.  Have to use them to pull back something that you need to use to pull something with.  It can save some time though.  How far do they shoot?
electricians,39an9o,elephant7,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:59:14 2015 UTC,"About 30-35 ft. accurately. It may have gone further if we could put a bigger arc on it. After that it was a crapshoot. It was a lot of fun shooting each other with it, though."

Speaking of which, I can't stand the new electrician guy Ask This Old House uses from time to time.  That guy has the very bad habit of stripping wires using his pliers instead of a wire stripper.  I've worked with guys like that who snicker and say ""it won't damage the wire if you know what you're doing"" but they always score the wire.  It may not break off the first time they twist it, but I've had to go after some people's work where the wire completely broke off in the wirenut.  It's such a lazy thing to do. On another note, I'm not sure why they don't have a resident electrician the way they do with every other trade and only bring that guy in once in a while."

My current apprentice just keep an extra octagon in his pouch when he's boxing and holds it up to a truss with the teeth and makes a mark on the top side to give him the bottom mark of his header.

electricians,39bzn9,mveinot,2,Wed Jun 10 19:17:23 2015 UTC,"Not much without running new wires probably, unless there happens to be an always hot wire capped off inside the box.  If one outlet is already always on, then you replace the outlet with a new one, don't break the tab, and put a cap over the wire that used to go to the hot side of the switched outlet instead of connecting it."
electricians,39bzn9,mveinot,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:19:52 2015 UTC,So the 1 wire will now power both sides?
electricians,39bzn9,mveinot,2,Wed Jun 10 19:37:42 2015 UTC,"In a typical installation where both top and bottom are not switched, there is only one hot wire supplying both outlets (and one neutral, and one ground). Outlets just have the ability to electrically separate the sockets for special cases (one outlet switched, or multi-wire branch circuit, etc) by breaking the tab between screw terminals.  So yes, you'd have one white wire connected on one side (the side with the silver screws and wider plug opening) and one black wire on the other side (with the black or brass screws and the narrower plug opening), plus one green or bare copper wire connected to the usually green ground screw at the top or bottom of the outlet (depending on how you orient your outlets)."
electricians,39bzn9,mveinot,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:18:16 2015 UTC,So I found out it powers both plugs unfortunately. If I take the outlet out of the wall will an extra live wire be obvious to a novice?
electricians,39bzn9,djpyro,2,Thu Jun 11 01:44:59 2015 UTC,"It would be a second black (or possibly red) wire in the box. It may or may not be connected to another wire with a wire nut. Best course of action is turn off the breaker for the outlet, pull it out and take a picture to post here of what you find inside."
electricians,39bzn9,djpyro,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:51:25 2015 UTC,"Welp, I turned off the circuit, took the plate off the wall, chiseled away paint so that I could get to the screws, tried to pull the receptacle out of the wall and it wont budge. I dont think the a-hole who wired it gave enough slack on the wires. I looked in the sides and there didnt appear to be an extra wire.  So I decided to just run an extension cable from the other side of the room and wouldnt you believe it that side of the room is a receptacle with no ground holes in it so I can't plug in.  Whoever wired this house should be disbarred.  Thanks for the help anyway mveinot. Sounds like I have to hire a pro if I want a real solution to this.  I do have a followup question since we're talking about ground plugs. 99% of the plugs in my house are not grounded.  What is your take on a whole house surge protector? I assume getting an electrician to come in and ground like 30 receptacles would cost a small fortune."
electricians,39bzn9,Jim-Jones,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:08:08 2015 UTC,"I have a whole-home surge protector and I recommend it. However, a surge protector does nothing really in the way of replacing the functionality of ground wires.  The whole-home surge protector attempts to prevent power surges originating from outside the house from damaging your electronics and appliances. Ground wires are there to prevent electrical faults within your appliances from electrocuting people by giving the electricity a better path back to the source (instead of through you).  You have a number of options. You can have your wiring redone to provide real grounding at your outlets - this is by far the best option. You can install a GFI outlet as the first outlet in each chain of outlets, then replace all the downstream outlets with 3-pin variety with a sticker indicating ""No equipment ground"" - they won't protect your electronics, but they'll keep you from getting shocked. Or you can replace the circuit breakers for your outlets with the GFI variety. This has more or less the same effect as the previous option."

electricians,39bej6,ithinarine,2,Wed Jun 10 18:38:45 2015 UTC,"Not to be the guy who bases everything off of money, buuuuuuuut...  The pre-employment course costs $5000 dollars, plus textbooks, and you aren't able to claim EI while you're taking the pre-employment course. If you work for a year as a first year, you're making at least $18/hr, and that's for a small resi only company, you'll get more if you go union. If you go to school after working for a year as a first year, your schooling is only around $1000, and you get to claim EI while you're there for your 8 weeks (you get about 60% of what you were making while working full time).   Given that when you are a first year, even if only making $18/hr, your take home pay is going to be about $27,000. As a second year, that is only going to go up by about $5000, the entire cost of your pre-employment course.   During the 8 months after you have done your pre-employment course, you'd make about $21000 as a second year, minus the $5000 you spent on the course, so you're at $16000 profit after a year.   As a first year you'd have made about $27000 in a year, minus only $1000 for schooling. Plus you'll get about $3000 in EI while in school. And you can apply for grants and income support while in school and easily get another $2000-3000 from that, so about $32000 after your first year.   You're basically costing yourself $16000 to fast track yourself to being a second year, before even having a job."
electricians,39bej6,WildeTee,2,Thu Jun 11 00:10:48 2015 UTC,"A few thoughts   Pre-Employment at SAIT (great school by the way)   Pre-employment does NOT fast track you to 2nd year apprentice.  Yes you will write the 1st year Trade Qualification (TQ) Exam, but you will still need to complete your practical hours before you are a second year.  General practice is work the hours then go to school but nothing says you can not do it the other way.  The job market is tight for new start electricians at least in Calgary right now.  Taking the few months in school gives the market time to recover and shows that you are serious about pursuing the trade. When we hire ""green"" electricians we give a heavy preference to pre-employment students.  If you don't have pre-employment or a shining recommendation from a current employee you probably won't even make it to an interview. Many pre-employment applicants fall into the trap of thinking they know what they are doing.  This is not the case, if anything you know just enough to get yourself hurt.  If you take the course when you get to an interview be humble about it or you likely will not hear back.  This is why some companies actively avoid Pre-employment students   Having the pre-employment course under your belt combined with your experience working as a ""helper"" can set you well ahead of other candidates.  Make sure your employer writes you a good reference letter as well to submit with your Resume.  The company I work with has pre-employment apprentices and apprenticeship transfers from other provinces.  Apprenticeship boards talk about how easy it is to transfer but it actually can be a long frustrating process often resulting in a loss of some hours being credited and sometimes a need to re-do some schooling so if you are serious I would call some companies to gauge their thoughts on pre-employment vs not and what they think their hiring will look like when your course is done  So yeah, better financial sense if you can get hired green, but odds of hiring probably increase with the course, just understand it is a starting point and don't get all cocky about it.    Best of Luck"

What you never want to do is cut a copper water line between the part in the ground and the main grounding wire for the building if there is one. (BTW, this is why we bridge around water meters with ground wires).  I can't see a case where that would apply to changing out a water heater. I assume these are gas fired tankless water heaters. If the old water heater was electric and you change to gas all you should need to do is disconnect the AC to the old heater. If the new tankless is electric you'd need an electrician anyway.  There is no 'gadget'. There's a slight chance that a ground resistance tester could be useful, but you'd need to be a sparkie to use one usefully, and I'd have to read the book for half an hour to be sure I was doing it right. Oh, and they cost about $1500!!  I can tell you how I would do this if I saw any risk. I'd look carefully at the wiring and grounding system, try to perceive any risks, and minimize them.  #1 method is to cut all power to the house at the switchboard - open the main breaker if there is one or open all the individual breakers.  #2 is a new grounding system if needed that complies with local codes.

Not going to get into here what I had to clean up outside of the panel. As you can see, there was non-functioning antient Generac unit wired in and on top of completely overcrowded panel there were bunch of circuits that were spliced right after the breaker in the panel. I hired an electrician, who did such hack job cleaning out the Generac wiring, that my panel had so many wingnuts, it looked like a lady in a salon with dozens of curlers. He also did not bother replacing all those breakers that weren't compatible and were just jammed in there. He sure charged me for them. Long story. Will leave that alone.  I lost my patience and circuit by circuit, weekend by weekend, I traced all the circuits, replaced bunch of wiring all the way to outlets, and ran a separate sub-panel to alleviate the overcrowding. Took me 6 months of doing it at night, when family was asleep.  I've spent a lot of time researching the 2011 and 2014NEC and I think I got the panel now close to code.

electricians,39795d,mrfloopa,3,Tue Jun 9 19:34:20 2015 UTC,"So first thing is to turn off electricity to the circuit at the breaker box, you shouldn't get sparks when working on switches because that means your wires are live, that is typically bad.  It's not enough that the switches are off.  Reading your post I would recommend you call the electrician and have him come back and sort out the switches in the order you prefer. The potential difference between neutral and ground is 0, the spark was more likely the hot touching the metallic base of the switch or similar. The switch might have been damaged when you shorted it and could need replacement, take it out and study it for any damage.  Then call your electrician."
electricians,39795d,goingdiving,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:05:52 2015 UTC,"Being careful is key. With proper precautions, working with any circuits you can see that, unless the circuit is complete, you're basically touching one end of a battery. When a switch is off, there is no complete circuit. I've changed plenty of live (but off, meaning no complete circuit) switches understanding that concept and practicing common sense precautions, mostly because these places did not have accessible circuit breakers. I believe the standard of powering down everything is relatively recent. This is the first time I accidentally connected two things that shouldn't be, because the box is very crowded. Of course, this particular instance illustrates that plenty other annoyances can come up, and accidents do happen. Live and learn. I won't be doing that again in the interest of avoiding issues like this.  I really don't see why an electrician is needed for such a simple fix. Unless this somehow caused a problem with wiring in the walls, I don't understand why I need the expertise of an electrician to disconnect and reconnect dead wires. I know enough to know this is a simply DIY thing plenty of homeowners can do, and your repeated insistence on paying for this comes across as condescending. I made a minor mistake, and won't make it again. I simply wanted to dot my i's and cross my t's. What am I missing that requires an electrician? Especially since I had a master electrician consult on site and he said, verbatim, ""I don't know,"" and didn't seem very interested in doing anything to help as much as billing for showing up.  I appreciate your helpful input, though. The switches have no obvious damage to the outside, but I'll tear one apart to look inside, and probably replace all four.  e: what are you referring to when you say metallic base of the switch? Obviously two wires with no current will have a voltage difference of 0 and nothing will occur when they touch—where did I seem to indicate those were the two that touched?"
electricians,39795d,goingdiving,2,Tue Jun 9 23:26:18 2015 UTC,"I see that you have edited your original question as pertains to potential between neutral and protective ground, but you had several other misconceptions in it, one where your terms was for DC not AC that another poster noted. The rule to work on zero potential has been around a long time, at least 25 years where I come from. Seeing that Edison promoted DC voltage as better by electrocuting animals with AC seem to indicate that zero voltage potential was a rule in place for a long time.   That you definitely should have zero potential in a circuit when working in a wet space (bathroom) is so common sense that not doing it is a litmus test, for me at least, that the person should not dabble further. If you can't access the circuit breaker to make sure you can work safely is an even bigger issue, that points to the breaker box not being up to code. Having zero potential not only protects you from getting a potentially deadly shock, but also from what happened here with hot wires shorting out your circuit and damaging electrical components. Had you made sure of zero potential this ""minor annoyance"" wouldn't have happened.   If a master electrician looked at your work and said ""I don't know"" means either it's a mess he doesn't want to touch or he's just a bad electrician and should not be consulted further.   Now back to your original question, you said you wanted to learn from the experience and something you should learn is to always work on a zero potential circuit, then you will not have issues like damaging switches or burning fuses, go and get a new switch of the same type, measure your leads, turn off the circuit, attach all wires correctly and then switch the circuit back on and you will not have this issue again.  You are correct that the changing of a switch is very basic and should, in most cases, not lead to anything untowards."

Thank you for your value judgement, but the physics behind an electrical circuit are not that complex and safety is incredibly easy when you use common sense and actually understand how electricity works. I suspect even some electricians (if you are one) may simply be following dogma if they think any contact between hot and metal can create a short, as your original comment seemed to indicate. I don't know how you keep your bathroom that it is so different than a light switch elsewhere, but mine isn't wet all over all the time.   Now back to your original question,   I'm glad you finally made it to the point I asked after your pontification. Since nobody raised any real concerns, I basically rewired the entire light tract after finding which switch was giving me trouble, using basic principles of physics and a multimeter.

If you think they are so simple, you'd probably be able to give better advice or not make nonsense comments about things that wouldn't cause a blow, like randomly stating neutral and ground won't spark.

electricians,394u8e,almost_a_troll,2,Wed Jun 10 01:34:09 2015 UTC,I think normally you run bare copper from ground rods to the neutral in the service panel. Then it gets distributed through the house with proper 3 wire cable.  Mayhap I can just run from ground to the neutral and back out to the outlets via cables running under house?  I don't have a proper budget to have it done professionally.  It's either this place or under a bridge.
electricians,394u8e,73IH810,0,Tue Jun 9 09:20:45 2015 UTC,"I have seen houses where the grounds and neutrals were twisted together in the neutral bar in the panel. I have also seen where a house wired like this lost its neutral line at the utility transformer on the pole and it fried every electronic device in the house, which the utility denied any responsibility for due to the house not having the proper grounding."
electricians,394u8e,kidcharm86,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:43:59 2015 UTC,"Uhh, okay. There's also places where it's allowable to do it like that, and panels that are rated to have multiple conductors in one terminal. So if there was a problem with the grounding, that wasn't it."
electricians,394u8e,KingdaToro,3,Wed Jun 10 18:24:26 2015 UTC,"You are going to have to run new conductors to the outlets that you want protected. Whether it be single conductor THHN 12 or 14 Green or NM12/2 w/ ground Romex. First, you need to install a ground rod (just one) and then with a rod clamp bare #6 (for 100A system) or #4 (200A system). Run the bare ground wire into your panel and into an aftermarket grounding bar, which will keep your grounds and neutrals separate. You can then start running either single conductor grounds or new Romex circuits to the outlets you need grounding protection on. This would be cost effective since you can do just a few circuits at a time. Later on, if you want to rewire the whole house, you have the grounding system ready at the panel. This would be the correct way to ground your circuits, any other way and you will have to remove it before you go to sell the house due to it not being up to code."

electricians,394u8e,Russz,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:10:24 2015 UTC,Neutral and grounds separate? Why do I keep seeing mention of having the ground applied to the neutral bar at the service panel then?
electricians,394u8e,Red-Rocket7,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:35:44 2015 UTC,"Neutrals and grounds have to be kept separate everywhere EXCEPT the main panel. This is to prevent return current from flowing through grounding conductors and potentially energizing metal housings connected to the grounding conductor. They're connected at the main panel to ensure that the neutral remains at ground potential, the neutral is grounded at the pole but this acts as a backup. What someone said about the transformer losing its neutral and all their stuff frying, this happened because they didn't have their grounding conductors connected TO THE GROUND via ground rods and the plumbing.  The NEC actually refers to neutral conductors as grounded conductors and grounding conductors as just that, grounding conductors. It's vitally important that the neutral conductors remain grounded, and the connection to the grounding system at the main panel helps ensure that."

If you move them to be between the operators instead of directly centered on them, you can get both wires in to it and can finagle the wires to line up exact.   Also the wires on the top where everyone is mentioning throwing wire duct: if you keep the wires in the same order the whole run, it looks a lot more organized."

You can then also adjust the wires to be the perfect length. I personally had issues today running wires through an OL relay because it's for a VFD bypass panel and I needed one wire to come from the right contactor's relay and then all the other wires to the OL relay came from the left. I'm still trying to figure how if I have a better way but I don't have duct on the right side and it's at the edge of the panel. O well.

electricians,393rzl,peteygrizz,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:57:50 2015 UTC,I had a problem with Klein tips breaking. Threes 5 in 1s in a row the large flathead broke when trying to torque down on a lug. Using an Ideal multi tip driver now and it has outlasted them all so far.
electricians,393rzl,peteygrizz,0,Wed Jun 10 01:55:19 2015 UTC,"Klein might be the best for electricians, but you can get their off-brands with the same build quality for a lot cheaper. Like Blue-point is Snap-on's off-brand. As a side note, Klein's multimeter is crap."
electricians,394gzz,MisterTito,3,Tue Jun 9 04:54:34 2015 UTC,I'd move out. Its a sinking ship.

electricians,394gzz,Jim-Jones,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:49:48 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I'd call the city and ask for the electrical dept.  That was for the days when you only had lights and maybe a radio - no other appliances. The landlord is way overdue for a rewire here. No way there should be an electric range (it isn't gas?) on that IMO, or an A/C. What sort of heat and hot water?  And I see double tapped fuses in that joke of a box."
electricians,394gzz,Jabberwocky918,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:33:05 2015 UTC,"I've got some updated info in a comment here.   Also, the range on my stove is gas. What I meant by electric with that is that the temp controls for the oven, clock, oven light and the starters for the gas eyes are electric. I doubt it pulls a lot of power, but if it doesn't have any power it doesn't work.  The circuit the A/C window unit, in the living room anyhow, seems to be running directly to the basement and isn't on the circuits served by the fuse box in the apartment. As for hot water, that also is not in the apartment itself. I assume it's gas, but it's shared between apartments. Not sure what the setup is on that though.  Thanks for the info and suggestions. I tried to look up city guidelines or who I might contact for some kind of inspection but didn't get much clear info. I might still dig around on that though because I don't trust that my property managers are on the up-and-up with this kind of stuff."
electricians,394gzz,FishPumpkin,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:43:36 2015 UTC,"When the apartment was built in the 20's or 30's, electrical loads were entirely different than they are now. Microwaves, personal computers, LCD TVs, etc didn't exist. The highest electrical loads were in the kitchen appliances, save for the big cabinet radios. Three rooms on one circuit wasn't a big deal back then.  Update your renter's insurance, comply with the managers for the moment, and head over to /r/legaladvice to see what they say about calling a third party out to your apartment."
electricians,394gzz,Jim-Jones,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:38:40 2015 UTC,"I've got some updated info in a comment here.   They got an electrician out today, and he seem to fix some of the problems. He was a third party, not their maintenance person, and he wasn't too impressed by the wiring or setup. I'm not too sure about persuing any kind of legal action yet. But I definitely do need to check on my renters insurance. Most of my correspondence with my property managers has been via email so that I have a record of it, just in case."
electricians,394gzz,FishPumpkin,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:48:53 2015 UTC,"Definitely see what /u/Jim-Jones and /u/Jabberwocky918 have said about talking to the city and seeking legal advice.  As to the problem at hand, the ""attrition"" of your circuit capacity is most likely due to the mini breaker wearing out. As breakers trip repeatedly, the bi-metal strip inside becomes elongated, which causes them to progressively trip at lower amperage. I would ditch the breaker and get a few more 20-amp fuses, preferably the ""time delay"" (type T or TL) kind so that the refrigerator doesn't blow it with its inrush current.  Also, what circuits do the other 30-amp fuses feed? Is it possible that you could temporarily relocate the microwave or maybe your computer to an outlet served by one of those?  Edit: Just saw your edit. If you don't use the A/C that much, I would move the microwave over to one of the unused outlets. Also, you don't have four circuits in that box. You only have two. The hot and neutral on each circuit are both fused."
electricians,394gzz,Jim-Jones,2,Tue Jun 9 14:55:21 2015 UTC,The hot and neutral on each circuit are both fused.   Looks like two poles (120/240 volts) with two fuses on each to me.
electricians,394gzz,Jabberwocky918,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:09:05 2015 UTC,"You might be right, but I don't see a neutral if it is 2-pole. Could be in that bundle of taped wires, though."

electricians,392avz,Jim-Jones,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:27:51 2015 UTC,"From what I've been told, they limit the maximum wattage of the lamps to a set value. You put in 60W lamps, it forces them to stay at 40W. These limiters get hot and they act like a thermal cutout on a recessed light. I've removed burnt ones that simply caught fire, and I've had calls where the customer says ""the light on the fan has a mind of its own"". Today was the first encounter with a dimmer though. No matter how you set the trim adjust on the dimmer it severely strobes. Remove this gadget, everything is fine."

electricians,391492,JohnProof,2,Mon Jun 8 15:51:25 2015 UTC,"First question:  This looks like a subpanel, under what conditions were you making a connection between neutral and ground?  Those should be separate.  That said, in a subpanel, or even any remote branch circuit, there will be a voltage difference between neutral and ground if there is current flowing on the neutral conductor.  Any conductor with current flow will experience voltage drop, as there should not be current flowing on the equipment ground it will not have the same voltage drop so there will be a potential difference between the two."

electricians,391492,lookatthatsquirrel,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:54:21 2015 UTC,"Arcing is only normal if you have a load on the hot.  If you hooked up the hot first and the breaker was on, you would get arcing on the neutral.  2.4 VAC is not enough voltage to create any sort of issue.  Just think of 12VDC in your car, 24VAC thermostats, 48 VDC phone lines, and anything else low voltage.   2.4 is just a ghost voltage.   Back to the neutral arcing. That shouldn't happen unless you had the circuit energized.  That is a great way to unexpectedly shock or electrocute yourself."
electricians,391492,ACDCbaggs,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:59:59 2015 UTC,The neutral is only arcing between the neutral and the ground. The breaker is off. There is no arcing between the neutral and the hot.

electricians,391492,johansense1,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:16:55 2015 UTC,"While it probably doesn't apply to this panel, SOME bus bars do allow for more than one wire to be landed under one lug. Also, when the panel and bus bar were manufactured and installed may also play into the acceptability of landing more than one wire under a lug. Granted, there's plenty of room in this panel... As a general rule with our ever changing code base, something that seems wrong to us today may have been legal in years past. Just look at houses wired in the 50's with a separate bare ground from the bathroom receptacle box to the galvanized drain/vent pipe and wrapping around it 3 or 4 times."

All in all a little arcing is normal on the neutral bar."
electricians,391492,skippydudeah,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:43:13 2015 UTC,"This is a sub panel, hopefully?  Is this panel fed from a transformer? Is this voltage present with no load, some load, and all loads? How far away is the main panel/transformer from this panel? Is the feed in conduit the entire run, or does it share space in a cable tray with other large loads? It may be something simple like misbehaving old equipment, bad wiring practices, or it could be a subtle hint before a major failure of a UPS system or melting conductors/bus bars. What prompted you to check neutral to ground, and with what kind of meter did you get this result?  If you have access and are qualified, check for neutral to ground voltage at the main panel/distribution. If it's present there, you might look at the grounding. If the voltage is not there, you may want to check the integrity of the neutral connection between the main and the sub."
electricians,391492,peteygrizz,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:54:29 2015 UTC,"i would check your main grounding point- In australia, we have earth stakes and a bond on to the main water pipe, - check that these have a good connection, as that""ghost voltage should disappear down to earth???

electricians,391492,kidcharm86,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:11:21 2015 UTC,Do you guys put a link between the main neutral bar and earth bar?
electricians,391492,TurnbullFL,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:12:29 2015 UTC,this is a sub panel. the neutral to ground bond should be upstream.
electricians,391492,mksmth,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:17:12 2015 UTC,Interesting.  I have a similar situation in one of my work panels. If you  take an uninsulated screwdriver across the neutral bar to ground it actually hums quite loud.  Raking any neutral across a junction box creates a small visible arch even with that circuits breaker turned off.  Please report back if you find the cause
electricians,391492,TurnbullFL,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:08:10 2015 UTC,you need to run a wire out to the other end of the neutral and then measure the voltage across both ends of the neutral wire.  then investigate why you have 2.4 volts across two ends of a rather large wire.. why don't you measure the amps flowing through a jumper from neutral to ground.
electricians,392nxd,HitTheTwit,5,Mon Jun 8 20:33:05 2015 UTC,It sounds like you need to call a qualified electrician. It also sounds like you know just enough to be dangerous.  The small box is a disconnect for the A/C. You can not use it as a sub panel.   That is all I am willing to say.
electricians,392nxd,stewtron89,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:00:28 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your response and the intention behind it.  I will not ever do anything I'm not 100% sure about.  That being said, I've switched over to a breaker box, rewired an entire house, and added a sub panel in the past, all with the guidance of an electrician.  Unfortunately, he's no longer with us.  I'm fine with adding circuits, though have never had a set up like I posted about.  Hence my questions.  I know I would absolutely need to have the electric company kill my power to work in the meter box.  Other than that, I won't touch a bloody thing until I'm 100% sure of what it is and what I'm doing."
electricians,392nxd,IrishDemon,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:12:22 2015 UTC,"1) It's a non fused disconnect, a switch (which is written on the inside on the top left). You open the door, pull the handle out, and it breaks the connection removing power to the equipment.   2) Possibly, but that would require better pictures of the entire panel(s) and meter. If your panel only has one space free and you want to add 3 circuits, you may need to swap some breakers out to compact/stacked style, if the manufacturer makes them for your panel, and if you're not too close to the panel's max rating. Needing something special requires more information. You don't automatically need a GFCI breaker. Also, in relation to your reply to /u/stewtron89, you shouldn't need the utility to kill power to your panel as you won't be doing anything on their side. Start with better pictures."
electricians,391cuv,JimsFlight,4,Mon Jun 8 15:16:11 2015 UTC,The resistance of the fuses is around 3.8 ohms.   Total load 14.5 amps.       That works out to 800 watts being dissipated by the fuse.  Way too much Resistance there.
electricians,391cuv,TurnbullFL,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:35:05 2015 UTC,Agreed.  This doesn't sound like a current issue but rather an overtemp issue.  I would wager a resistance reading that high is being measured through a loose fuse clip and not the fuse proper.
electricians,391cuv,JohnProof,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:21:49 2015 UTC,"Right, the fuse itself should be a few hundredths of an ohm."
electricians,391cuv,TurnbullFL,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:44:21 2015 UTC,See that's what I thought. I took the fuses out and tested them on the bench. They seemed to come out High. I'll try with another multimeter and take some photos for you guys tonight.   --edit--  Had a look tonight. Seems like one of the fuses has a resistance of a few ohms. Could be a dud?
electricians,391cuv,TurnbullFL,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:43:44 2015 UTC,"To measure low resistance like this, you would short the meter leads together, see what it reads.  Then measure the component, and subtract the short reading.      Are the fuses tight in the holders? And the wires and lugs tight on the holder?"
electricians,391cuv,wikatca,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:12:07 2015 UTC,"Yep. Connections to the holder seem okay, as do the fuses. There's a change (~1 ohm) in resistance when measuring the holder with the fuses in it. I'm thinking something internal to the holder isn't right. Trouble is by design I can't get in there to check. It's the only hot component. Will replace it with one I have a compliance cert for and see if the trouble is fixed."

electricians,391cuv,avtechguy,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:26:55 2015 UTC,"if that's the case, try checking where the wiring meets the element. You may find your culprit is just loose wiring to the heater elements."
electricians,391cuv,bazilbt,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:29:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll check that out tomorrow. I did notice that one of the ceramic spacers on bolts that hold on the element was a little lose, but it didn't seem like a loose wire. I'll have a look tomorrow none the less. Just so I get your logic though, if there was a bad connection on the element, that would mean the machine would draw more current. If that were to occur, and it went above 20A, the breakers would pop. I don't know if I mentioned it, but the breakers are rated less than the fuses and don't flick off. I thought it seemed weird that the fuses would go, but the breakers would be fine."

electricians,391w21,Jim-Jones,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:39:57 2015 UTC,Canada.  I was thinking the same thing as black white and green are usually pretty standard. I was not certain though as there hasn't been anything installed there since I moved in.  The switch in standard.

electricians,3915b5,TheJeezus,2,Mon Jun 8 14:18:35 2015 UTC,"Here is your correct wiring which looks good. If you're blowing the start capacitor immediately, you probably have a different problem. I'm assuming the shaft spins freely. Have you inspected the wiring for damage? Possibly a short to the case?"
electricians,3915b5,RoninRobot,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:42:14 2015 UTC,"Back story: I recently took my pump to the local pool shop to check the pump seal and motor (all good), and they asked if I wanted the capacitor replaced while they've got it. I said no, as long it looks good. I get it home, hook it back up and the capacitor blows immediately. Pop, smoke, oil, etc. So, I get a new one, and replace it, but I hook up the leads the way they were arranged on the blown cap (see image).   Flip the switch and it blows the new cap too. So now I'm thinking maybe the pool shop incorrectly re-installed the capacitor when it was in the shop  Thanks."
electricians,3915b5,Jim-Jones,3,Mon Jun 8 14:19:55 2015 UTC,"It looks OK as I see it but that proves nothing. If you blew two, looks like it's mis-wired across the AC input. I'd have to trace it out."

This is 2 hots with a shared neutral.   The thing that you will want to look for are quad breakers. There will be 4 handles on them, a pair in the middle tied together for 240V, as well as a single15A on the top and bottom.   You do need to make sure though that you aren't putting too many circuits in your panel, on the sticker on it there should be two numbers separated by a slash. Based on the panel schedule picture you posted, your panel has 30 breaker slots, so the number should be ""30/XX"". The second number is the maximum number of circuits you can have in the panel, you aren't allowed to exceed that number.   Edit: the part number you'll want is HOMT1515215, you can swap the last 3 numbers with 220, 230, 240, or 250 to change the rating of the middle 2 breakers. You can also change the first numbers to 2020 to have single 20s depending on your needs."

For instance, one of the tandem breakers would have 2 black wires and the other would have 2 red wires - so the lines are still drawing from both sides of the panel as they are now?   I don't have a lot of room for a slave panel because there is inadequate stud spacing - the current panel has already had to have a stud cut and moved over so the panel would fit. Also, the walls aren't drywall - they're 3/4"" tongue and groove knotty pine, so they're a bitch to access."

electricians,38zsuf,ithinarine,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:13:04 2015 UTC,"I guess that wouldn't give me the ability to add the 240v breakers I need for my AC units since the quad breakers, as I understand them, only add 2 single pole 120v circuits in addition to the 240v that will need to be swapped from its current spot into the center lugs. Is that right? What would you recommend, just adding a sub-panel?"
electricians,38zsuf,jamesgor13579,2,Mon Jun 8 06:10:57 2015 UTC,"What does the left side of your panel look like? It looks like you have a couple more tandem breakers over there that could possibly be changed to quads to make room.

electricians,38z2di,XirallicBolts,2,Tue Jun 9 01:25:16 2015 UTC,"These particular lights are only 9w each, which is 75mA at 120v.  If my maths are correct, that's about 160 of these lights on a 15A 120v circuit.  Picture 1 - The lights as they arrived Picture 2 - Mounted the drivers to a board for splicing Picture 3 - Lights installed in ceiling Picture 4 - Lights and cabinet lighting, full brightness Picture 5 - Lights only, full brightness Picture 6 - Lights only, opposite wall, full brightness Picture 7 - Lights only, minimum brightness    The glare is just from the camera. They are bright but don't 'blind' you.  They flicker a bit at the bottom end of the brightness range but for $10 each they all give a nice white light and have been working months without issue.  Overall I'd say 'comfortable installing my own house but would not install in a customer's unless they are a friend that understands the drawbacks and risks of knockoff lighting'  And an example auction here.

So, simply adding a dropped ceiling won't make a huge difference.  We recently (successfully!) sound-proofed the ceiling in a kitchen. Here is what we did:   we installed RC channels that mechanically decouples the ceiling from the rest of the house. Essentially, the ceiling is now suspended from little rubber bumpers. we put up special sound-proof sheet rock and used ""green glue"" everywhere. we very carefully sealed every tiny gap with special sound-proofing caulk.   The results were very impressive. Can't hear anything through this ceiling now. Of course, if we had cut openings for recessed lights, that would completely defeat most of our efforts.  So, instead we bought LED flat panels. These are normally intended to be dropped into the frames of office-style recessed ceilings. But with a bit of effort, they can be install as surface mounted light fixtures. We put a nice ""window trim"" around the entire light fixture.  When we now turn the lights on, it looks as if there was a skylight on the other side of it. Very nice visual effect. And lots of bright light."

electricians,38z2di,lookatthatsquirrel,2,Mon Jun 8 10:27:11 2015 UTC,"Also, do some research on the brand of retrofit trim you are looking at getting. The good ones tend to have at least 100,000hr life expectancy with very long lumen consistency over it's life as well. As a counter guy who has sold/seen different brands, I would go with a RAB DLED. We sell lots of them and the electricians love them. Bright and dimmable (need to have a compatible dimmer, which they should list on whatever brand of trim you end up getting; the better brands tend to have a wider variety of compatible dimmers than the cheaper ones). The 6"" is going to give you the most light. With the brand of recessed cans that we sell the 6"" is cheaper than the 5"" and 4"" can. Also it's usually better to find an actual electrical supply with a showroom that sells this stuff, than it is going to the big box stores. The employees tend to know their products better and can help you with your specific needs. Cheers!  Ninja edit: Most established recessed can manufaturers will have a ""shallow"" version of most of their cans, so if you're worried about the space between the grid ceiling and the studs getting in the way, you should have an option of a shallower can. They tend to be more money though."

electricians,38xw32,arabjuice,10,Sun Jun 7 21:15:31 2015 UTC,Putting the treadmill on a 15 amp circuit will cause the breaker to trip. Do not put a 30 amp outlet in and use that it's most likely 240 volt. If the wire in the ceiling is not connected to anything else you could put a 20 amp outlet in and change the breaker in the panel to a single 20 amp use a blank to close the other slot
electricians,38xw32,Sparky_yarf,8,Sun Jun 7 20:10:45 2015 UTC,"It's possible it doesn't use the full 16 amps, but you'd need to measure the current to be sure.  Yes, a new run is the best bet here."
electricians,38xw32,Jim-Jones,3,Sun Jun 7 21:07:30 2015 UTC,"I'm just confused as to why the treadmill didn't trip the breaker during the initial test. It was on for a few minutes at a reasonable speed with somebody running on it. One of my friends, who has some reasonable knowledge of electrical work, thinks that treadmills generally don't use the power for which they are rated unless you are under extreme circumstances. I'm not too keen on spending upwards of $500 to run a new circuit for the treadmill when I don't own the house. It does look like my only option is to run the circuit, in any event."

electricians,38xw32,drcujo,6,Mon Jun 8 00:55:38 2015 UTC,The safe thing to do is to have a new circuit run for the treadmill. It doesn't hurt to ask the electrician how much ballpark it would be to get it done when he is there.
electricians,38xw32,drcujo,3,Sun Jun 7 21:09:37 2015 UTC,"There are a few things to consider here.  Your treadmill requires a 20a circuit, and probably won't run for an extended period of time on a 15a circuit.   You could install a 5-20r(a) in place of a regular 15a receptacle and it might work fine like the delivery guy said but installing a 20A receptacles on a 15a circuit is not allowed.   I wouldn't really suggest doing this, but this is a cheap and easy solution that may work. In theory the breaker should trip before it is dangerous.   The best way (and only way to code) is to run a new circuit back to the panel.  12\2, 20a breaker.   Do not share the dryer circuit or put #14 on anything bigger then a 15a breaker."
electricians,38xw32,lookatthatsquirrel,2,Sun Jun 7 20:13:32 2015 UTC,"Given a 30 foot span, how much do you think that an electrician would ask for to run the new circuit back to the panel? Granted, I understand this would be a ballpark estimate without more information."
electricians,38xw32,lookatthatsquirrel,3,Sun Jun 7 20:18:32 2015 UTC,300+
electricians,38xw32,lookatthatsquirrel,2,Sun Jun 7 20:54:45 2015 UTC,"This sounds more reasonable. 300+ for everything is a fair rough number.   Basement might need a GFI receptacle.  20 amp TR is 25 or could use a 65$ QO breaker.  Might take 2 hours to fish the wire.  All of this is dependent on OP's house.  It could very easily be 200 if everything works great, but I would lean on the $300 range like you are."
electricians,38xw32,Malgidus,3,Sun Jun 7 21:10:16 2015 UTC,"Assuming the most pain-in-the-ass circumstances, and about 30-40 feet of wire, plus materials, is under $500 still a fair estimate? I will certainly ask the electrician tomorrow, but I just want to know what may be coming. The basement is all insulation, which is a majority of the distance to the garage. It's just getting it up a floor that seems like the major hindrance. It just seems like a big deal in my mind, but I've never seen this done, so maybe I'm just exaggerating it."
electricians,38xw32,lookatthatsquirrel,3,Sun Jun 7 21:24:25 2015 UTC,"Worst case scenario would be 500 for a single circuit.  Fishing the wire is the hardest part. Post some pics of your basement and the route needed and we could get a closer number.  Without seeing everything, $300 +/- a few dollars is probably what you are working with.  Whether or not you need GFI protection could raise the price $30-75.  That would put you closer to $200.  Again, can't tell without being there or at least seeing pictures."

electricians,38xw32,boytyperanma,5,Sun Jun 7 22:07:10 2015 UTC,"Oh shit.  Your panel is all the way in the front of the garage.  I would talk to your electrician about getting a subpanel installed in the basement at this time if they are going to have to traverse the outside with conduit or run conduit along the box sill of the garage.  Your price just went up to the $600-700 range with that location of the panel.    One circuit isn't that much in material, the labor is the expensive part.  I would look into getting a little bit more work done than just the one circuit.  You might need to consider spending $1000 or so for some work just to have it done all at once.  Either that or put the treadmill in the garage."

electricians,38urue,Jim-Jones,6,Sun Jun 7 19:30:28 2015 UTC,"I'm an Electrical Engineer working for a major electrical contractor in management.  My day to day tasks include designing distribution systems and planning jobs down to ordering material and coordinating tools. It's not a fast paste life but it definitely keeps you on your toes. There's a nice balance of office work and ""field"" work. I put quotes around field because I'm not a field employee so I can not perform any productive labor tasks. My field work consists of visiting with customers, doing take offs, meeting with vendors, taking classes, etc.   My company offers two paths for getting to where I'm at. College education in degrees such as engineering and construction management, or working your way up through the field.  There's benefits to either side. The engineer side allows a very complex thought process (not saying field employees don't posses this trait, but with engineers you have to have this trait to survive, contrary to popular belief) which allows for great problem solving skills. Upper level managers love seeing this because they're always looking for new ways to solve the same problems. Whether they be problems on the job site or problems in the office.  Working your way up through the field offers the skill of experience. THERE IS NO AMOUNT OF SCHOOLING THAT CAN EQUATE TO THIS! I don't care what the bean counters think. You personably know how long it takes to install a 600A disconnect and feed a machine 30' away. I know what the program tells me and then perform a sanity check (no way it takes only 1 hour or no way it'll take 40 hours). If my program says it'll take 12 hours and you've done it in 8, I've just overbid my job by $500 and potentially lost it to a competitor.   The downside to each side. Well, you've presumably just (or are about to) finish up your 5th year in the apprenticeship program. So after that you're going to go to school for another 5 years (my college has it as a 4 year plan but it really takes 5). And doing so will add up to a lot of debt...a lot of debt. Also, some keywords in the field hold different meanings in engineering. A simple example, today I spent 6 hours doing a LOTO refresher and NFPA 70 E training (yes, on a Saturday, and yes, unpaid, another benefit of being a manager). When talking about energy storage devices for LOTO, motors and capacitors came up. Everyone I talked to referred to capacitors holding an inductive charge. To a field guy that term will work because you will correlate that to meaning it has potential energy built in it; however, capacitors do not hold an inductive charge. This will become confusing in circuits courses if you've been told the wrong terminology for 5 years.   Downside to the field approach. You're going to have to spend 5-10 years in the field minimum before management may feel you're material to be put on a track to be placed in management.   One additional upside to field work that the president of my company so kindly informed a freshly graduated class of engineers in a lunch and learn. You start making money as soon as you hit the apprenticeship program while the college kids start acquiring debt. So the net monetary values of each side go opposite directions at the beginning.   My recommendation to you is to talk to your manager and ask what options are available. Tell them you want to be a manager and in what timeframe. They should help you develop a personal development plan and then you can go from there.   Please feel free to PM me if you have any specific questions."

The feed comes in and attaches to a grounding block that is attached to earth ground, then the coax output is connected to distribution splitters for the house runs.

electricians,38tawv,turduckenpillow,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:07:58 2015 UTC,"Sounds pretty good to me. You'll have to get a cover plate to use with a plug and an octagon box. For your amperage and voltage. Just check then full load amps of the fridge, should be on the box or on the fridge somewhere and see what else is on the circuit then add your amps together. Voltage should just be 120v. Same as your light would've been. Come back if it's different for some reason but I would find that unusual. I've never seen a fridge that isn't 120v.   Not sure about US, but in Canada we generally put 12 devices on a circuit and assume a draw averaging 1 amp per plug. If you have a mix of plugs and lights it's less likely to be a big deal as one light won't draw 1 amp. And we would count that light as one ""device."" But if your whole entertainment center is on the same circuit, and maybe a computer or two, or other high usage areas you can run into issues with it being too much.  Did the light have a switch built in? Like a pull string?  A note for the future. A normal circuit in your house (assuming your supply is 120V/208V) will be at 120v. Every device you plug in will be rated to see 120v. That's constant across them all. An easy way to picture current (not exactly correct but it'll work for what you want to know) is how much power will be drawn by everything on a circuit. If you have a 15 amp breaker it will allow 15 amps of current to pass through it before it trips and opens the circuit. It's purpose is to open the circuit and not allow current flow if it goes over the 15 amps available."

It is next to impossible to get that fixed where it comes into the box with how much cable is left for slack.  No more exposed conductor than is on the screws on the receptacle or the light socket.  There is nothing in the plastic box besides the ground that will hit that.  Not that big of a deal, just super sloppy."
electricians,38tawv,robstoon,0,Sat Jun 6 22:11:08 2015 UTC,"Not a pro, but I've never managed to slash the insulation on cable like that. Usually I just slit the jacket down the center over the ground wire right at the end just enough so you can get a grip on the jacket, and at least with the Romex Sim-pull stuff you can usually just grab it and peel it back from that point, then snip off the jacket part. Even if you did do it sloppily and nick the wire insulation doing it like that, it would be nicked at the end, not way up by the cable clamp where it's impossible to repair."
electricians,38tawv,ACDCbaggs,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:09:08 2015 UTC,That is from pulling the cables into the box and the jacket slips back along the cable.

In the process of doing this, they dig into the conductor.  Scoring both sides allows the jacket to break off squared at the end instead of that amateur sloppy V-notch you see on cables inside of boxes.

You will probably run into people who will try to refute a lot of what I described because it seems contrary to what they have been taught for much of their career. The NEC didn't even make a distinction between grounding and bonding until 2008 (iirc, although it may have been 2005).

electricians,38qiyy,JohnProof,5,Sat Jun 6 16:02:56 2015 UTC,"So when you have a hot and a neutral wire very close together running through a cable or conduit, the magnetic field created by the current in the hot wire induces a tiny amount of current in the neutral wire. When people first started using alternating current, they found out that this induced current can alter the electrical potential of the neutral, meaning that you won't always have the voltage you designed the system to have. They also figured out that, if you connect the neutral to the Earth, the induced current will 'stabilize'. It is still there, but it becomes MUCH more predictable and you can now design systems to provide the voltage you want.    This is sorta misleading.  Yes, there is coupling in any system where conductors are run close together, but that doesn't have to do with the hot and neutral. The potential between hot and neutral is fixed in place by the construction of the transformer/generator and the connection of the loads.  It doesn't change regardless of whether a system is grounded or ungrounded.   You ground because ungrounded systems will capacitively couple to the earth and everything conductive sitting on the earth.  If you don't have a ground in place, then you can see really erratic voltages when measured to that conductive equipment.  In the wrong conditions those voltages can be extremely high and will damage the insulation system.  I agree we use grounding to stabilize that."
electricians,38qiyy,PM-me-in-100-years,0,Sat Jun 6 16:43:53 2015 UTC,This is also why generally only one ground rod is allowed per structure. Difference in ground potential can generate hazardous currents as well as act as an antenna.
electricians,38qiyy,lookatthatsquirrel,3,Sun Jun 7 03:55:14 2015 UTC,"Most places require at least two ground rods, if not 3.  I think you are trying to say that they only allow one grounding electrode conductor and one source to ground."
electricians,38qiyy,One1ove719,5,Mon Jun 8 01:10:54 2015 UTC,"I am also fairly familiar with Art. 250 (at least i've always felt so, feel free to correct me if anything seems incorrect).   The explanation that helped me understand things fairly well, was that everything on the supply side of the main disconnect (or within your service disconnect, however you want to phrase it) is technically 'grounding', i.e. actually making an EARTH connection by use of an electrode and conductor respectively.  ....everything after that is technically 'bonding', creating a low-impedance fault path for current to facilitate the opening of an overcurrent protection device.   you will obviously make a new Earth connection each time you derive a new system (transformer), but the reasons for this remain the same as when it was done in/before your service disconnect.  I would really like to see the NEC reflect the differences a little more clearly within the next few cycles. 250 is the single longest article, and can also be the most confusing for those who dont understand the terminology."
electricians,38qiyy,JohnProof,3,Sat Jun 6 16:53:33 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree.  I think we do a huge disservice to people trying to understand this concept by clinging to the terms ""ungrounded"", ""grounded"", and ""grounding.""    Not only are those needlessly confusing but the primary function of an equipment-ground is to provide a good bond; bringing it to earth potential is secondary, so the name isn't even technically accurate.  I would love to see the industry lingo change to ""ungrounded"", ""earthed"", and ""bonded."""
electricians,38qiyy,CyFus,3,Sun Jun 7 15:11:25 2015 UTC,"so if current is induced inside the neutral wire being next to the hot wire, then the same must be true for the ground wire? but bonding takes that away from both? where does it go?  also what about the difference between wire that is wrapped around itself in a MC cable vs straight parallel wire in a romex?"
electricians,38qiyy,saltyjohnson,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:08:36 2015 UTC,"OP's post is very interesting. The note about current inducing voltage on ungrounded systems is new information to me, so I'll just remind you that grounding, takes that away from both, not bonding. The fact that the conductor is connected to earth stabilizes the voltage and makes it entirely predictable.  And there would be no real difference in the wires being twisted together except for the fact that they are now in contact for a slightly greater distance. The reason conductors in MC are twisted together is just to make them more round. This is different from twisting the wires together in a communication cable, for instance. You want to twist pairs of wires together to ensure every given conductor will induce voltage on its companion the most. You don't want to pick up stray fields from other pairs of wires. The effect is negligible in a non-communication 120V power circuit."
electricians,38qiyy,arahlf,3,Sun Jun 7 02:04:10 2015 UTC,"Since the ground-fault current path has inherently much higher resistance than the neutral wire, the amount of current flowing through the circuit jumps enormously during a ground-fault.   Doesn't the ground-fault current path have the same or similar (basically 0) resistance than the neutral wire?  I thought the use case for it was that if the component case or w/e becomes energized, the EGC provides a low-resistance (to hopefully avoid shock to anyone that might touch it) path back to the source, also causing effectively a dead short, causing the sudden increase/rush in current to trip the breaker.  Only recently started learning about electronics (mostly DC), so pardon my ignorance :)"

A single ground electrode cannot reach a perfect zero resistance. On the contrary the neutral wire has, by design, a very low resistance to earth. You can even calculate that - in case of a disconnected neutral wire - your earth electrode has to be lower than 2 Ohms in order to not have more 50 volts (the lethal threshold) on exposed appliance parts. This is actually the law in Europe (or Greece afaik)"
electricians,38qiyy,wanderingbilby,3,Sat Jun 6 16:25:17 2015 UTC,"A minor clarification on Myth 2: Electricity takes the path of least resistance but does not take a single path.  For example, if you have two available paths back to the source, current will take both paths but will 'favor' one path proportinately to the path's resistance.  Ohm's law says if you increase resistance you decrease current; if I have a piece of copper wire and a light bulb wired in parallell on a circuit, the light bulb will not illuminate because the amount of current passing through that portion of the circuit is very small.  Edit: I'm an idiot.  I probably shouldn't drink and reddit.  Ohm's law dictates current draw and overall current use but does not address current supply in a shared (parallel) circuit, which is what OP is talking about.  Sorry.  Granted, this doesn't really make you feel better when you become part of the circuit at 220vac >_<  edit: I forgot to mention, this is a great post and really helps to clear up a lot of things people are confused about regarding mains power.

electricians,38qiyy,Russz,3,Sat Jun 6 15:47:48 2015 UTC,"Wait why wouldn't the bulb illuminate normally? I was taught that the current draw is determined by the resistance of the path.

Because the 2 paths in the parallel circuit will have the same voltage."

On submarines, we ran most systems ungrounded (that way the system could take battle damage, become a grounded system, and still work).   I have one question. What if for instance, your clothes washer develops a slight short to the case. Doesn't having the case grounded prevent someone from getting a shock when they touch it?"

On submarines, we ran most systems ungrounded (that way the system could take battle damage, become a grounded system, and still work).    Submarines operate on ungrounded systems for the same reason ships, trains, etc. have ungrounded systems. You can't reliably ground a moving vehicle. Like I mentioned, the purpose of 'grounding' a system (connecting the 'neutral' wire to the grounding electrode) is to stabilize alternating current. It doesn't make the system inherently safer, just more predictable.   I have one question. What if for instance, your clothes washer develops a slight short to the case. Doesn't having the case grounded prevent someone from getting a shock when they touch it?   Having the case connected to the equipment grounding conductor (which does not need to be connected to ground) provides a ground-fault current path (again, has nothing to do with a connection to Earth, just a misleading term) back to the source or the electricity. When the 'hot' wire touches the case (a 'short', or ground-fault) of the dryer, the current on the circuit will immediately rise enormously, causing the breaker to trip. Tripping the breaker is what prevents someone from getting shocked. Theoretically, if some were touching the metal case at the dryer at the time that the ground-fault, they would experience a very brief shock. However, breakers are designed to open so fast that the amount of time the person is being shocked would probably be too short for them to feel it (we're talking about a few milliseconds)."
electricians,38qiyy,lasdlt,2,Sat Jun 6 00:54:07 2015 UTC,I never even considered this. How the hell would you ground something as large as a ship. I'm assuming the main distribution systems must be grounded in some way right?
electricians,38qiyy,DropkickPutty,3,Sat Jun 6 01:30:02 2015 UTC,"Many vehicles (at least land and air based and smaller sea based) are battery powered, meaning they run off a direct current system. Like I mentioned, the ONLY purpose of grounding a system (connecting the 'neutral' conductor to the ground rod buried in the Earth) is to stabilize the voltage on alternating current systems. I'm not familiar with how electrical systems in larger sea-base vehicles (like large ships and submarines which have diesel generators or nuclear reactors), but I'd imagine they are similar to the ungrounded systems which are sometimes installed in industrial facilities. An alternating current system does not NEED to be grounded, the voltage is just most stable.  As a side note, grounded alternating current systems are actually somewhat more dangerous (provide the potential for more harm to people) than ungrounded alternating current systems. At some point in the past the industry made the decision to go with a system with more stable voltage rather than a slightly safer system."

Both versions of you make a small mistake while working (surprise sneeze, insulation is worn out on tools, plumber thinks it is funny to tickle you, etc.) and provide a path through their body from the hot wire to the metal outlet box.  SelfA gets a shock because the box is electrically continuous with all the other boxes in the house, and ultimately has a path back to the source.  SelfB on the other hand, completes the path to the outlet box, but since the outlet box isn't electrically continuous with the rest of the boxes in the house and ultimately the source...

We had some large steam turbine generators to provide power, there were motor/generators that could be an AC motor and make DC to charge the battery or could be a DC motor and make AC. Then we had a huge battery.  I think for certain things, like galley equipment or 110 v for non- critical systems, we could ground to the ships hull. A huge chunk of steel in salt water made for a pretty good ground."
electricians,38qiyy,CyFus,2,Sat Jun 6 02:41:27 2015 UTC,"Without knowing more about the electrical systems of submarines specifically, I'd imagine 'grounding to the hull' (by which I assume you mean bonding an Equipment Grounding Conductor to the metallic, or conductive, hull of the sub) would be done in order to bond all normally non-current carrying conductive parts of the sub in order to ensure a ground-fault current path in the event of a ground-fault. This would be comparable to connecting a equipment bonding jumper to the steel members of a building or bonding the chassis of a car. The purpose would be to provide a path through which the current can return to the source in the event of a ground-fault to allow the breaker to trip."
electricians,38qiyy,admiralranga,2,Sat Jun 6 03:14:18 2015 UTC,"this is essentially correct in surface ships (cant speak for subs but i assume its the same). the current does not trip a breaker however. this would cause critical equipment to flip off in the event of battle damage. our ship simply had lights that would light up, indicating that there was, somewhere, a phase connected to ground. to find the ground and correct it, you killed panels and load centers until the light extinguished. multiple ground faults on different phases would create essentially bolted faults between phases, resulting in the affected devices' feeder breakers tripping normally. well at least one of them normally."
electricians,38qiyy,swen83,2,Sun Jun 7 02:35:44 2015 UTC,"There are some places on land that have somewhat similar (not tripping a breaker during a ground-fault, not how you trace it).

They generally have better tools and procedures to diagnose and fix ground-faults, though."

Assuming you have more than the GFCI and fridge receptacle. With the Circuit on test all the receptacles in your kitchen for power then trip the GFCI (little test button in the center). Recheck all the receptacles and note all that are now off. Press the Reset to turn the GFCI back on.  Turn off the breaker for the fridge circuit.  Pull the GFCI out of the wall.  you should see on green wire (leave attached) and 2 sets of black and white wire. also on the back of the GFCI you should see impressions in the plastic indicating LINE and LOAD.  optional belt and suspenders step.  Test continuity between the LOAD white wire and the longer slot of the fridge receptacle to make sure they are the same  Remove the black wire from LOAD and put it under the LINE terminal.  Remove the white wire from LOAD and put it under the LINE terminal.  Put GFCI back into the wall put cover plate on and turn on the circuit to the kitchen.  Trip the GFCI (test button) and check all receptacles that you noted to be off and test the fridge receptacle to make sure it is on.  If the other receptacles you noted were off are not now you will have to replace the next one (passed the fridge) with a GFCI and that is another set of steps that I will walk you through if that happens.

If you can, try a new GFI outlet and see if that fixes it. GFI outlets do occasionally go bad.  If you're saying that the outlet that is tripping is not the one that the fridge is plugged into, then try plugging the fridge directly into the outlet. If you need to, either move the fridge or use a 12 gauge extension cord temporarily. If this works, then the connections and wiring between the GFI outlet and the fridge outlet needs to be inspected.  If that doesn't work, then there may be an issue with your fridge.

I would only expect to see that in some kind of high-heat application. (The advantage of the really old houses is they were built before they started using most of the really bad stuff like asbestos!)  Most likely it's just cotton. Double cotton-covered wire was pretty typical in those days."

Would suck to work for one of the smaller outfits that just hand digs everything, then again it makes more sense to put up more EMT in those cases. A with a few hoe operators on our big jobs and a few others trenching with the bobcat attachment we can put tens of thousands of feet underground quickly. But if it came to hand digging, piping it overhead with EMT would win cost wise and we'd only hand dig the essential stuff like main service."

electricians,38otj4,eleitl,6,Fri Jun 5 16:45:44 2015 UTC,"The ground is never supposed to carry current- ie. if it does, a ground fault has happened and that's a bad thing.  A neutral does supposed to have current.   That's why you need to have two separate conductors.   So the question then is what happens in the case there is a ground fault.  That current has to go somewhere.  If you don't bond the ground to the neutral bar at the main panel, it goes to the ground rod which has around 25 ohms of resistance and not enough to even trip the breaker so if someone were to touch a metal body of the area of the house that had the ground fault, the current would go through them.  Note that the ground fault can also happen from a neutral wire (if the neutral and the ground is touching down stream) That's why the ground and neutral are bonded at only the main panel and you need a dedicated conductor for the ground.  I'm sure there are better technical answers, but that's my TLDR version."
electricians,38otj4,coogie,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:29:11 2015 UTC,Can you dumbify this?
electricians,38otj4,d03boy,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:57:26 2015 UTC,"Bare ""ground"" wire makes all metal things the same point in an electrical circuit to better detect problems and handle them.  White ""neutral"" wire is the return path for the electricity."
electricians,38otj4,kyriose,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:16:03 2015 UTC,So their potential is the same BUT it's bad if a short circuit travels down the wrong one because...?
electricians,38otj4,d03boy,2,Sat Jun 6 01:44:09 2015 UTC,"Ground and Neutral wires SHOULD have the same potential (i.e. if you put a volt meter on them it should read 0) however their purposes are completely different.  Nutral's job is to return curent to it's source  Ground's job is to provide a low impedance path back to the panel to allow an high rush of current in the event of a fault to activate the breaker or blow the fuse. If a fault has enough resistance to not trip the breaker or blow the fuse, it is just a load and will continue to have current fed through it."
electricians,38otj4,Basoran,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:11:20 2015 UTC,I like this explanation. Thanks!
electricians,38otj4,d03boy,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:27:15 2015 UTC,"The bare one isn't meant to carry current. It's just so that if something that is electrified touches a metal part that isn't supposed to be electrified the breaker trips. The white wire IS supposed to be electrified because it has the return current.   Since the bare wire is bare any electricity touching a metal non electrical part would cause everything that the bare wire touches to be live that's bad because then if you touched something metal you could get a shock. However when electrical parts touch the bare wire it lets the electricity bypass anything in the circuit that would give a load, create current through resistance, the current skyrockets to insane levels and trips the breaker. Normally around 10000 amps for less than a fraction of a second.  Edit: both wires are bad to have shorts from live to."
electricians,38otj4,kyriose,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:58:56 2015 UTC,lol here is a professional explaining it with pictures and stuff. https://www.mikeholt.com/mojonewsarchive/GB-HTML/HTML/OpenServiceNeutralCausesDangerousTouchVoltageonMetalParts~20030409.htm
electricians,38otj4,coogie,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:24:59 2015 UTC,"Minor correction.  Current doesn't go to ground rod, it goes back to it's source through all paths, but most of the current takes the path of least resistance. which in a fault situation you hope it is the ground wire and not the machine or person near it.  The Ground rod's only purpose is to create a common zero point for the system and stabilize voltage. and is not part of the over current protection system."
electricians,38otj4,Basoran,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:04:51 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean that it's supposed to go there. I meant that if we never bonded the grounding wires to the neutral bar, all that's left is the ground rod and due to the high resistance of the rod, the fault won't ever be cleared and shock potential is still there."
electricians,38otj4,coogie,4,Sat Jun 6 19:11:20 2015 UTC,"The best reason I've ever heard of, is safety for metal-cased appliances.  Basically, if you tie the neutral to the metal case, and then some idiot flips the hot and neutral (or they were already flipped because some idiot installed the wiring in the wall wrong), the entire case of the appliance is live 120 AC.  With a separate ""safety ground"" that is neither hot nor neutral, you can tie the case of the appliance to that ground. And if for some reason the hot wire (whatever color it is) should touch the case, it will be grounded out (and pop the breaker) immediately.  Admittedly, this made a lot more sense in the 50's and 60's when most things had metal cases. These days most things have plastic cases that can stand-off a couple thousand volts without even breathing hard. But it's still a very good safety on things that get hot. Like ovens, toasters, space heaters, etc. Those things are usually both metal cased (because plastic would melt) and a fire hazard. So having a safety ground is a very smart thing there."
electricians,38otj4,ModernRonin,4,Fri Jun 5 20:46:44 2015 UTC,"Current is always trying to return to the source, and one of the normal paths back to the source is through the neutral conductor.  If you have a fault that could energize the metal surfaces of equipment you want that fault to be quickly cleared by tripping a breaker.  The best way to do that is to create an intentional short-circuit back to the source.  We do this by connecting an equipment ground wire to all conductive surfaces, and hooking that to the neutral point.  Why not just use the neutral wire as the ground if it's already present at all devices?  Because the neutral has current flowing over it, and as such, has voltage drop across it.  In some conditions, this can be enough to cause a slightly unpleasant shock.  But more dangerous is that if the neutral were to become open and it were connected to metallic appliance frames, then suddenly all those frames would have line voltage on them creating a very severe shock hazard.  It used to be code legal to use the neutral as the equipment ground and this was common in stoves and dryers, however, that rule has since been changed and now we use the safer dedicated equipment ground."
electricians,38otj4,JohnProof,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:16:57 2015 UTC,Breakers trip faster hot to ground then they do hot to a current carrying conductors.   The nuetral is a current caring conductor by definition. If things go wrong we don't want a potential voltage on the case of an appliance.
electricians,38otj4,nizmob,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:03:27 2015 UTC,"Breakers trip faster hot to ground then they do hot to a current carrying conductors.   But if you have only one appliance on a circuit, both neutral and ground have literally the same path in a fault condition."

electricians,38quir,robstoon,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:06:25 2015 UTC,"The hard start kit is usually meant for units where the compressor is starting to wear out and it needs a bit more torque on startup to get running. It basically converts the stock resistive start winding into a capacitor start setup. I would expect it to reduce the overall length of the inrush current if it starts more quickly, but right when it kicks on you're still going to have the motor drawing the locked-rotor amperage so it might still have issues. Likely only way to find out is to try and see.  Another possible solution might be to use a big long extension cord that the fridge plugs into. The little bit of added resistance might quench the inrush a little bit. (Of course if it's too much the fridge will then have trouble starting.)"

electricians,38p6id,markymark_inc,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:55:39 2015 UTC,I reread your comments and the fact they are affected by a thunderstorm or  the dryer makes me think you have a bad ground connection somewhere.   Any appliances with a motor  leak a very small amount of current to ground. I'm thinking you have a open or very loose ground wire somewhere and your getting some voltage applied to the ground when there should be nothing. I would check all your ground connections on that circuit.
electricians,38p6id,WantAndAble,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:36:23 2015 UTC,"A better ground connection certainly can't hurt. But I suspect the root problem is high frequency noise feeding back from the dryer into the circuit. Some modern dimmers can be surprisingly susceptible to noisy power.  I was recently trying to trace a couple of circuits back to the breaker panel. The moment I plugged my signal generator (""fox"") into the outlet, the lights in the room would start dimming, turn off, and then a moment later turn back on. They'd continuously go through this cycle until I unplugged the signal generator.  The funny thing is that the lights were on a completely different circuit from the outlet. I suspect the wires happened to run in parallel in the wall, or the two circuits are relatively close together in the circuit panel."
electricians,38p6id,sonicjesus,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:00:00 2015 UTC,I just checked the panel. The breaker that controls the lights are two breakers away from the dryer.
electricians,38p6id,flinxsl,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:13:23 2015 UTC,"Do you have a three or four prong dryer plug?   If it's a three prong plug, your ground could be acting as the return path for all the 120V load from control and display circuitry. Likewise with your dimmer, if it does not have a neutral attachment, the return path for control circuitry is through the ground.  It's possible that somewhere along the line in your grounding system, the dimmer ground is receiving voltage from the dryer ground, and interpreting it as ""turn on.""  If you do have a four wire dryer plug, make sure the ground and neutral bonding strap behind the cord attachment plate has not been jumpered together.   If the dimmers have a neutral attachment available, make sure it has been attached to a true neutral, and not bootlegged on the ground."

You need Arc Fault Circuit Interpreters because they interrupt the circuit when there is an arc fault.  Arc faults can produce fire.  Fire is bad."
electricians,38nx9e,therealCapwn,0,Fri Jun 5 16:13:45 2015 UTC,"Not entirely true, I can play with an arc fault circuit and get a load to create an arc when I tap it against the hots. No trip..  Arc fault breakers (unlike regular breakers that only monitored the current flowing thru it, and tripped if it exceeded their rating ).. Arc faults monitor the current being used, And also the current returning thru the neutral. If they differ too much, you have a fault, and it will then trip.   TIL : You fellas have no idea how an AFI works.."
electricians,38nx9e,joekovar,4,Sat Jun 6 02:22:20 2015 UTC,"Supervise the circuit with a PAM-1 relay connected to the load side of the GFCI outlet. Then you get GFCI protection, and 10 AMP form C contacts to trigger alarms/emails/etc."
electricians,38nx9e,VVillyD,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:11:08 2015 UTC,"GFCIs are intended to protect people and equipment from ground-faults. They are typically required anywhere that something plugged in to the receptacle has the potential to get wet because wet energized electrical equipment has a high potential to cause a ground-fault. You mentioned you aren't getting this inspected, so you can do whatever you want, but there are 2 important things to keep in mind. 1) as /u/BobIV mentioned, these rules were put in place for a reason; by not installing them where the code requires, you are creating a potential hazard. 2) If you have plans to sell your house at any time down the road, home inspectors will often require you to install them everywhere the NEC requires them before you can sell. That said, I agree that it would be more important to ensure your sump pump runs in a flood, just keep in mind that you could be creating a hazard and that you could damage the pump if the receptacle were to get wet.  AFCIs are a recent invention (they first appeared in the 2008 NEC, iirc) and are intended to protect against arcing. When a receptacle is in place for a long time without anyone ever looking at it, small vibrations over time can loosen the screws on the terminals slightly. If the connection between the wire and the terminal is not tight, there is the potential for small arcing, which causes 'pitting' on the wire and terminal, which will, in turn, cause more arcing. If left long enough, this will be a huge fire hazard. AFCIs are intended to protect against exactly this problem. There is no big down side to installing them (other than the financial one)."

electricians,38nx9e,Jabberwocky918,2,Fri Jun 5 14:25:47 2015 UTC,"I would hope that if you breached a line to ground or line to line thru romex with a steel nail that a conventional breaker would trip, if you only breach one line to the nail an AFCI may not trip and keep you from getting shocked in that instance.  I don't think OP is asking whether or not he should hook every bit of power running thru his home direct to the mains, I think he's asking if its really worth it to update from knob and tube to full 2015 new construction code (IMHO, it isn't, though its a good idea to update from knob and tube to grounded circuits and GFCI's for wet locations)"

I don't think thats correct.  If only one wire is cut (assuming a line voltage wire here) the only parallel path the wire could take to ground would be thru the nail and thru the person holding it.  I don't see where there's an arc, unless there is a load on the wire and the nail managed to not only breach the insulation, but sever the wire completely in the process of hammering it in (causing a series arc)  I think I'm correct in stating that a GFCI would likely trip in that situation but an AFCI is not likely to."
electricians,38nx9e,greenbuggy,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:42:30 2015 UTC,"If the nail driving through the conductor causes an arc, whether a load is currently applied or will cause one when a load is applied, then the breaker is supposed to trip. GFCI measures the imbalance of current between the hot and neutral, and if there is a difference of more than 5 milliamps between them, it will trip. So, if you drive a nail through a conductor, but your body doesn't provide a path back to the panel, then the GFCI will not trip."
electricians,38nx9e,Jabberwocky918,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:54:15 2015 UTC,"So, if you drive a nail through a conductor, but your body doesn't provide a path back to the panel, then the GFCI will not trip.

Their 800% claim assumes this is a linear relationship. DC-DC converters introduce losses that will drain the battery faster than normal.

electricians,38jmir,ShittyFieldTech,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:28:48 2015 UTC,If for some reason you decide against using pipe you have to coil up the cable underground before it enters the meter.  That will help with the expansion and contraction due to temperature changes.  The electrician who changed out my panel last weekend explained this to me because he had to fix a meter that was pulled off the wall.  When the powerco came out they told him it happens all the time and to make sure he left a coil of cable underground.
electricians,38jmir,lookatthatsquirrel,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:24:40 2015 UTC,You would have to have the whole coil buried with 24'' of cover.

electricians,38h4j2,robstoon,2,Thu Jun 4 04:58:59 2015 UTC,"Is this a split outlet with one half switched and half not, or is it a multi-wire branch circuit perhaps? We can't see the far side of the old outlet in the picture, but if the tab between the top and bottom sides has been broken off on the side with the black and red wires, you will need to do the same on the new outlet on the ""Hot Wire"" side, otherwise the two hot wires will be shorted together.

electricians,38h4j2,robm0n3y,6,Thu Jun 4 05:15:30 2015 UTC,"The brass screws will have a tab between them, break that off and put the wires to the screws. This will either cause a wall switch to turn power on and off to one half of that outlet or have the outlet get power from two circuits."

electricians,38geoq,skippydudeah,2,Thu Jun 4 01:18:26 2015 UTC,"I think he was saying you were overloading the 6/3.  You aren't overloading the panel. #6 copper is good for 60 Amps, which really isn't enough.  When the compressor kicks on, it is going to draw A LOT of juice, which is why he suggested 2/0.  Depending on the voltage drop, you may even want to go bigger than that (or change to copper instead of aluminum)."

electricians,38geoq,lookatthatsquirrel,2,Thu Jun 4 08:52:56 2015 UTC,Assume American for everything unless they specify.  People still refer to our voltage here as 230 even though we have 240.

electricians,38h4c6,almost_a_troll,0,Sat Jun 6 05:57:13 2015 UTC,One more thought: Since 220 VAC is your normal operating voltage that is even more likely to be the cause than the 120 VAC range here in the US for residential use. The breakers are rated higher than 120 VAC usually 40-60 amps that can cause more than enough damage.

electricians,38h4c6,Jim-Jones,0,Fri Jun 5 02:04:46 2015 UTC,You obviously are not an electrician of any type. Higher voltage allows for more current. A 40 amp breaker on a 120 VAC service would cause the wiring/rated for lower current to burn under prolonged use. Try and learn the relationship between voltage and current.

(house build in 1978 or something)"
electricians,38gdol,Jim-Jones,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:43:17 2015 UTC,i would probably solder them and wrap them in electrical tape but not sure if that's permissible these days.   Nope. How would you get that U/L certified?

electricians,38frm6,redditmoose,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:07:55 2015 UTC,This is a very real possibility that wouldn't violate any code by itself until you notice it's an AFCI breaker on the right.
electricians,38frm6,lookatthatsquirrel,2,Wed Jun 3 23:49:56 2015 UTC,"Simple problem.  Neutral is crossed somewhere.  An old school way of wiring was to try and get a hot from one circuit and a neutral from another to minimize wiring.  Arc faults made that not work anymore.  You would never ever know if it wasn't an arc fault breaker.  May be a mistake, or it may be an oversight on the guy that wired it.  I wouldn't be too hard on someone for this, there are places that haven't started using arcfaults outside of a bedroom yet and those electricians haven't encountered their splendor yet, even though it has been 16 years since we started using them."
electricians,38frm6,kidcharm86,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:22:43 2015 UTC,"I can see a crossed neutral causing the arc fault to trip, but why would the standard breaker be tripping?  I'm guessing he has a line to line short somewhere.  Possibly on a dishwasher/disposal split receptacle?"

They develop permanent bends in them through normal usage.  The Ideal and Klein ones are great!  Takes time to learn how they track if you have to drill a decent span.

electricians,38fl8s,crownsdown,2,Wed Jun 3 21:57:43 2015 UTC,"You can bond the neutral and ground to make it work. The ground is actually redundant.  It doesn't meet code, but landing the ground and neutral on the same bar will work. Ideally you would want to pull a ground from the source and install a new ground bar. In this scenario that is not going to make things else where any better as you have a two wire system"
electricians,38fl8s,agoodonetomorrow,2,Wed Jun 3 22:12:01 2015 UTC,"What you have in there right now is two hots and a ground going to that outlet. The white wire is being used as the second hot wire (really should be tagged with black tape to identify it as such). A neutral is what you need to add to convert this to a 14-30 outlet. If it's only 10 inches, I'd just rip out whatever wire they had going in there and run some new 10-3 cable to it.  As far as the panel goes, is this a detached garage? There are two ways you can do this - either have separate neutral and ground coming from the main panel and have isolated neutral and ground bars in the subpanel, or have only a neutral from the main panel and bond neutral and ground in the subpanel. Sounds like what you have is closer to the second option."
electricians,38fl8s,robstoon,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:52:07 2015 UTC,I don't know if this helps... Here in Alberta it is sufficient enough to use a gfci breaker in place of having your feed grounded. Might be worth it to look into it considering you might not even have a ground rod or plate. I don't see any ground wire in that panel. If that's the case it's a lot less time consuming to just put a new breaker in.  Edit: spelling

electricians,38a4ux,Russz,2,Wed Jun 3 04:48:03 2015 UTC,"The ""head"" is how you tie your wire to whatever your pulling it in with (rope, pull string, mule tape,  etc.). I've seen many different ways to do it,  depending on whatever you're pulling. We usually use the socks and some tape, with a zipper made from tie wire for easy tape removal.    When we pull smaller stuff we just stagger the wires, half hitch a few times,  and tape.  Or make a loop at the end of the ground and tape the rest behind the loop, and tie the string to the loop and pull(Typically for short pulls)"
electricians,38a4ux,super_cool,2,Wed Jun 3 03:31:30 2015 UTC,"A head is when you strip back the conductors , take some of the strands from each wire, and loop them in alternate directions. It is the way you do it without a grip."

Then let them do the next, and then you fix it after they fuck it up. Then they make the next and they can fix it after you tell them it can be better then if they don't got it by then they might be a lost cause.

electricians,389wg9,DrunkHippos,2,Tue Jun 2 21:01:54 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen this exact method but I did show up for a panel replacement to a guy who had clamps sort of like these feeding his 100 amp panel. http://wapp.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Connectors.jpg ""I ran out of room so I had to hook this bitch up myself.

electricians,389wg9,HighLegDelta,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:01:26 2015 UTC,I feel like this was made to be a main breaker panel but someone (who didn't know any better) added this crazy lug device that plugs on the bus bar.
electricians,389wg9,North0House,2,Tue Jun 2 22:16:58 2015 UTC,"They are subfeed lug blocks. Useful if you have a sub panel off of a panel right next to it.

The hot(on the left of the pic) is vertical and the neutral(on the right of the pic) is horizontal.  It would fit this CR-20R.  That is a 120 volt end.  OP, you really need to make sure you know what you have first before you go rewiring anything."
electricians,389vd5,lookatthatsquirrel,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:06:52 2015 UTC,It is prewired 220v by the manufacture and it is an 6-20 which is a 20amp 220v plug used for power tools. I've done lots of research on this plug and my wall outlet and I believe I will go to the hardware store tomorrow and grab a 220v 20amp extension cord with the proper male-female ends.  Thanks everyone for their opinions!

electricians,389vd5,Encryptid,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:16:50 2015 UTC,"You can definitely build your own cord. I would recommend going a little over kill and using a 10AWG cord of the SO type. Make sure you change the circuit breaker to a double pole 20A as your saw requires.  Build your extension cord just as you described. Match the dryer outlet on one end, and the saw plug on the other. You would be better off wiring a whole new cord to the saw however."
electricians,389vd5,Encryptid,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:07:28 2015 UTC,"So I just went and looked again at the plug on the wall. It is a L6-20R which tells me it is already set up for 20amp. The breaker out back has a double pole 30amp breaker on it and I believe the home-owner has this circuit powering a couple 110v plugs and some lighting in the garage as well.   Are you saying I should replace the power cord with a longer one and with the L6-20 end instead of making my own cord? I'm looking for the least expensive, but safest way of doing this that doesn't require me making changes to the house."
electricians,389vd5,sonicjesus,3,Tue Jun 2 21:31:22 2015 UTC,"I'm a little concerned what kind of wiring is going on that they have a double pole 30A breaker feeding a 240V-20A outlet AND some 120V lighting.   Yes, you could just hard wire a longer 10 gauge cord to the saw with an L6-20P plug on the end and that would be preferable to making an extension cord.   Definitely needs to be fused at 20A though, back at the breaker."
electricians,389vd5,HighLegDelta,3,Tue Jun 2 22:20:09 2015 UTC,I'd love to know what the 110 outlets are using for a neutral.
electricians,389vd5,sonicjesus,2,Tue Jun 2 22:37:08 2015 UTC,Maybe they are using a neutral for a neutral. It's not hard to run a three wire to feed both 120v and 240v equipment.
electricians,389vd5,Encryptid,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:12:57 2015 UTC,"Well, the socket doesn't have a neutral (unless I'm missing something) so I'm guessing the feed does not as well. They may have done the less insane thing, steal a neutral from another circuit which wildly out of code, is considerable less lethal."
electricians,389vd5,robstoon,0,Wed Jun 3 02:15:12 2015 UTC,"My fear exactly. This is turning into a ""better call an electrician"" issue."
electricians,389vd5,lookatthatsquirrel,2,Tue Jun 2 22:41:20 2015 UTC,"I believe the home-owner has this circuit powering a couple 110v plugs and some lighting in the garage as well.    Not good. You can't have regular plugs and lighting on a 30A breaker, that's dangerous and against code. That stuff should be moved onto another circuit and the 220V outlet should have its own 20A breaker."
electricians,389vd5,sonicjesus,3,Wed Jun 3 03:27:37 2015 UTC,Why would you get downvoted for this?  It is true and the NEC does specifically not allow 30 amp circuits to power general use receptacles and lighting.  Too much of a curve for overcurrent on a circuit with 4 32watt T8 lamps on a switch.  210.23 covers it.

Is there a reason behind it? I would have thought it'd be better to buy spools which travel easier and can be mounted with a piece of pipe across wall studs with just a few nails.
electricians,388mso,ElectricBaboon,2,Tue Jun 2 19:37:42 2015 UTC,I use rolls on spinners instead of spools so that multiple people can run the same gauge wire without having to over buy on tight bid residential jobs. And spools are heavy.
electricians,388mso,6matguy6,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:13:36 2015 UTC,Ah yes it would be easier to throw a roll or 2 over your shoulder instead of spools wouldn't it. Thanks for the answer.
electricians,388mso,Radar_Monkey,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:18:47 2015 UTC,"Dude, you save like 5-8% when buying 1000' spools. There's less waste too. They also rarely bind up or tangle, so even if cost wasn't an issue I'd still prefer them. Even if it's just for feeds, since that's where they really shine."
electricians,388mso,persianrug,2,Wed Jun 3 04:53:51 2015 UTC,"I am on a job with 1000' spools. They're big, heavy, and not that much cheaper. Sucks when you have to get the spool of 12/3 from the container on the opposite end of the site. I hang them with pipe scraps across joist bays and don't move them until the end of the day.   Every other residential job I've been on uses 250' rolls on spinners. They're easier to bring to your work, and you can cover a whole wall with spinners when pulling home runs knocking half a dozen out at a time. If it were up to me, I'd go with 250' rolls except for the odd long ass run to the opposite corner of the building."

You simply have to incorporate yourself, get liability insurance for half a million, and register with the attorney general, all of which will run you about $2K. If you don't want to do the traditional work, being a house inspector is great money, and knowing electric is a huge part of it (as is plumbing, but that is far less code dependent). As for being in an office environment, I'm not sure what you could do without field specific college. I don't know what education you would need to be an electrical engineer, but knowing electrical code and learning Autocad (surprisingly easy if you're good with computers) would probably get your foot in the door.

I've only used the term backfeed when it applies to generators feeding back upstream, which is a bad thing generally.  There is a breaker upstream of this subpanel on the main panel. So a main breaker is redundant and not required, but not wrong either. And yes, I understand having extra circuits doesn't mean it can support extra load. In my case, the extra space just means I can use full size breakers instead of tandem, and allow for more dedicated circuits for certain fixed appliances that weren't on dedicated circuits previously.  The reason I ask this is because a friend is offering these panels at a deep discount. They're unused from one of his previous jobs. So I'd like to make one of these work.  The main breaker on this subpanel would be rated higher than the breaker feeding it at the main panel. I did not know about the placard requirement. What does that look like?"
electricians,389aep,agoodonetomorrow,2,Tue Jun 2 19:56:08 2015 UTC,The main breaker is redundant.  In my state the amended code requires a main in residential applications. If within the same structure it is not required but I always install one because I like the idea of being able to shut down a sub panel at the sub panel.  The placard thing is new.  I wasn't aware of the rule until it came about on a correction report. Its as simple as using a label maker and noting the amperage feeding the panel.  If you have a 200amp main but only feeding it with #4 I will put something like. Panel Ampacity 80amps.  From the inspector this is another one of those rules that protect the stupid from being stupid? I don't know.

electricians,38883l,blackjesus75,-1,Tue Jun 2 19:07:01 2015 UTC,You would need two circuits because you have to have a neutral landed on the GFI. Without a neutral landed you won't have a circuit and a GFI works off of unbalanced loads on the hot and neut anyways. You could run the switch off the load side of the GFI but that would be dumb because if the GFI trips then your light doesn't work. I'd pull a hot and a neutral to each.
electricians,38883l,ibew_sparky,2,Tue Jun 2 22:43:33 2015 UTC,You might have a problem with the gfci receptacle tripping with turning the switch in and off.

The thing about being made in China is nearly irrelevant. The guy who commented about them being made in China did so from a phone or computer...what are the odds of it being made in America. The car or truck they drive, even if it's an American make, has components from China. So, to be concerned that the tools we use are made in China or anywhere else is almost a moot point."

electricians,383tx3,Jim-Jones,2,Mon Jun 1 21:10:19 2015 UTC,"In the US you would use a monster GFCI main for a service that size. A fatty adjustable GFCI (tens of thousands of dollars) that I'm willing to be none of the commenters in the original thread were talking about.  NEC 230.95 Ground-fault protection of equipment shall be provided for solidly grounded wye electric services of more than 150 volts to ground but no exceeding 600 volts phase-to-phase for each service disconnect rated 1000 amperes or more.   However, it should be slower to trip than the branch circuit breaker a few sub panels away."
electricians,383tx3,coogie,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:45:28 2015 UTC,They do use gfi mains on large services. It doesn't trip as low as a gfci receptacle though. It usually takes a ground fault with over 100a or so to trip. It's to reduce arc flash and not to prevent electrocution. A 20a ground fault can easily trip on but usually only on a 277v circuit.

electricians,383tx3,Waldopemersonjones,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:53:13 2015 UTC,"The reward is called unemployment.  They trip in the hundreds of amps range for ground faults. Basically, when you have a large 480v and larger service, there is a ton of available fault current. If you can trip the main quickly in a ground fault then you significantly reduce the arc flash hazard. It doesn't protect from electrocution. It basically looks like any other large frame breaker."

But the other problem is that in some cases this can cause both the line and neutral line voltages to get ""lifted up"" by the surge current, creating a voltage difference with respect to ground that can blow things up too. Having the line-to-ground and neutral-to-ground protection helps prevent that."

electricians,3866c4,Jim-Jones,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:45:49 2015 UTC,Here is a technique that you can use to identify wires without a partner
electricians,384nx2,mhkesler84,2,Mon Jun 1 20:48:46 2015 UTC,"You can change the dryer cord to a 3 wire cord. In the back of the dryer where the cord connects, you will need a jumper between where your white (neutral) and green (ground) are with your current cord.   There may still be a sticker back there that shows a typical 3 wire or 4 wire configuration.  Edit: found this... http://www.appliance-repair-it.com/images/cordwiring2.jpg"
electricians,384nx2,Encryptid,2,Mon Jun 1 20:57:46 2015 UTC,It's been code for as long as I know to wire the dryer with an insulated neutral.  I have never seen a dryer wired in SEU before.  Only ranges normally have the issue of 4-wire and 3-wire.  They could change the outlet in the wall most likely.  Not his problem. OP needs to tell the buyer to fix what they have.  Better to bring theirs up to code than to take the dryer backwards.    Is it unsafe?  No.    Is it illegal to change the cord?  No  Just think the easiest thing to do would be to change the receptacle instead of trying to bond the dryer again. Most guys throw the strap away.
electricians,384nx2,lookatthatsquirrel,2,Mon Jun 1 21:11:26 2015 UTC,"I agree, downgrading the dryer seems like a detriment. It would be much more beneficial to update the outlet and the wiring to a modern 4 wire system.   My suggestion is a potential shock hazard though isn't it? Modern dryers need a neutral for return current coming from circuit boards and electronics. You are essentially sending current back on a bare ground wire, which is bonded to the housing of the dryer. You could be barefoot on a concrete basement floor that is wet and become a better path to ground for that neutral current. Am I right in my thinking of this?"
electricians,384nx2,Encryptid,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:43:45 2015 UTC,No.  The code has always been an insulated grounded conductor or part of an SE cable.  It will always be the neutral.
electricians,384nx2,lookatthatsquirrel,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:34:31 2015 UTC,"Swapping the cord is without a doubt the easiest solution.  Would it be nice to have a 4 wire connection for the dryer?  Yes, but pulling new wire, rewiring at the panel, and installing a new receptacle is without question more work and more expensive than changing the cord.  A 3 wire connection is still allowable and safe."
electricians,384nx2,love-broker,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:30:02 2015 UTC,"My point is, I have never seen a dryer wired in SEU.  Dryers have always been wired with 10/3 because of the insulated neutral or SEU requirement.  There is a 99% chance that switching the receptacle can be done.  No need to pull new wire.  Every electric dryer outlet I have seen during my whole career has always been wired with 10/3 cable.  Most electricians don't know that.  No need to pull new cable, just make sure the ground is hooked up in the panel and change the receptacle."
electricians,384nx2,lookatthatsquirrel,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:37:16 2015 UTC,"I have never seen a 4 wire connection pulled to a 3 prong receptacle before.  I've seen plenty of 3 wire without a ground.  EDIT.  Also, 3 wire connected dryers have no neutral and there is no rule regarding the bare ground connection, which is what is going on.  The code has an exception for allowing the neutral of a newer dryer to be connected to the ground conductor as specified on the appliance."
electricians,384nx2,love-broker,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:47:52 2015 UTC,That is a new exception as of 87. The requirement has always been to run a 4-wire feeder if running Romex or UF to the outlet because of the insulated neutral.  It has always been a requirement to have the insulated neutral and they allowed the bonding.  The newer(as of 87) code was to isolate the neutral and ground.  They have always needed the insulated neutral.  250.140 just tells you about hooking up the ground and allowing bonding via the insulated grounded conductor.
electricians,384nx2,lookatthatsquirrel,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:12:00 2015 UTC,"That exception speaks specifically to the use of SE cable, which is what I see in older 3 wire connections around here.  I rarely see insulated neutrals on 3 wire dryer recepts.  When I do, it's that bastard cable with no ground."
electricians,384nx2,love-broker,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:24:38 2015 UTC,That's why I said Romex.  Any dryer wired with Romex has always been 4-wire.
electricians,384nx2,lookatthatsquirrel,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:48:08 2015 UTC,"Well he will only know by taking the receptacle apart.  Again, I have maybe seen 1 installation of 4 wire landed to a 3 prong receptacle.  The romex I've seen has a black jacket, with black-red-white NO GND.  I've stripped it back plenty of times and it hasn't been cut off.  It has a lot of paper in it, or the jacket is cloth.  Clearly things differ from locale to locale."
electricians,384nx2,love-broker,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:59:00 2015 UTC,"Again, I have never seen a dryer not wired with 10/3 NM in a house."

electricians,384shu,hadrosaur,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:04:55 2015 UTC,"OK... Then attach the two grounding conductors to it, right?  I'm assuming I'll need to run a conductor of equivalent size then to the primary ground bar?"

electricians,384shu,Milafin,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:55:02 2015 UTC,"Buy 2 of these, Square D LK70AN.  They will turn the lugs 90 degrees and keep them outside of the space of the breaker.  No tapping or bolting of ground lugs to the cabinet.  They normally stock these at supply houses."

electricians,384dg5,tonguepunchbums,2,Tue Jun 2 05:55:05 2015 UTC,One thing I noticed in you picture's was a vast amount of corrosion. I don't know where you live but you may want to look into it. Also I don't know the age of your home but in some home's built in the last 10 years or so there was some drywall imported from China that was made from inferior materials. The drywall was gasing and causing all metals in the homes to corrode and also creating health hazards for the occupants.
electricians,384dg5,twojs1b,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:14:18 2015 UTC,"This.  Either that, or there's an awful lot of moisture/humidity inside the wall.  Whatever condition caused all the corrosion needs to be corrected, or it will just happen again."

You can have pull boxes in the middle of a run or a junction on the side of a building and to save money, switch from copper to aluminum. As long as the wires are the same length, material, size, insulation type and terminated the same way, you can change wires in the middle of a run.   You can mount a U-block, or use split bolts or polaris caps in a junction box and change conductors.  Nothing illegal about changing as long as you use the lesser ampacity of the wires you are working with.    It isn't normal, but it is legal."

electricians,383mi1,JohnKinbote,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:09:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Also, once the ground wire of the mc is bonded to a metal box, does the receptacle/switch need a separate ground wire to the ground screw? Or does the box become a ground for the receptacle or switch?  And lastly. Every other metal clad wire in the warehouse is bx, so there isn't a separate ground bar in the panel. Should I run the ground wire to the neutral bar like I've see in other panels?"
electricians,383mi1,robstoon,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:19:08 2015 UTC,"It depends on several factors.  How are you mounting the device to the box? Mud ring, raised cover or is it a handy box?  Is it a self-grounding receptacle?  It's probably safest to just use a ground tail to ground the receptacle.  Unless this is the panel with the service disconnect and bonding jumper (unlikely) DO NOT ground to the neutral bar.  Install a ground bar or a suitable lug that will give you a proper ground."

Also, you never switch leg with a white when ever possible. I am also asuming the buss bar on the switch is grounding for the switch and the bar on the box is for the box.

electricians,380lq4,2dumb2knowbetter,2,Mon Jun 1 01:14:45 2015 UTC,"just to clarify the line side should come in on top in this picture, as it shows in the diagram on the side. that way the center of the fuse holder is the only energized part when the switch is in the off position, otherwise if you fed the line side into the bottom terminal, the screw shell of the fuse holder would be energized and a larger potential for accidental shock."
electricians,380lq4,EmperorOfHemp,2,Mon Jun 1 00:48:38 2015 UTC,"Close. When the switch is in the off position, the blades feeding the center pin are completely disconnected from the contacts on the line side, therefore the whole fuse holder itself is isolated from the supply."

If you shut off the breaker (in your house panel) that powers the shop, then that means you cut power to the shop which is the whole point here right?  Beyond that you just want to install this disconnect in the shop so you can cut power there without needing to run inside the house I'm guessing.

electricians,3805q3,lukesdp,1 point,Sun May 31 21:47:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed.

We use Pass and Seymour, others use Leviton or Lutron or no-name knockoffs here.   Since 3-ways can be oriented upside down/right side up/which ever way you want to, how do you know the top or bottom?   This is actually untrue.  If you look at the metal tab with the ears, one of the two will be faintly labelled 'top'.  The common will always be on the bottom right side when facing the finished switch for 1-pole and 3-way.  This is true of literally every brand I've encountered.  As good practice, we also always put the red wire on the left (facing the finished switch) for consistency.  For powered legs, I always try to make it so that at the load the hot is black, so the confusion doesn't spread past the switch.  You can put a switch in upside down if you want it to be so that one side is up and the other side is down while the switch is off.  I've had an OCD person ask for it once.  In general though, yes, you want the black screws to be power-in, brass after that, and neutral on silver screws.  So for a 4-way, you put your in-3-wire onto the blacks and your out-3-wire onto the brass."

You use them to identify wires over a distance. One person clips his leads to ground and a target conductor. The other guy clips one lead to ground and searches conductors until he finds the target wire. At which point you can communicate about which wire you have found  and where to go next.

electricians,37xy37,BrooklynStig,2,Sun May 31 09:29:44 2015 UTC,"So what I'm gathering here is that you have a gas furnace with A/C and it sounds like the furnace (air handler) is somehow being powered off of a 20A circuit (which you've replaced the breaker for) and it also sounds like they fed the furnace off the load side of a GFCI outlet.   Did the entire HVAC system work before the Nest thermostat was installed? I'm not trying to blame you, but we need to know if it was already broken in some way before you got started.  Usually, by code, if they're is a piece of equipment in an attic, basement, or some kind of dedicated equipment area, there is required to be a GFCI protected outlet and a light for the service technician.  If the furnace loses power when the GFCI is tripped, that's a problem. It should be wired to the line side to bypass protection.  All that being said, I feel like you may need a technician, probably an electrician first. Give us a little more info though and we'll try to help.  Edit: on a side note, did the breaker box look in good condition? At 10 years old, there should be no issue with dying breakers unless you're seeing corrosion and oxidation from moisture entering the panel or loose connections overheating. Look for rust or white powder from aluminum oxidation on the main breaker lugs or bus bar (where the breakers snap in). Give us pictures!!"

electricians,37xy37,ShoulderChip,1 point,Sun May 31 13:15:41 2015 UTC,"I think the problems with your breakers caused other problems with your air conditioner.  Either the control board inside the furnace has gone bad, or the actual compressor in the air conditioner.  Find someone with HVAC experience to check it out.  Like \u\Encryptid said, it's rare to have problems with circuit breakers.  Was there a lightning storm or anything that could have caused that?"
electricians,37xy37,Flippin1999,1 point,Sun May 31 12:55:52 2015 UTC,"IMO the electric here is really weird, we have had at least 2-3 GFI outlets break in the kitchen and bathroom randomly. No lightning storm or anything I can think of to have caused this."
electricians,37xy37,classicsat,2,Sun May 31 13:15:07 2015 UTC,"You might want to have an electrician and/or the power company check the service and see if there is anything obviously wrong with it.  There could be a loose wire, but normally you would notice the lights dimming/brightening or flickering.  If you have LED bulbs those problems could be harder to notice than they would be with incandescent bulbs.  If they can't find anything obviously wrong, and you still think there might be problems with power quality, there is a device called a volt recorder, which may be available from your power company.  It plugs in and stays in place for a couple of weeks, recording any unusual changes in the voltage.  Then the data can be uploaded to a computer for analysis.  When I worked for the electric utility I worked with these all the time and helped find out what was causing the problems (if any problems were found).  Everything looks good in the photos, aside from the obvious wrong voltage on the breaker you replaced.  Most of those breakers are GE, so if that is a GE panel they're in, that's good.  The Siemens and Eaton breakers near the top left probably aren't listed to be in a GE panel, but if they aren't giving any problems, it's probably OK to leave them alone."

electricians,37ukt5,SDgoon,2,Sun May 31 01:03:59 2015 UTC,"Yup, probably was put in in the 70s, when, near as we can tell, the house was basically torn down and rebuilt.  Now I'm running a squareD QO panel with a properly rated feeder cable."
electricians,37w5rp,somechineseguy,5,Sat May 30 22:14:43 2015 UTC,"First you have to determine what it is feeding.  It looks like something was added to the upstairs.  If you determine that it is not an issue to add a gfci to it, you put a gfci on it and a weatherproof cover.  I would pigtail out the conductors so the device wasn't acting as a pass through.  Verify that it is 120 volts, and not feeding a heater or a/c unit."
electricians,37w5rp,kingshizz,4,Sat May 30 22:28:24 2015 UTC,Looks like a pull box. You need to find out what it feeds.
electricians,37w5rp,Jim-Jones,1 point,Sun May 31 00:47:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed, try to determine what it's feeding first.   Might be a problem fitting a GFCI outlet in there since it's already full of wire. Would be more labor, but you would thank yourself later if you swapped that box to a deeper version with the same 1/2"" knock outs. They are a regular stock item at Home Depot or Lowe's.  Definitely pigtail the connection and have separate wires feeding the outlet as ""kingshizz"" suggested."
electricians,37w5rp,Encryptid,1 point,Sun May 31 10:34:28 2015 UTC,"The reason why you would want to determine what it feeds first, is you don't want to overload the circuit.  So you have to check how much load is already on the circuit before you go adding another receptacle."
electricians,37w3fp,Pinoak212,3,Sat May 30 21:57:04 2015 UTC,Check for high resistance. A wire could be broken but touching at a terminal. If the wires are poked through those little holes on the back of the receptacle release them and wrap them on the screw.  The meter will read voltage even if there is high resistance in series with the meter.  Edit: neter to meter
electricians,37w3fp,ttarragon_man,1 point,Sat May 30 23:56:31 2015 UTC,"Does shaking the outlet help? I'm guessing you have a loose wire in one of the outlets. Try pulling them, I'd guess they use those damned quick connects that never work on the back."
electricians,37w3fp,sonicjesus,1 point,Sun May 31 03:56:46 2015 UTC,"Replace the outlet, a standard 15amp receptacle is <$1. Easy place to start. If that fixes your problem, wonderful, if not, continue to troubleshoot from there."

Then turn off breakers until the lamp turns off. If you don't have line of sight to the lamp from your panel, a loud radio makes a good substitute.   To see how much you're using on a circuit, you can use something like a kill-o-watt and get a value for every device on the circuit and add them up, or get a clamp ammeter and clamp it over the hot wire for that circuit at the panel which will tell you the total load on it."

There are faster, more dangerous ways, but I'd avoid them."

electricians,37ska8,sonicjesus,1 point,Sun May 31 16:25:38 2015 UTC,I don't quite understand your situation. Why can't you wire the new dimmer the same way the old one was sired?
electricians,37ska8,sonicjesus,1 point,Sun May 31 16:31:02 2015 UTC,The dimmer isn't the issue.  Because the other switch that can control this light was wired in such a manner that if it is switched off the dimming switch does not work at all.  I'd like to get them wired in a manner that makes them both 3 pole switches so they work right.

electricians,37s0zt,JohnKinbote,3,Sat May 30 20:06:47 2015 UTC,That's for running three phase machines when you only have single phase at a building. Although just buying a new building might be cheaper than sourcing it through Grainger.
electricians,37sewe,mtthmmnd,6,Sat May 30 00:35:06 2015 UTC,The kind of generators you are talking about no. Its possible if they have something to sync them like a piece of gear meant for it... but other than that no. You'll buck phases and blow them both up.
electricians,37sewe,duckquil,1 point,Sat May 30 01:20:44 2015 UTC,thats what I was curious about. Sending power from 2 generators to one main breaker would basically be like running them together and out of phase right?
electricians,37sewe,duckquil,4,Sat May 30 01:25:40 2015 UTC,"As generators start they take some time to reach the 60hz required for US power. Two generators running single phase 120/240 means the two legs on the single phase are 180deg out of phase with each other. IF you have two generators that are perfectly in sync with each other and the inductors are making +120v/ 0v/ -120v at the same point and time, then yes you can hook up both generators in parallel and double your power. If not, the coils do have a chance to take some time to buck and slow each other back and forth, lets say if they are maybe 20deg out of phase, and then eventually find sync with each other. The chances of that happening on a Honda pull start generator (or similar) is low. You couldnt safely combined both currents and then make it into useful power. 3 Phase generators have a piece of gear between them that checks the voltage difference between the coils and then adds them to each other is the way to properly achieve this. It allows the armature to reach the correct speed, and is only 120deg out of phase so adjusting and combining power is an easier task. Is your goal impossible on the cheap? Not entirely but its not a good safe idea. If you had a dedicated generator coil and could adjust everything about it maybe it would work...? If both generators ran off of one drive shaft then yes its definitely possible because you have constant speed. Selling two good generators to buy a long feeder or a bigger generator sounds like the better idea."
electricians,37sewe,IrishDemon,3,Sat May 30 03:30:00 2015 UTC,"It's possible, but not practical. You're better off selling the 2 generators and buying one that is the right size."

electricians,37slxh,Jordonis,2,Sat May 30 01:35:00 2015 UTC,"House that old you definitely have a neutral connection somewhere that has come apart, so power is flowing out to devices but no return path to the panel.  Grounding the Neutral wire turns thing back on because the current now has somewhere to go, but doesn't trip the breaker as it is not a direct short to ground, the power is still flowing through resistive devices restricting current flow, also a good chance in house that age the breakers do not function quite right.  Best way to fix it? Find the circuit that supplies power to that outlet, turn it off, open up everything on that circuit at check every connection until you find the offender.  My first guess would be in a light outlet based on age of the home but depends how the electricians ran the wire at build.  As to how/why it happened, the electrical connections in your house will slowly succumb to the abuse of power flowing through them, picking on the weakest connection in the circuit so even though you haven't moved or changed anything any connection could theoretically let go at any point.  Hope that helps :)"

From my perusal of the internet it seems the reason this is frowned on is because you now have a 50 amp receptacle with a 20 amp breaker and not because using a neutral for ground is dangerous?  But I have also read that changing the breaker is unnecessary because the breaker is designed to protect the wires/house not the device plugged in to it.

electricians,37mk56,njott,3,Thu May 28 19:25:13 2015 UTC,"In trade school my first year I bought the stupid expensive texts books from their bookstore. The second year I got new and used ones on amazon and saved hundreds.  I also didn't buy every Klein tool on their tool list, instead bought cheap box store tools, because I figured I could buy the nice ones after I graduated and got a job. (I still use some of the cheap tools years later because they haven't broken, and they work just fine)  Ask for discounts when buying tools for being a student, one place told me no. Home depot gave me a 70% discount on some tools I purchased (I got lucky with the manager being really nice, but it happens)  I'll second OP on not eating out, that shit adds up.  I would say don't use credit cards but that's just my opinion, I got one after highschool, and it took me 2 years to build up a balance, and 5 to pay it off, I closed the account, cut it up, and always use my debit card.  When you get a job (for Americans) get health insurance, it's always nice to have a job that offers it.  open a H.S.A. account, everything you put in is tax deductible from your wages. Doing this paid my $3700 insurance deductible for my surgery ( I had carpal tunnel) and it got aggravated my first year on the job where I needed surgery."

It's right there in black and white in the local's Agreement that they don't have to pay us for school hours.    We take school 7:00-3:30 one day every two weeks year-round so basically we get paid 9 days out of 10.  It can make taking w/end overtime tempting to make up the loss (o/t rate is given if you went to school during the week even if you're <40hrs) but I've found it's really easy to fall behind on the homework if you do that too much...  I heard (semi-reliable-ish source) that some contractors pay some apprentices some amount for the time they're in school as a good will gesture but I've never encountered that myself.

Another tip that I highly recommend is that you teach yourself another skill, or spend your free time starting up a business. I am a second year apprentice who works 40 hours a week. I go to school two nights a week as well, and yet i have done extremely well for myself financially. Because i live at home with my parents and i am still very young with a very entrepreneurial mindset, i was able to master the art of trading in the stock market. There are days that i profit more then a journeymans salary for a week in just one day. Granted, being a trader in the stock market means there is alot of risk involved and i do have my days where i lose money. But ive gotten so good at tradign that i win much more then i lose, which is how i have built my trading account to several thousands of dollars. And if i continue to do well for myself i may end up leaving the field once i become an A journeyman. Also, being an apprentice and working in new york city. I have to commute via subway with very crowded and smelly homeless people everywhere. I absolutely hate taking the train. But i like to always capitalize on things that i don't like doing. So what did i do? I printed out a ton of flyers sharing my promo code for UBER and started posting them up all over the trains on my way to work, school and back home. I am constantly receiving free rides because of my flyers. So now i get driven to work, school, and home in a black SUV every now and then lol. One thing i want to point out is the fact that you said to be careful with credit cards, i can not stress how important this is. I absolutely love being financially educated and learning how to make money multiply. And one thing i have learned is that the borrower is the slave to the lender. I see too many apprentices at work needing to work countless hours of overtime because they have to make there payments on their BMWs. If you cant buy it cash, then you can not afford it. I only use credit for investments, because i like using other peoples money to make money. I only buy assets on credit. at 20 years old i have a perfect credit score, access to a nice sized credit limit and built myself a pretty large account all by using my noggin. I see way to many electricians in debt. and forced to go to work every single day because like i said, the borrower becomes to slave to the lender."
electricians,37mk56,MacBookPros,2,Thu May 28 23:27:51 2015 UTC,Wow well said my friend very well said.  I have a blog and would love to have you write some stuff on there sometime.
electricians,37mk56,ttarragon_man,0,Fri May 29 02:38:08 2015 UTC,"In time, you will learn the true consequences of risk, especially being out on margin like you are. You do realize that it has been 6  years since the last meaningful low, don't you?"
electricians,37mk56,MacBookPros,0,Fri May 29 22:03:08 2015 UTC,"The true consequences of risk? I do not gamble, I am an investor. I buy when I see something undervalued and sell if I feel it is over valued. Yes there is some risk involved. But I have never met a rich person in my life who has never lost money... Yet I know a lot of poor people who have never lost a dime. Why? They don't take risks. Any investment you make, whether buying real estate, a stock, a bond, or investing in a business will come with the chance of losing money. That's what's separates successful people from average. It's how you handle losses. Most people give up after a loss or two. But it's only those who keep pushing further no matter what happens to them in life who make it to the top. Bill gates, Donald trump, Steve jobs, Elon musk... The men who have changed the world all had problems, all have taken risks and failed dramatically once before in there lifetime. Most people can not do what I do. Why? Because being a trader means you have to be okay with losing money. Too many people have an emotional attachment to the dollar, which makes them make bad decisions, like being down on a position, panic selling at a loss. Only to find the stock shoots up a couple days later. I have trained myself to understand that every time I lose money on a trade, I'm just paying ""tuition"" for my education. I'll learn from my mistake and just never do it again. And move on to the next trade. I have no emotional attachment to money, I just think of it as a game and warren buffet is #1 on the high scores. I'm trying to get as many points (dollars) as I can. It's just numbers to me!"

electricians,37mql5,audit123,9,Thu May 28 19:36:19 2015 UTC,The best thing you could do is get an electrician to look at it ASAP.  There may be other wires up there that are not connected to the chandalier.  Squirrels are infamous for eating the insulation off of wires.  Thats not a good thing.

I made that mistake once - chased one out, had somebody on the outside verify it left the house and then sealed up the hole.  Well there must have been another or maybe it had babies or something, I never found out exactly what but trust me, you do not want to have to deal with a dead animal in an inaccessible part of your house..."

Didn't hear anything and since it was a beautiful day out we thought squirrels are gone. he found the hole where they were coming from and sealed it with metal netting. the squirrel got stuck and started doing this damage.   I don't here or see insalation anymore, is it possible he got electricutied if he bit into the wiring?  what happens if there is a dead animal? like what is the big deal? I would think it just decays and a couple bones are left. Will this cause more issues?   Im sorry. I don't know much about squirrels and houses. as this is my first time dealing with this."
electricians,37mql5,CyFus,1 point,Fri May 29 02:35:33 2015 UTC,"You don't want a dead animal in your ceiling, it can smell bad, possibly for months.  Here's what I would do:   leave light switch off call electrician to fix any electrical issues electrician might be able to advise on where the squirrel is, or even remove it cut out a hole in the ceiling if necessary to remove the squirrel patch/drywall/whatever.  If you do it right, you might be able to cut out a rectangle in the ceiling sheetrock, then patch with the same rectangle and some spackle and paint.   The hassle of cutting a hole in the ceiling is less than the annoyance of smelling a dead animal for weeks or months.  A dead animal can also attract maggots or insects.  Edit: probably a good idea to turn off the breaker too as --404-- said, squirrel might eat on other wires."
electricians,37mqzb,BloodyIron,3,Thu May 28 19:39:03 2015 UTC,"All of the contractors I've worked for in my area call what you're looking for ""the matrix"". One or two IT personnel have called it the patch panel map.   Depends on what you mean by setup. If by setup you mean install new Cat 6 cabling, terminate both ends (be sure to specify 568A or 568B), label to your desired standard*, test and certify from jack to patch panel, and provide you with the test results and matrix of the patch panel, then yes, you should get a matrix. Regardless of who does the work, if you have a solid naming and labeling procedure, anyone should be able to figure out where on the patch panel a specific cable/jack is.  * One of the larger casino/hotel property owners we do work for has a very large document that details EVERY aspect of network cabling, down to the color of the label on the 210 blocks. Every cable is marked with the following at each end with a printed label: equipment room number, rack name/number, panel number, port number. So a typical cable will be labeled something like TR6-A4-153. The plates at the field end have the same information with the room, rack, and panel printed once on the plate, and the port numbers over or under each jack. The policy for naming and labeling is strictly enforced, and when done this way, we have no callbacks or other issues."
electricians,37mqzb,IrishDemon,1 point,Thu May 28 21:19:12 2015 UTC,"Well, generally it seems prudent to go Patch, so A on one end, B on the other. Matters less though since gigabit has auto-mdix baked in now adays.  So far I've seen Patch Panel map, but considering what you say here, ""the networking matrix"" seems more apt for a complete documentation (along the lines of your example).  What are 210 blocks?  Also, is there an RFC or ISO standard for labeling I should follow? (I aspire to be the very best, like no-one ever was...)"
electricians,37mqzb,IrishDemon,2,Thu May 28 22:10:45 2015 UTC,"The field and patch panel terminations should match. Unless otherwise specifically asked for, we terminate everything as 568B.  You can look up the various EIA/TIA standards for ideas on cable labeling and management.   My TLDR, may not be entirely accurate, someone will surely correct me: 210 blocks were designed to replace 110 blocks when cat 6 started pushing bandwidth faster and faster.  The pairs are spaced father apart for NEXT and other certification blocking issues.  110 blocks were designed replace 66 blocks,  and 66 blocks have been around forever. You'll usually see 66 blocks at the telco d-marc, usually with lightning arrestors/fuses. 210 = cat 6; 110 = cat 5e; 66 = cat 3. The blocks are for terminating cabling at not quite the head end location. They're usually near by, and you either cross connect over to another block, or to a patch panel. The blocks allow for changing cabling destinations without having to redo the entire patch panel."
electricians,37mqzb,IrishDemon,1 point,Thu May 28 22:49:41 2015 UTC,Argh I can't remember if A/A or A/B produces patch/crossover. Argh!  I thought the point of 6/6A was to cut down on NEXT so higher bandwidths can happen?
electricians,37mqzb,JMac87,3,Thu May 28 22:55:29 2015 UTC,"Same same = patch, A B = crossover.   The cabling isn't magical, pushing faster speeds requires both different build qualities, and stricter termination methologies than previous generations. Cat 6 doesn't allow you to run the cable longer distances or ignore any of the other rules. In order to get a properly certified system, you have to build and install everything to those specs, otherwise it's only as good as the weakest link. There are some issues that only show up when you push the system, and for Cat 6, power sum NEXT comes up a lot.  Side note, if you have the authority, also specify the test equipment used to certify your new network. Fluke's DTX testers are usually the standard around here,  and one of the reasons is because you can't manipulate test results. Ideal's LANTek line of testers was very easy to fake passing results, and only the eagle eyed or very detail oriented people would catch it."

electricians,37mhyb,mhkesler84,6,Thu May 28 18:36:02 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt that a converter would work. Dryers have a very high power draw, so you converter would need to have a very high watt output. The larger problem is, if something uses 20 amps at 240v, it will use 40 amps at 120v, the wire that you currently have there is guaranteed only rated for 20 amps at the most and will have no chance of being able to supply the needed power. Best case scenario the breaker would trip, worst case is that you have a faulty breaker and it burns the lines up in the walls."

electricians,37k6wf,serenlater,3,Thu May 28 05:51:52 2015 UTC,Depends on the PLC but this could be handled by extending RS-485/ RTU modbus over to the panel and then programming the PLC to work with it.
electricians,37k6wf,djpyro,1 point,Thu May 28 22:57:19 2015 UTC,do you have any links for more info on this I'm not that familiar. I will google it anyways shortly but thanks.
electricians,37k6wf,djpyro,2,Fri May 29 05:06:25 2015 UTC,"Here's an example panel. http://www.automationdirect.com/adc/Shopping/Catalog/Operator_Interfaces/Optimate_Text_Panels/Optimate_600_Series/OP-609  You can read the manual for an example configuration.  At the high level, modbus extends the annunciator panel's memory into your PLC's memory space.  So when you write to memory address V40600 in your PLC, it's actually doing it across a network to a different device's memory.  That device will then use the value written to the memory location to do something.  For example, you have a PLC and a panel that is addressed at V40600.  Look at page 3 of the above document and you'll see X, X+1, X+2, etc.  Each one of those are 16 bit long and each bit corresponds to a status.  If I write to the 5th bit for address V40600 (so the memory looks like 0000000000010000), I'll turn on the indicator for button 5 and the light will turn on.  If I then write the same value but to memory location V40601, the button will start flashing.  All of this can be done over a 2 wire RS-422 network to any number of devices.  It will require your PLC support MODBUS and someone to rework the PLC ladder programming a bit to include the logic to turn on and/or flash lights.  You can also use the above panel for buttons to turn things on and off.  The PLC will then be able to read those at a distance and operate on them."

electricians,37iuq9,microwavedbulb,0,Fri May 29 00:16:06 2015 UTC,I'm sure this gentleman will not be storing a chainsaw above the door that he is putting on front of his panel to make it less of an eye sore.

electricians,37jafa,HighLegDelta,1 point,Thu May 28 01:21:17 2015 UTC,"What of the fact that it is listed as a 100w bulb and the one I have is only stamped 60w? (To make it more difficult, Amazon's product description also says this: ""Base: Medium screw (E26); Bulb Type: A19; Watts: 60"")"
electricians,37jafa,HighLegDelta,2,Thu May 28 01:29:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry didn't look for the right wattage.   Here is the 60W lamp  Medium screw base is the standard light bulb base. A19 is the standard light bulb globe shape. you can get the same lamp with a medium base in different lamp shapes, you just may have to look around for one that matches closer. Or replace the lamp with any lamp you want as long as the wattage is within the fixture limits."
electricians,37jafa,HighLegDelta,1 point,Thu May 28 01:41:58 2015 UTC,So you don't think what I have is an HID bulb?
electricians,37jafa,Jim-Jones,2,Thu May 28 01:53:23 2015 UTC,"I don't.  If you had an HID bulb, there would be a large ballast somewhere for each lamp. The only HID lamp it even looks similar to is a metal halide which would require it to cool down for 10 - 30 minutes before being able to restrike. That would be super inconvenient in a bathroom vanity. They really only use HID lamps for commercial site lighting, high bay lighting, and some can lights in high locations."
electricians,37jafa,Jim-Jones,1 point,Thu May 28 02:17:03 2015 UTC,OP thinks it has a ballast. A 60 watt ballast wouldn't be that big.
electricians,37jafa,gesst,1 point,Thu May 28 04:42:55 2015 UTC,"The cool-down requirement is the giveaway. This does not require that, there' not a warm-up or cool-down time.

electricians,37jafa,TurnbullFL,1 point,Fri May 29 15:18:04 2015 UTC,ISTR some sort of lamps that used an internal filament as a ballast but none of this makes sense for a bathroom.
electricians,37jafa,Waldopemersonjones,2,Fri May 29 15:56:46 2015 UTC,"It's a 60w halogen lamp. You can pick them up at any lighting supply store in your area. The lamp that the other guy linked is not what you want. It has a purple tint to the light, called their ""reveal""  series.  To add: they are brighter at smaller wattage but build up more heat. You can replace it with a 100w 130v a19 and get a similar effect as long as the lights are rated for that power."
electricians,37jafa,Waldopemersonjones,2,Thu May 28 02:19:52 2015 UTC,"This looks like an exact match, except this one has a filament.  BC-60BT15/HAL/CL 120V CLR 60W MD HALOGENA LMP    It's just a halogen bulb, most anything can replace it."

So as long as you put in a lamp that is 120v 60watt(or less), you aren't going to damage the fixture. Just buy a new lamp that physically fits and meets those requirements and you are done."
electricians,37jafa,Waldopemersonjones,1 point,Thu May 28 20:19:21 2015 UTC,"That's the rule I've always known to be true, but I had someone tell me that if the fixture was supposed to use an HID bulb and you used a regular bulb in it, it would damage the fixture and basically burst the bulb when you turned it on. That said....what someone here (might have been you) said about it not being an HID (a.k.a. utility lamp) bulb because it would require cool-down before it would light again made sense because these are not like that."

electricians,37j1av,hangoverprone,3,Thu May 28 00:01:59 2015 UTC,Remove switch plate. Check for power on both sides in on and off positions.
electricians,37j1av,MRVANCLEAVEREDDIT,2,Thu May 28 00:50:45 2015 UTC,1 depending on how it was wired there could be power in the ceiling box the fan is mounted to regardless of weather it works or not  2 if the cleaners tripped a breaker then atlas the outlet they were using when they tripped the breaker would be out too. tripping a breaker won't break your fan completely.  breakers when tripped don't turn to the off position they go to a tripped position that is in some cases just slightly different then the on position. in most cases if a tripped breaker is simply pushed back to the on position it will click and stay there but no power will flow through it until it is clicked all the way off then back on   if you think its the breaker and may have inadvertently pushed it on and obviously don't know what one it is then simply turn all your breakers off then back on

electricians,37gshw,johansense1,2,Wed May 27 19:57:14 2015 UTC,I was just guessing the hot burnt up somewhere from being overloaded. Those makes are known for not tripping. Then again I've seen a 20a BR type hold 34 amps for 20 minutes.
electricians,37gshw,GNRPowdeR,1 point,Wed May 27 20:42:25 2015 UTC,"2 minutes at double rated amps is pretty typical. 5 to 15 seconds at 10 times rated amps. Its possible someone adjusted the screw in that breaker, if you get breakers out of the box that are that bad, you should ship them to the UL or something and tell them to start an investigation.  i think some of the breakers are designed to take advantage of the magnetic forces to trip the breaker sooner than it would otherwise. But if you want faster reaction times you have to use a magnetic breaker."

I am not trying to sell you anything, just advice."

electricians,37gzpl,mveinot,1 point,Wed May 27 16:10:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice about the age of the panel.  We have discussed replacement with our electrician and it's on our list to get replaced soon.  We bought the house a 2 years ago and are slowly working through known issues and this is one of them.  There's a dedicated 220 outlet that use to power a thru the wall A/C Unit and the current unit is 110 and is overloading the 15 amp shared circuit when several things are powered on.  I want to convert it from 220 to 110.  The plan is to remove the double breaker and put in a single and a blank cover and tape and label the extra hot in the panel.  Also, I checked a while back and can't remember now which breaker it is - I just guessed this was the one.  Ultimately, one of these is the dedicated 220 breaker that I need to turn into 110."

It's likely just 2 hots and a ground, so you can't just ""tap into a single hot and the neutral"", because there is no neutral.   Change the breaker to a 15A single pole and put the white that used to be under the 2 pole breaker, to the neutral bar, change the outlet to a standard outlet."
electricians,37gs9m,ithinarine,3,Wed May 27 15:07:42 2015 UTC,"If op changes the breaker, they will need a blank filler.  I usually elect to leave the 2-pole breaker in place and just move the white.  Leave it there until you need another space and mark on the legend spare in pencil."

electricians,37gs9m,ithinarine,1 point,Wed May 27 16:21:55 2015 UTC,"He's saying to just take the white out from under half of the 2-pole breaker, move it to the neutral, and just leave it at that. Don't change out to a single pole breaker or else you'll have an open slot in your panel, this way it's just a dead half breaker that powers nothing.   Perfectly safe, and then you don't need to go buy a new single pole breaker for the short period until you get your panel upgraded."

electricians,37bwzd,kidcharm86,2,Tue May 26 15:45:45 2015 UTC,Southern Illinois. I have read that most of the ground occurs within the first 4 feet and the 8 foot rods are only necessary when there are only 1 rod. When spread out across multiple rods connected together the 4 foot rods will end of giving much more grounding then the 8' alone. Is this not correct?
electricians,37bwzd,IrishDemon,3,Tue May 26 17:41:01 2015 UTC,"This is not correct, at least from a UL Listing and NEC point of view."
electricians,37bwzd,TrouserPudding,1 point,Tue May 26 20:30:29 2015 UTC,"Forget the argument over the NEC.  If you put something in the ground that is not well below frost depth it gets shifted around and pushed up.  Even before it's pushed up it's no longer making good contact.  Just to buy 8 or 10 foot ground rods and be done with it.  They are not expensive for the typical copper clad type (which are totally sufficient - N3DGJ opinion here, not just someone who knows electrical code)."
electricians,37bwzd,kidcharm86,1 point,Wed May 27 01:47:05 2015 UTC,"No, not really.  The NEC requires a ground rod to be a minimum of 8', 250.52(A)(5)(a). According to the Soares book, the ground rod's effective resistance area is directly dependant on the depth of the ground rod. Therefore, a 10' rod is better than an 8' rod. As  a rule of thumb, for maximum effectiveness, the distance between the rods should equal the length of the rods."

electricians,37bwzd,kidcharm86,1 point,Tue May 26 22:59:01 2015 UTC,"Totally makes sense. Each 10' rod would have a 10' sphere of influence, so 20' spacing would be ideal. I would also argue that you should be able to use #6 solid copper to connect each rod as you are using the wire as a grounding electrode conductor to connect the grounding electrodes (rods) and not as the grounding electrode (ground ring)."

electricians,37bwzd,eddiedarko,3,Tue May 26 18:08:58 2015 UTC,"this being said, driving a ground rod every 10' is probably really redundant. the main ground rod should suffice (unless you are reading over 25 ohms to ground) then you need to add another one at least 6' from the first one."
electricians,37bwzd,eddiedarko,4,Tue May 26 18:22:40 2015 UTC,"i realize what you are doing is kind of a redundant ground...and the way you want to do it, may get rid of your ground loops.... but the NEC sets a minimum standard for installations....and the way you want to do it, does not meet those standards."
electricians,37bwzd,eddiedarko,1 point,Tue May 26 18:32:21 2015 UTC,Then why do they even sell shorter ground rods? And why is the copper ground wire from the Breaker Panel ground to the grounding rod smaller than that?

Are you trying to eliminate 60Hz hum, or do you have other issues that you're trying to clear up? You may be able to get rid of some noise by carefully examining the circuit(s) powering your equipment and correcting any wiring issues (shared neutrals, loose wiring at receptacles, ""noisy"" equipment on the same circuit). Another, potentially cheaper solution would be to run a new and clean circuit to your equipment, and verify that your existing grounding is behaving the way it should. Lastly, checking the equipment you're using to see if there's some poor wiring going inside of it or if the cord is damaged. I've noticed the few times I've dealt with sound technicians that they either want EVERYTHING grounded, or nothing grounded. One technician went on to point out that older/high end  stereo equipment used 2 prong no equipment ground power cables long after the 3 prong outlet was in standard use to specifically avoid ground loops and humming..."
electricians,37bwzd,eddiedarko,2,Tue May 26 19:18:42 2015 UTC,"you don't need nearly that size of copper, if the purpose is to make a low inductance RF ground.  a spider web type of arrangement directly underneath your antenna, not under your house will be better.  the larger copper wire is not needed. if you want a better ground, use more wire.  two #12 wires 3 inches apart in the same trench will do as much as one # 8 wire and cost a lot less.. its just a matter of surface area and the usual skin effect calculations.  if you really wanted to throw 14$ a pound at this solution.. you can buy 3 inch wide .005"" copper foil and bury that in the ground 1 foot deep. yeah, it will corrode, sure, but it will have more surface area than the ground rods.. which means you probably won't need them.  In my neck of the woods, the utility crew pulled up a pole and it had a 6 or 8 inch wide strip of copper about 6 feet long wraped around the bottom of the pole, with a # 4 wire leading up to the neutral (they do this on every pole with a transformer around here) and after 40 years, the copper was not pitted. brown, sure, but not pitted."

We had just finished dinner and half the power in the house went out, first it browned then blacked. There was a wicked thunderstorm at the time so I was pretty sure I knew exactly what happened.  I went down to his panel and sure enough no trips. Pulled the cover off and checked everything. No power to one bus, just like I thought. As I'm putting the cover back on my wife yells, ""You fixed it""!...I'm thinking I sure as fuck did not. Pull the cover back off, and yep...power to both legs now. Weird, but I'm pretty sure it's not gonna stay, and sure enough a few minutes later it goes out. I tell my FIL he lost a leg and needs to call the power co. I go outside in the pouring rain and wind and look at the service drop. Looks fine from the ground (nothing disconnected or arcing), but I'm betting it's a loose bug or worse.  A couple of hours later the linesman comes out and does his thing In really shitty conditions. Those guys don't get paid enough sometimes.

electricians,37aj2p,VVillyD,1 point,Wed May 27 14:01:37 2015 UTC,"I've seen similar things several time. I'd bet almost anything that you have an open neutral somewhere. Judging by the fact that it sounds like all circuits in your house are experiencing the same problem, I'd say the neutral in your panel came off it's terminal (unlikely if nothing happened in or near your panel shortly before the problem started) or something happened with the service entrance wires. I'd start by opening your panel and visually inspecting the largest neutral (white) wire, which should be terminated to the largest terminal on the neutral bar. If it looks like it is terminated properly and not loose, you should contact your electrical company because they will probably need to fix a transformer or the wires coming into your house.  If you have an electrical meter, you can test this by checking for continuity between the neutral bar (or incoming neutral wire) and the neutral port on a receptacle in your house (the slot on the left of the ground hole is on the bottom, it will sometimes look like a sideways ""T"")"
electricians,37aj2p,Kelsenellenelvial,1 point,Tue May 26 12:18:20 2015 UTC,"The ones that look like a sideways ""T"" are for 20A outlets.  Otherwise neutral will be the bigger slot(in case one has two prong outlets), assuming it's wired correctly."
electricians,37aj2p,achtagon,3,Tue May 26 19:33:43 2015 UTC,To echo others here its likely something to do with the wires coming from the power pole to your house. Call the electric company for a free checkup of service hookup.

I was working in Norway for some time where they have 2 phases and this fits the description aswell that 1 phase has dropped out of the two so the lights are working at 50% (which they would if you would have a dimmable lamp that you set on 50% where they only get 50% of the current).

Devices on the bad leg might not get enough current to run normally so sensitive devices, like home electronics don't work, but something like an incandescent light will work at reduced output.  Since its dependent on a 240 device being part of the circuit you get things like the lights only work when the oven, or electic water heater is running, while said 240 device itself doesn't work, or runs at reduced power.  My dad experienced similar issues(certain lights only worked when the stove/dryer were on) when a tree damaged one leg between the pole and his house.  It might not be a complete break, could be a partial short, like a tree contacting one leg coming into the house, or a loose connection in one leg at the panel.

If it heats beyond its design temperature, the resistance will change more, but resistors are designed to have a constant resistance.  Light bulbs, on the other hand, are not designed to have a constant resistance, and the resistance of the light bulb will change a lot as it heats up to its normal operating temperature.  You can figure out what its resistance is under normal operating conditions by P=V2 /R.  Trial and error is the best way to find the correct resistor size, but you can start with one about the same resistance and power rating as the light bulb, and see what happens.

But, as /u/JohnKinbote said, this is a wasteful way to dim a light.  The power the resistor dissipates is wasted, unless you needed that heat for something.  Incandescent light bulbs are already wasteful in that way, and when you add a resistor, you're increasing the fraction of the total energy that comes out as heat (instead of light).

The resistive effects of heating are what make a lightbulb light and stay lit, but resistors are supposed to provide uniform resistance no matter what (within their margin of error, 20%, 10%, or 5%).  Because the resistive effects of heating will decrease with decreased heat i. e. current flow (you'll find that there is actually no or very little resistance on a lightbulb when it isn't lit), it may be difficult to pin down exactly what the value should be in theory, and may take some experimentation to get the values that ""your friend"" wants."

If the wire length for the AC homerun is less than 100 feet from the panel, 10 awg copper wire with a single 30 amp breaker. Local codes as well as building restrictions (conduit, deration due to ambient, distance, etc) may increase the size of the wire. Note that the unit says a minimum circuit size of 20 amps is required, and the sum of the loads is less than 20 amps. You could possibly get away with #12 copper, but I'd only do that if this was spitting distance from the panel. Also keep in mind that as HVAC units age, the draw at startup increases, and installing #10 copper is cheap insurance.   As others have said, you ""helping"" may not change or lower the cost of the electrician."

electricians,374xet,ACDCbaggs,0,Mon May 25 04:44:54 2015 UTC,A 20 amp circuit will have 4800 watts of power.  But electric baseboard is a continuous load.  You would only get 3840 legally.  Most electric baseboard is 250 watts per foot allowing you to have up to 15 feet on one 20 amp circuit.  Most electricians I know will put 2-8 ft sections on one circuit going to 4000 watts.

electricians,374a2k,Watchful1ntervention,2,Sun May 24 19:11:30 2015 UTC,"For the GFCI plugs, you only need to protect the first one on the circuit if you know which one it is. On the back of the plug there is a second terminal for the rest of your circuit. The breakers are usually more expensive and since your house is old, it may or may not be available for your panel. Assuming the same quality, they provide the same protection though most contractors go plugs due to price.  While the shock potential is not huge on its own, there are many things that could happen with the increased humidity and wetness. I would personally do for my own home if it had flooding issues since its a realitivly easy fix and would give a little more piece of mind."
electricians,374a2k,Delois2,1 point,Mon May 25 00:34:43 2015 UTC,"For the GFCI plugs, you only need to protect the first one on the circuit if you know which one it is.   You could trace back the circuit and add an extra outlet at a higher point to protect the rest."
electricians,374a2k,Jim-Jones,1 point,Mon May 25 22:29:30 2015 UTC,"I know GFI outlets wouldn't help if the outlets themselves become submerged, since the power feeding the outlets would be exposed pre-GFI.   But you can't touch this power (uh, well, if you can, fix that...), so it doesn't matter   because some of the outlets are very difficult to physically access enough to change an outlet (i.e. buried behind installations or in tight corners).   You only need to GFCI the first receptacle in the circuit; the others will be protected off of it.    What are the disadvantages of the breakers?   They cost more, and you've got to go walk over to the breaker panel to reset them.  That said, I prefer GFCI breakers for everything except kitchens and bathrooms; for basements and outside and anywhere else, you might find yourself taking several trips around the room trying to find which one the GFCI is.    If the water can carry the power from a submerged electrical source to you, wouldn't it also simply carry it to ground and subsequently trip the breaker?   Water is not nearly as good a conductor of electricity as copper is.  When you touch copper to copper, the breaker shorts cuz you put a bazillion amps through the circuit.  When you touch copper to copper via gallons of water, you might only be sending a few amps through it.  But it only takes 1-5mA properly placed to kill you...  Exactly how and where and how much electricity there would be if you just drop a live wire into a pool of water depends how dirty the water is, what other metal is going on nearby in the water, where you are, what you're touching, what you're wearing... etc. etc. etc.  TL;DR:  GFCI that shit, yo.

Since we have three wire, I am gona guess its 1 hot, 1 IC, and one switchleg. The curent wiring looks like they wanted to have the plug on the switch as well (which for your uses is unneeded.) If I were a guessing man without tools, I would guess the black is the hot, white is IC and red is switch leg. Try testing that by removing it all and just connect the black and red to the switch. IF this works, then split the black between the plug and the switch and use the white for the neutral. They may of split the plug on the neutral side for some reason (removing the metal part that connects the screws) and if this is the case you either new plug or to jumper the screws.  EDIT: Also the hidden box is a violation by canadian code, I cant say for certain for the US but I think its safe to assume so."
electricians,373dp2,Delois2,1 point,Wed May 27 18:32:05 2015 UTC,"The only problem with what you're saying is that there is a black pig tail off the white wires going to the dimmer as well, so the white definitely isn't a common wire.   It looks as though it was supposed to be 1 hot and 2 switch legs for a ceiling fan, but a fan didn't get installed so the plug just got put in as a space saver and is actually wired in series back up to the light box.   That's what it looks like to me at least."
electricians,373dp2,ithinarine,1 point,Sun May 24 18:43:57 2015 UTC,"I just pulled a dimmer from my truck and the ""wheel"" is in the top right and is a small black ""wheel""  For this post and orientation purposes the ground screw location is the down or bottom. Hopes this helps."
electricians,373dp2,mantecajeffr,1 point,Tue May 26 21:40:46 2015 UTC,I would bet that you have knob and tube wiring that has been added on to at some point. The reason I think this is that my journeyman and I have done 2 houses like this so far. The reason it won't dim may be because it is getting back fed from a device down line or there might be something hinky in the joints in the wall. You should probably call a certified electrician to look into it
electricians,373dp2,Bloodless101,1 point,Sun May 24 16:02:43 2015 UTC,Dimmer also appears to be a three way; I see black and gold screws.
electricians,373dp2,Terrancelee,1 point,Sun May 24 20:56:49 2015 UTC,Just because it's a 3-way doesn't mean it has to be used as one.
electricians,373dp2,ithinarine,1 point,Mon May 25 21:01:13 2015 UTC,"In a manner of speaking, you are correct.  Although, you are making the other screw hot when the switch is off, and that's not a great idea when you have people that don't really know what they are doing poking around in boxes."
electricians,373dp2,Terrancelee,1 point,Tue May 26 21:25:55 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be 100% sure until I was able to pull out a meter and check voltages, but it looks like you've got some stuff wired in series."
electricians,373dp2,ithinarine,1 point,Wed May 27 04:23:22 2015 UTC,What's the consequence of having something wired in series?
electricians,373dp2,ithinarine,1 point,Tue May 26 21:35:37 2015 UTC,"As long as you don't use that outlet, nothing really. But of you were to use it, and the red wire back up to the light box were attached to something else, whatever is plugged in and whatever the red were attached to would only get part of 120v disproportional to their resistance."
electricians,373dp2,mantecajeffr,1 point,Wed May 27 01:32:26 2015 UTC,"There is a small.""wheel"" on the dimmer that controls the amount of voltage passed thru in the low setting. Very easy."
electricians,373dp2,Hari___Seldon,1 point,Wed May 27 01:40:11 2015 UTC,The light can't be switched off at all. It won't go under 5%. Playing with this wheel only changes the intensity at the lowest setting when the dimmer is on. Turning it on/off and changing the intensity are separate controls on this dimmer.
electricians,373q4b,mveinot,2,Sun May 24 16:22:50 2015 UTC,"I tend to keep electronics plugged in through high quality ""dumb"" UPS power bars. They have a small battery backup system that can keep low current devices like routers, game consoles and other small electronic devices running for a couple minutes during power outages or brown outs.  Keeps your voltage constant and gives you a while to safely shut down devices and/or save your game in the event of a longer outage."
electricians,373q4b,mveinot,1 point,Sun May 24 16:36:18 2015 UTC,This is something I should've done a long time ago. Thanks for reminding me!    EDIT : Any recommendations? I'm not sure exactly what to look for.
electricians,373q4b,mveinot,2,Sun May 24 16:38:25 2015 UTC,I use the APC ones like this for my desktop and entertainment electronics. Using the little drop down menu at the top of the list there you can change your estimated combined power draw by your devices and then choose based on your desired run-time and budget.
electricians,373q4b,mveinot,1 point,Sun May 24 16:46:40 2015 UTC,"So I will have : 1 beast computer with two monitors (1 is a TV reused as a monitor) and three gaming consoles (N64, Wii and Wii U.)    Is 450 Watts sufficient?    Thanks for your help!"
electricians,373q4b,mveinot,1 point,Sun May 24 17:14:11 2015 UTC,I'm sure you will get some run time with that during an outage. It should be more than adequate to patch you over short brown outs.  Are both displays LCD? How big is the PSU on the computer? It's more than enough for the consoles - it's just the PC I'd be concerned about. I imagine that should be fine though for the purpose.
electricians,373q4b,PriceZombie,1 point,Sun May 24 17:22:45 2015 UTC,"I personally don't really care about having much run time during an outage, because we don't have them a lot anyway (thinking of it, I think we haven't have any for the four years we live here.) If it's enough to save my work quickly and shut the computer down, it's perfect for me.)    Both displays are LCD. The PSU on the computer is 1000W, but is not used at 100% at all. I just prefer to have more than enough, just in case.    Otherwise I thought of buying something like this ?"
electricians,3748ho,personanongratatoo,1 point,Sun May 24 18:58:50 2015 UTC,Thanks everyone! I'm going to send your thoughts and suggestions to the bro and see what he thinks he can do... MUCH appreciated!
electricians,3748ho,Imaelectrician,1 point,Mon May 25 02:49:36 2015 UTC,"UPDATE:  Well, brother came by again, took a deep breath and just ripped the ""fake"" remote switch off the wall... it was glued to the wall and there are no wires. THEN we realized another light switch farther along the wall that never works had a really small on/off switch along the bottom of the face plate. So... brother flips that almost invisible switch and ta-dah... the light switch functions to turn the light on and off.  As an experiment, we turned the light off to see if it would magically come on again. It hasn't! We think the ""remote"" light switch was going bad and the small on/off toggle for the second switch served to activate the remote and deactivate the normal state of the light switch. So far so good. Does that make sense?"
electricians,3748ho,Imaelectrician,0,Wed May 27 01:26:40 2015 UTC,It's some sort of remote control switch I would guess. Probably with some sort of receiver in the light fixture. It's probably turning on because something is interfering with it and making it turn on (something else remote controlled with a similar frequency probably).
electricians,3748ho,hacknsplat,1 point,Sun May 24 22:21:46 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. We don't have any close neighbors with something that would reach this far (I would think), but that's one idea you have there! I'm trying to think of what kind of interference it could be? It used to come on rarely but the past couple of days it's been NUTS."
electricians,3748ho,coogie,0,Sun May 24 22:28:47 2015 UTC,"It could honestly be anything, electronics in your house giving off noise, radio waves, a faulty unit that's just triggering itself, etc."
electricians,3748ho,Jim-Jones,-1,Sun May 24 22:32:56 2015 UTC,"Another possibility is the batteries are going flat, and the light is coming on as some sort of fail-safe - try installing fresh batteries."
electricians,3748ho,coogie,-1,Mon May 25 01:51:49 2015 UTC,"If that is in fact related to the light, it's some sort of timer device.  Just take it out and put a switch."
electricians,373cd1,timeslider,3,Sun May 24 14:13:56 2015 UTC,Ya you'll be working the other 36 or so hours for a contractor. You guys are lucky to get paid at school though. Our local does one 40 hour week of school every few months and you can file unemployment for that week.
electricians,373cd1,FunkyMonk707,3,Sun May 24 14:18:42 2015 UTC,"We do 40 hours of work a week then go to school two nights a week for 3 hours a night, 9 months a year. Some days i get up at 445 to get ready for work and then get home at 9:20pm after school."
electricians,373cd1,PatrickMorris,1 point,Sun May 24 15:10:49 2015 UTC,"Damn, what time are classes like right after your shift ends?"
electricians,373cd1,Peezy,1 point,Sun May 24 18:52:14 2015 UTC,"Nah, I have to sit around from 3:30 until 5:30 when class starts because i live an hour away from school and most of the jobs that i end up working"
electricians,373cd1,PatrickMorris,2,Sun May 24 19:07:57 2015 UTC,"That's exactly how it was when I went through. I was lucky enough to live within a couple of miles of the school. Needless to say, several of my apprentice buddies met up at my house before class on school nights."
electricians,373cd1,Theupper1,2,Mon May 25 01:22:54 2015 UTC,"I work 40-45 hours a week and have a class after work on Wednesdays that goes from 5:30-10:00, I have to finance it myself as well. So you have a pretty good balance with your current employer, in my opinion."
electricians,373cd1,North0House,1 point,Sun May 24 16:14:44 2015 UTC,What country is this in? If Canada I can answer your questions.
electricians,373cd1,Delois2,1 point,Sun May 24 18:55:59 2015 UTC,"I find this extremely interesting. I'm a journeyman electrician in Manitoba, Canada, and the structure of my apprenticeship was wildly different. Here, you work for 9 1/2 months full time, then attend school (while receiving EI, @ 55% of your normal wages) for ten weeks and pass the level. Repeat three more times, write for your ticket, and BAM."
electricians,373cd1,citizenc,1 point,Sun May 24 22:42:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unfortunately each company can handle it differently.  Mine's non-union, in the states. They used to offer two different scheduling options -- either you have one day of class every other week, or you had three days of class every 6 weeks, either of which is at the local tech college.  Currently the latter is our only option, with the company trying to transition to in-house week-long classes.  We get paid the entire time we're in class, work on jobsites when not in class.  The tuition is mostly funded by the company, with the student responsible for approx. $1800/year in tuition to ABC."
electricians,373cd1,XirallicBolts,1 point,Mon May 25 00:15:25 2015 UTC,"My local does it where we get the rate based on your year of apprenticeship, we go to school one day a week for...10? months of the year paid by our JATC.  But that's only for the first 3 (and a half ?)years then the last chunk you have to go to night classes.  Additionally, our pay from going to school is cut monthly instead of weekly on a separate check from the contractor's payroll."
electricians,373cd1,whiteout82,1 point,Mon May 25 14:31:41 2015 UTC,"We go from 1-7pm, one day a week, all year long. So our paycheck usually only covers 37 hours. From the responses, seems like it really depends on the JATC."
electricians,373g88,YAK_CITY,5,Sun May 24 14:53:12 2015 UTC,Would have to see what's going on behind the wall cover/outlet. Would seem that live current probably made contact with the box behind that corner and arced until it wasn't making contact anymore.  I certainly wouldn't use the outlet (or re-energize its circuit) until it's replaced. But in its current state with the breaker turned off it's safe until your landlord returns.
electricians,373g88,mveinot,2,Sun May 24 15:23:12 2015 UTC,Anyone want to start a pool on whether or not it was an FPE breaker?
electricians,373g88,Eglitarian,2,Sun May 24 17:15:44 2015 UTC,"Ouch. Would explain why it didn't trip. I would have expected it to with that much charring.  Edit: How old is the building, OP?"
electricians,373g88,mveinot,1 point,Sun May 24 17:16:49 2015 UTC,"Building itself was constructed in 1908, but it was completely renovated in 2010, would have to assume all the in-suite electrical work is new. Panel is a Cutler-Hammer CPM116"
electricians,373g88,mveinot,2,Sun May 24 17:40:12 2015 UTC,Any chance you could post a picture of your breaker panel?
electricians,373g88,mveinot,2,Sun May 24 17:41:21 2015 UTC,http://i.imgur.com/CHQqxk5.jpg
electricians,373g88,Dobako,2,Sun May 24 17:49:40 2015 UTC,Yep - that's absolutely a nice modern panel.  Are you positive it hadn't tripped? The tripped state of some breakers is not visually very different than their engaged state. Was power still available at the other outlets on that circuit before you turned it off?
electricians,373g88,Jim-Jones,1 point,Sun May 24 17:52:28 2015 UTC,"You know, I think it was not fully in the ""on"" position when I turned it off last night, I was a bit drunk and panicking so I hope I'm not misremembering but I think that was the case. I did not test any of the other outlets.  I only had one other appliance plugged in, a small coffee grinder, I inspected it just now and it looks like its cord had frayed, I noticed a small scorch mark and hole in the cable, I have to imagine that that was the source of the arc. Getting rid of that now obviously."
