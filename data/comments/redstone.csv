redstone,3e3fl2,potato_delusions,11,Tue Jul 21 17:37:14 2015 UTC,"It is theoretically possible. It would however probably take a larger Redstone computer than ever built. Modern computers are many orders of magnitude more complex than even the most complicated Redstone computer ever built. You also may reach the bottleneck in which your (real physical) computer is not large enough to contain the simulation... as it too is computer ""sized"" in complexity."
redstone,3e3fl2,Vinterslag,5,Tue Jul 21 17:56:24 2015 UTC,"also, the simulated OS may be so large, not all the chunks that are needed to hold it would be loaded at the same time, causing some areas of the device to not function properly"
redstone,3e3fl2,Cocoamix86,4,Tue Jul 21 18:08:57 2015 UTC,"Yep. Larger redstone builds actually utilize 'bots' (AFK players, as I understand it) or mods to force continuous loading of build chunks."
redstone,3e3fl2,cabbagery,5,Tue Jul 21 20:13:33 2015 UTC,Vanilla chunk loaders are also an option.
redstone,3e3fl2,TPHRyan,2,Wed Jul 22 00:03:18 2015 UTC,"Take a look at Open Redstone  I'm not sure if a full functioning OS has been made, but I know computers have been made in redstone before.  Anything made in redstone would most likely have to resemble the computers of 4-5 decades ago, rather than a modern computer. There are also many old Operating systems that would be fairly lightweight (Like a Forth or LISP OS) and doable in redstone."
redstone,3e3fl2,ajventi,2,Tue Jul 21 19:10:35 2015 UTC,Possible? Yes. Feasible? No way.
redstone,3e3fl2,794613825,2,Tue Jul 21 21:28:00 2015 UTC,"Is is possible in theory (redstone logic is Turing complete), but extremely difficult in practise. The main difficulty is slow signal propagation time."
redstone,3e3fl2,Eipifi,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:22:54 2015 UTC,"A while back I saw a working four-function calculator someone made that required an enormous amount of redstone and was very complex. But, I think it showed the potential for what could be done given enough time and effort, so I imagine a simple OS of some kind would be possible."

redstone,3e37go,justanotherpony,2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:53 2015 UTC,"Can it push gravel/sand right to the top? If so, it could be used as an elevator"
redstone,3e37go,Cocoamix86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:07:50 2015 UTC,"wont push sand up but will push me, tho need to make a piston push off at top or will fall back down, and getting on is still to be worked out as wil get pushed out if not inside glass  edit - seems bit glitchy as will drop out if not in the correct bit"
redstone,3e37go,idiotninja,2,Tue Jul 21 17:22:42 2015 UTC,gif or youtube video maybe?
redstone,3e37go,idiotninja,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:36:25 2015 UTC,"might try a vid tho im on shoddy internet atm, can upload the save if you want."
redstone,3e37go,idiotninja,2,Tue Jul 21 17:40:42 2015 UTC,That'd be cool.

redstone,3e15ij,thsuk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:15:00 2015 UTC,"I didn't know how they worked wither at first, and then I watched some tutorials. Lots of the learning also comes from messing around"
redstone,3e15ij,justanotherpony,2,Tue Jul 21 13:01:05 2015 UTC,"looks pretty cool, iv been messing about making a piston conveyor mechanism vertical and its been making my head hurt:P tho got it working eventually  http://i.imgur.com/qQ1SAwA.png  http://i.imgur.com/6bIXVYH.png"

redstone,3e15ij,vin97,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:39:34 2015 UTC,"soz was meaning that compared to your build its fairly simple, not played for a while so just been seeing what's new and messing about, and not even sure if worth posting some stuff as not sure if already been made already, or even what the name of it is, like this part i made that takes row of inputs but outputs only 1, went between cart storage and 7 seg display decoder http://i.imgur.com/LDHWgiI.png"
redstone,3e15ij,Enjiniaokage,2,Tue Jul 21 15:08:47 2015 UTC,"cool, so this is digital, right?  do you think that an analogue 10-bit adder would be faster?"
redstone,3dyf3s,Cocoamix86,2,Mon Jul 20 15:34:13 2015 UTC,"Cool! What about two's complement, though?"
redstone,3dyf3s,elyisgreat,3,Mon Jul 20 17:20:00 2015 UTC,Uses 2's complement. Can calculate negatives
redstone,3dyf3s,elyisgreat,2,Mon Jul 20 17:22:54 2015 UTC,"Oh! Awesome!   EDIT: Can it add, then, as well?"
redstone,3dsu7i,Cocoamix86,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:06:42 2015 UTC,Doesn't using comparators sorta ruin the whole reason for not using repeaters?
redstone,3dsu7i,MacerV,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:16:18 2015 UTC,it's for the challenge. Working with comparators is harder than repeaters
redstone,3dsu7i,munin295,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:23:04 2015 UTC,"It looks your input is already one-hot which is good. Just run each input line out a ways (or up-ish) and then run output lines perpendicular to the inputs (like the OR-plane of a PLA), and connect the appropriate input lines to each output. For example, the ""8"" input would connect to all the outputs, and the ""1"" input would connect only to the ""top-right"" and ""bottom-right"" outputs."

redstone,3dniz5,Cocoamix86,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:09:19 2015 UTC,"thanks, didn't think it was as simple as adding _min. To take it one step further, is it possible to run a command when a player right clicks an item?"
redstone,3dniz5,MezzoTech,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:02:37 2015 UTC,That would depend on the item. Some items have a use item stat in the default list of scoreboard objectives
