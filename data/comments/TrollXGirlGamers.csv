TrollXGirlGamers,3e2zf7,ColleenEHA,2,Tue Jul 21 19:59:04 2015 UTC,I saw a Rogue at one of the cons I went to - it was magnificent. I couldn't help but compliment him (her).

TrollXGirlGamers,3dudw0,Throwaway_4_opinions,2,Sun Jul 19 15:54:59 2015 UTC,What game was it?
TrollXGirlGamers,3dudw0,soapsrthebest,4,Sun Jul 19 20:13:26 2015 UTC,FTL at the time.
TrollXGirlGamers,3dudw0,Jak11350,2,Sun Jul 19 20:16:05 2015 UTC,Such a good but hard game.
TrollXGirlGamers,3dudw0,2popcorn9000,2,Sun Jul 19 20:36:42 2015 UTC,I felt like this when I bought Evolve at work. I literally could not wait for the day to end.
TrollXGirlGamers,3dudw0,theficus,2,Mon Jul 20 01:35:42 2015 UTC,Getting packages does this to me. All it takes is one Amazon notification and my productivity skyrockets.
TrollXGirlGamers,3dsaxw,Rosefae,5,Sat Jul 18 23:49:53 2015 UTC,"The worst one for me was the ""kill a legendary dragon"" achievement because those things don't even start to spawn until your character level hits the late-70s. This was before they brought in the new Legendary skill system, so grinding up 20+ levels was a nightmare."
TrollXGirlGamers,3dsaxw,Kimmalah,5,Sun Jul 19 00:51:54 2015 UTC,"That's the one I'm missing! I'm at level 65 now, so I've got some grinding ahead of me. Luckily I will probably just reset my primary skills a bunch of times."
TrollXGirlGamers,3dsaxw,Kimmalah,3,Sun Jul 19 01:05:19 2015 UTC,"They didn't show up until I hit level 78, which is apparently the minimum. Unfortunately I was finished with Dawnguard (the only DLC available at the time) and every other dungeon I could find by level 50-something. :/"
TrollXGirlGamers,3dsaxw,Kimmalah,3,Sun Jul 19 01:10:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, same. I installed Wyrmstooth (a DLC-like mod) just to give me something to do while I grind!"
TrollXGirlGamers,3dsaxw,Elendira,3,Sun Jul 19 01:12:45 2015 UTC,Well if you're on PC you could probably just spawn a dragon in with console commands. But I understand why you wouldn't too.
TrollXGirlGamers,3dsaxw,Wetmelon,2,Sun Jul 19 01:19:30 2015 UTC,"If I was going to use console commands, I would have done it for the vampire perks achievement. Gonna do it without cheating. :)"
TrollXGirlGamers,3dsaxw,ageeksgirl08,3,Sun Jul 19 01:21:46 2015 UTC,"Fortify restoration potions will get you everywhere. ;) Although it makes the game trivial depending on how crazy you get, I suppose"
TrollXGirlGamers,3dscfy,ummeiko,2,Sun Jul 19 00:04:19 2015 UTC,"Nice! Now you get to the super fun part of the game - going back and finding all of the cool things that you missed, and figure out every character's storyline!  (There is a LOT in the game. Did you find Ash Lake?)"
TrollXGirlGamers,3dscfy,RonstaMonsta,2,Sun Jul 19 00:52:08 2015 UTC,"I found ash lake, yes (kind of by accident when I was exploring blighttown), although the hydra was giving me fits so I didn't kill that.  I've got some tails to cut off still.  I made my husband tell me if I missed any optional bosses before I got to Gwyn (though not really how to get there or fight them... I just wanted to fight everything on the first go).  We had mini-argument/discussion over whether I was supposed to parry Gwyn.  He was like ""I think it was designed that way, Gwyn puts too much pressure on you otherwise"" and has always killed him with parry.  I had one or two good parry attempts and then a whoooooooooooole ton of parry whiffing, dead-in-10-seconds attempts and I said screw it.  When in doubt, roll about.  I don't think I could've done it if I didn't have a long weapon though (Ornstein's Spear was my weapon of choice as soon as I got it - spears are pretty amazing).  Artorias was my favorite fight.  O+S took the most attempts, but I'd say in terms of mechanics, Manus was the hardest.  Next thing I want to do, other than starting DS2, is make a caster.  I've been pure melee for Demon's and Dark Souls.  Caster seems fun."
TrollXGirlGamers,3dscfy,RonstaMonsta,2,Sun Jul 19 01:10:33 2015 UTC,"Awesome! 99% of players miss Ash Lake on their first playthrough. (Mostly because Blighttown is a miserable place).   Parrying Gwyn is totally legit, but you have to be confident. My first time I took the ""ROLL, ROLL YOUR CRAZY UNDEAD"" approach as well - although I was using the balder side sword, which has a pretty short range.  I feel the same about about Artorias! That fight is the perfect blend of aggression and caution.   What was your endgame build? Did you end up more tanky, or light/no armor for rolling speed?  Also, if you've been the game in melee, a caster playthrough will probably feel VERY easy for you - except for getting to Seath. Everything in there has magic resistance and takes a lot less damage from it.  (Most important question of all - did you manage to save Solaire?)"

TrollXGirlGamers,3do0gd,Throwaway_4_opinions,3,Fri Jul 17 20:51:11 2015 UTC,What game?
TrollXGirlGamers,3do0gd,girlwithruinedteeth,9,Fri Jul 17 20:58:06 2015 UTC,"Homeworld Cataclysm. The company who made it was a third party outside of Relic Entertainment called Barking Dog Studios. They eventually were bought and merged with Rockstar. Supposedly some dev said they might have it, but I'm not holding my breath we would have heard about it by now. Even more upsetting is Homeworld Cataclysm is sort of treated like the red-headed stepchild of the series."
TrollXGirlGamers,3do0gd,Ericshelpdesk,2,Fri Jul 17 21:04:31 2015 UTC,Homeworld Cataclysm?

TrollXGirlGamers,3diele,sidekcks,3,Thu Jul 16 14:59:13 2015 UTC,Ever tried emulators? They're free and you can download any sort of game you want. You just gotta find the emulator system you want. I have one for GameCube and N64 :D
TrollXGirlGamers,3diele,SweetBlueBerries,2,Thu Jul 16 19:30:54 2015 UTC,"I have, but only on windows. I run a Mac now and I'm whiny about having to run bootcamp to get most of the good emulators. I'm probably gonna just bite the bullet and get it set up, because I miss playing my old Dreamcast."
TrollXGirlGamers,3diele,graycountertop,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:36:05 2015 UTC,Most Nintendo emulators run well. If you have a Mac you should be able to run Wii and everything before it.  Depends on specs

TrollXGirlGamers,3di702,Ithlilian,9,Thu Jul 16 13:56:59 2015 UTC,"Goals to live by. He sets a prime example for us all. It sounds like my SO. He beat Dragon Age:Inquisition female and immediately replayed it as a male because he wanted to ""relate to the character more."" He played all the way to the end of Witcher 3 and then started over because he felt he had missed some important quests. I'm over here like having ADD issues with finishing even one before League calls my name."
TrollXGirlGamers,3di702,Cronoan,6,Thu Jul 16 16:16:14 2015 UTC,"He won't play through shooters on all the difficulty levels though, so his completionism is not consistent.   His reasoning for this one was just in case they somehow reference your game data in ME4 he has to be prepared. He beat them all before on playstation, then beat them again because he got ME3 for xbox, and now he's on my xbox and couldn't find old saved data from his. Way too much effort.  I'm sitting here playing Witcher 3 on easy mode, way over leveled, skipping all kinds of question marks and treasure hunts. He's in the dreaded I have nothing I want to play zone and that's never good."
TrollXGirlGamers,3di702,Cronoan,2,Thu Jul 16 16:35:23 2015 UTC,Ahhhh yeah I hate being in that position. At least he's found a way to channel his gaming lethargy. I always rediscover MMOs when I get to that point.
TrollXGirlGamers,3di702,premonition-tree,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:53:00 2015 UTC,"If he's only playing through again to make sure he has game saves for ME4 he may want to wait though.
