People should stop using these buzzwords like ""dark"" and ""gritty"" and ""grounded"" and ""realistic"" and shit. It's not grounded, it's in no way realistic, it's not even particularly dark! The hero killed the bad guy, IT HAPPENS. It happened in Iron Man, it happened in Batman 89, Batman Forever, it happened in fucking Green Lantern (he threw the bad guy into the sun), it happened in X-3 (stabbing Jean), it happened in Iron Man 2, it happened in Iron Man 3, it happened in fucking Thor 2, it happened in Captain America 2, it happened in Age of Ultron-hell, AoU killed a hero and it wasn't hailed as particularly dark! Granted a throwaway hero, but didn't they kill Coulson in Avengers? That's darker than what happened in MoS. (Sure, he came back and that was an asspull and part of why Marvel ceased to impress me)  Just because there aren't so many jokes or banal lightweight flat characters, because there aren't so many pointless one liners, does that mean it's dark? No, it means it leans more towards the dramatic than the comedic. Marvel does the comedic less than the dramatic and it works, it's fun while you're there. DC is doing the dramatic, treating its heroes with the weight they deserve-gods on earth-with no apologies. Meanwhile Marvel wrings its hands trying to convince audiences to like Ant-Man.   Now as for Superman killing Zod? The people who shit themselves over it in the first place were the sort of people who were going to get angry about the ending no matter what. I don't see anyone bashing Tony Stark for killing his mentor/business partner in the skies above Los Angeles in self defense. Thor dropped a spaceship on Malekith. Star-Lord disintegrated a guy, a guy who also dropped a spaceship on a city after killing multiple defensive military corpsmen.   DC is going to bring an epic scope to CBM's that has never been explored. These are going to be like Star Wars or Saving Private Ryan instead of Other Guy Avengers.   Fuck the haters."
DC_Cinematic,3e2jhf,alwaysupvoteTRUNKS,14,Tue Jul 21 14:31:00 2015 UTC,Well I'd say Zod's death carried more weight then the deaths in most those other movies did.  The majority of those movies treated killing the villain as no big deal.

Exactly     In the end, Superman's forced to take the life of Zod to stop him from killing an innocent. Right in that moment, director Zack Snyder understood that Superman wasn't always going to be able to do the right thing; that sometimes, he would have to pay the price.     It took me a while to get over the fact he killed Zod but finally understanding what they are doing with the DC Cinematic Universe it totally makes sense."

DC_Cinematic,3e0l2o,KYplusEL,0,Wed Jul 22 00:54:13 2015 UTC,I honestly think they won't be using Green Arrow in the movie universe.  DC has been silently separating their characters from TV and film and I think they're only duplicating where absolutely necessary (see Flash).   They've already removed several other characters from the TV shows and I don't think Green Arrow is a big enough character to break the segregation.
DC_Cinematic,3e0l2o,theseus12347,2,Tue Jul 21 02:14:11 2015 UTC,Which characters did they remove? (I don't watch the tv shows)
DC_Cinematic,3e0l2o,KYplusEL,5,Tue Jul 21 03:29:29 2015 UTC,"This is something a lot of people are talking about that really isn't true. They started saying it because Deadshot died on arrow and Amanda Waller stopped appearing for long periods shortly after the Suicide Squad casting.   So of course the internet went crazy saying how the movies would ruin the TV shows. But in reality Deadshot's death was a ""death."" It was pretty ambiguous. And Waller's actress on Arrow was just working on another show but they have stated a lot of times that they want her to do a lot on the show.   The funniest part about this to me is the first time I heard someone say that they were killing off show characters for the movies.  Was right after they announced an actor for Hugo Strange for television and movies in the same week."

I was trying to say that there would be confusion amongst the viewers if they did that, and everyone was trying to tell me that I was stupid for thinking that.  Well, it looks like I'm not the only stupid person in the world after all, now, doesn't it? Looks like the studio heads agree with me! Take that, internet!"
DC_Cinematic,3e0l2o,mrthewhite,0,Tue Jul 21 14:46:31 2015 UTC,"not only that, but because DC won't come out and say whether they're going to continue restrict characters to either movie or TV it's causing a lot more confusion because people don't know what characters are even eligible to be introduced into the TV shows.  And for that matter neither do the TV producers.  Harley Quinn was teased in Season 2 of Arrow with the producers planning to introduce her in Season 3 but had to rework the story lines after being told they couldn't use her.  So if the writers don't know who's a movie character and who's a TV character, how are the fans supposed to figure it out.  Also, if you've seen the Supergirl pilot you'll notice that they silhouette superman in one scene but they go to great lengths to never actually say his name.  i think this is because they're not actually allowed to use the Superman character in the show but managed to get permission to make vague references to him in order to make the story make sense."

It kind of would have been an awesome idea for all the TV characters to have been Golden Age. All the TV shows would be period-pieces set in the 30's and 40's (think Mad Men style) in the same universe. Kind of like the TV shows are live-action Earth 2 (and they can be a little campy in a classic, self-aware way, like everything was back in the 30's/40's) and the Movies are live-action Earth 0.  Then you'd be open for an actual Crisis event where the two generations meet and everything changes. You could even make the Crisis into a series of movies that tie into the TV shows. The movies affect the TV characters and visa-versa."

Shazam/Black Adam, and the Wonder Twins films are both going to be separate from the Justice League/Suicide Squad universe it seems.  There could be a couple of reasons for this. DC sees how the conflicting tone of such stories (the darker more ""realistic"" tone that the JL/SS films are taking, and the lighter/family friendly tone that the latter films seem to be heading) would be awkward to mash together and they could also see how the Marvel films are starting to become cluttered since Phase 3 starting kicking into high gear introducing even MORE characters to the MCU (Ant Man, Dr. Strange, Black Panther, Spider Man, etc)."

And I doubt WB would want to leave anything to chance when it's one of the 2 movies that are jump starting their multi billion dollar extended universe."
DC_Cinematic,3dzkcp,Rawhoth,3,Tue Jul 21 00:39:54 2015 UTC,They certainly wouldn't introduce the I-Ching plot point. Slade would just be younger because that happens to be his age in the DCEU.

DC_Cinematic,3dzkry,huskman,3,Mon Jul 20 20:27:44 2015 UTC,"1.Wayne Financial got wrecked. Is there any chance Lucius Fox was in the building and got killed?   I thought about this one as well.A.) It is possible that he died in the building. B.) Considering Bruce's age in this, there is a chance he may be dead by this point, before the Man Of Steel events. C.) They will not even mention Lucius, since he was in The Dark Knights series, and will avoid confusion for the general audience.   2.That one guy with a bat symbol embedded into his skin seems a bit off. Batman just beat the dude up, left a batarang there to show it was him, but then says ""how bout I pressed a batarang deep into the guy?"" It seems off to me. Perhaps he is much more violent in this incarnation.   I am thinking this is one of Batman's first take downs since he has returned. The mark is to let the officers know that The Batman is back. I doubt the markings is a on going thing with Bats.   3.Clark does look different from Superman. His posturing, the way he does his hair, and how he speaks. I feel the superhero alternate identity here works because he's acting differently. Not just because of glasses.   This has always been a thing,it's never just been the glasses. His posture, clumsiness,eye sight all have to do with his Clark Kent Daily Planet persona.    6.That plane we see is that really the Bat Plane? Could it be Hal Jordan? Dan Amboyer has been linked to this movie for awhile as a drone pilot. Perhaps that's him.   Not Bat Plant , but Bat-Jet.As seen at San Diego Comic Con - http://media.comicbook.com/uploads1/2015/07/batman-v-superman-mattel-toys-sdcc-8--143293.JPG  Edit:Bat-plant ...sure"

DC_Cinematic,3dzkry,bats7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:15:53 2015 UTC,"A good chance, yes Maybe Batman just likes to brand criminals so he knows which of them he's encountered before. Or maybe it was a form of torture. The end of MoS did imply for me that the disguise does not work - but no one at the Planet other than Lois has seen Superman up close. Or this. That could very well be. As to where it is - I have no idea. It might not even matter, as it's primarily used as an element in the subplot involving Superman's identity struggle. The Wayne's were just about the richest family in Gotham. It could very well be a planned robbery/killing. It's the BatJet. I myself have speculated that it's Wonder Woman's jet but toys shown off at Comic-Con reveal it to be Batman's. Link. I think it's the Lexcorp lobby - there was somewhat of a report a while ago that indicated the Lexcorp lobby has a basketball court, and we do see a basketball there. It could very well be Barry Allen, as a nice little cameo in the movie, but it could also be Lex himself."

DC_Cinematic,3dvuxi,whitemithrandir,7,Mon Jul 20 02:19:03 2015 UTC,"This (and the documentary it comes from) is a great insight into just how poorly most of the Warner Bros. execs understand the character of Superman. Burton was/is too caught up in projecting his alternative, creepy, ""I'm an outsider weirdo"" vibe onto Clark. Peters and most of the people in charge of the art and design of the movie seem to think of the character, and Krypton, as belonging to the same world as Aliens. Why, for example, would Krypton have enough monsters for Brainiac to build a menagerie from?!  I do think that Cage would've bought an interesting take on the character, though he'd be severely limited by the aforementioned buffoons who don't understand Superman. All in all, DOSLWH made me a hell of a lot more appreciative of Zack Snyder and the fact that he gets Superman. All he's done is take the character on a different journey to get to the same destination, not turn him into a character that is against the fundamental defining traits of who Superman is."
DC_Cinematic,3dvuxi,Daniel_Arshad,3,Mon Jul 20 06:30:22 2015 UTC,"Burton's just to camp to do live action comic movies, not from this time period. In the 60s he'd have been viewed as the height of greatness."
DC_Cinematic,3dvuxi,NothappyJane,5,Mon Jul 20 06:44:19 2015 UTC,"Precisely. He struck gold with Batman, probably due to not having full creative control. Comparing that with Batman Returns, where he had complete control, it's hilarious to see just how Burton butchered the franchise up."
DC_Cinematic,3dvuxi,Daniel_Arshad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:47:00 2015 UTC,"Why didn't you like Returns?  I thought it was a pretty interesting film and, honestly, probably better than the first movie.  When I think about it, I really think it was the best Batman movie until Nolan came along and rewrote what a comic book based movie could achieve."
DC_Cinematic,3dvuxi,roboticbrady,2,Mon Jul 20 15:21:21 2015 UTC,"I think my dislike for it stems from the same reason as my dislike for TDK and TDKR: it's a sequel that doesn't build upon the character of Batman, despite setting up a wonderful world at the end of the first film. Whereas Batman 1989 is chock full of moments that make me go, ""Wow, that's fucking Batman."", Returns, save for, ""Shut up, you're going to jail."" doesn't ever seem to have that same focus on the titular character.  Moreover, it just seems to be pushing the envelope of being weird and creepy, not in a way that enhances the film, but rather detracts from it. Burton's take on the Penguin would be laughably cheesy, if it wasn't injected with so much of the odd, replusiveness that the director is obsessed with. ""Naked sexual charisma!?"", eating off a random person's nose, being a literal man-beast who's raised by penguins? Ugh.   I will say that, despite the script being much more limiting in helping to pull the vibe off, Michael Keaton still manages to do his best and turn in a better Batman than any other incarnation of the character, save for his first time playing the role, and for Bale's portrayal in Begins. Keaton was truly the reason Batman was a successful movie, in my opinion. He just got Batman in a way that Burton never did. In fact, I don't think Burton has it in his to fully understand any hero. He's great with the sickest and most demented villains, ones who can properly embody the projection of being a creep that he loves to cast onto his characters, but Batman, let alone Superman, aren't those characters."
DC_Cinematic,3dvuxi,Daniel_Arshad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:53:00 2015 UTC,"See, I loved Keaton but, when I look back on it, I don't think he was a good Bruce Wayne at all. I don't recall Bruce Wayne ever being a forgetful clumsy idiot like he was in 1989s version. Being entirely blown away by a woman and putting his champagne glass on the edge of a craps table and sticking his pen in a plant.   While the next part is entirely related to the script and not a personality trait from the actor, batman kills dozens of people when he drops BOMBS in the Ace chemical factory because he thinks the joker might be there. Perhaps this was a call back to the first few detective stories where he did indeed kill a few people, but I highly doubt it.   I entirely agree that Burton was a very odd choice for the role. Batman is a weird character and you would think he'd delve into that a little more than he did. Instead he was far more interested in looking at the villains. I did appreciate Returns shout out that you don't have to be ugly on the outside to be a monster though. Catwoman batman shrek and penguin were all broken freaks.   It's all personal opinion, but I don't know if anyone will top Bale in my mind. He played Bruce Wayne and batman perfectly. A guy who sees himself as Bruce Wayne only because he has to be, but is really is approaching his unavoidable fatalistic conclusion that his quest for revenge will ultimately lead him to."
DC_Cinematic,3dvuxi,roboticbrady,2,Tue Jul 21 14:29:50 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I think that was all meant to be an act that Keaton envisioned Bruce to put on for the masses. Where he truly shined was not as Bruce Wayne, however, but as Batman. His presence when in costume was just so incredible. The script in both movies was flawed, yes, but Keaton managed to do good despite it all. Again, Burton is just so much of a weirdo and outcast in real life that he just cannot grasp how a hero is supposed to behave.  Bale, again, was fantastic in Begins. He got barely anything from the script in TDK to build off of, and more of the same in TDKR. By the time he fakes his death and decides to retire, leaving behind the mantle of the Batman for an inexperienced cop, he was as far from being Batman as can be."
DC_Cinematic,3dvuxi,Daniel_Arshad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:35:42 2015 UTC,"Because we are on the internet I want to make it clear I'm not trying to change your opinion at all, I actually find it an interesting discussion. :)  I agree that Keaton managed to do something with very little in his movies.  For whatever reason, Burton decided Batman was the straight arrow that the villains would play off of and, as a result, gave him very little to actually work with.  I'm sure you are right that Burton has an almost inability to relate to a 'heroic' person.    That being said, the clumsy aspect of the character never appeared to be an act.  He even made it incredibly awkward with his whole interaction with Alfred regarding Gordon leaving his party early.  Like Bruce Wayne would REALLY be that confused as to why his one confidant would be telling him the commissioner of the police force had to leave his party for any other reason?  I actually loved Bale in Begins and TDK (I found TDKR a very odd film that seemed far too rushed).  He is a guy who is conflicted with feeling he needs to quit being Batman in order to have any semblance of the real life his parents would have wanted for him and yet being unable to quit because he needs to see the Batman role to it's inevitable conclusion (sacrifice).  In the end, Batman is an interesting character because he can be interpreted so many different ways.  I'm looking forward to what they do with Affleck."
DC_Cinematic,3dvuxi,roboticbrady,6,Tue Jul 21 15:10:23 2015 UTC,"I saw the documentary and it looked like this film was on a way track to be pure shite.  Burton's vision was just stupid.

DC_Cinematic,3dyyof,Jkbdm,8,Mon Jul 20 17:52:03 2015 UTC,"A lot of my ""no idea about comics"" friends are seemingly excited for it, so I think it has a broader appeal than a lot of the typical superhero films. With a talented cast and a big roster of characters they have a greater chance of hooking someone who may otherwise not care. Some people are tired of Batman, think Superman is lame, or whatever, so this movie appeals to them more. As much flak as DC is getting for it, I also believe that the ""grimdark"" ""hot topic"" look of this movie is earning it some fans. Sure some people think it's too much or ""try hard"" but there's also a large group of people who believe that Marvel movies are shallow and for kids, who welcome a more serious or scary comic universe."
DC_Cinematic,3dyyof,grntplmr,2,Mon Jul 20 18:32:44 2015 UTC,A few friends of mine are more excited for BvS then Suicide Squad. They are kind of fanboys when it comes to people like Superman and Batman. It gets to the point where I kind of got bashed on by their knowledge of how epic superman and batman are for saying that the Suicide Squad could possibly make more money then BvS.
DC_Cinematic,3dyyof,kingfish101,4,Mon Jul 20 18:42:38 2015 UTC,"The box offive numbers will be interesting to see once both movies have been out for a while, because I know the sheer spectacle of getting Batman and Superman on screen together is unprecedented for DC fans, but SS does have that mass appeal that heist/ensemble movies tend to carry. Personally I think Batman has enough fans that will carry over from the Nolan movies that it may sway the outcome in that direction (not that it's a competition of course) but I don't think you're wrong in believing that SS will probably have a surprising take when all is said and done.   I think the release dates will also play an interesting role in all of it, because you have to wonder if BvS will leave people wanting more of the DC universe, or if audiences will feel like ""how can you beat that"" and possibly pass on SS.   I am admittedly a fan of the MCU, and certain properties more than others, but SS and BvS are absolutely my most anticipated movies of next year. I'm really hoping that DC can catch a break from all the haters by offering something different from Marvel's formula and tone."

Their Joker isn't a 40s style gangster dropped in a vat of chemicals, he's more like a real modern day gangster, adorned with tattoos and piercings. They don't treat Enchantress like magic is all-around in this universe, the trailer gives the implication that she's a rare case of true paranormal activity."
DC_Cinematic,3dyely,whatudontlikefalafel,2,Tue Jul 21 00:56:38 2015 UTC,"I think it may be too early to judge the tone, especially based on a trailer that was only meant to be seen at Comic-Con, by an audience who was already going to love whatever they showed. If that teaser hadn't leaked I bet the first trailer the public saw would have been more upbeat and crazy, which is what I personally expect from the movie."

Well I feel like he's talking about how playing hero gets people killed. How even he had that go through that, and that sooner or later things will go awry with Superman.  Furthermore, I don't think Superman needs all that much incentive to fight Batman, as Batman is actually after him. ""I'm going to have to destroy him,"" he says in the trailer. The title of the movie even implies that Batman is the one who initiates the fight between the two."
DC_Cinematic,3dyc9m,TheLittlePhoenix,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:41:39 2015 UTC,Yeah. I agree with all of that. I'm simply looking at it from a different angle. I want to market movie to make money. I know I'll market Batman vs Superman. I want to have huge surprise twist though so that everyone comes and sees this. I'll make the trailer lead the viewer to think one thing but I'll actually have the movie be about another.

Maybe something appears in the sky; we can see her looking up, after all."
DC_Cinematic,3dwkr0,TheLittlePhoenix,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:31:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe some genius among the protesters has a concealed weapon and opens fire on Superman when he lands? It's not hard to imagine someone (who doesn't know the full extent of Clark's powers) deciding to take matters into their own hands, especially considering all the gun violence we've been seeing in the news in the past few years. Of course the gunfire won't do anything to Supes, but naturally people are going to be scared. Just a thought."
DC_Cinematic,3dwkr0,sithmudblood,0,Mon Jul 20 07:04:26 2015 UTC,That leaked plot said that Batmans 'signal jammer' or something causes superman to lose control of his powers = destruction. I still dont believe its right but that one reaction shot of Lois gave a fair bit of credence to it imo.
DC_Cinematic,3dwkr0,BarbequeMeat,3,Mon Jul 20 13:18:15 2015 UTC,"Hope not, sounds kind of irresponsible of Batman to cause Superman to lose control in front of all those innocent people."

DC_Cinematic,3dvc3i,TheJoshider10,3,Mon Jul 20 07:31:51 2015 UTC,They got a lot of slack for that middle thumbnail.
DC_Cinematic,3dvc3i,TronVin,11,Mon Jul 20 07:33:37 2015 UTC,"First of all, BvS still has more views on other platforms and generated about 2 times the tweets than Suicide Squad. BvS was number one trend in the world with over 650k tweets. About 100k more than Serena Williams winning Wimbledon. Suicide Squad had around 350k tweets. Other countries have other ways to view trailers.   Let's talk about why SS has more views that BvS on YouTube:  1) The initial hype form BvS and SDCC help. If the trailer was released by itself and away from an event, it would be a lot smaller. But the hype carried over.   2) The thumbnail was cooler.   3) Generally, first trailers do better than second trailers. Have no clue why.  Some things that aren't factored into viewer numbers are multiple people watching one screen. I'll bet more people watched the BvS together than SS.   Also, trailer views don't really matter. Man of Steel had more trailer views than any of the Guardians of the Galaxy and even some Avengers 2 trailers. The five minute Flash TV show trailer has 28 million views, more than most Guardian of the Galaxy trailers.   There is no correlation between trailer views and overall attendance/hype. Hell, I'll guarantee the first Deadpool trailer gets more views than both trailers but that doesn't mean Deadpool will be bigger than BvS."
DC_Cinematic,3dvc3i,IAmLuckyDuckling,11,Sun Jul 19 22:09:26 2015 UTC,"Probably because it wasn't released right up front.  Scarcity breeds value. When anybody could go onto YouTube and look at the BvS trailer, but the SS trailer was secret. Illicit. People got excited.  Then Warner released it and people went bananas."
DC_Cinematic,3dvc3i,ezrs158,-2,Sun Jul 19 21:20:18 2015 UTC,"They also were serving copyright notices and vigorously trying to take the ""stolen"" footage down. It's like they don't understand what free marketing is."
DC_Cinematic,3dvc3i,IAmLuckyDuckling,5,Sun Jul 19 21:54:15 2015 UTC,"They understand, but they wanted it to be on their terms.  It was a catch-22 for them.  Show something at SDCC, it probably gets leaked before it's 100% ready (we're still 13 monhs out from release, its absurdly early for a trailer).  Don't show something and interest might fade/they get accused of holding out.  Best option would have been something like what Star Wars did, behind the scenes vid that builds hype without being an incomplete product from their film."

DC_Cinematic,3dvc3i,rustedmachines,2,Sun Jul 19 21:25:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's because Squad is different/new/totally unexpected. Everybody and their mother know who Batman and Superman are so it's to be expected that BvS would pull in viewers. As for Suicide Squad, I think it's the new-ness of it (bad guys as protagonists), the actors and characters involved (Will Smith, Harley Quinn, Joker), and the tone of the movie.  Audiences are getting a glance at a non-Marvel cinematic universe that doesn't have 8 years of films behind it and offers something different, something meatier."
DC_Cinematic,3dvc3i,akfourty7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:36:57 2015 UTC,"Commented on another thread about this, reposting here.   Suicide Squad isn't your typical superhero movie. With a saturated superhero genre (TV and film) I think it being different is what's attracting the attention. Most casual movie fans didn't even know the suicide squad was a thing. So it's something new and different for many people, hence the extra views and hype."

DC_Cinematic,3dupx9,lionheart4k,0,Sun Jul 19 17:53:37 2015 UTC,the concept of Bizarro doesn't feel right for this CU. I hope it's a take on Doomsday that is more like Bizarro; a bio engineered monstrous version of Superman.

DC_Cinematic,3dupx9,Gerry-Mandarin,4,Sun Jul 19 21:14:37 2015 UTC,use a Doomsday inspired look; not a weird looking dude in a backwards costume.
DC_Cinematic,3dupx9,BaronVonStevie,7,Sun Jul 19 21:15:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the character is still Bizarro. It's like saying:   I don't think Mr Mxyptlk would work in this world. How about instead of being from the 5th Dimension, he's just from another planet. Instead of wearing a purple and yellow three piece suit, he wears a purple and yellow uniform. Instead of just being able to do anything he has a weapon that can mess with peoples minds. Maybe show them their innermost desires or something.  Because then we have Mongul, with Mxyptlk's name. Just do Mongul.  Bizarro doesn't have to wear backwards clothing. He doesn't have to have backwards speech. The best Bizarro story is about a character who has none of that."
DC_Cinematic,3dupx9,Gerry-Mandarin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:52:48 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying it's easier to link him to Luthor's efforts and, hence, hook him up with powers like Superman than to go through the effort to explain away a deadly monster from ancient Krypton. They're not doing Bizarro here. They're doing Doomsday with a cleaner explanation that fits with the rest of the movie; an explanation that is inspired by the post crisis Bizarro."
DC_Cinematic,3dupx9,BaronVonStevie,3,Sun Jul 19 22:24:50 2015 UTC,"They're not doing Bizarro here.   Yes they would be. He'd just have the wrong name.  If Two-Face was born by falling in a vat of acid, after being coerced to commit a crime by Sal Maroni, and Two-Face actually had a personality that cracked jokes, he's not Two-Face. He's the Joker."
DC_Cinematic,3dupx9,Gerry-Mandarin,-1,Sun Jul 19 22:34:43 2015 UTC,"That's not Bizarro. Bizarro is comedic, and from the Bizarro universe, which is home to Bizarro versions of all the DC Characters."

No. Earth-29 Bizarro is from Earth-29.  Earth-0 Bizarro is a scientific experiment. He's not ""comedic"" because he doesn't really speak."
DC_Cinematic,3dupx9,Gerry-Mandarin,0,Sun Jul 19 23:15:30 2015 UTC,Interesting. I could see how they could combine the two ideas then. Use Zod's DNA to create a Doomsday like character that is more human-like.

Also, why would Lex Luthor call something Doomsday? You'd think the would-be saviour of humanity would choose something a little less... apocalyptic."
DC_Cinematic,3dupx9,Gerry-Mandarin,0,Sun Jul 19 23:32:36 2015 UTC,"None of the reviews said that Lex called it anything. The reviewer just said ""The group fights the doomsday creature."""

DC_Cinematic,3dupx9,Gerry-Mandarin,0,Sun Jul 19 23:47:25 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere that the idea was that all of the soldier classes of Krypton had a Doomsday Gene programmed into them that allows them to transform into a Doomsday creature.

I think it's more because he is facing resistance across the world, and the Batman is going after him, than it being a clue to a Bizarro.  I have speculated myself though that Luthor might be creating some kind of Bizarro-like being with Zod's dead body in BvS. Though I do not think they would have the main draw of the movie turn out to actually be a fight between Batman and Bizarro. Can you imagine the outcry that would occur?"
DC_Cinematic,3dupx9,TheLittlePhoenix,2,Sun Jul 19 17:47:07 2015 UTC,I think that was Perry White saying that line.
DC_Cinematic,3dupx9,Mordkay,3,Mon Jul 20 07:17:27 2015 UTC,It really sounds like Henry Cavill to me. I re-watched Man of Steel very recently and it sounds exactly like him.

DC_Cinematic,3dupx9,Mudkip4567,4,Sun Jul 19 19:05:16 2015 UTC,"I agree about the redundancy, but it would also help show the world (and audiences) that superman has learnt from the events of MOS as he takes the fight to an isolated area.    It will address the fact that he is better prepared than he was in MoS, and show he was simply doing what he could during the MoS battle to stop the threat.   A fair argument can be made that the destruction and death in MOS was avoidable, but the counter argument is that superman had been superman for 15 minutes at that stage.  He wasn't perfect. He could have done better had he been prepared, but he wasn't, yet.   A fight with another super powered villain in BvS will help show the hero that he is.   It will also show batman, wonder woman and any other hero that there are major threats that they can help resolve quicker if they work together."

DC_Cinematic,3du2r4,Justice_Prince,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:51:54 2015 UTC,"If you look at it from the mass audience's perspective, though, Superman is the one who flies. That's what he does, that's what embodies him. It's even in the tagline of the first Superman with Christopher Reeve: ""You'll believe a man can fly."" If you ask a random person what Superman's powers are, 'flying' will be the most likely answer you're going to get.  In short, Superman in the public image is the superhero who flies. Giving Wonder Woman the power of flight might make him less... unique to people? I mean, certainly not to me, but I'm looking at it from a layman's perspective here. Give Wonder Woman all of her other cool stuff. That's likely what they're going to do."
DC_Cinematic,3du2r4,TheLittlePhoenix,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:24:08 2015 UTC,"Why would we need to go out of our way to make Superman more special?  He's already one of the most well known superheroes on the planet.   They need to focus on building up heroes like Wonder Woman,  and they going to do that by taking away powers from her."
DC_Cinematic,3du2r4,Justice_Prince,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:42:27 2015 UTC,"Not ""more"" special. It's about having each hero be unique in their own right. Wonder Woman can be made unique without her having to fly."
DC_Cinematic,3du2r4,TheLittlePhoenix,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:48:57 2015 UTC,but taking away her abilty to fly doesnt make her more unique.  if anything it just makes her more like aquaman.  really they best way to highlight the difference between Superman and Wonder Woman is to show that his flight is a feat of stregth where as hers is a feat of skill. He forces his way through the sky where as she moves in harmony though it.
DC_Cinematic,3du2r4,Justice_Prince,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:19:38 2015 UTC,"That could work. But still, I think that without flight Wonder Woman could be made unique and still separate from Aquaman."
DC_Cinematic,3du2r4,TheLittlePhoenix,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:35:25 2015 UTC,I'd like it if she got it from Hermes or Hephaestus in her own movie.  Isn't that how Azarello did it?
DC_Cinematic,3du2r4,Jordoom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:36:51 2015 UTC,I'd rather she just be able to fly.  I saw making Hermes blessing the only one that was still canon as Azarello's way of rubbing salt in the wound after screwing up Diana's origin.
DC_Cinematic,3du2r4,Justice_Prince,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:04:01 2015 UTC,"I think it's easier to get the point of her having the speed of hermes if she can run very fast instead of fly. To most people ""hermes = run"" not ""fly""."
DC_Cinematic,3du2r4,BaronVonStevie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:35:06 2015 UTC,"Could be, but if you then follow the logic I've been using in my other comments here it would make her a bit like the Flash in a way."

DC_Cinematic,3dy32q,speculumfight,9,Mon Jul 20 14:02:02 2015 UTC,"this article sucks balls. the author is making some huge and baseless claims. apparently everyone is turned off by DC's tone and are reacting negatively to the upcoming films, which is odd because as of late i've mostly seen people getting amped and the positive outweighing the negative. whatever though"
DC_Cinematic,3dy32q,hustlesimmons,16,Mon Jul 20 16:39:59 2015 UTC,"Ironically, it’s the “cornier” DC that’s embracing the dark side with it’s grim and gritty film slate, while the “cooler, edgier” Marvel is laughing all the way to the bank, with its brighter, cheerful family popcorn flicks.  The ‘Suicide Squad’ trailer in particular felt plodding and overly dramatic with its booming intense musical score.   My goodness. Its ok if you dont like it but dont go saying some bullshit. ""Cornier"" dc? between marvel and dc dc are the cornier ones??  I like both dc and marvel though i prefer dc more: I like their heroes more and their villains leave a lasting impression and allround i prefer the more serious hero films, if you dont like it dont watch it.   Now?  We’re stuck in a depression.  Jobs are elusive.  People are making less money, yet prices on everything are skyrocketing.  The reason super heroes became successful in the 1930s was they also arrived during a depression, when people wanted optimistic escapism.  And what is Marvel providing?  Just that.  How is it working for them?  Well, they seem free to print their own money.   Guys, i suggest you dont read the article if you havent already read it. Its quite annoying."

If DC was making slapstick comedies then he'd be complaining that they aren't dark enough.  The article is disingenously trying to create a perception that there's a backlash because DC actually takes its stories and characters seriously.  If any such backlash exists I haven't  seen much of it.  Pretty much everyone seems to be Uber excited about next summer.

That's ok though, Seth McFarlane kind of sucks. I mean everything he makes is like Family Guy, which would be great if not for the fact there were like 10 seasons of FG and then another 5 or 10 of American Dad and Cleveland Show.   And what's wrong with DC's movies being so serious? Marvel's films are starting to wear thin, there is literally nothing at stake and the heroes are bulletproof. The only hero to die so far did so in his first movie with no attachment, no build up. Come and gone. The heroes always win, even in Infinity War they're going to win. Sure, Thanos might end up winning part 1 but he's not going to win part 2. And all those cringy jokes."

No such thing as bad publicity and all that.  Since the day they revealed The Joker photo, no day has passed where people haven't talked about the design.

DC_Cinematic,3drn84,TronVin,4,Sun Jul 19 17:57:14 2015 UTC,"Ditto, hopefully they'll be able to use his script!   Sam Mendes might be an interesting choice to direct JLD. He's got the blockbuster/genre chops with the Bond films, a killer visual style (he picks amazing cinematographers), and he's a Brit, so he'll ""get"" the humor and attitude that comes with a film featuring John ""Hellblazer"" Constantine.  Or hell, even Fincher could pull this off I think. His style could fit a a dark noir supernatural detective story quite well."

I think you fell into the fan-casting trap of just picking an actor based on hair color.  Also, in my view, you suffer from too many characters. Black Mask, Talia Al Ghul, Barbra Gordon, Riddler, Dick Grayson, Jason Todd. Remember, this isn't a comic book, where the audience is assumed to know who all these people are. It's a film, where the characters need to be fleshed out individually, and their relationship to the protagonist needs to be clearly explained.

DC_Cinematic,3dsj36,JsNorte,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:53:28 2015 UTC,what if that's the role he was talking about?
DC_Cinematic,3dsj36,william2181,6,Sun Jul 19 02:27:23 2015 UTC,Could be. He said the DC thing he was working on was like Ocean's 11. I could see the JLD having a similar dynamic.
DC_Cinematic,3dsj36,Jangwin,2,Sun Jul 19 03:33:31 2015 UTC,"He said it wasn't a film, though. He said it was something under everyone's noses that nobody had thought of yet. Pretty sure everyone's talking about the possibility of JLD."

DC_Cinematic,3dsleh,letsgetweirdkbye,-3,Sun Jul 19 01:36:58 2015 UTC,"I know.....  But yeah, I guess it's too early to tell, obviously there will most likely be a linear narrative throughout the films, that may tie most of them together, but the greater focus seems to be on the individual story rather than setting up another movie, if that makes sense? 'cinematic universes' don't really interest me because I feel like there would be a lot of storytelling sacrificed. I personally would much rather have the Dark Knight trilogy than a phase of Marvel movies, you know?  Like, what happens when an actor in the Marvel movies gets too old? Do they replace him with a younger actor and expect everybody to be cool about it, or are we supposed to just let go the idea of ever seeing Steve Rodgers as Captain America in a live action capacity for another 30 years or so?  Thank you for your time. Peace & love."
DC_Cinematic,3dsleh,KomodoEmiko,0,Sun Jul 19 12:12:51 2015 UTC,Why did that get marked down ? hahah
DC_Cinematic,3dsleh,KomodoEmiko,15,Mon Jul 20 03:50:27 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, they're primarily setting up the Trinity first, then introducing the concept of the League, and then doing origin stories for the other Leaguers. The latter thing they're doing is not unlike the New 52 where the first book to come to out was Justice League. Then later they gave us new books for the rest of the characters.  The story thus far, Superman is revealed to the world in Man of Steel, and the ramifications of that film are that the world is forever changed/hopeful/scared. So naturally the next thing to address is, is Superman a threat to us? And once you ask that question, enter the one man who could beat him: Batman. And having Superman/Batman crossover is something I feel like you've gotta do for either character eventually. It feels natural.  Ah, but Bats isn't the only person fidgeting on Earth. Themysicra and Atlantis exist, even though they're hidden. The Invasion of Metropolis is the single event that changes all of that. Waller in the Suicide Squad trailer even talks about Superman perhaps being a beacon that lures all the strangest beings out of hiding, because now everything is different.  Enter Wonder Woman, representing Themyscira who most certainly are concerned about the safety of the planet after Zod's attack. And Aquaman and Atlantis meanwhile want to know why the hell there was a powerful weapon firing gravity pulses into his Indian Ocean. So we get them next in Batman v Superman, not because they're just randomly throwing out Leaguers to catch up to Marvel, but because those are two very powerful hidden societies on Earth that would most likely come out of hiding after such an attack.  Additionally, we now have Wonder Woman showing up right after Supes and Bats. The Trinity is formed.  So what about the rest of the League? Green Lantern Flash, and Cyborg? Well we know Cyborg is in BvS and Justice League, and in the New 52 JL his origin happens when the League is formed. But GL and Flash I imagine they're willing to hold off on until after the League comes together. They're essential to have on the team, but their own origins aren't in any way essential to the existence of the other members, and additionally we already know them. We don't need to really see GL and Flash movies before a League movie like Marvel might do, because whereas Iron Man, Cap, Thor, and Hulk are all tied together in origins and build up to the first Avengers movie, the various Leaguers' origins have already been far more separate from each other.  And with Flash, TV audiences already know enough about him thanks to the show, and casual fans need only know that he runs fast in order to under the League movie. For GL, the movie explained Hal Jordan well enough even if it's no longer canon. Also they've the new GL Corp movie last to put as much distance between the first movie and the reboot. To have a clean break in continuity, and so that people will forget the first movie.  Going back to Suicide Squad movie, I feel like they're doing that half as a semi-reaction to various super people coming out of the shadows like Waller mentioned, but also because they're not going to be doing a Batman movie for a while, so this helps set up Joker and Harley. And we don't need a full blown Batman movie for a while when The Dark Knight Trilogy just happened.  The way I see it, the slate of DCEU movies does have a logic to it. It's not the same way Marvel would do it, but I see the reasons behind everything: build Superman, then the Trinity, then the League, then do origins.  And to answer your question, will there be one big story built up across all the films like Marvel's Infinity War? Hard to say. It's possible, though I get the impression that some films won't build towards that at all. With Marvel, there's an almost linear progression, where everything is gearing towards Thanos. With DC, while they may have a bigger Darkseid plot let's say, I think they're most interesting in going in a branching direction rather than a linear one. They want to build a DCEU that will not only be there for big League stories that unite everyone, but will also have room for stories that aren't part of any big plan. It's probably less about an end goal, and more about building a sandbox for many talented writers and directors to play around in with DC characters. Again look to the New 52 where the Justice League origin introduces everyone, and their solo books tell other stories. Actually it's a lot like the DC Showcase comics. The Justice League movie could be seen like that. Introducing a whole bunch of characters to the audience that they don't know well and then saying ""Wanna know more? Catch their solo films."""
DC_Cinematic,3dsleh,Aitrus233,7,Sun Jul 19 03:54:15 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty smart move for DC's part, world build using the big team-up movies first and then dive into the smaller stories. Excited to see where the DCEU goes from Batman v Superman!"
DC_Cinematic,3dsleh,baribigbird06,2,Sun Jul 19 09:38:11 2015 UTC,"Indeed. And in thinking of all of this, I also noticed that the DCAU had a similar strategy. They started with Batman, then Superman, and then for the most part Justice League. Yes, there was Batman Beyond, but that's just more Batman. Static Shock wasn't even originally part of the DCAU. And the most you saw of Flash and GL was one-off Superman episodes. They trusted that the Justice League show was enough to expose people to the whole DCU, once the World's Finest were established."
DC_Cinematic,3dsleh,Aitrus233,2,Sun Jul 19 09:41:27 2015 UTC,"Oh wow I hadn't noticed that but you're absolutely right! I'd like to also add that although the Nolan trilogy is not part of the DCEU, Warner probably wouldn't have invested in Man of Steel if those films weren't the massive successes they were. In that sense, the Nolan Trilogy is fitting analog for Batman: TAS whose success led to Superman: TAS which eventually expanded into the DCAU."
DC_Cinematic,3dsleh,baribigbird06,2,Sun Jul 19 09:58:01 2015 UTC,"Holy.... You're right. We've got Batman TAS, then Superman TAS, which has a Batman crossover episode. Meanwhile in films, there's the Nolan films whose success lead to a Superman film which leads to Batman v Superman."
DC_Cinematic,3dsleh,Aitrus233,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:20:15 2015 UTC,Too bad we don't have an analog for Static Shock haha
DC_Cinematic,3dsleh,baribigbird06,16,Mon Jul 20 09:04:39 2015 UTC,"Marvel's ""Phases"" are just a marketing term, and doesn't even apply to their wider, televisual efforts.  DC Warner is making films in a shared Universe. They're trying to make quality films first and foremost."
DC_Cinematic,3dsleh,IAmLuckyDuckling,4,Sun Jul 19 02:02:26 2015 UTC,"I'm excited to see DC break away from the Phase structure. While Marvel had a lot of time without any real viable competing comic book movie franchises, DC has to come out swinging and no better way to do it than by putting the two most iconic comic book heroes together in one movie and take it up a notch into the most anticipated coming together of heroes of all time.  Btw, it's interesting to note that the whole 'phase 1, 2, 3' was first coined by fandom and Marvel just ran with it. Phase 1 was definitely more cohesive collectively in building up to the big team up than phase 2 was."
DC_Cinematic,3dsleh,baribigbird06,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:46:19 2015 UTC,Ahem. They are also including WW. They are introducing the Trinity. Super stoked and completely agree about this phase 1 and 2 bullshit.
DC_Cinematic,3dsleh,infamousLOUIS,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:02:18 2015 UTC,The tv shows are a part of the phases too.
DC_Cinematic,3dsleh,Inspace96,8,Sun Jul 19 02:04:55 2015 UTC,"Are they? Ant-Man ends Phase 2, and Civil War starts Phase 3. Agents of SHIELD season 3 and AKA Jessica Jones (and probably Daredevil Season 2) all premier before that. Which Phase are they in?  Also, not even all the films set in the MCU are designated as being part of the Phases.   Marvel's own Agent M has said that while the new Spider-Man film takes place during Phase 3, it isn't a part of it.  The Phases are marketing. A way to make certain things feel more important or drum up more interest. Build hype."
DC_Cinematic,3dsleh,IAmLuckyDuckling,4,Sun Jul 19 02:14:49 2015 UTC,"Agents of Shield season 1 and 2 and Daredevil are Phase 2.  Techincally Agent Carter is phase 2 by placement but I would put it in phase 1 thematically.  Also all of the phase 2 properties theres a running joke where someones hand/arm gets cut off as a reference to Empire Strikes Back.  Agents of Shield season 3, AKA Jessica Jones and Daredevil Season 2 is Phase 3 since Ant-Man is the epilogue to Phase 2 and Agents of Shield will tie in to Civil War eventually.  Yes the Phases are a part of marketing but they are also used by the fans to designate and organize the massive universe."
DC_Cinematic,3dsleh,Inspace96,3,Sun Jul 19 02:49:04 2015 UTC,"That's all just fans trying to fit them into a phase.  Maybe you could fit AoS into a the phases, but from what I've seen Marvel seems to be treating the Netflix series as their own set of phases"
DC_Cinematic,3dsleh,Justice_Prince,3,Sun Jul 19 06:38:45 2015 UTC,"Feige has said every property in Phase 2 a hand/arm is loss, this happens in Daredevil episode 7.  A phase builds up to a certain event or deals with the aftermath of the previous one. All phase 2 properties deal with the aftermath of the Battle of NY and the fall of Shield. Daredevils events rely on the Battle of NY greatly."
DC_Cinematic,3dsleh,Inspace96,0,Sun Jul 19 06:47:12 2015 UTC,I thought Civil War kicked off Phase 3 and those two TV show seasons were like the Prologue.
DC_Cinematic,3dsleh,TripleSkeet,2,Sun Jul 19 05:02:53 2015 UTC,"Civil War is the official start of phase 3 but we will see themes and hints in the tv shows leading to the film.  Agents of Shield will deal with new inhumans popping up in the world, Secret Warriors, and will tie in with Civil War. So it kinda starts Phase 3 in a way."
DC_Cinematic,3dsleh,Inspace96,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:07:30 2015 UTC,Phase 2. Civil War is the official start of Phase 3.
DC_Cinematic,3dsleh,TripleSkeet,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:01:07 2015 UTC,Yet Ant-Man is the official end of Phase 2.
DC_Cinematic,3dsleh,IAmLuckyDuckling,5,Sun Jul 19 05:10:25 2015 UTC,Not thinking of everything in terms of how Marvel does it would be a start towards better understanding what they're doing. They damn sure aren't using Marvel as a blueprint.
DC_Cinematic,3dsleh,JeweliusCaesar,4,Sun Jul 19 12:08:19 2015 UTC,"Phases is just a term like Duckling said. WB basically announced a ""phase"" with the 12 movies they announced."
DC_Cinematic,3dsleh,S0ckHeaven,3,Sun Jul 19 02:15:28 2015 UTC,"I think, this is all speculation on my part but backed up by careful analysis of interviews of actors,producers, WB studio execs, DC execs (mainly Johns), some trade reports, some scoops and some rumor dumps. Here we go,   DCEU or DC film universe is the vision of director Zack Snyder, although initial idea of MOS was of Goyer and Nolan. All films (at least) upto Green Lantern are going to be one big story arc, it is Zack Snyder's mega-opus. But all films WILL have trademark style of their directors, example Suicide Squad by David Ayer. There are plans for spinoff in other media. If everything goes well DC films will be the biggest films produced by WB for atleast 10 years. Plans to make GL a big franchise within DCEU."

DC_Cinematic,3dsleh,hustlesimmons,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:59:59 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping they keep the trajectory going ahead with small exceptions. Superman needed and got a origin movie. Batman is worthy of a mini-origin story via short flash backs. Even though everyone knows it, this is a new Batman and it needs to be addressed. And Wonder Woman deserves a full on origin movie imo. Other than that, I don't even really want origin movies (although Shazam would likely need to be, I have a feeling he will not be in the picture yet for JL1). Definitely need to do work to establish characters, maybe more in the vein of who it looks like they will with Batman. But by the time Flash, Aquaman movies role around we will have seen JL1, we will know these characters. I hope they address their past as needed but push the story AHEAD. And especially Cyborg and Green Lantern Corps. Will have seen them in both JL movies, maybe see them show up in other movies, will already know who Cyborg came to be, keep the story going forward. We will know how the GLs came into the picture, don't need any more origins. And I do think this is WBs plan, and they don't need to ""catch up"" to Marvel, that is a silly notion. But they can get the most out of their actors contracts and movies by not devoting too much screen time to origin stories. We are a point in time general audiences are in tune enough with the genre, they can skip a bit of the set up and get further ahead in the grand story."

DC_Cinematic,3dph6s,TronVin,14,Sat Jul 18 04:46:49 2015 UTC,"Probably becoming ""The Flash"" will be a different kind of defining moment for you, Ezra. How did that come to be?  Miller: I’d love to be a fly on the wall during the “who’s going to be ‘The Flash’"" argument.  Angarano: You’re saying that it was out of your control, ultimately.  Miller: Yeah, it was out of my hands. I don’t really know how it happened, that I became The Flash. To my understanding, usually someone’s either struck by lightning into a basket of chemicals or they inhale heavy water vapors [laughs]. So I think that’s how it happened to me, too. Just in a more abstract sense.   That is the first origin for Jay Garrick, the first Flash and the Flash of the Golden Age. The origin was recently changed in the New 52."
DC_Cinematic,3dph6s,hustlesimmons,6,Sat Jul 18 04:49:44 2015 UTC,i dont think alot of people who watch the TV show even know that one lol

Now he's just inhaling Flash comics, and is loving it. Says he's using his casting as an excuse to read everything. Haha.  He's also a fan of the Flash TV show, and loves that two different people are playing Barry, in two different universes."

A: I've been a comic guy, but I'm going in as hard as possible, because I have a serious excuse to. I have the ultimate license to geek out so hard all the time.   Judging by how he said it and by the rest of the interview, it really looks like he's extremely happy and enthusiastic about the role, and he really wants to give fans what they want. This kind of excitement is what sold me Grant Gustin, and now I'm totally sold on Ezra as well. Really looking forward to his iteration of Barry."

DC_Cinematic,3dobm2,whatudontlikefalafel,4,Sat Jul 18 10:00:16 2015 UTC,"What could he direct? I mean, they already have directors for BvS, SS, WW, Justice League, and Aquaman. The leaves the Flash, Green Lantern Corps, Shazam, and Cyborg free."
DC_Cinematic,3dobm2,timetravlrfromthepst,7,Fri Jul 17 23:15:56 2015 UTC,"if there proves to be anything to this rumor... I'd guess Flash, just because it is the soonest one (without a director) and it will need a director pretty soon.  I guess another crazy possibility is MoS 2... (although I'd guess Snyder would get first crack at that, but taking on both JL movies, who knows)"
DC_Cinematic,3dobm2,S0ckHeaven,2,Fri Jul 17 23:22:28 2015 UTC,It is? I though JL was after SS?   Edit thought

DC_Cinematic,3dobm2,S0ckHeaven,2,Fri Jul 17 23:33:29 2015 UTC,Oh ok. You got me excited there for a minute
DC_Cinematic,3dobm2,TotallyNotKanye,2,Fri Jul 17 23:35:36 2015 UTC,"haha, yeah. WW and JL in between SS and Flash."
DC_Cinematic,3dobm2,S0ckHeaven,3,Fri Jul 17 23:37:28 2015 UTC,"Out of those, GLC or Cyborg I'd say. But probably GLC"
DC_Cinematic,3dobm2,TheMurderCapitalist,3,Fri Jul 17 23:20:15 2015 UTC,I would have guessed one of those... but those are 5 years out. A director announced for them this soon would surprise me.
DC_Cinematic,3dobm2,S0ckHeaven,5,Fri Jul 17 23:26:18 2015 UTC,Didn't Miller spend like 20 years honing Fury Road? 5 years might be rushing him ;)
DC_Cinematic,3dobm2,IAmLuckyDuckling,2,Fri Jul 17 23:39:53 2015 UTC,that is actually a really good point.
DC_Cinematic,3dobm2,S0ckHeaven,4,Fri Jul 17 23:41:55 2015 UTC,Unlikely. They'll get him straight into the 2 more Mad Max movies he wants to do.
DC_Cinematic,3dobm2,YoureASoldierBodie,4,Fri Jul 17 23:39:08 2015 UTC,"While profitable, I'm not sure if the sequels are guaranteed at this point. r/boxoffice weighs in. WB might rather coax him onto a PG-13 blockbuster. Probably wouldn't be too hard to convince considering JL: Mortal."
DC_Cinematic,3dobm2,ninjartist,2,Sat Jul 18 00:04:26 2015 UTC,"A George Miller superhero movie would be awesome, but I don't know how many more years he'll be making movies, and I'd rather see him get out two more Mad Max movies."
DC_Cinematic,3dobm2,Justice_Prince,2,Sat Jul 18 00:05:18 2015 UTC,I would be excited for him to do anything in this universe. He was trying to get JL off the ground way back http://io9.com/the-first-ever-look-at-george-millers-scrapped-justice-1708165083.  WB love him to bits these days
DC_Cinematic,3dobm2,SmokingChops,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:29:45 2015 UTC,Praise be to the Miller. They'll strike a deal. 2 more Max for a couple DCEU. Miller is getting old though so he'd better get cracking!

DC_Cinematic,3doj0t,august_west_,2,Sat Jul 18 04:22:24 2015 UTC,this is great and very detailed. the only thing I believe he is wrong on is the BatJet. It was showcased at ComicCon as the new BatWing so it's not WW's plane. Maybe she is flying it to the fight though? The plot seems on point. Really good read

I am glad it wasn't though.This trailer is very close to the comic con trailer, scenes are cut/or cut a tad short, and the pacing is different . You can absolutely tell that the comic con trailer was made for the fans.   The differences between this and the comic con trailer I noticed:   Bruce's run at the beginning starts mid way through [cut] Tire pull [cut] scene with Lex and the senator  [cut]Robin suit [cut] Bruce looking at Diana getting into the car. [add?] Wonder Woman's distance travelled before hitting the wall while glimpsing her sheild. Arguably one  my favorite part and in my opinion pretty vital (but thats a fans opinion though) - [cut] - Alfred's ""You're going to go to war... He is not our enemy"""
DC_Cinematic,3do3po,decrepidactyl,3,Sat Jul 18 00:08:25 2015 UTC,Looks like there are some small changes/additions

DC_Cinematic,3dnhc6,demasx,18,Fri Jul 17 18:27:53 2015 UTC,"I expect it's a piece of the world engine. Lex sends his scientists to scope out the Indian Ocean as that's where the other Black Zero ship was terraforming the earth. This is where Lex gets his hands on Kryptonite. If by terraforming, turns Earth into Krypton, and Kryptonite is simply radioactive pieces of Krypton...Kryptonite must have been formed as a residual byproduct of the terraforming process. I would not be surprised to find that in the bottom of the sea there."
DC_Cinematic,3dnhc6,metalslugg3r,3,Fri Jul 17 19:33:46 2015 UTC,There will probably be some kind of storyline that involves Aquaman  being very pissed off about the world engine being placed in his Indian Ocean.

DC_Cinematic,3dm3v6,IronTeach,8,Fri Jul 17 13:03:08 2015 UTC,"Jared is a busy dude, and has probably made some other commitments prior. I guess that is also possible, that his part in the film is not that extensive."

DC_Cinematic,3dj0nc,toolonglurking,4,Thu Jul 16 19:15:24 2015 UTC,Why are people suddenly calling it the DCEU and not the DCCU?
DC_Cinematic,3dj0nc,drakesfolly,11,Thu Jul 16 21:36:42 2015 UTC,Basically because that's what Warner Brothers decided to call it now.

DC_Cinematic,3dj0nc,KomodoEmiko,4,Fri Jul 17 08:18:01 2015 UTC,"not sub par but the postproduction time would have been short, something that i´m honestly worried about when they begin to make 3 films per year"
DC_Cinematic,3dj0nc,soulbreaker1418,12,Thu Jul 16 21:06:25 2015 UTC,"Every studio produces multiple movies at once. It's a cycle.  While movie A is in post production, movie B is in production and movie C is in pre production. Then movie D starts pre production, B goes into post production, and C goes into production."
DC_Cinematic,3dj0nc,that_guy2010,-8,Thu Jul 16 22:22:15 2015 UTC,"for a normal studio that´s true, but neither Marvel nor DC/Warner are because all the movies have to make sense together, so a small group of people supervise all the scripts and productions at once(in DC now are Goyer, Snyder,Jhons,maybe Nolan,and a few more), so no, it´s not trivial by any means nor a cycle given the production alone are 4 months at least, the entire process a year and a half, there will be 2 movies being done at the same time, sometimes even the 3 of them"
DC_Cinematic,3dj0nc,soulbreaker1418,4,Thu Jul 16 22:39:50 2015 UTC,"Still, 3 isn't many scripts to look over and make sure they make sense together. Even if 3 went into production at the exact same time, the higher ups at WB/DC and Marvel would have had plenty of time to look over scripts and make sure they work together.  I'm just saying, I wouldn't start worrying until either studio makes a film that doesn't go well with the others. From all indications Ant-Man fits with the rest of the MCU films, and the DC film universe is so young that, right now, they don't have much work to do to stay in continuity."
DC_Cinematic,3dj0nc,that_guy2010,-7,Thu Jul 16 22:51:06 2015 UTC,"you still don´t get my point, do you? Marvel has never had 3 movies in a year so far and even having the basic plot through 2028(i´m not kidding), the problems getting the right people have been enormous, but at least they did it step by step making mistakes and learning from them, DC is rushing through that process trying to catch up knowing that one mistake could kill the project. I want them to succed, honor DC characters that deserve a good movie but i wonder if it is too fast too soon"

WB was excited about Man of Steel's success and wanted a sequel fast-tracked and ready within 2 years.

He might be right but we literally saw about 5 seconds of Wonder Woman in the trailer and have no idea what her motivations are going to be.

DC_Cinematic,3dmhbn,RocketTheCoon,3,Fri Jul 17 18:54:13 2015 UTC,lol I must have skimmed past that quote.  That puts this whole article in a completely different context for me.
DC_Cinematic,3dmhbn,mrthewhite,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:20:17 2015 UTC,Here's the full interview:  http://nerdist.com/grant-morrison-heavy-metal-wonder-woman-earth-one-comic-con-2015/
DC_Cinematic,3dmhbn,RocketTheCoon,3,Fri Jul 17 19:25:34 2015 UTC,"Nerdist: One more thing I need to ask about is the status of Wonder Woman: Earth One for DC, which you are writing and Yanick Paquette is illustrating. She’s easily my favorite character, and I’m dying to see your interpretation of her. What’s the status of that graphic novel?  Grant Morrison: It’s finished now and it’ll be coming out soon. I sat down and I thought, “I don’t want to do this warrior woman thing.” I can understand why they’re doing it, I get all that, but that’s not what [Wonder Woman creator] William Marston wanted, that’s not what he wanted at all! His original concept for Wonder Woman was an answer to comics that he thought were filled with images of blood-curdling masculinity, and you see the latest shots of Gal Gadot in the costume, and it’s all sword and shield and her snarling at the camera. Marston’s Diana was a doctor, a healer, a scientist. So I went back to those roots and just built it up again.  What would a society of immortal women that’s been around for 7,000 years have done? They wouldn’t still be chopping men’s head’s off; they’ve got art and architecture and philosophy and poetry and it’s got nothing to do with men. So Yanick Paquette did this amazing design job, where there are no phallic objects. The only phallic objects are like these Greek towers that are almost like this haunting echo of the culture they came from.  Wonder Woman’s Invisible Plane is now shaped like a vagina, it’s the most incredible thing. It opens up in the back and it has a little clitoris hood, everything is a female-based design. It’s all based on shells and natural stuff. He’s created this entire newly designed world for the Amazons. And for the first 48 pages, there are no men — it’s just women talking to each other. And then halfway through the book, we’re building up to this big fight, and then I thought, “No, I’m not.” This book isn’t about fights, there’s not going to be any fights. So we threw out the rules of traditional boy’s adventure fiction. It’s the most exciting book I’ve done in years, it changed everything I’m thinking about the future.  Nerdist: All of that is music to my ears. I respect [New 52 Wonder Woman writer] Brian Azzarello as a writer, but hate what he did to the Amazons. He turned Marston’s utopian society of women into people who murder the men they copulate with, then sell the male babies into slavery in trade for weapons. They’re essentially evil barbarians now, and I can’t imagine DC would have allowed the same character assassination to be done to Ma and Pa Kent or the Waynes.  Grant Morrison: Yeah…I mean, you can do the Amazons as a bit strange and aloof, because they could defeat Man’s World if they felt like it, because their science is so advanced. But at the same time their culture is quite frozen, which is why Diana wants to get away and see what else is out there. But that’s how I see it. I think it’ll be quite controversial.   The whole interview is here."

I hate this SJW assholes of idiotic sites like nerdist.  Look Morrison is like my favorite writer but like all writers he is a crackpot.

DC_Cinematic,3dka10,BaronVonStevie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:50:52 2015 UTC,"I'm just wondering at what point are they going to talk about rebuilding Metropolis? Not just patching it up here and there, but like the serious effort it would take to rebuild huge portions of the city that were pummeled to dust during the Zod/Superman fight. Gotham would likely be helping Metropolis, not the other way around."
DC_Cinematic,3dka10,Talking_Asshole,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:50:51 2015 UTC,"What I could read from the newspaper article (and posted in the OP) says it all really. There is a cleanup effort going on, money is being rased for a large Rebuild Metropolis Fund, and people in Gotham feel like Metropolis need to sort it all out on its own as they have enough problems themselves."
DC_Cinematic,3djd4b,icykid298,12,Thu Jul 16 19:10:45 2015 UTC,95% sure it will be PG-13
DC_Cinematic,3djd4b,S0ckHeaven,12,Thu Jul 16 21:00:22 2015 UTC,"I really hope they go R rated, Ayer seems to have never made a movie that has been pg-13 and I would love to see joker and batman fight in a r rated movie"
DC_Cinematic,3djd4b,BattleReadyPenguin,19,Thu Jul 16 22:43:18 2015 UTC,PG-13 with an unrated edition on the DVD similar to the Wolverine.
DC_Cinematic,3djd4b,TronVin,5,Thu Jul 16 19:29:41 2015 UTC,I'm hoping for a hard R.  Marvel has already established a cinematic universe you can take the kids to.  I want the DC cinematic universe to be something the kids shouldn't see until they get a little older. I want these to be super hero movies for grown ups.
DC_Cinematic,3djd4b,xixy_harlan,3,Fri Jul 17 02:27:05 2015 UTC,"I could see them doing R. The universe is already geared towards an older audience and Suicide Squad lends itself to be R rated. Especially with Deadpool being rated R and Daredevil being pretty damn brutal at times, they'll hopefully want to get in on that."
DC_Cinematic,3djd4b,SokrPotato,3,Thu Jul 16 22:43:21 2015 UTC,"Hoping for an R rating, but since Batman is in it, probably PG-13."
DC_Cinematic,3djd4b,DerringerHK,3,Thu Jul 16 21:31:46 2015 UTC,"I'm optimistically, gonna say R."
DC_Cinematic,3djd4b,Greyhound272,3,Thu Jul 16 22:24:48 2015 UTC,"Although David Ayer's track record would look like it's a R rating, it will most likely be PG-13. $150 M budget is hard to profit off of with an R-rating, regardless of what studio makes it. Deadpool can get away with it since its budget is only like $30 M."
DC_Cinematic,3djd4b,Nick3570,3,Thu Jul 16 23:30:37 2015 UTC,"ideally R, being honest a hard PG-13 with the help of Warner will be the way to go"

Suicide Squad alone shows this unless Killer Croc, El Diablo, Enchantress, Tattoo Man, etc. are all Kryptonian descendants.  If they're allowing them all to exist with unadulterated origins, I don't see why Wonder Woman would be bound to Kryptonian history anymore than Enchantress would be.  They may have briefly considered it, but that time has passed."
DC_Cinematic,3dmzio,demasx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:32:34 2015 UTC,I hope you're right. I don't want them to pull the rug out from under Wonder Woman and turn her story into a backdoor Superman movie.

You're saying that because Kal El is being worshipped as a god, descendants of the surviving scout ship were worshiped as the mythological gods of old, Norse, Indian, Greek, etc... The ""god"" Zeus could have been a descendant. I heard the same rumors in this ""science fiction"" based universe. With Goyer is out and magic is in, they don't need to do that now."
DC_Cinematic,3dmzio,hustlesimmons,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:05:14 2015 UTC,When an avalanche of down votes strikes on reddit I'm used to it not making sense. I'm just looking out for the Wonder Woman franchise which they could easily mess up by folding it into an established superman story
DC_Cinematic,3dmzio,S0ckHeaven,4,Sun Jul 19 01:10:01 2015 UTC,This theory has been around before and I think they pretty much confirmed that it isn't true.
DC_Cinematic,3dmzio,S0ckHeaven,3,Fri Jul 17 16:32:53 2015 UTC,"idk, i think they already said Wonder Woman is the daughter of Zeus in this, plus from what I've picked up from the Suicide Squad trailer this DCEU will definitely explore metahumans and powered beings, and if Enchantress' presence is anything to go by, that includes the magical and supernatural aspects as well.   Plus Shazam is coming and magic is an essential part of his character too."
DC_Cinematic,3dmzio,JamesD-TV,3,Fri Jul 17 19:17:28 2015 UTC,"In the MoS prequel comic book the person who left the open pod was Supergirl. Not sure if that is ""canon"" to the DCEU or not."
DC_Cinematic,3dmzio,keeprollinrollinyo,0,Fri Jul 17 17:59:06 2015 UTC,again I hope it's called back. I hope it's explained. I just also hope it has nothing to do with Wonder Woman.
DC_Cinematic,3dmzio,Fuel-For-Life,2,Fri Jul 17 21:22:03 2015 UTC,If you read that prequel comic they explain it.
DC_Cinematic,3dj1ia,hustlesimmons,3,Thu Jul 16 17:47:32 2015 UTC,I remember when this first popped up everyone thought it would be a Robin flashback showing how he died
DC_Cinematic,3dj1ia,King-Grimm,3,Thu Jul 16 18:10:23 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that was for Affleck's other film The Accountant.

DC_Cinematic,3dj1ia,MAND3L8R0T,-1,Thu Jul 16 18:31:30 2015 UTC,I think it'll be Jena Malone as a young Robin?
DC_Cinematic,3dnzf5,Mmtwinn307,13,Fri Jul 17 20:42:55 2015 UTC,because she already plays Sif in the MCU in the Thor movies and 2 episodes of SHIELD

DC_Cinematic,3dnzf5,KomodoEmiko,8,Sat Jul 18 01:34:28 2015 UTC,because she is at marvel and plus if you look at all the other woman who were auditioning for the role  they all had the exotic look to them which Jaime Alexander doesn't  have.
DC_Cinematic,3dnzf5,william2181,6,Fri Jul 17 21:19:33 2015 UTC,"I like Jaimie Alexander, she was actually the first person I thought of and she was a name that a lot of people (fans) mentioned before any casting announcement. That said it pisses me off when people mention her and shit on the Gadot casting. Everyone bitches about Gadot being too small, yet Alexander is no bigger. Go watch Thor 2 again or just look at pictures.   I'm not accusing OP of making that judgement because there was zero mention of Gadot at all in his post. This is just a complaint I see all the time and it irks me when those same people mention Jaimie Alexander."
DC_Cinematic,3dg8n1,TronVin,24,Thu Jul 16 00:58:35 2015 UTC,Duuuude! I wanna smoke with this guy. The way he reacted to the BvS trailer question makes me think he's in this fuckin movie. He even gave you CW fans some love! SO HYPED TO SEE THE FLASH ON THE BIG SCREEN!
DC_Cinematic,3dg8n1,letsgetweirdkbye,8,Thu Jul 16 02:14:03 2015 UTC,his reaction to the BvS trailer leads me to believe he is in the movie in some capacity.

DC_Cinematic,3dg8n1,Techno_Bacon,2,Thu Jul 16 06:44:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly with the way many react to Arrow right now, it no doubt will be. In my opinion Grant as Flash is the tougher casting to get over because he fits the role so well, Stephen is a bit wooden and it'd be much easier to get over the fact he wouldn't be in the movie."

DC_Cinematic,3dg8n1,dc_fanboyforever,7,Thu Jul 16 02:12:37 2015 UTC,"I think what got me most excited about it was him talking about the pace of science at the time of the silver age Flash, like one of my favourite parts of the BvS teaser was Neil Degrasse Tyson discussing mankind's priorities, I think it's such a cool, surprisingly untapped, area of comic book adaptations."
DC_Cinematic,3dg8n1,KomodoEmiko,4,Thu Jul 16 02:25:55 2015 UTC,"Good observation! Yeah, Neil Tyson in BvS gives it some science cred. I am in some pop sci forums, he is quite popular. In a way DC was ahead in the Multiverse before science had some tangible data."

DC_Cinematic,3dg8n1,swordmaster123,3,Thu Jul 16 15:59:46 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. Ezra just emits this positive energy, and I love that he could bring that to the character, and to this universe. I am really excited to see what Ezra's got."

DC_Cinematic,3dg8n1,EllrickOA,4,Thu Jul 16 15:14:13 2015 UTC,"Funny thing is people said that about Grant Gustin on /r/Arrow when he was cast, and the same people are saying that about Ezra and loves Grant on /r/Flashtv."

MoS is a movie that tries to keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time, and that can become tiresome when done poorly, but MoS just executed it so perfectly."
DC_Cinematic,3dgwdy,Justice_Prince,2,Thu Jul 16 21:23:36 2015 UTC,"not really, the movie in general was fluid, the problem as so many people has said before is the ideas behind the movie and its main character, that´s the problem getting inspiration from Frank Miller and Alan Moore, two very conservative authors"
DC_Cinematic,3dgwdy,soulbreaker1418,5,Thu Jul 16 21:35:55 2015 UTC,"When people start throwing around the word ""pacing"" and how MoS was brought down by it, I feel like they're brain-dead and just wanna hop on the hate-bandwagon. MoS had its issues (and I'm an ardent MoS fan; this movie made me a Superman fanatic) but it definitely wasn't how it was paced."
DC_Cinematic,3dgwdy,Tensor_,6,Thu Jul 16 17:03:38 2015 UTC,I never get tired of the feeling I get when Superman shows up to a battle. There's always a sort of timeless heroism to it.

From a business perspective though it's interesting that this is the route they are taking when they know families won't be going to see their movies. And as for long term brand growth, Marvel in twenty years is going to have a whole generation of adults that grew up on their movies and are going to have a strong affinity for the brand. I don't think DC will have the same nostalgia level because kids aren't going to see things like Suicide Squad."

I remember making a post way back in r/comicbookmovies that as a teenager, I thought Blade was going to usher in countless adult-oriented comic/action movies... It never happened.  Springboarding from your business perspective, I could see DC movies becoming like the hard action movies of the 80's (e.g. Aliens/Predator/Terminator, etc)-- Like, the ones you steal from dad and watch in secret with your friends, which almost makes them cooler in a way... or the ones dad shows you outright.    Or DC is counting on the adult merchandise market. I foresee a lot of Hot Topic licensing, as well as (like Marvel does) Hot Toys and other high-end collectibles.    EDIT: Maybe I'm stretching. You make good points either way. DC probably just saw an untapped market, even if going darker excludes more of a ""growing consumer"" audience (i.e. children). They're Yang to Marvel's Ying."

DC_Cinematic,3dg89d,ragingbuff,6,Thu Jul 16 01:34:53 2015 UTC,"Don't ever worry about height in movies.  They wave their magic wand and suddenly tom cruise goes from 5'7 to 6'1.  Seriously, they have been deluding you for years with what you can't see in the frame."
DC_Cinematic,3dg89d,roboticbrady,2,Thu Jul 16 01:37:26 2015 UTC,"True, very true. I still think he wouldn't be a great Nightwing, though. I just see him in what he is in and he just never struck me as a physical, cocky superhero type. Maybe something more with like magic or alien powers. If he was Nightwing, though, I'd just hope he would surprise me. It's happened before."

Just that tiny bit more edge.  Anna Kendrick is an interesting choice but I'd agree with some people that she's not really actiony enough to play batgirl. I can't think of someone else off the top of my head. Not many actresses who are bright and cheerful AND sassy AND action ready AND the right age to play Barbara. At least not any that are coming to mind. A teenage Emily Blunt would have nailed it though.   Edit: I see now you've listed Barbara as Oracle. I think Anna could actually do Barbara in the chair pretty amazingly"

DC_Cinematic,3derm5,TronVin,3,Wed Jul 15 21:21:21 2015 UTC,They're on their way! The artist is whipping them up as we speak.
DC_Cinematic,3derm5,TronVin,8,Wed Jul 15 21:53:41 2015 UTC,"Can I make a few suggestions.   1) The flairs' text needs fixing. Examples:  http://i.imgur.com/s3mmK0U.png  http://i.imgur.com/Lx9rZd0.png  The flair word covers up the words other words.  2) The subreddit needs a style that is a little more flashy in a way and includes all three movies we have seen. There is a bit too much black going on. I know the universe is darker but we need something brighter here. Also, The logos need to be fixed on the side to include the HD Suicide Squad logo.  3) Suicide Squad flairs.   4) Need to strike-down on anti-Marvel circlejerking. We need to be better than that. I understand some may have negative opinions on the MCU but we need to keep it down to a minimum.   5) Tags for submitted content. Fan art, news, opinions, etc.  That is really about it."
DC_Cinematic,3derm5,S0ckHeaven,3,Wed Jul 15 20:43:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback!  We're looking into the flair text issue (seems to be a bug in the sub's CSS). Tags are also on the way.  The Suicide Squad flairs are in the pipeline! Keep your eyes out!  MCU bashing is an issue. Honestly, with so many new subscribers, the mod team has been a little overwhelmed as of late (the reason behind the SS logo not yet being updated). To fix this, the mod team is currently being expanded."
DC_Cinematic,3derm5,S0ckHeaven,2,Wed Jul 15 21:09:33 2015 UTC,I would have a subreddit style similar to the regular /r/DCcomics subreddit (similar to /r/marvelstudios). Maybe have images of non-JL characters faded in the background with the core members in focus.

DC_Cinematic,3derm5,Mordkay,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:00:53 2015 UTC,I think you should replace the DC logo in the banner to the official one and also make the logos for upcoming movies in the sidebar bigger and replace the suicide squad logo for the official one.

DC_Cinematic,3deo9a,DerringerHK,3,Wed Jul 15 20:13:37 2015 UTC,"Hello, friend. Comic books and their many characters can be a daunting thing to get into, eh?  I highly recommend you check out John Ostrander's run on the comic from the eighties. Although it's too early to be sure, it looks like the film is taking a lot of cues and influences from said run. The stories are fairly self-contained with three or so issues dedicated to a particular mission that the group must undertake. No heavy reading required.  If you're interested, then you can read them digitally here."

DC_Cinematic,3ddwjw,Fuel-For-Life,10,Wed Jul 15 14:43:23 2015 UTC,Yes! I've been saying all along that it makes way more sense for her to be Barbara rather than Carrie Kelley.

DC_Cinematic,3ddwjw,JamesTheGent,3,Wed Jul 15 15:28:07 2015 UTC,I think Malone is either a small character or Oracle. Carry Kelley wasn't 30 year old in TDKReturns. I hope Oracle!

It's the only thing that hasn't been given proper form on film, seeing as how Joel Schumaker F'd it up so badly with his version of Robin and Batgirl.  Since this is supposed to be an older Bats and we know that at least one Robin has died in the past (killed by Joker), can we assume that maybe Oracle is already around, having been Barbara Gordon/Batgirl, or some equivalent?  We also know that Jim Gordon is dead in this universe and Batman is still considered a fugitive according to someone in BvS saying ""this bat vigilante is a one man reign of terror"", so Bats doesn't have allies in the government or maybe in the local PD even, does he have to rely upon other vigilantes perhaps?  It's also been suggested that Bruce and Diana know each other, AND know each others secret identities in BvS as well. Are the two of them aware of other supers/vigilantes, it seems like something Bats would do...keep tabs on other superheroes."

DC_Cinematic,3de045,nbaballa05,11,Wed Jul 15 15:09:54 2015 UTC,"Superman serves as the first ""outed"" Superhero in the DCEU. Amanda Waller references it in the SS trailer about how folks are coming out of the wood work because of him.   Aquaman has probably minded his own until the world engine in MoS so hopefully we witness a grand entrance.   WW and the Amazons of Themyscira have been absent as well not needing to interfere in the world of man.  Flash might be doing good, but only as a rumor, like Batman. There is no press conference for the speedster (yet).  Green Lanterns might have been off Earth when Zod arrived. They can't really be incognito. Maybe in Corps, it's determined with the emergence of these meta-humans and extraterrestrial's it's necessary for them to have a dedicated GL on Earth. Prior to that the operated at the other end of the quadrant.   Vic has not been injured or transformed into C.Y.B.O.R.G."
DC_Cinematic,3de045,toolonglurking,4,Wed Jul 15 16:49:41 2015 UTC,"My understanding from the trailer has been that Batman's been 'outed' but isn't on Superman levels because of his lack of city destroying powers, his stealth, and his retirement that's been mentioned in interviews before.   If Perry White tells Clark Kent not to take on the Batman (after telling Lois not to run the Superman story in MoS because people wouldn't believe it), Batman must be more than a rumor if Perry is relatively afraid. Maybe this point is wrong considering the Lois story.  Anyway it'd be hard to be a rumor after branding people and leaving batarangs all over. Unless it really IS like Dark Knight Returns and Batman went from real to urban legend through the years.  That said, I agree with the Flash being the red blur/rumor."
DC_Cinematic,3de045,Renegade_Reference,3,Wed Jul 15 18:27:28 2015 UTC,It was announced a while ago that Vic will be in BvS so we'll likely see some semblance of an origin for him in that movie.  Maybe he gets hurt in BvS and becomes Cyborg in Justice League
DC_Cinematic,3de045,mrthewhite,3,Wed Jul 15 18:36:48 2015 UTC,"If i'm correct the leaked plot detailed something like him being injured in a battle latter on in the film which leads to him going through the C.Y.B.O.R.G programme by the end of the film. Not sure how true it is but it definitely does seem plausible, either that or he's injured in the Battle of Metropolis."
DC_Cinematic,3de045,TheJoshider10,0,Wed Jul 15 19:45:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think Flash will be Flash yet, or at least wasn't before MoS."
DC_Cinematic,3de045,Justice_Prince,4,Wed Jul 15 20:00:22 2015 UTC,"Just a thought, do you think Vic was injured by the events of man of steel leading to him becoming Cyborg. This would create an interesting chemistry between cyborg and superman, showing a casuality/consequence from supermans actions.  I agree about Jason and Dick.    Barry may just be starting out as flash, or may become it as a result of something which happens in the movie.   I'm not sure about GL, the suggestion that Chris Pine is to play the character makes me think its still Hal. In which case he may be off Earth with the Corps and will return or reveal himself to others once he finds out they exist."

We see her observing Bruce Wayne and such (presumably) but other than that we don't know why she's there and what way she intervienes between Batman and Superman.  Aquaman is probably in Atlantis but will appear due to the surface worlds unrest. I don't feel like the ocean clip from the trailer was for him but maybe.   I hope they show Victor getting hurt in BvS because I'd like the character to be introduced by Justice League. Maybe show Star Labs or something beforehand.  Green Lantern and Flash I feel won't appear but GL is probably in space and Flash may not have been created yet.   I'd really like Billy to cameo as a kid who looks up to Superman. They don't even have to cast the actual Billy for JL/ Shazam because time wise kids grow up and they can get away with it.  I hope they have a lot of cameos in this because technically this is our JL prequel and I don't just wanna have Green Lantern, Flash, and Shazam pop out of nowhere."
DC_Cinematic,3dd5vn,Lurk-man,12,Wed Jul 15 09:58:29 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. I like how Lois takes the Jor El role considering that scene they had in Man of Steel. Seems like a natural progression.  I really hope the film actually goes deep into certain themes and isn't actually just pretentious. The two trailers set up so many real life questions about Clark and it can tackle things such as racism, segregation, portrayals in the media (Gone Girl did this beautifully) etc etc. I don't want the film to come out and then Snyder has to be like ""uh yeah...yeah we totally meant that"". I want there to be genuine care and exploration."

DC_Cinematic,3dd5vn,DukeOfLowerChelsea,3,Wed Jul 15 15:41:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's a well-presented theory, but ultimately a little off as far as Martha and Jonathan are concerned.  Jonathan didn't want or expect Clark to hide forever. He clearly knew, and even stated, one day he would have to reveal himself. And whichever kind of man he was - good or bad - he would change the Earth forever. He just wanted to protect his teenage son.  In the trailer, Martha implores him to be whatever the people of Earth need him to be. Or be nothing, because as she notes, regardless of Jor-El's plans, he owes the planet nothing. Every good deed he accomplishes is an act of charity. Plus, she's probably disgusted with the people of Earth at the moment, as she likely got done watching the U.S. Government and others drag her son through the mud for saving them from extinction."

I think they are present in the real world.  At 2:39 in the trailer, when Batman emerges from the bunker dressed in fatigues there is a building in the background that looks like the Parthenon. Maybe it's just a blown out building or maybe he is in Themyscira?  Maybe the soldiers capture him and notify Superman as their ""unofficial leader"" and invite him to interrogate the Batman which is why they are kneeling when Supes arrives.   Either way, I don't think Batman breaks a guys a neck and I think after the backlash of MoS, Batman and Superman will not be killing people again... I hope."

DC_Cinematic,3daehs,xixy_harlan,12,Wed Jul 15 04:56:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think it should be a competition.  If any character is open to different interpretations it has to be The Joker.  Ledger's Joker was the playful Anarchist, an ""agent of chaos"".  This looks like it will be a different take on The Joker.  More flashy and more sadistic.  Ledger's Joker seemed to have a political agenda of some kind even though it was nihilistic.  I think Leto's Joker will be more the psychotic, sadistic gangster style Joker.  Both interpretations are valid and backed up by canon in the comics."
DC_Cinematic,3daehs,stonespiral,3,Wed Jul 15 07:01:43 2015 UTC,"I agree for sure.  I'll spare writing my entire comment to /u/SokrPotato again, but I would love it if Leto's joker is entirely incomparable to previous portrayals.  I feel like it would only lend to the character."
DC_Cinematic,3daehs,xixy_harlan,2,Wed Jul 15 07:31:03 2015 UTC,"It completely lends to the character.  One of the best things they've established about the Joker over decades of storytelling is that he's got this weird elusive quality to him.  Several stories where he seems to die but then he's back.  After all these years there is still no clear or certain origin for the character and there NEVER should be.  He's something that has to exist as long as The Batman exists.  This mystery and elasticity to the character is fundamental.  Every portrayal of The Joker thus far has been valid, even Cesar Romero.  He's not a product of his time but he's very easily adapted to whatever time period he's portrayed in.  Because what he really represents is this cold, dark, nasty side of ourselves and eachother that we don't like to admit exists."
DC_Cinematic,3daehs,SokrPotato,3,Thu Jul 16 23:37:01 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say. Ledger's Joker was very unique and I don't think we'll see anything like it again. Leto's Joker seems (to me) to be more completely insane whereas Ledger's Joker gave a more dark serial killer vibe (again, just my opinion). Obviously it's too early to get a full grasp of what Leto's Joker will be like but I think they'll be incomparable."
DC_Cinematic,3daehs,stonespiral,3,Wed Jul 15 05:45:24 2015 UTC,"That would be my ideal end.  Because I don't think comparing Nicholson to Ledger is appropriate, and I don't think comparing any of them to Hamill is appropriate.  If Leto can manage to make his Joker totally separate and brilliant and incomparable to any of the others, that would just be amazing.  I love the idea of no cinematic Joker being anything like the last.  It would only lend to the character."

DC_Cinematic,3daehs,whatudontlikefalafel,11,Tue Jul 14 23:53:28 2015 UTC,"Perhaps it is the fact that there is no confirmation that this film is going to be R-rated.  Combine that with WB's clear goals for unified DC universe and how they've never not made a PG-13 DC movie. There is nothing in the Suicide Squad trailer that is more ""R-rated"" than what they showed in The Dark Knight."
DC_Cinematic,3dbuxy,icykid298,17,Wed Jul 15 01:40:25 2015 UTC,Yeah Heath Ledger's voice is way more nasally than Jared Leto's performance.
DC_Cinematic,3dbuxy,IAmLuckyDuckling,8,Wed Jul 15 01:48:24 2015 UTC,This is what I have been saying to people. I really don't hear any similarities iin their voices at all.
DC_Cinematic,3dbuxy,The_Dirtiest_Beef,10,Wed Jul 15 02:12:54 2015 UTC,"People have been saying it sounds like Leto is doing a ""version"" of Ledger. I am not saying they are wrong, I just don't hear it.Honestly, I think people are trying to make a connection that is not there...but that is nothing new."
DC_Cinematic,3dbuxy,decrepidactyl,6,Wed Jul 15 03:10:44 2015 UTC,I definitely hear similarities but not  enough to call it a version or copy or anything.  Seems like more of a coincidence on the very little we've heard.
DC_Cinematic,3dbuxy,stonespiral,2,Wed Jul 15 05:01:54 2015 UTC,"well you are basing this all off of like 2 seconds, but where i hear the similarities is when Leto's voice kind of quivers in the end when he says ""bad"""
DC_Cinematic,3dbuxy,COMPLIMENT-4-U,7,Wed Jul 15 05:58:57 2015 UTC,"It's really eerie how his smile is so GENUINE. You can see the Joker in his right element, being overjoyed  Fuck Im hyped"
DC_Cinematic,3dbuxy,demosthenes718,10,Wed Jul 15 12:49:58 2015 UTC,"I think there are definitely faint similarities, but not even close to being a ""ripoff"" or ""copy.""  We've also seen one clip of one line from Leto. It's hardly enough to base his whole performance on."
DC_Cinematic,3dbuxy,SteveBuscemisEyes,3,Wed Jul 15 05:22:16 2015 UTC,If only the laugh was included
DC_Cinematic,3dbuxy,COMPLIMENT-4-U,3,Wed Jul 15 08:13:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think that was his ""real"" laugh"
DC_Cinematic,3dbuxy,Tom-ocil,3,Wed Jul 15 12:49:17 2015 UTC,"There is absolutely a similarity there. It's not a carbon copy, but nor is it a world apart."
DC_Cinematic,3dbuxy,jxjen,2,Wed Jul 15 21:10:35 2015 UTC,"Well, the way they sound their ""L"" s is similar but that's probably because the joker is supposed to have a super wide mouth where it was cut. You try saying ""Really"" or anything with that L sound while stretching your mouth or keeping the sides loose. That's just how it sounds when you do that!   Sean Connery kinda does the same thing when he talks, he pulls one side of his mouth over and it creates that sound with ""S"" and "" L"" sounds."
DC_Cinematic,3dbuxy,beaujangles727,4,Wed Jul 15 11:01:33 2015 UTC,You could have Joey CoCo Diaz playing the joker and people would say he was trying to be Ledger. The mans performance was just that great.
DC_Cinematic,3dbuxy,Baned0n,2,Wed Jul 15 13:21:31 2015 UTC,"All this did was make me sad that Heath died.  Honestly, I think that any time I see TDK though."

DC_Cinematic,3dbef6,Csantana,2,Tue Jul 14 23:32:45 2015 UTC,I heard they have a psychologist  (or something I know there are a lot of different kinds of therapy) on set for them.

There is 100% absolutely no way in hell that the experience of filming the movie is like, duuuuuuuude, so fucked up.  Same deal with the rat. Sounds edgy until you remember that there are all sorts of animal welfare laws that (rightly) need to be followed. Not like Leto was out in some dumpster going full method and hunting rats. He got on his phone, talked to his assistant, the assistant went to a pet store and bought a rat, cleared the whole thing with the proper animal authorities, etc.  I'm not trying to be a dick, but really, this is all fluff."

DC_Cinematic,3dat35,keeprollinrollinyo,2,Wed Jul 15 08:43:11 2015 UTC,"It looks like a factory of some sort, to me.   But then there's the scene where they tie Harley (pre-transformation Harley, when she was still Harleen Quinzel) down to the table and then at the end of the trailer Joker walks into that room.   My guess is that it's actually Arkham, and it's another version of how Joker turns Harleen into Harley."
DC_Cinematic,3daxok,JamesTheGent,12,Tue Jul 14 21:27:09 2015 UTC,Am I the only one that didn't notice this? There are a bunch of skulls in the cave Cara Delevinge is. I'm guessing there is going to be an Enchantress origin story in Suicide Squad and that they pick her up somewhere in the movie. Good to know that at least the magic aspect of the DCEU will get some kind of explanation in Suicide Squad!
DC_Cinematic,3daxok,kingfish101,6,Tue Jul 14 21:27:15 2015 UTC,"In the trailer, I never saw her walking down the street with the rest of the Squad. Is it possible that something will happen to her? Or maybe she is the main antagonist for the movie..."
DC_Cinematic,3daxok,rustedmachines,2,Tue Jul 14 21:55:07 2015 UTC,"From what I recall, she's being held in a different location from the team. I don't think there's been any confirmation on where she is or what her involvement is."
DC_Cinematic,3daxok,kingfish101,5,Wed Jul 15 00:05:16 2015 UTC,So maybe she is like a last resort weapon or something.
DC_Cinematic,3daxok,IIIISuperDudeIIII,2,Wed Jul 15 00:15:51 2015 UTC,"Yup, looks like the origin story... From wikipedia...   Freelance artist June Moone... stumbles upon a secret chamber where an unknown magical being (later named as Dzamor) empowers her...   Could easily change ""freelance artist"" to ""spelunker"" etc."
DC_Cinematic,3daxok,Mordkay,3,Tue Jul 14 22:12:15 2015 UTC,"Also noticed that, the scene where she is in the bathtub, she looks up at someone/something? Maybe it's him."
DC_Cinematic,3daxok,Talking_Asshole,4,Wed Jul 15 00:20:19 2015 UTC,"My guess is that June Moone is the teams target in the film. Waller has discovered that Moone is host to a powerful entity, something that would be dangerous to even Superman (remember Supes is vulnerable to magic in the comics) and want to keep it out of the hands of bad guys (Joker, Lex, etc), or wants it for herself/the government.  The team are told to retrieve her at all costs, but my bet is that the Joker throws a wrench into Waller's plan.s  What would be cool is having Moone locked up in Arkham, and the team has to break her out, but the Joker breaks out and takes the Asylum over."

DC_Cinematic,3d9lrh,Nick3570,-6,Tue Jul 14 16:37:34 2015 UTC,"Exactly, right now they should just leave the advertising. They would be overdoing it at this rate as there is still months till the movie comes out. We fans would keep the hype they need not worry about hitting large numbers in the box office (it wont hit jurrassic world figures, but it would definetly hit big)  Suicide squad worries me even more, not even the leaked pics and videos from the shoot but the trailer clip....when we have more than a whole year till the movie"
DC_Cinematic,3d9lrh,Thief_Extraordinaire,13,Tue Jul 14 17:17:53 2015 UTC,"I don't see why Suicide Squad worries you. They literally only released it due to the leaked footage, it was never meant to be made public."

I shouldnt have complained, thank god we got to see the trailer. Jared leto would definitely prove the doubters wrong."
DC_Cinematic,3d9lrh,Thief_Extraordinaire,4,Tue Jul 14 19:09:11 2015 UTC,I don't. I think it'll be the highest grossing movie of the year (assuming it is halfway decent) but it won't set the opening weekend record.

DC_Cinematic,3d9lrh,Mordkay,2,Tue Jul 14 19:21:40 2015 UTC,"I apologize, Lord Vader. But my reasons are as follows:  No movie has ever opened in December higher than $100 million  The busiest shopping day of the holiday season (traditionally) is the Saturday before Christmas, which is the first Saturday that SW will be in theaters  People will be shopping, wrapping gifts, going to parties, etc.  You run the risk of snow keeping people from going out.   NOW, I absolutely think Star Wars is going to have amazing staying power and will have a solid 5-6 week run at number 1, since its first serious competition won't be Kung Fu Panda 3 or Deadpool."

DC_Cinematic,3d9lrh,TheJoshider10,2,Tue Jul 14 16:51:24 2015 UTC,"I find The Flash to be a little too cheesy. Arrow, Flash, and AoS are all way too long. I wish they'd stick to shorter action packed seasons the way Daredevil does. Otherwise were forced to watch a ton of forced romantic BS."
DC_Cinematic,3d9lrh,GlobalVagabond,4,Tue Jul 14 17:45:39 2015 UTC,Flash is my favorite character...wish I enjoyed the show. People who want those CW shows connected to the movies should all be lined up and executed. Joking...but not really.
DC_Cinematic,3d9lrh,letsgetweirdkbye,6,Wed Jul 15 01:07:21 2015 UTC,I completely agree. The CW turns every superhero show into a teen drama.

DC_Cinematic,3d9lrh,Huntersteve,-2,Tue Jul 14 20:57:43 2015 UTC,I hate Cisco. They should definitely kill him off. He is a terrible actor and adds nothing to the show whatsoever.

DC_Cinematic,3d9lrh,IIIISuperDudeIIII,6,Wed Jul 15 01:09:00 2015 UTC,Alright it's painfully obvious you don't watch the show.
DC_Cinematic,3d9lrh,Huntersteve,-7,Tue Jul 14 21:44:13 2015 UTC,"Daredevil is the ONLY comic book TV show that wasn't too cheesy/overdone. And there are STILL parts in it that are bad (Vincent D'Onofrio can be a bit much sometimes, and I could take or leave the redhead, and the actor who played Young Murdock was terrible.)  It's too dramatic for what it is.  I love Man of Steel. But even Man Of Steel was borderline cheesy for me. I think you can get away with it a bit easier in movies. If I wasn't so 100% on board with MoS, I would have definitely had problems with parts of it.  The Marvel Movies have, in general, not been cheesy, because they haven't really been taking themselves too seriously. But the Agents of Shield show? Totally cheesy. Takes itself too seriously. Same with all the WB shows, and Gotham and Constantine. I haven't seen Super Girl yet, but it's not looking good either."

C'mon Ben Affleck, you looked dead at Comic Con. I doubt you appreciate the support. At least act like you want to be there, you looked like your character on Gone Girl.

DC_Cinematic,3d9lrh,RADIOBALLS,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:52:38 2015 UTC,"Captain America was a great period piece. There wasn't much wrong with it Thor is a pretty enjoyable and quotable fantasy movie, Thor 2 was pretty boring though. It had really good fight scenes though. Those are both totally average movies Iron Man 2 was bad, yeah. Iron Man 3 was pretty alright though, considering it had some thought put into it unlike 2 Agents of shield is entirely dependent on how much you like marvel comics and movies. If you don't like them you 99% won't like AoS. If you do like them though you will like AoS   I still think man of steel is above all the ones you listed except for Captain America though"
DC_Cinematic,3d9lrh,faggot_human_trash,-1,Wed Jul 15 00:01:16 2015 UTC,So you'd rather be depressed by an overly serious superman film as opposed to watching fun movies that actually have good acting. And every movie you mentioned got better reviews than man of steel.

DC_Cinematic,3dcui6,dc_fanboyforever,13,Wed Jul 15 07:19:33 2015 UTC,"I really don't mind product placement if it's realistic enough. Having a character use a product is ok, but having all of them use it isn't. Man of Steel's was ok for me since those are real places you'd visit and it makes sense for a town to have them. As long as Superman doesn't stop to enjoy a refreshing bottle of Coca Cola TM then I'm fine with it."
DC_Cinematic,3dcui6,CobaltMoon98,3,Wed Jul 15 07:51:17 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly, some folks who even liked MoS gave some grief to it for product placement, but I think overall it was less evident if not subtle.  Do you think BvS will have at least one product placement?"
DC_Cinematic,3dcui6,whatudontlikefalafel,3,Wed Jul 15 07:54:11 2015 UTC,"I think WB had already made back the budget of MOS through product placement.  There will undoubtedly be some in Batman v Superman. The movie's called Batman v Superman, what company doesn't want their logo in the film?"

DC_Cinematic,3dcui6,Tom-ocil,2,Wed Jul 15 21:09:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the name was visible, but that doesn't really matter to me. Big stores like that have big visible signs. If they had some dialogue mentioning Sears in a positive way, that would have taken me out of the movie. Simply having the store there makes me feel like the world was real. If you think about product placement all of the time instead of just letting yourself be immersed in the world, then you're not enjoying the film as much as you should."
DC_Cinematic,3dcui6,Jangwin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:53:04 2015 UTC,"Right, but that wasn't my experience. Bad product placement is when you notice it, and I absolutely noticed the giant Sears logo nice and visible and centered. And the IHOP thing was just ridiculous.  Glad it didn't bug you, though."
DC_Cinematic,3dcui6,Greyhound272,11,Wed Jul 15 23:04:49 2015 UTC,"I didn't even notice most of it because there is no IHOP, 7-11 or Sears where I live, and I find it pretty reasonable for someone to own a Nokia phone or Nikkon camera. The only one I really noticed was LexCorp."

DC_Cinematic,3da3v9,jacobtie,2,Tue Jul 14 18:10:47 2015 UTC,I'd like for at least one movie to not have another lantern corps as the villains.  Like either the first one or the second one is about them fighting the Manhunters.
DC_Cinematic,3da3v9,Justice_Prince,10,Wed Jul 15 20:03:35 2015 UTC,"Questions like this miss something distinctive about the DCEU.  While Marvel has been using previously written story arcs as bases for their stories, Warner Bros has been crafting wholly new stories for their world.  Neither Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, or Suicide Squad are based off of previously written stories (though BvS uses DKR as a basis of Batman's characterization)."
DC_Cinematic,3da3v9,IAmLuckyDuckling,17,Tue Jul 14 18:13:41 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Marvel changes the story lines quite a bit when adapting them. Age of Ultron is Age of Ultron in name only. Iron Man 3 isn't really like Extremis. Civil War will undoubtedly be different from the comics.  Even these new DC films draw from the comics. Man of Steel's plot is very much Superman: Earth One with a lot taken and added. But the skeleton of the story is an alien coming to Earth drawing Superman out of hiding.  BvS is taking a lot from TDKR but it's clear that the plot and story is very different. Which is what I'd prefer.  I think the GLC film shouldn't try to translate one story, but instead combine from multiple sources which is what they've been doing all along."
DC_Cinematic,3da3v9,whatudontlikefalafel,11,Tue Jul 14 20:57:56 2015 UTC,"Good point. While they are not followed to the T, the story arcs do however provide a guide. So the question still applies, but to what level they follow the comics vs their own adaptation is to be determined. I enjoy the fact that WB stays true to the comics while also making it their own."
DC_Cinematic,3da3v9,invisiblack,3,Tue Jul 14 18:31:49 2015 UTC,"There is an interview of Zac Snyder on DC Entertaintment YouTube page where he says the same thing. Tbh, a future director might decide to adapt a certain arc from comics but as of now DCEU is original stories with inspiration from comic books."
DC_Cinematic,3dars8,S0ckHeaven,8,Tue Jul 14 20:46:29 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. At least, not of anyone in the Trinity.  The way I see it, Lex Luthor is going to reanimate Zod. Coupled with Krytonite and Kryptonian armor, an essentially zombie Zod will be virtually unstoppable. Can't break his neck. It's already broken.  This will necessitate the Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman team-up we saw snippets of in the trailer. The big battle."
DC_Cinematic,3dars8,IAmLuckyDuckling,2,Tue Jul 14 20:58:44 2015 UTC,The trailer seems to make things look like Bruce is gonna end up siding with Lex for a while. Seems like Bruce was in Metropolis the day Clark and Zod fought.

DC_Cinematic,3dabt6,speculumfight,7,Tue Jul 14 18:58:15 2015 UTC,"Wayyy too early to complain about Batman's origin being in the film. It's not like they're just putting it in there for the sake of it, I'm sure it's in there to contribute to the story. For example, if they're following along with the Batman/Superman fight from the dark knight returns in Crime Alley, it'll be good to know that Bruce Wayne's parents died there."
DC_Cinematic,3dabt6,KomodoEmiko,6,Wed Jul 15 02:42:44 2015 UTC,"Or simple conversation with Clark/or Diana that leads into this flashback. - Either way, Jeffrey Dean Morgan is Dr.Thomas Wayne, I would say the flashback is warranted."
DC_Cinematic,3dabt6,decrepidactyl,4,Wed Jul 15 03:31:05 2015 UTC,"Or it's a flashback from Bruce's perspective after he sees the newspapers that reads ""you let your family die"" (or words to that nature).   The newspaper and message relating to the Wayne employees, but invoking memories of his parents.    A 60 second flashback in a 2hour+ movie is fine."

He's talking about the experience of having thousands of people screaming at you and how, in today's day and age, it's just not something that's part of the human experience. The closest thing would be some giant battle involving thousands of screaming warriors, and he's saying that both instances are probably setting off the same part of the brain."

Not sure what they're going for with this Lex.  And why does Hollywood continually insist on putting a wig on Lex Luthor and making him silly?  Again with this?

DC_Cinematic,3dagk7,xixy_harlan,7,Tue Jul 14 21:08:33 2015 UTC,"I think the humor is meant to humanize the character... instead of ""RAGHHHH I'M EVIL JUST FOR THE SAKE OF BEING EVIL!""  Hopefully the writing and actor portrayal will be such that the audience finds the villain to be unassuming on first glance only to have him transform into a menacing monster before their eyes.

DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,faggot_human_trash,9,Mon Jul 13 22:03:43 2015 UTC,But DCEU makes no sense. Expanded Universe makes it sound like it's additional stories set in the DCU.  It's not. It's a version of the DCU constructed specifically for the screen. For the cinema.

DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,redjc99,3,Mon Jul 13 22:23:19 2015 UTC,The film looks amazing.
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,JeremyIsSpecial,3,Tue Jul 14 00:05:54 2015 UTC,"""What makes you think you can control them?""  ""Put bombs in their heads. Duh!""  ""Oh... makes sense."""
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,redjc99,6,Tue Jul 14 07:54:38 2015 UTC,"Okay, call me a moron, but the thing I've never quite understood about this movie is how it will be Batman-free, considering it features several of Batman's biggest villains. If it does feature Batman, how does it fit into the BvS storyline? If it doesn't, then who is on top of the car in the middle of the trailer?  Obviously I'm not familiar with the SS comics. Be gentle....  Trailer looks awesome, by the way."
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,TheCheshireCody,23,Mon Jul 13 21:12:05 2015 UTC,Batman is on top of the car. Not only did a bunch of that footage leak but Batfleck was even spotted on set.
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,danieltcae,9,Mon Jul 13 21:19:25 2015 UTC,It's believed the sequence with Batman on the roof of the car is one of Harley's flashbacks to the good old days before her relationship with the Joker went to hell after his murder of Jason Todd.
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,luckyshot35,-6,Mon Jul 13 21:19:56 2015 UTC,"It won't be Batman free, which is part of the problem. Suicide Squad is an awesome concept, and this isn't it. It's basically a backdoor Batman movie, and the ""Suicide Squad"" concept totally falls apart when you know there's no possible way that Joker, Harley Quinn, or most of the villains don't make it through the movie."
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,imdwalrus,6,Mon Jul 13 21:22:42 2015 UTC,"Well we don't know how much Batman will be in it. It could be only the part that we've seen, and we don't even know what time that's in (could be a flashback, etc). I have a feeling that it will be Bats free for the majority."
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,TheDude44464,3,Mon Jul 13 21:40:42 2015 UTC,"The cool thing about the Squad is there's so many villians to get ""recruited"" by Amanda Waller for the Squad. Deadshot, Boomerang, Harley and Croc are shoe ins for survivors whereas the other ones will probably die during the movie. I wouldn't say SS is a backdoor Batman movie cause Batman will hardly be in it. He will be in flashbacks and maybe come in at the end of the movie but Affleck was only on the set for a few days so he might not have more then a glorified cameo. Since the Joker is not part of the SS he will not die just probably captued and sent back to his cell in Arkham or he might escape during all the mayhem."
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,nluna1975,-2,Mon Jul 13 21:41:42 2015 UTC,"You might be right - but given that we know Batman has some involvement, he's their most popular hero by far, and how heavily the team is tilted towards his villains I'm still fearing the worst. There's no good reason that this needed to be Suicide Squad: Batman Edition."
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,imdwalrus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:37:46 2015 UTC,"""Don't make it through"" in what way? They aren't running free at the end of the film? Since I'm only really familiar with Harley and Joker, and know the others, like Killer Croc, only by name or their appearance in the Arkham Asylum video, I wouldn't have any guesses either way about some of them dying in the film (except Joker has to live, and probably Harley as well). Of course, Joker never goes away for good, so even if he's locked up at the end of the movie you know he'll be back.  Is there a good graphic novel set on Comixology I can check out for Suicide Squad, something to get a grounding in it?"
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,TheCheshireCody,3,Mon Jul 13 21:33:39 2015 UTC,Watch Assault on Arkham for a great cartoon Suicide Squad movie. There are 2 episodes of Arrow devoted to the Suicide Squad and on Justice League Unlimited there was episode devoted to the Suicide Squad called Task Force X which is their official name. The John Ostrander run is the best known version of the SS but the new 52 version introduces Harley into the Squad as well the Comic the Secret 6.
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,nluna1975,3,Mon Jul 13 21:37:32 2015 UTC,"So, the concept of Suicide Squad is basically that villains are being roped into doing black-ops, often unsavory work for the government in exchange for commuted sentences for their previous crimes.  In the comics, they did two things that the movie notably seems NOT to be doing.  First, the squad was made up of minor characters.  The reason why this was important is the second thing...  The members of the Squad were always, always at risk of death.  One of the conceits they've used in the past is to have everyone outfitted with an implant - you violate the mission parameters, try to escape, or just piss off Amanda Waller and an explosive charge goes off in your neck.  Other times, death happens either because of the mission, or just from having a bunch of sociopaths ""working"" together.  The movie obviously can't kill off The Joker or Harley Quinn.  Deadshot is probably safe because of Will Smith.  My issue is that while the rest of the cast could probably be sacrificed, what's the point?  Based on the trailer and the little we know so far it's not likely Killer Croc is going to get much in the way of character development - so why should the audience care if he dies, or if he ""heroically"" sacrifices himself?  This version of the Suicide Squad is saddled with characters that can't die, and characters that could die but wouldn't mean much if they did - and that removes a huge piece of the heart of the concept. Even in Arrow the Squad has already burned through most of its initial members, in only two episodes and one comic.  I know I'm in the minority here but everything I'm seeing about this movie makes me more convinced it would fail. DC really should have waited to establish their world more. Suicide Squad, as an Avengers style team up with characters who had already been in previous movies would have been SO much cooler than this version. So would a version of the movie with more C-listers - maybe sacrifice one of Flash's Rogues to the cause, given he's not likely to get more than that one movie?"

DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,TheCheshireCody,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:32:34 2015 UTC,yo this makes me very happy yo i feel like a child on christmas yo
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,keeprollinrollinyo,-14,Tue Jul 14 08:04:08 2015 UTC,If you pause the trailer at 2.18 you see that Joker is torturing someone. My guess and im almost 100% positive is that someone is Oracle aka Jim Gordans daughter. In the comics Joker paralyzes her and takes nude photos of her giving her to her dad.
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,JuniorSquared,19,Mon Jul 13 20:26:47 2015 UTC,I have a feeling that is Harley.
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,Glaxio,8,Mon Jul 13 20:31:37 2015 UTC,Thats definitely her. Just watch that footage where Joker shoots a guy in the street with his car. Quinzel is dressed up like what we see in the trailer
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,HeWhoHatesPuns,4,Mon Jul 13 20:45:00 2015 UTC,At 1:35 it looks like Joker is the one that throws her onto the table/bed to torture her. It could just be the editing to make it look like the same scene but I think Joker turns Harleen into Harley
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,zombifox,-8,Mon Jul 13 21:54:23 2015 UTC,"It does look like her, but why would he do such a thing? Definetly if we see them together in the trailer. Some of the leaked footage shows him smacking her after she was pointing a gun at him."
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,JuniorSquared,13,Mon Jul 13 20:33:44 2015 UTC,It's not really that far-fetched. Harley has a odd love/hate relationship with the Joker. Will be interesting to see how it plays out on the big screen.
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,Glaxio,0,Mon Jul 13 20:34:53 2015 UTC,yeah it could be like a flashback before they were together.
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,JuniorSquared,2,Mon Jul 13 20:35:29 2015 UTC,Or even a flashback to when they first met. DCCU could be twisting the origin story even more.
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,Glaxio,-4,Mon Jul 13 20:40:36 2015 UTC,Yeah maybe it just wouldnt make much sense to me. The origin story is good as it could be in my opinion.
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,JuniorSquared,2,Mon Jul 13 20:50:01 2015 UTC,"It does look like her, but why would he do such a thing?   Because they're both sadomasochists?"
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,zen_mutiny,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:41:26 2015 UTC,Maybe a flashback before she became Harley Quinn?
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,HeWhoHatesPuns,-2,Mon Jul 13 20:45:59 2015 UTC,Yeah I hope its Oracle though. I think the Harley Quinn Joker origin is good as it can be without him torturing her. Or maybe he stops and doesnt torture her.
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,JuniorSquared,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:51:06 2015 UTC,It could be how Harley is born.
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,JamesTheGent,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:51:54 2015 UTC,What does he do brainwash her? that would be cheaper then her being fascinated by him and falling in love with him.
DC_Cinematic,3d5zle,JuniorSquared,3,Mon Jul 13 20:53:46 2015 UTC,"Maybe he's trying to get her back.  There's a rumor that she leaves him after he kills Robin so maybe it isn't a flashback, but rather his attempt to make her ""his Harley"" again."

It may be a contributing factor to why Bruce wants to stop superman, but he isn't the type of guy who would go to war just over a dream.   I'm not sure if I prefer your theory or the one about the superman army being lex's doing to build the public's mistrust of superman.   I'm not a massive fan of a movie protagonist dreaming of a future and trying to stop it, its something I think that has been been done many times before and can be hit and miss.   I think I prefer the Lex angle, although my problem with that theory is that I think Bruce is smart enough to see through that and not travel to the desert to try and stop them."
DC_Cinematic,3d7ttw,Lurk-man,4,Tue Jul 14 05:07:48 2015 UTC,Maybe bruce travels to the desert to investigate and the lex guards stumble upon a not as sharp as he once was batman and thats what happens.

In the New 52, Harley Quinn was made a member of the Suicide Squad. Only makes sense, given her popularity and background as a psychotherapist.  Once Harley was involved, Joker would be far behind. If there's one person Joker is obsessed with as much as Batman, it is Harley.  So it's only natural that Joker would be part of the film. Besides, when your main characters are bad guys... They need someone truly EVIL to fight.  A match made in Arkham :)"

DC_Cinematic,3d7sni,dc_fanboyforever,4,Tue Jul 14 16:23:50 2015 UTC,Joker is never part of the team! Joker is a distraction to Harley and sometimes SS and Joker cross paths.
DC_Cinematic,3d7sni,KomodoEmiko,3,Tue Jul 14 09:45:34 2015 UTC,"Cool thing to know about this film is that the lineup is a mix between John Ostrander's run from the 80s, which had Rick Flagg, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang and Enchantress, and at one point had Katana and Slipknot as well. The newer line 'IAmLuckyDuckling' has already covered, but there's a good mix. But nothing beats Ostrander's Suicide Squad."
DC_Cinematic,3d7sni,Under_The_Stairs,3,Tue Jul 14 07:57:45 2015 UTC,Others have answered your question. So I'll just recommend you watch the animated Assault On Arkham  film. It's really good and will give you a very clear understanding of the Suicide Squad.

His face is also used breifly as a plot device by Harley in GCPD. In the recent soft relaunch the closest thing is Harley fighting with the Jokers Daughter about him."
DC_Cinematic,3d7z6g,enragedjester,5,Tue Jul 14 05:40:18 2015 UTC,Interesting plot. There's just one thing I'd nitpick about. I don't understand the incessant fan casting of Ron Perlman as Slade. I agree that he possess's the perfect voice for an animated Deathstroke ala mark hamill's joker. Aside from that Ron Perlman is too old and too out of shape.   I can't imagine him doing anything more than what michael hogan did in smallville.   You want someone who can establish an origin as well as reprise the role in future films. If you go Ron Perlman you'll get 1 maybe 2 films out of him tops. And that's if you start immediately.   I like the rest though. I can tell you put a lot of thought into it!
DC_Cinematic,3d7z6g,Rawhoth,2,Tue Jul 14 06:54:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right about Perlman being too old, i was thinking that the character will be wearing the mask most of the time and played by a stuntman/choregrapher  I also have Viggo Mortensen in mind. I mean compare this pic of him with Deathstroke unmasked and plus he's significantly a better actor (no offense Ron)  Yeah you have a good point about having an established origin on him. Perhaps there could be two films with the former being an origin and the latter being my ""pitch""  Edit: Thanks! I've been daydreaming about this for more a few weeks and it's fun just thinking about it. Deathstroke is my favorite villain"

To be honest, r/movies is a joke hence why i always act like a dickhead. Don't take it personally =P. And yeah, Deathstroke is the greatest villain in my opinion."
DC_Cinematic,3d7ye1,temperate,6,Tue Jul 14 05:31:25 2015 UTC,Scene in trailer had her clutching her blade from what it seems doing something she is regretting.
DC_Cinematic,3d7ye1,Mordkay,3,Tue Jul 14 06:04:54 2015 UTC,do you mean her soultaker sword?
DC_Cinematic,3d7ye1,william2181,3,Tue Jul 14 14:35:56 2015 UTC,"I really hope its explained and from the shot of her crying with Soultaker in hand I can only hope. However she is already wearing her red and black SS jacket but either way as long as its explained. Were getting Harleen where shes being tied down by Joker, Deadshot with his daughter, and Enchantress in civilian clothes and the cave. So origins will be present throughout."
DC_Cinematic,3d7ye1,JamesD-TV,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:43:35 2015 UTC,"Oddly phrased way to say it, but I think it looks like she has (or at least believes) a sword more significant than just a way to kill people."
DC_Cinematic,3d7ye1,FlatTire2005,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:26:49 2015 UTC,Just realized from seeing a gif that she's actually putting the sheath on her katana.

DC_Cinematic,3d78ze,S0ckHeaven,2,Tue Jul 14 03:33:54 2015 UTC,I thought it may look like a head... but I don't think it is.

DC_Cinematic,3d783i,MAND3L8R0T,15,Tue Jul 14 01:43:16 2015 UTC,"June Moone is her civilian identity.  Enchantress is her curse, in a Shazam/Captain Marvel type of way. If June says ""Enchantress"" she'll be turned into this nearly uncontrollable, super powerful witch-type figure. In the John Ostrander books especially, the Squad use her as a last resort if the mission gets out of hand, and once Enchantress has done her job, they'll force her to say ""Enchantress"" once more to bring June back. It looks as though they'll be showing her origin in this film, which explains the cave. (I highly recommend those books by the way, especially considering they look like they've served as a major influence for this film)"
DC_Cinematic,3d783i,KomodoEmiko,3,Tue Jul 14 02:08:41 2015 UTC,Is she a part of the Suicide Squad or just a side character?. In the trailer she wasn't in any of the shots with all of them together and i haven't seen her in any of the set photos either.
DC_Cinematic,3d783i,Teyooo,8,Tue Jul 14 02:21:08 2015 UTC,"She's a part of the squad. Big part of the squad.

Aside from those 80s Suicide Squad books and her brief appearance in Justice League Dark, the character really hasn't been served well.   As for other characters, the Squad appeared in a Justice League Unlimited episode called 'Task Force X' which you might enjoy. http://dcau.wikia.com/wiki/Task_Force_X_%28episode%29  The lineup is a little different, but it still has Rick Flagg, Deadshot and Captain Boomerang (The unofficial trinity of the Suicide Squad).  If you want the full Suicide Squad experience before the 2016 film, get into the John Ostrander run!"
DC_Cinematic,3d783i,KomodoEmiko,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:46:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm terribly excited (obviously), and yeah the Arkham games from Rocksteady are fantastic.  The animated film 'Batman: Gotham Knight' is really good if you're looking for something that has both Deadshot and Killer Croc."
DC_Cinematic,3d783i,KomodoEmiko,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:54:08 2015 UTC,Breifly in the New 52 Justice League Dark had to battle an insane Enchantress that became separated from June Moore. Not a crazy ton of her in the New 52 overall though.
DC_Cinematic,3d783i,JamesD-TV,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:00:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've read the June Moon arc, I didn't read further so I thought she later joined the League under Madam Xanadu's influence. Didn't know she was a Suicider though, because the power difference between here and the rest are pretty big."
DC_Cinematic,3d783i,MinodRP,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:34:12 2015 UTC,"This Squad is a mix of some 80's run with her and Katana and such, and the New 52- with Harley and El Diablo. I mean even in the comics a gymnast and a man that releases fire is a big power difference. The extent of what she can do will probably be revealed later. She looked very distressed in her costume and when shes under the pentagram so that evil side could really appear."
DC_Cinematic,3d783i,JamesD-TV,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:46:11 2015 UTC,"She doesn't really appear again unfortunately, Jeff Lemire's JLD stories are pretty interesting though."
DC_Cinematic,3d783i,KomodoEmiko,2,Tue Jul 14 17:57:46 2015 UTC,"Woo! Another fan. I have been so excited for Enchantress since she was announced. When they said thst she will be involved, I have been curious to see if they will be introducing magic (sure,El Diablo,but that a dad different...magix none the less,i suppose). I love Marvel also, but it seems like they have been half assing that side of things.  I feel like Enchantress is the one character in the movie that could open up a whole other world for DC,  and fot that reason, I think she is very valuable. Truthfully, I am hoping she acts as a gateway to introduceone of my favorite characters Etrigan."
DC_Cinematic,3d783i,decrepidactyl,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:01:07 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more! Honestly, when the cast was announced I was most excited for, and still am, Enchantress and Captain Boomerang, I love the costumes that they have for this as well.  There's so many good stories that they could take inspiration from, I'm really hoping for that Justice League Dark film to happen."

DC_Cinematic,3d783i,soulbreaker1418,2,Tue Jul 14 17:28:25 2015 UTC,"Like anything in comics, depends who's writing her. Worth keeping in mind that in the new 52, The justice league couldn't stop her so they called in Constantine and Zatanna and co. to stop her."

DC_Cinematic,3d783i,soulbreaker1418,2,Tue Jul 14 18:26:29 2015 UTC,"If you look at the first official image that was released, Rick Flagg has a chain around her neck, I'm sure she'll play a similar role to what she does in the books- she is the last resort, if things get too out of control, that's probably why she wasn't featured with the team in the trailer."
DC_Cinematic,3d783i,KomodoEmiko,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:55:13 2015 UTC,so pretty much a magical Hulk eh? sounds fun can´t wait to see them shit their pants after they invoked her lol

DC_Cinematic,3d783i,KomodoEmiko,2,Wed Jul 15 02:28:15 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind, also, is that the Enchantress part of June grows more powerful each time she is called upon, and eventually aspects of her begin to take control of June, if that makes any sense."

DC_Cinematic,3d93bw,HEAVEN_OR_HECK,2,Tue Jul 14 18:13:19 2015 UTC,"I really just want them to deliver on Metallo. Corben would be an excellent side villain.  Honestly, I don't see Martian Manhunter in this continuity for a long time, if ever. Not just because of the announced slate, but because it'd be stretching the attention and imagination of the audience. Superman is the resident alien. The Green Lanterns will already bear witness to the higher cosmic mysteries. Manhunter can't really shine with that much waiting to be introduced.  Also, there's the matter of their commitment to a compelling degree of realism. Pulling an alien off of a distant, fictional planet is one thing, but to say a character originated on Mars is closer to home and less plausible given how much we're learning about our red neighbor every year. Keeping Martians out of the DCCU is the safer route."
DC_Cinematic,3d93bw,Justice_Prince,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:36:41 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the side villain is going to be Bizarro.

DC_Cinematic,3d93bw,Justice_Prince,2,Tue Jul 14 15:28:11 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of ways to play out Bizarro.  He doesn't have to be a backwards talking goof ball.  Basically just a botched clone that kryptonite has the reverse effect on, and has incinery breath instead of heat vision."

You'd honestly think the positive reaction it got would make them release it and put a stopper in the leaked footage circulating.  Edit: Ayer just released the teaser. My point still stands though. Until SDCC releases everything to the public, even a day or two after they show it, leaking will continue to happen."

DC_Cinematic,3d5xv9,BaltimoreProud,5,Mon Jul 13 20:07:00 2015 UTC,"Until Comic-Con catches up with the time this will continue to happen. What is odd to me is that they released the BvS trailer almost immediately after the panel ended and everyone could see it in HD. At the very least they should stream the panels live. They also did it right with the release of the BvS teaser in March, giving away the posters and letting everyone that went see the movie a week early is a great reward for the die-hards.  Do what Star Wars did and give the people that waited an exclusive experience that cannot be pirated.  Taking everyone in Hall H to a Star Wars concert is AMAZING and rewards people that are there with a once in a lifetime experience."

DC_Cinematic,3d4kqd,mrthewhite,7,Mon Jul 13 16:39:55 2015 UTC,When I saw that in the trailer it reminded me of Red Son Batman
DC_Cinematic,3d4kqd,decrepidactyl,3,Mon Jul 13 13:57:23 2015 UTC,"Stupid sexy Batfleck. I loved this sequence. It reminded me of the ending location of Watchmen with Rorscach & Night Owl. Night Owl in his white thermal coat with his goggles on. I love that Snyder is not affraid to give the costumed heroes some accessories, and still keep it asthetically pleasing."

DC_Cinematic,3d89el,mdietrich54,4,Tue Jul 14 07:39:58 2015 UTC,"I like the Jason theory, and so far it's the strongest one I've read, but I think the most likely scenario is that it's from someone who has lost their family or at least, for the sake of this plot, it will be.  Jason could always come back into play for another film."
DC_Cinematic,3d89el,KomodoEmiko,2,Tue Jul 14 07:51:19 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think it was Jason."
DC_Cinematic,3d89el,KingofZombies,-1,Tue Jul 14 16:46:05 2015 UTC,"It might actually be from Jason but I have a slightly different spin on it. I think this Batman has lost everyone by Man of Steel. I think Dick dies in the building that Zod destroys, Jason was killed by the Joker (basically confirmed now) and that Tim has quit (evidence given by his staff on the Robin costume). As expected, Jason is around as the Red Hood and would know Dick's identity so he writes the paper.  I actually think there could be a good sequence in Suicide Squad where Batman confronts the Joker and asks him about the newspaper, only for the Joker to say ""That wasn't me."" Teases Red Hood for the Batman solo film"
DC_Cinematic,3d6pga,patred6,3,Mon Jul 13 23:15:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it makes me think Harley is the one Joker is speaking to at the end of the trailer.  Especially considering he's wearing the one purple glove.."

DC_Cinematic,3d6lf1,dc_fanboyforever,3,Mon Jul 13 22:44:23 2015 UTC,"Nolan movies were quite brilliant they were made in the medieval ages of DC adaptations   wut? IMO, Nolan brought Batman and DC out of the medieval dark age. What preceded The Dark Knight Trilogy was Batman & Robin, Steel, and Catwoman. Not exactly inspired films.  I'd consider the 90s a dark age and Nolan the bringer of enlightenment and herald of the new age. All hail the Nolan!   TDK broke the first gate of Modern age   Annnnnd now that I read the last portion of that comment I wasted my time typing up my response.  That said, the recent slate of TV shows and films is fucking sweeeet."
DC_Cinematic,3d6lf1,rustedmachines,2,Tue Jul 14 01:44:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah! TV is on a different level right now! Of course, Nolan deserves credit. He was like Copernicus of DC films, he was the renaissance man. But Geoff Johns on TV and Snyder on movies are like Galleleo and Newton!"
DC_Cinematic,3d6lf1,Markkjac,2,Tue Jul 14 01:54:46 2015 UTC,"The animations have always been outstanding since the Bruce Timm era, the last 5 years are no exception. With a straight adaptation of TDKR and popular stories like Tower of Babel, they have their animation field down. Thats what I find funny, I've seen a bunch of Marvel animated (Not trying to be a fanboy) but they just lack the emotion and charm of the DC ones. Interesting how they each have their ups and downs."
DC_Cinematic,3d6lf1,KomodoEmiko,2,Tue Jul 14 05:04:49 2015 UTC,"I think I'd attribute that to the fact that there's more room for alternative story telling with DC than there is with Marvel, not a knock at them at all by the way, they're just different."

DC_Cinematic,3d66t2,Fuel-For-Life,7,Mon Jul 13 20:57:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's clearly her. By the looks of it, Joker tortures her while she's still working at Arkham.  It starts to make me question if the ""really, really bad"" scene is actually Robin or if it's during this scene with Harley."
DC_Cinematic,3d66t2,Nickerdoodle,9,Mon Jul 13 21:01:11 2015 UTC,Yeah...not buying any of the Robin rumors. It doesnt make much sense to just throw that in.          It seems like the event happened a long time ago which makes sense since Joker has a Robin tattoo on his right arm.          The scene wouldnt have that much of an impact if Batman played a small role. It would work great for a solo Batman movie though.
DC_Cinematic,3d66t2,romanius24,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:01:48 2015 UTC,"I mean, it made some sense originally. We know what kind of Batman we're getting, so it wasn't much of a stretch to start theorizing it was Robin, but certainly now that we have more information from the teaser, that rumour will start to fade away."
DC_Cinematic,3d66t2,Nickerdoodle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:21:29 2015 UTC,"what i never got of those rumors is why DC would use that scene in this movie, that should have happened many years ago, now being Harley the tortured would make the movie a lot more personal"
DC_Cinematic,3d66t2,soulbreaker1418,2,Mon Jul 13 22:39:40 2015 UTC,"I certainly agree, but we do know Batman has some involvement in SS, so it could've been a possibility as a flashback to bring us in a on a really dark moment with Joker, which would then flesh out what we saw in BvS (if it doesn't get fleshed out in BvS on its own)  Still, I prefer it being Harley as it'll build their relationship more."
DC_Cinematic,3d66t2,Nickerdoodle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:57:25 2015 UTC,"as far as we know Batman will be as a cameo, and again, that´s a huge Batman/Joker moment but why would be important for a Suicide Squad movie? zero chance Waller wants to rescue Robin, no other character is influenced by it happening, and really it is not necesary. On the other hand Harley being there makes a lot of sense storywise if Joker is the big bad"
DC_Cinematic,3d66t2,soulbreaker1418,2,Tue Jul 14 00:45:23 2015 UTC,"Well we know all of this after the fact, I'm still talking about when it was merely a theory.  IF they did go the Robin route, it seems like a pretty big scene to introduce this new Joker and how dark and twisted he is. Even now we don't know Batman's full involvement, he could be in a couple of scenes, he could be in one, we won't know until next year.  I'm just saying that prior to getting the teaser, I did think it could've been Robin, but I'm glad it's Harley."
DC_Cinematic,3d66t2,Nickerdoodle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:47:15 2015 UTC,"that´s fair, just in i apologize i didn´t mind to attack anyone just saying that even before the teaser it didn´t make sense(to me), the Occam´s razr is always useful trying to predict a story like this"
DC_Cinematic,3d66t2,soulbreaker1418,2,Tue Jul 14 01:58:33 2015 UTC,"Nah man, it's cool. I understand your point too, and in hindsight, it makes sense. There's a lot Suicide Squad has to cover as it is, and isn't truly a ""Batman"" movie, so the Robin scene wouldn't fit.   I guess there's just so much to look forward to that the possibilities are endless!"
DC_Cinematic,3d66t2,Nickerdoodle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:05:43 2015 UTC,yes sir! now that i think about it a better possibility would have been Oracle than Robin
DC_Cinematic,3d66t2,soulbreaker1418,6,Tue Jul 14 02:10:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it's a flashback to when Harley first met Joker.   But I have my doubts aswell"
DC_Cinematic,3d66t2,Nickerdoodle,2,Mon Jul 13 21:02:09 2015 UTC,"Rewatching it, it's more than likely Harley being tortured and not Robin. There's other evidence such as the panda with the gun, he's present when Joker has his arms extended in the office, which is where we also see Harley get tackled onto a table."

DC_Cinematic,3d66t2,zombifox,2,Mon Jul 13 22:37:04 2015 UTC,I think the Joker is torturing her as well. At 1:35 in the trailer it looks like Joker is the on that breaks in and throws Harleen down to a bed/table to torture her.
DC_Cinematic,3d66t2,Flash_95,2,Mon Jul 13 21:56:16 2015 UTC,"You can kinda see Harleen's glasses at the ""I'm not gonna kill ya"" bit, by Joker's left hand  Imgur"

Whos touching her - Joker with no shirt on and purple nitrile gloves on, which we see clearly in the close ups.  why the fuck do people think the ""gonna hurt you real bad"" is being said to robin..."
DC_Cinematic,3d66t2,JamesD-TV,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:42:11 2015 UTC,"People instantly assumed Robin because of the suit in BvS without taking a closer look. As much as I want other Robins explored BvS is trying to create a universe and I dont feel theres time for the side plot of Robin. And Suicide Squad has to explore 9 members- since they probably wont appear for a while after this outside maybe Harley or something, Amanda Waller, and Joker. But I guess the solo Batman film needs to have some type of plot."

DC_Cinematic,3d6kqt,FlatTire2005,2,Mon Jul 13 23:51:01 2015 UTC,"agreed, Joker never has been the type of ""let´s destroy the world"" kind of villain, if he´s the main bad someone is behind him(R´as maybe?)"
DC_Cinematic,3d6kqt,soulbreaker1418,5,Tue Jul 14 18:33:16 2015 UTC,"That would be awesome. And his army of Ninja Man-Bats! Even though the general audience has no context for Man-Bat..... Okay, but I want Ninja Man-Bats eventually on screen."
DC_Cinematic,3d6kqt,FlatTire2005,3,Tue Jul 14 18:41:53 2015 UTC,"Possibly, but I think we're going to see a LOT of morally grey characters in this film, more that we've seen in a big budget comic film since probably Watchmen. That being said, Joker will def be a primary antagonist at some point during the film. However, everyone on the Squad, and Amanda Waller, are all not very good people in one way or another. I think we're gonna see a bunch of power hungry government pencil pushers coerce a bunch of sociopathic killers, and violent freaks into hunting down an uncontrollable entity (Enchantress) that's inhabiting an unstable woman (June Moone), and they'll be thwarted by both their employers (Waller and co.), the Joker, AND themselves.  My theory is that Enchantress/June Moone, is NOT a part of the Squad in the beginning, but is instead the target/goal.   Waller pulls strings and transfers each of the future members of the squad to the ""Hole"" so that she can have easy access to them. There she promises each of them something to convince them to go along with her plan, and/or plants a microbomb in their heads like in the comics.These criminal members of the squad will include Harley, Deadshot, Croc, and Katana (maybe). The more paramilitary/merc types (Rick, Slipknot, and that other guy) may or may not be locked up as well. They could just be paid mercenaries (ala DCs Blackwater) that are supposed to accompany the Squad.  So why would Waller need the freaks to go along for the ride, why not just send some hired guns in? Because, June Moone has control over a source of massive power in the form of the demon/entity possessing her and Waller doesn't want it to fall into the wrong hands (or wants it for the government) and knows she needs people of extraordinary power to help retrieve it. It could also be that June Moone is being held in Arkham and the Joker has taken Arkham over. Which is why Waller would want Harley along, thinking Harley has some insight into the man, or some kinda influence over him.   In the end this will all be a disaster in some form. Harley will most certainly be conflicted about returning to Arkham (Where she met the Joker and where she was ""born"" so to speak) and will be influenced by the Joker."
DC_Cinematic,3d6kqt,Talking_Asshole,2,Tue Jul 14 19:36:06 2015 UTC,I think he is a big part of the movie but there seems to be another threat. ( larger scale)
DC_Cinematic,3d6kqt,romanius24,2,Mon Jul 13 23:09:43 2015 UTC,"I think at this point it would be safe to assume he's in a more 'locked away' Hannibal Lector role for this, aside from during the flashbacks or what have you."
DC_Cinematic,3d6kqt,KomodoEmiko,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:22:05 2015 UTC,Well we have batman chasing him on the car so it is possible that batman catches him and locks him back up. That would fit your scenario.
DC_Cinematic,3d6kqt,wellbluebanana,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:43:24 2015 UTC,Enchantress is probably seem like the big bad during the movie but Joker will probably manipulate her or be behind it in some way.
DC_Cinematic,3d4qms,azrael96,7,Mon Jul 13 14:45:08 2015 UTC,Is there any confirmation that Jenna Malone's actually in the movie and wasn't just visiting Snyder on the set?
DC_Cinematic,3d4qms,50ShadesofYay,2,Mon Jul 13 18:47:39 2015 UTC,No confirmation. WB hasn't said anything and she wasn't in the trailer. At this point I think we have to assume she was just visiting. Though I would love it if she turned out to be Oracle.

DC_Cinematic,3d4qms,HowieGaming,-4,Mon Jul 13 21:02:01 2015 UTC,wat.  OP said   Full credits to Zack Snyder and his creative team   Did Zack Snyder make the trailer? No. The editor did. The editor made a smart non-spoilery trailer.
DC_Cinematic,3d4qms,RandomDude94,7,Mon Jul 13 21:05:16 2015 UTC,What? The editor is part of his creative team. And I don't doubt Zack is heavily involved in the trailer-making process.
DC_Cinematic,3d4qms,LasDen,2,Tue Jul 14 00:29:29 2015 UTC,Probably because it has so much plot going. WW's plot. Batman's plot. Luthor's plot and the titular BvS plot. They will be connected in the end but thats more than enough for a 3 min long trailer to leave questions....

DC_Cinematic,3d4qms,FlatTire2005,2,Mon Jul 13 17:00:38 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it does show the Batwing flying over a destroyed looking city and then Superman flying and shooting his heat vision with a destroyed city below/behind him. I doubt Batman and Superman would cause so much damage during their fight.  I don't like Doomsday as a character, mind you. But it indicates there will be some sort of physical threat. If it is Doomsday, I'm sure it'll be cool even though I just said I don't really care for him."
DC_Cinematic,3d4qms,mrthewhite,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:30:25 2015 UTC,Or it could be the remains of metropolis.  I don't know how long this takes place after MoS but unless it's 10+ years later metropolis would look much the same as it would after the fight with Zod.  Look how long it took to clean up Ground Zero and that was just a couple buildings.

DC_Cinematic,3d4qms,mrthewhite,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:42:22 2015 UTC,Those scenes are clearly a fight between Batman and superman and maybe Wonder Woman.  It's likely it takes place in the ruins of Metropolis. There's clearly a scene where superman hits Batman with heat vision and the wonder woman fight scenes look to be in the exact same area and time.
DC_Cinematic,3d4qms,FlatTire2005,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:57:47 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying is, while damage to Metropolis may still be around, the damaged areas wouldn't still be on fire years later. And there's no way a fight between Batman and Superman would (re)destroy such a gigantic area. Pause the trailer when it shows the Batwing; you'll see what I'm talking about. There's a huge portion of the city that's on fire the way it was when Zod invaded; there's no way the Batman vs Superman fight gets that huge.  Not saying it's Doomsday, but it's a power on the level of Doomsday."
DC_Cinematic,3d4qms,mrthewhite,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:03:30 2015 UTC,And what I'm saying is a fight between the 3 people we see fighting could easily cause some additional damage in an already destroyed area without any external source necessary.

DC_Cinematic,3d4qms,TotallyNotKanye,4,Mon Jul 13 17:17:21 2015 UTC,He's been heavily rumored by multiple outlets and since a lot of these rumors have been true I strongly believe Doomsday will be in the movie.
DC_Cinematic,3d4qms,TheWruceBayne,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:44:25 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't really call it ""heavily"" rumored. And these outlets are not exactly big guns in the internet entertainment world.

It isn't strong evidence, but it's something.  Personally hoping he's not in the film, but the shot of Zod's corpse in the trailer gels with most of the rumors surrounding him."

Grispo has had me pumped since he said this back in January.   Now Batman is going to fight the way I’ve always dreamed seeing him fight… he’s a character so prepared in martial arts that you can do a lot of things with him, but filmmakers usually don’t go all the way with it. Even in the last Nolan movies the action scenes aren’t very good from a technical, martial arts point of view to things like choreography, filming, bad camera movements… But hey, don’t get me wrong, Nolan is great, my hat’s off to him. He makes fascinating stories, but I think that he did not pay too much attention to the fights. Those are the kind of details that Zack, being so physical himself, loves preparing. I think there’s going to be a big difference when you see these Batman fights in comparison to the previous ones."

I certainly don't want the DCCU tied down by four seasons of Arrow and two seasons of Flash, nor do I want Arrow and Flash to avoid the better story-lines so they don't have to be addressed in the films (à la Agents of SHIELD). It's also my personal opinion that most of the actors on Arrow and Flash are no where near good enough to be in the films."

Id prefer to see Hal be the established mentor, John and Guy being a bit younger  than him, and maybe Kyle being the ""new kid"" who's the srar possibly? Let Hal turn evil and go all Parallax by the end. Everything I could want in a GL movie."

If I had read his comics in the 90s when I was younger I probably would have loved his attitude by I didn't read anything of his until after Kyle was GL (which is when I got into Green Lantern) and I find Guy incredibly tiresome.  I would love a Kyle focused movie, but wouldn't mind Hal either.  John I find kinda boring as a character but not offensive so I wouldn't mind seeing him in the movie but prefer it wasn't all about him."
DC_Cinematic,3d44vd,mrthewhite,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:57:39 2015 UTC,"Have you read his story in Red Lanterns and future's end?? I didn't like Guy at ALL until Red Lanterns. I thought he was a superfluous, jock-type that had no real purpose. I mean, we already have hard-ass Jon Stewart, did we really need another one? Boy, was I wrong about Guy... I now love Guy Gardner way more than I've ever loved Hal, Jon or Kyle.  Now, with that being said, I would hate it if Matt Damon were Guy Gardner. Guy is supposed to be a former linebacker turned cop. Matt Damon (at 5'10"" and 190lbs on a GOOD day) could never pass for a linebacker.   My vote is Rob Kazinsky from Pacific Rim.

DC_Cinematic,3d1uyb,BlandrewLSX,6,Sun Jul 12 22:16:42 2015 UTC,"I got super hyped when I saw this. Though, the more I studied the shots individually, the more I found it didn't fully sync. Hear me out...  In the Man of Steel frame, we see zod make a set of deliberate movements. There is no wavering in his pattern at all. It goes (zod's perspective) up and slightly left, down, hard sweep left and slightly down.   It is obvious that from where Bruce is standing in BvS frame, the perspective will be reversed. This is how the movements appeared to me... (From Bruce Wayne's perspective) up and hard right (zod's left), quick down, then a sort of quick right(z's left), up, left (z r) circular motion. Following zod's movements, it should go up and slightly right, down, then hard right and slightly down. I think that is where I see the most difference.   All that said, I'm not dogging the scene or effort to match the scenes together. Just thought I'd share what I noticed."
DC_Cinematic,3d1uyb,caughtupincrossfire,5,Mon Jul 13 05:27:47 2015 UTC,"It looks almost right.  When zod looks down, in MoS, his laser is on 100% of the time, in BvS, it is like he looks down without the laser vision."

DC_Cinematic,3d6kuw,PaulEDangerously,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:40:13 2015 UTC,Well the big one is that it completely screwed u their marketing strategy. DC will usually just release a teaser that shows little to no footage and start slowly rolling out posters. This is so they can slowly build up hype and keep it going for an entire year. Making the next reveal bigger and better than the last.
DC_Cinematic,3d6kuw,Under_The_Stairs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:20:29 2015 UTC,"They say that they released the trailer for Suicide Squad simply because they didn't want the film to be portrayed bad by the video quality. But really its kinda given that SOMEONE is gonna show it, because more than a few hundred are gonna wanna see it. But the trailer already has nearly 13 million views and is well recieved, so in the end I guess the publicity they ended up with was worth it. And if they werent ready for all the world to see it- they maybe could have had an even more explosive thing ready for SDCC."
DC_Cinematic,3d6k5t,x1_cygnus,7,Mon Jul 13 22:34:50 2015 UTC,We don't know it was Superman blasting heat vision at Batman.  I'm sure it's just for the advertisement of Batman V Superman (I hope). It's like when Age Of Ultron (the trailer) showed that scene of the Avengers dying and it ended up being a stupid dream scene instead of some real Ultron kicking ass.
DC_Cinematic,3d6k5t,Fuel-For-Life,2,Mon Jul 13 22:52:26 2015 UTC,Looking at it again that blast actually looks too think to be Supermans heat vission.  Looks thinker then Zods too.  I think we may very well be looking at Bizarros incinary breath.

It just would not make sense for him to go through this whole paying for his crimes story arch thing just to have him in the next scene be blasting Bruce with heat vision.

DC_Cinematic,3d6k5t,heybuddyitsme,5,Mon Jul 13 23:45:12 2015 UTC,"While we yet not know him and batman's fight, Ma Kent is this: superman saved the world from Zod and his soldiers but in the process thousands were killed, a city was left in absolute rubble. Clark wants to help humans, show then they can achieve more. As you saw in the trailer, people hate/fear him so they reject him. It goes back to what PA Kent was saying in the first film. And his fears coming to reality.  Sorry, at work, someone can better  articulate what I'm trying to say"
DC_Cinematic,3d6k5t,Lurk-man,5,Mon Jul 13 23:01:01 2015 UTC,"I agree. I'm not a parent, but I know parents want their kids to be happy no matter what they do.   If you're Clark's mum, you want him to save people if it makes him happy, but I'm sure he has his own doubts on what is the right thing to do. It's only natural for him to doubt himself when he sees people literally protesting against him.   Ma's comments are spot on.  You don't owe this world anything, you never did."

DC_Cinematic,3d6k5t,lewinskys_ex,7,Mon Jul 13 23:47:02 2015 UTC,The fact that he is a hero and uses his powers for good is impressive.(same with any superhero) but its not his job.
DC_Cinematic,3d6k5t,lewinskys_ex,5,Tue Jul 14 00:00:28 2015 UTC,"that whole ""with great power..."" shit is so generalized. That shit is fake, it's never that black and white. I'm not trying to sound like an ass but we need to get over that shit. No parent is going to consistently tell their kid to go risk their lives just cause they have power. It feels more right for this fine ass ma kent to just tell it like it is"
DC_Cinematic,3d6k5t,MuddFishh,-1,Tue Jul 14 00:55:05 2015 UTC,"I don't know. Thats like saying ""Man, uncle Ben should have just told Peter like it is. Fuck it, do what you think is right, what do I know?"" Great advice... Ma and Pa Kent's jobs, from a story telling stand point, should be to instill a good moral foundation. Strive to do what is RIGHT. Help one another. As every human should feel its there job to help one another. thats the whole point. And I know a lot of people out there think thats bullshit and fake and not real.. well no shit. He is SUPERMAN... and Comic book hero. He is supposed to be better than us to give us something to strive to. He is a beacon of HOPE for humanity. and his parents are supposed to give him that understanding."
DC_Cinematic,3d6k5t,FlatTire2005,2,Tue Jul 14 01:47:28 2015 UTC,"Yea i get that but its a cliched* thing. Its a mom reassuring her child that its his decision to make on whats right. I think thats way better than ""you have the power and you have to do this"". There are way more gray areas than that to just make it so simple"
DC_Cinematic,3d6k5t,Lurk-man,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:00:34 2015 UTC,"What Ma Kent is saying is ""You saved them, now they're treating you like shit.

Sure, it might not be a typical heart-warming speech but it sure catches me in the feels."
DC_Cinematic,3d6k5t,KingofZombies,3,Tue Jul 14 01:01:54 2015 UTC,"I think those are two different scenes. The city is on fire behind Superman when he blasts the heat vision, which I don't think the fight would cause that much damage. Then Batman grapples away to dodge heat vision, but I think this is a different scene. The building is probably abandoned in a place where they are planning to renovate (like in Dark Knight Returns).  As for Martha, she wants what's best for her son. Would you imagine your own mother telling you to do stuff that could kill you or cause you huge amount of distress? Then why would Martha? She's saying ""live your life, be happy, do what you want to do"" just like Jonathan did in the first one. Never understood that complaint. They just want what's best for him."
DC_Cinematic,3d6k5t,Lurk-man,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:55:20 2015 UTC,"Agree with both your points.   The destructed city around superman looks like the same scene as the wonder woman action scenes.    I doubt superman and wonder woman will fight each other, as that would take away from the whole batman V superman, so maybe they are fighting the big bad guy at the end of the movie (with batman help, who contribution isn't shown in the trailer)."
DC_Cinematic,3d6k5t,AbstractAtlantean,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:34:33 2015 UTC,"I think that Ma kent was trying to say that Superman must be a superhero or just a human, that there isn't middle terms for him."

DC_Cinematic,3d396x,TheAmbitious1,19,Mon Jul 13 04:28:36 2015 UTC,I think it's a mistake. Comic Con should be the launching pad for the trailers but they should be shown to everyone eventually.  Everyone has a camera so the footage Was it recorded with a flip phone? was clearly going to be leaked. I believe one upload has over 5 million views. They could of made some nice lunch money if they released it.   Maybe they'll change their minds and release it on August 5th. -1 Year Anniversary? ha..ha...ha

DC_Cinematic,3d396x,TripleSkeet,2,Mon Jul 13 06:22:12 2015 UTC,The first Ant-Man teaser came out in January and the movie comes out in July.  Deadpool first teaser is coming out next month. The movie comes out in February.   SS comes out next August. 13 months before the movie is way early for SS.
DC_Cinematic,3d396x,S0ckHeaven,3,Mon Jul 13 06:28:08 2015 UTC,"I think people think something very different when they hear ""exclusive trailer."" For anyone dying to have it released publicly, did you actually go and look at the footage? It's mostly dialogue and faces with a few shots that are cool, but that's not most of it. Everything on it was done in camera, which means there are no effects shots. Why would any studio want to show off their 100+ million dollar movie without a single effects shot?   These trailers are not made for public consumption. Go look at the difference in the cutting and footage between the Suicide Squad and the BvS trailer. One was clearly made to be seen by the public, one was not.   We have to start understanding that the panel and the appearance, of which the footage is a part, is a marketing tool. The existence, the proof positive, and the big time interview in front of fans, that's what's supposed to get people excited. Seeing an unfinished sizzle reel (Remember guys, Suicide Squad isn't finished filming yet. In what world has any movie got a real trailer before it finished filming?) does not do its job.   And no, they're not accepting inevitable that it's supposed to leak. The studios and Comic-Con are trying their damndest to keep it from leaking, clearly. Because they don't want it to leak. The studios and the directors want to control the way their film is seen and perceived and I don't think that's unreasonable."
DC_Cinematic,3d396x,wagnerelli12,3,Mon Jul 13 14:22:43 2015 UTC,Welp! Guess this was wrong xD
DC_Cinematic,3d396x,Fuel-For-Life,2,Tue Jul 14 00:46:36 2015 UTC,I'm surprised so many people thought we'd get the SS trailer. The second I saw WB post the BvS trailer I knew we weren't getting SS anytime soon. They'd be stupid to put them both out at the same time and have them cannibalize each other's momentum
DC_Cinematic,3d396x,50ShadesofYay,3,Mon Jul 13 18:51:46 2015 UTC,"Good,it makes sense. If it was an exclusive, than it should stay as one. I want to see it in HQ aswell but WB doesn't owe us anything. Oh well."

We, as customers, have the right to demand whatever we want, and they, as a business that wants our money, should probably listen, at least some of the time.

[Some] People now have an 'idea' because of those set photo/video leaks.   They are not even done filming,they will be here until the end of August. The teaser will probably be in the fall. Also, I don't think there will be much selling at all. You show Will Smith, Batman,Joker and let them know it is in the same universe as Man Of Steel/Batman V Superman, the general audience will show up. The film is about 13 months away , we didn't even get a Batman V. Superman trailer until the 11 month mark."

DC_Cinematic,3d2j04,S0ckHeaven,11,Mon Jul 13 02:45:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel OP is just stating the obvious. MOS is most definitely a cultural by-product of 9/11, and the BvS flashback reiterates and owns that echo in a big way.

It's buildings crumbling and falling down, that's about as deep as the connection goes."

So for us, jokes like that don't have a ""too soon"" or ""too late"" following them, but if OP is North-American, I do think that joke is still a ""too soon"", simply because the US is still very much affected by the 9/11 events.

I could see the similarities but I just thought the 911 gave a basis on how to make it look realistic (I don't think we would have imagined a cloud of dust like this before 911)  As for the taste of it, we have a pretty strong sense of gallows humour here so its not really an issue here.  (I spent my birthday in New York the day after that guy shot up the Batman movie, and my wife had unknowingly ordered a Batman singing telegram - we don't have them here.

I though ""holy hell this is exactly like in the comics when Superman fights a heavy hitter"". Then again when I hear ""nine eleven"" or see ""911"" I think of Porsche, unless we are already on the topic of terrorism."
DC_Cinematic,3d2j04,musicisfree91,3,Mon Jul 13 05:51:32 2015 UTC,I hope I didn't come off as insensitive but given the things we've seen in film since 2001 hardly anything evokes images of 9/11 besides 9/11 footage itself or planes flying into buildings. But especially in a comic book world (despite the hyper realistic nature of it) I'm just sucked into that world and don't associate any real world terrorist attacks while watching Superman and Zod duke it out. I'm 26 btw

DC_Cinematic,3d6axs,KomodoEmiko,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:19:20 2015 UTC,"The cave looks to be ALL high tech from the trailer. I would like to see part of the cave be more of an actual cave.   Nolan's batcave was probably too much cave,  not enough tech.   Burton's cave was a good mix I think of tech and natural elements."

DC_Cinematic,3d6axs,ultrasargent,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:21:16 2015 UTC,What am I meant to be looking at?
DC_Cinematic,3d3atm,StormJoseph,4,Mon Jul 13 04:32:38 2015 UTC,I am very interested to hear others opinions on this image. This was taken from a cleaned up version of the SS trailer leak. The image is from about 60% of the way through the trailer. There is a gloved hand caressing the face and the next shot is of the same gloved hand swinging what looks like a cane or perhaps a crowbar. I may just be seeing what I want to see but to me this image is from the Death of Robin sequence rumored to be in the film. Thoughts?
DC_Cinematic,3d3atm,CobaltMoon98,3,Mon Jul 13 04:35:57 2015 UTC,"Eh, actually I think I'm wrong on this one. I thought I was seeing a mask curve over the eyes (Robin), but it has been pointed out to me that this may be a refraction of light coming through a pair of glasses. Probably from Harley Quinzel's torture/transformation."
DC_Cinematic,3d3atm,harleyquinn1216,3,Mon Jul 13 04:43:18 2015 UTC,"I think the Harley point is right. They focused on her a lot in the trailer. Also, I think I can make out some blond hair under her chin."
DC_Cinematic,3d3atm,legopieface,3,Mon Jul 13 07:59:56 2015 UTC,definitely looks like dr. harleen
DC_Cinematic,3d60q3,Bodie293,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:14:54 2015 UTC,If you pause the trailer at 2.18 you see that Joker is torturing someone. My guess and im almost 100% positive is that someone is Oracle aka Jim Gordans daughter. In the comics Joker paralyzes her and takes nude photos of her giving her to her dad.
DC_Cinematic,3d3ch7,Lurk-man,6,Mon Jul 13 04:49:23 2015 UTC,"I think if they portray Bruce as this it would be awesome, and a stark difference from how we've seen Bruce portrayed in the past. If you think back to the Nolan trilogy when we saw Bruce Wayne he was a rich, playboy, asshole and seeing a hero both in and out of the suit would be different. It'll be interesting to see if he is seen by the public that way."
DC_Cinematic,3d3ch7,sandspod,6,Mon Jul 13 05:35:27 2015 UTC,"You're right, Nolan's Bruce want very hands on with the exception of a couple of small scenes I can remember (both being in The Dark Knight, firstly taking out an armed henchmen before going into his ""panic room"" and secondly allowing the trick driver to hit him Lamborghini to protect the guy trying to expose his identity.)   It looks like we may get to see Bruce get his hands dirty. At least I really hope so.   Also is a great opportunity for Affleck to show his physical ability, which will help the audience believe he is capable to pull off the stunts when in costume also."
DC_Cinematic,3d3ch7,MiQBonafide,4,Mon Jul 13 05:50:24 2015 UTC,In the trailer there was a shirtless guy pulling in a rope. That was Ben.
DC_Cinematic,3d3ch7,CobaltMoon98,3,Mon Jul 13 06:02:42 2015 UTC,"I noticed that, and the first thing that came to mind was that there were no scares on his back!  That made me think it might have been a flash back, only because an older Bruce would have been through some rough stuff which would have resulted in scares.   Either that, or is a scene of him training again to get back into peak physical shape.   I hope it's the former."
DC_Cinematic,3d3ch7,jasonhaven,3,Mon Jul 13 06:28:38 2015 UTC,Watch it again and look at his right shoulder blade. There is a round scar which appears to be a from a bullet.
DC_Cinematic,3d3ch7,mrthewhite,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:54:55 2015 UTC,"I really liked how The Dark Knight showed a fair amount of scars on Bruce, especially his back.   a) is a great mix to the comics,  b) it does how human he is."
DC_Cinematic,3d3ch7,mrthewhite,5,Tue Jul 14 00:24:22 2015 UTC,"My favorite scene was him running into the cloud/holding the child. It did a wonderful job showing just how small/human he is at the end of the day... and yet he's still going to do whatever he can to help.   As far as Nolan's series, I think if there was a scene similar to that, they would have done the same. There were a few times he acted ""heroically"" without the suit on. They just weren't presented with the same sort of opportunity, because Nolan's world, there were no superhumans."
DC_Cinematic,3d65rv,italyprayer,-1,Mon Jul 13 20:49:37 2015 UTC,"Okay, call me a moron, but the thing I've never quite understood about this movie is how it will be Batman-free, considering it features several of Batman's biggest villains. If it does feature Batman, how does it fit into the BvS storyline? If it doesn't, then who is on top of the car in the middle of the trailer?  Obviously I'm not familiar with the SS comics. Be gentle....  Trailer looks awesome, by the way."
DC_Cinematic,3d65rv,TheCheshireCody,2,Mon Jul 13 20:59:56 2015 UTC,"That is Batman on top of the car, and I'm guessing this movie is set after the events of BvS since Batman is retired at the beginning of that movie and he is running around Gotham on top of Joker's car. That scene could also be a flashback but Amanda Waller talks about Superman in the trailer so it's at least sometime after MoS."
DC_Cinematic,3d65rv,invisiblack,0,Mon Jul 13 21:13:29 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. I am at work, so had to watch it without sound. I still seems odd that this movie (apparently) exists outside of the main thrust of the DCU films, which are leading towards the Justice League, but clearly has some crossover via Batman with that series of films. Or do you suppose this is like a Guardians Of The Galaxy thing, where it seems unconnected until you actually see it?"
DC_Cinematic,3d65rv,TheCheshireCody,2,Mon Jul 13 21:26:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly like Guardians of the Galaxy, but with more crossover since Superman is mentioned and Batman physically appears in the movie."

DC_Cinematic,3d3j5q,caughtupincrossfire,8,Mon Jul 13 06:29:45 2015 UTC,I would love if they have like two very small scenes that show he is in a comatose state and then Batman shows up on screen and he snaps out of it. The Dark Knight Returns style.  Doubt it though.
DC_Cinematic,3d3j5q,TronVin,2,Mon Jul 13 13:35:13 2015 UTC,I had a though this morning. What if BvS opens with Batman apprehending the joker and in the course of this action knocks all of his teeth out...Hence the chrome in SS.    Wishful thinking I know but I think it would make a pretty sweet tie in.
DC_Cinematic,3d3j5q,iinverno,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:45:47 2015 UTC,"They stated that the chrome is just caps and not replacements for Batman knocking his teeth out. Fits in better to his street gangster aesthetic with the tattoos, muscles, and car."
DC_Cinematic,3d3j5q,JamesD-TV,2,Tue Jul 14 18:21:36 2015 UTC,Maybe a flashback but even that would be too much and take away from the story

DC_Cinematic,3d3j5q,decrepidactyl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:30:50 2015 UTC,Exactly. He is a large presence and it would take attention away from the batman and superman storyline
DC_Cinematic,3d3j5q,Mudkip4567,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:51:26 2015 UTC,"Well if it's true that Robin is dead and is the reason Bats is retired at the start of BvS, it would be pretty natural to show some piece of what drove him to retirement in the first place."
DC_Cinematic,3d3j5q,alrighthamilton,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:26:17 2015 UTC,"I am not saying I wouldn't love it, because I probably would. Like I said, I think they have a lot to cover, adding flash back scenes takes time away from that. I think I would prefer if it was a dialogue piece, between Bruce and Alfred. Something maybe a long the lines of when Bruce is training again and Alfred says "" [Insert Robin Name] was not your fault,master Bruce "" - Bruce replies ""Yes, it was."" - and we move on. It is more than enough time and words to get people up to speed."

It should be alluded too while Bruce decides to be Batman again- and then further explored in the solo film. Suicide Squad doesn't need it either but rather expand on those Batman villains for the solo film later. (Joker is talking to Harleen at the end- not Robin)"

They're moving right into the group action and the payoff will be the comic book feeling that makes a good superhero film.
DC_Cinematic,3d206g,JamesD-TV,13,Sun Jul 12 22:49:14 2015 UTC,"I would argue that Man of Steel was a bigger film than Avengers in the conflict, themes and consequences. And arguably, the world of MOS was quite big in terms of depth, the history of krypton, the expansion and decline of krypton but wasn't wide like BvS is.  Honestly would rather see filmmakers, aspire for huge things and fall short than timidly be in the safe zone.   Reason Superman and Batman are such icons because they have been through hundreds of trials, some by fire, some by kryptonite, some by gas, some very public, some very private but a lot more painful. Some of those we have seen on screen."
DC_Cinematic,3d206g,dc_fanboyforever,8,Sun Jul 12 23:38:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, at the end of the day, I'd prefer something that would make me think. I wasn't surprised at the Man of Steel backlash either, mind you, as Ms Kent puts it in the trailer ""people hate what they don't understand""."

DC_Cinematic,3d4ffc,MysticalGreenBeanie,7,Mon Jul 13 13:05:09 2015 UTC,I'm hoping it's Jason too.  I agree that they're most likely leading to a Red Hood movie I just don't want to see them ditch Nightwing along the way.
DC_Cinematic,3d4ffc,Justice_Prince,3,Mon Jul 13 17:04:21 2015 UTC,"see, i said the same thing, but then i read smallville season 11 and i really like the way they folded nightwing in there. but yeah, i'd much prefer everybody in their comic accurate roles"
DC_Cinematic,3d4ffc,mrthewhite,2,Mon Jul 13 17:06:07 2015 UTC,"I'd almost grantee it's Jason.  We're dealing with an old Batman here so if there are Robins in this universe then he's likely had more than 1.  The only think I'm not sure of is where Tim and Damien fits into all this, if they do.  Dick will be Nightwing and former Robin, Jason will be the resurrected Red Hood and former Robin but right now we have no Robin (that we know of) So I'm wondering if they're going to just ignore Tim and Damien or if thy're going to fold them into this some how too."
DC_Cinematic,3d4ffc,mrthewhite,2,Mon Jul 13 17:20:26 2015 UTC,"i'm still unsure if they're going to even use tim and damien. mainly because snyder and affleck have such a fanboy love for miller, i'm wondering if they might just pass over tim and use carrie in his place. it'd be an interesting change of pace, seeing a female robin cofflet's just ignore stephanie browncoff but yeah. i'd also like to see damien in this universe. it would make sense because batfleck is the same he was in the comics during the morrison run (batfleck is supposed to be 40 right?)"
DC_Cinematic,3d4ffc,Justice_Prince,2,Mon Jul 13 17:24:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah my understanding is he's supposed to be 40.  I think the Robins have a bad image in movies as well because of the 90s Batman movies.  They're viewed as kind of a childish character and not one that would fit into this ""mature"" movie universe, so they might stay away from actually showing robin all together.  I'd be fine with the first Robin in the movies being Carrie or Tim though.  I've never really been a fan of Damien and I think the fact that his age is such a part of his character will prevent them from going with him any time soon.  The Batman they've shown so far doesn't really seem like the kinda guy who would bring a young child into a deadly situation (let a lone his own son) but Tim and Carrie could easily be aged up to late teen/early 20s without completely changing their identities."
DC_Cinematic,3d4ffc,teo1315,2,Mon Jul 13 17:31:37 2015 UTC,"What did they do in the Smallville comic?  If they were going to make Dick into Redhood then maybe we switches to Nightwing at the end on the film.  Personally I think they should make it so Dick, and Jason were serving as Robins at the same time with maybe Dick still starting first.  Jason's death could be what caused Dick to then leave, and adopt a new superhero identity."
DC_Cinematic,3d4ffc,Lurk-man,2,Mon Jul 13 17:25:19 2015 UTC,"in smallville season 11, barbara is nightwing. so i think if they did make dick the dead robin, either barbara or carrie could be nightwing. because there's a neat idea in the new 52 where tim was never robin. but he was red robin. because according to both him and bruce, the robin that died was the last one.  also, there was an early idea in the film that nightwing and bruce are actually bitter towards eachother because dick and jason were so close, that when jason died, he blamed bruce for his death. that would be interesting to see"

DC_Cinematic,3d0hwi,your_mind_aches,7,Sun Jul 12 23:42:25 2015 UTC,"Judging from the leaked trailer, it is the actual tagline. Great minds think alike, I suppose. wink wink nudge nudge"
DC_Cinematic,3d0hwi,LordCommanderStark,3,Sun Jul 12 23:45:20 2015 UTC,WHOA. YES.
DC_Cinematic,3d0hwi,your_mind_aches,9,Sun Jul 12 23:48:44 2015 UTC,u/IAmLuckyDuckling Could you update the sidebar with this logo?
DC_Cinematic,3d0hwi,JamesTheGent,10,Sun Jul 12 15:21:21 2015 UTC,Yep. Updating later today.
DC_Cinematic,3d0hwi,IAmLuckyDuckling,5,Sun Jul 12 16:27:16 2015 UTC,I love it <3
DC_Cinematic,3d0hwi,FlamingPanda77,3,Sun Jul 12 15:49:03 2015 UTC,Doesn't seem particularly grimdark which it shouldn't be so that's good.
DC_Cinematic,3d0hwi,your_mind_aches,2,Sun Jul 12 23:40:24 2015 UTC,A bit gutted they aren't sticking with the one with the gun but this is still a great logo that fits the edgier team we look to be getting.
DC_Cinematic,3d0hwi,TheJoshider10,4,Mon Jul 13 00:41:20 2015 UTC,nice yo
DC_Cinematic,3d2h83,KomodoEmiko,14,Mon Jul 13 00:12:13 2015 UTC,"I think it was great, I love Jesse Eisenberg so I don't expect disappointment. Though I wasn't a big fan of him being cast as Lex Luthor I do think he'll do a great job!"
DC_Cinematic,3d2h83,Fuel-For-Life,4,Mon Jul 13 00:14:29 2015 UTC,"I had my doubts when I first hear that he would be Lex, but I keep an open mind, then I see the first photo of him as lex and I thought ""Wow! he actually looks menacing"", so I start liking the idea and the last trailer just sold him to me, now im glad they choose him and I dont want Lex to be played by someone else."
DC_Cinematic,3d2h83,KingofZombies,2,Mon Jul 13 00:58:15 2015 UTC,"A little disappointed... but still intrigued. I still hope to some day get a more physically capable, together, less cartoonish, and more ego driven Lex some day. But the slightly loony super genius might be fun."
DC_Cinematic,3d2h83,jasonhaven,2,Mon Jul 13 11:58:47 2015 UTC,"Personally, I didn't quite like him much. But I'm willing to wait for more footage/actual movie till pass a full on judgment."
DC_Cinematic,3d2h83,TheOneWhoKnocksBitch,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:32:34 2015 UTC,"Still skeptical but I think he'll win me over. The hair is pretty ridiculous but I imagine it's for contrast for the final act when the wig comes off.  I unfortunately read that possible plot summary and if it is true, it seems like they did justice to the character.  Of course, that could be fake."
DC_Cinematic,3d2h83,Mattyzooks,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:10:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think he seems all that intimidating so maybe he'll come across as more creepy? I mostly like him in the trailer except the tone when he said the ""the red capes are coming."" I felt like it was supposed to sound ominous and didn't across that way."
DC_Cinematic,3d2h83,GlobalVagabond,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:26:11 2015 UTC,I feel like the tone is supposed to be more mocking. Talking about the biggest lie could lead into Paul Revere's the red coats are coming and kind of making fun of that panic.
DC_Cinematic,3d2h83,Treheveras,-1,Wed Jul 15 07:13:26 2015 UTC,"Like I said before, this Luthor is more canonical, but he is more on the side of smug,sarcastic douchebag and isn't very arrogant and on the nose yet. I think he will grow into it and strangely enough he brings a little bit of camp to this movie, just to calm things down here and there.  But good god, awful fashion choices! What a dork!"
DC_Cinematic,3d2h83,dc_fanboyforever,6,Mon Jul 13 00:16:19 2015 UTC,"Mm, I feel he's representing the human tendency to be very cynical, I think he'll be an incredibly refreshing antagonist.   & yeah, haha, I've been laughing at the comments on his wardrobe.. considering how close it is to what I usually wear..."
DC_Cinematic,3d2h83,toolonglurking,2,Mon Jul 13 00:22:12 2015 UTC,Yeah - the people critical of his wardrobe have not been to a JCrew recently or through Brooklyn or Silicon Valley... hipsters everywhere
DC_Cinematic,3d2h83,dc_fanboyforever,0,Mon Jul 13 16:34:40 2015 UTC,So you are 70s hipster dork then? I mean nothing wrong with that just curious!
DC_Cinematic,3d2h83,Dr_Ifto,2,Mon Jul 13 00:31:00 2015 UTC,Don't forget rich & white!
DC_Cinematic,3d2h83,keeprollinrollinyo,-8,Tue Jul 14 02:10:46 2015 UTC,I'm not sold. I just can't take the actor seriously. Never liked him.
DC_Cinematic,3d2h83,Dr_Ifto,7,Mon Jul 13 01:23:46 2015 UTC,yo open ur mind yo
DC_Cinematic,3d1ql6,BarbequeMeat,23,Sun Jul 12 20:31:27 2015 UTC,All. I have watched the trailer all of the times.
DC_Cinematic,3d1ql6,jasonhaven,12,Sun Jul 12 20:40:22 2015 UTC,"So, since yesterday, I think i've watched the BvS trailer a good thirty times, the full SS leak a good twenty (with Leto's line by itself at like 100), the Deadpool leak about ten times, and then I stared at the S4 reveal picture for Arrow for way too long. (being vague in case people didn't see)  I think I have a problem."
DC_Cinematic,3d1ql6,XxVaynexX,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:00:45 2015 UTC,"I also think you have a problem. BvS trailer is almost 4 minutes, meaning you spent almost 2 hours just watching that one trailer in a single day."
DC_Cinematic,3d1ql6,Nick3570,5,Sun Jul 12 22:18:32 2015 UTC,"Yup, pretty much sums it up. I was at home just really following comic con news for most of the day. Re-watching and discussing the BvS and Suicide Squad trailer occupied a lot of that time."
DC_Cinematic,3d1ql6,decrepidactyl,8,Mon Jul 13 00:15:44 2015 UTC,You just made watch it again
DC_Cinematic,3d1ql6,Luis_Ignacio,10,Sun Jul 12 21:26:57 2015 UTC,I have it playing on a loop.
DC_Cinematic,3d1ql6,hookemravens,6,Sun Jul 12 21:45:09 2015 UTC,Not enough times.
DC_Cinematic,3d1ql6,zhengyingli,9,Sun Jul 12 21:38:30 2015 UTC,52!
DC_Cinematic,3d1ql6,dc_fanboyforever,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:41:52 2015 UTC,"A good 10 or 12. There's so much in the trailer but it did a good job of hiding easter egg, secrets, and smoke and mirrors. Parts of the trailer look like they could have been cut from different scenes and juxtaposed to give leave viewers guessing. The scene where Superman flows in like a boss, his eyes lit aflame and the cut to Batman getting the fuck out of the way with the grapnel gun make it look like Superman was shooting at Batman but I doubt it's him. It would have vaporized Batman if it hit him. Or maybe Supes is under Lex's control. Or maybe it's from a certain experiment.  Also, I don't know if it's coincidence but ever since the trailer premiered I've been constantly horny."
DC_Cinematic,3d1ql6,rustedmachines,2,Mon Jul 13 00:21:05 2015 UTC,The last part made me chuckle :D
DC_Cinematic,3d1ql6,adi1211,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:02:13 2015 UTC,"8-9 times, two reaction videos and a compilation of said reaction videos in which a grown man was brought to tears by the end of the trailer."
DC_Cinematic,3d1ql6,heybuddyitsme,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:42:20 2015 UTC,I've watched it a solid 30-40 times.
DC_Cinematic,3d1ql6,RegalEagle728,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:08:06 2015 UTC,has anyone noticed the green lantern suit in the scene that might be the batcave?
DC_Cinematic,3d1btp,TronVin,9,Sun Jul 12 18:31:12 2015 UTC,Or it may not be concept art. I don't know.
DC_Cinematic,3d1btp,william2181,7,Sun Jul 12 18:34:56 2015 UTC,is it me or does his hair look dirty blonde. aslo ezra is gonna be a fucking awesome flash
DC_Cinematic,3d1btp,keeprollinrollinyo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:12:57 2015 UTC,yo he is moving so fast its blurrd yo
DC_Cinematic,3d22by,TronVin,2,Sun Jul 12 22:07:56 2015 UTC,Which tease did they have that predates the Jared Ledo casting?
DC_Cinematic,3d22by,ovaltinejenkins88,3,Sun Jul 12 22:14:48 2015 UTC,"I think OP is referring to the ""HAHAHA Joke's on you"" which would have been in a script draft before Leto was cast."
DC_Cinematic,3d22by,Nickerdoodle,2,Sun Jul 12 22:18:56 2015 UTC,Good point. I was trying to think a tease we saw that could've predated the casting.
DC_Cinematic,3d22by,ovaltinejenkins88,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:20:42 2015 UTC,"Even in MoS, I don't have a pic but I noticed in one of the battle scenes with Zod in Smallville that there was a tanker that clearly said 'LexCorp'."
DC_Cinematic,3d22by,The_Gay_Whovian,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:25:40 2015 UTC,"I feel the opposite, I feel it's a bit forced.  I honestly feel Man of Steel should have had more world building.  You had Clark literally travelling the world, it would have been prime for some teases here and there of the bigger universe.  But yes it is looking pretty good otherwise."
DC_Cinematic,3d22by,suoicil,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:46:14 2015 UTC,Sometimes I honestly forget that Zod was even there because all I remember is the whole 'dealing with being Superman' bit. Granted it is SUPERMAN's movie but it is awkward jumping from just the Man of Steel to a Justice League prequel- although this would be the way to do it. Seriously- I only remembered Zod when i saw him in the trailer!
DC_Cinematic,3d2x85,WinterAssassinR,3,Mon Jul 13 02:31:59 2015 UTC,Hal looks like Chris Pine. Possible Kyle Rayner on the right.
DC_Cinematic,3d3i9i,Bodie293,6,Mon Jul 13 05:52:09 2015 UTC,"It's probably what I've been saying for a while now: a set dresser just having a little fun. No one is going to be able to read that tombstone from afar, so they probably just put in a little reference for their own enjoyment. Now, a crappy picture of it has made tons of fans go crazy about the future of the batfamily."
DC_Cinematic,3d3i9i,CobaltMoon98,3,Mon Jul 13 07:58:31 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of the [fan] extra that made a Robin-Logo poster at the football game in 'The Dark Knight Rises'. It made its rounds through the internet before the film release, and was ultimately cut from the film."
DC_Cinematic,3d3i9i,decrepidactyl,2,Mon Jul 13 11:39:04 2015 UTC,I'd really hate for someone to have found a huge plot hole in the trailer.
DC_Cinematic,3d3i9i,Superjam83,2,Mon Jul 13 05:58:17 2015 UTC,"I truly hope that gravestone is just someone trying to fuck with us fans. Hopefully the DCCU is at the point where Jason has died and Dick has become estanged from Bruce. I'm certain Jena Malone's character will be a paralyzed Barbara Gordon. I'd love it if the solo Batman movie introduced Tim and had Bruce rekindle his friendship with Dick. Ben Affleck and Geoff Johns, please give us the Batfamily!"
DC_Cinematic,3d3i9i,Jangwin,4,Mon Jul 13 11:37:46 2015 UTC,And bring us Red Hood
DC_Cinematic,3d1ypg,azrael96,20,Sun Jul 12 21:38:26 2015 UTC,"Hopefully SS the movie actually has the tone, lol. Avengers first trailer sold that tone, but the movie was not."
DC_Cinematic,3d1ypg,S0ckHeaven,2,Sun Jul 12 21:53:59 2015 UTC,That's exactly why I was let down by it.
DC_Cinematic,3d1ypg,Under_The_Stairs,2,Mon Jul 13 00:05:01 2015 UTC,"As someone who dind't watch the trailer (I couldn't understand much of that leaked version), who was the villain?"
DC_Cinematic,3d1ypg,diogosanto,2,Sun Jul 12 22:17:15 2015 UTC,"Joker, thought that seemed pretty obvious."
DC_Cinematic,3d1ypg,legopieface,3,Sun Jul 12 23:39:54 2015 UTC,"In a movie full of villains, I thought you were referencing a different kind of villains, like a rogue agency, or a traitorous government official. Joker could be someone that gets in the way of the squad, while they're after the main villain."
DC_Cinematic,3d1ypg,diogosanto,3,Sun Jul 12 23:49:07 2015 UTC,It'll probably go all Shamalan on us. They go after a villain/corporation  but the real villain is Joker.
DC_Cinematic,3d1ypg,legopieface,3,Sun Jul 12 23:51:21 2015 UTC,"Just how it goes on the Arkham games then! Bla Bla Bla this is a new kind of foe, and Batman will be tested in ways never imagined. 30 minutes in and Joker hijacks the plot to himself.   (not dissing the Arkham games, I love them. I'm just saying that's how they usually go)"
DC_Cinematic,3d1ypg,diogosanto,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:00:29 2015 UTC,So far it looks like they will pretty much take the same main plot as Batman: assault on Arkham. Suicide squad is send to do a mission. get sidetracked when Harley meet Batman. Even more when Joker appear. then it is revealed that Joker is behind everything. big fight. credit roll.
DC_Cinematic,3d1ypg,Major_Stranger,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:13:19 2015 UTC,Eh I don't think he'll be the main threat they are going against. He'll just kinda weave in and out of the story causing mayhem
DC_Cinematic,3d1ypg,BatmanDavey1986,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:24:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think one of the big plot points will be that the Joker has escaped. What if they move him from Arkham to Wallers custody, against Batmans wishes, and he escapes from their custody."
DC_Cinematic,3d1ypg,yettiornot_hereIcome,2,Mon Jul 13 06:14:13 2015 UTC,No
DC_Cinematic,3d1ypg,Hushnw52,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:29:53 2015 UTC,The classic music fits in so well I thought it was Margot Robbie singing because of how they played it in shots of her and the line with 'the joke was on me' just before Joker talks to her at the end.
DC_Cinematic,3d18uw,DeathOfSuperman,6,Sun Jul 12 18:06:58 2015 UTC,"Even if people recorded the trailer at Comic Con, I don't think anyone will upload since the trailer went live on YouTube before the panel even ended."
DC_Cinematic,3d18uw,invisiblack,7,Sun Jul 12 18:35:31 2015 UTC,This one was recorded at the Con but not in Hall H itself.
DC_Cinematic,3d1twt,JimmyBing,3,Sun Jul 12 20:59:12 2015 UTC,Was in hall h and they literally flashed it on the side screens way too fast for anyone to really take a good picture. I blinked and almost missed the cyborg concept art. Snyder needs to UNITE THE SEVEN this is pretty fucked the rest of the world doesn't get to see the new flash!
DC_Cinematic,3d1twt,letsgetweirdkbye,3,Sun Jul 12 23:11:56 2015 UTC,So did you see the Cyborg suit? If so can you link a picture from comics that looks most like it?
DC_Cinematic,3d1twt,invisiblack,2,Sun Jul 12 23:30:55 2015 UTC,New 52 suit would be the closest comparison? All of them seem really close to the injustice video game. Sorry for being terrible at describing things.
DC_Cinematic,3d1twt,letsgetweirdkbye,2,Sun Jul 12 23:38:22 2015 UTC,"That is actually helpful, just wanted to know which version they were taking it from."
DC_Cinematic,3d1twt,invisiblack,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:41:24 2015 UTC,All were original designs but heavily influenced from the canon. If Snyder posts them we might actually break the fucking Internet. People will love them.
DC_Cinematic,3d1twt,letsgetweirdkbye,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:43:31 2015 UTC,"Maybe you should make a post describing them, or giving the closest example like you did here."
DC_Cinematic,3d1twt,invisiblack,2,Sun Jul 12 23:49:11 2015 UTC,People would just get mad at me for doing a shitty job. The Green Lantern corps art one of them looked like chris pine with a beard I legit thought he was gonna walk out. That leaked flash pic shows Ezra at a crime scene with a lab coat on holding a bullet shell casing Or that's what it looked like to me.
DC_Cinematic,3d1twt,letsgetweirdkbye,2,Sun Jul 12 23:59:34 2015 UTC,Can you describe what the costumes looked like?
DC_Cinematic,3d1twt,letsgetweirdkbye,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:35:21 2015 UTC,New 52 influenced but all are original? They flashed them so fucking fast I'm sorry guys my adrenaline was shooting through the roof. The Injustice video game suits are kind of close but I'm a diehard flash fan and that is the one suit I have been dying to see and I can honestly say it was AWESOME LOOKING. Flash TV fans might actually cry.
DC_Cinematic,3d1twt,JamesD-TV,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:42:08 2015 UTC,"I was expecting a Green Lantern reveal, a Unite the Seven of maybe the Trinity or Cyborg, and a very soft tease of SS like the BvS trailer last year. But 2 FULL trailers and knowing its a Green Lantern Corps movie instead is good enough for me!"

DC_Cinematic,3d0xhm,deonist,3,Sun Jul 12 16:30:29 2015 UTC,Yeah even all the rumors about Doomsday made him sound much more like Bizarro.
DC_Cinematic,3d0xhm,Justice_Prince,8,Sun Jul 12 18:56:04 2015 UTC,Probably. Every rumor(even before the trailers) talked about Doomsday and now most of the leaks point to him.
DC_Cinematic,3d0xhm,romanius24,6,Sun Jul 12 16:36:16 2015 UTC,"It makes the most sense, I could see them using zods body and supermans DNA to splice together a monster, maybe Luther will make superman clone that looks like superman and tell him to fuck shit up but as time goes by he becomes more slow and grotesque then eventually blaming superman for making him that way."
DC_Cinematic,3d0xhm,BattleReadyPenguin,2,Sun Jul 12 18:03:58 2015 UTC,"As I was rewatching the trailer right now, I kinda noticed the scene where Superman is kneeling before Luther.

DC_Cinematic,3d0xhm,passwordistaco0013,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:55:26 2015 UTC,"That looks to me like Luthor has Kryptonite in his hand, that's why Supes is kneeling"

DC_Cinematic,3d0xhm,TotallyNotKanye,0,Sun Jul 12 19:07:35 2015 UTC,"If it is Bizzaro, I want Superman to talk him out of conflict, like you do to an angry and fearful child. That would really solidify Superman as a great Hero! It would be really cool if both Superman and Batman figure out that they can talk to him in weird opposite way to calm him down. It would be funny and awesome!"
DC_Cinematic,3d00iu,MultipleInsurgents,5,Sun Jul 12 09:26:20 2015 UTC,How come we haven't got the official trailer yet? Don't they usually release it after a leak?
DC_Cinematic,3d00iu,Thomassaurus,9,Sun Jul 12 14:42:18 2015 UTC,"They never officially released last year's BVS Comic Con tease. But in this case, many assume they're trying to spread out the hype. If they release both trailers right next to each other, they might take some attention away from one another. I'm thinking we might see the official Suicide Squad trailer next week, at the earliest NOW!"
DC_Cinematic,3d00iu,ninjartist,6,Sun Jul 12 15:39:00 2015 UTC,That Joker looks fuckin mental! Gives me chills seeing the DC Universe open up like this
DC_Cinematic,3d00iu,Tecul,8,Sun Jul 12 18:50:59 2015 UTC,Am I losing my marbles or is that Batgirl tied down on the table?
DC_Cinematic,3d00iu,legopieface,5,Sun Jul 12 11:14:28 2015 UTC,"It may well be - In the Batman V Superman trailer there is a scene where The Joker has defaced Robin's suit, so the storyline could integrate The Joker possibly hunting Batman's allies."
DC_Cinematic,3d00iu,Nickerdoodle,4,Sun Jul 12 11:48:39 2015 UTC,I think that's Killer Croc. That's what descriptions have been saying.
DC_Cinematic,3d00iu,legopieface,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:41:43 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a she though, unless Croc is sporting a wig."

It does look to be a woman, hard to say if it's Batgirl, it could be Harley during her days as a psychiatrist. Hard to tell with the quality."

DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,UnknownJ25,5,Sat Jul 11 19:22:46 2015 UTC,Dick I think.
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,BatmanDavey1986,15,Sat Jul 11 19:24:24 2015 UTC,I hope it's Jason just because Dick is my favorite DC character outside of Batman. But I remember seeing set photos somewhere a while back that included a Richard Grayson tombstone
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,Anp3450,10,Sat Jul 11 19:26:39 2015 UTC,What if it's Jason Grayson
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,Fuel-For-Life,7,Sat Jul 11 19:27:56 2015 UTC,"I was hoping that was a small joke done by the production team that wouldn't even be visible in the movie but now after seeing the Robin suit, I don't think so. Sucks because I was hoping for a chance of maybe having Nightwing on the big screen."
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,Icethorne,7,Sat Jul 11 19:28:05 2015 UTC,Why does seeing the Robin suit change anything. It could be Jason's.
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,TheJoshider10,10,Sat Jul 11 19:30:29 2015 UTC,"It doesn't mean a thing. You're right. But it's interesting with this being what seems to be a memorial and the Richard Grayson tombstone. It is all speculation at this point, but it's supported by evidence."
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,Anp3450,8,Sat Jul 11 19:34:48 2015 UTC,I'm hoping they're either gonna edit the name or it's his father.
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,TheJoshider10,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:37:22 2015 UTC,"Well seeing as the Richard Grayson tombstone has 1952-2000 on it, unless the joker killed him when he was 48 I don't think its real."
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,sinces,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:59:36 2015 UTC,"Orrrrrrrrrrr, maybe it means Dick Grayson is dead, but we'll see Agent 37 on screen."
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,eric844,3,Sat Jul 11 21:44:04 2015 UTC,"The tombstone's dates would not match Dick. It was most likely his father, as it says he was born 1972 1952.  Edit: Wrong year, thanks for pointing out my mistake."
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,SirPimpington,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:56:04 2015 UTC,It actually says 1952 which makes it even more unlikely.
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,suss2it,8,Sun Jul 12 02:59:09 2015 UTC,Oh God do I hope this means Red Hood exists in this universe of films.
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,ForesterDesign,3,Sat Jul 11 19:50:37 2015 UTC,Oh me too. I'm hoping that's the first solo Batman film in this universe.
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,Anp3450,7,Sat Jul 11 19:54:00 2015 UTC,"I want to throw in a large chunk of speculation just for fun. At the 2:00 mark Bruce is saying something very interesting to Alfred. * ""20 years in Gotham, how many good guys are left?"" * Shot of Robin's suit with Joker paint * ""How many stayed that way?"" * Shot of actual scene with Bruce speaking to Alfred  The interesting part is the ""how many stayed that way?."" Initially I would've assumed he's talking about himself and he feels he was becoming a villain and it could've lead to him hanging up the cowl and retiring. As we see earlier in the trailer, someone sends Bruce the article about letting his family die and we could assume this is Joker, who seems to know Bruce is batman. He does in the current new 52 run but doesn't really care about bruce wayne that much. I would like to suggest a huge break in what we usually know of Joker and Dick Grayson. I would like to suggest that in this version of earth, Dick Grayson somewhere along the line after being robin actually adopts the Joker persona and kills his replacement, Jason Todd. I'm fairly certain they wouldn't want to piss off Earth prime, Joker and Nightwing purists by doing that but I would like to remind everyone that Martha Wayne became Joker in earth 2 after Bruce's death. That would add a huge layer of personal attachment and responsibility to Bruce's character in actually losing a son to insanity and creating the Joker and that son killing his replacement by the time we get to that solo batman movie. Anyway just a crazy thing to think about."
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,PolyUmami,2,Sun Jul 12 07:42:00 2015 UTC,That's a really cool idea actually. I hope this turns out to be the case.
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,maxyyb99,5,Sun Jul 12 12:06:40 2015 UTC,That line is so Joker. I can hear Mark Hamill's voice saying it.
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,ultrasargent,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:06:20 2015 UTC,how do you know thats the Robin suit?
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,jdyake,6,Sat Jul 11 19:48:30 2015 UTC,"On the left hand side (our right) under the writing you can see the R symbol. Also, it could only be Robin's suit."
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,americanhardgums,2,Sat Jul 11 19:54:01 2015 UTC,"If you pause it when it zooms in on the writing, you can see the R on his chest."
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,Anp3450,67,Sat Jul 11 19:53:29 2015 UTC,I thought my body was ready. I was so wrong.

DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,UnknownJ25,28,Sat Jul 11 19:22:31 2015 UTC,The suit with 'HAHA JOKES ON YOU' was Robins suit.
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,BarbequeMeat,14,Sat Jul 11 19:25:46 2015 UTC,Which one I wonder? I hope it's Jason but I'm afraid it's gonna be Dick
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,UnknownJ25,7,Sat Jul 11 19:26:32 2015 UTC,"If Dick is dead I'm not watching any DC Cinematic movies(That's a lie, I'm hyped)"

DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,Superjam83,7,Sat Jul 11 19:34:57 2015 UTC,"The way it was written made me think it was something Joker did to Batman, maybe killed someone in the tower close to him like Lucius?"
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,UnknownJ25,8,Sat Jul 11 19:37:05 2015 UTC,I just think it was Joker teasing him about Superman's destruction.
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,Fuel-For-Life,5,Sat Jul 11 19:38:02 2015 UTC,I think it's Jason Todd teasing him. The writing on Robin's suit clearly belongs to Joker and Batman just keeps it there as a reminder of his failure.
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,lionheart4k,4,Sat Jul 11 20:51:15 2015 UTC,I don't think it was Joker. I thought it was just a normal citizen sending that in.
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,thecommander98,3,Sat Jul 11 20:12:32 2015 UTC,"This, the ""family"" part is the wayne part. As in people are saying he did nothing."
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,Huntersteve,2,Mon Jul 13 00:15:49 2015 UTC,"I think people are misinterpreting this. You should look at it more as an angry response from a possibly grieving family or widow, looking to point blame, that fuels Bruce Wayne's desire to ""destroy"" Supes."

DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,ThatPersonGu,42,Tue Jul 14 13:31:59 2015 UTC,Seeing that Jeffery Dean Morgan is indeed Thomas Wayne... It kind of really makes me want a Flashpoint storyline happen.  He was an amazing Comedian.
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,mahl_binx,27,Sat Jul 11 19:26:43 2015 UTC,If the flash movie was Flashpoint with Thomas Wayne I would kill myself from the hype.
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,wellbluebanana,7,Sat Jul 11 20:00:30 2015 UTC,Don't do this to me right now. Flashpoint would honestly be a great flash movie.
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,TheAndrewSpence,8,Sun Jul 12 02:35:54 2015 UTC,They already did an animated version so I'm not clamouring for a live-action redo. Plus that story works best when there's already some history between the characters. I'm more hoping we get an origin story rather than an adaptation of any one specific story.

DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,amarant_05,4,Sat Jul 11 20:57:14 2015 UTC,"For one thing, it's incredibly difficult. It really makes you realize how much advertising is out there. I had to divert my eyes from TV to subway entrances. I would also say that it can make the movie (more?) disappointing. I wasn't crazy about either TDKR or AoU, so it was almost like the movie I pictured in my head was better than what I eventually saw (it didn't help that I heard some of Ultron's menacing dialogue, and then he turned out to be sillier than I was expecting).    I want to say it's still worth the effort, but I wouldn't know for sure unless I had seen one of my favorite superhero movies this way. Like, I wonder if I would've like The Dark Knight more had I skipped the trailers. I guess my lukewarm response to the previous two attempts helped me cave for Batman v Superman (not that I'm expecting to be disappointed). I guess I also don't want to miss out on the hype train, even at the risk of ""spoilers"" (I say that lightly). It's a tough call. I might try again on a different DC movie."
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,ninjartist,2,Sat Jul 11 21:03:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think that Batman Begins was one of the very few movies I've gone to without seeing the trailer. Which was pretty easy, because if I remember correctly, it had very little marketing around it. I already knew that Nolan had made one of my favorite movies in Memento, and that this was gonna be a movie about Batman. Enough to get my attention.  Given that I knew nothing about the plot, or who was even in it, everything was a surprise. And it was fantastic.  Of course, that's not to say anything negative about the trailers that have been released."

DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,milo_van_patton,2,Sat Jul 11 21:03:50 2015 UTC,I just hope we get a flashback of Robin in action but they'll probably save that for the solo Batman movie.

DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,Superjam83,6,Sat Jul 11 22:36:32 2015 UTC,"Theory I will post here first. Joker knows Batman is Bruce Wayne. He writes on Robin's suit, suggested by the ""Hahaha,"" with the ""joke,"" alluding to The Killing Joke. Also, the ""you let your family die,"" written on an article. He's holding an envelop too suggesting it was mailed to Bruce Wayne."
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,suss2it,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:49:01 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. Joker could've done that to Robin when he killed him and Batman never bothered scrubbing off.
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,Superjam83,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:04:28 2015 UTC,Yeah but how does Bruce Wayne get a taunting letter about people dying in his building? Somebody is playing with Bruce Wayne and Batman at the very least. I think it's the same person.
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,lionheart4k,2,Sun Jul 12 03:39:37 2015 UTC,"I think it's from Jason Todd but Bruce Wayne just passes it off as hate mail that just happened to know who pressed his buttons. ""You let your family die,"" sounds awfully close to ”A death in the family."" I think that scene is actually planting the seed of Red Hood."

DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,thecommander98,2,Sun Jul 12 03:03:33 2015 UTC,"Thor was a legend created by the Norse that was adapted by Marvel Comics. I saw that phrase a couple years ago describing how despite the popularity of Marvel heroes the DC heroes are iconic characters i.e. Batman and Superman and they paved the way for all later characters. I'm sorry that you found this so insulting, just enjoy it dude."
DC_Cinematic,3cxtfh,suss2it,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:13:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's insulting I just think Marvel vs DC comparisons are tired and trite at this point.

I also find myself loving Jesse Eisenberg's eccentric-yet-sociopathic performance as Lex Luthor.

DC_Cinematic,3cy3r5,MCTerrific,17,Sat Jul 11 21:49:48 2015 UTC,I have a feeling a lot of the DC movie universe especially with Batman is going to be told through flashbacks.  I think the tattoos are meant to separate a later present day Joker from his past.  He already has the bird tattooed on his arm in that scene which suggests its present day and he has long since killed Robin.

DC_Cinematic,3cy3r5,BatmanDavey1986,17,Sat Jul 11 21:03:50 2015 UTC,He's a gun for hire. He can be a really bad guy or he can be a true anti hero just caught up in the wrong line of work.   He does have a daughter who is his main motivation.

DC_Cinematic,3cy3r5,BardicFire,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:09:56 2015 UTC,Well I disagree a little. usually Deadshot is portrayed as enjoying killing. He's the world's best sharpshooter and usually only takes the most prestigious assassinations
DC_Cinematic,3cy3r5,romanius24,3,Sun Jul 12 06:48:27 2015 UTC,"Depends on how he portrays the character. The cast seems to be very diverse and i think not everyone is gonna be ""scary"". We have ""crazy ones""(Clown duo), scary(Croc) but also more relatable characters like Rick Flag and from the looks of it Deadshot too."
DC_Cinematic,3cy3r5,Captain_Blackjack,3,Sat Jul 11 21:16:35 2015 UTC,"Deadshot's like the main character of Suicide Squad comics. He's pretty much a vet of the Squad. Usually he's there because Batman put him in prison, in this it's a little harder to tell if he's hired or if ARGUS gets to him.   But usually he's on the team to serve a sentence like anyone else, because he's world's deadliest hitman (next to Deathstroke, who does not exclusively use guns)."
DC_Cinematic,3cy3r5,TheExtremistModerate,2,Sat Jul 11 22:35:28 2015 UTC,"He's a hired gunman, who ""never misses."" He prides himself on his accuracy, efficiency, and deadliness. He is the world's best marksman. He does what he is paid to do. Originally, he was portrayed as having a unique relationship with Batman, who is the one man Deadshot won't kill, because deep down he reminds Floyd of his brother, whom Floyd murdered as a child while protecting his father.  In Arrow (spoilers, of course), Floyd is a military combat veteran, who returns home to his wife and daughter, and becomes abusive. He threatens his wife with a gun, and ends up running after his wife calls the police. He goes on to make a living doing the one thing he was good at: killing people. He becomes a mercenary who is deadly with a rifle, and eventually ends up getting picked up by Task Force X (the Suicide Squad). His daughter is his motivation for staying alive.  I'm guessing they're going to go for a portrayal closer to Arrow's."

DC_Cinematic,3cy3r5,Fuel-For-Life,-3,Sun Jul 12 08:43:57 2015 UTC,"While I liked the footage, I didn't like the trailer, it was odd. Seemed kinda sad, seemed weird to me. Still liked the footage and all. Just the music and the mood of the trailer put me off.   This does not make me think lower of the movie though, just that trailer xD"
DC_Cinematic,3cy3r5,HEAVEN_OR_HECK,16,Sat Jul 11 21:13:35 2015 UTC,"I dunno, man, I loved it. The music over footage of Harley's cell gave me Hannibal vibes. It oozed quiet insanity, even pathos. You see that there is some humanity to the group too, with the footage of Katana and Deadshot."
DC_Cinematic,3cy3r5,nluna1975,8,Sat Jul 11 21:35:02 2015 UTC,Loved the music so different from every comic book movie out there. Its gonna be insane.
DC_Cinematic,3cy3r5,KomodoEmiko,7,Sat Jul 11 21:59:11 2015 UTC,It's hard to judge when really what you're looking at is a poor quality video of a video.
DC_Cinematic,3cy3r5,Fuel-For-Life,-2,Sun Jul 12 00:22:11 2015 UTC,It's not when I state in my comment that the footage isn't the problem.  Low quality doesn't have anything to do with it. Quite easy to judge.
DC_Cinematic,3cy3r5,The_AtomBomb,-1,Sun Jul 12 00:28:32 2015 UTC,"I think they were trying to go for the whole ""peaceful music over action footage thing"", and they just barely missed the mark."

DC_Cinematic,3cy0pj,dc_fanboyforever,5,Sat Jul 11 21:26:32 2015 UTC,"Wasn't she talking to Waller? That's what I though because she's in the prison that Waller is keeping her in so out of Waller and Joker, Waller is more likely to show up there. Also after the devil line, we hear Waller say ""all you need to know is that you work for me"" or something of that nature"
DC_Cinematic,3cy0pj,SaltyPeppers,3,Sun Jul 12 04:50:27 2015 UTC,I thought she was talking to El Diablo
DC_Cinematic,3cy0pj,DerJakane,2,Sun Jul 12 15:10:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, she seems to speaking to Waller."
DC_Cinematic,3cy0pj,august_west_,23,Sun Jul 12 07:01:22 2015 UTC,Its actually a bit different. This clip isnt a good example but he sounds more comic booky than TDK's Joker.        There were a couple of clips on YT which hint at his Joker.
DC_Cinematic,3cy0pj,romanius24,12,Sat Jul 11 20:29:46 2015 UTC,Sounds like a cross between Hamill (from the Arkham games) and Ledger to me.

DC_Cinematic,3cy0pj,invisiblack,4,Sat Jul 11 21:00:19 2015 UTC,"I didn't think he sounded like Ledger at all. More like a mix between Mark Hamill,and his own unique voice."

There's a very blurry picture online of Barry Allen though. http://imgur.com/a/aNqtW#uSTzgpB If you hadn't already seen this. But hey. There's a couple of pretty good movie trailers with Batman and Superman online now.
DC_Cinematic,3cybip,decrepidactyl,4,Sat Jul 11 21:52:58 2015 UTC,Number 4 looks a lot like Gotham by Gaslight Batman. I wonder what's going on there.

DC_Cinematic,3cybip,EllrickOA,2,Sat Jul 11 23:12:44 2015 UTC,"Man, is that Batman snapping a dude's neck?  God I hope not."
DC_Cinematic,3cybip,theTICKetMaster,2,Sun Jul 12 00:44:11 2015 UTC,"I saw that aswell, when I was making the gifs. It doesn't make any sense though. At one point Bruce is talking to Alfred and says ""...He has the power to wipe out the entire human race ... I am going to have to destroy him.""  This to me, sounds like he actually gives a shit about saving human lives. Than they go and show him spinning that soldiers neck. I don't know, something is really off."
DC_Cinematic,3d05ws,BarbequeMeat,4,Sun Jul 12 11:02:16 2015 UTC,"So....anybody heard anything about aquaman's role in this movie? I feel so many things would happen in the movie that aquaman might not get more than 20 mins of screen time, also he wasnt in the trailer.  Maybe they'll just show him at the end?"
DC_Cinematic,3d05ws,Thief_Extraordinaire,4,Sun Jul 12 12:29:16 2015 UTC,"I doubt it's 20 minutes of screen time. He only has a cameo AFAIK so I'm guessing it'll be around 5 minutes of screen time, if not less"
DC_Cinematic,3d05ws,rustedmachines,3,Sun Jul 12 16:20:49 2015 UTC,I just re-read the leaked plot earlier. I can't find any reason to think it isn't real. It seems to have accurately predicted everything so far. Wonder woman in the trailer definitely seems to be doing what was claimed in the leak. Can anyone shed light on why it might not be real?
DC_Cinematic,3d05ws,wellbluebanana,4,Sun Jul 12 11:14:46 2015 UTC,"I dont think that plot mentioned anything about the Superman soldiers? Considering the amount of screen time they get in the trailer and the fact Batman is fighting them, they seem like a pretty big part of the movie."
DC_Cinematic,3d05ws,wellbluebanana,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:21:21 2015 UTC,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS!   A paramilitary team under LexCorp's employ, led by his head of security Anatoly Kniazev ambushes Aquaman after luring him into a trap in a LexCorp oil rig and captures him, bringing him to Cadmus for experimentation.  Batman evades Kniazev and his men  He learns about Kryptonite from Luthor's files and steals samples from it from a LexCorp outpost stationed in the Indian Ocean where the World Engine has first activated   This is the closest I could find to it. It still does not explain why they have the superman crest on them. However, superman is seen kneeling in front of Lex in the trailer so that may have something to do with it."
DC_Cinematic,3d05ws,wellbluebanana,2,Sun Jul 12 11:30:33 2015 UTC,Do you have a link to the whole thing?
DC_Cinematic,3d05ws,Superjam83,2,Sun Jul 12 11:34:13 2015 UTC,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/3bxcvg/potential_spoilers_a_detailed_plot_of_batman_v/
DC_Cinematic,3d05ws,wellbluebanana,4,Sun Jul 12 11:34:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is. While there are some similarities, there are more differences.    The ""synopsis"" says he meets with Congress while the trailer clearly shows him in front of the Senate. If this were a ""detailed"" plot, that's an important detail.  Nothing is mentioned about the destruction of the Batmobile.  Synopsis says Batman is active for 15 years. Trailer has Bruce say 20.  No mention is made about Robin or the people lost when Wayne Financial building. This serves to be very important to the plot and worth mentioning. Who is torturing Bruce? What happened to Robin? Why wouldn't it be mentioned if this was a ""detailed"" plot.  Superman's encounter with Luthor is clearly face to face and not ""seperated by a glass window"" as the synopsis says.  Who is Jenna Malone playing? Carrie Kelley or Barbara Gordon? Why leave that out?    I think, and many would be in agreement, that it's good fan fiction. A story written by someone who knows the DC Universe. They use the buzz words like   Silas Stone and Cadmus. While it sounds cool and fitting, I think the trailer debunks some of it."
DC_Cinematic,3d05ws,lionheart4k,3,Sun Jul 12 12:30:54 2015 UTC,You bring up good points. It is still possible the leak was from an early draft of the script or that the trailer focuses on minor plot points that aren't brought up in the leak.
DC_Cinematic,3d05ws,KomodoEmiko,3,Sun Jul 12 14:54:36 2015 UTC,"Just found something that gives the leaked plot more credence. At 2:33 in the trailer, Lois and the crowd outside the courthouse are reacting to something looking pretty horrified, this could be the destruction of the court house that the leak script described?"
DC_Cinematic,3d05ws,keeprollinrollinyo,2,Sun Jul 12 19:07:11 2015 UTC,"So I might have found an inconsistency with the leaked plot and the information given at the BvS panel. In the leaked plot it gives the female Senator a name, Veronica Cale. She's a character in the comics, but Zack Snyder said that Holly Hunter was playing a new original character. Just a thought."
DC_Cinematic,3cxxjr,Fuel-For-Life,9,Sat Jul 11 19:49:02 2015 UTC,How fucking incredible is this new trailer!?! Am I right?!
DC_Cinematic,3cxxjr,YaHerdWithPerd,3,Sat Jul 11 19:51:29 2015 UTC,"You are CORRECT SIR!!! The only hate it's getting is from MCU fanboys and strangely a lot of Star Wars fans, which makes me sad because I am a Star Wars fan myself."
DC_Cinematic,3cxxjr,Joncort95,7,Sat Jul 11 21:16:33 2015 UTC,"Hi there die hard MCU fan boy here, actually most MCU fans actually really like the DCCU, like this trailer blew our fucking mind. I've always been a comics fan but it is mostly due that Marvel has been around me more than DC. But holy shit dude this just made me lose it and also we finally saw Wonder Woman!!! Oh my fucking zod that was amazing!!! Also Suicide Squad look ridiculously amazing!!! Next year is gonna be a great one for all nerds!!! Also yea there are some asshole MCU fans that shut down any DC stuff, but that also is the same with some DC fans. You count me in on seeing this film on midnight release!!"
DC_Cinematic,3cxxjr,YaHerdWithPerd,3,Sat Jul 11 23:52:30 2015 UTC,I wish my Twitter feed was filled with more Marvel fans like you! This is what I'm talking about. I think quite a few fans are insecure and think that DC needs to be bad for Marvel to look better by comparison but that's idiotic.
DC_Cinematic,3cxxjr,The_Dirtiest_Beef,2,Sun Jul 12 01:05:59 2015 UTC,"""Oh my fucking zod...""  I see what you did there. I like it."
DC_Cinematic,3cxxjr,theramuk2,3,Sun Jul 12 00:00:25 2015 UTC,Marvel fans/DC fans - we are all one in the same. I'm a huuuuuge MCU fan and a proper fanboy but I LOVED this trailer and am hyped for this more than I am for Civil War for sure!!!!
DC_Cinematic,3cxxjr,Aitrus233,2,Sun Jul 12 08:15:16 2015 UTC,"And these same people I'm noticing are throwing the phrase ""typical DC fanboys"" when people defend the trailer. Pot calling the kettle black.  Yeesh, why is it impossible to just like everything? To not try to make it into some big contest between the two companies, especially since no one actually working for DC and Marvel really care outside of financial success.  Something something followers are often more rabid than the people they follow."
DC_Cinematic,3cxxjr,The_Dirtiest_Beef,2,Sat Jul 11 23:25:59 2015 UTC,Do you follow Collider? The one guy that writes for them has had nothing but negative things to say about this movie the whole time. Even he had to strain to sound pessimistic about this trailer in his article.

DC_Cinematic,3cxxjr,YaHerdWithPerd,3,Sun Jul 12 07:04:58 2015 UTC,"You would think so and I know it's probably a vocal minority but some of the comments are irritating to read. It's like certain MCU fans are scared that if DC makes great movies it will hurt Marvel somehow. They clearly don't know how the industry works. But I agree that all fans should get along. With that said, I get why MCU fans would hate on DC but Star Wars fans!...just doesn't make any sense."
DC_Cinematic,3cxxjr,zen_mutiny,2,Sun Jul 12 08:48:48 2015 UTC,"If Snyder is good at one thing, it's using Alan Moore's and Frank Miller's work as storyboards.   Not a bad thing.   Not at all."

DC_Cinematic,3cxt9e,Aitrus233,6,Sat Jul 11 21:21:47 2015 UTC,"It looks Superman: Birthright inspired, which is interesting because elements of Birthright are also in Man of Steel. Mind you, this was a young high school Lex. Eisenberg is 30 something."
DC_Cinematic,3cxt9e,Aitrus233,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:47:23 2015 UTC,Interesting.  I also think I heard/read somewhere that in some comics Superman causes Lex to go bald.  So maybe this will be an origin story to his baldness?
DC_Cinematic,3cxt9e,dc_fanboyforever,2,Sun Jul 12 02:12:09 2015 UTC,"It's entirely possible. They released this photo a while of Jesse Eisenberg as a bald Lex Luthor, and yet this trailer shows him with hair. It seems likely that either we'll see him go bald in this movie, or it's already a wig.  In Superman: Birthright for instance, an experiment that Lex conducted as a young man led to an explosion that burned off all his hair. The Silver Age Lex had a similar origin to his hair loss which he blamed on Superman."
DC_Cinematic,3cxt9e,theorangegroup,3,Sun Jul 12 05:39:28 2015 UTC,"I think his look his campy on purpose! Have you seen Spacey, Hackman? Jesse looks better than them but still looks like he can  steal 40 cakes!"

DC_Cinematic,3d29dh,JamesTheGent,-2,Sun Jul 12 23:39:39 2015 UTC,Look this suit looks like the Injustice suit here and this suit looks like normal Superman
DC_Cinematic,3d29dh,dc_fanboyforever,2,Sun Jul 12 23:48:37 2015 UTC,That sounds sooo elaborate. Why can't we just get a realistic DC movie? Not everything has to be so confusing. Just one timeline is fine.

DC_Cinematic,3d29dh,mrthewhite,5,Sun Jul 12 23:24:33 2015 UTC,Dream sequence. Neck doesn't break. Batman has gone cray cray. There are several reasons as to why he broke the dude's neck.
DC_Cinematic,3d29dh,Fuel-For-Life,-4,Mon Jul 13 00:04:28 2015 UTC,Maybe it is Christian Bale who goes crazy after seeing someone else talking over the mantle of Batman goes American Psycho and get's attacked by paramilitary Supermen.

DC_Cinematic,3cxx2j,S0ckHeaven,9,Sat Jul 11 19:51:22 2015 UTC,I noticed that too. Maybe he cuts himself on a piece of Kryptonite.

DC_Cinematic,3cxx2j,BardicFire,7,Sun Jul 12 07:50:00 2015 UTC,Mercy is in the movie as well.  The comedian plays a very Batman the animated series looking Thomas Wayne.

DC_Cinematic,3cxx2j,Calico-J,3,Sat Jul 11 20:27:47 2015 UTC,"I think what is going to happen, is that Jason is already dead and Dick was in that building that collapsed. I think if there is another Robin in the new Batfilms it will be Tim Drake. Batman is going to be in a funk for this movie and probably the next couple like SS and The Batman. He's lost two sons, he's fought Superman, he's probably really depressed. What better way to snap him out of that than Tim Drake, the kid who looks past all the darkness and sees something necessary and noble in what Bruce has lost faith in? Tim Drake will see that even amidst all the metahumans and aliens and craziness coming up in the world that Batman can still exist and serve a valid function.   Could be though, what I've suspected for awhile, Scoot McNairy plays Dick and he doesn't die in the collapse but loses his legs. This is all speculation though."
DC_Cinematic,3cxx2j,alwaysupvoteTRUNKS,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:28:35 2015 UTC,"I just think there's too much DCU movie world building ahead for Dick to be dead. Nightwing is the kind ot character that the general audience might find cool enough to warrant his own movie.  I personally see Dick begin Nightwing already. The standalone Batman movie to focus on the Red Hood storyline.  Some of that is bias, because Red Hood/Jason Todd is my favorite character. But I think there's enough hints at that being the case (The suit, the paper with ""You let your family die!"" Potentially being written by Jason)"
DC_Cinematic,3cxx2j,Con0rr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:46:49 2015 UTC,"I also like to think similarly, I was just making speculation. If Nightwing is alive, Jason died at the hands of the Joker, I'm down with that. I'm really hating these ""The Joker is a robin!"" theories, even if they are true that's kind of lazy imo. If they want to do a Return of the Joker they need to build it up over a couple of trilogies."
DC_Cinematic,3cxx2j,alwaysupvoteTRUNKS,-4,Wed Jul 15 17:50:14 2015 UTC,I don't think so. I could be wrong but when Bruce is on the phone he looks like he's yelling Dick! (Richard Greyson). Maybe Dick Greyson was in the Wayne Building when Zod destroyed it. I think we only have 2 Robins in this universe Dick and Jason.
DC_Cinematic,3cxx2j,nluna1975,5,Sat Jul 11 22:19:57 2015 UTC,Snyder said that Metropolis and Gotham are actually sister cities like Oakland/San Francisco. So its not all that hard to believe that maybe the destruction Bruce is seeing is actually occurring partially in Gotham. Something to think about.
DC_Cinematic,3cxx2j,chidoriwarrior,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:51:59 2015 UTC,"Interesting, my first thoughts were he was kinda retired from Batman and is focused on Wayne industries instead, and just happened to be in Metropolis at a Wayne industries satellite location, when Zodd and Supes had their brawl."

DC_Cinematic,3cxquc,invisiblack,2,Sat Jul 11 19:39:40 2015 UTC,Everything in that plot leak fits perfectly with the new trailer and it was released a while ago. I think it is safe to say it is real.
DC_Cinematic,3cxquc,wellbluebanana,2,Sat Jul 11 20:06:29 2015 UTC,Its being rumored that the Trinity comes together at the end to fight Doomsday and in Wonder Womans second shot (the one surrounded by fire) she looks to be in the same rubble that Superman flys over in the next shot and that the Batwing flys over beforehand.

I was super excited to see the costume, but there isn't really that much there in terms of substance once the character (Red Hood) largely gets over wanting revenge. Saying that though, my (kind of) theory about this Batman is that Jason's death is always in mind and will probably continue to have a presence throughout these films. For example, Jason's death is most likely going to have an effect on the Joker/Batman dynamic in Suicide Squad. Batman might even be hesitant about working with others in the Justice League films due to Jason's death.  Basically I feel like Jason's death as a reminder will continue to be an aspect of this version of Batman. Maybe when they're looking to finish off Batman (and this universe) they'll bring in Red Hood for its closure."
DC_Cinematic,3cze42,KomodoEmiko,3,Sun Jul 12 04:41:16 2015 UTC,"No, Ive never liked Jason Todd, hes always come off as a needy petulant type.  Id much rather Dick Grayson finally gets the respect a 75 year old character deserves."
DC_Cinematic,3cze42,EllrickOA,3,Sun Jul 12 06:02:16 2015 UTC,I think they need to work on getting us a Nightwing movie first.   Priorities.
DC_Cinematic,3cze42,zen_mutiny,6,Sun Jul 12 06:59:25 2015 UTC,I'd prefer Nightwing.
DC_Cinematic,3cze42,Jangwin,3,Sun Jul 12 04:38:06 2015 UTC,"It would depend on the film itself. The actors, director, and writer(s).  I will say I would certainly not be clamoring for a Jason Todd Red Hood film for 3 reasons:   Jason Todd is an unbearable character. He always just seems like an unlikable asshole and I wouldn't want to spend 2+ hours with him. Probably not even if he was a villain in a Batman movie. Jason Todd coming back to life is dumb. It robs the believable pathos Bruce has about getting his young partner killed with a ridiculous one that's like, ""I thought my young partner was killed by the Joker but instead he was brought back to life by Ra's Al Ghul and now super hates me but wait wasn't that like 10 years ago?"" And I just can't do that. The character of Red Hood is redundant. He's just a cranky fighty guy. He's Batman. The reason Nightwing is good is because Nightwing has a different personality than Bruce. Jason has the same personality, but in a way that doesn't feel earned."
DC_Cinematic,3cwkfv,TronVin,5,Sat Jul 11 11:39:09 2015 UTC,So I should probably try and download whatever they have uploaded immediately.
DC_Cinematic,3cwkfv,TheAndrewSpence,5,Sat Jul 11 12:31:11 2015 UTC,You don't have to download it. What they're doing is official.
DC_Cinematic,3cwkfv,TheAndrewSpence,3,Sat Jul 11 12:36:42 2015 UTC,Ok! I didn't know that! Thanks!
DC_Cinematic,3cwkfv,RocketTheCoon,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:09:52 2015 UTC,Does that include the trailer and any preview shown?  Cause I've seen some of their videos before and they cut that stuff out.
DC_Cinematic,3cwkfv,wellbluebanana,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:17:07 2015 UTC,The trailer will most likely go straight up officially anyway.
DC_Cinematic,3cwkfv,RocketTheCoon,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:25:51 2015 UTC,"I really hope so. They just showed it twice, reportedly."

DC_Cinematic,3cwkfv,KomodoEmiko,4,Sat Jul 11 12:55:10 2015 UTC,Correct. They edit out the exclusive footage.   An example would be last year's SDCC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E9UGJKZU1c

DC_Cinematic,3cvy1b,BatmanDavey1986,4,Sat Jul 11 18:04:18 2015 UTC,This trailer makes me dizzy...
DC_Cinematic,3cvy1b,BarbequeMeat,4,Sat Jul 11 18:09:37 2015 UTC,I have just read that apparently the batman v superman panel will start after man from uncle and Pan? IS that true because if so here in the UK its going to be late.
DC_Cinematic,3cvy1b,BatmanDavey1986,3,Sat Jul 11 18:15:02 2015 UTC,"True, BvS is the last panel."

DC_Cinematic,3cvy1b,S0ckHeaven,3,Sat Jul 11 18:15:44 2015 UTC,There is like 40 min left if im not mistaken.
DC_Cinematic,3cvy1b,TheAndrewSpence,3,Sat Jul 11 18:15:52 2015 UTC,"that's UK time right? If so that's cool. Perhaps the last half hour might be Batman V Superman, but that seems too short."

DC_Cinematic,3czukz,wellbluebanana,2,Sun Jul 12 07:44:22 2015 UTC,Sorry I still suck at using reddit. I didn't wanna say Damian in the title. Just posted a comment explaining.
DC_Cinematic,3czukz,Jangwin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:45:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's Damian, although it definitely takes inspiration from Damian's Batman costume. People are speculating that this scene (which shows Batman snapping the Superman soldier's neck) is from some sort of dream sequence depicting a world taken over by Superman."
DC_Cinematic,3czukz,teo1315,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:14:25 2015 UTC,I've paused that scene and its not an exact neck break. Its a little suspect but not completely certain and i think its at the base superman went to and they were lined up for him. Maybe luthor trying to set bats and superman up
DC_Cinematic,3czukz,KomodoEmiko,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:11:23 2015 UTC,Is that Damian???? It could be some sort of dream of the future. I'm not sure what to make of the soldiers with Superman symbols on their uniforms but either way that trench coat and gloves and pants looks like the future Damian Batman from the Grant Morrison run!
DC_Cinematic,3cyyc3,lampy8,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:29:40 2015 UTC,"I'm still surprised that neither DC nor Marvel have picked him up. Would make a good Lex, Gordon, Braniac, Mr. Freeze or for Marvel he would have made a good J Jonah Jameson."
DC_Cinematic,3cy32u,mrsirthemovie,15,Sat Jul 11 20:38:18 2015 UTC,Everybody did.
DC_Cinematic,3cy32u,JeremyIsSpecial,4,Sat Jul 11 20:41:46 2015 UTC,"Most have been saying it's a ""Robin"" Easter Egg not being able to discern whether it's Dick, Jason, or Tim. Why do you think it is Jason?"
DC_Cinematic,3cy32u,Superjam83,4,Sat Jul 11 20:58:43 2015 UTC,"It looks burned and Todd was ""killed"" by the Joker. But that's if it goes by the comics continuity."
DC_Cinematic,3cy32u,MiQBonafide,3,Sat Jul 11 21:03:22 2015 UTC,Most of the time it's jason. But that staff made me think Tim.
DC_Cinematic,3cy32u,TimTamDrake,4,Sat Jul 11 21:02:02 2015 UTC,"EXACTLY. I thought the same initially. Maybe they might be going with the Nolan-verse take on Robin in such a way that they're mixing the different traits of the main Robins into one. That's when Jenna Malone who's rumoured to be playing Carrie Kelly comes in, in convincing Batman that he needs a sidekick after the death of the main Robin. (Paying homage to Tim Drake convincing Bruce in the comics)"

DC_Cinematic,3czm66,TheGuyThatDoesThing,4,Sun Jul 12 05:43:33 2015 UTC,I don't think the Joker is going to have much to do with this film other than what happened in batman's past.
DC_Cinematic,3czm66,wellbluebanana,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:31:22 2015 UTC,Agreed. I'm thinking Lex Luthor is pretty much the only one trying to make Superman look like the devil & also trying to get Batman to take him out.
DC_Cinematic,3czm66,AzBat360,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:20:49 2015 UTC,"It's not a very Joker-like thing to say, though. There's nothing humorous or twisted about it."
DC_Cinematic,3czm3m,Rebelsuns,6,Sun Jul 12 05:42:37 2015 UTC,"There is no continuity. They will probably make thematic nods to it, like Batman being retired, but this is absolutely a brand-new universe that started with Man of Steel.  If you're thinking of the newspaper clipping with ""You let your family die"" scrawled on it, my guess is that is from the Joker, referring to Robin's death."
DC_Cinematic,3czm3m,zen_mutiny,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:58:23 2015 UTC,I think thats leading up for the red hood
DC_Cinematic,3czm3m,teo1315,5,Mon Jul 13 11:12:56 2015 UTC,"you can see his ring finger in the shot where he is hugging the girl, no ring.  And no, there is zero continuity."
DC_Cinematic,3czm3m,S0ckHeaven,7,Sun Jul 12 07:21:00 2015 UTC,"No. The little girl he's holding is likely just some girl who, probably ironically, lost her parents in the Metropolis attack. It's also been stated many times that this Batman has nothing to do with the Christian Bale version."
DC_Cinematic,3cxy89,CampanionDude,6,Sat Jul 11 19:54:56 2015 UTC,Not sure. The girl looks really young. It's only been 2 years since the attack on Metropolis.
DC_Cinematic,3cxy89,Superjam83,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:00:42 2015 UTC,Uhm no... But ya know... She could grow up to be a girl who wears a Bat Costume...
DC_Cinematic,3cxy89,iph_tx,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:04:26 2015 UTC,That's a reach.
DC_Cinematic,3cxy89,TotallyNotKanye,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:04:56 2015 UTC,"Given that Dawn Of Justice is (from what I've heard) set 2 years after Man Of Steel I don't think that's a big chance. But yeah, for a second I was thinking about the scene where Bruce runs into the dust and the next scene he's holding a girl in his arms from what looks like ""inside"" his buiilding. I thought, what if he has a daughter? What if he has a family? What if Superman's fight just killed his wife, maybe that's why (Also assumption) Joker sent the news letter ""You let your family die""?"
DC_Cinematic,3cxy89,Fuel-For-Life,2,Sat Jul 11 20:01:42 2015 UTC,"I get that its What-Ifs but no. Just no. Bruce never has a wife or even a daughter. The Joker is just mocking Batman for having people killed in HIS building (Wayne Financial), showing how he is incapable of saving them. Just like how he's incapable of saving Robin."
DC_Cinematic,3cxy89,TimTamDrake,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:12:13 2015 UTC,How does Joker know Batman's identity?
DC_Cinematic,3cxy89,temperate,2,Sat Jul 11 20:30:30 2015 UTC,That is a very good question.
DC_Cinematic,3cxy89,MegaFlounder,2,Sat Jul 11 20:31:23 2015 UTC,"Like the panel said, ""It's all about what's canon and you guys want to see what's canon right?"" cheers are heard  In canon, Joker has known since their first encounter because Joker left a card on the batboat, Bruce Wayne went to visit Joker in the asylum and said ""Forgot something?"" Joker didn't care. But he later used it to his advantage.  He could have done the same thing in this movie."
DC_Cinematic,3cxy89,Fuel-For-Life,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:33:07 2015 UTC,Is this the New52 canon? I'm not up to date (one trade behind) but didn't Joker completely ignore Wayne because he didn't want to know?
DC_Cinematic,3cxy89,CenturionGMU,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:55:42 2015 UTC,"The movies are not the New 52 canon, but my quote is just about being faithful to the comics. Not actual continuity in the comics."

He's older, semi-retired as Batman and who's not to say that Zack Snyder wanted to give motivation for wanting to kill Superman?  I'm kinda split on my idea too, like, I'm okay with them doing it because it would be a cool twist! But I'd rather not."

DC_Cinematic,3ctjt9,rebelinthought12345,4,Fri Jul 10 19:17:23 2015 UTC,a surprise cast   Could it be the BvS cast?
DC_Cinematic,3ctjt9,thePABSman,3,Sat Jul 11 02:49:29 2015 UTC,All signs point to yes in all honesty.
DC_Cinematic,3ctjt9,Baned0n,3,Sat Jul 11 13:39:01 2015 UTC,what time does it air?
DC_Cinematic,3ctjt9,DerringerHK,5,Fri Jul 10 22:50:17 2015 UTC,Is this official?
DC_Cinematic,3ctjt9,timetravlrfromthepst,6,Fri Jul 10 17:45:17 2015 UTC,It has been classified to be shown in Canadian theaters is what it officially means (I'm guessing it will be attached to Ant-Man). Beyond that is speculation as far as online release. But it would make a lot of sense to get it tomorrow!
DC_Cinematic,3ctjt9,JamesTheGent,4,Fri Jul 10 17:47:34 2015 UTC,Awesome!  Been waiting for that 2nd Jem trailer!
DC_Cinematic,3ctjt9,JamesTheGent,3,Fri Jul 10 18:41:02 2015 UTC,Oh shit!!!
DC_Cinematic,3ctjt9,phantompoo,3,Fri Jul 10 17:52:11 2015 UTC,"I really hope it plays with Ant Man. Of the two times I saw Age of Utron, none of those played with the BvS trailer."
DC_Cinematic,3ctjt9,rustedmachines,3,Fri Jul 10 18:50:47 2015 UTC,Aww..no Suicide Squad Teaser...
DC_Cinematic,3cu4is,Jetpack-Guy,13,Fri Jul 10 20:09:17 2015 UTC,"I think Conan O'brien is taping the panel and it will be on tomorrow night at midnight. Conan is a late night show host on TBS and he kept saying all this week that there is a really ""exciting"" panel that will be on his show he won't tell us what it is. Conan has done things with DC before like creating a character with Bruce Timm called The Flaming C which was really funny. It's speculated right now that Conan has something to do with the DC panel tomorrow. If his show has nothing to do with the panel tomorrow then I really hope someone inside hall H periscopes it on twitter or livestreams it somehow."
DC_Cinematic,3cu4is,PaulEDangerously,11,Fri Jul 10 20:55:39 2015 UTC,"Well The Conan Show is owned by WB, so I can definitely see them pushing BVS on his show!"
DC_Cinematic,3cu4is,TheAndrewSpence,2,Fri Jul 10 21:16:17 2015 UTC,also not that it matters but pretty sure Conan is in all the Lego batman games I'm guessing he's a huge fan!
DC_Cinematic,3cu4is,letsgetweirdkbye,3,Sat Jul 11 03:13:20 2015 UTC,I don't think he'll just be showing the panel. I'm assuming he's just gonna have the stars as guests.
DC_Cinematic,3cu4is,austinbucco,2,Sat Jul 11 05:53:07 2015 UTC,I'm sure filming is banned
DC_Cinematic,3cu4is,JeweliusCaesar,8,Fri Jul 10 21:42:27 2015 UTC,It is but people do it anyway and thank god they did because if they didn't the teaser trailer from last year's comic con would never have been seen by anyone except the people in Hall H last year and someone like me who has no means to get there I'm glad it leaked.
DC_Cinematic,3cu4is,PaulEDangerously,2,Fri Jul 10 22:18:14 2015 UTC,Damn..
DC_Cinematic,3cu4is,KomodoEmiko,2,Sat Jul 11 08:50:40 2015 UTC,"Aside from staying glued to various forums and YouTube for leaks, no idea."
DC_Cinematic,3cu4is,Nick3570,2,Sat Jul 11 00:31:25 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure you can't watch it live. I believe video is banned for 24 hours after filming, so you could possibly look for it on Sunday to watch."
DC_Cinematic,3ctny5,Bodie293,14,Fri Jul 10 18:07:45 2015 UTC,I trust you people at comic con to record this trailer and post it everywhere you can - our lives are in your hands.
DC_Cinematic,3ctny5,KimJongPooonn,9,Fri Jul 10 18:53:41 2015 UTC,WB might post it to avoid shitty cam leaks flooding the Internet. At least that's what I'm telling myself
DC_Cinematic,3ctny5,TheMurderCapitalist,9,Fri Jul 10 20:29:10 2015 UTC,The Only Appropriate Gif
DC_Cinematic,3ctny5,LordCommanderStark,12,Fri Jul 10 19:11:52 2015 UTC,I'm so excited!
DC_Cinematic,3ctny5,decrepidactyl,5,Fri Jul 10 20:03:16 2015 UTC,I just can't hide it!
DC_Cinematic,3ctny5,LordCommanderStark,6,Fri Jul 10 20:07:19 2015 UTC,Oh boy oh boy oh boy.
DC_Cinematic,3ctny5,Superjam83,4,Fri Jul 10 18:15:11 2015 UTC,"I CAN'T WAIT! Guys when we see this trailer tomorrow lets remember all the false hope that came before it. Remember the trailer was supposed to be with the Hobbit, the Super Bowl, Mad Max nothing! Until recently they released something almost a full year of continuous false hope and now we get a full blown trailer. Can't wait we all deserve this!"
DC_Cinematic,3ctny5,PaulEDangerously,4,Fri Jul 10 20:57:58 2015 UTC,I hope it is a Batman driven trailer. We have a whole movie of Cavill. Gimme some Affleck.
DC_Cinematic,3ctny5,temperate,9,Fri Jul 10 18:31:33 2015 UTC,I want some Gadot front and center.
DC_Cinematic,3ctny5,BatBro52,2,Fri Jul 10 20:54:09 2015 UTC,oh double yes
DC_Cinematic,3csv0e,Bodie293,40,Fri Jul 10 14:28:16 2015 UTC,no problem commissioner
DC_Cinematic,3csv0e,heybuddyitsme,8,Fri Jul 10 14:36:23 2015 UTC,Please let this happen :(
DC_Cinematic,3csv0e,TheMurderCapitalist,21,Fri Jul 10 18:38:29 2015 UTC,"Considering they cast a 30 year old to play Luthor, makes sense that Cranston was never truly in the running. They had something else in mind from the beginning I'd guess."
DC_Cinematic,3csv0e,S0ckHeaven,30,Fri Jul 10 14:42:11 2015 UTC,People see Luthor this way:  -Bald  -Bad guy  -Older man  All three of those checked off Cranston's most acclaimed performance. It was the laziest bit of speculative casting I've seen.
DC_Cinematic,3csv0e,alwaysupvoteTRUNKS,9,Fri Jul 10 15:02:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's just typecasting. Some fans have such little ability to imagine actors bald, I remember Vin Diesel being many people's second choice after Cranston.  I'm glad they cast Eisenberg based on his ability to play a certain type of person and not because he was bald."
DC_Cinematic,3csv0e,whatudontlikefalafel,19,Fri Jul 10 18:24:17 2015 UTC,Yeah I really hope he plays Jim Gordon. He'd be perfect
DC_Cinematic,3csv0e,Tecul,8,Fri Jul 10 14:42:37 2015 UTC,Did there ever prove to be anything behind all those rumors that Gordon may not be around at this point in Batman's life?
DC_Cinematic,3csv0e,S0ckHeaven,5,Fri Jul 10 15:08:47 2015 UTC,I don't think so. But even then he could pop up in a prequel or a flashback or something.
DC_Cinematic,3csv0e,KillerPalm,10,Fri Jul 10 15:47:34 2015 UTC,I hated the idea in the first place. People just wanted him to play another shaved head villain and totally typecast the guy.
DC_Cinematic,3csv0e,BryThornton,5,Fri Jul 10 15:32:48 2015 UTC,"I still remember the article Cosmicbooknews put out, saying that Bryan Cranston had already singed on for Lex Luthor and that they would make an announcement when Breaking Bad ended. I've never gone back to their site since then.  Link for the interested."
DC_Cinematic,3csv0e,timetravlrfromthepst,3,Fri Jul 10 18:49:30 2015 UTC,"Man, fuck. I read ""Bryan Cranston"". And then amidst this SDCC stuff, I got all excited and my heart skipped a beat."
DC_Cinematic,3csv0e,TheOneWhoKnocksBitch,4,Fri Jul 10 16:33:40 2015 UTC,"I'd like to believe, that who ever started the rumor that Bryan Cranston was in the running for Lex Luthor misheard ""Eisenberg"" for ""Heisenberg""."
DC_Cinematic,3csv0e,decrepidactyl,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:11:34 2015 UTC,I hope they find a role for him regardless.  With Affleck directing Batman I can really see him playing Gordon since they were both in Argo.  My dream casting is still him as New 52-style Ares. Heisenberg being Wonder Woman's mentor?
DC_Cinematic,3csy5r,Bodie293,9,Fri Jul 10 14:53:54 2015 UTC,Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na... BATMAN! hahaha
DC_Cinematic,3csy5r,Iamtrawk,6,Fri Jul 10 16:05:24 2015 UTC,"How is this? The Conan videos never play on my lap top.. Should I look for a different designation or is it just the usual ""Let's be cool and hate on DC for not making 'fun' movies like Marvel!"" ?  I am a fan of Conan by the way so don't misinterpret that."
DC_Cinematic,3csy5r,KomodoEmiko,11,Fri Jul 10 15:39:18 2015 UTC,Just a parody. No jabs at MoS. Just funny Conan stuff.
DC_Cinematic,3csy5r,temperate,7,Fri Jul 10 16:18:35 2015 UTC,It was actually a pretty good parody. Not a DC hate fest at all.
DC_Cinematic,3csy5r,S0ckHeaven,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:20:43 2015 UTC,Does anyone else think Batman vs Superman is one sided?  Marvel's better since it has real characters not Gods  People who have no knowledge of comics taking a Marvel DC side pisses me the Hell off.
DC_Cinematic,3csy5r,MrCatEater,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:03:51 2015 UTC,You might have adblock enabled. Adblock makes Conan's videos break.
DC_Cinematic,3csy5r,TheExtremistModerate,4,Sat Jul 11 21:24:00 2015 UTC,And he is having that mystery cast show tomorrow...
DC_Cinematic,3csy5r,MAND3L8R0T,5,Fri Jul 10 17:45:21 2015 UTC,Wasn't that the College Humor Pete Holmes Batman parody team?
DC_Cinematic,3csy5r,GotMoFans,3,Fri Jul 10 23:12:44 2015 UTC,"The Batman was certainly, Pete Holmes. Conan is Pete's mentor. I mean for Pete's sake, it was evident. ( 😊)"
DC_Cinematic,3csy5r,dc_fanboyforever,2,Sat Jul 11 05:55:03 2015 UTC,"Quite funny. Best line ever from Superman "" I saved this planet a-hole!"" , Take that haters!"
DC_Cinematic,3cxvu0,JobaccaWookiee,9,Sat Jul 11 19:34:00 2015 UTC,How can anyone be let down after that trailer??????!?!?! You also have to realize they only have so much time and want to market the two movies coming out next.
DC_Cinematic,3cxvu0,BatmanDavey1986,4,Sat Jul 11 19:43:00 2015 UTC,"Well those who went there did get to take a look at the whole Justice League roster concept art and exclusive Suicide Squad footage. To top it all off we got an amazing balls to the wall trailer for BvS. Crown goes to Star Wars? As much as I'm a casual Star Wars fan, the presentation was mainly basing off sentimentalism at this point to hype things up for their future slates. Nothing phenomenal or mind-blowing."
DC_Cinematic,3cxvu0,TimTamDrake,4,Sat Jul 11 20:20:04 2015 UTC,UNDERWHELMING??????? I ALMOST FAINTED LOL I CRIED WITH JOY
DC_Cinematic,3cxvu0,rebelinthought12345,2,Sat Jul 11 20:40:31 2015 UTC,"They may not have revealed much, but that trailer was beyond awesome. There is also a shoddy angle video of the suicide squad trailer floating around."
DC_Cinematic,3cxvu0,wellbluebanana,2,Sat Jul 11 21:16:17 2015 UTC,"What did we learn/get from the Star Wars panel that we didn't already have?  The only new thing I can think of that we learned is that Domnhall Gleason is playing a General for the Empire named Hux, and we got the behind-the-scenes video.  Nothing really new: no trailer, no clips, nothing.    From WB we got a look at the Suicide Squad Cast, a Suicide Squad Trailer, the Green Lantern Corps. announcement, and the new BvS trailer.  I'm as excited for The Force Awakens as the next guy, but WB definitely had the better panel."
DC_Cinematic,3cxvu0,BaltimoreProud,2,Sun Jul 12 00:27:52 2015 UTC,Star Wars? lol
DC_Cinematic,3cxvu0,S0ckHeaven,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:41:24 2015 UTC,"I think if they released SS and BvS trailer afterwards, they could have easily done just that."
DC_Cinematic,3cxvu0,Nimmons09,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:17:09 2015 UTC,"I loved the actual star wars panel and their behind the scenes look. Honestly, I almost teared up a bit with Ford on stage and the practicle effects look in the video. That said, WB blew star wars out of the water with just one of those trailers, the other made it a no contest. Also their floor presence was great with all the costumes and snyder arriving in the batmobile. Their presentation as a whole was unmatched this year."
DC_Cinematic,3cxvu0,PolyUmami,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:26:45 2015 UTC,"No, I know exactly what you mean. I was praying we would get the Justice League assembled on stage, or hear that official casting of Green Lantern and confirmation of The Batman. There were so many places they could have gone, but ultimately they gave us exactly what we expected."
DC_Cinematic,3ctefn,CaptainAaarrrgh,2,Fri Jul 10 16:58:45 2015 UTC,I usually don't like these sort of videos. The ones I've seen are typically a bunch of snarky asshole nerd stereotypes. You guys are really fun to watch though. I'll be looking at some more of your stuff.
DC_Cinematic,3ctefn,CobaltMoon98,2,Fri Jul 10 19:57:01 2015 UTC,Thanks! We're slow about getting these edited but I'll post more soon
DC_Cinematic,3ctefn,TimTamDrake,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:23:40 2015 UTC,"Holy shit I actually enjoyed seeing you guys talk! Video deserves more views. And tbh the guy in the middle (Ellis) looks like the part of John Stewart way more than Tyrese does.   Having seen the Fast and Furious franchise, there's just something about his acting that seems unnatural and forced. Plus if Tyrese wants to even look the part for John like how he traditionally does, he has to bulk-up ALOT. And by a lot I mean ""my head is 1/10th the size of my body"" bulk-up. Still, I'm pretty damn excited to see what WB has up their sleeves for the Green Lanterns."
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,TronVin,18,Thu Jul 9 22:34:30 2015 UTC,HYPE FOR BREAKFAST. HYPE FOR LUNCH. HYPE FOR FUCKING DINNER.
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,LordCommanderStark,16,Thu Jul 9 23:20:12 2015 UTC,Should come sooner than expected it seems.   I'm expecting Leto's Joker as the main villain.
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,_ASAK_,9,Thu Jul 9 23:42:00 2015 UTC,I agree. I don't THINK you attach an Oscar winning actor to your brands most iconic villain to have him play a supporting role in an ensemble piece and that is it. I'd bet the house on Leto co-starring in the Batman movie.
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,S0ckHeaven,14,Fri Jul 10 00:21:10 2015 UTC,"Jared Leto as Joker, Jensen Ackles as Red Hood/Jason Todd, and Bryan Cranston as Commissioner Gordon. Please"
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,legopieface,8,Fri Jul 10 00:18:01 2015 UTC,Jensen Ackles is like 4 years younger than Affleck.
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,ScarletSpeedster17,6,Fri Jul 10 01:16:37 2015 UTC,Age is just a number. With makeup he could pull off 25.
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,legopieface,3,Fri Jul 10 01:33:30 2015 UTC,Daya on OITNB is 2 years younger than the actress who plays her mother.
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,your_mind_aches,7,Fri Jul 10 03:49:46 2015 UTC,I'd love to see Red Hood
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,_ASAK_,5,Fri Jul 10 00:37:30 2015 UTC,I want so badly for Aaron Paul (Breaking Bad) to play Jason Todd. So so badly.
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,yettiornot_hereIcome,3,Fri Jul 10 14:18:47 2015 UTC,That would be much better in my opinion. Jensen Ackles is too old now. It's like all the people who still want Fillion as Hal
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,TheMurderCapitalist,2,Fri Jul 10 14:28:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I see your point. Ap might be too old as well, but if you watch the 5th season of BB you'll see exactly why I want AP for Jason Todd.   Just imagine the climax with him and Batfleck.   I'd also accept Jon Hamm playing Lincoln March in a Court of Owls/Night of the Owls movie."
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,yettiornot_hereIcome,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:32:02 2015 UTC,"Wow, I didn't realize how close in age they were. I think I'd still prefer Aaron Paul but I'm sure either would be great. I'm with you on wanting to see a Court of Owls movie too"
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,TheMurderCapitalist,2,Fri Jul 10 14:43:23 2015 UTC,"When initial announcements about BvS were made, there was a rumour going around that Gordon was already dead."
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,TheOneWhoKnocksBitch,2,Fri Jul 10 13:42:55 2015 UTC,"Have the Joker, but with a plot a little more complex than ""Joker terrorizes Gotham"" again.  Plenty of good stories with the Joker that feature a good amount of Batman's rogues.  I guess in terms of a movie's development, it makes more sense to have Batman vs. 1-2 bad guys + henchmen, but I'd really love a movie that makes it feel like a Batman in the middle of his career facing a ton of different enemies from all sides with differing agenda."
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,Mattyzooks,13,Fri Jul 10 20:03:12 2015 UTC,DOOOOOOOPE!!!!!
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,Tecul,11,Thu Jul 9 22:50:53 2015 UTC,"This is the best possible news to come out of the WB/DC franchise, hands down. In Affleck we trust!"
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,thelastbrew,8,Thu Jul 9 23:11:32 2015 UTC,I'm rock hard right now.
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,The_Dirtiest_Beef,7,Thu Jul 9 23:11:36 2015 UTC,Yes. Oh. my. god. yes.
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,TheAndrewSpence,7,Thu Jul 9 22:54:18 2015 UTC,I'm glad that he will be doing another movie in between BvS and Batman. Keep the creative juices fresh and fight becoming burned out.
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,S0ckHeaven,3,Fri Jul 10 00:22:47 2015 UTC,this is awesome! with a script ready as soon as the end of the summer by one of the best comicbook writers in the industry  holy crap!
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,soulbreaker1418,4,Thu Jul 9 23:50:24 2015 UTC,GEOFF JOHNS! he's the man!

DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,decrepidactyl,3,Fri Jul 10 00:46:27 2015 UTC,I'm really hoping for a proper riddler or red hood storyline
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,Mudkip4567,3,Fri Jul 10 04:36:38 2015 UTC,This is huge! I just thought Chris Terrio was gonna write it but GEOFF MOTHERFUCKING JOHNS co-writing?!?! Best birthday ever.
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,lionheart4k,8,Fri Jul 10 06:05:48 2015 UTC,"BATFLECK DIRECTING FUCK YES. I absolutely am not a fan of the DC TV shows that Geoff Johns writes BUT I really enjoy his comics. Not sure many people know DC like johns does so I would love it if he became the ""Kevin feige"" of the DCEU. This sort of spoils the SDCC panel a bit but fuck it I guess we just want it all now!"
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,letsgetweirdkbye,14,Fri Jul 10 00:35:10 2015 UTC,You don't like The Flash?   I just lost a bet. I swore your kind didn't exsist.
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,BatmanDavey1986,3,Fri Jul 10 00:59:59 2015 UTC,Extremely excited for The Flash movie.
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,letsgetweirdkbye,-1,Fri Jul 10 03:29:16 2015 UTC,He's referring to the TV show.

DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,letsgetweirdkbye,6,Sat Jul 11 03:06:59 2015 UTC,"I think his hands are tied a bit with Arrow & Flash, though I generally enjoy it. But he has to write a show that fits the CW teen drama formula. I'd say that has more to do with what bugs me about those shows than anything (and it can REALLY bug me, lol). Being freed up to write in a drastically different cinematic universe tone wise should be good."
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,S0ckHeaven,5,Fri Jul 10 01:47:19 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, I think a lot of the stuff people don't like comes from CW (or at least what they're looking for in a show) than Johns. But if they're the channel that allows us to have these shows, go right on ahead. GA had had it's moments and Flash has been really good so far."
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,Rick60,0,Fri Jul 10 01:54:16 2015 UTC,GA Season 2 and Flash Season 1 are pure comic book fun.
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,Mattyzooks,2,Fri Jul 10 20:04:17 2015 UTC,"Is Geoff Johns not attached to the Suicide Squad in some capacity as well? Sounds pretty cool nonetheless. Having someone with, what I assume would be, an encyclopedic knowledge about Batman and DC can only help in telling a story with Batman who already has a history of crime fighting and what have you. Not a fan of the writing in the CW shows at all, but I'd be sooner to blame that on the team who brought us 2011's Green Lantern.."
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,KomodoEmiko,-3,Fri Jul 10 15:34:56 2015 UTC,"On one hand, it makes me think they aren't super confident in the rest of their DCCU slate. On the other hand, more god damned Batman. So........ I'm all in!"
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,jasonhaven,15,Thu Jul 9 23:57:39 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be concerned, we knew that a Batman movie was in the slate since the day they announced everything else."
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,S0ckHeaven,2,Fri Jul 10 00:14:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not overly concerned myself, but I could see the execs having a bit of pause, considering DC/WB has only really had success with Batman and Superman flicks.   Also, why am I being downvoted for being excited about more Batman? Sheesh, tough crowd."
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,jasonhaven,2,Fri Jul 10 14:36:40 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but I think them announcing a Cyborg movie 5 years in advance, for example, speaks more to their confidence level then them including a Batman movie in the slate."
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,S0ckHeaven,2,Fri Jul 10 14:40:20 2015 UTC,"I don't really believe movie schedules until about 2 years out, personally, but fair point!"

DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,S0ckHeaven,0,Fri Jul 10 15:04:18 2015 UTC,"Basically that movie studios have change their minds (reasonable) plenty of times in regards to what movies release at all, and then when.

DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,jasonhaven,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:53:29 2015 UTC,I agree that your comment was not deserving of down votes. Just opinion.
DC_Cinematic,3cqb2h,S0ckHeaven,-6,Fri Jul 10 15:05:28 2015 UTC,This is the first DCCU news in awhile that's actually got me a little bit excited.

It was one of the biggest problems with Gotham, it didn't pick a tone. She fit some of the wilder and comedic scenes, but definitely didn't when it went full-cop-drama.

DC_Cinematic,3cp2so,mrthewhite,5,Thu Jul 9 18:20:36 2015 UTC,I'm not a fan of a lot of talented actors in real life but appreciate their talent. Will Smith is a great actor and I think the movie will be better for him being in it. His wife is decent and his kids are not very good actors. But I'm glad that HE is in the movie.
DC_Cinematic,3cp2so,S0ckHeaven,-3,Thu Jul 9 18:23:02 2015 UTC,I generally overlook an actors off screen personality as well but there are always exceptions and given that Smith typically plays himself in his roles I find most of the characters he plays as obnoxious as he is.

Luthor would have the resources and inventiveness to double up Batman's. Together they would be the best shot humanity had of stopping Superman. The question Batman would then run into would be ""should we?""  Superman has huge implications for the entire world, but he's a good person. He could do great things. That's where Bruce would eventually turn on Lex; recognizing that power may corrupt, but jealousy of power can be equally as corrupting."

As is a third Jump Street movie. However, they could stay on as writers or producers on those projects.   Am I missing something? This is complete speculation by The Hollywood Reporter at this point and they even state they could stay on as writers which would play a huge role in the quality of the film"
DC_Cinematic,3cgtiy,TheMurderCapitalist,-5,Tue Jul 7 22:05:33 2015 UTC,"still, it takes out them directing Flash, I can't understand america's fascination with Star Wars. I think Aliens, Trek, Blade Runner and heck even Total Recall are better scifi franchises."

DC_Cinematic,3cgtiy,TheMurderCapitalist,3,Tue Jul 7 23:24:50 2015 UTC,This is correct. They were involved in treatment and screenplay planning only. They even denied that they were attached to direct. It is pure speculation.

DC_Cinematic,3cgtiy,TheJoshider10,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:15:50 2015 UTC,"Still, with apparently no one in charge of the whole thing it seems each movie is more about being a stand alone thing with the odd references as opposed to constantly being reminded it's in a connected universe. By this logic a Flash movie can be self contained and have it's own tone and feel and as long as it doesn't conflict with anything else in the universe it'll be fine."

He's supposed to have like 3 different suits so I think he'll upgrade as needed- kind of like what Marvel does with Ironman. I just hope they incorporate some of the more popular suits in some way.  I'd love to see Noel, and maybe (highly unlikely) a sinestro corps outfit"
DC_Cinematic,3cg5s4,King-Grimm,6,Tue Jul 7 18:18:10 2015 UTC,I hope not.  This is the best batsuit.  Why fix what isn't broken.
DC_Cinematic,3cg5s4,JeremyIsSpecial,8,Tue Jul 7 19:25:02 2015 UTC,"That batsuit he is currently wearing for BVS is designed more for striking fear into the hearts of Gothams criminal scum, I don't think aliens or super villains would be scared of a man dressed as a bat. Bruce needs a batsuit for different situations."
DC_Cinematic,3cg5s4,JeremyIsSpecial,10,Tue Jul 7 19:36:14 2015 UTC,Batman does fight super villains wearing that suit though.  It's Batmans reputation that really frightens criminals.

DC_Cinematic,3cg5s4,JeremyIsSpecial,5,Tue Jul 7 21:37:00 2015 UTC,They wouldn't fear him regardless of what he wears.
DC_Cinematic,3cg5s4,SardonicAndroid,4,Tue Jul 7 21:58:47 2015 UTC,Re read my comment and I have no idea were I was going with that.
DC_Cinematic,3cg5s4,BatmanDavey1986,11,Tue Jul 7 22:03:53 2015 UTC,I bet he wears just a thong in the Justice League movies. Let's see Brainiac deal with some man booty.
DC_Cinematic,3cg5s4,gmark109,5,Tue Jul 7 22:22:47 2015 UTC,"Since BvS is supposed to be Bruce getting out of semiretirement, I guess the suit he wears is older. Once he joins the League, he'll probably upgrade to something like this new 52 suit. Fingers crossed for the Hellbat though."
DC_Cinematic,3cg5s4,legopieface,3,Tue Jul 7 21:49:05 2015 UTC,I hope not. Buying merchandise is a pain in the ass for Marvel stuff because they change costumes every other day. I'd really like to pick up some Hot Toys of Batman and Superman next year.

DC_Cinematic,3cg5s4,TheMurderCapitalist,7,Tue Jul 7 18:04:58 2015 UTC,I think that Batman is going to upgrade his suit either at the end of BvS or the start of JL
DC_Cinematic,3cg5s4,Justice_Prince,11,Tue Jul 7 18:09:13 2015 UTC,Maybe he find a way to make is armored Batsuit more flexible maybe something like the Arkham Knight Batsuit.
DC_Cinematic,3cg5s4,Boopa1219,5,Tue Jul 7 18:11:02 2015 UTC,The Arkham Knight suit would be perfect IMO
DC_Cinematic,3cg5s4,Justice_Prince,2,Tue Jul 7 22:11:33 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if they'll actually address it.  I bet he'll just show up in a slightly different suit.
DC_Cinematic,3cg5s4,Boopa1219,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:42:50 2015 UTC,"It has to be addressed. This is the first time that Batman will be alongside other super powered heroes, and BvS he is going to realize that he is out powered alongside the rest of the JL and the threats that he'll encounter from here on out. That's a huge realization for Batman and that moment has to ve captured."
DC_Cinematic,3cg5s4,rynwdhs,3,Tue Jul 7 22:15:15 2015 UTC,I donkt think his suit will be that different though.  I mean i donkt want to see him turning into Iron Man every time he has to team up with the Justice League.
DC_Cinematic,3cg5s4,ironphan24,2,Tue Jul 7 22:34:54 2015 UTC,"Marvel never explains why Tony upgrades his suits. He just shows up in them, they tried in IM3 but it was quickly glossed over. By explaining why Bruce does this it'll differentiate them from Marvel.    And who said he'll get a new suit every movie, he'll only need to do it once."
DC_Cinematic,3cg5s4,dexstarrr,3,Tue Jul 7 22:40:06 2015 UTC,"I've never been fully open to the extended cowl.  It by itself is a good look, but I think on Batman, having it blend into the symbol compromises too much of the iconic look.  I wouldn't mind seeing a version of this where it stood out better, whether that be through a color separation or stronger layering."
DC_Cinematic,3cg5s4,invisiblack,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:28:52 2015 UTC,I see what you mean. That's very true. Maybe if he was any other superhero than Batman It'd fit :P

DC_Cinematic,3cg5s4,oracle1124,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:17:21 2015 UTC,True. I always end up looking at promos a few times before I actually notice the design changes to any of the Avengers (not trying to compare here) but he has so many suits that by Justice League hes bound to be different. Hoping that he doesn't have to compete with Cyborg for the role as the teams tech person
DC_Cinematic,3cg5s4,Zeno84,2,Sat Jul 11 22:28:28 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. The Nolan movies were one thing but the MCU has shown that superheroes can upgrade their costumes in a very natural way and that's the beset way to do it in live action.   Iron Man and Cap get a new suit or multiple new suits every movie, Black Widow had a different costume with every appearance as did Hawkeye."

DC_Cinematic,3cg5s4,theweepingwarrior,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:11:39 2015 UTC,"Jeez, I don't expect them to have new suits debut EVERY movie like Marvel (and they shouldn't do it just because Marvel does it), but I expect Batman to operate in a slightly armor-heavy suit (Batman: Arkham Knight Batsuit comes to mind) that allows more fluid movement than his regular Batsuit. For his solo movies and cameos in other movies, I'd say he can use the DKReturns suit, with slight (slight, not entirely noticeable) upgrades being added throughout the stories, like in the Arkham Games. Actually, I'd go out on a limb and say that they should use the Arkham Games as a basis for most Batman stories in this Universe, but that's a topic for another time."

DC_Cinematic,3ccyw6,wmtiger86,10,Mon Jul 6 23:09:04 2015 UTC,"Lead is heavier than and not as strong as steel. Plus lead poisoning. It's probably some scifi comic book alloy, with Lead-lining in between layers."
DC_Cinematic,3ccyw6,MiQBonafide,6,Tue Jul 7 01:37:16 2015 UTC,"Let's see...  The average steel plate armour is said to have weighed about 60lbs (27.2kg). If Bats' suit was made of steel, it would easily weigh 90-100lbs (45.4kg) judging by sheer size alone.  Density of steel is about 7.8g/cm3. If that's the case then the volume of Batman's armour is probably around 5820cm3.  Now, density of lead is about 11.34g/cm3. That would make the mass of the lead suit 65.998kg (145.5lb).  This figure is probably a minimum one.  Pretty heavy, but not unreasonable to assume Batman could carry it - him being a peak human and all."
DC_Cinematic,3ccyw6,DerringerHK,6,Mon Jul 6 23:47:45 2015 UTC,Don't forget that the EW article mentioned a strength augmentation feature in the Bat-armor.
DC_Cinematic,3ccyw6,GentlemanGearGrinder,10,Tue Jul 7 00:07:09 2015 UTC,Of course. Probably an exoskeleton of some sort. Might also allow him to throw super punches.  krypto superpunch = sad Kal

People like the darker vigilante. I think it speaks to the human psyche more easily rather than the god-like being that we can’t really understand. Once we have a more expansive universe we can delve more into the character of Superman and hopefully tell more stories.”"
DC_Cinematic,3cbopy,legopieface,7,Mon Jul 6 17:42:43 2015 UTC,I think Metallo would be perfect for MoS2. He would use Kryptonite to bring Superman down to the level of a human. He would challenge Superman with the fear of his own mortality.

And if we're being serious film fans here, I think it's only fair that we wait to see the films before making judgements. Your post has insight and opinion, without forcing an uneducated opinion. I cannot wait to share opinions and takes on the films to come.    WITH THAT SAID: everything i've heard/seen from the directors, actors, and MOS is consistent with our hopes and expectations. DC's characters are larger than life, iconic figures that stand for more than just, say, their own ego as we've seen in other comic book films. DC isn't making superhero movies, they're making movies about superheroes."

DC_Cinematic,3c1e6d,wizsativa420,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:15:12 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying I don't think he's talking about a specific film.  Hopefully Miller still has two more Mad Max in him, and Affleck will probably try to get a Hollywood blockbuster under his belt before that.  That could very well end up being Batman, but he could also be talking about a non superhero blockbuster."
DC_Cinematic,3c1e6d,Justice_Prince,3,Sat Jul 4 06:23:33 2015 UTC,"I was thinking, the Solo batman film should just be a straight adaptation of the Court of Owls. Nightwing, Red Hood, Tim Drake and maybe even Damian, all active. Big mystery about the owls, could be perfect."
DC_Cinematic,3c1e6d,YoureASoldierBodie,7,Sat Jul 4 00:28:01 2015 UTC,"Personally I think the first movie should be an adaption of Under the Red Hood, but mix it up a bit by having it take place at the time that Bruce has just taken Tim Drake under his wing.  I think it would be really cool to see an Arkham Asylum movie too.  I'd put this as the second film, but it could be the first too.  I'd cap off the trilogy with Court of Owls film as the third one.  I'm not really sure if I want to see Damian.  If they did I'd want him introduced in a movie that focused on Ra's al Ghul.  I wouldn't mind seeing another Ra's al Ghul film.  Really though I'd not see Damian for a good while though.  Maybe in a fourth film, and after a Crisis reboot."
DC_Cinematic,3c1e6d,Justice_Prince,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:53:00 2015 UTC,Thinking faaaaaaar ahead but I like your thought on the court of owls. Personally I'd like Damian introduced in the first and a death of the family sequel. Damian dying of course. It would instantly separate marvel v DC on real human drama IMO.
DC_Cinematic,3c1e6d,wizsativa420,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:58:52 2015 UTC,I guess one advantage Damian has is given that he's already been trained by ninjas it's much less reckless for Batman to let this minor fight crime.  I guess I'd rather see a more classic Batman & Robin dynamic plus even though this is a older Batman I think preestablishing a third Robin who existed before the movies is one too many.
DC_Cinematic,3c1e6d,Justice_Prince,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:18:32 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't want Damian in this universe. I'm a fan of having the 3 previous Robin's, but to me Bruce's main interest should either be Catwoman or Wonder Woman.   Plus it's only the first film. No need to have so many characters already. I'd even be happy with just Nightwing and Tim, with hints at Jason to set up a sequel."

DC_Cinematic,3bzofr,theweepingwarrior,8,Fri Jul 3 15:57:50 2015 UTC,"My only concern is that people will compare the ""social commentary"" of this film to that of Captain America Civil War which is supposed to be treading in similar territory. And because moviegoers and critics alike have a hard on for Marvel, the latter will be received much better and the former unfortunately will be looked at as a loss, critically.  I really hope I'm wrong, as I fucking loved Man Of Steel and just about every casting/creative decision the DCCU has made since then. It's just worrying sometime to see the amount of hate online, because that sort of hate is potentially influencing the studio's decision either trying too hard to please everyone or worst case scenario it gets scrapped like Green Lantern and Superman Returns (granted those films were pretty bad, but people hate on MOS like it was no better).  Also, Gal Gadot is a total fox. Can't wait to see her kick ass."

Although if they wanted to establish Grayson as Nightwing, and that Jason is dead I think it might streamline things in this already packed movie if they just said both were Robin at the same time rather then explaining two separate Robins.  And yeah the comic timelines are a bit messy too.  Honestly I would have preferred if they had done something like I'm suggesting in the New 52 as well rather then making it so that Tim Drake was never a Robin."

I honestly believe a Red Hood setup is going to be incorporated into the batman solo film with maybe riddler because of the Easter egg, and El mayimbe said a night wing signed on, but of course it could be bs."
DC_Cinematic,3c2rkr,ricky_the_unicorn096,0,Sun Jul 5 06:00:28 2015 UTC,I doubt Jason will exist in the DCCU.  I think the Robin Joker killed was Dick Grayson.

DC_Cinematic,3c2rkr,mikerogram,0,Sun Jul 5 23:11:47 2015 UTC,"I view it as everything in the Dark Knight Returns should be considered source material.  That said, I think we're getting Dick Grayson as Nightwing, Jason Todd will be lost to the Joker, and the next 15 years will be geared toward setting up a live action Dark Knight Returns. If they go without Robin for the next 15 years, they don't inspire 12-year-olds to run around in green trunks getting their asses kicked."
DC_Cinematic,3c2rkr,doyleb3620,-2,Sun Jul 5 17:27:34 2015 UTC,"At that point, you may just want to go with one Robin. I know we all love Nightwing, but it'd be tough to incorporate all of that in a 2-3 hr. film.   I mean, think about the setup. ""Yeah Robin died. Now here's another Robin, all grown up."" You'll end up with either a somewhat confused mainstream audience, or a movie that gives you hamfisted exposition."
DC_Cinematic,3c2rkr,KomodoEmiko,3,Sat Jul 4 14:01:03 2015 UTC,"I guess they wouldn't really need to get specific about it either way.  Just have Batman come to Nightwing for help taking down Superman, and Grayson is like, ""Srcew your Bruce.  I told you I was done with you after Jason died."""

DC_Cinematic,3c21cr,KimJongPooonn,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:24:26 2015 UTC,"I think at this point, Aquaman is more likely to be it, maybe in some kind of revolt against humanity where he could assume the destruction and damage to the ocean, from Man of Steel, was their doing. It would certainly cement his status as a force to be reckoned with in upcoming films if that would be the case.  But really, it'll most likely have something to do with Luthor."

DC_Cinematic,3bwg5g,actin_and_myosin,13,Thu Jul 2 20:27:48 2015 UTC,"It's kinda funny how people initially said WB/DC was ""rushing"" into BvS(because they didn't have a solo Batman film or MOS2 first) when they spent 3 years between this film and Man of Steel setting things up and they've literally been trying to do Batman/Superman right for decades.  Not trying to knock Marvel but they went from Iron Man to Avengers in 4 years and are about to start doing 3 films/year, WB is taking their time if anything. Hopefully the wait pays off."
DC_Cinematic,3bwg5g,whatudontlikefalafel,15,Thu Jul 2 22:44:53 2015 UTC,"You're underselling Marvel a bit. They were able to do that due to smart planning, with one man controlling the overall narrative. With DC we have no clear leader and it seems like Snyder is the creative man in charge right now.   The year wait could prove to be massively beneficial. That extra year could not only make BvS a better film individually, but it could also lead to a better plan for the future."
DC_Cinematic,3bwg5g,TheJoshider10,9,Thu Jul 2 23:05:08 2015 UTC,"My bad, I didn't mean for it to come off that way. What Marvel was able to accomplish in 5 years was tremendous, and you can see how they've inspired the entire film industry.  That said, it's ironic that Marvel fanboys(not fans, but militant side-takers) think WB's approach is rushing when in reality they're taking their time. They gave themselves an extra year to make BvS work because fast tracking a sequel rarely works(Iron Man 2). And while they haven't given each of their heroes their own film like Marvel did, part of that reason is Batman and the others are already pretty well known by the public."
DC_Cinematic,3bwg5g,whatudontlikefalafel,4,Fri Jul 3 00:20:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah DC aren't going the simple ""solo then team up"" route because they don't need to. Literally the only character that needed introducing was Superman as they needed to show how different this portrayal is, and now we have Batman as well.   The solos will be interesting and hopefully DC make full use of the fact they own every license for their heroes."

DC_Cinematic,3bvme2,Colticus,2,Fri Jul 3 03:00:47 2015 UTC,I love Gal as Wonder Woman. Looks more Greek/Exotic. As Diana should.
DC_Cinematic,3bvme2,TheJoshider10,-3,Fri Jul 3 16:51:12 2015 UTC,My only issue with Batman so far is that despite being 6'4 every picture or clip of him makes him look chubby. Yet in the concept art he looks very reminiscent of Jim Lee's design.   Here's hoping he looks less fat in film.
DC_Cinematic,3bvme2,DerJakane,-1,Thu Jul 2 16:16:03 2015 UTC,No I idea why you got downvoted. This very legitamate (?) criticism. I partially agree although i really wouldn't mind if he looked like in the teaser.

DC_Cinematic,3bw9ty,huskman,-1,Tue Jul 7 16:24:39 2015 UTC,"That's the thing. The defining characteristic of most podcasts is shitty production value (when compared to actual television/radio).  The closest any tech-related audio podcast comes to professionalism is Leo Laporte's The Tech Guy, because it actually IS a professional radio show that's broadcast across the country and is hosted by a professional who doesn't trip over his words and has a professional presentation style and voice.   There are other actual radio shows that are hosted by professionals, that are re-distributed via podcast as well. Backstory, from The American History Guys is also extremely well done, but again, it's an actual, professional broadcast. Same thing with Radiolab.  I think one of the best podcasts out there is 99% Invisible, but again, it was originally a professional broadcast over the air.   Even some audio podcasts that started life as podcasts, that are well-written and performed, suffer from poor production quality. For instance, The Memory Palace tries really hard, but the audio quality is inconsistent, and the voice of the host sometimes falters. He just needs more practice.  Serial is well produced, but it's more of a self-contained series than an ongoing podcast. And it's produced by actual radio professionals.  And the closest any video podcast that I've seen so far comes to professionalism is The New Screensavers, because they've got the actual producers from the old Screensavers shows involved, and they're copying the format and production verbatim from the old TV show. They have broadcast quality cameras (sort of) and lighting (sort of), and graphics (for the most part), but they're lacking a makeup artist, which could really help them look a lot better on camera."

DC_Cinematic,3bsmvx,TheJoshider10,4,Thu Jul 2 00:28:49 2015 UTC,Honestly seeing any font except the one from the DCAU for Justice League will feel strange to me.
DC_Cinematic,3bsmvx,GentlemanGearGrinder,0,Thu Jul 2 00:29:33 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think we're getting any footage from Suicide Squad, mostly because the film is still shooting. They aren't going to have any footage edited, color corrected, audio mixed, composited, or scored by now unless they shot something as a teaser that will never be apart of the final film."
DC_Cinematic,3bsmvx,soulbreaker1418,2,Sat Jul 4 04:38:19 2015 UTC,"last year they had a teaser ready with barely a few weeks of shooting, they can do it"
DC_Cinematic,3bsmvx,AspiringAuthor07,8,Thu Jul 9 23:54:50 2015 UTC,"I wish WB's Hall H panel would be completely dedicated to their DC Cinematic Universe, but they've already confirmed that it would focus largely on Batman v. Superman (with Affleck, Cavill, Gadot, Eisenberg, Hunt, Adams, and Iron in attendance), the movie Pan, and The Man from U.N.C.L.E.  with ""one or two surprises"".   (Source: http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/455737-warner-bros-reveals-plans-for-hall-h-panel-featuring-batman-v-superman-cast#/slide/1)  As to what those surprises may be? I think it will probably be a teaser trailer for Suicide Squad, and I'm hoping, like many of you, they march the whole Justice League cast - including the Green Lantern - onto stage. If not that, hopefully firm details on any of the other films on DC' slate BESIDES Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad."
DC_Cinematic,3bsmvx,dc_fanboyforever,10,Thu Jul 2 01:59:34 2015 UTC,"It is my great hope that, we will see all JL actors together on stage, like Snyder after the long panel says one more thing and Hall H erupts.  It would be awesome on the part of WB to announce their Vertigo films (even if it is just Sandman). I hope Zack talks about JL as the ultimate goal and also calms down the fans saying to take it one step at a time, but totally doing a 180 and calling all JL members including GL (at this point I don't care which GL, for all I know it could be Ch'p or B'Dg). I hope Jesse Eisenberg is slightly more enthusiastic on stage!"
DC_Cinematic,3bsmvx,dc_fanboyforever,5,Wed Jul 1 23:37:38 2015 UTC,F-Sharp Bell!
DC_Cinematic,3bsmvx,S0ckHeaven,3,Thu Jul 2 00:00:25 2015 UTC,"Wow! I didn't even know GL had blind or beings who can't see perceive light! Rot Lop Fan FTW, take that Racoon!"
DC_Cinematic,3bsmvx,whatudontlikefalafel,5,Thu Jul 2 00:08:19 2015 UTC,I actually don't care a ton about who is there. It is cool to see but that doesn't really last. Not for me anyways. So I'm far more interested in what news we get.
DC_Cinematic,3bsmvx,soulbreaker1418,5,Thu Jul 2 00:08:23 2015 UTC,"Green Lantern isnt out for 5 years, I could see them holding off for a bit longer. But what about Shazam? They have his villain cast, and he's in between Flasha me Cyborg who have actors attached."
DC_Cinematic,3bsmvx,KomodoEmiko,7,Thu Jul 2 18:15:50 2015 UTC,"The Green Lantern film may be awhile put, but Justice League is only a few years out and they already have everyone else cast.  That said, I would love to find out more about Shazam!"

DC_Cinematic,3bsmvx,BatmanDavey1986,3,Thu Jul 9 23:56:48 2015 UTC,"If I were a betting man-  BvS, Suicide Squad, and some kind of celebration or acknowledgement of the Justice League, whether it be just the official logo or what have you."
DC_Cinematic,3bsmvx,decrepidactyl,3,Sat Jul 4 01:19:03 2015 UTC,I just hope they will give us some SS teaser with actual footage from the movie.
DC_Cinematic,3bsmvx,BatmanDavey1986,2,Sat Jul 4 11:03:05 2015 UTC,"What time, EST, will the DC/WB panel be going down on Saturday?  Are we gonna have a live thread? Who are the best bloggers to follow?"
DC_Cinematic,3bsmvx,soulbreaker1418,2,Thu Jul 9 01:28:22 2015 UTC,"Just in case you haven't figured it out, it is 1:30pm EST - and I am sure there will be a live thread happening tomorrow."

DC_Cinematic,3bwgo7,BattleReadyPenguin,5,Thu Jul 2 18:43:01 2015 UTC,"""Might HAVE been"".  Sorry to be that guy but for f sake it has to stop!"
DC_Cinematic,3bsj73,Bodie293,2,Wed Jul 1 20:12:03 2015 UTC,"3 films over 90 minutes... That should give them enough time to present a meaty clip. This is their last Comic Con before BvS premieres so they'll have to make it count. If Holly Hunter and Jeremy Irons are present I hope that means they'll shed more light on the plot. It's a shame Suicide Squad won't be featured, but maybe they'll have a surprise teaser."
DC_Cinematic,3bs5i3,Si3PO,6,Wed Jul 1 18:35:34 2015 UTC,Probably just Suicide Squad. But maybe Justice League?
DC_Cinematic,3bs5i3,Nick3570,5,Wed Jul 1 20:57:49 2015 UTC,Really hoping for a Justice League assembly
DC_Cinematic,3bs5i3,TheMurderCapitalist,2,Wed Jul 1 21:03:44 2015 UTC,JL doesn't assemble they disassemble anyone who threatens earth/humanity/universe/multiverse!

DC_Cinematic,3bs5i3,timetravlrfromthepst,2,Wed Jul 1 22:17:30 2015 UTC,It'll undoubtedly get recorded.
DC_Cinematic,3bs5i3,DerringerHK,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:02:48 2015 UTC,Why undoubtedly? The Age of Ultron trailer from last year did not get released.  I think the security has been upped a lot lately to prevent leaks.
DC_Cinematic,3bs5i3,vidiyan2857,4,Thu Jul 2 06:14:01 2015 UTC,Maybe we'll get the announcement that Rock is playing both Black Adam and Shazaam.
DC_Cinematic,3brpzs,Melanismdotcom,7,Wed Jul 1 16:43:49 2015 UTC,The hype! It burns us!

DC_Cinematic,3brpzs,LordCommanderStark,2,Thu Jul 2 01:06:24 2015 UTC,Tfw a Barbie doll looks better than an action figure
DC_Cinematic,3brpzs,legopieface,-10,Wed Jul 1 20:47:02 2015 UTC,Wonder Woman designed as a doll more than a bloody action figure?! This must be fake or some sick joke.
DC_Cinematic,3brpzs,BattleReadyPenguin,13,Wed Jul 1 16:48:58 2015 UTC,"Wonder Woman will be arguably one of the most popular female icons in the next few years. It only makes sense to market her to young girls in this fashion. Ofcourse, I'm sure there will action figures as well."
DC_Cinematic,3brpzs,thelastbrew,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:27:59 2015 UTC,Yeah there will most likely be a Wonder Woman action figure in the same line as well as stand alone figures for Batman and Superman.  Batman has like three suits in this movie so theyll have to make figures for each of those as well as sell a batnmobile he can ride in.
DC_Cinematic,3brpzs,Justice_Prince,4,Sun Jul 12 03:33:17 2015 UTC,They all look like dolls to me.
DC_Cinematic,3brpzs,faggot_human_trash,9,Wed Jul 1 18:52:55 2015 UTC,Did you really think they wouldn't make a Barbie Wonder Woman? Can you imagine how much cash WB would just be leaving on the table?
DC_Cinematic,3brpzs,JimmyBing,3,Wed Jul 1 17:30:09 2015 UTC,They did say they where trying to market WW more than the other other two so you are right.

DC_Cinematic,3bo5oi,ThunderHawkLives,3,Wed Jul 1 15:08:02 2015 UTC,Yup.
DC_Cinematic,3bo5oi,JamesTheGent,13,Wed Jul 1 16:03:04 2015 UTC,This makes sense since Conan's show typically shoots on the WB lot

DC_Cinematic,3bo5oi,IAmLuckyDuckling,8,Tue Jun 30 20:20:19 2015 UTC,TBS IS owned by Time Warner... it's possible.
DC_Cinematic,3bo5oi,IIIISuperDudeIIII,3,Tue Jun 30 20:38:35 2015 UTC,Remember in the Dark Knight Returns movie were Conan voiced the late night host who interviewed the joker. It would be sweet if he did that but for real with Jared leto.

DC_Cinematic,3bo5oi,Colticus,3,Fri Jul 3 16:44:50 2015 UTC,"The only other believable cast is X-Men, I 100% agree with you on that it will be the trinity, with Mamoa and (hopefully) Pine as GL"

DC_Cinematic,3bo5oi,Zeno84,2,Wed Jul 1 01:09:15 2015 UTC,There's also a very low chance that it's the Suicide Squad cast. I think it would be awesome if they were in character during the show.

DC_Cinematic,3bn5tj,Melanismdotcom,4,Tue Jun 30 15:47:58 2015 UTC,$30 for those wondering.

DC_Cinematic,3bn5tj,tHobbs,5,Tue Jun 30 17:29:18 2015 UTC,When Lego makes a brand new piece and the price is still normal I love them. Just look at some of the Lego diver sets from this year. 600 pieces and a molded piece so the price is 120$ it's ridiculous.
DC_Cinematic,3bnyeh,demasx,13,Tue Jun 30 19:07:49 2015 UTC,The legend goes that all of Hollywood's weird shit gets re-gifted to Guillermo.

DC_Cinematic,3bodje,Bodie293,3,Tue Jun 30 20:56:58 2015 UTC,..... that's a lot of writing
DC_Cinematic,3blxkh,invisiblack,8,Tue Jun 30 07:51:44 2015 UTC,Pearl Street is Ben's (and Matt's) production company.  Never heard of Batfilm tho.  SDCC is just a little under 2 weeks away. expect some announcement
DC_Cinematic,3blxkh,MiQBonafide,2,Tue Jun 30 08:26:07 2015 UTC,"I really hope at SDCC they add Dark Universe, Sandman, The Batman and Man of Steel 2 to the DC line-up.    Edit: did a quick Google of Batfilm Productions. They are one of the production companies who worked on the 2005 Constantine film. Very little information about them otherwise..."

DC_Cinematic,3bmxo2,DerringerHK,9,Tue Jun 30 14:47:48 2015 UTC,Something to do with Luthor.
DC_Cinematic,3bmxo2,MiQBonafide,5,Tue Jun 30 15:14:46 2015 UTC,"It could go one of two ways in my mind, either the new threat is something Luthor creates in this film that Batman and Superman have to deal with at the end of the film, or it's something bigger that comes out and becomes the villain for Justice League.  If it's the first option then it's going to be one of these three, either Bizarro, Doomsday, or Metallo. Any of those three could be something Luthor creates to kill Superman and could easily be explained as to how he creates them. If it's something bigger then I would bet my money that it's Brainiac, while tampering with the Kryptonian tech Luthor accidentally releases the Brainiac AI within it, and much like Zod in MoS when he does so the AI alerts Brainiac to the location of Superman, the last remaining piece of Krypton. By doing this Brainiac also becomes aware of Earth, which he intends to ""collect"" the information of, which would result in the destruction of the planet."
DC_Cinematic,3bmxo2,KyleRaynerGotSweg,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:35:22 2015 UTC,Wouldn't that braniac origin be like almost the same as Age of Ultron?
DC_Cinematic,3bmxo2,xxbeast15,3,Tue Jun 30 15:49:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, Ultron was created by Stark as a defense system for the world, ultimately Ultron believes that he has to destroy humanity to save Earth. Brainiac was not created by Luthor or any human, he's an alien being. Yes he is an android like Ultron but I don't think that should dissuade DC from using him, their origins are vastly different and their personalities and desires are not really too similar in mind, other than threatening the world I think that they could easily make them different enough to avoid comparisons. To start Brainiac does not despise humanity in the slightest like Ultron does, in fact Brainiac believes he is helping humanity in some ways. He is known as the collector of worlds for a reason, he goes across the universe collecting the information and sometimes cities of the people there to preserve their history, in his mind these worlds are doomed anyway and he does this to keep their knowledge and memory alive. Along with that I don't see Brainiac like Ultron in terms of personality either, he is cold and calculating and doesn't feel hate or anger like Ultron did, no snarky comments or witty banter either."
DC_Cinematic,3bmxo2,KyleRaynerGotSweg,2,Tue Jun 30 16:04:53 2015 UTC,"And Brainiac isn't even an android in all incarnations, a lot of times he is an alien, so if they went that route, it would definitely be different enough I'd say"
DC_Cinematic,3bmxo2,TheMurderCapitalist,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:03:01 2015 UTC,"Ok. I wasn't saying personality wise I was saying origin wise. Ultron was not actually created by Tony Stark the official deep story is Ultron was his Iron Legion but he needed another AI to control them. He looked into the scepter and found the Mind Gem. The Mind Gem is actually a sentient being. Originally I think the Mind Gem in the comics was created from a celestial dieing. His mind was the Mind Gem. When Tony looked into the Scepter, he found this ""Program"" for an actual mind. It was Ultrons original Celestial copy mind. When Ultron is created he ""wakes up"". I was saying it would be similar because ""Smartest man in the world fiddles with alien technology and accidentally creates Alien AI that wants to take over the world"" So Ultron wasn't actually created by Tony Stark or Bruce Banner, if anything they just helped him out of his shell. Another theory is the program was put into the Gem by Thanos as a fail-safe in case Loki lost or got too big for his bridges. And Ultron didn't just hate humanity he wanted them to evolve. He may have even seen the Inhumans gene in humans and thought if they went extinct the stronger ones would evolve into Inhumans and come out stronger."
DC_Cinematic,3bmxo2,xxbeast15,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:30:43 2015 UTC,"I wasn't entirely clear on that when I saw AoU so you're probably correct about that, the idea of his consciousness coming from the Mind Gem makes a hell of a lot more sense. In that chase there is a definite similarity between Brainiac and Ultron, but I still think that DC shouldn't hesitate to use Brainiac if they want to, in the end I see them as different enough to not have it be a big deal. Then again I'm not sure if I want to deal with people who come out and cry that DC copied Marvel or vice versa, Ultron was created after Brainiac and both companies have copied each other so many times that it just annoys me when people accuse one of them of copying the other."
DC_Cinematic,3bmxo2,KyleRaynerGotSweg,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:06:23 2015 UTC,Haha I agree dude. I personally am a way bigger marvel fan but I'm positive that if DC did do Braniac which they probably will. It'll be way better than Ultron.
DC_Cinematic,3bmxo2,xxbeast15,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:59:28 2015 UTC,It's a shame that some people now might view Brainiac has a ripoff of Ultron. Even though he was created way earlier.
DC_Cinematic,3bmxo2,Kongkiller,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:21:15 2015 UTC,I kinda feel like they might have changed Ultron's origin for the MCU just to screw up DC's attempts to bring in Brainiac.  In the comics Ultron had always been of purely terrestrial design.
DC_Cinematic,3bmxo2,Justice_Prince,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:08:47 2015 UTC,"Visually, Brainiac might be made of those same particles that the Kryptonian computers use, which would definitely be a completely different look from Ultron as well.  And how do you fight something that can break apart into particles and re-form itself? It was explored in the latest Transformers movie, but I'm sure Snyder can do one better."
DC_Cinematic,3bmxo2,IIIISuperDudeIIII,2,Tue Jun 30 20:45:54 2015 UTC,Almost certainly Doomsday.
DC_Cinematic,3bmxo2,YeezusUnchained,10,Tue Jun 30 15:08:39 2015 UTC,"I kinda hope it's not Doomsday. That seems like a pretty big villain and could take away the whole Batman vs. Superman thing. Like ""Oh, hey, we're buddies now because Doomsday"".   Also, he's a pretty big villain to spunk on the first ""big"" DCCU film..."
DC_Cinematic,3bmxo2,Justice_Prince,2,Tue Jun 30 15:28:06 2015 UTC,"Aw, yeah. Metallo would be awesome. A decent challenge for both Supes and Bats. I really like that idea."
DC_Cinematic,3bmxo2,doyleb3620,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:34:27 2015 UTC,"It seems likely that Wonder Woman will be joining in on the final fight too.  Metallo is a decent threat for the combined efforts of Batman, and Superman because he has kryptonite to weaken Superman, and his tech is likely equivalent to what Batman has.  Metallo has nothing on Wonder Woman though, and unless they're gonna seriously nerf her then she should be able to curbstomp him solo 10/10.  Maybe if they threw in some lexbots for backup, but I think people are growing tired of cannon fodder armies."
DC_Cinematic,3bmxo2,BatmanDavey1986,2,Tue Jun 30 15:36:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's that big of a villain. Sure, he ""killed"" Superman in the comics, but to the general audience, he's just a mindless death machine. With no real character development necessary, I think Doomsday would be perfect for Batman v. Superman."
DC_Cinematic,3bmxo2,YeezusUnchained,2,Tue Jun 30 20:13:35 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree with you 100%. Don't get the big whoop about it being Doomsday. He'd be cool visually. And he's a bad enough threat for the Trinity to take on at the end.
DC_Cinematic,3bmxo2,Justice_Prince,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:12:27 2015 UTC,I agree. But it's probably going to be Doomsday.
DC_Cinematic,3bmxo2,BardicFire,2,Wed Jul 1 13:55:07 2015 UTC,"I think saying ""putting mankind in greater danger then it's ever known before"" is just hyperbole.  I think it will be a single being which while stronger then Zod, or Superman it doesn't really compaire to an entire Kryptonian army armed with a machine that will kill all human life.  As for who the threat is I think it will be Bizarro with maybe a bit of Doomsday flavoring thrown in.  Have him grow about twice the size of a normal human, and have some of those bone things poking out of his skin.  That probably happens to him after he has a reverse reaction to kryptonite.  Personality wise ditch the whole backwards taking goof ball, and just make him angry, and confused.  Basically the Hulk, but a Hulk that can fly, and breath fire."
DC_Cinematic,3bmxo2,S0ckHeaven,2,Tue Jun 30 21:51:11 2015 UTC,I personally think it's Aquaman and they are gonna go Throne of Atlantis.
DC_Cinematic,3bmxo2,Justice_Prince,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:25:22 2015 UTC,"At this point I'm convinced it is going to be a Doomsday type threat.

Affleck isn't old looking so I don't really see the problem. He could pull off anything between 30 and 50 and we have no idea how old Batman will be in-universe so there's really nothing to worry about.

The comics have decades worth of stories where Batman is established and we'll never see any of that if everytime we need to start with him at the beginning of his career.  Having him be 40-50 means that Dick Grayson has already been Robin, that Joker has pushed him time and time again, that he's become a seasoned veteran by the time he meets Superman. It makes the stories more interesting.  If WB wants to make 20 years of DCCU films, they can keep doing that. But instead of waiting to see Dick Grayson in Batman 3, we see Damian Wayne and if Affleck gets too old, he can start Batman Inc. or have a Batman Beyond style successor."

DC_Cinematic,3bjm7x,TripleSkeet,6,Tue Jun 30 06:18:18 2015 UTC,"Both Begins and Dark Knight were great Batman movies that were ""made up."" Original ideas in storytelling are much more interesting to me. Sure there should be a solid villain in it, it just seems story-wise that Court of Owls and Red Hood have been played out, and nothing too original could come from adapting them to the big screen. The Arkham games have been great with coming up with new stories steeped in the lore of Batman, for example. I'm just not up for page-to-screen adaptions (except when the arc is all of the story like Watchmen and V for Vendetta; then it's essential)."
DC_Cinematic,3bjm7x,august_west_,4,Tue Jun 30 06:35:24 2015 UTC,"Well Batman Begins, and Dark Knight still pulled influence from various story arcs in the comics.  The difference is that Ra's, and the Joker have lots of different stories to pull from to patch together something unique.  Red Hood, or Court of Owls are a bit different since there is really only one definitive arc for each of them but there are still ways to reshape them into unique original stories.  I've been arguing for Red Hood for a while, and I don't think it has to be that much like the comics.  They could switch around a few of the supporting villains, but the biggest change they could make if having Jason's return coinciding with Tim Drake being brought in as the new Robin.  In addition to the motivations he had in the comics he'll also want to save this new kid from getting sucked into the life of a vigilante."
DC_Cinematic,3bjm7x,Justice_Prince,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:00:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, your first paragraph is really my point. Pulling influences is great, and should definitely be done. It just seems like with court of owls and Red Hood in particular that a whole new story with them couldn't necessarily happen without being too similar to comic arcs and not giving us anything new. With batfleck's solo, perhaps a story focusing on old Red Hood's transformation into Jared's joker with flashbacks, as well as an Under the Red Hood style Jason appearance could make for a good movie with the main theme being Batman's actions bringing about negative repurcussions? That would be a good way to bring in Tim like you said and still keep things fresh."

Smaller than a big Arkham breakout and a more focused narrative.   I really just want a great Riddler. He's one of my favorite comic book characters ever. Easily in my top 3."

As you've pointed out, his sense of fashion(galmorous white and purple suits) seems borrowed from TDKR, and his tattoos while not taken directly from it do seem inspired by All-Star.

I'm really liking his persona from what I've seen, apart from the tattoo (which I feel detracts from the kind of image they're going for, if I understand it). But having Bud and Lou would really help it out.  For reference, what I think they're going for is an egotistical, insane mobster who is obsessed with flashy things and what he finds funny. A true ""Clown Prince of Crime"" for the modern era. I feel the pet hyenas would play up the eccentricities that would be characteristic of a rich mobster (rich people are often portrayed as having exotic animals, like Mike Tyson in Hangover, or that guy with the mini giraffe in that commercial), as well as tying this incarnation of the Joker back to earlier source materials.  What I don't like about the ""damaged"" tattoo (I'm fine with most of the other tattoos, for the most part) is that it doesn't seem like something an egotistical, rich, insane career criminal would have. It seems more suited for a character who is portrayed as more ""emo."" It seems to clash with that sort of ""classy gangsta"" sort of feel that I'm getting from everything else.

Bruce is working in the Batcave when Alfred informs him that one of their satellite's have gone offline by two Kryptonians   I sadly have no idea for WW's perspective"
DC_Cinematic,3bfrd1,heybuddyitsme,9,Sun Jun 28 21:16:58 2015 UTC,"I have a idea for WW, maybe one of the world engines sends a ripple of sorts and knocks a fight pilot out of the sky and lands on themyscira."
DC_Cinematic,3bfrd1,Justice_Prince,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:26:34 2015 UTC,"I think the ripple might disable the the device, or charm that was keeping Themyscira invisible, or out of phase."
DC_Cinematic,3bfrd1,MixMasterBone,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:09:15 2015 UTC,I believe that Bruce is in Metropolis as it's happening. There were set photos of Ben at a Wayne Financial building in Metropolis and it started falling apart.

Very cynical, yet human reactions to Superman."
DC_Cinematic,3bfrd1,HarishChengaiah,3,Mon Jun 29 00:13:35 2015 UTC,It's going to be a Watchmen type opening credits sequence.
DC_Cinematic,3bfrd1,TheJoshider10,5,Mon Jun 29 10:56:42 2015 UTC,"Starts off black and we just hear various news reports on the battle in Metropolis. Opening shot of the battle from behind Bruce in the Batcave watching all the reports on the screens. The screens are all running the same footage simultaneously and he pauses them when they focus on Superman. Close up of Bruce's eyes, still not showing his face.  We then focus on Alfred who Bruce calls out, telling him to arrange a flight to Metropolis. Alfred is reading a newspaper where the cover says THE BATTLE 2 YEARS ON - HOW LEX SAVED METROPOLIS with a picture of him behind a building under construction. Alfred puts the paper down and we zoom in, seeing it was written by Clark Kent.   The paper zooms out and we're now in Clark's apartment, who's talking about Lex with Lois (they now live together) and through some hopefully subtle dialogue we discover Clark wrote the article because he used it to get information on Lex, Lexcorp and the going ons of the company as he believed something was up. Lois tells him not to worry, as Clark is disheartened by talk on TV of Superman being the reason for the deaths of thousands, and if possible this would be on Fox News. Clark replied with a half hearted ""yeah, the world sure loves Superman"" and looks out the window, where we see the Superman statue/Metropolis memorial. We then cut to the chest where it says FALSE GOD.   Queue theme and hype hype hype, the symbol on the statue moves to the front of the screen and we get to Superman logo, with the Batman one coming behind it.   It reads Batman v Superman, theme then goes quieter.  As Dawn of Justice appears in place of BvS, a bong like the one from the trailer is heard, because it fits and highlights the dawn, that something is coming soon."

While he is stating this we see the camera slowly approach the back of lex luthor as he watches the destruction of Metropolis with clenched fists. And then as soon as he says cruel we see the front of his face as he slowly lifts his face and we see the hatred and jealousy in his eyes, and then see him VERY briefly rage. BLACKNESS."

DC_Cinematic,3bfrd1,S0ckHeaven,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:39:31 2015 UTC,I feel like a great way to handle that scene would to be Clark attempting to discover Bats identity and eventually stumble upon the news report. While Clark reads it we see brief flashbacks of the murder. At the end we cut to a shot of Bruce waking up in shock. It would be a good way to push the narrative forward while focusing on Batman's origins. This would be after a first meeting where Batman orchestrates a disaster scenario (with nobody in danger mind you) in order to test Superman's abilities.
DC_Cinematic,3bfrd1,jacobtie,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:39:38 2015 UTC,A Luthor scene.
DC_Cinematic,3bfrd1,ManofBatz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:27:54 2015 UTC,It would be pretty cool to open with the Wayne murder and the destruction of Krypton spliced together.

DC_Cinematic,3bfvqx,BattleReadyPenguin,2,Sun Jun 28 21:56:32 2015 UTC,They have a Shazam and Enchantress. They could totally do it.

DC_Cinematic,3bfvqx,Justice_Prince,2,Mon Jun 29 13:01:49 2015 UTC,My speculation is I do not think so. I think it will stand totally apart from the DCCU and and potential Dark Justice projects.
DC_Cinematic,3bf074,TronVin,12,Sun Jun 28 17:02:34 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't want them to waste such a talent on a smaller role, I like him more as Hal."
DC_Cinematic,3bf074,misterapplebasket,10,Sun Jun 28 17:28:25 2015 UTC,Steve Trevor isn't a small role anymore. He's almost the equivalent of a Nick Fury these days.
DC_Cinematic,3bf074,misterapplebasket,4,Sun Jun 28 17:45:39 2015 UTC,I know and I love the character especially in the new 52 run but I expect Hal to have bigger spotlight in the movies and he'll be obviously in the future GL movies. And Chris Pine is such a charismatic actor I can't not see him as Hal.
DC_Cinematic,3bf074,misterapplebasket,2,Sun Jun 28 17:59:22 2015 UTC,There are two hinges: typecasting and the fact Pine said he wouldn't play a superhero.
DC_Cinematic,3bf074,IIIISuperDudeIIII,2,Sun Jun 28 18:39:04 2015 UTC,When did he say that?
DC_Cinematic,3bf074,misterapplebasket,3,Sun Jun 28 18:47:54 2015 UTC,It's not this video but it's in the video.   http://youtu.be/1bDwLYkLGJo  He just doesn't seem keen on the idea of wearing a superhero costume.   Who knows though maybe he changed his mind.
DC_Cinematic,3bf074,thelastbrew,3,Sun Jun 28 19:02:56 2015 UTC,Everyone has a price.
DC_Cinematic,3bf074,william2181,2,Sun Jun 28 23:59:19 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. Jesse Eisenberg also stated that he never was a fan of comic books but he's playing Lex Luthor, so yeah who knows?"
DC_Cinematic,3bf074,smbrynien,3,Sun Jun 28 19:32:03 2015 UTC,"I agree whole-heartedly that WB would benefit from having a big name draw like Chris Pine in Wonder Woman, for, insurance purposes as you've described. If Chris Pine does end up playing GL, and not Trevor, then I'd have to assume that WB/DC has a lot of faith in Gal.  However, I don't agree on your opinion about GL. The last GL film failed miserably, among both critics and viewers. I think the next GL should be both a big name actor, yet also very talented and fitting. And this is why I think Chris Pine should take GL over Trevor, because WB/DC needs to utilize him as best they can."
DC_Cinematic,3bf074,Fricktator,3,Sun Jun 28 19:42:04 2015 UTC,hal

DC_Cinematic,3bf074,dharp95,3,Sun Jun 28 20:02:36 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't mind either, but would prefer Trevor. Mainly for the reasons you listed.  Also, there are other actors I would prefer as Hal. Mainly McConaughey."

DC_Cinematic,3bf074,suss2it,2,Sun Jun 28 19:49:35 2015 UTC,"Steve, probably. Mainly because there is so much Hal out there. I would really like Steve to get some more development. His character would also tie a lot of the universe together. Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, ARGUS, Suicide Squad, all of it would fit together really nicely.  Also, I would really like to see Reynolds as Hal in the DCCU, though that probably won't happen again. I feel he could really nail the role if given good writing. Nathan Fillion would be another obvious choice, since he could obviously do it."
DC_Cinematic,3bf074,SengalBoy,2,Sun Jun 28 20:04:00 2015 UTC,They're probably banking on Gal having the star power to carry her solo movie by the time of release. We still have BvS to go.
DC_Cinematic,3bf074,dc_fanboyforever,2,Sun Jun 28 20:06:06 2015 UTC,He could go the Nathan Fillion route and play them both.

DC_Cinematic,3bf074,letsgetweirdkbye,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:11:46 2015 UTC,"Steve Trevor, as the movie would benefit from a star presence and it would save Steve being some random guy with no charisma who just has sex with WW."
DC_Cinematic,3bf074,RomyReptile,3,Sun Jun 28 20:41:34 2015 UTC,I don't see that happening anyways.
DC_Cinematic,3bf074,letsgetweirdkbye,-5,Mon Jun 29 02:25:00 2015 UTC,When variety announced he was Steve Trevor I thought that was awesome casting so I'm hoping that's what ends up happening. I would fucking love to see Bradley Cooper and Nate Parker walk out at SDCC as the new Green Lanterns but apparently you need to be a rapper/singer to be a black actor in the DCCU.
DC_Cinematic,3bf074,RomyReptile,6,Sun Jun 28 17:40:32 2015 UTC,Cyborg actor isn't a rapper or singer. He is a theatre actor. Neither is Perry White aka Morpheus.

DC_Cinematic,3bf074,M4gikarp,2,Sun Jun 28 21:49:08 2015 UTC,Bradley Cooper   I would think he would have an exclusivity deal with Marvel
DC_Cinematic,3bf074,TheOneWhoKnocksBitch,5,Sun Jun 28 18:14:37 2015 UTC,Nope. He has a 4 picture deal with WB. He can choose any role he wants while voicing that cgi raccoon.
DC_Cinematic,3bf074,letsgetweirdkbye,3,Sun Jun 28 18:21:15 2015 UTC,"Huh, didn't know that"
DC_Cinematic,3bi5tm,Zeno84,5,Mon Jun 29 12:35:26 2015 UTC,It is funny how one bad movie can make people averse to the concept of GL. I think GL and emotional spectrum is the most unique thing in all mainstream Comics. The kind of sophisticated and visual stories which can be told in GL can't ever be told using any other comicbook property.
DC_Cinematic,3bi5tm,dc_fanboyforever,6,Mon Jun 29 16:57:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah...this. Reynolds Green Lantern was a god-awful film, but ""mysticism"" and the ""unbelievable science"" scenes were not. In fact, I think they might have been the best thing about it."
DC_Cinematic,3bi5tm,thelastbrew,3,Tue Jun 30 01:12:03 2015 UTC,Do you find the science behind Superman and Flash believable? Are Aquaman and Wonder Woman less mystical?
DC_Cinematic,3bi5tm,S0ckHeaven,-2,Mon Jun 29 15:17:51 2015 UTC,"Well, we have yet to see how they'll handle three out of four of those characters.  And we haven't really gotten too much of an explanation on how exactly Superman works. But we're certainly not attributing his strength/invulnerability to his willpower."
DC_Cinematic,3bi5tm,S0ckHeaven,2,Mon Jun 29 15:20:47 2015 UTC,"But you would like them to handle Wonder Woman and Aquaman in non mystical ways as well? As well as Enchantress, El Diablo, etc?"
DC_Cinematic,3bi5tm,S0ckHeaven,-2,Mon Jun 29 15:23:20 2015 UTC,I guess it really depends...
DC_Cinematic,3bi5tm,S0ckHeaven,2,Mon Jun 29 15:24:47 2015 UTC,"Just pointing out that the mystical and fantastical lines seem to be already drawn pretty far out. If you are going to have a race of people magically living under water, race of women with mythical abilities, characters with magic showing up here and there anyways... A cosmic ring powered by will power seems like an arbitrary spot to say , ""too much, not believable any more"""
DC_Cinematic,3bi5tm,S0ckHeaven,-3,Mon Jun 29 15:39:01 2015 UTC,"I think that depends on the rules set up by universe. I mean, you can inject mythology and add that ruleset, and stay within that framework.  But it's another thing altogether to just add another set of really strange and arbitrary rules to the universe with the Green Lanterns.  It's not so much about line drawing as it is about making all these different, and highly unusual, pieces fit together."
DC_Cinematic,3bi5tm,DerringerHK,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:42:49 2015 UTC,So you are more getting at compatability than believability really.
DC_Cinematic,3bi5tm,BatmanDavey1986,-4,Mon Jun 29 15:46:16 2015 UTC,"Sort of.  I mean, look at this way: you have this suspension of disbelief stack, you keep adding to with different sized pieces, some small, some big.  I happen to think that the Green Lanterns would be a very large piece.  And it's part of the reason the first movie was so damn awful. I mean, I don't know how one can watch a scene from that movie and  not think ""This is the dumbest fucking shit I've ever seen in my entire life."""
DC_Cinematic,3bi5tm,BatmanDavey1986,4,Mon Jun 29 15:50:19 2015 UTC,"That movie suffered from bad movie making, not GL lore."
DC_Cinematic,3bi5tm,KomodoEmiko,2,Mon Jun 29 16:00:37 2015 UTC,"I kind of agree with /u/KomodoEmiko. It would be pretty neat to just have them as an intergalactic police force, however I don't think there's any real reason to change the lore. Hell, they're probably going to include Themiscyria, so why not the Guardians etc? It's just as outlandish."

I mean, The people who set up the Corps can go out of their way to search for particularly qualified individuals (willful, if you will) to fill their Corps.  But I think they should leave out the part where a person's will powers his ring abilities. It's silly, even by superhero standards."
DC_Cinematic,3bi5tm,IIIISuperDudeIIII,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:27:44 2015 UTC,"Well no offense, but I sure hope no one on the DC film team shares that opinion."

DC_Cinematic,3bi5tm,KomodoEmiko,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:10:27 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from, but I don't feel there really is a necessity to alter the lore to make the story more accessible, just leave out what you don't need, if it's that big of a deal..  Besides, if they can make a film that has Amazons, Atlanteans, Aliens and orphans coexist then I'm sure they'll figure it out."
DC_Cinematic,3bi5tm,KomodoEmiko,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:07:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know how they're going to pull off those orphans though, man.

DC_Cinematic,3bbmd6,TronVin,6,Sat Jun 27 20:28:46 2015 UTC,Maybe we'll get to see that sizzle reel from that European cinema event.
DC_Cinematic,3bbmd6,rustedmachines,10,Sat Jun 27 19:52:15 2015 UTC,"I think we'll get something even better than whatever they showed there.  Snyder/WB has always premiered amazing footage and announcements at Comic Con. Watchmen, Man of Steel, the two BvS years have all been incredible."
DC_Cinematic,3bbmd6,whatudontlikefalafel,13,Sat Jun 27 20:22:12 2015 UTC,I hope most of that hour and a half is given to DC.

DC_Cinematic,3ba2kd,lampy8,17,Sat Jun 27 05:46:50 2015 UTC,Hopefully Man of Steel 2 and Batfleck movie gets added to the slate. I'm also expecting a Batman v Superman trailer so please don't disappoint WB. I'm not expecting Flash or Cyborg costume reveal but won't complain if they do.
DC_Cinematic,3ba2kd,invisiblack,6,Sat Jun 27 06:08:27 2015 UTC,"I really hope for a Cyborg reveal. Have a feeling he's going to become borg in BvS as a product of Zod destruction, or whatever physical threat Bats and Supes team up to fight in the end. Bringing out the whole 7 JL members would be hype-fucking-city too."
DC_Cinematic,3ba2kd,august_west_,3,Sat Jun 27 06:15:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly I expect them to bring the seven characters and reveal their costumes next year at SDCC to market  Justice League part 1, though I'll be extremely happy if I'm wrong about this."
DC_Cinematic,3ba2kd,invisiblack,4,Sat Jun 27 06:22:47 2015 UTC,"It would definitely make more sense as a concentrated marketing effort to put out suits and promotional photos/materials then. I just want to know who the hell Chris Pine is playing (if anyone at all).  Seems like a SS scene could be whipped up akin to last year's BvS clip, with the heavy hitters from SS appearing as well as the BvS cast. I'm excited."
DC_Cinematic,3ba2kd,august_west_,11,Sat Jun 27 06:29:48 2015 UTC,"Easy answer: -Batman v Superman -Suicide Squad  -probably something similar to what they did when they announced Batman v Superman but this time concerning The Justice League. -maybe the cast of BvS or task force x.  What I'm hoping.. an image of Ezra Miller as the Flash, I'm so freakin' interested in how that costume will be done, I love all the costumes in these so far. Yes, even Joker."
DC_Cinematic,3ba2kd,KomodoEmiko,16,Sat Jun 27 06:54:17 2015 UTC,"Here's my take on what's going to happen.   The DCCU session opens with Zack Snyder introducing the BvS teaser trailer 2 followed by the full cast reveal. Comic-Con eyes only clip and villain reveal. Replay of teaser trailer 2. Snyder then welcomes David Ayer to the stage.  David Ayer thanks everyone, and welcomes the entire SS cast to the stage. Leto is in full Joker mode. First teaser trailer followed by a short panel discussion. A Comic-con eyes only clip. Teaser played again.  WB president + Geoff Johns come to the stage to reveal the final official DCCU Slate. (Updated from Press Released Version) They set up: Batman Solo film official announcement teaser and logo reveal.  The DCCU session ends with a wait there's more moment: Zack Snyder comes back to the stage as welcomes the 7 members of the JL.  The 7 cast members unite on stage for the first time. JL Concept art reveal.  JL Part 1 Official Logo + teaser. Hall H explodes."
DC_Cinematic,3ba2kd,szadkowski,4,Sat Jun 27 10:35:33 2015 UTC,A SS teaser 13 months out would be surprising but awesome!

DC_Cinematic,3ba2kd,S0ckHeaven,5,Sat Jun 27 06:58:21 2015 UTC,Prob Lex.
DC_Cinematic,3ba2kd,DerringerHK,5,Sat Jun 27 13:15:17 2015 UTC,"We know Lex is playing a major role, but it seems like there will likely be someone else in the final battle."

DC_Cinematic,3b9tmo,DerringerHK,2,Sat Jun 27 12:57:19 2015 UTC,Tagged. No escaping.
DC_Cinematic,3b9tmo,TheAndrewSpence,11,Sat Jun 27 14:26:41 2015 UTC,"He's perfectly serviceable here, but the role isn't asking that much of him in the first place. When he's yelling and acting tough in Transformers and Fast/Furious he's fine.  But I've never seen him successfully give a nuanced performance. I saw his audition for Django Unchained, and I felt pretty bad for him. I doubt Green Lantern will demand an Oscar-worthy performance, but Imd like to see WB hire the best talent possible.  Man of Steel has Amy Adams, Lawrence Fishburne, Russell Crowe, etc. and with BvS they've added Ben Affleck, Jesse Eisenberg and Scoot McNairy... We also have Ezra Miller as The Flash and Ray Fisher as Cyborg.  I don't know if Gibson can be on that level. At the same time, the actors playing Aquaman and Wonder Woman are more well known for their looks than their acting ability and I'm more willing to give them a chance. I guess I judge Gibson more harshly because I've seen more of his work than those two."
DC_Cinematic,3b9tmo,whatudontlikefalafel,4,Sat Jun 27 05:03:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed. WB's going on about how they're making ""great movies about superheroes not necessarily superhero movies."" They're trying to follow a Nolan-esque approach and I'm not sure Gibson is more than an big-budget action star. Also he's gonna look like such a tool if he isn't announced as John Stewart at comic con especially after saying, “I might be there on the other side of an announcement. You never know.”"

DC_Cinematic,3bcvx4,Huntersteve,3,Sun Jun 28 02:48:59 2015 UTC,Yes he did. He was rumored to be auditioning for an unknown role (that was speculated to be Nightwing) back in November 2013.

DC_Cinematic,3bcvx4,rustedmachines,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:26:32 2015 UTC,"If their take on The Flash is younger, then yeah they cast the actor for the character. Just like with Batman, Affleck would normally be a bit old for the character, but this film's version is older.  Nobody can deny that Miller is younger than the rest of The League. That's a fact. And he's also the only Silver Age hero announced, so perhaps DC is distinguishing between superhero generations by having an age gap."
DC_Cinematic,3bcvx4,rustedmachines,3,Sun Jun 28 08:59:22 2015 UTC,"""Upcommuning,"" huh? Can we just ban moviepilot.com? I'm sure I've read some of their other articles that were posted here but generally I just skim them and I can't recall them being this bad. It's littered with spelling and grammar mistakes.Perhaps the author should get a grade school student to proofread.  This part made me cringe.   I am certain that Ezra Miller's Flash will be something of a young, punkish misfit ripe with rebellion as he uses his super speed more as a tool against injustices than for justice and he'll be a bit of a badass in this way. Possibly a college student frustrated with typicality, he may irresponsibly use his powers as an F-U to the system. This persona will possibly leave him looking like an A-hole much of the time but hey, he doesn't care. He'll likely personify today's fast paced ""gotta have it now."" generation as the more mature members of the justice league try to keep up with him."
DC_Cinematic,3bcvx4,whatudontlikefalafel,-5,Sun Jun 28 02:03:39 2015 UTC,"Well fuck what the article is trying to say, you see a spelling error and just decide to immediately bash everything. Anonymous grammar nazing on the internet must be a fulfilling hobby of yours yea?"
DC_Cinematic,3bcvx4,BatmanDavey1986,6,Sun Jun 28 02:49:25 2015 UTC,"Anonymous grammar nazing on the internet must be a fulfilling hobby of your yea?   Yeah, and so is a basic grasp of the English language.   Well fuck what the article is trying to say, you see a spelling error and just decide to immediately bash everything.   The spelling errors are just icing on the cake. The article informs readers of almost nothing. The title alone screams ""give me views."" I'm sorry if you're taking this personally (it seems that way to me, at least) but it is poorly written and it is highly speculative. The tone of the article reflects an assurance on the author's part that he is absolutely correct and his evidence does not back it up and it's that tone that I have have an issue with. He uses Miller's past acting stints as a way to gauge what his character might be like -- fair enough, I suppose, but it ignores the 7 decades of the character's history. I don't know a whole lot about the Flash outside of the various television renditions of the character but everything I know goes against Flash having an ""F-U"" attitude."
DC_Cinematic,3bcvx4,dc_fanboyforever,-4,Sun Jun 28 03:04:37 2015 UTC,"Though you are clearly falsely speaking as though the article is just barely readable, i guess i can respect your critiques on the article's general tone. As far as the Flash's history, the article was more so aimed at more informed readers.  And for the record, yes i am the author and yes, i am a student but i really didn't appreciate your response. I got an ideal for an article and wrote it out to the internet, it wasn't a paper, i wasn't being graded, i just wanted to share some ideals.  That being said, im actually glad you said what you said, i guess i do have to finesse my internet writing more.  Thanks"
DC_Cinematic,3bcvx4,Techno_Bacon,7,Sun Jun 28 03:23:30 2015 UTC,"May I offer some advice?  Learn to take criticism. If you're going to share your writings on a public forum, you should be prepared to have strangers respond to it honestly. It's the internet.  I think the points you made in your article are pretty interesting, but it's not hard to hold the shift key down when you type ""I"", or to take a quick scan before submitting anything you write to make sure you haven't left behind any obvious typos.   People on the internet who point out flaws will never go away. It's easier to write without flaw than to expect no one to ever criticize you. If someone points out a mistake, thank them and amend it rather than give excuses, you'll sleep better."

While the look he's going to have was not what I was expecting it fits perfectly in the universe and they seem to have already planned out his story.   I also think Momoa will surprise people who are expecting him to play Aquaman a certain way (Khal Drogo as Aquaman) and make the character a perfect balance between brooding and comedic.   Edit: Ray Fisher seems pretty cool (on instagram and Twitter) but never seen him act, I did search around the internet when the WB/DC slate was released."

DC_Cinematic,3b6p6p,Justice_Prince,12,Fri Jun 26 15:41:38 2015 UTC,"I know this is probably the most controversial of the castings, but I'm most excited about Gal Gadot.  Maybe I'm in the minority but I think she has the perfect look for the role, and even though she has less acting experience then the rest I think she has this natural presence that's going to lend itself perfectly to playing Wonder Woman.  Besides casting there are a few other things that have me worried about how they'll handle Wonder Woman though."
DC_Cinematic,3b6p6p,Citizen_of_Atlantis,8,Fri Jun 26 15:29:34 2015 UTC,I became a lot less worried about her once I heard she was acting alongside Affleck in her audition. Gave me a lot of hope.

DC_Cinematic,3b820b,ferncaz95,4,Fri Jun 26 19:19:28 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I'm a big comic book nerd, I've read TDKR. I just didn't know they were adapting that aspect of the story."
DC_Cinematic,3b820b,S0ckHeaven,-4,Fri Jun 26 19:23:14 2015 UTC,The DCCU we are getting is a mish-mash of different versions of the heroes so we have a Earth one based Superman and Dark Knight Returns Batman and nineties based Aquaman. So presume they will use there backstories from those eras into the DCCU.
DC_Cinematic,3b820b,S0ckHeaven,3,Fri Jun 26 19:27:28 2015 UTC,It would have to be presumption. We can't say based on one picture that this Aquaman is 90s version.
DC_Cinematic,3b820b,Techno_Bacon,-3,Fri Jun 26 19:53:33 2015 UTC,Jason took a picture of him holding a comic of aquaman that was from the nineties and Jason looks amazingly like the nineties aquaman minis the hook hand
DC_Cinematic,3b820b,S0ckHeaven,6,Fri Jun 26 20:01:25 2015 UTC,The hook and story line being a major aspect of that version.
DC_Cinematic,3b820b,thelastbrew,3,Fri Jun 26 21:17:03 2015 UTC,"I doubt that.   One of the comments about the movie said that Batman is still considered an Urban Myth, if I recall correctly."
DC_Cinematic,3b820b,whatudontlikefalafel,5,Sat Jun 27 02:00:09 2015 UTC,"He may be retired but that is just speculation. This movie is not a Frank Miller adaptation, it does draw some inspiration from it and this could be one point of induration, but we don't know yet. Snyder has been clear this is not an adaptation."
DC_Cinematic,3b820b,matito29,0,Fri Jun 26 19:51:44 2015 UTC,Although nothing about Gotham is confirmed I am just basing it on what I want to see and what we know of batman in this universe.
DC_Cinematic,3b820b,letsgetweirdkbye,2,Fri Jun 26 20:03:17 2015 UTC,"As the title states, the film should revolve heavily around both Batman  and Superman. I fully expect 2 trailers, one from Batman's perspective and one from Superman's as well. Because Batman is WB/DC's cash cow, theres no doubt in my mind that Batman will get a heavy amount of the marketing focus for the film.   With that being said, I'd love to hear an anecdote from the Batman himself in a future trailer. Whether or not it focuses on him coming out of retirement depends entirely on the plot of the film, which we can only speculate towards based on rumors."

He simply was not known for much more than brokeback and 10 things and he stilled killed it in those movies, anyway. His reaction was ridiculous from the beginning."
DC_Cinematic,3b61xq,wellbluebanana,-1,Sat Jun 27 00:59:15 2015 UTC,"Yes and Heath was a good Joker but I can not see Gibson as Stewart, he looks nothing and sounds nothing Like John Stewart, John is a big bulky military dude turned GL his voice is portrayed as deep and burly none of those things match Gibson and I cannot see Gibson as a serious military dude I would much prefer someone like Idris Elba."

DC_Cinematic,3b61xq,BattleReadyPenguin,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:26:30 2015 UTC,"I feel like you can't base your judgement solely on looks though, I mean did Heath Ledger really look like Joker?"
DC_Cinematic,3b61xq,smbrynien,2,Fri Jun 26 20:34:21 2015 UTC,"Heath looked like Nolans vision of the joker how he wanted him to look, in this case warner bros want him to look as comic book accurate as possible."
DC_Cinematic,3b61xq,BattleReadyPenguin,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:25:44 2015 UTC,And Tyrese will look like Zack Snyder's John Stewart. Tbh I don't really want him as GL but the point you mentioned is pretty baseless. WB has never stated that they wanted GL to look as comic accurate as possible.
DC_Cinematic,3b61xq,invisiblack,4,Sat Jun 27 10:43:26 2015 UTC,I know some won't like it but I'm all for fanboys in the role.

DC_Cinematic,3b61xq,KomodoEmiko,8,Fri Jun 26 11:05:21 2015 UTC,Chris Pine and Tyrese as Hal and John? I can dig it.

But there won't be any real winner as in no one killed or crippled or anything. I think Batman will hold his own as best as can be expected and empty his ingenious assortment of weapons, armor, intimidation, etc.  Basically I think Batman won't be embarrassed, but it will reach a point Superman could kill Batman, and he of course won't."

Michaels in particular wanted $375 for both, and that was with the 60% off custom framing.At Michaels, I ended up finding,and buying two 14x20 black [matte] metal float frames (double panel glass,and picture goes between),for $20 each. This one. I don't know where you are, but If you are in Canada like I am, than they are available here too.  Here is what they look like.I think they look quite sexy. I threw my measurements away but the actual size of the IMAX posters should be closer to 13 13/16 x 1915/16 . You can't tell from the photo I posted, but the sides of posters are just a wee off.You can only really tell if there is light coming from behind the picture frame and/or your wall is some-what bright coloured.Even though it is a 16th off, and the way the frame is made, the top and bottom of the posters are edging the frame."

DC_Cinematic,3azjua,Gerry-Mandarin,15,Wed Jun 24 19:36:28 2015 UTC,"I think the Winter Soldier was a really good way of having multiple characters while still being a Cap movie.  As an example:  Solo Batman: Green Arrow & Black Canary, Nightwing, Catwoman, Batgirl.  Not necessarily all of them, but they would all work well within a Batman movie.  I would keep the Batman movies more grounded. Less city wide destruction and more detective/thriller.  Solo Superman: Would be easier to work with more powerful characters. GL, Shazam, Hawkman, Martian Manhunter. Off-planet stuff would work as you could more easily show the power of stronger characters without having the typical global catastrophe.    I think a Blue Beetle and Booster Gold buddy flick would work. Give it the same feel as the Guardians of the Galaxy."

There is a coding issue with the flair text and our flair crafter (the honorable /u/iliekpixels) is moderator of several subs and also makes flair for (I believe) 4 other subs than ours.  That said, we are looking to bring more and more flairs to better encapsulate the ever-growing expanse of characters in the DCCU. Suicide Squad, for instance, is our next priority.   As for the other members of the League, it was decided early on that since many of these characters have radical changes in how they look from the comics (Aquaman and Joker to name only two), we would wait until they were officially introduced to us before making representations of them on the sub.  Not only does this lessen the workload for /u/iliekpixels, it also emphasizes that we are a DC_Cinematic sub, and not just a DC Comics sub."

DC_Cinematic,3aw7d1,ultrasargent,6,Wed Jun 24 00:27:34 2015 UTC,I am more than okay with this.
DC_Cinematic,3aw7d1,LordCommanderStark,3,Wed Jun 24 00:33:20 2015 UTC,This is what I wanted this movie to be ever since it was announced with the rest of the movie slate.
DC_Cinematic,3aw7d1,invisiblack,3,Wed Jun 24 00:42:42 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping they're right about the way Part 1 and 2 of the Justice League go down. A terrestrial threat for One, aliens for 2."
DC_Cinematic,3aw7d1,mental_reincarnation,2,Wed Jun 24 01:07:29 2015 UTC,"Sounds like that part was just sighting an old rumor.  I'm betting it will either be Starro, or Brainiac in the first film, but it won't be an invasion from outer space.  Either Brainiac coming from Lex screwing with Kryptonian tech, or Starro coming from the ocean.  If Part 2 isn't a continuation of the same villain then I think it will be about Legion of Doom."
DC_Cinematic,3aw7d1,Justice_Prince,3,Wed Jun 24 02:48:28 2015 UTC,"I've been saying this since they announced a GL 2020 release: make it a team-focused film. An ensemble will be fun, fresh, and a interesting take for the Corp."

DC_Cinematic,3aw7d1,TheMurderCapitalist,2,Wed Jun 24 03:22:54 2015 UTC,I'm so hard right now.
DC_Cinematic,3aw28n,DerringerHK,5,Tue Jun 23 23:31:19 2015 UTC,"The first teaser showed superman as the threat and batman as the hero. It will be amazing if they have two marketing campaigns with one campaign portraying batman as the villain and the other portraying superman as the villain so we really do not know who to root for in the movie, it will also be different campaign from the civil war movie with them wanting you to pick a side."
DC_Cinematic,3aw28n,BattleReadyPenguin,3,Wed Jun 24 04:53:55 2015 UTC,"it seemed to place Superman in a very negative light. He is portrayed cleverly as a dictator/false god/villain while Batman is shown to be seeking justice   I got the complete opposite impression.  Looking at Superman's face, he seems pretty uncomfortable with the way people act around him. All these voices on TV speak about him as a threat, but one of those voices is Lex Luthor. The message I got wasn't that Superman was a villain, it was that people in the film see him as a villain.  And with Alfred's monologue about good men becoming cruel because of fear, and the shot of Affleck with that thousand yard stare, I felt more like they were showing Batman as someone who went kinda crazy. There's a shot of him with what looks like a sniper rifle."
DC_Cinematic,3aw28n,whatudontlikefalafel,3,Wed Jun 24 13:48:58 2015 UTC,Yeah I got the same thing.  Superman is just trying to do the right thing.  It almost seems like Batman is going to confront him more out of jealousy then a wish to protect people.
DC_Cinematic,3aw28n,Justice_Prince,3,Wed Jun 24 18:23:54 2015 UTC,"I don't see it so much as jealousy as him being afraid of how much power he has. Spending years as Batman he's probably seen a lot of people with great potential become corrupted, but what's kept him feeling somewhat secure is his belief that at least he's the smartest and the strongest of them all... Until now."
DC_Cinematic,3aw28n,whatudontlikefalafel,2,Wed Jun 24 19:50:34 2015 UTC,"Very interesting. It's cool when something like this can evoke such different impressions.  What I will say is that I feel like Supes is being seen as a controversial character, if anything - with some worshipping him and other denouncing him as a ""devil"". That 1000-yard stare Batfleck gives seems to me to be the perfect representation of the anger he has bottled up after Superman's actions hurt so many in MoS. He's Gotham's ""Dark Avenger"", and I felt that really came across.  Oh, and that sniper rifle actually fires grappling hooks. It's lifted straight out of The Dark Knight Returns.  I really find it fascinating though how two people can watch a trailer and come away with such different thoughts. Kinda cool."
DC_Cinematic,3aw28n,YungMarx,9,Wed Jun 24 14:04:23 2015 UTC,"This would be cool and a seriously smart way to add more discussion to the already-present hype behind the film. I just hope that the film doesn't end up being some sort of ""Bats and Supes drop their differences to fight a common evil"" like Civil War looks like it's turning out to be."
DC_Cinematic,3ax8to,BattleReadyPenguin,4,Wed Jun 24 06:04:55 2015 UTC,The threat is Lex.
DC_Cinematic,3ax8to,Jangwin,-5,Wed Jun 24 07:03:24 2015 UTC,I think Lex will manipulate Batman into taking down Superman telling Batman how he destroyed Metropolis do you wonder if he will ever do the same to Gotham?
DC_Cinematic,3ax8to,decrepidactyl,5,Wed Jun 24 07:10:32 2015 UTC,Superman is being blamed left and right for shit in Bats V Supes. I think the dude needs a break.
DC_Cinematic,3ax8to,dc_fanboyforever,2,Wed Jun 24 16:21:10 2015 UTC,"I hope by the end both he and bats work together to clear his name and people will back off , at least media should."
DC_Cinematic,3ax8to,dc_fanboyforever,6,Wed Jun 24 19:07:00 2015 UTC,Don't listen to rumours that is stupid
DC_Cinematic,3ax8to,dc_fanboyforever,-2,Wed Jun 24 06:17:19 2015 UTC,Why do you think it is stupid?
DC_Cinematic,3ax8to,Justice_Prince,-2,Wed Jun 24 06:20:56 2015 UTC,"Sea people attack in an Aquaman centric story and orm attacks not Arthur, Aquaman is torn between JL and Atlantis and there have been many stories like that, the recent and memorable one is called Throne of Atlantis. JL : Throne of Atlantis is a very loose adaptation of that comic arc.  I don't want to be rude but please read a f'ing comic book! If the producers do it with Aquaman as villain they are fucking stupid but Jason Mamoa already said his role is very small and it is primarily Supes and Bats story.  They guys who run these stupid rumours are c*nts."
DC_Cinematic,3ax8to,august_west_,3,Wed Jun 24 12:49:33 2015 UTC,"I agree that Atlantians attacking is an Aquaman centric story, and should only be done in either a Aquaman solo movie, or maybe in Justice League.  With this movie centering around a conflict between Batman and Superman it would be kinda random to throw Atlantians in at the end.  What ever the big threat is at the end I think it's going to be created by Lex.  Maybe Doomsday, Brainiac, or Metallo, but my bet is Bizarro."

DC_Cinematic,3atb9x,dc_fanboyforever,5,Tue Jun 23 09:57:16 2015 UTC,"Almost certainly not. You could maybe abridge Rebirth and Secret Origin into a Sinestro Corps War film, ending with little War of Light snippets. Excising all the lead up to Sinestro Corps War.  Rage of the Red Lanterns, and Agent Orange could maybe be abridged into a Blackest Night film.  But that would still leave Brightest Day, War of the Green Lanterns, Sinestro, Rise of the Third Army, Black Hand, and Wrath of the First Lantern."
DC_Cinematic,3atb9x,Gerry-Mandarin,2,Tue Jun 23 17:47:27 2015 UTC,Yeah it's too fucking big!
DC_Cinematic,3atb9x,Justice_Prince,3,Wed Jun 24 02:05:46 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they'll draw from his run to an extent, but I don't think they'll be doing a direct adaption of anything.    I think the first movie should start with the Green, and Yellow Lanterns already being at war.  Although throughout the film we'll see the Red Lanterns cropping up as a new threat to the universe, and at the end the Green Lanterns, and Sinestro have to team up to stop Atrocitus.  Guy Gardener might become the new leader of the Reds after this.  In the second movie I think it's best they avoid construct wielding villains.  They should however introduce the Star Sapphires, and Blue Lanterns.  The villains in the movie will be the Manhunters.  There needs to be some kind of focal point leader to the group, and best person I can think of for that is the Anti-Monitor, but he'd have to be nerfed pretty heavily.  In the third movie they might introduce the Orange, and Indigo Lanterns, but their parts would be fairly minor.  The villain of the movie would be Hal Jordan who has become Parallax.  Kyle Rayner would be introduced in this film when he's given a White Lantern ring.  The Black Lanterns could be brought in too, but that would work better as a Justice League movie.  I've also gotta admit it would be pretty cool to see First Lantern be a villain.  He could be thrown in as the big bad in the third film instead of Parallax, but I thought it was a cooler idea to have the original protagonist become the villain.  If the did a forth movie I guess First Lantern could be used there."
DC_Cinematic,3atb9x,Justice_Prince,2,Tue Jun 23 16:30:32 2015 UTC,"Great Ideas but I prefer First Lantern as the villain as he is the first protagonist ever and also show how lame-ass old guardians were, Parallax wouldn't be as cool now that we already had big-head man of 2011 (shudders). I think a good Guy/John movie to fill in the gap between 1st and 2nd movie might be necessary."
DC_Cinematic,3atb9x,suss2it,2,Tue Jun 23 17:21:24 2015 UTC,"First Lantern is a really cool villain, and he's got some cool visuals, but if the threats in the first two films are more alien I think it would be a fresh change to see this in the final film.  Plus it would just be such a cool character progression to see Hal go dark side."

DC_Cinematic,3at0ez,DreamSeller01,10,Tue Jun 23 07:18:22 2015 UTC,"Green Lantern and Cyborg are the two last films for a good reason.

Flash and Aquaman join the Justice League in the first part, leave to do their own movies, then return to the Justice League for the second part? Maybe I'm just reading too much into the ""Part 1"" and ""Part 2"" names, but to me that sounds like they are supposed to be one large, connected story. Why have two characters leave in the middle? Or are the Flash and Aquaman films going to be origin stories and the audience is just supposed to pretend that they happen before the Justice League: Part 1 movie?"
DC_Cinematic,3at0ez,BarbequeMeat,5,Tue Jun 23 07:51:52 2015 UTC,"Quite possible that Justice league part 1 and part 2 are placeholder names, and that nearer the time they will get a subtitle, eg like 'Age of Ultron and that 1 and 2 arent part of the same story."
DC_Cinematic,3aoof3,BattleReadyPenguin,7,Mon Jun 22 06:29:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know if the word ""anti-hero"" is appropriate.  But what I do think is that these DC films, in attempting to be more ""grounded and realistic"" will present both heroes and villains as complex as possible.  This means villains that you can empathize with, even if you don't agree with them, you get where they come from. Unlike other movie villains, you aren't waiting for them to get smacked for being obnoxious. No, you feel sorry for them and the fact that they have to fight.  Zod was his planet's Superman, his life's duty was to protect as many lives as possible. But he didn't devote himself, he didn't choose to bear this responsibility, it was given to him at birth. It was his destiny, and Kryptonian eugenics cursed him with a mind that could not operate without Krypton. Zod was literally broken, his rage had completely consumed him and at the end of the film he wasn't trying to destroy the Earth, he was trying to give Kal-El a reason to finally kill him.  We don't know much about Luthor and Black Adam but they seem to be similar cases. I'm not going to try to guess at the plot, but Black Adam is a former slave. Lex Luthor has had such a range of characterizations in the comics over the decades that it's hard to figure out exactly what Terrio/Goyer's take on him will be. But I feel that in the best Superman comics, Luthor is a man who could have saved the world all by himself but got too distracted by his competition. Whether it's due to envy or fear, he hates Superman, but they could have been friends. Luthor has a great mind and ambition and he's also a man of steel, a man of tomorrow. He may be a lying crook like in the older comics, but I hope BvS' Lex is a man who speaks exactly what's on his mind. I hope we get a man who truly wants to repair the world, whose distrust of Superman comes from a real place.  I love the imperfections that DC is giving their heroes too. Many people hate this angsty Superman, but it just feels realistic to me. For Superman to do what he does with a smile on his face at all time just seems creepy. As a man who can do just about anything, he has to feel an overwhelming responsibility at all times. He's ""over-powered"" in a videogame fighter sense, but he can easily be rendered powerless by someone like Zod when he is put in a situation where he is forced to make an obvious, but difficult choice. And Batman is paranoid, weathered by years of seeing the very worst in people. He uses fear against others, but is still controlled by it as much as everyone else at the end of the day. I'm personally excited about how they'll present Wonder Woman and Aquaman and what kind of ""flaws"" they will have/have to deal with."

DC_Cinematic,3aoof3,suss2it,13,Mon Jun 22 19:24:07 2015 UTC,"Nope, maybe Black Adam is antihero, clearly Zod was insane even by kryptonian standards, he and his minions made it clear they were on earth to create krypton even if it means genocide. Read Lex Luthor : Man of Steel to know how Evil he is. Lex is charismatic doesn't mean he is an antihero or Joker is funny doesn't mean he is not a crazy Evil lunatic. The term antihero is abused a lot . Understanding villains motive or audience being sympathetic towards him doesn't make him anthero. Anti-hero is the one who wants the same thing as the hero but his means are extreme and often put innocents in danger although the hero likes him he has to stop him for the greater good. In MOS clearly Superman hated Zod because he killed his dad and threatened his mom. In a weird way all arch-nemisis of major DC heroes except Shazam or either crazy or Evil or both.   Joker is the devil himself, He is Batman's worst nightmare. Lex Luthor is the worst of Humanity envious to the core. He stands exactly opposite of Superman on every issue. Sinestro is the personification of Fear and how that fear leads to bad decisions and even worse situations but fear is born when there is lack of will to think or act, that's why Green Lantern's power is will and funny enough Sinestro was part of GL Corps. All the Reverse Flashes try to control that which they can't, they can't let go, but Flash always tries to do his best never tries to control everything, he accepts his manifest destiny and does good where as Reverse Flashes always try to rewrite their fate. Flash moves forward towards the future Reverse Flashes always look back and move back towards the past.   The reason DC heroes and villains are so iconic because they embody absolute ideals."

DC_Cinematic,3afuw5,TrashTongueTalker,5,Sat Jun 20 08:50:06 2015 UTC,"He didn't really go into great detail about his death or anything. He just clarified that, because someone asked(he gets asked a lot).   One of his big things is being very relaxed, and trusting yourself. He told us a story about Heath worrying about Joker right before filming started(which isn't out if the ordinary for actors). Heath asked him to come over to run scenes with him and help. He gets there, Heath explains what's going on, and asks what he wants him to do. He says ""I want you to do nothing. We're going to get in my car and go bowling.""   And they did. He knew Heath had already done all of the homework. He needed to relax, and not give a fuck anymore. All that was left was to go on set and play pretend.   He's also worked with Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, Jeff Bridges, Bruce Willis, and a lot more. So he told us talked about them also. He told us stories about Brad preparing for 12 Monkeys, and how he made him stop smoking while preparing the character. Brad wasn't happy at first, but noticed it was a lot easier to create without it.   He also said what all of the actors he works with have in common, and what he has them do. One of those is having a journal to write down very personal and honest things in. Whether it's from the character's PoV, yours, or both. He didn't say ""that's the journal of Heath's that the media talked about"" or anything. No one asked. But I think it's pretty obvious that's what it was. Not some crazy thing that a lot of the media made it out to be.  I had him as a teacher. So the focus was to help us become better actors. Not tell stories about everyone he's worked with(which would have been amazing also!) Supposedly he loves doing that though, and has a good amount of stories about Heath from TDK and Brokeback Mountain."

DC_Cinematic,3afr9g,GuiltyCynic,12,Fri Jun 19 23:09:59 2015 UTC,"I'd have to respectfully disagree with you here. Not many people (outside of comic book and perhaps some video game fans) had ever heard of Civil War until it was announced for the MCU. Batman and Superman are the single most iconic superheroes of all time, and they've never been on the big screen together in a live action film. To the average movie-going audience, Batman and Superman have a bigger pull to them than Civil War. Granted, Marvel have a lot more films under their belt for this universe which is bound to have an effect, but based on the individual films (Civil War vs BvS), the two golden boys of the superhero genre are going to come out on top in regards to anticipation."
DC_Cinematic,3afr9g,Hxcfrog090,-1,Fri Jun 19 23:24:27 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but I would say recognition for what Marvel has already accomplished vs what DC could do or might do is going to sway a lot of people. I'm sure there are a ton of people who are interested, but I'm sure plenty are cautiously optimistic. Basically everything Marvel has touched has turned to gold for them? So it's obvious people flock to see their movies. I have no doubt that BvS will be awesome and I'm super excited for it, but I'm also super excited for Civil War because of the history of Marvel making great films."

DC_Cinematic,3agd6p,whatudontlikefalafel,15,Fri Jun 19 22:44:41 2015 UTC,"Knowing Warner Bros.,and how most companies are doing trailers, they will probably do the three trailer format. Let's just focus on 'The Dark Knight Rises' and 'Man Of Steel' Trailers, I think that can give us a more than decent idea of when.  The Dark Knight Rises   Teaser released on July 18th ,2011 Trailer #2 released on Dec 19th , 2011 Trailer #3 released on April 30th ,2012 Trailer #4 released on July 6th ,2012   Film was released July 20th ,2012. That leaves almost three months from Trailer 3 to release date, and two weeks from Trailer 4 to released date.  Man Of Steel   Teaser released on July 21st , 2012  Trailer #2 released on December 11th , 2012 Trailer #3 released on April 16th , 2013 ""Fate of your planet"" [Trailer 4?] released on May 21st ,2013   Film was released June 14th ,2013. That leaves two months from Trailer 3 to release date, and three weeks from 'Fate of your planet' to release date.    Originally, I was thinking trailer #2 mid to late August , but since Comic-con is in July, I wouldn't be surprised if we get it than.As for the other two trailers, I am guessing #3 November/early-December, and another one in late January/early February. I am just speculating, I could be completely off on this... but I think I am pretty close."
DC_Cinematic,3agd6p,decrepidactyl,3,Sat Jun 20 03:27:45 2015 UTC,"I think it would be amazing if they released a new trailer online to coincide with Comic-Con. Like an edited version of what they show in Hall H, for fans who don't wanna watch the bootleg but still wanna satisfy that hunger.  December makes perfect sense to me for Trailer #3. Most likely attached to Star Wars, Snyder is friends with the SW crew and why wouldn't Disney want the trailer for 2016's biggest film attached to 2015's biggest film(there's plenty room for Civil War too)?  Your guess of January/February sounds right to me. I'm leaning towards mid-February though because it's closer to release. They may even attach it to Arms and the Dudes(new WB film from Hangover crew) in March.  BvS is a unique release because it's gonna be out in late March. But it seems like they're following the same basic release structure."

DC_Cinematic,3agd6p,IAmLuckyDuckling,2,Sat Jun 20 03:38:07 2015 UTC,"It certainly will also be with that, as it's a Warner film, but they might want to put it on the biggest film of the month as well."
DC_Cinematic,3agd6p,decrepidactyl,2,Sat Jun 20 03:58:47 2015 UTC,"Star Wars is going to kill it, but Warner Bros. also know that BvS will destroy as well. They don't need more people to go see Star Wars, they need people for Point Break. Different Studios makes it even more unlikely, even though I would love it to be in front of Star Wars (apart of me hopes it)."
DC_Cinematic,3agd6p,decrepidactyl,4,Sat Jun 20 04:23:08 2015 UTC,"I'm sure WB will get it attached to both.

DC_Cinematic,3agd6p,decrepidactyl,2,Sat Jun 20 05:14:08 2015 UTC,"I am not saying it is impossible, I just really really doubt it. I think Warner Bros. are going to choose one, and that will be Point Break. It's their only chance to bring people in to that. I am not exactly on good terms with the remake of Point Break, but if the BvS trailer is in front of Point Break, I am more inclined to see it as soon as I can after Star Wars. If it is with Star Wars there is a good chance I am going to hold off on seeing Point Break."
DC_Cinematic,3agd6p,TripleSkeet,2,Sat Jun 20 21:48:37 2015 UTC,"I feel that WB is more concerned with marketing BvS in theaters than ensuring Point Break does well. They're releasing Point Break near Janurary(movie dump month) and a week after Star Wars. They aren't banking on it doing very well in the first place.  BvS might give it a little push, but what they care more about is audiences who don't seek out trailers seeing the BvS trailer in front of something big.  BvS on Point Break seems about guaranteed. But Star Wars seems incredibly likely too, WB would be stupid to attach trailers to their biggest films only onto flops."
DC_Cinematic,3agd6p,invisiblack,2,Sat Jun 20 22:05:20 2015 UTC,"Warner Bros. could release one trailer in January, and release a few posters up until the film is released , and still have the Batman V Superman make $700+ million.  I want BvS to be attached to every film, but what do I know, I am just pulling shit out of my ass. I am going to come back to this thread/comment in December, and we shall see. haha"
DC_Cinematic,3agd6p,TheMurderCapitalist,2,Sat Jun 20 22:32:34 2015 UTC,"Hell WB could release nothing else for this movie and I still bet it'd make a billion dollars.  If you haven't seen a movie in the theater in 10 years, and you walk to a theater in April and see ""BATMAN V SUPERMAN"" in big black letters above you, you don't need a poster, a trailer, a TV spot or even a synopsis to know what that movie is about - you're gonna go see it.  But yeah, I'll come back to this in a few months and see if our guesses were at all accurate too :)"

DC_Cinematic,3ad2qn,rebelinthought12345,5,Fri Jun 19 20:01:20 2015 UTC,"I still think they're better off waiting for after Thanos.  Partly so they can know what they could do differently.  Like if they had tried to put Brainiac in BvS then they wouldn't have time to adjust if their idea was too similar.  They could do something pretty different for Justice League though.  Make him colder, and more imposing.  Maybe avoid the humanoid form until the final act."

It will be intresting what they do.

That being said stating from Braniac would be pretty awesome, as he is a Superman villain the story would revolve  around Superman."

I guarantee that every time they reference that Aquaman cameo, they'll talk about how audiences all over the world will get to see his hand slapping the glass of whatever tank he's trapped in. Also, that Jesse guy is not the most gifted writer. His articles feel like a whole lot of nothing. Like he's just writing to pump out content.

Darkseid should be in film 1; it would be a big Kirby villain on screen which would be very cool."

DC_Cinematic,39s8nf,TheMurderCapitalist,0,Sun Jun 14 09:34:47 2015 UTC,"There isn't much to take from N52, don't get me wrong I love N52. But so far JL had like 4 major arcs (5 if you count Forever Evil, too premature to think about such movie), One centered around Aquaman (throne of Atlantis crossover), One Amazo virus arc, both JL Grid -vol4 and Trinity War  were prelude to Forever Evil. Forever Heroes is a side story to Forever Evil. Amazo Virus arc is so Lex Luthor centric and again in the after math of Forever Evil. So basically entire run of JL N52 is tied around Forever Evil except Darkseid War which is just starting now with one prelude and one main issue published.  The first story arc wasn't very good (JL origin, Darkseid attacking earth) and second was mostly filler (villains journey).  And moreover they made an animated movie around first story arc with Darkseid & it was as good as the comics!  I hope technology is caught someday to do JL on TV, so that we can get a huge sprawling JL story leading upto big event like FE over the course of couple of seasons with FE being a miniseries."

History has proven that's hard to pull off and in some cases it's a franchise killer. Thought Man of Steel was smart to keep Luthor out of it and keep it simple. Now with film 2 it's just ""put it all in there. the whole DCU""  Good luck. Terrio or no Terrio."
DC_Cinematic,39q484,BaronVonStevie,4,Sun Jun 14 19:04:44 2015 UTC,"Well the synopsis and the teaser shows that it's basically they fight then they realise there is a bigger threat and they team up, pretty by the books. I think this movie will focus on Batman and Superman and the other characters will flow in naturally( Kind of like Wonder Woman who could be helping the two fight Doomsday or something) Even Jason Momoa said its not Aquamans movie so he's not going to be in the spotlight. TASM 2 failed because there really wasn't a narrative that was compelling, it was everywhere. This however I know where they are going and I think they could pull it off as long as they focus on them two"
DC_Cinematic,39q484,BaronVonStevie,0,Sun Jun 14 21:26:19 2015 UTC,they need to bring their a-game and I wonder if that a-game even exists anymore. I've noticed a big drop off in quality of the animated movies after Dwayne McDuffe died. I don't trust Scott Snyder the way I trusted Geoff Johns as far as the books go. And Johns may be out of gas. What are these movies going to be? Because they could easily all be bad and jumbled up. Then the DCCU would be dead.

DC_Cinematic,39lerz,WildEndeavor,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:32:37 2015 UTC,Nope. No way to know if these are official.
DC_Cinematic,39lerz,JamesTheGent,2,Fri Jun 12 20:26:37 2015 UTC,"He is saying these are from licensing expo, so might be legit marketing posters. Otherwise some one from expo might have called BS!"
DC_Cinematic,39lerz,dc_fanboyforever,4,Fri Jun 12 20:37:52 2015 UTC,"At this rate, by the time the film is released, I can print out all this (possible) bullshit concept/promo art and make my own art book."

DC_Cinematic,39kker,jadalaawar,7,Fri Jun 12 11:11:22 2015 UTC,Powergirl. She is probably my favourite female superhero.

DC_Cinematic,39kker,Csantana,3,Fri Jun 12 14:50:24 2015 UTC,¿Porque no los dos?
DC_Cinematic,39kker,strong_schlong,4,Fri Jun 12 18:02:56 2015 UTC,they might just do powergirl just because there is a Super girl TV show now
DC_Cinematic,39kker,Csantana,2,Fri Jun 12 15:29:52 2015 UTC,I don't think that will hold them back at all.  After all Barry Allen is the TV Flash and they're using Barry Allen in the movie too.
DC_Cinematic,39kker,mrthewhite,2,Sun Jun 14 12:02:28 2015 UTC,I want to argue that Flash is bigger character or something but that is a very good point.
DC_Cinematic,39kker,Csantana,4,Sun Jun 14 14:24:59 2015 UTC,Well Supergirl has already been canonized. There was a prequel comic that revealed she was aboard the ship Clark found in MoS. And there was the one cryo/stasis chamber open which I think was also hers in the comic.
DC_Cinematic,39kker,AskMeAboutMy_Comics,2,Fri Jun 12 12:38:34 2015 UTC,They could just name her Power Girl...
DC_Cinematic,39kker,MiQBonafide,2,Fri Jun 12 13:54:15 2015 UTC,"Seeing as Supergirl's getting her own show, which is presumably set in a different continuity to the films, they might as well make use of Power Girl in the movies rather than doubling up on the Supergirl character. My choice of actress to play Karen would be the lovely Alice Eve."
DC_Cinematic,39kker,Jangwin,5,Fri Jun 12 12:55:41 2015 UTC,Because ... reasons.
DC_Cinematic,39kker,MiQBonafide,4,Fri Jun 12 13:54:35 2015 UTC,"They're doubling up on Flash and possibly Green Arrow, so I don't see why not."
DC_Cinematic,39kker,RocketTheCoon,2,Fri Jun 12 15:12:53 2015 UTC,"Flash is really the only major one. I doubt they'd use Green Arrow at this point in the DCCU, there's really no place for him in any of the announced movies. I assume they'd want to try to minimize the number of major characters they double up on."
DC_Cinematic,39kker,Jangwin,-1,Fri Jun 12 15:18:34 2015 UTC,"Well if they wanted to avoid doubling up, the Flash would have been the perfect character for that.  Wally West was an incredibly popular Flash for a long time.  I don't think they care about using characters that were on TV."
DC_Cinematic,39kker,mrthewhite,2,Sun Jun 14 12:04:46 2015 UTC,I like the name power girl more.
DC_Cinematic,39kker,bobaf,2,Fri Jun 12 20:31:57 2015 UTC,"Power girl originally was earth 2 supergirl, so they're they pretty much are the same person..."
DC_Cinematic,39kker,King-Grimm,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:11:04 2015 UTC,Power girl could not exist without Super girl because Power Girl is a clone of Super Girl
DC_Cinematic,39kker,BattleReadyPenguin,7,Fri Jun 12 12:37:42 2015 UTC,Power Girl is an alternate reality version of Supergirl. She was only a clone in Justice League Unlimited.
DC_Cinematic,39kker,Jangwin,5,Fri Jun 12 12:51:07 2015 UTC,"Well fuck me I am so sorry I thought my knowledge was all caught up, now that I think Supergirl is a must because of the man of steel prequel comic and the open pod in man of steel, if they did go for power girl people would complain about her costume and it would have to be reworked."
DC_Cinematic,39kker,BattleReadyPenguin,3,Fri Jun 12 13:07:51 2015 UTC,Power Girl's real name in the comics is Kara Zor-L. The Man of Steel prequel comic was about Kara Zor-El. They could always make her become Power Girl instead of Supergirl in the cinematic universe.
DC_Cinematic,39kker,Jangwin,6,Fri Jun 12 13:44:58 2015 UTC,True but her costume could cause quite a uproar if the right people find out.

DC_Cinematic,39kyj4,invisiblack,0,Fri Jun 12 16:53:34 2015 UTC,I still feel like it's gonna end up being Wally in the movies.
DC_Cinematic,39kyj4,Justice_Prince,12,Fri Jun 12 19:38:58 2015 UTC,"The guys writing Flash (2018) actually name dropped Barry, so I'll go with that until WB says otherwise."
DC_Cinematic,39kyj4,invisiblack,11,Fri Jun 12 19:55:32 2015 UTC,"In JL? Hal, I need that Hal/Barry bromance and Hal fucking with Bruce, nothing better.  In the GL standalone? BRING ALL THE LANTERNS. I want to see Hal/Guy/John/Kyle all working together to save Oa or the universe, keep it away from Earth so it can stand on its' own."
DC_Cinematic,39kyj4,KyleRaynerGotSweg,4,Fri Jun 12 15:23:45 2015 UTC,This is really the winning formula I believe. If WB decides to focus on one lantern for the solo film I feel like they haven't learned anything from their first movie.
DC_Cinematic,39kyj4,TheMurderCapitalist,3,Fri Jun 12 20:58:30 2015 UTC,"The best part of the Green Lantern Corps is having them all work together, there is no reason to change that in the films. There are a lot of different ways that they could set it up/explain why there are multiple lanterns already, it wouldn't be too difficult and it would be a lot of fun to see all of those guys represented on film."
DC_Cinematic,39kyj4,KyleRaynerGotSweg,2,Sat Jun 13 02:52:12 2015 UTC,Plus I feel like that's the only chance of us getting Guy or Kyle haha so I'm all for it
DC_Cinematic,39kyj4,TheMurderCapitalist,0,Sat Jun 13 06:39:10 2015 UTC,I could do without Guy.
DC_Cinematic,39kyj4,mrthewhite,2,Sun Jun 14 11:59:40 2015 UTC,Guy has way more personality than John though

DC_Cinematic,39kyj4,swordmaster123,2,Sat Jun 13 18:36:25 2015 UTC,I want the Green Lantern movie to take place off Earth with Guy Gardner as the lead. Keep Hal on Earth with the Justice League. That way we'd have our cake and eat it too.
DC_Cinematic,39kyj4,Serge_General,3,Sun Jun 14 03:46:57 2015 UTC,"Since in this DCCU Batman is older and has been around for a while, why not have a seasoned older Hal Jordan lantern with some badass Kingdom Come armor and introduce Jon Stewart as the ""new recruit"" and go through the discovering of powers with him and older Hal can either be a mentor, or kinda pissy grumpy old man that prefers to turn his back to Earth and only looks to the stars.  My 2 cents."

DC_Cinematic,39jh12,IIIISuperDudeIIII,2,Fri Jun 12 03:52:33 2015 UTC,I've been waiting for a WW movie for like 15 years now. Superhero movies are on the verge of becoming stale and they've yet to put her in a movie. come on.
DC_Cinematic,39jh12,dc_fanboyforever,-5,Fri Jun 12 21:28:11 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's pretty much what his tweet said. And that's pretty much his role at DC...  So... Yeah?"
DC_Cinematic,39np5g,glassishalf,6,Sat Jun 13 01:35:12 2015 UTC,"Don't know what kind of Justice League would include Green Arrow over Aquaman. Plus Bale's Batman just doesn't fit whatsoever in this universe, his character is just too grounded in reality to have ever made it work.The rest of the casting works well, though I'm one of those who is really excited to see what Ezra Miller brings to Flash, I can't wait to see how he does with it."
DC_Cinematic,39np5g,KyleRaynerGotSweg,4,Sat Jun 13 02:55:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah this list is overall not so great IMO. Affleck's already got me sold just from the very little footage we've seen of him in action so I'm way over the ""b-but Bale!"" phase. I'm also excited to see what Miller will do with the role of Barry Allen (hoping we can see him in costume or something at SDCC). For Martian Manhunter I'd probably cast Lance Reddick instead of Idris ""fancasted as every black character ever"" Elba, just because Reddick looks more the part plus he's got a decent voice for it. I also think he's previously expressed interest in the role if I'm not mistaken."
DC_Cinematic,39np5g,PurpleZion,2,Sat Jun 13 04:13:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed about Martian Manhunter, Idris Elba is great but my choice for Manhunter has always been Peter Mensah but Reddick would be a great choice as well."

DC_Cinematic,39gxo2,CobaltMoon98,-13,Fri Jun 12 06:57:06 2015 UTC,I'm still disappointed at him having tattoos. It just seems so out of character for him. And goofy.
DC_Cinematic,39gxo2,IIIISuperDudeIIII,8,Thu Jun 11 18:07:25 2015 UTC,You're fine with makeup and lip stick but the tattoos are too much?
DC_Cinematic,39gxo2,jordanrhys,-9,Thu Jun 11 18:24:13 2015 UTC,It's not makeup and lipstick. His disfigurement is a result of falling into the vat of chemicals.   But I've yet to see a vat of chemicals that can apply tattoos.
DC_Cinematic,39gxo2,IIIISuperDudeIIII,7,Thu Jun 11 18:28:44 2015 UTC,It's not always the same origin story for the joker. Sometimes it's disfigurement other times it's just makeup. If this Joker is done right then the tattoos are an afterthought. I hated the scars on Ledger but they served a good purpose and he wore makeup. I don't mind the tattoos if they are used well.
DC_Cinematic,39gxo2,nluna1975,7,Thu Jun 11 20:06:06 2015 UTC,i don't get it the joker gets his face cut off and wears it like mask and that's not out of character but once he gets tattoos it is?
DC_Cinematic,39gxo2,william2181,0,Thu Jun 11 18:38:19 2015 UTC,It's more that the tattoos are very on the nose that is the problem.  It looks like they were chosen out of a book.  I think they make him look more like a henchman than the joker.
DC_Cinematic,39gxo2,JeremyIsSpecial,0,Thu Jun 11 18:49:20 2015 UTC,"It's not the fact that there's tattoos there. I even quite like the mouths on his hand and arm, but God Damn, the ""damaged"" is the stupidest thing I've ever seen."
DC_Cinematic,39gxo2,eoinster,-4,Thu Jun 11 19:39:14 2015 UTC,"I also disagreed with that idiotic decision.  And I stopped reading the comic when that happened. Fuck that unnecessary bullshit.  Why does everything have to be ""edgy"" these days? Are you guys not impressed with how crazy the Joker was before? Or was that not crazy enough for you, what with your Human Centipedes and SAW XVIIIs?"
DC_Cinematic,39gxo2,IIIISuperDudeIIII,6,Thu Jun 11 18:41:22 2015 UTC,"It is not about being impressed. I just like other interpretations and sometimes that means taking librities,even though I may not like the changes. As long as the core of the character is there and its written well, chances are I can get over the changes.   You make it seem like anyone who likes this iteration is wrong, and the one[s] you like is correct. Fuck that.I happen to like what they are doing with Jared's Joker."
DC_Cinematic,39gxo2,decrepidactyl,-4,Thu Jun 11 19:34:18 2015 UTC,"I think you actually unknowingly proved his point. Tattoos all over the face and body are not really part of the core of his character. It's the first thing you notice when you look at him. You're attention should be drawn to his trademark smile, but instead you're looking at the word on his head. It just doesn't feel like the joker.   I'm not saying this iteration is wrong, I'm going to reserve judgement for the movie. But I'm surprised at how others don't see the tattoos as problematic for some. It's one thing to say you disagree, but it's something entirely different to say someone else's opinion is invalid. It's like people are taking criticism of the joker personally."
DC_Cinematic,39gxo2,TriggerHippie77,4,Thu Jun 11 19:46:06 2015 UTC,"By ""core of the character"", I meant, character traits and of the like. Which I find to be more important.   I am a huge Joker fan,so I absolutely get where you, and other people are coming from. I would be lying if I said I wouldn't make any changes. - and I never disregarded anyone's opinion.   I do have a problem when someone says 'it is completely out of character' (or something along those lines) though or any time I say ""I like the tattoos"" ,I get shit on for liking it,than people proceed to tell me how wrong I am for doing so, and that their Joker (or a different Joker) is the correct way.   Criticism and praise, sometimes there is more of one than the other, and that is okay."
DC_Cinematic,39gxo2,decrepidactyl,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:43:39 2015 UTC,I think that's a fair reply. Thanks for that.

DC_Cinematic,39gxo2,IIIISuperDudeIIII,0,Thu Jun 11 20:18:37 2015 UTC,It's by far the most common origin for the Joker.

DC_Cinematic,39h30d,whitemithrandir,4,Thu Jun 11 20:49:38 2015 UTC,I don't know but it seems like the reasonable thing both for the actor and for the studio.
DC_Cinematic,39h30d,gillespiealive,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:05:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah , business wise it does make sense, especially for the studio. But there also may be a time where an actor has a supporting role (or one they just don't like) in one universe, and is offered a more enticing one elsewhere, would they be allowed to do a deal if they weren't contractually done yet?  The example that comes to mind is Idris Elba. As we know he is Heimdall in the Thor Universe, and also one of the most popular fan choices as a John Stewart Green Lantern. I also hear he has complaints about his time filming Marvel flicks (maybe he'd have the same grumbles at DC, who knows? Not important). So I just want to know if it would even be a possible choice for casting."
DC_Cinematic,39h30d,mrthewhite,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:00:22 2015 UTC,"If they get a better deal they can always break their contract, it's not set in stone.  There's likely a penalty to that but they'd never be able to hold them indefinitely. Probably would need to give a certain amount of notice and may even need to pay a fine of some sort.  The best the studio could do would be to prevent them from appearing in the other movie within a certain window of the first studios film.  So he couldn't be Green Lantern at the same time Thor is in theaters."
DC_Cinematic,39h30d,jokermania19,3,Fri Jun 12 15:20:01 2015 UTC,"the one that comes to my mind was jaimie alexander, lady sif in thor, fans wanted her to be wonder woman. and ryan reynolds play green lantern and now deadpool, green lantern is pre-DCCU though.  but it's just a completely logical thing.  most of these actors are contracted for more than 3 movies, even after that, they probably put some clause to prevent the actors moving to DC and or vice versa.  and it's just weird. it's still weird for me to accept that steve rodgers used to be johnny storm, or heimdall is stacker pentecost from pacific rim. it'll confuse general audience, especially those who thinks that batman and iron man came from the same universe, and asking why superman is not on age of ultron, believe me, they exist.  people shit on ben affleck because he played daredevil 12 years ago."
DC_Cinematic,39h30d,okaychalet,3,Thu Jun 11 20:22:24 2015 UTC,No trouble to go from human torch to Captain America though!
DC_Cinematic,39h30d,EveryGoodNameIsGone,2,Thu Jun 11 21:53:55 2015 UTC,"Well, if it's true, it isn't true for everyone - Ayelet Zurer played Superman's biological mother in Man of Steel and the Kingpin's girlfriend on this year's Daredevil series. Though since one is film and the other is TV, it might be a different set of rules."
DC_Cinematic,39h30d,mrthewhite,0,Thu Jun 11 23:27:53 2015 UTC,"It probably is different, but it's probably also different for main or even secondary actors and minor actors.  She would have been a minor character in MoS so likely didn't have a very restrictive contract."
DC_Cinematic,39h30d,letsgetweirdkbye,2,Fri Jun 12 15:23:06 2015 UTC,"I'm waiting to see what happens with Bradley Cooper since he signed his 4 year deal with WB and then made a shit ton of cash for them with American Sniper. Not sure if he would even count since he's just the voice for Rocket Racoon. He has like 3 Oscar noms now so who knows if he'd wanna attach himself to the DCCU but that's one actor I'm wondering about in terms of marvel exclusivity or not. It would also be awesome if Idris Elba could have been John Stewart but I think with him being Heimdall it rules him out, dude looks perfect for that role."
DC_Cinematic,39h30d,mrthewhite,0,Fri Jun 12 02:46:30 2015 UTC,"Cooper could easily do non-superhero WB movies.  If there is an exclusivity deal it's likely specific to the genre, not the studio."
DC_Cinematic,39h30d,letsgetweirdkbye,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:24:30 2015 UTC,Duh. I clearly said who knows if he'd even want to join the DCCU. Obviously he can make any sort of movie he wants with WB...why else would he sign a 4 year deal lol. Why does everyone on this site feel the need to act this way.
DC_Cinematic,39h30d,mrthewhite,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:29:30 2015 UTC,That sounds like something that would happen but I haven't heard specifics.
DC_Cinematic,39dm7u,ninjartist,22,Thu Jun 11 01:29:26 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say this is completely true. Marvel simply doesn't have any major upcoming blockbusters, and spending any amount of money promoting one of their smaller films like Ant-Man against DC would be a waste at Comic Con."
DC_Cinematic,39dm7u,thelastbrew,2,Thu Jun 11 03:46:08 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't promote Ant-man, since it comes out a few days after comic con.I totally get what you're saying though, but I can't imagine Marvel not attending Comic con, if WB/DC wasn't there this year. Now, I don't think Marvel is afraid of DC (because they shouldn't be), just that they are being smart about this."
DC_Cinematic,39dm7u,decrepidactyl,2,Thu Jun 11 16:49:12 2015 UTC,"Well take into account that Star Wars, a Disney property, will also be at Comic Con. By Marvel taking a seat, Star Wars can absorb a little more of that attention."
DC_Cinematic,39dm7u,thelastbrew,19,Fri Jun 12 02:26:46 2015 UTC,I should call off work just to follow updates on the internet.
DC_Cinematic,39dm7u,BatmanDavey1986,14,Thu Jun 11 01:43:20 2015 UTC,"Marvel said they weren't going to be at ComicCon about 6 months ago. I doubt even WB knew what they'd be presenting, let alone Marvel."
DC_Cinematic,39dm7u,YoureASoldierBodie,7,Thu Jun 11 06:59:00 2015 UTC,"I'm sure Disney isn't sweating with all their ridiculously lucrative properties, but if this is true it makes me HYPED that DC marketing will soon be in full force."
DC_Cinematic,39dm7u,timetravlrfromthepst,4,Thu Jun 11 01:33:45 2015 UTC,"I mean, Disney still has a Star Wars panel on Friday, so they still have a big presence at Comic Con"
DC_Cinematic,39dm7u,decrepidactyl,8,Thu Jun 11 19:23:44 2015 UTC,"Look,as much as this guy loves to smell his own shit, I believe this to be true. I love Marvel as well , but if that DC presentation slate is legit, there is not much that they could do to compete or rival.   The fanboy in me though, is so stoked that this is finally happening, and to come out of the boom tube fighting strong. I love it. I can't wait."
DC_Cinematic,39dm7u,lizabeth_v,5,Thu Jun 11 02:03:47 2015 UTC,Idk if its this but DC is planning to rule sdcc. The DC TV Hall H takeover on saturday is huge. Plus Marvel/ Disney has movies and yes thats a bid draw but DC has TV and movies. Did the Hall H panel last year with DC TV after Marvel and I have to say DC did better. 3 pilots and free swag and they used the whole Hall H.
DC_Cinematic,39dm7u,Justice_Prince,6,Thu Jun 11 05:53:54 2015 UTC,"To some extant true, but I'm not sure if they know how much DC was planning.  I don't know if it's just because of WB either.  There are a lot of things competing at Comic Con.  They've decided it's in their best interests to dominate the news cycle in their own week rather then compete with everything else at Comic Con."
DC_Cinematic,39dm7u,Nickerdoodle,3,Thu Jun 11 02:58:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a matter of ""can't compete"", Marvel has nothing new to reveal, so why bother? They already played their hand with the Phase 3 reveal months ago. Ant Man is too small of a movie to show off against BvS/SS, sure, and there's not much they'll show us from Civil War, so really, there's just nothing for them to give us."
DC_Cinematic,39dm7u,swordmaster123,2,Thu Jun 11 15:02:07 2015 UTC,"Whilst I do prefer DC I doubt this is true. Marvel is doing well, I actually think they don't need to be their. People know what to expect from them and they have already detailed their upcoming film slate. Also if Star Wars is there, that might be a reason as both owned by Disney; they might want to give Star Wars the spotlight.  Nevertheless, hopeful that DC can compete with Marvel."
DC_Cinematic,39dm7u,Hxcfrog090,2,Thu Jun 11 17:37:28 2015 UTC,"I don't know how much I buy this. This will be the last Comic Con before Civil War comes out, which will be as huge for them as Age of Ultron was. I highly doubt they would skip out. Especially because of competition. And I highly doubt if they did end up skipping that it would be because of DC's slate...it would be because they feel they have very little to show."
DC_Cinematic,39dm7u,Wakeboarder1019,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:41:35 2015 UTC,This is dumb.  Marvel stated 6 months ago they wouldn't be there this year.  And why?  Because when the Ultron trailer leaked and they called their own mini con to talk about phase three people showed up in droves. Why participate in any forum where all the attention isn't on you when you can hold your own event totally under your control and have the same or greater attendance?  DC will likely do it at some point.  It's why there is a Blizzcon now outside of E3.
DC_Cinematic,39dm7u,KyleRaynerGotSweg,2,Thu Jun 11 14:11:15 2015 UTC,"It's all due to timing as well, DC is at a point where they can drop massive amounts of stuff and Marvel just had their big year with AoU, they know that right now DC is full of stuff to release, from trailers and footage to showing new characters and announcing casting choices, they know that at this time they just can't compete with DC at SDCC and it's not worth the massive amount of money it would take to get there when DC has all of this stuff that would overshadow what they can show at this time."
DC_Cinematic,39dm7u,mrthewhite,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:43:54 2015 UTC,lol that's so much BS.
DC_Cinematic,39dm7u,dc_fanboyforever,-14,Thu Jun 11 19:56:33 2015 UTC,"I think it's overblown, did Zack had a panel last year? No film wasn't ready, as someone who's very critical of the mediocre MCCU stuff, I say this is just unfair to Marvel guys. On the other hand if they want their own dog and pony show, fuck them, either use the common dog & pony show or go fuck yourselves!"

Ships missing, report by Lois Lane like first movie Superman : Savior or Alien menace? Batman sightings : How Gotham isn't a fail city yet, people say because Batman, but no one knows for sure (except Gordon & company))   Too Soon :   Red streak and Green skies.   Maybe there should be a heavy Lex Luthor angle like Harvey Dent in Dark Knight. Although Dent from a narrative perspective wasn't the biggest thing but from thematic view he was the core character of Dark Knight."
DC_Cinematic,39d5kz,dc_fanboyforever,4,Thu Jun 11 00:33:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe Luther corp videos promoting limb replacement and robotics that alludes to Mettalo, I was thinking the red streak and green skies could help set up Justice League"
DC_Cinematic,39d5kz,dc_fanboyforever,3,Thu Jun 11 00:35:30 2015 UTC,Why in a huury for JL! It will happen but focus should be on BvS!
DC_Cinematic,39d5kz,Justice_Prince,3,Thu Jun 11 01:23:40 2015 UTC,"Because BVS is a prequel and a set up for JL having a website talk about other heroes in the world can let fans speculate who will be who without revealing anything away, they could even be short column articles that match alongside the Superman debate for example we could have title like these: life on mars, green light spotted over airfield, bludhaven crime wave, unusual lighting patterns in downtown new york"
DC_Cinematic,39d5kz,Justice_Prince,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:34:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think there are going to be sightings of other heroes.  At the start of the movie I think Superman will still be the only known superhero.  If there were other heroes already then other heroes then we wouldn't have all these people thinking Superman is a god.  You've got Batman, but he was thought of as more of a myth, and doesn't have any powers anyways.  Themyscira may have been discovered, but Diana hasn't gone public about her powers (but no secret identity please).  Finally we have the Atlantians making their presence known with attacks of oil rigs, or fishing boat, but there's no indication that they have superpowers.  No word of Flash, or Green Lantern yet, but ARGUS might be in possession of Abin Sur's ship."
DC_Cinematic,39d5kz,samd577,2,Thu Jun 11 01:42:48 2015 UTC,Green Lantern could be off world and Flash in a coma or just awaking and discovering his power

Where w is favored weapon's placement on a spectrum of effectiveness from 1 to 10, with 10 being most effective. Where t is placement on a spectrum of general aesthetic taste from 1 to 10, with 10 being greatest aesthetic taste. Where z is placement on a spectrum of respect for others from 1 to 10, with 10 being greatest respect for others.   Captain Boomerang is a douchebag, setting douche concentration squarely at 10. Assuming the worst case scenario, Cap's boomerang-pattered tunic and trouser combo ranks 1 on the fashion sensibility spectrum. Boomerangs, though used as weapons by several cultures, have rated at 2 in effectiveness since the advent of firearms. Aesthetic taste rests at 1, considering he cannot design anything without a reference to his favored weapon.

DC_Cinematic,398qzi,KyleRaynerGotSweg,4,Thu Jun 11 03:45:14 2015 UTC,"Just my theory here, but I think he'll be playing John Corben (Metallo) and he'll be a victim of the destruction of Metropolis which resulted in the loss of his legs and possibly a wife or fiancee, which is what gives him a reason to hate Superman and want to kill him. I really hope it goes down like this because it would be Superman having to physically and mentally face the consequences of his battle with Zod and will be a big moment for him in becoming the Superman we know and love, he'll be brought back down to Earth and he will take a big step in becoming the hero that the world needs."

DC_Cinematic,395y3b,Tensor_,10,Tue Jun 9 15:13:29 2015 UTC,"A lot of people are over-analyzing the ""greatest threat the world has ever known"" stuff. Remember that this stuff is written by a marketing team, not a bunch of screenwriters. They're going to throw a lot of buzzwords at you that aren't necessarily going to mean anything."
DC_Cinematic,395y3b,JimmyBing,3,Tue Jun 9 16:00:58 2015 UTC,And they have to keep it vague.
DC_Cinematic,395y3b,rustedmachines,11,Tue Jun 9 20:06:13 2015 UTC,"That last line really changes a lot of thinking about this film for me, because Luthor himself never actually wants to put humanity at risk, so he probably won't be the threat. I'm gonna go with the theory others have said that Luthor gets his hands on Kryptonian technology and during his experiments with it he releases the Brainiac AI, setting Brainiac up as the primary antagonist for JL: Part 1. My hope is that in this film Luthor creates Metallo after he and Bruce Wayne work together to create Kryptonite from the parts of the world where the world engine terraformed, and while Bruce wants to have the Kryptonite only as a last resort in case Superman goes out of control, Luthor himself stole some to create Metallo to kill Superman, and again at some point in the film while messing with the Kryptonian tech accidentally releases Brainiac."
DC_Cinematic,395y3b,KyleRaynerGotSweg,7,Tue Jun 9 14:47:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think it will be Metallo.  Wonder Woman will most likely be joining in on the final fight, an she could curb stomp Metallo all on her own.  They could add a bunch of drones to even things out, but people are tired of cannon fodder armies, and I think they know that.  Plus we had Ultron this year, Sentinels last year, and Tony's Iron Legion the year before that.  If they are planning Brainiac for Justice League then they need to put the robot thing to rest for a year.  I think the final villain of the movie is going to be Bizarro.  Made from a kryptonian embryo found in the wreckage, and grown using DNA harvested from Zod's corps.  One of the important things about Bizzaro is that kryptonite has the opposite effect of him.  With a boost from that he should be a match for the entire trinity."
DC_Cinematic,395y3b,Justice_Prince,4,Tue Jun 9 15:29:56 2015 UTC,"I can agree for sure with the worry about the trend with robots, however I think Brainiac is unique enough that they could certainly differentiate him from the others. I don't think that Wonder Woman will be joining in the fight however, that's just opinion though as we don't have enough evidence to know exactly what her role is/how big it is. I was just thinking of Metallo and what he could offer to the film and thought of a way to introduce him that I liked and I kind of ran with it.  I can definitely see Bizarro being brought into it, similar in how I wanted Metallo being brought in, Luthor creates them as a way to take down Superman. There are a lot of big villains that DC could bring in and Brainiac and Darkseid are both the most obvious and most likely I would say, but with both of them comes the risk of people thinking they're ripping off of Marvel having just used Ultron and soon Thanos."
DC_Cinematic,395y3b,KyleRaynerGotSweg,3,Tue Jun 9 16:25:59 2015 UTC,"Before I saw Age of Ultron I was a little worried that DC might have trouble using Brainiac afterwards, but after seeing it I think there's room for them to make him work.  A lot of people found Ultron underwhelming so there's room to make him better.  Main thing is that they were trying really hard to humanize Ultron so DC should go the opposite direction with Brainiac.  Make him much more cold, and calculating, and avoid having him use a human form until at least the final act.  Biggest issue is that the most likely way they would bring in Brainiac is having Lex find the progrm in the Kryptonian wreckage, but that's pretty similar to the way they brought in Ultron in the movie.  In the comics Ultron was always a purely terrestrial creation so I suspect that Marvel changed that up specifically to screw over DC.  Anyways I think Brainiac might show up in BvS, but he won't truly make his villainous debut until Justice League Part 1.  As for Wonder Woman there has been some leaked information that suggest we'll get to see her in action so it seems likely that she'll be joining in on the final fight."
DC_Cinematic,395y3b,Justice_Prince,3,Tue Jun 9 16:54:01 2015 UTC,"I love your idea, but I would use Doomsday instead of Bizzaro. People may find a fight between Superman and Bizzaro to be too similar to Superman v. Zod."
DC_Cinematic,395y3b,doyleb3620,3,Tue Jun 9 19:21:26 2015 UTC,"Either way it sound like it's going to be a botched kryptonian clone, and in that case I'd argue that Doomsday would actually be more like Zod then Bizarro.  Like Zod, Doomsday is a villain that you have to kill, but Bizarro can be sympathetic enough that they have to find a non lethal way of dealing with him."
DC_Cinematic,395y3b,Justice_Prince,2,Tue Jun 9 19:30:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I see what you mean. Audiences might get sick of seeing Superman killing his adversaries.    Know what would be interesting though? Somewhere along the line, maybe in JL part 2, have Luthor make a successful Kryptonian clone. Then you can have him/her lead some sort of anti-JL, or Legion of Doom."
DC_Cinematic,395y3b,doyleb3620,3,Tue Jun 9 19:46:01 2015 UTC,"I was figuring doing Bizarro now, and when he'd make Metallo when he was forming the Legion of Doom"
DC_Cinematic,395y3b,Justice_Prince,3,Tue Jun 9 20:02:59 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly. Well said.
DC_Cinematic,395y3b,thelastbrew,8,Tue Jun 9 14:52:16 2015 UTC,"Fearing the actions of a god-like super hero left unchecked, Gotham City’s own formidable, forceful vigilante takes on Metropolis’s most revered, modern-day savior, while the world wrestles with what sort of hero it really needs.  And with Batman and Superman at war with one another, a new threat quickly arises, putting mankind in greater danger than it’s ever known before.      Wonder what the new threat is. Doesn't sound like Luthor since it talks about putting mankind in greater danger than it's ever known before, which means the threat is bigger than the Kryptonian invasion. This reminds me of all the rumors about Doomsday being in the movie."
DC_Cinematic,395y3b,invisiblack,3,Tue Jun 9 14:52:46 2015 UTC,"I really hope Doomsday is not in this movie.  My money is on Brainiac. Lex Luthor should be behind the creation of Brainiac, based on Kryptonian technology taken from the ships from the first movie. Luthor uses Brainiac to try and show the world what a danger these ""heroes"" are, but Brainiac gains sentience and gets out of control and the trinity have to fight it. (I know, it's too similar to Age of Ultron, but what are ya gonna do at this point?)  Aquaman and Cyborg join the fight at the end."
DC_Cinematic,395y3b,IIIISuperDudeIIII,5,Tue Jun 9 15:37:00 2015 UTC,"I don't like the idea of Luthor creating Brainiac, like you said too similar to Ultron really. Why not stick closer to the comics and have Luthor accidentally activate the Brainiac AI that Brainiac left on Krypton before it was destroyed? Perhaps by messing with the technology he activates the AI Brainiac left behind and by doing so alerts Brainiac to Earth, and more importantly, Superman's location. In the comics Brainiac wants Superman because Brainiac want's to collect the knowledge and history of every world before he destroys them, and to him Superman is the last living piece of Krypton he can find. So he is alerted to this signal and discovers not only Superman but Earth as well, an entire new planet for him to consume the knowledge and history of."
DC_Cinematic,395y3b,KyleRaynerGotSweg,5,Tue Jun 9 16:29:27 2015 UTC,"Great idea. Superman also contains the Codex, which is the Wikipedia of Krypton."
DC_Cinematic,395y3b,IIIISuperDudeIIII,2,Tue Jun 9 17:38:42 2015 UTC,"Sounds a little like... Age of Ultron, doesn't it?"
DC_Cinematic,395y3b,jordanrhys,2,Wed Jun 10 02:44:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I said it was too much like Age of Ultron."
DC_Cinematic,395y3b,IIIISuperDudeIIII,3,Wed Jun 10 03:03:17 2015 UTC,"I think the line ""greater danger then it's ever known before"" is just hyperbole.  Doomsday might be stronger then Zod, but he doesn't have a World Machine.  Probably the two most obvious threats bigger then a Kryptonian invasion would be either Brainiac, or Darksied, and I don't think they'll be jumping to either of them quite yet."
DC_Cinematic,395y3b,Justice_Prince,7,Tue Jun 9 15:36:49 2015 UTC,Please be Brainiac. Please be Brainiac.

A lot of people are suggesting that could be Aquaman. Personally, I really hope that's the case. I'd rather not see Doomsday in this, and would prefer Luthor to mostly stick to the shadows for now.    EDIT: User Colonol_Neville_Wraithchild on slashfilm.com: ""Aquaman will be the threat; i´m calling it now. king of atlantis, he wants to 'unite the seven' which i'd be damned if he's not referring to the seven seas, thus wanting to sink all continents in order to unite the world's seas into one big sea. which better way to cement aquaman as a badass and put those 'flimsy and useless' insults to rest."""

DC_Cinematic,398owm,hellsbellltrudy,-1,Wed Jun 10 01:39:28 2015 UTC,I know it's not announced on the slate but I assume when Suicide Squad makes a shit ton of money it will probably get some sort of sequel...especially with the A list talents signed to multiple contracts. If Deathstroke ends up being in Suicide Squad I would hope Green Arrow might show up in the Suicide Squad sequel. I would also hope he'd get his own stand alone or at least be a part of the Justice League in part 2 but it really seems like WB/DC will wait until that one show on CW11 ends before they introduce a badass Green Arrow into the DCCU.
DC_Cinematic,398owm,letsgetweirdkbye,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:36:27 2015 UTC,"They're in different universes, so he could easily show up in the DCCU. They're doing someone else as The Flash in the DCCU (It'll still be Barry Allen, but someone else will be playing him).  But Green Arrow is not currently part of the Justice League in the comics (Cyborg took his place), and neither is Martian Manhunter, and the marketing so far has been ""Unite the Seven"" which has already been confirmed:  1) Superman  2) Batman  3) Wonder Woman  4) Aquaman  5) Flash  6) Green Lantern  7) Cyborg  So, Green Arrow may get his own movie or something, but probably not be in the Justice League movies. They're making too much from the TV show to confuse fans like that.   Sadly, I think we're going to have to wait until the Arrow show is cancelled to get a real Green Arrow representation on either screen. ""Arrow"" is just ""Batman-Light, with Friends!"" His personality and purpose are nowhere near what Green Arrow should be, and much more similar to Batman than Green Arrow. Honestly, Daredevil on Netflix is much more ""Green Arrow"" than Arrow is."

DC_Cinematic,392dyp,suss2it,4,Mon Jun 8 20:10:14 2015 UTC,Sometimes you just can't be subtle on internet!
DC_Cinematic,392dyp,dc_fanboyforever,9,Mon Jun 8 23:06:15 2015 UTC,"Long Rant ahead :  I think it is personal experience, I didn't much care for Superman before Man of Steel, sure I watched Superman/Shazam, Superman in JL was alright but didn't evoke same emotion as Batman or even GL or Flash. I used to defend Superman against my hater friends that stopped when we all saw Man of Steel and they became MOS devotees (which i think is very unhealthy ..). And when someone says MOS is the worst thing to happen to Superman or DC is very disingenuous, after watching MOS I read Superman Earth:One, Re-watched All Star Superman, Re-read Superman/Batman series by Loeb and I bought as soon as I can the only good superman trade of N52, Superman Unchained. And I started reading injustice, so it really ticks me off, specially when they quote Timm as be all and end all of DC. These same haters hated, Batman Brave and the Bold and said Timm would hate it, but guess what last year on 75th anniversary of Batman Timm basically endorsed Brave and the Bold. MOS mayn't be a great thing in itself, but it was a turning point in my fandom."
DC_Cinematic,392dyp,dc_fanboyforever,3,Mon Jun 8 23:03:02 2015 UTC,"So suck it haters, even your god and savior Bruce Time wanted to do that, so why don't you all go fuck yourself!   Well to play devil's advocate, Bruce Timm has said several times he never knew what to do with Superman. Also, his Superman series was distinctly less well received than his Batman one."
DC_Cinematic,392dyp,Gerry-Mandarin,15,Mon Jun 8 20:27:35 2015 UTC,Less well received doesn't mean poorly received though and I think that's just due to the popularity of the character at the time too
DC_Cinematic,392dyp,TheMurderCapitalist,0,Mon Jun 8 20:58:36 2015 UTC,"I never meant to say he was poorly received. It was okay, not spectacularly like Batman. As for Superman's reputation and popularity, his Batman series was coming of the back of the Schumacher films.  Bruce Timm is an okay Superman writer. So him saying he agrees with a film that was received okay (like his own series) is nothing surprising.  But when you look at those who wrote critically lauded stories, they tend to disagree with the interpretation somewhat.  Again just playing devil's advocate here. I don't really have a problem with Zod dying. But not because of Bruce Timm."
DC_Cinematic,392dyp,Gerry-Mandarin,7,Mon Jun 8 21:10:12 2015 UTC,B:TAS: predates the Schumacher movies. They even took Mr. Freeze's origin in *Batman and Robin from B:TAS.
DC_Cinematic,392dyp,suss2it,3,Mon Jun 8 23:08:09 2015 UTC,I think the series started shortly after Batman returns.

DC_Cinematic,392dyp,suss2it,8,Tue Jun 9 18:23:47 2015 UTC,Didn't Timm end up having Superman lobotomizing Doomsday with the laser eyes? I feel that is a more torturous end...
DC_Cinematic,392dyp,kinitaro,8,Mon Jun 8 20:08:00 2015 UTC,"That's was alternate universe Justice Lord Superman who was a bad guy, not the main JLU Superman."
DC_Cinematic,392dyp,drakesfolly,3,Mon Jun 8 20:09:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but then Doomsday came back and Supes tried it, but Doomsday healed. He also tried to kill Darkseid a ton."
DC_Cinematic,392dyp,IAmLuckyDuckling,7,Mon Jun 8 23:54:58 2015 UTC,That was the more extreme Justice Lords version that did that. Regular Supes tried too but at that point Doomsday was immune to it so he settled for chucking him into the phantom zone instead.
DC_Cinematic,392dyp,suss2it,3,Mon Jun 8 20:11:33 2015 UTC,"I always said about the ending of Man of Steel; somebody who knew comic books came up with that idea. It was a cool ""final moment"" between the two characters. I just don't think you bust that out minutes after Zod approaches a point in his character arc where Superman makes perfect sense as an arch enemy. That whole ""my purpose was to protect Krypton"" speech just before they fought was great and set both characters up for a rematch... not a final battle."

DC_Cinematic,391292,HarishChengaiah,5,Mon Jun 8 13:54:35 2015 UTC,"With BvS predicted to make as much as The Avengers did, I wonder what this guy's guess will be when JL gets closer."
DC_Cinematic,391292,caughtupincrossfire,6,Mon Jun 8 16:00:34 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I don't think he is that far off with the number for Bats V Supes. Man Of Steel made 650 million dollars.I think the number will be close to 900 million to 1.1 billion. I keep going back and forth with that, but in my mind that is a more than respectable goal (number) for Warner Brothers.  I do think, his number for Suicide Squad is going to be wrong. I think Suicide Squad would be lucky to get 600 million - and I am going to guess it will be lower than that.  I honestly have no idea what kind of numbers Justice League ( and Infinity War) will be pulling in."
DC_Cinematic,391292,decrepidactyl,4,Mon Jun 8 16:26:21 2015 UTC,"Actually Suicide Squad will be making more than MoS (668 million) pretty easily, because August release window is a gold mine with no competition and if the movie turns out to be great with good reviews online this movie can easily measure up to Guardians of the Galaxy's level (780 Million) and if history has taught us something it is that, anticipation and expectations will be carried off to one film from it's prequel (for example a great deal of anticipation was carried over to Iron Man 3 from The Avengers and that played a huge factor in IM 3's 1.2 Billion grab) in a similar way the speculated success of Batman v Superman and that Suicide Squad is just 4 months away from Batman v Superman means Suicide Squad can make what I have predicted."
DC_Cinematic,391292,decrepidactyl,5,Mon Jun 8 17:28:27 2015 UTC,"If it makes pulls in that kind of money, great. I keep forgetting they are part of the same universe now, so people will jumping from Batman V Super to Suicide Squad. You are probably right, though."
DC_Cinematic,391292,Justice_Prince,5,Mon Jun 8 17:38:23 2015 UTC,I think that's why they made sure Batman is in it.  They want people to know it's tied to everything else.
DC_Cinematic,391292,Justice_Prince,3,Mon Jun 8 18:02:56 2015 UTC,"I kinda doubt it will make that much.  I guess GotG proves that a relatively unknown franchise can be a surprise success so I guess it's possible that Suicide Squad will make pretty good money.  Coming after BvS does help, and the Batman cameo as well.  I still that that unless the reviews are amazing it will make more like 400 to 600."
DC_Cinematic,391292,S0ckHeaven,3,Mon Jun 8 18:07:19 2015 UTC,SS will have more known quantities though. Any movie you can throw Batman and Joker in the trailers has a good leg up.
DC_Cinematic,391292,Justice_Prince,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:28:33 2015 UTC,"First I think it's worth considering that Man of Steel actually underperformed.  668 Million is nothing to sneeze at, but with as big as the movies budget was they were probably expecting a minimum of 700 Million.  BvS has considerable hype behind it, but MoS might hurt it somewhat.  I think it will break a billion, but I doubt it will match up with Avengers."
DC_Cinematic,391292,dc_fanboyforever,4,Mon Jun 8 17:37:53 2015 UTC,"Budget of 225 Million and a Box Office collection of 668 Million that's almost thrice the return, an extremely good return but an addition of 100 Million was used for Marketing and Distribution of Man of Steel and WB got 160 Million from Marketing partners even before the movie's release and got another 170 Million from home release (Blu Ray and DVD)  so 668 M + 160 M + 170 M = 998 Million.  And I don't know how WB can consider this as an under performance."
DC_Cinematic,391292,Justice_Prince,2,Mon Jun 8 18:05:31 2015 UTC,They spent about $ 150 million in ads and marketing so basically they offset ad costs in partnerships and product placements. And they get probably 40-50% of theatrical gross.
DC_Cinematic,391292,Gerry-Mandarin,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:28:47 2015 UTC,"I guess they spent less on marketing then I thought.  At least out of their own pocket.  Typically these films spend as much on marketing and distribution as they do on production so I was assuming 450 combined, and then added 250 for what they'd want to make to pay for the sequel.  Guess I was wrong.  We don't have the final budget for BvS by they may have actually significantly trimmed that too."
DC_Cinematic,391292,decrepidactyl,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:21:16 2015 UTC,"Budget of 225 Million and a Box Office collection of 668 Million that's almost thrice the return,   That's not how the Box Office works. That's just the monetary value of all the tickets sold. Not the profit/less margin.  Going off full budget of $325 million you can work out how much the film actually made, when you apply the averages of how much a film generally makes, because distributors don't show films for free, they get a cut of the money (usually about 50%) going to everywhere that showed the film in the US.  In the US, Man of Steel what we'll call $300 million for simplicity sake. However, Man of Steel had a very heavily weighted gross towards the front end, which is better for the studio, so we'll call it 60% for Man of Steel. So that's $180 million.  Foreign receipts can vary wildly, each country is different with how much they get from the box office returns, it can be as little as 15%, sometimes pushing up to 40%. Splitting the difference at 35% at $370 million leaves us with about $120 million.  So all in all in its theatrical run Man of Steel, best case scenario, made a $25 million loss. Which is fine, a lot of big budget films make a loss, but make the profit with home media, Batman Begins did the same. The idea is to get the brand and franchise out there, currently superheroes seem immune to diminishing returns. A lot of films seem to be outdoing their predecessors."
DC_Cinematic,391292,Justice_Prince,2,Mon Jun 8 20:56:54 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, it under performed. As much as I love Man Of Steel, I agree with you, there is still a lot of controversy behind the film,and there quite a bit of people who completely despised the film/or just couldn't give a shit about it. Now, I am not too sure if over-all they will hurt it, but I think it is interesting that it could.I really want this thing to shatter records across the board, but there is a lot going against it."
DC_Cinematic,391292,Justice_Prince,2,Mon Jun 8 17:47:40 2015 UTC,"I think one of the best things BvS might having going for it is AoU's mixed reception.  A lot of people found that movie to be a lot cornier then they expected so a lot of them might be ready to jump over to a more ""serious"" film."
DC_Cinematic,391292,legopieface,3,Mon Jun 8 18:00:14 2015 UTC,"I can't say that this early, I need more market information about 2017 to say that."
DC_Cinematic,391292,Justice_Prince,2,Mon Jun 8 16:54:57 2015 UTC,"It would have been interesting to see some predictions of the other DC movies.  I'm curious to see how Wonder Woman will do.  Typically female lead movies don't do as well, but this is Wonder Woman we're talking about.  I would expect between 500, and 700 million, but it's coming out right in between Toy Story 4, and Despicable Me 3.  That could really hurt it's performance."
DC_Cinematic,391292,legopieface,5,Mon Jun 8 17:43:30 2015 UTC,My prediction is confined to the year of 2016 because there is solid market information about 2016 but the same cannot be said for the year 2017 and thus my predictions can turn out to be disastrously wrong. But I will make another prediction list for the year 2017 once i can get some real information.
DC_Cinematic,391292,Justice_Prince,2,Mon Jun 8 17:49:44 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think it'll hit the 1.5 mark. Probably just 1-1.3 We've never seen the characters before and sequels always make more money. That said, it will make more than Cap 3 no doubt. People flock to see Iron Man but the general population won't see Iron Man in the movie title and won't care."
DC_Cinematic,391292,thelastbrew,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:51:20 2015 UTC,"If the movie was just Cap, and Iron Man then you might be right, but with all the characters in Civil War it will likely be seen more as an Avengers movie then it is as a Captain America movie.  Maybe it will hurt it that they've titled it as a Captain America movie, but I think it could very well beat AoU."
DC_Cinematic,391292,letsgetweirdkbye,3,Mon Jun 8 18:57:43 2015 UTC,"We pretty much just have to wait and see whose right. Like I said, families and ""Chads"" probably just wanna see the Avengers. If the film is Cap 3 they may not wanna see it.   Still, I can't wait for 2016. Seeing my 2 favorite heroes go at it via the Box Office will be awesome."

DC_Cinematic,38xl5p,PaulEDangerously,5,Mon Jun 8 00:42:21 2015 UTC,I predict we will have two trailers. One from Bats perspective and the other fro. Supes perspective.

DC_Cinematic,38xl5p,sandiskplayer34,3,Sun Jun 7 20:41:50 2015 UTC,Sounds a lot like the teaser trailer.
DC_Cinematic,38xl5p,decrepidactyl,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:40:45 2015 UTC,"This. A quote, a scene, a quote, a scene, last one would be batman and superman"
DC_Cinematic,38xl5p,Thief_Extraordinaire,7,Mon Jun 8 01:58:57 2015 UTC,I think it will be more focused on Lex Luthor and perhaps other Justice League members.
DC_Cinematic,38xl5p,huskman,4,Sun Jun 7 18:46:03 2015 UTC,"There's a good chance the second trailer will show Lex Luthor, and Wonder Woman, but I doubt Aquaman will be showing up in it.  Maybe pre-cyborg Vic Stone."
DC_Cinematic,38xl5p,Justice_Prince,3,Sun Jun 7 20:32:06 2015 UTC,"I think it will focus on Superman more, maybe throw Lex in there, a brief look at Batman and then show Wonder Woman at the end for maybe 2 seconds kind of how they showed the Vision in the Age of Ultron trailer. Oh, and a lot of blaring horns."
DC_Cinematic,38xl5p,dharp95,2,Mon Jun 8 14:59:02 2015 UTC,"It will still be centered around Superman, but perhaps we will see Lex Luthor. Wonder woman I think will be seen in only the final trailer"
DC_Cinematic,38xl5p,dc_fanboyforever,3,Sun Jun 7 22:27:21 2015 UTC,"I would totally be okay if the only 'footage' we see of Wonder Woman, is a gif-worthy shot of the official released picture of her. As much as I want to see more of her, I think holding her stuff back is okay,because of how little [I assume] screen time she has - goes the same for Aquaman.  I kind of want it to be centered around Supes as well. I would like to see more of him, and maybe have it a bit more positive. Feel like he is not getting enough love."
DC_Cinematic,38xl5p,decrepidactyl,3,Mon Jun 8 02:36:19 2015 UTC,"I think the teaser was overall neutral, next will be Supes trailer and then Bats trailer, I read a big rumour dump 4 months ago the entire DCCU up to JL 2 is 100% Superman centric, so I have hope."
DC_Cinematic,38xl5p,dc_fanboyforever,2,Mon Jun 8 02:39:12 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think the teaser was pretty split between our two main characters nicely.Many, like myself are geeking out how perfect Batman is looking or sounding with every new info/photo, that I feel like Supes isn't getting any love - other than the teaser, I think Superman has like one (maybe two) official photo[s]. I also think, having minor changes to his suit,doesnt leave us talking with much.   I have no doubt that in the final product, it will be all good. - And Oh, interesting. I havent read that. That would be so dope,if that is true."

DC_Cinematic,38ym19,Justice_Prince,5,Mon Jun 8 05:39:42 2015 UTC,The question was what do you WANT to see at SDCC this year and that's what I want to see dammit!
DC_Cinematic,38ym19,letsgetweirdkbye,3,Mon Jun 8 05:57:15 2015 UTC,"My opinion is unpopular, but just listen. I don't want any new footage or info about any new movies nothing.  I want a panel about BvS, that's it. And I want the full Justice League in plain clothes, I remember people loosing their shit when they saw the trinity last year. Can you believe this, 7 gods standing on the podium, preferably in this order.   Arthur Curry Barry Allen Bruce Wayne Clark Kent Diana Prince Hal Jordan Victor Stone   The more you move towards the middle the more iconic heroes you get, I love the 7, I live and breathe by 5, The 3 are the first and last about everything in comics, the 2 are the biggest/ best bros ever, the 1 is all I & you ever aspire to be!  PS: I came while writing this, sorry but I had to share:). I dorked out hard on this one!  PPS: I just noticed the heroes are in alphabetical order by their first names!"
DC_Cinematic,38ym19,dc_fanboyforever,5,Mon Jun 8 01:17:41 2015 UTC,"I kind of share this opinion with you... to an extent. As far as I am concerned, I am not going to Comic Con, so I couldn't give a shit about new footage, considering it will be 'exclusive'. I hate cam shit  for this kind of thing,anyway. But we are less than a year out from Batman V Superman, and their last comic-con before that. So I think, it is a pretty safe bet that they will show something, no matter how minor.   That said, I would blow a fucking whale sized load, if we got that kind of line-up for a panel. Sure it is a dream come true, but it is also a chance to see the chemistry between one another and where they stand on some things - the latter isn't really necessary but still interesting.  Either way,here's hoping, dude!"
DC_Cinematic,38ym19,decrepidactyl,2,Mon Jun 8 02:21:24 2015 UTC,"I think we really can't judge just by their appearance, but yes would be dream come true.  And yeah, you and me brother hoping, you and me. Let Hopeman save us all :)"

DC_Cinematic,38y4lx,huskman,5,Sun Jun 7 20:57:07 2015 UTC,"You can tie most the heroes to the events in Man of Steel.  The World Machine kils a shit ton of fish pissing off the Atlantians which brings in Aquaman.  The World Maching disrupts the device/enchantment thats hiding Themyscira which brings in Wonder Woman.  The Kryptonian invasion catches the attention of the Gaurdians which brings in Green Lantern.  Vic Stone's life is saved using salvaged Kryptonoan tech which brings in Cyborg.  The one odd man out seems to be Flash.  There is a theory that the World Machine might starts a meta-crisis, but that seems a little forced to me, and I think it's good to have one hero who shows up by coincidence."
DC_Cinematic,38y4lx,Justice_Prince,4,Sun Jun 7 23:42:15 2015 UTC,"I really like your theories for all of it, especially since the involvement with Kryptonians means Superman could be seen as a negative light to many of the JL members. Just works really well actually with a post 9/11 world where Muslims and such would often be stereotyped and avoided and such. I like how the film could touch on those points.   I think Flash can just show up mind. Maybe he's not even created until some point between BvS and the JL film. Maybe he had his powers for a while but always hid them until the arrival of Superman, or maybe he was a myth for a couple of months like Batman has been for all of his career."
DC_Cinematic,38y4lx,TheJoshider10,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:27:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think they'd all see him as a negative athough they might all be as apprehensive as everyone else is.  As for Flash I've been thinking about it and I think I have a theory.  Barry became the Flash a while ago, but kept a low profile.  At some point he dies, and now that Superman is around Wally descides to replicate the experiment that gave his uncle his powers."
DC_Cinematic,38y4lx,Justice_Prince,2,Mon Jun 8 00:45:13 2015 UTC,"Oh for sure, but I feel WW and Aquaman surely have to take some tension with them since he's connected to issues related to their world's."
DC_Cinematic,38y4lx,TheJoshider10,2,Mon Jun 8 01:17:25 2015 UTC,"Whether the atlantians are even aware that an alein racde was responsible for the World Machine I think they'll be more concerned with the fishing boats that have turned to more extreme methonds in order to make their quotas.  As for the amazons they might not be too happy about their island being revealed, but Diana would be ecstatic to have her chance to finally explore outside of it."

DC_Cinematic,38y4lx,BattleReadyPenguin,0,Sun Jun 7 21:19:20 2015 UTC,"I've seen the theroy around a lot that all the other heroes were already active before Man of Steel, but it ruins the idea of Superman being the first hero, and it begs the question of why didn't they help.  You could probably account for Batman, Aquaman, and Green Lantern, but if Wonder Woman, and Flash were active people would know about it, and they would have helped.  I think Wonder Woman has to much integrity to hide who she is and what she does, and Flash has too much of an ego to let his heroics go unrecognized.  Maybe that's more Wally then Barry though."
DC_Cinematic,38y4lx,Justice_Prince,2,Mon Jun 8 00:26:02 2015 UTC,Maybe the world engine awakes him from his coma

See, I do think it should tie into MOS in someway. Even if it's just technology inspired by Kryptonian discoveries. It makes sense, and helps maintain the illusion of realism, if the alien encounter is the event that begins to spawn meta-humans."
DC_Cinematic,38y4lx,doyleb3620,-2,Sun Jun 7 23:55:26 2015 UTC,"Oh no I think you misunderstand, OP. Ezra is only playing the Flash in a movie, he won't actually become him.  All joking aside I hope they don't make too many big changes, I like your World Engine idea, makes it feel grounded and interconnected, so that, with the exception of a lot of the Leaguers, maybe a lot of the heroes were born out of the events of Man of Steel. Cyborg could maybe have been injured in the events during a Gotham vs. Metropolis football game on the same day, Flash could have been effected by the World Engine. Maybe The World Engine endangered the oceans and Arthur came out of hiding due to it."
DC_Cinematic,38wn4o,Thief_Extraordinaire,9,Sun Jun 7 13:36:25 2015 UTC,"I think the key to controlling power levels is either the character doesn't know how much power he has himself or he limits himself. In the JL series, they showed hints of MMs great potential as well as the potential of Flash, but have reasons for limiting them.   As far as dark and serious, did you really find a moment where you could stick in humor in MoS with everything going on? You're right though, there should be levity to some extent and I'm sure there will be once the heroes, particularly superman, are firmly established"
DC_Cinematic,38wn4o,rebelinthought12345,2,Sun Jun 7 14:39:13 2015 UTC,"You're right though, there should be levity to some extent and I'm sure there will be once the heroes, particularly superman, are firmly established   Glad i'm not the only one that feels this way. MoS was like....we are watching a God's story and everything was in a 2 hour documentary in a way.

I´m of the opinion that if character asks for it you have to give the movie a certain tone, be more dark and serious like Batman or more happy go lucky like The Flash(Barry at least). We will see i hope Warner doesn´t impose the looking of BvS on the rest of the movies like Marvel did with Iron Man"
DC_Cinematic,38wn4o,Justice_Prince,2,Sat Jun 13 03:55:23 2015 UTC,"We will see i hope Warner doesn´t impose the looking of BvS on the rest of the movies like Marvel did with Iron Man   Warner bros are smart, i'm sure they'll take their time and make each film in a separate setting and BvS is dark and complicated because of the conflict of whether to support superman or not, and gotham's natural setting etc.  My worry is the choice of The flash, dont know why they didnt just go with a successful, working, fanfavourite Barry allen from the series. Who, judging by the views and fanbase, made many fans interested in the DC universe. Instead they picked someone else."

Dark Knight was good about this, it had a fight, but it wasn't an action set piece.   The Riddler would force a more cerebral film, you can even center it upon the whole idea of a secret identity, what it entails, and how it would affect a person.  Don't get me wrong, I like films like Man of Steel or Avengers, but 30-40 minutes of punching to me gets old on repeat viewings.   What makes me enjoy watching a film again is character. If a film has intriguing or enjoyable characters, I'll watch it again and again. Heath Ledger's Joker in Dark Knight (Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent as well), Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds, every single... all the characters in the Princess Bride, just all of them, that movie is amazing.  Basically, I don't want to see Man-Bat, or Croc, or Clayface, or Grundy, or Bane again, or Maxie Zeus, or any adversary who's final confrontation with Batman will be ""who can punch the other more?"" The answer is Batman, because it's his film.  And before you tell me that the Riddler was in Batman Forever, that was just a bad pseudo-Joker again. But if I had to make a different pick... The Court of Owls would be nice, even if that ended with a punching contest in the comics (as far as I can remember)."

But to be honest, the fight scenes/choreography from that trilogy was pretty underwhelming. I'd say it peaked in the first half of Begins, and was pretty mediocre from there on."

DC_Cinematic,38u2t4,BardicFire,2,Sun Jun 7 07:02:21 2015 UTC,"I feel like (or hope) we will get multiple villains in the new Batman solo, so if they don't do Under the Hood and use Jason+Black mask, then I think Professor Pyg could be adapted in a completely terrifying way.I would then have the Court of Owls being built up behind the scenes eventually paying off in future Batman movies or possible Nightwing/TT/YJ style movies."
DC_Cinematic,38u2t4,grntplmr,2,Sun Jun 7 08:36:50 2015 UTC,I'd like it to see one of the more weird/super-natural villains. A Man-Bat pseudo-horror movie directed by Affleck would be interesting.
DC_Cinematic,38u2t4,S0ckHeaven,2,Sun Jun 7 10:43:35 2015 UTC,"In the realm of weird, I'd like to see them try to tackle Simon Hurt and The Black Glove. Not that I think it would work on film, but I'd love to see the attempt. Just imagining the audience's reaction when a crazy drugged out Bruce sews together from old rags a Batman of Zur-En-Arrh costume, while hallucinating Bat-Mite. And then later on explaining that Simon Hurt is really Thomas Wayne the First, a forgotten ancestor from the 1800s that was infected by Darkseid's Hyper Adapter as part of a future plan to destroy Batman for shooting Darkseid as well as all time, using his own history as a weapon. How long will the audience last? (And I LOVE Morrison's run on Batman btw, but it was crazy.)"

I was so excited for Arkham Origins because Black Mask was going to be getting some good exposure, but I was pissed when I found out what they did with him. I'd love to see Affleck direct the stand alone Batman film where Black Mask takes over the mob, or even something similar to Under the Red Hood.  Mr. Freeze would be my second choice provided they could give us something closer to the animated series Mr. Freeze. Such a great character. I find it hard to believe they could do any worse that Arnold's version though."

There's never been too much of a focus of Batman as the leader of a family on film, his failure with Jason, and Jason's resentment to his ""brothers"" would be a great way to show that. Also, adapting Under the Hood would open up a discussion on Bruce's morality.  I'd hope we never see the Court of Owls on film. Never been so disappointed with a villain, if they cut out the second half of the story that denigrated into a one-v-one fistfight."

DC_Cinematic,38tsze,AskMeAboutMy_Comics,2,Sun Jun 7 02:23:35 2015 UTC,the Dawn of Justice subtitle leads me to believe we'll see the Justice League in some form at the end of the film. That's just my opinion though!

DC_Cinematic,38t4wx,VikingChris,5,Sat Jun 6 16:22:09 2015 UTC,decrepidatyl mentioned an Anubis patch?  What if he's playing Carter Hall/Hawkman?  Some of the movie takes place on Hawkmans town Midway City so maybe it's not too much of a stretch?
DC_Cinematic,38t4wx,fractalcreatures,3,Sat Jun 6 18:15:55 2015 UTC,"You know what, that crossed my mind earlier, and by earlier I mean when Scott set photo's were first released. But I just dismissed it like it was nothing, because of ""what are the chances?"". It also didn't occur to me to think about it/or come back to it again when the Midway City stuff started to pop up on set. I think some Thanagarian lore in Suicide Squad could be a safe bet.  I have also said Kartar Hol is such a Zack Snyder character , and he would him all sorts of badass. I don't know, if Scott would be able to pull off such a part, but I wouldn't be disappointed if that is who he is."
DC_Cinematic,38t4wx,decrepidactyl,4,Sun Jun 7 03:37:49 2015 UTC,Kinda looks like a G9 also

DC_Cinematic,38t4wx,TheMurderCapitalist,4,Sun Jun 7 16:52:03 2015 UTC,GS is a military acronym for General Support. It could be that Eastwood's character is part of a military support team ordered to assist the Squad in any way they need during the battle of Midway City. This seems the most likely to me.
DC_Cinematic,38t4wx,GentlemanGearGrinder,7,Sat Jun 6 19:25:59 2015 UTC,That Grayson thing really makes no sense. I think hes just a random military dude with unknown role...:D
DC_Cinematic,38t4wx,LasDen,2,Sat Jun 6 16:52:02 2015 UTC,"If this is true, then its a real disappointment."
DC_Cinematic,38t4wx,Thief_Extraordinaire,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:15:26 2015 UTC,Same. I think he's basically the Colonel Nathan Hardy of Suicide Squad.
DC_Cinematic,38t4wx,gbm0102,-3,Sat Jun 6 17:41:22 2015 UTC,"It makes a lot of sense when you combine it with the image of ""Richard Grayson"" tombstone. It could be Dick's dad but if it isn't, this would be another possible outcome. Or they combined Dick with Jason."
DC_Cinematic,38t4wx,IwishIwasGoku,3,Sat Jun 6 18:14:52 2015 UTC,"Dick's dad is a dead acrobat so is his mom. That's the reason Batman takes him in in the first place... I highly doubt DCCU is going to change it to ""Dick's dad is actually badass army dude and still alive and Clint Eastwood's hot son."" that seems way too far outside the box and just cheap."
DC_Cinematic,38t4wx,FlameyFlame,5,Sat Jun 6 18:29:56 2015 UTC,No I'm saying the tombstone could be Dick's dad's. If it isn't that means it's Dick's. Ergo Dick is either really dead or fake dead a la Grayson.
DC_Cinematic,38t4wx,IwishIwasGoku,-2,Sat Jun 6 18:32:04 2015 UTC,Damn I hadn't seen that tombstone I had to Google it.  Now I'm angry I even opened this subreddit. I hate big spoilers like that I've been avoiding set videos and other leaks as much as possible. Blah I thought this was only gonna be discussion on the Scott Eastwood role I'm out of here.
DC_Cinematic,38t4wx,FlameyFlame,2,Sat Jun 6 18:44:39 2015 UTC,"It's not a big spoiler, it could be nothing. It's a point of speculation is all. Hence why I'm speculating about if it's connected to Scott Eastwood."
DC_Cinematic,38t4wx,IwishIwasGoku,-2,Sat Jun 6 19:13:03 2015 UTC,The tombstone and a not even sure GS initials. Couldnt possibly mean anything else just Dick Grayson....
DC_Cinematic,38t4wx,LasDen,3,Sat Jun 6 22:58:21 2015 UTC,"I never said it can't mean anything else. I said it's a possible and logical outcome given what we know so far. A tombstone with Richard Grayson on it means that it belongs to Dick's dad or Dick himself. Okay, let's say it's Dick's. At that point, the two options are that he has died (presumably combined with Jason) of he's alive but faked his death for whatever reason. Well, okay, why fake his death and who would be playing him? A possible reason would be to spy on Amanda Waller, which could be related to the fact that Batman is appearing in the movie. Scott Eastwood is one of the only high profile actors whose role we don't know. Ergo he's the most likely choice for Grayson, if in fact it is the case.   It's speculation. Sure there's nothing concrete, but there's nothing inherently wrong or illogical about it either. I didn't even say I think it's true, just that it is a possibility."
DC_Cinematic,38t4wx,IwishIwasGoku,3,Sat Jun 6 23:10:52 2015 UTC,"I have spent way to much time on this, than I would care to admit. I really can't think of anyone who has similar patches and name. I kind of gave up on it. He could be just a recurring character or even just someone to kill. Scott could be one of the numerous Argus/Checkmate soldiers or even just Waller's go-to , to keep a close eye on things.   But Here are some stand outs :   Scott's American flag is inversed, while Rick Flag's flag is on the other way around (seeming more proper). I see his initials as ""GQ"" , but apparently, others are seeing it differently, so who know. Scott's left arm patch is of Anubis"
DC_Cinematic,38t4wx,decrepidactyl,4,Sat Jun 6 17:55:17 2015 UTC,He could just be a completely new character.
DC_Cinematic,38t4wx,KillerPalm,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:42:40 2015 UTC,"The rumor was Scott Eastwood was offered to try out for the role of Steve Trevor or to be minor and recurring character in Suicide Squad and the rest of the DCCU. Now that Chris Pine is rumored to be Steve Trevor, that limits (but doesn't completely eliminate) the possibility of him being Trevor. I can't really imagine just a military man being a recurring character in the DCCU. But, I'm not too sure how he could be Grayson. So I don't know haha."
DC_Cinematic,38pc4b,TronVin,11,Fri Jun 5 18:40:47 2015 UTC,Sounds like Suicide Squad could be R-rated or a hard PG-13.

DC_Cinematic,38onlv,huskman,5,Fri Jun 5 16:08:28 2015 UTC,On IMDB (which is not at all trustworthy but hey we don't use logic here dammit these are comic book movies!) it says he's playing Officer Mike Rucka (I know anyone can edit IMDB and type in whatever they want) the dude was kind of trying to play it off like he was Green Lantern or something based off how he was responding though was pretty weird. PRETTY SURE THIS IS THE GUY LOL NO IDEA WHY PEOPLE ARE DOWNVOTING BUT GO FOR IT.
DC_Cinematic,38onlv,letsgetweirdkbye,3,Fri Jun 5 17:59:24 2015 UTC,"Green Lantern? I just read through the entire thread and didn't see one post about the dude saying Green Lantern. I don't even see anyone else saying green lantern. In fact, it looks more like the guy was trying to downplay it a bit because people kept trying to make it bigger than it was. To me, it seemed like whoever the guy actually is is just a guy who had a minor role and was happy about it. I think it's everyone else's thing to make it bigger than it is. Plus, we don't even know if the guy is who people think he is cuz the entire thing could have been faked and he hasn't posted anything since yesterday. For all we know he could have lied about every single bit, even the thank you note and patch. Or it could have been someone in DC doing something weird. We just don't know."

Since it seems they're trying to stick close to the New 52 canon, I just feel like MM is too powerful for a consistent JL roster.  With that said, I would love to see an adaption of Justice League of America. For those not familiar, Martian Manhunter is a member of the government sponsored Justice League, under command of Waller and Steve Trevor. Martian Manhunter is essentially Superman's counterpart in the anti-justice league."
DC_Cinematic,38kvcd,thelastbrew,8,Thu Jun 4 22:48:52 2015 UTC,"I feel like Martian Manhunter would need to be seriously nerfed. Completely dial down his strength and speed.

DC_Cinematic,38kvcd,Jangwin,2,Fri Jun 5 11:29:32 2015 UTC,"I agree. MM has all the power of Superman plus  mind control and shapeshifiting.   Besides, Hollywood has a somewhat justifiable prejudice against Mars after John Carter and Mars Needs Moms became some of the biggest bombs of all time.    I also love your idea of having a state sanctioned JLA fight against the JL. Maybe have Deathstroke, Cheetah, Reverse Flash, Luthor etc.  Maybe even a cloned Supergirl. That'd be sick."

So Waller is sending the Squad across the planet trying to pin down the location of somebody, not entirely sure who, who reportedly has a monster trapped in a fire lined cage. Naturally, she ends up in Gotham because Strange knows something. The Squad have no idea what Waller's end game is.   Eventually, the Squad wear these helmets designed by the Mad Hatter to ""protect them from the loud noises."" Harley eventually takes off her helmet conveniently right next to a cage. She talks about somebody in her head asking for help. Waller and Deadshot get her helmet back on, not before she says ""sorry mister!""  Final scene of Suicide Squad has a giant snake thing exiting the cage and being confronted by a teenager with a speaker in her ear and repeating Waller's words as she says them. Waller is offering the alien sanctuary, but in return he must help them deal with problems.

Not only did he hit the ground running with the sheer scope of Part 7, but with all the backtracking and creative editing he had to do after Walker's death, it's kind of a miracle that the movie came together in the end. No wonder studios are hungry for him. And he seems hungry to prove himself as the next blockbuster director. BRING ON ATLANTIS!!!"

But I think a lot of my own skepticism comes from the fact that, in terms of the DCCU, we just haven't seen any films yet. On top of that, we still know very little that isn't helped by that first point. But perhaps once the DCCU has established itself a bit more, a lot of that skepticism will fall away.  I'd also like to mention that I've seen none of Wan's films, but I heard surprisingly good things about Furious 7. Honestly, I'm more worried about the writer. Will he deliver? His best screenplay was arguably 300, with only two other films to his credit. I can only cross my fingers and be optimistic."
DC_Cinematic,38f9x6,gbm0102,3,Thu Jun 4 00:15:58 2015 UTC,"I definitely see myself easing up with my worries, once the DCCU actually has some feats under them.  I have seen every James Wan directed film ( actually just realized this ). It's not that I don't think he has what it takes, in fact I find Wan to be a more than capable director just in general. It is just, up until Furious Seven, all his prior films have been horror/thriller related and have been gloomy,shadowy, and hazy. Furious Seven for the most part, actually looked pretty good and the hand-to-hand fight choreography wasn't too shabby either. I really thought they/Warner Bros. was going to with someone like Tarsem Singh (yes,that was my fan-pick), or at least someone who has quite a bit flare to them.  I think  my doubt comes from my love for Aquaman, and because of that I can be protective (like most fan-boys, I suppose).Yeah, I agree, and 300's writing was decent, nothing complex,really.I am hoping Wan can squeeze everything out of Kurt, because he is going to need to turn it up a few notches. I like Wan, so I am rooting for him."

Shazam: a Spielburgian youth adventure, with Billy Batson given magical power after an archaeologist named Sivana opens the tomb of Black Adam.

Circe gets thrown back in Amazon prison. Wonder Woman 2- I think the second film needs to take a break from the gods to show Wonder Woman's diversity as a character.  I was considering just throwing together a few bigger name villains like Doctor Psycho, and Cheetah, but the best story I can come up with is a more character driven movie with Veronica Cale, and The Circle.  Play with the torn between two worlds thing, and deconstruct her role as a feminist icon by having these women come forward saying ""She doesn't represent me.""  At the end of the film there is a twist were it turns out Veronica Cale had been working for Circe the whole time. Wonder Woman 3- Circe has played more supporting roles in all the other movies so far so this is where she steps up as the lead threat.  Basically the film is an adaption of War of the Gods, but in this version it will be limited to two pantheons.  The Olympians, and New Genesis.

What's the strategy?  Every project is different. On some projects, we have multiple writers working together. In some cases, we put writers together who have never been a team together. And sometimes, there is only one writer whose voice is right. In the case of Wonder Woman, the right approach was to have writers pitching different scenes within the framework we created.. They came to me and said they wanted to try this approach. I don't know how much collaboration and noncollaboration was going on. Treating writers well is a massive priority at this studio.

To me, Suicide Squad is the only film planned before JL:P1 that doesn't fit within the narrative of the foundation of the Justice League. And yet, we know Batman is making an appearance and I seriously doubt WB would do that without giving this film some sort of stake in that narrative. My current guess is that SS sets up Waller as the Big Bad, and that she spearheads the creation of some anti-metahuman bioweapon (i.e. Doomsday, Blockbuster, Bizarro...) to act as the physical villain for the film. The Skwad could also be involved as a support team, both to assist the bioweapon and to make sure it doesn't cause any collateral damage."

He seems to know a lot about his character arc and is talking about redemption constantly. I think a redemption arc is a bit much to put in place for just one movie, rather they'll spread it out over Justice League and Shazam. Plus that huge fuckin' grin he puts on every interview makes me think he's a got a surprise that he just can't wait to tell us.  If Geoff Johns has a say, I wouldn't be surprised if Black Adam showed up. He's arguably one of his favorite characters. I think we'll get Adam + Luthor + a few others."

Back when Shazam was announced the president said something to the effect of ""Shazam will be different from other DC films, he's not a Justice League character"" when he was talking about tone rather than connected universe. http://screenrant.com/shazam-justice-league-movie-connections/ Then dc updated their official news talking about the slate, saying all 10 movies were in universe. http://screenrant.com/shazam-movie-justice-league-universe/ Then the final nail in the coffin that Shazam is in universe was Rock's comments. http://screenrant.com/black-adam-origins-dwayne-johnson-shazam-movie/ So it seems that all the movies on the slate are connected.

The appearance of suit came off as very alien (or at least not earth like), and advanced. How it was executed was a pretty shit attempt.I didn't hate the suit, but if they had they darkened some colours, dim/ or cut down on the illuminating light coming from the middle, and as easy as FUCKING MAKE THE GLOVES COMIC BOOK WHITE! - Could have made that suit superior in every way.  Here is some fan-art / edits of that : 1  2  Not to mention the movie itself, but I am glad Warner Bros. is taking this (DCCU) a lot more seriously. I hope they have't given up on Lantern being apart of this - because their silence on Green Lantern is having me a teeny bit worried . - Probably nothing, but still.  *this comment is from the previous thread - thought i'd copy it, since that thread is no more.

DC_Cinematic,38d0s4,thelastbrew,5,Wed Jun 3 20:17:06 2015 UTC,Didn't realize how much I dislike the mask until now. It'll be interesting to see how they revamp the costume for the new GL/GLs.

DC_Cinematic,38d1zg,mrthewhite,3,Wed Jun 3 13:30:24 2015 UTC,"Well first I wouldn't have either show up in BvS.  At that point I don't think Flash should exist yet, and Green Lantern might still be off doing his initial training.  Maybe in the ARGUS lap where they're keeping all the Kryptonian tech there will also be an easter egg of Abin Sur's ship.  I think at the beginning of BvS that Superman will still be the only known metahuman.  Otherwise it wouldn't make sense for everyone to be treating him like a god.  Wonder Woman doesn't unveil her powers until the third act most likely, hints of the Atlantians are just starting to surface, and they don't start gluing robot parts onto Vic Stone until the end of the film.  Now in Suicide Squad, and maybe even in Wonder Woman (which doesn't take place in the past) we start hearing mentions on increased meta-human activity.  Maybe even mention Flash, and Green Lantern by name, or just say something ""the speedster in Central City"" and ""the green guy in Coast City"".  Cyborg would also get a cameo in Suicide Squad to confirm that he'll be working for ARGUS in the time in between BvS, and JL.  In my plan he won't be coming until JL Part 2 so this easter egg can be held off longer, but at some point I'd have someone mistakenly refer to Superman as a Martian, and Waller interjects, ""He's a Kryptonian.  Martians have an entirely different physiology.  So now in Justice League we've already seen Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Cyborg, but we've only heard about Flash, and Green Lantern.  I think that's for the best.  Leave two characters that people can anticipate seeing for the first time.  As for how they're brought in that's the same as the rest of the heroes.  Either the big threat catches all their attentions, or one person likely either Batman, or Waller calls them all together."

A space cop who had left Earth long ago, travels back to his home, responding to Superman and the growing intergalactic importance of Earth.   The Flash is more difficult. I think it'd be tough to just say ""Hey, there's a super-fast guy running around"" with no explanation. And his standard origin of lightning striking random chemicals is pretty cheesy. I'd have  some Kryptonian tech he was examining (maybe a phantom drive) explode and have him get his powers that way."

DC_Cinematic,382zp6,BarbequeMeat,7,Mon Jun 1 14:08:33 2015 UTC,"Good read. While Leto doesn't have anything to aid his smile like the actors before him, I think the author is forgetting about the tattoos on his hands."
DC_Cinematic,382zp6,thelastbrew,3,Mon Jun 1 15:51:11 2015 UTC,"Even so, we don't know the extent of how they will be using the tattoos. I don't think they will, but more so I don't want them to rely on the tattoo smiles. Leto's organic but exaggerated smile will be awesome, so I hope they use it quite a bit."
DC_Cinematic,382zp6,decrepidactyl,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:10:34 2015 UTC,Agreed. Leto's one hell of an actor and I think we're all cheering for him. I'd like the tattoos to be functional though since they've been incorporated into the character. I hope they push some tattoo dialogue similar to Ledger's bit about his scars.
DC_Cinematic,382zp6,thelastbrew,2,Mon Jun 1 21:22:12 2015 UTC,Jump in on the conversation over in this thread!. I dish out my opinions and such on how they could use Leto's tattoos in the film.

I've read better summaries of the Jokers appearance from random people on here and it's out of passion! Not some click-bait shit who's after advertising money for his new site."
DC_Cinematic,383rzs,thatmovieperson,8,Mon Jun 1 17:23:40 2015 UTC,Dent needs to be played by someone who has a good looking face but that pretty face says I am going to kill you within a toss of a coin. My picks would be:  Christian Bale- just go see American Psycho if you don't believe me   Tom Cruise- he could do it but he may not want a villainous role  Dan Stevens- His role in the guest was awesome.  Good theory OP he could do it.
DC_Cinematic,383rzs,BattleReadyPenguin,2,Mon Jun 1 19:06:22 2015 UTC,Dan Stevens would be great and is legit feasible too.

People like you, who are keeping an open mind, and looking for the positives.Minor or Major things, it doesn't matter. This is pretty much what I have been saying since the release photo in April. For a while, I volunteered to defend it, but than I said fuck it, and I shouldn't have to defend what I like,and get shit on for doing so. I understand where people are coming from, but I think seeing how they/Ayer meshes it all together with the final product.  That said, I totally agree. I hope Ayer & Co absolutely use the tattoos in their favor.I had an idea that The Joker would cover his mouth with his hand (very much so, like the image posted), trying to hold back a laugh,but the laugh is still audible - a skewed but effective. All you see while he is doing this is his damn stupid smile on his hand ... mocking you. With the 'damaged' /or the 'J' tattoo, I can see The Joker calling out anyone who is staring - saying ""What is it? Is there something on my face?"" or ""Hasn't anyone told you, it's rude to stare ?"" * shoots them * * laughs *  Both scenarios sound really awesome, at least they do in my head.  I don't know, I think there is a lot to play off of here, regarding the tattoos. I think it would be a huge mistake if they didn't. I trust Ayer & Co, so I am not too worried about it."
DC_Cinematic,381ib4,decrepidactyl,2,Mon Jun 1 06:30:59 2015 UTC,"I have nothing else to add other than that I agree wholeheartedly and had the same notion, but OP articulated it better than I could have."
DC_Cinematic,381ib4,JeweliusCaesar,6,Wed Jun 3 02:03:03 2015 UTC,"This is amazing, the damaged tat on his forehead is not about him but Batman, this is one way to break the big bad bat."
DC_Cinematic,381ib4,BattleReadyPenguin,2,Mon Jun 1 06:21:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was trying to consider what that one would mean if it was directed at Batman.  I guess he's either saying Batman is damaged, or that it's Batman's fault that the Joker turned out this was (falling into the acid).  Maybe it's both."
DC_Cinematic,381ib4,Justice_Prince,2,Wed Jun 3 17:14:59 2015 UTC,Or maybe he is mocking Bruce's age and loss of Robin.
DC_Cinematic,381ib4,BattleReadyPenguin,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:39:17 2015 UTC,But then there's this tattoo.
DC_Cinematic,381ib4,flerx,2,Sun Jun 7 13:09:17 2015 UTC,In the beginning I thought that the tattoos on the joker was his way of breaking the 4th wall since the comic book character broke the 4th wall a few times. It sounds dumb but that was one of the firs things that popped in my head after seeing the release of the photo. I dont expect the joker to talk to the audience during the suicide squad movie.
DC_Cinematic,381ib4,Jkbdm,4,Mon Jun 1 19:52:08 2015 UTC,"""I had faith in Snyder"" Snyder isn't directing SS."
DC_Cinematic,381ib4,JeremyIsSpecial,-1,Mon Jun 1 07:34:57 2015 UTC,"He's not, but the general assumption is that Snyder is basically DC's defacto Feige since WB won't create an official analogue.   He's the one determining the general tonal and visual direction of all DCU films because he was in charge of bringing the big DC characters to the screen in the post Nolan landscape.  The previous assumption (based on rumors and leaked emails) was that WB was asleep at the wheel allowing all directors to make the movie they were going to make without considerations to the other movies (tone, visuals, fitting stories together). But when Affleck showed up on the SS set and that Batman footage with the joker using the same BvS suit, that kind of dispelled the belief that WB was being apathetic and confirming that this is more or less the DC Snyderverse.  I still think the ""damaged"" tattoo in really clean calligraphic cursive is fucking dumb.  I just hope the performance is good."
DC_Cinematic,381ib4,XAL53,-6,Mon Jun 1 07:48:36 2015 UTC,""" Snyder is basically DC's defacto Feige""  That's a pretty big assumption.  Batman showing up has more to do with the fact that SS is full of Batman villains including the Joker than anything else.  ""really clean calligraphic cursive""  I'm not a fan of the tattoo but I think they actually chose a decent typeface."
DC_Cinematic,381ib4,JeremyIsSpecial,6,Mon Jun 1 08:14:58 2015 UTC,"Not really that big an assumption, seeing as how he directed both Man of Steel and BvS, is slated to direct Justice League 1 and 2, is executive-producing Suicide Squad and is listed as a producer on Wonder Woman. While it hasn't been officially confirmed by anyone, anyone talking about it has said that Snyder is the closest thing to a Feige-figure the DCCU has.  I don't think Snyder mandated that Batman appear in Suicide Squad because IT'S ALL CONNECTED, but to ignore his hand in everything they have going on right now is pretty short-sighted."
DC_Cinematic,381ib4,JimmyBing,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:45:58 2015 UTC,"I don't like comparing Snyder to people over at Marvel, but If I had too, I think he is more of a mixture of Feige-and-Whedon. Snyder is creating a world , and creating characters that people will eventually will jump in and sort of work around what he has established. Obviously, because of this he will work as a consultant to keep it some-what balanced.   I don't think Snyder mandated that Batman appear in Suicide Squad because IT'S ALL CONNECTED, but to ignore his hand in everything they have going on right now is pretty short-sighted.   Absolutely. There is also no way, Snyder wasn't involved in some capacity with the casting of The Joker, and Harley Quinn. I think also safe to assume that was also involved with the appearances and characterizations - Maybe not so much the latter, because Ayer is writing but still very possible. Factor in The Batmans in Suicide Squad , you best believe he had something to say about how they would use him."

DC_Cinematic,3802rx,Huntersteve,5,Sun May 31 21:17:05 2015 UTC,"One of the first ""leaks"" back when the movie was announced was that there would be a scene of him watching it. This rumor is very old"
DC_Cinematic,3802rx,King-Grimm,3,Mon Jun 1 02:37:53 2015 UTC,"Haha I remember when the film was announced, an image (fan made) of Batman infront of  his computers in the batcave staring at the message being passed around - and some sites were calling it 'concept art (it was good though). People were going nuts over this.   Edit: Found it - http://media.comicbook.com/uploads1/2014/06/batman-vs-superman-man-of-steel-2-101599.jpg"
DC_Cinematic,3802rx,decrepidactyl,9,Mon Jun 1 20:35:22 2015 UTC,I had previously noticed that there were flashing lights on his face as though he were looking at a screen or something. My theory was that he was watching a news report about Superman's latest activities and then it might cut to him suiting up to go confront Supes.
DC_Cinematic,3802rx,PurpleZion,8,Sun May 31 21:24:19 2015 UTC,I don't think he'll see one news report and decide to suit up. One of the earlier set footage leaked showed Bruce saving a girl in what appears to be a destroyed part of Gotham. Another leak showed Bruce (in the same clothes as the scene above) in a car chase driving towards a blockage created by destroyed cars and making a u turn so some things are gonna happen in the movie to make him decide to finally confront Superman.
DC_Cinematic,3802rx,invisiblack,6,Sun May 31 21:35:24 2015 UTC,Or that destroyed wayne building is in Metropolis.
DC_Cinematic,3802rx,MiQBonafide,4,Sun May 31 22:58:33 2015 UTC,"Iirc they were shooting in Detroit at that time, which seems to be the city they are using as Gotham. It might just be a flashback to before Metropolis was rebuilt like you said.   Edit: Does anyone know which city was used as the set for Metropolis in Man of Steel?"
DC_Cinematic,3802rx,invisiblack,5,Sun May 31 23:41:49 2015 UTC,Chicago. It has the honor of being both Gotham (TDK trilogy) and Metropolis (DCCU).
DC_Cinematic,3802rx,LordCommanderStark,3,Mon Jun 1 00:36:57 2015 UTC,Did they shoot for BvS there in Chicago? If they did its fair to assume that the leaked footage from Detroit is set in Gotham.   Edit: Forgot about the teaser where Chicago was used as Metropolis.
DC_Cinematic,3802rx,invisiblack,6,Mon Jun 1 00:43:30 2015 UTC,"They did some shooting in Chicago, yes. I think some set pics with Henry Cavill in the flying harness and holding Amy Adams got leaked."
DC_Cinematic,3802rx,LordCommanderStark,3,Mon Jun 1 00:44:50 2015 UTC,"So Chicago = Metropolis and Detroit = Gotham, which means the scene where Bruce saves the girl from the wreckage is probably Gotham."
DC_Cinematic,3802rx,invisiblack,4,Mon Jun 1 00:50:34 2015 UTC,Unless Gotham gets wrecked at some point in BvS...
DC_Cinematic,3802rx,LordCommanderStark,5,Mon Jun 1 00:52:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Last year when I saw the leaked set footage I assumed it was a flashback to Metropolis at the end of MoS, but now I think there will be another incident in BvS that ends up wrecking parts of Gotham which triggers Batman to go after Superman."
DC_Cinematic,3802rx,invisiblack,4,Mon Jun 1 01:01:47 2015 UTC,"Also, Lexcorp, emergency services vehicles with ""Metropolis"" on them were seen in Detroit.  Gotham CityPD was also seen in Detroit.   Detroit was used for Gotham, Metropolis, and Washington DC. Chicago was probably used for the Metropolis skyline."
DC_Cinematic,3802rx,MiQBonafide,3,Mon Jun 1 01:14:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm just saying this one report will be the last straw, so to speak. Maybe he had been doing research on Supes after the Metropolis incident and while debating with Alfred on whether or not to act, he sees the news report or something."
DC_Cinematic,3802rx,PurpleZion,3,Mon Jun 1 00:44:45 2015 UTC,This is my favorite part of the trailer. That look. That's a man with demons.
DC_Cinematic,3802rx,TriggerHippie77,3,Mon Jun 1 16:26:57 2015 UTC,"Affleck? That's Bruce Wayne, bitches!  This was also my favorite part of the trailer. The composition and lighting in this shot are perfect. The weary and feral gaze accompanied with Alfred monologue, makes me love this shot even more. There is quite a bit going on here."
DC_Cinematic,3802rx,decrepidactyl,2,Mon Jun 1 18:50:01 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who thought it was light reflecting off of shimmering water? Wouldn't be the first time the batcave had aquatic features.
DC_Cinematic,3802rx,tat55,2,Mon Jun 1 04:17:02 2015 UTC,It's flickering a bit too fast to be shimmering water.
DC_Cinematic,3802rx,matito29,2,Tue Jun 2 03:15:42 2015 UTC,It does kind of look like there are reflections of a tv screen in his pupils.
DC_Cinematic,3802rx,TrashTongueTalker,2,Mon Jun 1 06:02:12 2015 UTC,My theory is that it was Zod message what made him wear the cape again.
DC_Cinematic,3802rx,KingofZombies,2,Mon Jun 1 16:48:33 2015 UTC,The lights on his face look like reflecting light from a pool.
DC_Cinematic,3802rx,Pinched_Turd,2,Mon Jun 1 17:11:03 2015 UTC,"Ill go back and forth with this one :  If you notice in the trailer, when it immediately closes in on the bat-suit, to the left there is definitely someone [Bruce] standing there. - Made a gif and Screenshot.  I know trailers could be misleading, so that is why I am not totally dismissing that it is the message. The light flickering is only prominent to the right side of his face - and where his mouth is, where the shadow starts looks pretty straight (and squared off), so it could very well be a monitor of sorts. - OR It could be a fire place.  Could Bruce be looking at Zod's message to earth? Yeah, I guess. Deep down,I kind of don't want Zack & Co to spend a lot of time with Bruce's flashbacks. - even thought it would be pretty cool."
DC_Cinematic,384o0h,Caprimelon,5,Mon Jun 1 20:49:24 2015 UTC,It looks exactly like Batman  Anyone who thinks otherwise needs to reduce hype levels

Saving him for something like Man of Steel 3 or something. its too early to bring him in and if they go down the whole route of him 'killing' superman, they should do that at a later stage.  I personally feel they could introduce Bizarro in Batman V Superman; Lex could have been experimenting on Zods body and Supermans DNA hence Bizarro. That would be cool and give Batman and Superman a reason to team up. Could also explain a bit of the conflict between Batman and Superman."

His performance on The Big Bang Theory of a disgustingly ridiculous portrayal of a hardcore nerd with social issues is an insult to those who consider themselves engulfed in many things not considered normal/cool/etc. I don't think he deserved any awards for acting (especially on The Big Bang Theory) as his acting spectrum covers less ground than Nicholas Cage. Also The Big Bang Theory is not funny at all."

It would've been announced one way or another beforehand.  The rest was pretty much just folks in costume.  But maybe I missed some shots/videos"
DC_Cinematic,37xlif,Come_mai,8,Sun May 31 06:30:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Affleck's name sells tickets, so that was never going to be kept a secret."
DC_Cinematic,37xlif,S0ckHeaven,6,Sun May 31 06:36:10 2015 UTC,"Well you're probably right. Like Ayer says, the biggest spoilers are going to be kept secret a bit better."
DC_Cinematic,37xlif,lame_corprus,4,Sun May 31 06:47:01 2015 UTC,"It also sounds like they're also going to be on a closed set from now on. So it won't be in a public place, where there's no way to 100% prevent civilian/new crews from taking pictures/video. That's going to help a lot to keep the spoilers from getting leaked."

DC_Cinematic,37vd86,ninjartist,3,Sat May 30 21:22:40 2015 UTC,"Alright, now that I have finished it. The dialogue was a tad wonky quite, and I felt the pacing wasn't great. It dragged at some points, but I did find the very beginning and end events were tied in nicely.It's weird, there are points in the script where they nailed some character traits, and than a few minutes later you may find yourself think ""Huh, that's fucking stupid"".   The Flash is more or less helping tell this story, with Batman thrown in there to tell the missing pieces. Wonder Women get some decent time, but other than that,I felt the rest of the League isn't really given much to do.  The villain Maxwell Lord ? Yeah,I guess he is the villain. I thought he was written the weakest, and definitely did not feel he was a threat, let alone for the Justice League. Talia is in here too, whatever, didn't really care for her too much. Some of my favorite parts, were with Bruce/Batman and Alfred in the cave. That, to me felt really natural and a great to read.   I got to be honest, I thought Justice League : Doom handled it wayyy better than any of this. That said, I enjoyed reading the script, and liked thinking about what could have come from this. There is definitely some parts that you can pick out of this script and use it, so I wouldn't be surprised if some scenes/lines surface later on.   I tried not spoiling it, because it is a good read.

My thoery is that it will be established that Themyscira appeared out of nowhere shortly after the events of Man of Steel, and maybe imply that it was the World Engine that disabled it's invisibility field, phase shifter, or whatever was keeping it hidden technological, or magic.  Also she won't be using a secret identity.  She may wait to reveal her powers, but she will always present herself as Princess Diana ambassador of Themyscira.  With Aquaman I'm also doubting these rumors that Lex will be gathering metahumans.  Everything about the trailer seems to imply that Superman is still the only known Metahuman.  I've got a thoery that this movie is actually going to weave in a lot of news footage, and I think we'll get out first peak at Aquaman during a segment about a mysterious terrorist organization attacking fishing boats.  I've got a theory about Aquaman actually playing a big role in Wonder Woman's solo film so it would actually set that up really well if at the end of this one we get a scene of Aquaman sailing towards Themyscira while ominous music plays.  Cyborg you might be right about him not getting his powers yet in this movie, but I'm betting that we'll see him get caught in the crossfires of one of the big fights in this movie then rushed off somewhere to save his life.  Maybe there will be a quick peak of Flash but personally I hope neither him nor Green Lantern get any mention in this movie."

DC_Cinematic,37r7xl,decrepidactyl,3,Fri May 29 22:35:34 2015 UTC,"Alright, just for clarification. I witnessed both posts get removed. Spoiler (I guess?) Batman's involvement with the Suicide Squad is considered a spoiler, and off limits in titles?. So, if he is not in any promotional/official material/and or credited officially for the movie, his [character] name can't be posted in regards to being associated with said movie? Considering of how small of a role he will have, I am going to say there is a big chance he won't be (at least not in trailers or photos). Until than, we just go dark about and be as vague as possible?"
DC_Cinematic,37s9rj,letsgetweirdkbye,20,Fri May 29 23:51:51 2015 UTC,Ben Affleck. He has a pretty diverse style. I have no doubt that he would be able to dish out a great Bat-flick. Throw in The Riddler as the villain - and that's it. Keep it close and intimate.
DC_Cinematic,37s9rj,decrepidactyl,9,Sat May 30 03:17:42 2015 UTC,I feel like Ben Affleck should direct his Batman solo movie.

DC_Cinematic,37s9rj,frank_abernathy,9,Mon Jun 1 00:28:08 2015 UTC,Seeing as Joseph Kosinski is no longer going to be busy doing Tron 3:-( DC should snatch him up to direct Green Lantern.    I'd love to see the Chad Stahelski & David Leitch do something for DC. John Wick had some of the best action I've ever seen in a film. I think they'd be good for a Green Arrow/Black Canary or Nightwing/Oracle movie.
DC_Cinematic,37s9rj,decrepidactyl,1 point,Sat May 30 03:18:22 2015 UTC,Yes! These are awesome choices! Sad times about Tron 3 but now I'm hoping what you said comes true haha and man I really wanted the John Wick guys for a Red Hood movie I am all for Nightwing coming to the big screen. I think they signed on to do the Bloodshot films for Sony though so :(
DC_Cinematic,37s9rj,YoureASoldierBodie,7,Sat May 30 03:27:22 2015 UTC,After seeing Mad Max I would love if George Miller took a shot. I haven't seen any of his other films aside from Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior AFAIK but MM was such a breath of fresh air.

DC_Cinematic,37s9rj,dc_fanboyforever,2,Sat May 30 06:11:49 2015 UTC,"He went missing on Pandora but I would like to watch something from James Cameron in DCCU. And NOT Aquaman!! Maybe Cyborg. Thats somewhat close to him.  And though he more or less turned to the TV, but I think he could do a good DC movie. Frank Darabont. His latter work on TV is questionable but I still thinks hes a good director."
DC_Cinematic,37s9rj,huskman,0,Sat May 30 10:02:04 2015 UTC,Nice entourage reference! Haha I'd love to see him join the DCCU but it's taken him like 6 years for avatar 2! I'd worry if he did cyborg it would come out in like 2025! And good call with darabont I actually thought the first season of walking dead is easily the best season!
DC_Cinematic,37s9rj,dc_fanboyforever,2,Sat May 30 16:29:48 2015 UTC,I think we need Tyler Perry should direct Cyborg.  /s
DC_Cinematic,37s9rj,huskman,2,Sat May 30 14:58:21 2015 UTC,Thats a great idea....
DC_Cinematic,37s9rj,thatrguynamedtrevor,2,Sat May 30 22:04:09 2015 UTC,Wes Anderson directed Aquaman. So much.

DC_Cinematic,37s9rj,thatrguynamedtrevor,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:07:52 2015 UTC,Nicholas Winding Refn for Aquaman. Ben Affleck for Batman. Chris Nolan for Flash.
DC_Cinematic,37s9rj,gbm0102,2,Sat May 30 04:16:08 2015 UTC,I'd love to have Refn involved with the DCCU. A lot of people hate on it but Drive is by and far one of my favorite movies. That eighties aesthetic in a DC movie could be great
DC_Cinematic,37s9rj,thatrguynamedtrevor,1 point,Sat May 30 07:35:29 2015 UTC,Exactly! Refn's directing and finesse for cinematography would be fantastic for Aquaman and displaying Atlantis.

DC_Cinematic,37s9rj,legopieface,0,Sat May 30 04:43:39 2015 UTC,I agree. But if someone is telling him the general storyline to go by and the theme of the universe he would be more than capable.
DC_Cinematic,37s9rj,Csantana,2,Sat May 30 12:35:47 2015 UTC,So basically as long as he doesn't write it.
DC_Cinematic,37sevy,Bodie293,5,Sat May 30 00:35:01 2015 UTC,"What about Hippolyta? Maybe too close to her Watchmen role, being the mother of the female protagonist."

DC_Cinematic,37rq9e,BattleReadyPenguin,14,Fri May 29 21:19:42 2015 UTC,They'll definitely cover the first and third points. The trailer made that perfectly clear.
DC_Cinematic,37rq9e,gbm0102,8,Fri May 29 21:40:44 2015 UTC,"Bats will definitely use the events. I am  like 97% sure we can see Batman in his armored suit inspecting the rubble in what looks to be in the same building where Zod died. Also, the exterior shots of Batman and Superman (what looks to be the beginning od the fight), looks to also be the same building. Comparison Architect : BvS Man Of steel  Batman should be skeptic, and should want to learn more about Superman. He will teach him a lesson, but in no do I think Bats should be anti-Super man."
DC_Cinematic,37rq9e,decrepidactyl,5,Fri May 29 23:01:35 2015 UTC,I think its also assumed by many fans that Batman will come up with some form of Kryptonite. Perhaps he studies the fight scenes in MOS to see how Superman was weakened by the Kryptonian environment. Maybe he's able to determine exactly what in that environment weakens Superman and concentrate it into Kryptonite form.
DC_Cinematic,37rq9e,talllankywhiteboy,5,Sat May 30 01:59:40 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I have no idea where I stand on this. I want Bruce to be intelligent as fuck, but I am not too sure there is enough evidence for Bruce to synthesize Kryptonite so early on in the game. I mean it could work,it all depends how Zack & Chris handle it.Considering this Superman is not as powerful as his comic counterpart, I kind of hope they just use a nuke (possibly Russian) of sorts, to de-power Supes, and just keep it at that."
DC_Cinematic,37rq9e,decrepidactyl,2,Sat May 30 02:57:58 2015 UTC,"There were the two giant battlefields from Man of Steel filled with potential evidence. I think with a flashback or two they could easily establish Batman's discovery. Plus, Batman uses a single sentence in the Red Son comics to deduce Superman's red sun weakness, so its not like there isn't precedent.  And maybe Batman doesn't make his Kryptonite strong enough to kill Superman, but just weak enough so that he can be taken down in a fight. Later we could have Lex concentrating the Kryptonite for a more classic comic approach.   The nuke thing seems like a bit much to me. The movie is already going to be jam packed with characters, I don't think there would be the proper time available to explain a nuke going off."
DC_Cinematic,37rq9e,talllankywhiteboy,3,Sat May 30 03:24:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I am conflicted. It wouldn't be hard to establish that Bruce, can in fact come up with it. Also, we see in the trailer that Supes is holding what looks to be a Russian satellite (that doesn't look like a nuke), but what if that satellite is a red herring.   We can do this all day, everyday.We don't know how intelligent Bruce is going to be - I just don't want Bruce/Batman to be OP as he comes off in some books. (I doubt this will be the case)"
DC_Cinematic,37rq9e,decrepidactyl,1 point,Sat May 30 03:38:28 2015 UTC,"He could work with genius billionaire Lex Luthor, perhaps? I mean, they both have a common enemy.   Also, I'd like to see Lex transition into a villain. I hope he's a genuine philanthropist kinda like Bruce at the beginning."
DC_Cinematic,37rq9e,DerringerHK,5,Mon Jun 1 01:12:58 2015 UTC,"You think it was a coincidence that the Wayne satellite was right over the fight , almost like he was watching ?"
DC_Cinematic,37rq9e,reece1495,6,Sat May 30 15:07:38 2015 UTC,I think if Scoot Mcnairy ends up being Bruce Wayne's right hand man (those set photos with the green leggings) and lost his legs due to the events of MoS it'll make the destruction extremely personal for Batman. I think you're definitely on to something!

And of course they aren't, we have Cyborg, not Hawkgirl (fingers crossed!!!) but I'm saying if they went with Stewart it would make more sense to go with Wally as well, I may be wrong of course, but I am almost certain they will go with Hal Jordan.

DC_Cinematic,37mqao,MrCatEater,1 point,Sat May 30 10:16:07 2015 UTC,"I like the animated series a lot, but I really wish they went with the original seven. I understand that they needed Stewart and Shayera to make it not a green guy a chick and 5 white guys. It especially annoyed me that Aquaman wasn't in it, since he always gets shafted. But it also allows them to distance themselves from the comics a bit, just a shame... Of course I love Cyborg! But I will never see him as a founder of Justice League."
DC_Cinematic,37mqao,gbm0102,6,Sat May 30 15:00:19 2015 UTC,Honestly? I think he's playing a supporting character who heads the military unit guarding the squad. I don't think he's playing Nightwing or Robin.
DC_Cinematic,37mqao,IIIISuperDudeIIII,3,Thu May 28 21:14:30 2015 UTC,"He was apparently offered the role of Steve Trevor, or a recurring role in Suicide Squad. I think that leaves Deathstroke in the running, since they haven't announced who's playing him yet, and there were rumors of a Deathstroke standalone movie in the works a bit ago."
DC_Cinematic,37mqao,gbm0102,3,Thu May 28 23:12:45 2015 UTC,Jim Parrack is rumored to be Deathstroke.
DC_Cinematic,37mqao,KidK0dy,5,Fri May 29 00:15:42 2015 UTC,I want him to be Nightwing so bad. He would be so perfect. We already know from pictures that Batman goes undercover; why couldnt nightwing be undercover too?

DC_Cinematic,37j80g,invisiblack,1 point,Fri May 29 06:08:45 2015 UTC,Justice League  animated series also had an Amanda Waller

DC_Cinematic,37j80g,Jangwin,5,Fri May 29 15:59:07 2015 UTC,Amanda Waller is some doctor in GL. She's head of ARGUS in SS.
DC_Cinematic,37j80g,Justice_Prince,3,Thu May 28 03:51:51 2015 UTC,people get promotions I guess.
DC_Cinematic,37j80g,Justice_Prince,4,Thu May 28 05:27:59 2015 UTC,"Well let's just put the quality of the movie to the side for a bit.  Just look at it from a continuity standpoint.  Man of Steel started with establishing Superman as the first known superhero.  Now like Batman GL could already exist, but GL's exploits in that movie were a bit too public to have happened before Man of Steel.  I guess maybe we could say the GL movie happened after MoS, but I think they treated him as the first hero in his movie as well."
DC_Cinematic,37j80g,Justice_Prince,2,Thu May 28 05:37:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah I figured the ""first contact"" plot would be the real deal breaker with making it fit. I'm not even invested in making the movie fit in, I just rewatched it recently and it got me thinking about the ""why not""s"
DC_Cinematic,37j80g,your_mind_aches,3,Thu May 28 06:06:37 2015 UTC,Other then recasting there probably won't be much stopping you from imagining that the movie is connected.  If you really wanted to you could probably imagine the Schumacher Batman films take place in the same universe as well.
DC_Cinematic,37j80g,JeremyIsSpecial,2,Thu May 28 06:19:25 2015 UTC,"If you apply the multiverse then really anything could be canon ha. I'm most definitely not trying to shoehorn GL into the new movie-verse, I'm not even a fan of the movie, it was really just curiosity that got me thinking about this."
DC_Cinematic,37j80g,BaltimoreProud,2,Thu May 28 06:30:24 2015 UTC,If you apply the multiverse    Here's hoping Barry Allen and Barry Allen can make this happen.
DC_Cinematic,37j80g,BaltimoreProud,3,Fri May 29 06:11:03 2015 UTC,They don't want to base their cinematic universe off a film nobody liked.
DC_Cinematic,37j80g,your_mind_aches,7,Thu May 28 04:06:46 2015 UTC,"For the same reason the Nolan movies aren't going to be canon.  This is a different story and a different universe so it would be a bad idea to cast a GL and then be required to follow the canon set up by the 2011 movie.  And the fact, like you mention, is that it was so universally despised.  Plus you have Ryan Reynolds working on Deadpool with Fox, so it just makes sense to scrap the 2011 movie and start fresh.  Plus for all we know, GL in this universe could be John Stewart."
DC_Cinematic,37j80g,PKAwesome,3,Thu May 28 00:59:53 2015 UTC,"yeah I gotcha, that makes total sense and I don't really disagree with you, my original post was just trying to open up discussion a bit.   What do you think the odds are of them bringing Mark Strong or other Lantern characters back from the first film, even with it being a complete reboot? DC seems to be willing to ""recycle"" actors into their different properties like they have with Brandon Routh and Chin Han. Hopefully they can use a bit of the Oa groundwork for the next installment because that seemed to be the least problematic part of the 2011 film (effects aside)."
DC_Cinematic,37j80g,your_mind_aches,2,Thu May 28 01:06:42 2015 UTC,"Probably next to nil.  Again, it's important to differentiate your new movie from past failures.  It's why Andrew Garfield is being re-cast as Spider-Man.  He wasn't the problem with the first two ASM movies, but you don't want to run the risk of confusing your audience.  Same thing with any sort of leading role like Mark Strong's."
DC_Cinematic,37j80g,gbm0102,2,Thu May 28 01:13:32 2015 UTC,"It'll be interesting if the rumors of J.K Simmons reprising his role as JJJ in the new franchise prove to be true. I know what you mean about general audiences and confusion, its a shame to see good casting go to waste. I'm all for a young Peter Parker but I definitely think Garfield was a standout in the ASM movies."
DC_Cinematic,37j80g,BaltimoreProud,1 point,Thu May 28 01:18:45 2015 UTC,Yeah it's not like TV Flash where the actors reprising their roles are doing so 15 years later. I really want JK Simmons in the new Spidey though.
DC_Cinematic,37j80g,decrepidactyl,1 point,Fri May 29 06:12:25 2015 UTC,"There's no real reason not to bring him back, he'll look exactly the same as the comic and exactly the same as he did 8 years ago."
DC_Cinematic,37j80g,your_mind_aches,1 point,Fri May 29 17:20:32 2015 UTC,Look at the parent comment though. Confusing the viewers. That's the reason.
DC_Cinematic,37j80g,S0ckHeaven,2,Sat May 30 02:32:36 2015 UTC,"The film was a complete failure critically and commercially (the budget alone was $200). It also stands out like a sore thumb against the kind of atmosphere that DC seems to be creating for its cinematic universe. Aesthetically, it just doesn't fit. It doesn't hurt that DC and Warner Bros. would probably prefer if the film were forgotten."
DC_Cinematic,37j80g,mrthewhite,3,Thu May 28 01:04:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah it is definitely much different tonally, I do expect the DCCU GL to be a bit lighter than Batman, but still in a cohesive way."
DC_Cinematic,37j80g,your_mind_aches,0,Thu May 28 01:09:13 2015 UTC,"That movie is the only superhero blu-ray purchase I regret making, and I think I only paid $5 for it at a Going-out-of-Business sale the Blockbuster near me was having.  Isn't really any redeeming quality to that film at all."
DC_Cinematic,37m1m8,Coldplayer42,6,Thu May 28 16:40:20 2015 UTC,"That's a very vague question. I mean, we only have a small bit of production to go on, knowing nothing about the script. But based on casting, interviews from actors, production photos and leaked videos, I'd say yes, he's doing very well. But even that's a premature statement until we at least know the story, let alone see the actual film."
DC_Cinematic,37m1m8,gbm0102,3,Thu May 28 16:43:17 2015 UTC,"I agree, completely. Now, do I trust Ayer to do a good job (which is yes), is entirely different.But seriously,If I am not mistaken, according to their schedule, Ayer will be filming in Toronto (Studio shoots included) right up until the end of August. The leaked public set photos/videos are so small when in comes to the big picture. People making major judgments on some of these unofficial releases are being a bit childish as far as I am concerned (not directed at OP)."
DC_Cinematic,37ig4i,Iamtrawk,9,Wed May 27 21:36:37 2015 UTC,"Why Jason? To me it'd make more sense if he was Dick, not that he really resembles him, but if Dick is ""dead"" in BvS then maybe he is actually just undercover at ARGUS as agent Grayson."
DC_Cinematic,37ig4i,grntplmr,4,Wed May 27 21:50:48 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, what makes you guys think that Eastwood is playing either Dick or Jason? According to Variety, Eastwood's role in Suicide Squad is a supporting role, and it looks like he's simply playing a high profile member of the military that is guarding the squad."
DC_Cinematic,37ig4i,gbm0102,3,Wed May 27 23:00:25 2015 UTC,"I don't really think he'll be either, I was just going off of OP's theory and figured that Dick would be more likely than Jason."
DC_Cinematic,37ig4i,grntplmr,1 point,Wed May 27 23:06:50 2015 UTC,Agent Grayson is a bit too new a story line to be adapted into live film.
DC_Cinematic,37ig4i,huskman,5,Wed May 27 22:54:38 2015 UTC,you mean for the sake of spoiling the books or is there another reason?
DC_Cinematic,37ig4i,grntplmr,3,Wed May 27 23:07:38 2015 UTC,Not enough content I think. That and I'm still more inclined to think of Dick as Nightwing more than an Spyral agent. Also I wouldn't be surprised if somehow Dick went back to being Nightwing within the next five years.
DC_Cinematic,37ig4i,huskman,3,Thu May 28 02:00:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm not even sure it'll be that long, I think the bones of the story could work though in a movie adaptation, especially a non Batman movie. Even if Dick is undercover only briefly with Argus and returns to being Nightwing in future Bat movies."
DC_Cinematic,37ig4i,grntplmr,3,Thu May 28 02:02:12 2015 UTC,Maybe he will end up being GL.
DC_Cinematic,37ig4i,S0ckHeaven,2,Thu May 28 00:45:07 2015 UTC,He won't be anyone important. Him being some military guy has been heavily rumored.

DC_Cinematic,37hbw1,dc_fanboyforever,0,Wed May 27 21:24:57 2015 UTC,"I actually have a whole trilogy (with room for more movies) that I'd like to see.  I know the origin has been done, so I'd like something like the Animated Series, that just dumps you into the action. I like the idea of Emerald Twilight combined with elements of Rebirth to have a happier ending and setup (especially if we'll know Hal from the JL movies) for future movies. Coast City could be destroyed in JL causing Hal to be possessed by Parallax and Kyle can be recruited by Ganthet and John/Guy/Whoever to stop him from destroying the Corps. Kyle is bonded with Ion to un-possess him. Then meet the Parallax entity. Sinestro stays green, but it's clear he's tempted by Parallax and fear and we get an idea about where his story is going.  The second would be the Manhunters returning and attacking Korugar, and Sinestro becoming a dictator to defend it. At the end the Guardians banish him to Qward, and in the post credits scene, the Weaponers make him the first Yellow ring (obviously this would be built up to over the course of the two films).  The third film would of course be Sinestro Corps War.  Throughout the trilogy we would be introduced to some (but not too much) of the modern GL mythos. For example: the concept of the emotional spectrum throughout the first two, and the beginnings of it in the third; and maybe hint at Black and White Lanterns. I know it sounds weird but Ultraviolet Lanterns could be cool too."

DC_Cinematic,37i2cf,TheTjTerror,4,Thu May 28 03:03:35 2015 UTC,"He is one of the least-known members of the Squad. I don't have much to support my theory besides that. I just looked him and El Diablo up on various wikis and Slipknot's only notable appearance seems to have been during Flashpoint.  Captain Boomerang is a major Flash rogue. Perhaps one of his most famous. I think they'll save him for the Flash solo movie.  Deadshot: Never mind that he's Floyd freakin' Lawton, he's played by Will Smith. Survivor.  Killer Croc: Huge Batman nemesis and probably known to a larger set of fans due to his appearances in B:TAS and the Arkham games.  Harley Quinn: Mistah J wouldn't be happy, puddin'.  It's not much to go on, I'll admit, but I think we can reasonably assume it'll be him or El Diablo unless Ayer wants to fuck with the fans' expectations."
DC_Cinematic,37i2cf,rustedmachines,2,Thu May 28 03:49:01 2015 UTC,"I see. I heard someone say that they think El Diablo will survive the bomb due to his powers. So, I'll guess Slipknot."

DC_Cinematic,37df2c,Justice_Prince,3,Wed May 27 03:26:52 2015 UTC,"You're right, they don't need Enchantress to tell the story, I didn't realize my comment came off that way. I merely meant that Enchantress being apart of the DCCU can be a way of introducing other characters - Deadman,Etrigan,Madame Xanadu,Zatanna (Justice League Dark sort of thing)  etc. Or even the idea of her can help with the transformation of Billy Batson to Shazam or Jason Blood to Etrigan.  I get what you mean by ""magic is just unexplained science"", but really, you don't need to explain shit. They can drop names ( Dzamor) and hints (Terror Castle). This is not an origin story, it is a team up,and I would rather them not waste time on that sort of thing.DC has quite a bit of characters that are magic users,and personally as a fan,I would love to see them utilized."
DC_Cinematic,37df2c,decrepidactyl,3,Wed May 27 03:53:02 2015 UTC,"Wasn't really accusing you of coming off anyway.  What I was getting at is that before the Enchantress casting was announced it was widely speculated that Dark Universe would be separate from the DCCU, and they would find a non-magical way to explain Wonder Woman's origin.  With Enchantress being in Suicide Squad it seems like a pretty indication that they're going to fully embracy the magical side of the universe rather then cop-out of it the way Marve has so far."
DC_Cinematic,37df2c,Justice_Prince,6,Wed May 27 04:10:16 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, I remember that. Now with the back and forth with Guillermo del Toro, it is killing me. I would fucking love a Justice League Dark film...let alone anything from the 'Dark Universe'.  I absolute agree, I found Marvel so far have been sort of half assing their magic side of things as of late.Doc Strange is coming out next year, so I can't wait for that - Which is why I (maybe Kevin Feige said it) believe they opted not to use Adam Warlock in Guardians,because they want to introduce Strange as the first magic use in the universe.   Say what you want about DC , they are taking risks, and right off the bat too. This is what has me excited and really curious about what they will do with Enchantress, and for what could come out of it."
DC_Cinematic,37df2c,decrepidactyl,7,Wed May 27 04:33:37 2015 UTC,Has anyone seen anything she's been in? Any idea what her acting ability is?
DC_Cinematic,37df2c,rustedmachines,5,Tue May 26 20:44:39 2015 UTC,"She'll be playing the Mermaids in Pan. That doesn't look like a deep role though(well... besides the deep water, of course...). She's mostly a Model, but I have faith she'll be able to transfer to acting really well. :-)"
DC_Cinematic,37df2c,redjc99,5,Tue May 26 21:34:57 2015 UTC,"She's actually more of an actress, she says she doesn't really care for the model side of herself. She uses her acting ability in her modeling."

Although my dream movie would be Waller, and Lex building teams separately. Waller bringing together a group of different superheroe, but ideally calling them something other then JLA, and Lex bringing together all the villains for his own team.  After that the three groups have a Trinity War showdown in the second film.  Maybe that's a bit too ambitious though."
DC_Cinematic,37cf04,demasx,7,Tue May 26 18:21:01 2015 UTC,"So this means he won't be in the film, since its already been cast and shooting? UNLESS he's throwing us a curve-ball, and he's playing coy to keep the plot under wraps. Either way, good stuff."

DC_Cinematic,37dn4c,HamsterChucker,7,Tue May 26 21:56:27 2015 UTC,"I just realized that since DCCU Batman is older, they can go straight to Nightwing, Red Hood, etc and deal with Robin stories via flashbacks instead of entire movies. That's very clever of DC if they intended that."
DC_Cinematic,37dn4c,Justice_Prince,8,Wed May 27 01:10:12 2015 UTC,"My hope is in BvS that Dick will already be Nightwing, Barbara will be stuck in a wheelchair, and Jason be thought to be dead.

DC_Cinematic,37dn4c,gbm0102,3,Wed May 27 03:31:02 2015 UTC,"Or maybe even save Tim for the second standalone Batman film, and focus on Red Hood, Nightwing, Barbara, and Batman in the first one. That way, there could be a nice fluid clarity to the larger story across the three films (I'm counting BvS, assuming the story rumors are true). The second standalone film could have Batman finally coming to terms with a new ""side kick"" following the Red Hood story, as Nightwing will probably be doing his own thing (potential standalone film for him, I'm hoping), and simply show up in Gotham following the appearance of Red Hood in the first film."

DC_Cinematic,37dn4c,Justice_Prince,2,Wed May 27 01:42:04 2015 UTC,They could even just put in an easter egg of a poster with her on it.  There's also a rumor of a talk show scene in BvS so they could make a quick mention of Zatanna putting on a show for the audience after Lois Lane's interview.

DC_Cinematic,37dn4c,yettiornot_hereIcome,1 point,Wed May 27 21:26:37 2015 UTC,"You're right, I hadn't realized that it had been dropped. I would say she should show up in the Cyborg solo movie. Zatanna's magic would be an excellent contrast to all of the technology that goes into Cyborg.  I guess that would mean that she wouldn't be in a solo project until after the Justice League movies.   Maybe you could slide her into the Wonder Woman movie, if there is a flash forward type of ending. I think it would be really cool if you have the set up for Justice League be introduced in the Wonder Woman movie and carry over into the JL. It could work, since she already knows both Bats and Supes from Dawn of Justice."

I think if they all showed up at once it would be a clusterfuck, but if they all appeared throughout the second Justice League movie it would be a nice touch. It sounds like a lot, but I imagine the second movie as a sort of Justice League Unlimited, after the solo movies after JL pt 1, we could see a whole bunch of new characters in the League, maybe even at the beginning the League is deciding on who to add among these and others? Or they could be introduced partially in the solo movies and hinted at the expansion of the League and in the second movie we see all of the new additions together, but with the focus on the main 8.  It's impossible, but I really do want to see all of the original JLA team in this universe."
DC_Cinematic,37dn4c,Justice_Prince,1 point,Wed May 27 21:34:00 2015 UTC,"I've got this theory that in order to compete with Infinity War DC is going to go for Trinity War as their JL2 movie.  Not particularly based off the comic other then the idea of three super teams fighting each other.  JLD isn't in play yet so in this version it will be Waller, and Lex independently making their own teams to take on the Justice League.  Lex makes his Legion of Doom, and I have my idea for the lineup, but that's a bit more dependent on what villains show up in the other movies.  After the Justice League refuses to work under ARGUS at the end of JL1 Waller spends the time in between the next few movies trying to build her own team.  Conceptually this is similar to the JLA in the New 52, but I think the lineup will be different, and they'll go by Checkmate instead.  This is what I was thinking for the lineup.   King - After the rest of the Justice League refuses to join ARGUS Cyborg sides with the group he was working for before JL1, and agrees to be the leader of Checkmate. Queen - With Mindway City showing up in Suicide Squad I think they're laying in some ground work to introduce Hawkgirl. Knight - In a way OMAC is kind of the Cyborg 2.0.  I don't think it will be that hard to lay some easter eggs in one of the other films that ARGUS is working on a sort of super soldier program. Bishop - Carried over from Suicide Squad I think they'll be putting Enchantress on this team. Rook - Maybe just an easter agg before hand, or maybe a small cameo, but I think they'll reveal that Martian Manhunter has actually been in government custody for some time now."

DC_Cinematic,379jqn,TheMurderCapitalist,2,Tue May 26 04:34:33 2015 UTC,Martian Manhunter doesn't have a huge rouges gallery as it is and you want Sean Bean to play the villain?
DC_Cinematic,379jqn,Justice_Prince,3,Tue May 26 04:33:48 2015 UTC,I say we port Duke of Deception over from Wonder Woman's rouges gallery.  If there's one thing that can outmatch a martian it's a martian demigod.
DC_Cinematic,379jqn,Iamtrawk,2,Tue May 26 18:37:35 2015 UTC,True he doesn't but for this one movie I think Ma'alefa'ak would be a great villain. I think Sean Bean showed in Lord of the rings he can pull off that dark side.

I was also thinking Aquaman would play a pretty substantial role in Wonder Woman's solo film so everyone kinda starts with team up films.    The question is though what would their team up film be about.  I've seen a few cool idea, but the one I came up with is that Lobo would be hired by The Preserver to capture Gorilla Grodd, and Flash & GL would bascially be trying to stop the villains from battleing it out across the city, and reduce the collateral damage."

Than I want an Etrigan stand alone. It's going to be a risky move ... but that doesn't matter here.  Set in the Medieval era/ Dark ages. Either a complete origin story of Jason Blood becoming Etrigan or an adaptation of Demon Knights, which I think may work better as a film, as there is quite a bit variety on the team.  Jon Hamm is the embodiment of Jason Blood. As for director, I really have no idea. I think because he is so obscure and one of my favorites, it's hard to pin-point.    Maybe someone here has an idea, on who should direct."

DC_Cinematic,3780ag,gbm0102,12,Tue May 26 01:18:27 2015 UTC,"FYI The tombstone picture IS NOT Dick Greyson's tombstone, it is his father's tombstone (Robin being Dick Jr, and his dad going by middle name John).   The tombstone in question clearly shows that this man died in 2000. Batman will have been operating for 20 years when Dawn of Justice, which opens in 2016, begins. This means Dick's parents died when Batman had been working alone for 4 years, lining up well with the timescale of him becoming Robin. Additionally, this would mean Dick is now in his late 20s, which again lines up perfectly for him to have left Batman and potentially become Nightwing, while Jason would have taken his place and gotten murdered by Joker (assuming the Dead Robin theories are true).  Not only would it make zero sense for this to be Dick's tomb when it would cut out potential DCCU opportunities for WB, but it would make no sense for Dick to have been the one to die when a whopping 3 Robins (if you count Spoiler pre-retcon) have actually died while in service. And as if that wasn't enough to make it obvious, the dates on the tombstone would mean that if this was Dick, he was practically Bruce's age, which is ridiculous."
DC_Cinematic,3780ag,Jangwin,2,Tue May 26 01:41:50 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the clarification.
DC_Cinematic,3780ag,grntplmr,2,Tue May 26 02:43:58 2015 UTC,"On top of all that, the picture of the tombstone is from a pretty sketchy source in the first place."

DC_Cinematic,3780ag,grntplmr,7,Mon May 25 18:18:14 2015 UTC,"Definitely, especially with SPIDEY coming back into the MCU as like a 15 year old or whatever... DC needs a badass teenager to root for. Robin/Nightwing has always been a fan favorite."
DC_Cinematic,3780ag,keeprollinrollinyo,3,Mon May 25 18:49:49 2015 UTC,"I'm really hoping for the whole lineage too, it doesn't have to be heavy handed exposition to show us that Dick, Jason, and Tim have all had the role, even the display cases being in the Batcave would let us know it is a legacy thing.   I don't know if I would make any Robin other than Damian as young as they plan to make Peter though. Someone in the 17-22 range is more what I picture when I think about Robin in the DCCU, but really it's all conjecture at this point anyway!"
DC_Cinematic,3780ag,AaronRoots427,1 point,Mon May 25 18:54:10 2015 UTC,i've always seen Robin as a teenager 15-19 and Nightwing as more of a college graduate type 22-27 but that's just me!

DC_Cinematic,3780ag,djcaselli,2,Mon May 25 18:51:49 2015 UTC,I honestly would be okay with this. I know he's signed a multi picture deal so I definitely think his role might be more important than expecting. It would be extremely disappointing if he really does just work for Argus and signed for more movies just to be included in the sequel for SS.
DC_Cinematic,3780ag,majorasmaskfan,3,Mon May 25 19:03:04 2015 UTC,Wait. Dick Grayson tombstones? I heard Robin would be dead but I was hoping it was Jason. Unless they bring him back and they just did it to retcon in Nightwing AND some serious Joker emotional fuel.
DC_Cinematic,3780ag,MuddFishh,2,Mon May 25 19:33:54 2015 UTC,I would love for Scott Eastwood to be Agent Grayson. Because we need Dick/nightwing/Grayson on the big screen. And done right i might add.

DC_Cinematic,378dwh,GentlemanGearGrinder,11,Mon May 25 18:42:04 2015 UTC,"The problem with the idea of SS being the villains for JL movie is, how do they compete with Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman etc?  They work as Batman Villains because he's human just like most of SS but none of them are strong enough (and most aren't smart enough) to go toe to toe with even one of the super powered JL, let a long a group of super powered JL."
DC_Cinematic,378dwh,mrthewhite,3,Mon May 25 18:55:18 2015 UTC,"I think you're giving the Squad a little too little credit. Enchantress can and has gone against Superman, thanks to his weakness to magic. Captain Boomerang is a tentpole Flash villain, fighting against him regularly. And as far as intelligent leadership goes, Amanda Waller has that in spades. However, I do see your point that the JL outclasses the SS overall. Perhaps, then, they could be a small part of a larger initiative against metahumans, such as Project Cadmus?"
DC_Cinematic,378dwh,mrthewhite,2,Mon May 25 19:34:51 2015 UTC,You have a point.  I think if they were one part of an attack that might work but then I worry how crowded the movie would become.
DC_Cinematic,378dwh,FlamingPanda77,3,Mon May 25 19:37:33 2015 UTC,"You could be right but I don't think the Suicide Squad is big enough to take on the Justice League. If it was Batman vs the Suicide Squad then it would feel more like a challenge for Batman. But against the whole JL.... it just doesn't seem like that big of a threat. So why is Suicide Squad there. I think it is there to set up many villains. BVS is a setup to JL and Batman. WW is obviously to set up Wonder Woman. And Man of Steel of course for Superman. So right there we have the Trinity all set up. Along those movies we will have backstory for some of the universe and heroes. I think SS will just be more of that backstory for the DCCU. But with villains. If we didn't have SS then we wouldn't have that many villains for the DCCU until later on in the universe. I think SS is set to release right after BVS to set up many of the villains and backstory in the DCCU very early on. The way WB is setting up there movies and Cinematic Universe is very smart. It also shows that they can set up a universe without having to do one hero movie at a time until the big team up. I think SS also shows that WB don't just care for the heroes in the DCCU but also the villains. Which is fantastic. Marvel lacks in the MCU good villains. The way they set movies up is only hero focused and they don't create that good of villains. Like they don't care for the villains even though villains are very important and can make a movie. Just look at TDK. So WB creating good and interesting villains and showing that they care for the villains also and not just the heroes, is a very very good thing. That's why I think SS is there and so early on to.  tl;dr...... Suicide Squad will set up interesting and good villains and provide some more backstory in the DCCU"
DC_Cinematic,378dwh,doyleb3620,3,Mon May 25 18:59:58 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but the fact is ""officially"" the SS doesn't have a future in the DC Universe right now. In the current slate of films, the only Squad member who has a chance to appear outside the JL movies is Captain Boomerang in Flash. And if DC is setting up the SS as interesting villains for the CU, why would they leave so little room for their return? It's the same concept that the Chekov's Gun principle is based around: something that is introduced at the start of a story must be put to use later. If we look at the DCCU as one large story told through several smaller ones, then we currently have no sensible point for the SS to return except one of the two JL movies. Having said that, you're right to say that the Squad isn't much of a match for the League now. However, with some narrative development, they -- or something larger spinning off from them -- could be a match in the future.  Or I could just be completely wrong. Who knows?"
DC_Cinematic,378dwh,krispness,3,Mon May 25 20:04:20 2015 UTC,"I would agree with you, but I think the Suicide Squad would be a little outclassed by the Justice League. I mean, the JL has four characters with godlike abilities and the Goddamn Batman, while the most powerful member of the SS is probably Enchantress (depending upon how powered they make her).   What could happen is the government forming a state-sanctioned Justice League of America. Maybe Metallo, Deathstroke, Reverse Flash, etc. are recruited by Uncle Sam to track down and defeat the Justice League.   While I don't see this happening in JL: Part One, I see it as a definite possibility for JL: Part Two, after more villains have been established in other films."
DC_Cinematic,378dwh,IwishIwasGoku,2,Mon May 25 19:00:16 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting take on things. Have the government spin off the SS into a group with more powerful beings. You could even go as far as making that the origin of the Secret Society, perhaps as a joint think-tank with Lexcorp."
DC_Cinematic,378dwh,JeremyIsSpecial,3,Mon May 25 19:44:29 2015 UTC,"that doesn't seem to fit with the larger than life portrayal of the characters. Suicide Squad isn't a full on justice league type of villain team. I'd much rather see Suicide Squad become DC's GotG, something comic book related that can move away from super powered goodiegoodies. I'd hope they're using SS in the same way to hint at the villain of the Justice League."
DC_Cinematic,378dwh,Justice_Prince,2,Mon May 25 19:38:24 2015 UTC,"Your idea is cool, but I don't think this squad can handle the Justice League. Even if they have Black Manta and Deathstroke I don't think any of them can even come close to handling Wonder Woman. Flash vs Boomerang might be a bit ridiculous in live action as well.   What I think will happen is Luthor will unleash some sort of Kryptonian tech in BvS and use it to fight (maybe it'll even be Brainiac but it could just be a battlesuit) and then at the end Batman will put the tech somewhere for safekeeping. Enter the Suicide Squad. They get the tech back and possibly cross paths with Bats at one point, and Waller starts fucking with it and creating..you guessed it, Doomsday. I expect he'll be the main JL villain but the Squad could definitely be involved. Maybe Batman and Cyborg will be dealing mostly with them while the heavy hitters handle Doomsday? You could still maintain all those themes you were talking about with a story like that."

DC_Cinematic,376f1c,LordCommanderStark,4,Mon May 25 09:38:12 2015 UTC,I really hope it is. The voice fits with the metal suit and it also fits with the idea of a man questioning a god. It also wouldn't make sense for them to trick us into thinking that was our first glimpse of the voice.
DC_Cinematic,376f1c,CobaltMoon98,2,Mon May 25 19:22:44 2015 UTC,I hope your right because I really don't like that approach with Batman.  I know he's usually arrogant but to me it suggests a cruel streak that I'm not a fan of.  As if he's more concerned with hurting superman than actually stopping him from doing what Batman perceives as endangering the city/world.

Now if they meet and Bruce is trying to recon the situation and gauge Clark's power, not actually beat him in a battle, then I would be a little more forgiving."
DC_Cinematic,376f1c,grntplmr,2,Mon May 25 18:30:52 2015 UTC,"my feeling exactly.  I already know that narratively it's not interesting if Superman beats the crap out of Batman so we know going in that at best it will be a stalemate or Batman will win but let him go.  I also find the ""Batgod"" as you put it to be a rather obnoxious interpretation of Batman."
DC_Cinematic,376f1c,mrthewhite,1 point,Mon May 25 19:06:53 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping that as the DCCU evolves they will delve more into the tactical support style Batman than the one who is so good he can go toe to toe with Darkseid and Doomsday. I don't want them to nerf the badguys just so Bruce can throw some punches, let him be more like how Hawkeye or Black Widow are in Avengers while the big fights are going on. He absolutely has his place within the Justice League, but I don't feel that it's punching superpowered beings in the face."
DC_Cinematic,376f1c,grntplmr,1 point,Tue May 26 07:07:44 2015 UTC,My thought was not so much that the line comes out of cruelty or anger. I think it is more questioning if he can even bleed since this is a situation that Bruce can't control so he wants to know the he could possibly control it at some point.
DC_Cinematic,3746jj,mrmazzz,10,Sun May 24 18:42:16 2015 UTC,"It bugs me when people say MoS didn't ""feel like a superman movie."" Most of, if not all of the time, they're referring to the previous film adaptations of the character, a la Christopher Reeves. Although everybody on this sub knows it,  those critics are not aware that Snyder is 100% dedicated to adapting as much canon to the big screen as possible."
DC_Cinematic,3746jj,thelastbrew,10,Mon May 25 02:53:21 2015 UTC,"2 years later and still, still they're new articles published about this movie. Same can't be said for Thor: Dark World or Iron Man 3."
DC_Cinematic,3746jj,suss2it,12,Sun May 24 23:29:34 2015 UTC,"Because while those movies are decent and fun, no one really gives a damn about Iron Man or Thor the way they do about Superman.   Superman is so ingrained in American culture, so ingrained in other cultures, he means something to almost everyone. The Superman 'S' symbol is the second most recognized emblem in the world behind the christian cross. He has been an enduring part of pop culture for over 75 years.  Is it really surprising that the most powerful man in the world should be a figure of controversy?"

DC_Cinematic,3746jj,gbm0102,-6,Mon May 25 00:34:48 2015 UTC,Iron Man 3 was one of the worst film's I've ever seen.
DC_Cinematic,3746jj,huskman,-3,Sun May 24 23:32:12 2015 UTC,Probably just because the new movie is coming out soon.
DC_Cinematic,3746jj,HollowmanNapkin,4,Mon May 25 01:41:11 2015 UTC,I think it's deeper than that because it's not like there was many (if any) in depth articles about Thor or Iron Man 2 when Dark World & Iron Man 3 were coming out. Not to mention it's not really coming out soon since it's almost a year away.
DC_Cinematic,3746jj,suss2it,5,Mon May 25 02:49:50 2015 UTC,"This is a very enlightening article. As someone who never read the comics, I'm glad that I read it."

DC_Cinematic,377vzu,BattleReadyPenguin,10,Mon May 25 16:34:28 2015 UTC,"No. I think it's because it gives them more creative freedom. And let's be honest, Marvel has run into a lot of creative roadblocks with projects like Agents of Shield. Sometimes separate is better."
DC_Cinematic,377vzu,gbm0102,-2,Mon May 25 16:40:30 2015 UTC,I agree sepereate can be better but DC is trying to have their cake and eat it too and I think it's biting them in the ass.  They want seperate universes but they also want to restrict the TV series from using characters which I think is hurting them  Apparently Arrow had a whole story arc around Harley Quinn that they were forced to scrap because DC didn't want her on TV.  If you want separate universes then allow them both to do their own thing.  Don't make one conform to the other if they're not connected.
DC_Cinematic,377vzu,mrthewhite,3,Mon May 25 18:59:55 2015 UTC,"No, I think they are keeping them separate because they want them to be separate."
DC_Cinematic,377vzu,S0ckHeaven,2,Mon May 25 17:18:23 2015 UTC,Don't think so. At the moment it doesn't really need to happen.

DC_Cinematic,377vzu,dexstarrr,-4,Mon May 25 17:20:58 2015 UTC,"Unquestionably not.   Warner Brothers is still in the old way of doing things. It's why they've been moving so ""slow"" with the DCCU (three years between sequels is about average) and why they're not going to be doing any cross-media integration.  Marvel makes television writ large, each film in the MCU like an episode in a series, Warner is still making movies.  Edit: Okay, Downvotey McGees, I wasn't saying Marvel is doing things better than Warner, just different. The downvote button is for people who don't contribute, not people who you perceive as disagreeing with you."
DC_Cinematic,377vzu,IAmLuckyDuckling,3,Mon May 25 17:00:05 2015 UTC,"3 years between MoS and BvS, yes. But going forward about 6 months between movies."
DC_Cinematic,371aym,Bodie293,6,Sat May 23 22:57:36 2015 UTC,Maybe talking about the characters actually appearing like a cameo instead of the stand alone film?
DC_Cinematic,371aym,MAND3L8R0T,3,Sat May 23 23:28:57 2015 UTC,He was talking about Shazam as a movie and not Black Adam as a character appearing before in cameo.
DC_Cinematic,371aym,HarishChengaiah,6,Sun May 24 08:55:06 2015 UTC,"I'm going to stick with the date that DC first revealed. With such a full slate, including potential standalone Batman and Superman films, there doesn't seem to be too much wiggle room for Shazam to move up a year or two. But who knows? We'll see what happens."
DC_Cinematic,371aym,gbm0102,2,Sat May 23 23:14:15 2015 UTC,I think he probably means they'll swap Shazam with one of the earlier films or something. Maybe JL2?

DC_Cinematic,371aym,redjc99,1 point,Sun May 24 18:21:29 2015 UTC,"Has the studio announced a release date earlier than 2019? No they haven't.   It would kinda make sense to put Johnson in a film earlier than 2019 to ride off the success he's having in the Fast and Furious franchise, plus he's in his 40's. He'll be around 47 in 2019."
DC_Cinematic,371aym,agnosgnosia,2,Sun May 24 18:34:59 2015 UTC,I never said that the studio announced anything.   He is more in the know than we are. They have probably talked to him about moving it to an earlier slot.   That's all this interview confirms for me; that they have discussed SHAZAM having an earlier release date.
DC_Cinematic,371aym,redjc99,2,Sun May 24 19:51:33 2015 UTC,"I think we've veered a little far away from where this conversation started. It's about whether or not Shazam is coming earlier than 2019. Johnson saying it, and this is only paraphrasing him, that it's probably coming, isn't confirmation."
DC_Cinematic,371aym,agnosgnosia,1 point,Sun May 24 20:02:11 2015 UTC,"Right. The title is definitely misleading. This is no way confirmation that the movie will come out before 2019, but it does confirm(to me) that there has been talks with him and WB about releasing it earlier.   I was just trying to add another point to the conversation. Not veer off of it.   Also, to be fair, I have only glanced at the article. I haven't had enough time to read through it or listen to the full interview. I apologize if that is also a part of the misunderstanding."
DC_Cinematic,372pfe,HarishChengaiah,5,Sun May 24 08:33:40 2015 UTC,Perhaps the fabled Justice League Dark movie?

DC_Cinematic,372pfe,dc_fanboyforever,3,Sun May 24 11:10:55 2015 UTC,I think it will be Man of Steel 2 possibly with pararasite and mettallo as villain. Or a true world's finest movie!
DC_Cinematic,372pfe,ReligiousGhoul,5,Sun May 24 11:18:02 2015 UTC,"I think you're probably right, or it could be the Batman/Superman Solo film, or maybe even The Sandman film they have been rumours about. Personally, I would really love for DC to dive into their Vertigo pieces."

DC_Cinematic,370t42,gbm0102,3,Sat May 23 20:50:29 2015 UTC,Is there no middleground in the US between PG-13 and R?
DC_Cinematic,370t42,DerringerHK,4,Sat May 23 23:58:46 2015 UTC,"Nope. But I'm okay with that. I'd rather a ""hard PG-13"" or a ""tame R"" then finding that the MPAA came up with another silly label.    I'm sure the movie will still be plenty violent-- There'll probably just be little to no blood (god I hate standards for what's appropriate)."
DC_Cinematic,370t42,DerringerHK,-1,Sun May 24 00:00:42 2015 UTC,"I dunno. I reckon it'll be rated R in the US. Just look at Ayer's last film: Fury. That was a hard R in the States, so he's not exactly known for subtlety in violence."
DC_Cinematic,370t42,gbm0102,4,Sun May 24 00:29:20 2015 UTC,"You think that just because Ayer made Fury that Suicide Squad would automatically warrant an R rating? Could you perhaps explain your line of thinking a bit more?  Fury wasn't one piece to a much larger franchise/shared universe. I point to my previous post: Ayer may be getting a lot of creative freedom within the DCCU, but he still has DC and Warner Bros. overseeing much of the production. Fury was a passion project that, while good, isn't comparable with Suicide Squad. It had no expectations to meet in terms of box office (making an admirable $86 million here in the U.S.), and wasn't connected to any larger franchise where much of the audience that pays to see the film wouldn't be allowed to see it in the first place with an R rating. Suicide Squad, while being a David Ayer film, is also a DCCU film. There's a lot more at stake for it. And Ayer is making it for a much bigger audience compared to those who saw Fury in theaters."
DC_Cinematic,370t42,DerringerHK,-2,Sun May 24 00:51:50 2015 UTC,"So are you saying that no matter the director's style, it's all subject to the whim of WB? Have you ever stopped to think that they hired Ayer in the first place in order to create a hyperviolent superhero film? Otherwise why didn't they just get a pure action director?  I mean, if Tarantino was directing a DC movie (god that would be so good) do you expect it to be PG-13 just because it's part of a bigger movie universe? Of course not. You don't get Tarantino to direct Avengers 3 for the same reason you don't get Joss Whedon to direct Pulp Fiction. Different styles, man - guys who are the best at what they do, and they do different things."
DC_Cinematic,370t42,gbm0102,3,Sun May 24 01:00:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying -- we lost MacLaren precisely because her vision of Wonder Woman didn't align with DC's vision. They're all about creative freedom, but make no mistake: there are rules, as with any franchise.  There's a difference between being optimistic and being naive. You're beyond naive if you think that Warner Bros. or DC desires to make a ""hyper-violent superhero film"" and chose Ayer in order to achieve it. I think it's obvious that DC/Warner chose Ayer because of his talent, and because of his ability to shoot amazing action sequences. He's also a great storyteller. But like any director who hires on to direct one piece of a franchise, he's playing by the rules of that franchise. DC needs Suicide Squad to make money. They didn't choose Ayer because they needed him to make an R rated superhero film. Please reread the other posts in this thread that go into more detail regarding this point.  Again, you're completely ignoring the big picture here. On the one hand, it's completely possible to have the kind of realistic violence that Suicide Squad implies without getting an R rating. But putting that point aside, what kind of audience would such a ""hyper violent"" film that you describe even warrant? You just cut DC's entire market by over half. You cut its profits. This isn't Blade. The success of Suicide Squad represents the success of the DCCU.  Tarantino would never direct a DC film because Tarantino would never be able to play by the rules of a much larger franchise. You answered your own question -- such a film would have to be rated PG-13 in order to appeal to the audience that the film is intended for; in other words, the majority of people that will be putting money back into DC's hands.   Your argument about different styles doesn't make sense, and like I said previously, is irrelevant. DC wants directors to have creative freedom, yes, but not at the expense of alienating and cutting off a good majority of their intended audience. That completely defeats the purpose of the franchise."
DC_Cinematic,370t42,gbm0102,1 point,Sun May 24 01:17:34 2015 UTC,"You mentioned Whedon. Surely you've read about his exhaustion with the studio system? I'm sure Ayer is getting similar restrictions and studio notes that Whedon endured, and he's probably not surprised by it (and not yet burnt out by it). These directors know it's a business, and they're willing to play along, often in the hopes of getting more fame/leeway for personal projects (Nolan can do whatever he wants at this point).    And I don't think Tarantino is a good example. He never ""needed"" a superhero franchise to help his reputation. He had the talent and popularity to rocket to creative freedom on his own. Not to say that Ayer doesn't enjoy directing Suicide Squad-- I'm sure he does-- but I bet he also sees it as a stepping stone. Whedon seemed to have loved working with his childhood heroes, but I think he's now ready to create new ones.    TL;DR -     So are you saying that no matter the director's style, it's all subject to the whim of WB?     Yeah, because they're paying for it."
DC_Cinematic,370t42,DerringerHK,3,Sun May 24 01:26:26 2015 UTC,"Your mention of Whedon brings up a good point. If anything, I think we should be happy that DC is taking the ""director"" approach over Marvel's more controlled universe. It means that directors are getting the creative freedom needed to not just create a film for the DCCU, but a film that stands on its own, unique to other films in the cinematic universe.  However. Having said that, it's clear that DC and Warner Bros. aren't about to hire, as previously mentioned, someone like Tarantino to go all out and ignore the responsibilities that come with franchises in general."
DC_Cinematic,370t42,CannibalIowa,2,Sun May 24 01:32:27 2015 UTC,"I'm getting the feeling that the DCCU will be similar to certain remakes that have happened lately, where the movies can stand alone, but there's a subtle connection. For example, The Thing (2011) was presented as a remake, but it's technically a prequel (I'm trying to think of a better movie, but you probably get the idea). Some are even making the case that Fury Road could be a sequel to the other Mad Max movies... Regardless, whether the DC connection gets as muddled as the X-verse, I just hope the DCCU grows a variety of cinematography, as opposed to the sterile, almost TV-look of the MCU.  Btw, I'm glad you're in this thread, because you're articulating this stuff better than I ever could, haha.    EDIT: Wanted to elaborate."
DC_Cinematic,370t42,gbm0102,2,Sun May 24 01:35:37 2015 UTC,I refer you to other comments in the thread.
DC_Cinematic,370t42,CannibalIowa,-1,Sun May 24 00:33:06 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your comment, but whatever. We're not WB execs anyway."
DC_Cinematic,370t42,gbm0102,7,Sun May 24 00:36:35 2015 UTC,"I really hope it's Rated R, personally."
DC_Cinematic,370t42,Justice_Prince,9,Sat May 23 21:27:45 2015 UTC,"No way this will happen. DC still needs the teens to drop their money on this film. But don't worry, they clearly know how to show the dark and gritty and gruesome while avoiding an R rating."
DC_Cinematic,370t42,gbm0102,-2,Sat May 23 21:39:10 2015 UTC,Like teens don't see R-rated movies.
DC_Cinematic,370t42,Justice_Prince,5,Sat May 23 22:40:02 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point. There's a very, very large portion of DC's audience that won't be able to see the film if it's rated R. Ultimately, that means a big loss of profits, and if there's anything that DC needs as they construct the beginning of this shared universe, it's plenty of returns. After all, they're competing with Disney and Marvel. There's no way in hell that they'd risk losing a chunk of their profits/audience just for the sake of an R rating. Not gonna happen."
DC_Cinematic,370t42,lumberzach316,5,Sat May 23 23:08:48 2015 UTC,"They do, but an R-rating keeps many more teens out of the theater than PG-13. I still remember being refused entry to Red Dragon back in the day, just because my friend and I didn't have a parent there to buy our tickets.    I'd LOVE if Suicide Squad was rated R, but general audiences have no clue about this comic, so WB wants to maximize their profits. This is also probably why they're allowing all the set photos (more exposure). Compare it to the near-dark production of Batman v Superman, which can rely on the title alone to bring moviegoers out in droves. Plus with the connected universe, they'll want to keep all their ratings the same (IIRC, Deadpool probably stands alone from the X-Movies).   Even with Deadpool's huge built-in fanbase, Fox waited years to greenlight the movie, only doing so when that CG test footage went viral. Maybe WB could attempt a similar R-rated ""leak,"" but I just don't see it happening (or helping). Like I said in my other comment, I'm expecting an unrated Blu-Ray, at best."
DC_Cinematic,370t42,dc_fanboyforever,1 point,Sat May 23 22:52:42 2015 UTC,Yeah one of the big draws of getting an R rating is that it will make the 14 to 16 demographic want to see the movie even more.  Just like a PG 13 rating makes the 10 to 12 year olds want to see a movie even more.
DC_Cinematic,36xiue,LordCommanderStark,21,Fri May 22 23:00:16 2015 UTC,Definitely fan-made. Not real.

DC_Cinematic,36xcvc,Justice_Prince,3,Fri May 22 22:31:39 2015 UTC,"As far as I know the Mercy Graves from Young Justice was the only one that was a robot.  The original in the the DCAU was just a normal human.  I don't know anything about the comic version of her, but on her wiki it doesn't seem to say anything about her being a robot, or cyborg.  It does seem that the comic version of her is an Amazon so they might do something with that."

DC_Cinematic,36vcqt,BattleReadyPenguin,28,Fri May 22 12:34:56 2015 UTC,"To be honest it's an obvious comparison that has been used before, but never fully explored. People have bitched about it being different from canon already, but let's be honest. DC is trying to take the fantasy and wonder of comics and place them in our world. In our world, if someone like Superman showed up you'd have people calling him a god, people calling him a heretic and everything in between. Hell, a movie about him divided people into those arguments.   However I think Clark should (and will) be uncomfortable with these comparisons. Based on how he looks in the trailer I'd say this is definitely the case. He doesn't want to be a god, he doesn't want to tell anyone how to live their lives. His ultimate struggle is one of restraint. He wants to be there to stop people from hurting one another based on his own sense of ethics, which he learned from humans, but never impose his will on them. Of course, he's also gonna dislike the people calling him a devil, but because of the strength of his character he'll learn use the criticisms to improve himself.   I think the movie should end with a majority of people accepting Superman for who he is. Someone with the power of a god who chooses not to be. Someone who chooses to hope instead of control. Someone who is an idol but also a peer. Entirely human, but not at all. An outsider who teaches us to believe in ourselves. This transition is made all the more powerful by the fact that we've seen him go through a very human struggle and make mistakes with his power.    There's a lot of potential here to pay respect to classic Superman while putting an entirely new and original spin on the character, which, when you think about it, is what every comic creator does. I hope they can take advantage of it, and with Terrio in charge I think they will."

DC_Cinematic,36vcqt,okaychalet,21,Fri May 22 20:32:39 2015 UTC,"It only makes sense. Even Jor-El says that he'll be seen as a God on Earth very early into the first film. And after the devastation of Metropolis, it's completely believable that the world would see him as a superhuman/God-like figure, for better or worse. I'm very glad that Snyder decided to use that notion as a basis for his story."

DC_Cinematic,36vcqt,MiQBonafide,12,Sat May 23 00:16:08 2015 UTC,"It's the most exciting aspect of the movie, if you ask me. The fact that they are at least trying to go more into what Superman means, says, and represents to us as humans (or maybe Americans...) is what could make the movie special and unique in the category of superhero movies.  The downside is that the movie could also be biting off more than it can chew. These are heady questions, and if done poorly, could bore the average movie-goer, and disappoint fans, if these questions are not answered well. My fingers are crossed."
DC_Cinematic,36vcqt,moskie,4,Fri May 22 17:10:20 2015 UTC,"If you presume a world where superheroes don't exist - even one where stories of some masked vigilante who calls himself 'Batman' come from some other big city - anyone who could fly would be automatically presumed to be a God by a lot of people, even without any of Superman's other powers. Add everything else he was observed doing to the mix and yeah, totally makes sense. There'd also be a lot of people convinced he was a fraud and a bunch more convinced it was some enormous government conspiracy. I imagine we'll see a little bit of those elements as well."
DC_Cinematic,36vcqt,TheCheshireCody,3,Fri May 22 14:07:01 2015 UTC,"It completely makes sense, and I get that Batman will be the one to talk some sense into Superman.  Then, together, they'll create the JLA."

I think running it much smaller with only four comics a mouth.  Maybe a Justice League series that runs non stop, and run three solo series for six comic arcs (one trade) before giving someone else a go.   If that's a bit too limiting then maybe eight comics a month with making Justice League bi monthly.  I've thought about how I would re-imagine the DC universe, and I think the one major change I would make is so severely limit the scope of ""super science"".  You would still have alien civilizations, and mad scientists creating tech that is beyond the current possibilities, and anomalies in biology that allow for extraordinary abilities, but anything that straight up breaks the known laws of physics would have to be explained at least partially by magic."

DC_Cinematic,36tw5s,phantompoo,10,Fri May 22 03:32:46 2015 UTC,"Whenever I hear news that comes from this guy, I can't help but take it with a pound of salt."
DC_Cinematic,36tw5s,gbm0102,0,Fri May 22 02:25:48 2015 UTC,"Sure, his recent ""scoops"" are just repeating preexisting rumors.  That said, short of him commissioning people to make production art for him or being duped by people sending him fan art, he has published seemingly reliable promo art recently which is enough reason to at least listen to what he says even if you don't buy it."
DC_Cinematic,36tw5s,JimmyBing,4,Fri May 22 02:31:17 2015 UTC,"Seeing as how the WW movie has been rumored to be a period piece for a while now, I don't know how HOT BOOM!!! this rumor is."

If you are someone who can enjoy multiple versions of Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Who, fairy tales and myths at the same time then go for it.  If you are someone who easily imprints on the first thing you are exposed to and that becomes ""your"" definitive version of the thing to the exclusion of everything else and find yourself unable to accept any differences between the versions then I would pick which medium you prefer and stick with it."

Maybe check out N52 Justice League to see Cyborg interacting with the big 3."

With one failed movie(and yeah...I liked it too,but its considered a failure) and one failed TV show(again...I quite liked CONSTANTINE,but if it doesn't get picked up by the CW its toast)CONSTANTINE/HELLBLAZER will be put on the shelf never to be touched by Hollywood again....UNLESS some big name director like Del Toro ONLY wants to use the character,and is willing to put up the budget or make a cheap-ass movie. Seriously folks....if the TV series dies,it will be a VERY long time before Warner Bros. is willing to invest in this character again!"
DC_Cinematic,36p3j7,JobaccaWookiee,4,Thu May 21 02:34:28 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think that it's one thing to invest in a television series or film centered around the character and story of Constantine, and a completely different thing to simply include the character in other franchises, such as Justice League Dark. One notion relies on the character to carry the project, the other doesn't. I'm fairly confident that we could see Constantine show up in future DCCU films in spite of the fate of the TV series.  On top of that, DC has made it clear that the TV and cinematic universes are separate. So I'm not sure if we'll necessarily see Matt Ryan again. I've never seen the TV show, but there's no reason why Matt Ryan couldn't pop up in one of DC's other shows. For film, I actually think Matthew McConaughey would be an interesting choice. I've always seen him more of a fit for the DC universe over Marvel."

DC_Cinematic,36p3j7,americanhardgums,1 point,Sun May 24 05:39:16 2015 UTC,I actually think if we ever see him in a movie again it definitely won't be Ryan. They have made it beyond clear the tv and movies are completely separate.

DC_Cinematic,36my15,invisiblack,3,Wed May 20 17:03:49 2015 UTC,Slipknot has been in a couple of them. Unfortunately he seems like a pretty expendable character at this point.

DC_Cinematic,36lotr,TimTamDrake,9,Wed May 20 09:43:44 2015 UTC,None of the television shows are connected to the DCCU.
DC_Cinematic,36lotr,IAmLuckyDuckling,2,Wed May 20 16:38:42 2015 UTC,"From the leaked pilot, it almost seems like it could be. But no, sources say they are unconnected.  I could see them actually changing their minds and announcing that Supergirl is attached to the DCCU instead of the Arrowverse like originally intended. But I wouldn't hold my breath, its a long shot."
DC_Cinematic,36lotr,FlameyFlame,0,Sun May 24 01:29:33 2015 UTC,From the leaked pilot it's unequivocally no.  They reference Superman doing things that never happened in the movie.  They say that when Superman first showed up the first thing he did was save an air plane.   Not only that but Superman has been Superman in the show for at least 10 years AND has know that he has a cousin living on earth and exactly where she's been all this time.  There's also no Jimmy Olsen in MoS but in Supergirl Jimmy is Superman's best friend.
DC_Cinematic,36lotr,mrthewhite,1 point,Mon May 25 19:13:00 2015 UTC,"Well I meant that this would take place much later in the timeline than Man of Steel.  The airplane thing is legit, I forgot about that, and you're right it's not the first thing Superman did in Man of Steel, but I feel like they could fairly easily retcon in an airplane saving scene to be the first thing he does once he gets to Metropolis or find some other way to twist that line.  Yes I was imagining that this would take place long after MoS. He could (hypothetically) find out about Kara right after he kills Zod and that could also be when he starts really getting to know Jimmy. They could say he posed for the photo at some point off camera during Man of Steel timeline.  Once again, not saying I believe this to be true, but playing devil's advocate maybe, there isn't anything they've really put in the pilot that couldn't possibly exist 10 years after Man of Steel, it would really only take about one episodes worth of work-arounds to line up all the story points. On the other hand, I think fitting it into the Arrowverse requires even more work-arounds than the DCCU, and they will most likely head in the direction of Arrowverse.  All I meant to say is that if the writers can somehow have plans for this to mesh with Arrow/Flash, then the same writers could most likely find a way to get it to work for the DCCU."
DC_Cinematic,36lotr,FlameyFlame,1 point,Mon May 25 21:45:06 2015 UTC,I understand what you want here but it's not going to happen.  The best case scenario is that Supergirl gets rolled into the Arrow/Flash universe.  There will never be TV/Movie cross overs by DC because DC sees TV as second class.  There's also the fact that Jimmy Olsen is a black man in Supergirl and and a white woman in MoS.  I don't see where the Arrow universe would require more work at all.  They've not introduced anything in any of the 3 existing shows that would contradict each other the way Supergirl has contradicted MoS already in the pilot.
DC_Cinematic,36lotr,mrthewhite,1 point,Tue May 26 12:32:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not even saying its what I want. Just that I thought it was possible. I would much rather see her in the Arrowverse than the DCCU. But I know these guys like to change stuff up on us so I'm trying to imagine which pieces fit together better, and to me it looks like DCCU.  Yes, in Man of Steel, we never get to meet Kara or Jimmy yet, and he doesn't save a plane on camera. But how bout the fact that there's all these metahumans with different abilities showing up every week on the Flash. And not once does anyone say ""Hey this is kinda like that blue guy in Metropolis!"" They never wonder why he's not coming to help. And even though they supposedly have known about a blue flying superhero in a cape for the last ten years, they never once in 23 episodes ponder whether or not any of these metahumans could be scientifically similar to Superman. They already know all superpowers are caused by particle accelerator even though the precedent tells you super powers can also come from alien life forms. So why don't the ""top"" scientists take that into account.  I'm just saying. Either way, they have some serious 'splainin to do to make that pilot mesh with either universe cleanly. So don't rule out that sacred human ability to change your mind at the last second from DC comics."
DC_Cinematic,36lotr,FlameyFlame,1 point,Tue May 26 14:36:16 2015 UTC,"I think it's easier to rectify an omission than it is to correct a contradiction.  Some reference to him recognizing the situation was under control by the Flash or that he was busy with meta humans who migrated outside central city would do just fine.  There's also no reason for them to look for alien super powers since they know the accelerator created super powers.  they wouldn't think it was aliens until they found a super powered person who wasn't created by the accelerator.  As far as they would be aware Superman was an isolated anomaly.  At the end of the day though I'm not ruling it out based on the stories at hand, I'm rulling it out based on DCs clear record of treating TV as second class entertainment.  They've meddled plenty in Arrow specifically to prevent them from using characters that would one day be used in films but at the same time are more than willing to take characters that have already been established in TV into the movie universe if it suits their purposes."
DC_Cinematic,36lotr,mrthewhite,0,Tue May 26 15:05:44 2015 UTC,"Ah, your use of weasel words finally reveals the reason for your bias. You're mad at DC for taking away Deadshot, not allowing the teased Harley,  swapping Blue Beetle for Atom etc. Etc. I wouldn't call that ""meddling"" so much as just planning. They realize that movies are a more profitable industry, movies are where the big budgets go, so they run them as two separate universes. And they also realize its confusing to casual fans to have 2 live-action versions of the same character running around simultaneously, so the movies take priority. Why the hell wouldn't they?  When you have a guy like Will Smith taking one of your iconic roles, you really don't need to have some no-name Michael Rowe playing the same character in an unrelated series. I'm sure when they are done using Deadshot in the movies he'll be allowed to return to action in the Arrowverse. (Yes he's dead but offscreen deaths aren't final)  And still, I have to argue the continuity thing... Why are the scientists on the Flash shitting their pants about the idea of a person who got powers who wasn't hit with a particle blast towards the end of the season? If Superman exists, these scientists know beyond a shadow of reasonable doubt that there are other sources of superpower in their world. So it makes no sense for them to not even consider it.  Also the things mentioned that were missing from MoS (Jimmy, Kara, plane scene) could just as easily be called omission not contradiction."
DC_Cinematic,36lotr,FlameyFlame,1 point,Tue May 26 16:02:23 2015 UTC,"You're reading far to much into my comment.  I couldn't give a shit about Deadshot or Harley or Blue Beetle, was just pointing out that they're clearly dealing with a 2 tier system.  Whatever you want to call what they're doing, they clearly don't want to connect the universes.  All the scientist know is that 1 single alien from a dead planet made it to earth and 99% of all known powers came from the event in Flash.  Depending on the incarnation of Superman they're dealing with they may be under the impression he is the one and only survivor of the only known alien race.  The realization that someone else with power might be out there is still a shocking consideration.  Superman isn't a result of a source of power on the earth.    Assuming Superman is in this world, just because they don't voice the idea that the powered person could be alien doesn't mean they've never considered it, it could be they just think it's too unlikely since the only other alien race they know about is extinct.  As for the seperation from movie to TV show, they say in the show the first thing superman did was save a plane (he didn't), he's been around for 10 years (he hasn't been) and know at least most of that time his cousin was growing up in a small town that he placed her in (never happened).  All of those things contradict MoS where he though he was alone, was new to the world and never saved any planes.    You could say this is 10 years later but that only explains 2 of those things.  The plane is unquestionably a contradiction.  Saying Superman did something that he clearly didn't do in a time frame that had to happen during the first movie is a contradiction, not an omission."
DC_Cinematic,36lotr,mrthewhite,0,Tue May 26 21:35:23 2015 UTC,"All the scientist know is that 1 single alien from a dead planet made it to earth and 99% of all known powers came from the event in Flash. Depending on the incarnation of Superman they're dealing with they may be under the impression he is the one and only survivor of the only known alien race.   Yes. They know about one alien. One world changing, iconic alien who changes literally everything. You say they know 99% of all other power comes from the Flash but how do they know that? Even assuming they know everything about Superman: his planet of origin, and the fact that he's the only survivor (kinda), why would they assume that Krypton is the only planet in the big black abyss that aliens can come from? I mean a real scientist is gonna take that into account if Superman has alien powers any other powers could also be alien. Kryptonian or otherwise. I'm just saying that is a huge plothole that they would have to work around.   And okay they referenced an event in an earlier timeline that we didn't see originally when we were watching that timeline. There's a name for that, its not contradiction, it's ""retcon"". A contradiction would be if Jimmy said ""oh yeah the first huge villain Superman had to go against was Zod. He didn't snap his neck or anything though he just banished him to the phantom zone."" That's a contradiction. Talking about an event that we didn't know about the first time is something else entirely. Its done all the time in fiction. Check out Doctor Who.  A 2 tier system actually makes a lot of sense when you are dealing with 2 different forms of media that have 2 very different budget restraints. DCCU has the money to do things like go out and get Will Smith and Ben Affleck. They didn't want to be constrained to using the actors who they had already cast for TV. While guys like Michael Rowe or Grant Gustin do great jobs for where they are, they aren't Hollywood blockbuster movie-caliber actors. Same with the CGI people/sound designers etc.  When there's such a difference in how much money is spent to make each product, and such a difference in how the profits are recouped, a 2-tier system makes a lot more sense.  Marvel understands the tiers as well but attempts to blend them better. Ever wonder why RDJ and Samuel L. Jackson don't show up in Agents of Shield or even DareDevil? Because they aren't TV tier actors it doesn't make financial sense."

The way some of the fanboys go on about it, you'd think every movie they made was a pile of shit. It's as if the Dark Knight Trilogy didn't exist, or the Donner or Burton movies were trash. Do these people not have any faith? BvS got rewritten by an academy award-winner and stars an academy award-winner (albeit it's for best picture, not acting). Suicide Squad is being directed by a proven director, the guy who fucking wrote Training Day. The Joker is being played by yet another academy award-winner and they hate on him because he is a reinterpretation of the character just like the Nolan version was.   I don't remember the comic book Joker having a cut-up face. I don't remember him wearing face paint or having unkempt greasy hair. I don't remember him being an outright terrorist. But you know what? It worked for the world Nolan created. And I'm sure Ayer's Clown Prince will work for the world he created.   Some people need to relax. The film's more than a year away, anyway. We might get some stuff at SDCC. Maybe then the whiners will put a sock in it."
DC_Cinematic,36ik0p,LordCommanderStark,1 point,Tue May 19 22:42:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, people need to fucking chill.I have made my opinions on the Leto's Joker,quite clear.

BvS got rewritten by an academy award-winner and stars an academy award-winner   Akiva Goldsman writer of Batman and Robin was also an Oscar winner.   ...Having unkempt greasy hair.    There are quite a few iterations of The Joker where he has unkempt hair, maybe not at the length of Ledgers, but still.   I don't remember him being an outright terrorist.    By definition, The Joker has more or less been a terrorist for years.Again, maybe not to the extent in Nolan's but still very much part of the character.   And I'm sure Ayer's Clown Prince will work for the world he created.   This is false. This is no longer the case,Leto's Joker now has the potential to bounce around films,because of this, people are more protective and vocal about it.I love Ayer and want him to put his creative stamp on S.S, and I definitely think we will get that.

DC_Cinematic,36ik0p,decrepidactyl,3,Wed May 20 01:05:52 2015 UTC,"Love you too, decrepit prehistoric flying reptile.  I may have gotten a bit emotional in that rant - and by that I mean I totally did - so now that I have the fanboy goggles off, I can understand some peoples' apprehension at the liberties taken with the characters. Though, keep in mind that something done in one movie could easily be rectified in another.   Ben Affleck is one of the biggest Batman fanboys out there, he knows the world of Gotham, and he is likely going to direct the Batman solo film. If Ayer's vision doesn't work, then Ben can fix things up, make it so that Mister Jay was going through a bit of a diva phase during Suicide Squad and come the Batman solo film, he's back to Clown Prince form."
DC_Cinematic,36ik0p,LordCommanderStark,4,Wed May 20 01:40:23 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, on all accounts. Personally, I don't have a specific Joker,and he undoubtedly my favourite.

If Ayer's vision doesn't work, then Ben can fix things up, make it so that Mister Jay was going through a bit of a diva phase during Suicide Squad and come the Batman solo film, he's back to Clown Prince form.   Exactly why I think we are in for some surprises, whether it be in this film or the universe (DCCU). They - Zack,Ayer,Affleck & Co can get pretty creative here. They are taking risks, so I wouldn't put it passed them."

DC_Cinematic,36ik0p,WildEndeavor,12,Wed May 20 23:08:27 2015 UTC,It would indeed...
DC_Cinematic,36ik0p,LOCHO53,6,Tue May 19 17:38:26 2015 UTC,"A lot of people aren't looking forward to the DC movies in the first place. Just go look at the reactions to the teaser trailer. Whether it's /r/comicbooks or /r/movies, DC movies are premiering with a giant handicap; they're not Marvel. So a lot of vocal fans (who literally have no idea how is going to turn out because it's not even done filming) are already shooting it down."
DC_Cinematic,36ik0p,ferncaz95,8,Tue May 19 20:44:25 2015 UTC,I'd say they're a vocal minority. Most people love both and don't even know they're separate universes.
DC_Cinematic,36ik0p,Damdatswhack,6,Wed May 20 03:24:06 2015 UTC,"Well, DC's really only just getting started with its new movies. I'm sure once they have a couple more under their belt people will start treating their stuff with more optimism."
DC_Cinematic,36ik0p,IwishIwasGoku,-4,Tue May 19 21:09:14 2015 UTC,they've also failed at a good amount of their previous attempts
DC_Cinematic,36ik0p,decrepidactyl,7,Wed May 20 01:42:24 2015 UTC,"True, but they were under completely different leadership. Since then they've gotten a new CEO, Geoff Johns, and a shit ton of legitimate talent in terms of both writing and directing. I think they've learned from those movies, the same way Fox learned from X3 and Origins: Wolverine"
DC_Cinematic,36ik0p,BattleReadyPenguin,6,Wed May 20 05:21:37 2015 UTC,"When ? With Green Lantern ? Yeah, you're right.They most definitely failed with that. But, in my opinion, they were smart to start/and open the DCCU with Man Of Steel. Now that they have Supes off the ground, you can branch out to some of the other big players.   Not saying this is guaranteed success, I just choose to look at the positives and enjoy what I like about it."
DC_Cinematic,36ik0p,Mordkay,5,Wed May 20 02:52:54 2015 UTC,Something more comicbook friendly? Maybe a joker with the personality of the one from DKR but mash of the classic look with new 52
DC_Cinematic,36ik0p,Mordkay,2,Tue May 19 17:50:47 2015 UTC,Joker wearing his own cut-off face in a movie would have been incredible
DC_Cinematic,36ik0p,BattleReadyPenguin,6,Tue May 19 18:00:49 2015 UTC,I can already hear people reacting to a cut-off face joker in a movie...jikes not good.
DC_Cinematic,36ik0p,gbm0102,2,Tue May 19 22:22:18 2015 UTC,There's no pleasing some people!
DC_Cinematic,36ik0p,Csantana,6,Wed May 20 17:55:35 2015 UTC,"So true, my theory is that DC has saturated their top characters so much into pop culture, that So many people have their own ideas and thoughts about a character and different takes, such as this joker, will not make every one happy."
DC_Cinematic,36jg7p,BattleReadyPenguin,4,Tue May 19 20:54:54 2015 UTC,I think it would be amazing...BUT..since The Avengers already did it (twice) I would rather see them do something new.
DC_Cinematic,36jg7p,lumberzach316,6,Wed May 20 01:49:37 2015 UTC,"I think Snyder will have some very memorable shots in store for us, unique from felling like the Avengers shots. Maybe something akin to some of those memorable shots in 300 or something."
DC_Cinematic,36jg7p,S0ckHeaven,3,Wed May 20 03:35:55 2015 UTC,"I think the difference between the Avengers and the Justice League, is  the Justice league are almost more God like, (I know Thor is a god but what are you gonna do, maybe they feel less ragtag?) I'm thinking more along the lines of the justice league cartoon show opening. I dont expect them to borrow too heavily from the show or even the comics (more power too them) I just think something showing them as victorious idols would be really cool.   Edit: had to fix something where I said Avengers when I meant the Justice League"
DC_Cinematic,36jg7p,Csantana,3,Wed May 20 04:01:50 2015 UTC,It's actually the Justice League who are portrayed as gods among men more often and the Avengers are seen as more down to earth and flexible in morality. Or at least that's how most people saw it in the past.
DC_Cinematic,36jg7p,Kongkiller,3,Wed May 20 04:12:15 2015 UTC,"oh yeah totally, I probably didnt do a very good job of expressing that but that is exactly what I meant.   Oh I did mess up, think I fixed it though"
DC_Cinematic,36jg7p,Csantana,5,Wed May 20 04:50:36 2015 UTC,"Lets say they are fighting Darkseid, the tracking shot can start from the crowd running away from the main fight, we see GL dropping people over a safe zone and a flaming car fly's towards he grabs it and runs forward to the front lines throwing the car, we follow the car to see Wonder dogging the car as it blows up Darkseid's minions in the background while Wonder Woman is swinging her sword through a flurry of enemies we see GL pass over head and WW leaps further towards the front lines where we see a red streak fly past, time slows and we see it is the Flash and he he using Darkseids minions as a battering ram to destroy other minions. Flash zooms past Cyborg who is fighting along Batman both are talking turns in defending each other while trying to defuse a bomb and they too head towards the font lines not before we see Aquaman leap out of a building from behind where the bomb was and preforming a drop kick on a group of minions about to murder civilians, he throws his trident and we follow the trident as it impales a few minions and we see the Man of Steel wrestling with Darkseid on the front line of this war he blasts Darkseid with his lazer and blinds him and throws him to the ground and we see the League form up ready to destroy Darkseid"

DC_Cinematic,36hn6z,LasDen,2,Tue May 19 13:32:44 2015 UTC,"Abstractly,  i think it draws too much comparison with Marvel:  Hero movies leading up to a team-up movie with a Thanos-like arch villain commanding armies of unoriginal plot devices used for action scenes.   I wish DC would have taken the WuTang approach, whereas they introduce all the protagonists and THEN branch out into solo adventures. Why have one villain with the generic alien invasion trope when you can have the arch nemesis of each JL member form a team of their own and wage war. That could have created a reality where Superman wasn't a founding member, but instead gets recruited after the events of Man of Steel take place to help out because shit is getting crazy. The only thing that would disrupt that theory would be the question ""how has no one heard of this superhero team until now"", which actually goes with the speculation that Batman is just an urban legend and no one really knows much about him other than the persona of fear. Just spit balling here, but your idea is good too."
DC_Cinematic,36hn6z,MAND3L8R0T,2,Thu May 21 16:38:09 2015 UTC,I like the idea because it creates a villain that actually seems powerful. But I don't think we need so many solo films.
DC_Cinematic,36hn6z,urgasmic,2,Tue May 19 14:21:27 2015 UTC,A big overarching conspiracy like in Young Justice would be total badass like Vandal Savage and Gordon Godfrey meeting Darkseid.
DC_Cinematic,36hn6z,dc_fanboyforever,1 point,Tue May 19 15:38:22 2015 UTC,"I feel like you're just describing the whole Thanos/Infinity Gauntlet scenario word for word.  DC has done a good job of showing they aren't just following a template laid out by Marvel. They have their own approach to a superhero universe and I think the ""big bad"" needs to reflect that.  There's a lot of different ways they can create a villain that is ferocious and shows up in different movies before he is at full power. I think we'll see this kind of leadup with Lex, the Joker, and Brainiac. Maybe Darkseid and the New Gods play a part eventually too. But I think building their universe around Darkseid's plot to destroy the Earth is way too similar to the Infinity Gem scenario. So I'm gonna hope that its a no for this idea."

DC_Cinematic,36e93w,decrepidactyl,22,Mon May 18 18:40:56 2015 UTC,"I was happy, and then I noticed the clear head tattoo.  I'm not picky, I can handle anything, absolutely ANYTHING with the design, except that tattoo. It's the one that seems too much for me. Not even for what it says, I just like a clean faced Joker!"
DC_Cinematic,36e93w,TheJoshider10,13,Mon May 18 18:35:08 2015 UTC,So the joker makes you uncomfortable? Isnt that kind of the point? ;)
DC_Cinematic,36e93w,KidK0dy,5,Mon May 18 20:15:33 2015 UTC,Why? I see people saying this over and over again but no one seems to have a reason.
DC_Cinematic,36e93w,davanillagorilla,-2,Tue May 19 04:55:07 2015 UTC,"I don't get how you haven't heard a reason if you keep seeing it over and over again because everyone always gives reasons why.  I just don't like the look. It's edgy for the sake of being edgy, and it's not even done in shitty font suggesting a cheap job, it's just too perfectly done. I'm fine with normal tattoos because I don't think they're a bad idea but every Joker design I've ever seen has had their own little iconic quirks to the face. It feels like instead of doing something creative with the eyes and mouth, they thought fuck it and just stuck a tattoo on his head."
DC_Cinematic,36e93w,TheJoshider10,3,Tue May 19 16:31:26 2015 UTC,"You know hardly anything about the movie or character though, your opinion on what they are going to be like and how good it will be means pretty much nothing. Those also just aren't very good reasons to me, but alright."

You may not find them ""good"" reasons, but guess what, everyone else does. They are legit complaints about a design whether you like them or not, because everyone has different tastes.   I think Leto will be fantastic, and I can't wait to see it. I just feel they really could have done so much more with his design than a simple slicked back hair, normal lipstick and a tattoo."
DC_Cinematic,36e93w,almighty-thud,0,Tue May 19 17:47:18 2015 UTC,"I just think it's completely out of character for the Joker to be so childish as to have that sort of tattoo.

DC_Cinematic,36e93w,thedeevolution,-2,Mon May 18 21:30:56 2015 UTC,Maybe he got it when he was a teenage gangster?

But I am also saddened that so much content is leaking. While I'm grateful to now know that Leto will be sporting the tattoos, I can't help but feel that these shitty-quality photos are detrimental to the feeling I'll get when I finally see them on screen.  Don't get me wrong - I'll happily tear to pieces every photo or piece of information we get - I just wish this film wasn't shrouded in so much controversy (especially over how they're treating The Joker) so that it could fly under the radar a little more. I just wish this fucking movie was finished so our judgements can be fair and impartial.  That being said, fuck yeah I'm really excited to see this version of Joker and Harley. And I don't have strong opinions of the tattoos one way or another to be honest, but I think the makeup is done well (presumably super-oversaturated because, like its film predecessors, it will have a muted colour-grading) and the suit and car just scream ""psychopathic unhinged mobster"". I really can't wait to hear and see Leto in character, rather than what might as well be cosplay."

DC_Cinematic,36e93w,BTennant1234,4,Mon May 18 19:53:11 2015 UTC,I doubt this is her as Harleen Quinzel. She's brandishing a fancy piece and in that leaked footage she shoots a truck driver in the head. It's been mentioned elsewhere that she'd have lots of costume changes. I imagine it'd be pretty hard for her to get around the city without attracting a lot of attention if she constantly wore the Harley Quinn costume.

Seeing Harley Quinn in street clothes makes me think that these villains might be leading double lives just like the heros.   If this is true, then the face tattoos are something he puts on when he's in Joker mode while he hides the more permanent tattoos under his shirt. Swap out the teeth and wash out the hair and he could blend into the crowd... (and apply fake eyebrows!)"

DC_Cinematic,36dgws,IwishIwasGoku,3,Mon May 18 17:22:59 2015 UTC,"Well since Blue Beetle and Booster Gold weren't allowed in the CW-verse and DC said they have plans for them, I think we'll get a blue & gold movie at some point.  Other than that I'd love a Teen Titans movie, and I think JL:Dark will happen around then. Probably some sequels to whatever ended up being popular. Definitely at least one Batman sequel (if they even manage to get the first one out), maybe an Aquaman or Wonder Woman sequel too. Hopefully a ton of GL sequels. You could keep those going even if the rest of the DCCU 'ends'."
DC_Cinematic,36dgws,LasDen,9,Mon May 18 17:38:15 2015 UTC,"I might be downvoted but I think after 2020 there will be a huge downscale on the comicbook movies. 10 DC movie in 5 years and there are Marvel, Fox and Sony. It will be a bit oversaturated and its inevitable for the audience to burn out. Im not saying after 2020 there wont be any comicbook movie but it will be like 1 or 2 movie every few years."
DC_Cinematic,36dgws,samx3i,6,Mon May 18 16:18:41 2015 UTC,People have been saying that for the past decade and the opposite is true; they're making more movies and the box office numbers suggest the trend will only continue.

DC_Cinematic,36dgws,LasDen,3,Mon May 18 16:47:36 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but I still think that DC will keep to their schedule of 1-2 films per year. Same with Marvel. I don't see Fox releasing more than one film a year following the untitled X-Men film in 2018, but I could be wrong. Someone correct me if I'm overlooking something, but doesn't Fox just have Fantastic Four and X-Men under their belts? That's not much compared to what DC and Marvel plan to dish out.   The possibility for burnout is definitely there, but if the studios make sure to spread out their releases each year, I think it can be avoided."
DC_Cinematic,36dgws,Techno_Bacon,2,Mon May 18 16:27:33 2015 UTC,"They dont have much, but the X-Men can be much. Solo movies, x-force and stuff. But it doesnt seem to me they want to wide their X-Men movies so much..."

It'd be a good opportunity for DC to use the more experimental directors they wouldn't gamble on with main DCCU movies like Justice League.   I think a DC elseworlds Netflix series could be fun too, and maybe more preferable."
DC_Cinematic,36dgws,krispness,2,Tue May 19 00:52:36 2015 UTC,"Well a lot of the films will likely get sequels.  I think Batman will be getting a movie in 2019, and Superman in 2020 so those aren't after Green Lantern.  Well maybe Superman still will be.  It's hard to say what order these films would be in, but I'm betting in 2021 we'll see Wonder Woman 2, Dark Universe, and maybe Flash 2."

Those people are pretty naive to believe a large studio like WB would be willing to release a slate of movies and already have two of those movies in production and NOT have a plan.

It's more along the lines of, ""What's the plan?""  Aside from the obvious fact that they're building toward JL, we know very little. Even I was incredibly skeptical (and remain so) about the rumors that DC/Warner hired up to six writers for the Wonder Woman script alone.  I still think that DC will probably surprise us at Comic-Con, but putting that aside, most fans just want to know that DC is on the right track and possibly even learning from Marvel's mistakes. They want to know that DC is handling the universe well. I'm optimistic overall, but more information about the shared universe couldn't hurt."
DC_Cinematic,36bbu3,gbm0102,1 point,Mon May 18 02:10:14 2015 UTC,"i honestly don't want that much more information. I kind of want to start avoiding this sub and /r/dccomics because I feel like by the time these movies start coming out, I'll know the basic gist of what's going to happen."
DC_Cinematic,36bbu3,actin_and_myosin,3,Mon May 18 11:19:48 2015 UTC,while I admit I don't know much about Lobo I could see him working as a film pretty well. Like a combination of Dredd and Guardians of the galaxy.

DC_Cinematic,36b33a,BattleReadyPenguin,4,Sun May 17 22:48:26 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, he has the look and iirc it has been mentioned that he has been bulking up."
DC_Cinematic,36b33a,deonist,3,Sun May 17 23:27:36 2015 UTC,"This is still my hope. I'm not a Chris Pine-Hal Jordan fan, and I love when they cast fresh blood. We may not know how well Ray Fisher will play Cyborg, yet it has me excited.   Honestly though, as long as Hal is the JL-founding Green Lantern, I'll be happy."
DC_Cinematic,36b33a,XxVaynexX,4,Mon May 18 14:36:10 2015 UTC,"That's been my guess as of recent. Every member of the Justice League, even The Flash (who won't be seen until 2017), has been announced as being cast except for GL. Does this mean that DC hasn't cast GL? IMO, no it doesn't. I think Amboyer, as well as other actors, have been cast or atleast being looked at for other lanterns."
DC_Cinematic,36b33a,thelastbrew,2,Sun May 17 23:16:46 2015 UTC,We're still missing Shazam.
DC_Cinematic,36b33a,mental_reincarnation,4,Sun May 17 23:43:54 2015 UTC,I doubt Shazam will be a founding member.
DC_Cinematic,36b33a,Jangwin,-3,Mon May 18 00:27:32 2015 UTC,Why would they announce Black Adam 5 years before the movie though? If he does end up involved somehow before that it's only natural that Shazam does too.
DC_Cinematic,36b33a,IwishIwasGoku,2,Mon May 18 05:40:34 2015 UTC,"Dwayne Johnson has been attached to the Shazam film since the early 2000s, though, before New Line was even absorbed into Warner Brothers. It's quite possible that they were simply confirming what most people already suspected.  Assuming he's a part of the DCCU (and I believe that he is), I don't see Shazam as a founding member of the JL; rather, I see him as a spectator who looks up to other heroes and desires to imitate their heroics. He's a kid who sees all of these heroes coming together for the first time and wants to be like them. Justice League Unlimited had a neat spin on that. With that in mind, there's no reason to introduce Shazam or Black Adam into the DCCU prior to the first Justice League film.  Having said that, I wouldn't be opposed to it. I just don't think it's entirely necessary."
DC_Cinematic,36b33a,gbm0102,-2,Mon May 18 15:05:02 2015 UTC,Honestly to me it really says something about that film if they wanted to reveal Black Adam. He may not be in the Justice League film but something tells me he won't even be the real focus of his own film. Black Adam will dominate it.
DC_Cinematic,36b33a,TheJoshider10,2,Mon May 18 14:46:03 2015 UTC,Could also be Steve Trevor...
DC_Cinematic,36b33a,bats7,2,Mon May 18 22:24:40 2015 UTC,The one problem with this is: why didn't they reveal it back in October?
DC_Cinematic,36b33a,TronVin,1 point,Sun May 17 23:59:48 2015 UTC,"Because of the risk of getting negative feedback from fans, you know because of the Green Lantern movie"
DC_Cinematic,36b33a,TronVin,2,Mon May 18 00:01:17 2015 UTC,"Negative feedback from fans? Since when did WB/DC care about negative feedback from fans? The same people that cast Michael Keaton, Heath Ledger, Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Jesse Eisenberg, and Ezra Miller care what the fans think?"
DC_Cinematic,36b33a,gbm0102,2,Mon May 18 00:05:50 2015 UTC,"They were casting choices, do you not remember to the last two Christopher reeves movies or the Superman returns or Batman forever and Batman and Robin, the gap in years before another came around that made a difference."
DC_Cinematic,36b33a,IwishIwasGoku,4,Mon May 18 00:10:45 2015 UTC,"I doubt that DC/Warner held back due to fan reactions. After all, they announced Miller as Flash, a move that was controversial to those (including Stephen Amell) who thought DC should combine the TV and cinematic universes. More than likely, Green Lantern had not been cast yet. But that was about eight months ago. There's a good chance that the seven members of the JL have been cast and can surprise fans at Comic-Con."
DC_Cinematic,36b33a,TheJoshider10,2,Mon May 18 00:27:57 2015 UTC,"I think Amell is down for combining the universes but his reason for being upset was because they announced it right when the Flash series started. He said he respects them keeping it separate, but they should have let the current Flash find its footing before announcing a brand new one on top of it. And he certainly has a point."
DC_Cinematic,36b33a,gbm0102,0,Mon May 18 05:39:30 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with it. They just didn't have to announce he was cast end of story. Leave that for group announcements on the other heroes (come on, a Flash/Green Lantern reveal with both walking out on stage would be awesome), instead they just went ""oh Ezra Miller is the Flash"" when to many, their own Flash had just started on screen. At least fucking wait a season or two, it's not like there's a rush."
DC_Cinematic,36b33a,krispness,1 point,Mon May 18 14:48:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with both of you. I think that it would have been better to announce the entire JL cast at SDCC after explaining to fans and press in attendance how the two universes would be separate, allowing them creative freedom in both realms. But I suppose on the bright side, both Flash and Arrow have done phenomenally well without the help of a large movie franchise. I'm sure they'll continue to do well on their own in the future alongside the DCCU."
DC_Cinematic,36b33a,dc_fanboyforever,1 point,Mon May 18 14:53:32 2015 UTC,Definitely looks to fit the part but doesn't have much credit for what would amount to a movie of his own.

DC_Cinematic,367nw2,Bodie293,6,Sat May 16 23:26:08 2015 UTC,"If this is true, I'm fine. It's going to be great spectacle and we need a threat in this film that the trio have to combine to fight at the end.   I don't get the criticism that it's too soon for Doomsday. He's a mindless beast, he's not Darkseid. Make the CGI awesome. Make him fuck shit up. Make the Trinity kick his ass at the end.   Yes Doomsday has the killed Superman legacy in the comics but this is the film world. I'm for one really excited to see him on screen with modern CGI."
DC_Cinematic,367nw2,BatmanDavey1986,0,Sun May 17 15:05:11 2015 UTC,"My bet is that the villain will actually be Bizarro, but with maybe more of a Doomsdayish take one him.  Either way it's basically like making the heroes fight the Hulk.  It seems like a waste to use Doomsday so soon, and this idea of using Zod's body, or one of those kryptonian embryos could fit well with a Bizarro origin.  Kryptonite has the opposite effect on him then it does with Superman so dose him up on some of that, and he'll be a good sized threat that will take the entire Trinity.  Also I think the point of Doomsday is that you have to kill him, and after MoS I think they need a more sympathetic villain that they need to find a more humane solution is dealing with."
DC_Cinematic,367nw2,Justice_Prince,6,Mon May 18 05:45:18 2015 UTC,This sounds like El Mayimbe is still reading that fake script that got around last year...

DC_Cinematic,367nw2,Mudkip4567,2,Sun May 17 13:25:48 2015 UTC,Metallo or parasite are better suited as the muscle for this movie Doomsday should always be after JL forms. If you want a mindless beat you could always use blockbuster!

DC_Cinematic,367nw2,buhlakay,2,Sun May 17 01:12:41 2015 UTC,"Doomsday himself isn't that great of a villain, but if they were to use him, it should be in a superman solo movie. Using the character that literally killed Superman in the comics in a team-up movie that sets up Justice League cheapens an already bland character."
DC_Cinematic,367nw2,BatmanDavey1986,5,Sun May 17 01:52:08 2015 UTC,"But you need a credible threat that Superman,  Batman and Wonder Woman have to end up fighting. I think Doomsday is a fine and worthy choice for that. It doesn't cheapen the character."
DC_Cinematic,367nw2,JimmyBing,4,Sun May 17 15:09:12 2015 UTC,"From what's being said, Lex Luthor is the villain and Doomsday would be the muscle. I don't think that would be a bad way to approach it."
DC_Cinematic,367nw2,buhlakay,2,Sun May 17 17:41:37 2015 UTC,I'd vastly prefer Metallo.
DC_Cinematic,367nw2,SpaghettiSauced,-6,Sun May 17 16:59:11 2015 UTC,"Batman takes on Superman. Lex Luthor is in the movie. Wonder Woman is in the movie. Aquaman is in the movie... Now, Doomsday? How long is this flick going to be? I just don't know how they're going to weave it all together. I'm excited, but damn... Maybe use Doomsday in a post-credits scene to set up a Death of Superman later? I dunno."
DC_Cinematic,367nw2,buhlakay,11,Sun May 17 02:22:16 2015 UTC,"Aquaman is only supposed to be a glorified cameo. Lex, Bats, and Supes are likely going to be the forefront of the movie. I doubt we'll even see WW in full-on costume until the climax/final battle. And there is no straight confirmation Doomsday is going to be in it."
DC_Cinematic,367nw2,BatmanDavey1986,5,Sun May 17 03:38:05 2015 UTC,Doomsday requires almost zero character development.  Just a few scenes of him fucking shit up to establish him as a threat.
DC_Cinematic,366euh,BattleReadyPenguin,11,Sat May 16 16:34:04 2015 UTC,Yea that would be great it was really pro Batman in the first teaser I hope they release a second that's pro superman maybe people talking about him in a good way and Batman seems sort of like the villain.

DC_Cinematic,366euh,decrepidactyl,2,Sat May 16 17:45:37 2015 UTC,I like this idea a lot. The flipped perspective is always really cool too see between Batman and Superman. - and maybe have trailer #3 be Lex heavy.
DC_Cinematic,366euh,MiQBonafide,2,Sat May 16 23:18:42 2015 UTC,People who work in films said there were 3 other variants for these teasers/trailers and they are better paced than the one released. Maybe the others reveal too much as they say WW and Aquaman is teased.
DC_Cinematic,366euh,KingofZombies,2,Sun May 17 03:13:03 2015 UTC,"I think the second trailer will be the same but with people talking about Batman and how theyre afraid of him and stuff and then Superman faces batman and says: ""Tell me... have you seen the sun from inside? You will!"" or something like that"
DC_Cinematic,366euh,ninjartist,3,Sat May 16 19:20:49 2015 UTC,"Or maybe they change what they say at the end of the teaser. Batman: do you bleed? Superman lands facing superman with red eyes Superman: No, but you will"

Actually really surprised that it had such mixed reviews compared to the Marvel films, since MOS to me is clearly better than the likes of both Thor films.   I think what went against it was the fact that people had a predetermined idea of what Superman should be like and just wouldn't except a new Superman, even though the film wasn't a film about Superman but how he becomes Superman. The ending of the film to me anyway set up a much more traditional version of the character, with Clark joining the Planet, the glasses etc."

I've been called a troll and downvoted for criticising Man of Steel, and it's fair to say both sides have resorted to blindly insulting the other.   I personally found the movie underwhelming and a disappointment, although there were positive aspects.  I'll confess I'm amused by the assertions that MoS was ""realistic"" that some supporters make, or that there is more depth in MoS than in the MCU. However as a DC fan (and a Marvel fan too), I'm really looking forward to an expanded roster for the DC cinematic universe. We're finally moving beyond Batman and Superman, and there are a wealth of great characters that can finally hit the silver screen. Sure, Dawn of Justice is about those two characters, and it's going to be tricky for them to handle a fight that can't really be won by either side (and that the audience knows where this is the case), but I have my hopes they'll pull it off.  Hopefully they learn from the mistakes of MoS ("

Looking forward to BvS, but no denying that WB have a heck of a challenge on their hands in maintaining tension and balancing insight with the expected fight scenes. Looking forward to seeing Wonder Woman finally!"
DC_Cinematic,3655s4,stuartrmarshall,1 point,Mon May 18 19:55:06 2015 UTC,"Word. When I made several posts on IMDB last month for the simple act of discussing MoS without trying to change anyone's opinion, the same 2-3 users who had been trolling the movie's board since MoS's release just came out repeating the idea that the film cannot be defended because it was objectively bad."
DC_Cinematic,3655s4,zhengyingli,6,Mon May 18 04:45:14 2015 UTC,I thought the final fight scene was the most visceral out of any fight scene done in any cbm

DC_Cinematic,362ycz,MAND3L8R0T,9,Fri May 15 17:54:20 2015 UTC,"I'm really hoping they'll show some footage from Suicide Squad at Comic-Con. They will have been filming for a while, and it would be a good place to really start hyping the movie.  Also. Welcome to Reddit!"
DC_Cinematic,362ycz,Anp3450,9,Fri May 15 19:58:00 2015 UTC,"My prediction is that we are going to get a Batman V Superman Official first trailer in August. Getting some early footage, or character reveals (perhaps Cyborg?) isn't too far fetched. I think an official teaser for Suicide Squad should be around September/October. If they do release anything from the Sqwad at Comic-con, I think it will just character stuff. - and like /u/TronVin said,this is the last comic-con before BvS. So, if Warner Bros. and Dc want to own it this year, they will have to release something delicious.  Bats V Supes Trailer #2 December? Than that leave 3 months before the release. But if they are going to be releasing 3 trailers, than I don't know if that makes sense. My math could be wrong on that."
DC_Cinematic,362ycz,decrepidactyl,6,Fri May 15 20:48:14 2015 UTC,There has to at least be a BvS panel. Maybe cyborg reveal? Hopefully some SS stuff

An unforeseeable announcement.

Like, maybe just send out Synder or Roven or Geoff Johns to tell fans about what they're planning, rather than having us interpret most of it from a statement that came from a shareholder's meeting.  On top of that, with Marvel potentially not showing up at SDCC this year, DC would be crazy not to take advantage of the situation and make the talk all about the new DCCU and Batman v. Superman."

But HD, proper lighting, and Color Correction will make him look badass! He'll be terrifying seeing him in his hoodie in the middle of the night!

DC_Cinematic,364k3f,brood92,3,Sat May 16 02:00:04 2015 UTC,DC's building a Live-action Multiverse.
DC_Cinematic,364k3f,MiQBonafide,2,Sat May 16 02:41:09 2015 UTC,"Two points I'd like to make. One, it's good to keep in mind that the tone that DC seems to be going for in the cinematic universe is vastly different from the TV universe (apart from films like The Flash and Shazam, perhaps, but that's complete speculation at this point). I think John Campea may have touched on this point in one of his AMC Movie Talks, but don't forget that DC's television shows air on The CW, and therefore can only reach so far without alienating its audience. There is theoretically more freedom in the cinematic universe for DC to do what it wants. My second point is that, although things may seem tidy for Marvel because all of their properties are attached to the same universe, they've come across a lot of continuity and storytelling problems. Hell, Agents of Shield directly contradicts The Avengers, and Whedon has pointed out that Coulson is indeed dead in the MCU and that the entire show is nothing but a Jacob's Ladder moment that he has at his point of death. And really, how many times has SHIELD been dismantled/brought back? How many times has Nick Fury died? I'm a fan of both Marvel and DC, but lets not be naive when throwing around claims of one being ""lazy"" and the other being ""easier"" to follow. Marvel may be easier to follow, but laziness sometimes plays a factor in that.  DC is planning on creating a multiverse, where their cinematic universe is separate from their TV universe. And seeing how many problems Marvel has run into while trying to combine both TV and film properties into the same universe, I think that DC is doing the right thing. This way, they get all of the creative freedom to make whatever they want; they can make the kinds of shows that appeal to viewers who watch The CW without neglecting the kinds of stories that they'd rather tell in the film medium. For Marvel, the opposite is true -- both films and television shows must follow along the same road. Diverging isn't an option, and this often hurts creativity. Ironically, Daredevil has always felt more like a DC property, in spite of Feige claiming that the MCU would never be ""dark"". Go figure.  As for the Batman trilogy, I seem to remember Nolan specifically stating that he didn't want his Batman films connected to a wider DC universe, which makes sense. At the time, not even Marvel could have guessed how well their MCU would turn out. Even Star Wars is getting it's own cinematic universe with the anthology films. But just because Marvel did it, that doesn't mean that DC can't learn from Marvel's mistakes and try to improve. I guess we'll just have to wait and see."
DC_Cinematic,364k3f,gbm0102,1 point,Sat May 16 03:18:03 2015 UTC,"First Iron Man came out in 2008, not 2005.  Second, Nolan wanted to make his own movies. He didn't want his Batman attached to any other characters. There were also talks since before the MCU of a Justice League movie with Armie Hammer as Bruce Wayne, Common as John Stewart, and others.   Marvel also has one big advantage that DC doesn't have, and that is Mickey Mouse's wallet. There is no wallet in the world like Mickey Mouse's. At one point Marvel was just trying to stay afloat, so they sold off the rights to their biggest characters, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, and others. You could make the argument that they too don't have 1 universe. DC has 2 active universes the TV universe and the movie universe. Marvel has 3, the MCCU, the X-Men, and The Fantastic Four. If Sony wasn't scrambling, Spider-Man would have been a 4th universe.  The Disney connection also gives them another advantage, access to ABC. One of the major networks. DC has WB, which only gives them the CW. Do you know how near impossible it would be to get Will Smith to do guest appearances on the CW? Up until After Earth he was against being anything but the lead in block busters.  Being separate universes also gives everything more freedom. Flash has been amazing this season, it looks like they're going to be at Flashpoint at the end of season 1. If they were connected to the movie universe, we'd have to wait until at least 2020. Who knows if the show would even be on anymore.  EDIT: Forgot about Gotham, but that show just feels like the writers read the bios of every Batman related DC character, and just tried to jam pack them all in together, without worrying if any of it makes sense. I'm surprised it wasn't canceled, and I wish it had."
DC_Cinematic,364k3f,Fricktator,1 point,Sat May 16 04:07:32 2015 UTC,Um. Iron Man came out in 2008. There are 3 Marvel TV shows.
DC_Cinematic,364k3f,your_mind_aches,1 point,Fri May 29 06:35:51 2015 UTC,"I'll keep this short and sweet. Marvel has a super successful movie franchise, and their cinematic universe is #1 in the game. Their television series, not so much. The rating just aren't there, and the television show lacks the talent, budget, and star-power that audiences expect after seeing the cinematic content.  DC/WB is kina the opposite. DC's television series are doing great, and without any support from a movie franchise. So why muddy the waters? Allowing the TV and movie universe to be one in the same hurts the TV show, no doubt about it."
DC_Cinematic,364k3f,thelastbrew,-3,Sat May 16 03:50:14 2015 UTC,"I'm sure most fans out there would agree that not making the Flarrowverse apart of the DCCU because they are great shows. And I agree with most of what you're saying.  Except for the new Batman. I don't see how the Nolan Batman could work in this new Superman universe, especially with Bruce leaving the cowl behind.   Also, MCU started in 2008 and has 3 current tv series (SHIELD, Agent Carter, and Daredevil), with 4 more incoming (Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, and Defenders)"
DC_Cinematic,364k3f,King-Grimm,-7,Sat May 16 02:11:37 2015 UTC,"woops dunno why i had iron man at 2005 in my head! Forgot about Agent Carter, never seen it.  With Batman I understand that the trilogy can't be included, my point had more to do with them wasting the opportunity for it to be linked to the DCCU if they had realised the potential of doing it back then. As far as I know DC never hinted at joined universe until after Marvel started theres. I could be wrong though as I didn't really follow much of the future plans back then. They made that mistake with Batman and I feel like they're making the same mistake now with the tv shows."
DC_Cinematic,364k3f,King-Grimm,-3,Sat May 16 02:22:21 2015 UTC,"Fair assessment. Had they began work on a connected universe before it ended we could have got a decent movie sooner.   They did have plans for a Batman/Superman movie dating all the way back to the Batman and Robin movie though. My understanding is they were iffy as to whether or not it would actually work considering the negative responses to B&R, Superman IV and later Superman Returns. The success of Dark Knight is what ultimately led us to where we are now. There was even a B/S poster in I am Legend.  They just never actually moved forward with it for some unknown reason"

Something that has never been mentioned in Man of Steel and something this Superman should really not know anything about or what it can do to him. In my mind they argue and eventually it becomes a fight. Obviously Superman doesnt take him seriously because he figures he cant be hurt. Batman with kryptonite in his glove throws a haymaker punch which Superman doesnt even try to evade. It connects and Superman goes flying through a window. Hes laying there shaken, wiping blood off his lip and looking up at Batman with a look of shock and pain on his face.  Superman: H-how...how did you do that?  Batman: (small smile) Im Batman."

DC_Cinematic,35wafb,Fricktator,4,Sat May 16 04:17:57 2015 UTC,I would say nightwing but him being in Titans probably won't happen
DC_Cinematic,35wafb,XboxNINJA17,3,Thu May 14 03:40:59 2015 UTC,"If we're talking DC shows to tie into the DCCU it's a bit complicated, since there already are DC shows, but not connected to DCCU.  I wouldn't mind seeing a Batfamily show, not just Batman, but the entire family. We could watch Batman developing with Tim Drake Robin, we can see Nightwing and Batgirl together. Maybe even see the Red Hood come back, and there could be a side story where every now and then where we see Damien training with Ra's, building to his eventual involvement with Batman. This will never happen...  Other than that, I would love a Booster Gold/Blue Beetle show, they aren't high profile enough for a movie, but a show about them goofing around through time would be awesome.  I think Green Lantern Corps could work fairly well as a TV show if it had a high enough budget. The Green Lantern mythos is so big that a solo movie won't do it justice. I would love seeing a show tackle the life in the corps, maybe have different episodes dedicated to different characters. One episode we can see Kilowog with some new recruits and then after that Kyle Rayner is trying to master all the emotions. There could be episodes based on the other corps as well though, to build the lore up for upcoming movies.   Teen Titans would be cool, but I doubt it with the actual Titans show coming out, but I would prefer one connected to DCCU.  Finally, I think Martian Manhunter would be tough to pull off, but kind of cool, he has so many aspects to his character it could be interesting. Maybe it's a detective show? Or a conventional superhero show, like how in Morrison's JLA it showed the day in the life of Martian Manhunter we can have episodes of him helping in poor places and then later he can be guarding the watch tower. It would be tough to pull off and reasonably wouldn't work, but it would be cool if it did."
DC_Cinematic,35wafb,MrCatEater,4,Sat May 16 00:21:23 2015 UTC,"That'd be a great idea, but I don't think Netflix would do that since they have a marvel show already. I think a Green Lantern show would be awesome. It doesn't even have to one of the main ones like Hal or John. It could be about the Green Lantern Corps as a whole. It'd be much easier too because it wouldn't intersect with the solo films as much because most of it would be happening in space or other worlds."

I like to see Robbie's Harley design as just another in the long line of Harley costumes. I mean she's worn a different one in every Arkham game but she's still the same person from the cartoons.

Seeing the Avengers come together was awesome, but 4 out of the 6 of them didn't even have superpowers.  Captain America is just the peak of human ability. Iron Man is just a guy in a suit of armor, amazing armor, but armor nonetheless. Obviously we need to have a good or decent plot and acting, but it loses something when they're just regular people.  The Justice League has probably 3 or 4 team members that could take on the whole of the Avengers and win. Whoever they throw in front of JL is going to have to be insanely powerful. That's going to make for a pretty epic battle. It's what superhero films are all about.   I mean imagine the Battle of New York, but with Superman using his heat vision, Flash zipping around fucking shit up, Green Lantern smacking guys around with constructs, Wonder Woman being all Amazonian, Cyborg unleashing some whoopass with his hand cannon and Aquaman impaling fools with his trident.

Batman will one punch black widow and Hawkeye. Will fight with capt like fights riddler or deadshot and beat him easily.

He doesn't beat them by our powering them he beats them by knowing how to manipulate them. For example in Justice League: Doom he knows that Flash won't turn down a speed challenge and devises the trap that locks the bomb to his wrist. He know how to break Hal's spirit and make him drop the ring, he knows Wonder Woman won't give up a fight no matter what.  Against the Avengers he would need knowledge of their power sources in addition to really getting to know them personally.

Superman is in the movie and Hans Zimmer is returning to score, so I would be surprised if his Superman theme isn't returning. It would be awesome if he evolves his theme over the next several movies, a la his work on the Dark Knight trilogy."
DC_Cinematic,35mgh1,z0r-el,8,Mon May 11 19:15:23 2015 UTC,It appears that DC has a chance to beat the MCU at this front. DC could establish consistent character themes from the beginning and keep using them for years to come. The MCU has been lacking that but I believe they're trying to fix it (e.g. you can hear a theme from Iron Man 3 in Age Of Ultron).
DC_Cinematic,35mgh1,TheJoshider10,4,Mon May 11 19:45:14 2015 UTC,"Eh, it doesn't matter what song is made for Iron Man, his 'theme' will always be something by AC/DC. I'm really happy they used them when he was introduced in Avengers. Gutted they didn't carry over into the third film."

This isn't just the next movie in the DCCU, it's much more than that.There are so many different character, that I don't think i have to worry about it. I do trust, and fucking stoked to hear what Han and Tom come up with, it is going be great."

I think it has the potential to be a lot more compelling, with a director driven approach I think the solo movies won't all be Justice League tie ins and the more subtle jokes will actually make it seem like there's something actually at stake. The entire Age of Ultron movie felt too light-hearted, we could have gone full apocalypse with Ultron bringing humanity to its knees. Instead he spent half of the time cracking wise. The weird humor really puts me off of the MCU, DCCU doesn't need to be that."

Dude has all the acting chops and depth, plus his physique and buzz cut  really nails it."
DC_Cinematic,357h78,TimTamDrake,5,Thu May 7 23:23:37 2015 UTC,"I think he'd be great, but my money (hope) is on Logan Lerman, he is live action Tim Drake in my mind."
DC_Cinematic,357h78,grntplmr,6,Fri May 8 06:44:10 2015 UTC,"I think they could easily get away with past Robins being pretty young.  People won't care as much if it isn't presented as something currently happening, and they can be a little vague as to just how young Dick, and Jason were when they started.  This is an older Batman so it's good to already have this preexisting bat-family.  Ideally place to start in Batman v Superman is for Dick to already be Nightwing, Jason to be thought to be dead, and Barbara to be in a wheelchair.  Maybe Dick blames what the Joker did to Jason, and Barbara on Batman so that would explain why they aren't close anymore.  In the first solo Batman film is when I think they should go for the first real live action Robin with Tim Drake.  I think he should be more like 16 or 17, and maybe Bruce tries to keep him in the cave training, or helping from a distance.  With the way the timeline is worked out there's actually a pretty big gap after Jason died where Bruce didn't want to take another sidekick, but somehow Tim changes his mind.  Now the villain we actually use for this movie is Jason coming back from the dead as Red Hood.  Now in addition to Red Hoods normal motivations he also sees it as his responsibility to save Tim from being another child who's life is ruined by Bruce.  This is meant to reflect the audience members who think there is something wrong with training a teenager to fight crime.  Now this will take some hell of good writing, but the end of the movie would actually have Jason giving him blessing for Tim to be trained, and with him the audience should be convinced as well."
DC_Cinematic,357h78,Justice_Prince,3,Fri May 8 00:24:30 2015 UTC,"When Tim shows up in Arkham City I didn't even think twice about whether he had been a kid Robin or not, I just thought ""oh look there's Robin, and he's adultish, cool"" and that was that. So I don't see why it can't just be that way in the cinematic universe. The only Robin I care about being young is Damien because it's interesting that he's a weird test tube science project, and his entire existence is morally skewed."
DC_Cinematic,357h78,grntplmr,3,Fri May 8 17:35:07 2015 UTC,"Why does he use Nolan's Batman as reference for his argument? From what I understand this cinematic universe is much different than that in the Dark Knight trilogy. This universe will embrace more of the comic roots than Nolan's. Characters like Supes, Aquaman, WW, and Killer Croc don't work in that universe either, yet they are/will be in the DCCU."
DC_Cinematic,357h78,clarencecarter12,4,Fri May 8 14:32:56 2015 UTC,"people see it as a watershed moment for Batman and the DCCU as a whole, they feel that since audiences have seen the dark, realistic Nolan movies that they wont be able to look past that world and see more comicy elements and take them seriously.   It can be argued that Man of Steel didn't really help to break this assumption, because it leaned pretty heavily in the ""dark, gritty"" direction, even though it was a movie about a superpowered alien. I do believe though that as the DCCU progresses the world will open up and those comic elements will be able to be presented without that veil of ""gritty""."
DC_Cinematic,357h78,grntplmr,8,Fri May 8 17:40:00 2015 UTC,i like john but his opinions on robin suck.
DC_Cinematic,357h78,majorasmaskfan,6,Thu May 7 19:49:44 2015 UTC,"I disagree. There are elements to Robin that just cannot work in a cinematic universe. Unless the character is altered significantly (have him over 18 and only fight crime after spending years training under Batman) Wayne comes off as a child abuser.   EDIT: If anyone can tell me why he can work, I'm all ears."
DC_Cinematic,357h78,doyleb3620,3,Thu May 7 22:28:54 2015 UTC,"it works cause fuck you comic books, who actually cares? we will joke about it on reddit but other then that the batfamily wont hurt box office, it make more people happy then it pisses off, the general public will either see more cool guys or just not care."
DC_Cinematic,357h78,majorasmaskfan,3,Thu May 7 22:37:19 2015 UTC,"You're right, the ""Fuck you, comic book"" logic works for a lot of things. How can Batman possibly master every form of martial arts in under a decade? Fuck you, comic books.   But with a young Robin, you'll get one of two things.   1.) It could get really campy, and the tone would be jumbled. If you want an example of how much a tonally confused movie can hurt box office profits, just look up Green Lantern.    2.)It could distort Batman's character. Yes, people don't have a problem with Batman being unrealistically talented at everything. People can suspend their disbelief for that. But people would have a problem with Batman putting a child in harm's way. And it would hurt box office numbers."
DC_Cinematic,357h78,doyleb3620,2,Fri May 8 00:36:36 2015 UTC,"What you're saying makes it seem like the general population has no idea who Robin is, when that's nowhere near true. Everyone knows the dynamic duo. They know that Batman has had a young sidekick for years now. There's no reason for audiences to suddenly get upset about it."
DC_Cinematic,357h78,CobaltMoon98,6,Fri May 8 02:07:42 2015 UTC,"Audiences do know who Robin is. But there's a difference between watching a cartoon where an animated 12 year old fights crime and watching a film where an actual 12 year old fights crime.   People don't actively concern themselves with the absurdity/uncomfortable nature of the scenario until it is shown to them in live action.  It's just like having Robin wear no pants. In a campy cartoon, fine. In a movie, weird."
DC_Cinematic,357h78,doyleb3620,2,Fri May 8 02:15:45 2015 UTC,"I think there is some room for it to work. If we get a young Robin character adopted by Bruce when he (robin) was young, but for some reason starts fighting crime on his own say around 16/17, i can see Bruce finding out and trying to stop him unsuccessfully, then deciding to train him properly.  Not sure how well that scenario would work, but I think it is plausible enough for audiences to accept. I would also like to see Dick Grayson as Nightwing, maybe in his early - mid twenties. Also think there is some merit to the joker killing Jason Todd and that being a reason for Batman's retirement."
DC_Cinematic,357h78,AlarmClockBandit,2,Thu May 7 23:49:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I was thinking. My vision of a cinematic Robin would be a kid of considerable talent in his late teens that's extremely motivated. Wayne then decides to provide training and balance for the kid's own benefit.  After a couple years of helping behind the scenes,  Batman lets him fight with him."
DC_Cinematic,357h78,doyleb3620,0,Fri May 8 00:28:40 2015 UTC,Agreed.
DC_Cinematic,357h78,KiaAngel,2,Thu May 7 20:34:23 2015 UTC,Batman should always be a solitary figure. The concept of a child crime fighter is ridiculous. It ruins the gritty realism of a man. who fights crime dressed as a bat!
DC_Cinematic,357h78,mrglow,3,Tue May 12 06:07:12 2015 UTC,"I normally agree with John and his opinions but not about Robin. I don't understand why Robin won't/can't work, its a movie, even better... A comic book movie! Say what you want about the tone and the realistic feel you get from the film but... Fuck that noise, I want to see a Robin!"
DC_Cinematic,357h78,LazyFM,-1,Thu May 7 23:49:08 2015 UTC,"Take a look at this comic before you say you want a young Robin.. Here, Alex Ross depicts a very realistic child dressing up in a Robin costume.   Would you prefer Robin to look less realistic here? Yeah, a lot of people would. Because the idea of a 13 year old being put in harm's way makes a lot of people uncomfortable."
DC_Cinematic,357h78,doyleb3620,2,Fri May 8 00:44:24 2015 UTC,"It sounds like it makes YOU uncomfortable, but i think the majority understand that they are watching a COMIC BOOK MOVIE. If i'm wrong here, i'm all ears..."
DC_Cinematic,357h78,LazyFM,-1,Fri May 8 02:50:40 2015 UTC,"I know people say, ""It's just a COMIC BOOK MOVIE"" a lot, but this sub in particular should know that comic book movies can be serious artistic endeavors.   Imagine if in The Dark Knight, Batman hops in the Tumbler and sitting next to him is a 12 year old in a domino mask. You can't tell me that wouldn't pull viewers out of the movie, and make them ask why the hell Bruce Wayne is bringing a kid with him.   The fact of the issue is that comic book movies can have serious tones, and the inclusion of certain elements (namely child endangerment) can break the suspension of disbelief."
DC_Cinematic,357h78,doyleb3620,1 point,Fri May 8 11:24:40 2015 UTC,"You keep bringing up Nolans movies but you fail to understand that in that universe a young Robin didn't exist, hence why you didn't see one.   The nolan batman movies have nothing to do with this new DC multiverse. So maybe in this new universe a young robin can work because... Fuck it, its just a movie"

For the record : I dig this Joker's overall look."
DC_Cinematic,3568vn,decrepidactyl,2,Thu May 7 16:22:11 2015 UTC,"Remember our ""first look"" at the Joker, that we got from Jared Leto showing the pictures to some girl on a phone? Well someone made a gif combining all pictures, and there's definetely no tattoos in there, specially the ""DAMAGED"" one on his forehead.  Then there's this picture too. I don't know if this one's legit, but if it is, there is no tattoos either."
DC_Cinematic,3568vn,MightyGreenPanda,3,Thu May 7 17:47:08 2015 UTC,"Like I said,  I'm not saying it isn't true.  There just hasn't been anything official.

But Who is to say the stuff on Jared's phone wasn't just Test-footage. The photos are blurry as shit,and could very well be just as easily decieving,let alone used as evidence."
DC_Cinematic,3568vn,decrepidactyl,2,Thu May 7 18:44:15 2015 UTC,You may be right about it being a test footage. I guess we'll end up knowing it sooner or later though.
DC_Cinematic,3568vn,MightyGreenPanda,4,Thu May 7 18:52:47 2015 UTC,I dare say 'some pictures on Jared Leto's phone' don't hold quite as much water as the first officially released photo.

And more than half of them weren't funny either, maybe because of this. It makes sense in party scenes etc, and it makes it good. I think Marvel should cut them too, IIRC it wasn't a problem in Captain America: WS.   It probably won't be a problem in BvS but we should wait for Justice League to see how DC will handle this. I mean when more light-hearted characters come, like Flash."

Something about it left me so deflated, and then the Suicide Squad coverage started and instantly perked me back up and I jumped into my DC books. I don't do the Marvel vs DC battle, but I am admittedly suffering from a bit of ""Marvel fatigue"" right now. As it has been said Daredevil is amazing and that is a different story, but the soft safe nature of the MCU, or at least The Avengers, has been wearing on me for a while, and the constant one-liners didn't help that."

DC_Cinematic,353org,YaHerdWithPerd,15,Fri May 8 05:26:23 2015 UTC,"I'm so fucking glad that FINALLY a lot of people are talking about this as a real issue now. It's been bugging me ever since the first Avengers film and it's only gotten worse in every MCU film (with the only one having any right to be so comedy focused being GOTG, for obvious reasons).    Daredevil, now that's where the good shit is at. Hands down the best thing ever in the MCU. In terms of story, characters, tone, it is just beautiful. The darker tone is very reminiscent of DC and what they appear to be doing.  I really hope people open up to DC films just because of how different they will be. Fuck all the complaints on the darker and grim tone. Do people honestly want the constant mediocrity that comes with the formulaic Marvel structure. There's a reason Daredevil is incredible and the first Iron Man movie is on another level. Good balance of humour and serious which creates a very balanced film.  That thread is also very good so well done for bringing it up OP. The way the top comment mentions it being like a weekend of Ultron is so true. This film did NOT feel like an Avengers movie in scale. It felt like another generic Marvel movie, because the stakes aren't high enough, the tone isn't dark enough, and they completely make a mockery of their villains by going ""hey, remember when we made Loki Hulk's bitch, let's do that again with the villain who wants to end mankind"". Absolutely laughable how little regard the villains are held in. Then Man of Steel has one of the best superhero villains ever because they treat him properly. Imagine the film ended with Superman kicking Zod as he says ""oh God no"" and then it sets up the audience to laugh. Yeah, not good.   I love to be entertained, and Marvel do it to a tee. I also love good stories, compelling characters, and I want more than entertainment right now. I'm fed up of the formula, and sure to some Man of Steel failed, but it felt like it was trying to bring more to the table. Heck, TDK blending genres and being more than a superhero flick is why the superhero genre is where it's at today. I feel the quality of the films has to improve and I think there's more chance of DC doing it based on the themes and details they want to explore (like how the effects of MOS will come into fruition here, with themes of death, segregation, racism, power corruption all coming into play)."
DC_Cinematic,353org,TheMurderCapitalist,15,Wed May 6 22:13:27 2015 UTC,"Speaking of TDK, I think fans forget that there was a lot of humor in that movie and franchise. Not just from The Joker, but from Alfred and Bruce and ""didn't you get the memo?"" Morgan Freeman. It just never threw off the tone like in The Avengers films. DOFP is another great example of using proper comedic moments in the middle of maintaining high stakes. It's not as simple as ""DC fans hate to laugh and want everything dark and gritty"". I just want to give a shit about why the heroes have to stop the bad guy. I'm not interested in a bunch of fan service one-liners to inspire millions of cute tumblr posts."
DC_Cinematic,353org,YaHerdWithPerd,9,Wed May 6 23:42:18 2015 UTC,THAT is the kind of humor I want in then new DCCU. I love all the Bruce/Alfred/Lucius banter in TDK trilogy
DC_Cinematic,353org,TheJoshider10,7,Thu May 7 00:18:39 2015 UTC,"""Any crazy ex boyfriends I should know about?"" ""You have no idea.."""
DC_Cinematic,353org,YaHerdWithPerd,2,Thu May 7 02:51:15 2015 UTC,"Bingo. It's the right type of humour that works.  However, both TDKR and MOS suffered with poor humour attempts. The Batman ""so that's what it feels like"" and MOS ""I think he's kinda hot"" just felt so out of place.  Although to me the funniest part of Man of Steel is when Mama Kent says something like ""we'll never leave you"" and the next shot is of them with the dog in the corner of the screen just sitting there. I just find it funny because it's clearly a different dog to the one who got saved in the tornado. Probably not even intentional."
DC_Cinematic,353org,JeweliusCaesar,2,Thu May 7 07:22:02 2015 UTC,TDKR had its moments. It's been about a year since I've seen it but I laughed at the mere idea of Thomas Lennon as Batman's doctor. I'll watch it again and offer more examples later.
DC_Cinematic,353org,TheJoshider10,3,Thu May 7 09:02:05 2015 UTC,Agreed. I've been unable to objectively talk about this anywhere on Reddit without eating tons of downvotes.
DC_Cinematic,353org,FreqFace,6,Thu May 7 22:59:47 2015 UTC,"The annoying thing is that to people who just browse on here it'll seem like a Marvel circlejerk, when really I just can't fucking comment on the quality elsewhere without the worry of downvotes (that isn't the issue, it's the fact that downvotes=no discussion, so commenting is a waste of time).   /r/movies I can comment on it if i'm in a lucky thread, but rule number 1 on voicing negative opinions on a Marvel film is to never go on /r/marvelstudios. It was actually a decent place until AoU came out.   I'm in the UK so saw it a week or so before people in America, someone asked me how I found it, and I gave my honest opinion and it got downvoted. By neckbeards who hadn't even seen the film. Nice."
DC_Cinematic,353org,TheJoshider10,6,Fri May 8 08:37:29 2015 UTC,"You summed up exactly how I feel and I'm glad because I thought I was going crazy. I loved the movie but they fucking ruined it with the one liners. Ultron was supposed to menacing and terrifying (from the trailers) instead we got goofy and not really scary at all, especially towards the end. What fucks me off most is that Ultrons best lines were from the trailers, basically none of which appeared in the movie. That first trailer had my skin tingling in excitement, that feeling didn't transfer over to the full movie. And that makes me a bit sad :( I would go as far to say the trailers were almost misleading.   And I'll tell you which bit pissed me of more than any other and basically sums up what I hated about AoU: Thor and Ultron are duking it out, Thor is being choked. ""Oh shit"" I think ""this is where shit is gonna go the fuck down, this just got serious"". I'm on the edge of my seat, I'm nervous, anxious even. Thor is losing... and what does he say? ""and.. I'm running... out of things to say"".... God fucking damn it! Why ruin the moment with a fucking joke. Fuck you. And guess what, Thor comes out of it unscathed."
DC_Cinematic,353org,FreqFace,8,Thu May 7 00:08:59 2015 UTC,"I completely understand where you're coming from, but I actually liked the personality of Ultron. I found his speech and ways such a contrast to his aims that if they handled him better, it could have been quite sinister as he wasn't being a cliche villain. Especially since Ultron is inspired by Tony so that's why he spoke like that.  But obviously, it's a Marvel film. It isn't going into much depth beyond good and evil. And of course, no one of important gets hurt, injured, dies and no one seems to give a flying fuck about the fact Tony built something that NEARLY DESTROYED THE EARTH.  You know, the audience reception to Man of Steel and Ultron perfectly show the difference between the franchises.  Man of Steel comes out: OMG ALL THIS DESTRUCTION WHY IS NO ONE ADDRESSING IT WHY DOES NO ONE CARE OMG   And the sequel will address it.  Age of Ultron comes out: yeah really happy with it, overall a good solid flick.  And the sequel probably won't address it. Sure, they still could, and i'd be over the moon, but something tells me they won't. Just like they skimmed over Tony's PTSD and completely ignored the drinking problem because Disney. They just won't let themselves get into extreme themes and issues like DC have the flexibility to, probably because of Disney."
DC_Cinematic,353org,TheJoshider10,3,Thu May 7 07:19:26 2015 UTC,"I completely understand where you're coming from, but I actually liked the personality of Ultron. I found his speech and ways such a contrast to his aims that if they handled him better, it could have been quite sinister as he wasn't being a cliche villain. Especially since Ultron is inspired by Tony so that's why he spoke like that.   I'll tell you one of my favourite scenes, when Ultron cuts off Klaws hand and then doesn't understand why it happened. I liked the innocence in contrast, like you say, to his aims. However, after that he descended into a bit of a joke. A well written villain would work like this, Ultron however was not. What's especially annoying is that the MCU is severely lacking in decent villains, and the trailers suggested we were going to buck the trend. Turns out, no."
DC_Cinematic,353org,FreqFace,3,Thu May 7 09:37:19 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I forgot about that. Quite a funny scene as well that I felt worked.   They lack decent villains because what they do is turn them into laughing stocks. Loki is battered by the Hulk, Ultron as well. Ronan is then defeated via dance battle (okay it worked in context of the film but still, this is a man who fucking bathes in the blood of his enemies and they still make him a laughing stock by the end).   I mentioned it already, but Daredevil. That is what we need more of. Easily the best villain we've had in the MCU yet. Fuck the whole ""but he had 13 hours to develop"" nonsense, even hearing about Fisk was enough. Even early on, that was enough. The way he is portrayed and set up made you know you cannot fucking mess with this guy.   Clearly Superman's mother becoming his girlfriend meant the good DC villain vibe rubbed off on him!"
DC_Cinematic,353org,TheJoshider10,5,Thu May 7 09:56:35 2015 UTC,"I too watched Daredevil, and yes Fisk was a villain who definitely bucked the trend. He was actually similar to Ultron in the sense he truly believed what he doing was for the good of his people, having almost a childlike mentality, but was written far far better. The difference is Fisk didn't shout ""oh God not again!"" * cue laughing from audience * when being beaten on by Murdock in the final scene.  I completely agree with Marvel treating their villains like a joke. Maybe this is the result of Disney buying them out? Because if I look back to the first IM, was Stane a joke? Nope, he was actually pretty damn menacing.  I liked Ronan and it's a shame he died because I would have liked to see more of him. There was humour in GOTG but it didn't seem to rub me the wrong way like it did in AoU, but I can't really pinpoint exactly why.  EDIT: Funny how you can have a better conversation in the DC sub about Marvel than you can in the Marvel sub."
DC_Cinematic,353org,Justice_Prince,2,Thu May 7 10:12:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, at the end of the film you just knew he was coming back with a vengeance. Not thrown away like a cheap, laughable villain, but a genuine threat who will come back purely because of what he believes in.   Potentially. After The Incredible Hulk, things got much more light hearted and generic feeling. Too much focus on humour, but obviously the box office revenue is there for it."
DC_Cinematic,353org,TheJoshider10,1 point,Thu May 7 10:21:36 2015 UTC,Well Civil War might address the destruction in AoU.
DC_Cinematic,353org,DerringerHK,1 point,Fri May 8 03:51:18 2015 UTC,"Only Daredevil addressed the situation at New York and none of the members of the team even cared about the fact Tony created Ultron after Thor chocked him. Everything after that was as if nothing even happened. No conflict, constant jokes. It just didn't work.   The best conflict in team ups to me is either conflict among the group or a full on team up to defeat the enemy. The first film handled it much better."
DC_Cinematic,353org,urgasmic,7,Fri May 8 08:26:45 2015 UTC,"Ultron for me felt like a walking punchline in the second half of the film, so I totally agree. When can Marvel create an intimidating villain that actually remains a threat right up until his demise. They did the same thign with Loki (though I feel he's a much better character) in Avengers 1. They took a cool villain and then made him the butt of a thousand jokes (a la Hulk picking him up and smashing him all over the place).  Excited to see the Russo brothers back to say the least."
DC_Cinematic,353org,YoureASoldierBodie,7,Thu May 7 00:16:59 2015 UTC,I personally haven't really enjoyed the MCU as much as it seems most people have. I'm hoping that DC's movies offer something different that I can get behind.

DC_Cinematic,353org,lame_corprus,8,Thu May 7 04:25:16 2015 UTC,"Removed? Gee, I wonder why.  Seriously, though. OP had a point. I liked AoU, I thought it was a fun movie, if less impressive than the first one, but yeah, I didn't feel that Ultron was much of a threat. When he killed an avenger he didn't even do it himself, he used a jet. So much for Ultron Prime, supposedly made from vibranium. I also thought his fights with Thor and Hulk were severely lacking. One we barely saw, the other was over in an instant.   Compare to Winter Soldier or Man of Steel. Both movies had the protagonist have clear, extended fights against the antagonist. Rather than spend the whole movie fighting mooks or drones, we were given awesome face-offs that we were promised in the trailers. These were fights that mixed the spectacle with the personal, making them more visceral and intimate.   Which is one reason why my HYPE is through the roof for BvS."

This is like Cap not having his mask on, or showing Tony Stark without his mask on. The only people who have their masks on all the time are those who are trying to hide their identity.  When he's in battle, or sniping someone, I need the mask on no doubt. But it doesn't trouble me if it's off for a few scenes, and certainly the leaked set pictures show no more than a potential scene or two"

But yes, clearly alley means good (especially since the author noted as such) and by beard he obviously meant one movie requires him to have a beard and the other doesn't."

DC_Cinematic,34tldj,MiQBonafide,3,Mon May 4 21:50:02 2015 UTC,The gloves could be on just a little tight. Lighting etc.
DC_Cinematic,34tldj,KALEl001,-1,Mon May 4 22:50:41 2015 UTC,that harley drawing is atrocious
DC_Cinematic,34tldj,seancurry1,-20,Mon May 4 22:33:41 2015 UTC,I just don't think this is going to be a good movie at all. I have the sinkingest feeling about all of this.
DC_Cinematic,34tldj,TheMurderCapitalist,21,Mon May 4 15:34:17 2015 UTC,Based on still shots you're going to write off an entire movie? Jesus Christ...

DC_Cinematic,34vv81,JimmyBing,15,Tue May 5 00:03:55 2015 UTC,"As long as they keep continuity with the characters, and the physical aspects of the DCCU in line (like strength/power levels) then the actual tone of the individual films can be whatever the director wants. Life isn't consistent so they don't need to be either. It'll be comic-like with different books having different artists, but obviously all occurring in the same world."
DC_Cinematic,34vv81,grntplmr,8,Tue May 5 01:16:41 2015 UTC,"This would be great. Make Batman v Superman dark drama, make Suicide squad an action but with some comedy, Woner Woman serious, the flash very comedic etc. Gets boring watching the same film but with different characters like Marvel does."
DC_Cinematic,34vv81,BarbequeMeat,3,Tue May 5 09:46:10 2015 UTC,"This, seriously the average movie goer doesn't give a shit about consistency in tone and neither do I."
DC_Cinematic,34vv81,drakesfolly,7,Tue May 5 23:37:11 2015 UTC,"Tone wise, I want each director to take some liberties where they see fit. I want the DCCU to have variety and have a little bit of artistic feel with their films.In return some decent continuity within the universe.  It's great if they have an end game, but I don't think it is necessary. Just make me believe you,the studio exec's, know what you are doing, and we will get along just fine."
DC_Cinematic,34vv81,decrepidactyl,4,Tue May 5 00:42:43 2015 UTC,"Good point,  I love the Marvel movies,  but you can see they're all are drawn on the same canvas"

DC_Cinematic,34vv81,JimHolden,0,Tue May 5 06:48:07 2015 UTC,They are going for a dark and gritty path. They even compare the Suicide Squad to The Dark Knight.
DC_Cinematic,34vv81,JimHolden,-2,Tue May 5 06:52:28 2015 UTC,This is the tone of the DCCU.
DC_Cinematic,34vv81,Tom-ocil,5,Wed May 6 00:09:20 2015 UTC,"Nah, I want these characters to be badass and serious (with some light comic relief), not one-liners for the entirety of the film."
DC_Cinematic,34vv81,actin_and_myosin,-1,Wed May 6 14:13:52 2015 UTC,"Nah  Well....yeah, the tone he jokes about there is the tone of the DCCU thus far."

DC_Cinematic,34tn63,Bodie293,5,Mon May 4 13:45:39 2015 UTC,"Here I was worried they weren't going to put Boomerang's logo anywhere on his long-coat. They're subtle but I like it. - and His jacket definitely says ""CAPTAIN"". Okay, that makes it a tad better that it is a track jacket. Also, hiding Harley's true colors, and her signature diamonds, her bat. Margot killing the look. Awesome.  Fucking hell, that cast photo was such a tease. I love it, make's the true reveal that much better.Good on them.  edit: Totally forgot, Brilliant move to make Croc practical. He looks great. Can't wait for the final product."
DC_Cinematic,34tn63,decrepidactyl,2,Mon May 4 15:51:48 2015 UTC,I love everything... except Croc. Looks a little too The Thing from the last set of FF movies.  I'm still going to hold out hope it looks good on screen.
DC_Cinematic,34tn63,fuckthiscrazyshit,6,Tue May 5 01:50:24 2015 UTC,Scott Eastwood looks suspiciously like Steve Trevor.
DC_Cinematic,34tn63,DerringerHK,5,Mon May 4 14:08:54 2015 UTC,I think he is
DC_Cinematic,34tn63,DerringerHK,4,Mon May 4 14:15:30 2015 UTC,It was rumoured for a while but I think this is as close to confirmation as we can get without an official statement.
DC_Cinematic,34tn63,toolonglurking,-1,Mon May 4 14:18:06 2015 UTC,The U.S. flag on his chest is facing the wrong way. That might be because this image was inverted before posting but a U.S. solider would not wear it like this. It could mean Scott is the antagonist of this merry bunch of misfits

DC_Cinematic,34tn63,toolonglurking,2,Mon May 4 16:34:54 2015 UTC,Good catch on the ejection port to rule out inversion. Rick Flagg's flag is facing the right way in the team pic.
DC_Cinematic,34tn63,FreqFace,2,Mon May 4 17:38:05 2015 UTC,"Seeing Will Smith in this is just weird as hell. I mean, he's gonna kill it, but has he ever done as ensemble movie before like this?"
DC_Cinematic,34tn63,BatmanDavey1986,2,Mon May 4 19:48:36 2015 UTC,Independence Day would qualify I think.
DC_Cinematic,34tn63,JimmyBing,2,Mon May 4 20:11:15 2015 UTC,Is it kind of strange that a lot of the special forces guys are wearing uniforms that don't all match?
DC_Cinematic,34tn63,ChamplooSam,-3,Tue May 5 15:30:35 2015 UTC,"Call me picky, but the blue on Harley is killing me. Not to mention that every time she gets a new look its less clothes. That's just my opinion though."
DC_Cinematic,34tn63,BatmanDavey1986,3,Mon May 4 16:33:28 2015 UTC,"Sex is a part of her character.  She uses it, abuses it and quite frankly in some instances seems to really enjoy it."
DC_Cinematic,34tn63,gmark109,4,Mon May 4 20:12:34 2015 UTC,This may the most clothes she's worn in a new costume in a long time.

That, or he's just trying to maintain a low profile. How he'll accomplish that with a red spandex clad Will Smith following him everywhere, I'll never know."
DC_Cinematic,34sy8q,GentlemanGearGrinder,8,Mon May 4 08:42:33 2015 UTC,Captain Boomerang looks like a total piece of shit....I love it!
DC_Cinematic,34sy8q,WinterAssassinR,11,Mon May 4 12:55:20 2015 UTC,Is it me or is Captain Boomerang looking more like Tom Hardy than jai Courtney

DC_Cinematic,34skwp,DerJakane,-3,Mon May 4 10:36:32 2015 UTC,Is that a stunt double? It doesn't look exactly like Robbie. Could just be the makeup

DC_Cinematic,34tqm1,Jangwin,5,Mon May 4 14:16:43 2015 UTC,She looks way less scary here. Perhaps they're going with the split personality thing and this is June Moone while the promo picture was showing the Enchantress.
DC_Cinematic,34tqm1,TronVin,7,Mon May 4 14:34:02 2015 UTC,Saying the words 'The Enchantress' her appearance changes from blonde-haired June to black-haired and costumed Enchantress   Makes sense.

DC_Cinematic,34rs2w,MiQBonafide,17,Mon May 4 00:25:50 2015 UTC,Holy fuck... that looks way better than mask off.
DC_Cinematic,34rs2w,Lukeazade11134,10,Mon May 4 00:43:00 2015 UTC,This looks better than the main image. I hope we get promos of all of them alone like this.
DC_Cinematic,34rs2w,MrCatEater,3,Mon May 4 00:43:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think this did him justice, hopefully it can do the same for Croc and Harley, because then I would be fully on board."

DC_Cinematic,34rs2w,Huntersteve,3,Mon May 4 00:27:05 2015 UTC,His gun is awesome.. Love the crimson gold look. I would prefer a black mask not just for thr look but camo wise it makes sense... but i won't complain.  Looks great.
DC_Cinematic,34rs2w,mental_reincarnation,8,Mon May 4 00:49:02 2015 UTC,I like it. But the mask feels a bit off in terms of colour with the rest of the look. A darker shade like grey could work.
DC_Cinematic,34rs2w,junaidhussain,12,Mon May 4 00:48:18 2015 UTC,"It is, you can tell by the lighting, his hands almost look white because it's been brightened up. I'm sure it will look great on screen."
DC_Cinematic,34rs2w,BigFents,2,Mon May 4 01:03:24 2015 UTC,Looks pretty awesome.
DC_Cinematic,34rs2w,invisiblack,2,Mon May 4 00:48:12 2015 UTC,"Oh man, looks so much better with the mask on. Hopefully he has it on for most of the film."

DC_Cinematic,34rs2w,Mordkay,2,Mon May 4 22:55:55 2015 UTC,Is it just me or is his glowing reticle eyepiece on the wrong side?

DC_Cinematic,34rs2w,MrMono1,1 point,Mon May 4 06:07:30 2015 UTC,Probably the picture is flipped?
DC_Cinematic,34rs2w,CaptainMobius,1 point,Mon May 4 01:56:29 2015 UTC,I think the words on his collar would be reversed if that were the case. I'm curious as to why they put it on the left eye when its always been right in the comics.
DC_Cinematic,34rs2w,DerJakane,7,Mon May 4 02:09:57 2015 UTC,Maybe so it's not on the same side as the inevitable Deathstroke mask.
DC_Cinematic,34rs2w,sreeck,5,Mon May 4 02:38:45 2015 UTC,"Possibly to make it easier for him to see while wearing it? Everyone has a dominant eye, maybe his right eye is his dominant. Source: I can cover my right eye and still see just fine, but if I cover my left, I'm effectively blind."

DC_Cinematic,34rs2w,KimJongPooonn,1 point,Wed May 6 15:44:19 2015 UTC,I'm not of this character. What is that thing on his eye? Is it marker for shooting?
DC_Cinematic,34rs2w,TheMurderCapitalist,2,Mon May 4 06:06:50 2015 UTC,2nd question. Yes. Helps with his aim.
DC_Cinematic,34rs2w,ovaltinejenkins88,-3,Mon May 4 06:35:35 2015 UTC,His fingers are white
DC_Cinematic,34rs2w,TheMurderCapitalist,7,Mon May 4 00:35:27 2015 UTC,Its either the flash from the camera or the lighting. Look closely and his fingers have a brown tint.

DC_Cinematic,34rj41,Justice_Prince,2,Mon May 4 00:00:51 2015 UTC,"Speaking of Arkham City, that is the perfect Harley costume for the big screen. I hope she ends up wearing something more along the lines of that in future movies with Joker."
DC_Cinematic,34rj41,PurpleZion,2,Mon May 4 00:07:36 2015 UTC,"The one just below that looks like tally marks. Who does she think she is, Zsasz?"
DC_Cinematic,34rj41,MrCatEater,3,Mon May 4 00:18:53 2015 UTC,I assumed they were just tally marks of how long she's been in Arkham.  It could just be done with marker too.
DC_Cinematic,34rj41,Justice_Prince,2,Mon May 4 03:29:56 2015 UTC,"Hers seem to make a bit more sense given how they look as though they were done by herself with them being upside down to us. Also one of them says Puddin and has a heart with an arrow through it, so I guess it's just typical Harley style, but done with tats this time."
DC_Cinematic,34rj41,MarkHoppusBruh,1 point,Mon May 4 01:01:42 2015 UTC,Didn't Ayer or someone like that specifically say that they wouldn't be in the movie?
DC_Cinematic,34rj41,junaidhussain,2,Mon May 4 01:00:47 2015 UTC,"They're upside down she she may have just written on herself with magic marker.  On the front leg one is just tally marks, and the other says ""pudding (heart)"" and the I can't read the word under it, but probably says Harley.  Like I said could be done with marker, but the idea that she would tattoo these on herself facing the wrong direction is kinda interesting."

Slipknot looks good I like the design, with the two ropes across his front although he'll die.. Boomerang looks good but a bit thuggy with the gold necklace.. Croc I think looks great.. Entrantress is quite dark.. But good.. Rick Flagg.. Bit boring but good enough..  Deadshot looks good.. Obviously can't have his mask on as will smiths face is a money maker at least in promotion..  El diablo..looks like he came of the street.."

Looks fun, fun, fun, and I love that she's not super overly sexualized like she is in the comics.  Enchantress looks like a freak, which is rad.  I didn't even know Katana was in this movie, but she looks like she stepped right out of the comics.  Only disappointment? The boys. They're all just sort of... wearing clothes. Not even Boomerang's muttonchops and Killer Croc's crociness undo it, IMHO.  FINAL THOUGHTS: This confirms that Joker isn't a part of the Suicide squad, and who's that on the far right?"
DC_Cinematic,34rj41,phantompoo,11,Sun May 3 23:11:52 2015 UTC,Diablo on the far right?

On one hand, it's very grounded and I could see real people dressing in these clothes. On the other hand, it looks like really bad, last minute cosplay.   Harley Quinn is the one I like the most, as she doesn't seem explicitly sexualized like she has been since the Arkham games. Can anyone tell, do those Adidas boots have heels or is she just on her tippy toes?"

DC_Cinematic,34rj41,MrCatEater,3,Sun May 3 23:06:13 2015 UTC,Do we know if Killer Croc is being handled with makeup or CGI?
DC_Cinematic,34rj41,DerJakane,6,Mon May 4 00:06:23 2015 UTC,So the question remains...where's Scott Eastwood?
DC_Cinematic,34rj41,FlamingPanda77,8,Sun May 3 23:08:49 2015 UTC,I'm pretty he's playing Deathstroke who's not a part of the team.
DC_Cinematic,34rj41,Mordkay,5,Sun May 3 23:21:25 2015 UTC,"Or he's playing secret agent Grayson, which lines up with the image of his tombstone we got earlier, and lines Ip with Bruce/Batman being in this"
DC_Cinematic,34rj41,DerJakane,3,Sun May 3 23:35:53 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I wouldn't mind this, but I really don't want Dick actually dead, make it Jason Todd and bring in the Red Hood later on."
DC_Cinematic,34rj41,Justice_Prince,2,Mon May 4 01:03:34 2015 UTC,Thats my thought exactly
DC_Cinematic,34rj41,flabbyplatypus,3,Mon May 4 00:15:06 2015 UTC,Holy fuck this is amazing :)
DC_Cinematic,34rj41,zhengyingli,6,Sun May 3 23:17:40 2015 UTC,"This looks so awesome, really dig killer Croc."
DC_Cinematic,34rj41,Lukeazade11134,2,Sun May 3 23:47:42 2015 UTC,Harley looks cool and the Rest is pretty good too . I am digging boomerang and am really happy deadshot has his wristguns
DC_Cinematic,34rj41,CaptAmerica42,2,Mon May 4 00:18:32 2015 UTC,I thought The Thinker was going to be on the team.
DC_Cinematic,34rj41,Tom-ocil,2,Mon May 4 03:33:14 2015 UTC,"To be honest I like Harley and Enchantress the best, I reckon Margo and Cara were great casting on that part. Deadshot looks dope, and the rest look ok as well."
DC_Cinematic,34rj41,CaptAmerica42,2,Mon May 4 04:52:02 2015 UTC,"Harley looks way less disgusting than I've feared. Not that I didn't like Leto's Joker's looks, but I didn't want the same look for Harley."

DC_Cinematic,34rj41,boomkinburger,5,Sun May 3 23:59:06 2015 UTC,"I don't particularly care for any of them, honestly looks like the CW version of Suicide Squad."

DC_Cinematic,34rj41,Fricktator,5,Mon May 4 00:21:08 2015 UTC,There is a CW version and this looks 1000x better.
DC_Cinematic,34rj41,lame_corprus,3,Mon May 4 02:56:29 2015 UTC,The CW Suicide Squad sooks. Looks like a J Crew catalog.

DC_Cinematic,34rknf,CannibalIowa,6,Mon May 4 01:37:50 2015 UTC,"Alright, here are my thoughts on this. - Also, /u/invisiblack has brought to my attention, a much better resolution of this pic. http://i.imgur.com/Td4HabW.jpg   Harrrley looks fucking great. She just seems so joyful and full of energy. I love the subtle J-zipper on her jacket, and her ""Puddin"" tattoo. The hand-cuffs is a nice touch. Really happy with her. Enchantress. I have been excited to see what they were going to go with for her. I got to say, l love it. Now to see if they actually end up doing the magic shtuff. Captain Boomerang is definitely rocking the mutton chops and looks great. What I don't dig is the jogging jacket... and I think it says ""CAPTAIN"". Katana. Wasn't expecting her, so that was a cool surprise. She looks good I guess. Although a bit lacking in size, Killer Croc is looking absolutely awesome. Honestly, was expecting them to go more human. Rick Flagg looks like a military man, so that's good. Not much more to him,really. This El diablo is an interesting take.I am intrigued, look forward to seeing what they get him doing in the film. Adam Beach was throwing me off for a bit, couldn't figure out who he was. But after noticing so many different lines/and ropes, he is definitely Slipknot. Awesome, I like it. Deadshot. He looks so generic. No face accessory , and all this chest plate and arm/knee guards, and spandex underneath. I am not digging it one bit. edit : Just saw the full costume with mask and everything. I went from being disappointed to ""Okay, that's fucking cool"" really quickly.    Overall, as first impressions, I have some issues, but still fucking hyped to see this film. I can't wait to see how it all goes down."
DC_Cinematic,34rknf,KyleRaynerGotSweg,10,Mon May 4 01:07:30 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/B2mEPGs  Don't worry about Deadshot, he's got the mask!"
DC_Cinematic,34rknf,KnightOfTheStupid,5,Mon May 4 02:07:04 2015 UTC,"Still missing Ike Barinholtz, Jim Parrack, and Common from those who have been cast, so we gotta wait to see them in costume sadly. Is it confirmed Parrack is Deathstroke or was that a rumor? Still hoping for Common as Black Manta, and I'm thinking Barinholtz is going to be Riddler."
DC_Cinematic,34rknf,Justice_Prince,5,Mon May 4 01:48:51 2015 UTC,"Parrack as Deathstroke was only a rumor. I agree with Barinholtz as Riddler, he's got the look for it. If Common is Manta then he might just be used as a background character in Belle Reve and will possibly escape at the end of the film to set up Aquaman's solo movie."
DC_Cinematic,34rknf,august_west_,2,Mon May 4 04:35:53 2015 UTC,"I remember hearing a rumor that Jackie Earle Haley was going to play The Thinker.  It would be cool to still see him in the movie, but I was hoping to see him on the team."
DC_Cinematic,34rknf,Justice_Prince,2,Tue May 5 03:49:19 2015 UTC,I've always thought he'd make a great Jervis/Mad Hatter.
DC_Cinematic,34rknf,confusedmortal,2,Thu May 7 03:59:44 2015 UTC,"He could pull that off as although I kinda like Mad Hatter being shorter.  Now I'm trying to imagine if Mad Hatter could actually work as a lead villain in a Batman film.  He's one of the more out there villains, but mind control is a pretty effective weapon."
DC_Cinematic,34rknf,TheWruceBayne,5,Thu May 7 04:06:44 2015 UTC,Jared's joker pic and now this? I'm hella ready for this movie!
DC_Cinematic,34rknf,TrashTongueTalker,4,Mon May 4 00:14:12 2015 UTC,I love the New Suicide Squad blue/red Harley Quinn that we are getting. Many people are pointing out her white shirt but not recognizing the jacket that she has on is split down the middle in color.
DC_Cinematic,34rknf,decrepidactyl,5,Mon May 4 00:53:42 2015 UTC,Looks great. Still no word on who Parrack and Berkinholtz are playing?
DC_Cinematic,34rknf,usainboltron5,2,Mon May 4 02:08:57 2015 UTC,"The word going around is that Parrack is Deathstroke, and Berkinholts is Hugo Strange. Not sure if this is true, but it seems to be the most passed around."
DC_Cinematic,34rknf,andamonium,6,Mon May 4 02:49:06 2015 UTC,I am loving Harlery of course. She definitely steals the pic. I am a bit disappointed by Killer Croc's size though. I was hoping he'd be massive. I mean they're doing killer croc. Just make him nine feet tall. I am glad that Joker is not part of the squad. Seems like they're sticking with some of the source! Everyone looks kinda Arrowverse-y to me though. Wish we could see the campy suits at some point.
DC_Cinematic,34rknf,usainboltron5,10,Mon May 4 00:14:11 2015 UTC,Yeah but they can get away with doing whatever size and iteration with killer croc because in the comics he changed looks/sizes pretty consistently. it was part of that constant mutating/degeneration of his disease.
DC_Cinematic,34rknf,Justice_Prince,4,Mon May 4 02:56:46 2015 UTC,Works for me. Hopefully we get to see some evolutions over time. Here's hoping DC is playing the long game.
DC_Cinematic,34rknf,usainboltron5,3,Mon May 4 04:32:03 2015 UTC,"I didn't expect him to be that big, but it would have been nice to see him a head above everyone else."
DC_Cinematic,34rknf,_ASAK_,1 point,Tue May 5 03:38:52 2015 UTC,Yeah that would've been more doable and fine.

DC_Cinematic,34rknf,_ASAK_,2,Mon May 4 01:50:51 2015 UTC,"No, I mean that Killer Croc should be massive. Not a lil human crocodile thing."
DC_Cinematic,34rknf,grntplmr,3,Mon May 4 01:56:28 2015 UTC,"He can continue to mutate as the universe ages, as long as he doesn't get killed off."
DC_Cinematic,34rknf,XxVaynexX,2,Mon May 4 02:00:17 2015 UTC,Okay cool thanks I didn't know that
DC_Cinematic,34rknf,alwaysupvoteTRUNKS,2,Mon May 4 02:13:24 2015 UTC,"It's not a guarantee or anything, but it has happened like that in the books before. I'm interested to see where they take him"
DC_Cinematic,34rknf,Justice_Prince,3,Mon May 4 02:26:38 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen anyone mention this, but notice that Boomerang has made, what looks to be, his own duct tape ankle holster. Next to the rest of them, it's juxtaposed so well."
DC_Cinematic,34rknf,grntplmr,6,Mon May 4 04:11:03 2015 UTC,"I'm unfortunately not as familiar with DC as I am Marvel; it would help if they had something similar to Unlimited. That being said, here are my neophyte thoughts:  -Killer Croc is ugly af but the makeup job is light years ahead of Dr. Connors in The Amazing Spider-Man  -I'm glad they didn't oversexualize Harley Quinn. Hers is the pic I've been anticipating the most. I like the marker drawings on her legs, I like that she seems to be a Joker fangirl instead of perhaps a legitimate partner, which is as it should be-The Joker is a sociopathic monster and only partners if it suits his whims and schemes. I'm sure she's only a toy to him.  -Captain Boomerang, huh? Looks like one of those stereotypical brit gangbangers.  -The guy to the left of him, is that Deathstroke? Whoever he is he looks ready to fuck everyone over.  -Will Smith's helmet is goofy but the outfit as a whole kicks ass!  -So that's Joel Kinnaman  -Idk who this Enchantress is but she's creepy af  -Katana(?) looks like cannon fodder  -This El Diablo guy, he looks like cannon fodder too.  I don't think very many of these people are walking away from this movie alive. Harley, Boomerang, Croc, maybe that Enchantress, probably the guy on the left. Oh, and Will Smith and Rick Flagg of course.   I'm very much interested in how this sets up Cadmus and how Batman is involved. I'm going to squeal if this is a stealth Batman movie."
DC_Cinematic,34rknf,MiQBonafide,3,Mon May 4 08:53:11 2015 UTC,"I think the girls are all safe.  They can't kill Harley, they probably have plans for Enchantress in the eventual Dark Universe movie, and I guess they could kill Katana, but it would be a shame to see her wasted, and I'm hoping to see her in a Birds of Prey movie some day.  El Diablo, and Slipknot are probably good as dead.    Killer Croc is cool, and they might want to use him a Batman later, and he's not much more then a brute so it wouldn't be that much of a loss, to lose him.  I give him about a 50/50 shot of surviving   If they want to bring the Rogues together against Flash then they need Boomerang alive, and if they want to do a second Suicide Squad movie then they'll likely want to keep the Deadshot Boomerang rivalry going.  Deadshot is safe because you don't hire Will Smith for just one movie.  I actually think there's a good chance Rick Flagg will die.  He's not really that interesting of a character, and it would actually be more interesting to see how the team would go on without their assigned agent."
DC_Cinematic,34rknf,canadianplayer007,0,Tue May 5 04:22:18 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you pointed out Harleys doodles as possibly being marker and not tattoos, I'm hoping for that.   I'm surprised they didnt do the cowl for Deadshot vs the full mask, I'm actually a little disappointed and thought it would be a good compromise with Will Smith. The full mask hints to me that there will be a lot of mask off time.   I don't see Katana dying, I figure that Slipknot will and El Diablo seemingly will, only revealed later as having survived. I bet we will get a couple of true redshirts that tag along to fill the death quota."

DC_Cinematic,34rknf,LazyFM,2,Mon May 4 00:12:23 2015 UTC,"I feel like the track jacket look might be another promotional only thing, similar to the Joker tattoos. They are a SQUAD after all, so I could see that changing for the film."
DC_Cinematic,34rknf,grntplmr,2,Mon May 4 02:09:15 2015 UTC,"As a fan of Arrow, I'm overall digging the Gritty Camp aesthtic Ayer seems to be employing. Joker with 'Damaged' inked across his forhead is still completely dumb and not in a fun way.   Overall I can dig it, Croc and Diablo prolly aren't part of the team proper. Slipknot is a total readshirt. Enchantress looks like the girl from the Ring."

Normally, it would be two things: being expendable and deniability... but you lose deniability if the Squad is flanked by legitimate soldiers... and both are ""expendable"" depending on the threat level (no one wants their soldiers to die but everyone understands its a part of the job).  Is it just their powers or something about the threat or what?  Interesting to speculate...."

DC_Cinematic,34rknf,Justice_Prince,4,Mon May 4 09:06:17 2015 UTC,The Joker isn't in the Suicide Squad. He'll most likely have a small role in the film.

DC_Cinematic,34r3nh,TheUnderAvgAmerican,10,Sun May 3 23:37:27 2015 UTC,They're probably just going to reveal the date of release for a preview of a preview of an official Deadshot picture.  Nothing panties-explode worthy.

DC_Cinematic,34pagr,HarishChengaiah,19,Sun May 3 08:34:51 2015 UTC,So the fact that they have a 'filmmaker driven focus' not a 'buisness focus' and are accepting the best scripts are bad things? What Marvel are doing is great but I'd much rather see DC let filmmakers make the movies they want rather than forcing total cohesion on them.
DC_Cinematic,34pagr,Fgge,10,Sun May 3 09:09:27 2015 UTC,Story over continuity. DC 's new motto.
DC_Cinematic,34pagr,MiQBonafide,6,Sun May 3 10:12:28 2015 UTC,"Story, character and canon over continuity. That;s how the New 52 franchise worked for the past 4 years and still working the same way, and WB is trying to implement the same."
DC_Cinematic,34pagr,MiQBonafide,7,Sun May 3 10:19:52 2015 UTC,"That's how DC was born. Think about it. DC's shared universe in the comics was a bunch of different characters created by different writers/ artists, and some are from different publishers bought by DC like the Charlton comics and Shazam/Captain Marvel.  Whereas Marvel's foundation was laid by mostly Stan Lee's works. (I know he wasn't the only guy)."
DC_Cinematic,34pagr,dc_fanboyforever,5,Sun May 3 10:32:58 2015 UTC,"thank julie schwartz for mixing and matching characters and Gardener Fox for Justice League and all the crisis writers for thinking ahead of time and making a multiverse  Brave and the Bold, cartoon has his and miller's name drop in baseball match."

DC_Cinematic,34pagr,Fruit_Pastilles,6,Sun May 3 13:54:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly, they CANT go out and make comedies and light hearted films in a similiar tone, people would get very bored and just hate on them even more for copying. I cant wait until some super dark batman shit."
DC_Cinematic,34pagr,Master_Kiwi,5,Sun May 3 18:28:36 2015 UTC,"That basically sums up why we love Batman.   ""Why are you a Batman fan?""  ""Because he does super dark Batman shit."""
DC_Cinematic,34pagr,BarbequeMeat,2,Sun May 3 21:47:09 2015 UTC,Exactly. I also like him because he is kinda crazy in his own Batsy way.

DC_Cinematic,34l3r7,notrorschach,8,Sat May 2 03:18:33 2015 UTC,The cape kinda reminds me of the cape/hoods the Gods in Azzarellos run are wearing.
DC_Cinematic,34l3r7,Mordkay,6,Sat May 2 03:46:43 2015 UTC,"if this is legit, it is magnificent"
DC_Cinematic,34l3r7,rebelinthought12345,4,Sat May 2 03:11:16 2015 UTC,Totally digging it.   Does anyone else think they should reference Atlantis in the Wonder Woman film? As the creations of Poseidon? Ultimately it will depend on what they are going for with the Amazons...
DC_Cinematic,34l3r7,phantompoo,2,Sat May 2 04:33:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know if the Atlantians in DC have that close of a relationship with Poseidon, but I'd actually use them pretty heavily in the Wonder Woman movie.  For a while now my idea for the film as been about Ares trying to start a war between the Amazons, and Atlantians so he can feed off the psychic energy.  Wonder Woman, and Aquaman having a quick fight likely, and Circe, and Queen Clea likely playing roles as supporting villains."
DC_Cinematic,34l3r7,Justice_Prince,1 point,Sat May 2 13:21:41 2015 UTC,I think aquamans trident is supposed to be poseidons neptunes isnt it?   Edit: its the Same really
DC_Cinematic,34l3r7,DerJakane,1 point,Mon May 4 12:55:26 2015 UTC,That cape looks like it has more functionality than just keeping her warm. Curious if this is how she will fly. Or maybe it's an invisibility cloak.
DC_Cinematic,34l3r7,WildEndeavor,-1,Mon May 4 22:54:29 2015 UTC,Yes that's exactly what she was missing. Not practical armour but a Cape.
DC_Cinematic,34l3r7,brownix001,4,Sat May 2 15:33:26 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, what do you think is unpractical about that armor?"
DC_Cinematic,34l3r7,invisiblack,3,Sat May 2 16:06:51 2015 UTC,She has invulnerable skin but she's still affected by sharp objects. The skin that's being shown is a design flaw. Batman and superman get full body armour but wonder woman will still be impractical. And no this is not about sexism or anything like that. Just sheer unbiased observation. This is in all comic books but I hoped the movies would have a full body attire. The DC shows and marvel movies seem to do this in a reasonable but still sexy fashion. Natasha is a spy so sleek back attire makes sense. But if you are going to make wonder woman a classic Warrior then maybe have a longer skirt for the thighs so she can still move but somewhat protected.
DC_Cinematic,34l3r7,brownix001,3,Sat May 2 17:29:05 2015 UTC,"But, she's either insanely powerful or literally part God. It doesn't really matter what she wears."
DC_Cinematic,34l3r7,gmark109,0,Sat May 2 21:27:49 2015 UTC,"So how does that change anything? She still is affected by swords and stuff. In comics blunt objects don't damage these super powered being but sharp objects do. Like there isn't internal issues or anything. By your logic superman and wonder woman should go around in loin cloths waiting for someone to stab them. Armour is armour, make it proper or it's useless. Leather armour would work better for this design. For movement and slight protection. Lot's of protection if magic was used."
DC_Cinematic,34l3r7,brownix001,1 point,Sat May 2 23:41:28 2015 UTC,"Not sure about wonderwoman but Superman is definitively not vulnerable to sharp objects. I mean i See your Point but amazonians have always been depicted like that . Also i dont see you complaining about aquamans Outfit . Furthermore Look up male greek soldiers of ancient, they wore pretty similar stuff."
DC_Cinematic,34l3r7,DerJakane,1 point,Mon May 4 13:06:53 2015 UTC,Ya I guess it's similar. I assumed the skirts were knee length but there are several that aren't. Aquaman's pic isn't showing full body. There are many ancient civilizations that had arm protection but not front body. I assumed that's what they were going for with Aquaman.
DC_Cinematic,34l3r7,brownix001,1 point,Mon May 4 19:34:23 2015 UTC,She's not a medieval  Knight.
DC_Cinematic,34kxqa,huskman,17,Sat May 2 01:38:44 2015 UTC,"Would be pretty genius, but I'm glad it probably isn't true. I prefer Affleck over Bale, even if it's so far only based on looks alone."
DC_Cinematic,34kxqa,PurpleZion,14,Sat May 2 02:31:43 2015 UTC,Then bale's Batman is completely fucked
DC_Cinematic,34kxqa,SheWantsTheMe,11,Sat May 2 02:35:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll take 6'4"" Batfleck over 6'1"" Bale-man"
DC_Cinematic,34kxqa,MiQBonafide,8,Sat May 2 03:01:54 2015 UTC,"The issue I've always had with Bale's Batman being part of a larger DCU is that for the most part he's just a well trained martial artist with some pretty funky gadgets. He's not a detective, definitely not the World's Greatest at any rate, he's clever but he's not as smart as comic-book Batman.  I love the Nolan Batman films, but I just can't see that Batman standing side by side with Gods and holding his own."
DC_Cinematic,34kxqa,tunnel-snakes-rule,-3,Sat May 2 04:16:27 2015 UTC,"definitely not the World's Greatest at any rate   I don't see how this one is going to be any better since he is fighting Superman, he obviously isn't that good of a detective if he thinks Superman is evil. I hope I'm wrong but I'm getting the feeling that we are trading in a martial artist Batman for a ""super high tech suit got tools for everything"" Batman."
DC_Cinematic,34kxqa,DatPiff916,1 point,Sat May 2 17:46:12 2015 UTC,"I have similar concerns.  Any Superman/Batman film that seems to have a focus on them beating the crap out of each other isn't something I care to see.  That being said, going by Man Of Steel, Clark wasn't Superman at all during that film, at least not the way I see the character so I'll hold my judgement until we get a good look at both characters."
DC_Cinematic,34kxqa,tunnel-snakes-rule,6,Sun May 3 01:21:41 2015 UTC,That would be one of the best troll ideas ever. Would make it even better if the director never told Ben otherwise and revealed he was Hush at the end of filming. Similar to what they did in Usual Suspects.

DC_Cinematic,34ey6l,Mudkip4567,4,Thu Apr 30 17:31:06 2015 UTC,Honestly I have no problem with it being a little more focused on Deadshot and/or Harley compared to the other characters.

We used new, original music because A) it would have been difficult / would have sounded crappy to nab the music out of the original trailer while deleting the original vocals, and B) it is more original this way and not just a repeat of the same parodied/copied trailer over and over again. Secondly, ""tell me"" is in Kevin Conroy's voice, from a Justice League episode. ""Do you bleed?"" and ""you will"" are both myself doing a sort-of-okay Kevin Conroy impression because I couldn't find good enough pre-recorded lines for those parts. :)"

Amazo could be an interesting threat that could hold his own against the league."

It kind of sounds like Civil War I guess, but I more mean that Superman let all of these heroes come out, he's seen as a God to them and it's putting a lot of people in danger. Batman has to stop it from happening by taking Superman down a peg and making the newer heroes see he isn't invincible? It could let us set up lots of heroes from the beginning and it would be cool to see people who wouldn't have a chance at their own movie in this universe. Just a thought!

Anyone can go online at anytime and watch any trailer they want. What if they released 6 trailers that give a back story for all of the heroes that haven't had their own movie yet.

DC_Cinematic,348jgc,Grant638,3,Wed Apr 29 05:39:07 2015 UTC,Thin is a problem but my biggest gripe is that recent wallers have been too young. I feel like seeing an older Amanda Waller gives her more of a reason to be a controlling paranoid bitch and it seems like Viola Davis is going to kill the role

Sure the general public may not, but film fans and Marvel fans will know of him and how he's pretty much at the top of the MCU food chain. They've openly said their main men.  DC don't have that, at least they haven't made it public. Snyder appears to be up there but that's because he's been in the limelight whilst people behind the scenes haven't been public.  I feel there must be some direction to place these films where they are, the timings and so on.   End of the day? I'd rather have each individual film feel visually different with strong scripts and basic connections to the other characters rather than generic popcorn flicks that do nothing different like Thor: The Dark World. Most MCU films are the same generic (but fun and highly entertaining) superhero madness, with none feeling big blockbuster, visually strong, and story driven. I feel DC will try and do that. To some they may have failed with Man of Steel, but you can't deny what they tried doing with the character is stronger and just feels bigger in scale than most Marvel movies. What they did with Daredevil (excellent show which everyone should watch), in terms of focusing on the character and delivering a more realistic world, is what DC want to do."
DC_Cinematic,34b70k,TheJoshider10,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:37:15 2015 UTC,"In what way was what they tried doing with Kal-El in MoS any deeper or different than what MCU did with Tony Stark in Iron Man (with the personal battle against his own past) or Steve Rogers in Winter Soldier? That's a serious question - I've watched MoS twice and both times it felt like a typical comic book blockbuster. It didn't feel as realistic as Dark Knight - probably more on par with Dark Knigh Rises in my personal opinion. I'm hopeful for BvS, to see what WB can do with DC's full roster, but I think they'll struggle if they're going to try and match too much suspension-of-disbelief characters like Superman and Wonder Woman with too realistic a tone. They are fundamentally unrealistic characters!"
DC_Cinematic,34b70k,stuartrmarshall,3,Sat May 2 18:58:38 2015 UTC,"Being an aspie, what grabbed me most about MoS was the portrayal of young Clark as someone with special needs who drew negative attention from those surrounding him. Trusting his father's advice on not revealing himself to the world until he's ready, Clark had a coming out party when he surrendered himself to the government for him to be handed over to Zod, placing his trust in the former. As you know, since revealing yourself to be different or possessing a different ideology in our world could prove dangerous at times, Clark's decision of revealing himself really required far more trust than many of us are willing to give to anybody.  There was also an element of hope on Jonathan's side that one day Clark would be accepted by the world without being harmed. After Jonathan's death, it took Clark 15-16 years to act good on that hope. Hope takes patience, in short. What's even better is that BvS will not be abandoning these themes, as the teaser indicated, not all warmed up to Superman, which means Jonathan's fear might come true in some form. It's just like hinting escalation at the end of Batman Begins, and paying full dividends in The Dark Knight. None of the MCU solo sequel films really have that, yet."
DC_Cinematic,34b70k,zhengyingli,1 point,Sun May 3 08:34:53 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm glad you enjoyed MoS, and I hope you enjoy BvS. I don't have the same background, so didn't have the same context in which to relate to the movie. As such, my own impressions were largely negative.  Still, each to their own, and hopefully BvS is good.  I do fear that the approach that MoS attempted simply won't work for a team-based movie, and I'm more excited by seeing characters like Flash, Wonder Woman and Aquaman than a rehash of Batman and Superman again.  While not perfect, I felt that AoU did as good a job of balancing a large and diverse team as could be expected. (Although the director's cut is likely to be far more coherent). Hopefully DC realise that humour is in fact part of the real world, and in fact is a perfectly rational coping mechanism for some people in extreme situations.   They appear afraid of humour to be honest, and I feel like they are being backed into a corner by the MCU in their attempts to be too distinctive.   Ultimately, they are creating a series about an alien with extraordinary powers, a billionaire vigilante, some guy who can run really fast, a guy who can create amazing constructions out of the colour green, and an amazonian warrior.   MoS tried to convey itself as a realistic take on how people would react when they discovered we weren't alone in the Universe, and yet I honestly saw a better interpretation of the fear, shock and diverse reactions from the general population in Independence Day.  (I liked Independence Day by the way, for the movie it was trying to be)."
DC_Cinematic,34b70k,stuartrmarshall,2,Tue May 5 10:03:41 2015 UTC,"The user who commented said it pretty good with regards to Clark growing up. The whole idea of the acceptance, who Clark really is and so on just worked really well I thought. I'd say Steve Rogers from his first film is the next best thing in the MCU because I just loved how mentally he was always strong and wanting to do good, but physicality stopped him, so after his transformation he was the ultimate soldier in more ways than one.   I feel they've done a poor job with expanding on Tony Stark, personally. I wanted to see the drink issues in more ways than one laughter filled scene in Iron Man 2, but obviously this is Disney so this will not be happening. Then the way his PTSD was just buried under joke after joke in Iron Man 3 just left a bad taste in my mouth.   With the PTSD, the only way I can compare it is with the DC universe. So Avengers happens and Tony gets PTSD, but then the whole film is just joke after joke. Now in Man of Steel, thousands died and now there's people who think Superman is the second coming, a bad omen, essentially this film is dealing with themes about racism, segregation, discrimination, humanity and so on, and I bet it won't be joke after joke after joke. If it was, I would be massively disappointed.  I like my serious stories because they just offer a bet look at characters and such, so seeing big issues not explored properly to keep a focus on family friendly happy entertainment just rubs me the wrong way. Imagine The Dark Knight wasn't a strong look on a post 9/11 war on terror but was instead filled with joke after joke. The superhero genre would not be as respected right now."
DC_Cinematic,34b70k,TheJoshider10,1 point,Sun May 3 11:13:03 2015 UTC,"Oh, boy. How I wished that they went all the way through with exploring Tony's PTSD, but they never really explained how he got over it, or maybe they covered that in Age of Ultron but I've not seen it yet. And I couldn't believe that they put so much comedy into the last fight scene considering Tony assumed Pepper didn't survive the fall.   All of this is really depressing because I'm such a big fan of the first Iron Man, too, where the final battle didn't have any joke during its climax, and the theme of Tony getting rid of war profiteering was consistent throughout."
DC_Cinematic,34b70k,zhengyingli,2,Sun May 3 23:09:19 2015 UTC,"It's not mentioned at all in Age of Ultron.   I know what you mean. The first Iron Man film had a good balance with comedy and serious themes, but none of the films really did the same."
DC_Cinematic,34b70k,TheJoshider10,2,Mon May 4 17:22:09 2015 UTC,"I'm having a terrible time enjoying team-ups in general. Whether it'd be Flash/Arrow or the Avengers, the writers felt the need to turn the goofy comedy up to 11 whenever these characters meet up. Although the CW shows haven't had this symptom yet, ever since the Avengers, all phase 2 films have suffered inappropriate timing in comedy where the phase 1 films outside of Iron Man 2, really let the serious moments shine without wisecracks. In other words, in my own little conspiracy mindset, the success of Avengers caused phase 2 to mimic said film's goofier elements.  We probably need a Feige for the DCCU, but if they allow the directors unique visions to shine through at the same time, I'd be all for a leader. I'd prefer to have some individual films fail rather than having those films conform to a recipe, especially a recipe derived from a misinterpretation of the elements that actually caused such success in the first place.  Edit: The reason I brought team ups was because such an event seems to earn the most money when compared to solo films, and said solo films are then stripped of individuality for conformity in the name of insuring success when individuality is actually the most important aspect for solo films."
DC_Cinematic,34b70k,zhengyingli,1 point,Thu Apr 30 07:09:00 2015 UTC,"Interested to see what people think about this. Part of my concern with DC's films is that some people are going to be wrapped up in what Marvel's done that they'll hate Batman/Wonder Woman/Justice League, etc. no matter how they turn out."
DC_Cinematic,34b70k,S0ckHeaven,4,Wed Apr 29 19:30:05 2015 UTC,I'm not sure... I think people are ready for something different. The Ultron reviews have been sub-par.

DC_Cinematic,34b70k,S0ckHeaven,2,Wed Apr 29 20:05:56 2015 UTC,"Bombs critically, you mean. Because all their movies are making boo koo bucks! There is literally nothing coming out at the time of the Ant Man release. I think that movie is going to be a huge box office success. I also think it will do well critically but there's no way it doesn't make a ton of $"
DC_Cinematic,34b70k,YaHerdWithPerd,2,Wed Apr 29 20:09:25 2015 UTC,"Marvel is especially, but the genre has been a box office slam dunk the last few years. I looked at 2012-2014.  132M Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance 1.5B The Avengers 758M The Amazing Spider-Man 1.1B The Dark Knight Rises  1.2B Iron Man 3 668M Man of Steel 415M The Wolverine 645M Thor: The Dark World  715M Captain America: The Winter Soldier 709M The Amazing Spider-Man 2 748M X-Men: Days of Future Past 774M Guardians of the Galaxy 485M Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  Other than Ghost Rider, this is 3 years full of certifiable financial hits. Even though there is more than a few critically despised films in that list.  And you have to go back to Jonah Hex in 2010 to find a real monumental financial bomb.  The trend of the genre is very good news for WB/DC. And I think the contrasting tone that DC will be bringing back into the picture is good for the others as well. Help stave off potential fatigue."
DC_Cinematic,34b70k,stuartrmarshall,3,Wed Apr 29 20:42:09 2015 UTC,I agree. I think DC will actually help people to NOT get bored of Marvel. So in some ways the inclusion of the DCCU is an even better thing for Marvel. 2016 is going to be an amazing year.
DC_Cinematic,34b70k,S0ckHeaven,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:01:24 2015 UTC,"DC have iconic superheroes, and have a real opportunity with Wonder Woman to try something different with the female market. I think the danger is WB over rely on Batman and Superman, but I'm hopeful that once BvS is done, that we'll see a genuinely diverse roster.   My fear is that it feels like WB have been forced into a corner by going too far away from the MCU, and have had to go too serious/pretentious in an effort to differentiate themselves. That won't work with many of their characters, because the very nature of their powers/origins undermines the audience taking them seriously in an ultra-realistic movie.  Disclaimer: I like both DC and Marvel (my pull list skews slightly to DC). I loved AoU, Winter Soldier and GotG, and was generally disappointed by the shallowness of MoS if they were trying something different (it was okay if treated simply as a generic comic book blockbuster)"

DC_Cinematic,3421s5,leet1996,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:25:50 2015 UTC,Wait would justice league dark be apart of the official dccu? because i remember reading that Del Toro wanted use some of the tv actors and i way its been spoken about it makes sound almost seperate. So im just a bit confused about it really.
DC_Cinematic,3421s5,LasDen,3,Tue Apr 28 07:42:44 2015 UTC,They confirmed that JLD would be part of the DCCU. I think I read somewhere as well that they may want to bring Matt Ryan back to reprise his role as Constantine (I hope they do). The only DC movie I know off coming out in the foreseeable future that's not part of the DCCU is Sandman which is Vertigo.
DC_Cinematic,3421m1,_thedarkknight,6,Mon Apr 27 18:13:58 2015 UTC,I quite like the look. Except the 'Damaged' tat on his head and the teeth. It would be weird if this isn't the Joker's look. Why would they release it in the first place?
DC_Cinematic,3421m1,jadalaawar,3,Mon Apr 27 18:24:45 2015 UTC,"I like the teeth, and the thought that he has the grill because Batman went to town on him."
DC_Cinematic,3421m1,JimmyBing,7,Mon Apr 27 18:28:24 2015 UTC,For the record I had no problem with the look. But let's just say this article is correct. IF this was a photo released to celebrate 75 years of The Joker they just should have done a more iconic Joker look to pay tribute. Something like this is very believable as a movie look so if it was not their intention to make people think it was an official photo they did a bad job.
DC_Cinematic,3421m1,YaHerdWithPerd,0,Mon Apr 27 18:20:20 2015 UTC,They should have said in the tweet that it wasn't the look.and it could be ayer hasn't said shit

But as a source, Movie Pilot is shit and I wouldn't trust any of their ""news.""  EDIT WITH MORE THOUGHTZZ!! -- While the idea that the Leto pic was released as an homage for the Joker's 75th birthday is perfectly believable, I wonder why they'd bother with all the misdirection. Why add tattoos if they're only going to remove them later? Why not add all the ""HAHAHAHAHAs"" to the background, keeping it more in line with the comic pic they were mimicking?"

I also think Batman V Superman will be more colorful (not as much as VideoLab recolor) and the DCCU will get more colorful as the it progresses, with movies like Flash and Shazam (already confirmed to have a different tone from the other movies) being the most colorful of them."
DC_Cinematic,3401fe,invisiblack,7,Mon Apr 27 17:31:08 2015 UTC,I read in another article criticizing VideoLab that they (VideoLab) weren't serious. Sounds like they called on their bullshit and are copping out.

Maybe not as oversaturated as VideoLab made it though"
DC_Cinematic,3401fe,rebelinthought12345,10,Mon Apr 27 12:02:18 2015 UTC,"didn't you know? videolab also deliberately sabotaged mos colors to make it look more lifeless than it actually was. what videolab presented as ""original footage"" and ""unaltered"" was indeed altered and not at all original, so when they showed their recolored version, it would look better"
DC_Cinematic,3401fe,aircycle,8,Mon Apr 27 14:20:07 2015 UTC,"The purpose of the non-vibrancy of the film is because Snyder stated he wanted MoS to feel like it was happening in our world. He wanted to take a great departure for the look of his previous films. That's why mostly everything was pretty neutral in color, and there were a lot of hand held shots. He wanted the audience to feel like this was all really happening and was captured by cameras witnessing the events.   Whether you like that or not, is totally up to the individual, but that was it's purpose."

DC_Cinematic,33ymr7,WildEndeavor,3,Mon Apr 27 00:33:40 2015 UTC,I love MOS even before I saw the THESIS video. But that video was intelligently done. And it has made me love and appreciate the movie even more.

It doesn't change my mind that it isn't a very good film and that they fundamentally mishandled Jonathan and Martha Kent and subsequently mishandled Clark's character.  I know this is a particularly controversial film, particularly in this subreddit and my comments are probably not welcome but I do enjoy having conversations about the film."
DC_Cinematic,33ymr7,WildEndeavor,5,Mon Apr 27 05:09:57 2015 UTC,"No, your comments should definitely be welcomed.  You are being civil.  Recently, people who have problems with this film and the future of the DCCU have been visiting this sub telling people that they are either blind fanboys or butt hurt.  I'm all for artistic criticism, positive and negative, but some people here apparently think others are stupid, and their language is neither kind or condusive for conversation.  As long as you don't resort to name-calling, whining, or bashing without a reasonable, coherent argument, you should definitely be free to express your thoughts here."

I genuinely thought it was satire making fun of extreme MoS apologists.   You can't possibly think the guy who made Sucker Punch thought of any of that shit, can you? Also, let's not forget it was written by David Goyer who literally thinks liking Martian Manhunter automatically makes you a virgin and She-Hulk is Hulk's sex-toy (they're cousins). You really think those guys thought of all this deep, introspective shit?  Maybe you're just reaching to justify the fact that you like a flick that isn't very substantive? Nothing wrong with liking MoS. There are things to like about it. It's all a taste thing, but this gives overanalyzing a whole new meaning."

I haven't seen and enjoyed Will Smith in a movie in a while, so I'm hoping for the best here.

DC_Cinematic,33y4v3,WildEndeavor,11,Sun Apr 26 19:53:24 2015 UTC,Came here to say this. The messiah parallels started in MoS.

DC_Cinematic,33y4v3,JeweliusCaesar,3,Mon Apr 27 05:48:26 2015 UTC,Agreed. I love their steadfastness and commitment to their vision.

DC_Cinematic,33y4v3,Luis_Ignacio,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:34:00 2015 UTC,"I guess the difference is that the Messianic interpretation in BvS is the believable reaction of the masses, whereas the same interpretation in MoS was something working inside the narrative.   It's a flawed descriptor of Superman in either case, but in BvS that could work to the story's advantage."
DC_Cinematic,33y4v3,WildEndeavor,-3,Mon Apr 27 06:31:41 2015 UTC,"Actually i really dislike the obvious Messiah imagenery on Man of Steel. Because that image of him has always come from what he is and what he do, and not because an instagram filter loving director decided to show him floating in space like he was crucified, or talking in a looking for advice in a church. In this trailer, however, the Messiah theme seems to be an idea coming from people who just witness something impossible and try to find and explanation to it. Which is awesome, because it something i can understand and relate to. Something that gives a reallistic and very adult vibe to the story. And a mean grounded reallistic and mature, not instagram filter reallistic and mature.  Edit: ""I love how people are being upvoted for this comment now. After MOS came out, anything like this was immediately downvoted to oblivion. People sure have changed their tune, haven't they?"" - I love irony"
DC_Cinematic,33yfuu,agnosgnosia,9,Sun Apr 26 20:51:40 2015 UTC,There is differences though. Quicksilver is not as iconic as the Joker. But I agree with reserving the judgement.
DC_Cinematic,33yfuu,Aenovejo,5,Sun Apr 26 21:08:14 2015 UTC,Take it back to 2007 then. Everyone called Ledger's Joker a hipster and a hobo. It was about as vitriolic as the new one got.
DC_Cinematic,33yfuu,TronVin,10,Mon Apr 27 04:35:30 2015 UTC,I personally love the new joker look
DC_Cinematic,33yfuu,ReeferMaaan,7,Sun Apr 26 22:05:06 2015 UTC,"Or that Heath Ledger was so disdained at first. Before people jump down my throat about using such a generic argument, let me just explain a little bit: Joker is an intense, unpredictable character in the comics. He has countless different characterizations, plots, origins, and the reason that it works is the simple fact that when it truly comes down to it, Joker is a chaotic, bloodthirsty, utterly insane animal. All of these different variations and interpretations are a great thing because if they just tried to keep a consistent characterization, the base of the character is gone. He has to be unpredictable, both to the audience and to Batman. Otherwise, he's just a guy in a clown costume."
DC_Cinematic,33yfuu,Doctor_Arkham,2,Sun Apr 26 21:31:27 2015 UTC,"I think the difference is that people are more concerned with the look rather than the actor. With Heath Ledger, it was vice versa. As for me, I'm 50/50; enjoyed the overall look, but not the tattoos. I'll wait and see."
DC_Cinematic,33yfuu,zhengyingli,1 point,Mon Apr 27 05:47:56 2015 UTC,Quicksilvers look actually fit the character though.
DC_Cinematic,33yfuu,Huntersteve,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:50:27 2015 UTC,"Quicksilvers look actually fit the character though.   Pretty much no one was saying that before they saw the movie. The only thing anyone said was how much they hated his look. If there were people who liked that look, they were probably outnumbered 10 to 1 easily.  The only thing I can go along with is that the 'damaged' on his forehead is too much. Otherwise, I think it's alright. I mean they have to do something to differentiate from the other Jokers that have been portrayed. Maybe having the tattoos would make sense in the context of the movie?   I dunno. But what I do know is that making creative decisions is not easy. With something like this they have to make it different enough  so that the character has it's own identity, but they also have to make it close enough to the character so that it's not too far of a departure.   Sometimes there's a situation like with Batman begins where they do drastic departures making everything very realistic and audiences responded really well to it. I want you to rewind the clock to circa 2003 where Nolan was pitching his idea for a realistic Batman. No metahumans. No magic. None of that stuff. Can you honestly have said that it was going to be as big of a success as it was? No. Nobody could have.   A lot of the creative process in movies is just throwing stuff at the wall (aka audiences) and hoping, crossing your fingers so hard you crack your knuckles, that it brings back a profit. For the studios, that's the bottom line."

DC_Cinematic,33xo2c,Mudkip4567,2,Sun Apr 26 17:53:36 2015 UTC,Yes I read the first couple volumes of Aquaman. They are amazing. He is my favorite superhero. Geoff Johns really resurrected the characte. The storyline with Manta and the Others is perhaps his best comic arc ever and deserves a movie adaptation
DC_Cinematic,33y6xb,bigpig1054,5,Sun Apr 26 19:40:04 2015 UTC,Nice article. Definitely nailed the reasons why DC doesn't need to do a bunch of stand alone films before unleashing Justice League.
DC_Cinematic,33y6xb,WildEndeavor,1 point,Sun Apr 26 20:01:11 2015 UTC,"Right, and it doesn't take away the appeal of the stand-alone DCCU movies. It just wasn't a priority with DC like it was with Marvel.  I read an article a while back that speculated that all DC movies going forward would feature some kind of a team up, ala the ""Brave and the Bold"" comic series.  I don't think so, but I do think the advantage of a shared universe is for characters to pop up as needed. I think Batman can stand on his own, and he's proven that. Superman might need a team-up though, as his movies tend to underwhelm at the BO. A teamup movie with Wonder Woman might do him well. Same with Flash and Cyborg, etc."
DC_Cinematic,33y6xb,WildEndeavor,3,Sun Apr 26 20:31:47 2015 UTC,Another thing I think goes unnoticed about MOS is that the story was just the beginning of something much larger. I left the theater knowing exactly what his sequel films would be about. It was obvious it was the first chapter of his journey and they have a plan in place.
DC_Cinematic,33y6xb,tunnel-snakes-rule,5,Sun Apr 26 20:42:43 2015 UTC,"YES exactly. But everyone flipped out because he wasn't all ""hope and heroism and loved by the planet.""  He's an alien with literal godlike powers. He can burn our planet to the ground with his eyeballs, fly(!) faster than sound, and bounce bullets off his chest like they are made of nerf.  of COURSE the world would distrust him. Especially since he was ""in hiding"" until a trio of fellow aliens came and started blowing up the place."
DC_Cinematic,33y6xb,aircycle,3,Sun Apr 26 20:50:46 2015 UTC,"Now, it’s not just DC that’s trying to copy it with their comic properties, but Universal is planning on a shared universe featuring their various “monster” characters, Frankenstein, Dracula, Wolfman and so on.   Hey, Universal had a shared cinematic universe for their monsters back in the thirties!"
DC_Cinematic,33y6xb,tunnel-snakes-rule,1 point,Mon Apr 27 06:26:53 2015 UTC,"true, but I think the sentence is referring to the fact that Universal is trying to give life to that shared universe again. Essentially, they're having to work from scratch."

I'm sorry to the author but I and others do not think ""that's all that matters.""  I'm confused how someone could cite events in the comics and movies and then say the movie stuff is all that matters. That's really weird...  I guess comics just matter more to myself and others than they do to him. Everyone's got different priorities I suppose."
DC_Cinematic,33y6xb,MrCatEater,2,Mon Apr 27 23:41:55 2015 UTC,"A lot more people buy movie tickets than buy a comic. That's the meaning of ""all that matters.""  Of course it's not all that matters to you, but to the general audience Marvel beat DC to the punch in a lot of ways, even if comic fans know better."
DC_Cinematic,33y6xb,aircycle,1 point,Tue Apr 28 12:00:57 2015 UTC,"I know there are people that only watch these movies and have never read, and there are a lot of them. I think it's important to note that we do not approach this material in the same way. I don't think the General Audience should be viewed like someone reading a comic, because all they're doing is seeing a movie. I would hope if someone was truly interested in these characters and stories after seeing a movie that they would pick up a book. If they don't want to that's cool too, but they need to be mindful of how they sound when they are only going to use a popular movie as their only source material for discussions.   But if they were to mention something like ""Darkseid is a copy of Thanos"" I have no doubt that they would be corrected.   If some tried to fight that correction people would know that they unfortunately do not know what they are talking about, and as harsh as this may sound, at that point I wouldn't see any reason to continue talking to them. If they're not going to face facts and only use movies as a reference that is when trying to argue.   I feel the ""all that matters"" thing only applies to the general audience, and the general audience is a broad spectrum of people with some who only see the movies once in the theatre. These people might have the passing thought of the Thanos/Darkseid thing, but they probably wouldn't do anything about it. And if they ever did I'm sure they would accept the correction that Thanos is a copy of Darkseid because they would know just how extremely uninformed they are on this topic.   I hope some of that makes sense. I just woke up, and I don't know why but talking about people who only watch the movies and never read has always been interesting  to me."
DC_Cinematic,33y6xb,StarBeasting,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:53:10 2015 UTC,"I hear ya. But you also have to face the fact that the vast majority of people who will see Avengers, Justice League, etc, in theaters don't care about comics or anything. They are just there to take in a good summer blockbuster.  So when Darkseid makes his appearance, they're likely to think ""I already saw this when Marvel did it.""  Or when Batman fights Supeman they will think ""I already saw Hulkbuster vs Hulk. This is nothing new.""  And it will upset the comics fans who know better, but there's nothing you can do about it. Because if you go on a 10 minute rant about which came first, etc, you would get laughed at by the casual movie-goer that just wants to see a good movie.  tl;dr = DC is at a disadvantage, unfairly, but there's no use getting upset about it."

DC_Cinematic,33y6xb,Grant638,2,Sun Apr 26 21:25:34 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, they have been leaning more towards the dark. The Winter Soldier, Daredevil, and even Age of Ultron looks a bit dark. It seems like a natural progression, and I like it."
DC_Cinematic,33y6xb,invisiblack,2,Mon Apr 27 17:30:32 2015 UTC,Age of Ulton is not dark. It is very much in the same vein as the first and it had me laughing even more.

There have been so many iterations of Batman and the Joker, each their own special thing, each beloved by their fans. The beauty of these characters is that they are timeless and can be reinvented and reborn while remaining faithful to what they are. Jared Leto's version is no better or worse than Heath's or Jack's and I'm excited to see what this Academy Award winning actor can do.   Although I totally think that the tatted-up thug Joker is a cruel joke being pulled on all of us. Because that's exactly what the Joker would do."

Whose never caught red-handed.   Anyone who thinks a face tattoo is too try hard for someone like The Joker obviously hasn't seen Charles Manson.   Charles Manson carved a 'X' into his forehead because he claimed that as the world crossed him off he was doing the same. Later a swastika but he claims he isn't a Nazi.

DC_Cinematic,33ujed,thelastbrew,6,Sat Apr 25 22:14:19 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to believe that the disagreements in the DCU exist between Purists and the Open Minded. I think there is a vocal group of people out there who cling to the comic books or previous iterations in TV and movies and see no latitude for change. These are the Purists and the people most likely to dislike MOS. Their reasoning is generally that the new material doesn't match the old, and any deviation from the source material is a bad decision. The Open Minded, such as myself like and enjoy the creative spin WB & DC are putting on source material. We like creative interpretations and anything that brings something fresh and new to the table.  The reason you don't get this with Marvel is because they are doing it by the book, quite literally. Marvel isn't interpreting Ironman or the Hulk or any of the others. They are cutting from the comics and pasting to the screen. Not that this is bad. It is actually smart. The general public isn't as familiar with Marvel characters. We haven't been smothered with Ironman for 50 years on TV and movies so they were smart to stick close to the comic book origins. Superman on the other hand has had an active life on both so it is a little more of a challenge for WB & DC to put up something that feels fresh and new. I think after Superman Returns flopped, they realized that they can't just recycle old material. They have to be inventive with material.  So yeah, the Open Minded fans out there are happy and excited to see the new Joker and what this new interpretation of the character will bring to the DCU. The Purists dislike it because it doesn't match whatever image they have of the Joker."

At first look, the new Joker gave me a wtf moment, but once I really saw his eyes and everything else It drew me in.

I agree with everything else you said, but the MCU has made some pretty drastic changes, especially to villains. Iron Man is much more of a 'bad boy' in the movies than in the comics... The alcohol and women are accurate, but his comic character is considerably less abrasive. Thor doesn't share his body with Donald Blake, a pretty major part of his past in the comics. Hulk is more inspired by the 70s show than from the comics.   I'm not saying that these changes are bad... But the MCU is drastically different from the comics."

DC_Cinematic,33u8rf,agnosgnosia,1 point,Mon Apr 27 10:51:37 2015 UTC,"NDT has it twisted. It's Batman who answers to no one. That's what makes him Batman. He's arrogant and holds himself above all other institutions of power, including the Justice League. Superman welcomes power checking, and yields to the authority of the JL and even the US government, recognizing that his role as a public servant needs to hold up to public scrutiny.   EDIT: Unless, of course, you're ready Frank Miller's stupid-ass DKR, which seems to be the prominent source material for the upcoming movie. Despite being well written and thought provoking, that book features some of the WORST characterizations in comic book history."
DC_Cinematic,33u8rf,recesshustlerkid,4,Sun Apr 26 15:08:20 2015 UTC,"It's Batman who answers to no one. That's what makes him Batman. He's arrogant and holds himself above all other institutions of power, including the Justice League. Superman welcomes power checking, and yields to the authority of the JL and even the US government, recognizing that his role as a public servant needs to hold up to public scrutiny.   The characteristics you described here are from Frank Miller's DKR."
DC_Cinematic,33u8rf,invisiblack,2,Sun Apr 26 18:43:55 2015 UTC,"Only in part. DKR doesn't capture the consequences of Batman's neurosis. Instead, it glamorizes his narcissism and reads like reverence to Batman's martyrdom. At the same time, it sets Superman up as a government patsy, which I think is a stretch from holding one's self accountable to the will of people. This is what you get when a Batman fanboy writes a story."
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,Melanismdotcom,28,Sat Apr 25 00:33:43 2015 UTC,"Except for the tattoo on his forehead, I think this is pretty good. I doubt the Joker will be without a shirt for very long in this cinematic universe anyways."
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,mental_reincarnation,8,Sat Apr 25 00:47:19 2015 UTC,Right there with you. It seems a little over stated. Maybe the tattoos were just for the photo shoot. Otherwise I'm diggin it.
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,WildEndeavor,6,Sat Apr 25 02:59:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe he's without a shirt or just in a robe (and underwear, lol) for most of the film then he gets broken out at the end or something and puts on his suit"
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,your_mind_aches,17,Sat Apr 25 02:08:08 2015 UTC,Wow!!!!!!!
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,XboxNINJA17,11,Sat Apr 25 00:39:37 2015 UTC,Happy 75th Birthday to the Clown Prince of Crime!

DC_Cinematic,33rtml,Jkbdm,18,Sat Apr 25 03:06:37 2015 UTC,My first reaction- joker has been in prison for a very long time. I love it but for now the casuals will hate it. Dc is not playing it safe. I like it.
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,WildEndeavor,14,Sat Apr 25 02:15:47 2015 UTC,I have a lot of respect for them doing their thing and ignoring the chatter. In the end I think we'll find the DC universe a more varied and interesting place.
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,actin_and_myosin,6,Sat Apr 25 03:09:54 2015 UTC,That's a good way to think about it. Playing it safe is not how you make a memorable movie.
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,FlamingPanda77,8,Sat Apr 25 15:20:43 2015 UTC,Holy Fuck Dude
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,KidK0dy,9,Sat Apr 25 00:40:08 2015 UTC,"I like the general aesthetic, I just think they went a little heavy on the tattoos. Then again -- for all we know -- those are just some sort of joke. Heh."
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,decrepidactyl,13,Sat Apr 25 02:28:52 2015 UTC,The moment at which the joker no longer terrifies you and no longer makes you feel uncomfortable is the moment that he is no longer the joker. It is growing on me.
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,S0ckHeaven,6,Sat Apr 25 02:39:26 2015 UTC,"Not what I was expecting, not even a little bit. With that said though, I am fucking digging this look quite a bit.It reminds me of All Star Batman Joker, and I am not fan of that. But Every time I love look at this image, I have the urge to smirk. Count me in!"
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,Aenovejo,21,Sat Apr 25 02:39:14 2015 UTC,"Just like with Ledger, a bunch of people will bitch and whine, and then the movie will roll..."
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,decrepidactyl,3,Sat Apr 25 02:24:36 2015 UTC,"I believe Jared Leto will rock as Joker. This picture didn't change my opinion about that. It's not bitching. And I'm not against him having tattoos but he looks like a Joker impersonator in this picture. Joker, in his most incarnations, is a sophisticated psychopath, not crazy like this. I would have preferred some bat tattoos, broken to pieces (Of course if this Joker is obsessed with Bats) or maybe some self-made tattoos. The only tattoos I liked are the smiley mouth on his arm and ehat looks like a bird (Robin?) on his shoulder. The Hahahahahas are like Batman getting ""I'm Batman"" tattoo. And the ""Damaged"" is the worst..  On the other hand, I love the pale skin and the hair. This movie is my most anticipated movie other than BvS. And I believe it will be good. It's just, probably because I was expecting more Mark Hamill inspired Joker."
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,Aenovejo,2,Sat Apr 25 07:45:19 2015 UTC,"I get what you're trying to say, and respect that.   But-   Joker, in his most incarnations, is a sophisticated psychopath, not crazy like this.   Just because he has ridiculous tattoos all over him, doesn't mean he can't be sophisticated. I doubt that is what you're trying to say, but that's how it comes off as. We have no idea what level intelligence or impulses or what the motives are of this Joker."
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,FlamingPanda77,1 point,Sat Apr 25 22:47:27 2015 UTC,"I hope that is true, I can see Jared as my potential favourite Joker."
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,fregor,-1,Sun Apr 26 05:38:29 2015 UTC,"This would be cool as some sort of edgy cosplay. Not as a look for Batman's most important villian in a universe that has prided itself on being ""grounded."""
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,yelurg,6,Sat Apr 25 14:05:19 2015 UTC,Exactly. Lots of people were on board with this movie and now all of a sudden they say it is completely ruined. Like WTF? Once we get some trailers of Jared as the Joker i'm sure people will be more back on board.
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,ovaltinejenkins88,3,Sat Apr 25 03:55:21 2015 UTC,I think people will still bitch and whine. Just like what they did with Man of Steel and the BvS trailer...
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,yelurg,8,Sat Apr 25 16:55:24 2015 UTC,"Overall, I'm stoked. IMO, they had to do something different than what we've seen in the past to set this version apart. This seems like a nice mix of more modern take while borderline comic. My only 2 nitpicks are the teeth and the ""damaged"" forehead tattoo. Otherwise, where do I buy a ticket?"
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,Luis_Ignacio,7,Sat Apr 25 01:13:58 2015 UTC,"Pure speculation on my part. My guess is the teeth are from years of Batman encounters and getting his teeth bashed in. And the forehead? Maybe he finds it funny that his doctors always think he's damaged in the head? Like I said, pure speculation."
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,your_mind_aches,4,Sat Apr 25 02:57:01 2015 UTC,"Could be, we'll have to wait and see!  There just simply is no way to satisfy everyone. Those are just nitpicks really. I'm more concerned with character anyway.  If they nail that, then all those little visual nitpicks will fade away."
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,yelurg,10,Sat Apr 25 03:05:24 2015 UTC,Wow. It's amazing. So scary.  I'm so fucking hyped for this movie.
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,your_mind_aches,8,Sat Apr 25 01:25:13 2015 UTC,"People on larger subs are quick to criticise smaller subs like this as ""fanboy havens"" yet most of the hating on this is over at /r/movies...."
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,IAmLuckyDuckling,10,Sat Apr 25 02:09:22 2015 UTC,Seems like that sub has a lot of hate for all comicbook movies.
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,your_mind_aches,4,Sat Apr 25 02:46:34 2015 UTC,"Not so much hate honestly. They do like the movies, but they're so... ugh. I don't even know how to describe it."
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,LordCommanderStark,3,Sat Apr 25 05:15:57 2015 UTC,Superior.

DC_Cinematic,33rtml,JimmyBing,3,Sat Apr 25 01:29:02 2015 UTC,I really feel like the tattoos are a promotional thing for the 75th anniversary of mr j. I doubt he will have that many during the film. But who knows. I really like it.
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,agnosgnosia,5,Sat Apr 25 01:35:42 2015 UTC,"I was JUST talking to friend about that. I very much like this very different Joker so I am more or less okay with it. But to me, this has all the vibes a promo image would have. Glad to see there are others saying this aswell."
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,WildEndeavor,3,Sat Apr 25 03:06:29 2015 UTC,"I could see that. All the ""HAHAHAHAHA"" stuff seems pretty meta and I could see that as being something Leto or Ayers wanted to do for the picture. If they ended up removing some of the tattoos, I could also see there being a lot of online talk about that being an improvement."
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,Starpryme23,4,Sat Apr 25 09:13:39 2015 UTC,A movie about just Joker with this production crew would basically force money out of my wallet. I wouldn't even be able to hold onto it.
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,fuck-a-da-police,4,Sat Apr 25 03:40:02 2015 UTC,"When I saw Leto had shaved his eyebrows, I was kind of expecting the make-up artists to replace them with something more exaggerated and arched. Interesting choice to go completely without."
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,Starpryme23,4,Sat Apr 25 03:15:38 2015 UTC,I was expecting to see just tons of negative comments here but surprisingly lots of people are on-board and being reasonable. This is a nice change. Jared Leto is gonna knock it out of the park.
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,IAmLuckyDuckling,1 point,Sat Apr 25 04:07:15 2015 UTC,you should see the hate its getting over at r/movies I personally cant wait to see letos joker and I will make no assumptions based on a still.

DC_Cinematic,33rtml,TheUnderAvgAmerican,3,Sat Apr 25 00:40:47 2015 UTC,Interesting...
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,chakrablocker,3,Sat Apr 25 01:08:20 2015 UTC,He's gotten his teeth punched out. Batman has steel-tipped knuckles on his gloves. Do the math.
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,KnightOfTheStupid,3,Sat Apr 25 03:38:22 2015 UTC,Enjoying the 'grills' my bet is batman knocked out his front teeth
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,chakrablocker,4,Sat Apr 25 04:08:03 2015 UTC,"The mouths, face tats, and jester tat can go imo. I like the rest of the ""look"". I'm sure once Joker gets to work he'll just apply some white makeup and cover up those face tats so I'm not too worried by it."
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,stonespiral,4,Sat Apr 25 03:02:54 2015 UTC,"If that leaked photo from a few days ago is anything to go by, I'm gonna assume that he ends up breaking out of Arkham and the final shot of the film will be him in the full suit."
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,philiplis,3,Sat Apr 25 03:27:16 2015 UTC,Ya know I kinda hope Joker jumps from look to look by the movie or even by the scene. Same for Harley.
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,ToeJoeRo,4,Sat Apr 25 03:35:30 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I really like the casting of Leto for the joker.  I also agree that it's a smart choice to range another risky and wildly different approach.  But my first reaction is that I don't like this look.  I suspect it'll grow on me with me images and one clips start coming out so I'm not jumping on the hate train but... I don't know... The haha and grin and forehead tattoos just come off as cheap and cheesy to me right off the bat.  I hope to have my opinion changed."
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,ImDravenUCrazy,2,Sat Apr 25 09:12:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the more I look at this the more apparent it becomes that it must be some sort of joke by Ayer. Remember that leaked image of Leto from last week? There was no damaged tat on his forehead."
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,mapleleafs64,2,Sat Apr 25 14:03:46 2015 UTC,Love it. He looks fucking insane.  He looks like he would be on the cover of a Home Alone movie.
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,Flying_Sausages,3,Sat Apr 25 14:27:55 2015 UTC,"At first I was unsure, but the more I look at it, the more I realize that meeting this joker would scare the living shit out of me. That smile, those eyes, this is a guy who hurts people because it's fun.   Also, compare him to how batman seems in the recent trailer. Batman seemingly hates the fact that he is forced to put the suit on again. This joker on the other hand seems like he would do it all over again in a heartbeat.   I, for one, am excited. Can't wait to see him in action."
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,Teh_Scaredy_Cat,3,Sat Apr 25 05:15:18 2015 UTC,"The tattoos wouldn't be so bad if they actually looked like they were done in prison.   They honestly seem way to clean, like a fan-boy of The Joker used his parents money to buy them.  Can any of you really imagine joker hanging around to let some guy who probably listens to really shitty music put ink on him?"
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,zen_mutiny,3,Sat Apr 25 11:01:22 2015 UTC,"I gotta be honest, not loving the grills"
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,teo1315,4,Sat Apr 25 02:46:39 2015 UTC,Not sure how I feel about the tattoos
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,CobaltMoon98,2,Sat Apr 25 00:54:19 2015 UTC,I'm not sure. It looks like marlyn Manson and the joker had a baby. I think they may have overdone it with the tattoos. Face tattoos are always dumb. Maybe it'll be good. I don't care.
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,Gary320,2,Sat Apr 25 05:22:55 2015 UTC,Do you think the fact that face tattoos are dumb would stop the Joker from getting one?
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,CaptainMobius,4,Sat Apr 25 05:39:29 2015 UTC,i think it cheapens the character. I always saw him as a polar opposite of bruce but still (and i know this sounds kinda weird and ridiculous) dignified in his own way.
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,junaidhussain,3,Sat Apr 25 05:45:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The Joker has class. It may be a sort of insane class, but he still has it."

DC_Cinematic,33rtml,TripleSkeet,-4,Sat Apr 25 01:01:51 2015 UTC,Not sure if Joker or Marylin Manson
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,mmnaddaf12,1 point,Sat Apr 25 01:14:43 2015 UTC,"In other words, awesome fucking job. It's not the first time the Joker has looked Marylin Manson-esque, he's leaned towards that look in the comics for years now, especially in the Grant Morrison runs."
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,LazyFM,6,Sat Apr 25 05:37:26 2015 UTC,"When the pic was first released, I hated it. Now that I've had time to analyze it, I like it. The only part I don't like is the ""damaged"" on the forehead. It reminds me of Viggo Mortensen in Eastern Promises.  This Joker looks like he has done time. Neither the Nicholson or Ledger Joker did. Especially if his scenes are all taking place inside Arkham it will look great. The Joker of this universe is going to have to look like he can go toe to toe with a Batman that can go toe to toe with Superman. Based on the trailer Batfleck would've tossed the Nicholson and Ledger Jokers in a second. Leto Joker looks like he can take a punch."
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,Justice_Prince,-3,Sat Apr 25 05:51:38 2015 UTC,Um...so is gonna be white faced in this or just pale?
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,LazyFM,10,Sat Apr 25 01:16:38 2015 UTC,"Pale. Joker has completely white skin, no paint in comics"
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,Justice_Prince,-1,Sat Apr 25 01:34:20 2015 UTC,"Aren't we getting an older batman?? So wouldn't The Joker be older as well, but other than that... He looks ok i guess, not digging the face tattoos but ehh and not a fan of the grill. He reminds me of some dude that just got out of San Quentin."
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,LazyFM,9,Sat Apr 25 02:04:14 2015 UTC,Jared Leto is actually a year older then Ben Affleck.
DC_Cinematic,33rtml,CaptAmerica42,0,Sat Apr 25 02:20:30 2015 UTC,"I know, i'm talking about how he looks right here and how he's going to look standing next to an obvious older batman when joker doesn't obviously look old at all, he looks like a young gangster fresh off the streets"

DC_Cinematic,33vkph,aircycle,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:03:58 2015 UTC,The thing is that every interpretation of vandal savage creates him as a huge guy due to the fact that he is a neanderthal.

DC_Cinematic,33s67f,FlamingPanda77,12,Sat Apr 25 02:40:42 2015 UTC,jason todd confirmed
DC_Cinematic,33s67f,majorasmaskfan,12,Sat Apr 25 02:54:07 2015 UTC,*dead Robin confirmed
DC_Cinematic,33s67f,AndImTheSurgeon,3,Sat Apr 25 14:26:17 2015 UTC,I'm hearing that it's actually Grayson. Which saddens me.
DC_Cinematic,33s67f,majorasmaskfan,5,Sat Apr 25 16:09:08 2015 UTC,"There was a tomb stone picture which fits with dick faking his death in the comics, there is literally no reason to kill dick and not jason."
DC_Cinematic,33s67f,ImDravenUCrazy,3,Sat Apr 25 16:11:35 2015 UTC,"That's what worries me. I'm hoping that that's the way they're going, and they haven't actually killed off Dick."
DC_Cinematic,33s67f,VomitSnoosh,10,Sat Apr 25 16:19:57 2015 UTC,Hopefully he killed Robin and that is what makes Ben Afflecks Batman so brutal.
DC_Cinematic,33s67f,huskman,3,Sat Apr 25 11:02:25 2015 UTC,"Hopefully that's why Joker's teeth are metal in the front. Batman stuck to his no kill rule, but made damn sure to knock his smile down his throat."

DC_Cinematic,33qdm9,yelurg,10,Fri Apr 24 17:24:49 2015 UTC,"That's actually a really interesting way of looking at things. We're assuming they're both pissed at each other, or that Superman's going to go all rage monster on Batman, but that may not be the case. Superman could be trying to win Batman over to his cause. Obviously, they're going to have to come to terms with each other to some extent by the end of the film."
DC_Cinematic,33qdm9,JimmyBing,3,Fri Apr 24 17:44:59 2015 UTC,Definitely agree with you.
DC_Cinematic,33qdm9,Caprimelon,9,Fri Apr 24 18:18:24 2015 UTC,I've seen a few interviews from this con and it seems like Armie is always off to the side. Poor guy. Henry seems exhausted with the interviews too.   A+ answer though.

DC_Cinematic,33qdm9,dam360,-3,Fri Apr 24 18:43:29 2015 UTC,"I really don't like his answer. Batman has one thing that sets him apart, that being he's incredibly intelligent. He will have discovered every single weakness of superman to pummel superman into the ground. It should be an even fight."
DC_Cinematic,33qdm9,rebelinthought12345,3,Fri Apr 24 23:36:10 2015 UTC,"really though, superman could travel faster than batman could blink. if he wanted to kill him, he could before batman touches his utility belt. discovering weaknesses and actually utilizing them are different.  this is coming from a major batman fan. i like stories in which batman wins. i resent how overpowered superman is. but that doesn't change the fact that he is ridiculously powered. the reason why batman has a chance are a combination of two:  superman isn't willing to kill batman and batman will take full advantage of this fact to try and expose supe's weaknesses."
DC_Cinematic,33qdm9,dam360,-1,Sat Apr 25 00:28:33 2015 UTC,"I understand that superman is insanely overpowered and completely agree with the difficulty of utilizing superman's weakness, but batman can get it done, and not just for the reason's you stated. That's what makes him batman.  My guess is he will wear a heat resistant suit that is lined with kryptonite. This will prevent superman from fighting at a range to avoid being weakened. Instead, he will have to fight as a normal human without any martial art abilities. Yes, he can throw things at batman, but his gadgets would more than likely deal with them (blow them up/freeze them/whatever).  That is the true power of batman. His ability to analyze and prepare for every situation is unprecedented and unmatched."
DC_Cinematic,33qg0j,JimmyBing,13,Fri Apr 24 17:41:55 2015 UTC,"Don't agree with everything here but you bring up some good points so kudos. I will only say this in defense of the kiss. I totally buy the kiss for 2 reasons. The first being that Lois herself almost just died. Despite all the destruction around, I'm sure she was thrilled to have another shot at life after falling to her near death. Never mind the fact that she was kissing the man who saved her. Secondly, there was no way she knew for sure whether their plan would work so up til a few minutes prior I'm sure she thought the word was over. Yes, a lot of people were tragically killed but that's nothing compared to the entire planet being exterminated which is what almost happened."
DC_Cinematic,33qg0j,YaHerdWithPerd,6,Fri Apr 24 18:26:58 2015 UTC,"If BvS wasn't going to be kind of movie it appears by all means to be, I think I would agree more with you. But it appears to totally be a movie that deals with the consequences.   A few moments at the DP or with the general, I can see it not being discussed every moment. And that they are clearly not ignoring what happened in the BvS, it doesn't bother me at all.  I also agree with the arguments in defense of the kiss. Superman had just saved Lane from certain death, an moment of emotion I can totally buy."
DC_Cinematic,33qg0j,S0ckHeaven,5,Fri Apr 24 19:57:09 2015 UTC,The reason (or at least why I think) they didn't mention or portray the world reacting to Superman is because they wanted to end on a high note. Mentioning the destruction would also open up new plot points right at the end of the movie that would be unresolved until a sequel.
DC_Cinematic,33qg0j,invisiblack,2,Fri Apr 24 18:19:52 2015 UTC,"Not a bad theory. Despite sweeping the destruction into the background, I did really like the scene between Lois and Clark at the very end."
DC_Cinematic,33qg0j,dannyneiba,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:27:18 2015 UTC,"I get that they wanted to end on a somewhat normal status quo, but it just feels like scenes are missing after the end of the Zod fight and that scene where the military woman is all ""he's hot."" The tones of the fight aftermath and the ending are at odds with one another and it really has to do with poor editing."
DC_Cinematic,33qg0j,Luis_Ignacio,2,Sat Apr 25 14:15:42 2015 UTC,"Good points. I believe that the destruction was over shadowed by Superman himself. People where watching destruction all around them but at the same time they witnessed Superman fighting Zod and him helping to put an end to this destruction which was bound to happen. Before Zod arrived to earth, he sent out a message that told everyone that the world would suffer the consequences. Superman surrendered to the US gov't so humanity could be saved. The gov't then give Superman to Zod, so technically the world is saved. But Zod had other plans; which was to build a new Krypton on earth.  Toward the end of the movie while the destruction was taking place everyone must've known that Zod betrayed them and decided to end the world anyhow. Superman saved Metropolis by engaging Zod. But you do bring up valid points. I wonder that when Superman and Lois told the US gov't about their plan to stop Zod, the Black Zero and the world Engine that they made a public announcement to the citizens of the world that the US along with the help of Superman had devised a plan to stop Zod"
DC_Cinematic,33qg0j,Paperman299,2,Sun Apr 26 20:59:29 2015 UTC,"My problem with the film isn't really with the destruction levels in the movie. I'll buy that a young, inexperienced Superman is just overwhelmed by anger and the Kryptonians and simply can't assist the few because of his need to protect the many (I.E. the entire Earth) from the world engine.  However, Kal and Lois making out while the dust of buildings and people fall onto them is kind of sickening. It's also only worsened by the fact that the movie hadn't really earned that relationship. It felt forced."
DC_Cinematic,33qg0j,IwishIwasGoku,0,Sat Apr 25 14:13:35 2015 UTC,"I get now the idea of showing a ""amateur"" Superman. But i still can forgive the lack of recognition for all the destruction, not for realism, but because for me Clark has always been a Good person. H has always tried to save as many people as possible, so the sudden change between he killing zod and then making jokes in the next scene was to much. I would have love to see a small scene just after the fight with zod where Superman is rescuing people from the buildings, and then fying away a joking.  Because put together, those to scenes makes Superman looks like he just doesn't care. I beat the bad guy, i leave."
DC_Cinematic,33qg0j,Paperman299,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:05:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we're to believe the scenes at the end are some time after the battle, but the editing doesn't at all give us enough time to breath."

The events of JL movies have already transpired, so Hal is still in public eye as a hero. But all that changes when someone posing as Hal begins creating serious tension with earth's fragile trade markets. Guardians suspect that a bitter hal is throwing a tantrum which will get their attention and show them just how bad this sector needed his aid. They dont bite, and send sinestro to get a leash on his power spoiled apprentice. Maybe a scene of a mysterious figure using green constructs rocketing through a desert, outrunning and outgunning fighter jets all while exploding pipelines and refineries in middle east. America gets blame for sending one of their heroes to do (insert some political supply agenda) and show off that muscle. Angry, hal enlists the reluctant help of john Stewart and guy to investigate this and get to the bottom of whoever is pulling the strings. When sinestro arrives, hal is relieved thinking he will believe this isn't him causing this. He's right, sinestro trusts that there is no way hal could even fathom what this all means. Confused, hal begins to become aware that a crumbling world economy would be a perfect time for an outside force to slip in and take over as a single world leader. Reveals that he now knows sinestro was behind this and betrayed the corps just to rule earth. Sinestro scoffs hal for being so foolish and explains he has no interest in this pathetic planet, but merely stacked the blocks to easily topple when the real threat arrives. Sinestro reveals his true colors and hal's ring. After guy gardener arrives, there is a quick scuffle and they narrowly escape. The two head to watchtower for some.JL help, only to be intercepted by atrocitus and his red lanterns. While the battle continues, sinestro is followed by Stewart to a remote dark planet riddled with craggy landscape and thunderous weather.

DC_Cinematic,33s40r,demasx,-4,Sat Apr 25 04:43:59 2015 UTC,"Man of Steel is the only film I've ever seen that has such a bizarre, cult-like following of people who think it's good  -- and object to any flaw in it -- that there is an actual website that tries to counteract literally EVERY criticism of the film.   According to MOSIAC, every criticism launched at it are wrong and unfounded. We are simply too stupid to see that brilliance that hides beneath. We who just wanted a fun Superman film -- about hope and justice -- are simply misguided children who can't understand the complexity of the Director of Sucker Punch.   When was the last time Tarantino needed a website to explain why his flicks were good?"
DC_Cinematic,33s40r,S0ckHeaven,4,Sat Apr 25 13:54:02 2015 UTC,"When was the last time Tarantino needed a website to explain why his flicks were good?   Speaking of false equivalency....  Of more curious note, QT says that he’s working on a 20-page review of Bryan Singer's Superman Returns, a film he’s quite passionate and protective over.   Crazy, right?  That there might be an impetus to respond!  The existence of commentary or response says nothing about intrinsic quality- or lack thereof- of the work.  Many things can't be appreciated without commentary and analysis.  There definitely ARE websites that explain why Kubrick or Hitchcock are good... or why it's worth going back and watching Kurosawa even if its dated and in black and white.  Why?  It takes a certain literacy level to make meaningful commentary.  It's crazy to give someone who doesn't know how to play a game a ton a weight in critiquing how it's played... you expect them to at least know the rules, the players, the politics, the money, the safety,etc. before they can weigh in.  Discussing it with them would be meaningless if they keep making suggestions without that factual background: ""Why can't they just do this?"" ""Because it's against the rules.""  ""Why don't they just trade him?"" ""Because he has a contract.""  ""Why did they hire that guy?"" ""Because of politics and money.""  If you handed them a rulebook or asked them to listen to sports radio to start to understand the system, they would be crazy if they said, ""When was the last time Tetris needed a rulebook or radio show to explain why its a good game?  Sports are stupid!""  Criticism without a fundamental factual basis isn't worth much.  If people criticize Superman as pervert who spies on people with his X-Ray Vision, it wouldn't be worth much to the people actually literate in the character, who know that's against his character and such events generally don't occur in the comics.  By the same token, if people criticize Man of Steel based on factual misapprehensions of what occurred or a the logic of a situation, it's not going to be weighed much by people who took the time to understand why misapprehensions are wrong.  That's not even taking subjective issues into account!  Explaining why a film shouldn't be dismissed just because it's in black and white is actually a thing.  The question is whether people are open-minded enough to accept and understand different preferences and either acknowledge or raise their literacy level... or are they going to stand on their preferences as absolutes and refuse to acknowledge the preferences of others."

Your need for people to agree with you is basically embodying the general problem you seem to have with us on the other side of the spectrum.

I used to be a major Marvel fanboy, but then I got into actually reading the comics and goddammit I love it all. Now I hear Valiant comics is getting into the mix, creating its own universe with Bloodshot and Harbinger! What a time to live in.   u/IAmLuckyDuckling made a good point. I see DC trashing just as much on r/marvelstudios as there is Marvel hating on this sub. It's abundant.   I wouldn't, however, say that Marvel is objectively doing better. Financial success, sure they're kicking box office ass, but to me it just comes down to whether I like a movie or not, purely subjective. I love most of the MCU films, some aren't great. Overall, everyone is different. There's no universal right answer.   Some people really like MoS, myself included (I guess I have some issues with it, but I'll give Snyder the benefit of the doubt because he's so damn passionate about the films, and I love that a massive fan is at the helm).   I dunno man, it seems to me that even posts like this promote competition between companies, making fans feel like they need to pick a side. Competition is fine, but needless hating makes me sad. It's only us fans who win in the end anyway, getting to see our heroes kick butt on screen."
DC_Cinematic,33s40r,IAmLuckyDuckling,8,Sat Apr 25 03:38:59 2015 UTC,"I visit this sub multiple times a day hoping to see news and discussion.  I don't post abundantly, but I do participate.  I really admire this sub, and don't really agree with what you are saying.  I see plenty of posts and comments that share various criticisms of Man of Steel without them being ""downvoted to oblivion.""  In fact, there were quite a few this week.  Someone even posted a click-baity-titled link that completely bashed the Batman v Superman trailer (it claimed that ""It Blows"").  Another person shared an article claiming to explain ""Why Comic Book Nerds Hate Batman v Superman"".....whatever that all-inclusive phrase even means.  I can appreciate your desire to see blind fanboyism taken out of the picture, but in all honesty, I don't really see ""blind"" fanboyism here.  Even now, some active users on this sub are expressing that they aren't completely sold on the new Jared Leto picture.  Your post did a nice job of talking a whole lot about Marvel.  You know what?  Marvel is great.  They make great comics and movies.  So does DC.  From what I've seen, reddit as a whole regards the MCU as high-tier cinema and actively seeks to out-shout each other over how the DCCU is either terrible, too dark, inept, doomed to fail, or ""copying Marvel.""  I have no idea why everyone can't be excited for films to come from both studios without angrily attaching themselves to one group.  However, when there is so much widespread negativity regarding DC's cinematic efforts, shouldn't passionate fans have a relatively safe place to actively celebrate and look forward to DC films?  To me, posts such as this only serve to further ridiculous hostilities.  You came to a subreddit dedicated to DC movies, and essentially told everyone that the one movie we have sucks, that we monger hate on other subs, and that we are too positive about this cinematic endeavor.  I don't get it.    I'll be the first to defend the DCCU, but I'm not a blind fanboy.  Here's a reasonable example:  In Man of Steel, Lois Lane argues with Perry White, her boss.  She exclaims that she is a Pulizter-prize winning journalist.  In my view, this blatantly broke the film rule of ""show, don't tell.""  It's always bothered me, and it seems like an off-hand characterization that was in no way subtle.  I wish I could go back in time and address this (and a few other small bits) in the writers' room.  Also, you claim that Marvel is objectively doing better.  Ok, in what way?  Financially?  Sure, they've released more movies.  Artistically?  Well, that depends on who you ask.  Lastly, on a non-DC and non-Marvel matter, you claim that the Star Wars prequels are objectively bad.  Based on this and the last example, I think you really like the word ""objectively.""  Perhaps you are too fast to make broad judgments that you believe to be universal.  Yes, the Star Wars prequels were disappointing and had wooden scripts.  However, they gave us the work of a multitude of artists, all of which can be appreciated as subjectively, and perhaps ""objectively"" good.  We got John Williams' amazing scores, interesting ship and alien designs, new characters that have since become fan-favorites, expansion of the lore, memorable costumes and miniatures, and all books, shows, and games that have sprung forth from these creations.  So....sure, in every way, the Star Wars prequels were objectively bad.  Yep."
DC_Cinematic,33s40r,rebelinthought12345,9,Sat Apr 25 04:05:11 2015 UTC,"I frequent /r/marvelstudios and people there bash DC at the drop of a hat. I've been downvoted just for saying I'm excited because 2016 gives us Batman v Superman AND Civil War.  that said, you're partly correct. no matter what films one enjoys, being an asshole is being an asshole. but here's the other thing, some people (such as myself) really do genuinely enjoy Man of Steel. We find it to be a thoughtful and artistic film. The same can't be said of the Star Wars prequels because those are actually demonstrably bad films with no heart. We also genuinely enjoyed the Batman v Superman trailer. It's possible.   But you want criticism? Here ya go: The new joker looks ridiculous in a bad way."

The difference is I think you and they have every right to like whatever films you do.  Most people do not see what you see when they watch Man of Steel. You have to understand this isn't trying to insult you, or say you're wrong for liking it. It's also not just a bunch of Marvel fanboys ganging up to hate on something you love and I feel like it's reductive to paint it that way. Man of Steel just didn't present the Superman most wanted. I'm glad you got something good out of it though."
DC_Cinematic,33s40r,Come_mai,10,Sat Apr 25 02:41:35 2015 UTC,How could you say film is subjective and say that Marvel films are objectively better at the same time?
DC_Cinematic,33s40r,WildEndeavor,-1,Sat Apr 25 04:20:02 2015 UTC,"I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you simply misread, but I didn't say the films were ""objectively better."" I said Marvel is objectively doing better. And it's really just a matter of them putting out more films that are better received by critics and fans alike."
DC_Cinematic,33s40r,WildEndeavor,2,Sat Apr 25 13:44:05 2015 UTC,"How are they objectively doing better?  Financially?  Artistically?  If they had the same amount of films out, it would be easier to compare.  Somehow the notion that because Marvel (now Disney) has released quite a few films means WB and DC are thereby failing has pervaded the general public's attitude.  WB simply started later on a timeline, that doesn't mean one is ""objectively"" better than the other.  If you are talking about the quality of the films themselves, well, that is subjective.  If a comic company that wasn't Marvel or DC decided to produce a film, would everyone tell them that they are losing simply because Marvel has already released quite a few?  When Batman Begins came out, people didn't say Spider-man was ""objectively"" doing better simply because two movies were already out."

DC_Cinematic,33s40r,TriggerHippie77,3,Sat Apr 25 09:59:26 2015 UTC,"The reason I like (and defend) Man of Steel is because it was a fresh take on the character an mythology. I had gotten soooo tired of elements of Richard Donner's Superman constantly being recycled in TV shows (Smallville) and movies (Superman Returns). The Donner influence was just getting OLD.   In MOS I was excited to see a new version of Krypton, new costume designs, new takes on the familiar characters. Basically everything that was new in MOS was good (from my perspective).  So.... In conclusion, I'm not a fanboy, I'm just someone who was really, really happy to see a fresh, new, modern Superman movie... And I thought they did a really good job of it!"
DC_Cinematic,33s40r,aircycle,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:32:34 2015 UTC,"Just because something is fresh doesn't necessarily mean it's good. Also, I don't like Donner's films. They're silver-age Superman which means he's far too powerful and I also didn't like the super patriotic stuff."

The better and true fan smacks of those real / fake geek tests.  You're not a ""true fan"" just because you're hyper critical either, especially for a fledgling thing that is mostly sight unseen.  Campea uses the example of his wife who loves him warts and all, but her awareness of his warts doesn't mean she brings them up at dinner parties when other people are excitedly talking about their relationships.  The ""demand for better"" assumes an ability to affect that in the world and that isn't accomplished by raining on the genuine excitement and enjoyment of a community speculating or supporting something unseen and anticipated.  Most times you're tilting at windmills for something that's already been decided, determined, budgeted, and bankrolled months before you even had an inkling of what's happening and- in that sense- your opinion doesn't matter... your ""demand for better"" is really only reflected at the box office... otherwise, you really are the sports fan yelling on talk radio... talk about a waste of hot air and raised blood pressure!  Especially when something is young and new, it doesn't really make sense to carry the criticisms and bitterness of the past into the conversation.  It's like saying that he's hyper critical of his toddler because he loves his toddler so much, and so when everyone else is cheering the toddler's first uncertain steps or trying something new for the first time... Campea thinks only a ""true parent"" will prove themselves by yelling about how the kid might split its head open and die and ""demand better"" from the child's wobbly attempts.  He's not factually wrong that there have been dangers or missteps in the past... but it's a complete failure  of reading the room and the situation to think pointing out a toddler's faults shows more genuine affection.  Then insisting that others acknowledge his ""true parenting"" when it's just a failure to read the room seems to be an entitlement divorced from reality.  That the ONLY parent that can truly appreciate those first steps are the parents that have been wounded by a previous kid splitting their head open.  Pfbt!  Get over yourself!  Plenty of people were moved by the TFA teaser without being broken by the Prequels.  They call the convention Star Wars CELEBRATION because that's literally the intention of the event.  No one is censoring or stopping Campea from expressing his views during a celebration, but he if he fails to read the room before sharing, the response he gets is on him, not fandom failing his bogus test of authenticity.  There's a kernel of truth in his rant that sounds nice, but it doesn't really hold up under inspection."

Jumping on the ""Let's Hate DCCU"" bandwagon.  The author complains about Batman being a dark and tortured soul. THAT'S BATMAN'S WHOLE THING.  The teaser I felt was great. Not so action packed or funny as a GotG or Avengers, but that's because DCCU is different in its tone.  Where the MCU is mainly ""Let's have a fun time."" The DCCU is mainly ""Let's think deep thoughts."" That's not to say that one doesn't have the other, but it shows where their priorities are. The DCCU is almost biblical in its scope and tone, whereas the MCU is swashbuckling.  Now here's where I DO agree with the author. They shouldn't have included Bats' line about if Supes bleeds. It clashes against the epic, cerebral tone the rest of the trailer has, with its snippets of religious and scientific debate."

For a character with a huge flop for a film, I doubt WB would just throw him in the mix like that. They want everything to be as perfect as possible for GL, and Suicide Squad just doesn't feel like right launch pad for him. But, we shall see..."
DC_Cinematic,33izhc,caughtupincrossfire,3,Thu Apr 23 00:09:49 2015 UTC,"Well think about this. Since GL was such a huge flop, they wanna test the character and see how the audience responds. If they love Common, the studio will see that and continue with him. If not, he will have a crazy minor role in the following movies. Or they can then introduce a new GL, because theres 3 alternate GLs."

Giving him a small role in wonder woman would make more sense to me, as it ties to JL. Suicide squad is a totally different beast...and even a batman cameo is unsure at this point. Add GL into it, and people would probably be a little confused. Lastly, this is all based on a hunch. But, like I said, we shall see."
DC_Cinematic,33izhc,caughtupincrossfire,-2,Thu Apr 23 01:45:12 2015 UTC,"SS is the next film to make it to the big screen after BvS. John Stewart was a marine before he became GL, and if Snyder's Aquaman tells us anything, its that some of the characters won't be direct adaptions from the comics. Could John Stewart make a minor appearance as a marine/officer trying to stop the SS? I'd say yeah, thats more probable than throwing him into a Wonder-Woman movie. From a business standpoint, it makes sense that WB try to introduce him as fast and as appropriately as possible."
DC_Cinematic,33izhc,thelastbrew,3,Thu Apr 23 16:23:31 2015 UTC,"if Snyder's Aquaman tells us anything, its that some of the characters won't be direct adaptions from the comics.   What do you feel this proves? We have seen one picture of aquaman, and know next to nothing about his character at all. Common actually fits John Stewart look quite well, so that defense is paradoxical to your point.    thats more probable than throwing him into a Wonder-Woman movie   What you're talking about is literally throwing a major JL component into a non JL movie.    From a business standpoint, it makes sense that WB try to introduce him as fast and as appropriately as possible.   Honestly, I doubt neither you or I have much working knowledge of the business behind filmmaking. But one thing I do believe is that such a large part of the DCCU won't be rushed like that. It's part of the reason GL film bombed. They tried to coast on TDK success and rush together a hit, which didn't work out. Just saying, this time WB will most likely be far more cautious and probably involve Snyder for casting...as he will be helming their most daring venture yet."
DC_Cinematic,33izhc,caughtupincrossfire,0,Thu Apr 23 17:56:59 2015 UTC,"I think you're right. I think they're just going to introduce him as ""John Stewart"" and he might even just be an advisor to the Suicide Squad or something.   Maybe he trains them in how to work together? Maybe that's his thing?   Maybe he's the person who joins the Justice League together and keeps them together, throughout the series?   Maybe this is a John Stewart who works to bring people together to become the best that they can be, as a team?  It would add some dimension to his character, to have him be the voice of reason between the obvious differences that Batman, Wonder Woman, and Superman will have. The Flash I see as just going along with everything, and same thing with Cyborg. Aquaman has his own things going on, he's kind of DC's ""Thor"". So he's just there to help out. But Green Lantern can be the one who keeps them all together."

DC_Cinematic,33j281,bigpig1054,9,Wed Apr 22 22:34:26 2015 UTC,"This is wonderfully written article and quite insightful. I agree with the writer completely.  I think the brilliance of the DCCU is how the attitudes of the general population within the universe are reflected among the audience watching it. Fans are torn apart by the representation of Superman. Some watch Man of Steel and think he was a hero. Others watched and thought that he was a cause of destruction and tragedy. This is reflected in the people in that universe. I think that's absolutely the right way to approach.  As far as the writer likening DC heroes to the divine, he is right on. They are treated with more veneration; like mythical figures, something Marvel doesn't quite have."
DC_Cinematic,33j281,rebelinthought12345,4,Thu Apr 23 01:05:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah and it's not that they Marvel doesn't have it, it's that Marvel doesn't write them that way. They like their heroes grounded and flawed. I do too.  But there's a place for DC's style of heroes too and I'm excited to see it on the big screen over the next few years."
DC_Cinematic,33j281,rebelinthought12345,2,Thu Apr 23 02:02:40 2015 UTC,I like their heroes the way they are. At this point it's pretty much woven into their characters so I wouldn't have it any other way.  Agreed 100%
DC_Cinematic,33j281,MiQBonafide,4,Thu Apr 23 02:42:42 2015 UTC,"I was worried about posting it because I didn't want to get accused of spam.  I have another one coming that argues why it's okay that DC is jumping right in with the team up movies, whereas Marvel took their time with individual films. There's a reason why Marvel HAD to do that, and a reason why DC can afford NOT to.."
DC_Cinematic,33j281,IwishIwasGoku,7,Thu Apr 23 02:01:03 2015 UTC,"Marvel.. Well the GA are vaguely familiar with marvel's characters  Whereas DC, Batman and Superman? Icons. Name a female hero..Wonder Woman. Speedster? Flash. DC has had more exposure b4 hand and all thw rights to their properties"
DC_Cinematic,33j281,MiQBonafide,10,Thu Apr 23 02:47:12 2015 UTC,"Hell, Aquaman too. Everybody made fun of him, but they all knew who he was to begin with. When that photo came out and it was being shared on Facebook and Twitter and whatnot I didn't see any ""who's Aquaman? Can someone explain who Aquaman is?"" whereas we see that with most Marvel character announcements. Which made the photo even more powerful. It made an entire population of ignorant people making fun of this guy go ""..Oh, shit."""
DC_Cinematic,33j281,Lyfultruth,3,Thu Apr 23 04:39:19 2015 UTC,I had that reaction too. Wish zack went with orange gold armor/suit or a bit more than just the right shoulder armor. But i understood the tone they r going with and is similar aquaman from 90's / JLU
DC_Cinematic,33j281,Paperman299,3,Thu Apr 23 05:51:47 2015 UTC,Yeah that's basically it.
DC_Cinematic,33hjnn,Bodie293,19,Wed Apr 22 16:00:47 2015 UTC,It's almost as if Marvel fans and DC fans can live together in peace. Almost.
DC_Cinematic,33hjnn,JimmyBing,9,Wed Apr 22 18:41:55 2015 UTC,It's okay to like both!
DC_Cinematic,33hjnn,Hxcfrog090,6,Thu Apr 23 02:26:05 2015 UTC,I LOVE both! There's no losing with over 20 superhero films coming out in the next 5 years.

DC_Cinematic,33hjnn,invisiblack,3,Wed Apr 22 16:22:24 2015 UTC,Link to the actual interview.
DC_Cinematic,33hjnn,invisiblack,12,Wed Apr 22 16:24:06 2015 UTC,"He's been extremely candid lately so he speaks the truth.  If he hadn't been so transparent the last few weeks, I'd start the rumor that he's campaigning to do a DCCU movie down the road, but that's clearly not where his head is at right now... or is it? ;)"
DC_Cinematic,33hjnn,demasx,7,Wed Apr 22 16:22:32 2015 UTC,"I think it's Shazam,Dwayne the Rock Johnson said Shazam has fun and humor in it which is something Joss would be interested in."

DC_Cinematic,33hjnn,thelastbrew,11,Thu Apr 23 20:02:48 2015 UTC,"I would've been upset had he said the opposite. DC and Marvel need to root for each other, despite the competition. After all, they are both superhero films, they share the same appeal/genre. If the appeal goes down, they both go down."
DC_Cinematic,33hjnn,agnosgnosia,2,Wed Apr 22 18:43:31 2015 UTC,"Definitely. I think there is a conscious effort to ride the wave of excitement different properties have. Within 1 to 2 weeks (depending on where in the globe you live) of AoU's release, a flood of trailers have dropped. The Force Awakens, BvS, Jurassic World, Fantastic Four and something else, all dropped in that same week. I'm pretty sure the idea behind that philosophy is that if they're excited for one, that excitement will carry over to their property."
DC_Cinematic,33hjnn,thelastbrew,2,Wed Apr 22 23:12:57 2015 UTC,Interesting point. What might look like competition could really just be that wave of building excitement/hype that benefits them all as a whole.

DC_Cinematic,33hjnn,hammertime06,2,Wed Apr 22 17:35:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's announced a title, but he'll be a ""person of influence."" It makes sense that he would be elevated to a position where he guides the cinematic universe in its entirety rather than make individual movies."
DC_Cinematic,33hjnn,IwishIwasGoku,2,Wed Apr 22 18:20:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, apparently he jots down ideas sometimes and gives them to Feige and Feige thinks they're really good usually. I wish WB had a better 'idea guy' than Goyer. If Geoff Johns is heavily involved that's great but he writes so many books every month (and he's involved in the CW shows) I doubt he has much time for this."

DC_Cinematic,33ifhh,TronVin,6,Wed Apr 22 19:51:17 2015 UTC,This article really puts things in a cool perspective. We always assume it is Zack Snyder being the person to cast these actors and actresses alone but its a team of people then finally Snyder.
DC_Cinematic,33hbq4,IAmLuckyDuckling,6,Wed Apr 22 15:01:53 2015 UTC,"This is a fantastic article. I'm really glad the author was able to discuss the merits of DC/Warner Bros' approach in forging a cinematic universe without feeling the need to slander Marvel's method; and vice versa (which is exceptionally rare). Lately it seems like film punditry, particularly superhero film punditry, often just devolves into a fan-boy pissing-contest with arbitrary side-picking and pointless vitriol, so it was refreshing to see an author present a balanced perspective on the subject. There're pros and cons to both approaches and failing to recognise that adds absolutely nothing to the conversation.  As for the article itself, I really loved this section:   Where Marvel films use larger themes and epic narratives to ultimately speak about individual character story arcs and human experience, DC films use individual character stories and human experiences to speak about larger themes and epic narratives.    I think this perfectly distills the difference between the MCU and the DCCU. To me, this captures exactly what got me so excited while watching the Batman v Superman teaser. It's a story about themes: fear of what we don't understand/can't control, the reality of human mortality and our compulsion to fight against it and survive, religiosity as a tool to manipulate and hate, the morality of heroism, the consequences of our actions no matter the intent, etc. I could go on but this is purely speculation based on what I saw in the teaser so I won't. I'm so fucking pumped to hopefully see these ideas play out as we watch Batman and Superman not only clash physically, but ideologically.   I think the difference the author outlined here is the primary reason why DC can do a movie like Batman v Superman second in their slate while Marvel had to wait until Phase 3 to do a movie like Civil War. Civil War falls apart if the audience doesn't already know the characters intimately, whereas Batman v Superman works with characters we the audience are still getting to know because the ideals they stand for permeate the universe they inhabit on a thematic level.  It's late so who knows if any of that makes sense, but I felt the need to share my two cents. Great article, OP!"
DC_Cinematic,33hbq4,ColonelBrutus,5,Thu Apr 23 08:41:33 2015 UTC,This is a very well written piece.
DC_Cinematic,33hbq4,Atanvarno,4,Thu Apr 23 03:45:21 2015 UTC,"The author, Mark Hughes, is a really great writer. I've been following his blog on Forbes since 2012, and I've never once been disappointed in its quality."
DC_Cinematic,33gbu6,Bodie293,18,Wed Apr 22 08:03:50 2015 UTC,"I really like Henry Cavill. Say what you will about the other DC casting choices but Henry is really spot on as Superman. Also, I like his beard."
DC_Cinematic,33gbu6,Jangwin,9,Wed Apr 22 12:27:09 2015 UTC,Really looking forward to 'The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'!
DC_Cinematic,33gbu6,HowieGaming,2,Wed Apr 22 13:45:47 2015 UTC,Check OP's post history. Pretty sure he's the author.
DC_Cinematic,33gbu6,TrashTongueTalker,9,Wed Apr 22 12:40:41 2015 UTC,"Too bad he had to clarify this, WB already announced there will be a MoS sequel, and that it doesn't have a date yet. Of course this isn't that, lol."
DC_Cinematic,33gbu6,S0ckHeaven,2,Wed Apr 22 22:39:31 2015 UTC,I don't believe you.
DC_Cinematic,33gbu6,deonist,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:14:12 2015 UTC,So im just a little confused. So BvS is an entirely different story/universe or something like that?
DC_Cinematic,33gbu6,MetalDaddy,11,Wed Apr 22 10:18:41 2015 UTC,"I think what he meant is that BvS is not a Superman movie, but a Batman and other hero introduction movie in the MOS/Cinematic universe.  It isn't a proper MOS sequel, kind of how Avengers isn't an Iron Man sequel.  At least that is how i understood his comments"
DC_Cinematic,33gbu6,thaweez,2,Wed Apr 22 14:57:09 2015 UTC,ok ya that makes much more sense.
DC_Cinematic,33gbu6,MetalDaddy,3,Wed Apr 22 15:06:22 2015 UTC,"It's still in the same universe but it's not a Superman film,but a continuation to MOS"
DC_Cinematic,33gbu6,YoureASoldierBodie,-12,Wed Apr 22 17:16:57 2015 UTC,I like you Cavill but this is just a retarded thing to say.
DC_Cinematic,33gbu6,tebam,6,Wed Apr 22 16:02:28 2015 UTC,Umm...why?
DC_Cinematic,33gbu6,YoureASoldierBodie,-5,Wed Apr 22 12:53:43 2015 UTC,"Because it is quite clearly a continuation of the Man of Steel story and he is one of, if not the definitive, main character of the movie. Pulling up a reporter for saying it's a sequel, is just stupidly pedantic."
DC_Cinematic,33gbu6,tebam,5,Wed Apr 22 15:33:11 2015 UTC,"Yes it's a continuation but it's not MOS2, its BvS. he's just saying its not Superman featuring Batman, but both of their story."
DC_Cinematic,33gbu6,invisiblack,2,Wed Apr 22 15:59:15 2015 UTC,"He was just explaining that this isn't Man of Steel 2 ft Batman, it's a Batman/Superman movie set in the same universe."
DC_Cinematic,33hf1r,_thedarkknight,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:26:06 2015 UTC,"Except it kind of is, right? It's set in the same universe, some time following the events of MoS with Superman as one of the main characters. In my mind, in the Marvel universe, Avengers is as much sequel to the various stand-alone Marvel flicks in that it follows Iron Man 1 & 2, Captain America, and Thor in sequence, pulling in the same characters and furthering their stories.   Maybe my idea of ""sequel"" is just too broad. What would a film be called that isn't a sequel that does those things?"
DC_Cinematic,33hf1r,SpaghettiSauced,2,Wed Apr 22 21:43:30 2015 UTC,"I think thats just the point. Outside of the superhero genre, individual films don't live in this sort of containable, foreseeable universe the way superhero films have become. But with these giant franchises like Marvel, who will have 12 movies after Ant-Man is released, the films don't need to be direct retellings of the events that happen to  individual characters, in this case, specifically Superman."
DC_Cinematic,33fedr,FlamingPanda77,7,Wed Apr 22 02:00:25 2015 UTC,Based Snyder.
DC_Cinematic,33fedr,LordCommanderStark,8,Wed Apr 22 02:19:01 2015 UTC,This is awesome and I love it. There's still a year to go and I'm already hyped up! The week of the movie release will be the death of me.
DC_Cinematic,33fedr,PainDoflamiongo,3,Wed Apr 22 02:49:13 2015 UTC,Especially once the pre-screeners start talking about it. I think I'll have to avoid the internet that week.
DC_Cinematic,33fedr,ninjartist,3,Wed Apr 22 15:42:52 2015 UTC,Haha Wonder if Marvel fans are going through the same especially the one's getting a late release.

DC_Cinematic,33fedr,PainDoflamiongo,5,Wed Apr 22 17:04:44 2015 UTC,"""In Snyder we trust"" is umm ambiguous because DC has two Snyder, this director and that writer. Fortunately, you put his picture so yeah... Maybe someday people will use ""In Snyders We Trust."" XD"
DC_Cinematic,33fedr,marsukeb,3,Wed Apr 22 07:59:05 2015 UTC,slightly off topic : Scott Snyder truly writes detective stories with good dose of Batmanism and action in it. He needs to improve his endings but apart from that he is the best!
DC_Cinematic,33fedr,dc_fanboyforever,7,Wed Apr 22 09:06:43 2015 UTC,"That reminds me, we need a DCCU hype train image."
DC_Cinematic,33fedr,z0r-el,3,Wed Apr 22 02:33:13 2015 UTC,Ya we do. I have been wanting to get into photoshop to do things like this but I am to lazy. We need an official photoshopper to do things like that for us.
DC_Cinematic,33fedr,stefonrose,18,Wed Apr 22 02:37:26 2015 UTC,Pardon. Did someone say hype train?

DC_Cinematic,33e7kx,Jkbdm,7,Wed Apr 22 01:56:52 2015 UTC,A lot of great quotes in 300
DC_Cinematic,33e7kx,ab209709,5,Wed Apr 22 02:13:19 2015 UTC,It's from a Frank Miller comic (before he went cuckoo) and has some pretty impressive visuals as well as a solid story.
DC_Cinematic,33e7kx,TheMurderCapitalist,7,Wed Apr 22 02:37:05 2015 UTC,"Exact same thing for me, saw it with a group of people only one of which had actually read the graphic novel. After a few rewatches I decided to finally read it. I've gotta say I actually prefer the movie"
DC_Cinematic,33e7kx,S0ckHeaven,9,Tue Apr 21 21:34:56 2015 UTC,The director's cut is breath taking.
DC_Cinematic,33e7kx,TrashTongueTalker,6,Tue Apr 21 22:47:38 2015 UTC,That Ultimate Cut though.
DC_Cinematic,33e7kx,andrew991116,3,Wed Apr 22 03:14:55 2015 UTC,My eyes were almost exploding after the four hours
DC_Cinematic,33e7kx,RocketTheCoon,3,Wed Apr 22 05:54:33 2015 UTC,I have not watched the Director's Cut yet but I heard good things. How does it differ from the theatrical version?
DC_Cinematic,33e7kx,LordCommanderStark,5,Wed Apr 22 02:18:10 2015 UTC,"It includes more scenes, like the death of Hollis Mason. It's meatier than the theatrical version, giving more insight to the heroes and their pasts."
DC_Cinematic,33e7kx,KidK0dy,8,Wed Apr 22 02:31:18 2015 UTC,That's one of my all-time favorite fight scenes.
DC_Cinematic,33e7kx,Grant638,6,Tue Apr 21 21:50:24 2015 UTC,"Repeat viewings seem to be Snyder's thing and I like it.   Also I did own the book prior but I still liked it.   One isn't a replacement for the other, they both can exist. And also the device at the ending of the movie being called S.Q.U.I.D. was pretty great."
DC_Cinematic,33e7kx,rockSWx,4,Tue Apr 21 22:32:09 2015 UTC,"i saw it without having read the book and i thought it was fantastic, then i remember reading reviews criticizing it for following the source material too much.  i couldn't facepalm any fucking harder."
DC_Cinematic,33e7kx,tunnel-snakes-rule,3,Wed Apr 22 00:16:46 2015 UTC,"Spoilers ahead obviously.  Coming from the other end, I'd been a fan of the comic for a few years before the film finally went into production and I was pretty concerned because if people like Terry Gilliam thought it was impossible to film, what chance did this Zack Snyder guy have?  In the end I mostly loved the film with some exceptions.  I thought Snyder and the screenwriters did a great job of turning such a huge book into a single film.    It has so many memorable scenes, the opening fight scene, the amazing credits sequence, Nite Owl and Silk Spectre rescuing Rorschach from prison, Dr Manhattan on Mars...   I recommend the Ultimate Cut for the full nerd experience.  It includes a lot of the deleted scenes (including the death of Hollis Mason, possibly one of the best scenes of the whole film) and incorporates the Tales of the Black Freighter animated short.    It's something like three and a half hours and I don't recommend it for first time viewers, but for fans of the comic or fans who liked the theatrical length film, it's worth checking out.  I have mixed feelings about Zack Snyder as a director (Watchmen: yes, Man of Steel: no), but listening to him speak, he has such a nerdy enthusiasm about his films, it's difficult not to like him as a person.  So yeah, I guess I just wanted to show that as a fan of the book originally I am also a fan of the film."
DC_Cinematic,33e7kx,RoughHands,5,Wed Apr 22 08:31:50 2015 UTC,I watched this version on my first watch and absolutely loved it. Didn't realize I had been watching it for 3.5 hours by the time it was done I was hooked right in. Only thing I didn't like was the animated short tie in.
DC_Cinematic,33e7kx,dc_fanboyforever,3,Tue Apr 21 23:43:33 2015 UTC,"I was depressed and unnerved after seeing watchmen, I didn't read the book before. I thought how come anyone make such a depressing and negative film, then found out about the book, I was supposed to feel depressed. Watchmen was essential a blunt critique of superheroes and comic books.  I am very glad that Watchmen was made and more glad that it was made with reverence and intelligence. Watchmen is a special movie I will never forget.  For maximum nerdiness see Ultimate Cut + under the hood interviews. For first time viewing watch director's cut, Zack recommends director's cut over ultimate cut, as he feels Ultimate cut is ""experimental"".  He wanted to shoot Tales of Black Freighter in 300 style with Gerald Butler as the Captain of the freighter, but WB said no as it would have cost 25+ million and wouldn't have been released in theatre anyway."
DC_Cinematic,33e7kx,lame_corprus,2,Wed Apr 22 02:23:36 2015 UTC,I really loved it when I first saw it in 2008. Read the book in 2012 and I think the film is a great adaptation.
DC_Cinematic,33fd6f,JimmyBing,13,Wed Apr 22 01:50:28 2015 UTC,"Makes sense, as it is a late 2017 release."
DC_Cinematic,33fd6f,S0ckHeaven,5,Wed Apr 22 01:58:40 2015 UTC,I feel like they should be starting sooner than that though no? When did shooting start for BvS? And that doesn't come out til next year  EDIT: Really? Downvotes for an honest question?
DC_Cinematic,33fd6f,TheMurderCapitalist,5,Wed Apr 22 03:03:13 2015 UTC,"The original release date for BvS was July of this year. The production was delayed five weeks because they wanted Jesse Eisenberg, and he was filming another project. So, the scheduling for filming was set, but they couldn't delay the release by only five weeks because there was no slot for it, so they delayed it to April 2016. Then they were able to move other WB films around and had BvS move up to March."
DC_Cinematic,33fd6f,aircycle,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:39:33 2015 UTC,Where did you hear the thing about the movie being delayed because of Eisenberg's schedule?
DC_Cinematic,33fd6f,aircycle,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:45:33 2015 UTC,"It was never confirmed, but reports came out (I can't remember where) that showed that Eisenberg was filming a project for five weeks  in early 2014, just a few miles from Detroit, and when his other film finished production, BvS started filming."
DC_Cinematic,33fd6f,_ASAK_,2,Mon Apr 27 16:20:12 2015 UTC,Yeah bvs started relatively early
DC_Cinematic,33fd6f,TheMurderCapitalist,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:10:39 2015 UTC,And if they started that movie so early wouldn't they need a lot more time for something as huge as the first Justice League movie?
DC_Cinematic,33fd6f,_ASAK_,2,Wed Apr 22 03:18:26 2015 UTC,"You would think so, because this movie will be massive. But, if they started maybe early 2016, that could be enough time."

Based on his comments I'm anticipating Superman beating Batman rather than contriving a Batman victory. Snyder see's Superman as the ""top of the pyramid"" so it would go against his interpretation for Batman to come out on top. I think in BvS Batman has lost his way and through their conflict Superman will bring him around and show him how to be a hero again and not just an angry vigilante.   BTW, I love his enthusiasm! Nice to see someone who loves the character steering the ship!"

DC_Cinematic,33cxm6,andamonium,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:44:20 2015 UTC,"And if the redhood rumors are true, then this is perfect, superman sets batman up to be a hero again and then batman takes on his big failure."

DC_Cinematic,33eejp,Inspace96,5,Tue Apr 21 21:47:27 2015 UTC,I think the rumour initially was that he was going to be Jimmy Olsen and gets injured during a battle with the main villian.
DC_Cinematic,33eejp,andamonium,3,Wed Apr 22 00:48:17 2015 UTC,I heard that he was jimmy but was injured in the Zod fight and he comes out at the court scene with holly hunter and defends superman

DC_Cinematic,33eejp,YaHerdWithPerd,3,Tue Apr 21 21:59:32 2015 UTC,No he's Jimmy Olsen.
DC_Cinematic,33eejp,TotallyNotKanye,-2,Wed Apr 22 01:51:17 2015 UTC,they already had Jenny Olsen in MoS
DC_Cinematic,33eejp,teo1315,3,Wed Apr 22 04:14:00 2015 UTC,That's not Jimmy Olsen. And that was probably a throw away character.
DC_Cinematic,33bast,invisiblack,11,Tue Apr 21 03:03:03 2015 UTC,Is there just a display case for this in Zack's house? Cause that's what I'd like to believe
DC_Cinematic,33bast,TheMurderCapitalist,8,Tue Apr 21 03:10:54 2015 UTC,Zack Snyder Revealed as Batman!
DC_Cinematic,33bast,IAmLuckyDuckling,4,Tue Apr 21 03:16:24 2015 UTC,I like to think he wears it around the house on his days off

DC_Cinematic,33bast,teo1315,6,Tue Apr 21 03:49:36 2015 UTC,I'll post all dc cinematic related stuff in this sub.  Hopefully I can record some exclusive footage

DC_Cinematic,33bm29,TheMurderCapitalist,15,Tue Apr 21 04:52:40 2015 UTC,Can confirm that's it. Surprised it took this long. But I've seen the trailer maybe 50 times already...and the IMAX version was like seeing it for the first time. Just breathtaking to look at on the big screen.
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,YaHerdWithPerd,6,Tue Apr 21 05:10:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get that this cam-quality will give people more of an idea what we saw. But man seeing it in native IMAX format looked absolutely phenomenal."
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,decrepidactyl,6,Tue Apr 21 05:29:05 2015 UTC,The sound was kick ass as well. Made me very excited to know that no matter how much footage we get before the movie it will pale in comparison to the IMAX experience.
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,YaHerdWithPerd,6,Tue Apr 21 05:42:14 2015 UTC,"Batsy voice rumbled my seat, was amazing"
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,KALEl001,2,Tue Apr 21 06:25:07 2015 UTC,"It tickled,I kinda liked it."
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,decrepidactyl,10,Tue Apr 21 06:51:00 2015 UTC,"Here is what I got out of this :    Batman is pretty fucking quick in that armored suit. I was expecting him to be a little clunky and slower.  Superman was a tad out of breath. De-powered somehow. I am betting it has something to do with that Russian missile (possibly a nuke) he was carrying in the trailer. They are both inside now. I would like to believe this fight goes on for a several minutes.   Also, I believe this is how it will end. A stalemate, and not a clear cut winner.Maybe something interrupts them, or both come to their senses and talk it out."
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,decrepidactyl,3,Tue Apr 21 06:34:00 2015 UTC,To me it looked more like Superman was carrying some sort of satellite in the trailer
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,SheWantsTheMe,2,Tue Apr 21 15:01:34 2015 UTC,he was...i read somewhere the words on the thing was of the russian space agency...can't confirm tho
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,rebelinthought12345,2,Tue Apr 21 18:03:11 2015 UTC,"No, that is more than likely what it is. I am just trying to rationalize Superman's depowering from footage we have already seen."
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,decrepidactyl,10,Tue Apr 21 19:02:26 2015 UTC,Looks like what people described.
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,invisiblack,5,Tue Apr 21 05:02:23 2015 UTC,"Clark has the spit-curl, I think. Glorious."
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,LordCommanderStark,7,Tue Apr 21 06:12:42 2015 UTC,He definitely does. I eeeeked when I saw that.
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,decrepidactyl,4,Tue Apr 21 06:19:58 2015 UTC,It got taken down. Any mirrors?
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,TotallyNotKanye,10,Tue Apr 21 12:54:52 2015 UTC,Does this work?
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,invisiblack,2,Tue Apr 21 12:56:54 2015 UTC,THANKS!
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,TotallyNotKanye,0,Tue Apr 21 21:10:19 2015 UTC,"Cmon guys, this is dishonorable. It was an exclusive for those who went, and Zack even said right before to please not do this."
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,royal_dump,11,Tue Apr 21 06:29:31 2015 UTC,"I some-what agree.As much as I would have loved to have just a select few to have seen this, it was bound to be leaked.Especially,since they showed the trailer twice, and knowing whats going to happen they had all the time in the world to record that last few seconds. At my theater there were guys at the bottom wearing Night-vision goggles,so I don't know how well that would have gone. But now that it has leaked, there is no way to stop it, it is best to just roll with it."
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,decrepidactyl,15,Tue Apr 21 06:40:12 2015 UTC,"I find myself agreeing with you. Zack worked hard on this film not just for himself but for comic book fans everywhere.   But I watched it anyway, because I am a weak man who needs his HYPE fix. I feel like someone who ate a tub of ice cream while still on a diet."
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,LordCommanderStark,5,Tue Apr 21 06:44:16 2015 UTC,"Not really considering how few screenings of this there were. Canada literally had one, in Toronto. It'd be different if everyone had an equal opportunity to see the screenings and just missed out, but many of us didn't even have a choice"
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,AskMeAboutMy_Comics,3,Tue Apr 21 12:36:27 2015 UTC,Yup and that one screening was out of tickets super quick. Had I known sooner I would have liked to go.
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,Jangwin,3,Tue Apr 21 12:51:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely. No IMAX screening in Australia. :("

DC_Cinematic,33bm29,arjunthehobo,2,Tue Apr 21 18:34:31 2015 UTC,Did you not check? It was the only one in Canada
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,decrepidactyl,2,Tue Apr 21 18:40:11 2015 UTC,I looked everywhere I couldn't find one in Toronto. guess km a complete idiot.
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,decrepidactyl,2,Tue Apr 21 19:21:11 2015 UTC,"The one in Toronto was at capacity very quickly. Its stupid, even though they got rid of passes fast, the theatre still had a few dozen seats empty."
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,TriggerHippie77,0,Tue Apr 21 19:31:16 2015 UTC,"That is not the point, is it?It really is unfortunate that number of IMAX theaters was very limited,but it is called an exclusive for a reason.I, and whole bunch of other idiots waited in line for this for 2 hrs (+/-).Zack made a recording of himself, making a statement to please not record this,and assured us this footage will not be released anywhere else (of course he means officially), and to take out your phone now, and record the footage AFTER you heard what Zack had to say, yeah your a piece of shit."
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,AeonVex,4,Tue Apr 21 14:34:53 2015 UTC,"But you and a whole bunch of idiots had that choice to stand in line or not. Many of us weren't even given the option, and it wasn't due to the limitation of IMAX theaters."
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,IAmLuckyDuckling,2,Tue Apr 21 16:57:15 2015 UTC,"It's not as if that extra five seconds spoils any plot points. It literally shows Batman fighting Superman, which is incidentally the name of the film."
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,decrepidactyl,-5,Tue Apr 21 14:10:34 2015 UTC,Not showing all the fans is rude. Its all Hollywood games. Give me the script Snyder.
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,decrepidactyl,5,Tue Apr 21 08:23:16 2015 UTC,No one got mad when marvel didn't release their exclusive scenes and clips from their events and comic cons.
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,cordialhero,2,Tue Apr 21 14:38:25 2015 UTC,"Seriously, just shows how big of a giant this film really is when it comes out.   I kind of hope Zack comes out and treats like children and grounds us, and says 'This is why we cant have nice things.No exlusives,no pictures,no trailers,wait till the film is released now.'"
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,AeonVex,2,Tue Apr 21 18:21:27 2015 UTC,Do you really hope that though? Really?
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,invisiblack,2,Tue Apr 21 18:28:07 2015 UTC,"After witnessing that extra footage in IMAX, and knowing what I know now, I would totally be okay going into the movie like this next year. BUT to answer your question, No of course not.  I will be eating anything and everything Zack & co throw at me,untill we get closer to release that is.  Zack seemed very genuine in his recording, and for this part to leak blows.So i feel bad for Zack,as he just want to treat a few fans for attending."
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,AeonVex,-22,Tue Apr 21 18:54:28 2015 UTC,lmao fuck zack snyder
DC_Cinematic,33bm29,invisiblack,-10,Tue Apr 21 07:35:15 2015 UTC,I find it disgusting to not release this publicly its like a literal spit in the face to all those not in attendance.

DC_Cinematic,33a78u,JimmyBing,5,Tue Apr 21 00:34:01 2015 UTC,They had a guy standing in front of the theater with night vision goggles in our theater. I doubt anyone would be able to record it without being caught.
DC_Cinematic,33a78u,Hxcfrog090,2,Tue Apr 21 00:52:45 2015 UTC,"People who have now seen it have confirmed this, sounds awesome."
DC_Cinematic,33a78u,BarbequeMeat,2,Tue Apr 21 00:16:11 2015 UTC,"Yep. Pretty much exactly as described. Snyder asks not to record it (there was actually a guy with night vision standing in our theater to make sure this doesn't happen), they show the trailer with the extra footage of Bats and Supes running at each other, Snyder comes back to talk about the Native IMAX footage, and then shows the trailer again. Also note that Snyder was standing in front of the Batmobile."

Clark flew to the South Indian Ocean and back to Metropolis in about two hours in MoS. That's 12,000 miles an hour. We saw the speed of a Krytonian against armed soldiers during the ""Battle of Smallville."" I appreciate the irony of my next statement but it just seems implausible that Batman could even blink in combat against Superman.   Very excited for this movie and hope they explain it well."
DC_Cinematic,33a78u,toolonglurking,5,Tue Apr 21 02:11:21 2015 UTC,I think Supes will be depowered or weak from something.
DC_Cinematic,33a78u,Yourboy11,2,Tue Apr 21 02:37:41 2015 UTC,probably his first introduction to kryptonite at some point. they are going for a lot of DKR references and without one armed Ollie to shoot a krypto arrow at Clark it's likely Lex plays some part
DC_Cinematic,33a78u,teo1315,2,Tue Apr 21 06:18:20 2015 UTC,Or maybe the shot of Batman with the sniper rifle is him with a Kryptonite bullet.

What the teaser offered me was the visualization of what it was going to look like. What I didn't take away was any plot details what so ever. We are way too far away from the release date to even know what exactly they're fighting about. I understand that the comic book fans are going to get butthurt if Zack Snyder changes the tiniest little thing, but c'mon, it's a movie. Not only that, they are going straight into a franchise. So is it going to be very similar to TDKR, absolutely. Is Zack Snyder going to make it his own and adapt it for the bigger picture, of course he will. I personally cannot wait to see it for myself and then make the call on if what they are doing works."

DC_Cinematic,33eegb,KingofZombies,5,Tue Apr 21 21:47:00 2015 UTC,"I can translate this if anyone needs it!   Why comic book nerds hate Batman v Superman   This means, why the author hates the teaser trailer because he wants people to know how big of a nerd he is. We don't know the context of the movie yet nor do we know if neither are right or wrong, wait until you watch the damn thing."
DC_Cinematic,33eegb,MrCatEater,2,Tue Apr 21 21:55:26 2015 UTC,"Wow, this person has a gift. Quite a hefty critique of a 3 hour movie based on 2:14 teaser.

DC_Cinematic,33eegb,caughtupincrossfire,-1,Tue Apr 21 22:11:08 2015 UTC,I saw this and thought you guys might want to weigh in. I don't agree with the article 100% but I thought it made a valid point about the depth of Bruce and Clark's friendship.
DC_Cinematic,33eegb,Mordkay,2,Tue Apr 21 21:13:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't read the entire article, but I did read the part you agreed on. They are not friends in this movie, everything you know about them is new territory for this movie. I get it, they are friends in the comics now, but in this universe they are not. So you can't bring in your ideas of what their friendship is, to a universe where it doesn't exist, yet. They are fighting, you don't know why, we don't know why, but they are fighting. Let's find out, before we start speculating the entire plot of a movie from a two minute teaser. A teaser that doesn't really tell us anything other than the worlds reaction to Supermans actions in MoS, and that Batman fights against him."

DC_Cinematic,338i3o,TheAndrewSpence,9,Mon Apr 20 14:43:34 2015 UTC,"This was fantastic!  Best things I got from it:   We get the best look yet at the batsuit, and it looks awesome. First Look at Wonder Woman's costume in color, and it's actually red & blue and looks great. The detail about the Batmobile lifts when jumping for more clearance, and lowers when driving for more aerodynamics. Very cool. The Batmobile has two seats, hopefully showing that it was made with Robin in mind. The shot of all three costumes shown together looks badass.   Edit: Formatting."
DC_Cinematic,338i3o,sgttsmitty,7,Mon Apr 20 14:47:51 2015 UTC,"My 2 takeaways: 1) Batmobile is a two seater, 2) Wonder Woman will be using a sword."

DC_Cinematic,338i3o,decrepidactyl,4,Mon Apr 20 15:06:33 2015 UTC,"I don't even know what to say. The fact that I am looking at statue costumes of the Trinity that are going to be in a live-action film, is still something I am not over.  I love the look that they are going for ,for Wonder Woman. The addition of her shield is excellent, and the colour reveal for her are wonderful. Although, I love Supes' suit, I kind of wish his got more of a change, I feel like he is not getting enough love. But with that said, I like that the yellow in the shield is looking less dirty. Now for Batman...I really feel like I am looking at him for the first time, I can't say enough about it.Ever since I saw set pics, and footage of the Batmobile, I have been waiting to see this beast in action."
DC_Cinematic,338i3o,invisiblack,2,Mon Apr 20 16:08:59 2015 UTC,"I wish they would have added a red belt to Supes' suit. Wonder Woman's armor looks more silver than bronze (which I like), wasn't worried about the color back when the promo pic was released since I knew it was just a promo filter."

It would be too much in my opinion.  Maybe we see a unified Trinity, but that's it.  No talk of recruiting a bigger team.  As for the very final scene I know what I'd like to see.  It has to do with the plot idea I had for the Wonder Woman film, so if they're doing something different for that then it wouldn't make sense.  My idea for the Wonder Woman film is to have it be about Ares manipulating that Amazons, and Atlantians into a war.  So to lead up to that in the final scene in BvS we would see Aquaman sailing towards Themyscira while ominous music is playing."

DC_Cinematic,333k2u,thisguynick,16,Sun Apr 19 04:36:54 2015 UTC,Barbara Gordon seems more likely. She's a more popular character than Carrie Kelly and she could definitely fill the tech support role for Bruce if she's already Oracle.

There have been rumors of Batman appearing in the Suicide Squad movie. Would sort of make sense for Batman to keep up with whats going on in Arkham, so he sends Grayson to do it.  Also read some rumors that WB wants movies based on Under the Red Hood and Battle for the Cowl at some point, both movies where Grayson is important."
DC_Cinematic,333k2u,nightywing,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:24:05 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  I hadn't heard the Battle for the Cowl rumor.  If Batman exists as a boogeyman in Suicide Squad, it would be cool to see Nightwing actually go take care of some things."
DC_Cinematic,333k2u,ManagerMurrayHewitt,2,Sun Apr 19 19:41:58 2015 UTC,I believe there reports of testing out 3 or 4 different unknown actors as Wonder Woman's love interest in her solo film and that Scott Eastwood would be playing a different character
DC_Cinematic,333k2u,TheMurderCapitalist,2,Sun Apr 19 15:54:34 2015 UTC,I think someone involved in production pretty much straight came out and said he's not Trevor.

There was a gravestone that said Dick Grayson with the year of death obstructed in the picture. People swore it said 1952, 1972 and 1992. I personally think it was simply a joke or Easter egg.   I wonder if the set is still there. I live about 45 mins away.   EDIT: I work a help desk job and talk to people in our company all over the country, even Alaska. I've talked to every employee of ours in Libertyville and not a single one had any idea that this movie filmed there. This production was super low key.

DC_Cinematic,333z8e,HarishChengaiah,8,Sun Apr 19 08:22:38 2015 UTC,"Superman isn't stupid. He knows why they are praising him as a god. That look isn't confusion, it's concern. It's uncertainty. He knew full well that revealing his abilities would cause the some of humanity to worship him regardless of his protest. It is easier for some to believe in religion than extra terrestrials, at least in this world. Batman's quote from Batman/Superman #3 about how the simultaneous Superman's humanity and super-humanity, if you will, even shows Batman at times sees him as a deity. ""It is a remarkable dichotomy. In many ways, [Superman] is the most human of us all. Then he shoots fire from the skies, and it is difficult not to think him a god. And how fortunate we are that it does not occur to him."" So I think that look is not confusion, but a very well portrayed visage of reluctance, concern, and uncertainty."

I only started reading comics last summer, but I made it a pretty big deal to consume as much as possible.   I now have an embarrassing number of comics for it being less than a year later, but I can very confidently say that DC characters are better. Despite the DC characters being way more powerful, on average, than the Marvel characters, I still find that the DC characters are better written more often than not. They have more compelling stories.   There are a few Marvel characters that I like, like Miles Morales, Daredevil, Hawkeye, Howard the Duck, the new Ghost Rider. They're great characters with great comics.   But I end up being way more attached to the DC characters that I read."

And even though DC is just starting their shared cinematic universe, it doesn't discount the fact that DC properties have been incredibly successful on TV and in the movies for the past 30 years. The Reeves Superman movies, the Tim Burton Batman movies and their sequels, Christopher Nolan's Batman, Lois & Clark, Superboy, Smallville, Arrow, the 90's Flash TV show, 70's Wonder Woman, 90's Swamp Thing, Batman animated, Justice League animated, current Flash, Gotham and others...

But now, when everyone is sucking marvel's dick (cinematic), gagging on its balls, putting DC down (currently a big DC geek).  I just can't take it anymore.

Until then, cautious optimism is the road I'm taking.   Edit: Also, what if this somewhat touches on some New 52 stuff with Grayson. I don't want to spoil anything, but for those who have read it, I'm thinking of Forever Evil and the latest Grayson series."

DC_Cinematic,32z3l7,decrepidactyl,15,Fri Apr 17 22:53:28 2015 UTC,"Alright, that's more like it. I love this trailer even more now. Few things I noticed now, that everything is so crisp.   The kneeling Soldiers have the ""S"" shield insignia. Interesting. - Superman shield in this looks fucking awesome. In between Lex's little speech, in the background you can hear ""He's out of control...they brought their warrior."" - Who are they talking about Superman? Batman? Wonder Woman? Now my personal favourite shot.I love the chosen lighting and positioning. I don't know whether I should call him Ben or Bruce anymore, because he's killing this look. Bruce looks tired as shit, and is giving off a very concerning look. - Also in the background to the left, it appears to be a different Bat-suit,since suit we all know is in a cabinet (but it could very well be the same suit), and to the right we have some bat-gear (but i cant make anything out).  In this shot, it looks like Bat's is in his armored suit. Didn't catch that before. http://i.imgur.com/mcAHoQ2.png This is just Batman looking like a tank http://i.imgur.com/5vlgPbp.png Not only is everything beautiful in this shot, that is most definitely a Rifle (the scope is the most obvious) that Bats is holding. http://i.imgur.com/2DZEuCe.png The armored suit looks a little scratched up. http://i.imgur.com/7u0gCRg.png This shot right here, is all kinds of badass. http://i.imgur.com/wHhKtgv.png"

I took a quick screenshot of the building just before Supes and Zod hit the building and if you look at this pic , the architecture on the exterior appears to be the same. I mean, the pic of Bats examining the rubble looks like he is in the same building,but just in a different area."

But it's not, not any more than the Avengers trailer showed the world to be suffocating in freedom or whatever shit Loki was trying to peddle. Its showing you the villains' motivations."

DC_Cinematic,32z3l7,TronVin,1 point,Sat Apr 18 02:50:51 2015 UTC,"You're speaking into an echo chamber of people who also enjoy DC comics/films. Your statement is rather self-masturbatory because of that. There's likely few here who actually think it will suck, less so in this thread, because we're all fans. Trailers are not representative of the films they are made for. Many people are overly cautious about films because of this. Some jazzy post-production effects and a couple of drama soundtracks do not a movie make.   tl;dr: What do you want us to tell you? ""Yeah, those people are dumb and stupid! How dare they hate the look of a trailer of a film we're hyped about!""?  In the films defense I think it'll be badass, but I have pretty low expectations when it comes to movies. Does it have explosions, badass action sequences and a bit of light comic relief? Great, I'm sold.  Doesn't mean it'll be as awesome as this trailer for everyone, though. Chances are it will be and the people who see this and say it'll suck are the minority. There's people who don't like any superhero film but they all still make fuckin' millions."

The rear part of that aircraft is exactly why I am not dismissing that it is not Batman's Tech, but I just dont think a man ... let alone a man the size of batman could fit in there.

I hope they ditch the Fuchs script and have the film written by Patty Jenkins and David Goyer or Kurt Johnstad."
DC_Cinematic,32xzks,Boopa1219,2,Fri Apr 17 18:24:55 2015 UTC,Wonder Woman in the style of Braveheart sounds cool though
DC_Cinematic,32xzks,WhitaThanBleach,7,Fri Apr 17 17:25:32 2015 UTC,I would personally rather the character driven story. BvS and Suicide Squad are both going to be action packed. A little change of pace will be nice.
DC_Cinematic,32xzks,thatrguynamedtrevor,7,Fri Apr 17 17:32:40 2015 UTC,Same here! Was worried it was going to be the opposite... That the studio would be pushing for an action film. Really happy with their decision to go more character driven.
DC_Cinematic,32xzks,WildEndeavor,2,Fri Apr 17 17:36:27 2015 UTC,Didn't MacLaren direct episodes from Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones? Both series being very character driven and you would think she would be the one pushing for a more character driven movie.
DC_Cinematic,32xzks,invisiblack,3,Fri Apr 17 19:50:40 2015 UTC,"That's probably why they chose her, but then she took a left turn"
DC_Cinematic,32xzks,WildEndeavor,2,Fri Apr 17 21:38:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe she wanted to do something different from what she had already done. Maybe she wanted to just cut-loose with a $100 milli+ budget at her disposal. I wouldn't blame her if that was the case."
DC_Cinematic,32xzks,suss2it,2,Fri Apr 17 23:23:15 2015 UTC,"It's interesting to me that the dynamic of this dispute is the artist wants a more action packed film while the studio is angling for a more character driven story. I'm not sure if that is good or not for the character Wonder Woman, but I think it is the fans who will be missing out on Ms. McLaren's outstanding talent at the helm. Hope the new director succeeds tho because an iconic feminist superhero franchise is just what the comic world needs."

DC_Cinematic,32y7fx,invisiblack,5,Fri Apr 17 18:42:39 2015 UTC,I guess maybe when the trailer comes out people would want to see it in HD so the leak might not have that big of an affect.

I like the way they are playing with how a super being would be received by humans. They're really digging into the pathos of a world of super powered people.  It's darker than I was expecting.   They seem to hint that Batman is indeed the villain. I thought their conflict might be more philosophical, but in one of the vo's it sounds like Alfred warning Bruce on what it takes for a good man to turn evil... implying Batman was heading down a bad path.  I really like that they are taking Superman and the others on a real journey. I like that before these characters can be heroes there is a gauntlet they must first pass through in order to prove themselves.   Good teaser. Looking forward to seeing it."

I'm pretty into the idea of there being controversy around an alien man god that just pops up. Society is too cynical to completely trust a power like that, while there are some parts that will kneel immediately. I bet Supes is gonna be super uncomfortable with both the adoration, and the distrust, and he'll eventually have to earn his role in society with acts that will likely happen in BvS and JL. Also, it's totally reasonable that Batman would be a cynic... I mean, he saw these aliens destroy a city with their fist fight, of course he's not going to be a fan initially. I'm in. I'm allllllll in."
DC_Cinematic,32vlu1,WildEndeavor,8,Fri Apr 17 13:32:34 2015 UTC,"Totally on the same page with you. They are bringing up issues totally ignored in the Marvel universe and I have a lot of respect for WB and DC for bringing the genre in a new direction. It would have been REALLY easy for them to copy the Marvel map and go with something more lighthearted, but as with MoS they are really digging deep to explore this world."

DC_Cinematic,32vlu1,WildEndeavor,9,Fri Apr 17 20:05:12 2015 UTC,Another MoS defender here. I've been eating downvotes since the movie released in theaters. I always knew that they would address it the destruction and never doubted Snyder and co.

DC_Cinematic,32vlu1,stuartrmarshall,11,Sat Apr 18 13:32:17 2015 UTC,Glad you're a fellow MoS defender. Feel like there aren't a whole lot of us! It still irks me when people say Superman didn't save anyone or destroyed Metropolis. He saved all of them! Literally everyone in Metropolis and the world. He busted his ass to save people. And why do the haters focus so intently on the destruction in this movie but ignore it in every other? Ugh.
DC_Cinematic,32vlu1,WildEndeavor,9,Fri Apr 17 20:47:25 2015 UTC,"Glad you're a fellow MoS defender. Feel like there aren't a whole lot of us!   How it feels being a MoS fan.  But in all seriousness one of the reasons I find Marvel's films boring is because they are thematically vacant. They're action movies with no heart. Sure, they can be fun but they don't grab me emotionally like MoS or Nolan's trilogy did. Take the scene of Clark asking Jonathan if he was supposed to let those kids drown and you can almost feel Clark's heavy heart at even having to ask it. And Jonathan's reply? They wouldn't say that in Iron Man or Thor. MoS and the Dark Knight trilogy are layered in thematic elements and symbolism and that's just one part of what makes them so great."
DC_Cinematic,32vlu1,stuartrmarshall,5,Sat Apr 18 03:52:19 2015 UTC,"First off... LOL!!! at that gif. So glad there are dozens of us out there!  And yeah. I think that movie goes over most people's heads. It is richly layered and for people only familiar with stories that skim the surface, it's hard to understand. I see MOS as a coming out story. A film about a man who is literally lost but finds his purpose in life. It's a film about inner conflict and self discovery. I think it's a really beautiful film and a fresh take on the genre."
DC_Cinematic,32vlu1,WildEndeavor,5,Sat Apr 18 04:03:32 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it's not like he can make Zod fight him some where else. Zod knew Kal El cared about those people so he tried to use it against him. Everyone says 'oh he's superman he can take the fight away from the city'.... they were all 'Supermen'. If he tried to lure Zod away Zod would've ignored him and terraformed the planet."
DC_Cinematic,32vlu1,KovalSNIPE17,4,Sat Apr 18 03:51:34 2015 UTC,"Thankyou, Zod literally said 'these humans, i will take them from you, one by one'. Superman just had to fight Zod there and then, if superman went anywhere, Zod would just start killing everyone he could."

DC_Cinematic,32vlu1,alwaysupvoteTRUNKS,3,Sun Apr 19 16:20:46 2015 UTC,Excellent. Exactly.
DC_Cinematic,32vlu1,aircycle,0,Sat Apr 18 00:17:25 2015 UTC,"I'm equal parts a DC fan and a Marvel fan, but I feel a lot of the issues people have with this trailer is a direct consequence of a poor experience with Man of Steel. I'll admit I thought the movie was a mess, and while I can see they were trying to go for depth, in my personal opinion they missed by a long stretch. Instead, it just came across as moody for the sake of being moody, with a long, exhausting and - even more damning - generic action sequence at the end. This trailer would suggest the same, although part of me is far more optimistic that they'll actually try and add some depth this time that was sadly missing from MoS.   That said, for those who think Marvel (which I equally enjoy) is light hearted family movies compared to the DCU (as typified by MoS), I struggle to see how you could possibly draw that distinction. There was nothing in MoS that covered matters as deeply as Winter Soldier, and I'd argue even that GotG actually had more depth and meaning to their characters than MoS.  I'm definitely looking forward to BvS. I'm especially looking forward to characters like Wonder Woman and others having their turn in the limelight. WB and DC hold a lot of potential. They didn't get off to a great start, but it's early days and there is so much they can do with their cinematic universe that this is going to be a fun ride.   Here's hoping both Marvel and DC have successful universes..."
DC_Cinematic,32vlu1,JeweliusCaesar,3,Sun Apr 19 19:11:46 2015 UTC,You really need to watch MOS again and really dig into the characters and conflicts. It's an incredibly rich story about a man on a journey of self discovery. A man in search of his identity. A coming out story of self acceptance. It's a story about free will and self determination. The moodiness of the film comes from Clark's unhappiness. He's a lost soul struggling with who he is and his purpose in life. Zod and the plot are just elements of the story of his personal journey.
DC_Cinematic,32vlu1,aircycle,0,Sun Apr 19 23:09:26 2015 UTC,"I do not doubt that this may have been what they were aiming for. However, having sat through the movie twice now, the execution is sufficiently messy (and some of the characters sufficiently poorly drawn) that this message is underwhelming to say the least. It's also a generic ""deepness"" that isn't all that distinctive from their supposedly ""family fare"" competition. Iron Man and Guardians of the Galaxy could all lay claim to this story and thematic path as well, and I'd argue there was more depth to the characters in those movies than the monotone and simplistic characters in MoS.  That said, there were elements to MoS that I enjoyed, and that point towards where BvS can also excel. The supporting characters in MoS were pretty good (other than lamentable script treatment of Jonathan Kent in an otherwise good performance by Kevin Costner),  and the sense of scope early on in the movie were encouraging as to what could be achieved.   Mind you, that it (in my opinion only, of course) failed to deliver in a poorly structured middle and a generic final act, doesn't stop me from looking forward to BvS. I'll admit, I'll be watching for the supporting characters - Alfred, Wonder Woman, potentially Robin, and Aquaman.   MoS' Superman doesn't excite me, and I'm mildly interested in seeing the direction they'll take Batman from the previous trilogy. I'm happy they won't be forcing yet another origin story upon us!  The trailer itself - well, it's hard to judge too much, but as I said - some of the backlash is simply because of the disappointment in (some, not all) aspects of MoS.   Ultimately, MoS succeeded in launching a franchise. I hope we can look back on the DC cinematic universe, and consider MoS to be the Iron Man 2 of the series. Not a bad effort, but the weakest of the lot. That'll mean future movies in the series have finally found their feet!"
DC_Cinematic,32vlu1,TheMurderCapitalist,5,Mon Apr 20 07:09:45 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I think if people didn't like MOS they won't like the rest of the DCCU. They're coming at the genre from a different angle.   Your comment about Jonathan Kent is a perfect example. Somewhere in that movie they needed a voice of caution. Someone to provide Clark with a reality check and for me it was right on the mark. It veered away from the Jonathan Kent of other iterations, but made perfect sense for a movie that was taking the source material and grounding it with the complications of real life. There needed to be a dissenting voice, and it made sense it would be his adoptive father who raised him and was invested in Clark's safety.  Changes like this I think are a necessary part of translating comic books to the movie screen. The conflict comes from people being too attached to the source material and not giving the filmmakers the latitude to bring a fresh perspective to these characters and stories that have been around for over 70 years. It's just my opinion, but if you look at MOS on it's own and not compare it to the thousands of comics, tv shows and movies that preceded it, it is good in it's own right."
DC_Cinematic,32vlu1,aircycle,-1,Mon Apr 20 16:35:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think I articulated my point around Jonathan Kent particularly well. I don't care about accuracy to the source material. I'm a DC fan, but I'm not a Superman (or even a Batman) fan. I am aware that the treatment in the movie differs from some of the comics, but my problem was the fact that the character was (in my opinion) underdeveloped and poorly written.   I also disagree that Superman is some new take on the comic books. The tone is clearly an attempt to cash in on the previous Batman trilogy (which was pretty good on average, and great in parts). The theme of free will and personal choice was only really touched on, and barely featured in the final decision to confront Zod as Zod never really gave him a choice. What was Clark's legitimate alternative that he could have struggled to have chosen to do, in place of the actions he did? If the point was to compare Clark's decisions to those of Zods, then that came across as ham-fisted, and was undermined by the fact that the character was written as weak, never demonstrating the abilities that presumably got him to the rank he had. That's no offence to the actor, who I thought did a great job with a weak script.  Also, the reaction of the world in that movie was as comic-book as it comes. Even so, the depth given is hardly any deeper than the decisions Tony Stark had to make in Iron Man 2 around his own personal crisis and the effect of the suit on world stability. You can read anything into any movie, at that level.  It's great that BvS will touch on the consequences. It was the execution that failed MoS, not necessarily the intentions. That's why I'm optimistic about BvS. I hope they'll keep the bits of MoS that worked, and fix the bits that made it (in my opinion) sadly underwhelming..."
DC_Cinematic,32vlu1,TheMurderCapitalist,2,Tue Apr 21 08:29:52 2015 UTC,"If you're not a fan of DC, Superman or Batman, why bother watching the movies? Even worse, why go online to complain about them? Obviously nothing they do will satisfy you. You're acting like a troll. Keep your comments to yourself."
DC_Cinematic,32vlu1,WildEndeavor,2,Tue Apr 21 13:47:57 2015 UTC,"You've not read my post properly. I am a fan of DC. I read more DC comics than Marvel comics. I don't read a lot of Superman (and not much Batman), but the DC cinematic universe will be a lot more than just those two characters. Lastly, if it's a requirement to be a fan of Superman or Batman already to enjoy the movies, then WB are in for a financial shock, as there are nowhere near enough of either to support the production of the films. The film series will live or die on the support of the more casual movie going audience. We'll have to agree to disagree. I will say though that it's attitudes like yours - calling people trolls for voicing their opinions, instructing them to be quiet, insulting people for ""not getting it"" with no supporting evidence if they didn't enjoy a movie - that are toxic to the online community. We'll call it quits there. I'm glad you enjoyed the movies, I hope you enjoy BvS, and I hope I enjoy BvS for opening up the rich DC universe. I hope one day you can look back on people's genuine criticisms and opinions without the need to personally attack them."

DC_Cinematic,32vlu1,davemello84,0,Sun Apr 19 16:31:00 2015 UTC,"People are going to complain until DC puts out a movie as universally loved as Iron Man or GoTG. (Even though The Dark Knight isn't even ten years old yet and it's arguably the most well-received superhero film ever, somehow that's arbitrarily ruled out of the discussion.) Most fans have no problems with Marvel's creative license usage and the things they change and the mistakes they make here and there, they're comfortable ignoring the fact that IM3 and Thor 2 and almost all of the Marvel movies that aren't part of the shared Disney universe are basically dogshit, and this is because there has been a general consensus formed that Marvel is out there hitting home runs and DC is sucking ass. So that's the popular and safe consensus to conform to, which means everyone will be dogging DC until a DC film or two is critically successful, then all the fanboys (I hate using that word but that's what these people are) will be inclined to conform to that consensus. Until then, you can expect fans to toe the party line."
DC_Cinematic,32vlu1,davemello84,8,Fri Apr 17 19:16:08 2015 UTC,The hypocrisy of Marvel fanboys orgasming over the Daredevil series (which is indeed awesome) while bashing DC for a more serious tone is comical.
DC_Cinematic,32vlu1,jasonhaven,3,Sat Apr 18 09:22:39 2015 UTC,"I like Daredevil the most out of all Marvel properties. I think with their movies they have begun to sacrifice risk and originality for guaranteed cash flow formula, and if they don't change it soon DC is going to bury them.   They need to take some cues from their Daredevil success. Just because Dark is a negative buzzword doesn't mean Stop Having Fun."
DC_Cinematic,32vlu1,Mgdossantos,1 point,Sat Apr 18 13:35:04 2015 UTC,"Well, I think people loving the dark tone of Daredevil comes from the fact that it's a departure in tone from the other films. Those people who bash on DC films being too dark since 2006 think so because they have only been dark. I have a lot of friends who hated Man of Steel, have no interest in BvS but are super stoked for Suicide Squad, because it has the potential to be very fun, and that will be a departure compared to other DC films. It's about balance. You can't just have serious films, and you can't just have campy films. Not in these kind of franchises."
DC_Cinematic,32vlu1,teo1315,3,Sat Apr 18 21:36:02 2015 UTC,"There are people who dislike the dark tone because they're tired of it and want something new, and people who just dislike it for the sake of not liking it."

DC_Cinematic,32vlu1,IronAvengerr,9,Sat Apr 18 03:46:57 2015 UTC,"Hate myself for watching it, but I did. Some thoughts...  I like the way they are playing with how a super being would be received by humans. They're really digging into the pathos of a world of super powered people.  It's darker than I was expecting.  They seem to hint that Batman is indeed the villain. I thought their conflict might be more philosophical, but in one of the vo's it sounds like Alfred warning Bruce about what it takes for a good man to turn evil... implying Batman was heading down a bad path.  I really like that they are taking Superman and the others on a real journey. I like that before these characters can be heroes there is a gauntlet they must first pass through in order to prove themselves.  Good teaser. Looking forward to seeing the movie."
DC_Cinematic,32vlu1,dc_fanboyforever,8,Fri Apr 17 16:24:30 2015 UTC,"It's funny though, Alfred's comment could also apply to Luthor or a rogue Superman as well as Bats. Very cool line.  I love your point about the heroes having to prove themselves, and totally agree. Seeing them come together at the end of this or at the beginning of JL and feeling like they earned their spot as humanity's saviors will just be so much sweeter than the way the Avengers were brought together. This trailer shows that there is some true dissension among the people on how the roles of Superman and others will fit into humanity's future."

DC_Cinematic,32vlu1,raise_the_sails,2,Sat Apr 18 04:52:58 2015 UTC,"it's a different batman than the movies we've seen but i feel he'll still be deeply rooted from his comic origins. I do feel that Lex will be a loud public voice of opposition against Superman while Bruce may be evasive in interviews if it's brought up, but privately as Batman he's looking for a way to stop Superman if he does get out of control or turn his powers on the people.   EDIT: It actually reminds me of Lex's own book in a way where lex approached Bruce Wayne(not batman obviously) for help in finding a way to contain superman should he get out of hand. I can't remember the title off the top of my head but it was a great read. Looking at Superman through Lex's eyes was pretty interesting and very convincing."

Looks like a certain Riddler trophy. Maybe for our first introduction to Batman, we get a classic ""Riddler has bombs across the city, time to clean this up"" sequence where we see how well Batman deals with opposition.

DC_Cinematic,32vlu1,TrashTongueTalker,6,Sat Apr 18 01:42:59 2015 UTC,"I'm fucking stoked for Jeremy Irons as Alfred.   Jeremy Irons has always had this sinister, authoritative voice with touches of sanctimony and elder wisdom.   His one scene in 2002's The Time Machine as the film's villain was saved by his menacing presence and voice alone. The only reason I suffered through The Borgias was because as Jeremy Irons' portrayal of a controversial and historically vilified Pope Alexander VI was magnificent-I hope he gets to showcase such a range as Alfred.   Pairing him with Ben Affleck, whom I've been a fan of since Daredevil (I was 13 and it was my first exposure to him) and who has time and again proven his chops lately is a winning combination.   I hope Scoot McNairy is playing Dick Grayson, because he is a phenomenal actor as well-if he brings to this what he brings to Halt and Catch Fire the Batfamily will be off to a spectacular start.   And of course we have Henry Cavill, who IMO was perfect as Superman in MoS, he sold the unsure but benevolent soul searching Clark Kent to me in his first scene. I'm betting he'll be reluctant to fight Batman.   Last of all, let's not forget the return of Amy Adams as Lois Lane. I'm excited to see her defending the Super-god against an apparently vocal, venomous anti-Superman crusade.   Oh, and I forgot Eisenberg! Say what you will about his voice, his build, his look but he looks like one of those post-Apple tech startup hipster geek millionaires and if he brings his Social Network acting skills to this it's going to be one spectacular movie.  When I see a new Marvel trailer, I know what I'm expecting, I pretty much know what I'm going to get when the movie comes out. With BvS, I have no fucking clue what is going to go down or how it will end. I like Marvel Studios, but BvS is going to be the gamechanger for superhero films."

DC_Cinematic,32y7je,agnosgnosia,2,Fri Apr 17 20:24:47 2015 UTC,Because Feige already said that it's going to be Peter Parker. I also don't think Marvel Studios is going to throw a curve ball and have a black Peter Parker.
DC_Cinematic,32y7je,agnosgnosia,-3,Sat Apr 18 00:51:14 2015 UTC,"Why can't Peter Parker be black, though?"
DC_Cinematic,32y7je,IAmLuckyDuckling,3,Sat Apr 18 01:44:54 2015 UTC,He can. They could also cast a black Superman in the next movie Superman is in. The reason I don't think that will be happening is because Spiderman is the face of Marvel like Superman (sigh ok Batman too) is the face of DC.
DC_Cinematic,32y7je,TheBowerHouse,0,Sat Apr 18 02:07:58 2015 UTC,I would find absolutely NOTHING wrong with a Black Superman. What is your fucking problem?

I thought I was looking at a second of Arkham game footage at first.   edit: And he's using a voice modulator, at least for the shot where he's in the armored suit. It sounds a lot like the one they use in Arrow and comes across a lot clearer than Bale's bat voice."

DC_Cinematic,32xmv0,TrashTongueTalker,4,Fri Apr 17 15:52:41 2015 UTC,"I guess this is the perfect place for me to voice my thoughts on this user, Bodie293.  It seems that as a whole, the community of this sub does a good job of keeping all discussions in one relevant thread without rampant re-posts.  However, almost everyday, no matter how big or small the news, Bodie293 always shares a link from comicbook.com without ever providing any discussion.  Sometimes, there will already be a very active thread about a topic, and Bodie293 will post the exact same information above it in a link as a new thread, which ends up dividing discussions and cluttering the sub.  Look at his post history, he almost exclusively exists to post links to the same website all over comic-related subs.  He doesn't seem to be aware of any discussions, nor does he seem to care if they already exist.  I believe this account belongs to a writer for comicbook.com - one that thinks linking to all of his own content is an inconspicuous method of generating clicks, and therefore, views.  Every time I refresh this sub when I get chances throughout the day, I roll my eyes when I see that he's posted yet another link to comicbook.com without even attempting to look like he's trying to start a discussion.  Perhaps I have given this too much thought, but I think this needs to be addressed.  Everyone here loves DC and hopes to contribute to a place that actively celebrates the new movies.  Does anyone else think my argument has merit?  What do the mods think of Bodie293?"
DC_Cinematic,32xmv0,ManagerMurrayHewitt,3,Fri Apr 17 16:48:50 2015 UTC,"I by no means speak for the entire mod team, but I will say three things:  In general, the attitude is that if it doesn't detract from our focus on live action DC films, the community can police reposts and such with downvotes, not commenting, etc. This is the reason we delete posts about cartoons or the Arrow-verse shows, but not reposts. We feel as though it is a matter the community can address.  The second thing I would say is that there is, as the rules stand now, no banned news sites on /r/DC_Cinematic. Though some way want sites like Latino Review or Comicbookmovie.com or Moviepilot to be not allowed, we feel again that this is the type of content easily policed by the community. Especially because we never know where a scoop will come from (The usually wrong Latino Review was right about the BvS trailer stuff let's not forget).  Finally, rule 4 of the subreddit does disallow news that does not link to the original source (effectively banning twitter accounts like superherohype) but we can't catch everything. If you feel that a post is breaking sub rules, report it. If you feel a user is breaking rules, message the mod team and we'll look into it.  There's four mods on this subreddit and 1,500+ subscribers. We need your help to maintain an orderly community."

DC_Cinematic,32qq6f,IAmLuckyDuckling,15,Wed Apr 15 23:46:53 2015 UTC,The screenplay is being penned by Jason Fuchs.

DC_Cinematic,32qq6f,dc_fanboyforever,2,Thu Apr 16 04:34:58 2015 UTC,Well I think his script won a few awards.  That's why an up in comer who's break out movie hasn't even come out yet is getting the shot at writing a big project like Wonder Woman.
DC_Cinematic,32qq6f,Justice_Prince,3,Thu Apr 16 05:14:02 2015 UTC,"Okay, cool."
DC_Cinematic,32qq6f,IAmLuckyDuckling,9,Thu Apr 16 00:07:51 2015 UTC,"Jenkins has stronger writing credits than MacLaren, though MacLaren has a little more action experience, but nothing on the level of a tent-pole film... since most of that gets handled by the visual effects houses anyways, erring on the side of a writer may be a good thing."

DC_Cinematic,32qvg5,BattleReadyPenguin,7,Wed Apr 15 23:59:05 2015 UTC,"ehhhhh i would be fine if this did happen, but idk she looks a little too american to be hippolyta IMO, but i wouldn't be mad"
DC_Cinematic,32qvg5,rebelinthought12345,4,Thu Apr 16 00:23:00 2015 UTC,"Everything suggest they're attempting for a period piece, meaning that the Amazons are essentially immortal.  Unfortunately, this means that Carter's age would show too much for an immortal, despite looking exceptional for her age.  I'm more excited at the prospect of Charlize Theron as Hippolyta since Jenkins directed her to an Academy Award for Best Actress in 2003's Monster and because she's a WB darling right now with Fury Road."
DC_Cinematic,32qvg5,demasx,5,Thu Apr 16 00:43:43 2015 UTC,she would actually be awesome as any amazon
DC_Cinematic,32qvg5,rebelinthought12345,1 point,Thu Apr 16 02:03:36 2015 UTC,"Other then a rumor that came out about a year ago I don't see what's been pointing to it being a period piece.  Either way it would make sense for the Amazons to be immortal.  I don't think they'll be going with the rape pirate explanation, and if Diana isn't going to be made from clay then I doubt they'll use that explanation for the rest of the Amazons.  Although I'd actually like Hippolyta look fairly matronly.  Who knows how old Hippolyta was when she came to the island.  I'd put her in her late 40's at least."
DC_Cinematic,32qvg5,Justice_Prince,0,Thu Apr 16 02:59:17 2015 UTC,"I don't see what's been pointing to it being a period piece.   Mostly Devin Faraci's reporting, who posted about the time periods as recently as today."
DC_Cinematic,32qvg5,demasx,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:10:54 2015 UTC,Seems like he's now claiming that the movie will be set during the Crimean War.  I'm just calling BS on the whole thing.
DC_Cinematic,32qvg5,Justice_Prince,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:35:57 2015 UTC,"There's a certain degree of common sense to it as well.  Whether she likes it or not, Wonder Woman is tied to feminism and isn't judged purely on her own merits as a character or story, but also the message that she puts forward about such ideals.  The problem is that in a modern setting, pluralistic society hasn't even decided or agreed upon what feminism is or should be and there's a certain amount of in-fighting.  It's too risky to take a strong position on that in modern times and alienate your audience.  So a period piece allows you to go back to a time when there was more unity in the feminist cause because they were fighting for more baseline ideals... similar to how Captain American needs to start as a period piece because unwavering patriotism is jingoism in modern times but a virtue when fighting Nazis.  Then, after your character's baseline is established, you can challenge that with more nuance.  Irrespective of the actual period picked, I'll take the bet that Wonder Woman's first film is a period piece in part if not entirely."
DC_Cinematic,32qvg5,demasx,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:46:38 2015 UTC,"If this was an independent movie separate from the Cinematic Universe, or even just the first introduction of the character then I might agree with that.  With her showing up in first in BvS it just seems like such a big step backwards to make her solo movie a period piece that it seems incompressible."
DC_Cinematic,32qvg5,Justice_Prince,1 point,Thu Apr 16 04:07:37 2015 UTC,"Not really.  She's not going to espouse her politics or positions beyond a superficial level in BvS and nor is the audience expecting her to.  However, in her solo film it's demanded of her and it's tough waters to navigate and say, ""This is what women should believe and be"" in a modern setting... so expect them to properly dodge that with a period setting... the character was literally written nearly a century ago so in a sense it's more accurate to go back there.  It would only be incomprehensible if the DCCU needs a modern Wonder Woman story to advance forwards, but I don't think it does.  Modern Wonder Woman tends to be steeped in military / government interaction, but that's already covered by MOS, Suicide Squad, and very likely BvS (with Washington being a story location and Holly Hunter cast as a Senator).  And probably Justice League too (given some degree of gov't sanction is required).  It would almost be incomprehensible to retread government liaisons a FOURTH time in Wonder Woman, before getting to Justice League, when you could tell a story that goes more to the root of what she means as symbol."
DC_Cinematic,32qvg5,demasx,1 point,Thu Apr 16 04:22:24 2015 UTC,"A prequel is completely a step back when they've already established Wonder Woman in modern time.  Also with Superman being the ""first superhero"" they'd have to jump through too many hoops   The most obvious choice for a modern day Wonder Woman movie would be something like Gods & Mortals, or the Animated Feature where Ares tries to start WW3 so he can feed off the psychic energy.  Could be cool, but might overplay the government themes that are already in the other movies.  Also kinda begs the question as to why Batman or Superman aren't stepping in with something that big, and while I'd be fine with other heroes showing up in her movie I'd argue that Wonder Woman should get to stand on her own without either of the other two from the Trinity showing up.  I think the simple solution would be to set the movie almost entirely on Themyscira.  It would make more sense why Batman or Superman wouldn't show up, and sidesteps any US government involvement.  It would also be a good setting to explore those gender issue without getting bogged down in modern day gender politics.  Also with this happening after BvS I think it would be interested to see them skip past the ""stranger in a strange land"" story and instead see one about her trying to reacclimate herself to her original home.  Storywise I think they could still go with the same thing of Ares likely with the help of Circe trying to start a war so he can feed off the psychic energy.  In this case though it would be causing the Amazons to go to war with a likely just as isolated civilization.  Could be the Amazons of Bana Mighdall, or if they want to play with gender differences the Gargareans.  If they really want to focus of building the Cinematic Universe I say make it a war between the Amazons, and Atlantians.  We could get a quick peek of Atlantis, see Wonder Woman and Aquaman trade blows shortly, and maybe get Clea as a third villain."
DC_Cinematic,32qvg5,Justice_Prince,1 point,Thu Apr 16 05:12:08 2015 UTC,"Not really.  You're letting your position dictate your judgment, which seems off if you're raising the ""first superhero"" issue given we know Batman is a veteran.  It's a non-issue."
DC_Cinematic,32qvg5,demasx,1 point,Thu Apr 16 05:26:14 2015 UTC,"Well Batman can exist on a low profile, and even if he is more known he's still just a human.  Having another metahuman active before Superman is a much different thing, and a lot harder to explain away."

Batman glaring from the shadows. Maybe a voice-over.  (Edit) Or, even better - Luthor/Eisenberg voice-over.  Hopefully there will be a shot of Wonder Woman.  Lois looking concerned during a somewhat ominous section of the voice-over (assuming there is one).  Blackout. Explosion, panic sounds, BWWAAAMMMM. Logo coming together.  Superman speeding off.   I'll take just about anything, really."

We will probably see quick shots of batmobile in action, spliced with Clark kent leading normal life (daily planet, visiting mother with lois lane). Maybe some dialogue from Lex explaining some master plan to take supes out to bats, to which culminates into a shot of them doing a DBZ style stare down out in the stormy night before we cut to black and see logo with a version of main BvS:DoJ soundtrack. But, that's just what I'm hoping for.   Edit: grammar"
DC_Cinematic,32piju,invisiblack,9,Thu Apr 16 00:31:09 2015 UTC,I want it to have soundtrack from the movie instead of a generic one.
DC_Cinematic,32piju,_ASAK_,14,Wed Apr 15 21:54:43 2015 UTC,Junkie and Hanz are composing something unique for the trailer.

DC_Cinematic,32q7kd,LordCommanderStark,3,Wed Apr 15 20:54:01 2015 UTC,"I heard he's playing Hugo Strange. I'm not going to dismiss any casting at such an early stage, but this decision is the one I'm most skeptical about if it's true."
DC_Cinematic,32oi0u,timetravlrfromthepst,24,Wed Apr 15 13:05:09 2015 UTC,It really shows how huge this movies is when the classification and running time of a teaser trailer is considered news.
DC_Cinematic,32oi0u,Jangwin,15,Wed Apr 15 13:08:54 2015 UTC,"hype levels are now hovering dangerously close to the sun, hope we don't get burned again"

DC_Cinematic,32oi0u,Shinglemedibits,-4,Wed Apr 15 15:30:16 2015 UTC,"It's coming out on the 3rd of the 25th month!  But really, if the first number was smaller how would I know what dating method was being used?"
DC_Cinematic,32oi0u,Thomassaurus,3,Wed Apr 15 14:36:13 2015 UTC,25/03/2016   Looks fine to me.
DC_Cinematic,32oi0u,invisiblack,2,Wed Apr 15 15:36:50 2015 UTC,Different countries use different systems. Day first just makes more sense to me.
DC_Cinematic,32oi0u,mithhunter55,2,Wed Apr 15 19:04:50 2015 UTC,Yes i know =P I was asking how to tell the difference.
DC_Cinematic,32oi0u,Thomassaurus,-16,Wed Apr 15 19:33:29 2015 UTC,"wtf, is this some /r/HailCorporate shit? I didn't even know trailers had a rating system.   GIVE ME A REAL TRAILER!"

DC_Cinematic,32pae4,Jkbdm,7,Wed Apr 15 16:49:44 2015 UTC,Same. Never have I been more excited for a movie trailer
DC_Cinematic,32pae4,BlackenBlueShit,6,Wed Apr 15 17:43:51 2015 UTC,"The excitement for this trailer is some Star Wars shit, really."
DC_Cinematic,32pae4,LordCommanderStark,5,Wed Apr 15 17:58:21 2015 UTC,"I just can't believe that after countless rumors, the trailer will finally be here.

DC_Cinematic,32pae4,timetravlrfromthepst,3,Wed Apr 15 20:40:03 2015 UTC,To think we'll all be discussing a five second clip tomorrow is hilarious and exciting at the same time. And then a possible TWO MINUTE LONG trailer to come on the 20th? I could die happy.
DC_Cinematic,32pae4,thelastbrew,3,Wed Apr 15 18:12:36 2015 UTC,"Any predictions for the 5 second clip?(assuming the rumor is true).  I'm picturing the camera in Supe's perspective, floating down towards the ground in a junkyard facing Batman."
DC_Cinematic,32pae4,thelastbrew,2,Wed Apr 15 18:15:34 2015 UTC,"I think it's going to show batman, superman, lex, the 2nd villain, and batman fighting superman. Maybe we will hear batman talk.  Honestly, I'm so excited becAuse no matter who batman is facing in this movie he will be the underdog. There's never been a live action movie where batman is so vulnerable."

Until Zack fucking Snyder tweets out something, I think we can pretty solidly assume Latino Review is wrong LIKE IT ALWAYS IS.  I hope they're not wrong this time, but I'm sure they will be.  Edit: just read the collider article, that's one credible source."
DC_Cinematic,32myb1,IAmLuckyDuckling,17,Wed Apr 15 02:25:40 2015 UTC,"Hello, are you willing to accept HYPE as your lord and savior?"
DC_Cinematic,32myb1,LordCommanderStark,9,Wed Apr 15 02:31:29 2015 UTC,I used to have HYPE in my heart. Where is he?  Well...
DC_Cinematic,32myb1,IAmLuckyDuckling,13,Wed Apr 15 02:40:26 2015 UTC,"The title reads ""Larry Fong just tweeted this!""  He is a cinematographer for BvS."

DC_Cinematic,32myb1,IAmLuckyDuckling,8,Wed Apr 15 02:37:15 2015 UTC,"I'd have to agree. But a member of the crew feeding into a rumor as a ""joke"" seems like bad business for WB/DC.

DC_Cinematic,32m8ny,timetravlrfromthepst,3,Tue Apr 14 23:06:12 2015 UTC,Yeah this is complete bogus. Warner Bros. isn't going to waste their first introduction of the film on a five second clip.  Edit: It seems that Collider has also posted this story. Huh...
DC_Cinematic,32m8ny,thelastbrew,2,Tue Apr 14 22:58:55 2015 UTC,Are they sourcing this? I won't trust it if there's not an independent second source.
DC_Cinematic,32m8ny,IAmLuckyDuckling,5,Wed Apr 15 01:01:43 2015 UTC,"From the Collider Article   [...] We can separately confirm Mayimbe’s story—in fact, Steve was in the middle of writing up this exact same scoop when Mayimbe broke the news.   they can't confirm the trailer being shown in front of Age of Ultron though. Having the BvS trailer and the Star Wars trailer would be a thing of beauty"
DC_Cinematic,32m8ny,Come_mai,2,Wed Apr 15 01:20:10 2015 UTC,"Well, at least that's one credible source."

DC_Cinematic,32m8ny,Boopa1219,-1,Wed Apr 15 18:25:38 2015 UTC,I am. He's been right before as well as being wrong.
DC_Cinematic,32m8ny,JeweliusCaesar,0,Wed Apr 15 18:35:04 2015 UTC,"The only times I remember him being wrong are in regards to the trailer coming out with Jupiter Ascending and Adam Driver being up for playing Nightwing in BvS, he was actually up for the role of Lex. So he was close on that"
DC_Cinematic,32m8ny,Boopa1219,8,Wed Apr 15 19:45:43 2015 UTC,Being fully corroborated by Collider and other outlets. Will most likely be online Monday to coincide with International release of Age of Ultron. ITS HAPPENING.
DC_Cinematic,32m8ny,BarbequeMeat,16,Tue Apr 14 23:02:33 2015 UTC,Lol imagine the first 5 seconds is literally just the Warner Brothers logo xD

DC_Cinematic,32m8ny,Jkbdm,5,Wed Apr 15 01:27:42 2015 UTC,It's also interesting to see how these guys had the date of the trailer two days ago

DC_Cinematic,32n4ga,aircycle,4,Wed Apr 15 02:53:38 2015 UTC,Was about to post this before the teaser rumors began.
DC_Cinematic,32n4ga,invisiblack,2,Wed Apr 15 04:17:12 2015 UTC,I wonder which role is the one he was offered. I heard his name brought up for both Rick Flag and Deathstroke.
DC_Cinematic,32n4ga,The_Dirtiest_Beef,2,Wed Apr 15 06:52:36 2015 UTC,I'd wager Rick Flagg probably
DC_Cinematic,32n4ga,TheMurderCapitalist,2,Wed Apr 15 12:33:12 2015 UTC,"That's what I would guess, also. Deathstroke seemed to be the more popular rumor so if it's not the role everyone thought, it would be Rick Flag"
DC_Cinematic,32mmru,BattleReadyPenguin,4,Wed Apr 15 00:28:23 2015 UTC,That can't happen because SS takes place between Man of Steel and Batman v. Superman
DC_Cinematic,32mmru,Boopa1219,2,Wed Apr 15 18:05:08 2015 UTC,"Would be great, but what does everyone think of DC's attitude to mid/post credits? I myself am not too sure theyll include them, they'd be accused of copying Marvel way too much, although they are the 'done' thing now, and it works perfectly for shared universes."
DC_Cinematic,32mmru,BarbequeMeat,2,Wed Apr 15 00:54:47 2015 UTC,"The reason that Man of Steel is because Nolan, who was a producer on the film, stated that a real movie would not have mid/end credit scenes. I hope they carry on that and maybe have a short scene before the credits role that teases something for the next DC film."
DC_Cinematic,32mmru,thelastbrew,3,Wed Apr 15 01:47:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this. If anything it will be one of the very last scenes of the movie. Same type of deal, exempt technically not in the credits."
DC_Cinematic,32mmru,thelastbrew,7,Wed Apr 15 02:08:53 2015 UTC,Like the ending of Batman Begins

DC_Cinematic,32mek4,KidK0dy,4,Wed Apr 15 18:00:09 2015 UTC,"Ok the first half of this news is ok but what makes this really sketchy is the second half when they say it will be attached to age of ultron. Why would Disney want to promote a Warner Bros superhero movie? I don't know about this news. Really taking it with a gain of salt, nonetheless I'm still gonna check for the 5 second preview and Zack's twitter."
DC_Cinematic,32mek4,deonist,8,Wed Apr 15 00:23:54 2015 UTC,The Dark Knight Rises trailer was attached to Avengers. I think it's a great idea for both studios to use each other for publicity.
DC_Cinematic,32mek4,ferncaz95,6,Wed Apr 15 01:11:26 2015 UTC,"Oh that's actually really interesting, I'm always hearing people talk about how DC comics has to market BvS intelligently against Avengers or they will just be the second most interesting thing in movie news. But otherwise if WB thinks it's smart to do that, then we'll see a trailer even sooner."
DC_Cinematic,32mek4,deonist,4,Wed Apr 15 01:27:40 2015 UTC,Man of Steel was also attached to Iron Man 3

DC_Cinematic,32jfea,reddv06,1 point,Tue Apr 14 19:28:59 2015 UTC,"I think he's Slade Wilson (pre-Deathstroke) or, and hopefully, Dick Grayson/Agent Grayson, who's infiltrated ARGUS. He's probably going to be Steve Trevor though..."

DC_Cinematic,32m3b1,YaHerdWithPerd,2,Thu Apr 16 01:24:38 2015 UTC,"and post- The Avengers, box office sales goes up for the phase 2 films. its a simple strategy."
DC_Cinematic,32m3b1,MiQBonafide,7,Tue Apr 14 22:09:29 2015 UTC,Casual audience knows more about individual heroes from DC today than they knew about individual heroes from Marvel back then when MCU first began.
DC_Cinematic,32m3b1,invisiblack,4,Tue Apr 14 22:24:13 2015 UTC,"I think it's a better idea than having individual films and then the team up. Justice League is going to give everyone a taste of these characters. Everyone knows the Justice League, they may not know the individual members but that's what the movie will show, we'll meet them all and then once they are established in peoples minds I think they'll be much more likely to see their solo movies."
DC_Cinematic,32m3b1,AskMeAboutMy_Comics,2,Tue Apr 14 22:14:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think they are rushing or behind. I think there is more than one way to develop a cinematic universe. hell, they could have started with justice league and it could have worked fine."
DC_Cinematic,32m3b1,S0ckHeaven,2,Wed Apr 15 01:08:37 2015 UTC,"I think it's better the way they have it.  Wonder Woman was the only one who really needed a solo movie before Justice League.  We know enough about Batman that he doesn't need a solo movie right away.  Superman didn't exactly need a solo movie, but his film was a good way to  establish the universe.  Green Lantern and Flash could have gotten movies before, but they don't need one.  They both have recent introductions in other media, and very simple origins so they could just be thrown in without it being an issue.  Personally I think it's better to save these two big characters to make their first appearance in Justice League.  Aquaman and Cyborg might need a little more introduction, but they also can't carry their own movie until they've been properly established.  We do get to see them in other movies before Justice League.  Both will be in BvS.  I'm betting Aquaman will also get a cameo in Wonder Woman, and Cyborg could get one in Suicide Squad."
DC_Cinematic,32m3b1,Justice_Prince,2,Wed Apr 15 04:04:24 2015 UTC,"Let's state the obvious first. WB/DC are behind. Way behind. The superhero genre in the movie industry is in its prime right now and like most things, the genre will die out sooner or later. With that said, WB/DC just doesn't have the time to follow Marvel's formula.   However, DC and Marvel are very different. One could argue that DC's properties (Batman, Superman, and yes, even The Flash) are better known among the casual audience than say Iron Man was before Marvel's cinematic universe came into play. By introducing the lesser-known characters (Flash) alongside the better-known characters (Batman) first, WB/DC saves time and money by developing solo films after the team-up.  Would an individual Aquaman/Cyborg/Flash film help build momentum for the team-up film? Sure. But is it absolutely necessary to get people in the theaters for the team-up film like it was for, say, Marvel? No."
DC_Cinematic,32m3b1,thelastbrew,3,Tue Apr 14 22:18:13 2015 UTC,That's what was in the back of my mind before asking this.   Great answer.
DC_Cinematic,32m3b1,doyleb3620,2,Tue Apr 14 22:44:24 2015 UTC,"With DC, let's be honest--there are two heavy hitters, Batman and Superman, the most well known superheroes in America. The others, Green Lantern, Cyborg, Aquaman, Flash, are relatively unknown. I mean yeah, Joe Shome might be able to tell you that they exist, but he couldn't tell you anything about them.  So what do you do? You draw people to JL with Batman and Superman, then have the other members steal some scenes. Now, the audience is excited to see a Cyborg movie, instead of saying, ""Who the hell is that Terminator ripoff?"""
DC_Cinematic,32lm9b,zen_mutiny,6,Tue Apr 14 19:48:15 2015 UTC,"There's probably more people who are a fan of both (even though everyone has a preference), than there are people who like one and not the other."

DC_Cinematic,32gkfu,BarbequeMeat,2,Mon Apr 13 17:55:15 2015 UTC,"He probably had some notes here and there but his name is a marketing tool in and of itself. Also, the script must not suck because I don't feel Nolan is the type to stay on board just for money."
DC_Cinematic,32gkfu,ThunderHawkLives,-3,Mon Apr 13 20:20:22 2015 UTC,Ben Affleck getting Top Billing just helps further enforce my theory that it's basically gonna be a Batman movie for at least half of it. Thats the only way I can imagine introducing a new Batman to the audience is gonna work.
DC_Cinematic,32gkfu,BardicFire,4,Mon Apr 13 17:52:05 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'm not too sure about that. A Batman movie with a lot of Lois and Clark moments sprinkled throughout most likely.  And besides, they'll also have to establish Clark's new status as a hero in Metropolis pretty early on in the movie as well."
DC_Cinematic,32gkfu,Capn_C,3,Mon Apr 13 19:07:08 2015 UTC,"It's my understanding that billing is dependant on who has more box office draw, or how much money they can put in. In this case, the three most important names are Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill and Gal Gadot (first, second and last). Affleck would have the most box office draw, surely, especially after Gone Girl. But Cavill has less, he hasn't appeared in many really successful films yet after all, so he gets second billing.   Or is that not the case here?"
DC_Cinematic,32gkfu,Lyfultruth,3,Mon Apr 13 20:07:22 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't use the credits as a reason for that. He is the biggest named actor, so that plays into it. He also is probably getting paid the most. But that doesn't coorelate to the movie basically being a Batman movie, when everything Zack has said about the movie still points to this movie finishing establishing Superman."
DC_Cinematic,32gkfu,S0ckHeaven,2,Mon Apr 13 20:31:07 2015 UTC,"I first saw this headline pop up on my Facebook news feed a few days ago and the majority of comments on it were to the tune of ""Affleck gets top billing! This is supposed to be a Superman sequel, why are they giving Batman top billing? They're ruining Superman!""  When WB/DC came out with their full slated line up back in the summer or fall, they confirmed that this isn't Man of Steel 2. A solo Batman and Man of Steel 2 are in the works and will be released before or around 2020, but they just don't have definitive release dates yet."

This is part of the reason The Flash is so well received, because it's so much more light-hearted compared to everything DC had been doing prior."
DC_Cinematic,32elzf,Jangwin,6,Mon Apr 13 05:27:13 2015 UTC,"A lot of the complaints stem from Superman not being a gritty character, which I understand and that is true, but they seem to think MoS was a lot grittier than it actually was. It was a completely different tone than any other Superman movie ever made, but it reflects how Superman has changed over time, he isn't the big blue boy scout anymore. They're trying to present a Superman who isn't perfect, he struggles with the power that he has and still has a lot to learn before he's the perfect hero that we know and love. I mean I certainly think that's better than presenting us with a Superman like they did in Superman Returns, which to me felt like they were just riding the success of the Reeve era Superman. We get to see Superman grow into the hero we know from the comics, we'll see his character change and I think that is way more interesting than giving us this perfect and idealistic Superman right off the bat, I want to see him grow as a person and have that arc play out, rather than just start out where he already knows how to handle everything and it just ends up being him chasing the bad guy and putting them away."

The whole point of Man of Steel is that Clark is learning who he is and who he wants to become. He's not going to be perfect, he's going to struggle with his powers and the idea that he is basically an alien Jesus. Did Snyder go a overboard by wrecking a good portion of Metropolis? Yeah. He could've toned down the destruction and still gotten the point across, but it still leaves them in a good position to continue the story."

DC_Cinematic,32elzf,XboxNINJA17,9,Mon Apr 13 05:12:13 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair Arrow is on the CW, which compared to most networks has a much lower budget they can offer to their shows. Seeing Arrow come this far as a CW show is astounding, and then Flash taking that leap and going to a whole new level. I loved Daredevil to be sure, but if you ask me Flash is blowing every other comic book show out of the water, there is so much going on at one time but it is not overwhelming in the slightest. In the first season we have gotten Reverse Flash as a main villain, the creation of the Rogues as a team (Captain Cold is especially well done), and Grodd has been given little bits on and off, those are literally the three biggest Flash villains and we're getting every single one in the first season, it's beyond anything I could have expected."
DC_Cinematic,32elzf,KyleRaynerGotSweg,2,Mon Apr 13 07:15:51 2015 UTC,The acting in arrow and flash is fuckin atrocious to be honest. The worst actor in daredevil would be the best actor in arrow. It pains me to say it but it's true. I don't even like marvel comics. All I read is DC
DC_Cinematic,32elzf,XboxNINJA17,10,Tue Apr 14 00:04:41 2015 UTC,"Daredevil is traditionally gritty,  where as Superman is not. I can live in peace with them being the way they are, but I certainly see the point of the people bitching and moaning. Really, with only one movie in the DC universe it's hard to say it's all excessively gritty at the same time, there's always space for a lighter tone outside what we've seen from Snyder."
DC_Cinematic,32elzf,Aacxel,5,Mon Apr 13 04:01:13 2015 UTC,"Right, but Superman could very well develop into what we know from the comics, and we can basically guarantee Flash will be lighthearted and fun given Miller and Lord are involved.   All in due time."
DC_Cinematic,32elzf,IwishIwasGoku,5,Mon Apr 13 05:19:09 2015 UTC,Why do people complain about darker tones so much? Does this have to do with the world getting much softer as a whole?
DC_Cinematic,32elzf,JeweliusCaesar,6,Mon Apr 13 05:52:16 2015 UTC,"I prefer my movies darker. I really enjoyed GOTG but I loved Man of Steel too, long may it continue."
DC_Cinematic,32elzf,BarbequeMeat,2,Mon Apr 13 07:00:39 2015 UTC,"Except for the filter, i didn't notice anything dark and gritty about Man of Steel.  Why do people keep saying that?"
DC_Cinematic,32elzf,Luis_Ignacio,2,Tue Apr 14 15:43:09 2015 UTC,"Daredevil succeeds where Arrow didn't: a realistic look at street-level crimefighting that isn't ashamed to admit it's part of a comic book universe. Even better, it uses its own source material and mythology; and acknowledges influences without copying and pasting the style and tone. Basically, Arrow is Christopher Nolan's Emerald Archer, while Daredevil is its own thing.  (I'm well aware the Arrow team loved Dark Knight, but as far as I can tell, they just painted their copy of the script green. Flash, in comparison fully embraced its superpowered roots, and has more in common with Daredevil than Arrow does.)"
DC_Cinematic,32elzf,MikeyHatesLife,2,Mon Apr 13 13:01:20 2015 UTC,I'd stick with it. Once Kingpin is introduced it takes the thing to a whole new level.

DC_Cinematic,3258yf,Melanismdotcom,7,Fri Apr 10 18:10:22 2015 UTC,Wasn't a fan of his directing in Furious 7. Too many dolly zooms and the fight scenes were disappointingly shot. Aquaman deserves better.
DC_Cinematic,3258yf,recesshustlerkid,5,Sat Apr 11 04:20:25 2015 UTC,"Him or Jeff Nichols...hmm. I feel like Nichols is extremely serious and Wan is extremely great at genre movies. Aquaman has aspects of both, with some serious character moments, politics and motivations, and of course the awesome Atlantean cool badass stuff. I dunno, each of them offers something unique.   I wanna see Midnight Special, Jeff Nichols' new movie, which is about a dad and kid going on the run after the dad finds out the kid has special abilities. Sounds like it could have some more whimsical or magical type scenes. If he pulls that off really well I'd say go after him for Aquaman without a doubt."
DC_Cinematic,3258yf,IwishIwasGoku,9,Fri Apr 10 20:43:14 2015 UTC,"He is good at adapting his style to the kind of movie. Has directed some of the better recent horror movies, and just directed a big time action blockbuster. If he does end up being the choice, I'd be optimistic he could deliver and bring the fantasy/magic aspect of Aquaman to the screen in a way that works well."
DC_Cinematic,3258yf,S0ckHeaven,4,Fri Apr 10 19:58:23 2015 UTC,"I'm cool with this as he is a brilliant director, but I think he would be better for either Shazam (due to Dwayne Johnson being in the film and they have worked together) or Justice League dark as he could be suited for that horror kind of tone.  But still, whatever DC film he directs, hes a great choice."

DC_Cinematic,320rey,IAmLuckyDuckling,3,Thu Apr 9 18:47:22 2015 UTC,it's both.
DC_Cinematic,320rey,LordCommanderStark,12,Thu Apr 9 19:41:47 2015 UTC,"More like El Maybe, 'miright?"
DC_Cinematic,320rey,Jkbdm,11,Thu Apr 9 19:00:06 2015 UTC,Latino review fucking sucks. They throw a bunch of shit to see what sticks. They are the one that hyped joe as deathstroke. I try to avoid their sites and rumors as much as possible.
DC_Cinematic,320rey,Jkbdm,8,Thu Apr 9 18:35:52 2015 UTC,"RIGHT. ugh so annoying. take credit for everything, take accountability for nothing. like the whole ed harris as rick flagg sr. somebody asked ed harris about his involvement when he was promoting run all night, and the next day guess what? elmayimbe on the case. an then he scrambles to keep his image blaming anyone but himself. annoying."
DC_Cinematic,320rey,rebelinthought12345,5,Thu Apr 9 18:47:06 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, he gets a few things right but his success rate is somewhere around 20%. I think the problem is how he presents it. He presents the news as breaking news and nearly official. It gets everyone worked up and then things change. If he presented as an actual rumor mill then I would respect him a lil more. His presenting style creates more buzz but also more harm."
DC_Cinematic,320rey,Quilled,5,Thu Apr 9 19:15:43 2015 UTC,"and when things go wrong, they'll claim they never hyped it up loooool"
DC_Cinematic,320rey,Mudkip4567,8,Thu Apr 9 18:40:35 2015 UTC,He's just a attention whore. I believe nothing that comes out of anyone related to Latino Review.
DC_Cinematic,320rey,invisiblack,5,Thu Apr 9 19:27:55 2015 UTC,Thank you for doing this. some people and even myself have been treating him like a god. It's also weird we haven't seen the actor for King Shark or Eastwood's character in the photos but we see Killer Croc confirmed... A character Gonzalez never even mentioned so let's watch out
DC_Cinematic,320rey,Boopa1219,5,Thu Apr 9 18:41:39 2015 UTC,you are welcome my kind sir. right i've seen people grow too attached to his rumors and it was bugging me. i think he's just chucking stuff out there. he had two confirmed casting rumors on the money for this movie...but has over 10 total rumors surrounding it. when he's wrong about some of it he'll blame someone else no doubt and hype up his own ego
DC_Cinematic,31xuwy,TronVin,15,Thu Apr 9 00:26:18 2015 UTC,Leto has started the Joker transformation and they do not want to reveal him yet most likely
DC_Cinematic,31xuwy,Mudkip4567,3,Thu Apr 9 01:23:34 2015 UTC,Plot twist: He took the picture.

DC_Cinematic,31xuwy,thelastbrew,13,Thu Apr 9 15:01:22 2015 UTC,That is one hell of a cast.
DC_Cinematic,31xuwy,Jangwin,12,Thu Apr 9 00:34:38 2015 UTC,"Wow. Okay so a couple of things come to mind here. 1) Everybody in this picture is glowing. They all look so happy and their amount of excitement is really showing. Based on all of their attitudes alone I'm starting to build some hype in myself about this movie being fantastic. 2) Leto just got off his world tour with 30 Seconds to Mars. I personally think his role will be much smaller than those pictured, and therefore he doesn't really need to be there yet anyway. OR it could mean that Leto is off alone somewhere getting into character?"
DC_Cinematic,31xuwy,invisiblack,8,Thu Apr 9 02:08:51 2015 UTC,I would assume Leto's role is fairly substantial considering he was one of the first actors announced for the film. Perhaps he's the one taking the picture? ;)    Edit: OMG
DC_Cinematic,31xuwy,invisiblack,2,Thu Apr 9 04:04:32 2015 UTC,"Damn, you beat me to it!"
DC_Cinematic,31xuwy,KnightOfTheStupid,3,Thu Apr 9 05:47:32 2015 UTC,1) Everybody in this picture is glowing.   Except for David Ayer who looks like Grumpy Cat.

DC_Cinematic,31xuwy,davemello84,3,Thu Apr 9 02:20:16 2015 UTC,So in Scott Eastwood there and I'm blind or was his casting just a rumor?
DC_Cinematic,31xuwy,Fricktator,5,Thu Apr 9 02:25:08 2015 UTC,He's definitely in the movie but he's not in the picture.

DC_Cinematic,31y4ww,IwishIwasGoku,7,Thu Apr 9 02:01:45 2015 UTC,Just a rumor.
DC_Cinematic,31y4ww,z0r-el,3,Thu Apr 9 02:02:47 2015 UTC,"just a rumor, but i gotta give elmayimbe credit he's been doing fairly alright with casting rumors and this movie"
DC_Cinematic,31y4ww,ShadowofLight15,3,Thu Apr 9 02:03:45 2015 UTC,Ike Barinholtz as Hugo Strange? Wtf!?
DC_Cinematic,31y4ww,_ASAK_,3,Thu Apr 9 01:51:53 2015 UTC,i don't see that at allllll. idk i trust ayer though i guess.
DC_Cinematic,31y4ww,Mandalorianfist,3,Thu Apr 9 02:00:23 2015 UTC,Really hope this isn't true. I thought Manganiello was perfect for Deathstroke.
DC_Cinematic,31y4ww,S0ckHeaven,3,Thu Apr 9 02:49:14 2015 UTC,"right? his face, his build, it would've been so badass. manganiello is definitely out though as he has joined the cast for another movie"
DC_Cinematic,31y4ww,Jkbdm,1 point,Thu Apr 9 02:52:07 2015 UTC,"Well then idk if the title is acurate.. If he's on another project it sounds like he might have jumped ship, and was not replaced by a younger face by WB."
DC_Cinematic,31y4ww,Huntersteve,1 point,Thu Apr 9 07:19:16 2015 UTC,"i think the whole joe manganiello rumor was BS to begin with, or he was asked for the part and didn't join to begin with. timeline of events doesn't make sense."
DC_Cinematic,31y4ww,Jkbdm,3,Thu Apr 9 15:03:04 2015 UTC,"Nothing concerning really, no reason to be worried about any of it."
DC_Cinematic,31y4ww,Jkbdm,2,Thu Apr 9 03:53:09 2015 UTC,Hoyt aka bubba from true blood is deathstroke?
DC_Cinematic,31y4ww,TronVin,2,Thu Apr 9 02:11:22 2015 UTC,good thing or bad thing?  EDIT: i've never seen the show
DC_Cinematic,31y4ww,z0r-el,3,Thu Apr 9 02:13:23 2015 UTC,Bad. So bad. Slade wilson shouldn't have a baby face.
DC_Cinematic,31y4ww,Seanog911,2,Thu Apr 9 02:16:08 2015 UTC,"i'm having a hard time seeing him in the role too! friendly face which is annoying...he doesn't look menacing no sharp defining features. and even though he's tall, he's pretty slight of build, so i'm just not sure."
DC_Cinematic,31xqzb,AskMeAboutMy_Comics,8,Wed Apr 8 23:54:41 2015 UTC,Makes sense. Glad he actually addressed it so we don't have to speculate.

DC_Cinematic,31xqzb,TweetPoster,5,Wed Apr 8 23:54:53 2015 UTC,WB/DC is on top of their shit! I hope this trailer is incredible.
DC_Cinematic,31xqzb,thelastbrew,3,Thu Apr 9 02:09:58 2015 UTC,"I'm so fucking pumped! I can't wait, plus I want to see Mad Max so it works out!"
DC_Cinematic,321fty,Torrrs,7,Thu Apr 9 20:26:51 2015 UTC,fake  the city shot is from here
DC_Cinematic,321fty,Come_mai,3,Thu Apr 9 21:17:54 2015 UTC,"If that is the video if the teaser, it's certainly not the audio.why was Kevin Conroy's voice in it?"
DC_Cinematic,321fty,IAmLuckyDuckling,3,Thu Apr 9 20:41:08 2015 UTC,Do you know where the original audio is from? It sounds really epic. Also the music as well.
DC_Cinematic,321fty,invisiblack,2,Thu Apr 9 20:47:11 2015 UTC,that does sound like conroy right? i wasnt sure
DC_Cinematic,321fty,rebelinthought12345,3,Thu Apr 9 20:57:31 2015 UTC,"Doesn't sound like either Affleck or Eisenberg. Looks like a really good fake, so instead of faking a teaser this would have been better as a fan trailer.  Or its the real thing and I'll eat my words in a month."
DC_Cinematic,321fty,invisiblack,4,Thu Apr 9 20:45:26 2015 UTC,nooooo this cant be the real thing i want mooooore lol
DC_Cinematic,321fty,rebelinthought12345,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:55:32 2015 UTC,"Watch the man of Steel teaser and compare it to the movie, we might get a little more from BvS teaser because its a sequel but not much."
DC_Cinematic,321fty,invisiblack,4,Thu Apr 9 21:00:28 2015 UTC,"yea i know, but i thought we might get something a bit longer, MoS teaser was released 12-13 months before the movie no?"
DC_Cinematic,321fty,rebelinthought12345,1 point,Thu Apr 9 21:33:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think so."
DC_Cinematic,321fty,invisiblack,3,Thu Apr 9 21:41:07 2015 UTC,Fake
DC_Cinematic,321fty,KillerCh33z,5,Thu Apr 9 20:54:03 2015 UTC,"That's kinda horrible if it is the teaser, but I am going to call fake here. It barely has any music and after the tweets from Junkie Xl you would expect some actual theme music."
DC_Cinematic,321fty,Mordkay,2,Thu Apr 9 22:19:26 2015 UTC,Weak
DC_Cinematic,321fty,_ASAK_,1 point,Thu Apr 9 21:07:16 2015 UTC,"First off, that's Kevin Conroy's voice, it's unmistakable. Although I don't know where its from, I know it's him. Secondly Atlas Entertainment is not affiliated with BvS. Definitely fake. The music did sound epic though."
DC_Cinematic,31x0hb,BattleReadyPenguin,10,Wed Apr 8 20:37:25 2015 UTC,"Not really, I'd prefer to keep telling the story, not go back."
DC_Cinematic,31x0hb,S0ckHeaven,3,Wed Apr 8 23:56:05 2015 UTC,I would love too! The more Batman the better.
DC_Cinematic,31x0hb,AaronRoots427,1 point,Wed Apr 8 22:00:27 2015 UTC,"I think it could be a pretty cool idea to follow each Robin's story.   Perhaps frame each one as that character telling their story to the new Robin.   Maybe even just one movie split into a short film for each Robin, maybe even with a different director for each one."
DC_Cinematic,31vkvw,KadinPanti,10,Wed Apr 8 14:31:19 2015 UTC,Curious that he also deleted other tweets mentioning his first viewing of the movie.
DC_Cinematic,31vkvw,mental_reincarnation,5,Wed Apr 8 15:43:38 2015 UTC,Did he comment about the movie?
DC_Cinematic,31vkvw,invisiblack,6,Wed Apr 8 17:31:29 2015 UTC,"No, he only said he was about to watch the movie and posted this picture along with a separate picture with a Batman comic."
DC_Cinematic,31vkvw,mental_reincarnation,8,Wed Apr 8 17:35:34 2015 UTC,"I believe his other tweets have been taken down as well. Is there any credibility to this do you think? He could be referring to movies he'll be scoring, important plot points/arcs, or maybe he just likes those comics. Thoughts?"
DC_Cinematic,31vkvw,IwishIwasGoku,8,Wed Apr 8 14:32:54 2015 UTC,"I think he just wants to show that he's reading stuff to get a feel for how he should score it, not just doing it blind/based on memory. Which brings up the question: why those series? The only relevant one is Wonder Woman.."
DC_Cinematic,31vkvw,invisiblack,13,Wed Apr 8 15:02:08 2015 UTC,Maybe he just bought some comics and wanted to share.
DC_Cinematic,31vkvw,IwishIwasGoku,15,Wed Apr 8 15:03:29 2015 UTC,"Nah, that makes too much sense"
DC_Cinematic,31vkvw,YoureASoldierBodie,7,Wed Apr 8 17:20:21 2015 UTC,But then why delete it?
DC_Cinematic,31vkvw,invisiblack,9,Wed Apr 8 17:41:42 2015 UTC,If people see him tweeting comic books after watching BvS very recently then they will assume the tweet is a hint. He might have realized this after tweeting and deleted his tweet.
DC_Cinematic,31vkvw,YoureASoldierBodie,4,Wed Apr 8 17:46:56 2015 UTC,"I do suspect it's nothing, but he's also deleted the other tweets about the film. Maybe WB told him to knock it off?"
DC_Cinematic,31vkvw,Mandalorianfist,2,Wed Apr 8 20:27:39 2015 UTC,That's pretty convoluted.
DC_Cinematic,31vkvw,invisiblack,-1,Wed Apr 8 20:49:45 2015 UTC,I would assume his publicist is the one who runs his Twitter
DC_Cinematic,31vkvw,2555555555,3,Thu Apr 9 13:25:10 2015 UTC,He already tweeted why he deleted them.
DC_Cinematic,31vkvw,ThunderHawkLives,6,Thu Apr 9 13:26:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I have no idea. All of the issues are seemingly random."
DC_Cinematic,31vkvw,S0ckHeaven,3,Wed Apr 8 14:56:40 2015 UTC,Nightwing is most prominent though.
DC_Cinematic,31u2vn,majorasmaskfan,15,Wed Apr 8 03:57:32 2015 UTC,"This sentence is functional, but seems severely intoxicated."
DC_Cinematic,31u2vn,whitemithrandir,5,Wed Apr 8 04:42:30 2015 UTC,Maybe a touch painful too.
DC_Cinematic,31u2vn,GuppysBalls666,7,Wed Apr 8 07:15:35 2015 UTC,"Had to read it a few times, but I got you.   Call the movie The Green Lantern Corps. Have it feature all three earth heroes, facing off against Sinestro and the Yellow Lanterns, or maybe the Red Lanterns. Either would make great antagonists."
DC_Cinematic,31u2vn,too_many_drugs,3,Wed Apr 8 05:41:47 2015 UTC,"I hope it features some of the other Corps too. Sinestro, Atrocitus, Saint Walker and Star Sapphire (played by Olivia Wilde pls) would be awesome."
DC_Cinematic,31u2vn,Jangwin,3,Wed Apr 8 10:16:29 2015 UTC,If we got a Green Lantern movie featuring Guy Gardner and Saint Walker I think I'd probably cry from pure unadulterated happiness. I can't even begin to think who would be suitable actors for the movie though?
DC_Cinematic,31u2oc,rebelinthought12345,9,Wed Apr 8 03:55:31 2015 UTC,"If they're going to use Doomsday they shouldn't have him be a primary antagonist. He's purely a physical threat to Superman, no where near interesting enough to sustain a whole movie."
DC_Cinematic,31u2oc,Jangwin,3,Wed Apr 8 10:18:20 2015 UTC,i agree- but even a purely physical threat could be used as an important tool to a story. to have there just to be there in order to just have a fight i feel is a waste.
DC_Cinematic,31u2oc,Justice_Prince,1 point,Wed Apr 8 14:20:56 2015 UTC,"It would be insane if they ever did just make a straight up Superman vs Doomsday movie.  Minimal plot, and dialog, but instead basically just two hours of the two of them beating on each other.  The whole movie being one big non stop action sequence."
DC_Cinematic,31u2oc,Justice_Prince,1 point,Thu Apr 9 06:05:08 2015 UTC,"lol that would be the most criticized movie of all time! people (not me!!!) hated MoS for its ""destruction porn"" soooooo  just having him as the plot device to trigger the start of a death of superman kinda thing would be great imo"
DC_Cinematic,31u2oc,Justice_Prince,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:05:02 2015 UTC,Yeah it world get some hate.  It would be interesting to really see a non stop action movie.  Maybe Superman isn't the one to attempt that with though.
DC_Cinematic,31u2oc,S0ckHeaven,3,Fri Apr 10 02:26:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think Doomsday will be in BvS.  I think Bizarro will be the villain although they might barrow partially from Doomsday in terms of character design, and personality."
DC_Cinematic,31u2oc,invisiblack,1 point,Wed Apr 8 12:33:02 2015 UTC,That is interesting. Maybe some sort of Bizarro/Doomsday hybrid character.
DC_Cinematic,31u2oc,Justice_Prince,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:51:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe instead of being a clone of Superman, Bizarro could be the product of Lex trying to create a weapon from Zod's body."
DC_Cinematic,31u2oc,majorasmaskfan,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:58:50 2015 UTC,"I think it will mostly be Bizarro, and called that.  Or at least a single nod to the name is MoS is any evidence.  I think they might borrow a couple visual ques from Doomsday, and he'll be more of just an angry brute rather then doing everything opposite.  I think he should also be just sympathetic enough that they have to find a humane way of defeating him."
DC_Cinematic,31u2oc,TheTrueRedRonin,2,Wed Apr 8 20:12:47 2015 UTC,Seems like a man of steel 3 kind of villain.
DC_Cinematic,31u2oc,TotallyNotKanye,2,Thu Apr 9 00:51:51 2015 UTC,agreed! save him for a superman solo
DC_Cinematic,31u2oc,S0ckHeaven,4,Thu Apr 9 00:56:56 2015 UTC,"No I don't think they would bring him in. The whole point of bringing in doomsday would be to start ramping up for a Death and Return of Superman storyline, and it's much too early for that. Also, if they were to do that storyline, they should get pretty much any other usual Superman villain, because Doomsday is really boring compared to other regulars (Metallo or Parasite could easily fill the roll)"
DC_Cinematic,31sj3s,thelastbrew,8,Tue Apr 7 20:47:51 2015 UTC,"I think it is going to be a full court press.  You better believe WB/DC wants to win 2016. Fox is putting out 3 movies, Marvel 2, it is going to be interesting who comes out ahead in public perception. WB/DC has the horses to do it, if they are confident, you will see it start ramping up big time after the BvS trailer drops."
DC_Cinematic,31sj3s,S0ckHeaven,6,Wed Apr 8 00:00:01 2015 UTC,"My prediction for SDCC is that we will get another BvS:DoJ trailer as well as a panel with the cast and Snyder. From Suicide Squad I only expect some promo pictures, teaser trailer is probable but not likely. Just my predictions, which can change any second."
DC_Cinematic,31sj3s,invisiblack,6,Tue Apr 7 21:06:56 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm thinking the same thing
DC_Cinematic,31sj3s,_ASAK_,5,Tue Apr 7 23:05:36 2015 UTC,"Some footage of Suicide Squad, a trailer for Batman v Superman that won't be released online right away but the final trailer for the film will basically be the comic con trailer (That's what happened with MoS)."
DC_Cinematic,31sj3s,AaronRoots427,2,Wed Apr 8 01:19:00 2015 UTC,Suicide Squad teaser
DC_Cinematic,31sj3s,Mordkay,2,Wed Apr 8 06:01:57 2015 UTC,"Some suicide cast photos (probably joker and harley) , and another batman v superman trailer. Also full cast of bvs panel."
DC_Cinematic,31sj3s,TheUnderAvgAmerican,1 point,Wed Apr 8 13:45:09 2015 UTC,"Maybe something on the Wonder Woman movie. There was a footage last year for BvS, so there might be something as well now for WW...:D"
DC_Cinematic,31rkyo,Bodie293,10,Tue Apr 7 16:49:11 2015 UTC,"I kinda figured they would start BvS with Greyson already moving on to be Nightwing, and Jason being ""dead"".  Figured Tim would be Robin yet though.  I think it would be cool if the first solo movie actually covered both the return of Jason, and the introduction of Tim."
DC_Cinematic,31rkyo,Justice_Prince,5,Tue Apr 7 18:04:17 2015 UTC,"I've always believed that WB would avoid introducing a companion for Batman for at least a few years. I've disagreed with the argument that BvS would become too overcrowded, but would change my mind if they introduced Robin. Let Batman be who he is in this film, a detective and a rash vigilante. I don't want to see him running around with a younger sidekick, at least not this early in the franchise."
DC_Cinematic,31rkyo,thelastbrew,10,Tue Apr 7 17:41:51 2015 UTC,"This isn't early in his career though. If it was I'd agree with you. Also, any Robin would probably be a cameo in BvS but a more important part of the solo Batman movie. We need a proper introduction to an extended batfamily in live action. The Burton and Dark Knight movies have covered solo Batman really well. I'm ready for a serious take on the batfam."
DC_Cinematic,31rkyo,foreignfriend25,4,Tue Apr 7 19:30:39 2015 UTC,"This article suggests that the BatFam will be introduced in BvS. Although Batman is a veteran and Nightwing/Robin may exist in the universe already, I don't think their involvement would be the best for THIS film. I think that a weathered Batman will also mean a weathered companion, which is refreshing from the typical tag-along."
DC_Cinematic,31rkyo,thelastbrew,5,Tue Apr 7 20:40:58 2015 UTC,"Introduced doesn't mean they'll have a big part though. Your earliest post made it seem like you want them to build the batfamily later. What I want, and what I think the rumors are saying is we'll be made aware that they exist in BvS. Batman is going to call them or something, or tell someone Superman is too dangerous and to stay in Gotham. There's no indication the batfamily is going to be standing next to the trinity in the final battle of this movie, just as they don't often show up in JL comic book stories."
DC_Cinematic,31rkyo,foreignfriend25,0,Tue Apr 7 20:51:34 2015 UTC,"I think the route I would like to see it go is basically the comics path, sculpted to fit in this universe.  Dick has been Nightwing for many years.  Jason was Robin & killed several years back.  Tim became Robin later on, then became Red Robin when Batman ""retired""/became less active/became a recluse and started using drones (if that's still a rumor we are believing.  As Batman becomes active again in BvS:DoJ Carrie Kelly becomes interested in becoming Robin, as in DKR."

The League then ignore Luthor completely, and do it with minimal violence.   Part 2 has Luthor insulted by the League rejecting his ideas and decides ""These scumbags. I hate all of them as much as I hate Superman. Let's make my own team to destroy them all."" Push comes to shove and we get Luthor's league of super evil, consisting of Luthor in his armor, the second Cheetah (the first appears in the Wonderwoman film covering why she's an envoy in America at all), Captain Cold, Clayface and whoever else is normally in that team.

As they are slowly dismantled by a combined effort from the league and reign victorious it is revealed that they won just in time to face a new and coming threat...Darkseid.

I mean, he's one of the most powerful beings in the Multiverse (if i remember correctly). He exists outside of every universe, so what reason does he have to attack Earth? Even with Superman, Earth is absolutely no danger to Darkseid at all.   Without a reason that's better than ""let's attack this planet,"" i just can't see how bringing Darkseid in works so soon. I reasoned that a smaller, more close-to-home villain would work better. To show that Earth is a threat to the alien community (beating Brainiac would definitely get to the Guardians of Oa) and beating the League of Doom would show Earth is safe from itself (which would give villains like Vandal Savage and Black Adam the opportunity for some fun)."

I think at the end of Part1 Waller will offer for the JL to work under Argus, and when they refuse she will decide that they are the threat, and that Argus needs to form it's own team of top tier heroes.  I've got my ideas for how they would show that team forming in the background of the other movies, but I'd make the lineup Cyborg, Martian Manhunter, OMAC, Enchantress, and one other female character maybe Star Girl.  At the same time Lex Luthor is reacting to the threat of the Justice League.  He acts more as a behind the scenes guy as he put together his team.  His team would be Metallo, Gorilla Grodd, Giganta, Black Atom, Ocean Master, Deadshot, and one more Batman villain maybe Poison Ivy.  As awesome as this movie would be maybe it's got a bad case of ""too many characters.""  I think it could work with thr right build up, and writing, but a simplified version might be Waller, and Luthor working together to build a more powerful Suicide Squad that can take on the JL.  Also I was curious what you ideas for the Wonder Woman film were?  I've got my own, but they don't involve Cheetah."

The film takes place just before, during, and just after Man of Steel. The film would start with Steve Trevor on a plane, piloted by one Priscilla Rich, going to the Amazon Rainforest in the interest of confirming the existence of a tribe of interest to the USA (Themyscira). Rich serves as a representative of the USA government and Trevor as ex-military backup. They crash.  Naturally, we get the standard treatment for Trevor. Taken in by the Amazonians and nursed back to health, etc etc. But no love interest in Diana yet. Rich is presumed dead and her body goes unfound by the Amazonians. Rich's dying body has in fact been taken by a woman calling herself Granny, and offered the powers of Urtzkartaga (with a brief mention of another taking a similar agreement without Granny there) if she agrees to do a task and join the Furies. The task? To give Granny the Golden Girdle of Gaea. The transformation breaks Rich's mind, and her secondary persona takes priority, and she dubs herself 'Cheetah.'  Blah blah blah. Wonder Woman and Cheetah fight, Trevor risks his life to help Wonder Woman (who he has started to fall for and is completely unrequited (Wonder Woman is a warrior after all)). Cheetah ends up with a sword in her stomach and dead. Wonder Woman and Trevor make a mutual agreement, she would visit him in America sometime and Trevor would make sure the American Government don't intervene with Themyscira and the Amazonians again.  During the fight between Cheetah and WW, a great explosion in the distance happens as the Black Zero fires a beam of destruction into the Earth in Metropolis. This distracts Cheetah briefly, allowing Trevor to intervene and let WW make the killing blow.  Hippolyta allows WW to go to America, serving as an envoy of Themyscira and establishing positive links between America and Themyscira. Hippolyta gives WW her birthright armour, a bronze tiara and the Golden Girdle of Gaea. The film ends as a jet, piloted by Trevor, uncloaks in a field beside the Amazonian River and Diana waves to her family and her people briefly, before approaching the jet.    The Cheetah in my JL part 2 is Barbara Minerva."
DC_Cinematic,31oho5,Justice_Prince,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:53:21 2015 UTC,"It's weird that you're making the Amazons coming from the amazon rainforest.  In the comics it has always just been an island, and it's probably best to keep it that way.  I was actually figuring the movie would take place after BvS.  Do a couple fashbacks to show Diana growing up, and the events of her leaving.  Also an animated monolog from Hippolyta that covers the history of the Amazons, and how Diana was created.  I'd actually make Ares, and Circe the villains for the first film.  Diana is called back to Themyscira when she get's news that Circe has escaped from Amazon jail.  It might need a new name because Restoration Island sounds kinda lame.  When she gets there she finds that the Amazons are under attack.  Eventually she finds out that Circe has manipulated that Amazons into a war so that Ares can feed off the psychic energy of the fighting, and make his way back into the mortal realm.  I actually think it would be cool for the war to be with the Atlantians, but if they can't make that happen then the Bana Mighdall could work instead.  Not going too into the whole plot I've worked out, but at the end Wonder Woman has her big fight with Ares.  When all is won Ares get's locked down in Tartarus, and Circe get's sent back to Amazons prison.  I've actually got big idea for Circe to be in the next two Wonder Woman movies as well."
DC_Cinematic,31oho5,deonist,5,Wed Apr 8 03:28:16 2015 UTC,"I can almost be certain that Black Adam is going to be the villain for Justice League part 2 considering it comes right after Shazam. Dwyane Johnson has already made comments about fighting (or joining) the justice league. Plus it would make sense since he is such an asset marketing wise to any franchise why not make him the leagues biggest foe.  Now the question is who's going to be the villain for part 1. Well, we can all assume Brainiac, or Darkseid or some other colossal villain with the ability to take down the league physically but I think Black Adam should do that for part 2. Instead they should focus on a villain that can take them down mentally and emotionally. Personally I would want the Suicide Squad to be the ones do to this.  At the end of the Suicide Squad or Wonder Woman movie, Amanda Waller and Lex Luthor should come together with a plan to execute the Justice league members. Knowing as they can't match them physically they'll hit them in their hearts. Using their weaknesses and personal lives against them. Or maybe they can hack into Batman's computer and steal the file with all of the league members' weaknesses. Although it's unoriginal it would be a great way to see the league come together when they are at their weakest and truly join forces. Seeing each other's weaknesses and making it their strengths.  TL:DR - Part 1 has the suicide squad use the plot of ""Justice League: Doom"". Part 2 is basically Black Adam vs the Justice League."
DC_Cinematic,31oho5,ManagerMurrayHewitt,3,Tue Apr 7 00:36:22 2015 UTC,"This makes a lot of sense on a realistic, business side.  I like it, too.  Given Johnson's enthusiasm and his box office draw, I think we'll definitely be seeing him in either (or both) of the JL films.  Part me sees Lex being an underlying presence throughout the series.  I see the fallout of BvS leading directly into JL with Lex as a major antagonist at that point.  I really see BvS, JL, and JL2 as an epic saga with ""short stories"" (the other films) supplementing them and their narrative.  Suicide Squad is probably incredibly important in the grand scheme of things, but I can't believe we live in a world where this is now the case."

Blue Beetle too, since his company was an easter egg in Man of Steel. Nightwing is in since Jason is rumored to be dead by BvS, and Oracle is possibly there too.   Cyborg's origin is closely tied with the creation of the Justice League in the New 52. And since Shazam apparently won't appear until his solo film, I think only those two will get origin stories in the current line up. Maybe I'm wrong but we'll see."

As far as the language, I don't imagine they'll be speaking different languages than humans. Otherwise, how will Aquaman communicate with the league?"
DC_Cinematic,31g5b4,thelastbrew,8,Sat Apr 4 20:33:16 2015 UTC,Aquaman grows up on the surface so he would know english and learn Atlantean after he discovers it.  My question was mainly about how they speak rather than what they speak. Will they talk and sound travel through water to each other? Will they transmit electric signals or vibrations that others pick up to communicate?
DC_Cinematic,31g5b4,Jangwin,5,Sat Apr 4 21:36:11 2015 UTC,I'd imagine the Atlanteans' hearing has evolved to better hear sound underwater.

I think that solves underwater communication.  It would be cool to see an Atlantian language too rather then them just conveniently speaking English the whole time.  Another question is should the live in the water the whole time, or should they have air bubbles they live in.  To my knowledge most versions have shown then having air in side their buildings.  I think they should go with that if just because it's more convenient for filming.  I wonder if we'll see Atlantis before the Aquaman solo movie.  I don't see them cramming it into BvS.  Maybe we'd see it in the Justice League film, or in Wonder Woman's solo film."
DC_Cinematic,31g5b4,comingtogetyou,5,Sat Apr 4 21:31:38 2015 UTC,"No, Atlanteans cannot in general talk to sea life. It is a rare trait among the royal line, which is used to confirm Arthur's legacy as heir to the throne (which he inherited from his mother). In fact, in the N52 they expand the royal blood line traits to say that Mera's hydrokinesis is a trait of the royal line of Xebel, as opposed to just ""magic-available-to-anyone-investing-the-time-to-study-it""."
DC_Cinematic,31g5b4,Justice_Prince,3,Sat Apr 4 22:40:06 2015 UTC,Oh that makes sense.  Also explains why Aquaman never learned to use a power so useful.
DC_Cinematic,31g5b4,comingtogetyou,2,Sat Apr 4 23:08:12 2015 UTC,"To answer the other questions:  1) Atlanteans have different factions, and the conservative people (which are many I might add, ranging from the moderate to the extreme) do not like to be in air filled rooms. Some parts are filled with air out of practical reasons, such as the archives, since many documents are recorded on parchment. As you say, it may just be more practical if a lot of the plot is played out in Atlantis, but I think it is more likely that most of the plot is not set in Atlantis.  2) It is very easy to skip Atlantis in BvS and JL for a simple reason: outsiders are not welcome in Atlantis. In the N52, four (non-Atlanteans have ever visited Atlantis so far.  3) As for language, they mostly speak a language similar to Ancient greek in Young Justice. If you ever seen HBO's Vikings, they do a nice trick where people start speaking their real language (old Norwegian, old English, old Swedish etc.) and then switch to English. The only time they switch back is when characters that speak different languages meet."
DC_Cinematic,31g5b4,Justice_Prince,2,Sat Apr 4 23:22:53 2015 UTC,"Well I was thinking if the JL villain ends up being Starro then they could end up featuring some scenes of Atlantis.  If not they could still squeeze in a scene of Aquaman hanging out in Atlantis before he gets a call on his Aquaphone that the other heroes need him.  I'm also speculating that the Wonder Woman could possible be about Ares starting a war between the Amazons, and Atlantians.  If that was the case then there would likely be a scene of Wonder Woman traveling to Atlantis to try and negotiate a peace treaty."
DC_Cinematic,31g5b4,comingtogetyou,1 point,Sat Apr 4 23:38:53 2015 UTC,"Good ideas. I would love Starro as the main villain, but I don't think it is realistic in a ""Snyder-realistic"" movie :(  I can't really see a war movie between Atlantis and the Amazons in a timeline where Arthur and Diana knows each other and work on the Justice League. Also have in mind, if they draw from the N52 universe, that Ares and Diana are not enemies."
DC_Cinematic,31g5b4,Justice_Prince,2,Sun Apr 5 07:28:31 2015 UTC,"Well the Wonder Woman solo movie is coming before Justice League, and we don't know is Diana, and Arthur will meet in DoJ, and if they do it will likely just be briefly.  Also just because the movies are supposedly using the daughter of Zeus origin doesn't mean they'll pass up on a great villain like Ares just because Azzarello screwed that up too."

I wouldn't be against it getting one, but I kinda prefer the idea that rather then having to make everything into a trilogy that they give more chances to smaller franchises.  They did say that there are still unannounced Batman, and Superman solo films so I'm running under the assumption that those are being squeezed into the current lineup.  The way I see it the Superman movie will likely come out in 2020 so that might technically come out after Green Lantern.  I suspect a second Wonder Woman movie will likely be coming in 2021.  Aquaman, and Flash will likely be getting sequels soon after as well.  The Dark Universe movie will finally come out.  I'd like to see a few other franchises get a chance like do a Birds of Prey movie, and a Blue & Gold film.  More team up movies would be interesting as well."
DC_Cinematic,31cmva,Justice_Prince,2,Fri Apr 3 22:37:49 2015 UTC,"2021   Looking at that date it felt like it was going to be soooo far. Like a decade or two from now, when really it's only 6 years. How time flies.."
DC_Cinematic,31cmva,BlackenBlueShit,1 point,Sun Apr 5 14:27:46 2015 UTC,Even since 2010 every year has sounded like the distant future.
DC_Cinematic,31cmva,Justice_Prince,4,Sun Apr 5 14:34:21 2015 UTC,How about a Martian Manhunter film? I know it'll probably be the riskiest film they can produce but I'd love to see that.
DC_Cinematic,31cmva,oliveryoshi,4,Sat Apr 4 02:05:18 2015 UTC,We could all use a little more Plastic Man in our lives.
DC_Cinematic,31cmva,KillerPalm,4,Sat Apr 4 14:44:40 2015 UTC,"I've still got my fingers crossed that: a) Guillermo Del Toro's Justice League: Dark get's greenlit and b) Justice League: Dark is a part of the DCCUniverse. I'd love for Swamp Thing, Constantine and Zatanna to be in the same live action universe as Aquaman, Amanda Waller and Shazam!"
DC_Cinematic,31cmva,Cyprinodon_Martius,3,Sat Apr 4 17:16:58 2015 UTC,Blue Beetle/Booster Gold would make me so so happy. I'd also love a Teen Titns movie. Green Arrow/Black Canary would be cool too.   Realistically though? Probably a sequel to one of the JL movies.
DC_Cinematic,31cmva,IwishIwasGoku,2,Sat Apr 4 05:05:27 2015 UTC,"Birds of Prey, Hawkman/Hawkgirl, Green Arrow"

DC_Cinematic,31cmva,Lyfultruth,1 point,Sun Apr 5 20:38:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this all depends on the movies before it. Based on the number of villains in Suicide Squad, they're already setting up quite a few villains. With villains comes heroes.  I would not be surprised if, by the time the Flash movie comes out, they essentially have a fully established universe of villains and heroes. Including, but not limited to, Question, Cheetah, Luthor, Bizarro, Hawkman and God knows who else.   I really don't know what superhero film should come after Flash. If i were in charge, it'd be Superman 2 as he tries to find Kara Zor El (after he discovers her possible existence from alternate universe Barry in The Flash movie) culminating in the discovery of the Manhunter in an Argus cell."

I love all the characters and normally JL Dark wouldn't be on top, but del Toro is the perfect person for this film and it makes me giddy just thinking what he would do with it.  Other than that the ones that stick out are SS and Aquaman, Aquaman mostly because I'm still trying to rationalize that it's really happening. But SS has so much potential with it, Ayer is a wonderful film maker and Will Smith and Jared Leto are two very very talented actors. Add onto that the rumours of Deathstroke being involved along with the team we've already gotten and I'm salivating at how fucking cool it could be."
DC_Cinematic,319clj,KyleRaynerGotSweg,6,Fri Apr 3 02:57:29 2015 UTC,I can't decide between BvS and SS. Any time I hear even the slightest bit of news or rumor I giggle like a school girl with excitement.

DC_Cinematic,30y792,rebelinthought12345,2,Tue Mar 31 18:22:59 2015 UTC,The one in comic-con is a test footage. Not really a teaser. But putting it in front of MadMax is very reasonable. Mad Max is probably bound to attract longtime fans of the MadMax franchise n some younger audiences.
DC_Cinematic,30y792,MiQBonafide,0,Wed Apr 1 03:16:36 2015 UTC,I am just really hoping for the teaser to come along side Avengers 2. A new Star Wars trailer AND BvS teaser would make that movie premier night ever more fantastic.

Not so much the other movies but whoever he has on the inside at Suicide Squad has been given him real good info. Hopefully this turns out to be true as well.
DC_Cinematic,30vzua,rpratt34,2,Tue Mar 31 14:31:20 2015 UTC,"all his casting rumors have been on point- his plot rumors not so much. he was the one who said the team would comprise of blockbuster, multiplex, vixen and a couple of others, soooo idk. and other plot rumors unverifiable at the time. but i trust his casting rumors now"
DC_Cinematic,30vzua,rebelinthought12345,3,Tue Mar 31 18:25:30 2015 UTC,Eh not all of them. He was the one who claimed Joaquin Pheonix was in the process of signing a deal to become Lex Luthor when we later found out that at the time of that claim Eisenberg had already signed a contract to play the role. Also said Ryan Gosling was the front runner for Batman at one point when he hadn't actually even met with studio executives.
DC_Cinematic,30vzua,rpratt34,2,Tue Mar 31 18:30:27 2015 UTC,Woah what?! But yea he has been nearly on point with every casting rumor attached to the squad. His source for it is definitely on point.

I was originally thinking Nemesis but now I'm leaning toward Steve Trevor with Skwad filming from April to August, Wonder Woman filming from Fall to possibly Spring 2016, and Justice League filming in early 2016 (if he's in it).   Also, he is a great match for Trevor."

DC_Cinematic,30tkpp,invisiblack,5,Mon Mar 30 18:19:44 2015 UTC,They definitely need an expendable character to kill to demonstrate that Waller isn't fucking around. Basically KGBeast's role in Assault on Arkham.

He's finally having a resurgence as an actor this year with Focus, and he is a very talented actor with great range, so I think he'll be able to pull it off.   As for Captain Boomerang, the mere concept of him sounds a little silly, but I will say, the Suicide Squad episodes of Arrow really show his potential. If treated by the right director, he can be pretty badass, and considering the David Ayer wrote and directed Fury and End of Watch and he also wrote The Fast and the Furious and Training Day, so he's a good choice of making characters badass."
DC_Cinematic,30trf6,aircycle,5,Mon Mar 30 17:36:17 2015 UTC,"Woah! hang on... Ayer wrote Training Day/ End of Watch? I knew about Fury, but not those two!

DC_Cinematic,30trf6,KidK0dy,5,Mon Mar 30 18:03:31 2015 UTC,"I hope he does too! My feeling is Boomerang could have been replaced easily with another DC villain.

DC_Cinematic,30r96u,ProjectInsight,16,Mon Mar 30 00:55:58 2015 UTC,"I'll be the first to admit that I am a DC fanboy through and through. I absolutely loved Man of Steel. I'll gush about it any chance I get. But even I can see that it was not a perfect film.   However, the linked article is not saying that Man of Steel was perfect. It is saying that many of the criticisms thrown towards the movie are based on points that have been proven false. Superman didn't save anyone? Untrue. Superman did more damage to Metropolis and Smallville than the Kryptonians? False. Superman could have just covered Zod's laser eyes and put him in jail? Completely Absurd.   Not every criticism of Man of Steel is baseless, but the ones I keep seeing pop up over and over and over again certainly are. It's as if the people bringing them up have never watched the movie."
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,LordCommanderStark,0,Mon Mar 30 04:17:24 2015 UTC,"Considering how much these arguments (such as ""Superman didn't save anyone"") get thrown around, though, there is clearly something going on.  For me, it was stuff that wasn't clear at all. Why didn't Clark save Pa Kent? There may be a logical explanation, sure, but the movie does a shit job of explaining it. Until someone explained, in detail, why he couldn't... it just looked like crap.   It's not just ""These are the facts"". You also have to take into account ""How are the facts presented? How are they emphasized? From what perspective are they shown?"" And that, to me, is where the movie fucks up.   Again, this is just my opinion. I thought the movie was crap until someone showed me a video with more in-depth analysis. NOW I enjoy it more. But it's not positive sign when a movie requires complex fan-made videos just so people understand the film. Especially for a super-hero movie, which needs to be a bit more ""universally"" understandable."
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,Maclimes,6,Mon Mar 30 14:54:55 2015 UTC,"They should have used a younger actor in the tornado scene.  I think they wanted Cavil to sell the emotion of the scene, and were trying to have him playing younger, but the guy just can't pass as a teenager."

Clark wouldn't be fast enough to save him without anyone noticing. Also, he wasn't an adult at that point; he must have been like 16 or something, so I'm assuming the entire situation was difficult for him to process. Also, I absolutely hate it when films feel the need to explain themselves to the audience. I like it when we need to think about it and figure it out instead of them spoon feeding us exposition like we're retarded (i.e., guardians of the galaxy...)"
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,actin_and_myosin,8,Wed Apr 1 15:39:14 2015 UTC,I love how the Save Counter in the second video changes during the world engine destruction scene.
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,Capn_C,7,Mon Mar 30 01:30:19 2015 UTC,People really love to hate this film. It gets attacked more than genuinely bad movies.
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,JeweliusCaesar,6,Mon Mar 30 11:27:20 2015 UTC,"This is what bothers me most, still the audience rated it higher than critics so there's that."
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,invisiblack,5,Mon Mar 30 11:42:36 2015 UTC,The only thing MoS is truly guilty of is not being a Marvel film in my opinion.
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,JeweliusCaesar,0,Mon Mar 30 12:07:48 2015 UTC,It's because it's Superman. It's do or die. The public won't accept a mediocre Superman movie. Same goes for Star Wars Episode 1-3. That trilogy gets shredded every chance it gets.
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,markes13,4,Mon Mar 30 15:54:48 2015 UTC,"This article missed the point of most MoS criticisms. I think it offers surface-level explanations to surface-level problems. For example, the explanation for why Clark couldn't save his dad makes sense. But the timing of the scene doesn't support it. There's that weird, lengthy pause where father and son make eye contact and just stare at each other. And if you wanted to nitpick, you could say that the scene could be reconstructed in such a way to create more tension. Maybe Clark could go after his did, grab his hand, and Pa Kent would get sucked into the hurricane anyway. Now, that's not as realistic a scenario, because then you'd have to find a way to explain why Clark didn't get sucked up), but it's still the kind of nonsensical rebuttal you can offer to keep the conversation about that point going.  The significance of Pa Kent's death is that it teaches Superman that he can't save everyone. It's one of the most important moments in Superman's life. In the comics (and even in Smallville), Pa Kent dies of a heart attack. Superman can't do anything about it. And that message is what's ultimately lost in MoS. It was more spectacle than substance. Which is my biggest criticism of the film as a whole."
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,recesshustlerkid,1 point,Mon Mar 30 16:33:55 2015 UTC,"I think it wouldn't be as big of a deal if MoS was a stand alone film and not the spring for a cinematic universe. It has a lot to do with the TOTAL destruction of bldgs and portions of cities. There is also the thought that the next installment must be bigger than the last and it left a high ceiling in the destruction department. There is just so many areas that leave this movie feeling like ""well damn can't get much worse than 2-3 kryptonians tearing up a planet"". As for other aspects of the film it was kinda weird to see him go from confused about who he is to sudden expert on his people and ambassador to humans. The movie is fine but does leave a lot to be inferred and theorized."
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,Mandalorianfist,0,Tue Mar 31 04:13:50 2015 UTC,"Ive never seen movie like this one where people want to actually force other people to say it was good. Im a Superman fan, the movie was just OK in my opinion. A lot longer than it had to be and plenty of imprefections. The guy was fighting Kryptonians, so I dont have a problem that there was a lot of destruction and he couldnt save everybody. Also it was clear Zod wasnt going to stop unless he was killed so he made a decision for the greater good. I dont even have a problem with that. I didnt like how they killed Pa Kent. He could have easily saved him. That whole scene was stupid. I also didnt like how easily Lois Lane was able to track him down. Heres a reporter that knows nothing about him yet is able to track him to his home before he even becomes Superman, yet the government, who knows he was raised in Kansas, cant figure out anything. Bigtime plot holes. The movie couldve used some tightening up. Heres hoping B vs S is put together better."
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,TripleSkeet,7,Mon Mar 30 04:45:33 2015 UTC,Plot hole means inconsistency that can't be explained. Those aren't plot holes. You don't have to like them but they aren't unexlainable
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,S0ckHeaven,-2,Mon Mar 30 05:48:46 2015 UTC,Really? Id really like them to explain how easily Lois Lane was able to find him yet the military cannot.
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,TripleSkeet,4,Mon Mar 30 06:23:13 2015 UTC,She had starting info the military didn't! She was saved by him in the ship and had a starting point to work back from. Military didn't know any of that. Have you watched the movie recently?
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,S0ckHeaven,0,Mon Mar 30 16:37:11 2015 UTC,Yea I watched it. I hate the fact she found Superman before even meeting Clark Kent. It doesnt matter what her starting point is. The military had a starting point too. He told them he was raised in Kansas. They also have way more technology and resources at their disposal then one reporter. Cmon now.
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,TripleSkeet,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:09:50 2015 UTC,He told Swanwick that he was from Kansas to prove he was just as human/American as everyone else there. The entire conversation was to get Swanwick to convince the military/government to stay off his back. And Swanwick seemed pretty receptive.
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,Colticus,1 point,Wed Apr 1 20:31:49 2015 UTC,"Sorry, your problem with this doesn't make sense to me."
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,S0ckHeaven,-1,Mon Mar 30 18:13:52 2015 UTC,Because youre in love with a mediocre movie. It ok. We all have them.
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,TripleSkeet,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:15:33 2015 UTC,"I'm just gonna pause this argument. I think you are wrong, you think I am wrong, so be it. I prefer to discuss this movie with people who like it, nothing personal. You think him telling them he was raised in Kansas later in the movie gives them an advantage of Louis meeting him early in the movie. Ok, doesn't make sense, bu I respect if you don't like it. No one is forcing you to say it is good."
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,S0ckHeaven,-1,Mon Mar 30 18:26:39 2015 UTC,"I do like the movie actually. I just dont think it was great. It had the potential to be, but fell flat in some places. I never said the government shouldve found him in the beginning. One of the parts I like about the end was him dropping the satellite and telling them they wont be able to find him if he doesnt want him to. Thats perfect. Im just saying it shouldve been the same for Lois. She shouldnt have been able to just find him like that."
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,TripleSkeet,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:34:55 2015 UTC,By tracing back where he had been? ok.
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,S0ckHeaven,2,Mon Mar 30 18:38:59 2015 UTC,"I didnt like how they killed Pa Kent. He could have easily saved him. That whole scene was stupid.    That's not the point at all of the scene, Pa Kent knows that Clark could save him but at the same time its kind of Pa Kent being a man of his word, when he said that maybe Clark should have let the kids on the bus die because there are more important things than any  of their lives"
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,TripleSkeet,1 point,Tue Mar 31 06:51:03 2015 UTC,Yea but he couldve saved him even without his super powers.
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,Luis_Ignacio,-5,Tue Mar 31 17:22:25 2015 UTC,"I wonder how many ""good movies"" need tons of articles and blogs, and even a whole web page (http://www.manofsteelanswers.com/) to defende it from ""baseless"" arguments."
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,invisiblack,10,Mon Mar 30 02:16:43 2015 UTC,"In a world where Man of Steel is rated lower than these abominations I think its alright to have a podcast that explains some of the misconceptions people have.  And http://www.manofsteelanswers.com/ has become more than a podcast on Man of Steel now. Sure, its mostly about Man of Steel, but that's because Man of Steel is the only movie released in a series of movies that will (hopefully) make the DCCU."
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,invisiblack,3,Mon Mar 30 03:24:03 2015 UTC,"And also, these kinds of posts don't help at all, they just fuel the fire."
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,Maclimes,9,Mon Mar 30 03:37:16 2015 UTC,Only the ones subject to an even larger number of articles and blogs written to tear it down.
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,Csantana,0,Mon Mar 30 02:19:47 2015 UTC,"I think the point he's making is that given how divisive opinions are, the criticisms are not ""baseless"". No matter how many numbers you want to put on the screen, the simple fact is that many people did not like Man of Steel. And many of those people are comic book fans, and even Superman fans.  Arguing about it does nothing. It's an opinion. You can write webpages, articles, and videos all you want. It will not change the fact that a lot of comic fans did not like Man of Steel."
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,S0ckHeaven,7,Mon Mar 30 02:51:41 2015 UTC,"When you base an opinion on supposed ""fact"", as most who try to tear the movie down do, and those ""facts"" are addressed in a piece like this, those critiques are therefore rendered baseless.  Which, btw, is the entire point of the piece."
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,Csantana,-3,Mon Mar 30 02:54:16 2015 UTC,"Look I do feel that Man of Steel gets a lot of hate. The hate gets kinda circle jerky too. Even with all of these things considered many people still didnt get what they wanted out of it. Movies arent just good and then brought down when they are missing something. They generally start out neutral and rise when there is good stuff and fall when there is bad stuff. I think for a lot of people the movie didnt have enough ""good stuff.""  also it was kinda dumb that the dad went for the dog and that Clark didn't save them. You can't fight that one."
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,Lyfultruth,5,Mon Mar 30 03:35:05 2015 UTC,"Plenty of reasons and defenses have been made for pa kents death. You don't have to like them, but don't tell us it can't be fought"
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,Csantana,1 point,Mon Mar 30 05:45:18 2015 UTC,ok I guess its kinda dumb to say you cant fight it. Not in a confrontational way but how would you defend the Dad's death ?
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,Csantana,4,Mon Mar 30 13:51:09 2015 UTC,"Clark doesn't save Pa Kent because he was explicitly asked not to save him. To save him would involve showing the world that an alien existed, running the risk of government intervention, and would be a direct refusal to accept Pa's request. This rejection would have shown to Pa that Clark was refusing to listen and putting himself at risk, when Clark was not ready to deal with this.  This is actually one of the few things Man of Steel fully explained in the film."
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,S0ckHeaven,1 point,Mon Mar 30 16:06:27 2015 UTC,"I'm going to disagree with you on the ""fully explained in the film"" thing. It was not long after this that Clark destroys a lumber truck in a way that was obviously supernatural. I thought that was a really dumb way to maintain cover even if the karmic joke was appreciated. In my head its not so much ""why didnt he save his dad"" as why didnt he get the dog in the first place? The dad did not need to die at all or let himself die. I feel like a father giving in to death rather than fighting on was not a good motivation. I understand the characters motivations in the world they created but why create that world. Why make ""and he just chooses to die."" Like I said I like the film a lot I love the music and the visuals are really cool. I think the tragedy of the father dying is an important part of what makes Superman (even though there are versions where they are both alive). I just didnt like the idea that Clark chooses to let his father die to maintain cover. What is the point of maintaining cover? To keep the family together right? so why sacrifice the family to keep cover.   Also I just wanted to talk about why we love the movie. I really liked the Jesus metaphor. While I'm not particularly religious I thought the comparison of a Christ figure was important to establish how he was what humanity was to strive toward. I also loved the allegory that Zod was the Devil and his dad was god because I love allegory. I also thought it was crazy how jacked Cavil got for the part Superman looked like superman.  My favorite part of the film though is the very end where he talks to the general after destroying the drone. Basically saying I am here and you can trust me. I thought the line about being born and raised in Kansas was very boy scout and fit Superman perfectly.  What are some of your favorite parts of the film?"
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,Csantana,1 point,Mon Mar 30 17:27:51 2015 UTC,also sorry my comment is so long.
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,S0ckHeaven,3,Mon Mar 30 17:34:24 2015 UTC,"Simply because Pa Kent did not think Clark was ready and the world was not ready.  Maybe he was wrong, maybe you don't like that, but that is the reason."
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,o88o,1 point,Mon Mar 30 16:41:35 2015 UTC,Its not the characters so much as the choice to make the characters that way because Superman letting someone die was just so weird to me.   any way in order to keep this less negative i feel like we should agree to disagree on this. I would like to hear about other parts of the film you liked though. My favorite part of the film was the end when Superman talks to the general as he felt very boyscout during that seen.
DC_Cinematic,30r96u,invisiblack,1 point,Mon Mar 30 17:33:30 2015 UTC,"It happens to be my favorite comic book movie ever and one of my favorite movies ever period. So I basically like it all, lol.  I did like that scene, especially how he destroyed their satellite!"
DC_Cinematic,30qswi,TronVin,15,Sun Mar 29 22:31:30 2015 UTC,"Empire: I can't let you go without asking about the big blue boyscout. When was the last time you actually wore the suit?

C: I'm not so sure yet, no.  E: No one's given you the call yet? [Laughs.]  C: No one's given me the date yet. They'll tell me last minute, I'm sure.  E: I know you can't say, but just how big of a smack down do you put on batman? Just how badly do you hurt him?  C: Unfortunately, I really can't say anything about that. I wish I could.

DC_Cinematic,30ifyh,aircycle,3,Mon Mar 30 08:00:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Terry McGinnis storyline will come up for a long while. Not many people watched and are aware of Batman Beyond (relative to the hundreds of millions of average people who will watch these films, and to most, Bruce Wayne is always Batman. The only way I see someone replacing Bruce would be after 10 or so years, when the DCCU has the same respect that Marvel Studios has now, and they can bring out any C list character and people will see it.   I personally would like some big event that causes Batman to either leave for a long time or be presumed dead, and then he's out of the films for a few years. Then Dick could be Batman, but I would like Bruce to come back and it be a different actor. I personally would like all the characters be recast one by one when the actors are done with the roles, that way the characters stay the same general age, and you don't limit the stories you can tell. To me, these characters are bigger than the actors and directors that portray them."

DC_Cinematic,30ifyh,ashesinacan,3,Mon Mar 30 17:34:53 2015 UTC,"I would much rather see really old Bruce teach Terry Mcginnis. Kind of the way Batman Beyond ties up the end of the DCAU, this could be used similarly to effectively tie up the DCCU.   But if they're planning on just continuing the current arc with the same characters and have no interest in jumping into the far future, then I suppose they will have to replace him with Dick, right? There would be mass fan displeasure though."

So far it seems the majority of the inspiration for Batman is from The Dark Knight Returns, which in that universe, Dick Grayson does not have a happy ending."

DC_Cinematic,30f1ke,eoinster,7,Mon Apr 6 16:43:20 2015 UTC,"I see that he's hugely passionate about the opportunity, but man is he cocky. He has no doubt that he can knock the role out of the park, and while confidence is great, I've yet to see any real acting or range from him to warrant such talk."
DC_Cinematic,30f1ke,AaronRoots427,8,Thu Mar 26 23:25:12 2015 UTC,"""#5BillionInBoxOfficeRecieptsWorldWide"" That's not because of Tyrese, it's because of the franchise Viagra that is Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Hal Jordan is gonna be the Green Lantern, he's gotta be, at least for Justice League and the first DCCU solo GL film. Zack Snyder is a fan of the old school, and doing things faithful to the source material. He'll start off with Hal, like he should. They can bring John and the others in Later, but my casting pic for John Stewart is Michael Jai White. Everyone says Idris Elba, and he'd be great, but he'd make an even greater Martian Manhunter."
DC_Cinematic,30f1ke,agnosgnosia,5,Thu Mar 26 22:57:23 2015 UTC,"I like the Rock as an actor, but he's far from franchise Viagra that people seem to think. If he was, then Hercules would have made more than the 243 million it made. He went into G.I. Joe, but the first one made about 300 million worldwide, and Retaliation made 375 worldwide. That's hardly enough to call it a 'revitalization' of that franchise.  The reason the Fast and the Furious franchise got to where it is right now is because Justin Lin knows how to make movies that are fun to watch. He's the one who decided to have a car explode out of a plane. He's the one who decided to have a tank chase scene.   Take a look at the Rock's rottentomatoes page if you don't believe me. His filmography as a whole is not significantly more stellar than most other actors. Anyone remember that Doom movie?  Yea...  Justin Lin's next movie is Star Trek 3. We'll see how he does with that. Personally I'm kind of excited to see what he'll do with it."

DC_Cinematic,30f1ke,BatmanDavey1986,3,Mon Mar 30 08:02:40 2015 UTC,Yeah. That hash tag made me dislike him even more. You're in movies with The Rock and giant fighting robots. No one remembers you were even in these films once they are over Tyrese.
DC_Cinematic,30f1ke,IwishIwasGoku,2,Fri Mar 27 13:38:46 2015 UTC,"Idris Elba would be a great MM, but I think Lance Reddick would be an even better MM. It's hard to come up with a more perfect fit for John than Idris..but then again the fans don't have all the knowledge of casting directors.   Also, the first GL solo film doesn't necessarily need to have Hal. I'm  a big fan of the idea of introducing him in the JL movies as 'the' Green Lantern, and then having Kyle be the main Lantern in the GL solo movie. Keeps things fresh and separate from the 2011 film, allows them to have Hal, Guy and John already there and tutoring Kyle, and satiates fans who want Hal as well. I suspect it'd a 'dual-lead' type film that uses Kyle as an exposition sponge."
DC_Cinematic,30f1ke,MrCatEater,1 point,Thu Mar 26 23:43:31 2015 UTC,Somehow I feel like we won't get Martian Manhunter in the DCCU. I remember hearing about some big guy behind the upcoming movie universe really doesn't like him. I would be so mad if we don't get him though.
DC_Cinematic,30f1ke,AaronRoots427,4,Fri Mar 27 01:43:17 2015 UTC,"That was David Goyer, and he's out of the DCCU now. I still think General Swanwick from Man Of Steel is secretly MM."

DC_Cinematic,30f1ke,KyleRaynerGotSweg,5,Thu Mar 26 23:23:29 2015 UTC,"I honestly am so conflicted about him possibly be John, on one hand I want it to be Hal in Justice League and save John and the others for the GL standalone, and Tyrese never struck me as a particularly prolific actor, admittedly I've only seen him in a handful of roles but still there are far more experienced actors out there they could go after.  But at the same time I've never seen anyone so excited about a role, he and Ray Fisher seem like they are through the moon happy with it (though Tyrese still isn't confirmed) and to me that makes it feel like they're going to work hard to do the characters justice, which is really important with these films if you ask me."
DC_Cinematic,30f1ke,wetdreamman,8,Thu Mar 26 21:22:46 2015 UTC,"In the comics, is Hal supposed to be first then john comes later?"
DC_Cinematic,30f1ke,KyleRaynerGotSweg,1 point,Thu Mar 26 21:27:16 2015 UTC,"Yes in the comics that's how it is, John comes after Guy Gardner too but John is usually thought of as the second. It would be relatively easy to change for the film if they wanted, I imagine they wouldn't do that though. If they go with John I bet they would have some part where the other members ask if there are multiple Green Lanterns of Earth and John explains that he is the second, and his predecessor Hal sacrificed himself to save the Corps. I still prefer Hal for sure but if they did something like that I could get behind it, John certainly is awesome in his own right and could work well with the film as we saw in the JL animated series."
DC_Cinematic,30f1ke,decrepidactyl,5,Thu Mar 26 21:56:52 2015 UTC,"Everyone is speculating Hal or John, but i think it would be hilarious if Zack and Co. were like ""Fuck you guys, Kyle Rayner id part of the DCCU now""."
DC_Cinematic,30f1ke,KyleRaynerGotSweg,5,Fri Mar 27 01:37:35 2015 UTC,Based on my username I hope you know I would never object to this.

DC_Cinematic,30f1ke,KyleRaynerGotSweg,1 point,Thu Mar 26 21:57:57 2015 UTC,"I think he could be a decent John, but I can't see him as a leading man in a solo movie and I'd much rather see Hal as the GL in the League. He'd be great in a Green Lantern Corps movie alongside Hal, Guy, and Kyle."
DC_Cinematic,30f1ke,KidK0dy,2,Fri Mar 27 05:04:47 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, frankly regardless of who gets cast as who the GL solo movie should have all of them in it, Hal, John, Guy and Kyle are all spectacular characters and not using all of them would be wasting so much potential. Hal is just so central to the history of the corps in the comics it would just feel wrong to me to gloss over it with flashbacks or just some quick dialogue. Not to mention I want to see that Hal/Barry bromance on screen and the banter between Hal and Batman, it just feels a lot more right I guess by having Hal there instead of John. They could simply have Hal mention that another human was brought into the corps and is training on Oa during the events of the JL films, then have a couple years between the JL films and the GL standalone and have had them recruit the other two into the corps and we start from there."
DC_Cinematic,30f1ke,alwaysupvoteTRUNKS,2,Fri Mar 27 06:00:17 2015 UTC,"He was also in 4 brothers which I thoroughly enjoyed. But to me his passion is incredible, and since I grew up with John in the animated series for me it would be great. Although admittedly I do like Hal better. But I certainly wouldn't be upset with this."

DC_Cinematic,30f01w,Justice_Prince,6,Thu Mar 26 20:55:12 2015 UTC,"I think the title of the movie indicates who's after who here. Its Batman V. Superman, Bats is after Supes here."

DC_Cinematic,30f01w,Techno_Bacon,5,Fri Mar 27 04:42:30 2015 UTC,"The only way I can see this happening is if Lex spearheads the campaign shaming Superman for what happened to Metropolis and basically manipulates him into being his minion to 'earn humanity's trust' or something like that. I don't want things to go that way though. It'll basically turn Superman into an antagonist of sorts. It should be Batman entering Superman's world, Batman being the paranoid one and Batman (along with Luthor) being the one who decides Superman needs to be monitored, if not defeated entirely. With Metropolis needing to be rebuilt, Wayne industries has a perfect excuse to be there. Perhaps he'll use the opportunity to investigate Luthor as well, because if anyone can smell a false act to get the public on your side it's Bats.   So yeah not buying it."

DC_Cinematic,30dszm,rebelinthought12345,8,Thu Mar 26 15:51:56 2015 UTC,"I definitely think either Deathstroke or Batman are in it. I don't think both will be, but one of those is almost a guarantee IMO, and they'll be playing the sort of role Batman played in Assault on Arkham. I hope it's Bats. I would love to see him from the perspective of the criminals. It'd make us, the audience, fear him for the first time the way the criminals do."
DC_Cinematic,30dszm,IwishIwasGoku,6,Thu Mar 26 19:09:51 2015 UTC,"This is 100% what I want as well. The Batman is always portrayed as the hero, obviously, because he is the star of his own films. Through Suicide Squad he could be presented as the merciless, mysterious, skull-crushing shadow in the night."
DC_Cinematic,30dszm,thelastbrew,4,Thu Mar 26 20:05:58 2015 UTC,"I would LOVE to see bats in the movie, even if it's a teeny tiny minor role. I doubt he'll have anything major, since the focus really isn't on him here. Deathstroke would be awesome as a primary antagonist, and since this is a villains film, i wouldn't be surprised seeing him with a huge role."
