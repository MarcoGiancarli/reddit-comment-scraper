Chihuahua,3d9x5n,llaaadyel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:19:10 2015 UTC,I just had my guy neutered it's a minimally invasive procedure. He was more mad that he had to wear a cone than about the surgery. The antibiotics did make it so his food took longer to digest. But he was back to normal quickly.
Chihuahua,3d9x5n,wjpreis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:05:04 2015 UTC,"My chi Maxx had a UTI or something similar but that only happened because one of his testicles hadnt descended.  Otherwise,  smooth sailing. He didnt lick at it so he didn't need a cone."
Chihuahua,3d9x5n,waaallen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:26:32 2015 UTC,"Vet tech here who assists in neuter surgeries every day:  Neuters are pretty much the most minimally invasive common surgery there is in veterinary medicine.   The risk of the aesthetic is much higher than the procedure or healing itself.  If this is something you're worried about, consult with your veterinarian about pre surgical bloodwork. This can grant you some peace of mind that your little guy's will tolerate the anesthetic well.   Keep them nice and quiet after surgery, and they should be just fine!   Pm me with any questions!"

Chihuahua,3d8kxa,LauraJ94,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:14:25 2015 UTC,"Is he nuetered?  I have a male chi and he peed in EVERYTHING till we had him altered.  All was well after that. He also uses a pad.  You are doing well with the positive reinforcement,  treats work well. Ricky will come get me after he uses the pad to get his treat.  He is now 12."
Chihuahua,3d8kxa,BlondeBody,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:35:34 2015 UTC,He isnt snipped yet because were unsure weather or not to breed him with a friends short haired Chi. Its frustrating because he will do a few on the pad then ruin the streak. Ive read everywhere not to shout or punish him but if we leave it he does it more if we shout and send him to his bed he does it less
Chihuahua,3d8kxa,SpikeNLB,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:56:04 2015 UTC,"I rescued mine at 9 mths and he was not pad trained.  I'm told when they are a puppy, it's all about confinement.  Keep in a small area which is they pad and their bed.  They won't pee in their bed, and thus will only use the pad, then slowly expand their area and they should recognize the pad as the right place to go.    Given we were past the confinement stage, and all he would do is shred the pad (hey thanks human for leaving that on the floor, that was fun!), I got a couple of faux turf remnants and plastic size carpet runner . . . runner first, then pad then turf, and he picked up pretty quick that the 'grass' was where he goes.  Just rinse and spay with clorox/water weekly.  Just walk him once in the afternoon.  BTW, my understanding is that unless you catch them peeing and punish at that moment, it's pointless, they don't understand the connection, and def not the snout in the pee, that just confuses them.  Good luck!"

Tent camping on the gravel shoreline of the Columbia River, when a BOOM of thunder rolled us off the camp-bed onto the floor!  3-4am + the rain was hammering on the tent roof, while the wind was shrieking + trying to pull the stakes out of the rocks!  One end already flapping …    We were soaked to the skin by the time we bundled everything into our SUV, wind howling + rocking the car!  Didn't even TRY to pack; just crammed it in + headed for home (2hrs away).   Our poor little dogs were shaking + scared to death!  Me too ~~~ I hadn't wanted to go fishing anyway!

Chihuahua,3d5djo,jasojohns,3,Mon Jul 13 20:52:32 2015 UTC,The trailer is a 2012 Livin' Lite QuickSilver 5.7. Their 2015 model is here on their website:  http://www.livinlite.com/6.0-overview.php  It weighs ~800lbs fully loaded with all our gear. Light enough that we tow it behind a 2004 VW New Beetle Convertible.   Very nice trailer the only drawback being its a bit of a pain to pack up in the rain. Setup/teardown takes about 10 minutes though once you're good at it.   We paid $3000 for this trailer as a used model. I don't want to turn this into a classified ad really but we're actually looking to sell it soon if you're anywhere near the Cincinnati area. ;)
Chihuahua,3d5djo,pupEluvR,2,Mon Jul 13 21:39:10 2015 UTC,"How clever!   What a compact, efficient way to camp!  Bet it's easy to pull, with very little wind-drag; ie. Easy on the fuel.   A great alternative to tent camping, and not nearly as bulky as the regular Camper / motor home types.  My Sis + Hubby had a regular tent trailer for several years, and enjoyed it.  But this is much more compact!"

Chihuahua,3d4ah6,LauraJ94,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:14:00 2015 UTC,"Our oldest (Mister Fusspot) isn't a fan of car rides either, unless he can get down in the floor board. He gets carsick if he looks out the windows, so we put a blanket down on the passenger side floor board and he naps with his head on my wife's foot.   His sister prefers to be in my wife's lap. I don't think she's ever really bothered to look out the windows, she just sits there quietly until we get to where ever we're going.   Our youngest (Mister Vimes) prefers to be in my lap, with his paws on the driver's side windowsill and wagging his tail so fast that I keep expecting it to leave a bruise where it whacks into my chest. However, that's really unsafe so my wife keeps him corralled in her lap, or we put all of them in their carriers if they get too rowdy."

Chihuahua,3d4ah6,pupEluvR,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:26:03 2015 UTC,"♦Understood! Carriers are the safest, but the pet-seats are good if they like to look out.  They have snaps + straps to attach to his/ her harness, so they're secure + don't get tossed around.  Even a pillow on the floor (with an extra pillow case they can crawl into) makes a snuggly little cave.   My Tiny-es crawl under my big loose sweatshirt + snuggle, so it acts like a Safety Harness.  Then they pop out to see when we stop!"

Chihuahua,3cx6rw,ellivibrutp,3,Sat Jul 11 15:54:38 2015 UTC,"The only thing I can think is that maybe you are calculating the amount of food wrong? Or maybe he needs a different kind of food (leaner, grain free) although it shouldn't make that much of a difference. Our chi is also on a very specific diet to maintain her weight, and we weigh it with a kitchen scale to the gram. Also, make sure you're counting any treats and snacks in your calorie count. Most treats have too many calories for ours, so we only give her small bites of veggies or kibble (which we then deduct from her meals).  Would he be interested in anything like agility for extra exercise? You might be able to find a class indoor if it's too hot outside."
Chihuahua,3cx6rw,JuniperFoxtrot,2,Sat Jul 11 19:15:36 2015 UTC,"I am not sure how I could be that off in calorie counting.  I measured a cup and then count the number of individual kibbles in a cup to calculate calories per kibble, then i count out the appropriate number of kibbles for each meal.   I will redo my calculation using grams and a kitchen scale, since weight should be a more accurate measure than volume.  The only other food he gets is a single sliver of cheese with his allergy pill (like a tiny sliver smaller than a pea when mashed up with the pill, certainly less than 5 calories).   We never leave our other dog's food out (we supervise its eating) and have nothing our bigger dog could get into. He only goes outside on walks with me and rarely find food on the ground.   I guess the only missing link would be if my wife feeding him, quite deceitfully, when I am not home. Of course, I strongly doubt that, but I guess it isn't impossible.   For now, my plan is to double check my measurements and track exercise.  I don't think asking my wife if she is cheating on my dog's diet would go over well, especially since she probably isn't."
Chihuahua,3cx6rw,JuniperFoxtrot,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:43:48 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a good plan! It might be good to just check in and make sure you are both on the same page - that way it doesn't come off as you accusing her of anything. My husband and I check in pretty regularly to make sure our plan is still working, make sure neither of us are over-treating her, and decide if we need to make any changes to keep her healthy.  Also, you've probably already checked this (or he was weighed at the vet) but is the scale you are using to weigh him accurate?  How does he look according to a weight guideline chart?  Also, what kind of medication is he on? Anything that could cause weight gain or make it harder to lose weight?"
Chihuahua,3cx6rw,queentampons,3,Sat Jul 11 22:10:45 2015 UTC,"I agree that it seems that the dog is somehow getting too much food or extra treats somewhere. Exercise is wonderful and healthy, but calorie restriction is key for weight loss. I had a 6.5 lb chi mix before who we fed 1/3 cup of Taste of the Wild (125 kcal) once daily. No treats except occasional popcorn. Is everyone in the house on board with the diet plan? Are there neighbors or kids who could be feeding him? Could he be getting into the trash or eating poop?"
Chihuahua,3cx6rw,Tatertotfreek,2,Sat Jul 11 20:22:50 2015 UTC,When my Rescue needed to lose weight we slowly gave her less and less food (as directed by vet) and when she hit her goal weight we kept feeding her that amount. This process took 2 years.

Chihuahua,3cw0zc,pupEluvR,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:25:22 2015 UTC,I told my mom about him this morning and she thought it might be a good idea to write down if this happens again since the vet might not be able to do anything if he seems okay again now. I'm going to call the vet and see what they say just in case because he seems okay again now. My mom seems to think he was just extremely exhausted. We spent yesterday and the day before moving me out of my apartment and back home (graduated college). He's really tired today and has been sleeping a lot so I think he might be just super tired.   Will keep you updated!
Chihuahua,3cw0zc,pupEluvR,2,Sat Jul 11 19:33:40 2015 UTC,"So glad he's doing okay ♥   I think your Mom's idea is good~~  keep a record of date, time, symptoms, how long they lasted, etc.  Hopefully, it WON'T happen again, but you'll have info for the Vet if necessary.  And yes, see if Vet has any idea what caused it."
Chihuahua,3cw0zc,pupEluvR,2,Sun Jul 12 07:13:52 2015 UTC,"Just a thought ~~~ if he's a Tiny one, they CAN go hypoglycemic if they're too active + don't eat.  (You said you were really busy with the move?)  That can make them wobbly + disoriented.   Also, is it hot there? Heat / dehydration can as well.  We've had temperatures 100° most of the past two weeks + they need lots of water to stay hydrated.  Plus Pedialyte is recommended for dogs (especially little ones) to help replace electrolytes when they're hot.  (Google)"

Sometimes you never know what caused it.  ASK your Vet!  But basically, do as you've already done :   Watch him closely, have a safe comfy place, (cool/ shady), lots of water + make sure he has a snack if needed.  He'll probably be anxious, so reassure him, + keep him calm (+ happy♥)   Sure hope he's ALL BETTER now! <3<3"

Chihuahua,3cu10b,Shantastic123,2,Fri Jul 10 19:42:46 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately it didn't help enough to have a major discernable difference for ours. Don't get me wrong, their temperament definitely changed - more passive, one out of our two just walked in circles until he tired himself out and the other would just go lay down. Yet we bought the Thundershirts for stranger, other-dog, and car-ride anxiety and it just didn't seem to help well enough for any of those. Plus they cover their entire underside so it made outside trips difficult.  But those are only my neurotic little fuzzballs who get PO'D at trash bags and leaves, your chi might have a different experience. I think since it sounds like you already purchased them, what harm could they do? If anything, your chi might behave differently simply bc of how strange the experience of the vest is. That's what it seemed like for our guys at least. I might actually try them out again now that I've written this."
Chihuahua,3cu10b,TheViceCampaign,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:41:08 2015 UTC,Thanks!  That was pretty much my thought process - it's not going to create any problems and it will keep her a little warm maybe on the flight.  :)

It's super easy to set up and you can adjust how high up on the seat it goes. It's very sturdy and can hold a dog up to 60 lbs. Our girl has been much happier in the car ever since we got it.

Chihuahua,3clhfv,nivekevil,2,Thu Jul 9 03:20:00 2015 UTC,"That's awesome she doesn't mind the sling. I wish there was a device to keep my girl propped safely on my shoulder so that I could use both my hands. It's hard to get anything done when she's perched there, shaking uncontrollably. She won't let me sit, so it's like having an inconsolable infant you have to walk around with until it falls asleep (or in Scout's case--stops shaking and panting). Thunderstorms are actually one of the only times she prefers me to my mom. I think because I'm taller she feels safer higher up."
Chihuahua,3clhfv,alanbowman,2,Thu Jul 9 05:03:32 2015 UTC,"Although this sounds like a commercial, if you can find one small enough check out Thundershirts. Although not a user myself (dogs too old to care about your petty thunder), they apparently work quite well."
Chihuahua,3clhfv,throwawayourtele,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:16:23 2015 UTC,I've heard good things about the Thundershirt but have never purchased it because she goes ballistic anytime we try to put clothing on her. Now I'm thinking it's probably worth a shot anyway. I can always return it.
Chihuahua,3clhfv,dior_show,2,Thu Jul 9 13:23:44 2015 UTC,"Our vets say that if you can't or don't want to get a Thundershirt, then any tight-fitting shirt will do. It's the tightness that calms them, not anything specific to the Thundershirt itself.   Our little girl Esme has started to get fearful of thunderstorms, so we've been putting a shirt that's just a bit too small on her when a storm comes over. I won't say that she's completely calmed down, but she has been less jumpy and hasn't stress-panted as much."

We alternate between tablets and liquid, and it seems to work quite well.   Again, use at your own risk, etc etc. But I know this really helps our dogs for minor allergic reactions."

Chihuahua,3c4w4n,WindsRequiem,2,Sat Jul 4 20:53:38 2015 UTC,Chis are generally really shaky. But if she's not acting like she normally does that's a sign that she could be sick. Maybe wait a day or two and watch her closely and if she shows any signs of getting worse/not improving take her to another vet for a second opinion. I hope everything goes well and she feels better soon. :)
Chihuahua,3c4w4n,WindsRequiem,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:53:41 2015 UTC,"I hope so too man :( She is still as playful and caring as ever, but she is like, looking for fresh places with shadow, she goes into corners to sit down instead of laying down.

Chihuahua,3c4w4n,pupEluvR,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:18:06 2015 UTC,"Colic is tummy problems which could explain why she only sits/doesnt want to jump. What you could also do is Google the problem and see if there's small changes you can make to help her out, or simple remedies :)"
Chihuahua,3c4w4n,froggiefroggie,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:38:26 2015 UTC,"Did you google COLIC to check symptoms + suggested remedies?  Be sure to keep her hydrated. --- plenty of fresh water + maybe some Pedialyte  (for Babies) to replace trace elements/ vitamins?  My Vet has reccomendded this before.   ie: Pedialyte for Dogs. (Google)  Many people offer their dehydrated dogs unflavored Pedialyte,which is a child's electrolyte drink. Even if your dog is drinking water,it sometimes isn't enough,and Pedialyte will help replace electrolytes they may have lost from vomiting. Oct 2,"

My little one is almost 14 and has never played in sand before. I would love to see her try something like this, but she's not necessarily a fan of new things so I'm not sure she'd ""dig it""."
Chihuahua,3boizz,bagelsandkegels,5,Tue Jun 30 22:18:33 2015 UTC,"We made it for her out some wood we had laying around.  The thing that works really well is one of those hard shell baby pools that cost around $8.  She has always loved the beach so much, and we had gotten some buckets of sand for a project.  I dumped the extra sand out to rake it into the garden, and she started digging in it, so we decided to make her her own sandbox. It's great exercise for her too.  She likes us to hide her toys in it.  It's about 4' x 4' and 12-14"" deep."

Courage can come in small packages ♥  [–] nolabrew 8 points 4 months ago  ♦We have a 4 lb chihuahua and a 50 lb mutt. All in all I'd say the chihuahua is really good dog. He barks at anyone who comes in the house, no matter how well he knows them until they pet him, so that's kind of annoying.   He's not to be fucked with though.  A friend brought her dog over, which was a huge boxer, and the boxer and my mutt were playing in the yard.  The boxer over powered my mutt and had him on the ground and my mutt yelped.   The chihuahua, who had been watching from a strategic location, darted over to the 2 dogs and bit the boxer's nuts.  The boxer immediately released my mutt and to this day, thinks nothing of rough housing with the mutt, but won't come near the chihuahua!  ♦Chihuahuas are loyal to no end.    [ Smart Chi!

Chihuahua,3bnzv4,charlestonchewz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:17:53 2015 UTC,"We adopted Scooby, a 6 YO neutered male Chi, from a family member who couldn't keep him due to separation issues. We are around the house more, and have our own home, so whining wasn't an issue for us. He seems to be much better with the separation, but he's still fear aggressive. He's bitten pretty much everyone in the house at some point or another, and we've worked with him on clicker training to redirect him when someone comes to the door. He's now great with our family, and we love him 98% of the time. But when someone comes to the door, he's uncontrollable. Yesterday, he bit the friend of my 11 YO daughter. He's bitten other guests before, and we've considered trying to re-home him. We've talked with the vet, and discussed behavioral training. But there don't seem to be any in our area, and the vet has told my wife that he's only going to get worse as he ages.  We'd like to find a home with one or two people. He's been OK with some dogs, and we have a cat. But he's also gone after a few dogs that he's met.  We're in Syracuse, NY. I would want to meet you and give Scooby a chance to meet your pets before making any decisions."

That being said, hes grown to like me and my boyfriend now after scaring us, hes super stupid nice when he wants to be but he can flip to devil chi in a second. Either take time to gently socialize him and put him in time out if he needs it. Good luck either way :)"

And he barks and shows aggression towards other dogs.  When we have visitors come in I go on me my knees to come down to his level and make him stay in one spot till he's calmed down. This usually helps and he will approach the visitor, sniff them, instead of incessantly bark at them."

I put him on the floor in the back and adjust the passenger seat so it just touches the carrier, securing it in place.  Since his carrier has a mesh top and side, I can send warm or cool air back to him under the seat from the floor vents depending on the weather. It's pretty secure, and the way my seats are shaped, the set up would likely hold him in place even in a roll over."

Chihuahua,3a2ton,MissMari,3,Tue Jun 16 20:02:33 2015 UTC,"Hi! Chihuahuas can be stubborn but are smarter than they get credit for. Since you adopted two you need to know that you should train them separately. Whether you train at home or go to a class, you need to teach them the lessons independently from each other. As you reinforce the lessons through the day it's fine to ask them both to participate, but when you're getting the basics down you need to focus on one at a time or else you're setting them up to fail.   The dry skin could be from a couple of things but it's probably NOT lack of bathing. Bathing strips skin and fur of oils, dogs who are over bathed tend to have dry skin. Diet is more likely the culprit for their shedding and poor hydration.   Salmon oil, fresh water and good quality food should show you some improvement. If after a few months of their new routine you find that it's still a real problem then definitely consult a vet about any possible dermatological problems.   I rarely bathe my dogs because they aren't dirty (unless they've rolled in something gross, or got muddy feet) and they don't have dry skin.   Get a furminator, brush them out like crazy, give them a good bath, and then see how they fare."
Chihuahua,3a2ton,bathori,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:04:01 2015 UTC,"I second the furminator recommendation. Chihuahuas are notorious shedders. We have found that brushing and furminating helps, but everything in our house is covered in a fine layer of chihuahua hair. We vacuum often and use a sticky roller for our clothes. You get used to it!  We bathe ours about every two weeks because she has allergies and the special shampoo and conditioner we use helps her itchiness."
Chihuahua,3a2ton,JuniperFoxtrot,0,Wed Jun 17 06:53:43 2015 UTC,"I think I'll have to fork out the money for a furminantor. Lol they''ve got a lot of white and our floors are dark. You can see it everywhere! One of the pups had a 'hot spot' at the base of his tail. They've been treating it with a spray and I'm continuing. They smelled awful so yesterday I bathed them and the spot looks so much better. My question is how often should I bathe?  Monthly?  Bi monthly? My other dog is about monthly, I just don't want to dry out the chis skin."
Chihuahua,3a2ton,bathori,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:31:37 2015 UTC,"Unless there's a medical reason like JuniperFoxtrot's dog, or if your dogs are dirty, you don't need to bathe them."
Chihuahua,3a2ton,JuniperFoxtrot,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:30:03 2015 UTC,"If the hot spot doesn't go away, and your dog keeps going at it, you might talk to your vet and try a different food to see if they could be having an allergic reaction. Ours came to us eating chicken and turkey based food, and was an itchy, licky mess. Now she's on a duck-based food with no grains or fillers and she doesn't lick herself constantly anymore. Still a bit itchy from seasonal allergies but it's manageable.  A high quality, grain-free diet could also help with dry skin.  We use Virbac Epi-Soothe shampoo and cream rinse. It helps the itchiness without drying out her skin. It also makes her coat really soft and shiny!"

Is the dog on a leash on the ground?  Are you holding the dog?  Are you nervous when you see another human or dog approaching because you are afraid of his reaction?
Chihuahua,393azo,llaaadyel,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:44:24 2015 UTC,"They are on leashes/harnesses, the fabric kind and not the retractable kind. Sometimes I admit am nervous or try and avoid people which I know isn't helping. Sometimes I try to pretend it's not a big deal - if they're not walking and are just passively sitting or (less often) standing he's ok.  But if it's another dog it doesn't matter how calm I am, they go bananas. I think it's partially excitement on Gus's part, but I'm pretty sure Gifford is just terrified."
Chihuahua,393azo,lphchld,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:07:27 2015 UTC,"I hope you get an answer, although this sub is mostly pictures of cute pups. I'm sure there's an expert somewhere in here. You might also want to check out /r/dogs just in case.   :)"
Chihuahua,393azo,kiwicupcake,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:55:03 2015 UTC,"Not a chi, but my husband's lab mix was terrified of everyone, but would approach and sniff someone once they were sitting on the couch- which was about at the level of her head.  I think being on her level made a big difference and letting her initiate contact versus the other way around. After about a year she is much, much better."
Chihuahua,393azo,JuniperFoxtrot,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:24:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, I noticed if we happen across people sitting on their porch or something Gifford just ""BOFFS"" a few times in his throat but doesn't go full-on ballistic. It's mostly when people are standing/walking toward us that he freaks."
Chihuahua,393azo,llaaadyel,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:08:10 2015 UTC,"Look into BAT (behavior adjustment training). It helps you teach your dog that there is alternative to lashing out at other dogs and scary people, and you use a clicker and lots of treats. When you get to Seattle, look into BAT sessions at Ahimsa dog training. We went there with our reactive chi and it has helped immensely. She still can't be near other dogs, but she can see them across the street on walks now and knows that if she looks at another dog, then looks away, we click and we get to walk away from the dog and she gets a treat. BAT takes a LOT of practice so don't get discouraged if it seems hard at first."

Chihuahua,38xfzr,rudeandnotginger10,3,Sun Jun 7 17:49:25 2015 UTC,"I have two Chis, and I regret nothing. They are amazing dogs. Take them out and socialize them. Don't carry them around like babies when you do take them out. They can walk. They love snuggling up in warm blankets and sunbathing. Don't get them rawhide, as it's not safe. They need teeth cleanings every year or so or their teeth will get pretty nasty. The more socialization, the better! They're so lovable though, and get very attached to their person."

Chihuahua,38xfzr,Tatertotfreek,3,Wed Jun 10 01:44:36 2015 UTC,"Proud chihuahua mom here. Family has had chihuahuas since I was a young kid. First off: chihuahuas live a long time- we've had 2 make it to a full 20 years. So be ready for a long commitment. I've had both long hair and short hair chihuahuas and I personally prefer the long hair ones because they don't seem to shed as much. Their diet is really important- no table scraps, be sure they have a high fat diet year 1 then switch to lower fat from there. Things I wish I knew- socializing them is super important. Don't skip on the chihuahua meeting other dogs (big and small), children and adults. Otherwise they will be scared when they are older. Chihuahuas are really possession driven and very protective. So make sure you train them ASAP and be assertive."
Chihuahua,38xfzr,rx4polish,5,Sun Jun 7 19:35:42 2015 UTC,"Hi, I have a chi that owns me!  They like to burrow under a blanket, so be careful when u sit.  I try to walk ricky every day, a couple of miles.   They tremble when nervous or cold.  Socialize your chi with other dogs, humans, cats, whatever.  This keeps them from being an asshole.    Mine weighs 8 pounds.  Do not baby your chi.  It is a dog, not a doll.    Do not give table scraps.    Get some good toys and bones to chew on.    And always remember, YOU are the alpha dog.  Hope this helps!"
Chihuahua,38xfzr,BlondeBody,3,Sun Jun 7 18:25:48 2015 UTC,"Can confirm the importance of socialization. We rescued an asshole. He's fine with us, and a few select dogs he met when they were puppies (and was able to dominate). But otherwise it's a complete shit-show when someone comes to the house. It's a real love/hate relationship."

Chihuahua,38xfzr,tortugapervertida,2,Thu Jun 11 10:59:15 2015 UTC,"All of them are different while being similar. If you get one the best advice I can give you is to let it be a dog. Let it walk on the leash, let it meet others and potty train it quickly!  They are wonderful dogs for the most part although some are bossy as hell.   I'd suggest a good obedience class for socialization and to train YOU so you'll be a better owner!  Other than that they are courageous protective, great little pals."
Chihuahua,38xfzr,AliceA,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:33:44 2015 UTC,"I have a 12 year old short hair chi. She is an alpha female and is the smartest dog I've ever owned. She still has all her teeth. Was diagnosed with a heart murmur recently.  My dog was socialized properly as a puppy, which is very important. She needs company, our female boxer passed away suddenly about six months ago, and our chi shows signs of depression,  and clinginess. We are thinking about getting a Boston terrier puppy to fI'll the void. Chi used to boss the Boxer around and play the king of the couch/bed with her, so she should handle a baby BT fine. I believe that Chiis need a second dog in the house, so they wouldn't be alone when owners are working.   It is easy to overfeed small dogs, it may be a good idea to purchase a small dog scale and chart weight progress. If the adult fit chi weighed 10lbs, for example, and 13lbs a year later, the dog has become obese. Owners are the last to notice."
Chihuahua,38xfzr,cosmo_polite,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:03:36 2015 UTC,"There are two types of chis - the barrel bodied one and the deer type. I have both and really prefer the deer type. They are tan colored and when they curl up they look like Bambi. They are sweeter and easier to train, less clingy. Some chis have a cough that is really their throat closing which is a breed problem. I socialize but larger animals have hurt my chis resulting in vet visits. Just a big paw swipe can send them flying. My male chi had an absentee owner which is not healthy for a chi. I would get two chis so if you work long hours they can comfort each other."

Example :  She wasn't a Chihuahua.   But my husband's brand new puppy (a little terrier mix) ran into the middle of the BlackBerry brambles that completely covered the vacant lot next door.  She sat there, crying pitiously.  After almost half an hour trying without success to coax her out, we decided she must be stuck, her fur tangled on one of the brambles.    Reluctantly + with many ""ouchs!"", I was finally a few inches from her.  She sat there crying, the whole 10 minutes it took me to get to her.    THEN ~~~ She whirled and ran out of the brambles!  Leaving me with all kinds of scratches and thorns in my clothes!  And another 10 minutes to get out of the mess!    She was NOT my favorite dog at that moment!  Tho of course my husband cooed,  ""Isn't she a smart Doggie!""   RIGHT!"

Chihuahua,38ux4f,IV4NTH3GR34T,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:11:00 2015 UTC,"Some Chi's just don't like other dogs, especially ones bigger than they are. We have a Pap-Chi who was a breeder and is very protective and territorial. We've had several big dog fosters including a pit and it's always tense at first with him, but the big dogs always take it in stride. They usually want nothing to do with him once they accept the pecking order.  Just monitor their interaction and be ready to step in verbally or physically. A squirt bottle with a little cinnamon oil helps diffuse the situation pretty quickly for us.  How long has it been? It usually took a week or so for everyone to get used to the changes. Taking our guy to dog parks has really helped him get used to other dogs in a positive way.  Also, if you decide to not keep the Pit, please make sure he goes to a good home that can meet his needs. They like to play a lot and need that interaction."
Chihuahua,38ux4f,ProjectSnowman,1 point,Sun Jun 7 05:51:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you for replying man. My Chihuahua is exactly how you described yours. Yesterday was the first day, and the Pit isn't really interested with another one of our dogs which is a Maltese. And the maltese tolerates the Pit.   However, the Chihuahua is a different story and really the main concern here due to it's behavior. We're worried that the Pitbull may snap and attack the chihuahua, even though the Pitbull was referred to as a house dog by it's previous owner. She's very calm but still a bit anxious due to the change of scenery.   And we already have someone that we can take the pitbull to if things can't work out."

I cried my eyes out that first day, and the weeks afterward every dog I saw would bring tears to my eyes.

Chihuahua,37euum,leftcoastsarah,3,Wed May 27 04:00:46 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. Losing a friend and companion is rough, canine or human. It is a loss that you will always carry in your heart. But as time goes on the loss won't change but your perspective will, the feeling of being without is gradually replaced by all the feelings of having loved.   I'm so sorry for your loss, my thoughts are with you and yours. She was beautiful."
Chihuahua,37euum,froggiefroggie,2,Wed May 27 06:00:51 2015 UTC,So sorry for your loss. I lost my little chi six weeks ago. They give you such unconditional love and there is definitely a hole in your heart when they leave.

Heart broken, I took it to the vet, thinking he would have to be put down.  Vet said,  ""Don't give up!""   Three months later, after unsuccessful surgeries, the leg was amputated.  And my boy lived to be 14!  His indomitable spirit + happy Love of Life were a humbling lesson.  He was a joy!     My biggest surprise was that the other dogs did NOT pick on him and paid no attention to his difference.!  Children can be mean and make life miserable for one who is different;  And adults can be worse.  But dogs don't care ~~~~ they love each other anyway!!   ♥I'm so happy this little Pup has a friend who loves him♥"

Chihuahua,379w6m,J_Andrew89,1 point,Tue May 26 01:34:46 2015 UTC,"Mine does this when he's playing he will growl, bark, snarl then playful bite (gentle, never hard) and lick me. This will repeat the whole time he's jumping around and playing. He's never done this while sleeping or being moved, however when we wake him up sometimes he will get scared and he will start barking until he figures out what's going on. The being scared part only really started when his eye sight started to go. I'm sorry I wasn't much help :/"
Chihuahua,379w6m,GamerWife10,2,Wed May 27 11:42:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for answering! Maybe he's scared, then? It's very bizarre."
Chihuahua,379w6m,moe1984,1 point,Wed May 27 15:10:15 2015 UTC,"my chihuahua does this exact thing. at first, i was worried he was going to actually bite me, so i tried not to bother him while he's comfortable, but i quickly learned that he wouldn't actually bite me, it was all for show. now i just firmly tell him 'no' and keep doing whatever i wanted to do, like move him out of my spot in bed when it's time to go to sleep, and the behavior has gotten a lot better. my guess is he's just being a princess and doesn't anyone to move him while he's comfortable. i'd bet your chihuahua is doing the same. hope that helps!"
Chihuahua,379w6m,moe1984,1 point,Wed May 27 19:47:30 2015 UTC,"He totally bites us though haha. Not hard, but still. Maybe we should be a little more assertive. Thanks for your advice!"

Lol We leave our storm door propped open so the girls can come and go as they please (our front yard is fenced in) and Frankie is that mouthy neighbor thats always yelling at the kids to get off her lawn, lol! The other one (Daisy) bolts the minute she sees anything living. She's deathly afraid of everything and everyone.. We took her out to some garage sales over the weekend and she was not happy about it. :P"
Chihuahua,375c7z,Mmsmi240,2,Mon May 25 03:34:03 2015 UTC,"Aww too cute.  We are trying to find a chi brother for Scarlett, but it's so hard to find chihuahua mixes at a pound / shelter in our area.  We drove to a pound 4.5 hours away to get her."
Chihuahua,375c7z,drewbage1847,3,Mon May 25 03:55:54 2015 UTC,"Oh, wow!! That's quite a drive! They're worth it though. :) Daisy my fiance purchased for his ex, but he kept her when they separated. I think I only traveled about 2 hours to get Frankie. She was about 14 weeks and the people that purchased her were facing eviction if they didn't rehome her. They had about 7 dogs total and I think they went down to 2 or 3. :( I found her on a FB resale page. She has been posted for 2 minutes when I commented and said I would head that way to get her. She's my baby! Have you tried that route instead? I know a lot of people use that route instead of taking their pet to a shelter so they can screen their pets future home and so they don't have to see them bounced around until a permanent home is found. :)"

Chihuahua,373ow3,JuniperFoxtrot,3,Sun May 24 19:14:38 2015 UTC,Can you see her super tiny nails in the picture?  They look like grains of rice!
Chihuahua,373ow3,JuniperFoxtrot,2,Sun May 24 20:22:50 2015 UTC,So little! Don't you wish their nails would stay so tiny? Would sure make clipping them easier! You are lucky she has white nails. Mine has black ones.
Chihuahua,373ow3,JuniperFoxtrot,2,Mon May 25 03:11:53 2015 UTC,"Oh my goodness...I can't even imagine clipping dark toenails!  Clipping her nails is already a 2 to 3 person (holder, clipper, distractor) ordeal as it is...can't imagine having to add X-ray vision to the mix ;)."
Chihuahua,373ow3,soyunamariposa,2,Mon May 25 04:51:27 2015 UTC,"It's a 2 person job for us, definitely. Luckily we've found a routine that works - we just trim a teeny tiny part off a few nails every night until we get them to a good length. We do it right after brushing teeth, which she likes (lucky for us), so that distracts her a bit. She does have one white dew claw which is kind of cute, but not very helpful! :)"

Chihuahua,3745w7,entertheduck,6,Sun May 24 18:36:54 2015 UTC,"I usually don't touch my phone while driving, but I just had to document his first ride home. Every time I snapped a pic, I slowed down on the Interstate and took a quick one, hence why these pics are blurry and shaky.  I haven't had a Chihuahua in two years, had one with my ex and upon breaking up she took her. I finally decided I was ready to care for another, so I searched and found 5 1/2 year old Mochi."
Chihuahua,3745w7,catisms,4,Sun May 24 18:39:25 2015 UTC,"Mochi is so cute! I always appreciate men who are loving towards little dogs. My ex really didn't like them (hence the ""ex"", haha) But, my uncle only has Chihuahuas because they are so sweet and loyal. And as a bonus, he gets a lot of attention from women when out and about with his Chi. I don't understand the hate.  Charlie (my Chi) loves, LOVES car rides. Every time we stop at a drive thru, he gets free food. Sometimes he gets ""dog-napped"" where they take him in through the window to show the other employees. I only let him on my lap when traveling on slower roads though as they can become flying projectiles in an accident. Be careful with your Mochi!"
Chihuahua,3745w7,JuniperFoxtrot,1 point,Sun May 24 20:51:13 2015 UTC,Thanks! I love Chis but I hope he doesn't get dognapped!
Chihuahua,3745w7,SpikeNLB,2,Sun May 24 22:37:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you for adopting! Mochi looks very sweet. You should get him a little doggie car seat though, to keep him safe - riding on laps can be dangerous. It is very sweet that he decided to ride on your lap on his first car ride though - he looks like he's going to be a cuddle bug!"

I think it's in the dog's nature to want to hide/bury a treat. My chi takes her treats and runs to the furthest same-level corner of my house and eats it in a very protective manner. But she doesn't dally...she eats it asap.

I'd go to as many local ones as you are able  3) can skip 2, and go straight to vet,  but is definitely a good idea to do 2."
Chihuahua,36u303,lild1425,1 point,Fri May 22 03:19:47 2015 UTC,Keep her warm and take her to a vet tomorrow. She needs to eat a few times a day. Inspect her for fleas and ear mites. She needs to be bathed in warm water with gentle dog shampoo. No harsh chemicals or flea collars should be put on a puppy.

Chihuahua,36u303,pupEluvR,1 point,Sun May 24 08:58:40 2015 UTC,"This can brief you on some of the Basics:     Keep her safe + warm + dry.  Soft blankets she can cuddle in, and a soft toy to snuggle (she'll miss Mom + siblings.) A 'tick-tock' clock (not digital) in a soft sock to imitate Mom's heartbeat can soothe her + maybe help Sleep. A quiet corner/ room with a bed or open crate. (No drafts.)   Feed often!  >And fresh water.  Puppies need frequent feedings + especially small Chi's can go hypoglycemic if their blood sugar  gets too low. At three -four weeks, they SHOULD still be with Mom + littermates,  But they usually will be able to eat soft foods by then. Just feed every 3-4 hours if possible, light meals/ snacks.

Chihuahua,366n19,tacosalpastor,1 point,Sat May 16 17:48:13 2015 UTC,Dog aspirin. I use it in small doses with my pooch. Coat in peanut butter to get her to take it. Just time will heal. How bad is it?
Chihuahua,366n19,sleepsoncouches,2,Sat May 16 18:20:00 2015 UTC,"Not too bad. It's not even swollen. He jumped up a step and let out a yelp, but he doesn't want to walk on it. I felt his whole let to see if there was a particular spot that he would react to if I touched it, but nothing. He just picks up his leg and refuses to walk. I also checked for a problem with his toes, but he is fine."
Chihuahua,366n19,sleepsoncouches,1 point,Sat May 16 18:51:58 2015 UTC,It's probably a basic sprain then. Can you get your hands on any canine aspirin?

Actually I like this as I live in an apartment complex. But it has left me stunned. I never met a dog like her. This is the only video I got a reaction from her: https://youtu.be/MBVmnJ7b1rE Has anyone an idea what is going on in that video? And is someone willing to test it on their dog? Pixie will cry a little and soon go over in to a full blown howl/call.

It's all practice practice so she'll get a lot of what's going on but like I say don't be harsh on anything she doesn't focus on.   I once had cause to care for a litter of six puppies and they all learned to come up to me and sit to get petted well before 8 weeks of age. It was so cute!"

Chihuahua,357twh,tiramisucheese,2,Thu May 7 20:48:08 2015 UTC,Cute! I wish my chi had all pink toenails so I could keep them so nicely trimmed. :(
Chihuahua,357twh,daydreams356,1 point,Fri May 8 01:48:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know how people do it with the dark toenails!  For her very first trimming ever, I took her to a groomer.  I don't think the groomer had ever worked with nails so small, and she cut her to the quick a bunch of times...  So after that, I just committed to learning how to do it myself.  The dewclaws are still a struggle though.  But all of that would be irrelevant if she had dark nails!  How do the groomers do it?!"
Chihuahua,357twh,pupEluvR,2,Fri May 8 04:05:25 2015 UTC,"The scissor-style are commonly used, but they're bulkier + more awkward to use on Tiny dogs.  I've tried using cheap-made tools, but it's frustrating… so I usually take mine along to the Shelter or a Friend's.       http://www.calvetsupply.com/product/Nail_Trimmer_Regular/Pet_Nail_Trimmers?gclid=CJC338PFtMUCFcqVfgodE1sAnA   Nail Trimmer - Regular      When I Googled, These look similar + are only $10.   Mine are professional quality ; My Groomer ordered them for me.   I don't remember the cost, but they've lasted + have had a lot of use!    Good tools make a difference!!!"
Chihuahua,357twh,daydreams356,1 point,Sat May 9 13:01:46 2015 UTC,Mine has half pink and half black so I guess where her quick is based on the pink ones. Her nails are always still longer than I like though because I'm scared of hurting her. The dewclaws suck! They are so curved that I can't get the clipper to them without hurting her.
Chihuahua,357twh,pupEluvR,1 point,Fri May 8 06:03:55 2015 UTC,Experience helps!  And plenty of practice~~~   But good tools make it a lot easier:   My favorites for Tinies are a pair of chrome Keyhole clippers ~~ NOT the scissor -style ~~ and surgical steel Toenail clippers (for humans).  Got them at the Beauty Supply.
Chihuahua,357twh,pupEluvR,1 point,Sat May 9 12:58:57 2015 UTC,"Especially for dewclaws, the toenail clippers enable you to gently slip the ""mouth"" over the nail without a big hassle. And you can get a better angle.  Plus they're smaller + not so threatening!  On Melody's Tiny feet, you could probably do ALL her nails with just the Toenail clippers!   The Keyhole clippers (guillotine style) are a good high-quality pair I've had for years + they fit my hand comfortably so I can apply a quick, clean cut.  Just slip the nail in the Keyhole + angle it tipped away from the foot.  On dark nails, I always clip a little farther so I DON'T get the quick!  And keep a Guy's styptic pencil ( shaving ) handy if you do nip + get blood."

Chihuahua,34xgt6,Almyre,4,Tue May 5 11:10:24 2015 UTC,One of my chi's does it! It's adorable.   If you pet him when he's sleeping he lightly growls and grumbles. But he usually rolls over and wants me to rub his belly after. I love it :D
Chihuahua,34xgt6,AhnTime,3,Tue May 5 14:16:13 2015 UTC,"YES!!! Rala is such a grumblebutt when she's snoozing. To the extent that one of her many nicknames is Apple Grumble (apple crumble is a popular dessert in the UK).   She sometimes snaps if she's in a deep sleep but it turns into licks immediately. We're training her out of the snapping. SO and I have a theory that when she snaps she is only half awake and hasn't realised that she isn't being attacked.   Most of the time she just grumbles and then repositions herself for maximum snoozy time comfort.   Her best friend (my friend's chi, Snow) also does this.   It's like when our alarms go off and we hit the snooze button. Except humans don't have a snooze button. And dogs don't understand why we would wake them unless it's an emergency."

Chihuahua,34gg2m,wthnot,7,Thu Apr 30 23:01:09 2015 UTC,"hey, chi-mom here. definitely see if these guys are micro-chipped. Vets can do this for you. Chihuahuas enjoy a gentle warm bath with shampoo with as little fragrance as possible. As for food and snacks, a little cooked chicken will do in a pinch!"
Chihuahua,34gg2m,yaykittyyay,3,Thu Apr 30 23:31:47 2015 UTC,Thank you for your reply. How much food should I feed them? And do you know what is wrong with the light-colored ears?
Chihuahua,34gg2m,wolfpack_1,3,Thu Apr 30 23:52:59 2015 UTC,"Hi! Another chi-mom, give them half a cup, then wait and watch if they get sick. Water is probably more important. The ears look maybe fly-bitten, which can happen when they are outdoors alot and not well taken care of. Good on ya for picking them up! Have them checked for microchips, they may have a chi-mama of their own desperately seeking her smalldogs. ;)"
Chihuahua,34gg2m,Joevual,3,Fri May 1 02:49:16 2015 UTC,"I think they've been on the road long enough because it seems like they don't have any intention of entering my house. Either way, I can't really have them inside before I bathe them.  Yes, I'll be sending them off to local vet after I bathe them. Thank you."
Chihuahua,34gg2m,cosmo_polite,3,Fri May 1 08:19:47 2015 UTC,Looks like they may have gotten nipped a few times. Just a guess though.
Chihuahua,34gg2m,cosmo_polite,6,Fri May 1 07:16:34 2015 UTC,"Bathe them in barely warm water, use regular shampoo, or purchase dog shampoo from the store. I use Hartz Soothing oatmeal from Walmart for my chi. One dog at a time, close bathroom door, put towels on the floor. Place a dog into an empty tab, make sure water is warm, not hot and not cold. Use shower head. Soak coat with water. Squirt a small amount of shampoo onto the back and start massaging the dog with fingertips, distributing shampoo everywhere except dogs face, forehead, ears. This is a lot like washing your own scalp, dogs enjoy the massage if done well :) If dog is filthy, pre-wash with shampoo and rinse, and then shampoo in debth. You will feel any ticks if massaged carefully. Watch for fleas to start coming down with rinse water, they are like small dark oval dots. Rinse the dog thoroughly, no left over soap after finished. Get it out of bath tub, set down on towel, towel dry with a second towel. Let it shake water off after towel drying, cover yourself up.  To clean dog's ears, use Ear Cleanser from the store, and cotton balls. If never done this, leave ears alone.   For food, a 10lbs dog needs roughly 1.25 cups of dry dogs food per day, a 15lbs dog needs around 1.75 cups, could be more or less depending on the food. Do not overfeed them, it is very easy with small dogs.  Make sure there is a large bowl of water accessible at all times, a baking casserole dish works well for that, it is heavy enough to not be overturned."
Chihuahua,34gg2m,cosmo_polite,4,Fri May 1 03:56:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I'll be giving them a bath first thing tomorrow, beside feeding them, and off they go to the local vet to check for chips and ears problem. Again, thanks a lot for the useful information."
Chihuahua,34gg2m,Joevual,2,Fri May 1 08:14:11 2015 UTC,"Vet will cost you money though, you may consider calling a local shelter and see if the owner can be located first. I went to see a vet with my chi recently, and the Routine Physical Exam+Office Visit alone were $60, and all blood-urine-fecal work was on top of that, plus vaccinations are not cheap, rabies is required. Learn what is required in your state and ask the vet's office about the cost for two chiis. If you can't locate owners and are serious about keeping dogs, be prepared for a large initial spending for vet bills and dog supplies, and a monthly cost afterwards, for food and medication, if required."
Chihuahua,34gg2m,cosmo_polite,1 point,Fri May 1 08:41:38 2015 UTC,How are your chiis doing?
Chihuahua,34gg2m,cosmo_polite,2,Sun May 3 18:17:35 2015 UTC,"I would recommend using something besides Hartz. It might be fine for some dogs, but other dogs can have a severe allergic reaction."
Chihuahua,34gg2m,awolfpaw,2,Fri May 1 07:17:21 2015 UTC,"I can't find anything negative about Hartz Soothing oatmeal on internet. Some negative stuff is coming up about Hartz UltraGuard Rid Flea & Tick Shampoo, and all links are around 2009... I've used Hartz Oatmeal for all my dogs over the years and my husband used it on himself when he run out of shampoo... everyone is ok..."
Chihuahua,34gg2m,alexaxrossiya,1 point,Fri May 1 07:38:59 2015 UTC,"On another hand, hubby is losing his hair, so maybe that shampoo wasn't harmless after all :)"
Chihuahua,34gg2m,Mmsmi240,4,Fri May 1 07:40:11 2015 UTC,"To echo what others said, call the local shelter. They may be able to help you put out a lost & found or check if they are chipped. But dont just call one shelter: call a few! We had a chi show up at my office and the shelter he was turned over to was not so great. However I called other shelters in the area and some were better/more helpful/had more insight.  You may also put something on craigslist. I really wanted to find the little guys home, so I also went to Craigslist a posted something in the pets section and the lost & found section.  No one ever showed up looking for him, so now he is happy in our home :) If this happens to you (where you want to take the dogs in), call around to local vets. Our vet did a simple check up for free because they thought it was so cool that we adopted a lost dog. It was a very simple exam, but if someone in your area had the same service you could at least ask your questions and get a general sense if there are any major issues to address. Youll find that many vets offices really care for animals and WANT to help you...and will answer your questions without any charge. :) Good luck!"
Chihuahua,34gg2m,pupEluvR,5,Fri May 1 12:40:04 2015 UTC,"I've never had pets before so I'm clueless on any conditions they may have. The other one, I'm guessing is the mother, has a collar but no tag.  What should I do? Take them to the vet? How should I transport them if I were to take them to the vet without cleaning them first? What kind of shampoo do I use if I want to give them a bath or just use water? I'm very new to this so please be patience. Thank you.   *edit patience not patient"
Chihuahua,34gg2m,SpikeNLB,6,Thu Apr 30 23:08:11 2015 UTC,"Any shampoo is fine in a pinch, you can use yours. They may be fine in your backseat, if they are somewhat calm & the vet can determine if they are chipped."
Chihuahua,34gg2m,pixie_pie,4,Thu Apr 30 23:47:30 2015 UTC,I would call your local shelter to give them a description and your contact info. That way if the owners call there they know where to send them. Go to the vet and have them scan for a chip. :)
Chihuahua,34cktp,spmat78,8,Thu Apr 30 01:46:15 2015 UTC,"Southern NJ, checked with local vet offices, no one has reported him missing.  Looks like he's been out living off the land for the past couple days, no wounds, just a bit skinny.  Gave him a bath and some dinner.  No fleas or other bugs, looks like a young little guy, kinda scrawny, about five pounds.  Has a very nice temperament, no tags, but had a really ratty looking harness on.  I left my name and number with a couple local vet offices, and set up an appointment to get him checked out and some dewormer this friday.  I already have one male chi in the house.  For now he's in a crate snuggling under some blankets.  Obviously, I'd like to find his owner if he has one... how should I proceed?"
Chihuahua,34cktp,Surfsidecutie,2,Thu Apr 30 01:50:41 2015 UTC,"Did they scan him to see if he's chipped? You might want to also post on your local board, Facebook, Craigslist, etc"
Chihuahua,34cktp,industrial_hygienus,8,Thu Apr 30 17:21:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks all, I introduced him to my other chi, they're getting along fine.  The new guy isn't neutered, so I'm trying to avoid him marking everywhere in the house.  He's a sweet boy, have an appointment friday at the vets to get him checked out and see if he has a chip to try and find the owner.  If no one claims him, he'll have a new home with us."

Once in a blue moon she'll let the two of us cozy up to her in her bed (to which I hear complaining about a bad night's sleep from her the next day).   Where does Rala sleep after being kicked out of your bed? Molly would flip shit as she's been an I'm-sleeping-with-a-human-tonight dog since before I met her (over a decade ago).

Chihuahua,341qog,Fire_in_her_Hair,3,Mon Apr 27 16:56:18 2015 UTC,"My husband and I got a rescue chi a little over a month ago with the same problem, though we don't know where his phobia originated. We tried a soft crate, but he basically ate it, and clawed at it until it fell apart. For that reason alone I would try a metal one, and just leave it open all the time. We put his favorite blanket in there, and we only feed him in there (with the door open). He now goes into the crate on his own, and doesn't seem horrified by it, but we haven't really tried closing the door yet."
Chihuahua,341qog,RaquelRockatansky,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:55:03 2015 UTC,This what I'm hoping for. A slow process where he ends up loving his crate.
Chihuahua,341qog,pupEluvR,3,Mon Apr 27 21:59:52 2015 UTC,"Two things that often work with puppies:         A tick-tock clock (not digital) in a soft sock to imitate Mom's heartbeat.   And background noise. I leave the radio on (or TV ) 24/7 just for ""white noise"".  TV cooking channels are soothing, because of the voices explaining, and the 'Happy Noises'  when the recipes work!      I don't think they're as quick to bark at every small noise.   And have you tried a small nite-lite, if you think the dark bothers him?  Feeding in his crate sounds like a good idea, + toys that he CAN chew might also help calm + distract him.   Sounds like you're doing things right!  RESCUES can be very wonderful companions + so loving, once he learns to trust.  Good luck!  ♥"
