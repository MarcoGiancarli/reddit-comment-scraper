Mavericks,3e42oy,csquared34,19,Wed Jul 22 00:28:14 2015 UTC,Not trying to repost stuff I just didn't want anyone to be misinformed about RJ. He did right by the Mavs. I wish him well in Cleveland.
Mavericks,3e42oy,RustCohlesLoneStar,5,Tue Jul 21 20:15:23 2015 UTC,"Same here. He's the butt of a lot of jokes, but seems like a good-hearted guy. Hopefully he doesn't kick any starting point guards heads' over there in Cleveland (just kidding)."
Mavericks,3e42oy,TweetPoster,15,Wed Jul 22 00:29:58 2015 UTC,Definitely no problem with this. Means Justin Anderson will undoubtedly be getting more PT.

Mavericks,3e42oy,quitehopeless,5,Tue Jul 21 21:06:11 2015 UTC,We're too far over the cap to acquire a player back in a sign and trade.

Mavericks,3e42oy,Dog22222,3,Wed Jul 22 00:14:26 2015 UTC,No way. Cleveland is probably just paying RJ the minimum. They don't need us to get the deal done
Mavericks,3e4ckr,Player6505,12,Tue Jul 21 21:24:04 2015 UTC,The Jenkins signing makes so much sense now

Mavericks,3e4e86,JoseJuanBarea,3,Tue Jul 21 21:38:48 2015 UTC,I hope everyone knows that Simba can catch lobs too.
Mavericks,3e4e86,jhunlemon,2,Tue Jul 21 23:10:26 2015 UTC,This article's title is really contradictory.
Mavericks,3e4ger,chairamaswamy,3,Tue Jul 21 21:51:18 2015 UTC,"Hm, well the contrast between him and LeBron makes it a little harder to answer, but he's definitely a serviceable bench/roleplayer in the league at this point. I'll give you my breakdown of him:   He's an excellent catch and shoot guy from the perimeter-- he  shot 42.6% from outside last season.  Defensively, he does his best to make up for what he lacks physically (due to his age) with his high basketball IQ-- he has good footwork and employs good angles against guys trying to penetrate, but sometimes he just gets plain beaten if he's trying to guard someone young or athletic. Although his FT shooting could be better, he's not bad at putting it on the deck and driving to the rim (s/o Harper). He's pretty good at getting in there and drawing the foul in late shot clock situations when there's no other choice (he had a FTr of 35.2% last season, which is pretty darn good). One of the most underrated facets of his game is his rebounding-- he's pretty damn good on the defensive boards considering his size and all. Good at body placement. One con I'd have to point out is that his ball-handling is abysmal at times, and every now and then he'll turn it over at an ungodly rate. Still, he does a good job at knowing his role on the team.   Overall, considering contract and his extensive mileage, he's not too shabby. Definitely a solid addition to any team for the vet minimum (given about 15-20 MPG). Also provides a veteran locker room presence, the dude has been around forever."
Mavericks,3e4ger,csquared34,3,Wed Jul 22 02:23:19 2015 UTC,Good enough to do this

Mavericks,3e4ger,Gadsden1776,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:48:06 2015 UTC,He shot 42% from three and his defense is average. He will be a solid veteran back-up for the Cavs. He'll also be a good locker room presence for the younger guys.
Mavericks,3e4ger,aman561,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:17:15 2015 UTC,Yes he is a good backup still. He still has a good offensive game even going to the hole occasionally.
Mavericks,3e4ger,robak69,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:00:08 2015 UTC,He kneed Rondo in the face.  That's a stat nobody else has.  You will love RJ
Mavericks,3e3dac,DeeBrownsPumps,4,Tue Jul 21 17:21:57 2015 UTC,It won't happen. I would love to see him crack 30k.

Mavericks,3e0d1s,Player6505,4,Tue Jul 21 01:30:55 2015 UTC,We needed a young guard locked in to a long contract.  He helps us as an asset contract and a as a possible future piece.  The guy shoots 40%  from 3.

Mavericks,3e0d1s,MokTheRock,4,Tue Jul 21 03:47:22 2015 UTC,"Hawks fan chiming in here. I was honestly hoping we'd keep him around. The number crunch didn't work out, but this guy can score. He needs work on defense as he gets lost quite a bit, but he can be a good player in the right system.  At worst this is a guy that the defense just can't leave. If you give him room he's going to knock it down. Mid range or three, it doesn't really matter. Not terrible at putting it on the floor either. That part needs a little work, but he's capable."
Mavericks,3e0d1s,nujabes02,6,Tue Jul 21 12:23:25 2015 UTC,Some of yall need to chill. Let things play out. Felton is probably on his way out to make room for a big man. Jenkins is young and talented and was underutilized in Atlanta. Anderson will still get plenty of chances to play. All is good.

Mavericks,3e0d1s,dirk-41,3,Tue Jul 21 00:00:08 2015 UTC,"He'll probably back up the 3 for Parsons...I hope. Or start at SG while Matthews recovers. It's never a bad idea to have some shooters. Also, I saw some film on famous, he seems pretty damn talented. Not a standout player, but a hustler who can jump and finish. Something more than we've had every year that Tyson Chandler hasn't suited up."
Mavericks,3e0d1s,wildthrowawayguy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:31:44 2015 UTC,Wes Matt in interviews has said with certainty that he plans to be back for the opener.   Don't know how much of that is wishful thinking or whether or not the training staff/doctors agree but if he does that would be incredible

Mavericks,3e0d1s,Pyundai,2,Tue Jul 21 10:25:55 2015 UTC,Agreed but considering the way we got fucked over its difficult to fault the FO for these signings

Mavericks,3dyfve,Mrjon2009,9,Mon Jul 20 16:22:28 2015 UTC,I think everyone in Dallas is on board with having him around for a long time. Also the only good thing to come out of the rondo trade
Mavericks,3dyfve,Mrjon2009,7,Mon Jul 20 16:35:22 2015 UTC,"Oh right, Rondo... But seriously I didn't know he came with that trade.. Good deal then if he turns out amazing. Is he a PF?"
Mavericks,3dyfve,JoseJuanBarea,6,Mon Jul 20 18:07:01 2015 UTC,Carlisle plays him at both Center and PF. He got most of his minutes last season backing up Tyson before Amare' came over
Mavericks,3dyfve,Mrjon2009,4,Mon Jul 20 18:40:36 2015 UTC,"Since I didn't keep up withy the Mavs, I didn't know he got minutes.. Pretty cool, will be fun I'm sure for yall to see how he pans out.. And what about Anderson? Who is he behind in rotation of he even gets to play?"
Mavericks,3dyfve,JoseJuanBarea,5,Mon Jul 20 18:45:49 2015 UTC,"It depends on whether Rick plays him at SG or SF. If SG, he'll be behind Wes Matthews and Devin Harris. If SF, he'll behind Chandler Parsons and Richard Jefferson because Rick likes vets. And it's noteable that he did play SF during the Summer League. He's just going to fill Jae Crowder's old spot in the rotation"

Mavericks,3dyfve,myLeftTesticleofFury,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:13:02 2015 UTC,This game where he got his season high Rick played him strictly at the center position. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVULuD-11ls
Mavericks,3dyfve,JoseJuanBarea,2,Mon Jul 20 19:21:15 2015 UTC,Scoring was:   curling to the outside for a long 2 trailing the break like dirk for a drive to the bucket from the top of the key pick and pop long two received a drive n dish from jefferson on the block rebound and foul shots   3 out of 5 are more stretch 4-ish offensive sets.  He can guard the 5 which could be huge against big and physical teams like Memphis where they struggled last season.

Mavericks,3dyfve,JoseJuanBarea,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:52:07 2015 UTC,"My point is that ""playing the 5"" really just means you're the tallest person on the court, and you protect the rim.  Having a season high while doing that barely, if at all, speaks to his prowess at center vs. power forward."

Mavericks,3dzm4o,Chad3000,6,Mon Jul 20 20:37:25 2015 UTC,"I thought this was a pretty interesting read. I don't feel like retyping it so I'll just copypasta my comment from facebook:    Even our 2011 title run roster wasn't fantastic by most standards (people seem to forget we lost our second leading scorer behind Dirk indefinitely on January 1st of that season)-- but we still managed to out the LaMarcus/Roy Blazers, sweep the 2 time reigning champs, and cream a young OKC team with KD, Russ, Ibaka, and Harden; all on our way to beating the Heat's big 3.   This should speak volumes about Dirk's place among the best to ever play in the NBA. Don't forget we nearly won it all in 2006 with Josh Howard arguably being our second best player (Dampier lol?). And although the following season we were upset in a big way in the first round, we still won 67 games with essentially the same roster. Dirk is one of the greatest to ever step foot on an NBA court."
Mavericks,3dzm4o,csquared34,3,Mon Jul 20 22:48:46 2015 UTC,"Speaks volumes about how bad Cuban and the front office whiffed on free agency and the draft since the title. The Mavs continued after big fish and never thought about finding pieces to build towards putting a solid core together.  I remember riding home from school with a friend in his truck. He wanted some gas $. Me and another friend gave him 5 bucks to get gas (gas was under $1 then, yes I'm over 30) during lunchtime. When we got out of school we hopped in the truck to go home, we ran out of gas 3/4 of the way home. Come to find out he used that $5 to get tacos. We pushed the truck to our neighborhood.  Feels like the Mavs did the same with Dirk's pay cut. Cuban got a lot of tacos instead getting the fuel needed to get back into true contention."

Harris and Barea are long time mav fan favorites and wily vet PGs. Pachulia is the hard-working european big man who performed decently in the playoffs for the bucks last year. Evans - former utah fan favorite and dunk contest champ. Felton - red-headed stepchild trade-bait PG with off the court problems in new york before coming to dallas.  couldn't get any minutes last year, but performed decently when given the opportunity. Powell is a stretch 4/5 youngun who seems to have tons of upside.  Dominated D-league last year and summer league this year. Anderson is the 21st pick in this year's historically deep draft.  Played at Virginia.  Physical beast and a good 3 point stroke.  High hopes.   edit: how could I forget anderson"
Mavericks,3dzh2w,myLeftTesticleofFury,4,Mon Jul 20 20:26:23 2015 UTC,Cheers man that's exactly what I needed! I have been a little confused as to the reception for Williams - some people were saying he was really good and others that he was a bit shit
Mavericks,3dzh2w,Lifrit,5,Mon Jul 20 20:29:00 2015 UTC,"There's also Justin Anderson, the rookie drafted 21th over-all, who most people are excited about.  Plays D, shots from the corners, and dunks in transitions."
Mavericks,3dzh2w,nmdarkie,2,Mon Jul 20 20:42:17 2015 UTC,"it's a bit of both with D-Will. He used to be arguably the best PG in the league, but in Brooklyn, he was injured and didn't play so hot. His play wasn't worth the $20+M he was getting paid. That said, we signed him for like $5.5M and at that price point, he's way better than any of the other PGs we could have acquired. Lots of people think his struggles were mostly mental, so playing with friends and family here in Dallas could help him regain some of what he lost."

Mavericks,3dzh2w,ArmoniaSAS,9,Mon Jul 20 20:38:57 2015 UTC,"So JJ Barea, Tyson Chandler, Peja Stojakovic, Jason Kidd ended up leaving after a year or immediately after we won the chip. JJ Barea/Tyson rejoined us last year after disappointing the teams they left to. We kinda goofed and let Tyson go again this year because we thought we were going to sign a guy named DeAndre Jordan, who turned out to be a huge douche and went back on his word to sign with us, which is fine now as we're in introspection. Basically the only guys that we have from that team from 4 seasons ago is JJ Barea/Dirk Nowitzki. Devin Harris is back on the team- he was on the 06' team that went to the finals, so he knows Dirk well too. We ended up ditching, they kinda ditched us too,Terry/Kidd some time after the chip. Kidd is now a coach for the bucks and Terry is probably going to sign with the Houston Rockets (what a traitor- am i right?) Well, we ended up going after Dwight Howard, CP3, Deron Williams, and DeAndre Jordan in free agency 2-3 years ago. Obviously none of them came. Deron Williams underperformed in his 2nd year as a Net. They just waived him and he joined* the Mavericks, his hometown team. The dude was an all-star 5 years ago and was considered to be the best pg in the league (even better than cp3) to most analysts. He kinda dropped off the deep end in the new market. Marion retired this offseason. He left to the cavs with LeBron (weird am I right?) after he underperformed in the playoffs with us the year before. We ended up signing with Chandler Parsons. He's really cool and gets along with our guys really well. You can watch his play-style here He's really good and could probably be an all-star in my opinion if he was in the east. Last year we kinda got fuked in the arse by a Rajon Rondo trade. We definitely won the trade in theory, but Rajon turned out not to mesh well with us- offensively. Ellis spent a couple years here too. He was really good, but he could not play defense if the game depended on it. So, coming in to the 2015-16 season you should expect Chandler Parsons to have a huge role and really impress you since ellis/rajon were ball dominant and stole the ball from him a lot. He's not afraid of taking a bigger role, which is really cool. He can play as a PG or an undersized PF. Very versatile player.  We had a historically good offense last year before the Rondo trade. Our starting 5 was J.Nelson/Ellis/Parsons/Dirk/Tyson. Basically we had no 3-point shooting guards and we ran our offense through the p&r with a lot of lobs to Tyson/His Athletic backup. This year our offense is a lot  more like the one from 2011. We have way better 3-point shooters. Jameer/Ellis/Rondo can not compare to D.Williams/Matthews in 3-point shooting. D.Williams is considered to have the best shooting form by some people (really good balance). Wesley Matthews led the league in 3 pointers made before he went down with a season ending achilles injury. He made more threes than Stephen Curry! Wesley Matthews was a really good defender too and we are only hearing good things about him from Portland fans. We overpaid him because he stuck around with us and was loyal after DeAndre Jordan decided to be a douche and go back on his word-kinda like a fuck-you to DeAndre. He was going to sign whether he came or not supposedly.   We're pretty much set at every position except for Center. We have like no depth at center which is really a bad sign for our team. This team can still not rebound for crap- especially since we lost our two best rebounders from last season (Tyson/Aminu). Look for us to have a top 3 offense this year but  have the poorest defense/rebounding :( We traded for Zaza Pachulia for next to nothing from J.Kidds team (Bucks). He's a good rebounder but not the same type of guy as Tyson. He might surprise some people.  Our depth goes like this  Point guard:       Williams/Barea/Harris/Felton  Shooting Guard: Matthews  small Forward:   Parsons/Jefferson/Anderson  Power forward:  Nowitzki/Villanueva/Powell/Evans  Center:            Pachulia/(??????)  We have depth at every position except we're small at center. Carlisle will play backup pg's at shooting guard which works out well for us. Look for Felton to get moved sometime this season for a backup center."

Mavericks,3dzh2w,MutatedCaow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:42:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this was really helpful! I remember seeing stuff about the Rondo trade in the news, what exactly did he do that's led him to have such an acrimonious departure from the Mavs? Or was it just that we gave up the farm for him so to speak, and he didn't do anything?"
Mavericks,3dzh2w,ArmoniaSAS,2,Mon Jul 20 20:46:26 2015 UTC,We traded some youngish players and a draft pick for him thinking he would come and be our long term PG. He began having troubles becausehe wanted to be the boss of the team and he disn't mesh well with them. He then gave up in the playoffs this year and the Mavs didn't let him play
Mavericks,3dzh2w,ArmoniaSAS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:54:23 2015 UTC,"We traded Jameer Nelson/Wright/Crowder/Picks for Rondo/Powell. It was a bad trade looking back, but if you look at the bigger picture we were not going to win a championship with Jameer Nelson as our starting pg (terrible defense). So, long term, the trade ended up being Wright/Crowder/Picks for Powell. Crowder was a really good defender. Wright was like a godly P&R lob dunker that we utilized really well and better than most teams could utilize.  Rondo did not work well here because Carlisle would not let him control the offense and our guys did not really mesh offensively with him. Ellis plays better with the ball in his hands and so does Parsons. Dirk really needs a good shooting pg or sg in the pick and roll and Rondo could not shoot. Rondo plays well when he has good finishers around him (garnett/big baby/ray allen/pierce) and can do whatever he wants offensively. Richard Jefferson accidentally kneed him in the face last year and broke his eye/nose bones loll he ended up missing a bunch of games too. Rondo got injured and never got to mesh with the guys. Rondo got a bad rep with the fans/team/coaches and really did not have the best opportunity to win here because he did not come in free agency and therefore never had a training camp or anything. Carlisle looked relieved as hell when the season ended because he knew Rondo would not be back!"
Mavericks,3dzh2w,Thissucks14,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:03:53 2015 UTC,"BTW Jefferson/Villanueva were vets that signed with us last year and they played well for us so we re-signed them. Jefferson kindof doesn't take a lot of risks on offense, so Rick Carlisle really likes him. He does not really do much outside of shooting, rebounding, and defending (which is great). Villanueva is a lights out shooter. He plays PF and has the fastest stroke I've ever seen. Dude made the clutchest buckets last year. Felton does not get minutes in our rotation, which is fine. We really just took his contract when we got Tyson Chandler back. Justin Anderson we drafted this year and he's really promising (his nickname is simba- he looks like a lion/chris brown). We got Powell when we traded for Rondo, but now we call that trade the Powell trade since we got the best player in the trade ;)"

Mavericks,3dy8tz,gigantism,12,Mon Jul 20 14:47:16 2015 UTC,"Jeremy Tyler better get an invite to camp.  If you think they are similar players let me point out the small differences, Tyler has 7’5” wingspan vs Famous 7’ (on draftexpress it showed 6’11.5”).  So that affects their standing reach, Tyler has 9’2.5” standing reach vs Famous 8’11.5”.  Tyler is 24 vs Famous who is 27.  It’s only partially guaranteed so they might take both into camp and have them battle it out."
Mavericks,3dy8tz,Lifrit,3,Mon Jul 20 18:16:18 2015 UTC,"Good point, but it's also noteworthy that Famous has an inch on Tyler-- 6' 11"" as opposed to 6' 10"". Both seem to have similar SL stats but looks like Jarrid has been working on his game the last few seasons in the D-League (and posting huge numbers while he's at it), while Tyler has been on 10 different teams (including overseas clubs, NBA squads, and D-League teams). It'll be interesting to see who, if either, gets a roster spot."

Mavericks,3dy8tz,Jaschndlr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:05:18 2015 UTC,"I think there's still one more spot on the roster, so this guy is who we chose over Tyler (or, like you said, they'll duke it out in training camp), but we still have room roster-wise and cap-wise for one more player; presumably a big. I could be 100% wrong though."

Mavericks,3dwpa3,Player6505,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:32:17 2015 UTC,"From Wikipedia:  Once a year, teams can use a mid-level exception (MLE) to sign a player to a contract for a specified maximum amount. The amount of the MLE and its duration depend on the team's cap status. The MLE was initially set at $5 million for a duration of four years for teams that are over the cap either before or after the signing, but under the luxury tax apron, which is $4M above the tax line. Teams above the luxury tax apron have an MLE that was initially set at $3 million with a three-year duration. Teams with cap room, previously ineligible for the MLE, have a new MLE, initially $2.5 million with a two-year duration. The MLE was frozen at the stated levels through the 2012–13 season, since then, it will increase by 3% per season (with the percentage based on the initial amount of the exception, and not compounded).[6] In turn, this means that MLEs in the current 2014–15 season are:  $5.305 million for teams without cap room, below the tax apron  $3.278 million for teams over the tax apron  $2.575 million for teams with cap room  Before the 2011 CBA, the MLE was equal to the average NBA salary for all teams over the cap. Teams with cap room were previously ineligible for the MLE.[6] The Mid-Level Exception for the 2008–09 NBA season was $5.585 million.[23] The MLE was $5.854 million for the 2009–10 NBA regular season.[24]"

Mavericks,3dui56,Player6505,9,Sun Jul 19 16:34:23 2015 UTC,"Everyone on here saying his realistic outcome is Danny Green, is going to be proven so wrong.  To me this guy has the makings of a real star in this league."
Mavericks,3dui56,Swamport,7,Sun Jul 19 17:26:38 2015 UTC,I'm just gonna drop this daily reminder that half of first round picks fail to become consistent starters in the league. Justin is looking good but so are many other guys in the summer league.
Mavericks,3dui56,fkndead,6,Sun Jul 19 20:02:41 2015 UTC,"Ya Green is a pretty bad comp. They do pretty much everything differently. Their shot forms are different, their frame and builds are totally different, their athleticism is totally different, even their defensive styles are different. I think Anderson's inside game is really going flourish. Green is basically only a shooter and cutter. Anderson is more of a Parsons-type player when it comes to using his three point shot to drive and attack, which Green never does.   If SL is any indication, I think Wes and Parsons are good comps for Anderson's offensive game (in terms of style and shot selection). Wes can post up and Parsons has a great floater, but other than those go-to shots, Simba has a surprisingly developed arsenal. Even in college he was a three and D and dunk guy. Give him a few years and he'll be even more than that."
Mavericks,3dui56,dirk-41,3,Sun Jul 19 17:42:00 2015 UTC,"The way I look at him is Parsons minus the ball handling, but plus great defense.  Like you said they both dunk and shoot 3's while operating on the perimeter.  Considering we have Parsons already to do the secondary ball handling after the PG, I see no reason that it will be an issue. Most SG/SF don't need to be great at facilitating.   I honestly can see him being a star."
Mavericks,3dui56,Swamport,2,Sun Jul 19 17:46:53 2015 UTC,"To me, with his build and skill set I think his ceiling is jimmy butler. He's that type of athlete/physical specimen. Luckily, he's smart and seems like a good guy who is coachable so I think he's got a good future in the league.   I hope he really works on his handles because that could really turn the kid into something great."
Mavericks,3dui56,piilkypiilk,3,Sun Jul 19 20:45:18 2015 UTC,"yeah IDK why I said Danny Green honestly. I just love his 3 point shooting and defense, what he ALREADY brings and what this dallas team needed. That's why I'm personally comparing that. Their defensive game is honestly different, as well. Simba hustles more.   On top of that, he's supremely athletic. He just needs to develop his handles and better scoring techniques on offense. I love his hustle, and he has the body of a superstar. This is a huge leap he's going to have to take, he's not a deadly scorer yet by any means. I wouldn't hype him too much yet.   He's unique and I don't think we should compare him to players but I can easily see him being a top shooting guard in the league in a few years (simply because that position is a little thin right now, seems like every guy 6'6"" and under wants to bring the ball up).   I think Rick is going to fuckin love this guy. I pray he's not going to be another Dominique Jones."
Mavericks,3dui56,Pyundai,2,Sun Jul 19 18:48:30 2015 UTC,"Are you saying ""Superstar""?"
Mavericks,3dui56,Swamport,0,Sun Jul 19 17:45:17 2015 UTC,"I'm already known as a huge homer, but yes I am saying that.  The kid is 21, and looks like he is ready to play in the NBA.  Some players are just NBA ready from the get go, Parsons is a good example.  This kid is 21, and plays defense, can shoot, and hustles. Those are three of the most important aspects of the game for a wing player.  He has proven he can get to the rim, and isn't afraid to go up for a rebound.  Give him time and I see an extremely bright future for him."

Mavericks,3dui56,cosmicmaverick,4,Sun Jul 19 16:37:38 2015 UTC,I go to UVA now so I got to see this boy play for the last two years. Needless to say I was pretty excited when we drafted him.
Mavericks,3dui56,therhymerr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:03:49 2015 UTC,he reminds me more of a stronger version of Josh Howard
Mavericks,3dui56,Mrjon2009,2,Sun Jul 19 20:38:52 2015 UTC,Josh could handle the ball tho. We will see if this kid gets better at it
