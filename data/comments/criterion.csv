Satyricon is a really eccentric and Fellini plays around a lot with form in it. It's good but maybe not the best indication of what Federico's all about."

I thought the children did great (there's been better, but there's been much worse) and I thought Jacinto was cartoonish but greedy, capitalizing on a war by trying to get off with some money scott-free (and in war profiteering and looting happens, it didn't feel out of the question to me). As to it being a good drama or horror film it was never about Santi, it was about the horror of war that is visited on a group of kids who aren't given a choice in the matter. Del Toro does that a lot, he'll include a weird supernatural element that off-sets the real evil, which is contained in a person/people.   I dunno, just my own thoughts. I definitely get being picky on the child acting because child actors can be really bad, and the villain is cartoonish at its basest without looking at the larger context of the period it is set in. I encourage you to give it another shot. It isn't for everyone but I thought it was a touching little ghost story and loved it."
