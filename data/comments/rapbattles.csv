rapbattles,3e55q1,Blackademiks,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:32:12 2015 UTC,Alot of PG steppin but decent battle nontheless
rapbattles,3e55q1,steelers012,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:57:05 2015 UTC,"Nuun Nuun took this 3-0, D Flamez was really disappointing, he's been better, you need to step up for your PG debuts.  Norbes pretty much giving away that Nuun Nuun will be around, that's good."
rapbattles,3e55q1,Prodigy-II,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:11:44 2015 UTC,In a year are we gonna see Real Deal vs Nuun Nuun lol
rapbattles,3e55q1,Prodigy-II,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:12:01 2015 UTC,Nunn Nunn 3-0. Wasn't that D Flamez was bad or anything. He just wasn't on the same level.
rapbattles,3e55q1,Mr_JFlow,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:12:18 2015 UTC,Battle starts at 15:15
rapbattles,3e55q1,kuyacyph,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:28:59 2015 UTC,"Nunn Nunn probably has the best performance I saw at a battle live, not counting top tiers. Glad to see he's still on a tear. 3-0, not even close."
rapbattles,3e4yfb,NoGodamnName,2,Wed Jul 22 00:09:45 2015 UTC,Bad look for Serius.
rapbattles,3e4yfb,Uza,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:43:46 2015 UTC,yeah i heard it was DNA clearly won and i dont wanna watch the bootleg because the quality is pretty bad after seeing the K-Shine battle bootlegged
rapbattles,3e4yfb,ghostface_bronson,2,Wed Jul 22 00:47:53 2015 UTC,I mean.. is it a battle you're really interested in?
rapbattles,3e4yfb,gezaarr,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:48:40 2015 UTC,to be honest i like DNA
rapbattles,3e4yfb,TsaFack,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:26:30 2015 UTC,brave man
rapbattles,3e4v4r,TsaFack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:43:21 2015 UTC,What if T-Rex just snaps on him.
rapbattles,3e4v4r,Uza,2,Wed Jul 22 00:36:44 2015 UTC,Probably not.
rapbattles,3e55lt,vlookupyou,11,Wed Jul 22 01:08:41 2015 UTC,"No.  Thesaurus, to me, is the gateway battler for West Coast (if not all KOTD) top-tier. Basically: if you can't beat Thesaurus, you can't be West Coast top-tier.  So there."
rapbattles,3e55lt,Uza,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:14:14 2015 UTC,"Does being the ""top tier gatekeeper"" actually make you top tier though, or are you just the best battler who isn't in that category? Either way I think that clout comes from his legacy and not performance in the written arena. I love Thesaurus but bar for bar he is a mid tier battler with a top tier résumé, I really can't see him beating anyone in probably anyone on this subs top 10 and if you're a top tier battler you have to at least have a chance against some of those guys."
rapbattles,3e55lt,J1FP,4,Wed Jul 22 01:43:02 2015 UTC,"Id say he's like the very top of the mid tier, or the buffer zone basically. Too good for mid trier, not good enough for top tier. Just still has a name that carries weight."
rapbattles,3e55lt,Uza,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:09:11 2015 UTC,Also Uza you going to WD5 bro?
rapbattles,3e55lt,Uza,2,Wed Jul 22 01:44:38 2015 UTC,I wish. Not enough frequent flyer miles.
rapbattles,3e55lt,BIackSteel,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:01:43 2015 UTC,Depends which side of the gate you're on.
rapbattles,3e55lt,Prodigy-II,3,Wed Jul 22 03:07:20 2015 UTC,Yeah he is top tier. You just don't have over 100 battles and win rap competitions to be anything less. If you are saying he is dying out? not recently. Seems to have gotten better.
rapbattles,3e55lt,Uza,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:06:25 2015 UTC,Only talking written battle format
rapbattles,3e55lt,Uza,2,Wed Jul 22 02:10:42 2015 UTC,In which he has still won a KOTD Chain and 2v2 Title.
rapbattles,3e55lt,Prodigy-II,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:19:38 2015 UTC,Arcane also won the chain.
rapbattles,3e55lt,KiDisaster,2,Wed Jul 22 02:23:46 2015 UTC,Arcane is one of the best Canadians easy.
rapbattles,3e55lt,DaCultcha,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:29:38 2015 UTC,But no where near top tier
rapbattles,3e55lt,Uza,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:32:14 2015 UTC,Maybe. He outwrote Pat Stay.
rapbattles,3e55lt,DaCultcha,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:39:21 2015 UTC,Who was considered Top Tier before Bargate
rapbattles,3e55lt,5lash3r,2,Wed Jul 22 03:08:34 2015 UTC,"The Saurus is a legend and remains a beast, so nah...I don't agree. He's had a good year so far too. Bender and Rone battles were both dope performances for him."
rapbattles,3e55lt,Prodigy-II,2,Wed Jul 22 02:14:56 2015 UTC,He need to battle URL and we will see what he got in front of a real ass crowd
rapbattles,3e55lt,Prodigy-II,2,Wed Jul 22 02:40:24 2015 UTC,Eh. URL mainstage wouldn't fuck with him and his status is too great for a PG.
rapbattles,3e55lt,Prodigy-II,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:08:23 2015 UTC,Haha he didn't do so well in GT NY so that's a bad idea
rapbattles,3e55lt,Prodigy-II,3,Wed Jul 22 02:54:00 2015 UTC,That was a while ago TBF
rapbattles,3e55lt,Prodigy-II,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:01:38 2015 UTC,"i think Pete has been in the game so long it's almost impossible that he wouldn't be one of the best. He has a great understanding of wordplay, amazing usage of multis, freestyle ability, concepts, angles, delivery... Also, by this point, most of the angles usable against him have been done to death, so he has kind of an extra layer of defense in that regard.  He might not be one of my favs, but i think Thesaurus is pretty unarguably top tier."
rapbattles,3e0snb,DMcSmooth,4,Tue Jul 21 02:05:55 2015 UTC,What?...Why?.....

rapbattles,3dzr57,Prodigy-II,3,Tue Jul 21 00:49:51 2015 UTC,"Hell yes. This means he might have more events, which means to an eventual all out battle rap brawl. I mean the dude's name is Dizaster after all, it's bound to happen right? And I want to watch it."

rapbattles,3dzsey,Joeeats,6,Mon Jul 20 21:21:27 2015 UTC,"Dude, Illipsis vs Isaac Knox? YES. This is the battle I didnt know I always wanted. Im glad someone took notice of Isaacs thread on RMBVA a few weeks back. He posted asking to be on the WD5 GZ card because it wasnt on one of the days he works as a freestyle rapper at Disneyland (WHAT) Dig both of those guys, they should put on a great battle."
rapbattles,3dzsey,skriimish,4,Mon Jul 20 22:35:41 2015 UTC,one of the days he works as a freestyle rapper at Disneyland (WHAT) Dig both of those guys   HAHAHAHAHA are you for real??? Isaac Knox has now taken the least authentic battle rapper slot by a wide margin. That's the funniest thing I've heard all day.
rapbattles,3dzsey,DMcSmooth,6,Mon Jul 20 23:20:16 2015 UTC,I think it's dope he somehow managed to make money doing something he loves.
rapbattles,3dzsey,DMcSmooth,4,Tue Jul 21 01:50:02 2015 UTC,"Mhmm, I agree. But you've gotta agree at least to some degree that the fact that he works at Walt Disney World completely negates any tough angle he ever comes with."
rapbattles,3dzsey,LittleGiga,4,Tue Jul 21 02:02:15 2015 UTC,"I usually think it is ridiculous saying stuff like that about battlers, since not one of them shoots people on a daily basis and ""lives that life"", but he LITERALLY works at Disney Land..."
rapbattles,3dzsey,ParkJi-Sung,3,Tue Jul 21 08:35:53 2015 UTC,"Knox is the dream maker baby, he's got Mickey, Pluto & that cat Oliver from the 80's, as his hypemen whilst he's spitting 16's for the Patriots and Brady.  Plus there's always a mean Hook in there somewhere."

Something about Isaac Knox doesnt jive with me in a music sense. He's a great battler, but for some reason I just cant get into his music."

rapbattles,3dzsey,ParkJi-Sung,2,Mon Jul 20 22:52:23 2015 UTC,I think both of them have surpassed him though.

rapbattles,3dzsey,Prodigy-II,3,Tue Jul 21 01:51:01 2015 UTC,"I'm happy with the matchups, especially Illipsis vs Isaac Knox, but there's no representation from other countries?

rapbattles,3dyj6s,Mynameisdunsh,3,Mon Jul 20 16:50:01 2015 UTC,"You have a Kid Twist vocal tone. Good performance. A lot of your lines are good wordplay with eh punches but you sell them well.  Also, Shotty Horroh spit 'this ain't just his league' against Daylyt."

rapbattles,3dyj6s,Mynameisdunsh,3,Mon Jul 20 17:20:19 2015 UTC,"I thought it was dope. I see the Kid Twist in your voice but outside of that I don't see much else in common outside of you both being white.  Very good performance, you don't rush through your bars and the content is different. It's not always the strongest but you deliver them with confidence and that's all that really matters. You got anything booked next?"
rapbattles,3dyj6s,Blackademiks,3,Mon Jul 20 17:51:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks, my goal is to be accessible but also have material that ""seasoned"" fans can appreciate. You'll most likely see something new in October, nothing official but some exciting things in the works."

rapbattles,3dyf0y,Uza,2,Mon Jul 20 18:18:16 2015 UTC,"Danny's career prospects are on the line with this battle. If he loses this battle 3-0 then it's going to be hard for him moving forward outside of the battles he's already booked for this year.   Rex could win, in some people's minds, by throwing his hat and water during the first round. In the second round Rex makes it rain with $12K and spits recycled mixtape bars in the third.
