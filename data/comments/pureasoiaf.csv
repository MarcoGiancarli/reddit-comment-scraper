You have Daenerys's conception in the year following the beginning of the rebellion.  I was under the impression that it was a possibility that she was conceived on the night of Lord Rickard's burning.  It believe it had been said that Aerys rarely touched his wife, but that he became sexually aroused by the burning and had violently taken his wife that night."

pureasoiaf,3e4urn,gmrf,3,Wed Jul 22 00:27:33 2015 UTC,"Davos is a great man, but he I don't think he would make a great king.  He is only comfortable as a smuggler and has absolutely no ambition.  He is very self-deprecating and would never be happy sitting on the throne.  The biggest problem though, would be the rest of the lords agreeing to follow him and accept him as King, and you have to imagine that managing your lords is a big part of being king.  He would make a great Master of Ships, though.  Garlan seems like an obvious choice, as does Doran.  To play devil's advocate though, Garlan may be too honorable to play the game well (like Ned), and Doran's crippling gout might make ruling difficult - he couldn't even sit the throne.  I assume we are only using people still alive at the end off book 5.    Aegon might legitimately make a great king.  He has been trained for it since birth.  I may get proven wrong in the future if he gets a chance.    We hear generally favorable things about Mathis Rowan - he seems to be both well liked and competent without being cruel or petty.

I can't see Jon wanting a throne, any throne. I can't see any way that isn't a total deus ex machina for people to 1) find out r+l=j and 2) care and 3) care enough to put him on a throne. (Howland Reed? A harp? nah, not good enough)  And Dany like...I see her going total bat shit crazy villian, like her father, to be honest. I can see her hooking up with Euron because homeboy is crazy, and they would be a great pair that would end up killing each other.

They could end up as happy together as Ned and Cat were, but I don't think they can (except in an implicit, unfolding way) within the timeline I assume the books will follow. This is assuming we don't get the time-jump some people want (I think this would be a terrible idea).  So maybe they do get together and we see some nice parallels with N/C, and then near the end we see a burgeoning affection (that is never fully there during the books, except maybe in an epilogue).

I would like for her to realize that she can do more good, and help more people, by remaining in Essos. If she would just let go of her little Westerosi grudge, she could rebuild a new Targaryen dynasty in Essos. Her rule would spread, eventually abolishing all slavery across the continent.  It is for this reason that I would like for her to wed a powerful Essosi nobleman. Whoever has the most power, money, and influence. Xaro Xohan Daxos would be a good candidate.

Larger excerpt:   ""Once you have mastered your gifts, you may look where you will and see what the trees have seen, be it yesterday or last year or a thousand ages past. Men live their lives trapped in an eternal present, between the mists of memory and the sea of shadow that is all we know of the days to come. Certain moths live their whole lives in a day, yet to them that little span of time must seem as long as years and decades do to us. An oak may live three hundred years, a redwood tree three thousand. A weirwood will live forever if left undisturbed. To them seasons pass in the flutter of a moth's wing, and past, present, and future are one. Nor will your sight be limited to your godswood.

pureasoiaf,3dw831,the_mouse_that_roars,33,Mon Jul 20 01:25:51 2015 UTC,"One of the main reasons that I've seen for Benjen joining the Nights Watch relies on you believeing that R+L=J is real and that Ned told Benjen, or Benjen knew, and so instead of carrying that secret with him as Ned was forced to do, Benjen instead decided that he wanted to rid himself of the 'Game of Thrones' and all that came with it and dedicate himself to defending the realm. I've also seen it suggested that Ned asked Benjen to go there himself so that if the North fell to war or something like that and Ned (and probably Howland) were killed, Benjen would still have information about Jon's real parentage. Of course if that's true, that Benjen was sent there to kind of 'live on' then that backfired massively, but it could have made sense to Ned and Benjen back when they were still young and right off the back of a world-devestating rebellion.  Alternatively he may have just figured that he was never going to rule Winterfell and wanted to do some good in the world. He may be one of the only men who went to the Wall that actually volunteered to be there, as opposed to be Targaryen loyalists or just common thieves and murderers.  I guess my comment does rely on Benjen actually knowing about Lyanna, Rhaegar and Jon, but I can't remember if that's ever actually been suggested anywhere, so I could be shooting in the dark."
pureasoiaf,3dw831,Zaccyjaccy,4,Mon Jul 20 01:48:14 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely open to the idea of R+L = J, it is a theory that makes sense to me, I think my main hesitation is that I'm afraid to get set on it, GRRM seems like he may decide to change things simply because people guessed his original plan. I don't think feel that Ned would have asked Benjen to go, but he would absolutely support it if it was what Benjen wished. I think Ned was aware enough of life on the wall to know that in war, he could maneuver his command to keep Benjen relatively safe (probably charged with holding and caring for Winterfell and the north) without sending him to a life without a wife, lands or sons.   I think he may have known about Lyanna, it seems to be something Ned would have shared with him at the very least though I suppose they never did appear all that close."

R+L=J and Gravedigger = Hound are the only ""major"" theories I can think of off the top of my head that just seem 100% canon. People on Reddit talk about the gravedigger chapter like it's a theory you have to investigate, but for me personally when I read the book without having read the theory online I just thought to myself after like the 2nd clue ""yep, that's definitely the Hound."""

pureasoiaf,3dw831,brian5476,15,Mon Jul 20 16:08:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think Benjen left until Eddard had an heir (when he came from from Big Bobby B's Rebellion and had Robb), which tells you it had to do with Benjen knowing he wasn't next in line anymore.   Remember when Arya asked Eddard what Bran could do? That Bran wanted to be kingsguard before he fell? Well, Bran was only 2nd in line after Robb, but he was already raised knowing that Robb would be heir, and he would need to find something else to do. This is similiar in how Ned, as a 2nd son, was sent away to the Eerie to grow up while his older brother Brandon was busy learning how to be the heir. It's unclear what he might have done if Brandon had survived and married Catelyn, he might have joined the Night's Watch, also.   So, anyhow, back to Bran's options: he could be a knight/kingsguard, or, like Eddard said, man a holdfast for his older brother. These 2nd and 3rd sons taking holdfasts, marrying, and having kids is where you get these cadet branches of Starks (Greystarks, Karstarks, etc.) But the cadet branches have a history of siding with the Boltons and turning on Winterfell, so the Starks might push their younger sons toward vocations like the Watch, or kingsguard, to avoid that.  Likely Benjen knew that once Ned had an heir, it was unlikely he'd ever rule Winterfell, so he decided that instead of manning some holdfast, he'd go to a place where he could rise as high as he was able, and being a Stark? That could be quite high, indeed.  Plus, does a man who made 1st ranger seem like the type of man to want to meekly run some random holdfast for his older brother?  I think his choice speaks to his personality, not any R+L=J theories."
pureasoiaf,3dw831,OzMazza,5,Mon Jul 20 09:34:14 2015 UTC,You're far too reasonable!
pureasoiaf,3dw831,ntermation,10,Mon Jul 20 14:33:56 2015 UTC,I think its that the Starks remember a nobler time of the Wall (the great hall or whatever has the house shields of all the knights who served on the wall at Castle Black and was only one or two by Jon's time.) and therefore they see it as their duty to send one son to try and motivate other houses to do so as well. Make it seem like more of an honour than a punishment.
pureasoiaf,3dw831,wwxxyyzz,7,Mon Jul 20 05:08:05 2015 UTC,Maybe he prefers the company of men?
pureasoiaf,3dw831,repo_sado,5,Mon Jul 20 03:46:30 2015 UTC,"I thought of that as well, but that's usually something that is kept quiet (I sort of assumed that was part of Edmure Tully's long bachelor's life before his wedding) and also because in the first book when Jon approaches him about joining the NW  he does seem reluctant and tries to tell Jon that he has no idea what he's giving up. It seemed by that point at least, Benjen had some regrets."
pureasoiaf,3dw831,BellyFullOfSwans,3,Mon Jul 20 04:02:44 2015 UTC,"tries to tell Jon that he has no idea what he's giving up   If Benjen knew about R+L=J then he could have been reluctant to recommend the NW, as by doing so he has to give up all claims to land and titles"
pureasoiaf,3dw831,Rodents210,3,Mon Jul 20 08:38:29 2015 UTC,i think the opposite really. and ned does know and he thinks it would be a good place for jon but when he is a bit older.  really it's the perfect place for rhaegar's son. keeps him from being another claim. ned clearly has no intention of ever trying to win him a throne. it's better to completely renounce the claim
pureasoiaf,3dw831,JewBot6000,6,Mon Jul 20 13:33:48 2015 UTC,"Outside of the events we can only surmise from tin foil and conjecture, we know what being a 3rd son offers you in Westeros.  The Wall was almost as famous for having a Stark there as Winterfell is, so when Benjen was impressed with a Nights Watch recruiter, it seemed like a good way to follow a tradition that 2 of his brothers didnt have to die for him to have a chance at.  There are bound to be other reasons, but that seems to be what the book tells you we know already.  Im interested to see if his role in R + L = J has anything to do with it as well."
pureasoiaf,3dw831,Rodents210,4,Mon Jul 20 02:21:02 2015 UTC,I think it's simpler than most are trying to make it. Benjen was the third son and the Starks historically respect the NW much more than other Houses. I believe R+L=J but I absolutely do not believe Benjen knew about it. I think he joined the NW because between Ned and Robb he wasn't ever going to hold land and joining the NW was considered a very honorable thing to do by the Starks.
pureasoiaf,3dw831,JewBot6000,3,Mon Jul 20 12:59:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's fair to assume Benjen ""wasn't ever going to hold land"". There is ample land in the north, especially after a war.  After losing Rickard, Brandon, and Lyanna during the rebellion, there is more reason than ever to spread the Stark name. Benjen could enter an arranged marriage with an eligible woman from an ally house and manage his own small keep. It wouldn't be Wintefell, but not every Lannister lives in Casterly Rock. It's important to keep sowing the seeds, to prevent a tragedy from wiping out their house name entirely."
pureasoiaf,3dw831,Khal_wolf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:02:08 2015 UTC,"There is land, but there aren't castles. And most of the land belongs to Winterfell or the castles of a minor house anyway.

pureasoiaf,3dw831,Harkoncito,2,Mon Jul 20 05:38:14 2015 UTC,"I suppose that's true. His reason for being a man of the NW may have only existed as a reason for why Jon would have gone there and elected to stay there. At the same time I feel like it could have been just as easy as having the option exist without Benjen' s character. As they say, even a bastard can rise high in the NW. I think it would have had some appeal anyway."
pureasoiaf,3dw831,repo_sado,3,Mon Jul 20 06:01:07 2015 UTC,"It's never directly stated as far as I remember, but we do know that 3rd+ children of houses aren't going to inherit anything unless their older siblings die. We also know they're not as likely to be married off because of that.

It legitimizes their rule of the North to be seen as selfless in the defense of their land.  One theory I have is that Robert's Rebellion made Benjen addicted to combat. He began First Ranger because he is constantly trying to go out and scratch that itch for combat. There's not much support for it, but I like that it's plausible and also requires no information about other characters. It is completely independent of R+L=J. Occam's Razor says he joined because he wanted to join."

pureasoiaf,3dvncp,the_real_4chan,37,Sun Jul 19 22:24:25 2015 UTC,"Ultimately he was tied to a specific location, which the nights watch knew was there, and he was out numbered significantly. I think it was a mutually beneficial situation, whereby they left him alone, in exchange for him helping them. But he wasn't exactly happy about it. If he could tell them to fsck off and get away with it, he probably would have. Since he had no plans or desire to do anything south of the wall, they had no reason to shut down his operation. That alone might not have been enough to make them leave him alone, so he also provided information and shelter if they needed it. I don't think either side were happy with the arrangement, but they both got something out of it."
pureasoiaf,3dvncp,ntermation,9,Sun Jul 19 22:50:26 2015 UTC,My guess was that his sacrifices were widely known about and he's seen as a pariah by most. Nights watch were probably one of the few willing to deal with him.
pureasoiaf,3dvncp,DustyFalmouth,5,Sun Jul 19 23:05:17 2015 UTC,"A lot of good insight already posted, but I would imagine that it comes down to basic necessity.  Craster was as known entity who was willing to play ball: he was willing to provide a roof in exchange for goods. Mention is made elsewhere by Mance in the books that contact between the wildlings and the Watch was more frequent than might be imagined.   So the rangers from the Watch bring gifts, food, supplies, or what have you, and Craster offers up some floor to sleep on. The Watch is not concerned necessarily with the eradication of the Wildings, but when they start to mass behind a King-beyond-the-wall the situation changes, to be sure.   Craster, being in a fixed location constrained by the demands of keeping a solitary stronghold populated only by himself and a harem of daughter-wives, must, by necessity, be willing to engage in mutually beneficial trade if he is to continue surviving as free folk.   The amicable relations only extend as far as the demands of the relationships, and he makes his abundantly clear. So to answer your question, he doesn't do it out of the good his heart, but only because he gets something out of it. He can't stand against the might of the Watch, and so he takes a diplomatic approach while maintaining his own separation and boundaries."
pureasoiaf,3dvncp,wbhoy,12,Mon Jul 20 02:39:01 2015 UTC,"I think it was because of Guest Right.   When the Night's Watch showed up at his keep they became his guests. Gifts were exchanged, Wine/Steel on the NW's part and food/protection on Craster's. It further goes to show how sacred a thing Guest Right was considered, even in the far north."
pureasoiaf,3dvncp,_Jory_Cassel,7,Sun Jul 19 22:47:50 2015 UTC,I believe you and the other poster have as much credit towards why he did it.  It was a symbiotic relationship where the next morning no one ended up dead.
pureasoiaf,3dvncp,bellaButthole,3,Mon Jul 20 00:16:11 2015 UTC,"I think your response is correct as far as why the relationship hadn't soured previously, but the bigger question of why the relationship began still remains.  Guest right doesn't apply until you let someone in and serve them bread and salt.  What made him do that in the first place?    The only reason I can think of is that they would have simply killed him if he didn't help them.  Beyond that, the only thing they could offer him is weapons - and how many could he really need?  By leaving him alive and a ""friend,"" the NW basically created an outpost for rangings that was always stocked with food and firewood.  Still, seems pretty dick on the part of the NW.  I've always wondered if there is more to the story."

'Oh yeah, don't worry we know what you mean.' 'Yup, you need to come over here and take care of someone for me.' 'Okay then buddy we'll send someone right over...

pureasoiaf,3dr11l,ServiceMonkee,35,Sat Jul 18 16:59:03 2015 UTC,"One thing that I wish someone had told me before my first read: don't skip anything!  Especially because you've watched the show, you may find yourself tempted to skip paragraphs or even larger chunks when it seems like something you're already familiar with. This is not going to help you, it will likely leave you confused when little things that you missed are being referenced later.  When I first read through the series, anytime I encountered passages about prophecy or legends from a thousand years ago, my eyes glazed over and I skimmed through that section. I assumed it would not be relevant to the actual story. I was very wrong to think this way.  In short: do not skip a single line of these books. Everything is there for a reason.  Edit: Also, it is unreasonable to expect that you will catch everything going on in this story during your first read. The narrative is massive and sprawling, with many subtleties and implied events happening behind closed doors. I recommend posting in this subreddit whenever you have any questions, especially after you complete each novel."
pureasoiaf,3dr11l,JewBot6000,13,Sat Jul 18 17:09:18 2015 UTC,"Piggybacking off this:  1) Read every chapter! You might see Name and be like ""damn, I hate their chapters"". They have a POV for a reason. You will wreck your life if you start skipping whole chapters b/c you hate the character who owns it.   2) Use the Maps. Every time you see a place name, try to find it. When they are marching west, go look at the map. When they say they are in blank sailing to blank, flip to that back or front cover and look it up! I went 4 books thinking White Harbor, Dragonstone, and Essos were on the west side of Westros (don't ask), and that sucks.   3) All the books have lists of people for each house. Right down to the stable boys, often times. Nor sure who someone is? Flip to the back of the book and look them up (goggle will ruin you with spoilers so hard, avoid it)! They will prob come back up again later, and after a few times of this, you won't wonder who Jory Cassel is. You'll just be like 'yay, Jory again!'  4) The chapters are short. Not 2 pages long, but maybe 10-15? Which means it's super easy to pick a book up on your break, when you are bored at the doctor's office, or while waiting for water to boil. I find that GRRM has crafted every chapter with a beginning, middle, and end, and a take away. They are mini-books in themselves, and he's cut out all the fluff. I know people bitch about how he describes food and landscape and fucking, but he makes sure that if you pay attention, even the food they serve will give you a feeling about the scene, and hints about the hosts and guests. He isn't Poe, but he isn't as superfluous as Tolkien. It's all interesting!   5) Once you start reading...stay out of here! Give reddit a break, and just read everything. Once you surface for that re-read, then it's time to come back and ask and play. You want the full experience, not all of us telling you how to think about this passage or that one (and gods, we will, we can't help it).  6) You are about to enter a world that makes the show seem as complicated (and interesting) as a 2 piece jigsaw puzzle. You are going to love it. Enjoy!"

Also Jon executing Janos Slynt was one of the most shocking moments in A Dance With Dragons because I had an image of him becoming this big antagonist for the book.  Basically I love A Dance with Dragons.  But my favorite quote from the series is Septon Meribald's speech about broken men from AFFC. That is one of the most beautiful little moments in the series for me.

pureasoiaf,3difzm,nbrichardson,2,Thu Jul 16 19:14:12 2015 UTC,Completely agree on all three points. Jon choosing execution was a point where it hit that he was lord commander and he had big decisions to make.

A man in dark armor and a pale pink cloak spotted with blood stepped up to Robb. “Jaime Lannister sends his regards.” He thrust his longsword through her son’s heart, and twisted. Robb had broken his word, but Catelyn kept hers..... ...Finally someone took the knife away from her. The tears burned like vinegar as they ran down her cheeks. Ten fierce ravens were raking her face with sharp talons and tearing off strips of flesh, leaving deep furrows that ran red with blood. She could taste it on her lips. It hurts so much, she thought. Our children, Ned, all our sweet babes. Rickon, Bran, Arya, Sansa, Robb... Robb... please, Ned, please, make it stop, make it stop hurting... The white tears and the red ones ran together until her face was torn and tattered, the face that Ned had loved. Catelyn Stark raised her hands and watched the blood run down her long fingers, over her wrists, beneath the sleeves of her gown. Slow red worms crawled along her arms and under her clothes. It tickles. That made her laugh until she screamed. “Mad,” someone said, “she’s lost her wits,” and someone else said, “Make an end,” and a hand grabbed her scalp just as she’d done with Jinglebell, and she thought, No, don’t, don’t cut my hair, Ned loves my hair. Then the steel was at her throat, and its bite was red and cold.  The contrast between only being vaguely aware of her surroundings to the detailed metaphors of her pain and grief is incredible, but perhaps the most poignant part is the sudden fixation to a seemingly insignificant factor; her hair, in particular the reference to her dead husband's love in the present tense.  The end of this chapter and the arya chapter following was absolutely gut wrenching."

pureasoiaf,3difzm,LaStrasbourgeoisette,6,Thu Jul 16 17:21:47 2015 UTC,I hated Theon! His betrayal was horrible and I still have some resentment towards him. But seeing his arc and what he goes through really changed my perspective. Still that betrayal was horrible.

Characters appearances are never very solid for me when reading books, so seeing their show counterparts has become the only image I see when reading the books.  I really wish I would have read the entire series before watching any of the show because of it. I read AGoT, then watched Season 1. Then I read ACoK, then watched Season 2, etc. This caused my mental images of the characters to be very distorted."

pureasoiaf,3difzm,RCiancimino,10,Thu Jul 16 19:07:56 2015 UTC,Sansa should have backed Arya's story (aka the truth) but instead turned on her own family because she was a crap sister and had a dumb crush on one of the most hated characters in the entire series. On top of that she had every reason to expect that Nymeria would have faced the retribution Lady suffered and didn't seem to care.
pureasoiaf,3difzm,ThereRNoFkingNmsleft,16,Thu Jul 16 19:23:53 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but I really can't blame her. She was just a child, and she was asked to call her betrothed (a prince) a liar in front of the King, Queen, and a whole lot of other people.  That's a ton of pressure.  Also, I seriously doubt she realized that anyone was going to execute either wolf.  She was just a kid who had no way of knowing how dangerous her situation was."
pureasoiaf,3difzm,TheRealSlimStannis,5,Thu Jul 16 19:28:03 2015 UTC,"So she just called her family liars and that's more reasonable? And then after she still blames Arya?

pureasoiaf,3difzm,qqeyes,2,Fri Jul 17 04:33:06 2015 UTC,"Again, I don't really disagree with you, especially when you consider she's the child of Ned Stark, FTR, I think any of Ned's sons would have told the truth but there are some contributing factors to that. Like that Ned has explicitly taught them about honor and life/death situations (something the girls haven't been privy to), and (this is a big one) as a woman in this culture Sansa has had it instilled in her that she has/will have certain duties and obligations to her husband. I just think it was a difficult situation that Sansa, a sheltered child of 12 or 13, didn't have the tools to handle. And a lot of the errors she makes in GoT I blame on Ned. Homegirl was in a viper's pit being used as a pawn and had no idea and no instruction."
pureasoiaf,3difzm,roflmoar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:37:21 2015 UTC,You raise an excellent point. But her little sister was a female too.

Tyron is told that the people of the city are not happy, hate the Lannisters and would turn on them in heartbeat.  Now Tyrion is like ""what, they hate me, too?"" because in his mind, he is much, much better than monsters like Joff and Cersei. But Tyrion is told ""uh yeah, in fact they hate you most of all.""  It's hard to describe this scene because it's so insignificant. It's just that this is the everyday reality of what Tyrion's life is like. No matter what he does, in the end everything that goes even slightly wrong will always be blamed on him because he is a ""hideous and misshapen"" monster dwarf. In-universe it's basically a trope.  I think that 200 years from the current timeline, there is a good chance that the story told to children will be that the handsome, young golden boy king (Joffrey) was misled by evil councilors until he was finally murdered by his evil, dwarf uncle."

Someone much smarter than me has written a three part essay series about her future path, here . There is also a audio version of it on that Wordpress.   Now Jon: I find Jons arc to be one of the less interesting ones in asoiaf, it is the most typical Monomyth/Hero's Journey besides Danys in asoiaf. But, it is not just about ""keeping his vows or not"". It is also about overcoming age old devisions, keeping power while following a unpopular path, factions in a organization where people come in from different background, like the military or prison.   Now Tyrion:   However, he then reks himself by joining up with the Second Sons.   I disagree here as well. That was one of his best moves he made so far. It puts him in a position where he can bring something to whom ever will be ruling Mereen after the battle of fire, and who knows how many Second Sons will be left by the time he conquers Casterly Rock.

No idea who rules what.

Most people think the battle of dawn will be at the trident and if thats the case than that means the north must have been ravaged and destroyed by the others leaving it a desolate wasteland. A new wall might have to be built at the neck assuming that the originL wall was brought down in order for the others to get past or maybe someone made peace with the others by fucking the ice queen so the north just becomes a new nation of others that is part of the realm. If the bloodless men beyond the five forts in yi ti are synonymous with the others then perhaps in the east we will have the jogo nhai the yitish and the asshais unite to fight against them. But anyway i think for the most part borders would remain the same and people would go back to playing the game of thrones once it done and over

I will try to explain it below:  How dare you even suggest Lord Snow here? A bastard get of a traitor, a traitor himself. Lording over us scum in his eyes since the day he arrived in the yard and thought he knew how to hold a blade. Friend to wildling scum and craven green boys, himself a green summer boy, pretending to lord over us while taking away our lands to give to our enemies. Consort to spearwives and faithless sorceress, meddling in the affairs of the realm, inviter of wretched creatures into the realms of men. Abandoner of his post at the first chance, only to return when doomed by his actions, refusing to sound his horn when approaching the Wall and leading the Wildlings through instead. Is there a vow he has NOT broken, I ask you?  For the Watch!  About Barristan, someone who chooses to follow a woman above the One True King is not doing the right thing. Someone who had turned his cloack to an usurper before, rather than die for his king, someone who resisted arrest to the point of killing 4 guardsmen to escape...  Addam refused to follow his Queen's orders and betrayed her when she ordered him imprisoned. He should have stayed and proved his loyalty rather than escaping, forcing their hand, despite later atoning for this. He probably did more wrong things, but as ever, history remembers only choice pieces of people's lifes, magnifying some things and forgetting most others.  If you look deep enough, even the greatest legend did wrong.  In the words of the Hound: ""There are no true knights, no more than there are gods. If you can't protect yourself, die and get out of the way of those who can. Sharp steel and strong arms rule this world, don't ever believe any different."""
pureasoiaf,3dhdft,RMoncho,2,Thu Jul 16 09:29:31 2015 UTC,"For Jon, I know you are playing devils advocate and speaking through perspective so i will do the same and defend it. -  He knew how to hold a sword.  He was 14 in AGoT and probably been training since he was 6 or 7.  I didn't know it was a crime to befriend someone another person dislikes. The creatures he invited to the realms of men. ARE MEN.  Most of the Nights Watch seem to have forgotten the Wall wasn't put up to keep the wildlings out but  to keep the Others out.  So if you were to deny men the safety of your wall, that makes you a traitor. As for abandoning his post, he stayed with the wildlings just long enough to find out about the Horn of Winter from Ygritte then returned to the wall and followed orders exactly. So yeah, i agree, everyone is mostly gray or just pure black.  No one is perfectly white (while maybe Ned was)  but if we had to name a few that were close i would say Jon would be a closer one."

In my opinion the biggest heroes are John, Tyrion, Dany, Davos, Brienne, Mance, and most of all Jaime. John saved the lives of a huge number of both free folk and nights watch / northerners by letting the remaining wildlings pass. Tyrion, well he has helped a lot of people from bran in the first book all the way through jorah in the adwd. Dany liberated thousands of slaves, so I'll leave it at that. Davos saved storms end, when he really had to obligation to do it. Brienne is obvious. Mance also played ah huge role in saving the free folk and getting them south to the wall. And Jaime, yea he killed his king and broke his vow, but we are taking about notoriously crazy king who would have taken down the entirety of kings landing had his plans went off. Because of Jaimes difficult choice that didn't happen, and Jaime never even tries to make an excuse, he just accepts it and moves on. He confronts Ned in the street over his beloved brother being kidnapped and when you really look at it, that's not much of a surprise. He also keeps his word to Cat long after she has died, and equips Brienne to go out and fulfill her own promise."

His rigid unbending honorable personality makes him an unintentional force for evil in a couple cases. I'm going to shamelessly cut and paste and old post of mine because I don't feel like re writing it:  So I recently got my girlfriend to read the books. after talking to her I was really surprised to find she couldn't stand Ned.  Her reasoning was his stiff and rigid commitment to honor really hurts everyone around him. I read back through and she had a really interesting point.   When we first meet him he is beheading someone who deserted in the face if the supernatural others. Maybe not the wrong thing to do but it really sets up his character.   When the king comes to visit he is offered a position he really doesn't want. In honor of the king and his friendship he takes it. Splitting up his family so some of his children grow up for years without a mother, some without a father.   When Jon leaves for the wall he does nothing to dissuade him or warn him of how hard and un rewarding that is, simply says something like ""there is honor in that path"". Jon later reflects that Tyrion was the only one who told him the truth. This one actually really bothers me. Can't give your son (adopted or otherwise) life advice if it means bad mouthing the watch.   His time as the hand is alright. He does a lot of bowing to Roberts wishes but it seems hard not to.  But the absolute worse is the night of Roberts death. People organize their house troops to GIVE HIM - THE RIGHTFUL REGENT - THE CASTLE without him needing to do anything. And he declines because it would dishonor Roberts memory or some crap. Obviously the Lannisters are very responsible for Westeros going into war. But in the ""all it takes for  evil to triumph is for good men to stand by and do nothing"" sense of things, Ned really is responsible as well. He could have saved Westeros and the Stark family if he wasn't crippled by his overwhelming sense of honor.   Any ways I still like him but it's an interesting enough perspective I thought I'd share."

Everyone gets taken away what they value most, what they define them selfs with. Jamie looses his sword hand, Cat her children, Theon... well, Sansa her high standing, Arya... everything, Bran his dream of being a knight, Brienne is about to loose her honor after having lost her king to serve, Tyrion his family, positions, and more, Davos his sons and fingers???(I feel his loss will have more to do with Stannis) Sam his virginity ;) Cersei her beauty and (soon) her kids and you can probably find many more  Some of these characters get to define them selfs new and keep on living, some don't.   Also we have external moral codes vs internal moral codes. See Stannis and Dany. Stannis may be a bit of a hypocrite and apply his code not so harshly to him self(but who does) but his code is internal. He is a king, wants do not enter into it(always be on good terms with the mods) while Danys anti slavery stands come from what she experiences and sees. So do her methods of governing. Thats why she seems so inconsistent to us. Those differences come probably mostly from age difference, but it is a overarching theme we see in many characters.   Then we also have people being confronted with things they can not possible understand, and their reaction to that, like Cat and the shadow baby."

pureasoiaf,3ddql9,Surgefist,7,Fri Jul 17 13:13:10 2015 UTC,"I think two.  The first is how plans get fucked up. Man plans and grrm laughs. Plots occasionally work out but most often they're foiled, usually by the machinations of the plotter himself.  The second one is the different powers of being good and being bad. People in asoiaf do evil things which help them get ahead, but those advantages rarely stick. Walder Frey and Roose Bolton win against the Starks but lose the north. Theon wins Winterfell but loses it because of a few evil acts done to secure his position. Conversely, the Starks lose everything in the short term but due to their kindness and honor the survivors end up with a ton. Stannis's honor gives him the allegiance of Jon, whose honor gives him the Wall. A mistake a lot of people make is thinking A Song of Ice and Fire is about bad things happening. It's about the moments of grace that are found amongst those bad things."

There's really, from what I can remember, no evidence supporting the notion that Bloodraven or the Children of the Forest want humanity to continue in its current state. One possibility that I see happening is that Bloodraven deceives Bran to serve anti-Westeros/anti-Other purpose, Bran realizes what's happening, and somehow kills Bloodraven and takes his place as the top-tier greenseer.

Those were his duties and all his actions were in service to them.  His time in the Night's Watch made him become the same type of pragmatist when it came his position there, in this case that means preservation of the realm from whatever lies north of The Wall.  Given his abilities I imagine he quickly became aware to some degree of the larger threat of The Others relatively soon.

Not that he's a sociopath, but his behavior with respect to Hodor totally ignores Hodor as an entity, and is very selfish, selfcentered and cruel. There's a definite rapey vibe to his Hodor interactions and while he doesn't think about it too much (due to his eagerness to use Hodor) he directly acknowledges that Hodor truly doesn't like his mind being taken over, and is scared huddled in the back of his own mind sort of crying or moaning, like a beaten animal.

I dare you to find me a DUDE under 16 who hasn't made ""questionable choices."" Moreover, he protects Hodor. They have a mutually beneficial relationship. Hodor wouldn't be alive without Bran and vice versa. They have a Love for each other; just cuz Hodor gets scared a couple times doesn't mean he's being ""raped?!?!?"" Bran has cried and huddled in a corner; I'm pretty sure I didn't miss Bran getting raped. Hodor is just, fundamentally, disadvantaged mentally. He can't differentiate from Bran helping/saving them between his own personal autistic-like insecurities. Nothing suggests to me Bran has any negative tendencies; if anything he's shown too much empathetic weakness (which I personally don't consider a weakness).

I also think Benjen is still alive, since the other rangers he was with have come back as wights and he wasn't among them.  So my guess is that the Others will somehow make their way into the cave.  They will kill off Bloodraven and take Bran captive to the far north.  There he will be thrown into an ice cage with his uncle Benjen and find out that the Others will not kill Starks due to some ancient agreement.  This will give Bran an actual conflict and adventure: even when he's trapped in the Others' prison, he'll use his warging and greenseeing powers to fight the Others and warn his family about the oncoming attack.

There is a remote possibility GRRM might allow one important exception to the rule, but if so, he won't use it liberally, and it will only happen at some vital juncture in the plot. 5% chance of this happening IMHO.

pureasoiaf,3d9ey3,twerkysandwich,3,Wed Jul 15 02:05:34 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand. I think Bran loves Meera, and vice versa, so he will try something sexual with her, likely using Hodor, and perhaps crush her by accident when she struggles."
pureasoiaf,3d9ey3,Falling_Pies,2,Wed Jul 15 03:15:25 2015 UTC,"I definitely think there's some antagonism potential. Bran is deep in with the Old Gods, the Red God's people are on a mission in Westeros now that is basically a mission of conversion."
pureasoiaf,3d9ey3,commoner80,2,Tue Jul 14 20:49:42 2015 UTC,"My general opinion is that he'll make it back and reclaim Winterfell. Too many repetitions of 'there will always be a Stark at Winterfell' and during his visions 'Winter is coming' is also underscored.  In this context it sounded like a birthright to me.   Also, it doesn't seem to further the story if he dies. He hasn't made any mistakes and he's never been in a position of power. After all this effort to keep him alive.   Not an answer to your question, sorry."
pureasoiaf,3d9ey3,KosmicMicrowave,2,Wed Jul 15 00:49:57 2015 UTC,I think Bran is going to end up killing BR and the children of the forest when they try to destroy him/harness his powers. He's gonna pull some Vulcan mind meld and just start stealing their consciousnesses or use them as his own vessels.   I think Bran will be a story about a descent into madness and corruption with him twisting the morals of a Knight to fit his actions. Bran is the only character who has had a relatively safe journey and sort of a mystical positive experience. He's being given tons of power and influence as a mere child. I was thinking it might be an example of absolute power corrupts absolutely but I think that's too clichéd for GRRM. Maybe Bran will end up destroying himself or the tree will override him. Maybe BR is using him to resurrect some kind of ice dragon or ice demon. I just have a feeling Bran is very very doomed.
pureasoiaf,3d9ey3,SSWBGUY,2,Wed Jul 15 01:58:11 2015 UTC,"Mel's vision per se seems accurate.  It matchs Bran and Bloodraven. The interpretation? Depends upon who your enemy is and what is meant by a servant. A servant may, or may not be, willing, able, and loyal.  Dobby tried to help Harry Potter even before he was freed. Varys served Aerys II and made him totally paranoid.  And sometimes enemies decide their enemies aren't who they had thought."
pureasoiaf,3d9ey3,dallasdarling,2,Wed Jul 15 02:16:21 2015 UTC,"Mel sees important visions, but is wrong when interpreting them a lot. Just like Ghost and the other wolves, i think summer is properly named for Bran. He'll play a huge role in bringing peace, but it will be a dark winter. I can't wait to read what BR and the children are up to. They might be manipulative and have a plan that doesn't have the human best interest at heart, but the little, broken kid needs to be the hero (as cliche as that sounds)."

But she doesn't even understand the things she predicts/sees.  I don't think R'hllor exists at all and I think Lady M misinterprets everything (or 99%) of what she sees.  You can't really take anything away from her visions since they're so fickle, which is the whole point.  GRRM gives us a hint as to what's happening but not enough that we can interpret anything from the hint.  I am very confident that Bran/Jojen/Meera are not being manipulated for evil purposes.  They are a relatively large group of the relatively small group of so far, purely kind/decent people in the series.  It is a GRRM thing to tear our heart out and flip everything around on us, but it would feel like a gimmick at this point.  He can't keep playing the same card and expecting the reader to go along with him.  (major plot twists seemingly out of nowhere have killed Robert, Eddard, Renly, Joffrey, maybe you could include Shae/Tywin, in this group but they kind of had it coming, and most notably Jon Snow)  If GRRM kills/maims/incapacitates every character we care about, the readers will be very unsatisfied by how the story ends.  No one wants to read a book series in which you grow attached to a large cast of characters and then they're all systematically killed off/rendered unable to thrive.  I think Bran has received as much backstory as any other character, possibly even more than any other, so far in the series, and I think he has the most potential to change things in a big way, aside from maybe Daenerys.  All that being said, this story has basically gone like this.  Things are okay.  Then they got worse, and worse, and worse, and worse, etc.  They have to get better some time or the story is going to get boring.  It would be pretty ironic if the story suddenly started to improve just as winter comes.  We've been hearing how terrible winter is for like 20 years now, and it would be a GRRM to flip it upside down and improve everyone's situation now that the dreaded winter has arrived.  I think Bran's story is going to get REALLY interesting after the bombshells that were dropped on us in the last couple Bran chapters we've read, and hopefully his/their/the realm's situation will start to improve.  I don't know if I can handle much more bad news."

The circumstances of Rhaegar’s death are known: he didn’t disappear or anything, he was killed with many witnesses. Mance’s backstory is also known: he didn’t come out of nowhere, he was taken by the Watch as a child and raised with them. Both their appearances are known, and they do not match.  The part about the cloak looks like a great leap of logic to me. A shadowcat is not a lion, it definitely isn’t a golden lion, the context where it appears has nothing to do with sigils, and the cloak it tore wasn’t even red at that point. Well, I guess you can see the Lannister sigil somewhere in there, but in this case you can as well pull it out of thin air.  If I wanted to use the cloak as an evidence that Mance is Rhaegar, I’d skip the whole Lannister part and just point out that red and black are Targaryen colors."

pureasoiaf,3d9my8,Ramstepp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:21:11 2015 UTC,"Dalla fits better, I think. But if it was one of them, Mance probably would’ve mentioned it, so I think it was an unrelated random woman.  Edit: Checked the text.   “You will have heard stories of my desertion, I have no doubt.”  “Some say it was for a crown. Some say for a woman. Others that you had the wildling blood.”  “The wildling blood is the blood of the First Men, the same blood that flows in the veins of the Starks. As to a crown, do you see one?”  “I see a woman.” He glanced at Dalla.  Mance took her by the hand and pulled her close. “My lady is blameless. I met her on my return from your father’s castle. The Halfhand was carved of old oak, but I am made of flesh, and I have a great fondness for the charms of women . . . which makes me no different from three-quarters of the Watch. There are men still wearing black who have had ten times as many women as this poor king. You must guess again, Jon Snow.”   So, (1) definitely not Dalla, unless Mance is lying, and (2) he only met her very recently. He could, of course, have known Val all along without ever meeting her sister, but I find it rather unlikely. Unrelated woman, then."

Well with the glamor he could have taken someones place like some people think he will with Ramsay.    The part about the cloak looks like a great leap of logic to me.   Well the cloak i a symbol of marriage in Westeros, and Rhaegar has lost the three people from his marriage to the red Lannisters.    A shadowcat is not a lion, it definitely isn’t a golden lion,   Yes but if you tell a hidden story you can't put a lion beyond the wall.    where it appears has nothing to do with sigils   Well do Tormonds storys? You can always use a animal as a sigil for a family, thats how these stories work. Anytime GRRM mentions an animal it could be a sigil. Like Tormond bear story, or his giants babe story.    and the cloak it tore wasn’t even red at that point.   No not at that point, but when the rips were done they were filled with red, pointing to the Lannisters."

He was in heavy armor for one and would sink but where they fought it couldn't have been swift or deep water. Also they burned his body so it was recovered.   This is a story about how Mance as a Crow was chaffing at the uniformity of the Watch and about how well the Wildlings, who are made out to be savages, are in fact generous by using something she prized just to repair a rent cloak and how the other brothers turned their nose up at the gesture, or didn't even see it to begin with.

Robert would not seem like the kind of guy who would give his arch nemesis a proper burial.   There are no important ports that far north on the western side of Westeros, nor anyone rich enough for such luxury goods like scarlet silk from Assahi.

pureasoiaf,3d9my8,TNMike875,2,Wed Jul 15 08:36:51 2015 UTC,"GRRM himself has said that Rhaegar was cremated. You can Google it for a source or look on asoiaf.westeros.org when it comes back on-line. Given Roberts hatred of Targs do you think he'd just let Rhaegars body just wash away in the water, not even taking into account that if they were standing in the ford fighting than the current can't be strong enough to move a corpse? Also I looked up the elder brothers quote and it's fishy because he says ""The Elder Brother told me I had washed up on the tide, naked as my name day."" (Brienne VI, AFFC. So he wasn't wearing armor when he went in for whatever reason. Maybe he was knocked out and someone stripped him of armor before rolling his body into the water.

The trees remember, but men forget, and so now they write the messages on parchment and tie them round the feet of birds who have never shared their skin.”   Thousands of ravens... and ""all"" have singers in them.

pureasoiaf,3cyda7,MattyOlyOi,2,Sat Jul 11 23:22:08 2015 UTC,"I meant to reference Summer with Bran but wrote Shaggy Dog on accident. But yeah, still the same idea. It always kills me when the close characters have near misses to reunite."
pureasoiaf,3cyda7,SuchADolorousFellow,7,Sat Jul 11 23:27:52 2015 UTC,"For Ned and Lyanna - I believe GRRM himself said that all of Ned's children are wargs with varying skill. However, Ned has not shown any signs of warging to an animal and besides Lyanna's superb horseriding, there are no other signs."
pureasoiaf,3cyda7,tranquilsparrow,4,Sun Jul 12 02:12:25 2015 UTC,I'm going to hold out hope for Lyanna. It seems like there would be more to her character beyond R+L=J and the mystery knight theories. She has a statue in the crypts after all.
pureasoiaf,3cu8zc,Gingerninja04,31,Fri Jul 10 20:43:07 2015 UTC,"It could go either way, really. If the reader is thinking that Jon is Ned's bastard, then they'd probably interpret that as Ned reflecting on his own past lust. If R+L=J is correct, then it's more that thinking of bastards and their hardships leads him to think of the bastard he calls 'son' and R's lust. After all, if R+L=J, then Eddard is well versed in the difficulties caused by that lust."
pureasoiaf,3cu8zc,kalg,5,Fri Jul 10 21:04:15 2015 UTC,Yeah I can see this as being right. If Jon is R's son then we can see the hardships of Ned having to keep this a secret. Not only does it sort of ruin is honour (which we know is extremely important to Ned) it can also be seen as hard for him having to raise a son that looks so much like him but he knows isn't his and was brought about on another mans lusts. Of course Jon would be true born if his is in fact R's Son and not a bastard at all
pureasoiaf,3cu8zc,kalg,6,Fri Jul 10 21:11:50 2015 UTC,"Of course Jon would be true born if his is in fact R's Son and not a bastard at all   If R&L married* and Jon's legit, this still works. 'Look at this unfortunate bastard' leads to thinking of the nephew everyone believes is my bastard. Heck, he could be having two parallel thoughts, one about Jon and the crippling effect of being a 'bastard', and the other about Robert and the other men he knows who've been consumed by lust and fathered children outside of marriage.  *Do we know if legitimacy mattered to R or simply creating the 'right' baby? Jon could still be a bastard."
pureasoiaf,3cu8zc,kalg,3,Fri Jul 10 21:19:32 2015 UTC,I like what you are saying here.  I think that R would care if he believed this whole ice and fire prophecy. I believe he would have married L so that his child would be in line for the throne as the child of ice and fire
pureasoiaf,3cu8zc,psythedude,3,Fri Jul 10 21:37:23 2015 UTC,"I can see them wanting to be married. I can see them trying to marry. But I would not be surprised if they didn't, either. Who married them? What septon is keeping that secret? How official was polygamy with Targaryens at the time? Would Elia still, you know, existing have been a problem?  I feel like Rhaegar would have been more concerned with getting the 'third head' for his dragon than he would have been in having a child who could inherit the throne. Especially since he thought his first two children were heads one and two, he may not have been concerned if head three couldn't be king.  They absolutely could have married. But they might not have. I don't think the clues we have point to a legitimate offspring, just so long as the kid was a FireIce creation. :P  On the other hand, I'm sure a lot of readers would be really satisfied to have Jon find out that he wasn't a bastard after all. It might be more important plot-wise than it is in Westeros."
pureasoiaf,3cu8zc,kalg,2,Fri Jul 10 22:55:35 2015 UTC,"I think Elia still existing wouldn't be a problem, as Rhaegar could just marry her and be married to two people at once, Conqueror style. The problem would be finding someone to perform the marriage."
pureasoiaf,3cu8zc,MSTRKRFTDNNR,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:02:12 2015 UTC,"Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, do they need to married for Jon to be legitimate? Could Rhaegar have simply declared him legit? ""And my natural son, Xxxx Snow, is hereby Xxxx Targaryen and heir after my trueborn children..."" Rhaeg was planning on being king, so it wouldn't have been much of a problem. Now, if he didn't write something up before the Trident, Jon is still SOL.  It's always possible Ned interred a marriage certificate along with Lyanna, too."
pureasoiaf,3cu8zc,IllusiveSelf,3,Sat Jul 11 11:17:56 2015 UTC,Would be funny if there were declarations from two different kings declaring Jon as trueborn heirs (by Rhaegar and Robb) floating around out there.

First of all that passage could be a red herring in it's own right, but more importantly the face of Ned's nephew could resemble him just as easily. Remember, Jon and Arya look a lot of alike and Arya supposedly resembles Lyanna closely."
pureasoiaf,3cu8zc,NZ_MPS,6,Fri Jul 10 20:57:11 2015 UTC,Yeah I can see this being right and I can also see it being a red herring. I guess the most solid piece of evidence here is Ned talking about the Lusts of men. I take this as him admitting to him being sexual attracted to another women aside for Cat.
pureasoiaf,3cu8zc,wap1971,18,Fri Jul 10 21:07:20 2015 UTC,"But lusts of men could also refer to what he thinks is the lust of Rhaegar, not necessarily knowing his ulterior motives based in prophecy and such."
pureasoiaf,3cu8zc,sebitapincha,3,Fri Jul 10 22:42:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I think he could be referring to the lusts of men because that was what started the rebellion and the product of that lust was Jon"

I am more inclined to think him recognising his face in Jon's is because he's still a Stark, and they have fairly distinctive features (Benjen also shares similarities).

pureasoiaf,3cu8zc,Qolx,2,Sat Jul 11 00:21:58 2015 UTC,"As Ned holds Robert's bastard in the brothel he starts to think of Rhaegar ""for the first time in years"", and then when he leaves he starts thinking of Jon. Strong evidence in favor of r+l=j. And the lust he speaks of could just be Rhaegars instead of his own."
pureasoiaf,3cu8zc,sebitapincha,2,Sat Jul 11 21:49:35 2015 UTC,"I honestly think it can be interpreted either way, the only thing I got out of that passage is that Ned perhaps believed Jon was born because of lust, if it was Ned or Rhaegar's lust, it's unclear. So I don't think it confirms or denies parentage. Sorry for the cop-out answer."
pureasoiaf,3cu8zc,sebitapincha,2,Sat Jul 11 22:34:04 2015 UTC,"I feel Ned is indeed Jon's father, Ashara Dayne being the mother. Rhaegar was naming his children after the first Targaryen conquerors (Rhaenys, Aegon) and expected a third; my suspicion is that Raeghar and Lyanna had a daughter named Visenya that Howland Reed spirited away to the Neck.   I just don't see the appeal of Rhaegar and Lyanna being Jon Snow's parents.  Edit: name switcheroo"
pureasoiaf,3cu8zc,MarshmeloAnthony,10,Fri Jul 10 21:47:11 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think the evidence for R+L=J is overwhelming.  Rhaegar and Lyanna probably had a different name for Jon, it seems clear to me that Ned chose that name in honor of Jon Arryn, though I might be wrong.  I think the idea that R&L had a daughter that was taken by Howland Reed is kind of ridiculous. What would be Ned's promise to Lyanna, then? ""Please Ned, promise me you'll give my daughter to that guy I helped at the Tourney of Harrenhall"". It doesn't feel right, Ned taking the child and raising him himself makes more sense to me.  Also, for N+A=J to work you need to have Ashara meet Ned in the middle of the war in order to conceive in time for Jon to be picked up by Ned afterwards, which is possible but unlikely and we have no evidence that this happened. You would think that Ned being visited by a noblewoman would be noticed by someone in their army, even if you try do it in secret. Brandon Stark seems to have been closer to Ashara than Ned, or at least that's what I thought when I read the Tourney of Harrenhal story.  Maybe you don't see the appeal and that's fine, but it's not an arguement against R+L=J."

That can mean anything why would Ned be so serious when she is mentioned   Here's the quote from AGoT:   That was the only time in all their years that Ned had ever frightened her. “Never ask me about Jon,” he said, cold as ice. “He is my blood, and that is all you need to know. And now I will learn where you heard that name, my lady.” She had pledged to obey; she told him; and from that day on, the whispering had stopped, and Ashara Dayne’s name was never heard in Winterfell again.   Ned seems more concerned about people talking about Jon than about Ashara herself. He doesn't want anyone to think much about Jon's origins. Some people even say that he did that on purpose so that people think Jon's mother is actually Ashara and don't question it further."

That's a bit of a stretch, but I agree that Ned's concern was with inquiries about Jon. He didn't say not to ask about Ashara, he said not to ask about Jon. The context of the outburst was that people thought Ashara was Jon's real mother, and he wanted the guessing to stop, because it might lead to the correct answer."
pureasoiaf,3cu8zc,sebitapincha,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:13:29 2015 UTC,"That's hardly a stretch, its a rumour that had been circulating and naturally the woman that was able to make Ned fucking Stark break his wedding vows (a point that baffles even his ""brother"" Bobby B), would be a point of much conversation around the castle.

pureasoiaf,3cu8zc,Traffalger,2,Mon Jul 13 12:07:53 2015 UTC,Yeah it could be one of GRRM's mistakes. If it is its one of the biggest mistakes ever. The whole Jon being a hero to all doesn't appeal to me. I don't wish him to be R'hllor in human form or azor ahi. I just want him to be the commander of the nights watch a near forgotten branch of once well respected warriors. Well I guess wanted now. I will be happy if he is not reborn and this is the end.

The other real option to me is that he becomes a sort of monster and Robb's letter legitimizes him, and he takes over the North and makes the Boltons look like good guys.  I also like to think he's Ned's son but I have no real opinion other than how I fucking hate when people claim the theory is a hundred percent true and it can't be anything else.

pureasoiaf,3cu8zc,MarshmeloAnthony,2,Fri Jul 10 23:11:45 2015 UTC,"You're right, it's not canon. GRRM might have a grand plan that fits all the evidence better than R+L=J and it will be the best red herring in history. However, this is highly unlikely. AGoT has been out for almost 2 decades. People have discussed R+L=J since nearly the beginning. The R+L=J thread on Westeros.org has reached like v.150 or something. No one has come up with anything to bring this theory down, nor with a better one. I think at this point, it is as close as canon as you can get, and there is not much hope for R+L=/=J."

You just can't know another person well enough in such a short amount of time. Understanding the difference between love and lust is intrinsic to a healthy and positive emotional relationship.  People are invariably diverse and have layers of depth. Add in to that the more mundane, secrets or regrets or whatever, and you'll quickly realize that unless you spend a massive amount of time, and I mean quite literally 24/7 being inseparable for quite a while, you'll never know the person you think you 'love' and thus never know if you really love them at all.  tl;dr - Chemicals in our brain make us feel good, but years of companionship allows you to love."

I was suggesting that that feeling is not necessarily entirely voluntary and therefore Tyrion isn't deliberately ""setting himself up with a weakness"" as OP is suggesting.   Whether or not he is wise to feel that way or whether he is 'truly' in love is basically irrelevant. And, in any case Tyrion has been so obviously starved of any affection that he both wants to and might genuinely believe there is mutual love. You can, of course, only really say that you love someone in the way you're suggesting if you have been through a long term experience like that (either in a sexual relationship or otherwise) and have a short-term ""lust"" to compare it to. Tyrion only has the latter (Tysha) so it makes sense he might genuinely believe he's in love."

No secrets here, he's an emotional cripple when it comes to relationships, and she's a manipulative whore looking out for dem shinies."
pureasoiaf,3cfgmt,CaptainCummings,2,Wed Jul 8 17:58:14 2015 UTC,"You didn't understand? Basically it summed up to say that just because he wasn't in what you believe to be 'real love' doesn't preclude the possibility that he felt he was in love.

pureasoiaf,3cfgmt,DorianRed,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:56:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I was saying with my initial comment too really. He lusted after her because he's an emotional cripple in terms of relationships, and was not really trying to fry himself. He's literally too dumb to know how to love. No one is too dumb to be blinded by lust, and I don't just mean physiological arousal."
pureasoiaf,3cfgmt,CaptainCummings,2,Wed Jul 8 20:30:27 2015 UTC,"I up-voted you just for the sake of positing my differing opinion. I hear what you're saying, but you're completely wrong.  Love isn't calculated. Love isn't planned. Love is never what you want it to be, but Love is always greater than you could have imagined. Tyrion is in Love with Shae at this point; and that means forsaking everything in the hopes of feeling the way he does when he is with her forever. Any risk for that reward is worth it to him. And shouldn't it be to us all? I always liked this storyline because Martin presents a character with every reason to ""find another girl"" but illustrates what Love does to Us--makes Us stronger through weakness."
pureasoiaf,3cfgmt,tranquilsparrow,2,Sun Jul 12 12:03:48 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the differing viewpoint, but I feel that is highly irresponsible, ignores some basic biochemical reactions, and conflates lust with love.  What, exactly, does he love about her? She isn't witty, the only things that she really does is call him pet names and fuck him. There's nothing there to love, there's quite a bit for an emotionally stunted individual with no positive relationship experience who is also prone to being used to lust after though."
pureasoiaf,3cfgmt,CaptainCummings,11,Sun Jul 12 20:53:10 2015 UTC,"She was a camp follower, that's where she came from. She's good in bed and makes Tyroin feel better about himself, so he liked her.

pureasoiaf,3cfgmt,GooglePerkins,21,Tue Jul 7 14:48:59 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty simplistic reading of their relationship.  I don't want to spoil anything, but there's still a lot about Shae and her history that we don't know.  Tyrion is desperate to be loved. He looks for it in family and women,  and because of his looks he generally has to pay the women. His experience with his first love and what Tywin did to them haunts him his whole life. He's found someone in Shae who is kind to him,  a good match for his wits, and makes him happy. These reasons,  and defying Tywin, are more than enough reason for Tyrion to keep Shae with him."

Not saying it's not possible that it's Ramsay, because it definitely is, it's just that this is not good evidence to support that claim."
pureasoiaf,3cc5ea,johnbr,6,Mon Jul 6 19:45:14 2015 UTC,"but when Melisandre sees Jon Snow   She does not see Jon Snow, she just sees Snow. Tommon is not the real king, so Ramsays legitimization would not count. So he still is a snow.    why would you think that would tell her to find someone she's never met   Well, most of the prophecies she receives are mostly useless to her. Renly smashing Stannis did happen anyway, for example. I can't find it right now, but at some point she even thinks, or says that the visions she receives can be changed because otherwise the would not be useful. This kind of hint to me that most of her visions are not that useful and can not be changed anyway.    it's just that this is not good evidence to support that claim.   Well I try not to be too selective. It is a hint at who is Azor Ahai, and it fits him just as well as Jon, but much better than Dany or Jora or Victarion or Stannis or who ever else is proposed. So I would say it does give him a leg up over anyone except Jon Snow"
pureasoiaf,3cc5ea,johnbr,6,Mon Jul 6 20:06:19 2015 UTC,"She sees Snow with a capital S.  I.e. a person.  Clearly, given that she's met Jon Snow, and we are not aware of any other Snows that she's met, that means Jon Snow.  If she saw Ramsay, whom she's never met, she wouldn't be able to recognize him.    It would be insanely bad writing if George meant Ramsay in that context.  If George meant Ramsay, she should see something else - a bloody man or some other reference to the Boltons."
pureasoiaf,3cc5ea,LawrenciuM94,3,Mon Jul 6 20:15:21 2015 UTC,"I pray for a glimpse of Azor Ahai, and R'hllor shows me only Snow.   I read the books in German where snow is spelled capital no matter what. But regardless, that is a incredible strange way to reefer to Jon Snow. If she saw him, as him, a dude standing there, why does she not think ""Jon Snow""? Like she does here:   A thousand skulls, and the bastard boy again. Jon Snow.    Or here:    The flames crackled softly, and in their crackling she heard the whispered name Jon Snow.   or here:   Jon Snow would expect that of her, and soon   Or here:   It was Jon Snow she needed, not fried bread and bacon   Or at least as Lord Snow like here:   And Lord Snow's rangers will return    Or here:   A girl in grey on a dying horse. Jon Snow's sister   Or here:    Lord Snow will have to listen to me now.   Other people refer to him just as Snow, but she never does. I think it was intentionally left vague, by GRRM, but also in universe probably by the person sending here those visions (I think she gets manipulated by someone). Spelling it capital S was maybe meant for us, to point us at Jon, while we not see the second possible interpretation. Like we see not that the perfumed seneschal could as so be satin and not just Reznak. We don't know exactly how she sees things that appear to her in here flames, but maybe she just sees snow, and interprets that as Jon Snow. Maybe she sees a silhouette of a man made of snow, or something like that, but the wording of that sentence is strange no matter what since she always refers to him as Jon/Lord Snow any other time. We don't exactly know how those things in the fires display, I am guessing it is not 1080p video.    If George meant Ramsay   Well, GRRM often does not want us to know who is meant, that is probably why he wrote so many characters fitting the clues to AA, but none (but Ramsay) all  But thanks for pointing that out anyway"
pureasoiaf,3cc5ea,LawrenciuM94,3,Mon Jul 6 20:39:39 2015 UTC,"I think she means that she saw a vision of snow falling in the flames which she interpreted as Snow. It just sounds much more poetic than   I pray for a glimpse of Azor Ahai, and R'hllor shows me only Jon Snow.    GRRM knew people would pick up on this line as important and I'd wager he just wanted to write it elegantly. It also isn't really fitting to just write prophecy so plainly and bluntly. I'm surprised he even made it as blunt as he did by capitalising the S. Prophecy should be shrouded in a little mystery. Maybe you're right and it does mean RS and that's the mystery GRRM was going for but I don't think it's too likely since Ramsay doesn't fit the other signs/clues we've been given about AA."
pureasoiaf,3cc5ea,LawrenciuM94,2,Mon Jul 6 21:25:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe you're right and it does mean RS   I think he just creates a few characters that fit the prophecy, and in the end we will have no one who clearly is it. Dany will be a good candidate, Jon will, but I don't think anyone will draw a flaming sword.    since Ramsay doesn't fit the other signs/clues we've been given about AA.   Well... I think he does scary well. I think I showed the rebirth amidst salt and smoke under the red comet quite well, and the Dragons from stone at least in a figurative way, if the    great winged snake whose roar was a river of flame.   was not an actual dragon, but Summers interpretation of Winterfell burning."
pureasoiaf,3cc5ea,Gigglestomp123,3,Mon Jul 6 21:51:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think the signs you pointed out he fits reasonably well, but he doesn't have the bloodline that the Ghost of High Heart pointed out nor has he made a personal sacrifice nor does he have any sort of special sword/weapon. Some of these could be solved in time but I feel like Dany and Jon fit it much better with the information we have now. I wouldn't like it if all the missing signs suddenly become fulfilled by a random character in the last book, I feel it's better if it's someone that had the signs all along but it just wasn't made obvious until the end.   great winged snake whose roar was a river of flame   To be honest, I don't really see how this is not a dragon. You could interpret it as Winterfell burning but Summer doesn't see things THAT weirdly, he may describe swords as silver claws but he knows what Winterfell looks like. Which brings up so many questions. Why didn't Bran bring it up? How did a dragon appear there with the ability to fly and breathe flame?(it couldn't have been a hatchling) Where did it go?

I do think the two are the same but maybe, ""having the blood of Aerys and Rhaella could also mean just having the blood of one of their children, like on your sword. Maybe Ramsay will kill Jon and by that way fulfill that prophecy. I know, not likely but if you want to make him fit it (like I do) that would do. I should probably mention, that I not really think that he will be some kind of savior, just a way for GRRM to fuck around with prophecy.    nor has he made a personal sacrifice   Well he did ""sacrifice"" his Reek ;) he got another one, but sill.    nor does he have any sort of special sword/weapon.    Well, neither has Jon. Dany has her Dragons, but Jon has just his Valyrian stell sword, which many people have.    but I feel like Dany and Jon fit it much better with the information we have now.   Definitely, but that was not my point.    Now will Ramsay be revealed as Azor Ahai in the end? Well, will anyone?    This is my last sentence in the post. My point overall is, that other characters fit the prophecy very well too, so maybe it does not mean that much, and AA will never be revealed. After it is all said and done, no one will have drawn a flaming sword, and no one person will have lead the fight against the Others. Many people will have fit the prophecy and we will be able to see the Dragons, or the NW or what ever as a flaming sword. I should clarify my stands on the theory in to OP.    To be honest, I don't really see how this is not a dragon. You could interpret it as Winterfell burning but Summer doesn't see things THAT weirdly, he may describe swords as silver claws but he knows what Winterfell looks like.

Maybe, I don't think any of us really have much information how that's going to pan out but your way is definitely possible and it's the most ""realistic"" which is the way that GRRM prefers to write. He doesn't want to make it all fairytale heroes and happy endings.  Personally I think Jon and Dany are both AA, perhaps Dany's other two dragonriders will be too, but it will never be explicitly stated. I think they'll lead the fight against the Others but it won't be a happy ending. I don't think it will be a negative ending with the Others winning either, it will be nice and grey just how GRRM likes it.   This could be checkoffs dragon, and we all ignore it.

It's weird that GRRM is being so heavy-handed with this with Mel proclaiming Jon as AA and Benerro proclaiming Dany. It was already relatively obvious that they were important given the title of the series so I guess it's just to show the motivations for Mel reviving Jon and the Red Faith sending help to Dany?

pureasoiaf,3cc5ea,MarshmeloAnthony,2,Tue Jul 7 11:17:16 2015 UTC,"Tommen is not the real King   The concept of a ""king"" is just a social construct created by the subconscious need to be told what to do. There is no such thing as an ""illegitimate"" leader or king, because it is a de facto thing. The fact that half of Westeros follows Tommen is what makes him a king, especially since the other half has yet to produce an actual leader. Dany styles herself the Queen of Westeros, but nobody in Westeros actually follows her, so it is she that is not a true queen in Westeros. Stannis calls himself king, but his supporters are few, and they're either spread thin and not combat-capable, or starving out in a blizzard, so it is he that is not a true king of Westeros. Thus one could counterclaim that Tommen is the only true king in Westeros, as he is the only ""king"" with significant support from the people.   However, one could just as easily claim that the kings we see are figureheads, and the real ""kings"" are the ones who manipulate the kings - Varys, Petyr Baelish, and the late Tywin Lannister, for example. However, Tywin is dead, Varys has fled, and Baelish is off in the Vale attempting to garner support. While Varys and Baelish are both in position to soon hold significant power, neither of them currently do, because neither of them are in places where they can directly manipulate Westerosi politics, all they can do is sit back and observe the long term results of their previous actions. If anything screws up their plans, it would become much more difficult for either to assume control of the realm.   Thus, I claim that there is no true king, and there never will be, because it is extremely unlikely that anybody who takes power will both have the support of the people, and also not be a figurehead himself, manipulated by another. And it is even less likely that such a person would survive for any extended period of time, as such a person would no doubt become a target for others seeking to assume power.    TL;DR Either read my whole comment or ignore it entirely, there is no middle ground, because if it's even possible to condense what I wrote into a few short sentences, I surely am not capable of doing so."

Tommon not being king, and so Ramsay still being a Snow, lyes in the eyes of the beholder. Mel is in Stannises camp, she believes that Stannis is the rightful king, so in her eyes Ramsay would still be a Snow.   Your view point comes from our world, where you are of course right. But in asoiaf, we see that there is some power in some bloodlines, like the Targs and their connection to Dragons. We have yet to see whether ""kings blood"" holds power, like when Kahl Drogo gets burned, whether that would have worked with some normal dude as well. If it holds power, we have yet to see why. Does at one time being a king, meaning not answering to a person above you, or having many people see you a such, give you descendants blood some kind of power? We don't know what the rules are in asoiaf so who is king, or if there is a king is a question that we can not answer yet, especially not in the rational real world way you are doing."

The smoke and ash clouded his eyes, and in the sky he saw a great winged snake whose roar was a river of flame. He bared his teeth, but then the snake was gone.   A ""great winged snake whose roar was a river of flame"" is a Dragon in my book, and none of the others ever did that. Davos had a rebirth admits salt and smoke under the red comet, but he did not wake any Dragons. Tyrion had two near death experiences, but I think they are harder to see as rebirths.

pureasoiaf,3c9auv,InUrFridge,2,Mon Jul 6 14:05:26 2015 UTC,Don't read The world of Ice and Fire before the main novels. Even in the first few pages you will have a few spoilers.
pureasoiaf,3cbspa,Saroekin,16,Mon Jul 6 18:09:16 2015 UTC,"Probably none of those, as those are generally used as methods of documenting sources of information in research papers.

pureasoiaf,3cbspa,Adelaidey,5,Mon Jul 6 21:59:38 2015 UTC,"Do you think GRRM, or other authors, may have a custom style guide? I mean, there are certain things he just has to decide on and keep consistent through his writing. Like, is he going to write ""color"" or ""colour"", or is he going to use semicolons, or does he think semicolons seem out of place in his books. And then there's the big stuff, like what tense he is writing in, and what perspective does the narrator have.  I've always thought that if I were to write a novel, I would write out my decisions on stuff like that."
pureasoiaf,3cbspa,OfficialCocaColaAMA,2,Mon Jul 6 23:07:09 2015 UTC,"My books were all spelled in the American style, even though I bought them in the UK (some on Kindle though so not sure how they work). So this probably reflected how he wrote them naturally rather than a thought-out process (color vs colour).  I imagine he uses spellings and grammar he feels most comfortable with and as is appropriate to the context of the story. Obviously he has thought about the perspective of the narrator, but once he's done that, I don't think it'll be on the top of his concerns.  Basically, some of what you said (perspective of narration mainly) will have been carefully thought out at the beginning (though maybe he just plunged in) and the rest is most likely what he, as a writer, is most comfortable with.  Some may disagree, but from how I remember it, GRRM isn't one to experiment with style of language or use the grammar for particular effects and the good writing was in the descriptions and the characterisation."

Mirri is unrelated, though: the sun rises in the east no matter how many times you cross the globe.   Well, I still think this is a matter of perception. The main continent in ASOIAF is called Westeros after all and in a globe by travelling always eastward we can arrive to a place we consider to be The West...

He's still alive only by sheer luck.  All of Westeros and Essos has shit on Tyrion Lannister, and they did not shit gold, but somehow, the dude is still alive.  Think about it.  Some random sellsword defeated Vardis Egan.  He somehow survived the mountain clans and even recruited them to fight for him.  Survived a very near miss at the Blackwater, though sans nose.  Sentenced to death for a crime he didn't commit, but somehow, he was broken out of prison, after he magically found a champion, the champion magically bested his opponent, and he magically stopped paying attention before he finished the deed and ended up dead instead.  Fell in greyscale-infested waters; got pulled out unscathed -- but JonCon got the greyscale!  Captured by Jorah.  Captured by slavers.  Not killed by said slavers.  Scheduled to fight against actual lions.  Saved by Daenerys somehow finding out that some mummers were going to get mauled by wild animals and putting a stop to it.  That's not even all of his close calls.  How the fuck is Tyrion Lannister still alive?  +10 Mithril Plot Armor.  But other characters don't usually wear it.  Robb Stark didn't put it on at the Red Wedding (Roose Bolton sure did).  Ned forgot his Plot Collar when he faced Ilyn Payne in King's Landing.  Robert Baratheon got so fat that his plot armor no longer fit.  Those guys just weren't wearing any.  And neither was Jon Snow.  Here's the thing.  The best parallel here is Robb.  We, the readers, had big dreams of what Robb was going to do.  The chapter before the Red Wedding, he's planning all this stuff.  Legitimizing Jon.  Sending some interesting strategic and tactical plans over to the Neck.  This was going to be a pretty cool campaign, and Robb was going to win the North.  What we weren't thinking was that Robb and all of his Northern army that we'd spent so much time with were going to fucking DIE.  So now we have to deal with the aftermath.  This is GRRM's modus.  A death at the end of an arc is a meaningless death.  Death is only real when there's so much life left.  If the outcome was never actually in doubt, what do you care, as a reader?  When a character dies in an unfinished arc, well, now it's personal.  You were invested in the character.  THAT SAID, Jon Snow has 100% warged into Ghost.  That Varamyr prologue was crystal clear on this subject.  I'm not sure if he'll get revived in human form or not -- Melisandre may or may not be able to perform the same ritual that Thoros can do -- so he may or may not actually come back.  But think about how fucked everyone is if he doesn't come back.  That's GRRM raising the stakes.  No plot armor there."
pureasoiaf,3bzc8j,xiipaoc,3,Sat Jul 4 04:52:36 2015 UTC,"My theory is that chaos erupts at the Wall after Jon is murdered, with basically Tormund, Wun Wun, any Jon-loyalists, and the wildlings fighting the Watch and the Queen's Men.    Jon's body is trampled, crushed, destroyed or even just missing.   Ghost runs off, of course, and so does Mel.  Mel and Ghost meet later, shortly before or after Stannis dies.   Mel works some sort of magic so that Jon's soul goes in to Stannis' body.    All the visions Melisandre had of Stannis being Azor Ahai were true, it was just Jon's soul in them.   Melisandre herself says that her visions have never been wrong, only she has sometimes interpreted them wrongly.    It works, too, with Dany's HotU visions of Stannis, a blue-eyed king wielding a flaming sword who cast no shadow.   I originally though that simply referred to the shadow-baby, and it might in part, but it would make as much sense that the vision meant he was a husk with someone else's soul and mind animating him."

People changing their faces is almost a big a theme of the books as is resurrection. On the Wall we have one of the biggest users of this in Melisandre (Who hasn't resurrected anyone yet I might add, can she? We don't know.) who had demonstrated it with both Rattleshirt and Mance.   Is that even Jon who got stabbed? I don't think so. That rabble rousing speech he gives does not feel like Jon to me.

Elsewhere in the books when WW have contact with humans, they basically just kill them right away. But apparently not Crastor's sons. We don't know where the first WWs might have come from.

pureasoiaf,3c2lj4,SSWBGUY,2,Fri Jul 10 13:35:21 2015 UTC,"Maybe they take the babies because babies dont fight back, i know its only implied but if you had to choose (to turn into a WW) between an adult that knows what you are (terrifying) and will do anything to get away from/kill you or a baby who cant do anything but look at you then youd choose the baby every time.  Also from what Lord Commander Mormont says about Craster serving fouler Gods or something it falls in line with the thinking.  We may never know for sure but It makes sense that Crasters ability to exist without Mance and his keep not seeming to be worried about WW combined with the ""his brothers"" and fouler gods ""black blood/cursed"" comments it adds up to him somehow being in league with the WW. I like what someone else mentioned about maybe Craster is descended from The Nights King, hadnt thought of that before, his blood certainly would be tainted if that was the case, also add in that all his spawn are products of incest with incest with more incest means their blood (the baby boys) is even more tainted.  I dont think there is a difference between The Others and White Walkers. I think the old stories where they are referred to the as The Others are because they are old stories and a lot of people dont believe them to actually be real  (just stories to tell children) because the long night was so long ago. Its referenced in the text numerous times throughout the series that much has been forgotten south of the wall over the years.  I think the term White Walkers is how they are described by witnesses (They are white and walk) and may be New to westeros being that The Others havent been seen in a very long time. Not sure if the are human hybrids or variations or just another race like The COF/Giants.  Edit: forgot an is and added last paragraph"
pureasoiaf,3c2lj4,SSWBGUY,2,Tue Jul 14 00:26:11 2015 UTC,"Touche on the choice between babies and adults.   I did reread the reference about his blood being black and him bearing a heavy curse after an earlier comment. There is also a description of sacrifices apparently being made directly into a weirwood trunk by Wildlings in the village of Whitetree.  These two examples are both fixed locations with buildings, i.e. settlements. Mance's people seem nomadic. Maybe it's associated with building and settling land? First read through the books, I hadn't given the much credibility to blood magic, not being very magical myself. But, when you think of it literally, there are several instances where a case could be made for a curse that is tied to bloodlines for generations ad infinitum.  And Mormont's words might have a literal meaning.  If blood sacrifice is required or part of an as yet unspecified agreement, the obvious question is, ""What happens when the sacrifices no longer are offered?""    Thanks for the ideas and feedback."
pureasoiaf,3c2lj4,SSWBGUY,2,Tue Jul 14 05:08:01 2015 UTC,"Blood sacrifice/magic could also imply blood relations, when craster gives the baby boys maybe he is sacrficing his blood or giving up his ""Blood"" for magical purposes, when the wildlings sacrifice to the tree maybe they are offering people related by blood.  Maybe im wrong but it seems ""Blood Magic/Sacrifice"" could mean giving ones relatives up.   The walkers advance seems to have started before Craster bites it tho and we dont know when the last victim may have been given to that tree(or if at all) so I dont think that was part of a broken agreement.  Something triggered the return of winter, the walkers and magic but im not sure what."
pureasoiaf,3c2lj4,Kienn12,2,Tue Jul 14 13:19:05 2015 UTC,"Good point about blood relatives being a greater sacrifice than someone with whom we have no connection.   Totally true that the WWs had appeared before Crastor was wiped out. This is a quick response, no cites at the moment, but, my impression is that Whitetree village didn't have really fresh sacrifices, but that they were not that much in the past either. Throughout the books, there is a feeling that the ""old ways"" that included blood sacrifice are being practiced less and less.  So while I'm not actually proposing that the WW advance has been directly triggered by diminishing blood sacrifices, I'm willing to consider that they may be connected.  And yes, that could simply be because magic is back on the rise (as evidenced by our beloved dragons and glass candles?). Could blood sacrifices seem to be only an archaic tradition when magic is weak and then surprisingly become more necessary when more magic is present?"
pureasoiaf,3c2lj4,Kienn12,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:41:36 2015 UTC,"You may be on to something there, maybe blood magic fuels the fire so to speak?  Im not sure it was ever practiced less tho, parts of the north, the wildlings, and parts of essos never seem to have stopped sacrificing or the blood magic.  It seems these were the some of the few places it may have been practiced at all in the recent past.  I dont know why but Eddard putting the bones of his siblings in the Winterfell crypts means something.  I think its the only example of non lords or kings being placed down there. The Starks are different than most other families (from westeros) along with The Reeds (prob more im forgetting) I suspect it has something to do with the Blood of the first men or possibly the blood of other species (Wargs, COF, Greenseers) as is implied in the text. It gets mentioned multiple times in the series that Ned did something out of the ordinary with their remains by putting them there and its very possible theres something to it. Maybe somehow that broke a pact that awok The Others and magic?  Mel says her powers are stronger at the wall which we know to be magic (via Bran The Builder or The Children or both). Winterfell also possibly being magic for the same reasons as The Wall (Storms End also). So by dirupting the crypts (which is beneath the heart tree) maybe an age old pact was broken and that enhanced magic and in turn The Others. I just thought of all that now so I havent thought it out completely but there is something up with The Winterfell crypts for sure.  Edit:spelling"
pureasoiaf,3c2lj4,JewBot6000,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:41:51 2015 UTC,"Agree with you on much of this. As to whether blood magic used to be practiced more in the North, that is debatable.  But, its geographic range seems to have diminished considerably as it has been associated with worship of the Old Gods whose worship was was adopted by the First Men at the direction of the CotF.  My feeling is that blood sacrifices in recent Westerosi history have been at what we'll call maintenance levels. That equilibrium has now been somehow disrupted.  Crastor was only one part of the larger equation.  The spots for Brandon and Lyanna in the crypt are a definite anomaly and probably significant.  I don't know that they are tied to blood magic or that it broke a pact.   Back to blood magic and equilibrium: Conflicts between choosing what is best for ones self and the greater good, and hard choices between ones own honor or the honor of others are a recurrent theme.  Imagine the bitterness of a sacrifice that is great, unrecognized, and even makes you despised by others. Then imagine that it is carried on through your descendents.  That is my theory of what Crastor's curse is.  And I think he is not the only one to carry the curse."
pureasoiaf,3c2lj4,ciobanica,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:36:07 2015 UTC,"I like that! The theme of ""Best For The Realm"" constantly comes up. Crastor could be part of it, ""there must always be a stark in winterfell"" could be too as well as other little things.  The more these little things happen possibly the greater the power of the others becomes?  On the blood magic in the north topic I think it has diminished but I also think in some places (where the old gods are strong and taken seriously)it hasnt at all  (Skagos, The Mountain Clans, The Umbers and The Wildlings) possibly. Its referenced many times that a lot of things happen in the north that people who arent from there wouldnt understand and dont know occur south of the wall, and north of the wall there are fervant followers of the old gods. To elaborate further it seems that once you leave The North magic is taboo and not thought of much as even being a real feasible thing. People reference it once in a while (in the south) but not like in The North where people seem to Believe its a very real tangible thing. The south is completely ignorant of the looming threat of The Coming Winter which screams that it will bite them in the ass somehow.    Edit: Added text"
pureasoiaf,3c2lj4,JewBot6000,2,Thu Jul 16 02:19:35 2015 UTC,"I still go with the idea that White Walkers are not the same as ""Others"".  White Walkers are the ""half-human"" spawn that Old Nan mentions.  It's possible that a certain bloodline is necessary for a baby to be eligible to become a WW, i.e. the bloodline of Night's King. Craster is mentioned as having black blood, and bearing a heavy curse. If he is a descendant of Night's King he may be one of the few able to produce babies eligible for WW, possibly limited to males as per his practice."

pureasoiaf,3bp11l,devious_thumbtacks,6,Wed Jul 1 00:08:18 2015 UTC,"Edit: Sorry for the formatting issues. New to Reddit and the lack of a preview before posting is working against me!  Basically, this. There are numerous logical problems with the OP and this particular line of reasoning. None of it seems to be backed up by the novels.  The books have never stated or implied if the Others have a king or leader. It isn't unreasonable to assume that they have some sort of leader or king but nothing has been said about that. And there's certainly nothing to suggest that Rhaegar would somehow end up leading the Others. It doesn't track that a Faceless Man would be hired to replace Rhaegar. Why would a Faceless Man even agree to do that? They're assassins, not bodyguards. More importantly, why would anyone want to do that?  It was Lyanna that loved blue winter roses, not Rhaegar. If the blue winter rose at the Wall represents anyone, it's Lyanna. And who is at the Wall who is most likely a part of Lyanna? It certainly isn't Samwell Tarly...  I'm not completely sure if I need spoiler tags for the following but I'm putting them here just in case since my comments do include information from ASOS and GRRM himself.  What we know about the Night's King from the novels: Spoilers ASOS:  Spoilers Speculation based on the above plus a comment from one of Crastor's wives in ASOS:  Additionally, GRRM has commented on the Night's King on his blog: Spoilers Possible spoilers from GRRM: Re: Game of Thrones Wiki re Night's King"
pureasoiaf,3bp11l,clonedllama,2,Wed Jul 1 21:23:56 2015 UTC,"Good post, thanks! I agree that it is more a reference to Lyanna, though the blue rose is certainly tied to Rhaegar: he gave her the winter rose ""crown""."
pureasoiaf,3bp11l,Grompson,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:39:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks! :)  Regarding the roses, that is a good point. Rhaegar did give her a crown of winter roses. I'm not sure if we've ever been told how he found out about her love of those roses but it seems unlikely that he'd pick the exact rose that she loved when he crowned her queen of love and beauty. Although maybe it was purely a coincidence and perhaps he loved the roses as well. A classic case of two people being destined to be together. And that would have played right into Rhaegar's desire to fulfill the prophecy. It's also important to note that Rhaegar felt it was his destiny to fulfill the prophecy of the prince that was promised. That prophecy is specifically about fighting back the Others, not joining them.  However, the reason I personally think the blue winter rose refers to Lyanna specifically is because of how well-established her love of those roses is in the story. Whenever the roses get mentioned, it's almost always in reference to Lyanna. So while GRRM could be referencing Rhaegar with the winter rose at the Wall, it seems more likely that it's a reference to Lyanna and her legacy.  Having said that, I suppose if the theories about her and Rhaegar are true, and at this stage I honestly don't see how they can't be true given the overwhelming evidence, the winter rose at the Wall could easily represent their legacy. I don't think it means anything beyond that, though. Trying to work out a way for it to represent Rhaegar's fate as the king of the Others takes some serious mental acrobatics. It's way too convoluted and not the kind of twist GRRM would write. His twists always come about organically from what he's already established or foreshadowed. He's a master of hiding information in plain sight. The simplest explanations using what we already know are much more likely."
pureasoiaf,3bp11l,clonedllama,2,Fri Jul 3 16:25:00 2015 UTC,"I basically agree; I think the winter rose is more representative of Rhaegar and Lyanna's story (the song of ice and fire) than anything else. I think it was probably easy to find out what her favourite flower was and get a highborn teenaged girl to ""fall in love"" with a handsome Prince long enough to fulfill what Rhaegar believes to be a prophesy."
pureasoiaf,3bp11l,Grompson,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:24:27 2015 UTC,"The Night's King, is, imho, a recurring figure in the cycle of Summer and Winter, which is eternal. The Night's King is that northern King who, repeatedly, does a secret pact with the Others whenever they appear again. The 13th commander of the Night's Watch was probably the last one.   I predict: the next one will demolish the wall, among all things and, differently from the last, will not be cruel, he'll find another -even if morally grey-shaded- way to, temporarily, come to a resolve with the Great Other."

Any alternative explanation is too messy and absurdly complicated to be plausible.   As for who the Others' leader is, I'm not sure it matters. GRRM recently said that the Night's King was a legendary figure along the lines of Lann the Clever and Brandon the Builder. This means that it's entirely possible he never even existed, or was an amalgamation of many people, or just greatly exaggerated over the centuries since he lived. At any rate, even in the tales the Night's King wasn't the leader of the Others. He was the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and ""ruled"" from the Nightfort, far from the Lands of Always Winter where the Others dwell. It's even said he made sacrifices to the Others, suggesting that he worshiped them, and perhaps that they had some control over him. (If his wife was an Other, that might explain it)   I don't know if it really matters who leads them now. (Though I'm sure they do have a leader) I think it's more about what they want and how can they be stopped."

Any alternative explanation is too messy and absurdly complicated to be plausible.    My attitude towards all of this as well. I have a friend who firmly believes that Mance = Rhaegar. The mental hoops you'd need to jump through just to make it even plausible... way too messy. Having the catalyst for the entire series who has been dead for 16 years turn out to be suddenly still alive would be extremely cheap from a writing standpoint.
pureasoiaf,3bp11l,JewBot6000,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:48:32 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think the simplest explanation is the right one in the case of Rhaegar: Robert killed him on the Trident. Not only would Rhaegar still being alive be needlessly complicated and messy, it doesn't track with what we know, or the story that's being told. The tragedy of Rhaegar's fall and the fallout from that fall is far too important to the main story for GRRM to suddenly say, ""Oops. Just kidding!"" On top of that, it goes against GRRM's writing style.  The most likely explanation for Mance's identity is equally simple. He was a wildling child that was taken in as member of the Night's Watch who later abandoned the NW in favor of living as a free man. In other words, the story he told Jon was true."

pureasoiaf,3bp11l,clonedllama,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:34:34 2015 UTC,"I hope so but it could very easily just become just another battle between ""good versus evil"" where as these books have been focused more on the conflict within characters and the choices they make."

ASOIAF is far more complex than that and given how much work GRRM has done to make sure the story isn't purely good versus evil, it just doesn't fit his style."
pureasoiaf,3bp11l,clonedllama,2,Sat Jul 11 03:40:28 2015 UTC,"hence why I dont think there will be a ""Nights King"" leading the Others."
pureasoiaf,3bp11l,chr20b,2,Sat Jul 11 08:45:19 2015 UTC,"Well, I agree with you there. I highly doubt there's a ""Night's King"" in the manner that is described in the stories. GRRM's comments on his blog (see my response to devious_thumbtacks further up for the full quote) suggest that the Night's King as we know him from the stories is long gone. That doesn't mean there can't be some modern version of him but he seemed to be somewhat opposed to the idea (something a certain adaptation is fully running with). He also didn't completely refute it. He merely stated his preference.  I think there is some truth to the story of the Night's King but I think that ultimately that's what it is: a story. If you look at the story in detail, it reads a lot like a fairy-tale intended to teach future generations certain lessons.  1) The real enemy is the Others, not the wildlings. The King in the North and the King-beyond-the-Wall allied to drive back a common threat.  2) Remaining celibate is important to the vows of the Night's Watch.  3) Don't make sacrifices to the Others.  4) Getting involved in the politics of Westeros goes against the purpose of the Watch.  That said, the concept of Others having some sort of leader isn't necessarily off the table even if we discount the concept of the Night's King in particular. It's difficult to know at this stage of the story if the Others are working towards a common goal through some sort of shared understanding, if they have a king or leader that's organizing everything, or if they're all acting independently and there are numerous factions.  Given the way George has written every other civilization in his story so far, I wouldn't be surprised at all if the Others end up being some combination of all of those things. I also don't think it would be out of the question for him to reveal that the Others are merely defending their home from the forces that have repeatedly invaded Westeros. But like with all civilizations, that kind of goal can become distorted and perverted over time by extremists that hijack a more noble cause. Perhaps it started as nothing more than a defense of their home and over time it evolved into a more extreme movement."
pureasoiaf,3bp11l,clonedllama,3,Tue Jul 14 21:45:21 2015 UTC,GRRM said Rhaegar was cremated so being the current King of the Others would be quite a feat.
pureasoiaf,3bhjsg,FearlessNodoka27,81,Mon Jun 29 07:24:38 2015 UTC,"I feel that's false. If Balon hadn't rebuffed Theon, Theon wouldn't have thought to try and take Winterfell in an attempt to impress him. This leads to him pretending to kill Bran and Rickon which leads to Robb seeking comfort with Jeyne Westerling which leads to the Red Wedding. Plus it also leads to the Boltons taking over Winterfell and Reek.   So it might have been a small part, but it was important in how the story played out."
pureasoiaf,3bhjsg,elvictoria,55,Mon Jun 29 07:53:23 2015 UTC,"If Balon hadn't rebuffed Theon   Theon thinks Balon rebuffed him, but that is not true at all. Balon was giving Theon command of a small contingent of his invasion force, in order to test his mettle and his worthiness for command. If he did well, Balon would have given him greater and greater responsibilities and respect in subsequent campaigns. It was Theon's arrogance that blinded him to his father's true intentions. If Balon really wanted to rebuff Theon, he simply wouldn't have given him a command at all."
pureasoiaf,3bhjsg,ElenTheMellon,28,Mon Jun 29 09:22:59 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it was jealousy of Robb which led him, not his father's lack of love. He couldn't have the toy [being a Stark] so he smashed the toy."
pureasoiaf,3bhjsg,april9th,11,Mon Jun 29 13:58:35 2015 UTC,"Adding to your thoughts, Balon could be deemed the epitome of tough love, despite the callousness of Balon and some of the other Ironborn, he may still love his son, but regardless of social position, every Ironborn has to prove their worth and I think Balon may be trying to squeeze that out of Theon.   He probably wants to see how Theon reacts to his callousness, it can certainly be used as a great motivator. Unfortunately this backfires and Theon rockets to the dizzying heights of capturing Winterfell with a handful of men, poor Theon."

Exactly.  I think it was more of a ""Boy Named Sue"" kind of thing.  Balon knows Theon can never rule the Iron Islands if he remains as ""green"" as he is, if he doesn't really become Ironborn.   The Ironborn would have eaten Theon alive as he was at that point.  From Theon's own chapters, we see how little he knows of his people.     Balon was basically, to borrow a phrase, only trying to ""kill the boy, and let the man be born."""
pureasoiaf,3bhjsg,Jordoom,7,Sat Jul 4 17:59:09 2015 UTC,"That's a really good point that I hadn't really picked up on before and only saw Theon's side of his relationship with his father. From the perspective of the Ironborn culture, you really are expected to meet the requirements of a Lord/King. Think Lord Tytos or Mace, they would make poor Ironborn leaders. Theon's arrogance comes from his mainland thoughts and expectations of a Prince having a much larger role and command in an invasion.   Despite this, even Theon must realize that he has never had any experience of naval command and that giving him a larger host would be unwise. I do think that Theon would have been more likely to bend to Balon's request if Asha was not in the mix, Balon's preference for Asha deeply wounds Theon and he is furious that Balon would rather seek to place her on the Seastone chair as opposed to Theon, superseding his inheritance as Balon's last living son. The thing that put me most on the side of Theon is the fact that Balon declares Theon a Stark despite it being his fault that his son was taken hostage.   On the other hand, you can sympathise with Balon on this. Whether it was his fault or not, Balon truly doesn't know Theon and is right to mistrust him. Balon really does not know where Theon's allegiance lies and he has been investing in Asha for years who has proved herself to be a strong and capable leader."
pureasoiaf,3bhjsg,samedreamchina,3,Mon Jun 29 19:16:12 2015 UTC,"Also the iron born taking the north is hugely important. It is important for everything that has to do with our true borne lord Ramsay Bolton, Theons Reeks arc, Bran, and a lot that will happen up north in tWoW.

pureasoiaf,3bhjsg,elvictoria,25,Mon Jun 29 07:56:55 2015 UTC,Even his death served to create the Kingsmoot. I've not finished AFFC or ADWD quite yet but I understand that all the Greyjoys are kind of set into motion after that. Currently Euron is troubling the areas near Highgarden and Victarion is going to head across the narrow sea to grab Dany.

pureasoiaf,3bhjsg,arsanyf,14,Sat Jul 4 11:55:28 2015 UTC,"Plenty.  But one of the overriding themes of ASOIAF is that all men must die, and, consequently, all men must serve.  Everyone, no matter how insignificant, must serve for something.  It doesn't have to be obvious.  They can serve as background scenery.  They can serve to flesh out the world.  They can serve to shine a little spotlight on a corner that wouldn't get seen otherwise.  They can add local depth.  Everyone does something.  A good example, I think, is Brienne's wild goose chase in the Crownlands in AFFC.  She ends up at Crackclaw Point with Dick Crabb, learning about the local legends in the place where he grew up, Dick Crabb, this random dude who happened to be from that area.  What good does he do?  What's the point of running into a few of the Brave Companions there?  It serves to develop her character a bit, and it serves to give the reader a glimpse into how the people of Westeros really live and who they really are.  Not everyone is from a powerful house like the Starks or Lannisters or even the Tarths.  Nobody gives a shit about House Crabb (anymore, anyway).  Yet, you get the feeling that literally anywhere you go in the world, you'll find people and places and even kings.  Every bit of white on that map has something.  So maybe Dick Crabb didn't lead Brienne to the Stark girls.  But he did lead the reader to see a corner of the huge world of ASOIAF that said reader would not otherwise have seen."

But in the end, despite being as shady as a shadow baby, he proves himself true to his word and ultimately dies for it, even if he didn't actually help Brienne in any meaningful way.

It may not always further the plot but it enriches the world which is pretty much what briennes chapters in feast did. Who cares about Aemon the Dragonknight or Cregan Stark in terms of furthering the plot but people still love what they have heard about these characters.
pureasoiaf,3bhjsg,MrSurname,2,Mon Jun 29 20:16:41 2015 UTC,"Mainly because history repeats itself and even if it doesn't further the plot it can help you analyse and theorize.  For instance, the Criston Cole story would make you assume that Jaime might declare for Myrcella. It may or may not happen but at least you know for sure that Jaime considered it at some point.   Learning about the history of the Targaryens and Starks would enrich the WOIAF and come up with theories like this https://youtu.be/Tqvnwo2I0ZM  But the crab people are not essential to the story at all. Hence the ""why bother"" rhetoric."
pureasoiaf,3bhjsg,Cathsaigh,2,Mon Jun 29 20:53:08 2015 UTC,"I think it's a metaphor for some of the larger mysteries in the world. Dick Crabb presents a lot of legends that seem laughable to us, but only because it's him telling the story. His story about the whispers turns out just to be the way the ocean waves hit the caverns in the water. All at once we're set up with this sort of mythology of this particular area, but it's unraveled all at once.  In the long run, it may turn out that things like Azor Ahai and the many prophecies are just that - whispers that are meant to deceive us.  Or maybe GRRM was just writing stuff for the hell of it. Who knows with him."

pureasoiaf,3bhjsg,shinarit,3,Mon Jun 29 20:46:54 2015 UTC,i dont care still very nice interpretation
pureasoiaf,3bhjsg,qwazokm,3,Tue Jun 30 01:11:49 2015 UTC,"If you are like me and of the mind that Dany is basically a villain in the series, then Quentyn's death serves a lot of purpose.   It will drive a wedge between Dorne and Dany, and it puts the Dornish squarely into the camp of Aegon.   Quentyn's death severs Dany's last true ""tie"" to Westeros (save Tyrion, the hated Imp and murderer of the King and Hand; and Jorah, exiled for slavery), which will serve to make her less sympathetic to the Westerosi.   ""Oh, look, it's the daughter of the Mad King, with vicious dragons and a brutal army.  Oh, and the last guy to try to ally with her, she fed to her dragons so she could keep fucking a sellsword and her Horselords.""   That isn't true, of course, but that's what will get back to Westeros, basically.    The juxtaposition of Dany and Aegon is actually really interesting.   Dany rides a black dragon, will be commanding barbarians, mercenaries, sell-swords, Ironborn, and eunuch-slaves.   In any other novel, that's the villain.  If she had minotaurs and evil wolves, she'd basically be the White Witch of Narnia, in terms of army composition.  Aegon, meanwhile, is a boy-king trained by peasants, humble knights, a septa, and a maester.  He's Moses, Luke Skywalker, Clark Kent, the hidden baby.   He is given the ancient magic sword of his ancestors, and is a handsome young man ready for a suitor and marriage.    He's not perfect, but he's practically Arthurian.   Like Ned, or Robb, or Jon before him, Aegon is your standard fantasy ""hero.""    Quentyn's death is meant to serve the greater story and the other characters, and to cast light on Dany's character.  Even Barristan comes close to mentally-chiding her for rejecting him.     She wants fire, and Dorne sent her mud. You could make a poultice out of mud to cool a fever. You could plant seeds in mud and grow a crop to feed your children. Mud would nourish you, where fire would only consume you, but fools and children and young girls would choose fire every time."

pureasoiaf,3bhjsg,qwazokm,13,Mon Jun 29 19:36:38 2015 UTC,"None of the prologue characters are ""needed"". None of them have an overlarge impact on the story (except maybe Pate, we have yet to see). Each prologue chapter has existed to show the slow return of magic to Westeros. Will (AGOT) and Chet (ASOS) to demonstrate the powers & return of the Others. Maester Cressen (ACOK) to introduce & demonstrate the powers of R'hllor & the red priests/priestesses. Pate to show that the Citadel & order of maesters is not exactly what it appears, give information on the glass candle, and show the return of Jaqen Hghar. And Varamyr existed to demonstrate the darker side of skinchanging, the moral implications, and the possibility of a life after death for wargs, which we would have never fully understood just from Bran & Jojen. None of the prologue chapters are absolutely essential to the plot, but I feel they're integral to the story."

pureasoiaf,3bhjsg,Theysurecandance,11,Mon Jun 29 15:29:18 2015 UTC,All his talk of the abomination that is slipping into another human's skin seems relevant to Bran and Hodor.
pureasoiaf,3bhjsg,qwazokm,5,Mon Jun 29 19:38:20 2015 UTC,"It does, considering Sixskins attempted to warg a human, but the fact that it revolves around the warg dying is the key factor. Not to mention that it was the same warg that Jon was with previously, and that Ghost is specifically referenced by Sixskins, all clues seem to point to this being particularly relevant when considering Jon.  Now that's not to say it doesn't also cover Bran. This information could very well be important to his story arc and what may befall him later. This only reinforces the original point though - Varamyr's chapter was all but unimportant."

Here it is (no guarantee of completeness):  Alys Harroway with Maegor 'the cruel' Targaryen   What was expelled from her womb was a monstrosity, eyeless and twisted, and in his fury Maegor blamed and executed her midwives, septas, and the Grand Maester Desmond.    Ellinor Costayne with Maegor 'the cruel' Targaryen   She, too, became pregnant, and like Alys before her, she gave birth to a stillborn abomination said to have been born eyeless and with small wings.   Laena Velaryon with Daemon Targaryen   In 120 AC, Laena was brought to bed again with child, and delivered the son that Daemon had always desired. What was drawn from her womb was twisted and deformed, however, and died shortly after birth. Laena, too, soon expired.   Rhaenyra Targaryen with Daemon Targaryen   When the babe at last came forth, she proved indeed a monster: a stillborn girl, twisted and malformed, with a hole in her chest where her heart should have been, and a stubby, scaled tail.    Daenerys Targaryen with Drogo son of Bharbo   Twisted. I drew him forth myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with the stub of a tail and small leather wings like the wings of a bat.   My current theory on this is that every Targaryen dragon born has the soul of a dead Targaryen infant/embryo. This transformation used to happen naturally when there were still dragons around (and thus magic). But when the last dragon died this stopped to happen which is why Aemon speaks of eggs that would not hatch.   Notice that the last mention of such a stillborn is Rhaenyra on the day the Dance of Dragons started (where all the dragons died) until the day Daenerys brings back the dragons."

pureasoiaf,3bh2a7,Stauncho,5,Mon Jun 29 04:21:12 2015 UTC,Well it was said Bloodraven was rumored to have dabbled in dark magic.  So I meant Targaryens but maybe could be applied to Valyrians in general.
pureasoiaf,3bh2a7,Stauncho,9,Mon Jun 29 05:12:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but Bloodraven is a whole 'nother ball of wax.  Personally, I think that that the dragon-like still borns have to do with the original magic that somehow bound the Valyrians and the dragons together and that the occasional dragon baby stillborn is a result of that. I don't think it has to do with new instances of magic. (See Princess and the Queen for another example)."

When she gets to Volantis the slaves will rise on her behalf and she will take the city easily.   Meanwhile Victarion will successfully swipe two of the dragons, but not with dragonbinder, just with ham, and will head back to Westeros.   Dany will be forced to head to Westeros with her Dothraki horde in order to rescue her two other children from the clutches of the ironborn. She may use the remainder of the Volantene fleet.

I think Hizdahr might even be dead by the time she gets West, giving her a new suitor: Aegon. However I do agree that it is very unlike George to set that up so perfectly so I do not think her and Aegon will wed but I also don't think there will be bad blood between them considering their mutual chivalry and family relationship. Nothing is stopping Dany from allying with Aegon if she is wed by the time they meet and Aegon is wisely counseled and nobody will dare say he should try to meet her on the field (cause dragons). At the end of the day, unless Dany is Maegor the Cruel reborn post-Dothraki incident, she will most likely not be killing her nephew to defend her claim before she tries to ally with him."

pureasoiaf,3b87sd,SuperImposer,12,Sat Jun 27 20:32:13 2015 UTC,"Yes- the Citadel is undoubtedly the most superior player in the Game of Thrones.  They instigated the Dance and Robert's Rebellion, killed off the dragons and re-wrote history in order to obtain a monopoly on magical knowledge and bring about a magical dark-age.  I blame them for the massive memory loss of the old noble houses of Westeros especially house Stark- The North does NOT Remember. Too much information has been lost. Sure- the Others and the Long Night haven't occurred for 8,000 years but magic and magical creatures have been around until recently.  Even if the Starks truely believed the maesters line about magic being gone from the world and never to return it's part of their heritage. The should know more about their own history, words and sigil than they do at the start of the series.  Add to that GRRM puts two independent sources in the series who say the same thing about them and you have a guilty verdict from me."
pureasoiaf,3b87sd,TheJankins,5,Fri Jun 26 23:25:40 2015 UTC,"They instigated the Dance and Robert's Rebellion    How so? I mean, I don't doubt it, but I've only read the series once so far, so I can't recall the evidence off hand.     I blame them for the massive memory loss of the old noble houses   Exactly! Like you said, a magical dark ages. This is one thing that really broke my heart about the series, the loss of knowledge and the deliberate burial of all this rich history we can only glimpse at. As I first started to learn about maesters I really liked them as being learned men, but once I realized the sort of historical destruction they perpetrate I started to resent the Citadel for the sinister organization it is.   At the same time, they are so impressive- like you said, a superior player in the game of thrones. The fact that they've managed to put themselves in such a ridiculously powerful position- power over the flow of information, power over even life and death- and yet have everyone convinced they're completely harmless... The Citadel are some of the ultimate chessmasters, it's true."

pureasoiaf,3b2jtv,nullpointer-,12,Thu Jun 25 13:25:46 2015 UTC,"i'm in agreement that it is not jon connington, mostly for the reason you stated. i believe all three visions are separate entities.   my main add would be that since it is the third vision, it will likely not occur until after aegon has been dealt with, pushing it into the final book. thus, whatever or whoever the vision represents, we probably don't have the clues yet to figure it out.   i do think it should be something one one that we are familiar with and something major. baelish would be interesting, but i think i like the citadel the best. we are being set up for them to be revealed as a player and they have been in the background of the story from the beginning.   as for the shadow fire, i'd expect we will find out in the next book.  affc set the groundwork for aegon, adwd revealed him and how he fit the vision, dany will not slay his lie until book 6. we will be able to identify the stone beast from clues given in book 6 so that dany can slay that lie in book 7"
pureasoiaf,3b2jtv,repo_sado,10,Thu Jun 25 13:57:33 2015 UTC,"Small thing first,    where Gerold and his daughter   It's not Gerald, it's Leyton Hightower. Gerald died a the ToJ.   Great write up, I like how you put it together. Now, maybe we should also focus on what's missing. Stannis and Aegon are surly pretenders to the throne, but there are others as well, like Tommon and the Lannister/Tyrell alliance. Maybe by the time Dany comes only those two are left, then I wonder like you who the third pretender is, but what if they are not selected because they are pretenders to the throne, but just hiding something? A griffin is defiantly a great stone beast, and JonCon is hiding his Gray Scale and that may become very important.   Or maybe, it is different from what we think all together. Maybe    blue-eyed king who cast no shadow   is not Stannis. Maybe Jons arc takes a different turn than we imagine, and he becomes somewhat of a champion of the Others, after he realizes that they are not all bad, just the other side of the equation. Maybe we saw the three heads of the Dragon. Dany, Jon and Tyrion. WTF you say? Why should Dany be the cloth Dragon? And Tyrion be the great stone beast? Well Tyrion first. He is often equated to Gargoyles, great stone beasts. And why should Dany be the cloth dragon? Well she was at that point manipulated by many people, and is still by Quathe.   Or a third pretender to the throne arises between the end of aDwD and the time Dany comes to Westeros.   Or maybe they represent three challenges to Dany, made by lies. One is a false savior, with a false sword, whom people follow instead of her, one is a false dragon, whom people follow instead of her, and the third... I don't know, Grayscale again, maybe. It would be caused by lies, JonCons lyes. He just conquered Storms End, maybe that burns down, and from there the big spread of Grayscale starts.   I think the prophecies will make us run around like chickens with their heads cut of, and they may come true in only metaphorical ways."
pureasoiaf,3b2jtv,FuriousFap42,2,Thu Jun 25 21:02:15 2015 UTC,"Oh, my bad, I always forget Leyton's name.  Your ideas are really, really interesting - indeed, it's possible that the 'stone beast' won't make sense for us until later on the series. I really liked that interpretation on the mummer's dragon as Dany herself, not because she's fake, but because she's being manipulated...   Tyrion as the stone beast doesn't make that much sense now, but again, we still have at least two books left (which averages 1500 pages), and many of the visions from the HotU only became relevant on the last books.  In the end, we can't determine what the prophecies truly mean until the very end of it all (or even then!), and many answers may remain hidden from us for a few hundred pages more."
pureasoiaf,3b2jtv,FuriousFap42,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:02:33 2015 UTC,"Tyrion as the stone beast doesn't make that much sense now, but again   Well he is associated with gargoyles, who are even in our world great stone beasts.   here are some quotes where he is compared or associated with them:   Tyrion Lannister was sitting on the ledge above the door to the Great Hall, looking for all the world like a gargoyle. The dwarf grinned down at him.  Motionless as a gargoyle, Tyrion Lannister hunched on one knee atop a merlon.  They hacked off her brother's head in the hope that it was mine, yet here I sit like some bloody gargoyle, offering empty consolations.    Also Tyrion being giant, would just fit so nicely, since he is a intellectual giant, but so short in hight.   But in my search I just found someone who is also associated with gargoyles.    Bran could perch for hours among the shapeless, rain-worn gargoyles that brooded over the First Keep, watching it all:  You could go straight up to where the gargoyles leaned out blindly over empty space, and swing from gargoyle to gargoyle, hand over hand, around to the north side.   There are many like that, where he is just around them but not described like one like Tyrion. He sees them over and over again and no other character in Winterfell mentions them, until Theon in aDwD. But just for the sake of fun, lets say it was Bran and not Tyrion. What if this video is correct, and the children lied to Bran about why they want him, and Bran will become a big antagonist for Dany."
pureasoiaf,3b2jtv,granal03,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:54:00 2015 UTC,Is the blue eyed king not Euron?
pureasoiaf,3b2jtv,FuriousFap42,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:21:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but consider this: Dany dreams of a battle at the Trident with the blue eyed king, the king coming from the north. Euron is in the south, and is also interested in dragons, not    an army armored in ice   Also, this prophecy is from aCoK, long before Euron was introduced. That may not mean anything, but it makes it at least a bit less likely that he was such a central part to be in such a prophecy. But it could be him, even if I think of Stannis and Jon as much more likely possibilities. Those prophecies are always so vage that GRRM will not be backed in a corner if he changes his mind about something"
pureasoiaf,3b2jtv,Ruddy_Hall,2,Fri Jul 3 20:06:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this, great analysis.  Cersei, Queen of Lies and Mother of Pretenders, perhaps?   In AFFC she burns the Tower of the Hand and her description of the fire borders on the masochistic side.    ""Cersei felt too alive for sleep. The wildfire was cleansing her, burning away all her rage and fear, filling her with resolve. “The flames are so pretty. I want to watch them for a while.” Cersei - Chapter 12 AFFC   In regards to ""A stone beast that flies,"" I'm stumped. Perhaps Qyburn gave Robert Strong a pair of wings?

pureasoiaf,3b2jtv,Ser_Alliser_Thorne,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:00:52 2015 UTC,"Melisandre while on Dragonstone with Stannis often stated how she wanted to sacrifice Edric Storm to wake a/the Stone Dragon.  She required king's blood for it, but Davos frees Edric before he can be sacrificed.  She's not always the best interpreter of what the flame visions show her.  The location of the Stone Dragon could be anywhere.  It could also be just a conjured up being from the material around the conjurer.  Hear me out.  Melisandre is a shadowbinder from Asshai as well as a priestess of R'hyllor.  Even if you assume the R + L = Jon theory, Robb Stark made Jon his heir in front of his northern Lords.  Upon Robb's death, Jon is technically King of the North (so his blood is now Royal instead of bastard).  Jon is critically wounded, if not killed at Castle Black.    Melisandre may have more than enough Royal blood for her spell to wake a Stone Dragon.  We know Castle Black was fallen in to great disrepair and is in even worse shape since the Wildings attacked it.  What does this signify?  There's plenty of stone to mold in to the hypothetical Stone Dragon.   In short, Melisandre has the chance of creating a Stone Dragon from Castle Black's lack of maintenance and battle damage, has royal blood from Jon's fatal or near fatal wounds, and would like use shadow magic from Asshai to truly bring the false dragon together.  The weakspot in my crack theory is if Melisandre knows Jon was made Robb's heir or if she knows the blood of kings passes t hrough his veins through the R + L = Jon fan theory.    I don't doubt Danny's true dragons would shred the false/created shadow magic dragon."
pureasoiaf,3azyq1,bradsux,10,Wed Jun 24 21:26:44 2015 UTC,"I'm 100% sure that Lightbringer will not be any mere sword, but Dany's dragons. For a start, what makes more sense as a significant weapon against the Others - a fully-grown, trained dragon breathing rivers of fire, or one simple flaming sword? On that note...  ""When your dragons were small they were a wonder. Grown, they are death and devastation, a flaming sword above the world.""  - Xaro Xhoan Daxos, A Dance With Dragons  There are multiple references in the text that equate the dragons with swords or weapons. And as we know from Maester Aemon, the prophecy text contains some translation errors (Prince/Princess) and a mistranslation of weapon to sword may simply be another.  But most importantly, the circumstances around the birthing of the dragons complies exactly with the prophecised forging of lightbringer.  ""In ancient books of Asshai it is written that there will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes...""  - Melisandre, A Clash of Kings (Davos I)  We have had this ""day after a long summer"" - autumn arrives at the end of AGOT/start of ACOK, at the same time as the red comet (or ""Bleeding star"" according to the Dothraki), on the day that Daenerys draws the dragons from the fire. It's also interesting that Melisandre seems to give the exact same set of circumstances for waking dragons from stone as she does for forging Lightbringer, yet never connects the two.  ""When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone.""  - Melisandre, A Storm of Swords (Davos III)  And then you have the parallels between Dany/Drogo and the story of Nissa Nissa. The original AA first failed to temper the sword, but succeeded when he plunged it into his wife's heart. This is probably not a literal story but an allegorical one - the main takeaway being that the forging of Lightbringer involved the sacrifice of a loved one, and obeys a rule we know well - only death can pay for life. Dany sacrifices her spouse in order to ""forge"" her dragons in the fire.   ""It is said that her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon, but her blood and her soul and her strength and her courage all went into the steel.""  - Salladhor Saan, A Clash of Kings (Davos I)  This is not directly related to the theory, but I found it interesting, if probably meaningless, that this passage uses the same ""cracked moon"" imagery that Doreah describes when talking about the original birth of dragons.   Related to this theory, though not part of it, is the idea that there is not one Azor Ahai but several - the three heads of the dragon, if you will.  ""And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him.""  The prophecy is in fact telling us very clearly that they who hold Lightbringer, by simple virtue of holding it, are Azor Ahai. Anyone who tames and rides a dragon is therefore Azor Ahai. Three dragons, three Lightbringers, three dragonriders, three heads of the dragon. Three Azor Ahais.   tl;dr - Dany's dragons are Lightbringer, and if I'm wrong I'll swallow Dawn myself."
pureasoiaf,3azyq1,thevoid68,3,Fri Jun 26 10:11:34 2015 UTC,I've found it incredibly difficult to get into most of the other theories about Azor Ahai. But I adore this one.
pureasoiaf,3azyq1,lovelylayout,12,Fri Jun 26 13:12:11 2015 UTC,"I actually think the forging is pretty much spot on. With everything we know about blood magic and the WoIAF mentioning of Qohori rituals in reforging valyrian steel (hint: It's a bloody mess).  Forging valyrian steel involves a blood sacrifice, it's simple as that. Blood magic becomes more potent the more important/dear the sacrifice is to the one making the sacrifice. The willing sacrifice of a innocent lover would be the most powerful sacrifice of them all. Hence, it would also yield an incredibly powerful sword of valyrian steel. Aka. lightbringer.  Sidenote. The sacrifice of the innocent as the most powerful blood sacrifice is a staple of ancient/classical litterature and stories."
pureasoiaf,3azyq1,DullDawn,4,Thu Jun 25 01:55:13 2015 UTC,Food for thought: do we think the Lightbringer Stannis wields could be powered up by a powerful blood sacrifice? What kind of situation could occur in which he would need such a powerful sword?
pureasoiaf,3azyq1,Boddrick,3,Thu Jun 25 11:55:57 2015 UTC,"Forging valyrian steel involves a blood sacrifice, it's simple as that. Blood magic becomes more potent the more important/dear the sacrifice is to the one making the sacrifice.    Has anyone theorized that the mythical Lightbringer may have been the first Valyrian steel sword? I have exactly nothing to back up that idea, but it popped into my head just now and I think it's neat."
pureasoiaf,3azyq1,lovelylayout,3,Thu Jun 25 14:39:05 2015 UTC,"I have also wondered if its a tale about the first time a Valyrian steel type sword was forged. Then, you know, lesser sacrifices would yield lesser, but still very good, swords. That way you don't need to kill a loved one every time."
pureasoiaf,3azyq1,Ser_Samshu,4,Sat Jun 27 05:18:26 2015 UTC,"Meh, I dunno. I still feel that those messiahnic figures are just legends. Sure, magic exists, maybe it has to do with the return of dragons, maybe the return of the others has to do with it, but prophesies... err, I dunno, seems shaky that it would actually happen.  However, about the thing of the story getting more and more exagerated as it was passed on, it even happened in the real world. In El Cantar del Mio Cid, an ancient castillian book from the Reconquista period in Spain paints the Cid as an incredibly zealous and honourable lord, unable to harm a fly unless it wore a turban on their heads. The Song of Roldan paints Charlemagne as super duper old and still manly af, as well as Roldan (he split a rock with his sword... a solid, huge rock btw) and, excuse me if I offend anyone, I don't mean nothing by it, according to a bible I owned when I was little, Moses lived up to 400 years, I think. Legends get blown out of proportion, it is a possible occurence, and that it happens in ASOIAF's world is just as credible too."
pureasoiaf,3azyq1,EinherjarofOdin,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:10:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with your second point. The first however... I'm not sure about all prophesies, but Jojen's green dreams were pretty accurate. Perhaps what you said about things getting exaggerated over time could apply there too?"
pureasoiaf,3azyq1,Ser_Samshu,2,Sat Jun 27 05:27:19 2015 UTC,"That's why I said that magic exists.   But to bet on a prophesy to me is like betting on a single bullet on a six-shooter not to click when you pull it against your head. It super broad and ambiguous, and could be considered real if it completes any of the reality checks it has. Like saying that tomorrow will be a beautiful day, first off: it's ambiguous and even if it rained it could still be a beautiful day. Maybe it's not the best analogy as it is an incredible oversimplyfication, but I think the point gets across.   And yeah, it could be that the legends and prophesies got indeed blown out of proportion. Maybe some were lost through bad translations, maybe it got modified through the ages as people ignored facts or added new fictional details as flavour and people took them as facts. Although of course, some evidence that no writing medium existed would be some hard evidence for this ""theory"" of mine; right now it's just floating in the air on some very weak circumstantial evidence."
pureasoiaf,3azyq1,EinherjarofOdin,2,Sat Jun 27 05:59:04 2015 UTC,"I always thought that Stannis does in fact wield the real sword lightbringer. It has the light but not the fire. I always contributed this to the fact that he's not a full Targ/pure Valyrian blood or not completely worthy enough to make it go up in flames. But I don't know, Thoros of Myr's sword goes up in flame no longer being a trick of wildfire."
pureasoiaf,3azyq1,mywhereabouts,2,Thu Jun 25 22:29:19 2015 UTC,So let's say Stannis loses on his attack on Winterfell and dies. Finial words are to send his sword to Jon Snow for letting him stay there and IF/WHEN Jon Snow comes back being reborn gets that sword and it becomes the real light bringer
pureasoiaf,3azyq1,ToaD555,2,Fri Jun 26 15:45:08 2015 UTC,"I am starting to warm up to the Lightbringer/Dawn campaign. But I remain reticent.      I think it was Elio and Lindaaaa that popularized this, (i could be wrong) that Dawn may be Lightbringer to be wielded by the Prince that Was Promised, AA, Last Hero or whoever.     That theory has quite some value to it. I mean the name of the sword is DAWN, the person is called the Sword of the MORNING  If those two titles alone do not qualify as an antithesis or for bringing an end to the Long NIGHT then it would be a very cruel misdirect.       But it would also help connect to A Dream of Spring and new beginnings in general."

pureasoiaf,3azyq1,my-little-wonton,2,Thu Jul 9 04:07:50 2015 UTC,"I kind of don't think Dawn is Lightbringer, I don't thing Lightbringer is even a real object that ever existed. Kind of like Jesus it is based on something that happened in the past but the legends have become so overblown that reality and the legend really can't be compared any more. Lightbringer is a symbol, not a real thing."
pureasoiaf,3azpfn,JonSnow96,20,Wed Jun 24 20:18:23 2015 UTC,"Well, we never explicitly hear from Cat what is in Robs will. That is not something she does herself, but something that we experience through her, where she only gives us very incomplete info. And there is the Theon Durden theory (I will search for the link but until then: A theory, that Theon is behind all, or some of the murders in Winterfel, and does not know it, since he has a Fight Club-esque mental problem. When we read from his perspective, we read Reek, but the murders never happen (except when Little Walder is killed) not during his POVs. So someone theorized that he is the one murdering all the people. I am pretty sure that is not the case, since we see some of the circumstances in which they were killed form Theons POV, and there are always washerwomen with them, but it is a fun thing to think about.), but I don't think that one is very serious. But maybe some of Theons view point might be skewed. He can't keep the two Ryswell brothers straight, and my be misinterpreting some peoples emotions. Sansa misremembers the Hound kissing her. A lot happens between the chapters that the POVs don't inform us completely about, like for example as mentioned here Theons castration, but I don't remember anything like with Arya. I will definitely be looking for that on my next reread.  One time GRRM breacks his third person POV rule, to hide from us what goes on when Vics hand gets healed."
pureasoiaf,3azpfn,FuriousFap42,12,Wed Jun 24 22:10:00 2015 UTC,"Two quick notes about the Theon Durden theory, the first also constituting a response to OP's question  There is precedent in CoK for Theon killing people, or at least having them killed, without specifically referencing it. There are three Ironborn who die in Winterfell during Theon's occupation. As Theon is executing a man for the crime of killing them, he momentarily reflects that he knows the man being executed is just a scapegoat, and that the Ironborn had to die because they knew about Bran/Rickon.  Secondly, there's a fun section in DwD where Theon sits down to breakfast, and two paragraphs later he's eating lunch."
pureasoiaf,3azpfn,Ironhorn,7,Thu Jun 25 01:30:23 2015 UTC,"Assuming the breakfast/lunch section was intentional, it is a really fantastic touch. It would indicate a dissociative episode with Theon experiencing lost time. This would be perfectly in line with someone who has experienced the sort of horrific physical torture Theon has."

pureasoiaf,3azpfn,Yamnana,7,Wed Jun 24 20:32:34 2015 UTC,"There are two major points where GRRM pretty blatantly implies Theon was castrated, imo.  One of them is earlier, in ADWD Chapter 20, Reek II. When Reek is trying to convince the Ironborn in Moat Cailin to surrender, he says:   “Lord Ramsay treats his captives honorably so long as they keep faith with him.” He has only taken toes and fingers and that other thing, when he might have had my tongue, or peeled the skin off my legs from heel to thigh.  The other is the one you mentioned. ADWD Chapter 37, The Prince of Winterfell. During the bedding scene with Ramsay and Jeyne, Ramsay tells Reek to get her ready and Reek replies:  “I … do you mean … m’lord, I have no … I …”  There are lots of other little bits here and there, mostly implications from Theon or Ramsay that Theon ""is no longer a man"".

Almost as Arya herself didn't make a big deal about it, or as she is trying to make us think as it isn't a big deal. If the chapter ended before the question of the Kindly Man, we wouldn't know about the Dareon's death, or we wouldn't think about it. If not killed by Arya, his death wouldn't matter, I think"

The battle of the Redgrass was the last time Blackfyre was seen. The one account we have puts it in Bittersteel's hand, but none of the Blackfyre pretenders since have been seen with it. I think it's plausible for Bloodraven to have secured it after he slew Aemon. And if no one knows he has it, he would be able to spirit it to the wall among his company."

It doesn't go against the sub rules, but most of the readers here will (consciously or not) think poorly about your point, as this subreddit was created specifically  to provide book-only discussion.  Now, on your point: while I agree that Jon is one of the few people on the Wall (or even in Westeros) with notion of the real threat they will find soon, you should remember why Jon was stabbed. He was abandoning his duty as LC of the Night Watch to fight against Ramsay after he got the pink letter, and even if it was the right thing to do, it conflicted with his position.  If/When he is resurrected, it's possible that the Others are already an even more critical threat and he ends up focusing on that. Otherwise... prepare for SNOWBALL get hype, now with 50% more zombieSnow.  But I'm sure he will honour his vow despite his death - Jon doesn't have real ambitions to become Lord Stark, as we saw on his conversation with Stannis, and his sense of responsability won't fail him when his presence is needed to fight the Others. That might change, but it will take half a book at least."

pureasoiaf,3aw0it,Velnica,10,Wed Jun 24 07:01:38 2015 UTC,"I believe it goes much further than that. You may recall Ryman Frey's 'Queen O' Whores' was wearing Robb's crown when Jaime was ending the siege at Riverrun. Jaime sent them away and the small group was set upon by the BwB. Lady Stoneheart is later seen with that crown. I would think that they had taken it from Ryman and his whore if Jaime hadn't specifically told then to leave it. That gives me the impression that the 'Queen 'O Whores' didnt leave it at camp, nor was she a part of Ryman's retinue when he left. She would, however, be in perfect position to let the BwB know where and when Ryman and his group would be travelling. Tom 'O Sevens stayed behind at Riverrun so I don't think the crown came from him.  There are more examples of the 'smallfolk' working with the BwB behind the scenes as well. I'm sure somebody has put them all together in a theory somewhere."

And now a man must die.” A strange smile touched the lips of Jaqen H’ghar.  “Die?” she said, confused. What did he mean? “But I unsaid the name. You don’t need to die now.”  “I do. My time is done.” Jaqen passed a hand down his face from forehead to chin, and where it went he changed. His cheeks grew fuller, his eyes closer; his nose hooked, a scar appeared on his right cheek where no scar had been before. And when he shook his head, his long straight hair, half red and half white, dissolved away to reveal a cap of tight black curls.  Arya’s mouth hung open. “Who are you?” she whispered, too astonished to be afraid. “How did you do that? Was it hard?”  He grinned, revealing a shiny gold tooth. “No harder than taking a new name, if you know the way.”   Arya IX, A Clash of Kings   Leo’s eyes were hazel, bright with wine and malice. “Your mother was a monkey from the Summer Isles. The Dornish will fuck anything with a hole between its legs. Meaning no offense. You may be brown as a nut, but at least you bathe. Unlike our spotted pig boy.” He waved a hand toward Pate.  If I hit him in the mouth with my tankard, I could knock out half his teeth, Pate thought. Spotted Pate the pig boy was the hero of a thousand ribald stories: a good-hearted, empty-headed lout who always managed to best the fat lordlings, haughty knights, and pompous septons who beset him. Somehow his stupidity would turn out to have been a sort of uncouth cunning; the tales always ended with Spotted Pate sitting on a lord’s high seat or bedding some knight’s daughter. But those were stories. In the real world pig boys never fared so well. Pate sometimes thought his mother must have hated him to have named him as she did.   Prologue, A Feast for Crows   “The key?” the alchemist inquired politely.  Something made Pate hesitate. “Is it some book you want?” Some of the old Valyrian scrolls down in the locked vaults were said to be the only surviving copies in the world.  “What I want is none of your concern.”  “No.” It’s done, Pate told himself. Go. Run back to the Quill and Tankard, wake Rosey with a kiss, and tell her she belongs to you. Yet still he lingered. “Show me your face.”  “As you wish.” The alchemist pulled his hood down. He was just a man, and his face was just a face. A young man’s face, ordinary, with full cheeks and the shadow of a beard. A scar showed faintly on his right cheek. He had a hooked nose, and a mat of dense black hair that curled tightly around his ears. It was not a face Pate recognized.   “I do not know you.”  “Nor I you.”  “Who are you?”  “A stranger. No one. Truly.”  “Oh.” Pate had run out of words. He drew out the key and put it in the stranger’s hand, feeling light-headed, almost giddy. Rosey, he reminded himself. “We’re done, then.” He was halfway down the alley when the cobblestones began to move beneath his feet. The stones are slick and wet, he thought, but that was not it. He could feel his heart hammering in his chest. “What’s happening?” he said. His legs had turned to water. “I don’t understand.”  “And never will,” a voice said sadly.  The cobblestones rushed up to kiss him. Pate tried to cry for help, but his voice was failing too.   His last thought was of Rosey.   Prologue, A Feast for Crows   Where has he gone?” asked Sam, bewildered.  “To the docks. The Mage is not a man who believes in wasting time.” Alleras smiled. “I have a confession. Ours was no chance encounter, Sam. The Mage sent me to snatch you up before you spoke to Theobald. He knew that you were coming.”  “How?”  Alleras nodded at the glass candle.  Sam stared at the strange pale flame for a moment, then blinked and looked away. Outside the window it was growing dark.  “There’s an empty sleeping cell under mine in the west tower, with steps that lead right up to Walgrave’s chambers,” said the pasty-faced youth. “If you don’t mind the ravens quorking, there’s a good view of the Honeywine. Will that serve?”  “I suppose.” He had to sleep somewhere.  “I will bring you some woolen coverlets. Stone walls turn cold at night, even here.”   “My thanks.” There was something about the pale, soft youth that he misliked, but he did not want to seem discourteous, so he added, “My name’s not Slayer, truly. I’m Sam. Samwell Tarly.”  “I’m Pate,” the other said, “like the pig boy.”   Samwell V, A Feast for Crows"

pureasoiaf,3aw0it,gmrf,29,Fri Jun 26 22:48:14 2015 UTC,R+L=J. I know... the book practically screams that but reading before sleeping takes a toll on your attention.
pureasoiaf,3aw0it,EinherjarofOdin,30,Wed Jun 24 00:43:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know, maybe it's just me, but the amount of certainty people put on that theory kind of makes me hope it's wrong."

pureasoiaf,3aw0it,EinherjarofOdin,11,Wed Jun 24 02:03:02 2015 UTC,"he's the truest Stark out of them all   And not an ounce of Targ in it, at least not psychologically speaking. Not a shadow of a Napoleonic complex, no great desire for power or delusions of grandeur...  Not saying that R+L=J is wrong, but it does make one think, doesn't it?"
pureasoiaf,3aw0it,gmrf,16,Wed Jun 24 02:46:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah well he wasn't raised a Targ. He wasn't raised to be entitled either. His whole life he's lived under the shadow of the Stark kids, kind of to the side, even when he lived alongside them. Only Robb and Arya show a significant affection to him. He was taught to reach what he could hold, not to go beyond and above.  I'm lukewarm about the theory itself, Jon would be a good king, of that I am sure, but I'm not certain he'd go for it, even if he became the human torch and burnt every damn Other out there, I feel like he wouldn't leave his post. Unless it was for family, me thinks."
pureasoiaf,3aw0it,EinherjarofOdin,6,Wed Jun 24 02:56:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with the points you are making.  I guess you and I are among the few that think like that. I mean, I kind of believe the theory but i keep asking myself ok, he's a Targ, so what? What does it change? He ain't sitting the IT, that's for sure!   But there is also the whole thing about two heads of the dragon being Targs, and I'm also not particularly buying any of those other secret Targs theories out there so... Maybe Aegon actually is the real deal? I don't know...   At this point all I know is people seen too sure of some theories and that makes me think/hope they are wrong."
pureasoiaf,3aw0it,crediblehulk83,5,Wed Jun 24 03:51:26 2015 UTC,"Words are wind, and prophesies are just words, in my opinion. It's a very unreliant source to bet on. I agree on all of your points, Aegon right now is just one more player, if he is legitimate or not, doesn't change anything. It's not like he can ride a Dragon, or as if Dorne by itself will be able to support his claim. Same can be said about Jon, the only difference is no one would support him besides maybe Howland and/or Rickon if he reclaims Winterfell, if he even goes for it. Besides the point about ""what you should do"", I like to think that he learnt that from both Ned and Aemon. The speech he gave him about not forgetting his duties to sit a throne left a deep mark in his mind and judgement."

pureasoiaf,3aw0it,gmrf,5,Wed Jun 24 05:09:04 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's unlikely he sits the Iron Throne, but I don't think it's out of the question. Such an outcome wouldn't actually require any real ambition for the throne, either. Assuming he's brought back, he's at the frontlines of the coming war against the Walkers. He will remain in that role as they move further and further South. People will flock to him as their leaders die. The North will stand by him, the Riverlands, maybe even further South than that. Suddenly he's leading a resistance to the invasion that includes half of Westeros.   Obviously Dany comes over at some point, well, let's say that when the war is over and she can claim her throne, she realizes that Westeros isn't her home. I think there's a real chance she decides to go back to Essos. Aegon will almost certainly be out of the picture by this point. Who do they turn to? How about Jon Snow, who played a vital role in repelling the Others? And what do you know, he's Rhaegar's son! Now we have a reason to put this bastard boy on the throne!  I won't be the least it surprised if it played out that way. Jon's a natural leader, too, so taking the role will come naturally if he's already been leading Westeros against the Walkers for however long that war lasts."

But I do disagree with most opinions and hopes that most of the Fandom seem to agree on. Like I said, at this point, so many people believe the r+l=j that I'm really hoping it's wrong. Maybe I'm the problem.   The other day I was trying to prove Brandon and Lyanna were Jon's parents, but I couldn't make the timeline work. I had everything, motive, opportunity, some text to back the theory up... If only Brandon had died a couple of weeks later I could have Jon as a 42 weeks baby and a strong theory to present.

pureasoiaf,3aw0it,osirusr,5,Wed Jun 24 13:03:23 2015 UTC,"If you want to be really popular at parties, you can tell people that horses technically ""champ"" at their bits.  ""Chomping"" usually implies actually taking a bite out of something."
pureasoiaf,3aw0it,gmrf,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:07:17 2015 UTC,"I'm already quite popular at parties, which is why I know that word meanings change over time as new definitions are added and old definitions fall by the wayside.  For example, I know that the word ""chomp"" is a variant of the word ""champ"" that has become so widespread that it has effectively replaced the original. I also know the implication that ""chomping"" involves taking a bite out of something is not necessarily true as most definitions are some variation of ""bite or chew with mouth and teeth"". The idea that chomping involves fully biting through something is probably an after-the-fact definition invented to justify the existence of the two variations, even though the two variations were just different ways of spelling the exact same word.  So while the original idiom was certainly ""champ at the bit"" back in the 1700s or so, hundreds of years of linguistic shifting has left ""chomp at the bit"" as a perfectly valid (and arguably more popular and easier understood) variation that means the exact same thing.  I'm pretty sure ""champ at the bit"" is still more popular in England, but in the US it's just ""chomp at the bit"". And people who try to insist on using the now-archaic ""champ at the bit"" idiom are, most certainly, not popular at parties. :-)  Edit: As a side note, even if you insist that ""chomping"" involves taking a bite out of something it would still work in my previous posting. Once we reached ""time traveling fetus"" levels of tinfoil I'd say that we, as a community, may have stepped past mere impatient frustration.

pureasoiaf,3aw0it,IntrovPC,5,Wed Jun 24 02:35:08 2015 UTC,think about what you said there to fucked up for even cersei? common this is the woman who gives peasants to Qybourn(sorry if i spelt it wrong) to do experiments on. but i do not put it past her as a way to resurrect her strong and valiant son.
pureasoiaf,3aw0it,Stauncho,8,Wed Jun 24 09:44:42 2015 UTC,Theory is that Qyburn used Jeofrey's head without her knowing to be the last straw to drive her to insanity. It comes from a Dornish Master Plan theory that says that Qyburn is part of Doran's plans to take down the Lanisters.   That theory also say that Qyburn was poisoning Tywin and that is why he was constipated at his end and why his corpse smelled so bad even after being attended to by maesters and silent sisters. He was essentially already dying before Tyrion shot him.
pureasoiaf,3aw0it,Tote_Sport,10,Wed Jun 24 10:50:18 2015 UTC,I thought the poisoning Tywin theory was about Oberyn?
pureasoiaf,3aw0it,daninmn,9,Wed Jun 24 11:45:12 2015 UTC,"There are two ""poisoned Tywin"" theories.  The first is that Oberyn was poisoning him. He is the most obvious suspect. Oberyn studied with the Maesters and knows a lot about poison. The Dornish have something of a reputation for using poison, and Oberyn specifically is known to have made use of it (Lord Edgar Yronwood & The Mountain). He has a well-established beef with the Lannisters, specifically Tywin. He's hot headed and thirsty for revenge. Etc.  So he certainly has means, motive, and opportunity to have poisoned Tywin. And killing Tywin could have prompted a ""trial by combat"" with The Mountain.  However, arguments against his involvement would be that all the times he used poison in the past were by poisoning his weapon in a fight, not by slipping it into someone's drink. He REALLY wants a public confession for the death of his sister. Quietly poisoning Tywin in a way that doesn't easily trace back to him doesn't really seem like his style. If anything, secretly poisoning Tywin would be counter-productive to his goals, because a dead man can't be publicly humiliated or provide the satisfaction of confessing to his crimes, or helplessly watch his family be destroyed.  Plus, being such an obvious suspect also makes Oberyn a pretty good cover if someone else wanted to poison Tywin. Which is where the second theory (Qyburn) comes in.  Qyburn ALSO has considerable knowledge of and access to poison, and plenty of opportunity to poison Tywin. He has definitely profited from having Cersei in charge rather than Tywin, so even if his motive is less obvious than Oberyn he still has one.   TL;DR Oberyn isn't the only person with means, motive, and opportunity. He's just the most obvious, which also makes him a good fall guy if one of the other suspects wanted to make a move and not get caught."

pureasoiaf,3awhkf,arz1,20,Wed Jun 24 01:42:01 2015 UTC,"I know between AGOT and ACOK a lot of people were rampantly speculating about Stannis, what his role would be in the upcoming books, and what the deal was between him, Tywin, and Jon Arryn. At the end of AGOT, in Tyrion's last chapter, Tywin mentions that he has received reports that Stannis has hired a shadowbinder from Asshai. So there was definitely enough information to make some good guesses.  Additionally, there were three separate references to Robert Arryn being fostered by either Tywin or Stannis, so an astute reader should have been able to pick up, by the end of AGOT, that there was something suspicious going on with Lysa.  And when Sansa is meeting with Dontos in ACOK, he mentions that his ""friend"" is out of the city. There's only one major player in King's Landing who is out of the city at that time – Petyr Baelish. So an astute reader could also probably predict who was going to rescue Sansa, and possibly what some of his motives might be.  However, I think George is just referring to R+L. Almost everyone immediately figured out Jon Snow's parentage pretty much as soon as AGOT came out, and I think George was pretty disappointed about that. He said he was tempted to change things, but then he decided not to, because that would be ""cheating""."
pureasoiaf,3awhkf,ElenTheMellon,8,Wed Jun 24 02:07:30 2015 UTC,"With regard to Sansa, in an old SSM from after ACOK came out, someone asked GRRM if the amethysts in Sansa's hair net were the same ones as Cressen used and he responded ""no comment.""

pureasoiaf,3awhkf,TormundGianstbane,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:07:28 2015 UTC,"This is an old thread, but I'd just like to add that, after finishing ACOK, several things were pretty clear to me.   Robb Stark had somehow broken his marriage pact with Walder Frey. A letter arrives at Harrenhal in Arya's last chapter, after which we see Elmar crying and moaning about how ""we've been dishonored"" and he won't be marrying a princess anymore. Roose Bolton is probably going to betray Robb somehow. Also in Arya's last chapter, we see Roose sending orders of questionable strategic wisdom to Helman Tallhart and Robett Glover, to move south from Darry and seize Duskendale. Then, immediately afterward, we see Roose go out to hunt wolves. We also have enough information to realize that Edmure may have just lost Robb the war. Edmure drove Tywin back at the Red Fork, and then several chapters later Tywin shows up at King's Landing, and successfully defeats Stannis. In Sansa's last chapter, when Dontos gives her the hair net with the purple crystals in it, he really lays it on thick that there's something important about the hair net. If a reader started re-reading the book immediately after reading it for the first time (as many would, if it had just been released and ASOS was not out yet), they would find themselves reading Cressen's prologue chapter almost right away, and would have a good chance of making the connection between the purple crystals described in each."

She did confess about Lancel and  osmund.  She denied any direct involvement in the murder of King Robert or the high septon. She denied any sex while Robert was alive. She denied manipulating the men to inform falsely on margery, most of all she denied that her children were born of incest with Jaime.  The high sparrow forgave her for what she confessed too, especially saying the weakness of women and widows was well known and it was all good. She just had to attone.  Attonment she later found out consisted of her walk.  So she's clear of MOST charges now. She won't be further punished for those.  The trial will still happen for the remaining sins she has denied.

pureasoiaf,3av0mb,Kruppstahlterminator,22,Tue Jun 23 18:56:12 2015 UTC,"Everyone here is talking about how Stannis is not merciful. Let's take a look at some case studies, shall we?  Renly rebels agains Stannis, threatening to kill thousands while a bastard sits the Iron Throne. Stannis's punishment? He offers to make Renly his heir. It's only when Renly turns him down and threatens to attack that Stannis kills him.  Davos commits direct treason by plotting to kill Mel, and again when he frees Edric. Stannis' punishment? A very short stay in prison, followed by a resumption of duties as Hand of the King.  The punishment Stannis gives to Stormlanders who sided with Renly, and Northerners who sided with Robb? Basically nothing.  I ask you: when do we actually see Stannis act without mercy?"
pureasoiaf,3av0mb,Ironhorn,10,Wed Jun 24 10:42:33 2015 UTC,"In the context of crime and punishment, mercy is relative to the punishment you believe is called for.  He probably believes that he showed Davos mercy when he removed some fingers and let him keep his head.  He also made Davos a knight, and later a lord and Hand.  It's been a while since I read the early Davos chapters, but I think Davos feels Stannis was merciful as well."
pureasoiaf,3av0mb,nbrichardson,5,Tue Jun 23 21:25:18 2015 UTC,"This exactly.  Stannis shows mercy to those that are loyal to him.  He had to punish Davos for being a smuggler, because he is a just ruler.  The mercy part was that he just took the fingertips.  At the same time though, this kind of is Stannis' one and only instance that I can think of where he shows mercy...unless you count letting Reek aka Theon Greyjoy live in the sample chapter of TWoW."
pureasoiaf,3av0mb,SpikeBebop27,2,Tue Jun 23 21:54:05 2015 UTC,"This is something I've been wondering about lately...  Yes, we know Davos was a smuggler.  We know he smuggled onions to Stannis during his siege of Storm's End.  That said, do we know of any specific instances of smuggling that Stannis otherwise knew of, in order to charge Davos with the crime and carry out a punishment?  Because to me, that makes a huge difference in how I perceive the finger removal.    If Davos was wanted for crimes beforehand, and essentially turned himself in by bringing supplies to Stannis, then I get it.  I could see how it would be called mercy.   But, if Davos was solely reputed to be a smuggler beforehand, and the smuggling of onions to Stannis was the only instance that was actually known, it's totally different.  In that case, I'd consider Stannis an asshole who cut off a guy's fingers with no evidence.  In all, I've always assumed there was a general knowledge that Davos was a known/recognizable/admitted smuggler, but I can't remember any specific instances or evidence of it.  Did he just admit it to Stannis?"
pureasoiaf,3av0mb,im_at_work_now,6,Tue Jun 23 23:45:52 2015 UTC,"He didn't chop the tips of his fingers off for smuggling onions. That would have been terrible. I think it's suggested that Davos was fairly infamous prior to the rebellion, so Stannis problem knew of him."

I just feel like the trials we've seen in Westeros, even if shams overall, still have specific charges.  ""Being a smuggler"" recently struck me as oddly generic compared to just about every other crime, trial, and banishment we hear about.  I know I'm just overanalyzing, it just made me wonder if I missed an actual description of a specific instance of smuggling."

pureasoiaf,3aqush,nullpointer-,14,Mon Jun 22 19:43:51 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking something similar to this.  Euron is a late entrant into the Game of Thrones, but he's definitely a smarter player than most.  As you've noted, he has three things in his arsenal - information, timing and an understanding of and respect for magic.  Each of them individually makes one an exceptionally strong player, but having all three of them makes Euron's position uniquely strong.  His opportunism behind taking the Reach coincidentally mirrors Balon's plan against the North, in that while the region commits the majority of its forces in the intrigues of the Seven Kingdoms, you swoop in and take them at home.  The motives are mostly as you describe them to be: take one of the most fertile and well-equipped regions of Westeros while the others are suffering.  This puts the Ironborn in an incredible position of strength.  If the Reach's forces come back, Euron takes the food supplies on barges down the Mander and fortifies himself on the Shield Islands (which is why he's sitting there instead of a plain smash-and-grab).  I expect him to smash the weakened Redwyne fleet, who will possibly also encounter Aurane Waters' rogue fleet on their long trip back.  Remember that it was the Crow's Eye who planned some of the most daring successes in the first Greyjoy rebellion (burning the Lannister fleet at anchor in Lannisport).  If the Tyrells leave the Reach in his hands (they do have to deal with an increasingly antsy ally at King's Landing in the shape of the Lannisters) then he is in an incredible position of strength to deal with Danaerys when she eventually returns to Westeros.  As was impressed on Young Griff, it is better to deal with Danaerys as an equal than as a subordinate.  Speaking of Young Griff, the fun part begins in speculating how Euron reacts to the new invasion of the Stormlands and more importantly, the imminent alliance between Aegon and Dorne.  This puts another wildcard with significant military strength on his doorstep.  He could lay low and hope that after securing the alliance, Aegon immediately marches on King's Landing (remember that he's on a schedule too!) and the Tyrells + the Lannisters and Aegon + the Martells bleed each other dry in the ensuing battles before he makes his bigger move on the Reach.  At this point Littlefinger might finally make his move with the knights of the Vale too, or not.  Lots of interesting permutations.  And this is without even considering what happens north of the Neck and at the Wall.  A lot rides on what happens at Oldtown.  Lord Leyton has been a totally unknown quantity so it would be interesting to see how Euron deals with this.  If the Citadel opens to him, I'm sure he'll find extremely good use of the information he'll find there (-cough- the Maesters' antidote to dragons and Targaryen magic -cough-).  Thankfully we have two very interesting POVs (Aeron and Samwell) sitting right at the action!  Throw in the ironborn involvement in both the Battles of Fire and Ice and I'm pretty hyped for The Winds of Winter!"

pureasoiaf,3aqush,Tree_Eyed_Crow,2,Tue Jun 23 13:15:08 2015 UTC,"I dont remember ever seeing any hint that Littlefinger is connected to Ironborn in any way, yet... reading this, especially that part about Euron seemingly possessing a lot of information about inner events and details of many things in the kingdoms.... make me wonder.  Not that everything that happens has to be attributed to Peter but would anyone be surprised if he had some influence on this angle too?  Im not sure how Ironborn can actually conquer all of the Reach. Conquer and hold, as in not just Reeve. Seems they would need much more people to hold such a big area.  What about Lannisport and the Casterly Rock? They also seem very weakened and Ironborn could hold a city or two, instead of whole kingdoms.  What if they just take Highgarden and Casterly Rock? And reeve as much of the rest as they can? They have to stay close to the sea otherwise they loose their main and only advantage. They are not fit to wage ground wars or hold big pieces of land far away from the sea.  I dont think its fair to say Daenerys is uninterested in using more of the magic. Its more like she doesnt know much about it or simply doesnt think about it yet, ... as much as she seemingly doesnt think about history of her house or getting any details about that and Westeros whatsoever from Barristan Selmy. Which is a complete fault of the writer, not the character.  I also dont think Euron send her the fleet to help her or because he knew she will need a fleet. Its not like he has anything else to send. And Victarion is there to take, not help.  Anyway, it will be interesting, hopefully, to see if Euron actually has any kind of smart plan except going around naked and being all edgy and so dark and ""badass""."

I don't think so. They have not been players all along, but not in the Game of Thrones. They all know that the important thing is not the Iron Throne, but larger more powerful forces, like the Others, powerful wargs like Bran, Dragons, and prophecies. The Hightowers don't care if a Lannister, Baratheon, or Tyrell sits the Iron Throne. Neither does BR, Marvin or Quathe. And I suspect that Euron has ambitions that go beyond the Iron Throne as well.    inally, he also proved to have a great knowledge of the political situation of each place:   That, and a lot of other things could be explained if he had a glass candle. He could follow Vic without leaving his troupes, or if he follows Vic by himself, he can keep in touch with his commanders in the Reach that way. He also would know a lot of what else is going on everywhere.    using strategies - both mudane and magical - that were never succesfully used.

They worship the same god, but Mel is acting on her own, where as Morqorro is aligned to the official priesthood, and is acting on their orders. Considering they differ on a major issue like the identity of the world's savior Azor Ahai, I think we can separate Mel and her Queen's Men into their own faction.  Source for Mel doing her own thing:   Why did Melisandre seek out Stannis? Did she see him in her flames and decided to seek him out on her own, or is she on a mission on behalf of the red priests? It doesn't seem at any point as if the latter is the case, when you compare to Moqorro who has been sent out by the priesthood.  You're right.

Also, Dany's and Arianne/Areo's chapters may have seemed kind of confusing and pointless the first time around, but keeping in mind that Dany's are supposed to be alienating because you're reading from her POV where she has no clue what's going on and reading it into yourself, you can draw out a lot more detail. See if you can puzzle out Arianne's informer and who is or are behind the Sons of the Harpy (there's no canonical answer yet, so it's a fun open-ended whodunnit that requires attention to detail and may even one day have a solution if we're lucky).

I guess I'm getting too is that I always have this back thought that all power is actually rooted with the Old Gods. CotF seemingly have some elemental control, as do the wierwoods. They can obviously extend life, maybe that power isn't unique or simply used one way. Let's say the blood of the wierwood is actually all that revives people, and it's possible Bendric and Thoros simply used that in some fashion. Cat did have plenty of interaction with the wierwood post Ned, and prior. Besides her and the Mountain, no one else has come back. Maybe the blood is something Qyburn used to ""revive"" him.  GRRM has a way of showing you obvious things, that in the end are simple, but so easily overlooked with his incredible misdirection.

I've always felt AA is R'hollor, and that the God himself is just a misinterpretation of the powers that the single GO/DG/FG actually grants. AA is a sort of a loophole that can harm this God's will, which might be something the Others don't want happening, along with the CotF/wierwoods.  To simplify, I've always felt that GRRM knows fantasy so well that he knows how to worldcraft in a way that hits every mark perfectly. This is why his Gods and Magic are so fucking interesting, and used sparingly. Ive always felt the bittersweet ending he's always implied will be a complete destruction of the many faced god by AA, effectively destroying all magic and dragons and everything for all time.

pureasoiaf,3aplgh,TheJankins,3,Mon Jun 22 20:25:28 2015 UTC,I believe The Song of Ice and Fire to be the intersection of two opposing forces that are backed and propelled by people who subscribe to these irreconcilable paradigms.  On one hand you have the Fire/Reaction factions and on the other side you have Ice/Eternity with Earth as the fulcrum.  This is represented in the Ironborn religion as well as R'hllorism. Azor Ahai is meant to make the world anew and the Lord of Light is opposed by his eternal enemy the Great Other. We see a parralel with the Storm God and the Drowned God locked in eternal combat. Storms are similar to fire in that both are reactions that destroy and 'clear the slate'. Both the Drowned God and the Great Other are eternal and unchanging with water being the primary element.  Danny's arc is one of reaction and rebirth. She is destroying the Essosi way of life that has existed for thousands of years and facilitating change.  Aerons arc is about reviving the past: the Old Way is eternal and undying and rises again harder and stronger than before similar to the return of the Others.

pureasoiaf,3arbx5,quillquip,4,Tue Jun 23 03:40:09 2015 UTC,I choose to believe that GRRM was saying no about the reason Bran doesn't recognize him and he just didn't answer the part about Benjen.   But that's just wishful thinking
pureasoiaf,3arbx5,GaidenShinji,3,Tue Jun 23 23:18:57 2015 UTC,Maybe Coldhands is BR warged into a wight.

pureasoiaf,3arbx5,Samsonslocks,2,Mon Jun 22 23:00:20 2015 UTC,"Cold hands has been around for decades at the VERY least, what do you think?"
pureasoiaf,3arbx5,Shirayuri,2,Tue Jun 23 09:54:00 2015 UTC,Are we sure that it has been actually decades or is that just from his prospective if it is benjen then he probably had died at one point. while he was dead it may have felt as if years had passed so from his point of view it would have felt like decades.
pureasoiaf,3arbx5,hamishwilson,5,Tue Jun 23 10:01:36 2015 UTC,The Children of the Forest describe him as very old. It's not Benjen.  Edit: He's probably just a wight that Bloodraven wargs into to do his footwork because he can't leave the cave. It's the simplest explanation.
pureasoiaf,3arbx5,GaidenShinji,2,Tue Jun 23 12:37:44 2015 UTC,"She says they killed him long ago. and she was talking to Bran and crew so she might have said that because it was so long for them, not to her."
pureasoiaf,3arbx5,hamishwilson,2,Tue Jun 23 23:21:23 2015 UTC,But it wouldn't be long for Bran and crew. Benjen's only been missing since the first book.
pureasoiaf,3arbx5,GaidenShinji,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:07:28 2015 UTC,Well its been like 3 years and considering all that's happened and since Brans like 11 you could argue it would be log for them. But honestly I'm just grasping at straws cause I want benjen to be coldhands
pureasoiaf,3arbx5,hamishwilson,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:14:21 2015 UTC,"GRRM has mentioned this already. Someone in r/asoiaf put up the notes on the manuscript for one of the books, and his editor puts a note next to Coldhands saying something like 'I think this is Benjen' and GRRM put a note next to is saying its not.

It hasn't been mentioned yet though. Any comments?  Nope. Keep reading.  Also, I believe that Coldhands is Benjen Stark. Can you confirm this?  See previous answer.'  The previous answer being 'Nope.

pureasoiaf,3arbx5,hamishwilson,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:05:36 2015 UTC,"I think that's grasping. He put's the 'No' right next to the Benjen comment, and if he was saying 'No' to the question of Bran not recognising Benjen because his face was covered, what does that mean? He doesn't recognise him because his face isn't covered? It doesn't make sense."

I feel he will have an interesting link to the history of the realm.  Perhaps somehow tied to the D&E series and is at least a Stark or a Targaryan (think I Stark is more likely though).  I kind of worry how we left Coldhands that GRRM will leave him without any resolution at all.

The most heart wrenching one is when Jaime meets the Blackfish at Riverrun to discuss terms, and Jaime tells him he can go to the Wall to be with Ned Starks bastard, who is now Lord Commander. Brynden replies with something along the line of:  'It seems Catelyn dislike of him was right, he's probably in league with the Lannisters to get that position'.  I was like, 'Noooooo Brynden!

Sometimes you just fulfill it in other ways.   Martin used the example of a man prophesied to die below the walls of a certain castle. He avoided the castle his whole life, but finally died in front of an Inn with a picture of the castle on its sign. This has the same sort of payoff in that Cersei is the architect of her own downfall. I like it.   Seconding how badly we need that book."

pureasoiaf,3alhnw,ElenTheMellon,5,Tue Jul 7 09:26:41 2015 UTC,I love this idea. Cersei would never think of beauty as being in the eye of the beholder.

pureasoiaf,3alhnw,ElenTheMellon,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:31:58 2015 UTC,"I think in the end there will be no definitive answer, we will be able to see Cersei herself, Brienne, Arianne and Sansa as the younger more beautiful. Brienne often gets called the beauty, so she would fit it in the most ironic GRRM way. Also, she is positioned to take Jamie away from her for good. Sansa is in position to gain real political power, and end the Tyrell/Lannister rule. The same goes for Arianne. But if Jamie really is the Valancor, Brienne will be the most deciding younger one."
pureasoiaf,3alhnw,FuriousFap42,2,Mon Jun 22 18:39:56 2015 UTC,"I should clarify that, while I think Brienne is the YAMB, I don't think Jaime is the valonqar. I think Tommen is.

I think the golden hand actually counts against Jaime being the valonqar.   the irony that not Tyrion was the one she should have worried about   That's still fulfilled by Tommen, though."
pureasoiaf,3alhnw,ElenTheMellon,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:50:34 2015 UTC,"Yes it could, but it be more fitting from my perspective if they also cause that together, if jelasy is involved, or their separation emotionally from each other, if Jamie goes from totally disillusion, to needing to kill her.   Well that makes it harder physically, but not impossible, and he would feel nothing in that hand, which would fit his situation with Cersie at that point.   Not really that much. She always hated and abused Tyrion, and relied on Jamie, that irony is way stronger"
pureasoiaf,3alhnw,FuriousFap42,11,Wed Jun 24 01:37:18 2015 UTC,I'd like to think its Breanne. She is described as Breanne the Beauty. She is taking Jamie away. As far as the kids I have nothing that I can think of
pureasoiaf,3alhnw,ToaD555,3,Wed Jun 24 10:48:09 2015 UTC,That's actually a pretty solid theory. She's pretty much dug her own grave up until this point.
pureasoiaf,3alhnw,bfisher91,7,Sun Jun 21 15:06:43 2015 UTC,I fully agree. To me it's the perfect example of a self-fulfilling prophecy.
pureasoiaf,3alhnw,sweetyft,2,Sun Jun 21 23:19:42 2015 UTC,I think it equally likely that the woman to cast Cersei down is either Brienne or Daenerys.  I'm Leaning towards Brienne the Beauty because Dany seems too obvious and because I think it will be related to Jaime being the Valenquar.
pureasoiaf,3alhnw,Gigglestomp123,2,Sun Jun 21 15:13:38 2015 UTC,"I tend to think it will be left to the reader to decide which individual who fits the prophecy is the one, so really in essence there isn't just one. It's already come to pass in the forms of Margaery and Brienne.  Eventually it'll probably include Daenerys, depending upon how things go it could also include Sansa, Arianne...  The thing with it is that much like her paranoid inability to bond with her siblings as siblings, to build normal healthy alliances within her family, will likely be what has created the valonqar, her paranoid intolerance for the presence of any woman who could conceivably compete with her for male attention of any kind has created a situation in which numerous women fit this profile. If she could tolerate Margaery, she would have a really great and well-adjusted daughter in law, and a useful one at that. If she hadn't tried to completely subsume Jaime into herself, Brienne wouldn't be the lifeline he's using to extricate himself and provide him with an example of a woman whose twin he really really wants to be (no matter how you interpret their relationship or see it going). He wouldn't have to be fighting to be his own person/the kind of man he wants to be, if she'd allowed room for that in the first place. Etc etc.  I do think Jaime is the valonqar, and I think he will kill Cersei to save Brienne somehow, whether it's about abandoning her to her fate and allowing her to die or actively killing her, which will tie the two prophecies together...but just like I think Tyrion will have something to do with her downfall, all the other women she's made enemies of in her jealousy and paranoia will contribute in their own way. Every man she's tried to control will ultimately escape her, will ultimately choose some other woman over her. The only man she's ever met that she didn't dismiss outright, try to control, or try to destroy, is her father. Every man she has ever tried to control, brother, son, cousin, non-relative lover, husband...every single one has chosen/will choose allegiance with some other woman over her."

Before that, there were not often all out wars among the kingdoms which threatened the royal families them selfs. The Starks never left the North and no one got past Moat Cailin. The Gardener kings were unchallenged in the Reach since they married among all the other houses in the Reach, and the Reach is extremely powerful militarily. The Lannisters have Casterly Rock, which is impregnable, and they have their source of power close to home, their gold mines. Dorne has its deserts, the Vale it's mountains and the Riverlands have been fucked over and over again. Great houses there went extinct, like Mud and Justman. But the other kingdoms, and their Royal families were fine, until the continent united, and they rode to war outside their kingdoms. The wars before that, were about borders and territory, like the sisters, and very rarely someone ventured that far outside his own kingdom like the young wolf. War outside, makes you vulnerable inside your kingdom, and second houses fall in your back."

pureasoiaf,3an44n,repo_sado,7,Sun Jun 21 22:29:07 2015 UTC,"I think that there must have been instances in these houses' long histories when the families were wiped out to the point where nobody bearing their surname was still alive (like what will happen if Sweetrobin dies), but some distant cousin (like Harry Hardyng in the case of the Arryns) stepped in as the heir, and had their name changed (e.g. to Harry Arryn) to make their claim look more legitimate."

They hang on for thousands of years. That is just not realistic really. Between marriages, infertility, disease, war, rebellion, famine, etc... you would think more of these houses would have died out.

For the first couple of years after the show started, it was still a great place for discussion of the books, while almost all Game of Thrones discussion was kept in r/gameofthrones.  The sub was pretty good about self-policing when it came to keeping the show out.  Then Game of Thrones blew up, and a million idiots descended onto r/asoiaf, because r/gameofthrones wasn't big enough for all of them.  Many of us fought the good fight for a while, not wanting to abandon our sub to the memeing masses without shedding some enemy blood.  But it was in vain.    So we came here."

The sort of low effort material I would go to /r/gameofthrones to see,  and it seems to be getting worse as the show catches up with us.   Also a lot of blatant show exclusive posters within the sub, sparking discussion which has little to no regard for the books."

They've outright ignored the Maester Conspiracy or the two different versions of Braavos that Arya and Dany see or fact that neither Jon or Dany appear to be good leaders.  That or they try to figure out how to undo everything they don't agree with, like reforging Ice, proving Varys led to a dying man, bringing back Sandor as the Hound, etc."

pureasoiaf,3ak0xk,Sao_Gage,21,Sat Jun 20 23:23:55 2015 UTC,"I think the reason AFFC/ADWD take so much abuse is that they come right after the most adventurous book in the series, ASOS.   When you compare books 1/2 against books 4/5, it's a very tough call for me. I really do enjoy the first two books, especially ACOK. I think I'm simply more interested in AFFC/ADWD right now, mostly because they contain the currently relevant plot lines heading into TWOW. They're newer. I've had less time to digest them, so it's easier to  dive into them and learn new things."
pureasoiaf,3ak0xk,JewBot6000,9,Sat Jun 20 23:48:06 2015 UTC,I thought AFFC just felt like filler material but the other books were great.
pureasoiaf,3ak0xk,sprite3,11,Sun Jun 21 03:34:32 2015 UTC,I just reread AFFC and I disagree. Plot-advancement aside- and there is plenty of that- GRRM explores the effect of a protracted war on the small folk. It makes the entire world richer.
pureasoiaf,3ak0xk,nbrichardson,4,Sun Jun 21 04:59:56 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm expecting it to be better on a re-read. I think I was impatient for my favourite storylines to come back.
pureasoiaf,3ak0xk,sprite3,8,Sun Jun 21 05:16:21 2015 UTC,affc is by far the one that improves on reread. it is hurt on initial read by missing out on the missing povs and rushing through it ruins a lot of it because its not as simple as the earlier books. but on second and third time through......it's great
pureasoiaf,3ak0xk,repo_sado,8,Sun Jun 21 22:31:02 2015 UTC,"I think it's very difficult to compare the two pairs of books, because they're very different. AGOT and ACOK are focused, tightly-plotted, solid books that move the story along at a good pace and keep you invested in all the characters. AFFC and ADWD and massive, sprawling, indulgent epics containing some of the richest worldbuilding, interwoven themes, most beautiful prose, most compelling characterisation - but also the most filler, most unlikeable and disposable characters, and a vaguer sense of direction than any before.   While I have nothing negative to say about AGOT/ACOK, they do not reach the same heights as AFFC/ADWD. Stories such as Cersei's downfall or Theon's identity arc are easily among the best parts of the series, and the themes of leadership, identity, duty, being haunted by the past, woven throughout the characters, make them an incredibly rich read. I'll find myself poring over passages in these books time and time again, while I rarely feel compelled to go back to the first two unless I'm doing a full re-read.  But at the same time, AFFC/ADWD contain some of the worst parts of the series. Martin's indulgences are never more evident, as he takes us on a historical tour of Essos, taking well over a dozen chapters detailing the trips of Tyrion, Quentyn and Victarion to Meereen, or Brienne in the Riverlands - the kind of thing that would be better off skipped or massively condensed. While the worldbuilding is nice and all, it's rather disposable, and the kind of stuff that should really be in AWOIAF, rather than the main series. It distracts from the main plots and dilutes the strengths of the book. The ""minor POVs"" are equally indulgent and are a big part of why plots like Iron Islands and Dorne feel so disposable, because we spend too much time pissing around in Areo Camera's head when we could be getting to know Arianne better (who is the heart and central character of that arc).   It is down to poor editing, a lack of ruthlessness in cutting material, and perhaps a little self-important indulgence, that keep AFFC/ADWD from being incredible books, because some of the best material in the series is there. ACOK/AGOT are solid 8/10, while the others vary from 10/10 to 5/10 depending on which parts you focus on.   ASOS, of course, is just flawless all the way through."
pureasoiaf,3ak0xk,thevoid68,3,Sun Jun 21 09:45:27 2015 UTC,that is a good way to put it. i would also say that agot is 100% successful at what it tries to do. affc and adwd are not completely in successfull in their efforts but they attempt to do so much more.
pureasoiaf,3ak0xk,repo_sado,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:32:30 2015 UTC,"The only thing that bothers me about AGoT is the direwolves. A huge lapse in logic for the series (just going by the logic of cool, and being overly thematic), and then having no real use of them other than the occasional warg dream to remind us that they still exist."
pureasoiaf,3ak0xk,vokkan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:04:54 2015 UTC,"Depends on if you think Jon's last words were him warging into Ghost, or George himself calling Nymeria's wolf army in the riverlands ""chekov's gun"" or you believe Bran is going to warg into a dragon or that Summer saved Catelyn and Bran in aGoT, or that Shaggydog being with Rickon is vital for the conspiring Northerner's so others will have no doubts about his true identity, or that the Stark's have a magical ability in the bloodlines due to being related to the Other's/Children of the Forest and/or First Men."
pureasoiaf,3ak0xk,sihtdaertnod,4,Fri Jun 26 20:28:54 2015 UTC,"My favourite storylines are Dorne, Ironborn and the Northern conspiracy, so I'd be inclined to agree."
pureasoiaf,3ak0xk,Cathsaigh,3,Sun Jun 21 11:29:18 2015 UTC,I like them more than aCoK but aGoT I felt was stronger than both.   For me it goes:   Storm > Thrones > Dance > Feast > Clash
pureasoiaf,3ak0xk,utnahpishtim,3,Mon Jun 22 16:17:27 2015 UTC,"I'm re-reading them right now, and every time I enjoy them more. They're proving to me to hold up better over time than the did in the immediate aftermath.  While they may not move the plot like the first 3, and they do have problems with bloat and repetition, they feature much better pure writing and the characterization is outstanding. I don't think it's crazy to believe they are better than the first two books."
pureasoiaf,3ak0xk,Bojangles1987,8,Tue Jun 23 15:38:21 2015 UTC,I have to disagree. AFFC/ADWD are nowhere near as good as the first three books. They get harshly criticized and rightfully so. In the criticism almost any praise is drowned out though and that's why they seem to be so hated. A lot of interesting stuff happens in these two books with Arya/Jon/Jaime/Bran/Cersei/Sam. It's some of the best material in the series.   Meereen and the Ironborn stuff is complete trash though and takes up a lot of damn time. I enjoy world building as much as the next person but the ironborn in AFFC are just awful. In a world with the Others and Dragons I don't care about a bunch of stupid pirates and their stupid rituals. I also didn't have to read about Danny being an incompetent ruler and Tyrion's wacky wild ride to Meereen.   There's enough legitimately great content in AFFC/ADWD to make ONE good book. Unfortunately there are two books with a lot of fluff in them that make them a pain in the ass to read. A lot of that iron born stuff could have been published in a book like The World of Ice and Fire if GRRM really wanted to tell us about his beloved pirates. The Danny storyline and Tyrion storyline could have also been trimmed down by a lot.   So I have to disagree. They're two extremely frustrating books to me because had they been properly edited/trimmed down the fourth book could have been amazing but we got two mediocre books instead.
pureasoiaf,3ak0xk,testcartest,4,Sun Jun 21 01:54:17 2015 UTC,I agree with you to a certain extent. I didn't really like the ironborn I don't hate them just I feel they are bogus. Now regarding Tyrion and Dany I have to disagree. I liked reading them it built their characters that much more. Maybe some parts were not necessary but overall I think it was good.
pureasoiaf,3ak0xk,Senor_Yosh,4,Sun Jun 21 03:38:30 2015 UTC,"That's fair, your thoughts are in line with the majority of the fanbase so your opinions certainly aren't unfounded. But that's just thing, I enjoyed the stories in Dorne and in the Iron Islands just as much if not more than anything in the first two books. It rounded out Westeros for me and they were the two major houses almost entirely absent until Feast. I do feel they both have major parts to play, and both stories tie directly into Dany. I don't know how to articulate it, but they simply worked for me and it was a pleasure to read (and re-read as I'm doing now)."
pureasoiaf,3ak0xk,divinesleeper,3,Sun Jun 21 17:31:03 2015 UTC,"I agree that the Ironborn aren't too interesting, but I liked seeing Dany stumble in Mereen. It'd be stupid if she became a perfect idealistic ruler, she has to learn what it means to be Queen.  Watching her balance idealism and pragmaticism while emphasizing that she's only a girl going through puberty (ie Daario) was interesting enough. At least we're done with that now and she can complete her arc by going full badass (or full crazy, depending on how her struggles worked out for her).  Can't wait to see what she does in the next book."
pureasoiaf,3ak0xk,testcartest,2,Sun Jun 21 18:24:03 2015 UTC,She could have stumbled as a leader while on her way to Westeros or something. I just found the Meereen pitstop boring.
pureasoiaf,3ak0xk,divinesleeper,2,Tue Jun 23 19:44:10 2015 UTC,"I like that she's building up a big reputation before going to Westeros, that way when she arrives she'll be like the Targaryans of old (Aegon I and sisters). I want her to be overwhelming and absolutely unstoppable when she arrives.  She won't just be another player, she'll be a gamechanger.  And with Tyrion and Barristan by her side, it'll be all the more sweet."
pureasoiaf,3ak0xk,Bojangles1987,2,Tue Jun 23 20:26:14 2015 UTC,"While I don't like the Ironborn themselves except for Asha, who I really like, they are literally the crows in A Feast for Crows, along with the outlaws Brienne comes across. So I appreciated their role in the story.  Tyrion did have huge problems. His chapters just do not freaking end sometimes. The Illyrio stuff is just torturous."
pureasoiaf,3ak0xk,vokkan,2,Tue Jun 23 15:44:23 2015 UTC,"I enjoy world building as much as the next person but the ironborn in AFFC are just awful.   How convenient that there's just 5 ironborn chapters in total then (out of 46), with the final one declaring that they are going to steal Danys dragons to boot!"
pureasoiaf,3ak0xk,Ruddy_Hall,2,Tue Jun 23 19:40:28 2015 UTC,"How would you define the strength of a book? AGOT definitely is not as air-tight as the latter in the series but the story is paced well. ADWD begins to marry political intrigue and high fantasy beautifully but there's too many characters that I began to feel detatched from the narrative.   IMO, the best written stories of GRRM are the Dunk & Egg tales."
pureasoiaf,3ak0xk,itsalwaysbeen,2,Mon Jun 22 14:23:39 2015 UTC,"I think the obvious-ness and simplicties of (as you called it) the WOTFK trilogy is what people liked so much. It was a near constant barage of new characters and events that deeply changed the events in the world. As others here have called it, it was more pure drama. I think these new books are practically pure fantasy at this point, and I think that turns a lot of people off. As you said, the first three were catalysts to some of the greatest fantasy ever told, but I (and you) seem to think those stories didn't hit till books 4 forward."
pureasoiaf,3ak0xk,TheRealSlimStannis,2,Mon Jun 22 20:47:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but ASOS is the best. Only reason I don't like the last two is Arya's plot"
pureasoiaf,3ak0xk,pitaenigma,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:09:07 2015 UTC,"I would go as far as saying they are better than ASOS, though more flawed in parts."
pureasoiaf,3ak0xk,Charlemagne_III,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:44:37 2015 UTC,I think A Feast for Crows is the worst book in the entire series; the way it is written leaves out so many characters you know and just leaves you confused for quite a while.  I believe it opened with like 3 chapters from characters you have never met.
pureasoiaf,3ajo6p,Willow536,43,Sat Jun 20 21:18:24 2015 UTC,"Barristan stays as a member of the Small Council. This is quite important as the hand of the king has just died, so there is need to keep some good men in the capital.  Also, Bobby B is one to want to get away and mentions being surrounded by too many people (when he and Ned go riding iirc), and at this point the realm is in peace so he feels quite safe.   I guess he thought the Viper's Nest that KL is is more dangerous than the long road to Winterfell to see his good old pal Ned."

pureasoiaf,3ajo6p,frapalinger,2,Sat Jun 20 22:34:14 2015 UTC,"Excellent point.  When you go back and look at it, its further demonstration that Robert was completely neglectful and Cersei was more powerful at Court."

pureasoiaf,3ajo6p,Oraukk,2,Sun Jun 21 21:33:09 2015 UTC,I disagree. They didn't have to introduce them all by name for ten o be present.
pureasoiaf,3ajo6p,Ironhorn,3,Mon Jun 22 17:43:22 2015 UTC,Didn't have to... but when would GRRM ever neglect to give you the name and backstory of every character present in a scene?
pureasoiaf,3ajo6p,skyrim360,3,Wed Jun 24 10:47:50 2015 UTC,I would also like to add that he fully trusted Ned Stark so why would he need protection. At this time no wars have started and the kings road is as safe as can be so why bother brining them all.

pureasoiaf,3ajrco,OfTheShire,19,Sat Jun 20 21:48:52 2015 UTC,"The Greatjon branched off after the Battle of Oxcross and was busy sacking the minor gold-mines of the Westerlands.  As for the Blackfish, he wasn't mentioned in the part describing the Storming of the Crag.  This makes sense as you probably won't need scouts in a siege / frontal assault on a castle.  I can only assume that he would have been out on reconnaissance missions, rather than being by Robb's bedside.  Moreover, since Robb is their liege, feudal norms dictate that they keep their disapproval to themselves.  Essentially, Catelyn is probably the only person who could get away with openly admonishing Robb.  Guys higher up in the chain of command like Roose and Rickard Karstark also only shared their counsel when asked for it."

The Star Wars books are cool if you like them too, but only a few are canon still. I'd also suggest Asimov's works if you haven't read them either.  Edit 2: I forgot about the Starwolf trilogy.

pureasoiaf,3ae13s,HiverR,30,Fri Jun 19 10:31:47 2015 UTC,"A couple of quotes from GRRM on the topic   1 From an interview you can find here   There are several competing religions in this series now. Should we be wondering if some are more true than others? In a world with magic, is religion just magic with an extra layer of mythos?  Well, the readers are certainly free to wonder about the validity of these religions, the truth of these religions, and the teachings of these religions. I'm a little leery of the word ""true"" — whether any of these religions are more true than others. I mean, look at the analogue of our real world. We have many religions too. Are some of them more true than others? I don't think any gods are likely to be showing up in Westeros, any more than they already do. We're not going to have one appearing, deus ex machina, to affect the outcomes of things, no matter how hard anyone prays. So the relation between the religions and the various magics that some people have here is something that the reader can try to puzzle out.   2 From So Spake Martin http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1308   NORESCON (BOSTON, MA; SEPTEMBER 2-6) George was on a panel at Worldcon about this exact subject [creating gods in fantasy]. He said that in the real world he doesn't see gods, but he does see religions...and he creates religions, not gods.  The other folks on the panel then went on as to how to make gods-as-characters work in a fantasy world...when George was asked about it later at one of the parties he scoffed - ""You can't have gods as characters! That just doesn't work."" (paraphrased).  Now, as to whether or not this means gods exist in Westeros is still up for debate. But it seems fairly clear that it means they don't exist as beings that can come down from on high and play with the mortals."
pureasoiaf,3ae13s,RMoncho,3,Fri Jun 19 11:38:23 2015 UTC,"But George does have gods as characters. Bloodraven is quite obviously an Old God, or at least an embodiment of one.   I like Sanderson's approach (not to say it's wholly original) in Stormlight Archive. There was a god, but he's dead, if you want you can try to figure out why and how he died."
pureasoiaf,3ae13s,PWL73316,12,Sat Jun 20 01:58:34 2015 UTC,Bloodraven and now Bran being Old Gods is more about the fact that the Old Gods are just people than that Bloodraven and Bran are gods.

To attempt to answer your question directly: the religions are based on the prophesies.  To attempt a more indirect but precise description: just as science does (even in the world of Essos) these religions are merely attempting to explain the events that happen in the world.  They are the way that the characters interpret the events around them, from being able to subsist on ocean water, to dragons being born in fire.  Given Martin's previous work, he probably doesn't have a shrine to any one of the gods in his home.    Other than the god of death, and that just says ""not today""."

pureasoiaf,3ae13s,Zorro_Darksauce,8,Sat Jun 20 08:07:03 2015 UTC,"That there are no gods, just magic, is pretty well-accepted throughout the fan community. The closest thing we know of to gods are the old gods of the north, who we've now learned aren't really gods at all.   I'm more skeptical of the prophecies assertion. In particular, the Azor Ahai one. Obviously we'll see in the next book (knock on wood) and I'm not at all certain that the prophecy will prove accurate, but it does look an awful lot like Jon Snow is shaping up to be the manifestation of that particular prophecy.  However, prophecies/visions/etc. in these books roughly fall into two categories. First, there are the vague but perfectly accurate predictions which are basically there for the benefit of readers going back a second time. We have the foretellings of the Red Wedding in Patchface's ramblings and Dany's visions, hints at R+L=J in Dany's visions, Old Nan's stories proving true, and stuff like that. Characters usually don't pay much, if any, attention to these, despite how accurate they turn out to be.  On the other hand, there are the prophecies that drive characters, and are generally not shown to be reliable or accurate. This is where the prophecies you mentioned come in: Azor Ahai, the Prince that was Promised, Three Heads has the Dragon, Three Treasons You Will Know, Until the Sun Sets in the West and Rises in the East, To Go West You Must Go East, Gold Crowns Gold Shrouds/Valonqar/Younger More Beautiful Queen...and so on.   These prophecies, I think, exist not to be fulfilled or broken, but to drive characters and the story. Maybe they will come true in some twisted way, maybe they will not, but the point is that characters become obsessed with them and make decisions based on them."

Please explain the difference between a god and a worshipped spirit.   Herakles was a half god. Not A God. Like his father.   Source please. Mine:   Heracles became a god, living in Olympus, because he had performed the twelve labours and aiding the gods in their war against the Giants. Since he saved Hera from being rape by the giant Porphyrion, Hera had little choice but to reconcile with Heracles. Hera allowed the hero to marry her daughter, Hebe, goddess of youth, and Heracles became father of Alexiares and Anicetus.   http://www.timelessmyths.com/classical/heracles.html#AmongGods   Heracles, Gatekeeper of Olympus, God of strength, heroes, sports, athletes, health, agriculture, fertility, trade, oracles and divine protector of mankind   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heracles  The examples of Norse and Irish mythology and folklore show that some gods can age or be killed, which disputes your claim that they are cosmic beings of extra-worldly origin and nature."

While he lived his life he was a sort of really strong guy. Not A God. Like his father. And those titles he ""got"" ""after"" are clearly in direct opposition with several previously established ancient Greek deities. So whats up with that?  The examples of Norse and Irish mythology you mentioned do not disprove they were not of the ""cosmic extra-worldly origin and nature"" in any way. Supernatural would be a good expression to use, btw.  You are grasping for straws in sheer desperation to force some nonsensical idea to be right no matter what.

For that matter - who did Pyat Pree and the Qartheen nightshade-drinking warlocks worship, if anyone?  Maybe R'hllor is some long-dead blood magician who left a major impression on his followers.  Same with the Drowned God/Storm God, though I do believe the former is explicitly linked with the also rather Lovecraftian Stranger and by extension the Many-Faced God.

As far as I know, people genuinely believe that R'hllor and the Drowned God are the only true gods, with Patchface being the champion of the Drowned God, and both gods being able to bring people back to life through Thoros and Aeron Greyjoy.

Minor additional point, to be fair to LSH, even though I think she has gone overboard: I find it an often ignored but interesting factoid that Roose, as he stabbed Rob, said ""Jaime Lannister sends his regards."" This, to Cat, links Jaime directly to the RW, and thus makes Brienne slightly more culpable in LSH's eyes (as well as, I think, causing inconceivable guilt on Cat's part for letting Jaime go)"
pureasoiaf,3ac3j9,Ironhorn,19,Thu Jun 18 23:05:22 2015 UTC,"Ya. Its pretty easy to see how she came to this conclusion, Lannisters have a bit of a history with first-hand involvement with the death of her loved ones.  The guilt for releasing Jamie is an interesting angle I hadn't considered."

In the book Roose specifies Jaime because he had captured him, after Cat had freed him, and let him go again because he was secretly in cahoots with Tywin. Jaime didn't know that though and thought that Robb was holding to the deal he had made with Cat, so he told Roose to send Robb his 'regards' for giving him a chance. Roose twisted its meaning by saying it while killing Robb."
pureasoiaf,3ac3j9,BellyFullOfSwans,41,Sat Jul 11 22:16:59 2015 UTC,"Consider Beric Dondarrion's famous ""Are you my mother, Thoros?"" monologue and our knowledge that you never quite come back from death the way you went into it.  The Catelyn we knew wouldnt have the power or the reason to be this bloodthirsty....but we do know she was VENGEFUL to the core.  She was rude to Jon and she kept him at an arm's distance his whole life (certainly adding to his exclusion from the family and decision to take The Black).  This same woman, when ""off a notch"" because of a slight case of death and resurrection, who has semi-knowledge of the death/loss of all of her children......I could buy that.  I think I could buy that out of Cat if she had survived the Red Wedding and found similar circumstances in the aftermath and became leader of The Brotherhood."

Basically they're the ur-example of the house that suffers from the Game of Thrones. They start out as sort of a middling house with powerful friends. They keep marrying in, and eventually get wealth beyond their station thanks to Corlys the Sea Snake. And then everything goes to shit. Corlys sees his line end, and his naturalborn sons inherit Driftmark. The Oakenfist is the last of the great Velaryons; after that, they've sunk into relative obscurity. An old house, but one that has felt the turning of the wheel."

pureasoiaf,3aacjd,hamishwilson,8,Thu Jun 18 14:34:38 2015 UTC,Melee is different than just swords (though I see the OPs post has changed).   I think a lot of Brienne's advantage comes from people underestimating her.
pureasoiaf,3aacjd,Stauncho,18,Thu Jun 18 15:06:28 2015 UTC,"Perhaps. The melee in question is in Renly's camp. She is the last standing of like, 160+ fighters. So even if the first 75 or so were caught off guard, surely Loras would have a healthy respect for her prowess by the time it was just them. Loras also unarms Brianne, so by all accounts it seemed as though he was going to succeed. She ultimately won by unhorsing him through sheer brutality and making him yield at knife point."

Hotah if we count axes and Daario if we count arakhs"

He is chaotic, he is seemingly evil, and he has a name that people flock to. He may not be able to call banners but he is poison in the midst of the Dornish nobility. He's a man who could have sparked a war on Dorne if he'd cut Myrcella's throat and not her face - he in that example was the most dangerous man to Dorne.

pureasoiaf,3aacjd,FuriousFap42,8,Thu Jun 18 15:14:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think Rhaegar was that great; anyway, he's dead so doesn't count.  Sandor is technically dead, or at least not fighting anytime soon.  Considering Benjen as alive, he wasn't mentioned as a great fighter. Halfhand was way more recognized.  Mance was better than Jon, but it doesn't mean he was that good.  I don't think Wun Wun could count. Giants best advantage is size, obviously. But Mag the Mighty was considered the greatest giant warrior, and he was killed by a single man I don't see them as a good fighters."
pureasoiaf,3aacjd,Innocents_Suffer,11,Thu Jun 18 15:23:24 2015 UTC,"But Mag the Mighty was considered the greatest giant warrior, and he was killed by a single man I don't see them as a good fighters.   The Mountain was killed by a single man and he was one of the top-tier fighters in Westeros, and easily the most deadly on the battlefield. I feel like a lot of people are discounting larger fighters like giants and Brienne and saying, ""Well, they're only good because they're big, so they don't count"", when the reality is that being a good fighter is taking advantage of your strengths. The only real measure of 'good' or 'bad' is whether or not you're the one standing at the end of the fight. Quick, skilled, and agile isn't inherently better than brutal.  Not only that, but it discounts their disadvantages. Yeah, giants are big, but they also don't get steel equipment like other fighters. If you formed an order of the best baseball players of all time and said, ""Well, Babe Ruth's batting doesn't count, but his skill at catching does"", he's necessarily going to come up lower in the rankings. Likewise for big dudes.  If you count the battle where Mag is outnumbered and fighting in a constricted area where he can't use his size, yeah, he's going to come up short. But saying that means he's a bad fighter is like saying Loras is a bad fighter because of the siege of Dragonstone. Sieges are risky and costly endeavors for the attacker. Even very skilled fighters will usually take a disproportionate number of losses.  Realistically speaking, Wun Wun is absolutely terrifying for anyone to fight. No one waltzes up to a giant and kills them no problem. Not Jaime at his prime, not Arthur Dayne, not Barristan, because if you make a mistake, you die. And that's one-on-one, which isn't where Wun Wun's strengths are going to show. Anyone else is going to struggle to match his sheer ability to wreck shit on the battlefield. Yeah, maybe that knight is good with a sword, but let's see how good he is when you toss one of his footmen at his face at 50MPH."
pureasoiaf,3aacjd,SGoogs1780,5,Thu Jun 18 19:37:45 2015 UTC,"Well on the Mountain point, he technically won that fight, and Oberyn would have surely been on this list anyway if he were still alive."

But he was not just better than Jon, he wiped the floor with him. Jon is as good, or maybe better then the Iron Emmot, who is the best fighter in the NW still alive. So Jon is probably pretty good. Not exceptional, but very good. And there is a big difference between just beating someone, or fuck him up without breaking a sweat. He also bested a lot of Wildling chefs, so he is probably among the best 5 who can still fight.    But Mag the Mighty was considered the greatest giant warrior, and he was killed by a single man I don't see them as a good fighters.   Well, he was fleeing. I think any giant who would go one on one with any human would win. But they are not Human, probably every Direwolf would win against a single human as well. So don't include him. I mean, Bran would probably win against anyone by now, he could probably warg people by now, and make them cut their own throat.    Sandor is technically dead   no the Hound is.

pureasoiaf,3aacjd,RaptorK1988,12,Fri Jun 19 01:59:41 2015 UTC,Surprised no one has mentioned Bronn. You gotta be good to fight with little armor.
pureasoiaf,3aacjd,moondoggle,16,Thu Jun 18 15:27:07 2015 UTC,"Ya. The problem with Bronn is that he seems capable of besting anyone, yet, we've never actually seen him tested to his limits. His nature is so cagey that I don't think he would ever enter a tourney just because he wouldn't want to give away all his best moves. His trade secrets are more important to him than any boasting rights."
pureasoiaf,3aacjd,theriveryeti,10,Thu Jun 18 15:42:53 2015 UTC,"I'd like to put in a good word for Ser Balon Swann, the last man in Westeros worthy of the white cloak.  He's supposed to be better with a bow/morningstar than a sword, but then Areo Hotah only uses an axe and he's on the list.  IIRC when Hotah sees Swann in Dorne he sizes him up and concludes that he might not be able to take him, or at least decides that he's a hell of a lot stronger than Oakheart.  Worth mentioning that almost all of the best swordsmen are probably just unmentioned Bravosi."
pureasoiaf,3aacjd,Chriscftb97,4,Thu Jun 18 20:35:19 2015 UTC,"Poor Balon, I'm glad he's getting an all inclusive Dornish vacation.  Hopefully he gets a Barristan-esque pardon after the Lannister regime is ousted."

But I guess that was because of his knight principles combined to his fighting skill, and not only because of fighting. In a pure fight, I think some others would be better than him.  I guess a lot of unmentioned people from Essos would be the very best: Dothraki, Braavosi, Yi-Ti (?), Ibben (?), a bunch of sell-swords... I don't quite remember from WOIAF, Essos is too huge"

Vast experience in fighting and winning against all sorts of warriors in the Pits.   Lyn Corbray. Despite his background, he's a very skilled duelist and earned Lady Forlorn because of his prowess in battle. He also killed Prince Lewyn of the King's Guard in battle.   Mance Raydar.

Besides whooping Jon's ass in the yard in the last book, Mance was a deserter of the Night's Watch, a hated crow, who united pretty much all of the North.   There's more detail in one of the books about this but Mance was hardly the only King Beyond the Wall when he deserted. On his way to become The King Beyond the Wall and uniting everyone he forced the other kings to join him and slayed the rest.   Of course he's not as large as the GreatJon, or as hard as Victarion, or fought in melees and tourneys like Thoros and Yohn Royce but I feel his skill at arms and leadership abilities earned him a place on my list."

pureasoiaf,3aacjd,apeshite,6,Thu Jun 18 15:37:38 2015 UTC,"Haha this is one of my absolute favourite things to speculate on, thanks for it.  Also extra points for remembering Thoros of Myr :)  I'm going to say:   Barristan the Bold Garlan the Gallant Dario Naharis Thoros of Myr Lyn Corbray (seriously I think in the next book we're going to see some Lady Forlorn action)   Just missed the cut much to my dismay: Strong Belwas, Archibald Yronwood, Areo Hotah  Strong consideration if they are resurrected/not actually burnt to a crisp/are actually just digging graves: Jon Snow, Loras Tyrell, the Hound."
pureasoiaf,3aacjd,moondoggle,4,Thu Jun 18 16:28:26 2015 UTC,I must admit I didn't even consider Thoros until reading the comments hehe.  Is Lyn Corbray better than Belwas? I can't see Daario defeating Hotah or Belwas in a single combat.
pureasoiaf,3aacjd,TehRealRedbeard,3,Thu Jun 18 16:47:22 2015 UTC,"The problem with Corbray (and other guys like Darkstar and Yohn Royce) is we haven't ""seen"" them fight in the book yet, and just have to go off of stories, but based on what's been said (he smashed the Dornish host/killed Lewyn Martell at the Trident), I think of him as very lethal, and with Valyrian steel to boot.  I see Daario the same way, not as big or strong as some of these guys, but just really really dangerous.  I love Belwas though...let's say I left him out of my top 5 because as of right now he's technically recovering from being poisoned and isn't in fighting shape :)"

pureasoiaf,3aacjd,SolidStart,6,Thu Jun 18 17:19:15 2015 UTC,I think he's more Stannis alike. Not a particular warrior but an strategic master mind.
pureasoiaf,3aacjd,njm1314,5,Thu Jun 18 17:23:08 2015 UTC,"During Robert's Rebellion Randyll led the van for Lord Mace Tyrell. He inflicted the only defeat on Robert Baratheon's forces, at the Battle of Ashford, in which Randyll slew Lord Cafferen.  Once again following the lead of his liege lord, he joins with the Lannisters and fights against Stannis, commanding the center at the Battle of the Blackwater.  Randyll destroys a northern force attacking the town of Duskendale, resulting in the capture of Harrion Karstark and Robett Glover and the death of Helman Tallhart.  Randyll Tarly is the finest soldier in the realm. A poor Hand for peacetime, but with Tywin dead there's no better man to finish this war.   - Kevan Lannister  Tarly is the real danger. A narrow man, but iron-willed and shrewd, and as good a soldier as the Reach could boast.  - Kevan Lannister    I do believe you are correct about Tarly being a strategic mastermind, as I can't find a battle he has lost. I, however, believe he is at the very least, a capable combatant, perhaps an honorable mention candidate. One doesn't lead the vanguard in every battle and live without great skill."
pureasoiaf,3aacjd,qwazokm,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:08:48 2015 UTC,"Well, he is probably the best soldier rather than fighter. His strength may be in the discipline and fearlessness (as an unsullied, may be). A wise commander doesn't have to be in the vanguard all the time; he would be worth a mention, but probably not in the fighter list."
pureasoiaf,3aacjd,greasywhalemilk,2,Thu Jun 18 21:23:23 2015 UTC,Thoros of Myr is a very awesome character but I never pegged him for top 5 fighters myself. Didn't more than a few characters credit the flaming sword for his prowess in melees? Personally I'd swap him for Lyn Corbray.  Also Meryn Trant fought the first sword of Braavos and lived. I think that's noteworthy even if he had a huge weapon and armour advantage.
pureasoiaf,3aacjd,almost_frederic,2,Thu Jun 18 17:44:02 2015 UTC,Not as noteworthy as Syrio Forel even putting up a fight at all.
pureasoiaf,3aacjd,stevethemule,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:08:25 2015 UTC,Huge weapon and armor advantage is an understatement. That was about as much of a handicap as Ned losing to Ilyn Payne at the end of AGOT

The Edge Knight does not belong. All he did was fail to off a little girl. If Gregor/Sandor are counted as ""alive,"" they both almost certainly belong.

pureasoiaf,3a71et,maxoupidou,31,Wed Jun 17 18:58:56 2015 UTC,"Still very powerful since they control and tax all the trade in Oldtown. This makes them far richer than any other house besides the Lannisters (who've lost many of their most respected leaders so are not as powerful as they once were). Then with the fact that the Reach was largely unharmed by the war and they have certain influence in the Citadel, I'd say they're one of the strongest players out there right now.  Since the Hightowers have supported the Targaryens since they first landed on Westeros I have to think that the Tyrells would be wise to continue supporting them as well, or risk losing the support of the most powerful vassal house in the realm.   It's going to be interesting to see how it's all going to play out in TWOW."
pureasoiaf,3a71et,LawrenciuM94,19,Wed Jun 17 20:40:18 2015 UTC,"Since the Hightowers have supported the Targaryens since they first landed on Westeros I have to think that the Tyrells would be wise to continue supporting them as well, or risk losing the support of the most powerful vassal house in the realm.   Well there is the prophecy that the Hightowers can't raise arms against the Targs or Oldtown would burn. So they're more forced to like the Targaryens than really support them. But I also think Aegon VI will have a very powerful ally with them.   The Reach has the largest army in Westeros, but with 2 of their largest houses working for the Targaryens, I don't think Mace Tyrell has much of choice."

A minor lord from the Riverlands who just rebelled against the Iron Throne and who already has sons who will inherit Maidenpool. Surely a great house from the Reach can find a better arrangement. The Mootons were fierce Targ supporters, with Myles Mooton being prince Rhaegars squire.  When the small council discusses Aegons landing in the Stormlands, Randyll dismisses it as a diversion from Stannis.  These are the 2 biggest points that I like to use. I'm sure there's a larger theory surrounding it, but I would have to point you to google for that one. ;)"
pureasoiaf,3a71et,barandor,5,Wed Jun 17 22:00:57 2015 UTC,And the great military mind of Randyll Tarly would be very usefull for Aegon or Dany. Thanks ! Never heard of this theory.

When he emerged he announced that the Faith would not oppose the Targaryens, because the Crone had shown him that to do so would mean the destruction of Oldtown in dragonflame.  Lord Hightower, who was a godly man, heeded the High Septon's prophecy when he heard it.

pureasoiaf,3a71et,Calithin,8,Thu Jun 18 23:36:22 2015 UTC,"I think they'll have a big part in TWOW, but not in the way people are expecting. Most of the Reach's navy are on their way to encounter the Ironborn circling Oldtown, but I think it's very likely that the Ironborn find themselves looting and pillaging before too long, turning Oldtown into a nightmare for Sam and whatever other major characters we have there.   As for the Hightowers, I'm very intrigued by them. It seems like, with the short stories GRRM has published over the past couple of years (about the original Dance of Dragons), he made the Hightowers out to be incredibly rich, powerful, motivated individuals. The current Hightower clan is very guarded, private, and hasn't made much of an appearance in the story. I think it's possible that they chime in at the last minute to make a big impact, but I think Oldtown has been built up as a ripe fruit ready to be picked by the Ironborn (of whom we haven't seen much of their plundering exploits yet)."
pureasoiaf,3a71et,Calithin,7,Wed Jun 17 22:39:09 2015 UTC,I can't wait for the Hightowers to join the party.  I think their relative silence so far is probably a result of them being diehard Targaryen supporters.  Although Ser Leyton and his daughter hiding out in the Tower sounds a bit like those two might have gone off the deep end.
pureasoiaf,3a71et,DorianRed,4,Wed Jun 17 19:30:19 2015 UTC,"I know they supported the Targaryen during Robert's rebelion. Maybe Aegon VI back in Westeros will ""wake up"" Lord Leyton. But first they have to deal with the ironborns !"
pureasoiaf,3a71et,DorianRed,3,Wed Jun 17 19:35:20 2015 UTC,"I've never really looked into House Hightower.   Rich as the Lannisters? Really? Wouldn't they be a much bigger power player early on than they have so far?  How can they be richer than the Tyrell's have a much bigger army, and still be subject to the Tyrells?"
pureasoiaf,3a70o5,Julamipol88,18,Wed Jun 17 18:53:50 2015 UTC,"I think that's something we'll never know for sure, but I'm assuming Sam took care of him.  My friend was tinfoiling that Robert was still alive. I pointed out that (in addition to all the other evidence) there was probably a funeral we just never heard about."
pureasoiaf,3a70o5,votenanocratic,31,Wed Jun 17 19:34:49 2015 UTC,"I'll have to double check but I thought there was a funeral for Robert, and Cercei even made a point to eat some of the boar that was served (the boar that slain Robert).   Then again the feast could've been completely independent from the funeral..."
pureasoiaf,3a70o5,_Naimix,9,Wed Jun 17 20:25:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah in all likelihood there was a more religiously focused funeral ceremony at one point, and then the feast to celebrate his life.  I wonder which member of the KG stood the vigil for Robert. Probably Barry."

With so many converging on Slaver's Bay at present and so many possibilities open I can't wait to see how it plays out. We don't have a whole lot of info on Marwyn but from what we do know he is neck-deep in the more interesting facets of the world of Ice and Fire. What does he have planned? Who else is involved in those plans?   I personally love that he has been a character that has been lurking behind the scenes a bit but could now be at the forefront of who knows what."

pureasoiaf,3a70o5,hamishwilson,2,Thu Jun 18 14:32:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry about this but it is one of my favorite first impressions of a character:  Marwyn wore a chain of many metals around his bull’s neck. Save for that, he looked more like a dockside thug than a maester. His head was too big for his body, and the way it thrust forward from his shoulders, together with that slab of jaw, made him look as if he were about to tear off someone’s head. Though short and squat, he was heavy in the chest and shoulders, with a round, rock-hard ale belly straining at the laces of the leather jerkin he wore in place of robes. Bristly white hair sprouted from his ears and nostrils. His brow beetled, his nose had been broken more than once, and sourleaf had stained his teeth a mottled red. He had the biggest hands that Sam had ever seen. When Sam hesitated, one of those hands grabbed him by the arm and yanked him through the door.""  I instantly wanted to know what was up with that guy. Alas, we shall have to wait."
pureasoiaf,3a70o5,Ser_Samshu,4,Thu Jun 18 19:14:34 2015 UTC,"It's not clear. Sam thought that the archmaesters would send a cart for his body, but before he could speak to the Seneschal, he got detoured to Marwyn, who promptly left.  Quhuru Mo plans to sell the Citadel the books they brought, so  Maester Aemon is likely to get decanted as part of the deal. Just speculation though."

The Dothraki sea (as Daenerys notices) is going dry. The mountains blowing in the wind are the pyramids as Viserion and Rhaegal lay waste to them.

pureasoiaf,3a62rx,psythedude,2,Fri Jun 19 18:32:59 2015 UTC,"Maybe not foreshadowing so much as just general thematic stuff.   Fire kills wights. It is also a common trope (and one that George Martin does not eschew) that fire kills undead in general. Robert Strong is, if not a wight, at least similar to one, and is almost certainly undead. He is also frequently referred to as being very hard to kill. It stands to reason that, if he has a weakness, it would be fire. It would be a far more fitting fulfilment of ""mountains blowing in the wind like leaves"" than anything else I can think of."
pureasoiaf,3a62rx,ElenTheMellon,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:44:53 2015 UTC,"Thats a really good explanation. I first thought that Quentyn is a bad fit since beside obvious symbology fitting he is a nobody and so more or less completely irrelevant... but... if Mirri was in a trance of prophetic visions then she could have been seeing just those symbolic images and visions based on them so spoke them without actually understanding what they really mean.  Still, no getting better for Drogo.  Although if we take that one to be metaphorical too... Drogo was burned on the pyre that gave birth to dragons. So... drogo... Drogon? Eh."

pureasoiaf,3a62rx,moondoggle,6,Wed Jun 17 17:24:01 2015 UTC,"I think the bit about Drogo returning is symbolically fulfilled through Drogon.

GRRM: You may hear about it and you may get flashback scenes from characters who have been there and you can puzzle it out on the internet. But I don’t know. I may return to write other stories set in this world. I want you to return to Osten Ard by the way.  There is also this:  [Will POVs see any of the places to the east like Yi Ti, Asshai, etc.?]  Some, perhaps.

And its a style of the Songs to have these kind of things be very open to interpretations since they are always figurative, metaphorical and lyrical instead of literal.  I really doubt that soul of Drogo will return since there is no resurrection of that kind in the setting, ... and it would be really embarrassing and creepy. To say the least."

pureasoiaf,3a5wdl,boobot_sqr,5,Wed Jun 17 23:37:15 2015 UTC,"Between that and this comment, I feel like that would be such a cop-out, to have spent how many whole books on King's Landing intrigue only for none of that to matter, nobody sits the Iron Throne. You were led to believe the series was a subversion, a gritty pseudo-historical fiction examining a medieval society that's been impacted by the dominance, destruction, and rebirth of magic. But in the end it was a typical high fantasy series about elemental forces duking it out all along? Back to GRRM's quote about Tolkein, that just doesn't fit. What is the point of Jaime, Cersei, Brienne etc. if this was the case? Just to serve as irony that nothing they did ever mattered? It's obvious there are forces at play greater than these characters and the plots within Westeros, but I believe there will be some way that their ""petty"" struggles will impact the great scheme of things. If every character who seemed to matter turns out to have died in the end for naught, and it's some children of the forest telling the story, how would that be any better than ""it was all a dream""?"
pureasoiaf,3a5wdl,TaelorSwyft,4,Wed Jun 17 15:30:26 2015 UTC,"Well, it would be better in the sense that it fits with the theme of the central ""power struggle"" being somewhat petty in face of a greater threat. I don't think it contradicts GRRM's quotes about Tolkein, because the elemental forces don't represent ""absolute good"" and ""absolute evil"" in the way that subsequent authors have bastardized Tolkein. I would agree that placing fantasy in a more realistic medieval context is also a central theme of the books, but I don't think that's the only point he's trying to make. I also think the importance of human character and decisionmaking to shaping human events is also a theme of the books, but I think he's simultaneously making a point about how blindness to larger problems can overwhelm all of it.  In the end, the larger ""elemental forces"" potentially winning doesn't put the books back into typical fantasy tropes, it still undermines them: no preordained ""one true hero"" saved the world. A united humanity could have stopped it, but didn't, because it was caught up in the minutiae of power.   That's a long way from ""it was just a dream."" It's a very specific and salient point that gives the books a contemporary relevance. And, if I'm right, I think he's making the point in a pretty powerful way."

pureasoiaf,3a5wdl,almost_frederic,2,Wed Jun 17 18:24:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, this totally fits with GRRM's very ominous mention about how this isn't just some AU with uber-long seasons but that there's some serious supernatural/magical fuckery at play causing that..."
pureasoiaf,3a5wdl,TaelorSwyft,2,Wed Jun 17 23:14:12 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on the Earth/Nature bit.  I think that there are indeed four opposing forces at play here: Ice and Fire, no doubt, which affects the seasons, as well as Nature and... humanity.  GRRM always quotes that line about writing about the human heart in conflict with itself, right?  The interesting thing is that the Ice and Fire conflict is actually secondary.  So far, it's been almost ignored for the entire narrative, except for a few characters who recognize the existential threat.  This leads us as readers to see it as this overarching conflict that, in a case of dramatic irony, most of the characters are too blind to see.  But what's really happening is that ordinary people, humanity, are destroying Nature.  They have cut down weirwood trees.  They've pushed the Children of the Forest to the far, far North.  They have almost destroyed the Giants.  Think about it -- who built the Wall?  Why is it there?  Legend says Brandon the Builder did it.  That's not exactly believable.  Besides, it has magic woven into it.  But while the Wall protects the realm from the Others, it also protects the Children and the Giants from humanity.  The humans that do live north of the Wall were forced to learn to coexist with these beings, whom most of the south do not believe actually exist.  But humanity also has its redeeming characteristics.  GRRM's portrayal of humanity is almost always complex.  A few people are complete monsters, like Ramsay, but nearly everyone else has some good and some bad.  Ser Davos Seaworth is one of the best examples of a completely good guy, right?  He was a smuggler.  You know, running illegal merchandise from one place to another without being caught by the law?  Not so good.  It's all imperfect.  And humanity threatens itself -- as well as the balance of Planetos.  We have to wonder who will win the War of Ice and Fire.  I don't think it will be Nature.  I don't think it will be Ice, either.  I don't think it will be Fire.  Humanity certainly won't win.  All four of these will lose to humanity."
pureasoiaf,3a5wdl,xiipaoc,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:00:43 2015 UTC,I'm almost positive there are other seasons they just last a normal length of time and winter and summer are the only ones that last years.

One was Lord Ryswell's youngest son, so when they reached the barrowlands they sought shelter at his castle, but Lord Ryswell took them captive and returned them to the Nightfort. The Lord Commander had holes hewn in the top of the Wall and he put the deserters in them and sealed them up alive in the ice. They have spears and horns and they all face north.

There are also gates that they could force open with zombie mammoths or something. Not to mention the caves that go beneath it (Ygrette told Jon that some raiders get through that way now and then). Your likely to starve to death before finding your way through the labrynth but If your undead and your army is near limitless.. you can cover a lot of ground.  The main reason they can't do that is because there is sorcery stopping them from crossing while the Nights Watch keeps to their purpose.  So they can't get past the wall as long as noone does anything stupid like stop protecting the realms of men.... or kill their lord commander for fighting them... oh... oh shit.

He's just a Targaryen supporter.  He was loyal to the Targaryens when they were in charge. He acts all shady when Robert, Joffrey, and Tomnen are king. Then he reveals he's been helping the Targaryen heir in the background this whole time.   I'm on my second read through, and everything he does is much less mysterious if you assume his motive is to get Rhaegar's heir on the throne."
pureasoiaf,3a03r3,moondoggle,5,Tue Jun 16 16:23:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but what I really want to know is: when did he look in the mirror and say ""you know, I think I'd really like to become a spymaster.  But not here, across the sea on a completely different continent.""  Like I can understand how he could become a Rhaegar supporter after working for him, but how did he get started there?"
pureasoiaf,3a03r3,vokkan,8,Tue Jun 16 16:55:46 2015 UTC,"It is known that Varys (together with Illyrio) was a highly, widely renowned information peddler in Essos. The Mad King didn't trust anyone in Westeros to spy for him, so he got Varys for the part.   Granted, I too would want to know how he came to transition from simply opportunistic, to fueling the Mad Kings paranoia, to saving Aegon and setting up this altruistic perfect ruler scheme."
pureasoiaf,3a03r3,ScoutX,3,Tue Jun 16 18:56:39 2015 UTC,"Granted, I too would want to know how he came to transition from opportunistic, to fueling the Mad Kings paranoia, to saving Aegon and setting up this altruistic perfect ruler scheme.    Do we really know he was up to shady stuff when Aerys was king? Or is that something he lets the people who killed his king but let him keep his job think about him?  ""Oh that guy? I heard he's always been that sneaky."" ""Yeah, I heard he's responsible for the last king going all crazy.""   He goes from a threat, loyal to the old crown, to an asset, useful to the new crown, just by not defending his honor."

I'm trying to pay extra attention to who in Kings Landing knows anything about Varys that Varys didn't tell them. I guess a few people like Barristan would know him from the old administration, but those people don't talk about Varys much.  I think Varys bullshits most of the people in Robert's court to make himself appear weak and non-threatening. Even on my first read through, I didn't put a lot of stock in what he claims his history is."

pureasoiaf,3a03r3,ScoutX,3,Tue Jun 16 17:00:35 2015 UTC,"I suppose.  I haven't read World of Ice and Fire or the novellas. Most of what I know about the Blackfyres is from Reddit.  I try to keep the Blackfyre possibility in my mind when I'm rereading, but it doesn't add much to the story. No one ever talks about them. I wouldn't remember that they're a part of the story if it wasn't for the internet.  When I take his final Dance with Dragons monologue as fact, it completely changes everything I assumed about his character and all of his seemingly mysterious motives come into focus."
pureasoiaf,3a03r3,hamishwilson,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:06:04 2015 UTC,"Yea the Blackfyres aren't really mentioned much in the main series, which is why I think the D&E novellas concentrate so much on the political context surrounding them.

pureasoiaf,3a03r3,almost_frederic,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:31:55 2015 UTC,"Varys and Illyrio are not Targaryen loyalists. They threw away two Targaryen heirs of unquestioned provenance (Viserys and Dany). Obviously, they had good reason to keep Viserys off the throne (he's unstable), but they still should have kept Daenerys in hand, if for no other reason than to marry ""Aegon."""
pureasoiaf,3a03r3,ScoutX,2,Wed Jun 17 19:43:40 2015 UTC,"They threw away the uncle of the man they're trying to put on the throne.  They traded away Danny for, at the least, a small army, but it seems like there was more to that plan before it went to shit.   Also, it always seemed strange to me that we question who Aegon is even though his existence is well documented and we have at least two prominent baby swaps I can think of. Meanwhile, everyone accepts Danny is Aerys' daughter, even though he would have had to knock up his mostly estranged wife a day or two before she went into hiding. I'm not saying I know she isn't Aegon's aunt, but she does easily have the most questionable parentage of any of the major characters."
pureasoiaf,3a03r3,almost_frederic,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:46:36 2015 UTC,"he would have had to knock up his mostly estranged wife a day or two before she went into hiding     We know Aerys had relations with Rhaella the day before she went into hiding (AFFC, Jaime II):   Jaime had only seen Rhaella once after that, the morning of the day she left for Dragonstone. The queen had been cloaked and hooded as she climbed inside the royal wheelhouse that would take her down Aegon's High Hill to the waiting ship, but he heard her maids whispering after she was gone. They said the queen looked as if some beast had savaged her, clawing at her thighs and chewing on her breasts. A crowned beast, Jaime knew.   Kevan (ADWD, Epilogue):   We have these tales coming from the east as well. A second Targaryen, and one whose blood no man can question. Daenerys Stormborn.     And there's a pretty continuous ""chain of custody"" for Daenerys, because she was accompanied by her brother.  Aegon, on the other hand, must be presumed dead until proved otherwise. The issue is not with the initial baby swap (Varys swapping out the tanner's son for Aegon). Varys has the skills and knowledge required to accomplish that. It's with the possibility that Illyrio made a second swap with his son by Serra."

If Mel is a shadowbinder, and she is the one reading the flames, then who is trying to deceive her? Is it Quaithe? Or maybe someone we don't know. Wouldn't a shadowbinder be able to detect the interference of another shadowbinder?  Maybe it's like a Ouija board, and Mel is actually guiding the flames with her expectations. I guess that doesn't explain how she saw the Karstark girl coming."
pureasoiaf,3a0rio,OfficialCocaColaAMA,3,Tue Jun 16 20:55:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's really consistent with the way seeing visions in fire and shadowbinding are portrayed.  So far we've seen two actual shadowbinders doing their thing: Mirri Maz Duur in the tent with Drogo, and Melisandre with the shadows that killed Renly and Cortnay Penrose.  On the other hand, the visions in the fire have been prophetic and different.  I think it's quite possible that the two abilities are somehow related, since both do involve fire and shadow, but I don't think it would make sense for it to be one shadowbinder talking to another, especially given that the images in the fire are somewhat symbolic."
pureasoiaf,3a0rio,xiipaoc,-2,Tue Jun 16 21:32:17 2015 UTC,I'm saying there is some sort of entity behind the flames. Giving visions. Possibly a person.   Mirri is known for being a shadow binder? I thought she just practised blood magic

Clearly something was being sacrificed, though it wasn't necessarily blood per se.   Yeah but just because the word shadow is used doesn't mean there's a link.   It's not the word ""shadow"".

pureasoiaf,3a0rio,FuriousFap42,5,Thu Jun 18 01:17:16 2015 UTC,"Mel getting sent false visions has been speculated a lot. For one it fits with a GRRM short story call ''And seven times, never kill men'' , where Spoilers that story ,which fits nicely with her, and also because her visions don't seem to be very useful.   But, she does have real visions into the future, like Renly at the Blackwater, maybe the deaths of Rob, Bealon and Joffrey, and some other stuff, that can not be explained away by someone seeing around the world with a glass candle, and sending her that info. Sure, you could have seen the plots to kill Rob, Joffrey and Belon coming, if you saw into Tywins office, Littlefingers talks with the Tyrells, and Eurons negotiation with a Faceless man. But the Renly at the Blackwater thing is hard to explain away. So that shadow binder sending her those visions would have to be able to see some future stuff as well."

Most people just read all of them after they finish ASOIAF but I believe it is better to combine the series.  There are references to each Dunk and Egg novella within the ASOIAF novel that is published after it.  You might miss these references if you simply read D&E after ASOIAF.  Dunk and Egg takes place ~100 years before the events of ASOIAF but is in the same universe.  It is about Ser Duncan the Tall and his squire Egg.  When you read, do so in this order:  A Game of Thrones  The Hedge Knight  A Clash of Kings  A Storm of Swords  The Sworn Sword  A Feast for Crows  Th Mystery Knight  A Dance with Dragons  Then you can read The Princess and the Queen and all the other stuff."

There are more characters to wrap your head around, but watching the show first definitely gives you a headstart on the jargon and households of Westeros, at least for me it did.  You should unsub reddit and stay away from forums and try to just enjoy them without outside influence and spoilers of events.

Basically FeastDance is an amalgamation of the fourth and fifth books in chronological order by chapter. Google it and it'll give you a list of chapters arranged in the right order.

pureasoiaf,3a25m9,jinchuika,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:15:27 2015 UTC,"I tried to commit to reading at least 1 chapter a day. It started out pretty easy because in the first books, his editor had a strong hand and many of the chapters are fairly short. They were easy to get through in bite-size pieces. In the later books, each chapter starts to get longer and longer. But it sets you up for consuming them at a pretty regular pace.   I'm not going to understand everything I read   I wouldn't worry about that. You're already a big fan of the show, so you're already well acquainted with the large main cast. You'll be introduced to side characters you've never met, but it's all easily manageable.   I might burn out, and just drop the books entirely after 1 or 2 books.   Maybe, maybe not. At least read through the first book before telling yourself you're bored. I think you'll find it more engaging than you think. Yes, the first book is mostly a more robust version of Season 1 of the show, but the scope is bigger, the battles that you don't see in the show are described in detail, the colors are brighter, the characters are deeper, everything is just richer and better. You're already a fan of this world. You're about to find out just how much better this story can be. I think you'll be surprised how much you can't put the books down once you start."

I started with the show to, and then, after two seasons started reading. At first I thought I was wasting my time, but then I quickly realized, that I was reading an other story, one that had much more layers. Don't worry, you are going to get into it. All the names can be of putting at first, but believe me, they hold significance. Just read the first three books, then the Dunk and Egg novellas, then the other two books, then the other two novellas and the world of ice and fire, then read all the fife main books again. Do not read the winds of winter before making a reread if it has come out by that point. Read however much you feel like on a day, just always read at least one chapter a day.

There will be days where you read five or ten chapters because you have the time and they are good and others where you barely read a paragraph, but if you read a little every day at least you won't burn out and you'll eventually get through these fantastic books. It took me six months to get through my first read through and I did miss a lot, but I'm reading the books again and I am catching a lot of things. I started A Game of Thrones in January and I am about two thirds of the way through A Clash of Kings. My hope is this slower read through helps me spot of lot of things I missed and that I will finish right around the time The Winds of Winter comes out if GRRM is able to complete it by next spring."

Including keeping track of various characters.  If you manage to get burned out or manage not to understand it then its best if you drop it and go back to watching the tv ""adaptation""."

A lot of the passages that initially don't seem to make sense become clearer as you progress.  And those that don't add to the mystery of GRRM's world.  Also, DO NOT skip chapters.  Same are less exciting than others, but all add something."

pureasoiaf,39xoec,Mediocre-Jedi,61,Mon Jun 15 20:40:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, while we're blaming characters for acting like real humans who behave illogically or irresponsibly due to love, vengeance, desire to belong etc. let's blame Ned for being a shit Nancy Drew, or Robb for wanting to protect the girl he slept with, or Theon, for Theonning all over Winterfel.   Honestly, if people can feel sorry for Theon, and celebrate his redemption, I've no idea why people hate Cat for acting like a Mother who loves her Children."

pureasoiaf,39xoec,brotherjustincrowe,6,Tue Jun 16 02:44:01 2015 UTC,"Personally, the only thing I've ever held Cat in contempt for was sending Jaime south with Brienne, costing Robb a tactical advantage and prolonging a war he wanted to bring to an end.  Of course, Jaime is a manipulative dick and got inside her head."
pureasoiaf,39xoec,aje12,44,Tue Jun 16 13:40:14 2015 UTC,"Soooo disappointed at the overwhelming Cat hate in this sub. I would have to criticise your reading of the novels if you believe that the Stark kids don't love and respect their mother tremendously. Here are a small number of instances where they think of her until ACOK. This clear love for their mother, continues throughout the novels but I think its most poignant in Arya's ASOS storyline.   Sansa:   Sansa had favored her mother’s gods over her father’s.  I must be as strong as my lady mother.  She had promised herself she would be a lady, gentle as the queen and as strong as her mother, the Lady Catelyn, but all of a sudden she was scared again.   Rickon   “I want Mother,” he said. “I want her. And Shaggydog too.”  Bran clung to hope. “Was the bird from Mother? Is she coming home?”  Bran shivered. “I wish Mother was back,”  “Father always listened to his counsel,” Bran reminded his brother. “Mother too.”   Arya:   She yearned to see her mother again.   She had promised she would not try and run away again, she knew, but that was before they started telling lies about her mother.  It wasn’t fair. Sansa had everything... Worse, she was beautiful. Sansa had gotten their mother’s fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the Tullys. Arya took after their lord father."
pureasoiaf,39xoec,elombardi,10,Tue Jun 16 02:47:33 2015 UTC,Thanks for pointing these out.  This does suggest i overlooked some of the references where they took strength from her.  The third reference from Sansa is exactly the kind of thing i kept looking for as I read.  Appreciate you pointing it out.
pureasoiaf,39xoec,Innocents_Suffer,18,Tue Jun 16 12:55:23 2015 UTC,"I didn't think anything too odd about it. It seems that Cat was more often around the children than Ned. I would assume because of that, they would look more fondly on their parent that they saw less of.   Also, adult characters seem to hold Cat in high regard."
pureasoiaf,39xoec,Xkot,11,Mon Jun 15 21:02:47 2015 UTC,"This makes sense as a big part of Cat seems to be her silence. Her mind is always working over time, but she is very cautious with what says or how she acts. She  is very selective as to when she engages with someone, and usually even then its no nonsense."
pureasoiaf,39xoec,Hurm4,8,Mon Jun 15 22:40:06 2015 UTC,And as LSH you could even make an argument that silence is a huge theme for her...
pureasoiaf,39xoec,almost_frederic,8,Tue Jun 16 01:11:37 2015 UTC,"Neat observation. First couple of reads, there's a lot of ammo there to dislike Catelyn. She was an asshole to Jon, captured our beloved Tyrion (that scene was so embarrassing for Catelyn, who needed a handful of her father's bannermen to seize Tyrion, a dwarf) and her release of Jaime. What I came to realize a few rereads later is that Catelyn is a BOSS because she bare-hand gripped a Valyrian steel dagger (which I like to joke about being Lightbringer).  In these rereads, Jaime became one of my favorites, so Catelyn releasing him became a reason to like her to me because I no longer sympathized with the Starks as much as I did originally."
pureasoiaf,39xoec,Hurm4,2,Tue Jun 16 02:03:57 2015 UTC,"I have to complain about GRRM's ""grasp"" of the mechanics of sharp objects.

It's not like she was like the modern mother, who actually does stuff. She was a rich southerner who complained and babied them and treated their brother like crap (though Sansa wouldn't care about that, Arya definitely would and Bran probably would).  Their mum never did much."
pureasoiaf,39xoec,FuriousFap42,7,Mon Jun 15 17:34:34 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I'm thinking it's just kind a combination of the typical role of women in Westeros (as passive housekeepers/heir producers basically) and her being an insignificant person in general.  Because we get chapters from her point of view I can see how some people would start to get the impression of her as a more impactful character, but really she's just running around Westeros like a chicken with its head cut off.  edit: I thought of one instance of her kids thinking of her.  I remember Arya defying Septa Mordane once in Winterfell and realizing how much more trouble she was in when her mom showed up to punish her instead of just the Septa.  Contrast that with when she storms out of the Hall during dinner in King's Landing and Ned comes to her room after and makes everything better...which is pretty in line with the original post :)"

Especially not at the beginning, 90% of the strong female characters we get are all further into the books, and there's not many. Everyone else is either useless or a whore (though you could argue that that's accurate for the time setting).  For Cat in particular, it seems to be hinted in the first book that she has a large part to play in running the castle, but I thought that's the steward's job? Apparently it was the Septa who taught the girls how to be women and educated them, the only thing Cat seems to have taught Sansa was about the Seven."

pureasoiaf,39zce0,vokkan,0,Tue Jun 16 20:54:10 2015 UTC,"Melisandre is basically just a shadowbinder that came to believe in one of the religions as any other people come to believe.  (as you can see in my recent post here i think that there is no real Gods in ASOIAF at all)  Her burning and blood tricks simply do not work. She does have visions in flames and thats all.  I do believe that visions that several characters exhibit are basically magical abilities, that grow stronger as magic is returning into the world.  She saw the deaths of those three in the flame visions and then made up the rest about leeches and kings blood. I think she believes her own delusions to an extent, in the sense that she doesnt see any discrepancy between what she believes and necessity to use some dirty tricks to achieve it. After all, her visions are often coming true. Therefore they collaborate her religious beliefs - and if she needs to push it and use tricks to achieve that then its all excused because she is doing it for the greater ""good"" , etc, etc. A circular self excusing logic loop."
pureasoiaf,39x3gz,Altephor1,12,Mon Jun 15 14:43:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think she's always known it's him. In her chapter she mentions that she asks for a glimpse of Stannis, and all she sees is Snow.  I got the impression she didn't quite click in to the fact that Snow is important, hence her being shown him, but I believe she'll make the connection eventually.  It's a popular theory that Mel will move from Stannis to Jon support wise."

However, I think we all tend to overlook just how huge his assassination is whether or not it is an attempt or he's really dead.  Unless Jon Snow is revived pretty quickly, all the work he's done with the Wildlings is off.  I really think this action will lead to Tormund's people, the spearwives at Long Barrow, Wun Wun, and all the other wildlings South of the Wall and those that have joined the watch attacking Marsh and company.  Unless the Marsh's men have a massive ambush set for all armed Wildlings at Castle Black (possible), I'm guessing that Tormund and his people overwhelm the Watch and the Queensmen."

I went to London last year with a friend and while I was in a book store I decided to ask her about the difference between steaming and smoking (English is her first language, she has studied English philology too). She told me that steaming is used for vapour and smoking when there is fire. I showed her that part of the book- the wound and the smoke- and she asked me if that was a fantasy book, because smoking can't be used for hot meeting cold.

In order for the story to progress, there needs to be a major sea change.    What? If Jon is revived the Nightwatch as we knew it will be done. He will not be bound by his vows anymore... I couldn't imagine a more radical sea change. Any bickerers will get their necks ripped of by a dire-wolf."
pureasoiaf,39x3gz,njm1314,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:37:42 2015 UTC,"Kind of. The Jon I know, would view the release of his vows as a loophole, much like the one he already turned down from Stannis. He has no interest in abandoning the watch. As a matter of fact, he would probably go the other way with it, and determine that vows shouldn't end at death and extend the oath.  As far as the Nights Watch being ""done as we know it"", that happened the day that Jon brought wildlings north of the wall. We are already in completely uncharted territory as far as the watch is considered. Furthermore, presumably there will be neck ripping with or without the return of Jon, as his murder will be...polarizing to say the least. We don't even know yet what the opinion of the crown will be regarding the willful admittance of wildlings into the realm. With or without Jon, the Watch may be viewed as an enemy of the state at this point.  Basically, Jon has had such a strong single handed effect on the story line, that he doesn't even need to be alive to progress the story at this point. Need being the operative word here. I'm not saying that there wouldn't be anything to gain by keeping him alive, I am however saying that the story could continue without him. And seeing as Jon was invented from thin air by GRRM, I trust that alive or dead, whatever is written regarding Jon's story will be better than any outcome that I could come up with."
pureasoiaf,39x3gz,itsalwaysbeen,0,Thu Jun 18 15:25:17 2015 UTC,"I think that might happen if he's resurrected.   The Wildings might become the nights watch, thousands strong.   If he's resurrected by mel.... What will he do? Just get up and go to bed? I think not. I think the repercussions from this stabbing usher in the sea change, but I just can't believe jons dead.   If he kills Jon before cersei, I'm fine with the books. I only read them for jons chapters /the wall chapters. The book will be so boring without Jon. I think Jon and tyrion and Danny are 3 characters that can't die until the end, otherwise the story will suffer. If he kills jon for real, I think he'll piss off more people than he thinks and will lose devoted fans. Edward after just one book was almost unbearable... Killing Jon after 5 seems cruel to the fans"

You are upset at the prospect of Jon dying. George has created a character that you have become emotionally invested in, whose plot line has suprised you and made you feel even more emotions. Furthermore, you are compelled to pick up the next book in the series, or watch the next season of the show to find out if it really happened. And if it did, why?  Jon dying moves the story forward.

pureasoiaf,39x3gz,brotherjustincrowe,2,Wed Jun 17 11:46:24 2015 UTC,I think jon is going to be resurrected and become King in the North. He died so he is technically not in the watch anymore and can take winterfell.
pureasoiaf,39x3gz,jwords,2,Mon Jun 15 16:39:45 2015 UTC,"If he wanted to make Jon King in the North, he would've just taken the Stark name when it was offered to him.

I'd say Jon is destined for something more than King in the North."

I believe he will be angry and spiteful, have a temper, feel hatred, and less goody two shoe honorific Ed style. It's this type of change to ruthlessness that I could easily see leading to him ignoring his vows and claiming the north.( Which has always been his biggest fantasy deep within.)   I could even see slowly descending into corruption and evil-ish-ness. He seems like the most obviously ""good"" hero of the Aragon mold, so it would be fitting if he were to slowly go bad and have an unlikely hero Emerge.   I'm currently re-reading AGOT and in one of Jon's first chapters he has an impulse thought/wish that Uncle Ben would be laying dead in the snow (because he won't let Jon go ranging with him), He quickly becomes aware of and stops  he thought and feels sick from it plus severely guilty. He has other small impulses or dreams of the sort throughout the story: I.e, imagining killing Rob in his dream during ADWD. There's some deep seeded rage there (could it be the Targ in his blood?) and perhaps all if takes to unleash it is a little murder.     This one is a huge reach, but hey, there's no potential outcome that I haven't at some point imagine in my thousands of hours or waiting."

But let me give you a specific example of what I'm talking about;  A Dance With Dragons seemed to me to be written kinda like this  Tyrion went here and did this and this and this.  Dany went here and did this and this and this.    Where as the other books, specifically 2 and 3 seemed more like it was in their head.  It was Point of View, we got to know Catlyn's feelings about her children, her fears for Rob, and what she thinks about other people.    Don't get me wrong, that occurs in ADWD but the way it doesn't seem on the same level.  Maybe it's just because of the focus on characters.   I dunno."

The reason I think so, is that all the results serve him. Ser Aron Santagar, master at armes, the only other person besides LF and Tyrion, who knew about the dagger. Also, someone tries to abduct Sansa (Okay, maybe it just was a attempted rape, but one of the men has garlic breath, which does not fit the starving mob). Also the riot starts when a woman breaks through the Goldcloaks.  Who controls the Goldcloaks? Littlefinger!   Also taking wards of powerful families is kind of his MO. He took Sweet Robin and Sansa, heirs to the vale and the north. Having someone who is a few deaths away form becoming the heir to the Westerlands may fit well into his plan. If he has the North, Vale, and Westerlands, no one will question his claim on the Riverlands, and he will make the next King.  But Varis could have done it as well. I just wonder where he took him to, and who is keeping him. But having someone who will take over the Westerlands, when Aegon comes would be quite useful. Also he is at the moment the one ""moving Tyrek closer to the to of the succession list""."

pureasoiaf,39vjbi,Kienn12,2,Tue Jun 16 03:03:10 2015 UTC,"Ehh, idk.  When the Targs had lots of heirs and 3 castles they would shift things around a lot. I don't recall if it ever happened but for instance since Robert had Stannis at Dragonstone as Targ heirs usually held... then if Robert and Joffrey had grown older would Joffrey have taken Dragonstone and ousted Stannis? Would Stannis have been moved to Storm's End - equivalent to Summerhall as a 3rd place royal castle?  It's all pretty wishy washy anyways."

pureasoiaf,39vjbi,jedi_timelord,3,Mon Jun 15 15:44:44 2015 UTC,1 - Robert's claim is partially reliant on his Targaryen lineage.  2 - The underlying reason for those precedents remains - most lords will not accept a female ruler.

pureasoiaf,39vjbi,CaptainofChickens,2,Tue Jun 16 00:25:57 2015 UTC,"Ok point 2 is where we disagree. I think the lords would accept a female ruler if they felt it was in their benefit.

Robert won the throne by conquest and therefore becomes the rightful king of Westeros (ruling out Aegon, Jon and Danaerys).  Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen are illegitimate and therefore automatically out of the succession.   Stannis' claim is independent of what happens to Tommen.  If Cersei's children are recognised to be legitimate, his claim is still inferior to Myrcella's as it is to Tommen's.  If they are recognised to be illegitimate, his claim trumps both theirs."

pureasoiaf,39u00s,itsalwaysbeen,10,Mon Jun 15 07:18:54 2015 UTC,"There is this theory, about a Arya and a Jon chapter in aDwD. Arya hears about one of the Lysini ships that took slaves from Hardhome, that got into a storm and is now in Bravos. She overhears two of the sailors talking. She then tells this to the kindly man. In the Jon chapter before, Tycho arrives, and quite willingly gives Jon his ships for the Hardhome mission. The Bravosi then only take women and children on board. Many, including me see this as proof, that the Arya chapter is chronological before the Jon chapter, and that the kindly man gave this info to the Iron Bank and they send Tycho, to save the wildlings from slavery."
pureasoiaf,39u00s,itsalwaysbeen,5,Mon Jun 15 09:05:16 2015 UTC,"Is there anything specific to suggest a connection between them, aside form the fact that both are from Braavos?"

Also Arya hears about the Lysini ships and tells the kindly man, and in the chapter before (which is probably chronological after) and then Tycho shows up at the Wall and quite willingly gives Jon his ships for the Hardhome mission. But that is a theory for it's self. But if it is true, it also supports the link.   Aside from that, no, no direct textual evidence for it. But it would make sense. The FM collect a lot of intelligence, and that would be very valuable for a bank, and the good of the city.

What is a feast for crows?  All the dead that are left on the field after a battle.  That's what the book is, the aftermath of the huge battle that was ASOS.  The POV's and Westeros itself have lost so many people and had their world's turned upside down by this destructive war and everyone is trying to pick up the pieces.  Essos, the Wall, and Winterfell are experiencing major upheavals, but its a different experience than what is happening below the Neck."

There are so many details within those timelines, and the timely manner in which GRRM wanted to reveal those details, makes it a daunting challege trying to keep chronological order in your mind.

On my first re-read it still felt like cramming for exams and I still had to backtrack on timelines quite often, distracting me from the good parts I missed.        I suppose if a reader does well in absorbing 4000+ pages on any subject, school or otherwise, seven blessings to them and their brain.  Especially with questionable GRRM chronology.     Even if it does include thousands of years of events,  sporadic flashbacks, separating dragon dreams from real events, thats pretty impressive and savant-like.  I had enough of a hard time with U.S. History, and that was less than 300 years of events.  I guess it would depend on the re-readers intentions.  And how many re-reads they have experienced.      What is one hoping to achieve through this re-read? Literary epiphany? Discovering new theories well discussed endlessly?  A study in character development?

But just like many, a general knowledge of the major plot changing events that follows the War of the Five kings maybe all you need at certain points.     They might be trying to find a new angle that other readers long past have not tried.  A novel approach to non-sequential reading can definitively produce that effect.       On my first re-reads, I focused on the prime characters, Jon, Dany, Ty, etc.  Then saw how it resonated over to the rest of the supporting characters.       But even that proved folly for me understanding the overall theme in each book as well as the series.  Why? Because they way grrm writes pov characters, they are so flawed in the way they interpret events and timelines around them, naive to the big picture."

Once youve read the story as the creator wanted it and you know how things develop it feels really nice to follow a specific character. It has a really nice flow to it and you dont get hanged on so many cliffhangers.  One character POV by a single book is a good measure i think.
pureasoiaf,39rkop,mywhereabouts,27,Sun Jun 14 01:50:03 2015 UTC,The Kings of Winter wore crowns of bronze and iron. That's why Robb has his fashioned as such. All the Starks of old buried in the crypts have iron swords on their laps.   The Andals brought steel.
pureasoiaf,39rkop,TwoBonesJones,5,Sun Jun 14 02:11:26 2015 UTC,"No, they brought iron.  The World of Ice and Fire, The Arrival of the Andals:   Andalos stretched from the Axe to what is now the Braavosian Coastlands, and south as far as the Flatlands and the Velvet Hills. The Andals brought iron weapons with them and suits of iron plates, against which the tribes that inhabited those lands could do little. [...]  The fact that the Andals forged iron has been taken by some as proof that the Seven guided them—that the Smith himself taught them this art—and so do the holy texts teach. But the Rhoynar were already an advanced civilization at this time, and they too knew of iron, so it takes only the study of a map to realize that the earliest Andals must have had contact with the Rhoynar.  [...]  Sweeping through the Vale with fire and sword, the Andals began their conquest of Westeros. Their iron weapons and armor surpassed the bronze with which the First Men still fought, and many First Men perished in this war.   There is no mention of the Andals using steel, nor of the First Men using iron.  What’s going on in this thread? Where does this claim that they brought steel and not iron even come from?"
pureasoiaf,39rkop,mknbrd,5,Sun Jun 14 18:20:57 2015 UTC,"Yet neither tooth nor talon was a match for the steel axes of the Andals, who slaughtered the greenseers, the beasts, and the First Men alike, and raised beside the High Heart a hill of corpses half again as high...or so the singers would have us believe.   And   Nor could the First Men match the zeal of the invaders, and their bronze axes and byrnies of bronze scales proved less than equal to the steel swords and iron ringmail of the Andals.   The World of Ice and Fire"
pureasoiaf,39rkop,TwoBonesJones,3,Sun Jun 14 19:29:21 2015 UTC,"Okay, I’m wrong about steel.  They brought both iron and steel, then. The First Men are still shown only with bronze, and my quotes make it clear that it was iron, not specifically steel, that made the Andals so successful."
pureasoiaf,39rkop,mknbrd,6,Sun Jun 14 19:52:41 2015 UTC,I'll agree I was wrong about iron. But that does confirm they had steel weapons. Raises more questions for me. Why bother with plain iron when you have the ability to make steel?
pureasoiaf,39rkop,TwoBonesJones,3,Sun Jun 14 19:58:36 2015 UTC,"I would theorize that iron was sufficient for armor. As far as I understand, the advantage of steel is that it can flex and retain shape without either breaking or bending permanently.

Old Nan’s “iron” could possibly come from this dragonsteel. But the dragonsteel itself raises two questions I didn’t really consider before:   What the hell did Valyrian steel do in Westeros at that time? Did Valyria even exist? Or was it made by someone else, who had similar technology? Why would the First Men call any material “dragonsteel,” when they didn’t know steel in the first place?   Hm.  I suppose there are three ways to interpret it:   Another hint to the existence of a pre-Valyrian civilization with Valyrian-like technology. In-universe anachronisms and misinterpretations, originating from the fact that the recorded history only began with the Andals, long after the Long Night.

The basis of it is that the North isn't necessary the north pole of Planetos and that if you travelled north of the wall you would come out somewhere west of the five forts.   Westerosi peoples are not the only ones who have legends about The Others and we have some evidence that people from around Assahi visited the Iron islands before the Andals. The sea stone chair is made of the same black stone as found there.   The people of Yi Ti belive it was a blood sacrifice that caused the rise of The Others in the first place and I wonder if they fought them (with Iron and fire) in Westeros before leaving them to The North and retreating behind the five forts, which they built solely to defend against the soldiers of the Long night.  So maybe soldiers of The Golden empire brought the Iron and left The Others in the North, where Old Nan, being one of the children of the forest, remembered how to kill them. Maybe the Yi Ti warriors left the dragonglass with the children of the forest as well.   Like I said, lots of tinfoil but if you are interested in my ravings I will make a post.  And cracking spot!"

We get Ned as a PoV character, but what we don't get from him is any hatred for Rhaegar. While Robert rages on about him, still obsessed after all these years, we get no impression that Ned feels even remotely the same way.  For all that he can be a cold fish (or wolf, whathaveyou), surely Ned would feel much the same way as Robert if Rhaegar had really dragged Lyanna off against her will. Certainly Ned loves his sister no less, and her death haunts him. I think the best explanation for Ned's lack of blame for Rhaegar is that he knew something (many things) that Robert doesn't, chiefly that Lyanna went willingly.

Perhaps Rickard knew (or Benjen?), but Brandon took off for King's Landing before anyone could tell him what was really going on? If everything that happened was catalysed by a miscommunication, that would almost make it more tragic."
pureasoiaf,39nyih,hockey_puck,18,Sat Jun 13 04:56:57 2015 UTC,"why wasn't she able to tell Ned or someone else in person?   She had already attempted to express her concerns about Robert to Ned. The problems are that a) Ned loved Robert like a brother and had a biased view of the situation, and b) was raised by Jon Arryn to be all honor, honor, and more honor. Breaking a betrothal is a serious affair. Remember the big show of it the Lannisters had to make of it with the help of the High Septon himself?  I find it plausible that had she gone willingly, she knew that she couldn't tell Ned in advance.   How stupid is it that Robert went to war over a girl and that made him suitable to oversee the function of a sovereign nation?    Jon Arryn started the war, not Robert. The Mad King had already brought the realm to a boiling point during his last years of his reign, and pushed Arryn over the edge when he commanded him to hand over his young wards, Ned and Robert.   It always seemed weird to me that a member of the great House Stark just went off to the Wall with the brigands.   The simple explanation would be that the author is showing us that the Starks still value the old ways. The realm has forgotten the importance of the Night's Watch, but some few remember. You mention House Royce; their words are actually ""We Remember"".  As for Benjen, Ned had already returned to Winterfell with an heir in hand when he left for the Wall. It's not that odd that he would leave. His job of being the Stark in Winterfell was over."
pureasoiaf,39nyih,GreendaleCC,27,Sat Jun 13 05:06:17 2015 UTC,"Her abduction didn't really have as much political effect as people tend to accredit it. The rebellion was primarily sparked by the executions of Ned Stark's brother and father. Lyanna's was a motivating factor for Robert and a PR strike against the Targaryens for stepping in on a betrothal, but that's it. For all we know, it could be public knowledge that Lyanna went willingly. The ""official story"" is what it is because that's what the new King wanted to believe. We see from Cersei's children how well the ""official story"" holds up behind closed doors."
pureasoiaf,39nyih,Rodents210,18,Sat Jun 13 03:49:19 2015 UTC,But it set into motions the chain of events. If lyanna stayed put Brandon wouldn't have gone to KL.
pureasoiaf,39nyih,DC1010,5,Sat Jun 13 05:39:34 2015 UTC,"Lyanna went willingly, and Ned, attempting to keep the family name clean, covered it up.  All high-born marriages are for political gain.  Think of Catelyn, Sansa, Arya, and Cersei's dialogues about marriage.  Catelyn was set to marry Brandon Stark.  When he died, her marriage was arranged to Ned.  She says she hardly knew him.  Sansa and Cersei drank the Flavor-Aid early on and were starry-eyed about their betrothals, even though they hardly knew the men.  Cersei learned quickly that Robert wasn't marriage material, and Sansa still seems surprised at how awful marriage can be.    The book is dotted with bad husband-wife pairings (or near-pairings), and women would've spoken/gossiped about it.     Brynden (Catelyn's uncle) rejected his betrothed, causing a life-long rift between Brynden and his brother. Walder Frey marries repeatedly and sires many, many bastards.  More than anyone else in the book. Stannis Baratheon and Selyse Florent.  'Nuff said. Balon Greyjoy and Alannys Harlaw (Balon was salty, and Alannys lost her mind; you can't tell me that was a happy marriage) Daeron Targaryan and Oleanna Redwyne (broken engagement).   Arya was leery about politically motivated marriage from the start, and if Arya and Lyanna were a lot alike, then I'm sure Lyanna was, too.  We don't get to see Arya hitting puberty and finish growing up in a high-born house, but we know Lyanna did. Even worse, Lyanna was betrothed to a man she didn't like, and she found a man -- a very powerful man -- who loved her.  There's no question she went willingly."

He let his friend Ned believe she was kidnapped so that history would unfold the way it was supposed to.  Rheagar has is brand of prophesy that he is obsessed with and Howland has his. Through Lyanna and the KotLT incident the two meet and compare notes and decide that certain unpleasant events need to occur in order to birth the PtwP. Rheagar and Howland convince Lyanna to buy in and play her part.  Then Rheagar plays his role and Howland plays his as well- on opposite sides of a war.

Perhaps, however, there will be a new throne by the end in which Jon may sit.

The rule of any king (besides perhaps the Night's King, if real) is limited to less than one life time, it is very brief, and in a big picture sense, very inconsequential.  The second concern I have is that I feel like the whole universe of the book is teetering on complete collapse. Kingdoms are about to cease to exist as any truly meaningful delineation. It is going to be people who can die vs. people who can't die. Over the course of enough time, the army of the undead simply has to win, its just a matter of time. And as time goes on, they gradually, cumulatively, grow stronger. Which means that huge swaths of this series of books are going to need to be pointless. At some point, entire races, if not species, are going to need to be wiped out in order for there to be a true conclusion.

I think alot of the magical elements (warging, weirwood.net, glass candles, prophecies, resurrections, shadow demons, etc.) are purposely left ambiguous as far as specifically how and why they work.  If there was enough textual evidence to hint at a physical entity being behind R'hllor I think people would have pieced it together more by now.

Everything we've seen so far points to the magic attributed to R'hllor actually being personal magic.

The Rhoynish could tap into the Rhoynes water magic, but there was no Lady called mother Rhoyne.

pureasoiaf,39j1mb,Cathsaigh,2,Sat Jun 13 00:27:30 2015 UTC,"I think GRRM's point was that magic and the supernatural might exist irrespective of some higher power (be it a single god or many). Seeing the future in fire, seeing through trees and the sort are possible ""if you know the way"" and not because a God deems a certain human able to do it.   The ones capable of accessing these powers themselves might not be able to fully explain why they can. If this is the case than it's quite reasonable to expect that people think these powers as emanating from a higher power and so religions are born. We also know that visions are real but in every case they are as much a result interpretation as what is seen. If people project these visions on pre-existing beliefs it's easy to see how we have ""insight"" into what a god wants and the ""values"" of a cult, especially with thousands of years embellish them.  The aspects of magic seem more related to an aspect of life or of the world (ice - the others, nature - the children, fire - valyrians & r'hllor, death - the faceless men) than associated with a higher power. Being very ""in tune"" with the certain aspect seems to be the gateway to the certain type of magic more than anything else. Again, if this is correct than it's very reasonable to assume that over time the people that were extraordinarily apt at this come to be known as legendary beings or straight up incarnations of the respective god, even if that god wasn't even real to begin with.  Assuming Daenerys, one who survived fire unscathed, comes with her dragons and defeats the others how would she be remembered in 6,000 years ? An ancient hero reborn, the hand of R'hllor or an incarnation of the god himself ? But she was just Danny, a girl that embraced the fire at the deepest level.

She could feel tendrils spreading through her chest, like fingers of fire coiling around her heart, and on her tongue was a taste like honey and anise and cream, like mother’s milk and Drogo’s seed, like red meat and hot blood and molten gold. It was all the tastes she had ever known, and none of them … and then the glass was empty.   ACOK, Daenerys IV   It had a bitter taste, though not so bitter as acorn paste. The first spoonful was the hardest to get down. He almost retched it right back up. The second tasted better. The third was almost sweet. The rest he spooned up eagerly. Why had he thought that it was bitter? It tasted of honey, of new-fallen snow, of pepper and cinnamon and the last kiss his mother ever gave him.

My idea is that, whilst on the Isle of Faces, he was shown either a vision of the future, or multiple visions of multiple futures - perhaps one where the Others are victorious, and another where humanity prevails. I think he knows how important Jon Snow is to the fate of the world, and thus, after departing from the Isle of Faces he went straight to Harrenhal in time for the tourney (I believe it's mentioned in KOTLT that the crannogman - Howland - underwent some sort of magical experience then went directly to Harrenhal afterwards), so he could basically kick-start the events that lead to the birth of Jon Snow (if he wasn't there, no him getting bullied, no Lyanna protecting his honour, no mystery knight, no Rhaegar/Lyanna lovetimes and thus no Jon)."

Robert would have been set against Rhaegar from the moment he named Lyanna queen of love and beauty, but it's hard to see Brandon being outraged enough to go to King's Landing and call out Rhaegar if he thought Lyanna went willingly.

pureasoiaf,39i0fq,MarshmeloAnthony,11,Fri Jun 12 04:37:20 2015 UTC,"Lyanna was characterized as independent, strong-willed, an excellent rider, perhaps a truly impressive jouster (if the tale of the KotLT is to be so interpreted), so seemingly not easy to kidnap.  ...But also consider this:  -Lyanna was clearly no fool. Why would she feign being kidnapped? If she wanted to go with Rhaegar, why not leave a note? ""Dear father and Brandon, I've run off with the prince. Sorry. Don't start a war."" Crisis averted. She most have known that Brandon/Rickard/Robert would raise all holy hell, unless she was completely oblivious to their characters, which she clearly wasn't. Faking a kidnapping just puts the heat on Rhaegar, the worst thing she could do.   -Lynna in Winterfell would indeed be hard to capture. But Lyanna in transit would be much easier, especially if she went off on one of her willful, free-spirited rides. Further, however good she was on a horse or with a shield, Rhaegar would have been accompanied by the likes of Arthur Dayne...so...there's that.  -Lyanna was vocally opposed to marrying Robert because ""he will never keep to one bed."" But Rhaegar was married, and a father of two legitimate royal heirs.  -Finally, I don't see how Lyanna could have actually corresponded with Rhaegar enough to be convinced of any prophecy or have any have any reason to want to run off with him, or even correspond enough to successfully coordinate her willing, but deceptive, flight. They had never met before the Tourney at Harenhall, and she lived a thousands leagues away, in a castle, and was betrothed to another."
pureasoiaf,39i0fq,chillybonesjones,14,Fri Jun 12 00:03:53 2015 UTC,"Very interesting stuff. Let me try to tackle some of it.   -I don't believe she feigned being kidnapped. In fact, the kidnapping story seems to be Robert's invention, or perhaps Ned's. When we've heard of it in other contexts (Barristan comes to mind) it sounds more like a tragic love story. I also don't think she could have predicted a war. Remember, it started not because they ran away together (or because she was kidnapped) but because *Aerys killed Brandon and Rickard Stark).   I mean, even if she expected Brandon to lose his shit, how could she have known Aerys would murder him?  -I doubt Dayne rode anywhere near as well as Lyanna. It's an interesting point your raise here, though. I've never considered the ""how"" of her alleged abduction. Probably because we just don't know the timeline.  -That was a polite way of saying that Robert was a whore. There's a difference between falling in love with someone outside of your marriage, and being a total manslut. Ostensibly, anyway.   -I think Harrenhall was where they fell in love. Or she fell in love and he went about his kooky prophecy stuff. The brevity of their relationship doesn't invalidate it. People fall madly in love very quickly all the time.   But this is all good food for thought. Good stuff, man!"
pureasoiaf,39i0fq,almost_frederic,4,Fri Jun 12 01:38:06 2015 UTC,"Nice response, but I have to strongly disagree with you on this:    I doubt Dayne rode anywhere near as well as Lyanna   That can't be true. Arthur Dayne is a legendary knight. Lyanna's reputation as a great rider has lasted years beyond her death, but it's crazy to think that the finest, most thoroughly-trained knight in Westeros doesn't ""ride nearly as well"" as anyone, especially a 16-yr old. I mean, Dayne would have had thousands more hours on horse, chasing and fighting bands of criminals and rebels in the woods, training himself and others, fighting in tourneys, etc.   To add one more thing, I've thought Arya's wild ride from Harwin in the Riverlands might be a type of reverse foreshadowing of how Lyanna was captured, especially given the repeated mention of their physical resemblance and Harwin saying something like:   You ride like a Northerner    after he catches her."
pureasoiaf,39i0fq,chillybonesjones,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:15:54 2015 UTC,Being a knight doesn't necessarily mean you're a spectacular rider. I doubt Lyanna's skill with a horse is just flavor text.

I love the way Lyanna is characterized as much as the next reader, but this is silly. It's like saying ""this kid was the best skater I've ever seen! I doubt Wayne Gretzky could skate half as well."" It's crazy.  Ned called Dayne ""the finest knight he'd ever seen."" I really doubt he would've said that about someone who didn't ride half as well as his 16-yr old sister."
pureasoiaf,39i0fq,MarshmeloAnthony,2,Fri Jun 12 18:08:43 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that there's more to being a knight than riding. We hear several characters describe one person being a better lance, but another person is a better sword."
pureasoiaf,39i0fq,chillybonesjones,0,Fri Jun 12 19:28:26 2015 UTC,"Obviously. Being a skilled rider is a necessary condition but not a sufficient condition for being a great knight.

But I think I'm debating with some pretty committed Lyanna fans, so I'm going to tap out now."
pureasoiaf,39i0fq,MarshmeloAnthony,2,Fri Jun 12 22:46:59 2015 UTC,"Nah, just don't think ""Arthur Dayne was with him therefore he could kidnap Lyanna"" makes much sense, that's all."

Further, however good she was on a horse or with a shield, Rhaegar would have been accompanied by the likes of Arthur Dayne...so...there's that.   I've been trying to figure out if we know more about the circumstances of Lyanna's ""abduction""...are there any details out there other than Rhaegar ventured forth with 2 kingsguard and came back with her?  For some reason I have the impression this happened in the Riverlands, did I make that up or was it mentioned somewhere?  Your mention of her free spirited rides would explain a lot though, I just couldn't think of a scenario where she'd be abductable."

pureasoiaf,39i0fq,LadyRavenEye,4,Fri Jun 12 13:23:45 2015 UTC,I always thought that Lyanna was the Knight of the Laughing Tree at Harrenhall.  Been a while but I think she is described as having a bit of wolf blood in her as well.  I can't see her going anywhere unwillingly.
pureasoiaf,39i0fq,_hedix_,11,Fri Jun 12 05:47:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if she was the KOTLT, she was unhorsing knights, and she was known to be a fast rider. Here's the ""wolf blood"" bit you referenced (Ned's talking to Arya):   You have a wildness in you, child. 'The wolf blood,' my father used to call it. Lyanna had a touch of it, and my brother Brandon more than a touch. It brought them both to an early grave.   AGOT, Arya II"

But we cannot discount she was sixteen years old, while Rhaegar was mid-20s, heir to the throne, already married, grown-ass man.  I know it's Westeros and blah blah people had to mature differently, but Dany the sixteen year old copes with the stresses of rulership by banging the daylights out of Daario.  Lyanna the sixteen year old could have easily been persuaded by silver-tongued and -haired prince Rhaegar to go with him because she was horny and desperate."

pureasoiaf,39i0fq,divinesleeper,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:09:25 2015 UTC,"Willing imo.  IIRC, the only one who mentions the abduction is Robert. Lyanna migth have harbored some feelings towards Rhaegar. When he was playing his harp at the Tourney feast, she started crying. Benjen was teasing her for it, so she spilled a drink on his head.  There is then Meera's story of the Knight of the Laughing Tree (Bran II ASOS) and probably the best evidence that the story was more complicated than a simple abduction. KLT was most probably Lyanna. Weirwood as a sigil suggests someone of the North, small stature suggests it was a woman, armor was makeshift, voice was altered, and Lyanna had originally witnessed when the Frey boys were harassing Howland Reed. Meera is also surprised how Bran doesn't know the story, suggesting KLT was a Stark. Paranoid about a mystey knight, Mad Aerys sends Rhaegar to track KLT. The next day, he crowns Lyanna. I've always assumed that the two met on that occasion and perhaps fallen in love. It was all the right vibes of an ultimate Forbidden Love story.  And also Ned doesn't seem to harbor any hard feeling towards Rhaegar. When he reminisces, there is sadness rather than anger, a feeling of tragedy. Surely, if he believed Rhae raped his sister, he would have been mad."
pureasoiaf,39ipjk,TheJankins,17,Fri Jun 12 00:08:38 2015 UTC,"Pre war of the five kings, they would have had a chance convincing Ned Stark. Outside of that, Ser Aliser's visit to kings landing showed the rest of westeros' opinion of the far north.   Tyrion was the single friend they had south of Most Calin. The south would not react in any substantial way until word comes that the wall had fallen and refugees began streaming through the neck.   Humans, as a species, generally react to physical stimulus. We can foresee doom, but rarely is anything done about it until it's too late. See global warming  So with the north leaderless and in shambles, there is no one lord that if he/she would lend their strength to the NW it would make Southron lords pay attention.   Just my opinion!"
pureasoiaf,39ipjk,logs28,2,Fri Jun 12 00:46:38 2015 UTC,"1) They tried and they tried, but no one would listen. I recall a conversation between Mormont and Tyrion, before the war started. Mormont begged Tyrion to talk to the King (Robert), to the great Knight and Kingsguard Jaime and to the Warden of the West Tywin, to make them help the Night's Watch. Tyrion promised he would and I truly believe he meant to. What he never told Mormont, out of a certain respect for the old bear, is that no one cared about them, that they would laught in Tyrion face if he tried to convince them. So yes, it was hopeless.   2) During the war? I don't think so. Someone would have to lead the forces of men and no one would relinquish command. Can you imagine Stannis or Robb allowing Tywin to lead? Or the other way around?  3) Not much. They really tried everything they could. I guess they could have sent a live white Walker to King's Landing, but I can't see how."

It is a great ""second/third/fourth"" read through opportunity. Obviously, a certain level of fluency is necessary before trying this (and some of the vocabulary is archaic), but the stories are great and if your fluency is close to good enough, I'm amazed at how much the story broadens when you go through a translation. It has been so widely translated, too, that the translations are generally easy to come by."

A worldwide catastrophe/apocalypse is just about almost in full swing and most of Westeros is still fighting over the worlds most pointy chair.     Lets not forget get that A Game of Thrones is about the civil war called the War of the Five Kings and its aftermath...      The series is called A Song of Ice and Fire.  Thats the main theme, thats the main battle everyone should focus on, the conflict between the two primary sources of magic in that world.      As we move deeper into the series (if GRRM ever finishes)  allegiances will no longer matter.  Only allegiances to live or die will matter.       Just as the Nights Watch allied themselves with the Wildlings, all the kings and lords of Westeros and Essos will need to band together to fight the true menace.   That's a huge underlying theme in the novels.   Westerosi people aren't seeing the big picture no matter how much the Nights Watch warns them.    I mean thats the NWs main purpose, and all the people arent giving any care to them.     So if your looking to pledge your allegiance to a side, as you said, it might be good to pledge fealty to the northern resistance against the Others.   Against the army of the dead.       To me, that would be the Nights Watch & company.  I would put my hopes on the ""side that fights for the living""        Thats why my shield is straight up Black.

I personally think, and I know this may sound far fetched, that the war against the Others was ended with a piece, sidled with a marriage between the King of the Winter, and a Other bride. Their seat was the Nightfort, and they were there to make sure no one would break the piece and cross the Wall.

I am a former Stannis Supporter, but then I converted.  Regardless of whether or not you suspect Bran is being courted by evil forces (I do), there is no doubt that Jaime's first real action in the novels/show to cripple Bran set him on a path to become more powerful than anyone ever imagined (shades of Darth Vader being a real jerk to Obi Wan only to make a complete change and kill the Emperor, restoring balance to the Force).   Consider his deeds:  • He saved all of King's Landing from a fiery death by murdering the Mad King, making him by far the biggest savior of human life among the characters. Notably, he saved those lives regardless of house loyalty or station in life. Yet he never boasts about this, and the only time he even admits it is to his ""love"" Brienne when he is broken and naked, baring all to her.  • He saved Brienne in the Harrenhal Bear Pit.   • He defends Brienne from Loras' claim that she killed Renly, saving her life again.   • He gives Brienne Oathkeeper, doing his best to follow his oath to Catelyn to protect her children.   • He saved Tyrion from execution at risk of his own neck.   • He confesses the truth about Tysha, even though it costs him Tyrion's respect.   • He offers mercy to the defenders of Riverrun.   • He gets revenge for Pretty Pia in Harrenhal, having Ilyn Payne execute one of the men who raped her.   • He brokers peace throughout the Riverlands without resorting to combat."

It actually works really well with the theory that Jon Snow will rise as the Night's King. It's just flimsy. A lot of his evidence seems made up on the spot though I'll have to reread it for more definitive answers. My days are pretty dull so I may do that.

That would be way to fairytale like.   Well any king is a problem, even if they are good, their heirs can be madman again.    Tommen of House Baratheon? Or should I say Lannister.   To early to tell, he has thoughts of his own, seems kind, and has a good alliance behind him.    fAegon? Even if he is a Blackfyre.   Yeah, except that someone in his camp has Grayscale, which is going to kill everyone.    Stannis the Mannis   No, he will need to be the next Lord Commander. He is too strict, and does not inspire people.    Daenerys Stormborn   Yeah, by the time she will reach Westeros she will have learned a lot, especially from Tyrion. Sadly by that time she will be about 70, so also no.   Or some other party that I'm forgetting that you think has a possibility to sit the Iron Throne?   Littlefinger!

Stannis as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch...  He'd have to be defeated before he can accept something like that.  I guess Shireen immediately becomes Lady of Storm's End in that case.  Very interesting.  It is upsetting, though, that three of the major houses are down to almost no members.  Stark is actually doing pretty well, with Sansa, Arya, and Rickon.  There's only one Arryn left and he's sickly.  There are only two Baratheons left, Stannis and Shireen.  It's a very precarious position.  The Lannisters have plenty of cousins, not to mention Tommen and Myrcella.  Doran Martell has two kids still around.  Three Tyrell brothers and a sister (though one of the brothers is apparently not doing too well).  Oh, I forgot the Tullys!  Just one of those guys (and the Blackfish), but at least he got married, right?  The Greyjoys still have five family members hanging out.  Prediction: at least one of these major houses dies out.  I'm actually going with two: Baratheon and Arryn.  I predict Edmure makes it."
pureasoiaf,39cjhi,xiipaoc,3,Wed Jun 10 23:00:07 2015 UTC,"Well I think what will make him go into the NW will be the burning of Shrien, and the arrival of Dany. He sacrifices his daughter, to hold of the others, or maybe she gets sacrificed by Mel and Sylis, to revive Jon, he finds out, goes mad, slays them both, and finally realizes that he can get out of becoming King by joining. Or that happens, then Dany arrives, and he has no claim anymore, and no chance, and joins the NW. Don't know to whom Storms end falles to, probably Dany through the female line, her grand grand aunt was Stannises grandmother. Or one of Roberts bastards gets legitimized. Gendry or Eddric.   The Arryns have planty of heirs, not in a direct line, but there is Harry the heir, and there are the Arryns from Gulltown.  The Lannisters are still doing fine, there is Tyrion, Mycella, one of Kevins sons, and then the missing Tyrek Lannister. But we already know, Mycella and Tommen won't make it that much further, and just two more deaths, and who ever holds Tyrek, holds Casterlyrock.   Sansa, Arya and Rickon are also Tullys, through their mother. If something would happen to Edmure and his son, it would fall to one of them."

As for actually ruling a quasi-medieval kingdom with the aim of developing it into a nation-state with a functioning government, Stannis it is.  He's your man for justice, rule of law, public investment without corruption, commerce, safe roads, all that sort of boring public administration stuff."
pureasoiaf,39cjhi,raisjakbar,5,Thu Jun 11 00:21:45 2015 UTC,"We do not know whether Stannis would have gone through with burning Edric, but the very fact that he entertained the possibility is evidence that he may not be your man for justice and rule of law."
pureasoiaf,39cjhi,Cathsaigh,-1,Wed Jun 10 21:17:17 2015 UTC,Stannis believes he is AA reborn and therefore its his destiny and duty to protect the realm from the up and coming long night. This is the reason he would ever consider making a sacrifice of his own blood.
pureasoiaf,39cjhi,chr20b,3,Thu Jun 11 01:30:15 2015 UTC,And yet burning an innocent is neither just nor lawful.
pureasoiaf,39cjhi,Cathsaigh,-1,Thu Jun 11 09:49:21 2015 UTC,"Laws are not absolute and intent of the perpetrator matters. Surely I dont need to explain to you that there is a difference between someone burning someone for sadistic pleasure and someone doing so because they believe this is what is required to save the world (stannis has looked into the fires afterall). Furthermore Stannis clearly did not want to burn Edric Storm and even seemed partly relived when Davos made that choice for him.   The law is never black and white but very grey and Stannis as a character clearly understands this dynamic which is evident by his treatment of Davos (rewarding him for his good deed and punishing him for the bad). Having said all that Stannis is no angel and is a fallable human being full of regrets but sometimes to rule effectively and justly you have to do somethings and at greatly unjust towards other people. (Just look how Dany's constant compromises weren't going to work in the long run).  Surely it shouldnt have to be said by now that events and characters in ASOIAF are complex and morally ambiguous. Good and evil, just and unjust are all relative terms."

With one of those a just ruler would allow you to plead insanity and  you might not lose your head. To burn an innocent to save the world may be moral by utilitarianism, but that doesn't make it lawful or just.  If a burning is needed Stannis has the right to burn himself and those whose crimes merit death under the law.   The law is never black and white but very grey and Stannis as a character clearly understands this dynamic which is evident by his treatment of Davos (rewarding him for his good deed and punishing him for the bad).   No, not for Stannis. He sees black, smuggling, and gives punishment. He sees white, smuggling for him, and rewards.   Having said all that Stannis is no angel and is a fallable human being full of regrets but sometimes to rule effectively and justly you have to do somethings and at greatly unjust towards other people.

pureasoiaf,39cjhi,Cathsaigh,4,Thu Jun 11 10:40:02 2015 UTC,"If you believe that all of the Starks are dead (with the exception of Sansa, who is both missing AND compromised by her marriage to a Lannister)...and you dismiss Jon as either a bastard or a member of the Night's Watch, then you're really only left with two choices:  1)  Robert's children are the rightful heirs, which means backing Tommen.  I find this to be an impossible pill to swallow, given how many Northerners were killed by Lannister men and/or Lannister allies.  2)  Robert's children are not the rightful heirs, which means you go to his brothers...specifically, Stannis.  Stannis is also a quasi-ally of Jon Snow, offering to install him as LP of the North, so he's got that going for him, which is nice.  But if Stannis dies, as I suspect he will, NOW we have a real question, because I don't believe for one second that Shireen will ever be the reigning Queen.  She is, at BEST, pittied.  She's not going to be commanding armies, etc.  So if Stannis is dead, it's got to come down to Lannister vs. Targaryen.  The North doesn't seem to have been anti-Targaryen in general...they're just anti The Mad King.  Given the choice between Lannister and Targaryen, they've got to go Targaryen.  As for WHICH Targaryen...well...one is the main character of the series and the other one is a pawn, so..."

The Blackfyres and Baratheon-Lannisters are out because the Iron Throne must never pass through the female line, per Great Council 101 AC. Daenerys is the only hope left (because if we break the Great Council we must break it as little as possible) unless there is a King in the North, whose name is STARK."
pureasoiaf,39cjhi,psythedude,2,Thu Jun 11 15:20:54 2015 UTC,"the Iron Throne must never pass through the female line, per Great Council 101 AC   I think this depends on who you ask.   According to Archmaester Gyldayn, in the eyes of many, the council of 101 AC established an iron precedent on matters of succession: that the Iron Throne could not pass to a woman, or to a male descendant of a woman.   So in fiction we have different perspectives.  In this SSM we get the version I am more familiar with. Females can inherit, but only after all eligible males.   George replied that women came after all men in the Targaryen succession after TDWD. Something interesting and neatly explains Daena and the rest not becoming queen."
pureasoiaf,39cjhi,GreendaleCC,2,Wed Jun 10 21:18:51 2015 UTC,"never pass through the female line, per Great Council 101 AC   I don't think so. I think the male line just goes always first. Remember, Robert has his claim through a female line."
pureasoiaf,39cjhi,FuriousFap42,2,Wed Jun 10 23:56:29 2015 UTC,"Robert's claim is by right of conquest, or the throne would have passed to Viserys. His lineage was just used to decide which of the alliance that brought down the Targaryens got to rule."
pureasoiaf,39cjhi,LawrenciuM94,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:06:57 2015 UTC,"No, officially his claim comes from his grandmother. Only Aegons claim comes from that. It is mentioned on several occasions that his claim comes from Rhaella. I practice, it is of course him standing in KL with the bigger army. Also, Aegon III had his claim through his mother, Rhenyris. That was the guy who ruled after the dance of the dragons."
pureasoiaf,39cjhi,FuriousFap42,2,Thu Jun 11 08:52:45 2015 UTC,"No, you can't claim you're the heir before the true heir is dead. It's similar to Renly declaring above Stannis or if the Arryns tried to claim above Robert. Unless he's disinheriting all Targaryens on accounts of being mad, but that wouldn't make sense either considering that's where you're saying his claim comes from."
pureasoiaf,39cjhi,LawrenciuM94,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:08:23 2015 UTC,"Look at real history. You can. You just have the bigger backing, and then everyone acts like you are the only true heir. Also, look at Westerosi history. Children were sometimes left out because a boyking would have been no good to anyone. Like Aerion Briteflames son Maegor."
pureasoiaf,39cjhi,FuriousFap42,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:22:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I'm saying, having the bigger backing usually involves taking by force, which is what Robert does. It's mentioned that Robert has Targaryen lineage but it's said that his lineage is used to establish him as the leader of the rebellion, his lineage does not make him the rightful heir. So if he knows he's not the rightful heir and he's taking it by force then surely he's king by right of conquest. If Robert was placed as king by a great council like the one of 101AC then yeah, he'd be using his lineage to place above the rightful heir. But that's not what happens, he conquers in order to gain the throne and place his claim above Viserys'. So he's king by right of conquest."
pureasoiaf,39cjhi,LawrenciuM94,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:36:50 2015 UTC,"I get what you are saying, but like at the end of the war of the roses, when the Tudors took over, there is a defacto reason for why you are king, and something you need to justify your claim. Roberts rule, in the eyes of the realm, the maesters and the Lords, at least officially, justified through his claim based on his grandmother. He may think it was through conquest, but unless you have dragons, you also need a family claim"
pureasoiaf,39cjhi,FuriousFap42,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:22:00 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I don't think his rule had anything to do with his grandmother. Robert ruled because Robert was strong, he made his enemies into friends and treated his friends even better. The realm loved him, or at least enough of it did to make the rest fear his wrath. If you took away the fact that he had a Targaryen grandmother he could still easily hold the kingdom.  Balon said he rebelled against Robert because the ironborn were subdued by dragonlords and he was no dragonlord. I don't think anyone saw him as blood of the dragon and for good reason. The reason he was respected and able to hold the kingdom was because of the man he was and the friends he had. Maybe officially the maesters wrote down about his grandmother to make him look like a bit less of a brute but it had no truth to it. When his ""heirs"" are no longer on the iron throne the maesters will not write of his legal claim, they will write of his conquest. Whether they think of him as a usurper or a hero who finally took down the tyrant dragonlords depends on who sits the iron throne but I don't think anyone will disagree that he was a conqueror."

You made me king, you could at least have the courtesy to listen when I talk, damn you. Look at me, Ned. Look at what kinging has done to me.

The Boltons are the only ones that can claim that title, at least for now.

The only real advancements seem to have been moving from a Bronze Age (First Men) to Iron (Andals) and steel. The Valyrian culture seems to have been more advanced adding Valyrian Steel, more advanced building techniques, a partial focus on the collection of knowledge (altho it seems it was mainly focused on magic and the like) and that culture is completely lost. Only a handful of individuals seems to have some of those skills left and then only ""minor"" ones like reforging Valyrian Steel, not making it themselves."

I Bravos they have discovered the principle of industrial production, that gives them a big advantage on the see. And they have modernized the Banking system. Littlefinger will bring a better understanding of economics to Westeros, and many of the free cities have more or less well functioning democracies. Those ideas and techniques will slowly spill over to Westeros. Also, what kept many people from perusing the ""natural sciences"" because Dragons and magic gave power, and not more natural things. But once the series ends, and maybe Dragons are dead, and magic goes back once again, people will maybe go with these things from the free cities"
pureasoiaf,39dqyp,FuriousFap42,3,Thu Jun 11 11:44:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply. I would counter with principles like banking dating back to pre-Roman eras in our world and even modern banking has existed since the 14th century or so. Glass blowing also has existed for over twenty centuries and greenhouses (which I assume winter gardens to be) have existed for centuries, since the Roman Era. Comparing their history to ours, these to me do not seem to be examples of strong technological advancement on their part.  I am interested in a source for industrialization in Braavos though. Are you talking about concepts like a moving assembly line or just compartmentalized production/division of labour? If the latter, I believe once reading this having been done for centuries in China before Europe started the Industrial Revolution, mainly for the production of metal implements (tools, weapons, armor, etc).  I agree that we are seeing one of Fantasy's main tropes at work where magic substitutes technological advancement on a large scale. What I do wonder about is that the dragons have been extinct (as far as we are aware) for ~150 years and Valyria has been gone for several hundred years as a bastion of magical advancement while not seeing widespread advancement of technology during this period. Of course it could be theorized that the Maesters, apart from trying to repress magic, are hoarding all of this advancement. But seeing as there are rogue maesters around (Qyburn, trying to advance medical science is a prime example and being ousted for it) this seems unlikely to be happening and staying a secret. They seem perfectly happy keeping to the current state of things."

Lorath - ceremonial roles of princes are elected for life, but it is ruled by a council of magisters. We do not know how these come to power but it seems doubtful this happens in a democratic way and is likely a form of despotism Myr - again ruled by magisters, and unknown how they come to power Lys - also magisters, see Myr and Lorath   but again, a new idea for Westeros, that does not produce mad Kings.

If you are referring to WorldoIaF I will definitely re-read it when I am home this weekend.

What I do wonder about is that the dragons have been extinct (as far as we are aware) for ~150 years and Valyria has been gone for several hundred years as a bastion of magical advancement while not seeing widespread advancement of technology during this period.   Yes, but they still relied on that. Their mindset, still is, that magic stuff and prophecies bring power. Maybe they will snap out of that, once the next war of Ice and Fire is over, maybe not.    Of course it could be theorized that the Maesters, apart from trying to repress magic, are hoarding all of this advancement.   That kind of reminds me of China again.    But seeing as there are rogue maesters around (Qyburn, trying to advance medical science is a prime example and being ousted for it) this seems unlikely to be happening and staying a secret.   But those rogues don't have a base to spread their discoveries.   Remember for how long we did develop nearly nothing above bronze and steal?   Also something is coming that will kick start their development. The gray plague. The pest had a huge (positive) effect on Europe. I will put links to educational YouTube videos down there, that talk about some of that.   But what they really need is gunpowder. Guns made knights replaceable, and made men more equal. I have this personal pet theory, that Tyrion will invent the printing press. He has a mind for such things, and it would just be soooo nice.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PLBmUVYYeg  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Zdmd4J7TI  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN-II_jBzzo&index=19&list=PLBDA2E52FB1EF80C9  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vufba_ZcoR0&index=22&list=PLBDA2E52FB1EF80C9"

I fully agree this would kickstart a lot of advancement out of military need, a field that seems to be driving a lot of Westeros' advancement (not unlike our own history of course). Combined with Valyrian Steel gunpowder must be very interesting.    Are you talking about concepts like a moving assembly line or just compartmentalized production/division of labor?   Yes, in their dock, they can produce a galleon in one day using that. English is not my primary language so sometimes I have the right term in my head but don't know how to transfer it to English.   Do you have a source for this? Not doubting you are right but I'm interested in reading the original text about this.   The gray plague   This could indeed be interesting to watch. I'm wondering where this (for now) small part of the storyline will lead and if it's just used as a way to even the odds in Mereen or if there will be a bigger storyline in this.

In Mereen, they have the bloody flux. JonCon has Grayscale, which the dick brought to Westeros. Varis told the small counsel, that the gray plague is already ravaging Yiti.    Do you have a source for this? Not doubting you are right but I'm interested in reading the original text about this.    WoIaF Bravos chapter. :   but the true wonder is the Arsenal. There, one of the purplehulled war galleys of Braavos can be built in a day. All the vessels are constructed following the same design, so that all the many parts can be prepared in advance, and skilled shipbuilders work upon different sections of the vessel simultaneously to hasten the labor. To organize such a feat of engineering is unprecedented; one need only look at the raucous, confused construction in the shipyards of Oldtown to see the truth of this.   About Braavos, I went with the statement on WikioIaF about what happens when the Sealord dies.(from your other comment, but I already had http://asearchoficeandfire.com open, and had searched for Bravos, for the previous quote)   Neither prince nor king commands in Braavos, where the rule belongs to the Sealord, chosen by the city's magisters and keyholders from amongst the citizenry by a process as convoluted as it is arcane.   out of military need, a field that seems to be driving a lot of Westeros' advancement (not unlike our own history of course).   Yes, this often drives progress, but what makes the progress possible, is trade with foreign lands."

pureasoiaf,39dqyp,ethanGeltan,2,Tue Jun 16 01:14:43 2015 UTC,"It feels like the world experiences much more apocolypse than ours, so technology and knowledge get lost much more often. That's why you have these weird little advanced tech in odd places with the links apparently lost. How Plantetos looks in the next 1000 years is highly dependent on the next crisis, winter, ghost grass etc... who survives and how good a job they and organizations like the Maesters do to sustain enlightenment. If I had to guess things like engines would probably be developed within the next 1000 years given the tech we see now."

pureasoiaf,399egx,skylerb123,49,Wed Jun 10 05:09:29 2015 UTC,I thought the reason why he hated Tom was because of the floppy fish song Tom wrote about Edmure not being able to sexually perform.
pureasoiaf,399egx,superlibby,7,Wed Jun 10 06:16:02 2015 UTC,this is on the right track. Edmure flips out bc Edmure and Tom have a history. there's mention of it earlier in that same book of Edmure not liking Tom for reasons having to do with a girl (or at least I believe that is what Lem says) ... and not that song. Although i'm sure the song didn't help quell any animosity.
pureasoiaf,399egx,DefiantBidet,2,Wed Jun 10 20:13:31 2015 UTC,Gotta love how GRRM makes references of this stuff earlier and ties it all up on some circle of life deal. First mention of it was in the the AGOT chapter where Catelyn takes Tyrion.
pureasoiaf,399egx,goldmouthdawg,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:08:28 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure its both. Edmure couldn't perform so Tom bedded the wench, and later wrote the song about eds floppy fish."

According to Tom's page on the asoiaf wiki, he banged the girl that Edmure was supposed to lose his virginity to. Then when Edmure came around to sleep with the girl himself, he was having difficulty due to his drunkenness. Tom then wrote a song about a ""floppy fish"" which I imagine he sang loudly at every tavern he went to, causing much embarrassment to poor Edmure."

It makes the house vulnerable to all sorts of things, things that you would easily have been rid with have you just killed that singer or at least silenced him."

pureasoiaf,399egx,frapalinger,-1,Thu Jun 11 13:33:23 2015 UTC,"I understand your point but I stick to my view of things. I'd rather have a singer killed than have a rumor about the last heir of the house suffering from impotence.

pureasoiaf,399egx,bilscuits,9,Wed Jun 10 07:25:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I thought he was just afraid because Tom started playing the Rains of Castamere.

pureasoiaf,3968h4,Kruppstahlterminator,20,Tue Jun 9 15:33:27 2015 UTC,"Cat is not dead.    I'd argue that Cat is dead, but her body is reanimated. The memories LSH carries are residual, but Cat isn't operating that body. This is just nitpicking in a way, but LSH does show us that there is something between a mindless wight and a Beric D.    Everyone is sure Jon is not dead.    I'm still 50/50 on this one. I'd be surprised if GRRM killed him definitively, but I was also surprised by the Red Wedding. If he isn't dead dead and burnt to ashes, then he could resurrect, reanimate or just survive.    I am sure the Hound is not dead. Definitely not. The septon who showed Brienne Sandors grave probable gave Clegane a second chance to do something good in his life and nursed him.    Don't tell /r/asoiaf or /r/gameofthrones I said this, but I think his character arc is finished. I agree completely that in Westeros there is a gravedigger who is most likely Sandor. I think that this is just a nice bit of writing for fans of the books. I don't believe the character will actively return to the story.    Even Rhaegars son isn't dead.    I'm in the group that thinks Aegon died when the Mountain killed him. This other kid is just a cloth dragon.    The Mountain is not dead (well...)   Mindless reanimated hulk is pretty much mindless wight to me, and I don't consider that alive. Mobile, but not alive.   Also I'm sure he won't kill characters like Tyrion or especially Daenerys.   I would be shocked if we get to the end of the last book and Dany is still alive. She is the lovely girl who escaped death and assassination, acquired dragons, won over untold followers, pulled Westerosi supporters to her side while still across the sea, (eventually) returned to Westeros, and (most likely) played a large role in the wars to come. It's only natural for her to survive and rule; thus, she will likely die. Tyrion - I'd give 60:40::alive:dead by the end.     ..... No one is dead. No one.   A girl must become no one.    I totally get what you are saying though, but I believe GRRM will continue to find ways to Red Wedding us."
pureasoiaf,3968h4,DoctorToaster,4,Tue Jun 9 23:41:31 2015 UTC,"I support that Cat is dead (reanimated, monstrous spirit of vengeance is not Cat--it's as you say, the whisper of a ghost of a purpose).  I think Jon isn't.  I don't see that its confirmed that he ""died"".  Got wrecked, maybe.  But not died.  So him coming back isn't relevant.  I think the Hound is dead-dead.  Gregor, I think, is dead.  The body is not done, yet.  And Dany is going to wed Stannis and they're going to have babies and it's going to be awesome."
pureasoiaf,3968h4,jwords,0,Thu Jun 11 19:54:57 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard this Dany + Stannis tinfoil. In your tinfoil, is Selyse dead, or does Stannis just have two wives?"

I just can't shake this notion--never have been able to--that the endgame for Dany is to take the throne and the only candidate I see being able to fulfill the political role is Stannis.  Robert was kind.  His kids will die (I think that's a given).  Renly is gone.  Stannis has the same ""best claim"" that Robert had plus he's going to have the North (I fully believe he's going to kick the Boltons).  Lannisters are done.  Tyrells are pretty much done, just rich.  Martells are not that relevant.  Stannis and Dany usher in a new Westeros--no love there, between them, all practicality."
pureasoiaf,3968h4,jwords,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:08:42 2015 UTC,"I generally agree with you.  I think it's an interesting question of ""What Next?"" if Daenerys does, indeed, die by the end of the series.  In my mind, she's going to ultimately end up married to Jon Snow, with Tyrion as her Hand (which we've already seen he's quite good at).    With Daenerys dead and no surviving human children (or siblings or cousins or anything) I think people will turn to Jon to continue ruling, with Tyrion continuing as his Hand."

That is what the story of the clanking dragon sign that Meribald tells Brienne is about.

Sandor is still alive, but the Hound is dead. You may say I am doing some semantics bs, but I am not. The character transformed. He is as good as dead, no physical death required.    Even Rhaegars son isn't dead   Well, I believe so, but okay.    The Mountain is not dead (well...)   well... Oberin is. And Gregor as well. Some Frankenknight is not the same as a once living person.   Quentin is. Probably. But I know what you mean. Briennes ""death"" in aFfC was kind of the same. But, Rob is dead, Ned is, Oberin, Quentin, Drogo, and many minor characters. And we are getting closer to the end. Barry will die next, at least before he will get a chance to talk to Dany again. Dany, Jon and Tyrion are save until the last 300 pages of aDoS. But Jmaie, Brienne, Arya, Aegon, JonCon, Jorah and Theon are not save anymore. As soon as there is a narrative reason for it, one of them can bite the dust."
pureasoiaf,3968h4,ginkomortus,3,Wed Jun 10 17:03:47 2015 UTC,It seems you aggree that Martin will only kill who isn't usefull for the story anymore.
pureasoiaf,3968h4,Cathsaigh,3,Wed Jun 10 17:14:19 2015 UTC,"Well, my possible german? friend, every death has it's purpose. Ned, was like Obi Wan, the father figure whose death set things in motion. The RW ended the war of the fife Kings, all the deaths have a purpose. That's why one of the heads of the Dragon will have to die, that's why Barry is doomed, why either Brienne or Jamie will die, probably Brienne, that's why you can kiss Tommen and Mycella good bye, that's why there is a lot of death a head of us. And, yes, I agree, the deaths are not random, but they are mostly not killed of because they have no use anymore, like the Hound was, or Syrio, but because their death influences what goes on, and the other characters, to move the story along."

pureasoiaf,394v5w,turuleka,2,Tue Jun 9 13:21:45 2015 UTC,"Another thing to keep in mind is that this happens during peace time, so I image there were less restrictions on NW (that volunteered like Benjen). Would be a completely different story in Winter and times of war."

I know that their vows tell them to forget their old lives. But realistically on a royal visit at your brother's place, the Lord Commander would want you to go even just for political reasons (recruit new men, or ask for new men).   I think a person from the Night's Watch also visits Ned in King's Landing asking for more men (don't quite remember this in the book but definitely in the show)."

It's a nice change of tone after asoiaf, not as complex but much more upbeat and just a joy to read.  First thing I'd do is spending way too much time on the wiki and read up on the complete ancestry of every single Targaryens and minor character :) It's crazy how complex those books are"

pureasoiaf,393vpq,SerAlastarButtons,7,Tue Jun 9 22:08:11 2015 UTC,"I'm reading The First Law trilogy by Joe Abercrombie now.  Same complex characterization and ultra gritty tone.  Unique POV characters.  Simpler world building and a more focused story (a positive if you ask me).  Probably about the same level of magic, though you could argue it has more.  I really like the role that magic is playing so far though.  It's only three books, and each is shorter than ASOIAF (another positive), but there are a few spinoff books in the same world that I'm pretty sure I'll be diving into when i'm done (only midway through B2 so far)."
pureasoiaf,393vpq,basefibber,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:50:00 2015 UTC,"Definitely the first law! Excellent triology. Especially the well worked out characters are awesome and will make you take the books serious. The main strength of asoiaf are the complex minded characters, too.  But one shouldn't read the sequels IMO. They are flat and include not much more than a flat remake of the first three books, just with more violence and sex. The trilogy is awesome, the spinoff books aren't. I just want to warn you. Before buying them it would be wise to get some samples."
pureasoiaf,393vpq,Kruppstahlterminator,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:40:40 2015 UTC,That's disappointing to hear.  I hadn't heard that yet.  I wonder why they are so different.
pureasoiaf,393vpq,basefibber,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:23:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe the main problem is too that they don't have actually to do with the story of the triology. You won't hear about Jezal or Logen or whats going on with Khalul and Bayaz anymore.  I don't see any character deep in the standalones, at least not like in the triology. The hole story of the first sequel is about a 21st century power women seeking for revenge. That is the only emotion, you could have reduced the book to the half of its pages. Also it seems forced that so many characters from the triology are included. That makes the plot look constructed: ""I have to include old chwracters without reason so the readers know the plot takes place in the same world"". Problem is that characters like Vitari or Cosca aren't made for being protagonists. It's like a POV chapter about Dumbledore in HP: It doesn't work, it destroys the character. Also the book is filled with a lot more detailed violance and sex without use for the plot. Detailed described ""cunts"" and a sex scene with inserting a finger in an anus seems to be there just to fill the sites. I couldn't stop reading the trio but stopped reading the sequs sometime. I expected to read what's going on with the great conflict and was dissappointed."

What characters, exactly, are supposed to be complex, and why? I think only two really caught my interest (Glokta, Bayaz), and both of them simply have such backstories that making them boring was just physically impossible. Everything else feels somehow bland and simple.  I do hope it gets better later on, but don’t really expect it to."

I made this thread, and you may like checking it out, but it does contain some spoiler hints and flat out spoilers. http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/2z9s6y/what_makes_the_first_law_trilogy_so_subversive/  I'm also reading the TOR reread in parallel, which I do recommend.  The author does a pretty good job of avoiding spoilers, but he does hint at some things by pointing out details that I otherwise would have missed.  I'm avoiding the comments though. http://www.tor.com/tag/first-law-trilogy-reread/  To answer your questions more directly, I would almost say that Bayaz seems to be one of the more straightforward characters at the point I'm at, so that should give you a hint at how you will learn more about the other characters as you go.  To say more would go too much into spoilers."
pureasoiaf,393vpq,basefibber,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:36:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer.  My problem is not the lack of “subversiveness and grimdark,” though, but rather the lack of characters I care about. If anything, I feel like The Blade Itself tries to be subversive and morally gray too hard and too fast. Compare to Martin: the first few chapters of AGoT introduce an ancient evil, a sympathetic protagonist, and a clear villain. Later Martin subverts everything, and the protagonist turns out to be a red herring, the villain a semi-sympathetic antihero, and the evil only one of many plotlines rather than the focus of the story - but since the very beginning, the reader is hooked and invested.  Here, by contrast, I’ve read half the book and still have no idea who am I supposed to care about. Glokta, apparently."

Personally, I cared about and felt invested in all the POV's, especially Glokta and Logan.  I even liked Jezal in the same way that I loved Cersei's POV's in AFFC (I could still sympathize with them from their own perspective).  I liked West and Dogman as well, but hadn't seen too much of them.   I felt that Abercrombie presents us with interesting but seemingly one-dimensional characters and then slowly gives us hints that help us get to know them better and also tells us that they aren't one dimensional at all.  It's not pretty, but I found them interesting."

He wanted the first book to be its own complete story if he wasn't able to publish any more and the similarities with LotR were intended to make the world more familiar and readers more comfortable with it. The characters especially seem clones or mish-mashes of some from LotR, but by the time I was into the fourth book (which I'm almost done with) I felt like they'd come into their own so well that thinking back to the first book almost felt like a totally different cast (and series)."

I really enjoy reading the Forgotten Realms books though I will admit they are guilty pleasures. They vary a lot in quality as there as so many authors. It is interesting as it is such a huge shared world and all the writers get to flesh it out. It is definitely worth trying Lord of the Rings in case you haven't heard that before. It is epic and inspired so much. Though because of that it can feel generic but it is the inspiration for all the copies.

Nowhere near as epic or sweeping as ASoIaF, but it's an interesting change of pace from a lot of other fantasy.  I would also recommend Robin Hobb's Farseer trilogy. Hard to put down, and they share with ASoIaF a fixation with bastards, wargs, and wolves."

I'd definitely recommend The Dresden Files and Iron Druid Chronicles.  For historical fiction I'd recommend The Saxon Stories.

You can see where GRRM got some of his inspiration from for the Golden company and other sell swords. There is war going on and the black company is recruited that is all.

The Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini is worth a read too IMHO.  I wouldn't put them in the same league as asoiaf though. J.R.R Tolkien, C.S.

The northerners still held the watch in high regard and Benjen might have thought he would be more useful there, rather than having little to do at winterfell.  No idea about Mormont though!"
pureasoiaf,391eyi,Zynsius,21,Mon Jun 8 16:14:03 2015 UTC,I will have to do some research to back this up but:   I seem to remember reading that Joer Mormont took the black so that Jorah could become the Lord of Bear Island.  Edit: http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jeor_Mormont I don't remember and cannot find a reason for the abdication other that to give Jorah the lordship.
pureasoiaf,391eyi,PRobinson87,6,Mon Jun 8 16:18:57 2015 UTC,I don't think they ever outright stated a reason.
pureasoiaf,391eyi,DaarioBenjenGreyjoy,5,Mon Jun 8 16:43:55 2015 UTC,"Probably because Jorah had a new wife with a fine taste. He probably saw Jorahs situation, hand tried to help him."
pureasoiaf,391eyi,FuriousFap42,13,Mon Jun 8 17:55:13 2015 UTC,"Jeor had already taken the black before Jorah wed his second wife.  A Clash of Kings - Daenerys I   Ser Jorah nodded. ""By then my father had taken the black, so I was Lord of Bear Island in my own right. I had no lack of marriage offers, but before I could reach a decision Lord Balon Greyjoy rose in rebellion against the Usurper, and Ned Stark called his banners to help his friend Robert. The final battle was on Pyke. When Robert's stonethrowers opened a breach in King Balon's wall, a priest from Myr was the first man through, but I was not far behind. For that I won my knighthood.  ""To celebrate his victory, Robert ordained that a tourney should be held outside Lannisport. It was there I saw Lynesse, a maid half my age. She had come up from Oldtown with her father to see her brothers joust. I could not take my eyes off her. In a fit of madness, I begged her favor to wear in the tourney, never dreaming she would grant my request, yet she did."""
pureasoiaf,391eyi,GreendaleCC,3,Mon Jun 8 19:23:57 2015 UTC,"That's what I had always assumed but the Wiki of Ice and Fire said Joer abdicated prior to Robert's Greyjoy Rebellion.  It was in the Rebellion that Jorah's bravery in battle earned him a knighting.  Then he would have competed in tourneys and met Lynesse Hightower.  Maybe as Jorah was the only child and at the age of manhood, Joer felt he could step down and not have to worry about marrying again and producing more possible heirs."
pureasoiaf,391eyi,PRobinson87,6,Mon Jun 8 18:21:16 2015 UTC,"Ohh, so maybe since Bear Island is not a rich place, he just wanted to make room, give his son a good title and income, so he may find a wife?"

pureasoiaf,391eyi,moondoggle,4,Mon Jun 8 17:29:53 2015 UTC,"Hmm not sure about that reasoning with Benjen. I think, if it was simply because he was not Ned's heir, then he would have waited longer to join the NW. At the time of joining, Robb is only a small baby, and small babies die all the time.  I seem to remember GRRM saying we will find out more about Benjen's motivations for joining the NW when he did later in the series. A lot of people speculate that it is somehow related to guilt over the R+L=J situation. If he was somehow involved in R and L running off together, he may feel guilty for the death of his sister, brother, father, and many who died in the rebellion.  As for Jeor, I believe he joined because he was concerned with the increased amount of wildlings crossing the wall into the North. He has first experience with this, what with Tormund sticking his giant member into Maege Mormont."
pureasoiaf,391eyi,tomkins,3,Mon Jun 8 21:49:37 2015 UTC,"f it was simply because he was not Ned's heir, then he would have waited longer to join the NW   Why?  That was his best ( most honorable ) option in life, just like it was Jon's.  Why would he wait to get his life started?"

pureasoiaf,391eyi,my-little-wonton,4,Sat Jun 13 00:32:27 2015 UTC,"For benjen, In the prologue it mentions Ser Waymar Royce, who being the youngest son of the current lord, had little chance to inherit, and it was probably honorable to join the NW. Jeor takes the black to allow his son to become the new lord of bear island."
pureasoiaf,391eyi,maggioso,2,Mon Jun 8 20:21:44 2015 UTC,For the Old Bear my guess is Jorah was a man with a wife and Jeor was getting on in years and wanted to give his son a solid chance at being a good lord. In the North joining the watch is still seen as honorable.

pureasoiaf,38zjgt,Popcorntub,7,Mon Jun 8 13:43:26 2015 UTC,I'd rate it the same or worse than Jon's injury in terms of severity. She full on grabbed a Valryian steel dagger and held it off.  I'm surprised that she still has fingers to be honest.
pureasoiaf,38zjgt,mknbrd,3,Mon Jun 8 21:48:58 2015 UTC,"Which is fair, but I didn’t mention Jon’s burned hand either. If I included hand injuries, I’d limit them to Jaime, Davos, and Qhorin Halfhand.  Interestingly, Cat’s injuries might actually be more severe than they should’ve been realistically. Disarming your opponent by grabbing his blade is a legit historical technique, and apparently it wasn’t as dangerous as commonly portrayed. (Here some talk about it in the end, at 7 minutes.) The trick is to hold the blade tight, so that it doesn’t move (which also comes up in halfswording). Admittedly, Cat was a woman and unlikely knew anything of that sort."
pureasoiaf,38zjgt,Kels9894,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:51:02 2015 UTC,"It may not be as dangerous as is seems, but the dagger was valeryian steel, so it's sharper. Plus I don't think she was thinking about techinques about how to not injure herself."

pureasoiaf,38tmew,mywhereabouts,8,Sat Jun 6 19:07:10 2015 UTC,Yes I heard it was in Bittersteel's possession but what then?  If it turns out that Magister Iyrillo somehow came into possession of it and passed it onto Young Griff then I shall give a out a squeal of delight.
pureasoiaf,38tmew,LadyAsharaDayne,3,Sat Jun 6 19:28:37 2015 UTC,"that was my impression as well, after my first re-read.  It would seem fitting to tie up that loose end since that loose end is like the uber valyrian sword that stands out from other swords. with the exception of Dawn of house dayne of course."
pureasoiaf,38tmew,idefiler6,4,Thu Jun 11 15:19:20 2015 UTC,"There's nowhere that it's written that Bittersteel had possession of the sword after the first rebellion. None of the other 4 Blackfyre pretenders he sent had possession of it, either."
pureasoiaf,38tmew,Battleloser,4,Sat Jun 6 19:39:40 2015 UTC,Isn't it in the second novella? Something about whether that Blackfyre kid is worthy of his fathers sword?

pureasoiaf,38tmew,idefiler6,4,Thu Jun 11 15:20:52 2015 UTC,"Daemon 2 definitely did not have it, but there was no proof that Bittersteel indeed possessed it. Only speculation. The next 3 pretenders also showed up without the sword. If he had it indeed, why would he not grant it to a single one of the Blackfyre heirs?  Edit: Just for clarification, you speak of the third Dunk and Egg, The Mystery Knight. :)"
pureasoiaf,38tmew,brankinginthenorth,4,Sun Jun 7 02:14:31 2015 UTC,"Because he didn't consider them heirs. He thought the sword should go to Daemon's true heir and eldest living child, Calla Blackfyre and her children who, purely coincidentally, Bittersteel is the father of.  While the other Blackfyre pretenders wanted the throne for themselves, that doesn't mean Bittersteel was aligned with them.  He may have been trying to gain the throne his own way, like marrying Kiera of Tyrosh to the crown prince twice or putting her daughter Vaella forth at the Great Council of 233.  This means that any Blackfyre living today also has Bracken blood through Bittersteel's mother which is contrasted with all the Targaryens living today having Blackwood blood,  the Brackens' sworn enemies."
pureasoiaf,38tmew,LadyAsharaDayne,2,Sun Jun 7 20:55:03 2015 UTC,was there a specific text or thread that dives into that further?   my tinfoil radar is starting to activate.

Plus I come at it from a literary or figurative perspective and most everyone else looks at it from a historical or what-would-happen-if-this-was-real-life perspective.  Basically I think the conflicts of Maegor, Aegon II, Daemon Blackfyre, and Rhaegar Targaryen are connected to each other very closely in terms of themes (polygamy, bastardry, and female inheritance) AND bloodlines and it relates to today's stories as well either through Dany or Jon.  But I don't have all the theory figured out yet."

As per ASOIAF wiki  last mention states -  Others were executed for their parts as well. Daemon was kept as a prisoner to prevent Bittersteel (who had refused to give Daemon the sword Blackfyre) from naming a younger brother of Daemon as a Blackfyre King  -     I guess last mention is during the 2nd Blackfyre rebellion.  So Bittersteel still had it until Daemon Blackfyres descendents became of age.     Its okay to be ticky-tack but this isnt a police investigation, its from unreliable sources, legends, stories sent down generation to generation.  Sometimes you just gotta to just buy into the storytelling to get the pay off.     Even the maesters cant be trusted on their writings of history since they have secret ambitions."

Illyrio offered Aegon a sword when he brought Tyrion and this would be Blackfyre if he was planning on having Aegon be the king - a king deserves a Valyrian blade."

pureasoiaf,38tmew,BalerionTheValyrian,3,Wed Jun 10 01:35:59 2015 UTC,Did Bittersteel have children?
pureasoiaf,38tmew,LadyAsharaDayne,4,Wed Jun 10 14:15:54 2015 UTC,"I'm sure he could have had many children. With many families or many women.       But none would be as worthy the wield the sword, as Daemons descendants.    B-steel or his descendents would only be like a castellan of the sword until another Targaryen earned the right to wield it. Just like Daemon.  Oh man...any history of the Blackfyre Pretenders after Daemon died should be taken with a grain of salt.     After his exile to Essos and setting up Golden Company there is no telling where or who has the sword.   And I think it wouldve been wise to hide it as well.   It would be certainly unreliable to see what happened to Bittersteel through texts and word of mouth. As many of the maesters (Gyldayn u crook!) try to chronicle the history of the known world, their writings are so unreliable and biased.   As it is real history.  I would think it would be 3x as hard in Essos to get any history on things since they do not use educated maesters regularly as in westeros."
pureasoiaf,38tmew,LadyAsharaDayne,2,Wed Jun 10 15:14:12 2015 UTC,I gotta say I did love seeing the different perspectives in The World of Ice and Fire like how favorable it all was to Tywin Lannister for instance.

pureasoiaf,38tmew,mknbrd,8,Thu Jun 11 15:42:18 2015 UTC,Jon Snow has it. Big theory on /r/asoiaf on Blackfyre's disappearance and potential reappearance with a new pommel after it was damaged in a fire.
pureasoiaf,38tmew,idefiler6,8,Sat Jun 6 19:38:47 2015 UTC,"This theory seems to rely heavily on the idea that Blackfyre is a bastard sword. Where does it come from? I can’t easily find a description of Blackfyre. The poster in /r/asoiaf cites ASOIAF wiki, the wiki in turn cites this page, and the page makes no such claim.  (By the way, I only now realized that Martin uses wrong terminology and what he calls a longsword is not actually a longsword.)  Edit: Apparently I can’t read. Here’s what he actually cites:   Blackfyre should be somewhat larger and darker than the other two, and its design needs to suggest flames.   That’s still not enough to call it a bastard sword, though."
pureasoiaf,38tmew,njm1314,3,Sat Jun 6 22:55:22 2015 UTC,The only thing that points to it are the fact that BF is larger than Dark Sister and Rhaenys' blade. This is covered in WoIaF.

pureasoiaf,38tmew,moondoggle,15,Sun Jun 7 00:47:08 2015 UTC,I read a theory that longclaw was blackfyre but it didnt seem at all plausible to me in all honesty.
pureasoiaf,38tmew,njm1314,23,Sat Jun 6 19:46:59 2015 UTC,I'm not understanding how that theory is plausible to anyone. Isn't Longclaw the ancestral sword of the Mormonts. For the last five hundred years? Why would it be Blackfyre?
pureasoiaf,38tmew,moondoggle,17,Sat Jun 6 20:44:12 2015 UTC,"The gist of the theory is that Mormont was tasked with looking after it by Aemon (who came up there with Bloodraven, who brought it with him) and then just straight up lies to Jon.  It's pretty much relying on Jon never running into Jorah or Maege Mormont and being like ""oh thx for the family sword btw""."
pureasoiaf,38tmew,njm1314,9,Sat Jun 6 20:55:19 2015 UTC,"It also says there never really was a Longclaw. It's tinfoil, but it's not a bad theory"

pureasoiaf,38tmew,brankinginthenorth,8,Sat Jun 6 21:28:49 2015 UTC,Based on what exactly? Is there even a shred of evidence for said theory? Frankly it sounds like a bad theory to me. Wishful thinking not based on any text or even logic.  Besides wasn't Longclaw in the possession of Jorah for a while before he ran? Doesn't that sink the entire thing?
pureasoiaf,38tmew,njm1314,3,Sat Jun 6 22:44:50 2015 UTC,As far as I know (this is mostly based on the comments from that thread) the only basis we have to assume Jorah had the sword is Jeor telling Jon that.  That's what I mean about Jeor straight up lying to Jon.
pureasoiaf,38tmew,gmrf,5,Sat Jun 6 23:05:01 2015 UTC,And the entire rest of the Night's Watch lies as well? Because none of them seem all that surprised that Mormont had a Valyarian Sword on hand to give his protegee. That doesn't come up?   I just don't get this theory. It's based one hundred percent on smoke and mirrors. Not one shred of actual text based evidence. It is created because people want it to be true for emotional reasons. Because it feels right to think about in accord to other theories (which may not even be true themselves).
pureasoiaf,38tmew,coztimo,6,Sat Jun 6 23:45:02 2015 UTC,"Not just a lack of text based evidence. The author of the theory said to ignore the evidence in world of ice and fire, because it cannot be trusted as I was written 'in character' by a maester.   Still- I kinda liked it as a theory. It's enjoyable."

pureasoiaf,38tmew,idefiler6,3,Sat Jun 6 19:54:22 2015 UTC,"/u/idefiler6 is correct, Blackfyre and Dark Sister are different style swords. Dark Sister is a longsword, able to be wielded one-handed. Blackfyre is a ""bastard"" sword, larger and able to be wielded one- or two-handed. The only other bastard Valyrian steel sword we've seen in the series is Longclaw. The original theory grew out of that fact."
pureasoiaf,38ub8d,mywhereabouts,17,Sat Jun 6 22:00:08 2015 UTC,"Well I personally believe that the three heads don't necessarily have to have tard blood, only one of them would have to to fulfill the prophecy. The other two could be advisors, friends, companions. That said, I believe that two have. Jon and Dany. These two have a lot in common as well. They both killed their mothers on their way out, both grew up without their real parents, were both outcasts, both had a complicated relationship with their ''adoptive parants'' (Jon with Cat, Dany with Viserys), and had both a near death experience involving a element, Dany with fire when she stepped into Drogos funeral pire, Jon when he got stabbed and (now starts the conjure) put on ice and later somehow revived. Both lost thier first love, and both were indirectly responsible for the death of their love. They also both have strange dreams. So these two have a lot in common.  But there is a third person who fits a lot of this. Tyrion. Killed his mother on his way out, bad relationship with his (maybe not real) dad, has a near death experience with water ( the element between ice and fire ), misfit, has strange dreams, and is indirectly responsible for something terrible that happend tk his first love (and killed his second). Also he dreams a lot about Dragons.   Reading all of this, you ask: so do you think Tyrion is a secret Targ? No! Tyrion will be one of the three heads of the Dragon without stupid bloodlines. GRRM will break with this nonsense, and make one of the prophesied saviors not the son of a really important line. Aegon is a red hering. The one fantasy trope that GRRM has spared so far, is that the hero is a long lost king/ son of two important people/ born to prophecy/... . Instead we will have a ice hero, a fire hero, and the dwarf to save us all. The one to broker a alliance between the two.   I believe the dragon having three heads was Rhaegars interpretation of how the world will be saved. He just thought it had to be targs. Most prophecy in asoiaf will turn out to be a lot different then we thought. Rhaegar probably had prophetic dreams, and interpreted them wrong like every other Targ before him (except for Danaerys the dreamer I guess). He saw how the world was getting saved, and thought it had to be three Targs, like Aegon the conqueror. I don't think it has to do with how many Targs there should be in the story overall. That saying is not limited to Targs, it applies to all rulers. To many heirs, often means conflict. See Starks and Graystarks.   But little side note. Weather Aegon is a Blackfyre or not, a dragon red or black is still a dragon. I still don't think he will be a head of the Dragon. He is what GRRM builds up to knock down."
pureasoiaf,38ub8d,FuriousFap42,7,Sat Jun 6 23:38:23 2015 UTC,"I'm a not a 100% on Jon being a secret Targaryen, but I completely agree with that theory. I also believe that's how Westeros will get to keep some of its great houses in place when the song is over.   Daenerys wants to burn down every single one that fought against her family and that would mean no more Lannisters, Starks, Baratheons, Tullys and Arryns. That's 5 royal families, for 7 kingdoms and a set of islands, wiped out. I seriously doubt it would happen and I seriously doubt she could win if she even tried it. Tyrion is the one that fixes that, he is the one that convinces Daenerys to dial it down a notch on the revenge tour. A little side help from Ser Barristan, the bold, sure, but mostly Tyrion.   Jon fits the puzzle by highlighting the importance of the Wall, the need to keep it and man it. He is the one that keeps Danny and Tyrion focused on the real problem, on the big threat."
pureasoiaf,38ub8d,gmrf,4,Sun Jun 7 06:51:37 2015 UTC,"Well, IMO it will not matter if he is on. I think GRRM is screwing with us on the importance of bloodlines. In the end, someone will be a savior on his merits, and then they change the story or prophecy, to fit him. I think he is one, but that it will not be important.   I actually think the great houses are going down. One by one. I think the endgame will be, that something permanently changes. The weal of time will break. Fantasy always has this thing, that history is cyclical. That was actually the view of history in the middle ages. Everything repeating it's self, until Jesus comes. But we know, that's not ture. Science came, and things changed. Technologie made ideas lime democracy possible, firearms made knights useless, and brought the use of aristocracy into question, and on and on until now. Now is different. Westeros will be different, in a way that matters by the end. I don't know if feudalism will be totally gone, or just weakened, with a stronger influence of merchants. Or if we will have a basic form of a Parlament. What ever it will be, things will have changed. And the great houses, will suffer a lot under that change.   Also, the Wall is coming down. Hard! The battle against the Others will not be won there, things will goes further south."
pureasoiaf,38ub8d,FuriousFap42,4,Sun Jun 7 09:54:55 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the changes part, I think in the end none of it will matter, things will just go back to the way they wore before. The status quo will be the same as it was before Robert's Rebellion.   But I do agree with you on the wall falling. Not sure if it will be literal, cause that's a lot of ice, but it will certainly fall. What I meant before was that Jon will turn their attention on the war with the Others, that he will be the reason Daenerys and the prophecies are fulfilled saving Westeros, not simply conquering it."

This makes me totally on board with the theory that Dany, Jon, and Tyrion are all Lightbringer with their mothers being the Nissa Nissas. Even if it does mean that Tywin was Azor Ahai, I'm cool with that."
pureasoiaf,38ub8d,superlibby,2,Wed Jun 10 07:17:04 2015 UTC,"I did not catch the third child thing. Hmm, also all of them had already a big sister and brother. Exept for Dany. Unless.... Transgendered Rhaegar confirmed! He was so melancholy because he wanted to be a woman! He was also the older brother sibling, and both Cersey and Rhanaerys are the older sibling. Bam! I am gonna write a theory about that. One that is not totally serious"
pureasoiaf,38ub8d,FuriousFap42,2,Wed Jun 10 11:14:21 2015 UTC,Tyrion riding a dragon is too Disneyish. Let him not be one of the three heads! He was meant to make rulers and not rule IMO.
pureasoiaf,38ub8d,AySid,2,Mon Jun 8 05:36:10 2015 UTC,"Probably, but he does not have to ride one to be one of the three heads. If one of the drazons dies, there does not have to be a third rider."
pureasoiaf,38ub8d,FuriousFap42,2,Mon Jun 8 09:04:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't think the heads of the dragon necessarily need to be Targaryen but I think it would help to have some Valyrian blood. I honestly can't see Tyrion taming a dragon though, he'd probably end up like Quentyn.  I'm also not sure if the heads and the dragonriders need to be the same persons. That might depend on whether AA=Tptwp  Great comparison between Jon/Dany/Tyrion btw!"
pureasoiaf,38ub8d,runmelos,2,Wed Jun 10 12:34:43 2015 UTC,"That might depend on whether AA=Tptwp   I am very sure of that, because of the way Aemon describes the prophecy.    ""Maester Aemon believed that Daenerys Targaryen was the fulfillment of a prophecy . . . her, not Stannis, nor Prince Rhaegar, nor the princeling whose head was dashed against the wall."" ""Born amidst salt and smoke, beneath a bleeding star. I know the prophecy."" Marwyn turned his head and spat a gob of red phlegm onto the floor. ""Not that I would trust it.  ""It was a prince that was promised, not a princess. Rhaegar, I thought . . . the smoke was from the fire that devoured Summerhall on the day of his birth, the salt from the tears shed for those who died. He shared my belief when he was young, but later he became persuaded that it was his own son who fulfilled the prophecy, for a comet had been seen above King's Landing on the night Aegon was conceived, and Rhaegar was certain the bleeding star had to be a comet. What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise! The error crept in from the translation. Dragons are neither male nor female, Barth saw the truth of that, but now one and now the other, as changeable as flame. The language misled us all for a thousand years. Daenerys is the one, born amidst salt and smoke. The dragons prove it.""    All the salt and smoke and bleeding star stuff sounds exactly like the AA prophecy.    Yeah I don't think the heads of the dragon necessarily need to be Targaryen    GRRM said that the third head would not have to be.   help to have some Valyrian blood.   Depends on if Nettles was a Dragonseed. GRRM has been very quite on this question. Also I believe that one of the Dragons will die very soon, without a rider."
pureasoiaf,38ub8d,FuriousFap42,3,Wed Jun 10 13:39:04 2015 UTC,"Well they share the ""born amidst smoke & salt"" and the red comet as a harbinger, but there's also some differences. Did you notice that all the Targs only talk about the PtwP but never mention AA? And vice versa for all the red priests like Benerro, they never talk about the PtwP, Melisandre is the only person that uses the two interchangeably.  Other small differences:   AA prophesy is much older, it's about rebirth of Ashaii guy; PtwP is only ~1000 years old and apparently strems from Valyria AA has flaming sword Lightbringer, PtwP has Dragons AA can be anybody, Ptwp has to be of the blood of the Dragon. Lightbringer is shining and hot, Dragon has three heads   I do think that it's partly the same prophesy but I think that they talk about seperate people. Pretty much any region in Planetos has it's own legend of a Last Hero that averted the long night. I think that there were actually a few and that they worked together against the Others, maybe even founded the Night's Watch afterwards, as defenders of the Dawn.   Anyway I think the PtwP is Dany with Dragons and Azor Ahai is Jon with Lightbringer.   ""Three heads of the dragon... yes... but the third will not nessesarily BE a Targaryen...   That's true but I'm not 100% sure how I should interpret that. So I guess 2 are, but does he mean they don't need Valyrian blood at all? Like e.g. Arya? or does he mean they don't need to be Targs but need to be from other Valyrian Houses like Velaryon or Celtigars? or does he mean they do need Dragonblood but won't be Targs per se like e.g. Stannis. He always tends to be a bit vage, that's good I guess, more tinfoil :)  Anyway, in practice any character could possibly become a dragonrider because there's still the dragonhorn. It's just feels a bit weird because the three headed dragon seems like such a Targ thing, I mean it's their banner. It's a tiny bit like if Dany would warg into a direwolf.   Also I believe that one of the Dragons will die very soon, without a rider.    That could very well happen! But I think that at least one other dragon will be resurrected before the end of the series and probably not by dany."

And vice versa for all the red priests like Benerro, they never talk about the PtwP   Because they are from different cultures, different languages, both describing the same thing. Why would they use different words for it?    PtwP is only ~1000 years old   From where do you know that? They could both be much older, what comes out when events are passed on over thousand of years.    AA has flaming sword Lightbringer, PtwP has Dragons   Lightbringer could be a metaphor for Dragons. A sword would not help you much against a army of Wights, and Others, but Dragons would. I would be surprised, if a dude with a flaming sword would save the day Aragon style.    Ptwp has to be of the blood of the Dragon.   Thats not in the original prophecy, the gost of Highhart, before she became the gost of Highhart, made that additional prophecy.    Lightbringer is shining and hot,    Aemond asks about Stannises sword, if it was hot, so the hot sword is part of the PtwP prophecy as well.    Dragon has three heads   Yes, that one is not in the AA one, but maybe also not in the PtwP one. It could have been a different one. I say that, because of Aegon the conquerer. I think that prophecy is based on him. But maybe that is something that divides the two.    Anyway, in practice any character could possibly become a dragonrider because there's still the dragonhorn.   I think the Dragonhorn will not bind Dragons. I think it binds People to the Dragons(Valyrians, or who ever owns the horn). I think it is a slaver horn. But thats a different theory, one for a own post.    It's just feels a bit weird because the three headed dragon seems like such a Targ thing, I mean it's their banner.    Yeah, I think they took something that was there before, and applied that to them selfs, because of Aegon and his two sisters. I think Aegon was motivated by prophecy as well."

pureasoiaf,38ub8d,FuriousFap42,2,Sun Jun 7 00:04:52 2015 UTC,"Stannis is important in his own way, but there are a couple of things that make me sure he is not a head of the dragon. First, he is not a POV. He is a player in the GoT, not a child rising to become a savior. Also, he adds nothing to the dragon equation, at least not as a head. He is very self absorbed, very focused on his right to be king, not really a diplomat. He can not bring people together. He could teach a lot about military strategy, but thats not what will be needed for Dany and Jon. I either see him a the Nights King, or sitting the Iron Throne after shit went down. Or maybe just dead. But IMO he does not fit with Dany and Jon, weather they end up on opposite sides, or together."

pureasoiaf,38ub8d,imotu,3,Sun Jun 7 12:40:17 2015 UTC,I believe the three heads of the Dragon is based on Rhaegar being 'The Dragon'.  Rhaegar is the key. The Three Heads of The Dragon are the living children of Rhaegar Targaryen. Aegon (not young griff) and Lyanna's twins.
pureasoiaf,38ub8d,brankinginthenorth,2,Sun Jun 7 14:10:17 2015 UTC,Wait so you think Lyanna has twins and that Aegon is alive but he isn't Young Griff?

pureasoiaf,38ub8d,gmrf,2,Sun Jun 7 20:52:40 2015 UTC,"And who is Aegon?  Better yet, who are Lyanna's twins?"
pureasoiaf,38ub8d,imotu,4,Sun Jun 7 22:20:57 2015 UTC,I believe Varys and Illyrio's Aegon is a Blackfyre. I believe the true Aegon is being hidden at Greywater Watch by Ashara Dayne and Howland Reed. Included is Jon's fraternal twin who unlike Jon has Targaryen physical characteristics. So he or she must be hidden or Robert's threat to kill all Targaryen's including children will be carried out. Ashara and Eddard at Starfall made a pact to protect Elia's child and Lyanna's twins. Ashara faked her suicide and because she has some similar physical characteristics to Aegon and Jon's twin was able to pass as their mother or relative. She may also have been lactating after a miscarriage and may be able to feed Aegon after fleeing with him from King's Landing.
pureasoiaf,38ub8d,JewBot6000,2,Sun Jun 7 22:42:04 2015 UTC,"WOW. That is some fun tinfoil.  Is this something you cooked up yourself, or was it posted in full form somewhere else?"

pureasoiaf,38ub8d,imotu,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:49:39 2015 UTC,But then how would Ashara Dayne and Howland Reed come across Aegon to begin with.
pureasoiaf,38ub8d,10eel,2,Tue Jun 9 23:26:43 2015 UTC,"Ashara was one of Elia's lady's in waiting. She was with her with at Harrenhal before Aegon's birth. She was with her at king's landing after Aegon's birth. Then she disappeared. Why? The Dayne's are not cowards. Ashara was Dornish. Elia was a princess of Dorne. Ashara knew the child Aegon. That is as close to a fact as there can be without the privilege of exactitude. Why would a high born lady of Dorne from the prestigious House Dayne unexpectedly leave her Dornish Princess in the midst of danger? She was the sister of of the Sword of The Morning. She left because Elia asked her to. She left with Aegon. What happened at the Tower of Joy? Why did Eddard suddenly leave and go to Starfall? To return Dawn? Yes, but also to find the children of Lyanna. I believe Ashara had Aegon and the twins. If Eddard had Lyanna's child or as I believe children he and Howland  would not have made the detour to Starfall. Then we must ascertain the 'special relationship' existing between Howland and Lyanna that stretches all the way back to the Harrenhal tournament. The debt Lord Reed probably believes he owes the Knight of The Laughing Tree for standing in his stead. Now he must stand for her. This meeting between Howland, Ashara and Eddard was made after the ToJ incident. At Starfall decisions were made."

pureasoiaf,38ofej,moondoggle,42,Fri Jun 5 16:03:12 2015 UTC,My impression from the story about Sandor's face is that their dad was kind of weak and Gregor was just huge and violent and did whatever he wanted.

Sandor mentions killing his first man when he was 12 and I can't imagine he did it of his own volition; the fight, or murder, would've been arranged by his father.

pureasoiaf,38ofej,TrollBorn,21,Mon Jun 8 00:25:30 2015 UTC,"Sandor is easily one of my favorite characters in the series. I think watching Sansa and Arya being treated like shit gave him that final push to abandon his life among some of the worst people on the planet. He saw himself in the people that abused those poor girls, and thought ""fuck, I'm a dick"" and left.  But, that doesn't make him a good guy. I'm sure he did his fair share of pillaging and stealing, before he finally met up with Arya. Though, something tells me he didn't do a whole lot of killing, unless it was for self-preservation. You're not going to shed decades of being a horrible person in just a few short months, but I think living on the Quiet Isle is evidence of him finally realizing that he can be a decent human being.  Also, call me a hype-slayer, but I truly hope that he does end up staying on the Quiet Isle until the end of his days. There's no need for him to come back and have some final battle with his currently undead older brother, it just doesn't make sense. His arc is no longer about revenge."

He wouldn't have just gotten a slap on the wrist - Joffrey would have told the same bullshit story and said that Micah attacked him. Maybe he wouldn't have been executed (maybe?) but I can't imagine cersei would have let him go without some terrible punishment.    It doesn't excuse what the Hound did, but it makes it a little more gray. Plus, that was when he was as much 'the Hound' as he ever was. Before he spent time with the Stark girls.    I think he was cynical about the entire system from a young age, but Sansa and Arya gave him.. Hope? Some sort of realization that he didn't have to live like he had been? Maybe it made it seem horrible enough that it gave him just enough motivation to quit it all instead of bitterly playing his part for the rest of his life."

Maybe since the story would be that Micah attacked Joffrey with a weapon, he would have lost a hand. We just can't be sure. Anyways, Sandor is an asshole for killing Micah, I completely agree - and what he did was inexcusable. But, for what it's worth, we didn't see what happened. Maybe there were other circumstances at play, we just can't know for sure. It's easy to say that Micah was just a kid, but maybe Joffrey actually commanded the Hound to kill him? I'd have to go check out that part of the book, but since we only hear what goes on from Sansa's(?) PoV, we don't have all the details.  I agree about the idea of Arya and Sansa inspiring hope for Sandor. Maybe hope is the wrong word, but something along those lines. In any case, he was tired of being what he was. He dipped from defending Joffrey, offered to bring Sansa back to Winterfell, attempted to bring Arya back to her mother (albeit, for money) and saved her life on more than one occasion.  Sure, he did some terrible things a long the way. No one disagrees, but he also did a lot of great things. He, just like every other character in ASoIAF, falls into that 'morally gray' category."

Even if Robert Strong is the Mountain, and I truly believe he is, how would the Hound ever find out about it? Nobody knows where he is.   And even if someone sent him a letter saying his brother is alive and fighting for Cersei, convinced him to become the Hound again, and he went running back to Kings Landing to fight his brother, for some reason, it would not avenge what the Mountain did to him. His brother died, that thing is not him anymore."

pureasoiaf,38ixb6,misterandon,11,Thu Jun 4 19:13:37 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you about leaving Sandor at rest, it is a very strong ending to his character arc. We see his pain and learn about his past, it's nice to know that some people can find peace in asoiaf.   On another note, i find it very strange that people believe that gravedigger/Sandor is going to be chosen as the faith's champion. Nobody in Kingslanding even knows the gravedigger exists, much less suspects that he is Sandor Clegane. On top of that, even if they did, he would have to travel all the way to Kingslanding. Finally, we know that the gravedigger is maimed and limping, if he is indeed the hound, it doesn't seem likely he's in any condition to fight Robert Strong."

The thing is, I have no reason to believe the High Sparrow or anyone else in Kings Landing knows where the Hound is, so they wouldn't be able to send for him either.   I don't know, I don't buy it. Maybe I'm like you and just really want him to be left alone. He found his peace, he has kind of a happy ending. Let him be."

Clegane went there to kill, bury and forget the Hound, that's what the Septon is helping him with. Why would he be sending letters to King's Landing about the Hound? Do we believe that this is all a plot to keep a great warrior as an ace in the Faith's sleeve?   I'm not gonna lie, I don't think the Faith wouldn't, what I don't believe is they have a reason to plan to use him like that. Or that he would even accept to do it. The Faith don't know Robert Strong is the Mountain, the Hound believe he is dead and have little reason to doubt that. There are just too many things that make me question the possibility of cleganebowl actually happening.   Like I said, maybe I just really don't want it to happen."
pureasoiaf,38ixb6,gmrf,19,Sat Jun 6 21:06:27 2015 UTC,"As much as I think it would be cool, I don't see it happening. Sandor has always had an issue with taking vows. He never officially became a knight because his brother ruined the idea of a true knight for him. Likewise, he never swore Kingsguard vows because he spit on the idea of knighthood.  In order for Cleganebowl (and I'm making the assumption people want it to go down during Cersei's trial) to actually occur, Sandor would have to fight on behalf of the faith. Given his past reluctance to take vows, and his past history of not holding any faith/religion, what would make HIM be the Faith's champion? Surely they want someone that holds to their way of thinking, right?   I'm acknowledging that his time on the QI has probably gentler his soul or whatever, but could it be simply that he enjoys a quiet life?   I would like to see him bring down the monster one day, but I don't see it going down at the trial. I'd like him to leave the QI because he wants to, not because he is ordered by the Faith. Seeing him silently strap on his armor and his sword one more time, calmly mount Stranger and ride off to go do what no others can.   In a side note, I can also see him meeting back up with Sansa at some point. She's been thinking of him and the unkiss too often for there to be no resolution. I'd like to see their final meeting in Winterfell, the place where they first met, with Sandor dropping to one knee and swearing to stay by her side as her sworn shield. The only vow he will ever take will be to the girl (or the girls if Arya is there too) who ended up saving him."

Let's say The Mountain is Cersei's champion, fights the faiths champion (not Sandor), wins but becomes basically an uncontrollable monster.  He kills his way out of the arena after the trial, and disappears across Westeros. Bigfoot-esque, he is only seen in stories but the aftermath he leaves behind is very real.  Sandor takes his sword back up, knowing what the monster is and that he has to stop him. Not at all pivotal to the plot aside from keeping the Mountain from mindlessly killing main characters, but an awesome story of redemption.  Sandor could get a scene after the fight with his unBrother, before delivering the final blow, where he stares at his beaten monster of a brother (Spoilers The Last Airbender TV) and what Gregor has become while reflecting on the type of man he himself has become. He takes a moment to observe and appreciate the situation, before swiftly putting a final, concrete end to his own demon and brother."

I think the idea that it makes for a better story is debatable. Sandor's acceptance of a quiet life is his ending. He never wanted to be a knight or a kingsguard or the brother of a maniac, but he was bound to those roles. He's finally been freed from that life so there's no reason for him to return to his former state.  I don't think it's likely that he'll ever know that Robert Strong was once his brother, so there would be no reason for him to tie up that loose end.

Sandor could easily receive this call, put two and two together about who the opponent really is, and boom, cleganebowl (get hype, ect.). I'll grant it does seem unlikely for all the pieces to align like that, but I love the idea of it. All the clues are there that both brothers are ""alive"" in their own ways.

An important part of Bran's dream was that it was someone with the Hound's helmet. Right now, the helmet is on Brienne/Jaime (the man in golden armor)'s possession... And Brienne has a reason to wear it (having just lost half her face to Biter).  Now... This could simply mean that the prophecy is about those two facing off against the mountain... But that is unexciting. I much prefer the theory that those two are fighting the mountain to defend Sansa, Brienne gets killed, and who shows up but the gravedigger, ready to kick some ass!  Basically the idea is that right now Sansa is getting ready to marry Harry the heir, which means there is some precedent that she will go to her father's seat (aka harrenhal). Harrenhal's surroundings include the woods where Lady stoneheart and her merry band are hanging out, and also the quiet isle where the ""Gravedigger"" is. Sansa also has with her the Mouse, who has been searching for her to sell her to Cersei. So Cersei finds out about the wedding, sends her favorite new toy (Gregor) to check it out, and Littlefinger/Sands get ambushed. Brienne and Jaime come to their rescue to fulfill their promise to Catelyn, but Brienne dies and Jaime can't fight for shit. Enter the gravedigger. Optimally he marches out to The Rock's WWE opening music, grabs the Hound helm and Thoros's flaming sword, and burns that undead son-of-a-bitch worse than he burned him."

Do we?<   I believe we do which is why the time line of Aegon's birth is important. I think that Rhaegar had the Targaryen facility for true dreaming. My reason for this is the vision of Rhaegar, Elia and the child in the The House of The Undying and the reminiscences of Jon Connington and Barriston Selmy. In THOTU we see a 'snapshot' of a conversation between Rhaegar and Elia. They are talking about Aegon not the child in the scene. That child is Rhaenys. Rhaegar is talking about the child to come. The Prince That Was Promised. He is sharing that vision with his wife who he was 'seen' will give birth to that child. Jon Connington's memoirs and the time line of Aegon's birth  convinces me that the child in the vision is Rhaenys not Aegon. Nevertheless Rhaegar is speaking of The Song of Ice and Fire and The Prince that Was Promised to Elia. She knows."

It's not as if they'd been married and barren for ten years, or that Elia had given him six consecutive daughters.  Won't even go into the wisdom of eloping with the daughter of one of the Paramount Lords, betrothed to another one of the Paramount Lords."
pureasoiaf,38c04u,Painweaver,12,Thu Jun 4 22:14:38 2015 UTC,Because Rhaegar was tasked by a paranoid Aerys to find the Mystery Knight. Rhaegar did exactly that but instead of turning Lyanna over to Aerys he discussed the situation with his wife. Rhaegar's nature doesn't fit his disrespecting Elia unless she was complicit in the action. The political implications of Lyanna being arrested would not be lost on Rhaegar and Elia. What better way to hide Lyanna from prying eyes than by having her become the Queen of Love and Beauty? Who would suspect the Queen of Love and Beauty to be an accomplished jouster? Also Rhaegar's choice of Lyanna turns the attention of the Harrenhal attendees from the Mystery Knight to Rhaegar's actions.   I believe Elia knew everything Rhaegar intended to do at Harrenhal.
pureasoiaf,38c04u,forkway,8,Wed Jun 3 09:51:19 2015 UTC,"Why not just say you didn't find the mystery knight? That would have no political consequences. That did have!   About Rhaegars character: We actually know very little about it. He was obviously willing to accept the consequences of kidnapping Lyanna, because prophecy was more important, so if her being QoLaB was important as well, disrespecting your wife seems lime a small price for that.   He crowning her had may have shifted attention from the KotlT, but at a big price. He just offered to Lords Paramount. Just saying, ''ohh I didn't find him, we found his armor and shield left behind, he must have fled'' would be much easier   Rhaegars main motivation for everything seems to be prophecy. Crowning Lyanna makes to only sense if that was also the case here."
pureasoiaf,38c04u,GreendaleCC,3,Wed Jun 3 15:59:42 2015 UTC,"Why not just say you didn't find the mystery knight? That would have no political consequences.   Because I believe Rhaegar wasn't the only one searching. Varys was probably with Aerys. Selecting Lyanna as QoLaB made Lyanna less obvious as a suspect. How could the tournament Queen also be a competent fighter? A brilliant misdirection on Rhaegar and Elia's part.   About Rhaegars character: We actually know very little about it.   We have firsthand reports about Rhaegar's character from Barristan Selmy, Jon Connington, Eddard Stark, Bran Stark, Robert Baratheon, Jorah Mormont, Aemon Targaryen etc. Some are flattering others denounce him. We each can choose whose portrayal we believe is the most accurate.   Rhaegars main motivation for everything seems to be prophecy. Crowning Lyanna makes to only sense if that was also the case here.    I don't believe prophecy had anything to do with Lyanna being crowned at Harrenhal. Aegon almost certainly wasn't born before the Harrenhal tournament. There was no reason for Rhaegar to create the third head  of the dragon with another woman since he believed Elia would give birth to all three. After Harrenhal, after Aegon's birth, the situation changed."
pureasoiaf,38c04u,TyroneusLannister,2,Wed Jun 3 16:37:44 2015 UTC,"Selecting Lyanna as QoLaB made Lyanna less obvious as a suspect. How could the tournament Queen also be a competent fighter?   How could a 13 year old girl be? Weather she became QoLaB of was just a 13 girl makes no/very little difference to her likelihood of being a competent fighter in the eyes of ... well anyone in Westeros. Even if Varis was with Aerys, and if he was somehow smart/stupid enough to see a 13 year old girl as a suspect, how could he think before: ""Well this Stark girl looks like she could take on three experienced knights in a tourney."" and then go: ""Well my prior suspicion can't be true, he crowned her QoLaB.""   If we didn't have the readers perspective, and would assume that Lyanna was the KotlT we would be insane.      We have firsthand reports about Rhaegar's character   no we have reports about how he behaved towards them and how they asses his character. That is something different. They are important, but it is not what we should use primarily. We can best determine what kind of guy he was by the actions he took that we know of with relative certainty.   We know that something made him determent to become a great knight at the age of 8. That change in hart was probably either caused by a prophecy that he thought he would fulfill, or a prophetic dream. We know he spent a lot of time with ancient scrolls about prophecy, and that for a time he said to Aemon that he himself was the tPtwP and later switched that to his son.   until now he is a very prophecy heavy dude.   Then he organizes the Harrenhall tourney by proxy, crowns Lyanna, and a year later kidnapps her, starting a massive war. We can argue until mountains crumble and the sun rises in the west and sets in the east if he knew what kind of consequences that would have, but I think we can agree that he knew that there would be heavy consequences.   So from that we can conclude that to fulfill prophecy he was willing to let a lot of bad things happen to other people.    I don't believe prophecy had anything to do with Lyanna being crowned at Harrenhal.   Well, like I argued above, just crowning her to get suspicion of her makes absolutely no sense to me. Queen of Love and Beauty or not, she was a 13 year old girl, no one would suspect her. So the only reason I could see for him to do this foolish thing would be something like a prophetic dream, or prophecy. Think about it. He was the one who (through Oswald Went) organized the hole tourney.  Weather Aegon was borne yet or not may not be important to whatever made him think Lyanna was important. I think I also made a good case, that he was in most of what he did(maybe not visiting the camber pot) motivated by ""supernatural"" things. There is no other set of reason I can see for his actions regarding the tourney, or Lyanna"

He could have followed up on leads, such as where the armor came from. However he found out, making her QoLaB does not make it any less likely that someone finds out the same way. Thats my main point. One you did not address.   If he assumed her to be a suspect from the beginning, then yes, he would be. I don't think that is a controversial point. Know any 13 year old girls that beat grown man in any athletics competition? But I don't think he had a list of suspects, beginning with Lyanna and ending with Tylor Swift.

She was also the wife of the heir to the throne and Rhaegar shared his dreams with Elia as well he should. He expected her to give birth to TPTWP. Rhaegar said as much to Elia in Dany's House of The Undying vision.   Characters that knew him well tell us his closest friend and confidant was actually Ser Arthur Dayne <     Ser Arthur was his closest friend not his wife.

Why would Doran send just 10000 men (GRRM also said: 'Dornishmen did not support him as strongly as they might have, in part because of anger at his treatment of Elia, in part because of Prince Doran's innate caution.' ), if his beloved sister was ok with everything Rhaegar did?"

Martells send just 10000 man and that was after Aerys took Elia hostage.   Yes it could be Elia's idea and there is no evidence that Rhaegar and Elia were not 'getting along'. Doran did send 10000 men which is a substantial force by Westeros standards. Why didn't Doran send more? You answered that yourself:   (GRRM also said: 'Dornishmen did not support him as strongly as they might have, in part because of anger at his treatment of Elia, in part because of Prince Doran's innate caution.' ),   I have no argument with that. Just because Elia isn't angry at Rhaegar doesn't necessarily imply that her countrymen aren't. You said:   When Rhaegar came back to KL, he could use Elia as a messenger to Doran, so that he would send more then 10000 men.   Rhaegar could not and would not do that. It took Aerys a while to find Rhaegar who was at the Tower of Joy. When Hightower found him Rhaegar immediately made haste for King's Landing. The rebels had already massed near the Green Fork when Rhaegar took command of the loyalists. There was no time to send for reinforcements when a decisive battle was about to be fought. Rhaegar was not about to send his wife on a dangerous mission to Dorne in the middle of a war. Kings Landing at the time was the safest place for his family.  You said:   if his beloved sister was ok with everything Rhaegar did?   I don't know if Elia was 'okay' with everything that Rhaegar did. I do maintain that Elia knew Rhaegar's plan to choose Lyanna as the Queen of Love and Beauty at Harrenhal and may herself have suggested that action. What occurs after Aegon's birth is problematic and controversial. I will wait for more insight and information on specific points.   Edited for formatting"
pureasoiaf,38c04u,mishagale,2,Wed Jun 3 20:36:33 2015 UTC,"She could just write a letter or something like that. And 10000 is not a substantial force. He had 30000 men, he could send more men. My point is that we know Elia was very close to her brothers and if everything would be more or less ok between them, they would send more men. Doran was angry because of Rhaegar treatment of Elia, he had to have some ground to be angry. It probably wasn't just his imagination. So something had to happen that made (Elia and ) Doran angry.  if Elia was behind the Queen of Love and Beauty scandal, then what would she thought about Lyanna ‘abduction’? She knew Rhaegar disappeared with Lyanna and she probably didn't know what was going on in TOJ, if she wanted Rhaegar to crown Lyanna because of some platonic reasons, then how could she know that there might be some love/rape between Rhaegar and Lyanna? She could just assume that there was something platonic going on-no reason to be angry. She and Doran had to have some ground for that anger. If she was offended at Harrenhal, then Lyanna's abduction would make her and Doran angry. But if she was behind Harrenhal, then she (and Doran) would be just confused."

My belief is based on the established relationship between Rhaegar and Elia (Dany's vision, Selmy and Connington's memoirs). There was no enmity, anger, abuse or disrespect indicated before Harrenhal. Rhaegar and Elia's actions seem unassailable. A successful arranged marriage with mutual respect and admiration. Something happened at Harrenhal that gave them pause. The political winds were becoming dangerous and The King was unstable. Rhaegar's entire history and character is inconsistent with his action. Unless Rhaegar and Elia, who are expecting TPTWP to be born, have to find a way to limit the political fallout created by arresting the daughter of the Warden of the North. The question then comes why did he kidnap her later? I don't know though possibly Aerys's searchers were closing in and Rhaegar moved Lyanna out of what he thought was harms way.  I am fairly certain that Elia knew Rhaegar's plan at Harrenhal and approved if not broached the idea herself."

pureasoiaf,387yyt,FuriousFap42,2,Tue Jun 2 23:17:09 2015 UTC,You did? Guess I'll have to go read that
pureasoiaf,387yyt,Mrbrian87,2,Tue Jun 2 23:30:22 2015 UTC,"Jane Westerling in prolog, no more epilogs until end"
pureasoiaf,387yyt,FuriousFap42,3,Tue Jun 2 23:32:12 2015 UTC,Sounds fine to me. I wouldn't want a WW POV anyway. It would take away from the mystique of them

pureasoiaf,387yyt,Manifest,2,Tue Jun 2 20:50:21 2015 UTC,Maybe prologue or epilogue though...
pureasoiaf,387yyt,FuriousFap42,11,Wed Jun 3 00:59:20 2015 UTC,Maybe in a prologue...
pureasoiaf,387yyt,gmrf,2,Tue Jun 2 16:17:25 2015 UTC,"Nope, that will feature Jane Westerling. Unless the Others made it that far south, no way."

pureasoiaf,387yyt,punchesbabies4lyf,7,Fri Jun 5 12:03:01 2015 UTC,"Are you asking if there will be an OTHER point of view, or an OTHER prisoner of war?  I doubt a POV of an other will happen, because as someone stated below, I think GRRM said there will be no new POV's.  Having an OTHER as a prisoner of war is more likely in my opinion. Maybe keep it in a cage of obsidian."
pureasoiaf,387yyt,lawandhodorsvu,2,Tue Jun 2 14:53:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i spelled wrong. I meant POV, person of view."
pureasoiaf,387yyt,FuriousFap42,2,Tue Jun 2 15:00:15 2015 UTC,"I figured that's what you meant. Like I mentioned above I believe he said no more POV's.  But even thought it isn't what you meant, how cool would it be to have an other as a prisoner??"
pureasoiaf,387yyt,TacoCommand,3,Tue Jun 2 15:04:36 2015 UTC,"If Stannis captured a other and sacrificed it to R´hllor, how much power do you think he would get?"
pureasoiaf,387yyt,FuriousFap42,7,Tue Jun 2 15:16:39 2015 UTC,"You phrased that like a SAT question.  If Bobby slept with 256 whores and one blonde and Stannis slept with one  moustached hag and one ginger, but neither slept with an ice zombie, then how many babies must burn to equal one throne."
pureasoiaf,387yyt,gmrf,3,Tue Jun 2 21:20:09 2015 UTC,"Depends, does any of the babies have kingsblood?"
pureasoiaf,387yyt,FuriousFap42,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:14:38 2015 UTC,Depends if you buy into kingsblood being a required catalyst: burning Rattleshirt would argue it doesn't matter.
pureasoiaf,387yyt,gmrf,3,Wed Jun 3 02:54:17 2015 UTC,"Sadly, no. Here is why: GRRM said, that there will be no new POVs. So the only option is a prolog or epilog chapter. But we know already that the prolog will feature Jane Westerling. So unless the WW made it to the Westerlands already, I think there won't be any there. But what about an epilog chapter, you ask? Martin said that epilog chapters only happen at ''act changes''. So at the end of aSoS ended act I and at the end of aDwD ended act II. And there are only 3 acts.   So no, there will be no WW POV chapter.   But!, the Wirewood network is the wildcard. Bran could see stuff, maybe get into some peoples head. Maybe even get the memories of someone who was sacrificed in front of a harttree. This could give us tons of information, but sadly no WW point of view"

I would recommend something like   A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords. The Hedge Knight, The Sworn Sword, The Mystery Knight. A Feast for Crows, A Dance with Dragons. The World of Ice and Fire. The Princess and the Queen, The Rogue Prince.   Alternatively, you can just follow the order of publication.  Alternatively, you can read the five main books and then decide about the rest."

pureasoiaf,3860df,Pliskin14,3,Tue Jun 2 12:12:46 2015 UTC,"I wouldn’t say in half. Almost everything about the Dance is told in P&Q, TRP just clarifies some background moments. It reads like a prequel to a prequel.  But you are probably right, it’s the part of which I was least sure."

I'd suggest reading the novels first, which allows you to avoid spoilers and gives you a base that the novellas and WoIaF can then expand on.  It probably doesn't matter if you do the novellas or WoIaF next, but I would still suggest reading the novellas before WoIaF since it will flush out the novels and allow the world book to then flush out both the novels and novellas. The details from WoIaF are nice, but to me they're not quite as fun if you don't know the story that it's providing background information for."

pureasoiaf,3860df,2xNoodle,3,Tue Jun 2 06:11:36 2015 UTC,"Depends what kind of spoiler barriers you're looking for. WoIaF contains some spoilers for the main series, so if you don't wanna be spoiled you should avoid that. Otherwise, You could read it first to get dat history knowledge going, but I don't recommend it; I think it serves much better as a backdrop to the knowledge you already have from the books, same with P&Q and TRP. I think the Dunk & Egg stories first wouldn't be a bad idea, but to be honest I think the plain old order of novels, novellas, history books is probably the best, but it depends on how you like your fiction. Also don't forget that you get so much out of these books when you reread them, I think my favourite read was my reread to be honest."
pureasoiaf,3860df,TheJJKG,3,Tue Jun 2 03:24:27 2015 UTC,"I'd start with the novellas first tbh. They don't have spoilers and they're a fun, lighter but still interesting introduction.

pureasoiaf,3860df,Aardquark,2,Tue Jun 2 08:12:10 2015 UTC,start with the main series. It slowly unlocks the world and the stuff in WOIAF won't make much sense without it. Also has some mild spoilers.

While the tales of Dunk and Egg are fantastic, and may be read on their own, I would say they mean a lot in lending back story to events mentioned in the main series. They can stand alone, but are even cooler when you see how they relate to the ""current"" events in Westeros."

Happy reading!  EDIT: Of course read the main novels first starting with A Game of Thrones first if this is the start of your journey into westeros."

As it was intended I believe or publication date.    That way you can feel as if you are part the the cultural discussion in the same sequence that other readers have experienced and read it.    kinda like boot camp, everyone did it...or like treking up Mt. Everest with a sherpa at the end.  With such a rich history in the series, it seems GRRM wanted all the initial clues and hidden meanings to be unveiled in a certain order, so that the build up for the reader is in sync with the authors periodic intentions.      Boiled Leather  makes some interesting points regarding the Histories of ASOIAF...scroll to the article, ""Feastdance: History Lessons"", SPOILERS, so please try not to scroll  to far down to the list...dont know if it'll help since your a virgin.....and stay away from this subreddit, lol.  (cuz of spoilers)    Happy Name Day to You!!  when that day comes and happy reading."

pureasoiaf,386cly,danbrown1996,19,Tue Jun 2 14:01:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for pointing it out.   “I looked at that book Maester Aemon left me. The Jade Compendium. The pages that told of Azor Ahai. Lightbringer was his sword. Tempered with his wife’s blood if Votar can be believed. Thereafter Lightbringer was never cold to the touch, but warm as Nissa Nissa had been warm. In battle the blade burned fiery hot. Once Azor Ahai fought a monster. When he thrust the sword through the belly of the beast, its blood began to boil. Smoke and steam poured from its mouth, its eyes melted and dribbled down its cheeks, and its body burst into flame.”  Clydas blinked. “A sword that makes its own heat …”  “… would be a fine thing on the Wall.” Jon put aside his wine cup and drew on his black moleskin gloves. “A pity that the sword that Stannis wields is cold. I’ll be curious to see how his Lightbringer behaves in battle.    ADWD, Jon III  Jon also connects that Stannis' sword does not give off heat. Does that mean that Jon Snow believes that the sword isn't Lightbringer?"
pureasoiaf,386cly,GaidenShinji,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:24:30 2015 UTC,"He knew Stannis' wasnt warm. but he still thinks its Lightbringer it glows like the fucking sun, good enough for him.   ""I'll be curious to see how his Lightbringer behaves in battle"" he just thinks it has different magic properties then fire/heat. Maybe ice/cold."
pureasoiaf,386cly,JohnnyManzealot,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:01:02 2015 UTC,I don't think that's necessarily true. He could be saying his Light Bringer as in its not the real Sword just a copy used by Stannis.
pureasoiaf,386cly,GaidenShinji,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:42:01 2015 UTC,"Of course its possible, but if Jon realized Stannis was bullshitting everyone with his fake lightbringer he should of at least had a thought about it cross his mind, he was just like ""oh the original was hot, cool""   And Jons never seen any magic as far as I remember, he was told stannis had a magical sword stannis pulls out a sword brighter then the sun. I don't believe he would question whether its real or not."

pureasoiaf,386cly,Minsc_NBoo,3,Tue Jun 2 18:20:23 2015 UTC,I don't think Jon cares that much whether Stannis is Azor Ahai or if the Lightbringer is fake. What matters to Jon is that Stannis is the King Who Came.
pureasoiaf,386cly,Brys_Beddict,3,Wed Jun 3 00:39:11 2015 UTC,I don't recall it ever being mentioned. Does Jon even know about the Azor Ahai legend?   Jon doesn't strike me as the sort of person who puts much belief in proficy... Not yet anyway

Kind of odd that no one questioned the existence of a knight with the family name of an extinct house though.   Wait, didn't Larys Clubfoot disappear without a trace?  Maybe the Strongs didn't die off.  I still don't know how to connect that to zombie mountain though."

Also Quiburn and Oberin may have been at the citadel at the same time, and Quiburn had the same teacher as Oberins daughter. Maybe also the same as Oberin.

pureasoiaf,385iyf,Luminaria19,5,Tue Jun 2 01:36:27 2015 UTC,Larys and Oberyn have strangely similar backgrounds. Larys is a Strong and Oberyn turns Clegane into a Strong.
pureasoiaf,385iyf,dobharcu,3,Tue Jun 2 01:44:50 2015 UTC,"Basically, I'm wondering if the similarities between Larys and Oberyn influenced Qyburn's decision to choose the name Robert Strong."

pureasoiaf,383wss,RCiancimino,6,Fri Jun 5 15:09:03 2015 UTC,I have heard boiled leather is the best way to read them chronologically

pureasoiaf,383wss,jeswanson86,3,Mon Jun 1 19:06:45 2015 UTC,yeah this guy took that into account and there are about 4 chapters that he moved around so that it wouldn't spoil things like that. Im pretty sure he has the cersi's chapter right before the davos one so that doesn't get ruined.
pureasoiaf,383wss,votenanocratic,2,Mon Jun 1 18:04:17 2015 UTC,"But the intent is that you go through half a book thinking Davos is dead... then in ADWD you get a ""OMG he's alive!"" moment.  With that said, when I do a reread, I'll be using the combined reading order, because it will offer a different perspective."
pureasoiaf,383wss,Sparkdog,4,Mon Jun 1 23:28:14 2015 UTC,I would never suggest a different read order for a first time reader. But I'm definitely going to try chronological on my next reread.

pureasoiaf,38a4sq,FuriousFap42,2,Tue Jun 2 23:37:58 2015 UTC,"but why Oppo's head?? the head was pretty big,  i know  dwarf have an anourmus head, but , i think they send  the mountain's head, and  use Oppo's head. or moon boy for  all i know."
pureasoiaf,38a4sq,Julamipol88,3,Wed Jun 3 17:39:15 2015 UTC,"but why Oppo's head?   because you need to send a head, and you have a giant head laying around. Quiburn even mentions that the beetles are done eating the flesh of the head. If you had the right head, with the right face, you would put it in tar.    i think they send the mountain's head, and use Oppo's head.   I am not a native speaker as well, so I am sympathetic, but What?  Are you saying they put Oppos head, which by the way was already rotting, on the mountains body? What kind of book do you think GRRM is writing? A grotesque slapstick comedy?   Think about it from a writers perspective: Why mention a dwarf with an enormous head, give that head to a character in need of a head and then mention that the beetles are eating of the flesh?"
