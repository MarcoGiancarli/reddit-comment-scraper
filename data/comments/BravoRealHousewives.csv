BravoRealHousewives,3e54xt,cuntmuffn,4,Wed Jul 22 01:20:23 2015 UTC,Ramona was hoping heathers jeans were cheaper than her necklaces. So awkward.

BravoRealHousewives,3e54xt,GooseCharmer,5,Wed Jul 22 02:01:42 2015 UTC,It seems petty for Ramona to donate 6 necklaces and get mad there wasn't a big sign thanking her. Did she donate for the charity or for the publicity?
BravoRealHousewives,3e54xt,BYE_FUHLEESHA,8,Wed Jul 22 01:22:03 2015 UTC,She just wanted to say true faith on camera as many times as possible.
BravoRealHousewives,3e54xt,Penelope2124,6,Wed Jul 22 01:25:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly! It's not like Ramona helped with the event at all, aside from bedazzling the jeans. I highly doubt she contributed to the rental fee, the open bar, and everything else that goes into these charity events. Take many seats, Ramona."
BravoRealHousewives,3e54xt,cuntmuffn,2,Wed Jul 22 01:23:41 2015 UTC,"From the sponsorship documents I've seen, it cost at least 1k to have your logo on things. Heather likely donated more money for it besides just jeans."
BravoRealHousewives,3e54xt,trashb0x,2,Wed Jul 22 01:27:34 2015 UTC,Kristen's blog states that Heather and her have been working on it for 6 weeks. Heather donated hundreds of pairs of jeans and staff to run the sale of the jeans.
BravoRealHousewives,3e54xt,soupastar,5,Wed Jul 22 04:12:54 2015 UTC,Remember when jill had that charity thing and ramona was all its so tacky and against the social rules to put your company name on the thing celebs stand in front of to take pics and now she wants a big sign at a charity event.

BravoRealHousewives,3e54xt,The_Burning_Kumquat,3,Wed Jul 22 04:43:25 2015 UTC,I get that Ramona wanted her brand at the event but from what I've seen they're not going to post a logo because you donated $300 worth of goods. Heathers company may very well have donated money for the signage and clothing racks.
BravoRealHousewives,3e54xt,Louielouielouise,2,Wed Jul 22 01:24:57 2015 UTC,As well as the jeans they decorated for auction and some racks of jeans where proceeds go to the charity.

BravoRealHousewives,3e54xt,BYE_FUHLEESHA,5,Wed Jul 22 01:32:39 2015 UTC,"my mom, her sisters, my grandmother and so on all read cards. it's a family/cultural thing, I think, but I am very protective of these kinds of traditions because they can do some really accurate and intimate readings. it bugs me when people are dismissive of the practice because it feels like they're belittling my family.  that being said, I think there is a major difference between the woman who read the coffee tonight and the medium from RHOC yesterday."
BravoRealHousewives,3e54xt,Candy_Darling,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:42:23 2015 UTC,That's so cool. I am on the fence if I would do it or not. Part of me feels like anything in the future would just mess with me. But to learn about my angels or something like the reader in NY would be really cool. I think there was an obvious difference between the one in OC and in NY. The one on OC jus seemed like an actor or something.
BravoRealHousewives,3e54xt,numera,4,Wed Jul 22 01:44:48 2015 UTC,"god, that guy was awful. when I was watching that all I could think about was how much money my mom could make in Orange County if she wanted to be a reader for rich people.

BravoRealHousewives,3e54xt,lotus8189,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:57:18 2015 UTC,Yeah I feel like she must have said her mom just died or something it was so generic. I loved the coffee readings you could tell she really hit the mark.

BravoRealHousewives,3e54xt,Candy_Darling,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:50:27 2015 UTC,Carole linked her on twitter! Hopefully she will do well with all of the free publicity :)
BravoRealHousewives,3e54xt,soupastar,2,Wed Jul 22 05:05:30 2015 UTC,"Up until this episode I was always a big fan of Carole, and never understood why so many fans were turning on her this season. After seeing some glimpses here and there, I kinda get it. The way she was whining and joking around about not wanting to go pick up her husband's ashes seemed really cold and inappropriate. Aren't his ashes just like  waiting to get picked up...? Perhaps it's a defense mechanism for her, but it definitely gave me a new outlook on her"
BravoRealHousewives,3e54xt,numera,11,Wed Jul 22 02:07:42 2015 UTC,"Her husband's ashes were in a church in England.  The church is now being turned into condos, so the ashes have to be moved.  I can imagine, as a widow, it would probably be a really traumatic thing to have to remove your husband from what you thought would be his final resting place.  I know I would probably procrastinate with that because of how hard it would be to go through that again.  I, personally, didn't get the impression that she was being cold or inappropriate.  Sometimes people use humor to ease a difficult situation.  Just my two cents."
BravoRealHousewives,3e54xt,trashb0x,6,Wed Jul 22 02:22:50 2015 UTC,I think she feels awkward about it since her relationship with Adam at this point is still new. I really liked hearing her talk about her marriage as well as seeing her and Adam together this episode.
BravoRealHousewives,3e54xt,CHRISTINAK1980,2,Wed Jul 22 02:17:15 2015 UTC,Carole can be very guarded about her life. I'm giving her a pass on the ashes thing. I like her and Adam together. Love CRs apartment.
BravoRealHousewives,3e54xt,souprgirl,2,Wed Jul 22 04:47:32 2015 UTC,Her blogs last year were pretty great. She has some good one liners but sometimes she's a hypocrite shot starter
BravoRealHousewives,3e54xt,Candy_Darling,2,Wed Jul 22 02:17:26 2015 UTC,"I wasn't bothered by that, but I was bothered by how she tried to buy premade olive tapenade at the fancy supermarket when her CHEF boyfriend wanted to buy olives to make it himself"
BravoRealHousewives,3e54xt,Madethisonambien,3,Wed Jul 22 02:43:26 2015 UTC,I loved the dinner party. I think I'm slightly in love with Heather's husband. He just seems so calm and so nice. I still haven't made up my mind about Carole and Adam though.

BravoRealHousewives,3e1ibf,scro-hawk,5,Tue Jul 21 07:24:57 2015 UTC,I whole-heartedly agree with you on the steroid use.  I was watching Botched and the doctors said that anabolic steroids and human growth hormones will cause bone to grow on top of bone.  I have a feeling this is what happened :(
BravoRealHousewives,3e1ibf,deathbyshoeshoe,3,Tue Jul 21 07:28:20 2015 UTC,He's so obviously using steroids. You don't get to have big arms and be all buff AND have a defined six pack naturally.
BravoRealHousewives,3e1ibf,lilyponss,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:30:46 2015 UTC,His face shape was different first season. His jaw seems much more exaggerated now. Have no idea about the cause but it seems like it happened between the first and second seasons. I can believe steroids and he did admit he was using supplements on camera including at least one that a doctor said was dangerous.
BravoRealHousewives,3e1ibf,MGoBlue22,5,Tue Jul 21 22:19:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know what you mean.  It's like his face shape is a pentagon, wide at the bottom and pointy side down--very odd."

I'm used to circles, ovals, hearts, squares, but Jax brought a whole different shape to the game. And it looks truly horrible. He's even more cro-magnon than usual.

BravoRealHousewives,3e1ibf,brewheehee,4,Tue Jul 21 17:32:29 2015 UTC,"Hummmm I wonder if part of the reason his face shape looks so weird is his now over-done nose? Here he was before. The bottom of his face was still wide, and stuck out a little more on the right, but it didn't look nearly as bad as it looks now."
BravoRealHousewives,3e1ibf,SeahorseSabbatical,2,Tue Jul 21 07:46:16 2015 UTC,"Haha I didn't even notice the nose! But I don't think that's it because if you look at his mug shot again, his face literally angles outward from his temples. And in the picture you shared, it doesn't, especially not that drastically, even though he's smiling."
BravoRealHousewives,3e1ibf,mmmmmkay,2,Tue Jul 21 14:46:15 2015 UTC,"Gosh he tries way too hard. Like what's with the smoldering eyes look? It's a mugshot, Jax. Be normal for once."

BravoRealHousewives,3dziqt,birdsofterrordise,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:15:21 2015 UTC,"They should have gotten him counselling, Tamera is not self aware enough to deal with his problems when they were popping up in childhood."
BravoRealHousewives,3dziqt,NothappyJane,0,Tue Jul 21 08:30:14 2015 UTC,"well its simply genetics. men mostly inherit mental characteristics of their mothers, while physical characteristics of their father. and vice versa"
BravoRealHousewives,3dziqt,Makla90,2,Tue Jul 21 08:28:34 2015 UTC,Well there's no just science to back up men inheriting their mother's mental characteristics over their father's... not how genetics work.
BravoRealHousewives,3dziqt,Buster_hymen90,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:15:38 2015 UTC,Yeah....I'm a little bit wtf on that too.
BravoRealHousewives,3dziqt,Pancakesforfunsies,15,Wed Jul 22 04:35:45 2015 UTC,I never knew that she lost custody of her daughter until I read your post here. I googled to find out why and that sounds pretty tragic too. It sounds like one of the main catalysts of that was the way Tamara portrays herself on the show and the stress and ridicule that her daughter deals with as a result of that.
BravoRealHousewives,3dziqt,thegirlyshow,3,Tue Jul 21 00:06:27 2015 UTC,Simon has done is very best to drive a wedge between them. A decent would encourage them to overcome whatever problems they had with her lashing out in a time of extreme stress instead of magnifying them.
BravoRealHousewives,3dziqt,NothappyJane,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:31:14 2015 UTC,Idk at some point a break might be needed one to heal the child and two for tamra to learn how to handle her wanting to see her dad and just how to deal with a teen. In some cases it's best. Maybe the child would be more harmed to keep trying to reunite with a mother who at every turn takes offense to the kid wanting to be around the dad and when she needs to communicate with her makes it all about how the kid has hurt her. It sucks and in a perfect world we would never need to be separated from our parents but after what I saw in foster care yeah sometime it's needed

BravoRealHousewives,3dziqt,soupastar,3,Mon Jul 20 21:43:49 2015 UTC,This is one time I truly feel bad for Tamra. Im a domestic abuse victim and I would be devastated to see my son grow up and abuse someone. I luckily left when he was quite young and his father has chosen drugs over his son so he doesn't even remember him or the abuse.  I hope she refuses to help him financially anymore until he gets counseling.

BravoRealHousewives,3dziqt,noonelikesyouamy,4,Tue Jul 21 17:03:48 2015 UTC,Why would you have lots of guns at your house filled with children?
BravoRealHousewives,3dziqt,birdsofterrordise,10,Mon Jul 20 23:06:11 2015 UTC,"In my old neighborhood, a little boy was shot and killed by his cousin because they found a gun in the parents bedroom and they thought it was a toy. Contrary to popular belief, not all guns have a safety. People keep their guns out and loaded because if they truly believe they are at risk, their gun needs to be accessible. I think many Americans need to reconsider, especially with children, the risk of having a loaded gun with their level of safety risk.  We live in a modern developed country and majority of the country is completely safe though. I don't think it is worth the risk."
BravoRealHousewives,3dziqt,ElectroHottie666,4,Tue Jul 21 00:19:45 2015 UTC,I totally agree! I think it's a horrible idea to keep a gun in a house where children are present. Does anyone remember the RHOC episode where Peggy revealed she almost killed herself with her own gun?!
