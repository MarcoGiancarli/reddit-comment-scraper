shittykickstarters,3dzrzd,amdc,9,Tue Jul 21 13:10:43 2015 UTC,"I used to work for a startup mobile game company with an old friend from the army and one of his army buddies.  These guys basically spent the entire decade from 2000 on deployed overseas and when they got back they for some reason thought that their experience on the frontlines was a natural stepping stone to app and game development.  No need for coding classes, just do a Kickstarter for Unity fees and start building!  I won't even go into the mess of a ""game"" they tried to make, and how embarrassed I was helping them advertise it.    What's relevant here is their brilliant app idea.  Basically, it was the app in the OP, except instead of being restricted to dating it was a full social media monitoring app.  The kid would have to put their Facebook/Twitter/Myspace(yes seriously)/etc account info into the app, and then the parent would have to approve posts, friend requests, PMs, whatever else.  I pointed out that kids would simply not do this, for example by creating separate accounts for posting and a fake account to give to their parents.  I also pointed out that, not knowing how to code, and having absolutely zero design experience, there would be no way to actually do this.  Don't worry, they said, kids won't circumvent their parents unless they're little shits.  And don't worry, they said, Unity makes app development easy, you barely need to know any code!  Well it's been about 3 years since I've left that company and so far they've released two games (well 4 games, because they split it up into demo and full versions like it's 1999) with a total download count of 10-50.    Still waiting on their social media app though."

These beacon things are integrated into things you interact with directly or indirectly which then produce a signal based on the action. For instance, one would be attached to my door that uses the energy from me opening my door to emit a signal that my smartphone picks up, and that I've set up to connect to my Bluetooth audio system and play a playlist.   Or when I do motor actions at the gym in the form of lifting, its powers the one in my wristband that emits a signal to say ""I did a rep!"" For my current chosen exercise."

Let's not think about why I would need such a beacon cube (the clip suggests to sprinkle my lawn?). I am just assuming that they are targeting maker and developer. So let's pretend somebody needs this cube: Where is the water turbine that is supposed to power this going in? Or how does it use the sun, when there is no solar panel? The other clip on the side is even more confusing, as it suggests that this cuby-thingy is activated by light, movement or liquid passing through it (?!!) - so no using it as power source but as trigger? This is bizarre on so many levels.."

They don't want to just play an audio file on another device; they want to play that file with exact synchronization across 2+ devices.  There is lots of latency to consider; network, audio stack and probably more.  And they seem to want this to run on different hardware, so the latency might be very different between devices in the cluster."
shittykickstarters,3drwqs,samdroid_,5,Sun Jul 19 03:34:09 2015 UTC,"To be fair--- spotify like, almost does this.  Spotify has a ""switch device"" feature, so from my phone I can tell my computer to start playing.  Maybe 80% of the time, the song is in the exact same spot."

shittykickstarters,3drwqs,samdroid_,7,Sun Jul 19 08:03:29 2015 UTC,"Yup, it's instantaneous.  But, as a software engineer, this is how I think they do it.  Spotify has the benefit of having a shared & standardized library of music.  So, if you switch from playing a song from your phone to your computer, they aren't actually streaming music. They're just saying: ""HEY other device, play The New Pornographers - Bones of an Idol at 1:32.  Do it now.""   They might even have some kind of ""cache warming"".  Like, if I'm playing a song on my phone, they might load it into the cache of any other spotify devices I have online.  It wouldn't surprise me, because spotify is a glutten for bandwidth.  -_-;"

shittykickstarters,3drwqs,joemckie,2,Sun Jul 19 09:27:49 2015 UTC,"The issue though, is that it's just telling the computer what to stream from Spotify.  It's using the internet connection.  This project wants one host device to stream audio to all the shared devices. That means the host phone has to handle all the bandwidth.  In THEORY, it could use the microphone to determine if there's sync issues and each phone could compensate, but bluetooth still doesn't have the bandwidth/protocol necessary to stream HD audio to more than one device at a time."

Â  Mid DEC 2015: Certifications: CE, FCC, UL (duration 8-12 weeks for such a complex product: Dragonfly, Headsets, DC-Docking Stationâ¦)  Â  Mid MARCH 2016: Logistics, Shipping & Customs (surely coming from China, that is a safe bet)  Â  Mid JUNE 2016: Delivery of Dragonfly Â    THIS is assuming they are by now ready to start tooling, with NO buffer for: Â    Technical issues & draw backs (ME, EE issues always happen) No tooling issues (always happen, or broken tools, redoes etc.) No testing after production included Streamlined parts sourcing and testing from manufacturer Packaging and logistics in place No software engineering, testing, sourcing etc. included Â    So, HOW on EARTH can these Harry PÃ¶tters lie to all their backers stating a delivery date for Q4 2015? Am I missing something?

shittykickstarters,3dlyq8,chipbod,7,Fri Jul 17 18:59:22 2015 UTC,"I'm really curious about how the Dragonfly project will turn out.  Will they just never produce anything or eventually produce a very crappy product?  Also, I think maybe I spend too much time at this subreddit, but I can't remember a single expensive product funded through Kickstarter that actually worked out well."
shittykickstarters,3dlyq8,PointyOintment,3,Fri Jul 17 15:29:36 2015 UTC,"*hint: indiegogo ;)  Depends what you mean by expensive, but the HIDDEN speaker I pledged some years ago on KS works fine until now.  As for this project, already the tooling costs easily eat up the majority of their complete funding until now. So without external VCs this will never show up. Not for nothing other similar complex projects look for millions in funding, with a team of 20+ and not Jeff + Bridget and the Russian 3D animator..."
shittykickstarters,3dlyq8,pug_bomb,4,Fri Jul 17 17:24:27 2015 UTC,"For these impractical campaigns like this, Kickstarter and Indiegogo should require them to secure VCs within a certain amount of time or refund the pledges.

shittykickstarters,3ddmud,interfect,12,Thu Jul 16 05:48:46 2015 UTC,"I'm with Kickstarter on this one. The Holus display looks genuinely useful, and while it's not stereoscopic and the head tracking isn't implemented, it's pretty clear to me where they're going with it and what its limitations are. It might be better if they put up a video of the wonkiness at the corners with position tracking off, but if they get the tracking right that will go away.  A person who backs things without reading about what they are actually supposed to do and their money are soon parted."
shittykickstarters,3ddmud,Hadrosauroidea,46,Wed Jul 15 15:11:14 2015 UTC,"Holus originally posted the campaign with some very misleading CGI video. It's my understanding that they raised over $250k before that CGI was removed.  Holus has never, to my knowledge, told its backers that there was misleading CGI on their campaign, or told them that this CGI was required to be removed by Kickstarter.  They then posted a campaign update that was supposed to explain how the thing actually worked. Again, the Kickstarter CEO says this was an imposed requirement on the Holus team, but the update only says, ""We have had some requests to clarify on mechanisms of Holus.""  I'm sure there are backers who are aware of the controversy and are backing the project anyway. That's great, they're getting what they want!  I'm also sure there are backers who backed it based on misleading information and just didn't pay that much attention after making their pledge. I'd say that group of people have been ill served by Kickstarter.  What Kickstarter should be doing is maintaining a public list of enforced changes to campaigns, and emailing backers anytime there's a new entry on that list for a campaign they've backed.  You can bet campaigners will read and follow the rules more closely if Kickstarter implements something like that."
shittykickstarters,3ddmud,skeletalcarp,4,Wed Jul 15 17:43:42 2015 UTC,"Right. If the original campaign was what is up now, there would be no problem. According to kicktraq the project reached $150k in the first day, long before it was fixed."
shittykickstarters,3ddmud,squirrelpotpie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:43:02 2015 UTC,"but the update only says, ""We have had some requests to clarify on mechanisms of Holus.""   Wait, I'm confused.  Did they update their backers, or did they not update their backers?  Because it kind of sounds like they did update their backers, and some people are just angry that they used the same sugar coated positive language as every single public statement ever given.  If you have pledged to give someone your money and you get a statement from them saying ""We have had some requests to clarify on mechanisms of [thing]"", you have an easy choice to make.  If you care about that money, you go back to that kickstarter page and follow up on what that means.  If you don't care about that money, you don't.   I'm also sure there are backers who [...] just didn't pay that much attention after making their pledge.    Whose fault is that, exactly?  Nobody who cares whether they have money or product at the end of the day should ever, ever just fire-and-forget a pledge without vetting the idea and occasionally checking back in on progress.   What Kickstarter should be doing is maintaining a public list of enforced changes to campaigns, and emailing backers anytime there's a new entry on that list for a campaign they've backed.  You can bet campaigners will read and follow the rules more closely if Kickstarter implements something like that.   You can bet campaigners will revolt, if Kickstarter takes away their ability to communicate with their customers using their own choice of words.  You can also bet that if Kickstarter gave out those notices, they would be even more vague and sugar-coated than this one was.  Anyone who cares about the money they're putting down on Kickstarter and is not aware of what rules campaigners do and don't have to follow, is an idiot.  You cannot change the fact that it's easy to take advantage of idiots.  Let's break down this communication that you're saying was insufficient:   ""We have had some requests to clarify on mechanisms of Holus.""   Yes it's sugar-coated PR-speak, but what is the meaning of this sentence?  The meaning I extract, in different words, is ""We have been asked to revise our presentation to better show how our product actually works.""  What kind of investor (because that's what you are on Kickstarter) hears that from the people they gave their money to, and doesn't follow up to see what's going on?"

shittykickstarters,3ddmud,squirrelpotpie,-7,Thu Jul 16 03:39:23 2015 UTC,"I agree, and I have a problem with people like the blogger who don't seem to be willing to accept the reality of what Kickstarter is, and isn't.  This really needs to be driven home for everybody who uses crowdfunding.  When you look at a project page, you are using your imagination to envision how something that doesn't exist yet might work, in the future, if and when it gets finished, if they are able to get it to work the way they think they can, based entirely on a description given by people you don't know, who are very clear about the fact that they are trying to get your money.  To any sane person with something between their ears, this situation should indicate a need for reasonable caution.  Anyone who enters into a situation like that and thinks ""I'm sure I can assume this is trustworthy and will work exactly like the impression I get from their pre-production marketing"" needs to get the fuck off of Kickstarter, immediately.  Do not pass Go, do not spend that $200 on a Photoshop concept of a technology that yesterday you thought only existed in science-fiction.  This is not something Kickstarter is doing, it's not a policy thing, it's what crowdfunding is.  Kickstarter cannot be the communal mommy that prevents all of its members from spending money unwisely.  (I mean seriously, have you seen some of the things people spend money on?)  Short of a certain extreme threshold of obvious intent to deceive, it is impossible for Kickstarter to play referee.  We, as a community, are just too weird and unpredictable.  Sure, they used ""hologram"" in a slightly weasely way.  Do people think this is new??  Weasel words that communicate something better than what the product actually is to get gullible people to buy it, happens every day in every kind of every store everywhere on the planet.  Imagery that shows the product being maybe slightly better than it actually is, or doing something it doesn't quite really do, to make a sale?  Happens every place where products are sold on a shelf, or in a container.  Public statements said in the nicest way possible, almost to the point that it hides the bad news so people don't notice it?  Someone who complains about a marketing team doing this cannot possibly have been on this planet for more than an hour.  This is almost worse than simply not understanding that ""Kistarter is not a store.""  This is wanting to be able to just toss your money at things, without doing any research or follow-up, without understanding what you're buying, without looking for any other opinions, and honestly expecting that the organizations making money off of you behaving this way are going to be bound to only work in your best interest.    Anyone who fires off a pledge right when a project goes up and never checks back to see how it's doing, is practically begging for disappointment.  Anyone who can't or won't try to cut through the marketing and follow up to make sure the company plans to make what they think they'll get, doesn't just need to immediately get the fuck off of Kickstarter, they need to stay home, turn off the TV, and give their finances to someone else to be managed for them.  That person will be unjustly separated from their money practically everywhere they go.  I don't see what Kickstarter could possibly have done different here.  This is nothing more than greasy marketing working as intended on lazy people who aren't careful with their money.  Just like it always has since the day ancient human traders figured out they could get more stuff by putting the best looking rocks on the top of the pile."
shittykickstarters,3ddmud,slow56k,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:23:59 2015 UTC,"Yancey Stricklerâs full message  Hi Joanie â Yancey from Kickstarter here. Iâm responding, in part, to thank you for the attention youâve paid to the Holus project. Weâve seen a lot of debate and strong feelings around the project, and weâve heard a lot of questions about our policies and how we enforce them. Iâd love to clear up a few things about how we did so in this case. Part of the issue weâve seen with this project revolves around words like âhologram,â âholographic,â and âholographic experience,â which people have come to use in so many different colloquial ways. Some of our most-discussed âhologramsââââTupac Shakurâs appearance at Coachella, CNNâs election-night guestsâââarenât holograms at all. Even Microsoft bills its HoloLens as a holographic product. Thereâs an odd lack of clarity involved in what many people mean and understand when they say the words. So in this case, our approach was to focus in on how Holus actually worked. We asked the Holus team to post an update that demonstrated, clearly and openly, exactly what they were working on. They responded with a public update that outlined the technique they use. That update was emailed to backers of the project, to help make sure everyone involved was fully clear on what they were supporting and what they could expect. Then thereâs the question of our rules for hardware projects. First, we require creators to show prototypes of their work. Second, we prohibit them from using photorealistic renderings. Holus satisfied the first rule, posting a number of demo videos and documentation showing working prototypes. But when the project originally launched, it included CGI renderings. We informed them that this was strictly prohibited; they promptly removed the material. They also emailed backers to clarify their process, including a video demonstrating their iterative prototypes. And last, thereâs the question of the staff pick. Holus was originally selected as one, until we spotted and received reports about CGI renderings. We immediately removed the staff pick status, and asked the Holus team to remove the badge theyâd added to their project image. (Staff pick badges arenât a part of our system; we donât create them or provide them. Actually, we strongly advise creators not to use them at all.) They promptly did so. In other words, the project conformed to our stated rules, added more information on request, and made a transparent, good-faith effort to thoroughly inform backers about the nature of their work. Based on that, we continued to monitor it, but allowed it to remain on the site. The question then became: were people interested in backing it? And this is the part where youâââand the broader Kickstarter community watching these projectsâââbecome invaluable. One of the reasons Kickstarter uses all-or-nothing funding is because it gives everyone involved in a project time to really research what the creators are doing, discuss it with others, and come to a collective decision about whether itâs still worth supporting. Ultimately, itâs backers who decide what gets funding, not us. Thatâs why weâre always grateful to anyone who joins in the public debate about projects, asks tough questions about the claims theyâre hearing, and shares their expertise with other backers. That kind of discussion is crucial, especially when it comes to new technology. It helps our Integrity team monitor projects for problems or violations of our rulesâââas we did throughout the Holus campaign. It helps backers vet ideas and make the most informed decisions possible. It holds creators to a high standard, and helps them build stronger communities. It does all these things no matter what action Kickstarter winds up needing to take, and whether projects succeed or fail. And thatâs why Iâd like to thank youâââand to say that, if youâve chosen not to get involved in any more projects, weâre sad to hear it. The role you played in this one is incredibly important. Members like you are welcome in this community any time: you make things better for everyone involved. Cheers Yancey"

shittykickstarters,3ddmud,crwcomposer,4,Wed Jul 15 20:55:59 2015 UTC,"No, I never said anything that implied that.  Some people were skeptical of their claims from the start.

It's common sense (and also explicitly in the FAQ and the terms of agreement) that Kickstarter isn't responsible for fulfillment and that there's a risk associated with funding a startup project."
shittykickstarters,3ddmud,giverous,2,Wed Jul 15 21:04:26 2015 UTC,"I still think that the project should have been pulled and relisted without the misleading visuals or at the very least, all backers should have received an email explaining the situation.  I completely agree that the final blame lands on the shoulders of backers, but you have to at least give people the chance to make that decision based on the most honest and accurate information."
shittykickstarters,3ddmud,crwcomposer,2,Wed Jul 15 21:22:13 2015 UTC,"give people the chance to make that decision based on the most honest and accurate information.   That's just not possible with user generated content.  Kickstarter can't possibly do an audit of every single project on the entire website. They can't do forensic analysis on every image to determine if CGI was used. Or look at the business plan of every single project. Etc.  Some enterprising individual proved, or otherwise got them to admit, that the visuals were CGI, and Kickstarter made sure they were removed. That's about as much as can be expected."
shittykickstarters,3ddmud,giverous,3,Wed Jul 15 21:27:41 2015 UTC,"I get that size limits what they can do in an active capacity, but when events like that occur, it's beyond trivial to fire off an email to all current backers simply saying something like:  ""In the interest of transparency, we feel we should inform you that a kickstarter project you recently backed ('insert project name') was found to be using misleading CGI visuals.  The project has since removed these visuals in line with kickstarter policy, and we recommend that all existing backers check the project as it stands to ensure that they still wish to pledge their support.  We try to ensure the highest levels of quality here at kickstarter... blah blah marketing spiel.""  It could be a cookie cutter email template, with the relevant details merged in.

At any rate, retransmission is legitimately a problem for some types of internet connections. This also circumvents TCP flow control, and ISP throttling of traffic to specific destinations or over specific protocols, both of which reduce speed. It's also possible to reduce the number of redundant bits needed to reconstruct your data according to the observed error rate, which would mean you wouldn't suffer a significant performance penalty on a good internet connection.

This is the most blatant trademark infringement I've ever seen on what looks like a serious Indiegogo project.  Edit:  Based on the fact that none of their videos actually show their backpack, they're blatantly infringing on the Tesla brand and all the feature images look like photoshops of features pasted onto the side of a bag, I think this is a fraudulent project.  Even those Discount Cards appear to be fake.  Their version of the image  Could probably find more weird things doing reverse google image search on bits of their stock photography.  Edit again..

AC works by compressing a gas into a liquid, cooling the liquid through water or another heat sink, and then dropping the pressure to expand back to gas.  The problem is that there is no heat sink on this thing that leads out of the room.

shittykickstarters,3cs7wd,Asmordean,9,Sat Jul 11 04:22:55 2015 UTC,"So I just watched the video and it looks like anyone backing this is an idiot. I see ZERO footage of a camera moving around the device to show that it's anything other than a completely 2 dimensional image. As other articles have stated about it, it says you can view the content from '4 different angles', so yeah it's not properly holographic, but I think anyone who believes otherwise just hasn't looked at the facts.  I don't think it's technically a 'scam' however, I think it's just shit. Although the rule breaking photos and 'staff pick' bullshit should have got the authors in a bunch of trouble.  With 5 minutes to go, I can't see Kickstarter stopping it now. Kickstarter have clearly weighed up their options and decided the money they get from this is worth more than the negative attention they'll get. I'm sure they'll wait for some big high profile scam that makes major news before they decide to publically announce new rules and enforcement, so they can get as much money as possible without losing consumer trust."
shittykickstarters,3cs7wd,CressCrowbits,0,Fri Jul 10 12:56:37 2015 UTC,"If you watch the second video here, they explain it clearly and do move the camera to show the holographic effect.

The Kickstarter platform absolutely needs trust by its users, otherwise it's going to be toast once the old users that were already cheated out of their money outweigh the new signups that don't know how it works yet.

shittykickstarters,3cs7wd,ironplated,3,Fri Jul 10 20:21:13 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure they used some ""Kickstarter marketing company"" to get the initial fund amount. It makes NO sense that this company would raise 50k immediately and it tapers off severely afterwards.  I know some people that work at the company too and I'm willing to bet they threw a lot of their own money into the kickstarter to immediately inflate the funding amounts.  The thing that confuses me is that I don't think they're trying to ""scam"" people per se, just over hyping a lame and impractical product.

I think it started with some dishonest depictions, but I no longer think it's a scam.  The only picture I could find on their current page that is probably a rendering is this one.  The model of a town is no longer anywhere I could find.  In addition, they are being pretty honest about how things work in the two videos under ""How it works"".  They say that they are flat projections, but that they make it look 3D by having the projections move to change their perspective and also by having adjacent screens show images at the angle that will make it look stitched together.  I'm not explaining it well, but it looks reasonable to me.  I have read two articles claiming the Holus is a scam, and neither address how the Holus actually claims to work, and instead they both said it's not a real 3D hologram.  Also, they no longer claim they are a staff pick.  I'm not saying that anyone should back them, or that Kickstarter is a good, honest company.  I'm just saying that from the evidence, I believe the Holus actually works pretty well and does what it says it will do, which is currently different from what the person who wrote the article claims.    TL;DR: The Holus was dishonest in the beginning, but they have actually made a good product that works a lot better than the people claiming it's a scam think it does."
shittykickstarters,3cs7wd,MathildaIsTheBest,26,Fri Jul 10 11:44:59 2015 UTC,"Holus raised $250k+ with faker than fake images of how their product would work. The fact that, after they have that money in the bank, they change the imagery to be more honest doesn't exonerate them from deceiving people in the first place.   Their original images implied a degree of fidelity that is impossible and, more importantly, showed these ""holographs"" extending around the edge of the pyramid -- both of which are impossible and both make the product look far better than it will actually be.  Scam might not be the right word here because, unlike other Kickstarters this sub has covered, I don't think these guys are going to just run away with people's money, but they have used blatantly deceptive marketing tactics and Kickstarter has turned a blind eye."
shittykickstarters,3cs7wd,NervousMcStabby,4,Fri Jul 10 12:58:12 2015 UTC,"I agree that it doesn't exonerate them.  I just think that the claims that it is a scam are too harsh, and the articles critiquing it aren't actually looking at what it does (or at least the two articles I read).     Their original images implied a degree of fidelity that is impossible and, more importantly, showed these ""holographs"" extending around the edge of the pyramid -- both of which are impossible    For the extending around the corners part, did you watch this video?  It's not perfect, but it looks like they can make the image look okay from a corner.  The relevant part of the video starts at the 1:00 mark, and the demonstration is at 1:30.   but they have used blatantly deceptive marketing tactics and Kickstarter has turned a blind eye.   I think you're probably right, but it's also unclear what Kickstarter has done.  The fact that they got rid of the deceptive parts suggests that Kickstarter could have gotten involved.  They also could have not done anything.  I don't know.  I think Kickstarter should have e-mailed the backers to tell them about the deceptive marketing, which it doesn't look like they did.  However, I think even the early backers aren't in the dark.  There have been updates, which are sent to backers, including the video explanations of how it works.  Since funding ended today, I assume Holus didn't have their money until today (I could be wrong), so there were two weeks during which people could have decided that the prototype wasn't what they wanted and withdrawn their money.  That said, I think evidence has shown Kickstarter is much less harsh on scams and deceptive advertising than they should be."

Having to small display side by side is absolutely ridiculous and is not at all an efficient way to use a computer. If you want a full size keyboard with a tablet just buy a microsoft surface. It already exist and doesn't have 10 breaking points. The phone part is absolutely massive and there is no way they can cram that much stuff in someth.ing that small.  To me this jsut looks impractical and trying to do too much at the same time. I just odn't see the point. If you need to work on the go buy a laptop with a touchscreen that can be used in tablet mode there are plenty of those. If you want a big phone buy one most android phones are huge now.

A quick googling shows that new electrolysis apparatus currently being researched is only ~80% efficient at  47 kWh/kgH2.  (frankly this is amazing already if true)  If we scrap his rocket engine and just go with a conventional hydrogen engine, a highly efficient engine of that type seems to be about ~50% efficient.  Then we consider that the best generators available offer about 60% efficiency.   So, if we start with a compressed tank of 100kg of hydrogen.   Based on some standard table of fuel energy density which says hydrogen has ~33.3kwH/kg of energy when combusted, this gives us 3.33 MWH of energy.   Our engine produces only 1.665 MWH of mechanical energy from this since it has ~50% efficiency.   The generator then generates ~999kWH of energy in the form of electricity.   Feeding this into our ground breaking electrolyser which generates 1 kg of H2 per 47KWh of electricity, gives us 21 KG of hydrogen.  Thus, this setup requires us to burn 100 KG of hydrogen to create 21 KG of hydrogen, not even including the compressors in his diagram that pressurize the O2 and H2.  This gives us a highly optimistic efficiency of 21% (100% being unity)."

shittykickstarters,3cn10s,superserious1112,13,Thu Jul 9 06:29:55 2015 UTC,I don't know much about the patent system but I couldn't find that number anywhere in the hongkong or international patent databases.  Can someone who is familiar with patents find out where that number is registered and what technology it applies to?
shittykickstarters,3cn10s,HuTheFinnMan,12,Thu Jul 9 06:11:26 2015 UTC,my guess is that it's just the number of a patent application they filed (if even that) and the patent still has to be approved. not sure if there is a database to look through patent applications.
shittykickstarters,3cn10s,Misui,6,Thu Jul 9 11:33:21 2015 UTC,"There is, in the US at least.  http://appft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/search-adv.html   or  http://appft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html"
shittykickstarters,3cn10s,IIoWoII,5,Thu Jul 9 12:10:41 2015 UTC,Yeah I'd like to know too. The ironic thing is that the few people who are questioning the patent over on Kickstarter are getting drowned out by all the hopeful backers commenting about their design preference.
shittykickstarters,3cn10s,computerneedsfickin,3,Thu Jul 9 11:26:26 2015 UTC,"It could be an application number but the patent will only be disclose in something like 9 months. I don't follow all the story but it's sound shitty to use lame excuse about patent pending to not show a damn thing. If you disclose an information, it can't be patented afterward, but you can make some exhibit without showing how the inside works.  The new design thing is pretty disturbing too..."
shittykickstarters,3cn10s,Snap74,2,Thu Jul 9 11:34:53 2015 UTC,"It's a Chinese patent application number. The Chinese patent office only publishes applications in large blocks a few times a year. The last update was at the end of March. If it actually exists, it's very unlikely it will see the light of day before the shit hits the fan in October. Just another Arist red herring."

shittykickstarters,3cn10s,superserious1112,6,Fri Jul 10 04:37:43 2015 UTC,"Seems like a hail mary to buy more time.  I bet they thought people would go for the new design, thus giving them an excuse to extend the delivery date.  What they didn't count on is Americans not liking the cheesy asian egg design."
shittykickstarters,3cn10s,450k_crackparty,6,Thu Jul 9 16:20:38 2015 UTC,There's no formal poll though for backers to vote besides flooding the comments section. They can still decide to go with the new design and extend the time lol.
shittykickstarters,3cn10s,computerneedsfickin,2,Thu Jul 9 19:20:20 2015 UTC,"Yup, exactly this. Regardless of what people ask for, they'll simply say they have an overwhelming response for the new design so this means redesigning XYZ which will take longer and cost ABC but will also benefit you by giving you faster/better/more DEF.   I still love reading the positive comments. Those poor people, just blindly following something that has been all but proven is a scam and won't ever exist."
shittykickstarters,3cn10s,decker12,4,Thu Jul 9 22:58:21 2015 UTC,"They note that the salary numbers listed are only a fraction of the whole salary and they pay salary from separate funds from kick starter. OK, then why not also pay the deficit they mention with those same funds?"
shittykickstarters,3cn10s,ProtoJazz,2,Thu Jul 9 14:01:28 2015 UTC,"These things are so obvious, it's amazing that their trick worked and 95% of the comments are people ""voting"" for the design instead of being up in arms about their bullshit numbers and lack of visible progress."
shittykickstarters,3cn10s,mcnub,2,Thu Jul 9 21:40:05 2015 UTC,"I wonder how the ""22,000"" people who supposedly preordered Arist machines feel about a few Kickstarter backers deciding on the final design. Cause that totally happened."
shittykickstarters,3cn10s,bob_mcbob,5,Fri Jul 10 08:10:29 2015 UTC,"I hadn't heard of Arist before today, so I was wondering why you are all so sure it is a scam.  I did a search and now I understand.  Pretty good scam, really, because it is a  good idea for a product.  Someday, something similar will exist, but I highly doubt it will be from these guys."
shittykickstarters,3cn10s,MathildaIsTheBest,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:42:40 2015 UTC,I'm confused. Isn't their system basically a Nespresso? Like one of the machines with a built-in lattissima? How is this ground breaking?
shittykickstarters,3cn10s,The_Cheeki_Breeki,2,Thu Jul 9 18:14:22 2015 UTC,Supposedly it's a compact machine controlled by an app that allows a gazillion possibilities and customizations for your joe. It doesn't use capsules like Nespresso; you can just pour in your beans and your milk and have it however you want.  I can definitely see the appeal if this machine were possible.
shittykickstarters,3cn10s,Gusfoo,2,Fri Jul 10 03:40:43 2015 UTC,"It (claims) to be a bean-to-cup system with an internal grinder, milk heater, ""puck"" ejector, syrup dispensers and so on."

shittykickstarters,3ci8u6,Xorondras,5,Wed Jul 8 23:57:14 2015 UTC,"There is one thing very visibly missing from the video: The actual prototype. It's off screen the entire video.  As well, every interaction shown in the video is identical. That means it's not actually responding to gestures, just the presence of a touch."
shittykickstarters,3ci8u6,wackyvorlon,2,Thu Jul 9 06:13:40 2015 UTC,"just the presence of a touch   They're also identical in timing. It's a video loop, the ""touches"" are just rehearsed and for show, and not actually triggering anything."
shittykickstarters,3ci8u6,greenl2ght,28,Fri Jul 10 13:29:29 2015 UTC,"The text is so cringeworthy.    It shows that the Cicret Team is the first one and only one in the world who succeeded to combine 4 technologies which create this groundbreaking wearable device:    project with a low-angle make it work on any skin color controllable with the finger and make it work even in bright daylight    So high tech! They used the ""make it work on any skin color"" technology IN COMBINATION with the ""controllable with finger"" technology! Speaking of controllable, the lag (time delay between touching an icon and the display changing) is so long, it almost looks like they are just displaying a slideshow of images and videos and the touching is completely unrelated to the slides - no control whatsoever."
shittykickstarters,3ci8u6,exclamationmarek,27,Wed Jul 8 10:23:59 2015 UTC,"the lag   It's not lag, it's a revolutionary time dilation feature."
shittykickstarters,3ci8u6,RetardedSquirrel,25,Wed Jul 8 11:51:56 2015 UTC,It only appears to lag because of the camera shutter. It won't lag to the naked eye.
shittykickstarters,3ci8u6,Elaine_Benes_,19,Wed Jul 8 14:52:37 2015 UTC,Yep I thought it was suspicious that all the different demonstrations of it being used showed the same icons being pressed in the same order with the same timing. Pretty sure it is just playing back a prerecorded video and the users are pretending to control it.
shittykickstarters,3ci8u6,HuTheFinnMan,4,Wed Jul 8 14:40:50 2015 UTC,I'm think there's just a guy in the background clicking his mouse on a computer to go to the next image when the person holding it taps his finger.

Even if they get all the money to actually make the prototype, no way in hell is this shipping in December 2015.  Not to mention that this is all completely new technology needed to pull it off."
shittykickstarters,3ci8u6,ironplated,17,Wed Jul 8 09:30:45 2015 UTC,"Why would you even want it projected on your skin? If you're wearing some warm clothing, or even just a long sleeve top I can't see how this would work.  I just don't understand why. If it works then, yeah, cool - but the market is just people who want the latest cool tech and stop using it soon after."

shittykickstarters,3ci8u6,Kevzorage,41,Wed Jul 8 07:59:11 2015 UTC,"Well, I can believe this due to stroboscope effect. If you film a computer screen it will flicker too depending on its refresh rate and camera shutter rate."
shittykickstarters,3ci8u6,Grue,11,Wed Jul 8 10:01:51 2015 UTC,Good cameras are not necessarily better at filming screens. Actually most times you see a non-flickering screen on TV/movies it's put there in post production. There is little incentive for camera manufacturers to make cameras good att filming screens when it's such an edge case. Just because you have the moral high ground it doesn't mean you can't make stupid insults.

Anyway, he probably wants to give the app access to an always-on GPS. If you're moving faster than, say, 10km/h it doesn't let you text. Pretty simple idea and perfectly doable. The only problem is that people who text and drive won't install it. You can try to push for legislation to make it mandatory and have the app preinstalled and uninstallable on every phone but forcing people to have an always-on GPS is probably unconstitutional in every civilized country."

This is to keep the pricing artificially high, or where it should be, depending on who you ask.  The fact that anyone would fall for this says to me that they really deserve to be fleeced and taught a lesson. People are monumentally, stupendously, fucking hilariously dumb sometimes.

I was reading through their proposal and saw this ""  Currently we donât have a fully working prototype, the photos in campaign are computer renderings of what we envision the device to look like. "" That's not how making a new product works. You don't design the final product and then hope you can build prototypes that fit into that design. You create prototypes and revise them to be smaller and smaller until they fit into a design that works.  I guarantee they just drew up a design for a bracelet and said ""the projector comes out right here"" and then called it a day. Where does the battery go in that, where does any of the circuitry go.

They didn't understand the difference between a concept and a design, and took for granted that the consumer protections they get in retail stores would work in their favor.  People are generally really bad at the level of planning it takes to accomplish something like this, which means they're also bad at identifying when other people haven't done that planning.  They didn't identify that Ritot hadn't figured out where to put the battery, how to do the projection, etc. because they themselves didn't think to consider those steps.  People who are used to designing a finished thing from existing parts with physical limitations on a budget will raise an eyebrow and dig deeper, the rest are easily convinced by promises and Photoshop.  A few years and some decent press on the issue, and the general public will start to wise up to that vulnerability.

And they weren't really going out of their way to claim that they had something that they didn't.  iFind claimed that their bluetooth tag was already working when it probably wasn't.  Scribble went as far as to fake a video to make it look like their prototype was functional.  Ritot did neither.  They had an idea and wanted to try it.  I think it turned into a total clusterfuck either way, but I honestly don't think that they were trying to scam anyone.  They were just grossly incompetent and ZERO of the media coverage drew attention to that.  It's not like they paid off the media for attention.  They just produced a lot of buzz for tech news sites.

Being vague with information and going out of your way to appear further along than you are without actually directly saying so is imcompetence at best and dishonesty at worst. ""initial development"" means this protoype seen here should've been completed IMMEDIATELY after the campaign.

I mean can you really get mad at a team of people who have shown a pathetic but at least good faith effort to show progress in their development when all they did was produce a crummy video that had blatant spelling and grammatical errors?  They didn't launch some kind of diabolical global marketing campaign that forced people to open their wallets.  They haven't even advertised anywhere in fact besides their own indiegogo page.

Any guilt with the media does not absolve ritot of its fundamental sin: telling people they knew it was possible with current technology when in reality, they had no fucking idea. Anything short of ""We're going to gamble with a shitton of your money"" is reason enough to place a majority of the blame squarely on ritot.  Edit: phrasing, boom."
shittykickstarters,3c9zma,i010011010,3,Mon Jul 6 23:27:33 2015 UTC,"Sure, they're a shitty enterprise, but the reality is that they wouldn't have so much money if it wasn't for outside poorly researched media attention.   There was a project on Indiegogo a few years ago where some kid (ended up being a high schooler which was revealed after it fell apart) claimed he was going to make some cellphone with dual 1080p displays and a $250 price tag, but all he needed was $10,000.   Clearly that kid is an idiot but he wasn't malicious, and the $5k he did raise actually was returned to investors when IGG saw what was up (I think he also broke the TOS is some specific way which got their attention).  So yes, you can blame that kid for ""scamming"" people out of $5000, but if his story got picked up (pretty exciting, a top of the line smartphone for $250! Invented by a high schooler?!) he might have gotten into six digits with his fundraising. Can you blame him for that?  I know not a lot of people worked to promote Ritot because I've been following these stories forever. A lot of shitty news agencies want to cover popular projects because they get link backs to their article from the project page. They're not getting paid off, they're trying to squeeze themselves into the spotlight. The more positive stuff they say, the more likely they are to get quoted. A lot of them just copy and paste a press release (zero effort for some ad revenue) or even copy and paste copy from other reviews. We found one example where a project for a fitness tracker was quoting Men's Health magazine who was actually originally quoting the project page. It's hilarious.   There have been a lot of terribly scammy projects like iFind, Scribble, that Atlantic City Horror board game, and the Cryptex USB thing which simply evaporated without a trace. If these Ritot dudes were really out to screw people over, they would have cut and run by now.   The end result for the consumer is the same (lose money, don't get thing), but to place blame squarely on Ritot shifts it away from an entirely broken tech news environment where non technical writers are making uninformed recommendations that directly impact people's purchasing decisions. Get mad at them. The Ritot folks have already done all the damage they're going to, meanwhile buzzTechDaily or whatever is making a profit shoveling schlock with zero accountability.    I wrote about this here: http://drop-kicker.com/2013/12/kickstarter-project-creators-like-to-quote-people-who-summarize-their-words/  And here: http://drop-kicker.com/2014/02/your-fundraising-goal-is-bullshit/"

That can be as abstract as a general presentation that demonstrates that you have the requisite skills to pull something off, and how you'll be addressing the design and production process. Though crowd-funding is a different game to a degree, I think it's still a bit sleazy to intentionally skip those parts because you know people won't think to push for them.

shittykickstarters,3c9zma,Hadrosauroidea,14,Tue Jul 7 03:42:13 2015 UTC,Bigger scam: Ritot or Arist?
shittykickstarters,3c9zma,Ornafulsamee,26,Mon Jul 6 15:23:33 2015 UTC,"I'm giving it to Ritot.    The Arist machine is at least feasible.  You can make a machine that does exactly what the Arist promised to do (it's just 3 times larger and costs 5 times as much).    The Ritot watch involves a watch that projects anti-light to get the contrast it needs, and projects on a surface that's parallel to the lens (rather than perpendicular, like every other projector on the entire planet).  Using a minute battery, with all those electronics in a goddamn smartwatch.  How infeasible is the Ritot?  I'd believe that someone had designed a subdermal screen implant before I believe that the Ritot could work.  A subdermal implant just involves 3 or 4 major leaps of technology on the level of the transition from PC->Smartphone, the Ritot watch breaks the laws of physics."

shittykickstarters,3c9zma,Amadeus_IOM,10,Tue Jul 7 19:04:12 2015 UTC,"I hated the project at first but now I totally love it.  They used so much mainstream garbage stuff, like a melting pot of utterly shit many so-called designers are able to do, B&W pictures, photo with hipster, the sport side, the bullshit about the wooden texture, everything fit the current trend, they even used a picture of a woman with a macbook, they have no shame.  And then, there's this update, a big scam for all theses idiots who backed for such a shitty useless fancy watch that offers nothing more than classic watches, the people who pledged this stuff must have poor uninteresting life if they need such gadget.  It's always funny how they come with such ""innovative ideas"", while spitting on all those ""old school"" watches, the thing is, it is not even close to innovation, even if they manage to make them, those watches will only be interesting for one month, then everyone will get bored of having to charge them every day, just like their fancy smartphone.

For instance, this video spends the first full minute basically saying ""I'm going to make what's on the screen, in Illustrator"", and the last 2 minutes 15 on how to save a file, and how great it is.

If you ever need to hire a designer or a developer for anything, please do not say something like ""it's a quick, easy job - should only take 20 minutes.""  Edit for clarity:  in the case of this post, you can clearly see how the 'designer' completely neglected any research or creative process when comparing versions of the icons.

shittykickstarters,3bqwrz,ZorbaTHut,2,Thu Jul 2 08:55:47 2015 UTC,"This is one of the biggest misconceptions about kickstarter .  Just because a project is funded doesn't mean that there will be a product . There are many project are similar to this project and many other project that fail even if its funding was a success .  More often than not, these people have no experience in business and manufacturing, they probably got a quote on the project assuming that everything goes well and place the funding goal as that.  But there will always be delay and problem . For example, look at this project . https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/downwardviral/z-2  Even though it had 2 successful kickstarter and it been a few years , we have not receive any item aside from p&p version .But going through the update, the creator was upfront on how mistaken he was   and how optimistic he was initially . It is a painful lesson to everyone but this is my point .  Pre order meant that even without your help, the product will still exist and you will get it .   Kickstarter meant that most likely, with a few exception , but without your help , this product will not exist and even then, if a project was funded, the product still might not exist ."
shittykickstarters,3bqwrz,mrfatso111,2,Fri Jul 3 01:01:58 2015 UTC,"Pre order meant that even without your help, the product will still exist and you will get it .   This isn't true at all. Pre-ordered projects get cancelled all the time.  Hell, sometimes this isn't even mentioned as a pre-order - one of the things they do with made-for-tv products is advertise a product, then if they don't get enough sales to justify making it, refund everyone's money."

shittykickstarters,3bqwrz,mrfatso111,12,Fri Jul 3 01:09:09 2015 UTC,kickstarter is a donation program.  The person you give the money to has no obligation to ever give you anything.
shittykickstarters,3bqwrz,ekaceerf,9,Wed Jul 1 16:18:06 2015 UTC,"However, if they lie about how donations will be used to collect the donations, it's fraud.  (If they did R&D they claimed, ended up failing from incompetence, then lied afterwards, that's not necessarily fraud)."
shittykickstarters,3bqwrz,squidfood,2,Wed Jul 1 16:48:08 2015 UTC,Where does this theory come from? Why do you believe they have no obligation to give you anything?
shittykickstarters,3bqwrz,ZorbaTHut,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:56:14 2015 UTC,"Because that is what kickstarter is.  It would be like if I said Reddit is about posting stuff and you asked ""Where does this theory come from?""  Kickstarter is not a store front.  It is a donation page towards ideas.  Backer rewards are a suggestion of what you could possibly get as a gift by donating."
shittykickstarters,3bqwrz,ekaceerf,2,Thu Jul 2 16:42:31 2015 UTC,"No, that's not what Kickstarter is. It's a site where you give people money in exchange for goods and/or services. If you don't provide those goods and/or services you can be sued (and it's happened before).  Kickstarter's FAQ says this. There's nothing in there about it being a donation, and it's quite clear that the person running the Kickstarter is legally liable to fulfill their obligations.  I don't know where this ""kickstarter is a donation program"" fantasy came from, but as near as I can tell, it's a complete fabrication."

shittykickstarters,3bqwrz,ZorbaTHut,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:01:15 2015 UTC,That is the kickstarter misconception.
shittykickstarters,3bqwrz,ekaceerf,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:54:03 2015 UTC,"The term 'pre-order' has a very specific legal definition that entitles the consumer to legal protections.  For this reason, kickstarter is not a site for pre-orders.  It looks like and smells like a pre-order site, but is not legally for pre-orders.  Read the fine print."

Well given that CST never claimed such a thing, I should hope so.  You can find a lot wrong with this train wreck without hitching your wagon to hyperbole."
shittykickstarters,3bqwrz,derpstarter,11,Wed Jul 1 15:07:17 2015 UTC,"But they did claim this in an April 17th update on their kickstarter project page.  They even posted a picture.     Most recently, Dave has been spending almost every other week on-site. Because money is tight, Dave took the cheapest possible option for accommodations to the extreme. He rented a van from AirBNB with a futon in the back that he parks in the manufacturerâs parking lot. Itâs $35 a day, so he gets transportation and somewhere to sleep. Again, since weâre mostly working when weâre on-site, these sparse accommodations donât really matter too much, and it has allowed us to be at the manufacturerâs site more often in recent months."

shittykickstarters,3bq77u,mrfatso111,12,Wed Jul 1 07:59:17 2015 UTC,"Going to play devil's advocate here.   Though I agree that iDubbbz is coming across as cruel and insensitive mocking delusional creators who appear to be mentally disabled, and I would never take his approach, I think overall he is doing the Kickstarter community a good service.   Being disabled and/or delusional doesn't necessarily excuse someone from being a dick.    I'm betting many of us here have met or personally know many good people with mental illness or a disability who have no intent on cheating others or inflicting harm.  There are nice people who are disabled and there are jerks who are disabled.   Though I'm no expert, I'm assuming ( based on the tone of his comments and overall demeanor) that this 'Pisces' creator falls in the latter category.   And the stark truth is that we should not let our emotional connection to the creator influence our judgement of their  Kickstarter project. This is not GoFundMyass.   We have to judge projects based on their merit and validity.    Who is to say that this 'Pisces' did not intentionally try to mislead backers with a product he knows is not likely possible? Perhaps he is mainly angry because iDubbbz is exposing his scam, which he may think is his only hope of escaping his possibly shitty life with his parents.  His thinking may be no different than other normal fraudsters who devise a project to fool backers.  In his mind he may think he has a good scam going that people will believe. Cause hey, why wouldn't someone back a cybermatrix 100?   The main point is that, whether the creators iDubbbz criticizes are disabled, retarded, delusional, black, white, rich or poor, shouldn't be the focus. The focus should be on the content of their projects.   There are not enough people like iDubbbz taking measures to expose shitty kickstarters and to help clean up the site for the betterment of Kickstarter itself and trustworthy project creators.   This is low hanging fruit, but it is fruit nonetheless."

You saw the name Fang-Ying Chang then said ""I'm pretty sure she is not a native speaker""  so someone with the name Fang-Ying Chang can't be born and raised in the US and assumed to be a native speaker right? I'm guessing you don't know that there are Canadians and US natives with Chinese names from families that have been in North America for generations who don't speak Chinese.

shittykickstarters,3b28hl,SuitableDragonfly,9,Fri Jun 26 01:22:17 2015 UTC,"72 people isn't even the beginning of a fraction of a drop in the ocean of gaming. It's beyond laughable.   Even so, there's nothing wrong with criticism in any industry, but if a critic comes from a stance of anger over being unsuccessful, it's not good. Especially to real fans of games. He's basically saying ""I made a game that gamers had no interest in, so pay me to be pissy about that, and shit on the games they do like.""   I don't know about you, but that doesn't seem like a good way to do things."
shittykickstarters,3b28hl,AdvanceRatio,-5,Fri Jun 26 06:40:36 2015 UTC,"So because it's not the most popular thing in the industry, it means nobody cares?  I mean, maybe his criticism is bad, in which case, don't pay him to do it.  But 72 backers is about 72 backers more than most projects posted here get, regardless of what microcosm of human interest they're focused on.   Especially to real fans of games.   Oh, give me a break.  If you play games, if you make games, you're a fan of games.  Don't give me this shit about ""real"" fans.  It's entirely possible to have negative things to say about games and still be a fan of games.

We worked hard on presenting a gentler Tale of Tales to the public. Which basically meant that MichaÃ«l was forbidden to talk in public and Auriea often just smiled at the camera, parroting words whispered in her ears by communication coaches. Didnât make a difference.   Absolutely made a difference. Better to sell 4000 than absolutely nothing right? I get it, the guy is disappointed the game didn't sell well and he couldn't break even, but the way he's talking about the gaming community, his supporters, and the industry, seems like he just never reconciled himself to how the world works. And sheesh, you made one game that didn't do well financially but did critically! Isn't that the life of the starving artist?"

(I was busy playing a shitty game for gamers, Dark Souls.) At any rate I need to wait and clear my head before I can approach it the way it deserves.  Doess what he says about the gaming world even ring true? If games are so terrible and can't be art and successful, why is Life is Strange doing spectacularly? Why did Gone Home get GOTY? Why is Her Story getting glowing reviews? At some point you have to look honestly at your own work and not just blame the industry."

shittykickstarters,3awe9z,poorguthan,2,Thu Jun 25 23:20:01 2015 UTC,24 cups for $20 even at the higher levels. And they screwed up the $100 tier:   Three sleeves of 24 HAPPY CUPS (120 cups). Choose from 28 designs. The ultimate party pack!   I wonder what the legal ramifications of that would be? If I chose that tier would they be obligated to send me 5 sleeves for 120 cups or only 3 sleeves for 72 cups?

If 50 people came along and bought up all copies they don't just lock the ""back this project"" button either.  An eleventh person can come along and fund the rest.  It makes no sense but it's not impossible and likely not a failure in the creator's math skills.  I've never met someone who genuinely thought 50x10 was 300,000.

shittykickstarters,3an7bd,Navolas2,12,Mon Jun 22 02:50:20 2015 UTC,"So my quick napkin math; please correct me if I have made a mistake.  Iâm not a sparky, but get the basics like Ohmâs law.   To take 295ml of water and raise its temperature 70C without boiling requires 86,441 J. ( 4.186 J/g Â°C)    A joule is (1) watt/second, so to accomplish that heating in 10 minutes (600 sec) the heating element will need to output a constant 144 watts.  A bit high for a handheld battery powered device.  If we use four 3.7 volt Li-ion (14.8V) we will need to output 9.73 amps through a 1.52 ohm resisting element  to achieve the 144 watts. Sounds reasonable if it were plugged into a wall.  Now for battery life, 9.73A for .166 hours = 1615mAh.  you used 18650 batteries (avg about 2000mAh) you could have a boil and some hold time (doubtful the 6+ hours specified), but the packaging has suddenly gotten pretty bad.  I need to get (4) 18650âs (18.6mm Ã 65.2mm), some printed circuit boards, usb and charge port, 295ml cup, a heating element, etc into a cup.  That doesnât leave much room for insulation and please god, water proofing.    edit, you're also going to need very good batteries to maintain that 9.7 amp output without the unfortunate side effect of sparky fire."

shittykickstarters,3ant0w,IIoWoII,14,Mon Jun 22 01:02:35 2015 UTC,"The costs associated with developing a mobile device like this exceed their campaign goal by a factor of at least 10. You don't just throw a couple engineers at a problem like this. The development cycle for phones can take years with teams of dedicated engineers: hardware, firmware, software, mechanical, process, test, logistics, and systems. Those engineers require expensive software licenses for PCB design and layout, CAD/CAM, simulation, compilers, and test tools. The process requires iteration, because it is highly unlikely that your first spin will be successful. Every iteration requires approvals - UL, CE, FCC, etc. They will spend months finding a supply chain that can handle the complexity of manufacturing at a reasonable cost - vendors, CMs, fab houses, rapid prototyping, distributors, etc. Actually having the phone components manufactured will cost several 100s of thousands of dollars.  Let's assume that their first spin is successful and cost them a minimum of $150k. With a low average salary of ~$80k, that allows them to hire a total of maybe 10 people for a year. It might break down as:   2 HW engineers 2 FW 2 SW 2 ME 1 systems architect 1 test engineer    That leaves no room for procurement, management, admin, marketing, sales, etc. Maybe some of the employees share roles, which will increase the development time. Unless they expect slave labor. Of course anyone who knows what they're doing and can expedite the cycle is going to have a much higher salary.  So they clearly have no concept of what costs are involved and the project will likely fall because of this alone. That all ignores the challenges associated with developing something of that level of complexity. It's never been done before, and I'm to expect that a team of poorly paid engineers can do it for under $1M? Please...   This is clearly vapor ware. Source: I'm a hardware and firmware engineer."

All of the backers are listed as âAnonymousâ and were added two days ago, before the campaign was even live. The campaign is also, of course, a âflexible fundingâ campaign."
shittykickstarters,3ant0w,Hadrosauroidea,3,Mon Jun 22 02:00:11 2015 UTC,"They cover it in the FAQ:   Earlier this year Saygus launched a preorder on our own site for the V SQUARED.  Looking towards future growth, Indiegogo invited Saygus to continue offering the V SQUARED to a significant community of technology early adopters and gain additional exposure.  As Saygus moved to Indiegogo, we combined our preorder campaign with our current Indiegogo offering to show the total support of the Saygus V SQUARED.   So at least they're not hiding this bit. Or they're not now, maybe they added that after the fact.  Doesn't really matter, though. They're short about 4 or 5 MicroSD slots if they want to make this really a killer phone."

Probably two weeks worth of reading, watching, and note taking various campaigns.   Came across this guy last night, passed it out to the team, and one of our developer's backed him. Safe to assume it's a Gandalf/Golum backing, but still, how can one not support the fateful events to befall Eon, Lauren Foxx-wife, and Foxxstar-daughter from the evil doings of Eon's father Magma?   I'm pretty amazed at some of the stuff I've found up on KS. One hour of researching campaigns should be enough to clue people into the KS recipe..."
shittykickstarters,3agpx9,cr0wmium,3,Sat Jun 20 22:14:20 2015 UTC,"God, the subreddit for that game (I stalked you a bit) should be required reading for everyone that wants to kickstart a game.

shittykickstarters,3agpx9,cr0wmium,2,Sun Jun 21 17:57:32 2015 UTC,Pro ks tip: many projects that are successful get mostly funded by the creator itself. So make the goal +50% and fund that 50% yourself.
shittykickstarters,3agpx9,Dutch_X,2,Mon Jun 22 01:07:41 2015 UTC,"I think you are joking? That's actually terrible advice. First: you can't back your own project. The crowdfunding laws/banks/credit card companies consider that money laundering and will shut down your project. Secondly: funding 50% over available funds is a terrible goal - we've already sunk a bit of money into our project and we are still asking for more.   The good stat on success is pre-arrange 30% of your ask from friends/family/professionals. That leaves around a 90-95% success rate for most KS projects, regardless of size. Example is 100K ask, arrange 30-40K in funding from the 3 Fs, and then with the proper marketing you are good to go."
shittykickstarters,3agpx9,cr0wmium,2,Mon Jun 22 04:56:04 2015 UTC,"I think what he is saying is that your kickstarter budget should be a separate budget altogether .  That you should have a separate budget as well, for example, the project goal is 100k , so I have to have 100k myself to set aside , so when the project goes over the budget.  Which it will, I have some buffer which would be the 100k from kickstarter ."
shittykickstarters,3agpx9,mrfatso111,2,Tue Jun 23 00:13:56 2015 UTC,"That makes a lot more sense. As in this scenario: Joe Everyman is building a game, and has 25k is savings he is using for it. He needs 100k to build the game to a release-ready state, so he goes to Kickstarter for 100k. He then has 25k as the buffer, like you said, for when the game goes over budget.   That makes a lot more sense."
shittykickstarters,3agpx9,cr0wmium,2,Tue Jun 23 01:27:23 2015 UTC,"Too bad , mostly likely Joe would not take into account kickstarter fee, cancel pledge , so he will not get 100k , instead , he might get 80k?   Which was what happened to projects that I had back ,back in 2012, most of them did not consider any of this and toss in an small goal fueled by naive and passion . Some of them are still ongoing with the person acknowledging that the amount is too small so they are back to a full time job ,and said project will be done whenever there is time which is fine, we were young and naive back then.   Project like ""Rain"" that took the money and ran off were far and few ."

shittykickstarters,3agpx9,iamaneviltaco,3,Sun Jun 21 02:06:44 2015 UTC,From the looks of it they really bit off way more than they could chew. Those types of games have budgets in the millions of dollars not including the server fees.  These guys had little to no experience building games on that sort of scale.
shittykickstarters,3agpx9,bretris,5,Sun Jun 21 02:39:09 2015 UTC,"My hackles were immediately raised by ""MMO that costs less than 2-3 million dollars"", definitely. Granted, they didn't have to build their own engine, but still. Even failed mmos have advertising budgets bigger than their entire game.   It'd almost be worthy of a post here, if it weren't for the fact that they at least have coders that know what they're doing, and it might actually end up a real product at some point. It seriously didn't help that they pretty much launched that kickstarter within a month of CoX shutting down. The entire mindset, from what I remember, was ""We want CoX back, so let's get the fans with any smidgen of tech skills together and rebuild it!""  Doesn't help that there are also ""heroes and villains"" (a vanity project, from all indications, funded by who knows what) and ""Valiance Online"" (only pulling 34k on kickstarter) competing in the same space.  The entire genre's a bit of a mess."

shittykickstarters,3aheb5,LaunchOurRocket,7,Sat Jun 20 16:24:15 2015 UTC,It is and it's hard to tell exactly what he's doing but there is water in the diagram. The main way to separate hydrogen from oxygen in water is to pass a current through it (there may be a few more nuances but that's essentially how it's done). The main problem is the wasted energy in the conversion process. I don't remember the number exactly but it's something like 1/9th of the energy used to separate it is stored in the hydrogen so it's not very cost effective.
shittykickstarters,3aheb5,rock_hard_member,-4,Sat Jun 20 16:32:10 2015 UTC,The process is worthless. You lose precious drinkable water and electricity to produce oxygen and hydrogen gas along with some other junk you DO NOT want inside an engine or your lungs.
shittykickstarters,3aheb5,diodine,5,Sat Jun 20 20:21:08 2015 UTC,"You lose precious drinkable water   Errr... well not exactly.  Bi-products of off kilter stoichiometrics aside as soon as it's burned it's turned back into water.  Really it probably wouldn't be hard to go from H2 to H2O if you got into a pinch.  A strong enough air compressor could probably be fed into an H2 tank and water would condensate.  Don't quote me on that though, not an expert on hydrogen gas' combustion point vs energy needed to combine it with O2 to make water."
shittykickstarters,3aey0x,ntrontty,70,Fri Jun 19 16:02:40 2015 UTC,"i can imagine the development of this project. they'll slowly realize that the amount of fabric that can fit in that pouch has nowhere near the amount of surface area to slow a fall. their prototypes will gradually get bigger and bigger until they eventually develop a normal sized parachute with all the harnesses, etc. they will update their campaign description saying that they are now selling regular sized parachutes because if you're ever in a situation where you need a pocket sized emergency parachute, you're probably retarded."
shittykickstarters,3aey0x,popeyeschicken,15,Fri Jun 19 18:12:02 2015 UTC,"Well, I think they could get somewhat smaller than a standard parachute because they are built for reuse as well as a, well not a ""gentle"" landing but at least a fairly comfortable one.  If you are willing to accept single-use or limited uses, and ""probably survivable"" landing speed, then you could cut a lot of corners."
shittykickstarters,3aey0x,dWintermut3,18,Fri Jun 19 20:35:41 2015 UTC,"The size of some recreation parachutes are small enough that they wouldn't even have decent ""probable survival"" landing speed for anyone who isn't a skilled canopy pilot and they're still no where close to fitting in a pocket. Cutting corners for single use yet still survivable by an layperson would still be larger than those high performance canopies.  Unless this person plans to make some incredibly significant advances in the field of material science (which would cost a lot more than $3,000) they will never make a pocket parachute."

shittykickstarters,3adqfa,frozu,8,Fri Jun 19 07:48:17 2015 UTC,There seems to be a flaw in the card design -- with a totally green / red face on a card it will be pretty obvious from the side what color a card is. That's why custom playing cards have uniform borders / mainly white on the edges to prevent players from being able to discern the suit of the card from the side of the deck.  You can tell who's going to be getting slapped or rig the game pretty easily if you're dealing.  Also you can play this game with 4 post it notes or even a dice or even play highest card wins and the lowest gets slapped or you can just slap somebody without playing cards first.

And, using resources to vet projects and stop launches that MIGHT fund hurts them doubly.  What I think would be better is a way for the community to flag dubious projects that don't violate rules exactly, but which should be suspended until fixed.

I don't do that any more because finding interesting things in the river of crap is harder and harder.  It's not (just) that shitty kickstarters proliferating is a problem for society at large, it's that I believe in what crowdfunding could be and could do to disrupt innovation and startup culture, and I don't want to see them flush it away for some easy cash made from scammers."

KS is damaging their brand again and again as these hugely funded scams continue to be funded and continue to not deliver. I used to believe in KS as a funding platform, but I think scams like this have really poisoned the well for me and I'm going to probably not ever donate to something on the site.   The only things I would consider pledging for would be projects by well-established veterans in their field who I know will deliver the product...and at that point, if they already have a track record and they've already shipped plenty of things, I'm going to be a lot more likely to just wait for the final product to come out anyway, because I know the project will probably go ahead no matter what."
shittykickstarters,3a9nqx,Sean_May,2,Fri Jun 19 12:05:06 2015 UTC,"You make a great point about poisoning the well.  The first company in a space digs the well, so if kickstarters and scam become synonymous its not just to their detriment but also the whole idea of crowdfunding. Which I think would be tragic"
shittykickstarters,3a9nqx,dWintermut3,4,Fri Jun 19 23:41:58 2015 UTC,"It's a real shame, too, because when done correctly, crowdfunding can be an absolutely wonderful thing...but these days it seems like a lot of campaigns are either scams (the Arist coffee machine) or ways for massive corporations to gauge fan interest while simultaneously getting free money (Veronica Mars, Shenmue).  I know there are a lot of KS successes, but I think if KS doesn't do something about seriously curtailing the amount of scams and the amount of purely garbage campaigns by people who have no intention of making their product, it's going to be a sharp downhill slope for KS in the next few years, and possibly for crowdfunding in general.  I've said it before, but I think that the easiest way for KS to legitimize their platform would be to require a deposit of some sort for all campaigns...something like $100 for each $100,000 you are wanting to raise. If you really believe that you have a million dollar idea, you should have to put up $1000 of your own money before anybody gives a cent to you. If the campaign is successful, maybe KS can refund your deposit or something, but I think some kind of deposit system would greatly reduce the number of campaigns that are obviously someone with a few free minutes and access to a webcam who thinks they've come up with the next big thing."

But they let through (and leave up) so much crap now like blocks of wood or free energy that you have to wonder what they're thinking. It's like they're giving up on Kickstarter as a brand. Better to host your own now, if you don't want to be associated with all of that."

That's disrespectful and taking advantage of a horrible situation to try and convert people.  Maybe they're desperately hoping for food and to survive and have a future - maybe they turn to their own religions for hope. They don't need audio bibles, they need food and compassion."

Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.   Compassion is the key!  Why would anyone be interested in hearing the scripture of a religion that shows them no compassion?

These people are trying to essentially say to the refugees ""your Muslim faith has failed you, the only way to make your world better better is through Christianity""...which, by the way, will probably only result in creating more radical Muslims.  And if you think I'm making things up here, this is a direct quote from the pledge page:   Perhaps you've wondered how you can help make a difference in Iraq for such a dark time as this. How can you care for the oppressed and hurting? Most importantly, how can you make an eternal difference in the lives of the Iraqi people? As for all nations, the greatest need in Iraq is the gospel of Jesus Christ, and at no time are the Iraqi people more aware of the reality of life, death and eternity than now.   At best, this effort will do absolutely nothing for the people of Iraq and Syria. At worst, this will be seen as Westerners once again trying to force their religion and culture hegemony on Iraqis and Syrians...which is one of the primary motivating factors that fuels people to commit acts of terrorism.  This fundraiser is really an insult to the people of Iraq and Syria. If this group really wanted to help, they would provide refugees with actual aid that will help keep them alive, not something that passively evangelizes to them."

Again, I agree it's a bad plan but I can see the thought process."

That is absolutely shit logic."
shittykickstarters,3a84gn,Sean_May,-1,Thu Jun 18 22:49:37 2015 UTC,"Imagine this scenario- you have found out about a little known law which will give a person access to a home, spending money, food, etc. for life and all they had to do was go to a government office and request this service. You would tell everyone you knew about this, right? To an Evangelical, the idea isn't that they're being culturally insensitive, it's that they're sharing the key to eternal happiness and saving people from damnation. I am not saying that it's right or even that I agree with it, I am just saying that from their perspective I can see why they do it and that I appreciate that they feel a desire to help- even if they are likely causing more harm than good. It's easy to judge an evangelical for their behavior, but in my opinion their viewpoint makes sense. You just have to shift your mode of thinking into one that is completely different.   Another example is if Muslims were distributing copies of the Qu'ran in America. I wouldn't like it, but I have to appreciate their drive to do what they believe is right and good for their fellow people."
shittykickstarters,3a84gn,DankWeedHacker,5,Thu Jun 18 23:04:08 2015 UTC,"Imagine this. Someone tells you they can provide you with free utilities forever, yet there is no evidence that what they say is true, and there is no way to verify their claims. You've never met another person who has these free utilities, in fact nobody has. In history. Ever. This person says that those who do not participate in his program will suffer horrible fates. Again, no one in history has ever been able to witness or document these fates, or attribute misfortune to the belief or non-belief in these free utilities. This person wants your money so that they can let as many people as possible know about his wonderful program.  Â   Now imagine that there is a simple yet effective means of preventing a deadly disease that affects millions of people. Placing a $3 bed net over someone as they sleep will prevent nocturnal mosquitoes from stinging and spreading malaria. It is a method that has been studied, and when implemented it has proven to drastically reduce the cases of malaria in affected areas, and consequently deaths caused by malaria.  Â   The first person means well, and wants to spread the happiness and joy of their message. Every dollar you donate to them will make them feel better about themselves and more confident in their mission. No one will ever be able to prove that there was any effect, beyond the hopes and dreams of the people spreading the word. In contrast, every dollar you donate to provide people with bed nets will have a confirmed, verifiable impact. It has been proven, without a doubt, with no room for ambiguity, that this will save lives.  Â   The person spreading the gospel talking about free utilites is pulling money and resources away from people who are making a concrete contribution to the well being of others. That is not a behavior worthy of respect. It doesn't matter if you can understand their perspective. This person is a misguided monster, doing more harm than good. These are deplorable actions and no amount of hope or positive vibes will make up for the people that will suffer and lose their lives because they were denied access to healthcare."

Do you even know what an investment is? It's about spending money you already have in the hopes of getting out more in the end. You literally want people give you money for the sole purpose of making even more money from it.  Not for a useful product, or even some type of charity work, no, but just to lay a foundation from which you hope to profit even more from.  ""I have already saved just over $4000 of my deposit from different jobs I have done.""  That's cool. So why don't you just invest what you already have? Nope, what she earned herself is not enough, she needs to beg for more, because she's only satisfied if she can own her own holiday home.  ""I talked to Mum and Dad and after lots of discussion they set me a challenge...""you come up with the deposit and we will guarantee the other 90%""...so there it was..my challenge. I just had to come up with a way to find the rest.""  So Mommy and Daddy are already fronting the vast majority of the money required for your (more like their) ""investment"", and your way of raising the last 10% is by begging for it on the internet. Nice strategy.  ""I've come up with a series of rewards that I hope you will like  :-)"" ""I will come and work for you for an hour, several hours or a day (packing, cleaning, helping you in your business or around the house)""  Alright, at least she's willing to put some work into this, right?

shittykickstarters,3a55xt,Pavl_,6,Wed Jun 24 00:20:37 2015 UTC,"Sounds like mummy and daddy wanted her to see the value of money, by telling her to come up with $50,000 they're effectively telling her that they aren't going to give her any money, because they know she'll never have enough for a deposit."
shittykickstarters,3a55xt,Pavl_,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:55:22 2015 UTC,"Dude,  She is 17...  Yes, above the age of consent, but still."
shittykickstarters,3a55xt,ryangillam,-12,Wed Jun 17 15:07:40 2015 UTC,"So Mommy and Daddy are already fronting the vast majority of the money required for your (more like their) ""investment"", and your way of raising the last 10% is by begging for it on the internet. Nice strategy.   People seem to think that this ""fronting"" (or as she actually says, ""guaranteeing"") means that they're just giving her the money. What it actually means is that they're signing as guarantors (thus, guaranteeing) on a bank mortgage for the 90%, with this girl being responsible for raising the 10% mortgage deposit. The bank isn't going to give a 90% mortgage to a 17 year old child, but if the parents are willing to sign the paperwork they'll do the deal.  She's offering services (primarily vacation rentals) for a fee in order to raise the 10% she needs as a deposit on a house, plus insurance and so forth. I don't see what people are so upset about. She looks like a young Warren Buffett to me. And if you scoff, that only means you're not familiar with his early career."
shittykickstarters,3a55xt,Hadrosauroidea,60,Wed Jun 17 16:56:26 2015 UTC,"in fact after expenses, taxes and increasing prices it might take me 20 years to buy one!   Welcome to the real world.   I talked to Mum and Dad and after lots of discussion they set me a challenge...""you come up with the deposit and we will guarantee the other 90%""   But it's far too hard to do things like finish school and get a job so I'll just ask for money on the internet instead.  You know then sense of entitlement is strong when the parents offer to give nearly half a million dollars to help buy a house if you just come up with a deposit and you are too lazy to even work for that."
shittykickstarters,3a55xt,HuTheFinnMan,20,Wed Jun 17 18:09:03 2015 UTC,"How does she even plan on paying property taxes?   Edit: Christ, houses are expensive there too. Her goal is half the price of my damn house."

Also, I don't know how property taxes work in Aus, but in the UK its very different to the States. You are taxed once when you purchase the property (stamp-duty). After that the only taxes you pay on the property are local council taxes which are to cover civic services (having bins emptied, local police & fire etc). About as high as this goes is Â£2500 a year, but normally much less.  I'd assume the Aussie system is more like the UK than the US."
shittykickstarters,3a55xt,DEADB33F,0,Wed Jun 17 17:33:03 2015 UTC,"Nobody is going to ""give"" her nearly half a million dollars. Go ask a banker what it means to guarantee 90% of the value of a house."
shittykickstarters,3a55xt,Hadrosauroidea,5,Wed Jun 17 19:19:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know how it works where you live but in Australia the banks and other lenders are still very cautious about who they lend money to. A guarantor is an extra level of security for the lender and will allow the borrower to borrow more than they normally could and without needing a deposit. You still need to be able to prove that you can repay the loan out of your own income. No bank in Australia will give a student with no job a $375k loan even with a guarantor.  The criteria for getting a loan in Australia is the same whether you have a guarantor or not: Steady employment, clean credit, positive net assets, steady and sufficient income.  Either her parents are giving her money or they are taking a loan out in their own names."
shittykickstarters,3a55xt,HuTheFinnMan,4,Wed Jun 17 18:14:20 2015 UTC,"She's 17. You have to be 18 to take out a mortgage, so yes, I'd imagine the mortgage would be in the parents names. At least initially.  My bro ran into similar issues. He bought his first house at 17 but was too young to take out a mortgage so it was put under my parents names initially. He paid 100% of the deposit and all of the subsequent mortgage payments though.  His situation was quite different to this girl though. He wasn't particularly suited to academia so quit school at 16 and carried on at the factory job he'd had over the summer. He then worked masses of overtime while living at our folks place (with zero outgoings) to save for a deposit on the Â£50k house he ended up buying. He'd paid it off by the time he was 30, and it's Now worth Â£120k (he's now 32, so would have bought the house ~15 years ago).  He now rents it out and it generates him a supplementary income.    He wouldn't have been able to do it without the folks sticking the mortgage in their name initially though, or at least nowhere near as quickly."
shittykickstarters,3a55xt,DEADB33F,2,Wed Jun 17 23:26:53 2015 UTC,"So she is raising money for her parents to buy a house then. That certainly doesn't make the situation any better.  You are correct when you say your brothers situation is different. It sounds like he worked his ass off to buy his own home. That is the case for most people in the world, some have to work hard their entire lives to get a roof over their head unlike this girl who wants an investment property without having to do any work at all. I think you will find this is the reason most people here dislike this particular crowdfunding project, it is entirely too selfish and undeserving of charity."

I know she is only 17 and still in school so it's no surprise that she is completely oblivious to how anything in the real world works for everyone else... but damn it just makes me mad reading her bullshit.  She genuinely believes this is something that she deserves and she is earning it through hard work:   I want to make it clear I am not after a handout. This will involve quite a bit of work for me also as I will have to organise everyones bookings and travel back and forward to the house each week cleaning it between stays and washing sheets and towels, mowing lawns, organising repairs, paying bills etc. Its exhausting thinking about it...   So she does a few weeks worth of part time work in return for what is a years salary for a lot of other people as well as her parents throwing almost $400k at her.

shittykickstarters,3a55xt,DEADB33F,3,Wed Jun 17 13:03:07 2015 UTC,"180 AUD is just under Â£11 per hour. Granted, that's high for a full time job for someone that age, but if you're self-employed and only doing the occasional day or two for an individual (no guaranteed income) then I'd say it's fair.  Self-employed you'll usually expect to be paid a fair amount more that someone on a wage/salary as you have none of the benefits enjoyed by employed people (statutory holiday pay/sick pay, paid paternity/maternity leave, you also have to file your own accounts which can involve costs, etc).   As such you have to build in these allowances into your quoted contract price / day-rate.    Really though, the 5km distance limit is the biggest WTF factor. Even at her age when I only had a push-bike to get to work I used to cycle much further than that.  If she's trying to come across someone who's a go-getter, then stuff like stating that she's unwilling to work more than 5km from home isn't going to help her cause."
shittykickstarters,3a55xt,gibusyoursandviches,3,Wed Jun 17 15:14:12 2015 UTC,"I feel like the price gauge is mostly because she comes from a well-off family so she doesn't quite understand the value of a dollar.

shittykickstarters,3a55xt,DEADB33F,3,Wed Jun 17 16:24:57 2015 UTC,"Possibly, although Australia's minimum wage is quite high, at nearly $17 AUD (13 USD/Â£8.20), so that may also have a part to play in it.  ...and as I say, as self-employed you'd want more than that to make up for the loss of employee benefits (paid time off, lack of regular work, etc).

However making only one reward a holiday and making it full price peak season? Valuing your unskilled labour at $180 a day? I don't think so.  Edit: oh it is fixed funding. Still daft."
shittykickstarters,3a55xt,RockAndNoWater,13,Wed Jun 17 23:37:22 2015 UTC,"This actually seems pretty reasonable on the surface, though I don't know enough about rental rates in her area to tell if the rewards are worthwhile. She should have put more information about her budget, loan payments, and expected revenue from leasing out the house (rates and vacancy projections), but otherwise it seems like a pretty reasonable project.  I disagree with everyone saying she is ""entitled"", she is soliciting funds for an investment, though she is offering stays rather than equity. Many people make money using other people's money, that's what leveraging is, and she is putting in some of her own money so she is sharing in the risk. You can argue about the value of the rewards, but I don't think the project is bad in principle."
shittykickstarters,3a55xt,AuraTummyache,5,Wed Jun 17 17:23:33 2015 UTC,"Yea, I was torn on this one.  It seemed a little sketchy to me that out of 11 weeks only 1 is given to charity, which I think is the whole hook behind funding it.  But then I realized that making a profit is kind of the whole point of kickstarter and indiegogo, no one really has to get anything out of it but you.  I do think it's a pretty good idea.  But I'm also guilty of the knee jerk reaction that this was bullshit.  Maybe it's a little too much profit and not enough charity for people though, we'll have to see."
shittykickstarters,3a55xt,SirHumphryDavy,8,Wed Jun 17 13:43:12 2015 UTC,I think the idea of crowdfunding is ridiculous. If you are a business and are going to making money using the money I invested than I want equity.
shittykickstarters,3a55xt,AuraTummyache,4,Wed Jun 17 14:54:51 2015 UTC,"That's a really good point actually.  The whole idea of crowdfunding is that a lot of people can each give a little bit of money towards a large goal in order to get rewards rather than equity.  Instead of an individual investor, who would put a lot of money in for a part of the company.  That might be why this kickstarter is shitty, because there are no real rewards.  Unless you want the girl to do temp work for you or you plan on being in Australia any time soon.  She might actually have better luck with an investor now that you mention it.  I could see someone wanting a cut of the steady rental profits while also being able to write of taxes for charity.  Or however Australian tax codes work, I don't even really have a firm grasp on how American taxes work."

shittykickstarters,3a55xt,HuTheFinnMan,5,Wed Jun 17 17:53:30 2015 UTC,"You're wrong. You don't know how mortgage lending works in australia. Having a guarantor doesn't guarantee someone will get a loan. As you say it is an ordinary mortgage and as such she needs to pass certain criteria to get a loan, criteria she doesn't meet such as having a job.  A guarantor is extra security for the lender and often means you can borrow more money than you normally could or get a house loan without needing a deposit. You can't be a highschool student with no assets and no job and borrow $375k with no way to repay it just because you have a guarantor.  The only plausable situation here is either her parents are in fact giving her money or the parents are taking the home loan out in their names."
shittykickstarters,3a55xt,Hadrosauroidea,0,Wed Jun 17 17:58:47 2015 UTC,"You're wrong. You don't know how mortgage lending works in australia. Having a guarantor doesn't guarantee someone will get a loan. I'd be wrong if that is what I said, so it's lucky for me I didn't say that.   A guarantor is someone the bank will accept to help secure the mortgage. In this case, a guarantor is legally required because this girl is below the age required to enter into a contract. It has nothing to do with not needing a deposit, and you can't get a mortgage without a downpayment.  Effectively what is happening is that her parents will be taking on the mortgage, but she is taking on the responsibility of paying it off. If that amounts to ""giving"" her money, well then every bank who writes a mortgage ""gives"" the homebuyer money too. Isn't that nice of them."
shittykickstarters,3a55xt,HuTheFinnMan,2,Wed Jun 17 23:32:33 2015 UTC,Again you're wrong and you still don't know how mortgage lending works in australia. One of the benefits of having a guarantor is in fact that it let's you borrow over 100% of the value of the house. You most certainly can get a mortgage in australia with no deposit if you have a guarantor.  Here is a link with information on guarantor home lones from Australian banks. Literally the first thing it says is that it is an option for a no deposit home loan: http://abcmortgages.com.au/guarantor-home-loan-nab/  It also goes on to explain the eligibility requirements which this girl doesn't meet such as having a job.  It's frustrating to see you jump into this thread and continually post factually incorrect information. I tried patiently to explain to you why you are wrong yet you continue to respond with even more wrong information and changing your argument rather than admit you made a mistake. At this point I don't see any reason to engage with you further.
shittykickstarters,3a55xt,Hadrosauroidea,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:33:12 2015 UTC,"Okay, so you've got one point; if you deal with people like ABC Mortgages, ""THE LO DEPOSIT KINGS"" you can get a mortgage without a deposit. I thought even Australia shitcanned that stuff after the GFC, but apparently you're just a little crazier than everyone else down there. So yes, that's one purpose of a guarantor. It's not the only one, though.  There are many possible reasons why a bank may require a guarantor. The fact that this girl is too young to sign a legally binding contract would qualify as a pretty good reason. Technically the bank (or even THE LO DEPOSIT KINGS) probably wouldn't let her sign off on any paperwork for that exact reason, so what would really be happening is that her parents would be taking out the mortgage and (perhaps) putting her name on the property title. Presumably, at least one of them has a job.  Look, my whole point of getting into this discussion was to point out that this campaign is clearly for the purpose of raising money for the downpayment on a house, the rest of which will be covered by a mortgage. Suggesting that her parents are ""giving"" her 90% of a house is stupid.  Feel free to not engage with me further, though, if you still want to maintain that they're simply giving her all that cash. Wouldn't want to have to admit you were wrong about something."

shittykickstarters,3a55xt,ArmadX,3,Thu Jun 18 06:30:09 2015 UTC,"Wait wait wait, she has 90% of the money for the house already, as well as 10% of the deposit.  So that'd be 91% of total amount, and if she can get her hands on 91% of the cost of a house, I don't see why she'd need any help getting the other 9%  And why does she need to rent out the place if she already has 90% covered?"
shittykickstarters,3a55xt,DEADB33F,2,Wed Jun 17 14:50:57 2015 UTC,"It's fairly simple...   She wants to buy a holiday let for 400k AUD She has 1% saved toward the deposit Her parents have offered to guarantor the mortgage if she can raise the other 9% of the deposit.   You need to be 18 to take out a mortgage without a guarantor, and even if you're over 18 you'd need two years of accounts in order to get a mortgage as a self-employed person (which she'd be if she's letting the place out as a holiday home).  The parents aren't giving her any money, they're just promising to take the credit hit if the daughter defaults on the mortgage."

shittykickstarters,3a55xt,DEADB33F,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:54:28 2015 UTC,"I don't have a problem with this at all. In fact I think it's great.  As far as I can see she's taking early-bookings for a holiday let and is using the early booking fees to pay the deposit on the property.  Stuff like this happens all the time in business. Most businesses are started with other people's money. Either through a bank loan which is eventually paid back from business profits, from investors who are paid back the same, or by taking early orders for goods that don't yet exist then using the money raised to fulfill those orders.  ...The last one is basically what nearly all kickstarter / indigogo projects are (including this one).  She's basically agreeing to let strangers live in her house for two years in order to cover the deposit on her mortgage (it's not mentioned, but I'm guessing she'll be living with her parents during periods where the house is let to holidaymakers).     In any case,  as a holiday-let the price she's charging seems quite reasonable... 7 nights rental of a three bedroom house works out at Â£15 per-person per-night during peak season, dropping to Â£11 PPPN off-season ...assuming you fill it.  The B&B nightly rate is just for a couple (staying at her parents house) and works out less than Â£25 a night and includes dinner. That's doesn't seem like a bad rate for a B&B either.  I don't know what the normal holiday-let / B&B prices are like in that area, but they at least seem reasonable to me based on what I know of the UK market.    I see this as a young person looking to get on the property ladder early in life and who is giving people very reasonable holiday-let rates in return for help raising the required deposit. If it works I wish I'd have thought of it."

So I started thinking, what can I do to protect my information when my cellphone is in the hands of others or when my phone is sitting down. That was the driving force behind the idea. So, I created blackout.""  I would have learned my lesson by not sharing a device that holds sensitive information anymore - not by building an app, but that's just me..."

Apps in iOS are essentially sandboxed, they can't easily interact with other apps other than shuttling some data between them (like downloading a PDF in Dropbox and opening it in the Kindle app or something)...but apps can't just arbitrarily have root-level access to do things like prevent them from launching or blocking their features."

Children these days are spoiled. I never had a smart device until high school. Nowadays, i see children in elementary school running around with their iPhone 6 and swearing up a storm.  Solution 2: don't let them take smart phones to school,  Solution 3: just buy them a tablet, and give them a basic flip phone.

shittykickstarters,3a8ctn,arahman81,5,Thu Jun 18 02:08:38 2015 UTC,I doubt it cost $2 million to make a game that previous cost $67 million.
shittykickstarters,3a8ctn,mrv3,5,Thu Jun 18 13:01:24 2015 UTC,"It only cost $67 million because they built it from the ground up. Today, they have existing engines and technology. It would cost more than $2 million, but nowhere near $67 million."
shittykickstarters,3a8ctn,alexalexthehuman,4,Thu Jun 18 15:33:04 2015 UTC,"But the rising cost of game developement, and voice acting would offset the saving.

shittykickstarters,3a8ctn,mrv3,4,Thu Jun 18 15:37:55 2015 UTC,"Also, let's be honest, Sony is only doing it to gauge fan interest. Like ""if this gets $2 mil from fans, we'll invested the 10/20/30 mil into it to make it"". And I'm okay with that. it's like a focus group. Where Sony gets $2 mil.  And yeah, I'm thrilled about this being made. I remember being so excited about Shenmue II when I was in middle school."
shittykickstarters,3a8ctn,alexalexthehuman,4,Thu Jun 18 15:40:30 2015 UTC,"Exactly, from an industry stand point telling if people actually want Shenmue 3 was damn near impossible. It was released on a dying console, so does the mainstream know of it? is it just a small but very vocal fanbase(like those No Mutant Allowed fucks)? Do people really want it or just say they do because of the circlejerk?  Having people put money straight in allowed them to instantly greenlight the project and go ""yep"" and hopefully we might see a great story come out of this."
shittykickstarters,3a8ctn,mrv3,2,Thu Jun 18 15:43:47 2015 UTC,"The more I read about this, the more it looks like a PR stunt, and that alone makes it /r/shittykickstarters worthy IMO."

From Sony's perspective it was hard to know if it's 1 million people wanting this or 10,000 loyal fans.  The kickstarter showed them that there is genuine interest."
shittykickstarters,3a8ctn,mrv3,7,Thu Jun 18 13:02:51 2015 UTC,"I find it very hard to believe that Sony, an enormous multinational that spends millions on research and marketing and holds decades of data, needed kickstarter to determine whether the project was viable, or that they would have promoted it at E3 without already having committed to the project."

Seems like Kickstarter would have a rule against that.  edit: Here's a screenshot of what their project currently looks like in case they change it.  edit 2: it's now appearing as an actual staff pick, which IMO is even worse than them faking it since it confirms that Kickstarter has looked over this blatant scam of a project and decided not to take it down."
shittykickstarters,3a1jyk,TinyEarl,5,Tue Jun 16 18:17:05 2015 UTC,"According to the article they were Staff Pick at one stage, but it was revoked."
shittykickstarters,3a1jyk,DankWeedHacker,5,Wed Jun 17 03:36:19 2015 UTC,I'm not seeing anything that says they were a confirmed staff pick. I think the person who wrote the article just saw the seal and assumed it wasn't fake.
shittykickstarters,3a1jyk,TinyEarl,6,Wed Jun 17 03:55:16 2015 UTC,I can't believe faking a staff pick badge is not grounds for immediate suspension / cancellation.
shittykickstarters,3a1jyk,bretris,2,Wed Jun 17 12:58:03 2015 UTC,They probably suspended the Staff Pick pending investigation. The Holus team silently removed a lot of their claims from the page and video (the CGI is gone). I can't believe they did it willingly. It is possible they found an agreement with Kickstarter. Damage is done anyway.

shittykickstarters,3a1jyk,Beebou,-10,Wed Jun 17 02:14:21 2015 UTC,"From that website, it seems that based on Arist's makers' own timeline, they haven't reached the shipping stage yet. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt until they completely disappear and stop giving updates at all, which hasn't happened yet. Also, the website you linked is eerily similar to r/conspiracy, and given that it's the only source I found upon Googling ""Arist coffee machine scam"" that suggested it was indeed a scam, I don't buy it."
shittykickstarters,3a1jyk,HuTheFinnMan,11,Wed Jun 17 02:49:54 2015 UTC,"Ok. Either you do already know about Arist and you are trying to not so subtly defend it, or you really don't know anything about it and you are ""giving them the benefit of doubt"" with absolutely no reasoning at all other than to have an argument on the internet.  Specifically googling ""Arist coffee machine scam"" comes up with multiple sources questioning the legitimacy of the arist kickstarter, so don't be dishonest. There is far more to this other than whether they deliver anything at all."

I've shot Holograms before at the Impact Center at UofT, ive done a few till date and the principle is the same as its always been, light waves hit a holographic film that has a standing wave (imprint) and the light reconstructs the image in front of the plate or behind. Its a one time record-once read many times thing so what they are doing is DEFINITELY not holography!!! They are using it as a catch word for getting attention.  To make a dynamic hologram would be extremely difficult, a lot of very experienced firms are researching into this and few have even come up with anything promising.

From the Kickstarter TOS:   You can increase, decrease, or cancel your pledge at any time during the campaign, with one exception. During the last 24 hours of the campaign, you canât decrease or cancel your pledge without contacting customer support first â if that action would drop the project below its funding goal. Once the project has been funded, you can only cancel or change your pledge by making special arrangements directly with the creator.

We are using default drone shells to do tests with our custom drone pcb board. We are planning on having the product produced in China. There are two options to choose from in terms of the creation of the shells, injection moulding or 3D-printing. If we do decide  to use 3D-printing, we will have to see how fast these drone shells can be made, to ensure delivery to our customers in a timely fashion.  The other option would be to use injection moulding which would ensure quick manufacturing of our product, however it would increase costs as well as limit our customization capabilities. However we are looking out for our customerâs best interest, so we will update you as soon as we have any updates on our method of production.

shittykickstarters,39v5af,SuitableDragonfly,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:46:38 2015 UTC,Due to irregular bands we don't use TVs.  Often slow scan TV is done through PC software.  A phone could likely decode SSTV.  Android tablet taped to a 5W radio and you could probably do city wide SSTV.  Although there are better modes to transmit images frankly.  I never can keep all the digi modes straight in my head but we have a few that can transmit data/text and then without missing a beat throw an image on the end which is decoded and displayed by the client.  These modes would be much more solid with poor signal quality than SSTV.

shittykickstarters,39v5af,evildead4075,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:17:16 2015 UTC,"IP over Avian Carriers:       In computer networking, IP over Avian Carriers (IPoAC) is a humorously-intended proposal to carry Internet Protocol (IP) traffic by birds such as homing pigeons. IP over Avian Carriers was initially described in RFC 1149, a Request for Comments (RFC) issued by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) written by D. Waitzman and released on April 1, 1990. It is one of several April Fools' Day RFCs.  Waitzman described an improvement of his protocol in RFC 2549, IP over Avian Carriers with Quality of Service (1 April 1999). Later, in RFC 6214 released on 1 April 2011, and 13 years after the introduction of IPv6, Carpenter and Hinden published Adaptation of RFC 1149 for IPv6.   IPoAC has been successfully implemented, but for only nine packets of data, with a packet loss ratio of 55% (due to user error),  and a response time ranging from 3000 seconds (~54 minutes) to over 6000 seconds (~1.77 hours). Thus, this technology suffers from poor latency. Nevertheless, for large transfers, avian carriers are capable of high average throughput when carrying flash memory devices, effectively implementing a sneakernet. During the last 20 years, the information density of storage media and thus the bandwidth of an avian carrier has increased 3 times faster than the bandwidth of the Internet.  IPoAC may achieve bandwidth peaks of orders of magnitude more than the Internet when used with multiple avian carriers in rural areas. For example: If 16 homing pigeons are given eight 32Â GB SD cards each, and take an hour to reach their destination, the throughput of the transfer would be 9102Â Mbit/s, excluding transfer to and from the SD cards.    Image i - A homing pigeon can carry Internet Protocol traffic.

I didn't see anywhere that they said they had already finished the project, in fact they explicitly said they hadn't and would be using the money to fund the costs of making it.  The team is experienced, having produced work for national broadcast networks and even having won an Emmy.  The trailer is entirely competently shot and edited, so they obviously have the ability to produce this.  $50,000 is an unbelievably small amount of money to produce a feature length film, it's hardly like they are asking for a ridiculous amount of money.  From the trailer it looks like something I'd actually be interested in watching, as I'm sure other people would, I mean look at the coverage this has already got in mainstream media, it's clearly of interest to a lot of people.   This isn't in any way a shitty Kickstarter, in fact it seems like a particularly good, realistic and professional one, OP just posted it as he is presumably politically opposed to the views of the filmmaker."

shittykickstarters,39odg0,SiliconWrath,26,Sat Jun 13 05:32:43 2015 UTC,"Are they really this dumb, or is this a deliberate scam. They even provide the measured power output (in the FAQ section):   The maximum mW output of this device is 36mW for a typical duration of 56 milliseconds on the WiFi connection during active downloading. It is a pulse charge that repeats roughly every 120 milliseconds.   It's math time!  36mW pulse that lasts 56 milliseconds every 120 milliseconds. Those sound like reasonable numbers, I'll assume them to be a true, best case scenario.  56ms every 120ms, so that means it's providing power during:  56 / 120 = 47%   during 47% of the time. The power is 36mW, so in average, this case provides the phone with:  36mW * 47% = 17mW.   A whopping 17mW. For comparison, the tiny AC adapter you get with an iPhone outputs 5W, or 5000mW. This Nicola phone case provides 294 times less power.  This means that this case when installed on a phone that downloads large files constantly for 5 hours will deliver as much energy as you'd get from connecting to the charger for ONE MINUTE  And all this is assuming that having the case on the phone doesn't increase the power consumption of the RF circuits in the first place - obscuring the signal with energy harvesting antennas will likely force the phone to set a higher transmit power and drain the battery much faster.

If phone manufacturers wanted to stop wasting energy from radio transmissions they would turn down the power. They set it to what it is to maintain a strong connection as much as possible. By harvesting this power you will destroy your wireless range. Furthermore, if the tower is receiving a weak signal, it will instruct the device to boost its signal strength to maintain a connection. This will kill your battery even faster.  You'd be better off with a battery pack."

They've included ""up to"" waffle wording there and no minimum numbers, but a 30% decrease in battery consumption smells an awful lot like bullspec.  This product is obvious crap.

The Holus is essentially triangular panes of glass, a projector and an iPad dock. What's the resolution/brightness of the projector? Impossible to say; virtually all of their video/images look like mockups.  Let's say it's an HD projector then (which I doubt).

It is 4 different camera views (front, left, right, back) projected onto 4 panes of glass that gives the illusion of it kinda sorta floating in space. The effect is broken as soon as you move away from looking directly at either of the 4 sides. It doesn't offer smooth 360 degree views, just 4 seperate views. You can actually see in the videos some camera shots show how poorly it looks at an angle although they do try to be careful not to move the camera. It would also work very poorly in anything other than a darkened room.  Not to mention all the added marketing woo where they talk about how it improves memory and health and human interaction and probably cures cancer as well. As a bonus they offer a headband thing that proports to read your brain signals so you can control things with your mind.  It looks like a serious project and they have working examples.

Here's a possible report message:   H+ Technologyâs presents a âHolographic Displayâ supposed to offer a â3D holographic experienceâ.  The Holus video is using CGI to make it appear like the Holus can display volumetric content providing depth cues and parallax (in particular at the 0:50 and 0:58 mark). This is in clear violation of the rules of the Kickstarter platform concerning photorealistic renderings. These renderings donât reflect the actual limitations of the product as made clear by this other video from the project creators: https://vimeo.com/130601555  More information can be found in the following articles:  Part 1: https://medium.com/p/c12a861cb8bf  Part 2: https://medium.com/p/6bd4a70d7d9e

shittykickstarters,39gazm,otidder,3,Fri Jun 12 01:21:20 2015 UTC,What ever happened to wage garnishing?
shittykickstarters,39gazm,tornato7,23,Fri Jun 12 00:34:15 2015 UTC,"If it can be shown the kickstarter was actually a scam from the start, then this sounds OK to protect from liars and frauds. I hope they don't go after the projects that set out with legitimate goals but are in the end unable to accomplish them (due to lack of funds, talent, etc.). Kickstarting isn't buying a product or guarantee of success - that's why there's a section for risks. Sometimes projects fail to deliver and though it sucks for the backers, I don't feel there's any reason to penalize the people behind the project any more than failing their goal already has. Seems like kicking a dead horse at that point."
shittykickstarters,39gazm,Nephatrine,20,Thu Jun 11 18:31:51 2015 UTC,"In this instance they got him because he demonstrably spent the funds on his rent and moving expenses and other projects, not the actual work he was meant to do. So I wouldn't worry about this being a dangerous precedent."
shittykickstarters,39gazm,arechsteiner,14,Thu Jun 11 21:14:05 2015 UTC,"I think people are aware it's not a ""guarantee of success"". However, like in ordinary investing, the project owners do owe good faith to their backers. Imagine you drew up some business idea, convinced an investor to give you $100k, and then just took the money and ran off. Pretty much fraud isn't it? I don't see why crowdfunding should be handled any differently.  The problems with crowdfunding:   Platforms like Kickstarter/Indiegogo are only interested that the project payments go through and they can take their cut Backers loose rather small investments ($10-$1000), which are not worth mounting a legal battle for. Organizing a joint-effort between wronged backers is again effort that is probably not worth the lost amount of money Numerous small backers do not have the sort of insight into the project as a large investor in a company would have   So having some regulations and enforcement on a higher level does sound like a good idea."
shittykickstarters,39gazm,loki_racer,3,Thu Jun 11 21:40:59 2015 UTC,"The terms of use on Kickstarter clearly state that the campaign must deliver rewards or refund.  This is a contract that the campaign creator agrees to.  People can't just walk away from that.   When a project is successfully funded, the creator must complete the project and fulfill each reward.   I'm tired of people peddling the crap that Kickstarter isn't a shop.  I agree, it's not a shop.  There however rules to using it."
shittykickstarters,39gazm,arechsteiner,6,Thu Jun 11 21:26:12 2015 UTC,"I'm all for punishing fraudsters but this sounds like the wrong end of the spectrum to be honest.   What if your project fails for legitimate reasons? If you're obliged to either succeed or refund all the money, then you might as well take out a bank loan."
shittykickstarters,39gazm,loki_racer,2,Thu Jun 11 21:49:43 2015 UTC,"They are taking out loans, albeit small amounts from lots of lenders/backers.  Either backers are investors or we are customers.  Many people, including /u/Nephatrine would like us to be neither.  Campaign creators need to think long and hard about their campaigns before putting them on Kickstarter.  If they aren't confident that they will succeed, then they need to find funding with a bank."
shittykickstarters,39gazm,arechsteiner,6,Thu Jun 11 21:55:26 2015 UTC,"I think you're confusing loans and investments here. An investor knowingly risks loosing their investment, but also stands the chance of multiplying it if the business succeeds. However if it doesn't, the investment is lost without ""refunds"".  If you buy Apple stock today and they go bust tomorrow, you're not going to see your money again, and that's the way it's meant to be.  You can think for as long and for as hard as you want about your project, in the end there's is always going to be the risk that it simply does not work out for a myriad of reasons.   I believe crowdfunding is meant to distribute that risk among many people, as opposed to traditional investing, where it would be few investors providing the initial funding. The key difference is that crowdfunding backers do not get to own part of the business and therefore have no way of adequately getting a return on their investment - but in my opinion that is just a bad deal they're accepting and does not change the underlying concept of carrying part of the risk."
shittykickstarters,39gazm,loki_racer,0,Thu Jun 11 22:33:40 2015 UTC,I think you're confusing me with someone else.  I never said backers are investors.  I say they are customers because Kickstarter clearly states that rewards must be delivered or refunds provided.
shittykickstarters,39gazm,HuTheFinnMan,3,Thu Jun 11 22:36:41 2015 UTC,"You literally said backers are either investors or customers in your post above.  Further above you also said people are talking crap when they say kickstarter isn't a store, then in the very next sentence you said you agree that it isn't a store.  I'm not trying to make fun of you here but you really need to stop and have a think about what your point is before you type. You may have a good point but unfortunately what you are writing doesn't make much sense."
shittykickstarters,39gazm,loki_racer,2,Thu Jun 11 22:49:06 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I see the confusion of my statements.  What I'm saying is that Kickstarter is not a shop.  Backers aren't buying a product that's ready to be put on the shelf.  That doesn't mean they aren't buying something.  Rewards or reunds must be delivered according to the terms of use that the campaign creators agree to.  I agree that backers are essential micro-financiers.  Backers allow campaigns to pitch a larger audience and ask for less funds from each person instead of the traditional method of finding funding via a single pitch to a large bank or VC group.  We aren't investors because Kickstarter's terms of use has protections in place that should stop campaigns from taking our cash and splitting.  We aren't investors because we don't get any ownership of the campaign or company.  I'm tired of people crying out ""Kickstarter isn't a store"" because it's a shitty defense for shitty campaigns."
shittykickstarters,39gazm,HuTheFinnMan,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:56:07 2015 UTC,"Ah yes I see what you are saying, that does make much more sense.  Ignoring the kickstarters which are outright fraud/scams, the majority of problems come from tying the reward tiers to the success of the project. You are correct when you say that rewards are meant to be guaranteed and thats where the problems come from.  The campain creators are using the final product as a reward to try and get more people to back the project. There is then a heavy expectation that the product is produced exactly as described and within a certain timeframe. And thats when things turn to shit.  Products end up not having the promised features or being delivered late or not at all because the people running the project often underestimate the difficulty and cost of what they propose.  It's just a big mess and honestly I feel like kickstarter are partly to blame for allowing products to be offered as a reward, demanding that the rewards be guaranteed, but doing nothing to make sure the project itself is realistic or the people running it capable of doing what they claim.  The project creators are also at fault for being overly ambitious, and often ignorant and commiting to things that they can't deliver.  Then the backers themselves must also take some blame for contributing money in the hope of something that is usually nothing more than an idea in someone elses head.  Reading the history and some of the information on kickstarter it seems like it originally was meant for supporting mostly artistic and creative projects. Things like people making a short movie and putting it on youtube for people to watch for free. Or someone putting on a free display of their artwork. Things that are easily achievable and don't promise creating a product that has to meet certain technical, manufacturing, cost and timelines. The influx of tech products and the like seems to have caused a lot of problems that the rules and structure of kickstarter was never designed to handle."
shittykickstarters,39gazm,arechsteiner,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:56:08 2015 UTC,"I never said backers are investors.   No you did not. In fact, that is what I am saying. They are investors primarily, customers secondarily, and loan-providers not at all.  Also, as far as terms of use go, you're nitpicking one line and omitting the parts that relativize it. The terms of use also state:   At the same time, backers must understand that when they back a project, theyâre helping to create something new â not ordering something that already exists. There may be changes or delays, and thereâs a chance something could happen that prevents the creator from being able to finish the project as promised.    This addresses your view of backers being customers. No, you're not a customer pre-purchasing a product. You're footing the bill and maybe you're getting the end result as a reward - if it worked out.   If a creator is unable to complete their project and fulfill rewards, theyâve failed to live up to the basic obligations of this agreement. To right this, they must make every reasonable effort to find another way of bringing the project to the best possible conclusion for backers   Bring it to the ""best possible conclusion"" does not exactly mean the same thing as ""you owe me every penny I've ever given you"".   A creator in this position has only remedied the situation and met their obligations to backers if:    ... they offer to return any remaining funds to backers who have not received their reward (in proportion to the amounts pledged), or else explain how those funds will be used to complete the project in some alternate form.    This does not mean all backers have a right to get a full refund. It means that the funds that haven't been blown get refunded, and that backers who have not received their rewards are being preferred. That is quite a different meaning of how you portrayed it."
shittykickstarters,39gazm,loki_racer,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:02:48 2015 UTC,"Look up a straw man argument.  I never said   ""you owe me every penny I've ever given you"".   or   full refund   In all the stuff you quoted, you ignored all the important parts that require campaigns to prove where funds were spent and that a best effort was made to fulfill rewards.  Campaigns that fail never provide this information.  You know why?  Because with it, backers would be able to use it in civil suits.  No, it's much easier to just tell backers to go pound sands.  That's the crux of the matter and why we even have this sub."
shittykickstarters,39gazm,arechsteiner,2,Thu Jun 11 23:05:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to put words in your mouth, and you're right, you never explicitly stated ""full"" refund. That is just how I understood your initial statement:   The terms of use[1] on Kickstarter clearly state that the campaign must deliver rewards or refund.   I only quoted things regarding the idea ""reward or refund"" (assuming ""full refund"").   Providing information as to how the funds were spent is of course an important part of the terms that should be enforced. I don't disagree with that at all."
shittykickstarters,39gazm,loki_racer,0,Thu Jun 11 23:20:23 2015 UTC,What....wait....now what will we argue about?  I want a refund on this argument.  Civil discourse for the win.
shittykickstarters,39gazm,throwaway4arist,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:23:46 2015 UTC,"No, it's a straightforward contract (as with almost all transactions), with 'consideration' needed on both sides . The law is clear on this. In this instance, the consideration from the backer is a promise of funds (which they would have paid on closing date), and the consideration from the project is a promise to deliver the reward (which they have yet to deliver). The reward in this case may have some changes, due to the nature of this transaction, but that's well within how contracts work. In the past, you have parties buying and selling items by post, items that may only have been described in a few words. The law allows for a certain amount of ambiguity in this case, as it is clear to both parties that the final reward may not be exactly what was portrayed. But that doesn't remove the obligation for the project to deliver the reward. Whether the final reward is up to the standard required or not is a very tricky question. This may need to be resolved by the courts.  This distinction is an important one, as if you are giving money to a party with no specific expectation of getting something back, then it is a gift. For KS, it is clear that it's a contract, it's just that what you are getting back is a bit more ambiguous than buying something from a supermarket."
shittykickstarters,39gazm,ilostmybeef,-1,Fri Jun 12 08:28:11 2015 UTC,"If people are required to deliver rewards then it would seem a huge problem here is that people are offering the proposed final product as part of the reward system.  Kickstarter isn't a shop. That isn't crap, it's the truth, albeit a truth people keep twisting to weasel out of things. Backers should accept that funding something is no guarantee of a product. However, the people asking for funds should also then stop offering the final product as a reward when there are no guarantees that they will be able to deliver. Only offer rewards you know you can follow through on."

I already thought when this was originally posted here that it is a train wreck what with the ridiculous promotional video, the bouyant comedy fins and other questionable specifications, and then the interesting and eclectic group of people on the team.  We have an Indian inventor who alegedly designed the phone teamed up with a Canadian martial arts expert who wrote a book on astro physics and cosmology as a CEO, receiving legal advice from a British venture capitalist and marketed by a German who claims to have strong ties with Saudi royal families.

Usually they just become a silent partner in name only. That's how the locals make money without doing much work. It's only a few times the usual amount for a normal local and there's quite a number of Sheikhs and royals here so they're not hard to meet. They make no personal losses in the venture if it goes south since they get the money end of the day without investment, and there's no requirement for them to invest financially nor is it common.  Having good connections or just having that person's name in your company will make it easier to do business simply because of the wasta involved.  But scammy businesses like these are pretty common here, and he may have the background he claims in place, just it has nothing to do with end result of the service/product."

shittykickstarters,3959p7,exclamationmarek,23,Tue Jun 9 10:23:09 2015 UTC,"This just screams ""wet dream of misinformed amateur"".  Having a 100Wh battery for a camera is cool but everything else in this project is just horrible.  A solar panel? At this size it looks like it could output a peak power of a whopping 2W, which translated to charging that internal battery by 5% after 4 hours of being perfectly perpendicular to the sun at noon on a cloudless day.  Charging from USB? Let's do the math here. A standard computer USB port (like the one shown in their video) outputs 500mA. They have 10 cells of 2800mAh to charge. Given an optimistic 90% charge-discharge efficiency, that's still 31,100 Ah to charge, or sllightly over 62 hours of charging. Even from a beefy 2.1A tablet charger that's still 15 hours.  The light in front is so close to the lens it would be significantly covered by it. It's so awkwardly placed, that even in their own video the operator covers it with it's hand in most shots.  And I honestly have no clue how did they managed to get such a noisy recording from the Zoom H4n field recorder they compare their audio tech to. They say that by using their solution you save ""hours of syncing audio to video"", but you can connect the very Zoom H4n they show in exactly the same way! But nobody does that since every video editing application I saw has a way to automatically synch video and audio that literarily takes two clicks and a 20 seconds of waiting.  This is just utter rubbish."

shittykickstarters,3959p7,PabloAr,2,Tue Jun 9 15:11:11 2015 UTC,"In that image stabilization video they are probably using the built in image stabilization in the lens. The lens they show mounted on the camera is the Canon 18-135mm IS (with the IS denoting built in image stabilization). And there are tons of sample videos on youtube with this lens that look pretty similar in terms of shakiness.    So they either did not use the Pandora for recording that video, or the Pandora does such a poor job at stabilizing that it just looks like it was shot handheld using the lens's image stabilization. This whole thing is a scam!"
shittykickstarters,3959p7,sonofaresiii,-1,Thu Jun 11 06:04:26 2015 UTC,"Hi guys, iÂ´m the developer of Pandora, if you have any question let me know.  About the stabilization test, what that video shows is that there is no micro-vibrations, and you can use a 400mm without a tripod. If you ever used a DSLR you know that is not easy.  If you connect your H4N to the camera, you loose the headphones output and cant hear what you are recording. Also, you need a place to put the recorder.  Probably you donÂ´t know much editors, since the automatic synch is good for 3 videos, but when you have 300 clips and 5 SD cards filled with data without a clapboard, it could take weeks to synch.  By the way, all the electric data you posted is wrong, get your facts right please, or simply ask if you donÂ´t know.  The solar panel feeds the audio battery, so it gives some extra time just in case you cant charge Pandora in a couple of days.  Any smartphone charger gives 1.5mah suppose this is a 20hours charge if you are empty. Or a 10 hours charge if you only use half. So in one night you can recharge your power. If you have a DSLR, you probably have a few extra batteries but only one charger 2 if you are cautious. But, you have to change batteries every 2 hours, so when you get home with 6 empty batteries at 10pm, and have to wake at 8am to keep shooting what do you do? Wake up every 2 ours to change batteries? buy 5 extra chargers? Besides You can also charge Pandora from the standard charger of your battery, connecting the DC coupler into the charger socket, and plugging it to Pandora, which will charge at the same rate any charger does (0.65 Mah, yea.. like a USB port almost).  The comments on the light really doesnÂ´t deserve a great explanation, it is a ""Use if needed"" feature, you donÂ´t have to use it all the time, and specially if you have a closeup. Filmmakers are smart enough to know when to use a light.  I hope you make the same comments when big brands like Canon change the model of a camera and only add one lock button, or the new mac with only one USB port? No?  But here you are, complaining about something that people actually made to help other people work."
shittykickstarters,3959p7,UnlikelyPotato,7,Tue Jun 9 23:20:09 2015 UTC,"Hey Pablo, nice to have you here. There is no need to be rude.  What part of my electric data was wrong? I can write in detail the steps I took to get all those numbers. Of course those are ballpark numbers and rough estimations, since some information isn't posted on your campaign, but I stand by these numbers and would be surprised if there were indeed wrong. Misusing an electrical unit literarily two sentences after such an accusation doesn't help your case. You probably meant 1.5A (Amperes, a unit of electric current) instead of 1.5mAh (miliAmpere-hours, a unit of electric capacity), though stating that ""any"" phone charger has such an output is also a overstatement, given that the very popular iPhone charger is 1.0A.  I do admit you have a point about monitoring the audio. I didn't notice that the H4n lacks a separate line out and and headphone jack as the H5 does. But then again, people in the market for a better audio solution will probably be more likely to look into the H5 now, a it's basically a newer replacement for the H4n.  We're not here to complain. Product design and development is a very difficult task, and kickstarter has been overrun by people who bite of more than they can chew. There is often a reason why products are made simple, and racing to pack more features usually ends up in mediocre quality, or even inability to ship - the latter being more and more common amongst crowdfunded products. We try to warn the public of campaigns that may seem good at first glance, but after a closer look, appear to be rushed and done without proper consultation.  It also doesn't help to build trust when you are comparing your product to products that are old and discontinued. The Anton Bauer Dionic HCX battery you show in this comparison is no longer produced or available. It would be much more fair to compare your yet-to-be-released product with something that is currently in offer, don't you think? Like the G150, that compared to the old model you choose, has 50% more capacity, weights roughly half as much and costs $530 instead of $904."

A similar situation would take my 2007 macbook less than a day.  The takeaway from your post seems to be that you want me to pay you $600 so I can monitor the audio if I choose to record it internally. Instead of taking half a day to sync external audio.  I was willing to give you guys the benefit of the doubt but come on man. Target people who have no clue what they're doing, not us."

I even have a Quick Charge 2.0 doing the full 12V-1.5A output.  IMHO, if an external battery pack has a total capacity over 20Ah, it needs a faster charging method than standard 5V-2.1A, or else it takes too long even if you charge it from 50%.

Like for example 2 Micro USB ports so it doesn't take a literal night to charge.  It just seems like they took an idea of an external battery mount for large DLSR's and then anytime they had a feature come to mind they'd change the design.  If they just had a battery pack with external MIC 'stuff' they'd have a much better system which'd fit 99% of this devices usecase in a fraction of the cost.  Instead they kept adding features left, right and centre til they got the bloated mess which pushed them waaaay outside of the semi-professional video recorder which let's make no mistake about it, is their target.  EDIT: Couldn't you just make a $500 thing with MIC controls and monitoring with an SD card holder and 16000mAh Anker battery built in and have lots of money left over?"

Our DAD drive, which is more affordable, enables clients to access our exhibitions by simply connecting the drive to their existing screens or projectors.

They also aggressively pushed the refunds on an artificial timeline which had the convenient side effect of distracting backers from seeking better recourse to get full refunds via credit card chargebacks, etc.  They still make plenty of money with the rest of their company, and with this Kickstarter project, they had some playtime with free money, then said, basically, 'screw the Kickstarter backers, and having decency..."".   If we commit to delivering Triggertrap Ada, thereâs an extremely good chance that the company wonât survive.

shittykickstarters,3936z1,sicarim,3,Tue Jun 9 05:33:36 2015 UTC,"You sound bitter. That project looks legit, but they simply failed. When you back a project, you aren't buying a product. You're an angel investor. And as a reward they might give you a product later on when they succeed. Kickstarter isn't a shop, it's a platform.   Many of the things posted here are straight up scams and the project you linked to doesnt look like a scam."
shittykickstarters,3936z1,mrv3,5,Tue Jun 9 12:12:31 2015 UTC,"I am tired of that bullshit.  If the case was ""you aren't buying a product"" don't offer the product as a reward.  Of course no company would do that as no one would back for $100 such that a product gets made.  The success of kickstarter is tied directly, to the point of non-existence without it, of the idea of getting the product.  Companies can't get it both ways.  If they took out a loan to develop and make a product failure to make the product would cause major problems, even bannkruptcy.  If the company got money from investors for an idea they'd lose potential profit and money in the long run.  A company gets it both ways with kickstarter it's one of the least consumer friendly things out.  So if a company wants to research and explore an idea with backers money do it honestly and not offer the product. But then you'll see them, and kickstarter, make 1/10th of the money. IF THAT.  I doubt Ada would make close tyo the $500,000 they got if they came out and said  ""X% of the company, and Y% of the profit generated from Ada for $100""  I doubt they'd even make that $75,000.  But what i described is exactly what you want INVESTMENT.  Let's call kickstarter projects what they pre-manufacture orders."
shittykickstarters,3936z1,sicarim,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:19:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. The kickstarter model is fundamentally broken. People are goin to be less enthusiastic about helping some random people out with their product if they don't get anything in return, and rightfully so. But when you sign up for a kickstarter account they tell you this and make no guarantees. The solution is not participate. I don't really feel bad for people who burned by these crowd funding things because they aren't reading the fine print."
shittykickstarters,3936z1,mrv3,3,Tue Jun 9 16:28:26 2015 UTC,"And people who know about the darker side of kickstarter are aware and do avoid backing, myself included which to date I've backed  -Minecraft(to avoid price increase)  -Fractured Space(To help out a British dev)  -World of Warship(because Turpitz.)  -Factorio(I pirated it, played for hours non-stop felt guilty some time later)  -Maybe KSP(Not sure when i bought it but pirated it before and loved it but wouldn't run well)  While all games my one rule has always been if developement was to stop right now would I be happy?

shittykickstarters,3936z1,person278,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:45:21 2015 UTC,"But when you sign up for a kickstarter account they tell you this and make no guarantees.   At best, they softball the fact that there is risk.  When Kickstarter gets called out, like they did by NPR, they say things like:   Is a creator legally obligated to fulfill the promises of their project? Yes. Kickstarter's Terms of Use require creators to fulfill all rewards of their project or refund any backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill. (This is what creators see before they launch.) We crafted these terms to create a legal requirement for creators to follow through on their projects, and to give backers a recourse if they don't. We hope that backers will consider using this provision only in cases where they feel that a creator has not made a good faith effort to complete the project and fulfill. (https://www.kickstarter.com/blog/accountability-on-kickstarter)   Yet, as the strategy for how they build the Kickstarter website, they don't allow backers to directly chat with each other or give any sort of feedback or rating to flag scam projects or project creators that don't deliver.    Numerous news articles see this complicit fraud by Kickstarter very obviously.  Kickstarter sets up that backers have to take legal action to fight back, and then they make it very hard for backers to get any momentum or organization.  Gizmodo said it well:   Most major platforms, from Kickstarter to GoFundMe, have a deliberately lax approach to rooting out bullshit. Thereâs really no incentive to take a hard line: The proliferation of scams has left plenty of frustrated donors, but it hasnât stopped people from pulling out their wallets. When projects get funded, these platforms take a cutâso as long as negative publicity is outweighed by sweet, sweet scam cash, crowdfunding platforms are going to remain fertile ground for scams.  That sucks. And while everyone should keep in mind that giving money to crowdfunding campaigns will never have a guaranteed outcomeâitâs donating money to support an idea, not investing in or buying a finished productâitâs not okay that crowdfunding sites are playing dumb and getting rich by enabling fraud. We want to put more pressure on them to enforce quality control and help people get refunds from scammers. We want to raise awareness about how frequently people get away with ripping off crowdfunding supporters. (http://gizmodo.com/we-want-to-hear-about-the-worst-crowdfunding-scams-and-1700473596)"

Also, the printing service he's using does on-demand direct to consumer printing but instead he's shipping all the magazines to his place and then paying to ship them again from his place to the backers.

No. Nazis killed Jews. That's everything he told with this movie. Half of movie was some german middle schoolers (or high- schoolers, I don't really know) from one school answering his questions about Holocaust and Auschwitz.   And I wouldn't give a damn about it, well, very bad documentary with some stupid Q&A with kids... if only this wasn't biased. Do you know where Auschwitz was founded? Do you know why? Do you know how many people got killed in it? Do you even know who killed those people? You won't get that from that shitty biased movie! Everyone would think that Auschwitz was some mystical land when bad nazis killed good jews. THERE, everything about that fucking movie summed up in one sentence.

He does some very elementary electronic tests, measuring voltage and resistance. It is not exactly some deep esoteric technical information that he is presenting, I think even an ""average joe"" with a high school level of electronics would be able to understand what he is doing. There is absolutely nothing in his video that requires almost 40 minutes to explain.  But the most important point I was making is that his voice is extremely whiney and annoying to listen to. His target audience and other videos do not change the fact that his speaking makes his videos unwatchable for most people.

It magnifies motion in videos. So they can take a normal video of a man sleeping and monitor his pulse. It's pretty cool. I remember something about them making it open source, too.

I went through the video and the kickstarter page and really can't point my finger at any one particular spot and say ""this is 100% BS"", but at the same time, the pitch as a whole really does seem untrustworthy, misinformed and has the sent of a scam. I do have some vague points though.  Startup companies with innovative products seldom enter the market with a broad variety of products to choose from. It's very expensive to bring one device to market, why start with four? That's quadrupling the risk! Out of somewhat similar companies: Leap Motion has one device, Stem has one device, Tobii started with only one eye tracker in offer, even Apple used to offer only one taste of iPhone until recently.  They have a table of frequencies that correspond to brain waves and mention this as part of their algorithm. They never claim to measure brainwaves, or mention a correlation between their ""micro oscillations"" and brainwaves, they never even use the term ""brain waves"", yet they have a table of their meaning.  They mention the ability to scan people through video conferencing applications. Does this mean that their software works without the need of a special camera? If so, then why are they introducing FOUR special cameras. They mention using near infrared - that requires a special camera (well, at least a source of infrared light). They also mention Eulerian Video Magnification - this requires control over the scan line of the camera, so also won't work via Skype (especially considering Skype's compression)  Weird."

The decor of the office in the KS video is mighty similar to Garden Studios, down to the shitty artwork covering every wall. They also offer a virtual office service. The main phone number listed on their website is a mobile phone.  The company registration is just 4 months old. Incorporated 4th Feburary. 'Our Promise', signed by Daniel Edwards CEO is dated 12th January. 3 weeks before he registered the company, and thus misrepresenting himself as a company director. The company has a single director, a 22 year old Daniel Edwards who is also the company secretary. Complete lack of information about the 'engineering team' or even the company director - no information about their background or what their expertise is in. No information about how the devices actually work other than lots and lots of buzzwords and lingo.   I'm thinking that this is a one-man band. He registered his company using a virtual office service, and hired the same office for a day and roped a bunch of friends in to help him make his awkward video. He's not actually based in that office, hence the mobile phone number for a contact.  The cameras are probably pre-made chinese junk bought off Alibaba (I'm not clicking through 300 pages of cheap cameras to find his exact model) as there is simply no way he has developed and prototyped 5 different models of cameras with varying specifications in just 4 months - not to mention the software or the 'extensive databases' they he claimed to have developed.  Speaking of which, given that he appears to be analysing a very bog-standard video feed - what exactly is the device doing that a normal webcam or phone camera couldn't?"

shittykickstarters,38vk8f,intromatt,10,Sun Jun 7 07:47:48 2015 UTC,"Since nobody bothered to take it apart, I'm guessing it either shorts various resistors to D+/D- of USB part to emulate a DCP/BC1.x charge controller, or uses the said charge controller IC. It just informs your phone/device that connected USB port is for charging, allowing it to draw more current. It ""does"" work, but so does the Chinese device for $4."
shittykickstarters,38vk8f,bloggie2,2,Sun Jun 7 08:07:31 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thank you for the info.  I have one more question.  Would a device like this charge a tablet faster than plugging it in to the wall (with a USB adapter)?"
shittykickstarters,38vk8f,intromatt,9,Sun Jun 7 13:52:34 2015 UTC,Nope. The wall adapter (especially one from the tablet/phone vendor) is already the best way to charge.  These things will make it draw more than 0.5A when plugged into PC/Laptop USB port - because otherwise it would think it's a USB data connection and follow the spec (max 500mA).
shittykickstarters,38vk8f,bloggie2,2,Sun Jun 7 14:50:59 2015 UTC,Ahh...I should read up on all of this stuff.  Thank you soo much for your answer.

shittykickstarters,38s4m1,AndrePierrie,16,Sat Jun 6 09:48:23 2015 UTC,"I'd have to agree with the other comment, your pledge goals are out of whack.  Â£10 t-shirts are going to sink your funding.  The goal is not to sell things, you have to make up the cost of producing that thing, shipping it, and then also make a profit.  Apparel is like Â£10 to start off if you're buying it in a bulk order of like 300, so that should be a much higher tier reward.  Your game however costs next to nothing to distribute, and you want to incentivize early adoption of the game itself, not t-shirts.  The game should be your Â£5-10 reward.  Additionally, your video is pretty weak.  The music is stock as all heck, and doesn't fit what you have at all.  There's a lot of talk about defending and mining your planet, but none of that is shown.  If the defense of the planet isn't in the game yet, then there's not much to show and people are always going to be skeptical so long as that's the case.  There's a term in the software development world, ""Minimum Viable Product"".  If you want your game to be about defending a planet or mining resources or whatever, then put that feature first.  Then prioritize stuff that the game is less focused on in descending order.  Because there's an awful lot of detail put into the features that are in it right now that ultimately have no impact on what you're advertising.  I wouldn't call your kickstarter ""shitty"" because it's not overtly harming anything but itself.  Although there are some pretty big improvements that need to be made before backers start taking it seriously."
shittykickstarters,38s4m1,AuraTummyache,5,Sat Jun 6 10:57:44 2015 UTC,"TLDR above: people don't want to back something when they don't even get the actual product at the lowest level.   It's a disincentive psychologically, people see the lower levels as a waste.  The typical backer would think that buying the lower level doesn't fund the game since it's not a reward.  I wouldn't want to back a GAME and not even get the GAME, would you?"

shittykickstarters,38s4m1,mcnub,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:02:24 2015 UTC,"Aside from the weird pledge reward levels, its way, way too vague a presentation for your enormous budget. You need to do a lot of work up front in order to present examples of the basic gameplay elements, and even so your number is too high given your teams inexperience and the risk level of the project.  I would want to see a lot of the game ALREADY DONE before pledging at all on a project like this.  It's a cute concept for sure. Possibly relaunch later when you have something to show besides a basic editor.  And if the graphics are cute and fun, you probably need music to match, not whatever that stuff was."

Around that time I was starting to take an interest in creating websites. I had created 5 different little 5 page websites for fun and knew how to use Dreamweaver but didn't know anything about actually coding or starting a business. So this was about 2 weeks after graduating high school that I decided that I wasn't going to go to college and instead make a commitment to teach myself how to code, teach myself business and start my own business. It was the best decision of my life. I chose to follow my passion and if I would have chosen to go to college I would be drowning in student loan debt. So every day I would go to my regular job then come home and code for 10 hours. On the weekend sun up to sun down. I had a bunch of jobs just to get by that ranged from construction to cleaning to working in a kitchen. I started saving all my money and paid off my car early and all my bills for a year so I could quit my jobs and pursue LuvQuest full time. I'm currently on the 2nd month. I have given up everything from T.V. to spending time with family and friends to sleeping regularly. I am to the point where I understand I am going to need start up capital to take this to the next level. I have had a vision for this since I first started and I will follow through and see that vision become a reality. I will use all donated money wisely to best benefit the growth of LuvQuest.com.   wat"

Since this is kickstarter, I'd expect this scampaign to be deleted shortly (and possibly rebooted on indiegogo later)  I LOVE how they show the retractible fins. What kind of derailed train of thought was behind this? Did the brainstorm look like this:  A-tard: ok, what things float  B-tard: surf boards, sharks, boats  A-tard: ok, what do they have in common  R-tard: FINS!  Ridiculous. But for bonus laughs, let's do the math!  They claim the phone will weight 160g. A reasonable number here. No dimensions were provided, but the screen is supposed to be 4.7"", like on an iPhone 6, so I'll assume the Comet will be similarly sized - that is 140 x 67mm.  to make an 160g body buoyant, it needs to have a volume of at least 160cm3. We have the width and height, so lets calculate the depth required.  160cm^3 / 14.0cm / 6.7cm  = 1.7cm   And now let's count some pixels on their renders:  http://i.imgur.com/q6CFJvF.png  Yeah.

This tank was built 20 times (+ some chassis used for transport duties) and got to limited use in WWI. There's even an existing tank left at a museum in Australia. So the circumstances to rebuild the A7V were quite good: Many photos, existing documents, even a few surviving tank crew members left. The tank was to be rebuilt partly by the original companies, the plans were made by historians of a german tank museum. All that got backed by international archives and the German army. Even then it proved difficult as the surviving tank is burnt out inside, many construction plans were lost, and the few remaining crew members didn't remind such details decades later. They got it, but at some points they openly admitted that several times they were more guessing then knowing.  Here the circumstances are much more difficult: Some guy (not historians from renowned museum) working on this. The company building the tank nonexistant anymore. The E-100 was - as they state - never completed nor tested. There are almost no photos left. There are absolutely no crewmembers left. And you can expect that many plans were lost in the last weeks of the war.  So basically something that proved hard to do by experts under far better circumstances will now be done via crowdfunding? Never."

Anyway, beyond the lack of a real need for this (Although, I figure some people thought, ""I don't drink enough water - this will motivate me to do so"") there is another issue that without reading it I think has been overlooked. For people that actually want to use this for what I can only assume is it's purpose, to track water consumption, it neglects any water consumed that was not from... wait for it... a bottle. So now that leaves us with three options;    Add some manual non-bottle water consumption mechanism to the app, although this would make the product appear silly by pointing out the issue. Ship the product with a disclaimer that the user shall now only ever consume water from a bottle. For example, you want a glass of water, you fill up your bottle, you pour said water into your glass, you contemplate suicide. Sweep anything regarding said issue under the rug and put your product on kickstarter so you have no big-whale-type investors asking sensible questions like this."

shittykickstarters,38eukq,sudojay,2,Thu Jun 4 05:45:29 2015 UTC,"Hyponatremia:       Hyponatremia (American English) or hyponatraemia (British English) is low sodium concentration in the blood.  Normal serum sodium levels are between approximately 135 and 145 mEq/liter (135 - 145Â mmol/L). Hyponatremia is generally defined as a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and is considered severe when the serum sodium level is below 125 mEq/L.    Too little sodium in the diet alone is very rarely the cause of hyponatremia, although it can promote hyponatremia indirectly and has been associated with MDMA-induced hyponatremia.  Sodium loss can lead to a state of low blood volume, which signals the release of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH). [citation needed] ADH release leads to water retention and dilution of the blood resulting in a low sodium concentration.  Many conditions including congestive heart failure, liver failure, kidney failure and pneumonia are commonly associated with a low sodium concentration in the blood. This state can also be caused by overhydration from drinking too much water because of excess thirst (polydipsia). Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) is common in marathon runners and participants of other endurance events.  13% of the athletes who finished the 2002 Boston Marathon were in a hyponatremic state, that is, the salt levels in their blood had fallen below usual levels.

So I can't get a straight answer.  Most likely cause was WMP fucking with the elapsed time since the last frame, causing your framerate to be something like ""90 frames per 1.7 seconds"" or something like that.  Then people just misreported or misunderstood their results.  Point is that your battery is just going to read at 100% and die at exactly the same time.  Which is actually worse than not having the stupid device at all.  I remember trying it once and had an imperceptibly different framerate, but my numbers read something along ""17004 fps"".  You'd be surprised at how many people can look at 30 fps with text that says ""60 fps"" and believe it."

The Batteriser is more polished, I'll give it that.  The 800% claim is absurd. In some applications a decent boost converter could help a bit, but there would also be cases where you'll get less useful life out of your batteries with a boost converter than without it. Good luck to the average consumer who tries to figure out which is which."

Not to mention it features an unmistakable miniPCIexpress port - a 30mm slot that in no way has 30mm according to the external measurements of the dragonfly. So, business as usual on Indiegogo :)"

You had iphone6 knockoffs on sale in the streets of shenzen and being sold online all over the world from there way before the phone even launched, all because an employee at foxconn who makes the iphones sold a few parts to other chinese company, who then resold the molds to companies like goophone who make knockoffs of everything.

Should they maybe have focused on shipping KS before going to stores?  Maybe but as long as KS backers get their (IMO) premium versions I don't see an issue.

shittykickstarters,37rv4b,mstolarski,4,Fri May 29 22:05:13 2015 UTC,"Hi all, Some of you are questioning  need for BikeMic, while it is ok to ride a bike using single earbud or open headphones (ones which donât cut you off the background sounds). Others try closed headphones, but with music level set very low. Iâve tested all these options and finally they all made me unhappy. Single earbud are ok when traveling in countryside, but in city traffic it is of no use as in order to hear you music, you have to set it so loud that you can eventually damage your hearing. Closed headphones treat you ear well, but music listened quietly lacks high tones and are nor surround.  BikeMic coupled with high-end closed headphones makes the difference. You are able to listed to high quality stereo music with full basses and trebles, simultaneously mixed with high quality, stereo sounds of surrounding scene. It makes you fully aware of what is happening around you, for example whether you going to be overtaken from left or right. BikeMic is equipped with two control knobs which lets you precisely adjust music and street sounds volume. When in city traffic, you keep the street noise at reasonable level so music is kept in decent quality and loudness, not exceeding safe limits. When in country side, you can pump up background sounds, take down music level and you are free to enjoy nature around you. BikeMic microphone is covered under protective fur, preventing wind gusts to be recorded when biking fast. All in all, all those features makes really good outcome, that, in most cases surprises those who were not convinced to BikeMic so far. Itâs hard to imagine, because BikeMic is one of a kind, but BikeMic makes you feel like in cinema, adding to soundtrack to your bike trip."
shittykickstarters,37rv4b,autowikibot,3,Sat May 30 21:09:12 2015 UTC,"Side note: It's nice to have your here! I'm always happy to have the creator participate in open discussion.  I'm sure your experiences with different headphones while riding a bike are legitimate and understand how you find this a problem worth solving. But I do highly doubt the effectiveness and safety of your solution. Have you tested this concept with any prototype? You don't even need to make a prototype, you might just take a 4 channel field recorder (like this one for example) plug in two omnidirectional microphones with wind filters and a music player and just take a ride to evaluate the feasibility of this solution.  My concerns are based on the difference between hearing sounds directly with your ears, and having mounted microphones. Before reading on I recommend the first 10 minutes of this talk I've linked in a different comment here.  The video on Indiegogo suggests mounting the microphone on the front or back of the bike. Imagine a situation where a cyclist using BikeMic is approached by a car (sound source) from the right side. He hears it through the right headphone, as the sound is picked up by the right microphone. He then rotates his head towards the car, to visualy confirm its position, but the bike-mounted device remains aligned as it was. The car sound is still picked up by the right microphone and played to the right ear of the cyclist. The cyclist still hears the car to his right, but sees it right in front of him. This is called sensory mismatch and can cause motion sickness, spacial disorientation and even illusions. Even the tiniest, subconscious and unnoticeable movements of our head allow our brain to collect more information about the surrounding environment. Similarly, having images taken from several points allows the brain to gather more depth information about the image. This gif http://fuzzywobble.com/images/stereo.gif uses this to appear 3d. You are taking away this ability from the cyclist.  I had one particular experience that made me write this post as soon as I saw your Indiegogo pitch. When toying with the Oculus Rift, at first I didn't attach the virtual microphone to the rotation of the players head. I noticed this error immediately - the experience was completely ruined, everything was simply ""off"". I know it's just a simulation and a game, but I believe that the very same will happen with the BikeMic. I strongly suggest you try this concept out if you haven't already."
shittykickstarters,37rv4b,mstolarski,4,Sun May 31 00:24:10 2015 UTC,"Spatial disorientation:       Spatial disorientation, spatial unawareness is the inability of a person to correctly determine his/her body position in space. This phenomenon refers especially to aircraft pilots and underwater divers,  but can be also induced in normal conditionsÂ â chemically or physically (e.g. by blindfolding). In aviation, the term means the inability to correctly interpret aircraft attitude, altitude or airspeed, in relation to the Earth or point of reference, especially after a reference point (e.g., the horizon) has been lost. Spatial disorientation is a condition in which an aircraft pilot's perception of direction does not agree with reality. While it can be brought on by disturbances or disease within the vestibular system, it is more typically a temporary condition resulting from flight into poor weather conditions with low or no visibility. Under these conditions the pilot may be deprived of an external visual horizon, which is critical to maintaining a correct sense of up and down while flying.

I used 4-channer audio recorder Zoom H4N for testing various configurations, the same way you proposed.

Below you can find links to videos recorded during testing of our first prototype.

It cuts off a lot of the information your ears are capable of gathering about the positioning of incoming sounds so the user will end up being confused about his surroundings.  For anyone interested in how the mechanics of localising sounds works I recommend this talk by Brian Hook from Oculus https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBBuuvEP5Z4&ab_channel=Oculus. The talk is devoted to audio in virtual reality, but to tackle this problem, Brian first gives a nice intro on how this mechanic works in the first place (First ~10 minutes of the video). From all that's happening in your head to estimate the origin of a sound, a microphone mounted as shown on the promotional video only allows from Interaural Level Difference. Everything else mentioned in that talk is cut off.  Open headphones will also limit some of those mechanics, but significantly less than the bikemic. They will distract you with music, they will change the frequency filtering of your ears, but they won't change the interaural time delay and, most importantly, they will allow you to get additional points of information by rotating your head - unlike the bikemic, where rotating your head changes nothing filling your head with contradictory information and simply confusing you."

shittykickstarters,37nl1d,ApproachingCorrect,9,Fri May 29 00:06:48 2015 UTC,"The stainless mugs that you usually see are steel because there's a vacuum between the walls and they need something strong to withstand the pressure. So even though the metal is a good conductor of heat, the vacuum between the two layers is an excellent insulator.  However, since genius here wants to make it a cube.. What is going to really end up happening is slapping a plastic square over an existing cylindrical mug.    You'd wind up with some really odd stresses on the thing if you tried to make a square insulated mug.  That or the steel would be so thick the mug would be overly heavy and no one would likely want to drink from the thing."

The metal I know from welding but I digress. So stainless steel is a fantastic thermal conductor but some gasses, the ones they use in sealed window panes, do an ok job as an insulator for a gas. One of these is argon. Another is flourine. These would work alright but not as well as most physical things like styrofoam or a sweater. But yeah this thing would suck even if they filled it with gasses and welded the mug shut"

You don't want to hold the bottle all the way of course, so you reach down and put it in the cup holder. WHATS THIS!? It wont fit!

Persians eat a lot of stews, one which can be seen in the second ""home cooked"" meal,  and they love to go on picnics so to be able to transport and keep a stew warm might be quite useful.  The selection of these kinds of meal heaters/propane grills might be smaller in Iran than in the US for example. Still a decent food thermos would probably work just as well.

shittykickstarters,37kafq,foreverska,18,Thu May 28 06:29:50 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell he intends to use a neural network to run a variety of fixed length programs. What that means is he has a set of programs, a set of inputs and a set of goals. At first his program will run the set of programs at random but if a goal is achieved or progress is made then it will make the machine more likely to run that program again in similar circumstances. This isn't anything new. The only thing that is noticeable different is the fact that all the programs are of a fixed length which isn't an advantage. In fact it will likely only serve to slow down the program."
shittykickstarters,37kafq,woodlark14,7,Thu May 28 11:49:02 2015 UTC,"Fellow programmer here and can confirm.  I'd like to also add that because a neural network needs a positive and negative condition to learn and that the intelligent activity that he wants it to learn is based on arbitrary conditions, this thing will be essentially useless.  This is a slower and more complicated way of making a robot that fulfills a specific need in the most efficient way possible.  In layman's terms, his proposal is to create a robot that slowly learns to do a single task over time and requires constant monitoring rather than just creating a robot that already knows how to do that thing.  Which kind of sums up how AI in robots is fucking cool, but ultimately pointless."
shittykickstarters,37kafq,AuraTummyache,2,Thu May 28 15:57:07 2015 UTC,"I am still trying to understand what he thinks is the advantage of fixed length programs. Is it fixed length in size of code, number of instructions or execution time? In his other kickstarter he proposes 2 computers executing fixed length programs as some form of secure transfer protocol."
shittykickstarters,37kafq,HuTheFinnMan,5,Fri May 29 00:37:26 2015 UTC,"This will allow if possible for extra code to be paired with the block to fill the time limit.   Makes me think he just wants to pick a fixed block of time so that he can break up operations at the end to fill in space to get a constant cycle speed and not have any unfinished functions at the end of a cycle.  I have no idea what he thinks that will do though, like that doesn't really solve anything.  Maybe he thinks that the reason AI learning is slow is because of unused cpu time?  I dunno.  Most likely this dude is taking classes on these subjects RIGHT NOW, heard some cool words, googled them for a bit, and thinks he's mastered the subject."
shittykickstarters,37kafq,AuraTummyache,3,Fri May 29 03:19:21 2015 UTC,I agree it reads like someone who has just learned some vague information about electrical engineering and programming and thinks he has some groundbreaking ideas. Arbitrary schematic picture for extra points.  His rambling about timed executions of code is even more bizarre in the context of him using it as some sort of security protocol. Here is the link to his other project if you haven't seen it:  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/58151391/network-security-and-component-advancement  I think he is suggesting running pseudo-randomized code blocks with varying execution times on 2 seperate devices and comparing the timing between them. It almost sounds like he has an interesting idea but it is far too vague and leaves out too many important details for me to take it seriously.
shittykickstarters,37kafq,HuTheFinnMan,1 point,Fri May 29 03:57:19 2015 UTC,"The timed execution is definitely a fetish of his or something.  My best guess was that the operation time would become part of the signature, which I think kind of makes sense, but that does double (triple?) (MORE?!?) your execution time.  That's not a terrible idea, but it's a hell of a sacrifice to make to prevent attacks directly on the server.  So to kind of break this down in my head...   Request is sent to PC1 PC1 processes request with every operation at a fixed rate PC1 signs the request and forwards it to PC2 PC2 processes the same request at the same fixed rate and checks the generated signature against PC1's signature Request is sent to the actual api layer for execution According to the schematic, it actually runs through that security layer AGAIN, but he probably just fucked that up, it could securely send the result to the client at this point.   But all this does really is add a layer of security to requests to the server from a specific entry point, which something like a security group on AWS does but way fucking better and faster.  So the ONLY way this would be interesting is if he was able to use the execution time + a random amount of time that was consistent between PC1 and PC2, which would result in basically a nonce that is psuedo seeded with every request by the amount of operations in the request.  That actually does sound kind of cool, but I don't think that regular old nonce's are that easy to predict.  So ""what does this solve?"" is still unanswered.  This fucking kickstarter is making me dizzy."

Flexible means creator takes the money no matter what. In both cases, you are charged. You can't even modify pledges on Indiegogo (upgrade or downgrade)"

In this case, there is no growth, this dude is just acting as a middle man and reaping profits from people who didn't (and shouldn't have even had to) do research to make sure it wasn't misleading.  People trust these websites because indiegogo and kickstarter have taken on the responsibility of making sure that the donation drives are legitimate.  In this case indiegogo failed, which makes it less trustworthy and hurts the site's already unscrupulous reputation.  Which in turn hurts the people who actually need it for its proper purpose.  If you're using these services just to buy something instead of wanting to support the development of that thing and other things like it, then you're not using it right.

Over 1,300,000 of these units were sold in Japan at an approximate price of $21.   It was the first such device, and ""the first commercial attempt to move introduction systems away from the desktop and into reality"".  As such, it was an important precursor for other location-based social networking applications such as Nokia's Bluetooth-based Nokia sensor, and more recent geo-location based social applications such as StreetSpark.   There were three modes users could pre-select on the Lovegety device which reflected the mood they were currently in and hence what kind of partner they were looking for. These included âletâs just chatâ, âletâs go sing some karaokeâ and âget2â or ""looking for love"" modes. The devices could be set to interact with each other when a potential mate was within close proximity (15 feet) or to simply notify a user of others who are currently set to the same mood.

However, the likelihood of them being successful is so small that they will probably never deliver something that meets their specs (if they deliver anything at all).

Example: ""there will be tax advantages to you if you let me take title to your property,"" or ""you don't have to read the rest of the contract-it is just routine legal language"" but actually includes a balloon payment."

Using the BBB is probably the last thing to do if you want reliable information.

If you read it carefully its written in such a way that Kickstarter is washing their hands of any involvement once they released the funds to the project owners. At this point Kickstarter can't do much. If Kickstarter were to do anything it would be to remove any additionally liability from themselves.  Additionally, Kickstarter will shutdown fraudulent projects during the funding stage, but once a project is fully funded that money is released to the project owners. At this point Kickstarter has taken their 10% cut and have no way of getting that funding back unless they directly sue the project owners which they will never do."

They've provided a pretty thorough explanation of their expenditures. See this update from them:  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1655017763/cst-01-the-worlds-thinnest-watch/posts/1221663  I doubt anyone would win in court. They've shows that they had good intentions but ran into problems and ran out of money.   You know, like 90% of startups out there. that doesn't make it a scam.  As to the title of this thread, ""spend $1mill and then hide"", that also doesn't seem fair.

shittykickstarters,378ofo,i010011010,1 point,Thu May 28 19:20:54 2015 UTC,That's a superstition.  People begging on kickstarter have no contractual obligation.  That's why they're on kickstarter instead of seeking legitimate investment where they would have been liable.

They're presenting a list down the side that says ""give this, get that"".  Now, I'll agree they don't have an obligation to produce anything that wasn't in the backer rewards, but if they promise something in the backer rewards, that's as plain a promise as any other obligation, and money already changed hands. While there might be a vague sort of sense, or common understanding that people shouldn't necessarily expect to get the backer rewards, a vague sense doesn't mean much. I don't see why it wouldn't be legally actionable to go after someone who reneged.  If the creator is scared of falling short, they should stick to thank-you notes and tee shirts, and live with the tepid response that might create.  And I don't see this as a bad thing. Kickstarter still gets you over the hump of having to convince investors or get a bank loan, but it shouldn't take away consequences from failure. Entrepreneurialism is not without its risk, and while the backers could surely take a haircut, the creator should be on the hook to fail as well. Without that, there's no disincentive at all against bad ideas, outright scams, or failing to fail gracefully when you ought to have."

shittykickstarters,378ofo,HuTheFinnMan,24,Tue May 26 00:09:23 2015 UTC,"Hi, thanks for posting here. I am always curious about the thoughts of people who back these sort of projects. I am certainly not trying to place any blame or mock you for your decisions but I am genuinely interested to hear what you were thinking when you decided to back this kickstarter.  Did you do any research at all into the feasability of the project or just took the creators word that they could do what they promised?  Were you aware that you were backing a couple of guys with no resources for them to ""have a try"" at designing and manufacturing a product and that there was a chance that it may not be successful?  In hindsight do you feel like the original campaign was misleading or overstated how easy it would be to manufacture the watches?  Of course you don't have to answer. Like I said I am not trying to be hostile or judge you. As a cautious and skeptical person I am just trying to understand the thinking of people who put faith in strangers asking for money."
shittykickstarters,378ofo,FF0000it,47,Tue May 26 02:38:21 2015 UTC,"I suspect I view Kickstarter differently than most. I don't view it as a store. I do view it as a way for regular people (you and me) to ""angel invest"" in other people to make their dream company come through.  I've backed over 120 projects now on Kickstarter. All but 1 (this one) have come through. Well, plus the four or five that I'm backing now that are in progress.  I think that's a pretty good track record.  So did I do heavy research? No. Do I know something about electronics, e-ink, software design? Yes. My gut said that it was possible. Clearly I was wrong - at least at the prices they were asking. But I liked the work they'd done up front. They had a prototype already working, I'm familiar with e-ink technology from other stuff I've worked on, and I felt this was doable. And they did succeed in making the watch... but ran out of money.   But in the grand scheme of things, it was still worth it to me. Again, I view backing a Kickstarter as an investment, and that does come with risk. If it paid off, I'd have a watch that (to me) would have normally cost two or three times more than what I paid.   And indeed, of the other 120 Kickstarters I've backed, I've made out like a bandit and gotten some really great stuff for really quite a little amount of money. Generally speaking.   As for why I backed it this particular one - I'm a watch enthusiast. I collect both vintage digital watches (Seiko & Pulsar, mostly), plus analog watches (Hamilton, Omega, and a few others). I also love the display on my Kindle e-reader, so I was naturally drawn to this, and thought it was neat.  I think the /r/shittykickstarter subreddit is actually an important one. It calls out up-front poorly thought out Kickstarter projects and warns people off them.  I don't feel that CST was one of them. Yes, 20-20 hindsight and all, but I still think it was a good idea, but with poor financial planning & execution."
shittykickstarters,378ofo,HuTheFinnMan,18,Tue May 26 02:47:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for responding. I definitely can appreciate your thinking on this one.  For what it's worth I believe the general consensus here was that this was in fact an attempt at a legit project and the creators just got caught out by the realities of manufacturing. I think the consumerist article is a little harsh but even though the project creators didn't outright intend to defraud, people are still going to be angry when they didn't get what they expected.  The huge problem that you can consistently see now is people thinking that kickstarter is an online store and that a fancy rendering of a product is indication that the product is ready to deliver. This is due mostly to project creators feeling that they need to offer the product as a reward or else people won't be willing to back. The whole concept of kickstarter is slowly getting perverted."
shittykickstarters,378ofo,FF0000it,10,Tue May 26 03:08:53 2015 UTC,"Yep, you've nailed it.   It'd certainly help if Kickstarter were to re-set people's expectations as to the purpose of the site, and the inherent risk involved in backing a project. It may be too late for that, but crowd-sourced funding is here to stay.   It would be really interesting to see what the project failure rate is site-wide. My 1% failure rate may be abnormal, but I really don't know.    people are still going to be angry when they didn't get what they expected   Yep, that's human nature. I was merely trying to bring some balance to this particular here since I saw several posts of the ""what a dumb idea, what kinda idiot would back this"" variety.   So... right here, it's this kinda idiot, one with an EE/Csc background with enough disposable income to collect vintage watches. :)"
shittykickstarters,378ofo,HuTheFinnMan,3,Tue May 26 03:17:14 2015 UTC,Someone posted here recently the failure rate on tech projects was sadly high and even the majority that delivered had very long delays.  I'll have to go searching to see if I can find a credible source. I am not sure how people track that sort of information as kickstarter generally consider a project successful as long as it got funded. I don't think it's in their interest to track projects and then publicly publish data on how many projects took money and didn't deliver.  There is certainly some types of kickstarter that are more prone to fail in delivery. Video game projects are notorious for this.

We're tossing a few dollars at people, and the expected gain is proportionatly smaller.  If you can't get that concept, my only guess is that you enjoy arguing word semantics.   I assure you if a company's investors turned up at a meeting to hear that the company pissed away 1 mil    They didn't ""piss away a mil"".  They accounted for every dollar. In fact the have the parts in storage to make all the watches."
shittykickstarters,378ofo,LukeTheFisher,-1,Tue May 26 14:24:35 2015 UTC,"Invest: expend money with the expectation of achieving a profit or material result  Got it. So it's investing when it's convenient because when a company fails miserably on kickstarter and backers are pissed, everyone screams out: ""you're not an investor, stop being so entitled"". Again: Investment, even as per your definition, implies return. I didn't say you'd get a part of the company. Point to where I said so. And thanks for downvoting discussing you fucking idiot."
shittykickstarters,378ofo,FF0000it,2,Tue May 26 14:40:34 2015 UTC,"Again: Investment, even as per your definition, implies return.    And there is return, ostensibly the product if they complete it. And, as everyone knows, investment comes with risk. In the case of Kickstarter, it's the risk of them failing before making / fulfilling orders.   I didn't say you'd get a part of the company.   They guy above you, who you agreed with, did. You said: ""He's entirely right"".   And thanks for downvoting discussing you fucking idiot.   I didn't. Thanks for calling me a fucking idiot.    Edit: for the record, I didn't downvote AuMatar either."
shittykickstarters,378ofo,LukeTheFisher,0,Tue May 26 14:45:41 2015 UTC,"He was talking about angel investors in particular. I agreed with that and went off on a tangent with the word investor itself. Reading comprehension is not your strong point is it?  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_investor   An angel investor or angel (also known as a business angel or informal investor or angel funder) is an affluent individual who provides capital for a business start-up, usually in exchange for convertible debt or ownership equity.   TL;DR since you seem incapable of digesting more than one sentence at a time: I agreed with him on angel investors because he is right as the wiki page demonstrates and then went on to make another point entirely."
shittykickstarters,378ofo,FF0000it,2,Tue May 26 14:51:51 2015 UTC,"I put ""angel invest"" in quotes because clearly it's not the standard ""put a million bucks into someone and you get a slice of the company"".   The standard words we have for commerce just don't work with crowd funding. We need to adapt ones we have, or come up with new ones.  Purchase:  well, you're not, since the item in question doesn't exist yet, and there's no guarantee it will.  Pledge: I guess this is better, but again pledges don't usually come with strings attached. Yeah, we've sorta gotten used to that a bit through NPR and pledge drives where you get some swag in return, but that swag is guaranteed, and a kickstarted reward isn't.   If you have some better words to use, speak up. But declaring me ""a rube"" isn't productive conversation.  Edit: fixed typo"
shittykickstarters,378ofo,AuMatar,5,Tue May 26 14:52:53 2015 UTC,"No, calling you a rube is dead on.  You're giving money to a for profit entity with no promise of a return on investment.  That's a pretty stupid thing to do.  Until they start crowdfunding via bonds or stock, giving anyone a dime is ridiculous.  If you want a word for it, try ""donate"". Of course I prefer my donations go to charities that try to help things rather than a business that will make someone else money."

There's really no harm in celebrating female protagonists.  They're just looking to print a couple of coffee table books.  It's not a ""shitty"" kickstarter, but it is a tad lesser than it could be.  I think if they waited until they had the video to start and had some more recent art that was more representative of what would be in the book, they'd be in a better place.  I think we need to write up some rules for exactly what constitutes a ""shitty"" kickstarter.  I've been seeing far too many mediocre or even good kickstarters show up just because specific people disagree with them.  We need more shit like Quadrawolf and less shit like this."
shittykickstarters,37dsia,HuTheFinnMan,3,Tue May 26 23:17:52 2015 UTC,"I agree, there is a big difference between a poorly thought out or naive/delusional or outright scam kickstarter and something that you just personally think is a stupid idea.  Also last time a similar project was posted here all it did was attract people from both sides of the gamergate drama squad to come to this sub and downvote battle each other.

shittykickstarters,37dsia,7rode,4,Wed May 27 05:53:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we should probably have some sort of rule about that. Maybe not even a hard-and-fast rule, but a rule of thumb that if your main objection to a KS is its subject matter, it probably doesn't belong here."
shittykickstarters,37dsia,AuraTummyache,-1,Wed May 27 12:49:26 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's pretty fucking stupid. I like how you ""kind of like the idea"" because it has female characters though."
shittykickstarters,37dsia,perfectshitlord,3,Thu May 28 14:53:07 2015 UTC,"I think my beef is more with how this post approaches how this is a shitty kickstarter.  If they were to say this is shitty because it infringes on like 30 copyrights then they might be right.  I would disagree that it's ""shitty"" because ultimately the copyright violation is going to result in a run of the mill cease and desist after backers have received their copies, the illustrators will get a little cash and visibility and have to stop printing the books.  It's just not destructive enough to warrant a ""shitty"" title.  That should be reserved for things that are actively impacting the entire structure in a negative way.  Instead this post claims that it's ""shitty"" because (and I'm assuming here) they subjectively don't like the idea of an art book of specifically female video game characters.  Which, if that's the case, is nonsense."

We did believe (And still do) that we followed all rules, We removed the Photorealistic renders, We provided info on our team, an explicit demonstration of our prototype, we have been completely transparent (we can back everything up with documentation and provide formal company figures and contacts with everyone to validate our authenticity we have the CEO of TEDx, CEO of our display manufacturer, VP's of PCB design, CEO of our Material design and so on..)  We just do not understand. Comparing this time to our previous suspension, Kickstarter has not given any description why we have been suspended nor willing to tell us. Their last remark was:   ""Hello,   This is a message from Kickstarterâs Integrity team. Weâre writing to notify you that recent activity on your project triggered a review. This review uncovered evidence of one or more violations of Kickstarter's rules, which may include:  Because of this, your project has been suspended. All funding has been stopped and all transactions have been canceled. This cannot be undone. Backers have been sent a copy of this message as well.   We take the integrity of the Kickstarter system very seriously. We only suspend projects when we find strong evidence that they are misrepresenting themselves or otherwise violating the letter or spirit of Kickstarter's rules. As a policy, we do not offer comment on project suspensions beyond what is stated in this message.   Regards,   Kickstarter Integrity""   Please note how they haven't stated the violations and stated they don't have to provide this information.  They suspended the campaign exactly 6pm when their office closed for the week. They have not offered to supply us with an appeal like previous suspension. We know nothing more than what you guys do. We are still asking questions and waiting for their reply.  We are so sorry for putting you guys through all this you've been a great support, you guys were all amazing, in less than 1 day nearly 80K that was incredible. Thank you all for believing in us. We promise to you we have been 100% transparent with you guys.  We have not misrepresented ourselves or anything... Kickstarter even has my full passport and Student identification number (Since i study business) they can check through my university to verify that i am 100% who i say i am and who our team is. We believe there may be a miss understanding again... or possibly something we missed. However we are sorry.  We do believe this is just a deal breaker between Kickstarter, we can't seem to formulate any kind of solid relationship with them, we don't know if they have something against us. If they think we are fraudulent. Something about our campaign but i must be serious if they pulled it straight away with no description why. We don't know what's up. But we will get to the bottom of it.  We can ensure you we are 100% not fraudulent. If we were we would have not come to kickstarter (In the first place) or made the adjustments they've requested. We would have used fake Identification, Banking details (That don't fall back to us), gone to another platform used rendered images portraying them as real (Instead of selling our concept with no images like we did), not shown our faces on the campaign, also if we were fraudulent we wouldn't ask a billion dollar manufacturing company for their cutting edge technology and pay nearly $10,000 to build a prototype within two weeks. We don't understand what they believe we are.  We are strongly thinking of moving platform. To give the Wearable Smartphone concept one last try. Everything will be absolutely the same. Our 3 Years of work is not going down the drain.  Let us know what you guys think, we are very morally broken, some of our team is on the breaking point of giving up on Blu based on the amount of stress we have endure these past 3 years. We have given up a lot in our lives (Been fired from our jobs, almost kicked out of schools) to start something really great we thought the world might love. But like in business unexpected things always happens like it has the past 3 year.  Please don't see this as us decrementing Kickstarter and their name, we are doing the opposite, we believe in everything Kickstarter does and are too very annoyed by fraudulent crowdfunding campaigns, because things like this happen to honest people like us, just trying to get our company off the ground. Don't forget guys Kickstarter isn't doing this for themselves they're doing it for the best interest in protecting backers, which we strongly understand and follow.  We've loved your support. You guys are the best. Let us know.

But I think instead of showing that long (and boring) video with the rendered blu thing rotating, it is probably more effective and convincing to just show all the prototypes (even unfinished ones, failed ones) they made throughout the process. They apparently had shown the 3 prototypes on the campaign page. But why can't they just show the pieces somehow WORKING ( not just displaying some pre-set video ) without dat blur / out-focus. And maybe I was just paranoid, but when I looked at their the 3rd iteration video, I couldn't stop thinking about what was underneath the cloth.

There was no such thing as email or Facebook or Myspace or Twitter (and passwords)? A day in age where people were forced to be decent because they actually weren't able to hide from one another?    This makes abso-fucking-lutely no sense. In the days before cell phones and social networks it was MUCH easier to hide from people. Only way to be reached was a home phone number. Now they can stalk you on all your social media.    In the words of my nephew who is a senior in high school ""you don't understand how it is these days, social media has ruined any type of honest relationship kids can have these days. There aren't girls like there used to be in your day anymore.""   This is fucking bat shit crazy too because with social media it's FAR easier to see who a person is and to keep tabs on them.

If you're going to ask people for money for a project, you should put in the effort to come across as professional. Part of that is ensuring that your pitch doesn't have any spelling errors.

See: US, Australia, New Zealand, Canada (for the most part)  Also, it's worth noting that even though the US doesn't have some sort of universally spoken second language, at least a decent portion of the population speaks some sort of a second language.

Side note, the CST guys were veterans in the design and product development field and the project was even supported by IDEO.  So, now look back at the Blu, bookmark it and start laughing again in 2016, reading through the comments section. :)"
shittykickstarters,36u5f3,metarinka,4,Fri May 22 18:29:32 2015 UTC,"So, in the comments they're discussing how much it would cost to make a prototype, and they say:  ""But our device is a lot more complicated than say Pebble. To create something like pebble would cost $1,000 budget for a near final device. Their prototype from first campaign just used technology you can buy on Alibaba (e-ink display $1-$2 per unit).""  I think they have really misunderstood how expensive even prototyping a device can be.  They also make various claims about how they're not developing anything new, so they just need to pay for parts and labour and custom tooling for the outer case. They seem to be under the impression that this is how Apple develops phones too! I really do think that their friendly display manufacturer has really misled them on how device manufacturing works to get money out of them.  They think that they can use all the KS money for R&D, then get enough money in pre-orders with a 12-18 month delivery time for them to manufacture the KS pledges. Madness."
shittykickstarters,36u5f3,Yogbox,4,Sun May 24 08:32:05 2015 UTC,"Copied from YouTube   I would never scam using real credentials, such as is required to sign up to Kickstarter to become a creator. They ask for government credited identification which Kickstarters technology scans your identification that is then crossed checked over a multinational database. This is how Kickstarter get's is renown name over other crowdfunding companies, because they check for authenticity and make sure you're who you say you are. I would never tarnish my own reputation and be never employed again by any engineering firm in Australia to scam people. I believe in crowdfunding just like anyone else an am annoyed by frauds myself because it has made people disbelieve in honest people like my team and myself trying to get a project off the ground.   Once again, i can supply you with all my documentation regarding the project from, Vendors, Manufacturers, Government forms. I can contact people for you whom will vouch that we are authentic and who we say we are, CEO of display company, VP of flexible PCB company, CEO of materials company, CEO of TEDx Australia. I can provide it. I will even give you my personal phone number so you can call me. I believe in the technology and creating new things that are better and strongly dislike that you keep referring to us as a scam.   I know scam people they wouldn't even reply, they would just delete your message, but i am standing up to you because it gives me an opportunity to actually talk about who we are. We understand your concerns and where it comes from you are 100% within the right regarding crowdfunding history.  Yes, our device is flawed and i've used the wrong terminology ""Prototype"" it's actually a ""Proof of concept"". Most people miss the point, this is our concept in the most roughest phase, we are asking for funding to make it how we want at specification, fully flexible, using better materials, adding all the lightbars and features, have a glass primary layer. You have completely missed the point.  You are asking to see a final product and then you will believe that we're not scammers, if we had a final product in a state you would deem acceptable we wouldn't go to crowdfunding we would go directly to market.   Don't forget this prototype was built on a budget of $10,000 in 2 weeks, the rubber like material itself cost $2,000. You're asking to see our final product with a budget of $600,000 + with 12 Months today then you would believe us. We are proud about what we created. It's absolutely no where near what it will be, we need your help, not telling people that we're bad people.   We do honestly hope you will change your mind about us we have been 100% transparent with everyone, we are even breaking rules against our NDA's to give people the information about us they need. You're all important to us, we need all your help, just please don't categorize us with people who we don't want to be known as.  Best regards Durrell Pita CEO: Blu  e... wearblu@gmail.com p... +61478567399   And my first response   Maybe you do really believe in your product, but the tech just simply isn't plausible at the price range you're suggesting. I don't know how you intend on fulfilling hundreds or thousands of orders of the device when knowingly the money will be poured into development.   I would reconsider your campaign instead of promising people a product which only exists as a 3d animation and suggest that you would like to use the funding for development of such a product. I don't need to know about this information personally, but the Kickstarter community does. If you have all of these things lined up, show people that the technology is feasible and within the budget you are requesting. If said prototype is 10,000 dollars and it's only a piece of rubber and a flexible screen, I can't possibly see how you intend on shipping a product of the caliber you're describing.   It's not that the tech would never be possible, but under your budget and timeframe, you're going to let people down. Show us the battery that's flexible AND holds more than 25mAh. Show us the flexible touch screen.  I believe you are a real person, Kickstart does not require people to actually finish their product or deliver anything. However I can't stand by and just watch people pour money into something that's essentially vaporware. You admitted yourself that this is NOT a prototype. So stop calling it that. Revise your Kickstarter or show people better proof that this product can actually exist and maybe you won't keep getting shut down.   Look at this Kickstarter - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1655017763/cst-01-the-worlds-thinnest-watch  It's a simple bit of technology (way more simple than what you're trying to accomplish) and they are struggling to produce their product in mass. Don't tell me your product will be any easier to produce, because you're wrong. You either know you're wrong and you're a scammer, or your're completely blind to the reality of production and what it will actually take to make a product described by your campaign.    His second response   +MaximumHamburgers Hello, You made great points of addition for us in our campaign, thank you, we will note it down and makes some changes suggested. We did have a more detailed plan incorporated into our campaign, but we hired a marketer to review what we did he told us to:  ""remove any extra details. People don't want to know about how you're going to make the product but what they get out of it.""  We knew he was wrong, that people need reassurance based on the platform we are going to Kickstarter.   Yes, you are correct all the way in your reply. Yes our device would no where near be easier than the Kickstarter you have posted here absolutely not. But we can't objectively comment on them, we don't know their suppliers and manufacturers capabilities we can only state from our POV for our product and manufacturers. Our display manufacturer is a 78 billion dollar company that has over 100 engineers and they are know to be the best flex display manufacturer all over the industry. That saying we know they have the capabilities and infrastructure in place to supply fulfillment. Kickstarter fulfillment would only be 1000 - 2000 devices. Our manufacturer can supply lots up to 15,000 per run.   We have a detailed discussion on our budget on Kickstarter, people there are now aware of our business strategy.   We do not know why we were removed from Kickstarter this time, they did not state why unlike last time just annouced ""We don't have to comment further"". We were removed the first time because we were using photorealistic renders when one of their support members told us it was acceptable, then we later found out that he was wrong. They apologised for that. This time we have no idea.   Thank you for your very detailed comment, this is a learning process for us, we truly thank you for taking your time to provide us with some help. This means a lot!   If you have any other suggestions, please, feel free to contact me, we need all the help we can get.   Best regards Durrell Pita CEO: Blu"

We already knew about the accusation that Benson did this, and if you check the backer list, you can see a string of almost 200 people with Chinese names who have no profile information and have never backed another project. AristScam has now obtained chat logs from October where Benson tells people he'll send private refunds if they back the project and leave positive comments."

No renderings, no mockups with CG fill-ins or other bullshit.  I want to see the working prototype that all the others will be made from.    What a bunch of shady shit bags.  But then again, you have to wonder how many of these 'highly successful' projects have the same thing going on behind the scenes.  Hey tech media who glowingly reviewed the project, who cares how much they raised (stole) from backers... did they actual deliver what they promised?"

shittykickstarters,36knq6,HuTheFinnMan,3,Wed May 20 14:51:49 2015 UTC,"This probably isn't the best place for me to rant but reading this just made me angry and I need to vent.  First of all video games are not a product that gets stamped out in a factory. There is no reason at all to think games should get cheaper over time. The main cost of making a video game is labour, specifically skilled labour. The annual average salary in the video game industry is over $80,000. Big title games often have hundreds of people working on them, often for years at a time. Right away you have multimillion dollar wage costs, and on top of that the cost of running the actual studios the game devs work in. All the costs involved in actually getting a game to market, the testing, advertising, manufacturing, all the sales and support.  Every year games get more complex, more detailed, and this takes more artists more time to generate the content that consumers expect from modern games. Games should naturally increase in cost, not go down.  Then we have this increasing trend of shitting all over any major game release by people who have no idea what it takes to make a game. Yeah sure some big game studios have earned a bad reputation for themselves lately. But you know what, the people actually making the games are some of the most talented and dedicated at what they do. These people are programming cutting edge graphics, physics, AI and all sorts of game play mechanics. The artists are insanely talented, look at how good most modern AAA games look these days. I know people who work in the game industry and during crunch time they are pulling 14+ hour work days to try and meet deadlines. When shit ends up rushed or buggy or the DRM is shitty or the online servers can't meet the demands of day-1 stress... I guarantee you the people who actually make the games are just as disappointed as the customers.  The big studios put major pressure on the actual devs, deadlines are often locked in and must be met even when the product isn't finished. A lot of the time this is all budgeted before the game even begins getting made, and for all the reasons I mentioned above, any extra time it takes to make a game really eats into the budget.  Then we get all these morons who have absolutely no idea what goes into making a game, crapping all over even the most trivial of faults. Everyone thinks they can do better themselves, with little or no budget and then give the game away for free. Well good luck with that.  Go make your massive open world with detailed lifelike realistic graphics and complex gameplay. See how that turns out. You always know these idiots have zero experience because even spending a single week trying to produce just one simple game asset and you realise how long it would take for one person to make an entire game."
shittykickstarters,36knq6,HuTheFinnMan,1 point,Wed May 20 14:50:26 2015 UTC,"He does know that plenty of companies are selling games cheaper than $60 right?  Also that the price of a game in a store is set BY that store, not by the publisher?  Also that games on other online stores are contractually obliged not to undercut places like GameStop?  He lacks a basic understanding of how pricing works, on top of suggesting something that most companies are already doing.

shittykickstarters,36hvar,exclamationmarek,9,Tue May 19 14:34:08 2015 UTC,"Quick roundup:   No working prototype Obviously Flexible Funding with a low $65k target Planed delivery in 7 months, pretty soon for a piece of hardware Promised 3 day battery life. That's 3x more than most smartwatches, yet the ReVault is supposed to use WiFi apart from Bluetooth Low Energy - the very energy efficient wireless protocol that made wearables with more than 1h battery possible in the first place. Their twitter account has 6k of both followers and following. Looks like a farmed and bought account, that's bad marketing practice Speaking of marketing practice, they used some very expensive equipment to record their Indiegogo pitch They have a referral offer - make 5 people order one of these to get one for free. I think I never saw a honest campaign that had a referral program like this and delivered the product o_O Please correct me if I'm wrong."
shittykickstarters,36hvar,HuTheFinnMan,3,Tue May 19 14:46:14 2015 UTC,I lack the personal knowledge and experience to be able to know for sure how unrealistic this kickstarter is. I did a very quick bit of google research and found some information but nothing conclusive.  The watch doesn't seem to do anything more than other ones I found for sale on alibaba for around $40-$50 a piece. I am no engineer but it seems like the product has realistic features besides the battery life perhaps as you say.  Googling some of the people shown to be working on the team they have some serious qualifications and work for major companies. Now on one hand that gives a sense of confidence but on the other hand it's almost a little suspicous.  They have great marketing (even if questionable ethics) but no real technical information or evidence of a working product as you say. There is a real lack of details of what the kickstarter money is actually paying for and in what stage of development they are in.  I'm really not sure on this one. I need people smarter than me to take a proper look and see if there is any solid evidence whether this is legit or not
shittykickstarters,36hvar,emorling,0,Tue May 19 16:42:59 2015 UTC,"I would be surprised to find any watches on Alibaba in stainless steel, with color screen, and 32GB of memory with the following feature set: * Auto-backup of documents from Android, IOS, OSX, Windows, and Linux * Auto-sync of documents to nearby devices * File restore * Media streaming * Notifications  If you find a link to this on Alibaba, please share. It would make my eyes fall out. :)"
shittykickstarters,36hvar,HuTheFinnMan,3,Wed May 20 18:23:27 2015 UTC,I'm not going to look through hundreds of thousands of watches on alibaba to try and find one with identical features. I don't know if you missunderstood what I was saying but I was in fact defending your device as something that is technically feasable. I also pointed out the strength of the team you have.  I understand why you would want to try and defend your product but you must realise that there have been so many poorly conceived and some blatantly fraudulent kickstarters that the entire crowdunding system has come under scrutiny and skepticism.  You have a very slick marketing presentation but there was a lack of some technical details as well as a clear demonstration of a working prototype. This is often a sign of an amature or fraudulent kickstarter.  We don't wish to slander genuine kickstarters here but you only have to look at how many bad ones there are to see why people are so skeptical. It is getting very hard to trust any crowd funding projects these days and sometimes the genuines get caught in the negative feelings that are created by the bad ones.  I wish you the best with your project.

shittykickstarters,36hvar,emorling,5,Wed May 20 21:47:43 2015 UTC,"Hi, Elia here from the ReVault team to answer questions and make clarifications. The product is a result of crowdsourced feedback from over 2000 people. Our community has helped us with all aspects of the product, such as features, design, name, logotype, branding and marketing. The process has been extremely open and well documented in our blog http://revault.io/blog   We do have a working prototype for internal testing purposes, and the Beta with external users starts in September We wanted to do fixed funding, but that would have prohibited us to accept PayPal and stripe payments (Indiegogo rules). That's why we made the hard decision to go with flexible funding We are 16 people working on this project for 7 months, and the setup costs (tooling) are already covered. Hence the low target We use both WiFi and Bluetooth low energy I have myself grown the twitter account from the ground up, and if you do an audit you will find we don't have an army of fake followers It's true that the pitch is shot in Red by a local production company The Refer 5 and get 1 for free campaign is up and running   Let me know if you have any further questions."
shittykickstarters,36hvar,maximumhamburgers,3,Wed May 20 18:11:43 2015 UTC,How about a video of a prototype. Not that difficult. Excuses are excuses. You either have it or you don't.

shittykickstarters,36hvar,emorling,2,Tue May 19 16:00:34 2015 UTC,"The idea they pitch is to have this done locally, so you don't use your transfer cap in your cell phone data plan, and you get wi-fi speeds, instead of LTE speed. It's not a bad idea, there are some people who might want to use this.  But I can already see a lot of problems they will certainly encounter."
shittykickstarters,36hvar,pug_bomb,3,Tue May 19 16:05:37 2015 UTC,"Smartphones have wifi and bluetooth, and that does not use up your data plan. So it could still be just an app.    EDIT: Smartphones could be even better because you could also plug them in with USB to speed up syncing."

shittykickstarters,36hvar,jcpb,1 point,Tue May 19 20:43:29 2015 UTC,"Smartphones do have Wifi, Bluetooth and memory. However they are easily misplaced and dropped, that's why our backers value the possibility to strap it to the body for extra security. Auto-backup on-the-go makes sense, because that's when you are most likely to lose a device (and any fresh data stored on it). For this to practical it should be easy to carry, hence worn.   We also found that many in our community expressed that they wanted to boost the memory they had on their phones.  I am not stating that these are reasons for you, but they are the reasons our own community members give."
shittykickstarters,36hvar,_Xaver,2,Wed May 20 18:22:19 2015 UTC,"Seriously, I cannot tell if this is a scam or legit.  IndieGoGo flex funding and no working prototype (those shown at the end appear to be mockups) is a red flag, but they seem to have already collected a great deal of feedback and tweaks. The whole thing can be realistically done (no Ritot pseudo-science here), maybe the battery life will be ridiculous wrt the promised 3 days.  Seven months might be a reduced timeframe, but not that much if they have a production line already in place and are just waiting for the money to repay it and start the conveyors.  Probably it's just oversold and might fail miserably, but it's not a scam upfront."
shittykickstarters,36hvar,crashdown77,2,Tue May 19 17:25:01 2015 UTC,The rewards where they offer reseller packs from 2x to 10x is something I've seen on a lot of scam crowdfunding projects as well.

Also your name is Paul and you start by rescuing a girl and bringing her to your bunker.  He often just breaks off while talking and stares to the side in silence, I think the video was supposed to be cut at certain points.  He says that he needs the money for software aquisition and building a community, maybe he didn't have video editing software.

It's important to note, in the regard, the guy shouldn't give up.  Kickstarter just isn't the place to fund a company from literally the ground up.  As shit as it is, and I know because I'm a developer myself, miracles like this unfortunately do not happen.  It's totally unfair in a personal sense, but you do have to get some concrete cash flow in and pour some effort into something in your own time before people regard you as worth spending money on.  Otherwise, there's nothing separating people who have a cool idea from people who are able to execute cool ideas.  The majority of these shit game kickstarters are people who have an idea and are willing to do the work to bring that idea to life, but you've got to prove it somehow.  Most of the time, that means getting a job that you might fucking hate in order to live or living with your parents and making that game and 10 other games from your blood, sweat, and tears before someone notices.

There's skill involved in convincing a large number of people to willingly separate themselves from one of the things they value the most in their life - i.e. their money - and I admit that I find it fascinating.  For a while, I thought Arist was a good scam. They kept themselves just below the line of obviousness, at the precise point where you can still keep most of those willing to give you money eager without disgruntling enough of the others badly enough that the whole scam collapses.  But then they started to get desperate. I was wondering why they hadn't yet run with the money, and it was explained to me that they needed to delay the collapse until the credit card companies won't chargeback, potentially as long as six months, so they made up excuses that didn't hold water. The scam started to creak, and with it my admiration.  Then they resorted to increasingly absurd stratagems, culminating in the ""OMG they hacked us!!1!"" thing. I was surprised: could it really be that this entire thing had not been a result of an elaborate plan to swindle people, but just an ill-conceived project by a bunch of naive hopefuls? One that just happened to gather enough steam to convince them that they had more to gain by keeping up the pretense than by giving up, once they'd realized there was no way to bring it to reality - and that they'd managed to keep from sinking not out of cunning malice but out of sheer luck?  And then this happens, and whatever was left of my lingering admiration has vanished. Legal attacks to detractors, especially if badly written and even more especially if they include personal threats, have historically been a surefire sign that whoever's making them is not smart at all, otherwise they would never resort to methods that can so easily backfire.   At this point it's obvious: there is no cunning here, no elaborate malice. There's just a bunch of morons who have found themselves in a good position to game the system, had a decent start, but then completely squandered the resources they had available to achieve the scam and are now grasping at straws.  It will be fun to watch them burn."

If they started out with a scam, the scam was too successful, then they naively said ""hey, this would be a great business and obviously we're geniuses so maybe we can make it work"", then through naivete and  incompetence they wasted a golden opportunity (although not really because no one could have made work with all their absurd promises)."

A local start-up ""smart"" coffee machine maker that has won a government-backed award is facing a backlash from online financial supporters for production delays and a lack of updates on the progress of its project.  Backers who have collectively given US$850,000 via crowdfunding website Kickstarter say they are suspicious of Nbition Development Ltd's failure to provide a video showing its Arist creation in action as proof of its promised capability to brew barista-standard coffee at home.  Nbition said it had produced two videos to backers' specifications, but that its applications for patents would be at stake if it revealed too much.  Releasing images of Arist ahead of securing the patents would put the firm's intellectual property rights at risk, Nbition founder Benson Chiu said.  The company had offered refunds after it delayed shipping of Arist from August to October, saying it had to tweak the design.  ""[The criticism] did not affect our progress,"" Chiu said. ""We are still on track on our new shipping dates and we are willing to refund. That is a very big sign we are not fake.""  Nbition won the 2015 Best ICT Start-up Grand Award for Arist, which is operated through a phone app and learns users' tastes and habits.  More than 3,000 coffee machines, each costing US$299, had been ordered through Kickstarter, with a further 25,000 ordered directly from the company.  Minnesota graduate student Jake Moroshek put down US$299 for a machine in November but had become concerned if he would get his money's worth.  ""They had a very slick marketing video. My girlfriend needed a coffee machine, so I figured it would be an innovative and affordable option,"" Moroshek said.  He began to have misgivings when fellow backers made negative comments last month. ""One of the biggest doubts about the Arist is that they promised a ton of features which physically wouldn't fit in the shell they have promised.""  Chiu demonstrated Arist for the South China Morning Post, using an iPhone app to produce two espressos. His company had applied for three patents, he said, and was preparing to submit three more applications.  It could take several months to obtain a short-term patent, which protected inventions for eight years, said Alice Lee, a specialist in intellectual property and associate law dean at the University of Hong Kong. An application for a standard patent, lasting 20 years, could take up to two years to be granted, Lee said.  This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as Trouble brewing over delays in delivering 'smart' coffee machine"

They supply deionized water that is very pure and not electrically conductive, the copper part that is going is an EDM (electro discharge machining) sinker die, basically current is passed between the die and the part and it works kind of like battery and little bits of metal are removed from the base material, hence the smoke and little bit of arcing you can see.  Here's a video of an EDM sinker die https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2njSX52SQo and here's wiki http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_discharge_machining  EDM is very precise and is often used in mold making as it's one of the few ways to get a very precise square or odd shaped cavity in a part.

Many of you have noticed our lack of comments in the past two weeks. Due to an inaccurate report with statements of a defamatory nature disseminating false information about our company in the local media, we have been busy handling inquiries from over 20 different media outlets. Weâve had to spend considerable time, about 2 hours per media, to cater to them when they visited and also showed demos of our machine. We did not mean to ignore your questions, but I was overtaxed and the other members of the team were busy working on the Arist.    Yep, 40 hours spent with the media and nobody published anything because Arist is so squeaky clean. /s  They've also started giving refunds to all their vocal critics to prevent them from commenting on Kickstarter.  http://aristscam.com/arist-gave-me-a-refund/    Edit: It gets better. Arist have pushed refunds to basically all the backers who were vocal about asking questions in the comments, including $1 backers. Benson is flat out denying they gave refunds to anyone even though you can easily see almost everyone who was critical of them recently is no longer listed as a backer in their profile. He later claims they were all mysteriously removed from the project without receiving refunds.  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/236195807/arist-brews-coffee-like-the-best-baristas-anytime/comments?cursor=9897517#comment-9897516  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/236195807/arist-brews-coffee-like-the-best-baristas-anytime/comments?cursor=9899076#comment-9899075    Edit 2: Benson is very active in the Kickstarter comments today, ignoring questions about the project and making personal attacks against backers.

He's also singling out one backer for the irreparable ""damage"" he caused to the project that might cause it to fail. Hilarious.

shittykickstarters,368ds6,Jeffmanni,9,Sun May 17 19:13:54 2015 UTC,"The most recent post on Aristscam.com about refunding critical / vocal backers to silence them and then pretending that it was KS that removed them for bad conduct is not surprising once you review the tactics that have been used throughout that project over time (including the project's creator pretending to be a backer in order to intimidate vocal critics but stupidly making that post as the creator). I believe the current attempt to silence backers is a direct result of the immediately preceding post on Aristscam.com - IMHO that post is the money shot and it's not getting the attention it deserves - that prior post is likely the real reason why the creator suddenly dropped all the vocal and critical backers: he realized that once backers focused on that post the creator would have no reasonable explanations to offer and, as they say, the jig would be up. This prior Aristscam post shows that only three months prior launching his KS campaign the creator sent out an Instagram showing he was then in the early stages of hacking a Jura (I say ""early stages"" because it appears to be an amateurish rats nest of tangled wires and piece meal circuit boards which looks more like a pre-hack than an actual reputable hack such as the one shown in the Youtube done by someone else several years earlier). In his Instagrams the creator proclaimed ""The LED is lit!"" and ""Ever since 2006 and my C63 & C85 coursework, I haven't thought I would touch hardware again. It reminded me that computers are 1010 (binary)."" His posts and statements show this was very early work and in which the creator admitted he had no actual hardware experience other than some coursework many years before. Regardless, only three months later the creator promised all KS backers that he had developed a working prototype of a state of the art espresso machine that not only had loads of features other machines didn't have but even more unbelievably it was also much smaller and priced much lower (even at projected retail price). So I think the real story here is that the creator's own Instagram posts provide the best documentation yet that they probably didn't have a working prototype when their KS campaign was launched. This revelation must have really freaked out the creator because there is simply no way to explain away his Instagram posts - if you really were  designing and building a state of the art espresso machine which was intended to obsolete existing consumer machines and you were trying to do that with a small team on a limited budget and do it for a KS launch which was only 3 months away its simply inconceivable you would be wasting your time amateurishly hacking what appears to be a smartphone interface to the very machine it was your focus was to obsolete!"
shittykickstarters,368ds6,plonce,5,Sun May 17 21:00:05 2015 UTC,Not to mention that's around when they were supposedly shipping 1000 beta units to baristas under NDAs.
shittykickstarters,368ds6,crazyhankie,4,Sun May 17 21:38:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had that in there but took it out because the post was already too long - including the fact that they claimed the 1000 beta machines were hand built! - and why would 1000 people even buy a beta machine from an unknown startup that didn't demo hadn't demoed it at coffee conventions or have units sent in for reputable review on coffee or consumer appliance related web sites."

They claim Benson was ""inspired by the Arist engineers"" and decided to tinker with a Jura in his spare time, completely separate from the project. And then they put his tinkerings in the Artist promotional video. Or something. Uh huh.   No mention of those mysterious 1000 units or why they keep denying any refunds have been issued.

It's pretty obvious they were forced to say something that ridiculous because there simply are no rational explanations. What is really funny is they apparently think that is a perfectly reasonable explanation. They seem to live in a reality distortion field - explanations that apparently makes sense to them makes no sense to anyone else - it's been that way from the beginning. I've never seen legitimate a startup before behave this way. The only times I've come across a combination of pathological lying and extreme paranoia has been when doing due diligence for investments and those operations invariably turned out to be frauds."

shittykickstarters,368ds6,plonce,4,Mon May 18 00:47:54 2015 UTC,i had been under the impression that when projects messaged backers through kick-starter they didn't know their email (i've never seen the email of creators when they replied to my pm's). also i thought i had read that kick-starter only released personal info if they were required to do so for an investigation by authorities such as for wrongdoing. based on what i've read these guys come across as underhanded so i had wondered if they could have got your email under false pretense (could they have faked getting hacked as a way to get kick-starter to cough up personal info?). i don't know if its possible fabricate a trail to make it look like someone broke into to a web site in a way can be pinned on someone they wanted to target but they are software people so i imagine if anyone could do it they could. if there have been lies up to now don't underestimate they might be willing to lie more in order to target someone who exposed them to get revenge.

shittykickstarters,368ds6,Mastic_Chewing_Gum,5,Mon May 18 18:37:29 2015 UTC,"One fascinating thing about reviewing the comments on this project is the number of backers who have said ""well, maybe they didn't have a working machine when the launched their campaign but that's ok with me as long as they deliver"". Don't these people ever have ethical concerns, even when it effects the possibility they may be ripped off? It would be like me taking money from people for investment and telling them ""I'll invest this conservatively so you'll get a 3% return"" and then instead speculating with the money: if I win the speculative bets I keep the windfall and I give you 3% but if I lose the speculative bets I've lost nothing and you lose everything! Withholding information or telling lies to make the risk appear lower is false representation and fraud - it doesn't matter whether it is an investment or a Kickstarter. In KS if I tell you I have a fully working prototype and I do the risk of my delivering is far lower than if I tell you I have a working prototype but I don't. It's just not ok to tell people you've done something you haven't even if you intend to try to do it later because the risk is higher that it won't work out. Many people simply wouldn't have participated if you had told the truth up front."

However, those realtek wifi modules are quite cheap (something like this: http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Tablet-WIFI-module-Realtek-RTL8188ETV-10054/32248777098.html) which can be easily < $2 in large quantities, I am guessing they're buying the R8 SoM from allwinner directly (thats the thing with R8 + Flash). The AXP206 power management chip for  Axx series processors is also quite cheap in quantity. Is it worth the effort to do it at $9 pricepoint with BOM cost around $8 or more? To me, no, but I guess if they sell enough and have complementary items to go with it (HDMI board for example, which clearly doesn't ""cost"" $20 in parts), then maybe they'll break even.  Is it a scam? Probably not, and they will probably deliver, but it IS a really shit computer with single-core cortex-a, 800x480 video output (even through HDMI), etc etc, but there are uses even for such shit as long as it's $9 as advertised."

Not that I think this project will ever come to fruition but didn't they get some venture capital on top of the project funds?    BUT OMG This video...This watch is absolutely AMAZING....They've been able to break the laws of physics!!

shittykickstarters,361y8w,CallingYouOut2,3,Fri May 15 22:35:52 2015 UTC,"The point is, the device they're trying to sell is supposed to project the image on their hand from the wrist band. All they've done here is set-up a projector at a 90 degree angle to the back of their hand which allows for a wide beam of lite to hit the back of his hand, which anyone can do now! They don't show this supposed projector in the video for a reason. Whereas in reality (if this device was to actually work) it would be casting a very narrow beam of light on the back of his from a very very low angle. What does this mean? The slightest bend of the hand away means your projection is lost and you can't see it."

Oh yeah and 100 dollars is ridiculous."
shittykickstarters,3625qf,Thallassa,15,Fri May 15 13:48:48 2015 UTC,"The price highlights their biggest problem: this kind of device, in the sense of a cheap, long-lasting, sturdy phone, is already produced in mind-crushingly vast quantities at commodity prices by companies with enormous, well-established distribution chains. You can't compete with those firms on price and ubiquity.  If you want a credit-card-sized phone specifically, random Chinese OEMs as usual have dozens of crappy options to choose from; they'd have to count on someone caring enough about the design of their phone to stretch to their superior $100 version.  I like the idea of a service that forwards your calls from your existing number though - maybe they should focus on that, and sell the SIM cards. That will be enough of a challenge."
shittykickstarters,3625qf,BScatterplot,4,Fri May 15 14:50:35 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the service to forward calls already exists.   My mom has her landline and her cellphone linked (she's had them linked for YEARS - since 2005) so that if you call the landline and it's busy you get the cellphone. Or vice versa.

And I can't imagine it being hugely popular or people wanting to pay too much for it.  It would be awesome if it was done as an interative VR experience with photogrammetry or laser geo surveying equipment to capture the places in 3d.

If he's serious about it, he should try to get a partnership with some indie developer rather than buy his way to this.  In a way, Igarashi's kickstarter is rather shitty to begin with (not his project itself, but how he organized it).  First, there's this backer exclusive content (a weapon and an optional boss). Like an extreme pre-order exclusive at a $60 tier. It's shitty for big AAA games, no reason this would not be here too.  Then those ""design"" rewards, that are a trend in kickstarted games, and a very bad one in my opinion. ""You've got a bunch of money? Let's get you an opportunity to mess with our game!"". Even when it's on a small level, nothing screams ""we don't have a serious plan for a cohesive game"" more than this to me.  The worse case ever of this being Molyneux's Godus. Surprise! Let's give design decisions for our crowdfunded project to someone who won our unrelated-looking lottery game. It's rather hilarious that the guy had absolutely no interest in videogames apart from shitty mobile idle games."

shittykickstarters,35opzc,otidder,15,Tue May 12 07:13:30 2015 UTC,$600K would've been a modest budget for a game back when FF Tactics game out on the PSX. For a modern 3D project it's really far too low. I'd agree with the assessment that they pitched low for publicity reasons; they have too much experience for it to be down to incompetence.
shittykickstarters,35opzc,averynicehat,10,Tue May 12 09:47:37 2015 UTC,This should have been 2D.  The fact that it is in 3D actually kills a lot of the appeal for me.
shittykickstarters,35opzc,RobotFolkSinger,5,Tue May 12 14:28:11 2015 UTC,That's the biggest thing that strikes me about all these shitty game kickstarters.  Making anything more than an hour-long 2D sidescroller takes a lot of time and money to produce. You have to have developers and artists and designers and pay them salaries. But so many people think they can make the CoD killer in six months for $100k.
shittykickstarters,35opzc,HuTheFinnMan,19,Tue May 12 16:57:24 2015 UTC,"I work with one of the publicly available game engines and it is a running joke on the forums. CoD killer is too easy though, template looks like this:  1) Person almost always under the age of 20 with no prior experience or skills.  2) Create cool sounding game studio name, call yourself CEO of said studio.  3) Start a recruitment thread on game engine forum asking people to help make the game for you. Offer no upfront pay. Payment is always in royalties from sales of awesome game.  4) Post stolen concept art claiming that is what your game will look like.  5) Search internet/harrass other devs for free game assets, then start multiple threads asking how to get said assets working in game engine.  6) Game must consist of one or all of the following elements:  a- MMO. Obligatory ignorance of how to get their complex game world and mechanics to work online.  b- RPG with unlimited sandbox elements, you should be able to do anything and everything you can imagine in game.  c- Zombie/survival horror.  d- Giant open world map (bigger the better).  e- Random concepts taken from other existing games that they happen to like.  7) Game will be completed in a few weeks/months. How hard could it be?  8) Multiple posts on game engine forums asking how to do basic things. Complain and get mad and blame the game engine devs when making awesome game turns out to be more difficult than expected."
shittykickstarters,35opzc,Narayume,5,Wed May 13 00:36:18 2015 UTC,"600k for a game with that level of quality graphics is just not going to happen. They likely now don't have the nerve to face the music, especially as the money has been spent and there is not much to show for it. Giving money to a KS campaign is similar to investing  - if you want to see returns you need to see if the project proposal is realistic. This one wasn't. Yeah, it sucks, but KS isn't a pre-order service."
shittykickstarters,35opzc,SpikeRosered,3,Tue May 12 23:03:29 2015 UTC,"Videogames are probably the riskiest investment out of all kickstarters.   I've been lucky and out of the 10 or so kickstarters I've backed all have come through or look like they are going to. (Card game, stuffed animal, tabletop rpg book, animated shorts for an already established youtube cartoon, to name a few)  The one videogame I backed that isn't from an established developer is essentially a visual novel which is about as easy to program as a game gets. Thus I am confident they will deliver and haven't yet to be given any reason to think they will not.  So my advice, make sure the game has either a name/real experience or looks easy to make."
shittykickstarters,35opzc,Tensuke,1 point,Tue May 12 17:36:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think every game I've kickstarted has come through or I have reason to believe it eventually will (besides interstellar marines,  which I backed for lulz and knew would never get funded). It's not really that hard to spot which creators are really serious about delivering. It kind of surprises me about Unsung Story given their history, but I imagine it's just coming along much slower than they imagined."
shittykickstarters,35opzc,erfindung,15,Sun May 17 21:15:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know how many times people have to be burned by kickstarter before they realize that they should never give their money to strangers on the internet. Hell, even when products are actually finished sometimes they end up being broken in some way.  Do some succeed? Yes, of course. But then some succeed and still become the OUYA and you have no one to blame but yourself for buying into they hype of an unfinished product with no guarantee that it'll ever be finished."
shittykickstarters,35opzc,BerserkOlaf,33,Tue May 12 08:25:52 2015 UTC,"I think what more people should realize about kickstarter is that they're always taking a risk. This is not a normal retailer/consumer relationship.  I have pledged on a few projects, most were late, a few were disappointing. That's ok, I knew what I was signing for.  Hopefully some will get good (a few are already very promising).  I would never have pledged for the Ouya, because this was clearly a bad idea from start. If Nintendo has problems getting developer support on their consoles, your shitty android device is doomed."
shittykickstarters,35opzc,RealTimeCock,3,Tue May 12 10:48:45 2015 UTC,"I can tell you that late is the absolute worst I've ever experienced. Maybe I'm lucky, but doing your research really helps before you back.  (Disclaimer: I've only ever backed electronics.)"
shittykickstarters,35opzc,BerserkOlaf,4,Tue May 12 14:43:02 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%, a critical approach is important to minimize the risk but it's still there.  I have mostly pledged on video games. They are slowly delivering, a few just fail at being good. I didn't pledge a fortune on them, so I'm a bit disappointed but not really angry."
shittykickstarters,35opzc,RealTimeCock,4,Tue May 12 15:04:08 2015 UTC,I would describe steam the same way sometimes.

shittykickstarters,35opzc,stijnhommes,3,Tue May 12 19:15:09 2015 UTC,"It's not really about how many projects you back, but more about the process by which you choose what to back and what not. I've backed 77 projects. None of them failed to deliver yet.  I'm not saying it's not going to happen at some point, but I do my best to limit the risk involved. If I see someone trying to make a big 3D game for $100.000, you can be sure I won't be backing it unless they can clarify their budget and convince me it's doable."
shittykickstarters,35opzc,HuTheFinnMan,1 point,Tue May 12 20:44:43 2015 UTC,I think its just starting to become a reality now. Some of the bigger failed projects have dragged on for years and it's taken a long time for even the most stubborn backers to admit defeat.  It's interesting that some of the biggest and worst shitty kickstarters were called out at the very beginning yet people threw sometimes millions of dollars at them anyway. The blind faith of some backers is baffling.
shittykickstarters,35opzc,FireReadyAim,-2,Wed May 13 01:00:06 2015 UTC,I think some people are a lot less poor than you are.  It's fun to support projects that I think are interesting.  I don't need guarantees and I'm not going to get buttmad if they don't succeed.

shittykickstarters,35ojsm,Hadrosauroidea,4,Tue May 12 06:36:13 2015 UTC,"Hmm there seems to be very few free energy projects on KS recently.

shittykickstarters,35ojsm,Gusfoo,3,Tue May 12 13:08:51 2015 UTC,"Yes. They are powering the fans from a bank of batteries and allege that they are extracting more energy than is being put in. I suspect that they just don't understand it's the RMS of an AC output that is important, not the peak."
shittykickstarters,35ojsm,autowikibot,3,Tue May 12 16:15:22 2015 UTC,"Root mean square:       The root mean square (abbreviated RMS or rms), also known as the quadratic mean in statistics is a statistical measure defined as the square root of the mean of the squares of a sample.   In physics it is a value characteristic of a continuously varying quantity, such as a cyclically alternating electric current, obtained by taking the mean of the squares of the instantaneous values during a cycle. This is the effective value in the sense of the value of the direct current that would produce the same power dissipation in a resistive load.  An electric current of given magnitude produces the same heating regardless of the direction of current flow; squaring the quantity measured ensures that alternation of sign does not invalidate the result.   It can be calculated for a sequence of discrete values, or for a continuously varying function. The name is simply a description: the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of the samples. It is a particular case of the generalized mean, with exponent 2.

shittykickstarters,35oork,HuTheFinnMan,6,Tue May 12 10:23:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah thats originally how it was meant to work. You give someone a donation because you think they have a good idea and want to see it become a reality. The concept works as long as the backers realise the money is given out of altruism and don't expect to be guaranteed anything in return.  Except now most kickstarters offer some sort of end product as a reward for backing, effectively turning it into a shitty online store where you pay for a product before it has even been made. The project failing and not being able to provide the promised rewards is when the real shit starts to flow."
shittykickstarters,35m2vc,indieRuckus,15,Mon May 11 16:56:25 2015 UTC,"So, the point of the game is mainly jacking around with whatever random wonky crap I put into the game.   FUCKING SOLD"

I remember having serious doubts that Evermore would really happen when I first heard about it.  This transition might be a good way to scale down the idea to its most interesting component, or it might be a way of keeping things going once it was clear that Evermore was not going to happen.  Hard to say.   Personally I'd love to see realistic footage of what they have now instead of the promo-reel that they are showing.

For example Chrome no longer supports plugins like Unity3d, so any browser game made with it no longer works for chrome users You can unintentionally break a patent or infringe on someone's copyright. It not that common in the video game industry, but it happens You may experience licensing issues if you are reckless with using tools and plugins. Some may have very specific license agreements that you might have overlooked Development may take a lot longer than planed, and cost a lot more If your game is based on something truly unique like an original gameplay mechanic, someone might get to market before you with a better implementation of that unique idea A concept that works good ""on paper"" or even in a prototype game may be difficult to scale to a full-sized project to keep the players engaged for longer and make the experience worth the price of the game Post-release support may be difficult for some platforms. You might get issues with people using a specific phone, or users having monitors with less typical aspect ratios, old graphics cards or outdated operating systems.

shittykickstarters,35bbgd,DontMentionLobsters,8,Fri May 8 21:22:36 2015 UTC,"I am a game developer (Road Redemption), and I can tell you that the biggest risk they have is the programmer quitting.  When your programmer isn't devoted to the project, he's likely to leave if the going gets tough or he gets a better job offer.    For Road Redemption, the company's owners (myself and 3 others) are either programmers or artists.  If any one of our employees leave, we're capable of finishing the game ourselves.  Intellectual property lawsuits (mentioned a couple times below) are almost never occur, unless you're obviously using other people's characters (making your own Pokemon game, for instance)."
shittykickstarters,35bbgd,ifisch,5,Sat May 9 02:40:30 2015 UTC,"You might be unable to publish your own game on many platforms. Becoming a developer for the major 3 consoles (Sony/Microsoft/Nintendo) & Steam has become drastically easier over the past 5 or so years, but programs like ID@Xbox and Greenlight still take a whole lot of effort from your end to get into, which you can't really guarantee. Some of the contracts may be a little unfair; ID@Xbox only weakened their parity clause a few months ago. And if you want to publish on those platforms, there's a variety of certification tests you'll need to pass. Those tend to cost money for each attempt and can be incredibly picky with things like ""you can't display an entirely frozen screen for longer than a period of 2 seconds"" or ""you must display the <console> logo centered on screen for a period of 3 seconds during startup"". Failing multiple rounds of certification can be really expensive. Data loss issues. Your house goes on fire, can you continue or did you just waste a whole year of work with nothing to show for it? If you're only planning on self-publishing on PC (selling on your own website), how do you intend to handle payments? Payment disputes can cost you serious chunks of money, and depending on how you handle things, those could be semi-frequent. All of the things mentioned by other users, of course."

shittykickstarters,35bbgd,crazyheckman,20,Fri May 8 20:43:34 2015 UTC,"It's not TERRIBLE and they are asking for a pretty reasonable sum of money.  They're really just looking for a Unity Pro license, which they don't really NEED to have, since this probably won't make over $100k and the splash screen is the least of their worries.  This video though, it comes off as the most pretentious thing I've ever seen.  When you tell people ""Look at these stunning visuals with their vibrant colors and the astonishing level of animation."" you open yourself up to a WORLD of criticism.    To be honest, this art is not that exceptional.  It doesn't make itself stand out from any other game.  The gameplay looks slow and monotonous and the upgraded weapons just seem unnecessary.  If I were to take a guess, these guys fell into the same trap that I've seen so many other game dev friends fall into.  They're looking at the app store and seeing games that appeal to everyone and figuring if they copy that, they'll be set to make whatever they want.  I seriously doubt this is someone's fucking Opus, so I've got no idea why they are hammering in how next gen and innovative it's going to be.  It very obviously is not any of those things."

Apparently she keeps adding more and more twitter users and wants to make a second deck? There are decks that are just art, and some that are actually meant for playing? She basically just hastily threw together a campaign around feminism because she knew that would get her backers despite her skill as an artist.

Many Kickstarters I've backed have taken a good while to make good on their reward promises, especially if they got a lot more money than they originally asked for. And ""nitpicking for sensationalism"" isn't really a thing when what you're doing is illustrating an idea. You kind of have to pick something that specifically illustrates your point, else you're just wasting people's time. It's not sensationalist to say ""here's what I think is a problem and here's an example where it's used"". With regards to stealing artwork I only heard about one girl complaining about her fanart being used, which isn't great but not really something that warrants the harassment she's been facing."

It's important that young women learn they too can grow up to pander, beg for donations, fail to do the work you promise, and make threats against your own person when donation faucet turns from a torrent into a mild trickle.   THAT'S how we empower women, just like it has always been done. Remember the old stand-bys of the civil rights movement: bitching on the internet about man-spreading, comic book covers, and stylized bowling shirts? Forget about female genital mutilation, acid attacks, forced marriages, and Chinese baby girls left to starve to death; that shit will work itself out as soon as we get better female representation in video games and fully address everyone's trigger warnings and daily microaggressions."

And before someone comes in yelling ""no true scotsman,"" C.H. Sommers is more than allowed to describe herself as a feminist. That's fine. She just isn't even remotely relevant to the broader feminist movement, as she rejects most of the basic sociological concepts that feminism has built itself on over the last few decades, so it's hardly surprising she isn't gonna get on a list of ""prominent living feminists."""

I will commend them on using an MSP430; they're exceptionally low power, and that's something you're going to need on a device like this. However, it's a stupid fucking choice because they're only 1kilobyte of RAM. Where the fuck is the frame buffer going to go?  -- Before anyone asks, no, this isn't something you can just throw a Flash chip at.  They're doing an 800x480 display on this, right? at one bit per pixel (black and white, no grays), an 800x480 display is 384,000 bits big. That's around 40 kilobytes. Again, they only have 1k of RAM to work with on this. Driving a display on this is literally impossible.  Then they need to find space for the Bluetooth stack, and whatever other RAM they'll need.

shittykickstarters,3543hl,Spritetm,12,Thu May 7 00:31:46 2015 UTC,"My guess is that they're not getting the fact that the DPLC3435 isn't an intelligent controller. You have small LCDs which have an on-board intelligent controller with display RAM and both a SPI and a parallel input and you can use either to draw stuff on the screen; I'd guess that the maker of the schematic thought the DLPC was similar, which would also explain the SPI master <-> SPI slave confusion.

The micro is 16bit and quite old indeed. Ironically, the ""bluetooth module"" that they want to use is actually an ARM cortex M3 with integrated bluetooth, but apparently they don't know that.  Technicaly, they claimed the display will be 16 color, so I guess they could use only 4 pins out of the parallel video bus (3 for chroma and 1 luma, for example) and pull the remaining ones up or down. At a low resolution, you could pull this of on a slow 16 bit micro I guess. But that's just trying to polish a turd. I suspect they think they know what they are doing, but in reality, they don't.

shittykickstarters,3543hl,DaemonXI,6,Thu May 7 18:08:11 2015 UTC,"Some other failures:  Obviously they are using altium designer, which they never used before, as the MSP430 has still the * in the designator, which is the standard value if you create a new part. Normally during creating the part one would change that to something like ""U?"" so that the auto annotation can work its way. They also did not bother to move power and gnd pins to the top and bottom, which is normally done to make the schematic easier and not so clogged.   The reset pins from the pad2005 and DLP2010 are connected, but there seems to be no reset circuit. Additionally the reset pin from the MSP430 is only connected to the ""TMS"" pin from the spy-by-wire(which is written wrong), but it definitely needs a pull-up resistor to work or even better a brown out reset circuit(http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/JTAG_%28MSP430%29). The CC2650 has no ""spy-by-wire"" but rather a cJTAG interface, which is different.  This ""overview"" is not consistent. Some modules have power connections, other don't. There is no ""power-section"" or a clue on where the power comes from. There is no battery connection, which is needed to monitor the battery energy level.   The cap-touch module has just pins labeld I/O, which means for AD that these pins ar all the same, as AD uses the names as references. This block won't generate the layout they want.  The thermistor at the bottom left has an unwanted wire underneath it because there is a junction point.   So much wires and labels are misplaced. Any designer that has at least a bit of self respect would have arranged most of them more tidily.   The pad2005 and DLP2010 most likely won't have any power connected to them in the layout because the way AD works. You have seperate sheets where you define extern connections with those yellow boxes. You then can make a symbol from a sheet, which gives you those green boxes. If there is no additional sheet that includes the one we see here, there won't be any connection to the 1,8V or 3,3V power. An excpetion are the power symbols like the GND we see here. They are global if I remember correctly."

shittykickstarters,354zsf,pug_bomb,7,Thu May 7 13:13:38 2015 UTC,"Chip cards are engineered to be uncloneable: transaction data to be authenticated flows in, a signature flows out. The secret inside (aka the ""key material"") never leaves the device. So scanning and transfering chip cards to this thing is likely to be unfeasible and even if they could reach an agreement with banks, I doubt it would meet the minimum requirements wrt to security. This makes such a device almost useless in regions where chip cards are customary, like in Europe.  Also, feasiblity of scanning and transfering RFID cards widly varies. Some of them simply repeat a hard-coded ID, for instance basic door openers. Those are easy to clone. On the other hand, most contactless payment cards work in the same way of a chip card, except for the connection medium. Those are impossible to clone.  Regarding the magnetic stripe: it can certainly be copied, but I am not aware of any ""programmable magnetic stripe"" that would fit the bill.  Finally: I doubt a battery with those measures exists that can power a touch e-ink screen, a (necessarily more complex) processor and memory for a month, but I am no expert in the field of batteries so maybe it actually does.  My opinion: not necessarily a scam, but they haven't done any feasibility study for sure. They have a concept, they have set up a good marketing campaign, and they simply postponed engineering to a later phase, thinking all problems can solved with money and a good team. That's not how things should be done."

shittykickstarters,354zsf,wrongtree,1 point,Thu May 7 13:14:21 2015 UTC,Isnt that still vulnerable to replay attacks though? I always assumed that was how payments using your phone worked. There have also been proof-of-concept attacks against contactless cards. Here's an article about it
shittykickstarters,354zsf,pug_bomb,1 point,Thu May 7 14:15:56 2015 UTC,I think that risk is overstated and not that big of a deal if you use a phone (since the NFC radio doesn't even turn on unless the phone's unlocked). Might be why banks in the US aren't even bothering to put it on the cards themselves.

I am not personally interested in porcelain dolls with crocheted outfits but the work seems like decent quality to me. She tried the same kickstarter previously and got no backers at all but she is only asking for $10 for the smaller dolls which seems very reasonable.

They also seem to have provided a lot of information regarding exactly what they did and how things worked out. While ""complete transparency"" is a nice sounding idea you simply can't do this in the commercial world, if their manufacturer is holding all their units pending an agreement on some way forward I can understand why they can't talk publicly about issues with the manufacturer. They are also proposing a range of reasonable possible ways forward with what they have.  There is the possibility of failure with any Kickstarter as with any new product or business but this honestly looks like a genuine attempt by guys who were well prepared and knew what they were making but ultimately got tripped up by bad luck and inaccurate estimates (and if you have ever had to estimate something that doesn't exist yet, it is very difficult). You are not buying a product when you back a Kickstarter, you are backing an attempt. And it looks here like they made every effort."
shittykickstarters,350x1s,blorg,0,Wed May 6 10:02:36 2015 UTC,"Simple solution: If you don't want people to sell you a product don't list a finished product as a reward.  Have it so it's like a t-shirt, mug, and then a thank you letter.  I won't hold my breath because the reason someone backs isn't so this product comes to life, but because they get item x at the end of it."
shittykickstarters,350x1s,mrv3,15,Wed May 6 12:14:01 2015 UTC,"That's not the point of Kickstarter, though, if you had a finished product actually in production you could just sell it directly. The whole point of crowdfunding is that you have an idea (and for Kickstarter, if it's a gadget, you should have more than that, you are MEANT to have a working prototype) but you need funds to get it into production.  So you list it on Kickstarter and people who think it is a cool idea and want the product back it with the hope that their backing will allow the creator to make it and that they will get a product at the end of it. On the other side the project creator is meant to have at least some idea of what they are actually doing (which is one of the reasons behind the working prototype rule) and the whole thing should be at least possible. This was possible, and the creators did seem to know what they were doing.  Whether it is sensible to back a project or not is up to you. Personally I think you would usually be better off waiting and just buying the thing when it is done, in the worst case you will generally be paying just 20% or so more. More commonly you get a worse deal than that, whether through delays, knockoffs at a fraction of the price appearing (Pressy), or the product flat out never appearing. But some people feel it is worth the risk that if they see a product they want to HELP the creator make a genuine, realistic attempt at creating that product- if enough people don't fund it, it might not get made at all, so they fund it.  And sometimes it works out, and works out big- just look at Pebble, the first seriously successful smartwatch, who did deliver on their idea and arguably created the market that now even Apple is spending billions to enter.  This case is interesting to follow and debate as to what went wrong and the merits of Kickstarter but it's not a truly ""shitty Kickstarter"". By that, I mean I have no problem with it being listed here, as I see this sub more as ""Kickstarters that went wrong"", but this was not a blatant rip-off attempt with 3D renders like many of the other projects listed here. They had a good idea of what they were making, they had working prototypes, they even managed to actually GET the thing into mass production only at an uneconomical cost. And years late, of course. But they genuinely tried. This is not Arist."
shittykickstarters,350x1s,blorg,4,Wed May 6 13:07:45 2015 UTC,"I think you've misunderstood what he's saying. He's not saying ""if you don't have a product, don't do Kickstarter"". He's saying, ""if you don't have a product, don't offer it as a perk"". You can do a Kickstarter for a product without using it to pre-sell the hardware.  Look at Oculus: a large fraction of the contributors only got a mug or a poster in exchange for helping the project out. The remainder eventually, slowly got crude dev kit hardware, and no software to go with it. Nobody was promised a consumer Rift, and they handed over their money anyway. People did this because they wanted, one day, to be able to go to the shop and buy a consumer version of the Rift, and they wanted to help out.  That's how you do a hardware Kickstarter."
shittykickstarters,350x1s,blorg,8,Wed May 6 14:29:15 2015 UTC,The counterpoint is Pebble. I think most people are more galvanised by actual rewards of the product and this is overwhelmingly the most popular reward chosen over cups or t shirts.
shittykickstarters,350x1s,Position5hero,4,Wed May 6 14:38:59 2015 UTC,"No argument here, I'm just saying it's crazy risky and ill-advised."
shittykickstarters,350x1s,mrv3,1 point,Wed May 6 15:06:01 2015 UTC,"It's risky for the backers- it's great for the KS creator.   The typical path to get a product to market is you pay through the nose for your IP, then you pay through the nose to make the prototype, get a manufacturer ready to go, then you spend 100 hours a week calling distributors, retailers, home shopping channels, everyone, trying to get POs, and once you have the POs, you need to go and give someone a quarter of your business just to fund to first one-  if you're lucky and you got your IP, got everything else.... got the POs...  Kickstarter, you go, you make a kickstarter, then people throw free money at you, you don't need investors, you don't need purchase orders- you don't need to work 100 hour weeks- and the people that make these kickstarts have never worked a 100 hour week in there LIVES - and they can't, because they don't have it in them.   They don't have what it takes to bring a product to market, even with all the advantages KS provides- and this is why they fail, at easy mode.   They have free capital, free distribution channels, free marketing, and they still fail?  The reason is they never know what they're doing they think they can just call a factory in China, and they can get manufacturing that will be perfect, despite not knowing anything about china, or manufacturing, or often times, their own product and what it takes to build one"
shittykickstarters,350x1s,blorg,2,Sat May 9 13:21:59 2015 UTC,"My point is, if you want to hide behind it not being a purchase to avoid consumer protection when a project fails then you can't offer the finished product as a reward.  Simple.  It's shitty because they fucked this up, they had a clear design and prototyped then when they raised money wasted a lot of it on a different design drastucally increasing costs of both R&D and final product. The reasons you list for it failing all come down to their decissions.  It failed because of them."
shittykickstarters,350x1s,tdogg8,5,Wed May 6 13:20:55 2015 UTC,you can't offer the finished product as a reward.   That is the entire point of Kickstarter. The point is it is not guaranteed.

shittykickstarters,350x1s,blorg,0,Wed May 6 16:57:34 2015 UTC,So if it's not guaranteed then sell them a % discount if it's finished.  Like this   Backer reward $100: 20% of the product and a 10% split of the future profit of the company between the total number of people also backing.  That way it's an actual investment not a lottery.
shittykickstarters,350x1s,mrv3,3,Wed May 6 14:14:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not arguing over whether the model is the best one, but most consumers are more interested in their ""cool product"" for their $100, rather than equity.

They know the reason people are buying is because they get the product at the end. Take that way they stop making money.  They currently live in the perfect middle.

If you're lucky, you get a gadget, and if you're unlucky, you lose your money. That's an insane way to treat it, although most projects and most users do exactly that.   It's meant to be like hitting the streets and selling your garage band's T-shirts and CD-R singles so that you can afford to go record an album. People maybe get something in return, but they're not supposed to be pre-ordering something that doesn't exist yet."

Final assembly was done by Flextronics' US offices*. E-Ink, which destroyed their battery ICs when manufacturing the displays, is an MIT spinout in Cambridge, MA. Infinite Power Solutions, the battery supplier that went bust, was in Denver, CO.  It bears repeating: compared to the usual shitty kickstarters, where you have a random Chinese supplier building a product that has never existed for a garage business run by two sophomore students, CST had everything going for them. And they still failed, spectacularly and expensively.  Let this be a warning.  *Mentioned by name in previous posts, it's almost certainly the ""wearables"" partner they're scared of pissing off."
shittykickstarters,350x1s,psycoee,3,Wed May 6 09:31:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly, as someone who has worked in electronics R&D, US suppliers are not particularly great, either.  Many are used to big, easy contracts from big defense companies who can throw money at a problem and don't care about costs.  When you need them to do something on time and on budget, it's a foreign concept.  Quality is often all over the place, too.  Chinese vendors tend to be bigger and have lower operating costs, so for the same budget you will get better quality and service.  Of course, they come with a different set of challenges that also need to be dealt with."

shittykickstarters,34z2jg,IIoWoII,14,Tue May 5 20:56:03 2015 UTC,"The units cost $20 each, not $5K.  After manufacturing costs and taxes, they're probably making less doing this than if the people running the campaign were to flip burgers for the time they spent running the campaign.  Seriously guys, tired of seeing people point at the total funding and gasp at how big the number is.  You have to divide that number by all of the things they have to make using that money.  If it costs $10 in materials, labor and shipping to make each stuffed animal, their profit is $2500.  Which then gets cut by taxes to somewhere between $1800 and $2000, if they only make minimum funding.  That gets divided from now until they ship in October.  So, if they get their minimum $5000 funding, they are making about $400 a month.  Maybe $800 a month, if their manufacturing costs are only $5 and not $10.  So, their take-home from the minimum funding is probably similar to one person making minimum wage at 26 hours a week for the duration of the project."
shittykickstarters,34z2jg,squirrelpotpie,10,Tue May 5 23:51:25 2015 UTC,"5k is too little for starting up any production.  Vat19 has more than enough money to fund this themselves, which is why they're asking so little."

I mean their comment section has been asking for this product for ages. But SAYING you'd buy something is different from actually buying the product once it hits the shelves; Talk is cheap.  Actually this is one of the reasons why I think kickstarter is great (excuse the tangent). I mean what people SAY they want, often differs from what they actually want. But Kickstarter allows you to see if people are actually prepared to put money down for it. It's almost literally putting you money where your mouth is."

Nearly 1m is not a ""free time"" thing. 18,000 backers is not a ""free time"" thing. In your campaign you promised ""More $= More episodes"" and that we'd get a whole series out of this.

shittykickstarters,34vkcb,Ayavaron,-15,Wed May 6 23:25:32 2015 UTC,"You are distorting this quote and taking it out of context.   The show creator gets to choose the artists she's working with. That's great. The scheduling of the project prioritized quality over strict schedule. That's also good. The downside is that the best people who can work on the show already have jobs. They're still getting paid to work like professionals but they time hat is available to buy from freelance animators is limited. In this way you can compromise time to still get a good result you can afford on a kickstarter budget.   A million dollars is a lot of money for a kickstarter but it isn't a lot for a professional animated show. Professionally animated shows usually cost several hundred thousand dollars per episode even if they're low budget. For example, Futurama costs millions of dollars per episode. animation is expensive and labor-intensive. That's just the nature of the beast and the quote you mangled acknowledges that.   You just twisted the words to make it sound like people are being lazy.   I'm not happy with the new Bee and Puppycat episodes either but you're being a dumbass, an asshole, or maybe a jackass when you twist somebody else's words this way in an Internet argument. Fuck you."

shittykickstarters,34vkcb,poopymcfuckoff,67,Wed May 6 00:57:03 2015 UTC,"Also, on top of that, these cartoons are nothing like the pilot in art style, or character. Bee is just some immature food lover now, instead of an adult woman going through the trials of life a lot of us know well.   Also they began on a story arc for Puppy Cat that has proved frutless over the past episodes. They've just never revisited it even in passing.   It pisses me off because this was going to be a great cartoon about just an ordinary woman who has issues in her life, it eccentric (not ditzy), and enjoys a few adventures. Now its just some cutesy abomination that barely has a release schedule and some weird ass shit where she needs someone else to come in and fix all her problems.  At least Bravest Warriors has a decent release schedule"
shittykickstarters,34vkcb,poopymcfuckoff,23,Tue May 5 00:00:48 2015 UTC,"I was about to say in response how we can't base a lot of judgement on a pilot because it's a pilot, but, thinking again, this all links back to the Kickstarter. I see your point, if people were paying to see the pilot extended that's what should have been presented, not something different.    Personally I really, really enjoy the show. I have nothing against the show in its omega form, i.e. this whole situation aside. The way I see it is that Bee is a young kid who never learnt how to grow up, and the show's arc would be her essentially doing just that, growing up, and it's actually a very different plot than I've seen. Learning to deal with that transition from kid to adult.    I honestly forgot about the pilot when watching episode one. :/"
shittykickstarters,34vkcb,Mazgazine1,20,Tue May 5 00:37:59 2015 UTC,"From the pilot, I interpreted it as an eccentric person with a sort of dull life with regular struggles that gets to go on adorable adventures. I don't like they have infantalised her instead of showing her as a responsible grown up. You can be eccentric and have a half reasonable life.   A growing up tale should be less about an adult who already had a job and an appartment... I mean, she clearly has gotten this far.  Meh, its my own interpretation that makes me sad. Maybe that's how it was always meant to be, in which case, I never liked it in the first place."

Especially the REALLY FUCKING AWKWARD ""cleavage crab"" shit that happened.... I like cute animation, but terrible writing feels like an umbrella to the stomach - ""My guu-uuts, my guu-uuts""..  I completely forgot about expecting episodes 2 months ago....  Also still waiting on Bravest Warriors, and from Mondo - more Baman Piderman...

There are a lot of talented folks out there who would love to work on this and I'm sure that it would work.

That's enough to run an ultra-low power device, like a sensor that only transmits data every hour or so, but at 60ÂµW, it would take 100,000 hours to charge a typical 6Wh battery of a phone once. 11 years. In other terms, every day of RF harvesting you would get the equivalent of charging your phone for approximately 1 second more."

This is surprising, because the concept is still new, but that doesn't change anything, either.  So it's dishonest. It might even be legally actionable if the ZPM people made a few too many missteps.

To top it all off, set the copy protection bit on the Arduino's IC (which the developer of this thing will probably do for obvious reasons beyond copyright) so that the competition leaders cannot read the code memory to validate it with the legitimate code.  TL;DR: Anythings possible when you have physical access. A server plugin that checks for suspicious movements would probably be more secure."

I believe 32KB of compiled code is the limit on most models.   Not that it really matters, as we have established that the majority of work is done on the  Anti-Cheat server, but the board he is using is the Arduino Mega ADK, which has 256KB of flash.

Once you have your prototype, you design your own board and produce that at a fraction of the cost.  Arduino Mega + Ethernet Shield ~$80   Own custom board with ethernet and microcontroller chips etc ~$25  So they're asking for a $125 donation to get one of these boxes, after labor, case costs, cables, manuals, and postage etc they might make maybe $15 bucks towards their cause. Not much.  I wonder how many they're planning on making and selling.  Anyway, since it's just an Arduino after all, why don't they just sell the firmware?"

Maybe if it were re-engineered using a different microcontroller with integrated USB and ethernet, but the effort in porting it ultimately impacts the final cost. Even with refactoring the entire thing, you'd have a tough time getting down to $25.  I've been doing embedded design for over a decade. Even simple projects get expensive quick."

A single cheese sandwich is around 440 000 calories (bodies internal cycle is something like 85% efficient).

A few people have asked for evidence of progress, even something as minimal as a list of specs, but in sharp contrast to every other KS/IGG ever, they've all docilely accepted the rebuffs they've gotten, mostly to the effect that it's too early to ask for progress reports because they can't do anything until they've sorted out the ""Beta Test Program"", aka the baffling ""we'll give you all your money back as soon as we make a profit"", and the BTP was--conveniently--only just resolved.  I mean, is it me, or is that crazy? They don't know what it's going to look like or what's in it, but they're on track to deliver it on time? Or even 6 months late? They're damned lucky their backers haven't blown up yet, and I can't for the life of me figure out why not.

shittykickstarters,34h0qp,AngryAngryCow,12,Fri May 1 19:12:02 2015 UTC,"Well they do remove projects that are illegal in their own existence. For example, somebody once blatantly copied this old semi-shitty campaign: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/meet-boddie-the-smartwatch-evolution/x/9036392. They used the same, though slightly re-cut video, the same text and images, similar prices. I contacted the original author, he contacted Indiegogo and within a day, the copycat was deleted. Similarly there was a copycat Arist coffee maker on Indiegogo, also deleted quickly.  They also deleted a campaign that was collecting money to help the officer involved in the South Carolina shooting. Link here.  And a quick google search shows that the Sonic Cable campaign was apparently offline for a short while.

shittykickstarters,34h0qp,iso700c,11,Fri May 1 10:52:14 2015 UTC,"Charging twice as fast is their main selling point, repeated over and over in their video and text. If you base your marketing on a lie, the remaining features of the product should also be questioned (is the cable really durable, or maybe it just looks that way?) I've had headphones with cables that looked extremely fragile and outlasted much thicker cables by years.  Also, I'm not saying that you can't make a cable that charges faster, since there are cases in which a special cable may help. But the examples in their video are all wrong. Charging from a wall outlet will always be fast. Charging an apple device from an apple computer will always be fast (they have a ""secret handshake"" that tells the computer to ignore the USB current limit of 0.5A and supply up to 2.1A instead)."

Each time I've gotten an automated email acknowledging my report and then a follow-up email sent by a human to let me know it had been taken care of, usually within 24 (business) hours. By contrast, I've reported a couple to Kickstarter for the same reasons & none of those were removed. I assume KS decided to leave them up so they could collect their cut.

shittykickstarters,34bcvm,pug_bomb,3,Thu Apr 30 17:32:54 2015 UTC,"The core motion sensors on any phone are accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers. Not all phones have these, and some have additional things like barometric pressure sensors, but let's stick with the big three.  You can get raw accelerometer data out of a phone (assuming the API isn't completely stupid) and you can often get 'fused' sensor values, which are in effect virtual sensors created through software that attempts to merge together readings from all the real sensors. TYPE_GRAVITY is going to be this sort of virtual sensor.  Thought experiment; imagine being in a closed box somewhere in the universe, and you can feel an acceleration of 1G. Is that because you're sitting still in a gravitational field, or because your velocity is changing at 9.8m/s2? Some combination, perhaps? From just feeling the force you have no way of knowing. The same applies to your phone. It senses acceleration and infers gravity."
shittykickstarters,34bcvm,Hadrosauroidea,0,Thu Apr 30 18:31:31 2015 UTC,There are orientation sensors (no idea what they're actually called and are mechanical and too bulky for a phone) that uses some mercury in a tube that somehow tells orientation. That might be able to be called a gravity sensor sense they require gravity to function.  Edit: guess they're called mercury switches. Who'da thunk it. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_switch#Roll_sensing
shittykickstarters,34bcvm,Hokurai,3,Thu Apr 30 18:56:12 2015 UTC,"Mercury switches are a kind of crude one-bit accelerometer. They would behave the same as any other sort of accelerometer in the thought experiment I outlined, within the limits of their single direction on/off sensing capability.  Pick up a mercury switch and shake it around; would it give you a steady on or off state due to gravity? No? Then it's not sensing gravity per se, is it."
shittykickstarters,34bcvm,Hadrosauroidea,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:02:28 2015 UTC,"They are sensitive to vibrations, but  that's not their purpose. Just like a compass will tell you the poles on a magnet if it's too close. Mount a SPST one vertically and it would tell you if it's upside down, which is only a thing in environments with gravity. Space has no upside down.  Though accelerometers are used as a substitute for them because of environmental concerns. In that case, they measure the movement instead of their rotation in relation to gravity."
shittykickstarters,34bcvm,Hokurai,3,Thu Apr 30 20:14:32 2015 UTC,"Their purpose is whatever the designer wants it to be. In a pinball machine, vibration is exactly what they are meant to sense. They'd similarly work great for crude earthquake detectors. Strap a mercury switch onto a space probe and it'll suddenly become an ""is it spinning?"" sensor. Vertical orientation is probably the most common use of a mercury switch, I'll give you that.  Look, the comment I was replying to was saying there was such a thing as a gravity sensor, as distinct from an accelerometer. What I'm pointing out is that at its root, all of these things sense acceleration. It doesn't matter that a mercury switch is single-bit resolution in one dimension (MEMS accelerometers used in phones etc. are one dimensional as well, at the silicon level; they just put 3 of them in a single package, probably on the same die) the physical property that it is sensing is acceleration.  In no case can the raw sensor separate out acceleration due to gravity from any other kind of acceleration.  Do you want to sense gravity independent of any other kind of acceleration? To the best of my knowledge, you're limited to working with photons, since they're massless. Have fun playing with gravity wells."
shittykickstarters,34bcvm,Hadrosauroidea,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:37:31 2015 UTC,"It doesn't directly detect movement, though. If you turned it on and it were upside down, it would know despite having no movement since it was powered on. Not sure if accelerometers can do that. Though I don't exactly know how accelerometers work.  I only know about these because I was reading about autonomous robots. Using one of these allows it to know it's upside down so it can right itself."
shittykickstarters,34bcvm,Hokurai,3,Thu Apr 30 20:44:06 2015 UTC,"You're right, mercury switches don't directly detect movement. They detect acceleration. So how do they detect vertical orientation? Through the acceleration caused by gravity. The same is true of any accelerometer.  A mercury switch is a single dimension, single bit acceleration detector. It is not some sort of fancy ""gravitation independent of acceleration"" detector. To repeat myself, in no case can the raw sensor separate out acceleration due to gravity from any other kind of acceleration."

shittykickstarters,34bj4f,foreverska,24,Wed Apr 29 20:55:38 2015 UTC,I'm also interested in how they plan to fit a 6-speed manual to an electric motor. I thought one of the perks of electric drive was that there were fewer moving parts between the powerplant and the wheels?
shittykickstarters,34bj4f,sturk91,17,Thu Apr 30 01:04:04 2015 UTC,"It's not even about whether they could fit it.  The whole point of a transmission is to gain back torque.  It's just not needed in an electric motor unless you're trying to get extreme speeds or 0-60 times.  Even then, two or three speeds would be more than enough.  Anything after that and we're talking about hundreds of mph faster or fractions of a second better in acceleration.  Nothing that would even be possible with current construction materials."
shittykickstarters,34bj4f,steeley42,6,Thu Apr 30 01:42:47 2015 UTC,"Exactly, that's what I was thinking. And it seems like there would be some significant loss of efficiency with that kind of setup as well, so I'm not sure how it would impact range.

A 2 speed is nice on a conversion vehicle, using 2nd gear for around town spirited driving and 4th or 5th on the highway. Serious DIY conversion guys will disassemble the gearbox and grind the teeth off unused gears. If you want to get fancy you can even rework the shifter to move from 2nd to 5th with just one movement. Requires removing unused shift forks and adding a pin to drive 2/5 at the same time."

It would be sooooooooo so so so easy for me to rebrand an off the shelf watch from Ali, but I wanted to start from scratch and keep as much of it home-grown as possible. Ive been extensively documenting and photographing the design and prototyping stages to show during the upcoming Kickstarter. A lot of work and passion has gone into this so far. I really really enjoy watches, and Im creating one that I hope people will enjoy. The response on my Facebook to the design mockups has been overwhelmingly positive with people messaging and texting me left and right asking when they can get one. That's given me the drive to continue and not just cave to Alibaba.  ....Onnnnn the other hand, these might be a blessing in disguise because it shows people are shelling out huge amounts of money for watches on Kickstarter and Ill soon be rolling in piles of cash, heh."

shittykickstarters,3496fq,mcnub,3,Tue May 5 02:23:22 2015 UTC,answer the question.  Are these watches from Alibaba?
shittykickstarters,3496fq,corduroy_pillows,-1,Thu Apr 30 22:31:29 2015 UTC,"Great question! Thank you for inquiring. When we were looking into finding a manufacturer to make the watches we had in mind we looked all over for a reputable manufacturer who could produce a quality product. We sourced our first manufacturers through Alibaba (That's likely why you've found 1-2 watches that are sort of/kind of similar to just 1 of the 8 watches we've created). We loved the look of the bamboo with the raw leather band so we designed one as different as could be (stitching, hands, bezel) while still having a similar look. During the design process, our manufacturer provided us with a ""base modelâ. This âbase modelâ is a VERY basic template for watch designs (basically a wood case). It is how just about any watch manufacturer gets the design process started. From there, we fully customized it. We:  1) Selected the wood type and the finish  2) Selected the crystal type  3) Selected the hands  4) Selected the face  5) Selected the clasp and the metal finish  6) Selected the crown metal and finish  7) Selected the band width and material  8) Selected the Stitching 9) Selected the bezel We spent months testing different options to see what we liked best. With how many different options we had to customize, there were literally hundreds of different designs we could have come up with. We really liked the simplistic look of the base model, which is why the Shoots watch is similar, however, as you can see, our other models such as the Pine and the Orca are very unique and different from anything else you will find. This is a prefect example of how DIVERSE and UNIQUE we can make our watches throughout the design process. I think you would agree, each of our menâs watches are VERY different. They each started from that same âbaseâ template. SO yes, we found our manufacture through Alibaba, but the watches we designed were not displayed or advertised on Alibaba. The bamboo watch referenced here is the only one that resembles a watch we are offering on kickstarter.   I hope this answers your question. If I can answer any other questions you have, I'd be happy to."

The intent to deceive is what we, on this sub, take offense to. ""Help us get enough money to order a batch of custom watches"" is a lot different from how your title (and article) reads. Your evasion of direct questions is admission enough that you are consciously deceiving people.  The reality, no matter how hard you try to deny it, is that the ""customization"" you have done for a mass-produced piece of shit from China is something a toddler with access to a computer could do. It's like boasting about your ability to customize the toppings on a delivery pizza, then trying to sell that pizza to strangers as if you'd baked it yourself.

Wireless power is old tech. It's been known of and played with for decades. It's never gone anywhere because nobody can figure out how to make it work efficiently beyond a few feet. I'm not a math guy, but I believe from reading other comments on this site that the voltage drops at a cubed ratio vs distance, which means that anything beyond a few feet requires a huge power source.  Also, they say that their good name on amazon is on the line. If you follow their link, it seems that all they sell are cheap phone cases, which they probably buy premade from a distributor. I would guess that they figured that they could buy cheap cases and resell them at a huge markup. When they realized that there's a thousand other companies that so the exact same thing, they decided to just outright scam people.  If this technology was real, every major corporation in the world would be sensing their CEOs to line up to blow this guy for the rights. Pollution would be solved.

shittykickstarters,3489g9,RandomUser33,4,Wed Apr 29 14:36:24 2015 UTC,"Point sources fall off with the square of distance. Line sources fall off linearly with distance. Plane sources do not fall off with distance. This assumes you are in the near field for the line and plane sources, which is ultimately the problem. This works the same for sound, electric fields, etc. So no matter how big the source is or whether it's a plane or line, at some point you are no longer in the near field and it starts to look like a point source. The only way around this is to make the source highly directional, like loudspeakers do with horns or WiFi does with directional antennas. Ultimately all of this has been known since the early days of radio, so it's unlikely any real advances will be made short of incremental improvements in implementation."
shittykickstarters,3489g9,hatsune_aru,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:04:14 2015 UTC,"Hey, just because it falls off at the square of distance doesn't mean it drops off fast. ""highly directional"" sources also drops off at the square of distance, but that doesn't matter since it's highly directional and the rate of dropoff is acceptably low.  Again, there is some research going on to create circuits that make better matching between the transmitter and receiver coils. You don't have to make it into some sort of laser beam to get this working. I'm not saying that kickstarter did, I'm just saying not to discount the efforts being put into this.   I've worked in a lab that does exactly this. I've seen the transmitter-receiver antennas. It's not some crazy ass 20 element yagi beam."
shittykickstarters,3489g9,mrv3,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:35:34 2015 UTC,"I would've thought that dropping off with the square of the distance is fast by definition: if you've got enough power to charge a phone at 10ft, you've got to be pumping out 100 times as much power at 1ft distance. Which is just insanely wasteful.  Of course if they're using resonant near-field transmitters, then it drops off with the exponential of the distance, which is even worse, and you're enormously constrained by engineering. It would take some sort of savant to have beaten those problems in a small mobile phone accessories business in a suburban Yorkshire street."
shittykickstarters,3489g9,hatsune_aru,1 point,Fri May 1 16:00:33 2015 UTC,"In those cases I suspect directional beams where used.   So imagine it like the difference between a laser and a sound wave.  A laser won't drop off much at all.  Sound does because it propagates in 3 dimensions  If you could make it like a laser then you could achieve that 98% efficiency, if it's still propagating in all directions then I doubt you could."

It has been a hell of a long time since I studied Maxwell's equations but 50% at 10 feet seems like it would be well above a fundamental limit unless the coils are absurdly huge.    Power transfer efficiency should scale with the ratio of the two coils and the ratio of the distance between coils and coil size.    In this case, charging dock coil is much larger than the coil on the phone.  I think this right here means 50% is impossible.  Also, the power transfer will fall off exponentially with distance relative to size of charging dock coil.    50% is entirely possible when you put an electronic toothbrush on its charging dock and 2 1cm coils are 1cm apart.  In this case I think the efficiency at 10 feet would be infinitesimally small."

shittykickstarters,346rs9,moroshek,27,Wed Apr 29 02:14:54 2015 UTC,"This story just gets better and better. They've been receiving so much attention in the last couple weeks that it seems like the whole thing could collapse at any time with some good investigative journalism in HK. If you check the backer list, you can see an extremely conspicuous string of almost 200 people with Chinese names who have no profile information and have never backed another project. That's about $70,000 of their funding and helped fuel the initial interest in the campaign.  This post contains a link to the HK government funding matching program Arist used:  http://aristscam.com/is-arist-planning-to-defraud-the-hong-kong-government/  They're apparently also doing shady stuff like paying employees in cash to avoid taxes:  http://aristscam.com/unconfirmed-report-of-arist-paying-employee-salaries-in-cash/  One news source questions whether they should have received the ICT startup award because they don't have an actual product. Nelson claims they'd already sold and shipped over a thousand machines before the KS campaign:  http://aristscam.com/fawning-hong-kong-press-does-not-push-nelson-chiu-on-the-arist-lies/    Update: Another comment   At the launch party, they asked each person to make a purchase using their own credit card. The brothers then refunded each person with cash afterward... This technique can be traced to Benson's friends and ex-Microsoft colleagues - Edmond Yue/Francis Duong. The duo founded a company (which was backed by Y-Combinator in SF) called Ignite Mobile (TapZilla & AppRebates). In a nutshell, they asked a bunch of their users to pay and download iPhone apps, and then refund the payment to each user. This will juice up the # of downloads and cause the apps to move up in the App Store ranking. You can read how this is done:   http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/13/tapzilla-offers-daily-deals-for-paid-mobile-apps/   TapZilla's own comment: ""By using TapZilla's model, developers can maintain control of their pricing and don't have change their paid apps to free. This means that they continue to make money while running their campaigns with us and the spike in downloads will generate a lasting interest on the app.""  During the demostration of Arist coffee maker functionalities to the HK government, they hired paid actors to demonstrate the brewing. It was speculated they used some special effect or techniques to fool the viewers that the machine can actually brew coffee.  Some shops have indeed ordered the coffee makers from Arist, but no one received a working model yet."

I documented it just now on http://www.aristscam.com , it's very important that they're on the record now for some of this stuff.   Benson stepped out of the shadows and engaged in a public flame war on the Kickstarter comment page. Do check it out, it was entertaining. Importantly he made the following statements on the record:  âWe have 22 full time and 3 part time [employees] up till now.â âLaunch Party. Yep, we hosted one and friends and family came to show their support. They are all real pledges, and no refunds were madeâ¦No we did not [refund with cash].

shittykickstarters,340zar,Kickmonger,5,Mon Apr 27 20:42:52 2015 UTC,"So I looked it up and there are 236 episodes of Friends, most of them 22 minutes long. That's 5192 minutes, or >86 hours. That leaves 34 hours for them to do anything else, including sleep.   If you assume they're not completely mad, which I admit goes against all the evidence to the contrary, they'd have to sleep maybe 6 hours a day (which I doubt they'd do, considering the number of drinking games they plan on).   If they don't cook or spend too much time in the shitter, that leaves just 4 hours, total, as in less than an hour each day, for the 5-minute exercises and drinking games. Of course, it would probably end up being less; don't they have to drop the kids off at daycare and pick them up every day and attend to childcare at night when the daycare closes?  And if you were generous and assumed everyone who inexplicably donated gave the $10 necessary to even watch the stream, that's 80 full names to shout before each episode. 32 if those people gave $25 instead.  So after all these calculations, I am forced to conclude that this asshole didn't plan this out and would be unable to deliver on the ""rewards"" no matter how much money you tossed at him.

shittykickstarters,342l0s,zoltecrules,8,Tue Apr 28 16:56:18 2015 UTC,I'm still trying to figure out how any of these projects plan to obtain a workable bandwidth on a CPU with only 8 spring-loaded data pins. At least with Ara and Phoneblocks they show the CPU taking up 4-6 slots.
shittykickstarters,342l0s,Kickmonger,6,Tue Apr 28 04:27:18 2015 UTC,"At least phoneblocks have a single block for CPU and RAM, a general ""Processing block"". These guys however want to connect RAM on the same 8-pin wide bus as everything else :]  But what always irked me about these imaginary modular phone projects was the cost of production. Connectors and mechanical laches are expensive. Putting electronics in a case is expensive. It just sounds crazy to have a separate detachable module for a 50 cent accelerometer. But these guys definitely have it figured out, if they can ship a modular phone comparable to an iPhone for just $99"

shittykickstarters,342l0s,mrv3,3,Tue Apr 28 15:02:43 2015 UTC,"I know. I hate cheap, marketing-driven electronics. When manufacturers do everything so that they can claim a ""quad-core"" cpu or other fancy features, but all other components are as cheap as possible, often affecting performance. Laptop manufacturers still occasionally put high end expensive CPUs paired with a cheap fan and surrounded with components rated for lower temperatures. The same money could be spent on a slightly cheaper CPU but better surrounding components and it would work faster, but it simply wouldn't sell as well.  Same here. ""13 megapixel interpolation"", so a low resolution camera that just stretches an image to 13mpixel. Ridiculous :D"
shittykickstarters,342l0s,zoltecrules,3,Tue Apr 28 16:20:24 2015 UTC,"Here's a thought - maybe they include specs because they know they'll fail, and they know they can just ship phones with matching specs to the backers. They don't expressly promise ""modular"" in the rewards."

In actuality, a product's cost of production could be only 10% of the retail price or even less. The rest of the retail price is not from cost of production, but slotting fees, advertising fees, etc. So we're not actually pricing at a loss.""   Bullshit.

There has been local initiatives encouraging good engineering, good design and handcrafted artisan products. It has been really hard though what with everybody lumping us with the bad press Mainland China has been getting. Not saying all Chinese manufacturers are bad, but it's not easy trying to defend and build your reputation when people see our international city as the same as some tier 3 knock-off factory town."

Since most Americans think that Hong Kong is just another Chinese city, it makes no difference to them.  It's kind of crazy when you think about it.

We strongly believe the perpetrator is a backer or a group of backers who are actively monitoring this comment section. We will then follow by providing the suspect(s) information to the police.   This is your last chance to turn yourselves in. If you send us a private message and relinquish the stolen data, we can still settle everything privately and we promise not to pursue this matter any further. If you choose to ignore us now, we have no choice but to hand over your information to the police. And once we do that, as this is a criminal offense, the matter will be out of our hands."

shittykickstarters,33vf9t,exclamationmarek,20,Sun Apr 26 23:12:11 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, I think by ""relinquish"" they mean ""promise to delete and not use or publish"". Not ""give back since we need it"". It's just their bad English.   But yeah, the hack seems like another episode in their series of lies and deception. I can't imagine someone trying to fill in a patent application using stolen ""technology"". It's like hacking into a bank and transferring money to your private account-they are going to know its you. The whole ""wait one month"" thing seems like the worst possible idea. If they are afraid that somebody will patent their tech, they should hurry to fill the allocation first. They do have a head start since they are familiar with the subject."
shittykickstarters,33vf9t,arcesilaus,15,Sun Apr 26 11:10:38 2015 UTC,"I agree that's what they meant by ""relinquish"", but the word choice isn't their problem: ""promise to delete and not use or publish"" is just as ridiculous. They're suggesting there's a nefarious hacker who's just stolen buckets of proprietary, mission-critical, and apparently irreproducible IP and â¦ they want him to pinky-swear not to use it? The whole thing's absurd.  I think something must have spooked them--their language is usually more polished & the lies are usually much cleverer. It'll be interesting to see where they go from here."
shittykickstarters,33vf9t,exclamationmarek,9,Sun Apr 26 12:01:50 2015 UTC,"That's a good observation with the change of language. It does sound more authentic, I guess, with the less polished style of writing.   But it still is blatantly absurd. Especially the part with the hacking ""stopping at 11:56"". If the hacking was with intention of copying files, how do they even know they were hacked? And how do they know the hacking stopped? I think they watched too much CSI: Cyber and imagine a big red ""you are being hacked"" sign, along with a progress bar of copying ""secret design files"".  I most certainly am joining you with a bag of popcorn to see what they will do next ;)"

Whenever the creator checks this comment, the script triggers (user_agent_browser == 'arist' part) in the creator's  browser and uses his cookie to login (to confirm) and does an SQL injection to get his password.

Edit: not to mention that ""relinquishing stolen data"" is ridiculous when it's digital data. I keep asking myself, ""how dumb do they think I am?"", and then I remember they've got 2500 backers who actually are that dumb, so fair enough.

shittykickstarters,33uv8u,stijnhommes,2,Sat Apr 25 21:15:28 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just obvious to me, but if you run a Kickstarter in English, you either need to learn correct English yourself or find someone who already knows. Here I stopped reading after barely 5 lines of text.  Also, the construction as it exists now is bound to fail when someone larger than the kid tries to use it, because their higher center of gravity will make them lose their balance more quickly.  From my point of view, that is a double fail right from the word go."
shittykickstarters,33vutd,edderiofer,8,Sun Apr 26 03:04:47 2015 UTC,"3-player and 4-player chess all have one fundamental flaw; trading pieces is a disadvantage.  As an example, consider this: In normal chess, sacrificing a rook to destroy your opponent's queen is a good move, since a queen is more powerful than a rook. However, in 3-player chess, doing so lowers your power by a rook compared to the 3rd player, so it is a disadvantage to you. Therefore, no rational people will ever trade material, and the game will end in all players agreeing to a draw."
shittykickstarters,33vutd,gd42,9,Sun Apr 26 03:07:18 2015 UTC,"But there are 3 and 4 player versions of chess. The problem with this ks is not the concept, but the fact that it already exists."
shittykickstarters,33vutd,BDSb,4,Sun Apr 26 08:22:47 2015 UTC,"Even though there are 3- and 4- player versions of chess already, the same flaw is still present in those games.  Of course, there is the fact that it already exists, that the concept is bad, and that the product promotion is horrible, I think it's safe to say that this person won't get funded if he puts out the same Kickstarter again."
shittykickstarters,33vutd,Aero_,4,Sun Apr 26 12:14:10 2015 UTC,"But I can tell you there are at least 4 other very viable aspects of gaming coming to this site in late 2016, which will break records in my opinion. They will certainly be as entertaining and stimulating as the Generals Chess once we make it worldwide interactive.    The style of the new games are in the genera of another variation of Chess style game to interactive combat and fighting games to racing games. But each with new never before seen twists. So the board game means more to me than just selling the Generals Chess (which means a lot to me).  This site can be one of the most used gaming sites of its type within one year of it being completed with the full spectrum of games and I see it being the most visited site of all gaming sites at least one year of the next ten years after all the games are up.

shittykickstarters,33qrte,DasUberSquid,5,Sat Apr 25 15:52:57 2015 UTC,I think he's talking in terms of actual use though - phones have to do all sorts of other things. Headlights only have to do one thing and can probably last longer than a phone would.

shittykickstarters,33qrte,hannsn,3,Sat Apr 25 15:58:18 2015 UTC,"Phone batteries have like 3000mAh   Yet they are used to power a lot more than a few super bright LEDs, whereas a headlamp only has to power those LEDs.   headlamps take like 3 AAA batteries, usually from 800 to 1000mAh   But because the main function of a headlamp is a light source, their intensity (meaning, power consumption) can be adjusted. These can run up to several dozen hours on a fresh set of batteries. Meanwhile, most flashlight apps only let you turn on/off.  This project is fucking retarded. It reminded me of this in terms of relative stupidity. Sure, you can use the LED flashes on your phones as a light source, but these are not meant to be used for long periods.  If you absolutely must use the phone's battery as a power source for a LED flashlight, here's a better option: one small USB OTG adapter and one of these tiny reversible LED light cards. Now you have a USB LED flashlight that doesn't overheat your phone."

You can argue about the moon landings all you want, but if you are going to argue that a satellite like the moon itself doesn't exist you've lost any bit of credibility you might have left.

Typically, you can't just hold the coil over an item; you won't get a signal (unless using a pinpointer, but that's not what this is). Dragging them behind you won't sweep. Sure, you might get a ping as you pass over something, but you'd need to go back and forth to find the object. The differential in the magnetic field that you create by sweeping across a surface is what they detect (without getting into the differences between VLF and pulse induction, etc).  Second, this concept has been around for years, using ground penetrating radar (GPR) or imaging locators. A Pulse induction system and blanket antenna creates a map of what's underground as you pass over.  Finally, his video is staged - he's just dragging coils, with no discernible wires or control unit across the ground and magically finding hordes of goodies! Don't think so."

Personally I haven't opened my fridge in 3 - 4 days (freezer is a different story) so 25% savings is pretty out there.  Fridges are pretty efficient these days anyhow.  Going on the marketing sheet still taped to the inside of my freezer it says it costs $51/year to operate.  Lets say I got that full 25% savings, $12.75/year.  The basic kit costs $100 so break even point is 7.8 years, YMMV.  IDK... neat idea to show refrig manufacturers?  Yea.  Personal investment opportunity?  We're on the scale of a Government Bond.

shittykickstarters,33iwfl,thehenkan,4,Thu Apr 23 15:14:30 2015 UTC,Kickstarter has the economic incentives to become a store. Kickstarter earns most of its money from successful campaigns; successful campaigns are usually created by established players who would launch the product anyways; these established players who will be selling the product treat KS as a store because it's in line with their marketing strategy.

shittykickstarters,33g5qr,SirPremierViceroy,20,Wed Apr 22 08:59:54 2015 UTC,"Let's be real here. Exceeding 200 mph isn't slightly above 70 mph, which is the maximum rail speed in most of California. Yes, the average speed will be somewhere lower, but that's accounting for station loading/ unloading (I would estimate the average speed to be around the mid-hundreds, which is a significant improvement on the current sub-40 mph average on conventional passenger rail). Furthermore, there are numerous companies involved in the bidding process, and different ones are contracted for each segment of construction. Next, the reason that construction is beginning in ""bumfuck nowhere"" is that there's no existing passenger infrastructure there. The Bay Area and southern corridors already have trackage which only needs to be upgraded with electric catenary wiring, which is significantly cheaper and faster than creating something entirely new. Lastly, the train will alleviate traffic on the I-5 and SFO-LAX flights, this will drastically reduce emissions, helping address one of the root causes of drought, rather than simply pumping more water in. TD;DR, I implore you to research the project more before making snap judgments. It won't solve everything, obviously, but it's an important provision for California's future."
shittykickstarters,33g5qr,newprofile15,5,Wed Apr 22 20:20:40 2015 UTC,"CA HSR is a huge fucking disaster for California and will solve precisely dick.  It's going to cost well over $200 billion by the time it's done (cost estimates have already more than doubled).    Tickets are going to cost roughly 2x to 3x as much as airfare yet the travel time will take 3 times as long.  Who the fuck is going to ride something that costs 3 times as much and is 3 times slower?  Fucking no one!  Studies have already revealed that expected ridership is going to be much lower than anticipated... just wait until the cost estimates continue to rise and expected ticket prices continue to explode as well.  The speed is intolerably slow - you know what's a lot faster than a 200mph train?  A 550 mph commercial airliner.    The train won't even be done until probably 2028 or so... at which point there could be superior technology anyway.  Innovative ideas like the Hyperloop?  Can't even bother to consider them now that we're sinking hundreds of billions into this trainwreck of an idea.    California HSR is a mess... it's going to be a ghost railroad by the time it launches and it is going to end the careers of any politicians who advocated for it (lucky for them, they'll probably all be out of office by the time it's done).  But hey, the labor unions and construction firms who campaigned for it are all making out like bandits... so what do they care?"
shittykickstarters,33g5qr,SirPremierViceroy,1 point,Thu Apr 23 00:33:31 2015 UTC,"A 550 mph airliner at top speed. To reach that speed is another question. With such a short journey, the aircraft will be at top speed for a fraction of the travel time. An electric train is capable of relatively superior acceleration to top speed. The time difference will be approximately one hour, not counting the increased advance arrival time necessitated by airport security. The hyperloop is just barely a concept currently, and there are many reasons why it isn't being taken seriously at the moment. Other technologies such as the maglev are prohibitively expensive per mile and still largely experimental. Our airports are overly congested as it is, and short flights like that are incredibly inefficient and not a sustainable practice. You really must consider the alternatives. Widening the highways for the impending increase in travel on the corridor will also be incredible expensive, as will expanding the airports. Whoever billed this project to you as a luxury was missing the point, it is necessary. Fast downtown to downtown transport without the hassle of airport security is actually much faster than going to and being dropped off in the outskirts of town, depending on your destination. Electric trains are also contribute far less pollution to California's ailing climate than cars or planes."
shittykickstarters,33g5qr,newprofile15,6,Thu Apr 23 00:45:46 2015 UTC,"Say that I actually go with what you're saying and agree that the train is only an hour longer than the flight, as opposed to two hours longer.    Still doesn't address the fact that tickets will cost 2-3 times as much as airline tickets.    Or that saying ""well you don't have to go through airport security"" is also an acknowledgment that the security will be lax on trains and make them an easy target (or alternately, that security theater in airports is unnecessary... which I would also agree with).    Or acknowledge the $200 billion plus price tag.  Improving our highway infrastructure would have been a much better idea - highways have an advantage of immense flexibility relative to HSR and with likely innovations coming in car travel in the near future (namely self-driving cars) they're more flexible to adapt to new technology as opposed to HSR (which has been stagnant since it was even proposed... and will continue to be stagnant for decades until it is finally scrapped).  They're also guaranteed to be used, unlike the ghost train currently in construction.  Putting everything else aside it's just simple math... no one is going to ride this train when they see that the travel time is longer AND the cost is higher.  It'll be a fun novelty and nothing more."
shittykickstarters,33g5qr,vicarofyanks,2,Thu Apr 23 01:04:39 2015 UTC,"The other thing about improving highway infrastructure is that even if the HSR is built, the roads will still need to be maintained.

Yes, we may be approaching a post-fossil fuel era (still a long way off) but cars are adapting to that reality with hybrids becoming more common and even electric cars starting to arrive.    Hell, we might even have driverless car technology on the road by 2028 (when HSR is completed) which would dramatically improve overall congestion on all of our roadways.    We're going to be wishing we had that $200 billion back so we could put some of that towards improving our highways and roads 15 years from now."
shittykickstarters,33g5qr,SirPremierViceroy,0,Thu Apr 23 03:05:08 2015 UTC,"There's much more that can be said about this issue and we're not going to change one another's minds. I appreciate your arguments however, they're very legitimate. Ultimately I suppose that we'll see the outcome and reassess the situation. Either of us can be correct. I believe that the train's passenger-bearing and environmental efficiency will prove the project's utility, much like the Acela did in the East. Perhaps however you're correct and its shortcomings will be too much to overcome. Only time will tell. Though I may add that I think that making people less reliant on personal transportation and creating a more multimodal society is a positive in its own right."

shittykickstarters,33g5qr,NervousMcStabby,28,Wed Apr 22 14:39:24 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, a lot of that water goes to food that the rest of the country eats. We all need to reconsider our consumption -- California needs to be more responsible with its water, but we also need to be more responsible about eating fewer water-intensive crops such as nuts, avocados, etc."
shittykickstarters,33g5qr,Boyhowdy107,12,Thu Apr 23 02:11:37 2015 UTC,"Almonds are getting a bad rap here. A single almond requires a gallon of water. An orange nearly requires 14 gallons. An apple needs 17.5 gallons. A glass of milk is 54 gallons. A watermelon requires 100 gallons. A loaf of bread is estimated to require 150 gallons between growing the grains and producing the bread. Almonds are just the thing that people decided was the bogeyman this time around. The reason California switched to growing them in the 90s is because during that drought farmers were encouraged to stop growing cotton and think about dollars returned for each gallon of water spent. So from a financial perspective, it's a good investment even if it might not be from a food supply calorie perspective."
shittykickstarters,33g5qr,AndrewZorn,6,Wed Apr 22 13:05:50 2015 UTC,"This is pretty interesting. For anyone who still thinks a single almond is still small, realize that it has the best gallon-to-calorie ratio on that list. (about 100 calories for 14 almonds/gallons - the orange is about 50 calories, and it just gets worse from there in the list, except maybe the bread, which doesn't have the same nutritional value)"
shittykickstarters,33g5qr,LukeTheFisher,4,Wed Apr 22 20:34:26 2015 UTC,You're comparing one almond to a watermelon or even orange? I hope that was some sort of typo.
shittykickstarters,33g5qr,Boyhowdy107,3,Wed Apr 22 22:35:28 2015 UTC,"No. I'm basically saying that it's not horrifically out of line in its water consumption when compared to other things we grow to justify it's new reputation as some water-vampire that we all should be afraid of. If you scale it up to a serving size, they're really not that much more costly in terms of water use, and actually if you view it from the business perspective, you can make more money per gallon of water spent with almonds than other things. I've just been fairly surprised by the public outcry about ""those damn almonds! That's why we're out of water.""  But I've lived in California long enough to know that Californians love choosing things to exclude from their diet â even more so when there's a reason (real or imagined) that we can feel smug about doing it and broadcast our choice to do so."
shittykickstarters,33g5qr,LukeTheFisher,3,Wed Apr 22 22:55:50 2015 UTC,"If you scale it up to a serving size, they're really not that much more costly in terms of water use   Not saying you're wrong but you're argument was built around the fact that they take less water. Per serving/unit of weight they don't. Apples to almonds."

So I thought I'd go down the list."
shittykickstarters,33g5qr,AndrewZorn,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:32:38 2015 UTC,"I did compare it as gallons to calories, which is fair, and almonds are actually great. Comparing size, and thinking ""only an almond"" is the bad way to look at it."

shittykickstarters,33g5qr,amedeus,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:39:41 2015 UTC,"But it's not the whole of California. California has a shortage, not an absence altogether. It only needs to be enough to fill in the gaps. We need to support the current supply, not replace it.  If energy is the problem, you make more energy. I don't hear anything about a massive energy shortage in California, so they must be doing better with that than with water. That's a good start. Throw up solar panels, throw up wind farms. Build more than they actually need. Then, once they've stabilized things a bit better, they can cut back a bit and sell the excess energy to neighboring states to try to recoup some losses, or at least sustain themselves for awhile. Or pay back the federal government or whoever they got the money from in the first place.  The problem with pipelines and shit is that they won't work. Not for long. Drought is slowly but surely going to start effecting the other states (the ones that it hasn't, already), as well. And if California continues to depend on them for their water, instead of becoming self-sustaining, everybody is going to find themselves in the shit, sooner or later. If you have an alternative, everyone's listening. But simply naysaying for the purpose of being the rightest isn't altogether very helpful."
shittykickstarters,33g5qr,ZorbaTHut,2,Wed Apr 22 21:34:03 2015 UTC,"The first problem doesn't come down to water quantity, it comes down to water cost. Desalinated water costs somewhere in the vicinity of $2,000/acre-foot, which is roughly the cost of residential water. Meanwhile, farmers pay about half that.  Which means the real problem isn't about water at all, it's about food prices. It simply does not make economic sense to desalinate water in order to keep farmers' costs low - it would be equivalent to California giving billions of dollars to the rest of the world in the form of cheap food.  Either the Federal government needs to decide that cheap food is important and start funding that on its own, or food prices need to go up."

So, it comes down to a big tradeoff - the renewable generating capacity you install to desalinate water could be used to offset fossil fuel powered capacity. If someone next door is using coal power to run an air conditioner, in the grand scheme of things your desalination plant is running on coal since you could be replacing the coal sourced power with your renewable power."

I'm sorry again for the lack of official updates on the Axent Wear site. As you might know, I am only part of the company and not in full control of all decisions. I hope my co-founder and I will be able to officially update everyone soon, but I cannot make any promises since I am not in control of my co-founder's decisions. In the mean time I will make sure to update everyone as much as I can on my own accounts.   I have noticed there are some rumors and misinformation floating around the internet, so I want to clarify a few things. A website stated we estimate the delivery date to be in September. We never made that announcement and I've tried contacting the website but they did not respond. We also noticed that a lot of e-mails went missing when sent to the hello@axentwear.com e-mail, so we've switched over to AxentWear@gmail.com. Please use this new e-mail for all future customer service inquires.   There are also a lot of misunderstandings about the situation with my co-founder. I can only say that it is very complicated and my attorneys and business consultants are doing everything we can to resolve the issue. People have been suggesting potential solutions in regards to my co-founder, and while I appreciate everyone's attempt to help, please understand that everything that can be done, has been done. There are a lot of complicated legal limitations to consider which is why my attorneys have been working hard on it. I also want to assure everyone that I am paying for the legal fees myself, and I would only use the backer's money to make the headphones.  With that said, we're currently looking at manufacturing proposals. While I can't make any promises. I hope to be able to officially update everyone soon with more information on when the headphones will be delivered.   I understand the delay comes as a disappointment to many who wanted the headphones as a birthday present or gift for loved ones. Manufacturing is a complicated process with a lot of unforeseen difficulties. I'm sorry again for the delay, and I completely understand if you would like a refund. Please send your name, paypal e-mail address, and order date to our customer service at AxentWear@gmail.com and we will process your refund within 3 business days.   I will continue to do my best to update everyone and deliver the headphones in light of these complications with my co-founder. Thank you all again for the continued patience and support.

The best they can do in that size realistically is around 0.15W.  As for the 600mAH battery, the pebble smartwatch battery is 130mAH and takes up half of the space inside. Again, the best you can do in a watch-sized device is probably around 300mAH.  Even if their numbers were true, using some magic unicorn powder, it would still take:  3.7V * 0.6Ah / 0.5W = 4.4 HOURS    Approximately 4.5 HOURS of sitting with this watch pointing directly at the sun, at noon with no clouds in California to charge the internal battery, which would then give your phone no more than a 20% charge.  But with the more realistic numbers, you'd need to sit in the sun for 7.5 hours to get a 10% charge on the phone.  I love how they start the video with ""when I was in collage studying solar energy"". I guess he should get a collage-fee refund."

shittykickstarters,335qdb,_invalidusername,8,Sun Apr 19 21:40:32 2015 UTC,"Collage:       Collage (from the French: coller, ""to glue"";  French pronunciation:Â â[kÉ.laËÊ]) is a technique of an art production, primarily used in the visual arts, where the artwork is made from an assemblage of different forms, thus creating a new whole.  A collage may sometimes include magazine and newspaper clippings, ribbons, paint, bits of colored or handmade papers, portions of other artwork or texts, photographs and other found objects, glued to a piece of paper or canvas. The origins of collage can be traced back hundreds of years, but this technique made a dramatic reappearance in the early 20th century as an art form of novelty.  The term collage was coined by both Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso in the beginning of the 20th century when collage became a distinctive part of modern art.

Small battery backups no larger than a lipstick case exist that are 5 times the mAh of this watch, with the bonus of not having to wear a shitty looking watch.  Or a small 'battery case' that aren't that much bulkier than a regular phone case that double or almost triple the battery life of your phone.

shittykickstarters,335qdb,throwaway_for_qs,9,Mon Apr 20 19:38:39 2015 UTC,"Hi, this is Luke from Hemera Project, I have to say I'm honored that we made it to shittykickstarters in under 48 hrs! We appreciate the fact-checking and interest in the tech behind the project. Please let me offer a little more info and we'll definitely be adding this to the campaign page asap, thanks for letting us know that people actually do care about how things work not just what they look like.  First off, the 0.5W is a silly error that has been fixed, our most recent iteration of design slimmed the form factor down and reduced the solar array to 420mW.  Dimensions will be included soon, but the main face of the QBAND has a cell that is 31.2x31.2 (mm) it does in fact only achieve 180mW on its own (in full sun). So if you were to somehow wear the watch and maintain direct sun exposure it would charge the built in battery in about 12hrs (we do not recommend this, please read on).  Additionally, the QBAND has 6 embedded cells in a unique flexible array. These cells measure at 8.4x26mm each. In total, the array does achieve 420mW and so if laid in direct sun can fully charge the on-board battery in about 5 hrs and 20min.  However, the QBAND is not designed to replace other charging methods and fully charge your phone on a regular basis. The people this product is designed for, have communicated that their phones only regularly die once a week. And even then, it is usually at the end of the day. This device is designed to provide emergency charge; to get you home or to your car where you have an outlet. We have done extensive tests to come up with a solar array that will charge in outdoor or ambient light over several days. If you do nothing other than wear it in your typical daily life it will be fully charged in about 40 hours or 3-4 days. Then when that once-a-week battery dying scenario takes place, you're ready with a little extra juice to get you out of trouble.  Oh, almost forgot about the battery:  Our batteries are custom cut to 31.2x31.2x6.5 mm and do achieve 600mah, although I can't provide you a spec sheet for ours here is one for another 600mah battery with similar dimensions (http://www.houseofbatteries.com/documents/UF553040P.pdf). If you solve for volume you can find for yourself that that capacity is easily achievable for the form factor in the QBAND. The pebble has a lot of tech inside it, the QBAND is very low tech. It's functions are telling time, solar charging a battery, and charging your phone. However, for lots of people that's all they want in a watch!  I'd love to answer any other questions you guys have. And thanks again for the interest and feedback!  edit: forgot the battery spec sheet link TL;DR We made an error advertising 500mW, 420mW is correct, but it does the job for our application"
shittykickstarters,335qdb,Daffan,8,Mon Apr 20 17:39:31 2015 UTC,"It's always nice (and a bit awkward) to have a project creator join in on /r/shittykickstarters. I want to be clear, that I am open to fair discussion and did not came here to make fun of projects at all cost :)  The band has cells! This is the part I've missed - hence my ""0.15W"" estimation, that is close to what you have in the face itself. So 420mW. My bad.  I do see the point of the device - most people using battery packs to charge their smartphones tend to forget to charge the battery pack itself. That is a problem worth solving, definitely. If your research is correct, and it does take 4 days to charge on a typical use basis, than this product is viable and I honestly wish you the best of luck. I can't say I'm not sceptical about the design - placing electronics in the band can prove difficult, especially since the bands need to come in various sizes and have some way of adjusting the size by the user. Similarly, placing the LED array in the band seems to be a manufacturing challenge.  But I am also sceptical about the tests themselves. Would you like to share some details or describe your methodology? I can only do ballpark numbers, but with a 420mW system set around a semi-circle I'm guessing you can assume an average 200mW of power production when the watch is exposed to the sun, regardless of how the device is oriented, right? Now, according to this study adult people spend 181 hours outdoors between 9AM and 3PM per year. That's barely half an hour per day. Even if we double that number to account for the hours of sunlight after 3PM, we're still at 1 hour of being outdoors per day. Being even more optimistic, if we always happen to have a sunny day, and never travel near tall buildings that cast shade, we're at 1h*200mW = 0.2Wh generated per day - that's barely 9% of the 600mAH battery in question (and we should still take into account the energy lost on the charging circuitry)  As for indoor generation, did you test and measure that? In a typical office illuminated by fluorescent lights the irradiation is in the order of 10W / square meter. That's 100 times less than direct sunlight! Even at 12 hours per day, 2mW*12h = 0.024Wh - that's 1% of the internal battery capacity.  So with my very optimistic assumptions, I'm getting 10 days in between charges. That wouldn't be bad, but a more realistic assumption would be double that - 20 days per charge. And there still is a risk of having the charging circuitry drain more power than is bering generated. I would really, really recommend making an actual, physical, working prototype of the device to make sure that it's a viable charging solution, before selling that dream to the people and committing to something that might be impossible to deliver."
shittykickstarters,335qdb,IgnitedSpade,6,Mon Apr 20 23:37:50 2015 UTC,"So the watch is ugly as sin, and you're telling me I have to wear it for ~40hours to get a single charge?

However, because zygomycota has been identified as polyphyletic, and is not included in modern fungal classification systems, the diseases that zygomycosis can refer to are better called by their specific names: mucormycosis  (after Mucorales), phycomycosis  (after Phycomycetes) and basidiobolomycosis (after Basidiobolus).  These rare yet serious and potentially life-threatening fungal infections usually affect the face or oropharyngeal (nose and mouth) cavity.  Zygomycosis type infections are most often caused by common fungi found in soil and decaying vegetation. While most individuals are exposed to the fungi on a regular basis, those with immune disorders (immunocompromised) are more prone to fungal infection.    These types of infections are also common after natural disasters, such as tornadoes or earthquakes, where people have open wounds that have become filled with soil or vegetative matter.

Weâve just won the Best Startup Award at the Hong Kong ICT Awards 2015. Below is a brief description of the ICT Award:  The Hong Kong ICT Awards aims at recognizing and promoting outstanding information and communications technology (ICT) solutions and applications, thereby encouraging innovation and excellence among Hong Kongâs ICT talents and enterprises in their constant pursuit for creative and better solutions to meet business and social needs.  The Hong Kong ICT Awards was established in 2006 with the collaborative efforts of the industry, academia and the Government. Steered by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, and organized by 10 Hong Kong ICT industry associations and professional bodies, the Awards aim at building a locally espoused and internationally acclaimed brand of ICT awards.  With the full demonstration of Arist Solution to the Hong Kong ICT Award Organization and some 3rd party media reporters, although thereâs no prize money for winning this award, but receiving it is still very rewarding as itâs another acknowledgment of the hard work our teamâs put in. Also, the recognition this award brings will help us attract more talented members to our team.  New Website  We have launched our new website (http://www.aristcafe.com/)! As we are expanding our company beyond just a Kickstarter campaign, we realized a better and more comprehensible message is needed to help the world better understand our mission. This new website serves as an improved medium to spread our message to the world and aligns the message more closely with our new vision and current status by driving the right branding image to the right audiences.  New Home Page:  Home Page Home Page New Feature Page:  Feature Page Feature Page New About Us Page:  About Us Page About Us Page  Website â Preorder  As many of you may have noticed, the pre-order function on our website was paused two months ago due to our 2015 fulfilment threshold having been met.  The volume of preorders was so large it exceeded our manufacturing capacity. To ensure we can deliver the Arist to everyone, we briefly stopped taking pre-orders. And now, we are proud to announce we were able to increase our manufacturing capacity and have resumed accepting preorders again on our newly designed website.  Question Clarifications  Thereâs actually a bit of misinformation we want to clarify.   Scams and copies  There have been quite a few complaints of a fraudulent âArist-likeâ campaign on other platform. Weâve been accused of attempting to âscam backersâ money by replicating the Arist project under a different name on another crowdfunding platformâ. The project in question, I.D.I.B., is not of our doing and was removed by indiegogo within a few days. We want to put to rest the rumors that we tried to scam backers on other platforms. Sales  The total order from the Kickstarter campaign is 3,000 machines. The total order after the Kickstarter campaign is 25,000. T-Shirts and Coffee Starter Kit shipments  We have only shipped T-shirts and Coffee Starter Kits to backers who have ordered them separately, otherwise we will ship them to you together with your Arist Machine. At this moment we have already shipped those awards to our $25, $50, and $99 backers who have completed our survey of picking the T-shirt size. Media Coverages  We have never spent any money for any media coverage / attention. All media interviews were requested proactively from the media companies. We have less than 200 backers residing in Hong Kong, so itâs not effective to spend our marketing money in Hong Kong. We are very focused on delivering the machine to the market at this moment and we will put budget into Sales & Marketing when we are ready to distribute the Arist. San Francisco Office  At this stage of our development, we have moved all of our resources to Hong Kong for effective communication and development, mainly due to the close proximity to our manufacturers and partners. ToSavour Cafe workshop  The ToSavour Cafe workshop was used to conduct research in coffee drinking habits of the local population and data collection. Now that we have sufficient data for our intended purposes, we have closed that part of our business.   Modularization  What is modularization?  Itâs the ability to remove and replace Aristâs Grinder, Water Pump, Heater, and Brew group easily. We referenced this design concept from Xeroxâs photocopiers.  Why do we need modularization?  Itâs expensive to have tech service centers worldwide, not to mention itâs time consuming to bring your machine in for repair and then return for the pickup later. The whole process can be much more convenient and cost effective if we can directly ship you replaceable parts so your machine is up and running once youâve received the new parts, and you can take your time to send us back the old malfunctioned components. In addition, this will give us the ability to upgrade your component in the most convenient way. We are standing firm on making this come true.  What are the Challenges involved?  A major challenge weâve had to overcome during manufacturing is to ensure every component of the Arist is modularized. As modularization is a new concept for coffee machines, weâre not able to use already existing parts used in other coffee machines. That means we had to produce many of the components to fit our modularized model. Skipping this step would be an easy solution, but having modularized components is essential to the success of our company.  Grinder Material  Problems with todayâs grinder:  The base material is designed to brew up to 100,000 cups of coffee, but manufacturing these burr grinders is an expensive process. The tooling, machines, and material involved are very costly. Thatâs why todayâs grinders are short. Grinding beans with short burr requires a fast motor, which will generate more heat and destroy the delicate flavor in the beans.  Our New Grinder design:  For a home-use machine, itâs unnecessary to use a commercial grade grinder and you shouldnât need to pay for one. So we are using a material that is less dense to cut costs. With a less expensive material, we can build a longer grinder which doesnât require a fast motor anymore to produce the same results. The slower motor produces less heat, which leads to better quality. In addition, wear and tear is not a problem, because the grinder is easily replaceable due to our modularized design. Aristâs new grinder targets to last for 5000 cups of coffee. With an average of 5 cups per day, it may last for 3 years.  New Water Heater  Our key mission is to brew good coffee consistently and controlling water temperature is a critical part. Our new water heater is smaller, faster and more efficient, and has higher precision than conventional heaters.  The above figure illustrates our test results from January; please focus on the red line from our final trial. The consistent rate of water temperature increase seen between 80Â°C to 98Â°C shows that water temperature control within the temperatures required to brew coffee can be very consistent and precise.  Due to patent issues, we cannot reveal the final design here. The above image was taken during the prototype phase back in 2014 in one of our hardware partnerâs lab. Due to patent issues, we cannot reveal the final design here. The above image was taken during the prototype phase back in 2014 in one of our hardware partnerâs lab.  New Machine Design (Reveal for 1st time, do not share)  After the update about increasing the size of the Arist, many of you expressed your discontent and your concerns about aesthetics. We heard you! And we want our machine to be as beautiful and elegant as it deserves too.  Embodied in the new design is our desire to have the design concept resonate more harmoniously with the theme of our coffee solution, which is bringing the future of coffee to the present, but at the same time keeping the minimalist form of the old design. The result is a completely new techno organic design re-architected from different form factors thatâs inspired by interstellar spaceships and organelles.  The new design is not only aesthetically pleasing, but also serves a practical function. By eliminating the weird angles caused by concepts from geometric modeling, the new curved-single-bodied design maximizes inner volume for internal components. This is a huge step in helping us solve some problems in the manufacturing stage. The new design also includes a cup warmer in the drip tray and other features that will be disclosed in a later update.  This is the first time weâve unveiled our new design. We hope you like it. If you have any feedback, please leave your comments at the bottom of this update."

We're talking like an hour of coding for anyone who knows what they are doing. For someone using this as a learning project though, maybe it'll take some time.   The per-unit cost ($200) doesn't even seem that bad. You take the cost of the pi, a power adapter, the case, a wifi adapter, the telegraph key, plus throw in some money for assembly time, and it's not actually that unreasonable. Would anyone want this? Who knows. It's easy enough to hook a key up to a PC to practice, but then the amateur radio crowd is pretty damn weird sometimes.   The lack of effort in the kickstarter and just the vibe he gives off is what makes this shitty."

shittykickstarters,335d03,autowikibot,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:58:33 2015 UTC,"PID controller:       A proportional-integral-derivative controller (PID controller) is a control loop feedback mechanism (controller) widely used in industrial control systems. A PID controller calculates an error value as the difference between a measured process variable and a desired setpoint. The controller attempts to minimize the error by adjusting the process through use of a manipulated variable.  The PID controller algorithm involves three separate constant parameters, and is accordingly sometimes called three-term control: the proportional, the integral and derivative values, denoted P, I, and D. Simply put, these values can be interpreted in terms of time: P depends on the present error, I on the accumulation of past errors, and D is a prediction of future errors, based on current rate of change.  The weighted sum of these three actions is used to adjust the process via a control element such as the position of a control valve, a damper, or the power supplied to a heating element.  In the absence of knowledge of the underlying process, a PID controller has historically been considered to be the most useful controller.  By tuning the three parameters in the PID controller algorithm, the controller can provide control action designed for specific process requirements. The response of the controller can be described in terms of the responsiveness of the controller to an error, the degree to which the controller overshoots the setpoint, and the degree of system oscillation. Note that the use of the PID algorithm for control does not guarantee optimal control of the system or system stability.

People really want the Linux desktop market share to grow but the Linux community refuse to agree on a single GUI. Instead we get all these options which seem great at first.

I worked in an autoshop when i was 12, got my first real job at 16. How you can be 22, unemployed yet begging for money on the internet blows my mind"
shittykickstarters,32x99c,BearWithHat,2,Tue Apr 21 04:55:56 2015 UTC,For me a strong work ethic was instilled in me at an early age: 'you have to work hard to survive.' If that's true or not is beside the point I'm trying to make though.  It's a hard realization to come to that not everyone has the same work ethic you or I have.
shittykickstarters,32x99c,Svx_blue,8,Tue Apr 21 12:28:14 2015 UTC,Have there actually been any successful campaigns like this? There's definitely a lot of them.
shittykickstarters,32x99c,myrm,7,Fri Apr 17 17:50:01 2015 UTC,"Sadly yes, IF the streamer/youtuber is already semi famous, those people will donate to them."
shittykickstarters,32x99c,Tikuf,24,Fri Apr 17 18:40:08 2015 UTC,Which is fairly reasonable. I wouldn't mind throwing money to a small time DJ that I like to replace a laptop or some such purchase. But thats because I already know they make quality content. I wouldn't give it to someone with a bunch of garbage on soundcloud.
shittykickstarters,32x99c,DerNubenfrieken,5,Fri Apr 17 18:50:19 2015 UTC,I also would not mind. I watch a few small/medium fan based size streamers and if one had something happen preventing them from streaming I would not have an issue contributing.  I fucking hate seeing these campaigns though. What makes you so fucking special that you expect people to pay for your high end rig(in this case not so much)?   A lot of streamers started from the ground up with no fans and no support. Go do the fucking same...
shittykickstarters,32x99c,IAmTheProtocol,3,Fri Apr 17 22:23:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, people get serious about their streamers.  People actually pay them $5 a month for...  nothing, really.  A lot of people.  I still can't figure out why people pay this money, they apparently don't get anything out of it other than the ability to talk in their IRC channel which, if the stream is big enough, is 1,000 people all talking at once anyway.  Really, I don't understand it."
shittykickstarters,32x99c,uzimonkey,4,Sat Apr 18 03:02:06 2015 UTC,"I don't personally sub to any streamers, but I've considered it, and it cause I usually watch streams with ads off, so I'd be supporting the streamer"
shittykickstarters,32x99c,Krossfireo,2,Sat Apr 18 03:04:38 2015 UTC,It's a way to support people who give you content that you like. I give to a podcast network and Giantbomb because I like their conent. Same with giving to a twtich streamer.
shittykickstarters,32x99c,tankintheair315,16,Sat Apr 18 14:35:18 2015 UTC,Its funny because I stream on a 300$ laptop. If his computer randomly restarts and he does not know why I would not give him a single penny because its guaranteed hes gonna fuck that one up to. Also those fans look like nazi symbols. Just saying.

But every project needs a plan for creating something and sharing it with the world. At some point, the creator should be able to say: âItâs finished. Hereâs what we created.

When the user touches the rod, a hand will be displayed firmly grasping the rod.  The user may slide the hand back and forth over the rod, but if his fingers break contact with the screen, the hand will let go.  Maintaining a grip on the rod thus ensures that both hands remain occupied (one holding the phone, the other ""holding"" the rod), and therefore the users' hands will be unable to engage in other activity. As the user slides the virtual hand back and forth across the virtual rod, virtual friction is created.  Sliding faster creates more friction.  With increased friction, the rod will eventually begin to heat up and glow.  The end goal is to make the rod white-hot.  The user should feel free to engage in this activity with righteous vigor.  When the goal is finally achieved, the rod will melt away in an explosion of fireworks, and the app will play soothing gurgling/splashing sounds to help the user relax and bask in the glow of a job well-done."

shittykickstarters,32ls59,poopymcfuckoff,3,Wed Apr 15 14:24:04 2015 UTC,Same reason people keep putting more and more money into a scam whilst other people are begging them to stop.   Its some psychological principle where its easier to just keep believing and going along with something. I think its called the sunk cost fallacy. You keep paying more to avoid losing your initial sunk costs / investment.   So in this case people keep continuing to believe because they don't want to 'lose' the few hundred dollars they have already invested.

It grinds the beans, brews the coffee beverage of choice, and adds in the powder or whatever as desired.  Magically it never needs to be cleaned and is somehow the size of a blender.  (I'm leaving out features they promise because the list is long and ridiculous.)  The reality is that actuators and motors needed to do this sort of stuff take up space and are expensive (I forgot to mention it was going to be relatively cheap).  Even purpose built coffee grinders have a shitty track record for reliability and are messy.  This ""company"" gathered a shit ton of money based on wild promises and some very misleading photos (exploded views that allegedly show all the internals but leave out... all the difficult stuff).  Many people continue to believe in a product that was never going to happen."

shittykickstarters,32ls59,exclamationmarek,18,Thu Apr 16 22:17:49 2015 UTC,"Adding to /u/brufleth and just to be clear, there are machines that grind beans and brew coffee with a single press of a button, and clean themselves automatically, only requiring a descaling tablet once every month or two (which the Arist also is supposed to require)  What makes the Arist different and a scam, is that it adds a lot of features to the traditional fully automatic espresso maker, at the same time lowering the price and being more compact. These ""features"" include:   brewing water pressure control (that's expensive mechanics) refrigerated milk container powder containers for cocoa and sugar (dificult mechanics for dosing, especially when the powder is exposed to steam and starts sticking) smartphone integration (expensive electronics and software) brewing temperature control (this, additively, can't be that hard. but still, another couple of cents per device, and hours of development) two bean container, for different types of coffee beams (this may sound trivial, but one you think about it, it requires either an additional grinder, or two additional mechanical devices that dose the beans before they reach the grinder. In a normal espresso maker the container simply sits on top of the grinder ""flooding"" it with beans constantly. Once you turn on the grinder, new beans replace the ones that are grind by simply falling from the container, with no feeding mechanics necessary. Cheap, simple, reliable. The artist can't have that, unless it has two expensive grinders)   And on top of that, you typical ""shitty kickstarter checklist"": No working prototype, original kickstarter video shows people soldering an Arduino board (something you would never do developing any electronic device), team lies about where they are located (China vs California) etc."
shittykickstarters,32ls59,MileHighBarfly,3,Wed Apr 15 11:18:33 2015 UTC,"Coffee roaster here, just going to chime in. Any grinder that can grind even halfway decent espresso would be more expensive than the advertised production price. So would the plethora of dedicated PID's used to govern all the features.   Also there's no way in hell it could run on any outlet in a home. All this stuff needs three phase power at a massive voltage."

Out of the hundreds of thousands of people who saw their campaign pitch video, the 2500 were convinced enough to pay a little bit - multiply one by the other and you get a lot of money. Though obviously it is a shame that all this money will most likely go to waste.   Similarily, why would people ""invest"" so much into Justin Bieber. They don't. It's just the magic of multiplying just a little bit of pocket money, times a lot of teenagers.

shittykickstarters,32jjbk,BradGroux,34,Tue Apr 14 08:26:59 2015 UTC,"This is a cross-post from /r/kickstarter:  I was doing some late night Kickstarter browsing and stumbled upon a really cheap band. I have Microsoft Band which I paid $200 for - and the thought of getting something similar for only $35 intrigued me... and then I began reading the comments.  In the comments, one person brings up how a guy with a degree in accounting got so far building such a piece of technology. Another commenter links to this page, which shows an identical product on sale for $32.90. I did some digging, and found the same product on Alibaba for even less (especially when ordered in bulk).   If you check the comments page for the project, you can see that the guy is a huge bullshit artists - here are a few highlights from his replies thus far:   Vidonn is our team in China. We combine the Chinese manufacturingâs advantage and our design& service teamâs advantage here in U.S. in order to bring you the most at least cost. We incorporate two different companies in both U.S. and China due to many complex concerns from local policies to marketing strategies. In addition to what I replied to ivir earlier, here is more detailed information: we launched two different versions of our product in two markets due to the differences in wearable market and policies: one in China mainland, the other for the rest of the world. The main issue for the two versions is the quality and the customer service behind the product. We believe that our product is more suitable in the more developed market with all the top quality materials, continuously updated firmware and customer services we could provide. I believe that you would agree that the product itself would worth much less without all these.   So, they have a ""team"" in China who built the EXACT same product - but they feel they can build it better, even though their company didn't even have a website until February 13th 2015? Seems totally legit.   TL;DR - A Kickstarter that has 640+ backers  and has raised more than it's $30,000 goal with 30 days left is simply reselling Chinese products from Alibaba.   This is a similar incident for those familiar with the ROCK Smartwatch - Kickstarter."

We were inspired to create games and literally came up with a dozen solid/semi-solid ideas and started narrowing them down to the ones we thought were the strongest. Then we decided to release them in order of which ones would be crowd-pleasers and the most popular first. POOP: The Game is definitely a hit and actually a much larger hit than we ever expected. We're sticking with it and expanding the POOP line but plan to release many more games in the future."

I admit I was trolling and was looking to get enough donations to pay my car off. If anyone suffered any real anguish or pain from this I am truly sorry. I never promised a single dime to Michael Slager and was careful not to say that I was. I was, as a gesture of fair play, going to seek a way to get him some small token of the donations (I was, of course, using his name and likeness). To the family of Walter Scott, if they've even seen this page, and I hope they haven't, you have my deepest sympathies, I cannot imagine the pain and suffering you must be going through having to relive your loved ones death over and over, in media and on the internet. To Officer Slager I am not a hateful person and I imagine you arenât either. You acted from a bad place and life is punishing you far more than my hate ever would.  To everyone who scorned, sent me a bag of dicks, or threatened my life, I want to say I am very proud of each and every one of you. I created this monster to attract monsters and you took up arms together to destroy it. You are the people that make our world great, and society livable. To the misguided, the racist and bigots that donated, sorry but not sorry, please try to get your heads out of your asses it's 2015. There is no good reason to support this man financially unless you are someone in his family or his friend. If youâre neither of those Iâm sure youâre overlooking someone in your own life or community that could use the help much more. Letâs face it he's a fuck up, and he's destroyed his life, taken Walter L. Scott's life and devastated both of their families in the process.  If you're still reading I'm about to go on a rant about police and our American culture. I've had the opportunity to look into Michael Slager's eyes watching these videos over and over. I can only come to the conclusion that because of his work, he'd become desensitized to the humanity of African-Americans. I don't know enough about him to know if he was a racist. I'd hope he wasn't. It does seem to me though, that police of all races dehumanize and disrespect the very people they're charged with protecting. Minorities bear the brunt of this callousness and become its most vulnerable victims, African-Americans at the highest rate. If itâs a side effect of the job it needs to be addressed and treated, if it's part of their training, it needs to stop.   This may be part of a larger problem with American society, some would say the media, and others our education system which downplays the role of anyone who is not white and male. Those who wield power only seem to care about money and how they and their friends, contributors, and stock-holders can get more. We as a culture seem to know this but are powerless or unwilling to change it. We must.  Maybe the job itself, which makes you interact confrontationally with people on a regular basis, is the reason for this. If the people for whom you work, the community you work in, can't trust you, or are afraid of you, they will wish you ill, obfuscate your intent, kill you and celebrate your demise. Any threatened community would do the same. Your job is no longer a noble profession if you allow your peers to dehumanize and abuse without intercession. Your laws are meaningless if they abuse individuals, bankrupt households and cause generational poverty. You will never have respect if you try to enforce them, if the downtrodden are the brunt of your cruel jokes, and you carry yourself with disdain for those you serve. Act better.  City and local governments turn a blind eye to municipal indenturement if it fills the coffers of their budgetary bloat. In my community, the Black community, mothers, fathers and children are being killed by soulless automatons with semi-automatic weapons who've been brainwashed, either by training, their peers or their individual interactions, to think that everyone whose skin isn't white doesn't have value. It does.  We all should strive to be better people, to love those we are drawn to hate, to be kind to those we would normally ignore, and help those who cannot or will not help themselves. No one ever promised life would be easy and if it were it would be a meaningless and empty endeavor. Think of anything you cherish or love then think of what you had to go through to obtain it, that journey was life. Itâs not easy but itâs worth it. Promote love.  I am sorry.   At the end he has a meme of Scooby with the line ""And I would have gotten away with it too if it wasn't for you meddling kids.  TL;DR: Troll who wanted to make money off of racist biggots, because he feels they deserve all the bad that comes to them."
shittykickstarters,326tew,Narayume,49,Sat Apr 11 11:10:39 2015 UTC,"We all should strive to be better people, to love those we are drawn to hate, to be kind to those we would normally ignore, and help those who cannot or will not help themselves.   Interesting addendum to, what was previously a Facebook page full of reactionary pandering and ultra nationalist clickbait. As much as I do agree with his pleas for racial tolerance and humanism, his attempted fraud makes his subsequent sociological noodling seem facile. It takes a certain amount of gall to exploit the murder of an innocent victim for your own financial gain, and then claim to love them once your exploitation attempt is exposed.

That is pretty basic discrimination. As far as I can see the campaign had nothing to do with the hate group the creator seems to belong to.   But I am not American and am not as informed about what is currently going on in your country as some of you might be. So maybe I am in no position to comment, it just feels wrong.  EDIT: Before downvoting me, please explain how this is different from banning someone's indigogo for the creator being a member of the islamic faith."
shittykickstarters,326tew,DoctorsHateHim,3,Sat Apr 11 09:18:27 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm probably going to create a campaign to raise money for this officer out of the sheer principle of the thing.

shittykickstarters,326tew,dead-dove-do-not-eat,7,Sat Apr 11 10:18:27 2015 UTC,"Please explain how it is different from removing someones indigogo because its creator is a member of islam.    It's not. What's wrong with that? If you're trying to imply that Indiegogo is somehow discriminating against the campaign's creator because of his affiliation (or, as in your example, his religion), you'd be wrong. If I go and beat up someone because he's a muslim, that's discrimination. Look at the reductio ad absurdum: should Indiegogo be forced to host a campaign that raises funds for a terrorist group, or a group that wants to raise money to commit genocide against Aboriginal Australians? They can reserve the right to provide campaigns to whomever they want, as defined in their terms.      Furthermore, there is an official FBI definition of a ""hate crime"" and I believe there is an official list of ""hate groups"" watched by the FBI. I am not a lawyer, but I'm guessing that there is a world of trouble that businesses like Indiegogo don't want to deal with if they are found abetting a hate group."
shittykickstarters,326tew,DoctorsHateHim,4,Sat Apr 11 10:58:34 2015 UTC,"Not saying I disagree with you, but it is discrimination. Maybe not in the legal sense, but in the definition of the word. Discrimination can be doing something bad to someone because of the affiliation to a group, or preventing someone affiliated with a group from having the same privileges as someone affiliated with a different group, solely because of their groups."
shittykickstarters,326tew,DoctorsHateHim,-1,Sat Apr 11 14:33:52 2015 UTC,"Discrimination against racists, that's pretty ironic."
shittykickstarters,326tew,thejadefalcon,4,Sat Apr 11 14:53:10 2015 UTC,Obviously. That doesn't change the fact that it is still discrimination.

shittykickstarters,326tew,lordpoee,2,Sat Apr 11 10:59:52 2015 UTC,"The thing that gets me is that, while I have no issues with them blocking raising money for a group, blocking individuals who are raising money separate from the group seems going a little too far. Are they probably a shitty person? Likely. But I'm not convinced blocking their fundraising because of who they might be affiliated with is okay."
shittykickstarters,326tew,lordpoee,-2,Sat Apr 11 19:51:36 2015 UTC,Good job! Maybe Indiegogo isn't as shitty as I thought.
shittykickstarters,326tew,lordpoee,-1,Sat Apr 11 07:59:44 2015 UTC,"Won't change a thing. Slager will be acquitted. Recent analysis of the video provides reasonable doubt on Slagers behalf. The fleeing felon rule is crap but its pretty clear after looking at the video frame by frame that Scott and Slager were briefly wrestling over the taser. Both Scott and Slager were hit with the taser which leads me to believe it may have discharged during the struggle. Which means the witness flat out lied and this would also explain why the witness kept the video camera down until the critical moment. That part struck me as fishy and now it makes perfect sense. Unfortunately under the fleeing felon rule a police officer can peg you if you run, especially after a struggle. So, once again the police state wins. I don't really feel bad for this Walter Scott guy anyway. I do always do a dance when a cop is cut down a peg or two though."
shittykickstarters,326tew,lordpoee,2,Fri Apr 17 04:50:07 2015 UTC,"What video are you watching? Just because they disengaged from a scuffle, doesn't mean the officer lost control of his weapon. Also, the burden of proof is on the officer, given that he initially lied about who ultimately possessed the Taser until the video surfaced, and thus immediately charged with murder and stripped of his duties. It also doesn't bode well that he refused to talk to initial investigators and his attorney resigned.  The ""fleeing felon"" precedent as I've seen it applied, wouldn't protect the officer in this case as he would have to prove that he believed Scott was an immediate and felonious threat to public safety; I hope he has a good lawyer. If the prosecutor manages to get the video cleaned up enough so that the item dropped near Mr. Scoot's body is reasonably identified as Slager's weapon, no jury in the world is going to let this man walk without cost."

They have however managed to update their web site and start accepting pre-orders again at the $600 level.

shittykickstarters,321rju,Thatgirl31,-2,Fri Apr 10 14:36:46 2015 UTC,I don't think they are worried about that. He asked for details of how the machine works. If their patent isn't made yet they won't want to give that out in fear that it will be copied before they could get it to market.  Honestly there are places in china always looking for new products like this they could quickly copy and flood the market. They have money small places like them don't.  So I understand why they wouldn't want to give out details about how they work.
shittykickstarters,321rju,Pavl_,10,Fri Apr 10 18:43:14 2015 UTC,"Nobody asked for internal design specs. The backers just wanted to see a basic video of their machine in operation, which was promised and then cancelled immediately when the kickstarter funds cleared.   The quote about the project failing doesn't even have anything to do with it. The project creator is trying to say their $8.5 million project might fail because of Kickstarter backers being mean to them.    These negative comments are extremely demotivating and puts on toll on moral. To me, no other challenge could be worse than seeing our team lose momentum and their passion for their work.

shittykickstarters,321rju,450k_crackparty,3,Fri Apr 10 16:12:24 2015 UTC,"Because people assume, wrongly, that they are protected. It's ingrained that you 'buy' something, you get what you pay for.   People are not getting that they are 'investing', and that means doing your due diligence before taking the risk- except the kicker of Kickstarter is that project creator's don't have to provide the info that allows people to do their due diligence. They can make any claims they want on production times and product features and have no accountability. They don't have to accurately fill out the 'risks' portion.   Kickstarter doesn't even enforce their own working prototype rules. They're happy to look the other way and keep taking their percent cut from projects, scams or failures included.  Indiegogo is even worse, it's just the Nigerian prince email of websites now with that Flexible Funding bullshit.   Crowd-funding is fundamentally broken."

I understand that stuff takes time, and I really do understand that you don't always have something to show for your work, but 4 months of ""can't show, trust us"" is not acceptable.

No, the point of Kickstarter is to raise capital. That's what the ""kickstart"" is. What did you think the name meant?  The reason why it's not a good gauge for how much market actually exists is because it's a limited audience: internet users who know what kickstarter is who would spend money to in effect ""vote"" something into existence.

The fat guy who died 2 hours later of a heart attack after resisting arrest was pretty cut and dry as well.  That didn't stop #blacklivesmatter from being a thing that happened.    I'm just saying we can't look at things in a vacuum.  With people spinning this as ""YET ANOTHER WHITE COP WHO SHOT A BLACK MAN"" we have to assume that people will think of those other ""slayings"" and have a gut reaction that sides with the police, just as some side with the criminals.

I guess my thought it is that choking someone shouldn't really be a go-to maneuver, especially when someone is already on the ground. If you have to use it, then maybe stop after a couple minutes, especially when the person is using the last of their air reserves to plead that they can't breathe. What do I know, though, I am just an emotional leftist or something.  As regards to the recent killing, the video clearly shows Officer Slager dropping the taser from his belt, next to the body of the man he just shot eight times in the back. Then he made up a story about the taser being snatched. I am pretty sure that is about as clear as victimhood gets. Unless with the ""snatched a gun"" portion you are referring to Michael Brown, I am pretty confused by your point."

shittykickstarters,31wplh,ClintHammer,7,Thu Apr 9 00:16:08 2015 UTC,"This is a common misconception. At any given time, about 30% of your lungs capacity in the bronchioles is ""reserve air,"" and that air can be expended to speak without there being the possibility of new air entering the airway. Divers train and develop their lung capacities by increasing these reserves.  The body doesn't require new air to speak, and the reserve air can be completely drained of oxygen content while still being usable for speech: carbon dioxide works with vocal chords just as well as nitrogen/oxygen/carbon dioxide mix does.  Either way, science won't change your mind because you are pretty sure that any black man that dies during police apprehension had it coming to them.

But if he would only build a real prototype and try using it, he would realize that it does not make anything faster or easier.  Also have to love the $9000 tier to get one.

If you happen to want such a thing and don't mind a bit of faffing about you can order a cheap router from China for less than half the cost of the anonabox and reflash it yourself.  You get access to set your own password, as opposed to anonabox's attempt (and failure) to restrict access to the config.  Largely just to play around, I got a WT2030H for $17 on aliexpress including postage from China, loaded this openWRT firmware, ran the script to install tor from http://onionwrt.link and had it functional in 10 minute.  Alternative instructions in an r/technology article https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2jjrd6/anonabox_is_no_more_or_how_to_build_your_own/  As mentioned in the engadget article, anonymity can be ruined by using the same browser on a normal connection and over tor because you can be identified by cookies. A standard browser carries a higher risk of being vulnerable to exploits than the tor browser. A while back the FBI took over a load of onion sites and used a security hole to deanonymise a load of people who had not updated their browser.  If you want to provide open wifi to whoever is nearby without getting any complaints about what they get up to (DMCA for torrents or whatever) then maybe one of these is a solution.

I hold the opinion that it is certain that loads of agencies are running most or all of the exit node traffic through lots of automated analysis and will have people trying to pick out the stuff that is of interest to them. I don't do anything that they are likely to care about but I prefer not to actively put myself on their radar.  You are probably thinking of this incident last year, windows exe files downloaded over tor were being modified by one bad exit node. https://www.leviathansecurity.com/blog/the-case-of-the-modified-binaries/  My understanding is that blatantly bad exit nodes get booted off fairly quickly. An exit node that send an exe when a normal webpage is requested won't last long.  Anytime you send a plaintext password via tor, such as some unimportant website that dosn't use https or POP email, there is a risk of the exit node operator sniffing it. A few years ago somebody got loads of passwords for embassys and things that way. I understand it's very common for people to be totally unaware of that risk."

Also, the description of the ""Satan Cologne"" candle is too long for something that's repeated a lot in the descriptions of the rewards and doesn't even have its own paragraph.

shittykickstarters,31opgg,n1ckra,23,Mon Apr 6 23:22:47 2015 UTC,I can tell you something.  What we have here is a mainboard with a spot for a 32-pin Atmel microcontroller.  If I were a betting man I'd guess ATMega328.  Board was probably built by DorkbotPBX guessing by the color of the board and the apparent budget of the outfit that ordered it.  It is attached to a MX-FS-03V 433MHz transmitter.  Right in the middle of a popular HAM band... thank goodness this will never see the light of day.  But if that goes into production your HAM radio neighbor can troll you by keying up his $30 baofeng and jamming the coms of your home automation system.  That little radio module can only TX.  So all he has here is the ability to report back the values of several analog and digital inputs.  Basically a $25 glorified thermometer that judging by the reward levels doesn't come with a hub... so you'll have to build and program that yourself.
shittykickstarters,31opgg,foreverska,7,Tue Apr 7 04:51:32 2015 UTC,"Errr, isn't 433MHz license free anyway? Basically every car keyfob works on 433MHz."

Even if it wasn't the FCC generally stays out of your home as long as your signals stay out of everybody else's.  The worry anyway is that these cheap Chinese transmitters are dirty and will blast harmonics all over the band made worse by the fact he is meaning for people to have 20 of these things in their house chattering away all day."

shittykickstarters,31mwh5,dauntless9,2,Tue Apr 7 20:28:56 2015 UTC,"Looks like it's been taken down now, so I can't be sure exactly how this project did it, but if done well, splitting the shipping/handling from the main rewards can be quite a sensible move on IGG. If s/h costs vary significantly depending on the destination, then it actually streamlines things to let people pledge a fixed amount to get the main reward and add on a separate s/h perk for their specific location. Otherwise you can wind up with ""perk as-shipped-to-US"", ""perk-as-shipped-to-W-Europe"", ""perk-as-shipped-to-Singapore"", etc., and since IGG doesn't let you go back and modify a pledge, the only way you'd have to fix a ""shipped-to-Greenland"" when you meant to pick ""to-Canada"" is to re-pledge the entire amount, leaving you with two perks only one of which you wanted and only one of which will actually get to you.  Or you can set the main perk at a fixed amount and tell people to top up their pledge with a given additional fee--""choose the $20 perk but pledge $23 to cover the shipping""--but people invariably forget to do that too, and without a separate s/h perk there's no good way for them to make an additional pledge that's clearly designated as shipping fees (as opposed to a spontaneous additional & unperked donation of $7.50 or whatever).  So in principle it can be a sane structure, provided it's applied to, you know, sane & non-scammy projects, which leaves this one out."

Now, any stadard lossless compression like DEFLATE would easily shrink the size by a factor of 10 considering the small amount of chars used and the amount of repetitions in the english language, so let's make it 100k books for 2,5x1011 chars.

shittykickstarters,31lzfy,KevinHotaling,6,Mon Apr 6 11:26:13 2015 UTC,"I did read the text, it has a lighthearted tone, but you titled the kickstarter ""Button: The Movie""  and made it seem like you fully intended to make a trailer/youtube documentary.   ...    Our primary objective is make a short trailer that highlights the almighty Button. This will be distributed for free, worldwide via YouTube (a button dependent platform). Hitler wants to control The Button, so either you support The Button, or you support Hitler.   ...    If the Button's will be done (aka we raise $10k), we'll produce a film at least 10 minutes in length, including professional cinematography, titling, editing, and production.   ...    We're confident that we can produce stickers, t-shirts, and short YouTube documentary without issue.[...]    It really just seems like you're trying to ride the line, so you can get some people who believe you to give money, but if anybody calls you out you can claim it's all just a joke.   And again, one of the main issues is the fact that the kickstarter claims to be about the movie, but you'll only make it if you get $10,000. But as long as you pass that $500 mark, you get to keep the extra money without being obligated to make the film.   It's basically cheating to give yourself a ""flexible funding"" option on kickstarter, which specifically disallows it."

In the previous update, 12 days ago, they discuss why they chose the MSP430 processor (which just happens to be the processor onboard the projector demo board they play with). They give the following reason for choosing it over any of the modern, cheap and easily available Cortex M0 compatible processors:   Digit capacity and throughput of Cortex is higher, but Ritot watch has no need in additional computational capabilities.    Yet, a couple of sentences later they pick the CC2650 ""bluetooth module"", not knowing that the CC2650 is actually a way more powerful Cortex M3 CPU, with a built-in bluetooth stack. It's has multiple times the power of the old 16-bit MSP430.  It's designed so that you don't need any other processor in your device, it handles both bluetooth and whatever else you may need in the bluetooth device you are making... It's completely pointless to have the MSP430."

shittykickstarters,31kiru,939319,7,Mon Apr 6 03:18:33 2015 UTC,"Any supposition of sincerity should be tossed with these last updates. They are structured to be as misleading as possible while still technically not claiming to be doing something they are not.

Not only would this require approx 3600 movable mechanical parts, with both actuators and pressure sensors, but even it this was done, it just doesn't replace the tools it is supposed to.  It's no replacement to a good midi interface since you can't make a slider or a rotatable knob by just lifting squares.  It's no replacement to a gamepad, since a flat surface will never be as comfortable as pad that fits nicely in your hand. Also, even if the keys would be pressure sensitive, it's not the same as having a trigger with a long travel distance - you have much more control over applying pressure to something that actually travels for a centimetre or two, than a flat key that lifts only a couple of mm  I just hope that the power of fixed funding will leave them with nothing."

EDIT: Fuck it, I made a support ticket in regards to this project. This is more outlandish than the Ritot, but it's fixed funding like all tech projects should be. If you want to look at it, it's there. The ticket I made, not the project.   The people behind the icarus Machina (https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/icarus-machina-laptop-with-a-liftable-touchscreen#home) are trying to scam people out of their money - selling their ""laptop"" at a severe loss (Selling it for $500 EB, when it retails well over $1500), offering discounts double the perk's cost ($200 off the laptop, when you initially pay $100, shit like that), and trying to get a product developed as it gets funded, not developed, then funded. They have no prototypes if their idea is even remotely possible, they have no builds of what they want it to look like (3D printing isn't THAT expensive guys), they provide no hardware specs. beyond the keyboard (It's a laptop. TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT TO POWER IT.), and they provide no dimensions for the machine to provide people a rough estimate of what they want it to realistically be sized at.  Also, bezel-less key-sized touchscreens? Nobody has that. No big company has that. These people don't have that. We're close to bezel-less, but we aren't actually at bezel-less.

shittykickstarters,31grg0,thenickdude,6,Sun Apr 5 16:45:10 2015 UTC,this guy is a turd. The only risk and challenge is that he will blow all investors cash and none of his own. The real reason tourist shows dont go beyond the the major spots is simply because the rest of the country is boring and shitty. Every country on the planet works like this - 10% interesting and good 90% complete boring shit hole. Hit up the japanese government if you want to sponsor a tourist show
shittykickstarters,31grg0,jcpb,10,Sun Apr 5 17:14:04 2015 UTC,"To be fair, that's actually not true of Japan at all! Something like the Dosojin Fire Festival, or Department H in Tokyo, or Onbashira, or the Park of Reversible Destiny, or the giant cult space pyramid in the middle of Tokyo that would be a main landmark in any other city but that most Tokyo visitors never even stop by, or the mysterious and beautiful HikyÅ stations, is unlikely to make it on your standard Japan travel show but would be fascinating to see someone delve into. I actually found this guy's kickstarter because I track all new kickstarters dealing with Japan and Tokyo to see if people are getting into the good stuff, Tokyo is a second home for me and it's got nearly infinite wonders. (FWIW I'm not a weeaboo or anything, just someone who spends a lot of their life traveling and speaks Japanese so can research/navigate the more hidden stuff. Tokyo and Istanbul are my two choices for cities everyone needs to spend a week in before they die.)  This guy is just deluded as all fuck that he and this kickstarter are the people to do that, though.  La Carmina's dispatches from Japan are actually pretty good for digging up the fun stuff you don't see every day, at least the kaleidoscopic culturefuck side of it."
shittykickstarters,31grg0,thenickdude,6,Sun Apr 5 09:24:34 2015 UTC,"The first bit of your post applies to most countries - anyone who thinks any place on Earth is ""90% boring shithole"" hasn't traveled a lot, or at least hasn't made the effort to really check things out."

shittykickstarters,31h6q3,CoruscantSunset,8,Sun Apr 5 02:32:55 2015 UTC,"Is he actually asking where to find animal-free sand? Home Depot. I mean, where does he think that playgrounds get sand for sandboxes? Where does he think the sand for mixing into cement comes from?  And since he's concerned about animals at all, I guess his idea is to go to some beach and just take sand for free. If so, where is this figure of $500k coming from?! If he's thinking about just collecting the main component for free, what are we paying half a million dollars for?"
shittykickstarters,31h6q3,450k_crackparty,2,Sun Apr 5 23:09:20 2015 UTC,At first I thought this was done by a child or teen.  But dude is 31 years old.  How can you make it to that age and never have gone to a hardware store....
shittykickstarters,31h6q3,SuitableDragonfly,8,Mon Apr 6 20:12:15 2015 UTC,"Why does he think that sand has a ""cooling effect""?  Sand on a beach during the day is usually hot, unless it's wet."
shittykickstarters,31h6q3,paincoats,7,Sun Apr 5 06:40:23 2015 UTC,"He's not wrong in that respect. Sand is a great insulator. The top layer of sand at the beach is hot because the sun bears down on it directly. But once you dig your feet in an inch or two, the sand is quite cool."

shittykickstarters,317jec,Mongfight,55,Thu Apr 2 18:52:39 2015 UTC,"The funny thing is, his campaign is for $27.5k, because he added ten percent for fees. Since his math is wrong, he will end up with $24,750.   Luckily, that was the only small area in which he didn't fully consider this campaign, and therefore all other aspects are totally reasonable and extremely well thought-out. Seriously, though, people need to quit polluting Kickstarter and its shitty little brother IndieGoGo with campaigns that have no tangible benefit, or product, as their endgame. As if it wasn't bad enough that people occasionally fail to deliver, we have dickparades like this guy (nice beard dude, what are you, fifteen?) cluttering the site with nonsense. It devalues the entire enterprise and makes it more difficult for awesome products to get funded.  On another note, Pillars of Eternity by Obsidian Games may actually be dope enough to cancel all that out, I haven't finished it yet so I am not totally certain.

shittykickstarters,311q19,shuster28,13,Wed Apr 1 18:26:08 2015 UTC,"I know, right? Holding tungsten is such a weird experience.  My brain doesn't accept that this tiny thing is that heavy.  It wants to think there's some trick, or something else going on."
shittykickstarters,311q19,squirrelpotpie,4,Wed Apr 1 19:36:39 2015 UTC,do you go for the .5 inch or 1 inch?
shittykickstarters,311q19,shuster28,5,Wed Apr 1 20:13:48 2015 UTC,"I want a 3-inch, but he only goes up to 1.5.  Probably a sphere at that weight, since that could be really damaging to a table or a foot.  (Would be what, 18 pounds?)"
shittykickstarters,311q19,squirrelpotpie,11,Wed Apr 1 21:16:24 2015 UTC,"yes volume goes up the third power with a cube dimensions. a 3"" cube would weigh a ridiculous 17.5 pounds. I would totally entertain making them but I can't hand wave away the insane cost of that much tungsten, and I wouldn't be getting volume discounts.  Rough estimate would be in the $800-1000 range, I would also have to chamfer the corners to prevent cracking or more importantly injuries when you drop it on your foot."
shittykickstarters,311q19,squirrelpotpie,3,Wed Apr 1 23:59:26 2015 UTC,"One of these days, I will have my unreasonably large ball of tungsten!  It may not be right now, but eventually it will be mine."
shittykickstarters,311q19,squirrelpotpie,6,Thu Apr 2 00:23:22 2015 UTC,Spheres are probably the most common shape for sintered tungsten products.  I mean I'll call and get a quote for you if you seriously want it.

shittykickstarters,311q19,squirrelpotpie,16,Wed Apr 1 23:24:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would revisit the ""risks and challenges"" section if you are still able to edit it. Whenever someone just handwaves away any challenges they might face, it doesn't instill as much confidence in the completion and delivery of the rewards as it would of the person is conscious of risks, willing to prepare for eventualities, and especially willing to be honest with the consumer about it.   Edit: typo"
shittykickstarters,311q19,dailyapple,4,Wed Apr 1 18:09:18 2015 UTC,"Seems pretty good to me, though it's been an hour so maybe he edited it in.    He identifies two risks (vendors not delivering, vendors delivering below expectations) and pairs each with his steps to mitigate, short & sweet in two sentences.  Maybe could address the steps he's taken to make sure he has personnel and resources to ship all the orders he's getting, in reasonable time?"
shittykickstarters,311q19,dailyapple,5,Wed Apr 1 19:42:55 2015 UTC,"Looking back, it's not that bad, I just have a problem when people use that box as another section to sing the praises of the project and talk about how nothing could possible go wrong.   It is good that he mentioned two possible problems that he already solved, but I have a hard time believing he can't think of anything else that could go wrong with a project of this size.   The main issue is that all of the poorly planned or straight up scam projects we see on this subreddit already almost always have a ""risks and challenges"" section that isn't honestly filled out or shows some sort of bad judgment/naivetÃ© by only including positives or not including much at all."
shittykickstarters,311q19,expugnator3000,3,Wed Apr 1 20:14:41 2015 UTC,"Agree, the scam projects and just outright incompetence on kickstarter is a big problem.  Unchecked, could be a real issue for the continued success of crowdsourcing funding.  What else might he include?  I'll toss in storage and shipping.  I do hear of projects that get too many backers and have trouble taking care of all the shipping and handling in a timely fashion.  People who assume their apartment will be enough space, but no they get 350,000 orders and need to purchase additional space as an unexpected expense, and were barely selling at cost so that becomes a huge problem."
shittykickstarters,311q19,squirrelpotpie,3,Wed Apr 1 21:20:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure exactly how he plans to acquire them or have them machined (as well as what type of deal he has set up), so I couldn't give any suggestions there. One thing that comes to mind is shipping. I may have just missed the place he addresses it in the kickstarter, but I'd have to agree with you and wonder about shipping specifically. When receiving and shipping large quantities of a material known for its incredible density, costs can get pretty high. I'd wonder if the relatively low costs have enough extra in there to pay for that as well as the raw material, machining, overhead, and hopefully some profit."
shittykickstarters,311q19,neogenic,6,Wed Apr 1 21:52:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the postings. It's hard to come up with risks and challenges as that's essentially asking ""what's your biggest flaw"", and most individuals are hopelessly optimistic  Shipping is probably the biggest challenge, not so much from a damage or difficulty issue but from cost as you mentioned.  The vendor stream for each metal is a little different but goes like this   procure Bar stock or rough finished cubes in given size cut bar stock to cube blanks Machine cube blanks to precise size Surface finish operations (polish, buff, sand blast, anodize, etc) Pack and ship to customer.   I wish there was some way to vette or accredit project creators. I have a degree in welding engineering, work as a manufacturing engineer and I'm very familiar with manufacturing and fabricating metal parts which I do as a hobby (see my other Kickstarter, which is live too). I also do a lot of cost estimating and design for manufacturing so I'm versed in accurate cost estimation, I have accounted for all cost sources (and escalation) that I thought were reasonable. I account for shipping to-and from subvendors and am lucky to live in Los Angeles where all the subvendors I need are within driving distance and I have working relationships with. I spent days tweaking numbers up and down so I didn't gouge but I'm not worried about losing money on each pledge. I'll be honest some cubes are basically being pledged at cost, and might come out slightly negative. I won't be getting wildly rich off this, I really just wanted a set of my own at a cost I could afford.  Final shipping is always the biggest unknown, I take worst case for domestic (baked into pledge amount) and a baseline for international which probably means I'll come out ahead on some countries and way behind on some remote ones. Weight is the not so ironic cost driver here, not size.  Unfortunately KS doesn't have any way to dynamically alter shipping costs and it becomes very complex and convoluted to try to break out costs for multiple regions.  I always offer a reasonable rate to Canada to support our friendly neighbors to the north."

shittykickstarters,311q19,stupadbear,2,Thu Apr 2 13:55:31 2015 UTC,"The more concise answer is that I built in 3 shipping costs. Vendor to me, me to sub-vendor, me to you. I took worst case bulk rates and escalate or apply, essentially I assume it costs the same to ship tungsten (heavy) as aluminum (light).    I don't know how popular this will get, I'm confident I can move 100-3K units in a timely manner."

We have read some comments around on some internet sites about the ""black projection"" and many other things. Although we tried to answer and explain about our sample clock faces and the CC system itself more in time, step by step and sometimes also in detail, NOW, before the campaign ends, we would like to share a few comments here, too, as some of them are related with today`s update:   Our projection, the system will not project directly the black color, HOWEVER, there are some ""solutions"" and alternatives for almost anything to achieve about ""the light"" and we may benefit some of the already presented ""tactics"" or alternatives..  for example, here`s one from 2011: http://youtu.be/4bMMWEK4VhY   So many quotation marks. So little sense."
shittykickstarters,30x06j,exclamationmarek,18,Tue Mar 31 15:37:31 2015 UTC,"The video makes sense, but it certainly creates its own problems. If you need to put something on the wall in order to remotely recreate what's shown in that Japanese video, and it hasn't been commercialized yet, well, then what? Their original $20k was supposed to pay for the development and production of that as well? Insanity."
shittykickstarters,30x06j,wochnerd,26,Tue Mar 31 16:07:58 2015 UTC,"I reckon they simply have no idea what they are doing, and they found this video by just googling random stuff.   Their original concept was probably to make ""something like Ritot but a wall clock instead of a wrist watch"". This idea is so pointless it hurts."
shittykickstarters,30x06j,exclamationmarek,8,Tue Mar 31 16:17:36 2015 UTC,"And what always drives me crazy is how absurdly low the total raise is. If you need to have a custom mold for a new piece of plastic, that's going to cost in the range of $50k right off the top, and that's before you make any parts or pay anyone for ANYTHING else."
shittykickstarters,30x06j,wochnerd,4,Tue Mar 31 16:27:45 2015 UTC,That very much depends on the plastics and moulding processes being used. Moulds can cost anywhere from hundreds to hundreds of thousands depending on precesses (and life expectancy of the mould).
shittykickstarters,30x06j,KissMyGoat,3,Tue Mar 31 16:52:05 2015 UTC,"Wow, I'm surprised to hear that. Can you point me to any references or information on some cheaper molds for plastics? My company is looking at some, and they were all coming in the $50k range no matter what we did."
shittykickstarters,30x06j,wochnerd,7,Tue Mar 31 16:59:35 2015 UTC,"I am assuming you are looking at very large scale production with decent life expectancy for you moulds for that price?  Injection, blow or roto moulding? You can knock out a composite based mould that is good for maybe a couple of hundred moulding really damn cheaply (ideal for prototyping and short run). Rotomoulding moulds can be considerably cheaper too as they can be far simpler than injection or blow moulding moulds (far more similar to wet lay or vac bag composite moulds) but obviously the process is slower and more convoluted and you need a rotomould oven.  Any plastics company worth their salt should be able to advise you on your companies needs though, just be sure you are not just being sold their preferred (or only) process rather than what is suitable for your needs."

The in-game footage probably is alright, but you talking into a shitty microphone with a distracting T-shirt sitting in a chair with a cluttered background just shouts 'amateur'. I understand that you don't ask that much and probably are single developer, but when half of the video, something that's just about the single thing we can gauge quality on, is shittily done, it doesn't give much of a good impression on the game. Also, not directly relevant to the shittiness of the kickstarter-page itself: You also seem to be relying solely on the Kickstarter page to get your funding: entering 'elkabo' in Google only nets that. How do you expect people to find and pledge your game if they can't find it? Also also: if I want a rogue-like, why would I fund your game if I can also for example fund this  and have something looking way more awesome?"

If you have a pixel artist and a musician lined up, show off some of their previous work.  Honestly, the graphics are fine and the gameplay looks okay. You need something that makes your game different.  $600 is nothing for game development. That dollar amount promises that the final game will be exactly what is shown.

shittykickstarters,30iffe,md678685,3,Sat Mar 28 15:43:29 2015 UTC,It would be a good idea if it wasn't an entire phone and just a charger that is always connected to the phone.
shittykickstarters,30iffe,Liefjin,16,Sat Mar 28 05:40:41 2015 UTC,"No, it wouldn't.  Maximum transmit power for a Wi-Fi access point is (to a first approximation) one watt. So if you have a magical power-absorber from frictionless resistanceless Physics Experiment Land and put it around the access point (which similarly manages to get the whole watt of energy into the air...) and absorb absolutely all of the power it has to offer, you'll get one watt of charge power. (You get 2.5 watts from a basic USB charge cable, and five watts from an unremarkable iPhone wall charger.)  In sucking up your miserable one watt (real-world maximum, with excellent engineering, probably only half a watt actually getting into the phone battery...), you will have rendered the access point useless as an access point. You're sucking up everything it transmits, so the rest of the world can't see it any more.  If you don't envelop the access point in a Faraday-cage of an antenna, but instead have something like the one-square-foot antenna shown in the Kickstarter pictures, then putting the antenna right next to the access point (and thereby making the access point inaccessible for anything in the ""shade"" of the antenna), you could maybe harvest 30% of the access-point's output, a third of a watt. That's presuming it even decides to output at full power, which it seldom actually does.  (Note that the radiation pattern of Wi-Fi antennas is often decidedly non-isotropic, so you might get 30% of the signal with the antenna right next to the access point but only 10% with it directly above the transmit antenna.)  Moving the antenna further away makes you subject to the inverse-square law, with signal intensity proportional to the square of the distance. Once you're only a couple of metres away from the access point, you'll be getting maybe 0.5% as much power as you had when you were next to it. If you're lucky.  Over most of the coverage of a wireless access point, this antenna will not even be able to provide a microwatt of power."

Right handed scissors have the top blade on the right side because right handed people hold the workpiece with their left hand, while the scissors is to the right of their head and have the waste piece fall off to the right.  This allows more precision for creating the edge of the workpiece because the user can see exactly where the top blade is cutting.  If you use a right handed scissisors in your left hand, you can't exactly see where you are cutting because the top blade is blocking the view.  Hence, left handed scissors have the top blade on the left side.  It is the same with a lot of cutting tools, even power tools like circular saws (though, in the case of a circular saw, it is the offset motor that obstructs the view)."

That's why I was kind of seething at it.  Yeah, I screwed up too, have a lot more debt than Gary (although it's medical bills and student loans, not CC debt) and I just made my last payment to my bankruptcy attorney, which isn't even going to alleviate the student loan situation at all.  I also don't make $56k in a year.  I too made bad decision after bad decision in spite of being well-intentioned and now I basically have to purposely fuck myself over in order to possibly save myself from financial ruin.  And what in the hell was he buying on credit that added up to that insane amount?  Was he living off the cards, or what?

Yeah, but tealights generally have small flames, so they top out at thirty-something watts each.  (You can get an upper bound for the heat output of any paraffin-wax candle by multiplying 42 kJ by its weight in grams, then dividing by its burn time. Real-world candles are not 100% efficient, of course, or 100% made of paraffin wax, and even commercial ""paraffin wax"" is not actually 100% paraffin wax because it's mixed with stearic acid to stop the candle totally melting from it's own heat... everything is complicated!)  Sticking a flowerpot or whatever over them so the heat is radiated from something next to you instead of convecting straight up to the ceiling is perfectly valid; in the olden days it was completely normal to heat only the place where you are, not the whole room. But you'd need more like ten tealights to get the 300W power output they claim, and even that isn't going to achieve any more than you'd expect from the wattage.  Add more and more candles to get the output of a ""real"" heater, and sooner or later you, or your next of kin, will learn why unflued combustion heaters are undesirable. :-)"

shittykickstarters,307w7c,JoTheKhan,2,Wed Mar 25 19:50:29 2015 UTC,"Because 3D requires heavy Linear Algebra and the like. Game physics requires Calculus and the like. Making Objects move and texture appear is heavy with math. But drawing the actual images requires some one who knows how to draw.  3D rendering requires a lot of math and a lot of art skills. Computer Science departs usually offer a Graphics class, but that doesn't mean afterwards you're gonna be making beautiful landscapes lol."

I was saying that you need to have a pretty solid understanding of some of the concepts behind how 3D rendering works if you're going to create and animate 3D models; it's a lot more involved than just sculpting the 3D shape itself. For example, you have to understand the concept of per-vertex attributes like UVs and bone weights and what they represent. In other words, the art side is NOT disconnected from the technical side."

They said    Having a full and complete understand of programming has made this project one of the fun ones to make. Our staff is a bit week in the art department [â¦]   so I took it to mean they were entirely confident in their programming & enjoyed doing the bits they've been able to, but now they've reached their creative limits and feel that bringing somebody else on board for that part might just perhaps be sensible in a project conceived as a 'visual novel'.  Which leaves them with just one tiny detail: they don't get their money until after the campaign ends, so they plan to find and hire an artist who will complete the assignment by the end of May, two months from now? If it's that easy, they should do it themselves."

This is supposed to be an efficient agricultural light for growing plants at night (a ""from light""), not just a lamp.  If you look at the output spectrum of a High Pressure Sodium lamp that is commonly used for this task and compare it to this plot of photosynthesis rate vs wavelength of available light you will notice that they don't really line up. A significant portion of that peak power at 590nm is wasted, yet the plants most efficient wavelengths of 450 and 680nm are not supplied.  So, there is room for improvement in growth light. But with that said, I highly doubt that the makers of this kickstarter campaign actually have something properly engineered to offer. This would require making a custom LED chip, with a custom semiconductor junction perfectly fine-tuned to match up with these wavelengths. Not something you can do in a shed."

Agreed, that there's room for improvement in grow lights, but there's only a handful of 70W LEDs out there, and they're all built for lighting warehouses and parking lots, not grow lamps.   TL;DR - totally agree, this guy's not doing it, but it's possible, and should cost at least an order of magnitude less than this."

It's a bullshit product, by a bullshit company who uses bullshit marketing words like 'Poles of Articulation'. Also they have the the Indegogo excrement on their website. They couldn't just take pre orders? Their factory is in California and have been manufacturing for a while now, after all. Not like the Artistry coffe maker where they have to find a manufacture in China, and a sales channel in the US. Also considering they have $1337 in perked donations from 91 people. That leaves $11,698 in limbo. I suppose on average 890 people gave $14 to a well off company and have asked for nothing in return. I mean, it has been only a few hours since the Indegogo started and they already have 130% more funding than needed(pump and dump, baby!).  This is not what kickstarters are supposed to be.

shittykickstarters,304c47,arcesilaus,3,Tue Mar 24 22:29:48 2015 UTC,"Be careful with that. From the Terms of Use:   You can increase, decrease, or cancel your pledge at any time during the campaign, with one exception. During the last 24 hours of the campaign, you canât decrease or cancel your pledge without contacting customer support first â if that action would drop the project below its funding goal. Once the project has been funded, you can only cancel or change your pledge by making special arrangements directly with the creator.   If TargetFreeEnergy campaign is asking for $1 million, and they get $999,996 of your money and then in the last 2 hours of the campaign somebody pledges the remaining $4 to fully fund the campaign, then you're on the hook for the $999,996, since canceling it would drop them back below fully-funded. In other words, you can't string them along until the very last minute, since the instant you pledge $999,996, any creator worth their salt will immediately pledge the $4 in the hope of locking yours in.  Tl;dr Kickstarter has a fairly jaded view of humanity & will slap you down if you succumb to that beguiling temptation."

I assume he's dramatically misunderstood the very wikipedia articles he points us toward or he wouldn't have caught the free energy bug, but it's refreshing to see somebody understand that the burden is on him to explain and justify his project, and who thinks his backers are merely uninformed rather than brain-dead.

The photons generated in the core of a star reach its periphery without energy losses because of the tunneling effect .   Photons exit the cores of stars through Brownian motion: exciting electrons to higher energies, being re-emitted, and subsequently re-absorbed until they finally reach the star's edge. That process has absolutely nothing to do with tunneling, tunneling involves potential barriers that are classically impossible for charged particles to overcome, but can due to their quantum nature. Photons aren't charged, they don't give a shit about electric potential barriers."

How, you might ask? Get rid of all the digits after the decimal! In my new mathematical paradigm, you will be able to define your base as the irrational number in question. What is pi? Let's just count: 0, 1, 2, 3, pi! What is e? Let's count again: 0, 1, 2, e!  It works for all irrational and rational numbers. You don't even need a supercomputer to calculate the value of pi!

Our idea is to build a machine to create a special beam with a much smaller scale compared to sun surface to ignite Northern light and be able to shape it into characters.    We haven't done R&D yet:   Funds will be all spent on R&D for scientist to start this their experiment and research.   We can bribe governments into allowing this. Especially Finland:   Challenge 2: We may not be allowed to shot the beam into the space. But who knows? It will make our machine a huge treasury and attraction.

If I'm not mistaken, Kickstarter has a rule where the projects must have a prototype that isn't a drawing or render. Granted, a rule that they barely ever enforce.  The biggest reasons, though, are indiegogo's Flexible Funding and Endless Funding options. If a project has these enabled, the project creator will receive all the pledged money even if the project doesn't reach its goal (This allows for high revenue scams) and, in the case of endless funding, the project will be able to receive new pledges after funding period expires (allows scammers to constantly receive money so long as they keep posting fake ""it's coming soon, almost done"" updates)."

The camera development process has been taking more time and resources than we previously planned. The number of product iterations we have had to perform negatively impacted our cash balance. Currently our per-unit cost is set at $90/unit, leaving us narrow margin to fund outsourced development resources, test runs, tooling and other overhead costs, finally bringing us to the point where we are in need to seek additional investor funding to compete manufacturing and bring product to market - and to you.  To that end, we have been pitching investors for some time now. We were finally successful in securing interest from two manufacturing partners, both offering to fund the full remaining cost of production and shipment for a stake in the company. We have been meeting and discussing the details with both parties over the past week however as of this morning, we do not have a signed deal yet.  We must be open and also consider the risk that we will not close such manufacturing investment. In such case we will continue to work to secure alternative funding but delivery timelines will become unclear and the project, at risk.  Since some of these investor conversations are being led under nondisclosure agreements (NDA), we were limited in our ability to keep you informed. However, as of this morning, we feel it is our obligation to you to be as transparent as we can. As part of that, we plan to hold an online chat conversation with backers next week, allowing you to make suggestions and ask us questions directly. We will publish two time slots to allow for backers from both sides of the GMT timeline to join in and participate.  Pushing forward hard, we continue to work to secure the required funding and close with one of the two prospects interested. Hope to get back to you next week with good news and a firm delivery schedule.  Rom & The CA7CH Team"

shittykickstarters,2zpzi0,Puppier,9,Sat Mar 21 07:49:27 2015 UTC,"Comments from the latest backer only update (I'm one of the unfortunate ones...)  Apols in reverse order, but you get the general idea...   I totally understand what Darren is saying, if we publicly shame them then we will get nothing. But it is really difficult to not be so angry at the way that they have and are still conducting themselves. People are probably still giving these people money via their site for a product that they have no idea is at risk. Potential pre-orderers(?) are not privy to these updates and I for one do not feel comfortable watching this happen, and yes I'm well aware that the more people who give money to them, the more likely we will have a product in our hands, but it still doesn't feel right to me.  Right, my rants over, I'm going to mow the lawn.  J - Don't worry, I completely understand :)  They literally updated their site for pre-orders today to now state delivery in Summer. Darren, would you say that is honest?  Darren, not trying to have a go at you, just so angry about what was clearly bull and incompetence, seeing this coming and still reading people defending them. I have no problem taking a risk, which is why I came to kickstarter, but not deceitful stories about how close to production blah blah blah, only to hear nearly a year later that they;re actually further away now, after a year, than they were and spent 3 times what they said they would need. Incompetence at best, F word at worst.  J - design of hardware, packaging and software is irrelevant, I don't see dishonesty here. The 25 days being ""tight"" was probably not the correct terminology.  Hey guys... I'm upset as much as the next guy here, but checking their skin thickness by jumping their ass on what was said in the past want help in getting this project finished and in our hands. If we can help them decide on an investor through suggestion, pushing the subject of moral ethics of doing business and keeping their promise of finishing this project should be the goal of the conversation. Right? >Being mad is not going to be constructive!  What do we need to say, or do.. to help them make an investor get on board and soon.  They obviously know that another project will be very difficult to have backed in the future if this falls apart and doesn't get completed.. and allot of irritated backers of a great project upset. In saying this, what can we say to persuade a fast merger of this project with an investor to complete it? My opinion!  Jhaeh - I agree they need to remove the option to pre-order from their website TODAY!  J - dishonesty requires intention, last year everything might have been going great and their update was, at that time, truthful, we just don't know. How they spent the money is not clear to us either, maybe they wasted it, maybe they just underestimated what was needed. Again we don't know. We don't know how much money they budgeted for contingencies. What I am saying is that, at this stage, it seems there are a lot of people just looking for blood. As I said in my original post, if you don't want to take risks, wait until the products hit the shelves and then buy them, don't use Kickstarter and moan when the project fails. Just to note, I too have potentially lost $134 (including shipping), I am not exactly thrilled, but it was the risk I took when I backed the project.  Darren, Was this update on Jan 5 honest? ""We are mostly done with the hardware now. We're making a couple of small improvements to make the Lightbox user button work better and mechanical parts will be done too.  In parallel, we are developing in linux on the camera, integrating native iOS and Android on the mobile app and tying it all up with our cloud service, hosted on the Amazon cloud. Oh, packaging is mostly done too but we still have not released for tooling manufacturing - last minute thoughts on design and we should be good to go. We are outsourcing logistics and there are a million other small things we are working on to make sure we deliver you with an amazing experience. Right now 25 days feels tight and we may very well find that pushing delivery dates is unavoidable. We know, you hate it! You want your reward delivered and on time. We can only be grateful you backed us in building a great product and plan to reward your patience with us by making you proud to have been a backer - if only for one reason then we want it to be because it was done right and you really love your Lightbox."" ""we are mostly done with hardware now""  ""packaging is mostly done too""  ""plan to reward your patience with us by making you proud to have been a backer"" grrrr  I understand that the money I used to back this Kickstarter is as good as gone, but what about the battery pack I ordered via your website? How do I get a refund for that?  Darren, would you call this statement from last June honest then? ""It is important to note that although we have built flexibility into our schedule, there may be unforeseen delays. However, we are very confident that even with unforeseen delays, we will be shipping the product this winter at the latest."" Do you feel that they indeed built flexibility into their schedule to deliver last winter? Do you feel they have adequately dealt with unforeseen delays? Sorry, they spouted bull, pissed away the money and deserve the scrutiny they are now getting. Having said that, let's hope that they are open and honest now (they have not been to date) and actually listen to their backers (they have not to date). I hope we see a bit of respect from ca7ch over the web chat instead of the complete lack of respect that they have shown their backers to date.  I hope the person responsible for the webchat has thick skin. >Assuming it actually happens that is. You've lied and/or misled us so many times before, promises of accountability and transparency from you are taken with a large pinch of salt. Also, why are you still taking pre-orders on your site?! That's blatant theft!  I want a refund, how's that for looking for additional funding....... >Another failed promise kickstarter is becoming a scam  (1) this is Kickstarter, you can't back a project and expect your money back if it fails, that is the risk you take when you back a start-up company. If you want to buy a fully developed product with a full warranty and no risk, go to Amazon, don't use Kickstarter; (2) the questions we should be asking is: ""what went wrong, was this down to an error in original figures or a fundamental problem along the way, could this have been avoided?"" and ""How can we help get the product launched?""; (3) Making accusations about not having a working prototype is just madness, we all saw the video and pictures and these guys have been giving updates (unlike some of the other projects I have backed), let's be sensible. If there is ever evidence of dishonesty, I will be the first to send abuse!  Wow, looks like we all got scammed. I knew something was fishy about this, can't believe I'm out $119.  So how can I get my money back. I'm sure a lot of others feel the same way.  I'm not going to get my camera, OR get my money back, am I? >:(  Given all the delays and iterations you've had to do after the campaign, I'm starting to wonder:  Did you guys even HAVE a working prototype when you ran your campaign, or did you just use video editing to make it look like you did? If that's what you did, that's very dishonest. You had better start making every effort to reassure me because your credibility is rapidly evaporating.  So when you said this, nearly a year ago, it was complete bull: ""When Will I Get Mine?  Currently, we are negotiating with our manufacturing partners and are in the final stages of that process. That leaves us with a 90-day cycle time and our anticipated inventory shelf date for the U.S. is October, at which time we plan to start shipping cameras to our backers. It is important to note that although we have built flexibility into our schedule, there may be unforeseen delays. However, we are very confident that even with unforeseen delays, we will be shipping the product this winter at the latest.""  ""However, as of this morning, we feel it is our obligation to you to be as transparent as we can."" What a shame that you only now see this as your obligation.  Oh the hell do you raise triple your target and then run out of money?"

shittykickstarters,2zpzi0,beefcheese,3,Sat Mar 21 04:53:49 2015 UTC,I don't understand how this is a scam... the product looks doable and it's entirely possible that they just ran out of money.

Now if in a year nothing has happened, then yeah maybe.   Also, it's kickstarter not Amazon. You are backing a project that can fail, not buying an item.   If you didn't want the risk, then you should have waited or made the item yourself."

Hair gets everywhere! The worst is when you're sleeping and you turn over a few times and then are woken up because your hair is wrapped around your throat like a hot, annoying scarf.  That said, these issues aren't particularly annoying and certainly not bothersome enough that they need a piece of clothing designed to solve the problem.   Obviously it's annoying to this lady, though, because she said that she's even been on messageboards looking for a solution!  One way to help with this - for anyone who might be reading this who has this problem - is to brush your hair really well immediately before you get in the shower and gather up all your hair and then run your hands down your hair, pulling on it hard enough to dislodge the hairs that aren't really rooted in anymore."

All the app has to do is ask the user to move the phone away from the food quickly enough for the effect to shift the wavelength of the thermal radiation towards the range detected by the camera! Then you just use the accelerometer to sync the camera with the movement and done!  Math time! A steck at 80Â°C emits via blackbody radiation a spectrum that peaks at 8.2Âµm. The red subpixel filter in the CCD peaks at 650nm but effectively permits as far as 800nm or 0.8Âµm. That is a 10 times lower frequency, or a red shift of 0.9. So how fast do we need to go? Let's just ask our good friend Wolfram Alpha and we get 169,731 kilometers per second.  So there we go, all you have to do is move your phone at 3.6 million times the speed of the fastest baseball pitch ever. Measuring the temperature of your steak was never this easy!

shittykickstarters,2zhxxj,autowikibot,3,Sat Mar 21 14:52:31 2015 UTC,"Redshift:       In physics, redshift happens when light or other electromagnetic radiation from an object is increased in wavelength, or shifted to the red end of the spectrum. In general, whether or not the radiation is within the visible spectrum, ""redder"" means an increase in wavelength â equivalent to a lower frequency and a lower photon energy, in accordance with, respectively, the wave and quantum theories of light.  Some redshifts are an example of the Doppler effect, familiar in the change in the apparent pitches of sirens and frequency of the sound waves emitted by speeding vehicles. A redshift occurs whenever a light source moves away from an observer. Another kind of redshift is cosmological redshift, which is due to the expansion of the universe, and sufficiently distant light sources (generally more than a few million light years away) show redshift corresponding to the rate of increase in their distance from Earth. Finally, gravitational redshift is a relativistic effect observed in electromagnetic radiation moving out of gravitational fields. Conversely, a decrease in wavelength is called blueshift and is generally seen when a light-emitting object moves toward an observer or when electromagnetic radiation moves into a gravitational field. However, redshift is a more common term and sometimes blueshift is referred to as negative redshift.  Knowledge of redshifts and blueshifts has been applied to develop several terrestrial technologies such as Doppler radar and radar guns.  Redshifts are also seen in the spectroscopic observations of astronomical objects.  Its value is represented by the letter z.  A special relativistic redshift formula (and its classical approximation) can be used to calculate the redshift of a nearby object when spacetime is flat. However, in many contexts, such as black holes and Big Bang cosmology, redshifts must be calculated using general relativity.  Special relativistic, gravitational, and cosmological redshifts can be understood under the umbrella of frame transformation laws. There exist other physical processes that can lead to a shift in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, including scattering and optical effects; however, the resulting changes are distinguishable from true redshift and are not generally referred to as such (see section on physical optics and radiative transfer).

The MSRP for a Retron5 is $159, that will play a number of different system carts, but to play ROMs you have to hack it and recompile all of your ROMs.  That is a hassle that a lot of people do not want to go through, and by going that route they are only saving $20.    You could go the flash cart route, but then you are spending $75-$190 per system cart, on top of the price of the system (be it a Retron5, other clone, or original system).  That is only going to get you one system per flash cart.  You can see how that starts to add up.  Another option would be to build your own, which would be cheaper, but many might find to be a hassle.  Anything you are willing to make yourself is almost always going to be cheaper than a preassembled item.  It's just a matter of weighing the hassle saved against the money lost.

I wouldn't buy it, but considering the convenience of not having to hack your Retron5 and recompile your ROMs, or not having to spend $75-$190 for a flash cart for each system; His numbers do not seem that out there."

shittykickstarters,2zdzmf,foreverska,1 point,Wed Mar 18 21:30:38 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. But given that a backer can't make more than one pledge, he'll need a minimum of two further backers (one at $9 and one at $1) to bring his total to $90, meaning he'll need to convince at a minimum 10 people to donate instead of (potentially) only 9, and that's the best case scenario.  Maybe he's not confident of getting more than 8 backers at the $10 level, but then it seems odd that he'd be confident of getting so many people at lower levels. Only 8 people like him a lot, but he's got a dollar's worth of charisma for everybody else? People can also donate without selecting perks, of course, but surely that increases rather than decreases the demand on his charisma.   Basically, it seemed to me as though he made his job unnecessarily difficult. I snarked, but what I actually suspect is a typo, and in that case he has my sincere sympathy."

If they rotated the whole thing, and they projected to your palm when it's twisted (so that the projection surface will be more or less parallel to the projector). That way, it's pretty straightforward to make a mechanical switch to activate the projection automatically. It would also shield the image from the sun."

The Cicret is claiming to be able to reduce the real estate of a tablet computer to the width of a pencil, make it flexible, and include a fucking HD projector somewhere in there too. Oh, and a day-long battery and a wireless phone.  People are so fucking gullible and utterly without discrete reasoning that it makes me very seriously consider a Kickstarter scam. If all it takes is some crafty lies, then why should these shitbags get all the dumb-money that seems to be raining from the sky?

shittykickstarters,2zatuu,Mongfight,5,Tue Mar 17 09:08:40 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just because I've seen how many concepts have turned to shit in the past 10 years but I don't find this surprising in the least. While I agree with you, I do think that if that prototype is actually real it still is a pretty cool design and I can see that developing into something really cool in the future. Obviously it is not nearly anything close to the concept video but think about all of the concepts we have seen lately. Video games, consoles, cars, technology, medicine, every concept is greater than the final product. Look at the Microsoft Kinect, it was so hyped to be the next revolution in gaming and it's pretty much viewed as a joke now, the video game Watch Dogs and how it showed amazing detail at the E3 press conference and then when it was released turned out to be shit. Much like all of these other projects and the new announcing of Microsoft Hololens, I'm sure it will probably be very similar to a lot of these other concepts. Sure, I hope the hololens delivers but the trailer is mainly fiction as of right now.   Honestly, I can't think of many concepts that ever delivered the way they worked in the first video. The only thing that comes to mind is the Oculus Rift, but even that has taken years to get to where it is now, and tons of support, and sponsors, etc. Now that I think of it, look at the Ouya, that thing received millions and millions of dollars for piece of shit android-TV stick that you can buy for $30 with 10x the power and speed. Kickstarter has become a place more for ideas and not creations. I hope people realize that most of the projects on that website are completely false, and that most won't exceed your expectations."

It was later discovered that this is not true.  They have no employees in the United States, and are operating from Ukraine.  Further, we could find no record of Ritot being incorporated as a business in either the United States or Ukraine as of the middle of September.  A âcompanyâ that is not real, can not open a bank account, make deposits or write checks.  This could explain why RITOT has had âlegal and banking issuesâ for three months.

Which in Ritot language basically mean they test an external pico projector anyone can buy and use to project on any surface. They conveniantly omit to show the external pico projector to give an impression their project is more advanced than it really is.  It's typical of Ritot , they don't outright lie but only indirectly admit the projection is external and have nothing to do with the bracelet which at this stage is only an empty shell (or by the look of it even photoshoped on the picture afterward).  The picture and wording is enough to confuse many backers especially those without deep knowledge of english. At the same time they don't actually mislead you so you can't accuse them of anything.

Without explaining us how they plan to put it into the tiny bracelet or resolve the angle problem of course...

Some of the problems were external, e.g. loss of a battery supplier. Some of them were design oversights, e.g. having to change the entire charging system and charger to make it waterproof.  However a huge number of their delays happened because, after figuring out tooling and materials and everything else for the actual band that the watch would be built around, they decided to change the material from stainless steel to titanium because it was cooler, even if it was more expensive:  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1655017763/cst-01-the-worlds-thinnest-watch/posts/672785  This was an incredibly bad idea. You have enough issues to solve without redoing a basic part of the watch that you already had figured out. Guess what: the material they wanted to use didn't work, and they had to change again, to the even more expensive nitinol.  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1655017763/cst-01-the-worlds-thinnest-watch/posts/789627  That was a year ago, and much of the time since then has been spent simply trying to get nitinol bands manufactured to a reasonable tolerance.

The CST team have failed to deliver on countless promises, and have failed to meet every milestone. Their initial timeline was to have these delivered by the end of 2013 ... then updated to summer of 2014 (which is still stated as their ""expected release date"" on their website, where they are STILL taking preorders for this non-existent product) ... and is now left unanswered, as the team do not correspond with their backers. Their lack of (promised) project updates are starting to lose trust amongst backers, with many crying ""scam"" and demanding ""refunds"".. Any project updates they do submit fail to provide any real answers as they are either very brief or cover aspects that were previously covered.  After 2 years of failed promises and extended delivery dates, you can imagine how relieved we, the backers, were to see their latest update ""We are shipping"" - but once again, they provided a very brief outline and failed to provide any real numbers of how many were being shipped, their expected timeframes on next shipments/etc. This update was posted on Feb 5th 2015, it's currently March 17th 2015 and not one backer has reported receiving their watch - this has lead people to believe that this update was just a way for them to save face and buy themselves some more time.  Who knows, I'm still hopeful that I might receive something, but I'm not holding my breath. This experience, with this particular project, has caused many backers (myself included) to lose all faith in Kickstarter (and crowdfunding in general) - many have vowed to never back another project again.

Here's the problem: http://rimbitforum.com/topic/1154-wallet-has-not-syncd/  In order to get any amount of rimbits, the wallet must perform an arcane activity they refer to as ""syncing to the network"" and in order to do this you need to connect to enough ""peers"".

shittykickstarters,2yz591,gerradp,32,Sat Mar 14 03:28:14 2015 UTC,"I thought it was only like 5%? That is the best fucking money laundering cost you can get, hands down, anywhere on the globe that I have ever heard of. When... a friend of mine needed to launder his herb money, he would pay between 15 and 25 cents on the dollar, depending on how clean he needed the money.  If you wanted to be able to use it for anything the government might look into, it'd usually be 20 cents/per for larger amounts. If all you wanted to do was clean it up a bit, then it would be cheaper. I don't think that Kickstarter IS a very good laundering method (I don't even understand how you could do it, unless you bought thousands of Vanilla Visa gift cards) but it is interesting to think about."

What we really need is a kickstarter platform where the project leader only gets 25% of the money once the funding is successful. The rest is being kept in a temporary account, and only the backers can release (using a majority vote) further funds, once the project leader has reached a milestone and proven that he has made progress.

Think for a moment about what impact the excavator has on the environment. Now, remove the tracks and push enough air to lift the body and engine of the excavator and tell me what environmental impacts are mitigated.  There will not be tread tracks through the underbrush. That, as near as I can tell, is the upside. There will be additional weight (the lift engines pretty much have to be separate from the excavator engine since they have very different load/speed profiles), probably additional fuel demands (bet hovercraft use jet fuel or at least gasoline) and the digging footprint has to be the same (cannot be much smaller for stability) or larger (the fans need air feeds and space to spin; the skirt needs some room to expand and if the hover can make it through an active oil field you need to consider the fan ground clearance in measuring the skirt).   Of course it is always possible that the idea is to have it excavate while hovering...Makes a hell of a picture in my mind, that."

You could put an excavator arm or dozer blade or whatever on a hovercraft, if the excavating hardware is of normal truck-transportable-excavator size and the hovercraft is really really big.  But this guy is probably envisaging a normal-sized excavator that just floats around in a magical antigravity way and moors itself to the very aether of the universe so it doesn't get hauled around without being able to move any dirt, or just tip over, if it tries to do any excavating while hovering."

I've seen this before with other Kickstarters (The Doom That Came to Atlantic City, for example), and some venture capital-funded companies; the guy in charge fails to understand the money he's just been handed isn't actually his, it's already been committed to something else, and just treats it like a salary."

shittykickstarters,2yn0v4,asimilator,13,Wed Mar 11 03:17:33 2015 UTC,"I mean, there's a big ""Early Access"" warning on the store page.   This Early Access game is not complete and may or may not change further. If you are not excited to play this game in its current state, then you should wait to see if the game progresses further in development   If you don't want to support the game at this current point, don't buy it? Isn't the point of Early Access so you can follow the game through development?  I have no desire to support it at this point, but if some people do (and want to say influence the art direction or something) I don't see why that's a bad thing."
shittykickstarters,2yn0v4,squirrelpotpie,29,Wed Mar 11 07:39:43 2015 UTC,"Early Access is supposed to be at least at a point where there's consumable content of some sort.  From the video, it looks like you can't even interact with your environment or the objects in it.  Just limp around.  The objection is there's hardly even anything to have early access to.  Effectively all you get is to look at the 3D model of the first few rooms and hallways of the first level.  Contrast with something like Dreaming Sarah or Space Engineers, where there's a mostly functioning gameplay mechanic and they're adding content to it.  You can't finish the game yet, but there's at least one or two things to do.  Early Access should be at least in alpha.  Looks like After Reset isn't even at alpha yet.  There literally is no product.  There are zero things to do.  This could be OK, I agree.  Some people enjoy seeing these early stages of development.  But not for $50.  Access to the game in its current state should be free.  The problem is there seem to be lots of developers who make a bunch of sales in Early Access and then just stop development.  The ""honor system"" of holding developers to their promise of completing these Early Access games is failing.  From what I've seen, I don't believe for a second that the people behind After Reset have the skill set to finish the project.  They don't look like they're actively scamming people, more like they just don't understand how to do things like create game assets on a time budget, make the world interactive, create a working menu, etc."
shittykickstarters,2yn0v4,TheNittles,8,Wed Mar 11 10:31:32 2015 UTC,"The objection is there's hardly even anything to have early access to.  Effectively all you get is to look at the 3D model of the first few rooms and hallways of the first level.   Is this not what Star Citizen was for a good long time? Not that I disagree with you, but people went nuts over SC back when you could just buy ships and look at them and it was pretty."
shittykickstarters,2yn0v4,squirrelpotpie,3,Wed Mar 11 15:05:49 2015 UTC,"There are absolutely examples of people who put something on early access that looked like a ripoff, but pulled their shit together and actually made something.  I just looked up Star Citizen and it actually looks pretty good.  I think this particular example went up way too early.  What's up now looks like the kind of work I would see handed in as a project for an intro class in game design.  I have in person seen more content that is represented in the OP video get handed in as a final project.    Sure, all projects were in this stage at some point.  A big part of my problem is that the people behind After Reset seem to think they have, at this point, actually made something that people should want to buy.  To me that communicates a complete disconnect from reality.  The kind of thing you see from a student handing in a lump of shit, but because they put in all that work and made that lump of shit, they think it's amazing.  Actual professionals either grow out of that or fail, the latter being more common these days.  The usual chant is ""Buyer Beware"", but IMO there should be at least some base minimum standard.  They've created some models and textures and one animation, and assembled them in an editor.  They've accomplished the ""Hello World"" app of game design, and are already trying to sell it.  That's what makes me think this will fail."

shittykickstarters,2yn0v4,bbruinenberg,-1,Wed Mar 11 10:24:23 2015 UTC,"Because you clearly lack common sense, let me just shout at you.  NOT AN EXCUSE! NOT AN EXCUSE! $50!  Seriously, the moment a developer starts charging for a game it should no longer be treated as an early access game by ANYONE. There is literally no reason to allow the developer to use it as an excuse at that point.  Also, these days full release is as meaningless as the word innovative. Or do I have to remind you of broken pieces of shit like ac:u and even games like airport simulator and day one: garry's incident, neither of which are in early access."
shittykickstarters,2yn0v4,asimilator,0,Thu Mar 12 17:33:11 2015 UTC,It sounds like you just don't like early access. Like the concept.   So don't buy early access games?
shittykickstarters,2yn0v4,bbruinenberg,2,Thu Mar 12 20:21:07 2015 UTC,"No, it's people who use early access as an excuse that I don't like. I don't care if you use it as an excuse for problems or to blame, both are bad. Early access should only be used to warn about potential bugs, rebalances, etc. It should not be used to justify them and it should not be used as a means to condemn a game without any actual explanation about why it's bad.  Just to give an example: This game is a bad game because there is no interactivity with anything except for automatic doors and because there are simply no gameplay mechanics. It's not bad because it's an early access game. It being an early access game also does not justify those problems because the developer is charging for a product that he/she him/herself claims is incomplete."
shittykickstarters,2yn0v4,asimilator,-1,Thu Mar 12 22:53:55 2015 UTC,"It literally means the game isn't done. Not just but fixes. Not just rebalances. Incomplete. You can argue that this game was released far too early (even on early access), but fundamentally you don't seem to understand what early access is.   If you don't like early access, or have a problem with how certain games are released as early access you can take the radical step of not buying them! But it's crazy judgemental to assume no one else sees value in the concept (or simply wants to financially support the devs)."

shittykickstarters,2yk6rt,tw04,7,Tue Mar 10 16:02:55 2015 UTC,plenty of cam models sell their snapchat names and the likes now. There's obviously a market for this.
shittykickstarters,2yk6rt,metarinka,3,Tue Mar 10 20:43:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but there's no point in bidding on the item unless the winner receives something that can't be replicated. Selling the video at a flat rate is different because then there's no need to ""win."""
shittykickstarters,2yk6rt,tw04,5,Tue Mar 10 20:49:41 2015 UTC,"yah, but if you have a ""favourite"" model or whatever you may not know the other winner, DCMA etc it will get taken down if posted. hence I think the business model would work.   as mentioned people pay for porn even though  you can find just about unlimited amounts here on reddit or the internet at large. people still pay for webcams."
shittykickstarters,2yk6rt,metarinka,6,Tue Mar 10 20:51:08 2015 UTC,Why would you buy something then sell it for less?
shittykickstarters,2yk6rt,creepingcold,31,Tue Mar 10 16:18:33 2015 UTC,"because it is a digital item. you can reproduce it without any additional cost.  you can buy it once from one person, which also sells it through the auction to one person.  and afterwards you can sell it on an other or private site for 0,xx% of the cost to xxxx people which will lead you to a profit"
shittykickstarters,2yk6rt,ClintHammer,40,Tue Mar 10 16:28:57 2015 UTC,I'm literally laughing in my office right now. I didn't think about selling it more than once. I'm running low on think juice.

shittykickstarters,2yn5cn,Scratch_Card,15,Wed Mar 11 03:57:41 2015 UTC,"Godus backer here. Backed because I'm a crusty old fuck who bought Populous back when it was new, and it sparked a lifelong interest in PC gaming. ""I'm re-making Populous"" was all Peter had to say to get my money. I currently have +100 hours of Godus game time on Steam, through multiple iterations of the game.  Honestly, this dev cycle hasn't felt half as dramatic and heart-breaking as the gaming press makes it out to be. I always read articles like this and wind up scratching my head.   Peter is Peter. I went in knowing that. He's gonna run off at the mouth about amazing features that may or may not make the final cut. No, it's not great, but that's always been something I chalked up to enthusiasm, not malice. Early on, the PC game was going to feature micro-transactions in the form of a second currency that could be bought to skip some tedious grinding. People complained, and rightly so; this hadn't been mentioned in the original KS page. Peter and 22 Cans listened, and changed it. (The mobile game still has this feature, but not the PC game.) A lot of developers would've just ignore those complaints. And finally and importantly, I think Kickstarter has cut open and exposed to public scrutiny the world of game development. Devs used to have the luxury to fuck up in blissful privacy; not anymore. And as a tiny studio, 22 Cans is gonna take awhile to get shit done. Fucking duh. Three years in development with no end in sight isn't what I went in expecting, but the game's been in a playable state for a very long time and I've gotten my money's worth out of it already.   The post-campaign hasn't run baby smooth and lightning-fast (See: War for the Overworld, Satellite Reign), but ti was no fucking Yogsventures, either. Everything I've read about this situation paints Godas as the unsalvageable diasasterpiece, when it's definitely not."

shittykickstarters,2ykupj,Enlightenment777,27,Tue Mar 10 17:33:16 2015 UTC,"This lawsuit seems questionable to me. As the article says, it's literally the German word for ""power station"". Aren't trademarks generally limited to their line of business?  The chances of someone looking at this product and thinking ""Huh, this USB power supply must be an official product of that German electronic music group from the 70s!"" is probably rather small."
shittykickstarters,2ykupj,tweq,14,Tue Mar 10 18:29:26 2015 UTC,"And the funny thing is that the charger is supposed to create electrical energy from natural gas. So it literally is a power plant or ""Kraftwerk"" in german."
shittykickstarters,2ykupj,Chris204,11,Tue Mar 10 23:15:37 2015 UTC,"I guess their thinking is that this is being marketed towards a primarily English-speaking market in the US who are likely to know the word 'Kraftwerk' only through the band.  That said, I agree with you and I think they're stretching it a little, because the Pitchfork article says that they're suing because the device is for charging musical devices and consumers will find that confusing and associate it with the band. The Kickstarter page doesn't mention music-players anywhere. You could charge muscial devices with it, but the Kickstarter seems much more concerned with phones."
shittykickstarters,2ykupj,CoruscantSunset,10,Tue Mar 10 23:44:12 2015 UTC,"Well, Kraftwerk is still very active and touring around the world. 55 concerts last year and 19 of them in the US.  And doesn't trademark in US work that you need to challenge people using it to keep it?"
shittykickstarters,2ykupj,PMgep,9,Tue Mar 10 20:26:27 2015 UTC,"And doesn't trademark in US work that you need to challenge people using it to keep it?   Yes, but only if there's a genuine risk of confusion, as far as I understand it. Apple Inc. doesn't have to (and can't) sue every apple farmer, for example.  I'm not a lawyer though, and maybe the fact that it's a foreign word changes things in the US? Kraftwerk certainly doesn't have exclusive use of the word in Germany, but apparently they're suing in Delaware (despite both the band and company being German)."
shittykickstarters,2ykupj,tweq,3,Tue Mar 10 21:32:35 2015 UTC,"Could be, I'm not a lawyer either, or from the US.  Reason for Delaware is that the company is based there now, and not in Germany according to the project bio."

And from there conceived of this like self-help/self-empowerment movement.  It was all quite delusional.  He hosted a few events for the movement, but apparently his friends got sick of him talking the self-help and multi-level marketing garbage and he had a falling out with lots of people.  He got tired of the negativity and the site vanished.  He used to have a lot more videos on his youtube channel too, but deleted them all.

I was really, really hoping you weren't going to notice that little evasive handwave thereâ¦   You're of course absolutely right: there's lots of epistemology in philosophy, and knowledge acquisition in a variety of forms (not just formal learning but perception, implication, and the like) is a substantial part of epistemology. The thing is, while philosophers talk about learning, they typically don't give a damn about learning itself in its own right.  For me, when I've got my philosopher hat on and I'm trying to come up with a grand universal Theory of Knowledge, then the reason I need to consider learning is that I need to make sure my theory accounts for it: if I'm trying to claim that people don't know anything except the knowledge they're born with, then the fact that people obviously learn new things is going to be a real problem for me, and I've got some refining to do. In other words, I'm looking at the concept of learning rather than the practice, and I'm doing it for instrumental reasons, not because of any prior interest in it. While I may well want to construct a Theory of Knowledge, I wouldn't want to, or know how to, construct a Theory of Learning. The study of learning itself is something I'd have to send you down the hall to the cognitive scientists to get.  TL;DR: yep, epistemology talks about learning, but in a way that isn't necessarily relevant to actual humans doing actual learning.  (Um. I'm not sure that addresses, much less answers, your question? Sorry, I think I'm committing Tired on the Internet. In any case, no need to apologize for your earlier comment; I was being unnecessarily defensive.)"

Side question - do modern philosophers think we have some body of knowledge at birth, or is it still Tabula Rasa?  Your perspective on learning is interesting from my perspective, since I do linguistics and there are in fact a lot of people on the theory side and in language acquisition who really are interested in Theories of Learning.  (And then there are some compling machine learning people who either a) think that because they have a system that can sort of learn language they have solved Learning, or b) human language acquisition doesn't matter because machine learning is the future and is much more likely to make them money than something modeled after linguistic theory.)"
shittykickstarters,2yg5rk,arcesilaus,1 point,Tue Mar 10 04:19:57 2015 UTC,"Linguistics, excellent. I'll try to stop the patronizing ELI5 then--sorry about that.   The sidebar: I haven't dealt with epistemology for years, but when I last checked in, nobody was claiming innate knowledge in the strong sense I think you're getting at. Possibly an a priori capacity for certain types of reasoning, yes; conceptual content no. The distinction there can blur quite easily, of course, but as a rule the closest you'd get to a real-world example of the broader rationalist claim would be indeed a handwave at, say, Chomsky, which (as I understand it) involves a commitment to the innate existence & accessibility of a conceptual framework (sorry--best I've got without looking it up), but despite the restriction of that framework to a single domain it isn't itself contentful in any but the thinnest of senses. We have a certain innate abstract knowledge, for a given description of 'knowledge', but just because we have that for language it doesn't follow that we have it for anything else, much less a language or any other interesting mental item. <-- this is about as nuanced a description as I think I've ever gotten in a philosophical setting, i.e. not at all.  So we can be rationalists and still explain learning and not be crazy.  And if you're some flavor of empiricist, this works out to: the most we concede is a predisposition and every item of knowledge obtained in accordance with a predisposition is nonetheless gained only through (say) perceptual experience. So we can allow for a variety of Chomsky and still explain learning and not be crazy. (Keep in mind it's been years since I've had to look at any of this, and I've almost forgotten the questions, let alone the answers.)  Perhaps unexpectedly, I think it's philosophy of mind rather than philosophy of language that winds up being most likely to touch on theories of learning: philosophy of mind cares about what the mind looks like & how it's stocked & how it gets to structured mental content; philosophy of language cares about what we do with it once it's there, namely worry about meaning, reference, truth, and so on.  Even so, that doesn't get us to actual theories of (language) learning, which is a shame because they're cool. Tell me more. Does anything I've said about what my side does that sounds like it has any chance of intersecting with your side of things? Are the theories of learning you use built outward from language acquisition or extensions of more general mental models? I suppose what I mean by that is parallel to the machine language issue: how much traction can the linguistic theory get on the general & vice versa?

EDIT: checking now, those kits I was talking about come with multiple cubes, so math doesn't quite apply.. but I'd still guess this isn't an unreasonable price as tungsten is expensive by itself and working with it sounds pretty difficult.

You might find some tungsten as counterweigts in rotorcraft, but in each case, it doesn't have to be pure tungsten, it only needs to be really, really heavy.  This also means that you can buy a really fucking heavy bucking bar on ebay for about half the price of what they're offering.  And either way, you can do the math: they claim their 1"" cube weighs 296 grams. A 1"" cube of pure tungsten weighs 315 grams. 296/315 = 0.939, or about 94%.  oh shit man, you really blew the lid off of this kickstarter, what with that whole one percent that's missing /s"

There are plenty of people complaining about:   Nothing received - Shipping has been going on for well over a month and still nothing for a lot of people. Damaged goods - Tungsten is being packed in regular styrofoam inside a carboard box, which is disintegrating in transit due to its weight, and as a result the cubes are getting dings and chips on edges and corners. Imperfect cubes - A lot of cubes are showing up with stains and tooling/machining marks on them straight from the factory and aren't going to make for elegant desk toys, which is much of the reason these were being purchased. Lack of communication - Looks like the creator hasn't stuck around for very long once the money showed up and hasn't bothered to do any real damage control lately. False claims? - So it turns out that the stretch goal of Magnesium-Lithium cubes are actually turning out to be Magnesium-Aluminum alloys, so something less expensive and also not as light as was promised in the campaign. Glass stands? - Nope, try acrylic stands that are worthless, since the cubes just fall off the stands at the slightest vibration and are more likely to just damage the cubes and/or the surfaces they are being displayed on.   You could tell from the beginning that the KS creator wasn't really an engineer, just a businessman.  None of the tone of his writing gave you the impression he actually had a personal vested interest in the metals industry.  Material orders were probably just phoned in with very little oversight to ensure actual quality products.    And how else do you end up promising MgLi but instead be ok with having MgAl cubes sent out instead?  MgAl is much cheaper than MgLi, but denser(heavier) than even pure Mg.  He either allowed this ""bait and switch"" knowingly, which makes him a shady person, or he had no idea, which makes him very uninvolved in his own project.  As a result a lot of people who backed him early on from some of his vocal critics got burned, which is why maybe they're strangely silent now instead of trying to refute the current angry comments from backers."

Sex toys? No problem. Business plan? Problem.   I would also publish a very limited number of hard copies of the book and see how they sell and maybe go into a more mass production.   To wit, I thought the whole point was for her to actually, you know, publish a book, not just do a tiny print run if it she happens to feel like it. And once she's got this minuscule print run -- and possibly an online listing, it's hard to tell -- she wants to use it to gauge mass market appeal? So she wants to waste Â£1000 on unmarketed vanity publishing she can't sell using a photographer who works for Â£500.   If you want my money, at least try not to treat me like an idiot.

shittykickstarters,2ydmig,arcesilaus,6,Mon Mar 9 02:41:29 2015 UTC,"Isn't that SOP for crowdfunding, though?  Literally the point of it is to ask people to buy you stuff so you can launch a product.  If your plans for launching your product are bad, that's one thing, but just saying ""I need $X to buy Y so I can make my thing"" is not crazy.  (Of course if it's actually just ""buy me a thing"" that's against Kickstarter's rules anyway.)"
shittykickstarters,2ydmig,SuitableDragonfly,2,Mon Mar 9 03:20:04 2015 UTC,"Fair point. I suppose what I mainly have in mind are the cases where the funds being asked for are effectively an end in themselves with no product beyond the acquisition of the money: not so much ""I need $X to get Y to accomplish Z"" but ""I want $X so I can get Y for myself"".   Outright buying somebody something is as you say against Kickstarter's rules, but in a lot of these crappy kickstarters people try to get around that by fabricating a goal Z which conveniently enough happens to require us to fund Y. ""I want money to get a new computer to store my media because I was thinking about getting into programming at some point"" isn't, for me, compelling. By contrast, ""I want money to get a new computer so I can edit my film"" has much more claim on me.  In other words, I'm fine with funding Y provided there actually is a product the person is trying to create. For me in most cases that means something that aims to at least slightly benefit, or even just involve, other people; something that obeys the laws of physics; and which is in principle achievable even if quite unlikely. My test for that is usually along the lines of ""would the owner back this campaign if it was somebody else's?"". That test is defeasible in any number of ways, of course, but for me it's a useful place to start.  The other objection I have to these the failure to explain what they would do with my money if they got it. If somebody asks me for $X, I want to know what the connection is between the amount X and the desired means Y. The explanation doesn't have to be detailed, it doesn't have to be right, it doesn't have to seem especially realistic, but I want to know why they picked $X rather than any other amount, and ""it's a round number"" doesn't count. If somebody can answer that, even vaguely, then I have reason to think they understand their own project, and that's really all I'm asking for.  (Also, the people who think I'm stupid enough to be fooled by their campaign into giving them money annoy me, but that's not principled as much as petulant.)"

Not terribly much, but we don't get any reason he needs the money.   I just learned about the Pebble watch, but there seems to be a lot of free watch faces available online. It doesn't look like there'll be much of a market for PebbleUp. I don't think his designs are terrible, but I wouldn't pay for them."
shittykickstarters,2ycotj,ThineAntidote,3,Sun Mar 8 18:08:18 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of watchfaces right now, with a few of them being paid. The difference is that the paid ones I know actually look better. These just look mundane.   But there's definitely a market. The Pebble Time raised a lot of money, and there aren't any colour watchfaces yet, since the original Pebble only had a black-and-white screen."
shittykickstarters,2ycotj,outadoc,1 point,Mon Mar 9 07:00:09 2015 UTC,"The fact that there aren't any colour watch faces online yet doesn't mean there won't be any. I personally find these designs too mundane to be worth paying for, but I've realized that children may like them. It doesn't sound too bad, actually - most children lack the patience to make their own designs, and parents are probably willing to spend a few dollars on a lot of child-friendly watch faces. The only problem is ""how many children would own a smart watch?"". I don't think the number is that low, considering the popularity of Pebble and the fact that quite a few parents buy expensive devices for their children."
shittykickstarters,2ycotj,ThineAntidote,2,Mon Mar 9 10:56:15 2015 UTC,"Oh, there will be lots. And that's why I'm not sure a kickstarter will be enough to stand out, especially if the guy doesn't make especially good-looking stuff. Even children would probably want something more fun, and won't really care if they get a new watchface every month or what."
shittykickstarters,2ycotj,outadoc,2,Mon Mar 9 11:23:31 2015 UTC,"I think most PebbUp buyers will be children and parents that don't know better (unless there's an underwhelming number of child-friendly free designs, in which case buying PebbUp is perfectly understandable). Children aren't known for their high standards, so I think they're far more likely to want the PebbUp designs than adults are. Edit: Clarity."
shittykickstarters,2ycotj,ThineAntidote,2,Mon Mar 9 11:34:44 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe once it's in stores, but for now I think buyers probably know what they do. Maybe the guy should have waited for a bit before rushing on starting his kickstarter."
shittykickstarters,2ycotj,outadoc,2,Mon Mar 9 11:53:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for listing the American prices. I had no clue how much he was asking for, and this saved me the tune of looking it up!  I've never even heard of this product he's designing the watch faces for, and it sounds like there isn't really a market for what he's offering. Definitely not worth paying for."
shittykickstarters,2ycotj,Opium_Poppy,6,Mon Mar 9 02:37:15 2015 UTC,"The original Pebble and new Pebble Time, have, together, raised over 25 million dollars on Kickstarter alone. This is a major product with a lot of owners. And when you've got that many users, it's entirely plausible that people are willing to pay a premium for good-quality accessories.  I don't know if this guy's really going to do what he says he will, but all things considered, this is one of the most sensible Kickstarters I've seen on this subreddit."
shittykickstarters,2ycotj,ZorbaTHut,3,Mon Mar 9 06:38:18 2015 UTC,"/u/Opium_Poppy, you're welcome.    While there's a free online tool that lets you create Pebble watch faces, it's likely that many users would rather pay a few dollars for a lot of designs than go through the trouble of creating their own. However, I'd still consider the free watch faces online a problem. I also notice that the tool can't be used to make the design in the middle of the picture (I found a way to position the hours and the minutes separately, but couldn't split up the two digits that make up the hours and minutes). He never shows any of his designs in action (his video seems to consist of him talking while showing you Paint pictures), which suggests that he hasn't actually tried to make watchfaces. This isn't great for his credibility, but as using the generator isn't hard and coming up with new designs shouldn't be that difficult, his goal of making watch faces isn't that unrealistic.    I just checked out his bio and found out that even though this guy is Norwegian, he asks for Danish kroner (the Norwegian currency is also called ""kroner"", but not the same). I don't know if it's his or Kickstarter's fault, but it's weird. Kickstarter is open to projects based in Norway in case you were wondering."
shittykickstarters,2ycotj,ThineAntidote,3,Mon Mar 9 08:26:55 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, I had no idea it was such a popular product! And judging from another comment, it seems like the custom watch faces are something new and different. Maybe I stand corrected."

All I'm trying to say it that people seem to keep ignoring wage hours like it's some sort of evil in the tech industry. For some reason people on the internet seem to get all butt-hurt when content creators actually expect to make a decent wage for the time they invest in a project. I can understand why they're hesitant to own up to that fact. It's not like the site is generating a lot of ad revenue. I dunno how do you think they expect to eat, pay rent and all those other things that money from a full time job provides? Just for a moment let's pretend that they don't have any server fees, and the money is going directly into their pockets. That's $7500 per member of their team. Just for shits and giggles I gave them a reasonable working wage of 12/hr, which equates to around 15 months of funding figuring a 40 hr work week, aka 'full-time' like their kickstarter suggests. I mean, hell... could you live for a year off of $7500? That's like seriously below the poverty line right there. Honestly I'm just playing devil's advocate here, and probably giving them more credit then is due, but what if they wanted to hire a full time admin or something like that? There are lots of expenses that add up, especially when you start attaching more and more bodies to a project."

Seriously though, what did you expect to happen? Why do you even care in the first place? Is this some sort of hobby of yours, going around kickstarter asking people to show you their expense reports? Again, I'm not supporting their behavior, but is it really that surprising? Perception bias is a serious thing that you have, like, a 0% chance of overcoming in a majority of behind-the-keyboard interactions. Your a guy questioning a feminist's financial intentions online and you expect anything less then the nuclear option in response?  Don't feed the trolls is like internet 101, kid."

That sucks that they spurned a potential backer but get over it; there's no need for a pity party or a witch hunt. They're probably just lashing out at you because they see you as a safe target they could vent on without fear of doxxing, stalking, or physical assault. It sounds messed up but I would totally not be surprised if that was the case. I guess I'm just disheartened by the deeply ingrained narcissism in all of internet culture; I mean I kinda doubt you were the only person to question their projections. I'm sure they have to deal with a lot of actual legitimate questions from backers and don't have much free time to answer every person who thinks they're paying too much for web hosting.  ...but your right, I probably don't have a point. I'm mostly just half-awake and bitching that people suck and for the most part will do nothing but piss you off and make fun of you.

Wouldn't you agree, that the email response OP got to a legitimate financial question is a bit rude/uncalled for?  And even after OP stayed on point and civil they decide to post false statements about him on twitter?  Do you think OP asking for clarification on how they arrived at the amount they ask for before backing was wrong?   but your right, I probably don't have a point.   Well, the thing is, that in my opinion it's pretty clear who is at fault here and the kickstarter's response is seriously uncalled for and downright stupid. By acting that childishly to a legitimate request they brought all this negative publicity on themselves.  One could argue, that maybe this was their intention all along, to create drama to play the victim on twitter to get more backers. But we wouldn't go that far now would we."

shittykickstarters,2y73dw,-devops-,28,Sat Mar 7 05:12:47 2015 UTC,"If anything I would say that he only got persistent as a reaction to the campaign owner adamantly refusing to approach the subject and trying to ignore it, which usually implies something.  Non-backers are allowed to ask questions before backing a project -- it's simply doing due diligence which any investor should do before spending any money. When the other party starts being incredibly evasive and refuses to divulge anything at all, especially something that is effectively public pricing (you can ballpark how much they spend using public sources), there is a problem.    If one is reasonably well-versed in hosting: asking for $600/month to run a plain Wordpress blog (90%+ cachable content) with that kind of budget -- this screams either getting scammed, or fraud in some way, or some form of extreme mismanagement, because $20/month in the world of WP means you can serve more pageviews per week than Femsplain has gotten in its entire lifetime.   If they [Femsplain] are actually paying 600 a month to share a virtual machine with a lot of other sites, then most definitely I would be advising them that someone/their webhost is attempting to rip them off or line their own pockets. This isn't hate, it's very simply that people in the industry would see this situation as someone in the process of being robbed, and want to help out or ask if they are ok -- this is out of concern.  [written from POV of someone that has dealt with VC funding, not so much crowdfunding - I don't care what the content of a campaign is, this is strictly technical and I'd raise the same issue no matter what type of site it is, if it's this situation]"

Reddit is an example of a site that is heavily dynamic - all pageloads are different to everyone for a number of reasons.   OTOH, they are running Wordpress, and not even doing comments inhouse (they use a thirdparty free comment service), so that means right out of the box they have virtually zero load.

Just because tshirts have been made before doesn't mean the book is closed on tshirt design.  Obviously 56+ people like the design of this particular wallet so I'd say its a relative success.

shittykickstarters,2y4c43,2_3,37,Fri Mar 6 08:42:22 2015 UTC,"So, obviously anything directly addressing women and games/tech/STEM is a bit of a minefield right now. That being said, I don't see anything wrong with this.   essentially claiming that the reason that women in technology are unable to find longterm work because they have trouble articulating themselves in interviews   They do not claim this. Nowhere do they state that getting a job is as simple as articulating oneself.  I sometimes see this sentiment angrily expressed, but we are aware that helping minorities get a leg up is not the same thing as viewing them as incapable or stupid, right? Directing a campaign aimed at a specific demographic to encourage them into an area that could provide them a better life is not wrong. There is a high, HIGH barrier to entry (we all know this, I don't even know why I sourced it), and trying to address the uneven playing field shouldn't be taboo.   We have learned the hard way how to project ourselves as skilled, competent, easy to work with, and an asset to even an all-male team of programmers.    All I see here is a group of women expressing that the stuff they learned in school is not enough to get a job, as well as working on the existing biases that may prevent women from working in the field. You could wait for the Behavioral and Brain Sciences to publish a piece on how women have specifically have difficulty in these kinds of interviews, but with the already existing studies on the skewed perception women face, it feels a bit unnecessary.  They aren't even attacking men, only stating that in their experience, women have difficulty making the jump between earning their degree and getting into the workforce.   We are going to put on a training seminar to show women how using a base skill set can lead to a solid and worthwhile career in software and web development.   I don't see anything offensive in this statement. It's not assuming women are incompetent, it's recognizing that there is a demand for specific character attributes in tech and that women may be taught to downplay said attributes.  Also, as far as kickstarters go, they articulated themselves very well, they are offering a helpful service, and their prizes aren't bad. Based on the fact that it succeeded, and the fact that the higher-tier prizes that offered even more training were nearly filled across the board, there is clearly a demand for what they're offering. This isn't like the magical watches that keep getting funded on IGG, this is a service that many people can use. Not to mention they actually came through with their rewards.  tl;dr Kickstarters aren't shitty just because you don't like the premise."
shittykickstarters,2y4c43,mosdefin,15,Fri Mar 6 12:25:59 2015 UTC,"IT manager-among-other-things-here weighing in (I'm a dude if you hadn't figured that out from the username):  In my limited, anecdotal experience, it's not so much that the women I work with have had ""trouble articulating themselves"" - more that they tend (note: tend) to be more diplomatic and indirect.  That can sometimes be an awesome thing, especially when bringing calm reason into a room full of ugga-ugga-me-like-donut alpha geeks, it can also be a drag if it prevents a direct expression of what's needed.   The other extreme I have experienced with female colleagues more often than with men, although you see it with both genders, is an overcompensation for shyness or being disadvantaged, either real or perceived.  Especially in tech or finance heavy environments, there are often far fewer women around, so a woman who is assertive can come across as more aggressive just because many guys aren't used to it or expecting it.  One observation about a line you quoted,   We have learned the hard way how to project ourselves as skilled, competent, easy to work with, and an asset to even an all-male team of programmers.   That's not even saying ""women are awesome"", but that women have had to overcome barriers bringing their awesomeness across.  It reads a bit over-generalized, though, but maybe that goes back to my prior point about almost expecting women to be wishy-washy.   it's recognizing that there is a demand for specific character attributes in tech and that women may be taught to downplay said attributes.   That's a really insightful way of putting it - even if in many cases (I have no idea, honestly) women aren't being explicitly ""taught"" that, but have it communicated to them otherwise."

shittykickstarters,2y4c43,SuitableDragonfly,3,Fri Mar 6 23:48:19 2015 UTC,"More often than not it is, kind of my point.  It's a shitty cycle - guys are not used to women (or intimidated by the idea, or just plain dicks), women may not be confident enough, may have preconceptions, may just be reacting to guys' reactions, real or perceived, guys re-react to women, take it from there.  Or, (often, but unfortunately not often enough) everyone just gets on with their jobs"
shittykickstarters,2y4c43,SuitableDragonfly,-2,Fri Mar 6 23:55:15 2015 UTC,"No, if guys are perceiving a woman who is being merely assertive as being aggressive, that is definitely their problem.  Women are punished for being assertive by being called ""agressive"" or ""bossy"" or ""bitchy"" when they are, which is why they are so often unassertive.  It's not something we imagine, it happens all the time.  There have been studies proving it, even."

Kids know when game is on and when game is off.  That doesn't work?  They don't have a console/pc to game on anymore.  No need for this fluff.  This is the one part that bugs me:   WatchDog redirects the kidâs frustration away from you when times-up.   I don't need a strawman for my kids' frustration with the rules."
shittykickstarters,2y7siy,theoldfamiliarsting,2,Sat Mar 7 07:59:43 2015 UTC,Came here to say just that! As a parent I think this is brilliant
shittykickstarters,2y7siy,potpastor,2,Sat Mar 7 12:43:36 2015 UTC,"This actually seems like a pretty good idea. When I was a kid the game console that my brothers and I bought with our own money would often be taken away because my brothers were dicks who would play too long and wouldn't listen to our mom. If we had something like this to restrain them then I would have gotten the opportunity to play more. I can see how this could be abused by parents or serve as a convenient replacement for actual parenting, though. With proper parent/child communication I don't see why this can't be used as an affective tool."

shittykickstarters,2y7siy,Stonephone,-3,Sat Mar 21 17:42:56 2015 UTC,"shitty as in u should have more control over your kids then to use this as a substitute, but just my opinion , plus kids would find a way to disable this in 2 seconds."
shittykickstarters,2y7siy,Stonephone,3,Sat Mar 7 13:49:36 2015 UTC,That's not really what makes a kickstarter shitty; this isn't /r/ideologiesIdisagreewith.
shittykickstarters,2y16zz,bardicfury,31,Thu Mar 5 16:12:56 2015 UTC,"This had such potential to be charming, like an enthusiastic toddler showing grandma what happens when you squeeze a juicebox, but then he asked for money and now he's just an overgrown brat using his juicebox for irony and evil."
shittykickstarters,2y16zz,arcesilaus,16,Thu Mar 5 16:29:46 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, it isn't like he's asking for a quarter of a million dollars."
shittykickstarters,2y16zz,canteen_boy,18,Thu Mar 5 17:16:27 2015 UTC,"True. Come to think of it, it's better-written than 90% of kickstarters out there, which all by itself probably warrants considerably more than the Â£100 he's asking for. Maybe he should set up a campaign offering to write other people's campaigns--I'd fund that in a heartbeat."
shittykickstarters,2y16zz,arcesilaus,14,Thu Mar 5 17:34:24 2015 UTC,Do you really think this guy deserves any of your money?
shittykickstarters,2y16zz,zoltecrules,14,Thu Mar 5 18:52:36 2015 UTC,Wow. I assumed the author was 7 years old.
shittykickstarters,2y16zz,canteen_boy,3,Thu Mar 5 18:57:01 2015 UTC,I'd been assuming he was about 16; if he's that old he should at least be buying his backers a beer of their very own.

Well, I did wonder why those paragraphs were written so much better than everything else on the Kickstarter page.    Converted prices:     Goal: Almost $2,400. First reward: About $9.50 for early access and maybe a giveaway of a low-budget amateur game (not saying that amateurs can't make worthwhile games, but that's pretty expensive, especially when all we have is the game title and an ugly screenshot). Second reward: Almost $36 for a T-shirt advertising a game we have no idea what is.   Edit: Formatting"
